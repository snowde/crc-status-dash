Erica F.,"LONG ISLAND CITY, NY",500,332,1619,5.0,11/12/2017,"They are located at a large mall area so there is plenty of parking there, not always you will find a empty spot closer to the restaurant as there are many other restaurant close by so the spots near the door get taken quick.  The place inside is pretty large there are plenty of tables and lots of staff personnel so it's a fairy quick and efficient service here. The waitress we got was pretty good and quick to get our drinks and the appetizers, that shows that this place is well organized and super efficient with the ticket times. The menu is very populated with plenty of choices for all tastes. They are known for their pizzas and burgers so it is worth to give it a go on those specially during their specials as they do have some specials for those items during different days of the week as well as beer specials.  Here is what I had: STRAWBERRY MOJITO- this mojito was pretty nice and sweet, plenty of fresh fruit in it as well. If you a sweet drink liver this is a drink for you.  HAM AND CHEESE SANDWICH- I was pleasantly surprised by this sandwich it was delicious! They have a Alfredo sauce in it that made the sandwich taste so special that I did not want the meal to end. I has as a side a garlic knot and that was a fresh and warm garlicky piece of heaven. I appreciate that they accommodated to my request and served me that instead of fries on the side.  CHURROS- the CHURROS desert is is a pretty large desert so you possibly can share with more than 3 ppl, it is perfect to dip the CHURROS into the ice cream and eat them while the CHURROS are warm.  They also have military discount for the meal so don't forget to ask for your discount.  My overall impression of this restaurant was pretty positive, fronvthe ambiance to the service and the prices this is a great place to come and celebrate a special day with friends."
Victoria H.,"Dayton, OH",27,15,35,2.0,1/7/2018,"This was our first and will be our only experience here. We ordered a delivery pepperoni extreme deep dish pizza. So I'll start with the good first.  The pizza has a nice taste and the crust is good. However, it was not 30 dollars worth of delicious, nor 30 dollars worth of bread; which is mostly what it was. I have attached the photo from the menu and photos of the pizza we received. It hardly had any cheese or sauce.  When you pay that much for a pizza you expect it to be you know ""extreme"". The only extreme thing about this pizza is it's cost. If this pizza had the toppings like in the menu I'm sure it would have been wonderful and maybe close to worth its price, but sadly it did not live up to the expectations."
Tom S.,"Dayton, OH",74,112,2,1.0,11/8/2017,"I was there a few days ago. The primary reason is because I had found a place where there were people pre-buying veteran's a beer for Vets Day; they do this online. I thought how nice! So I wanted to partake as a veteran. I went to BJs to redeem the coupon for the beer and also decided to buy an appetizer, which was the sliders. The sliders were pretty much hideous. The buns were black and clearly burnt. The meat patties were clearly over cooked and crispy. I'm pretty sure that burger patties are not supposed to be crispy. The presentation was very sloppy. They couldn't be bothered with building the sliders so that they were lined up and ready to eat. I had to do this myself. The grilled onions were black and I think mostly disintegrated during the cooking process. Obviously, they have very little quality control on their food. The cook didn't care; the expediter didn't care, if they have one; and the waitstaff didn't care what they served! Then the server/bartender had the audacity to tell me that the pre-purchased beer was for their brand only!  I had ordered a Stella. I told her she should've told me that in advance. Quite frankly, I was insulted and disappointed in the entire experience! The food sucked and to ask me to pay for a beer that someone else wanted to buy for a veteran--really?! Shame on YOU BJs! Never again--there are many better restaurants to frequent than this dump. Don't waste your time. 11/12/2017  BTW...The General Manager says they tried to fix the issue....During the last visit...the waitress tried to charge me 3 times for the full price of the sliders + beer; and, for some reason she couldn't see that on the bill herself--I had to tell her 3x's!! I did not get the entire bill free, either. The Manager's attitude was not that great; she seemed bothered by the situation and condescending. And unfortunately, the re-fire sliders weren't much better (ie, burgers overcooked, onions black & disintegrated, etc). The Manager in no way checked to ensure the re-fire was good, much less perfect. Thanks, but no thanks."
Deven W.,"Dayton, OH",0,4,,5.0,1/3/2018,This is my most favorite steakhouse restaurant in is my third favorite restaurants in the world.the customer service is really good the food is amazing and their world class pouzouki is to die for.
Sirron B.,"Albuquerque, NM",11,230,833,4.0,8/25/2017,The service there is outstanding. They will help you explain all the different types of beers drinks and foods when you leave you will be more knowledgeable about beers and hops than when you arrived. They have a well verse menu they have everything from steak to Burgers to shrimp. Salads whatever you want they have. During football season they have live music out on the patio where you can come relax and listen to some nice bands and enjoy the football game.
Alicia S.,"Lakewood, WA",8,11,1,1.0,12/14/2017,"While we typically love BJs . This review is due to their inconsistent food. We go here 3-4 times a month for dates. On occasion , the rice for the barbacoa chicken has been a bit undercooked. Tonight , my boyfriend ordered it and the rice was so hard you would think they didn't even cook it. Very disappointing to get food of Lower quality than fast food for triple the price . I also used to get the ahi salad but the last time the fish was not fresh and I got sick. Management needs to get on top of food quality. Since they opened they have had issues with timing (appetizers not coming out at all or salads right before entree ) but when the food is inedible ... looks like Mackenzie river is our new go to ."
kimberley f.,"Dayton, OH",93,54,102,4.0,6/6/2017,"I have mixed emotions about this restaurant. We have been here a few times and really haven't had the best experiences.  We were hungry and decided to try this place again. Ugh! I don't know why we do this. Ha! They sat us pretty quick. Good. Then we waited and waited...  There was a table next to us with about 10 to 12 people at it. They were getting their food, so we kinda figured that was our server too. Yep. Finally, she stopped by and took drink order and we ordered an app at the same time. Drinks came quickly. And it went downhill from there. We waited and waited  again. Dinner came, but no appitizer. I asked her, she forgot. She offered to get it in for us, I said no, what's the point now. Not a big deal. Hubby had a prime rib sandwich. He liked it. He was hungry and had a bunch eaten before I could take a picture. LOL!  I had a burger (I can't remember the name) it had bacon, cheese, salsa verde and an egg. I asked for mid rare and the egg to be over easy. Well, it looked super good. I took 4 or 5 bites and I was done. It was ok. It was overcooked,  the meat and the egg. I did take a picture of it.The fries were good. The server was really good about how I felt. She offered to get me a new one or something else. But, I wasn't feeling good, so I told her I was ok. She grabbed the bill and said let me fix this. Even the manager stopped by asked how everything was. He was just like the server, offered whatever I wanted, really apologetic and really nice. But, I was ok. So, to wrap this up... I have no idea if we'll go back again or not.  In the end, the excellent customer service earned the 4 stars."
Liana N.,"Honolulu, HI",121,116,797,4.0,11/13/2016,"I was very happy when BJ's opened up in the Dayton area because it was one of my go to places when I was living on the West Coast. I've been to BJ's multiple times and am always satisfied with their food. The service has always been great for me. It is a chain restaurant and they offer their own beer selection.  They are known for their deep dish pizzas and pizookies.  Bj's tends to get very busy on Friday nights and the weekend so you can either call ahead to put your name down on the list or use their app to put your name down as well. The wait times can start from 30 minutes to over an hour on a busy night. Be prepared to wait! It's a great atmosphere and you can always order a drink or two at the bar while you wait for your table to be ready. There are plenty of options to choose from and at times, their menu can be somewhat daunting. However, there is something for everyone to choose from. They offer the lighter options and their signature dishes as well. I have ordered burgers, pizzas, salads, sandwiches, and of course, their pizookies (cookie baked in a pan topped with ice cream) during my visits.  I would recommend ordering a turkey burger, California Grilled Chicken sandwich, BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad, or any of their pizzas. All of their pizookies are great! It comes fresh out of the oven with a scoop of creamy vanilla ice cream. I mean, who would not like that? I always have a difficult time when choosing the cookie because I just want a bite of all the variations! The most popular pizookie is Chocolate Chip. Cookies and Cream is also delicious as well! If you visit on your birthday, you will get a free mini pizookie!  For this visit, we ordered half Bj's Favorite and half Sweet Pig. It came out in a timely manner and it was hot! There were plenty of toppings on the pizza and it was definitely satisfying. We had plenty of leftovers to take home! I am never disappointed when we dine at Bj's. Service and food is always good!"
Al H.,"Springfield, OH",14,9,4,4.0,11/4/2017,Our first experience was great.  My sangaria was awesome with great flavor.  So many beer choices it was hard to decide.  The waiter was extremely helpful when we ordered.  The pizza came out fast. Loved the firestone crust. Prices range from cheap to expensive.  Awesome experience.
Rica R.,"Pensacola, FL",8,58,51,4.0,5/19/2017,"We like this particular restaurant a lot. There seems to be something for everyone- pizzas, burgers, salads, tacos, sweets, etc. If you like to drink they have a full bar & they offer a ton of different beers too. Certain days of the week they have specials. Mondays are 50% off pizzas & Wednesdays are $10 burgers + unlimited fries! I really liked their Bacon-Guac burger & their fries are yummy too. Service has always been pretty good so no complaints there. We will most likely be back!"
Kristi G.,"Fairborn, OH",62,227,566,3.0,5/6/2017,"My favorite night to come is on a Wednesday night.  The best bartender....great service!  We always like to sit at the bar because it is just that much better service. She is great and always keeps our drinks filled.  My favorite item there is the SIracha dry rub bone in wings.  They are absolutely amazing.  I only give them 3 stars because I think the prices are very high.  The food has been up and down.  Some trips it is good and some has been disappointing.  Overall, it is a nice place to grab a bite and a drink.  We tend to frequent since it has a lot of options."
Craig K.,"Zionsville, IN",1,100,4,4.0,11/8/2017,I love this chain. They have a wide variety on their food and drink menu. The atmosphere is very nice and I've always had great service. Their pizzas are awesome and most of the apps I have tried are excellent as well. Tonight I tried a steak with an upgraded side of turmeric roasted cauliflower. It was good. Not great. The steak was fairly bland and lacked seasoning. The cauliflower was good but not worth the upcharge. I will definitely return but skip the steak next time.
Valerie W.,"Springfield, OH",142,433,613,5.0,7/19/2016,"Here's a great example of what a ""chain"" does best...  Plenty of interesting, CREATIVE food and drink options, (I'm DYING to try to replicate their WONDERFUL roasted Brussels sprout salad recipe at home!!) well-trained, attentive wait staff who answer all your questions and never make you feel rushed to order or finish up and pay your bill, comfortable and well-thought out setting, and soooooo many great choices that you're already planning your NEXT visit before you've even paid the bill...!! The Mister's the beer ""expert,"" so I leave that end of the equation to him, but (cough, cough!!) I manage to ""do my part"" (ha!!) in the food department, so this place was, for us, a perfect compromise!!  EXTENSIVE menu and brews a plenty!!  Looks like they've got quite a revolving listing of ""favorites"" mixed in with the seasonal/new stuff, along with a pretty extensive mixed drink menu as well, so definitely something for everyone drinks-wise.  They push their pizzas, which we didn't try this time, but we enjoyed our ""bottomless"" salsa and chip app. (plenty, no need for refills, tasty salsa) and were quickly served his French dip sandwich and fries and my GREAT salad (would make a Brussels sprout believer out of almost anyone!!).   Wonderful new addition to the Fairfield Commons area!!  We'll be back...!!"
Donald P.,"Washington, DC",273,1298,1430,3.0,11/15/2016,"Chili with the bread bowl - bread bowl was really good. Bread crust was really nice and crispy and buttery. Fries weren't bad, though I'm not really a big fan of the shoestring fries. I like my fries thicker. Best of all, on a Tuesday night it wasn't crazy busy or loud like Fox and Hounds where we would have had to have waited over 30 minutes. Jeremiah Red - meh...bitter finish Nutty Brewnette - sweeter and less bitter than the Jeremiah, thought the IBUs would indicate otherwise. Still had just a hint of the bitter aftertaste."
Jessica L.,"Columbus, OH",9,133,373,1.0,10/17/2016,"Egh. After visiting this Fairfield BJ's Brewhouse, I can honestly say that the food, service, and cleanliness all sucked. BJ's is your typical American chain with frozen food and sloppy presentation, but throw on top of that dirty floors and a staff that only had personality when they were yucking it up amongst themselves and you've got a mess of a place to eat.  We arrived on a Saturday at about 2:00pm, and though they weren't even half full and were overly saturated with waiters we had to wait about 10 minutes for our waitress to finally appear. She said the right things like ""my pleasure"" but had the personality of a piece of cardboard.  We started with the Fried Artichokes appetizer. They looked pretty and crisp on the outside, but the inside of each was freezing cold and the lemon garnish was spotty brown and dry as a bone. Not a pleasant way to start.  My husband ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken Breast meal. He was disappointed since his chicken was a LOT of fatty gristle, and his tacky ice cream scoop of mashed potatoes & broccoli were cold to the touch. I ordered the North Beach Mahi Mahi with Shrimp meal off the ""Enlightened"" Menu. HORRIBLE. First of all, I swear on everything I can that they served me COD instead of Mahi Mahi. It was the most flavorless, wettest, chewiest piece of fish I've ever had, NOTHING like the hundreds of chunks of Mahi Mahi I've dined on in my lifetime.  The shrimp were just mediocre, the couscous was sticky and broke apart in large hard chunks as if it were reheated from someone else's meal a day or two before, and the whole dish was literally swimming in broth that had way too much mint in it. I also ordered broccoli on the side, which (just like with my husbands meal) was served ice cold and super mushy. This was probably the worst meal I've ever had at a chain restaurant in a long, long time. We also had to argue with our waitress for a few minutes about the $10 off a $35 meal offer listed on their website (she was trying to force us into signing up for their rewards program just to receive this even though it doesn't state that at all on the website -- we informed her we'd never be coming back, so no need for rewards). Finally, after talking to her manager for almost 10 minutes, she ""caved"" and acted like she was doing us a huge favor by docking the $10 off our bill. Wow. Overall, this BJ's in particular really sucks and we will never be going back. Diner beware!"
Sharon F.,"Sarasota, FL",47,52,47,5.0,5/30/2017,I've eaten here for dinner and happy hour and the food was always really good. The service is always nice too. I'm a fan of their ahi tuna salad which is always beautifully displayed. They have really good pizza which my husband and son always love to order. I usually log in to their website and download their app because they give periodic discounts.
Devi C.,"Richmond Heights, OH",283,32,60,4.0,6/18/2017,Just ate there for the first time and both me and my husband loved it! He tried a flight of beers and found one he liked and I feel in love with the deep dish baked ziti! Definitely going again soon.
Jennifer G.,"Dayton, OH",72,9,5,4.0,6/9/2017,The avocado roll appetizer was really tasty. We both enjoyed our entrees and it was nice that a sampler platter of the pizookies is offered as my friend and I had different favorites! Good beer selection as well.
David S.,"Dayton, OH",20,32,143,3.0,3/29/2017,Ordered take out from here. Kale/Sprout Dinner Salad was very disappointing. They apparently forgot the romaine as there was none on the salad. Goat cheese was scarce. Cranberries were just clumped together.  Brussels sprouts were barely cooked and just quartered. Random penne noodle discovered in salad. Very little care went into making this- I've had better salads at half the price from Donato's.  And this pales in comparison to the last order from here.  On the plus the curbside pickup was ready on time and the staff person was extremely friendly.
Alicia N.,"Kaneohe, HI",0,4,7,5.0,6/22/2017,We had 6 of us for Father's Day. It was a fun time. Waitress seemed overworked and forgot us a couple of times but the manager made up for it. Food was excellent!!
Monica M.,"Southfield, MI",71,3,,4.0,5/26/2017,"I normally love this place as I was first introduced to by my daughter who lives in TX. I ordered the kale and Brussels sprouts salad. So the ingredients were baby kale , herb roasted Brussel sprouts, romaine, fresh blueberries, sweet red grapes, dried cranberries, goat cheese, cucumbers, candied pecans, toasted pepitas, red onions and strawberry vinaigrette. Well, no romaine, no pecans, no pepitas??? Keith the manager was very apologetic and thanked me for bringing it to his attention. Compensated me for the trouble, although I wasn't looking for anything it was kind of him to do so. I just wanted them to know so the salad could be right for next guest. And our server Ryan, ROCKED! I will definitely be back again!  Four star from me!"
Mallory S.,"Dayton, OH",1,17,13,3.0,5/18/2017,"It's a chain, so you kind of know what you're getting.  We've eaten at BJ's on numerous occasions, and I've always been pretty satisfied with the food itself, from pizzas to sandwiches, and of course the pizookies are delicious.  (They do display the calorie count, which is good and bad - I'm not sure I want to know how many calories are actually in their desserts!)   On our most recent trip, I had the shrimp tacos with chips and salsa and my husband had the California Chicken Club with sweet potato fries.  Both meals were good - nothing out of this world, but certainly good. However, it was s-l-o-w.  Yes, it was semi-crowded, but we were probably there for over an hour and a half, which seemed a bit too long.  Our server was pleasant, which was nice, but if I'm going to spend that much time at a restaurant, I want it to be worth it! If you're in the mood for a chain with above average food and a vast menu, I'd recommend BJ's.  However, you're not going to find a lot of ambiance or originality."
Abby S.,"Milpitas, CA",0,5,,5.0,10/23/2017,"Ate here Oct 2017, party of 1, around 3pm on a Monday.  The bar area tables were full, it was moderately busy for that time of day.  I wish, I knew the name of my waitress, but I have forgotten it.  I was short on time, she was very accommodating.  I ordered salmon, which was amazing!  The flavor and crunchy consistency of the outside was different and awesome!  My sides arrived, and they were not thoroughly heated.  I only mentioned it to the restaurant so they could fix the problem for future guests.  The manager responded and apologized for their mistake.  Although, I did not request, or expect any discount for my inconvenience, I was amply credited for this inconvenience.  I hope to visit this restaurant again in the future.  My service and food was great!"
Adam L.,"Middletown, OH",12,135,114,4.0,7/26/2016,"Love BJ's, but sometimes the service is great and sometimes it's just okay. The same goes with the food, sometimes it's excellent and other times it's just good. These inconsistencies are what disappoint me because on their good days I love the place. On their bad days, I wish I'd gone across the parking lot to Chipotle or Panara. One tip - if you like soda, try their house made ones. They are excellent."
A D.,"Springfield, OH",0,11,,5.0,8/17/2017,"We had never been to BJ's, but we came here yesterday around 6 or so, after being totally ignored by waitstaff across the street at Caddy's (Caddy's was NOT busy at all).  BJ's was jumping, and we wondered if we were making a mistake by going there when they were that busy - but, we were greeted warmly at the door and greeted at the bar with a smile. The bartender at BJ's was friendly and helpful when we asked him about some of their craft beers. As busy as they were, the service was excellent and efficient. The drinks and beers were delicious. The appetizer we ordered was huge & very tasty. The food and drinks were reasonably priced. Most of all, BJ's is very customer-service driven - they know how to treat a customer. WE WILL BE BACK!"
Darrelle T.,"Dayton, OH",0,10,,5.0,8/14/2017,Some people need to really chill out about these damn reviews. Who goes here for the food? Come here for the brews. Get off your damn high horse and try the local drinks.
Amanda A.,"Baraboo, WI",28,3,,5.0,8/7/2017,"This was a fantastic family friendly place.  The waitress, Shannon, was nothing less then amazing!  She was happy and so helpful.  In addition, the food came out so fast that I made several comments.  Overall an amazing experience at a change restaurant."
Christopher C.,"Dayton, OH",0,7,2,1.0,5/20/2017,"1st visit.  I asked for a sample of beer and was literally brought enough to stick your tongue in. Not even a table spoon. Was told that they only give small samples for non company branded beer. I rolled my eyes and moved on-I kinda get it.  2nd  visit.  Asked for a sample of their craft beer and was brought nothing short of spittle (less than 1/2 tablespoon) in the glass. I'm shocked. I'm not exaggerating. This is marketed as a craft brew house but you can't even sample a beer. Again, I move on and chaulk it up to corporate greed and a company ""not getting it"".  Then my bill comes and I'm actually charged .05 cents for my 1/2 teaspoon of a sample of beer. Are you F-ing kidding me? That's it. I very politely told the waitress that the food and her service were great and that it would be reflected in her tip but that I'm not paying the .05 cents for the spittle.  Well, the manager then comes out, as he should, and I tell him great food, great service, horrible marketing and customer service with their beer (very politely). He had knocked off the 0.5 cents but said that it is illegal in Ohio to not charge for alcohol. I told him that I would be happy to pay .25-.50 cents per sample. If in fact, I got a sample (shot glass) size. We had a cordial discussion and in short, his eyes glazed over at my comments. The fact is, according to his comments, he broke the law for paying my .05 cents.  I have never ever been charged for a sample of beer anywhere in Ohio. Only at BJs Brewhouse and for literally spittle.  IN SHORT So, if you like craft brews, move on to another brew house. This is not the place for you.  Side Note: I'm going back next week to get a picture of the sample and show you the 0.5 cent charge (It's the only thing I will get). I'll share another review then with pictures on the experience.  My guess is it will be ""3 strikes your out""."
Judy G.,"Dayton, OH",18,12,2,4.0,7/7/2017,This is an excellent choice when taking a group/family out and need a great selection. I've tried many items from the menu/bar and have never been disappointed.  Enjoy!
Harrison G.,"Hillsboro, OH",160,275,44,5.0,6/20/2017,Great restaurant with good food and the staff is very friendly and the Salad is really good. They also have really good Ice cream and cookies
Ellie D.,"Dayton, OH",0,67,1,5.0,6/13/2017,"My whole family loves this place. The sriracha brussel sprouts are great!  They have a tasty steak dinner as well, always cooked exactly as it should be . I've also had their chicken tortilla soup, salads and burgers.  Everything is wonderful there are no complaints from me!  We like sitting on their beautiful patio and enjoying a flavored soda water on a warm day.  Perception!"
Kelly A.,"Longs, SC",99,53,2,3.0,5/4/2017,"Stopped here first time and had clam chowder and grilled cheese. Very yum and the hot cookie sampler at the end was Amazing! Service was ok, not great and floor was really slippery which I hate. Food was decent though but overpriced."
Ted C.,"Englewood, OH",0,6,,1.0,7/2/2017,Been here over an hour and just got our food. Food was good but not outstanding.  Server was good but now has vanished.  Won't be back.
Joanna H.,"Cleveland, TN",29,7,2,3.0,6/15/2017,"I usually love BJ's, but this one was disappointing. Service was somewhere between slow and nonexistent, but the server was lovely when we saw her. I think she just had way too many tables. The hostess was, um, hostile? She snapped at me when I asked a question. Food was okay - I had the watermelon feta salad and it wasn't what I expected - 3-4 pieces of watermelon, no mint.... the artichokes were overcooked. Just disappointing."
Justin F.,"Dayton, OH",54,57,16,5.0,8/1/2016,"Went here with some of my colleagues from work. The service was great, the beer was good, and food was fast! They have a wide variety of food for whatever you're craving! Steak, seafood, pasta, pizza, soups, salads, and lots of appetizers! The same goes for theirs house craft beers as well!"
Joel C.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,75,50,2.0,10/29/2016,"A mediocre place to go get food. I went there with a group of friends and we had called in advance to make a reservation, and they had told us that they don't do reservations. But when we showed up in advance, they asked if we had a reservation, and all we could do is laugh. Then the hostess told us that our table would be ready in a minute, but then they decided to give it away to another group. The beer here is average, nothing new or that makes it stand out from the rest. The food, depending on what you order, is bland. It also took us two attempts to flag down the waitress to get silverware and napkins AFTER she dropped off the food."
Sharon C.,"Dayton, OH",0,11,5,4.0,4/27/2016,Food was fresh made!!! I had the baked ravioli.  The problem was the ravioli was too large.  It was not easy to cut or get pieces that fit on my fork.  They were layered on top of each other like pancakes which add to the problem. My mother had the country fried steak.  Her mash potatoes were creamy this a major plus.  The country fried steak was fried incorrectly.  Veggies were fresh made but gravy was not a gravy more of an glaze. The baked beignet was perfect.
Chad W.,"Fort Collins, CO",0,9,,4.0,9/2/2017,"Good American fare. They have a set of their own brand beers along with a small set of other craft beers. I was personally disappointed when they recently changed the recipes on several menu items like the Salmon Quinoa Bowl, but perhaps other people like the new versions. One downside is that it's often busy, so we typically eat at the bar or in the bar area to avoid the line for a table."
Kirsten J.,"Dayton, OH",10,25,15,1.0,3/6/2017,"My family and went there tonight for my husband's birthday.   The soup I ordered was only luke warm when it arrived at the table so I send it back to the kitchen.  Instead of just simply giving me a fresh bowl the kitchen microwaved my soup to a boiling point that burned my tongue.  Btw: It was the manager who brought me the ""so called fresh bowl of soup"".   When I approached the waitress about it she confirmed that the soup had been indeed microwaved.  I was so frustrated at this point that i just send it back.   I then approached the manager about it and all he said was: ""Well you don't have to pay for your soup then.""  I told him that it is ridiculous having a whole fleet of cooks in the kitchen and having them microwaving the food.  No restaurant should ever do that and that I would not have paid for my soup anyway since I didn't consume it.  He basically shrugged it off.  He later stopped by our table and offered me a cake which I declined.  I believe he saw me typing up a complaint to corporate.  Another downer we had was that my daughters order arrived wrong. She and her husband ordered pizza half vegetarian.  It came with all meet but was replaced.  My husband's order - don't forget it was his birthday- arrived way after all of us got our food. I would not recommend BJ's in Beavercreek.  Spend your money someplace else."
Jan M.,"Fairborn, OH",2,5,2,2.0,6/28/2016,"We love eating at BJ's and have been to locations from Temecula, CA to Columbus, OH. We have always had good food and service. Wifi is a good addition.  Sadly our experience at the Beavercreek, OH was our first disappointment. Our silverware was dirty.  Food wasn't as described on the menu. Our waitress was very kind and helpful, but it wasn't a good experience. The manager came by to defend the food we were served, but we left unsatisfied. We will skip this location but will continue to go to other BJ's."
