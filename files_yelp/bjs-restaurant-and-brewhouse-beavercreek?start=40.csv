Will L.,"Bedford, OH",41,73,15,4.0,8/27/2016,"Frankly a nice brew house.  There are a ton of taps to try and if you want the adventure of trying a beer you dont usually see, they brew about 12 of their own.  I was able to sample three of the beers they brew in house and they were not disappointing. The bar is nice and busy, but the service did not disappoint.  The bartenders are attentive and beer knowledgable.   We grabbed a deep dish pizza to snack on while we had a few beers and its was as good of a deep dish pizza as you could hope for.  The only deficit was upon our leaving, there was a large line waiting on tables.  Thus, I suggest an early or late arrival and try to skip the dinner crowd.  A great happy hour experience with some food."
Lynn W.,"Dayton, OH",19,14,3,4.0,3/17/2017,"We always take advantage of the phone ahead seating as it is rare to go and not find a line. It's rare to find a parking spot!  I love the menu, it is packed full of variety. I even tried the Brussel sprouts and would order them again. If they could just figure out how to get my food out to me hotter I would give them 5 stars."
Anton B.,"Dayton, OH",0,6,26,2.0,3/13/2017,Not off to a very good start. We ordered brussel sprouts that came out burnt and way way too salty and calamari that had no seasoning.  We ordered vodka and club soda and my wife ordered vodka and club soda with Monin raspberry puree that is in one of their mocktails. They charged her $3 extra for the squirt of syrup.  The manager of a little then made of steel uncomfortable about the whole situation and finally remove the extra $3 from the check and then told us if we ordered it differently the next time we would have gotten it for free. The club flat bread was delicious however. Maybe we'll wait a few weeks till they finish with training before going back
Stephanie D.,"Doral, FL",20,1,,1.0,12/26/2016,I was very disappointed with the service. The waitress disappeared regularly and didn't bring plates for appetizers when asked. Took an extremely long time to get beers and waited for probably 15 minutes to get our last round. The reason we got the last round was because they never brought our 4 year old child her meal and she had to wait 20 or more minutes for it to come. We contested the bill for only the kids meal which they did take off but a visit by the manager would have been nice. He walked right by us without a glance. Truly disappointed.
Montana W.,"Beavercreek, OH",10,72,17,5.0,1/18/2017,"Really nothing to complain about here. Beer selection is good and the beers ARE good. Every bit of food I tried (brisket bacon burger, stuffed mushrooms, sriracha queso, and toasted marshmallow pizza brownie thing) was wonderful. Service inside was great and 'to go' orders were correct and very efficient. Highly recommend."
Andrew R.,"Independence, KY",0,17,,5.0,3/6/2017,"My fiancé and I tried this place for a date night after catching a movie and we both loved it! We have become regular customers and trying new entrees each time we go. Their menu is extensive so there are plenty of options for everyone! So far I've tried their burgers, pizza, spaghetti, and tacos and they are all delicious! I highly recommend this spot for anyone wanting good food at fair pricing. It's not cheap but it's worth it!"
Lainee H.,"Springfield, OH",0,5,,5.0,8/6/2017,"This is the best restaurant in this area, they have a great food selection along with great drinks. The atmosphere of the place is great. Pizza, burgers, salads to even the appetizers nothings nothing that you won't like. It's a great family restaurant."
David R.,"Dayton, OH",0,85,18,4.0,12/9/2016,"This place has been packed since opening, reservations needed if you want a table without the wait, bar is lively and bar area tables rock! Great beer selection, food will not disappoint, nice interior."
Valorie M.,"Washington Court House, OH",0,1,2,2.0,4/23/2016,Our server was GREAT however the food not so much. I ordered a steak cooked medium and it came out black and dry. My husband had the bacon mac and cheese. He ate nothing but the small pieces of broccoli that was in the dish and left the rest. I will say their soup and salad was amazing!!! We will only come back for that if we come back at all.
Linda H.,"Dayton, OH",0,6,,2.0,8/19/2017,"Have been to BJ's many times and always was a good experience ... however, not so on Friday evening.  We brought friends here from out of town & was so disappointed in the experience.  Arrived at 4:30pm (before the Friday night crowds start to arrive) and found the restrooms to be in very bad condition ~ I told the manager & they said they would get someone to clean them up (?!?)  The mushroom appetizer was good, but the flatbread was ordered (dry, no flavor and seemed it was possibly reheated ??)   The Brussels sprouts were sent back (overdone) and several other items were cold when served.  At that point, we didn't send anything back, ate what we could & left.   I doubt I will be going there again anytime soon.  The trio Pizookie was the only thing that saved the night .......  Linda Hausfeld"
Jenni L.,"Grand Forks, ND",0,9,,5.0,5/29/2016,"Ask to be seated with Rebekah V if you can. Super sweet girl and very friendly. On to the review... I got a deep dish pizza: good, my husband got Fish tacos: good, my son got kids cheeseburgers: awesome.  BEST part was the Pizookie Trio. If I could eat 5 of the chocolate chunk Pizookies, I would! Come here, leave full and happy... And a little heavier. ;)"
Elle J.,"Jamestown, OH",0,18,9,4.0,7/2/2017,"Food is typically always good, as is the service. Conveniently located in the mall parking lot. Have eaten there several times without being disappointed."
Joe N.,"Dayton, OH",11,92,216,2.0,4/4/2016,"My husband and I along with another couple visited this location recently on a Saturday afternoon; we were not impressed with the food but were greatly satisfied with the staff.  The quality of the food we received was definitely not the quality that the Tuttle mall location churns out; We used to live right by the Tuttle location and LOVED LOVED LOVED going there so now that we live here we were excited to know that we again lived close to one. We ordered the siracha queso dip with tortilla chips: queso was luke warm and the chip basket had oil all over it so the chips on the bottom were oil-caked and somewhat soggy. The queso dip was an odd consistency, not what we expected for queso dip.  Avocado egg rolls; these were probably the most horrible things that I have ever tasted.. it did not appear nor taste like it was advertised on the menu. It literally tasted like someone put an avocado in a piece of soggy bread with some red pepper flakes. I remember eating something similar at the Tuttle location and they were PHENOMENAL. Deep dish pizza; this was not horrible nor delicious.. if you are going here, getting a pizza is a safe bet. We got the roasted rep pepper, pepperoni, and sausage one. The other couple got the burger that has shredded beef on it (forget the name)-- he had to dig through it to make sure there was a burger, it looked more like a sloppy joe. It was served with the bun slid halfway off and orange oil bubbles in the condensation on the plate.  Pizookie(sp?); these are very good and I would recommend these for dessert. I got the white chocolate chip macadamia. Staff-Our server was Brittany who was absolutely wonderful. She was very attentive and quick to get what we needed! Ask for Brittany if you come here. If management reads these, please recognize Brittany. There was also a manager (didnt catch his name) who was actively working just as hard as his staff. That also tells a lot about the staff and their support system. He was a man who appeared to be middle aged and he had an olive skin tone.  We aren 't ones to raise heck in restaurants about our food. We expect it to be done correctly the first time. We typically just review the place until we get the impression that the issues have been fixed. We do not plan to revisit this location until we are confident that the food is of higher quality."
Ryan V.,"Vandalia, OH",17,14,,4.0,10/25/2016,"This is my favorite restaurant around, I enjoy the environment, you can make reservations, and I love how if your waiting they'll txt when your tables is ready. The food is good I like how they have low calorie meals with good flavor."
Michael G.,"Beckley, WV",0,4,,3.0,2/12/2017,Generic chain oriented experience. Service is unreliable and can vary dramatically from one server to the next. Food reflects the aforementioned description of the service. Beer is subpar for the price and what other options are in the area. I suggest visiting Yellow Springs Brewery either before or after your meal rather than buying drinks at BJs.
Bethany B.,"Dayton, OH",63,44,81,5.0,4/9/2016,"BJs Restaurant & Brewhouse..... Yes! BJs has a huge menu with dishes that can satisfy the pickiest of pallets. Dishes range from festive salads, flaky crust pizzas, to savory pastas. Don't forget the brew! The restaurant and the bar are casually sophisticated. The Brewhouse style bar offers domestic and IPAs. So definitely be sure to drop your waiter information about what your particular tastes are in terms of  beer/ale. Our waiter Otis was knowledgeable of not only the cuisine but the drink menu as well. He did a phenomenal job at deciphering what we would enjoy from their selection. Service was impeccable and guess what ... I think this will be my new favorite dine in get away !  Hats off BJs .... We WILL most definitely be back !!!"
Becka L.,"Dayton, OH",1,9,,4.0,2/4/2017,I love this particular restaurant. The waitstaff is always very attentive and the curbside is always fast.  I come here a lot and I think the curbside folks know me by now lol! The only down tick I can give it is that I ordered the chili as part of my curbside order today 4 February and they didn't secure the lid. Everything in that bag was covered in chili. I'm just happy it didn't end up all over my vehicle. And sometimes they forget to add a condiment but that's not a huge deal.  Just double check the lids!!! Great place and awesome food
Carrie A.,"Fairborn, OH",43,103,178,5.0,3/29/2016,"Hubby and I went to BJ's for the first time this afternoon.  I had looked ahead to the allergy menu and emailed corporate.  I got a response from corporate within a week. :)  So, before I even went there, great customer service. We decided to get at like 4:00 and hit happy hour.  The bar was BUSY, but the seating area wasn't.  Our waitress was incredible.  Rebekah V was amazing.  She knew the menu, knew the specials, and got immediately that Hubby and I are a bit of foodies.  We started with the Ahi Poke appetizer and couldn't have been more impressed. The flavor and method used were amazing.  So then hubby ordered the fried chicken and I ordered a burger.  While we didn't order the most challenging to cook menu item, they were cooked amazing.   My medium burger was dripping with juices and his chicken was amazingly tender.  It was so good I realized halfway through the meal that we didn't take any pictures.  We did take pictures of Hubby's dessert though - BJ's Baked Beignet.  Oh, and don't skip the handcrafted sodas with free refills.  Hubby and I loved the cream soda! On a more side note, Hubby says ""I like BJ's."""
Jim M.,"Ypsilanti, MI",56,208,32,3.0,10/3/2016,"My hotel was in the same parking lot as BJB's, and so I decided to walk over so I could try the beers guilt free!  Of course, the pleasant coincidence of being able to smoke a cigar on my walk back was just that.  I had a short wait, as BJB is a popular chain brewhouse, with it's own beers that are brewed regionally, as well as offering local brews on tap.  But I also had to wait just to get my drink order in, and not just a minute or two.  I eventually tried a local beer from Mad Tree, the PSA (Proper Session Ale), and went with the Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms for an appetizer.  The mushrooms were nicely sliced thick, but a little lightly cooked, which was better than overcooked.  The PSA was excellent, and I'll make a point top try another Mad Tree brew sometime.  I decided to go with a make-your-own pizza, and even though you can only do this with the deep dish crusts, I opted for my ""pizza la soleto"": pepperoni and onion.  I ordered a BJ's Piranha Pale Ale while I waited, and it was very good.  The 9"" pizza is a lot for one person, but I persevered, as the crust - which they promoted as ""lighter, bakery-style crust"" - was unique.  It took me a few minutes to realize that it reminded me of a donut, but savory!  A little too much sauce, but at least not smothered in cheese.  I wouldn't have minded a spicier pepperoni, and more of it.  The service was good, but a little slow; not due to lack of effort, but more barbecue it was crowded.  I enjoyed BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse, and I wouldn't hesitate to stop at one again.  I would say you wouldn't be wrong in stopping by."
B H.,"Butler County, OH",228,212,589,4.0,1/31/2016,The pizza here was a little salty!!!  But other than that the salmon dinner was delicious and the service and beer were fantastic!
