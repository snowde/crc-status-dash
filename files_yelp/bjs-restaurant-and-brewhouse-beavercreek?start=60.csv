Rebecca D.,"Dayton, OH",0,7,1,5.0,12/6/2016,Just had the best French dip. And the snickerdoodle pizzokie is to die for. I'll be back in a few days to have another one for my birthday. This time I'm not sharing.
Larry L.,"Zanesville, OH",0,14,57,4.0,2/7/2016,"This spot has been open about a week.   Despite the newness,  the service was good.  Our food arrived quickly and was cooked appropriately.  The only complaint is that the menu  is too long.  You may want to look online prior to your arrival and make some choices.  In fact I think you  can order online with their app."
Shiloh C.,"Dayton, OH",25,32,263,5.0,2/10/2016,Great place.  wow the menu!.  I will tell you it is hard to pick the dish you want for dinner.  Very huge menu.  Customer service was good.  Only thing was it took 15 min for second round of beer.  Other than that great experience!
Michael R.,"Downtown, Columbus, OH",6,1,,1.0,10/1/2016,One star for poor management. Waited an hour to be seated and we had to remind the hostess that we were on the waiting list. Waited over an hour and a half for our meals. Meals came to the table after probably spending some time under a heat lamp. Disappointing
M L.,"Dayton, OH",0,3,3,1.0,7/26/2016,"I must say that the time our party spent at the Beavercreek location of BJ's Restaurant & Brewery was by far a nightmare! For the majority of us, it was our first time ever at a BJ's and I guarantee none of us will be back!! We had a table of 10 for a birthday celebration. Not only a large party for a special occasion, but the table was even RESERVED. There was a small wait on the table upon arrival and the host staff graciously took care of the birthday cake that was brought in by our party. We were seated at our table and that is when the terror began.  Our server took everyone's drink order and not once did she promote any of the BJ's beers on tap or bother to mention what beer there was to offer. The mixed drinks were absurdly overpriced for the quality of liquor and taste that came with it. We waited for a good 25 or so minutes before she returned to the table for our food order.  With all the free time we had waiting on our server to acknowledge her biggest party, we all discovered the offer presented by our Yelp accounts. I have posted screen shots of the coupon that came directly from the BJ's Brewery website so that those reading can see that it fails to mention anywhere that ONLY BJ's Brewery members can use the coupon OR that the coupon can only be used once PER TABLE. Laughably so, no one in their right mind would use such a hasty coupon for such a slapstick restaurant.  When our server finally found our table again and realized we had not placed orders yet, she approached us with an overwhelming ""whatever"" attitude and immediately started arguing about the coupon. Coming from someone who has a decade of customer service experience - you NEVER tell the customer they are wrong; especially when the fine print is bright and clear with its guidelines. After thoroughly pissing off the entire table with her bad attitude and taking another 20 minutes just to take our orders, she had the audacity to send her extremely rude manager over. Not once did she apologize for the misunderstanding, confusion, or even offer to comp the coupon for our table. I can understand why she did not apologize for the misunderstanding because there wasn't one arguable. The manager quickly realized that she had angered our entire table and that we were not satisfied with her answer. The best thing she did for us was walk away without a care. Not sure what was such a big deal about honoring one of their own coupons for a 10 top table that was ordering appetizers, entrees, and alcoholic beverages. They were making quite the pretty penny off of us and making my friends birthday celebration into a very sour dining experience for everyone. The food. What is wrong with the food? Nearly every order came out completely wrong! Whether it was burgers undercooked, side items misplaced on the wrong plates, sauces specifically requested to be removed still there, and just down right wrong altogether. Half the table ended up having to send their food back for it to be ""fixed"". However, we did not know that the staff couldn't fix how awfully disgusting all of the food tasted! I ordered the chargrilled mahi mahi and broiled shrimp tacos. The only decent item of my entree was the salsa that came with the chips. I have never had a fish taco that tasted like burnt cardboard or shrimp so hard I couldn't bite into it! It is very clear BJ's uses a selection of frozen seafood and that their kitchen staff ruins any chance of it ever tasting halfway  edible. Several remarks were made to our waitress about the quality of the food and she collected the plates without any response to a single word that was being said to her.   Alas, two hours of hell later, the birthday cake was finally brought to our table. Thankfully it was made by a local bakery rather than coming from the BJ's Brewery kitchen or I might not have survived to write this review! To put the icing on the cake, it was brought out quickly and we were left without a staff member assigned to us. I question, how does a party serve a cake without plates or silverware? Naturally, we had to wait to grab our servers attention again to make that request. I assume you might have to be a BJ's Brewery member to get that kind of common service..  To end on this distasteful event, the majority of the checks of our party were wrong and were ever so slowly fixed. I feel embarrassed and absolutely ashamed for the owners of this franchise to have such a horrible and unmindful staff to be running their newly opened restaurant. It's only a matter of time before another franchise takes over this location. Hopefully with better service and food."
Josie J.,"Cincinnati, OH",43,53,6,2.0,12/13/2016,"Very limited seating. Waited about 1.5 hours for a table of 7. Always very packed, bad thing is you can't make a reservation and have to wait if they get busy. It's very loud. Wouldn't recommend for family with small kids. Plus it's cold in the building."
Megan M.,"New Carlisle, OH",1,22,41,4.0,3/17/2016,"We were pretty excited when this place opened and had to try it. Definitely join their brewhouse club so you get faster seating! The inside is what you would expect and brewhouse to look like, there was a bar area with TV's for sports. The menu is massive: like seriously you can just about get anything here I ordered the deep dish ravioli, which was pretty good. For dessert we ordered the pazookies, which were AMAZING! Get the cookies n cream, you won't regret it! Service was a little slow and our server didn't seem to know what she was doing, but that could be just because they recently opened. Overall, I will try it again"
Scott M.,"Evans, GA",0,24,,3.0,4/17/2017,"Food was decent - fried artichoke app and piggy flatbread pizza. Flight of beer - not so good. Had a range, from blonde to porter. Didn't like any of them, sadly"
Kelly K.,"Falls Church, VA",76,15,13,4.0,7/2/2016,Great for a group. Lots of different food options to please every picky eater. I also am not normally a veggie burger person but was looking for a healthy option to not undo my gym workout--- WOW this was a guilt free tasty option.  Will definitely get again. I am a meat eater and junk food person and I did not feel like I was missing  a thing or eating a froo -frooo burger. Staff is attentive and centrally located for the area
Daniel L.,"Clayton, OH",1,38,,3.0,5/2/2016,We were a couple months ago and they sat us in front.  We come back today and they sat us up front again.  Food is good but hate where they seat us.
CM L.,"Xenia, OH",0,11,15,1.0,7/3/2016,This was the second time for this new location. We have been to several BJ's in the Columbus area as well as the newer one south of Dayton. For only being open since this early spring I am a little surprised that the management is so poor in an area that has so much restaurant competition. The service was slow and the silverware was filthy. Good luck making it in this area with all of the other choices around. We probably won't be back here at the Beavercreek location.
Tom L.,"Dayton, OH",0,5,18,5.0,1/30/2016,"Went there for the ""pre-opening"" training week.  Was excellent food and the staff was friendly and we'll trained. Would recommend it."
Reema S.,"Dayton, OH",0,1,,3.0,1/27/2017,"The service was good, the food was ok. Standard chain food- maybe a step above cheesecake factory. The pizookies and house sodas are amazing."
Eric L.,"Beavercreek, OH",36,10,1,2.0,3/28/2016,Did not really care for it. Our service was great. Our server kept fresh drinks going. But something happened with our order things were mixed up as we had someone else deliver the food. We tried the deep dish pizza and it was too bready and the toppings were so so.
Greg C.,"Germantown, OH",22,26,32,5.0,6/7/2016,BJ's in Beavercreek is definitely not like others. The staff is very friendly and outstanding. I have been to another one down at Austin pike and the service was slow and didn't compare to the Beavercreek BJ's. As for the food it is very much worth going. Have had numerous items and all where outstanding. Beer and drink selection is like no other. Tip us to ask your server and they can help you. Another tip is to use the app and get on the preferred wait list. It tells you about how long the wait is so you know when to arrive. This place is a must try
Dennis P.,"Chicago, IL",0,5,,5.0,7/11/2016,Very good food and drinks. Menu has a good variety. I enjoy that they have smaller portioned items.  Service is good usually very good. Will definitely keep going back!
Mike N.,"Cleveland Heights, OH",58,629,2,4.0,3/21/2016,"I was staying the area for a meeting and was able to visit here for lunch as well as a late night snack.  Lunch menu, with several moderately priced sandwiches and pizzas.  Prepared well.  The dinner and late night menu also has a nice variety of sandwiches, tacos and entrees.  A bit above typical pub chow.  Then there are the beers.  I am not a big beer fan, but must admit I found some that I really liked.  Many are micro brews made locally, as well as national and international brands.  Service was very good.  This place can be very busy during the day, but worth a visit."
Mike M.,"Riverside, OH",0,10,,2.0,10/20/2016,"Your typical American style chain restaurant with locations around the U.S.  This evening I had the BBQ Bison burger and my friend had the shrimp arugala pita tacos.  Service was a little slow and minimally attentive though polite and friendly.  When my burger arrived the fries were cold and soggy like my plate had waited awhile before being brought out, the server replaced the fries quickly and finally brought some ketchup. I dug into my burger and was let down. It had okay flavor but the bun seemed stale or like it had sat under a warming lamp for a bit too long and  it was fairly greasy and crumbly.  My friend puts it on par with an Applebees. There are better choices in the area in my opinion."
B A.,"Dayton, OH",0,22,2,2.0,5/11/2016,"Wanted to love BJ's. My husband is traveling for several days a week so I decided to use BJ's as my solo woman dinner spot. The first time I ordered a to go platter it was perfect. My second visit was a dine-in with my husband and it was incredible. Our server, Alisha was top notch! So it is with great sadness I have to leave a bad review. I have ordered carside service five times in the last two-three weeks and four times it has been completely wrong! I am very specific when I order, the server on the phone always repeats back to me what I ordered, and it is correct. However, I receive my food and it's wrong each time. How many times can the kitchen manager apologize, and how many emailed gift certificates do I have to receive before the kitchen staff is either reprimanded or replaced???  The last straw was yesterday. I called in from 20 minutes away, got there to pick up my food only to be told it was cooked wrong and they were ""fixing it"" and it would only be ""five more minutes"". I went inside and spoke to the kitchen manager AGAIN, who stated technically the order wasn't wrong because they caught the error before it got to me....DUHHH!!! It did not register with him that I was still inconvenienced because of the additional wait time. Finally my food was there, I checked the bag and the vegetables that are SUPPOSED to come with the meal were missing! Kitchen manager went to the back and brought them out for me with no apology.  The kicker? I get home and eat this stuff and two hours later I am sicker than I have ever been. I was severely nauseous, and had what seemed to be stomach distension and diarrhea that is still ongoing. I don't want to state the obvious, but the timing of this ""illness"" is curious, especially since I do not usually get ill like this. Needless to say BJ's Brewhouse is a distant memory and I am sure one customer won't break them, but I always like to say...buyer beware....or in this case, diner beware. I wanted to love you BJs!!!"
Dustin B.,"Montgomery Village, MD",0,24,,5.0,5/5/2016,"This BJ'S is pretty good!  Great food and awesome beers!  I have never been dissatisfied here!  Average meal price... $40-50 for family of 4.  Wait time is comparable to similar restaurants, but the app can help you get ""in line"" before you actually get there."
