David L.,"Vandalia, OH",7,18,21,3.0,2/20/2016,"They told us that we would receive a text when our table was ready. After an hour,  we checked in and they told us that A text had been sent. We did not receive it. The text arrived 10 minutes after we were seated. We waited about 15 minutes for our food and mine was cold. They were very nice about reheating it and returned it quickly. The manager checked on us. We waited too long for our dessert and longer yet for our bill. The food was terrific but they seem totally overwhelmed and underprepared. We will probably go back but it will be a while."
Debbe T.,"Dayton, OH",55,139,20,5.0,2/6/2016,"I have a certain preconceived idea of any place that calls itself a brewhouse.  I expect a primary focus on beer and noise.  I was pleasantly surprised.  They have a well-stocked bar with a interesting mixed drink menu.  I had a Pink Cadillac and a Cosmo.  At the time we went, the place was busy but because of the layout the noise level is minimized.  Now for the food.  I had the jalapeno burger.  It was delicious and came with large portion of shoestring fries.  I couldn't eat the entire sandwich so it came with me.  My husband had a cup of chili and a grilled cheese with two different types of cheese.  He was very pleased with his meal.  The service was great.  They were extremely professional, efficient, and friendly.  I highly recommend this place and will definitely make a return visit."
Heather K.,"Tampa, FL",81,42,1,5.0,3/12/2016,I always have so much fun here. Great menus for vegetarians and they also have some unique food. Great prices and delicious bloody Mary's! You can even buy growlers here full of your favorite beers!
Sue B.,"Dayton, OH",39,3,,2.0,5/14/2016,Service slow. Brought drinks after apps. Asked for flavor for hot by time the flavor got there was cold. No manager checked on us. No refills
Jackie O.,"Dayton, OH",0,34,35,4.0,5/7/2016,BJ's has a big menu. Surely something for everyone. Quick tip: bar area is seat yourself instead of waiting. Yes they brew their own and tend to favor it; but it would be nice if the staff could learn what else is available. The Mediterranean chicken pitas and pizookies are the bomb!
Matt S.,"Lima, OH",39,15,4,5.0,2/13/2016,"Amazing experience from check-in to the end of the meal! Love that they have an app for early reservations, ordering, payment, and rewards! All around an awesome restaurant! Family had the pizza and I had a burger with brisket and bacon!"
Audrey T.,"Dayton, OH",55,33,,4.0,7/31/2016,Try the flat bread pizza its amazing combined with the app which lets you save 20% :)
Christy W.,"Quebec City, Canada",0,2,,3.0,10/1/2016,The food was good but service was weak. Went in on a Thursday at 6pm. Restaurant wast 2/3 full and we had to wait 10 minutes for a table? Then once seated we waited more than 10 minutes for any attention. Folks behind us seated and waited on immediately. They kept offering free appetizers and deserts but bill was not adjusted. Just unprofessional service.
Erin S.,"Dayton, OH",184,13,,3.0,9/5/2016,"I went to bjs brewhouse last night for dinner. When I got there the host asked if we wanted to sit in open seating by the bar and there was a booth available and we said yes and walked up there. The two booths were dirty and covered in old dishes from the previous table. I'm not sure why she would offer us to sit there when the tables weren't clean. This was a trend throughout the night. It seems the servers had no intentions of busing the tables because the table next to us was dirty the whole time we were there and many other around. Our server was nice. She asked for our drinks but it took 10-15 min to get them. All the food was excellent. We got the chicken potsticker appetizers and split the Mediterranean tacos and crispy jalapeño burger. The sides were the crispy thin fries and Brussels sprouts. We loved the food! It was great! We also decided to order a flight of the famous brewhouse beers. We each got our own consisting of 4 beers 5oz each for 6.95. I thought this was a fair price and a great idea. You could choose from any beers on tap. I orders the blonde ale, the piranha pale ale, the takonic (no idea if this is proper spelling) stout, and the berry burst cider. The server took both of our flight orders without writing anything down. When the server set the beers down she named all the ones I order except the piranha beer she called it oasis and I asked her if it was the piranha and she  said she would check. She came back and said yes it was. I know this was not a mistake because she deals with theses beers all the time and my boyfriend and I try lots of different beers as well. The beer was too dark to be a pale ale, it looked more like an amber and on top of that my boyfriend ordered the piranha as well and they looks and tastes completely different. Then when we got the check she rang in the oasis! So she knew she gave me the wrong beer and just didn't wanna feel like getting the right one and she lied. I would have been happy to drink it if she admitted her mistake I would have said it was okay. But she lied to my face and insulted my intelligence. So as far as choosing this place for your dinner tonight.. If you are looking for great good then defiantly ! As long as you don't mind bad service."
Katie L.,"Pensacola, FL",18,12,3,2.0,3/14/2016,"This place is def new. Twice now we've been there way longer than we should have been, twice now have we had a manager come and apologize for something that happened, but they didn't DO anything. The first time a cook forgot to cook our order. We were waiting for a while before our waitress caught it, manager came and apologized and that was it. Tonight I was served a RAW bison burger. It was brown on the outsides but inside was mushy, red, and COLD! The first burger came out w nothing but pico bbq and the bun. The second burger came out way over cooked, over seasoned, covered in lettuce and onions. Also, it had a sauce that wasn't on the other.  Our waitress tonight was super slow too. We had to ask for refills, asked for my margarita from the bar, took almost 2 hrs to get our food, pay and leave!  When I finally got my margarita it was way watered down and Had clearly been sitting there for a while. It's a cool place to grab some drinks w friends. I think my husband and I will wait a little while before going back there again, unfortunately. Cooks, step up your game. Managers, ""I'm sorry"" can only get ya so far in the restaurant business"
Leigh R.,"Dayton, OH",0,9,,4.0,7/3/2016,"We had a BJ's when we lived in Vegas, so finding one here in Beavercreek was exciting.  Their deep dish pizza is always delicious.  My boys (Ages 6 &7) love the happy face fries.  We ate there for a birthday lunch today and the overall experience was tops.  Good service, good food, free Wi-Fi, and sports on the screens.  We'll be back regularly!  One negative - their silverware is HUGE and they don't seem to have smaller scale utensils for kids.  My son's mac & cheese came with a spoon the size of a normal serving spoon.  So if you have kids, just take the time to pack the kids utensils with you."
Lori A.,"Fairborn, OH",0,17,2,5.0,6/13/2016,"Sort of a new chain restaurant in the area. It's fun for a nice night out, with a date or a nice dinner for special occasions. Good food. But better adult beverage selection. Our waitress was super friendly and so helpful last time we went. Expect to pay a little more but good atmosphere, service and food make it worth going."
Allison H.,"Dayton, OH",0,6,,4.0,5/29/2016,"Good Brews and good food! You must get a flight of their beer, it's good stuff. The menu has a great variety of dishes to choose from, I have tried their pizzas and burgers and was more than satisfied with both. The service is hit-or-miss though, I've had nights with absolutely great service and nights with extremely terrible service."
NoneofYelpsBusiness R.,"Dayton, OH",0,10,,1.0,5/27/2016,"Got take out... One and done.  Food was nasty, cold and .. just all around gross. With so many options in the area, I will never be back."
Tracy H.,"Sparks, NV",0,1,,3.0,4/10/2016,"Food was great, problem we had was the wait. When you use the ""preferred"" wait list on the app and it says 90 minute wait, that is what we expected. When we arrived it was actually 120 min before we were seated. Dustin was very knowledgeable and our food came quickly."
Kelly P.,"Knoxville, TN",1,10,1,5.0,2/12/2016,The service and food was amazing! Our waiter was very knowledgable about the beers and items on the menu. He was very attentive and friendly. My husband got a burger and I got a wrap. The pazookies are also a must and heavenly! We will be returning!
Nick M.,"Fairborn, OH",29,2,,1.0,3/21/2016,"I have been to both BJ'S in the Dayton and not one good experience. First time at Austin landing service was awful and took over 30min to get 2 burgers. Next time I went slow servcie. Third time I went they got my order wrong not once, not twice but 3 times. I recently came to this one to see if I could have better luck and once again my order was wrong. I ask for no onions in my food and it came with onions on both visit. I have been to one in Columbus and have never had an issue. I will not be going back to the ones in dayton. Apparently there are too many incompetent employees"
Greg S.,"Dayton, OH",0,1,,1.0,2/28/2016,"Called earlier in the day to ask info about call ahead seating, and they said just give them 45 min heads up. We called ahead as instructed at 6:45pm, and were told a 60 min wait so we arrived at 7:30pm. Checked several times with hostess in between the 20 other tables seated ahead of us. Checked at the 90 min mark to let them know they were already well passed(30 mins past) their 60 min wait approximation. Was told there were still 7 tables ahead and she would talk to the manager to see if they can speed us up the list, but to anticipate another 20-30 min wait. By the time we (2 adults/2children) were seated it was already 8:35pm (110 mins.)  The fun didn't end there. We didn't have anyone take a drink order until almost 9pm. When our server Finally arrived to take our drinks, we ordered food at the same time fearing that the place would close before we even got a chance to eat. During the ordering process, every question that our family asked about the menus was followed with a ""I don't know"" or an ""I'm not sure.""  Our salads arrived around 9:10 pm, well before our beverages even arrived.  The food we ordered was really good for the most part. Only bad thing food wise was that I ordered a loaded potato as a side , and she asked ""like loaded how???""  I calmly said butter, sour, cheese and bacon. What I received was a side of sweet Monkey bread butter, a plain potato stuffed with cut up sliced bacon and a side of runny nacho cheese sauce. I was actually pretty amazed at how badly the order was screwed up. Lol. All in all. Cool environment inside. Food and Alcohol menu were very very intriguing. So many modern twists of dishes I was anxious to try. But nearly 3 and 1/2 hours for Saturday night dinner for the Wifey, 2 daughters and I is outta frickin control. Call ahead seating my ass. Wait staff needs more menu training also!!!"
Kevin B.,"Beavercreek, OH",0,1,,5.0,2/8/2016,Took a little while to get seated but that was OK it was very crowded. It was their first Friday night open. The restaurant was clean and the staff was very friendly and once we've got seated our food was served quickly. We will return.
Dixie K.,"Dayton, OH",0,1,,1.0,6/28/2016,"So just left the resturant for our offices lunch hour and although the food was excellent the service as well as the manager was terrible! Needless to say I nor my group will be going back anytime soon! I had called about 11:30 today to see if my co workers and I could call ahead and fax over our order for the 8 of us so that when we came in at 12:30 ir would be ready. I spoke to the manager and was told no, and that was fine. He told me that I needed to download their app and that I could place everyone's order through the app and he would put my name on the call a head list for 12:30 and when I got there to give them my name and as soon as we got sat they would place our order. Sounded too good to be true! It was! I got there right at 12:30 and gave them my name. It took about 10 mins for them to have our table ready and that was fine. As soon as I sat down and the waitress came over I told her that I had placed the order online thru their app and told her the order was supposed to be placed as soon as I was seated. She seemed very puzzled and asked if it was for take out? No I said and gave her my phone with the order number in it. She then disappeared for another 10 minutes and came back and said she could not find our order and needed to take it again! So we gave her the order and she left. A few minutes later the manager came over and asked if everything was ok. I told him I was not happpy. Instead of appologizing, he basically said I did not follow directions and I had to show my phone to the hostess when I came in. I asked why when I asked the server about our order she had no idea, and he said they are not trained to know about the app. Sounds like poorly trained servers if you ask me! He said they were working on our order now and should  not take too long. We only have 1 hour for lunch and we were there as a birthday celebration, which he knew. A few minutes later a few of us get our salads and we ask for silverware because we have none. Another server comes by and we ask them for silverware also. Finally more food comes out with our server and we have to ask again for the silverware. She gets it! She has never once asked if we needed refills on drinks or ketchup, which we did and had to take off of another table and we had to ask where the 2 sides of blue cheese was for the Buffalo chicken grill cheeses we had ordered. The worst part of the meal was that there was 8 of us and only 7 of us had food! We thought that it would be out in maybe another minute, it wasn't! Again I had to flag her down and ask, she looked puzzled again and said she never placed her order. She asked if we wanted it to go, since we had to leave in a few. We said yes. The order did come out just a few more minutes later, but nothing was said by the manager or the server and nothing was taken off of our bill!"
