Monica H.,"Barrington, IL",200,4,,5.0,6/25/2017,"Was really looking forward to trying this place- and was not disappointed! My boyfriend got the Hickory Brisket and Bacon burger, and I got the Peruvian Quinoa bowl with shrimp. Everything was great! Huge menu for food and drinks, from burgers to more healthy options. The service was great, not only our server but we were checked on by the manager as well. Have many things I want to try when I go back!"
