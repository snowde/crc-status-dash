Chelsea M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",304,744,469,4.0,8/16/2017,"BJ's is honestly really good. my first experience was at the south hills village location in Pittsburgh.  My sister and I decided to eat here for dinner last night. We sat at the bar and ordered 2 beers and avocado eggrolls--- my favorite app from BJs! They were delicious as always. It took a little while for a bartender to take our food order, but maybe they just thought we were doing the app and beers.. who knows. For dinner, I ordered the Fire-Roasted Barbacoa Chicken. It is a seasoned chicken served over brown rice, black beans, feta cheese and a delicious fire roasted salsa. The dish was fabulous. My sister in law ordered the tuna salad and also enjoyed it. I highly recommend their pizookies for dessert.. delicious!  Be sure to sign up their Rewards program on their website... 1 point for every dollar spent.

Ben H.,"Warren, OH",62,156,13,2.0,12/31/2017,"I have been giving out a lot of two star ratings. This season food quality, service, its all been going downhill. We went here with some teaching friends and expected it to be busy for a Saturday it wasn't luckily. Our server however was bad. She messed up on our apps, drink order, main meal order, messed up our bills and checks. Then she complained to us about how she worked as a server at another location (chain) I don't know how she got a job in a place like this. She couldn't keep a small village coffee shop order in tact.  Our eggroll app was good once she finally placed the order and we got it this took twice to remind her as everyone else was getting their orders. My drink remained empty despite me ordering refills and asking her to bring me more. The rest of the table had empty glasses also. Sad. My Quinoa with shrimp tasted dry, overcooked and lacked any form of flavor. Like a piece of gum that was quickly dried out. The portion size was leaving me hungry and wanting more. Jennifer's chicken was mostly fat and lacked flavor, her drinks also were empty. We don't got to locations to pay high prices, for small portions, decent quality, but the service was bad and slow. I can see why they went from being busy with a line out the door to this. the service has taken a nose dive, food quality and portions leave you hungry when you walk out and prepare to be a camel from dehydraton"
David G.,"Poland, OH",54,25,15,1.0,9/21/2017,"This place seems to have a momentum here in Boardman Ohio. Maybe it's what the masses needed. Won't last Busy all of the time - we thought to give it a chance. Service was horrible. Staff was hanging out socializing with each other forever. Had to ask many times for simple things like water, etc. seems like the same thing over and over with these bigger than life chains with huge branding images to uphold. Focus is clearly On atmosphere over experience. Service is exceptionally terrible. Food is just ok.  This place is like that song you heard in 1996 that you know you'll never remember.  Meh."
Jason H.,"Salem, OH",0,2,4,2.0,12/27/2017,"NO BRISKET ON MY BRISKET BACON BURGER. DRY MEAT TERRIBLY OVER COOKED. I have eaten at BJ Brewhouse in Canton and now four times in Boardman,OH. They have Omission beer on the menu but never have it in stock. I have eaten the hickory brisket bacon burger on another occasion and it was very good. Today I ordered the same meal and received a burnt burger that was as dry as the bun it was served on. I asked where the "" brisket"" was and the server brought me a two (2) OZ cup of brisket and said the manager said that's all the burger is supposed to have.  I said thank you but originally it had NO brisket. The server was kind and helpful with our kitchen issues. Our chicken sandwich was supposed to have honey mustard and came plain.  We never received napkins or silverware during the entire dining experience. Very poor kitchen and lackluster service. Poor management overall. Not worth the price. I'll be picking a different lunch spot next time for sure. Look at this dry burger."
Jeremy B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",17,79,161,4.0,12/18/2017,"Great food, drink selection and atmosphere. I really enjoyed the summer patio but didn't like it being first come/first serve. You find yourself lined up to get a dirty table and sit there waiting for service. Wish they treated that part the same as the rest of the restaurant."
Michael G.,"Niles, OH",76,168,1292,5.0,6/2/2017,"Before BJ's expanded across the country, it was based in Huntington Beach, CA, where I lived between 2004-2009.  During that period, I went to BJ's all the time.  I reluctantly moved back to NE Ohio 8 years ago, and I couldn't be more happy that my wait to get back to BJ's is now over. Everything I have had here as been very good to excellent, including the food and their own beers, and house-made sodas.  But the star of BJ's is definitely their Pizookie.  I have tried all varieties at least once, and my absolute favorite is the S'mores, because it has chocolate cookie base, melted peanut butter, and toasted marshmallows.  It's heaven. The service ha also been above average.  And one of the times I've been here, the service was outstanding.  My waitress was friendly, attentive, and funny too.  I won't mention her entire name here, but her first name starts with an ""A.""  She's one of the best servers I've ever been waited on by.  Seriously, wonderful job A! I'll be back here, often."
Mike D.,"Canfield, OH",0,16,3,3.0,10/27/2017,"A little underwhelming. New building, modern look. Was thinking this would be top notch microbrewery/restaurant.  I failed to realize that some microbrewery,s have chains. Like this one. Defeating the whole idea from the start. It's a chain restaurant that makes its own beer. And the beer was horrible. I got a golden flight of beers. From pales to a stout. They had other flights to choose from so results may vary. But the beers I tried were in my opinion just bad. Non rounded flavor profiles. Had a cloudy pale that tasted skunkey. I have had much better Comercial beers. And much better small brew beers. Beer was very amerturish.  Told the manager my opinion, and she brought me more to try. Just not good. She was friendly though. Wife got a peach Margarita, that was overly sweet, a weak screwdriver.  And a spicey sobe noodle dish. That was absolutely nothing special. They had a large varied menu.  With vegetarian options. Got a seared ahi salad. It was OK, but common.  Only been here once will update my review if my opinion changes."
Leslie H.,"Niles, OH",25,78,559,5.0,5/7/2017,"Tonight was birthday dinner for sis. Lots to review here.      The first visit here was actually pretty smooth thanks to Vince (found out his name tonight because I will probably ask for him when I go back if he is available).      Our waiter tonight was obviously new. I understand being a new waiter/waitress and learning the ropes of a new place is tough, but I didn't quite understand what was going on with our waiter. Being that we were at a brewhouse you would think your waiter would be right on it with checking on you for another beer. Instead we had to ask someone else for another beer. So as for the service we had tonight it wasn't the worst service I have ever had but it most definitely wasn't the best. It was nice to see the manager come and ask if everything was ok. So thumbs up  on that.      As for our dinners and apps everything was delicious and we had to get one item taken off the bill because the carrots were undercooked and still crunchy.      Parmesan crusted chicken was flavorful and hubby said he would definitely get it again. He wasn't a fan of the broccoli or the carrots because they weren't steamed he said they were almost raw veggies instead of cooked veggies.      Brisket bacon burger was they first time my kid had brisket and he said it was delicious and the whole burger was gone in a blink of an eye. (Teenage boys that) he said it was a really good burger.      My nephew ordered a bacon cheese burger and threw a twist and ordered a bowl of chili so that he could have chili cheese on his burger and fries. I didn't try the burgers but the chili was really good not spicy but pretty flavorful. Good idea on a chilly day.       I decided to try the barbacoa chicken over a bed of rice and beans with feta cheese. The portion isn't huge because it is on the enlightened menu. If your going for the lighter side of the menu this was a pretty good combination of flavors.     Pizookie   Everyone should save room for this gooey goodness. WOW .... I had the salted caramel pizookie this might be the best cookie and ice cream combo that I have ever had. I tried a bite of the cookies and cream and the s'mores. Cookies and cream I personally wouldn't get that one for myself. Now the  caramel on the other hand was gooey and had chunks of caramel inside. Yummy goodness.     Apps avacado egg rolls were different and I enjoyed them but you really have to like warmed avocado to appreciate these little appetizers. The sauce the comes with it is sweet and a good pairing with the egg roll.     Potato skins everyone really enjoyed these but how can you mess up a potato skin.      Still giving a  5 star review."
Becky V.,"Akron, OH",37,21,11,3.0,4/30/2017,Tasty but it came out luke warm and we had to send it back for a warm up. Waitress was scarce and this visit was the least busy of our 3 visits.  Great beer selection and excellent margaritas.
Alex D.,"Boardman, OH",16,142,14,5.0,10/22/2017,"The first time I came, I didn't really care for the pizza. We decided to try this place a second time. We sat out on the patio, and had a wonderful meal and good time. Forget their pizza, and eat everything else."
Brandi T.,"Youngstown, OH",17,93,156,3.0,11/5/2017,"My experience here was sub par. It was busy and we got seated tight away which was the only nice thing. My dinner partner ordered a salad that had blueberries and roasted brussel sprouts. She's allergic to blueberries so she asked for them to make it without them which tgery agreed to. The salad came with blueberries despite that. Also, the roasted brussel sports were raw, never cooked, and not seasoned. We didn't want to complain but the waitress could tell we were unhappy so thed manager offered to bring another salad. We agreed and then found out we were charged for the replacement and the original salad. It's doubtful I will be back."
Dave B.,"Boardman, OH",134,16,5,3.0,11/4/2017,"This place is okay, the atmosphere is pretty nice and the prices are reasonable. Didn't much care for the taste of the last 2 items I got, but found the deep pan pizza to be okay. Overall I'd say if your looking for somewhere to try then this place is okay, but it's not your ""gotta go"" to place around town."
Julia K.,"Solon, OH",89,50,42,3.0,7/13/2017,"Not terrible but not very good. I've tried this place twice now. Stop in for a beer find somewhere else for the food.  The first time was much better. (All of us in my party had the grilled cheese options with fries. They were very delicious. And this place does get an extra star for their French fries they are battered and awesome.  The second time I had the barbacoa cauliflower pitas. This is definitely not the place for lighter or healthier option foods. They offer a good selection but this particular one was not good at all. There was no flavor at all.  The menu is extensive but it is incredibly pricey. I've had two meals there and one meal that I had as takeout (the spaghetti and meatballs absolutely terrible. It tastes like a jar sauce with a ton of Italian seasoning thrown in) each time was a let down to me when it came to the quality of my meal and what I had to pay for it.  The first time we went I didn't want to judge the staff because they were newly opened and they were very friendly. But now that it's been a couple months I hate to say it the waiters just all seem kind of miserable and look like they'd rather be somewhere else. We often had to wait for things like silver ware, sugar for tea, (also there was no ice in the iced tea and it was so warm and bitter. Definitely over brewed) and then had to ask for condiments also. It took a long time to get the check and then it wasn't even our check. Just small things that seemed to be happening everywhere that can be a bit annoying. (the two tables next to us had to ask for quite a few missing items as well and they did have a different server)  I will say this place gets 3 stars for their open atmosphere and large draft list. I would definitely go here to enjoy a drink or two and would probably order a side of fries. I would not however go here for a meal or any special occasion."
John C.,"Youngstown, OH",60,10,,4.0,5/25/2017,"Was very excited for this to open, as there aren't many options for deep dish in the area. My girlfriend is from Chicago so she knows deep dish.  The pizza was not very good! Honestly i could pass on it. We tried deep dish, flat bread, and more. BUT, they have many other options. Every other meal i've gotten from here has been excellent. (burgers, wings, chips + queso)"
Stephan P.,"Evesham Township, NJ",18,10,10,5.0,6/16/2017,"First time there and I definitely will be going back! Great atmosphere and our waitress Alicia was fantastic. I had the Piadina, which was Excellent and my wife had the Chicken Lettuce Wrap, Excellent as well. There is a wide array of homemade beers to choose from as well as your domestics. Try one of theres or maybe even two as both my varieties were delicious. Very casual so there is no need to get dressed up. If you have the app, you can check in and beat the line..."
C B.,"Youngstown, OH",187,1,,1.0,8/26/2017,"Frozen grocery store quality food for upscale prices. Beer selection:meh. If you're a basic person with money to blow, you'll love this place. If you expect something actually high quality for the high prices, be forewarned."
Tracy W.,"Girard, OH",29,1,8,5.0,4/24/2017,Food was amazing and excellent service for being the 1st day open. Great service. Will definitely be back.
Rebecca D.,"Canfield, OH",0,12,,1.0,8/12/2017,"Went tonight for our 10th Anniversary. Appetizer was good. It was downhill from there! Service was absolutely awful!! Our server was beyond clueless, she couldn't answer 75% of our questions. We had to ask for drink refills and take home containers. We had to wait for drinks,food and our check to be processed. The meals were fair at best. I had a steak it was drastically smaller than the menu showed, which was fine for me. But if my husband had ordered that he would have been really hungry. Steak was over cooked my green beans were hard and tasteless and my husband's burger was fair. Based on the crowds each time we drove past, I expected a home run. Clearly it's just the novelty of a new place. UPDATE: BJ's corporate office sent us an e gift card due to our lousy experience above. We decided not to endure the lousy service again and just get takeout. The food was so bad the first time we didn't want to invest too much beyond what our gift card offered. So we both stuck to chicken sandwiches.Honestly we thought they had to get it right this time right? WRONG!!! Not only was my sandwich lacking any of the toppings, it was supposed to have but both of our French fries were dry and tasteless. The sandwiches again fair at best. We could have gone to Chick Fil A and had better! This place has bad food period. The appetizers are ok but once your past that forget it. People must really like the beer for them to continue to draw a crowd because it sure isn't the service or food."
Alex C.,"Youngstown, OH",6,16,4,5.0,5/6/2017,"Bj was so good, our server summer which I recommend greatly was excellent , I can't wait to come back here again , the service is great , food is gourmet , this is definitely a competitor with PF Changs and Cheesecake Factory , And may I say , it blows it out of the water , I got the chicken lettuce raps and I got a pizookie as a desert, can't wait to come back"
Ben B.,"Youngstown, OH",2,9,4,3.0,7/8/2017,"Saturday afternoon in July. Patio is open seating. Sat right down at 5p. Waiter came to us in 5min. Ordered in 20min. Wife's sliders were missing the added cheese. Had to tell three people to get it. You have one waiter but he doesn't bring food nor drinks so at times you don't know who to ask. Had to ask for water refills. Jeremiah red was delicious. Wife had the blonde, also delicious. I had the Nashville hot crispy chicken sandwich. Pretty good, good size not overwhelming. Crispy warm fries with little too much salt. But still good. Slow service on the patio. Beautiful space and patio. Would come back in hopes of better service. Everyone was very nice though."
Kelly M.,"Youngstown, OH",0,4,,4.0,8/31/2017,Our server was great! And the homemade sodas are so good! Try the black cherry. Food was very tasty. The menu was huge!
Jamie H.,"Youngstown, OH",60,4,2,5.0,8/12/2017,"Sorry I forgot to take pictures until after, I was so hungry! It was a packed house on Saturday night but my wife and I were seated inside 30 minutes. We enjoyed the Pot Stickers, The Old Style Tomato Basil Pizza and the French Dip. The food was fantastic and the house root beer (with free refills) was very satisfying. I will be back. Highly recommend!"
Jacqueline C.,"Youngstown, OH",21,1,1,4.0,5/8/2017,I called ahead when they opened and the hostess said there wasn't a need to call ahead. The manager seated us quickly once we arrived and diverted our 1 hour seating wait. The waitress didn't know what was gluten free. We ended up getting the baked potato for a side after the waitress reached out to management...again..because she didn't know what baked potato toppings were gluten free. The manager was great. The food was amazing and the staff was courteous and prompt. Well worth the wait and hassle in the beginning!
Angela G.,"Youngstown, OH",43,6,,1.0,6/17/2017,"Food was bad.  Ordered a chicken dish that looked nothing like the pic!  Burnt!! Service is slow due to The server having to explain all of the beers and menu items to their tables! Ridiculous ..,they need to focus on guest service and not explaining everything!  People can read!!!!"
Chris M.,"Steelton, Youngstown, OH",75,2,,1.0,6/7/2017,Went there for the time ever and it was awful... I get it everyone is new but I order a full salad and then they have me a side salad. The food is way over price there too.. I got a full salad with chicken 17 bucks yeah it a bit over price.
Jeremy G.,"Santa Fe, NM",26,48,14,2.0,7/10/2017,"I have eaten here twice in the last 2 months.  The first time I tried a burger with portabello mushroom, it was good, but far from amazing.  The second time I tried the pizza. It was good , but the sauce needs work. Entrees are overpriced. The place is not a good value for the money. I would recommend this place for drinks and bar food, but nothing more."
Jenn N.,"San Francisco, CA",0,13,3,5.0,6/14/2017,"First time in Ohio, first time trying BJ's and I have to say -- it was so good! All kinds of drinks for any occasion and they have a good draft brew selection!  Their portions are huge, the restaurant was clean, and the vibe was casual and relaxing. Bring your family here for some good conversations over a meal or bond with your co-workers after work."
River H.,"Cleveland, OH",1,2,,5.0,8/12/2017,"Nick D. was our waiter tonight for a party of 6. He was fantastic! Very attentive and excellent service overall. We did have an issue with a meal, but he handled that VERY well. Thanks Nick!! We will be coming back because of his service! :)"
Brianna J.,"Kissimmee, FL",54,31,2,5.0,7/6/2017,"I love this place! The menu offers so many different options! I'm gluten sensitive, and they have gluten free buns, pizza, and desserts, along with ciders! So, so thankful to have this so close to home!"
Michelle T.,"Vienna, OH",57,24,1,5.0,5/6/2017,"It was a very busy night prom and a college graduation occurring locally and they did great with keeping up with it all!!  The speed of our food and drinks being delivered was wonderful. Megan D our server was delightful so cheery and upbeat. The manager stopped by in the bar area to check on us. We tried the APP to reserve ahead it was still going to be a 45min wait, but we got a table in the bar area that was first come first serve.  The food is amazing and lots of healthy options with calories listed on the menu. Overall, perfect experience and we will be back."
Chris M.,"Biloxi, MS",7,4,,5.0,7/1/2017,"My family loves this place, yes it's busy, but it's still new and stays busy. Little pricy for a family of 4, but will go back every week."
Harry T.,"Youngstown, OH",0,22,2,3.0,8/10/2017,"Slow service, voluminous menu, and mediocre tasting food. We weren't impressed with our first visit."
Vel W.,"Youngstown, OH",97,3,,3.0,7/9/2017,"I really like the food, but the service is really slow almost every single time that I dine in, take out, or do curbside pick up!! I've had mistakes on my orders multiple times, and an onion in my pizookie before !! The managers have been nice enough to comp the mistake or give gift cards and coupons, but there would be nothing to reconcile if things were done right. When the food comes out correctly, I think it's delicious and I would go back despite my complaints. The employees are a toss up. Some are very nice and accommodating and others come off apathetic. The atmosphere and decor are nice and if the bartender pays attention to you, the drinks are fast . Good luck to anyone who tries it!!"
J M.,"Canfield, OH",0,4,,5.0,5/31/2017,"It was a very busy weekend and we had to wait at the bar a long time for our take out. The manager gave us a free beer and our food for free!  Austin the bartender was fantastic. This place is wonderful, probably just suffering from being new. We'll  be back!"
Michael G.,"East Palestine, OH",40,4,,5.0,5/11/2017,"Very first impression was really great, friendly and welcoming staff.  Waiter was very knowledgeable about the beers they brew on site.  Beer was absolutely amazing!  Food was spot-on!  Will definitely be coming back again!  Maybe again for dinner!"
Ron S.,"Leetonia, OH",13,2,,3.0,5/7/2017,Sat at the bar in a booth and the waitress started out good and the next thing we know she is waiting tables on the other side of the restaurant. Had to flag her over to get desert. Beer was good and the food came out hot.  Nice big screens to watch the Cavs game.
E M.,"Youngstown, OH",0,62,2,3.0,6/10/2017,"Went for a second time. Had decent food. Got a burger, it wasn't cooked right. They are in such a hurry there. It is still busy because we don't have many places in Youngstown. Food isn't great. The building is cool, but the service lacks. Will go back but probably wait a couple of months it's not worth the wait"
Brittney W.,"North Shore, Pittsburgh, PA",56,3,3,1.0,8/27/2017,Super excited to try BJ's for the first time. Walk in with about 10 empty tables and the hostess says it's about a 30 minute wait! Because there are only 4 servers. We won't be back. Poor management and scheduling is never acceptable.
Christopher R.,"Beaver Falls, PA",0,1,,5.0,5/4/2017,I had the California club flatbread and it was delicious! Also the orange cream soda and the Oreo cookie dessert were really good. Definitely will be back.
Jim T.,"Salem, OH",0,1,,1.0,5/8/2017,"Bad food, bad service, high prices. Nice atmosphere for what it's worth. The first three things make this place not worth ever visiting again. Do yourself a favor and visit a locally owned restaurant. There's plenty of good ones out there. These big chain restaurants are mostly terrible with a few exceptions of course. C'mon people, don't waste your money on this garbage."
