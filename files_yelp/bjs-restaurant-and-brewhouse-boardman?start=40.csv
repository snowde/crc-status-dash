Mike J.,"Youngstown, OH",0,17,2,2.0,7/21/2017,"DISAPPOINTED to say the least.... before I start I'd like to say the wait staff was fantastic and they would get 5 stars... efficient, friendly, and personable. The food is where BJs spiraled out of control. I didn't like a single thing served to me.... Appetizer was spinach artichoke dip with a decent flavor but rubbery stale chips to eat it with. For a main course I decided on the ribs... again, decent flavor but so overcooked they were hard to eat. That coupled with horribly bland and dry mashed potatoes and some strange cauliflower dish that was too spicy to eat I for the life of me can't figure out why the place is packed from open to close."
Craig H.,"Youngstown, OH",38,23,5,3.0,5/9/2017,"This place will do well because it is in Boardman, the chain restaurant capital of Northeast Ohio and it's not in Poland or Canfield, the gestapo capitals of Northeast Ohio.  Craft beers are their story and they have a lot of them.  The servers try real hard to guide you to their branded brews.  And you might as well because they seriously overprice other brands.  The few local craft beers I saw on the menu were $2 more than at other pubs.  They want you to see it but not buy it.  Not hard to tell where their profit margin is.  The self branded beers were good though, no complaints.  We had a deep dish pizza that was a good pie.  And our service was good not withstanding a mix up between customer checks at the end.  It certainly isn't a 'go to"" place but no regrets either.  Just be prepared for good sized check for dinner in what seems like a slightly decorated warehouse.  Boardman, meet the suburbs of Columbus."
Casey B.,"Rogers, OH",0,1,,2.0,5/21/2017,"We were not thrilled with this place. Our waitress was not great. We barely got drink refills and they brought us the wrong desert and overcharged us. The waitress never came back! If you get Emilie for a waitress I'd ask to be seated elsewhere. The food was okay. My burger was underdone. I realize people don't always like meat well-done but I do not want pink meat. My sister got the peanut noodles which she said were really good, but the portion was very small for the price and you don't even get a salad. I might try it again."
Brian M.,"Youngstown, OH",0,1,,2.0,6/19/2017,"Went here to celebrate a late Fathers Day (The Day After). Let me start by saying our server was extremely kind and our food was very tasty. However, we had random servers constantly bringing us the wrong food(We counted 6 times). Somehow our waitress got switched 3 TIMES! This was confusing for us as no one knew who really was our server. One of our dishes was completely burnt, we sent it back and it came back not cooked. Lastly, to get our check took over 40 minutes after she read our checks back to us(which were wrong). Actually, I'm still waiting for my bill to pay. Save your money and time!!"
Tyrone L.,"Reynoldsburg, OH",0,1,,1.0,8/24/2017,"First time..& maybe my last. Happy to see a up & growing chain restaurant in the Mahoning valley. But what a let down. I was looking forward to their deep dish pizza, BBQ wings & trip chocolate pizookie. Let's start be saying pizza is life! So for a $20 medium I thought I was in for a treat. They went wrong by copying the same recipe to a Digiorno frozen pizza. I got the BJ's favorite or should I say their worst. Everything on it tasted processed. I wasn't expecting it to be a true Chicago deep dish from previous reviews. But I was hoping for a 10x's better Pizza Hut pan crust. I was bamboozled! The wings were pretty good. Not worth close to 12 bucks. At least make them jumbo. The chicken must've been on a crack head diet before sacrificing its life for this meal. The BJ's peppered BBQ sauce was no better than some baby rays. Nothing to fancy. Lastly the infamous warm cookie with cheap ice cream. Hook up with Handles ice cream or get a copy of their recipe. Overall pretty disappointed with the quality of the food. For a total of 42 bucks take out. For one person having their monthly cheat meal!! Let's just say this did not hit the spot."
Kathie M.,"Beaver Falls, PA",0,10,1,3.0,5/7/2017,"We went during a very busy time on a Sunday afternoon. While waiting for a table a hostess came around offering everyone pizza which although I didn't try any, this was a great idea. Service was okay , you could tell that our waitress wasn't very experienced but she was nice. Several different servers brought us refills on our drinks - my husband had three iced teas lined up at one time. I don't recommend the flavored iced teas( peach & mandarin orange green tea) , they had very little flavor. The food was pretty good (deep dish pizza and hickory burger). I plan on returning to try the desserts and to see if it's better as they gain more experience. All in all -not a bad experience just not great."
