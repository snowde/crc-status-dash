Nikki H.,"Boulder, CO",1240,448,201,4.0,1/4/2018,"I feel like this is one of those places we end up when we don't know what the hell we want to eat and can't agree on anything because BJ's has everything. I've never had to wait long for a table, and the service has always been great. I suppose if you came here on a busy Friday night, you might wait a bit though. The ambiance is trying to be more upscale, but it still has more of a sport bar vibe. Imagine Buffalo Wild Wings and Bar Louie had a baby and it specialized in brews, that's BJs.  If you're looking for a place for a date night, I can't say I'd recommend this spot, but if you have been together awhile and you're hungry and can't agree on where to eat, this place will suit your needs."
Melanie L.,"Naples, FL",18,16,,1.0,9/22/2017,"Arrived on a Friday night so expected it to be busy. We decided to sit in the bar area and it took 8 minutes to even get acknowledged. And then the server arrived with a trainee. Really?? Who works with a trainee on a Friday night??  We ordered appetizers and sat for 10 minutes (again, in the bar area with several servers passing by us) with our glasses empty before flagging down the trainee. He apologized and said our potato skins were still being cooked. Huh? You put the skins in the fryer, it wasn't like we were ordering a well-done steak.  We asked for the check and left immediately.  WILL NEVER GO BACK."
Emily P.,"Lafayette, CO",92,106,323,4.0,9/7/2017,"Tons of great beer options. We had a fantastic server in the bar.  We ordered the watermelon salad, 3 appetizers, and a big salad. Everything was good. The highlight of the meal was the excellent server."
Sarah S.,"La Mesa, CA",267,48,32,2.0,11/1/2017,First time ordering from this location. I ordered a bowl of Vegan Lentil soup with a bead bowl. What I got when I unpacked the take out at home. Was a half full cup size container of soup that just covered the bottom of my bread bowl. What an absolute joke!
Jeff S.,"Longmont, CO",20,7,1,3.0,12/25/2017,"This place has really great beers. The food is usually pretty good. I am a huge fan of the pizookies, particularly the salted caramel one. Although, there are simply too many items on their menu. The menu seems like a small book. As for the service, I have had good service as well as really bad service. It depends on how busy they are."
Maura S.,"Evanston, IL",210,71,367,4.0,3/6/2017,"I've been to BJ's a few time and always have a good experience. The food is great most of the time and the pazookis (deep dish cookies) are amazing! The service is usually great but sometimes can be slow on busy nights. The noise level can a little loud sometimes but is usually not bad. Its a great place to bring groups and pretty much any age. Also a good place to watch sports, they have good TV placement.  This time around we showed up to BJ's with a huge group and they took great care of us. They split all of our checks and got almost every detail of the orders correct.  I ordered the chicken fettucini alfredo and it was delicious! I ate it for two more days after that, it was a lot of food. My boyfriend and I split the mozzarella sticks which were great. He had hickory brisket and bacon burger and loved it. I didn't try it but it looked insanely good. At our table we also had a pepperoni pizza, the bacon guacamole deluxe burger, and a few other things. All of it was great! We didn't order dessert this time around (unfortunately) but next time!!"
Paula B.,"Denver, CO",12,146,143,4.0,7/27/2017,"I love BJ's. I visited several locations in many states and I've never been disappointed. I like how consistent they all are. Good food, huge beer selection, fun casual place and great service each time. I will continue being a loyal costumer. They do a great job."
Daryl B.,"Edmonds, WA",0,4,2,3.0,4/30/2017,"In a town where food frustration can run high, BJ's is sure to pleasure the hungry wanderer, although the discerning connoisseur may find it lacking. A slightly disconcerting ambiance combines the class of a sit down restaurant with the cheap thrills of a sports bar. The food was quite excellent although there was a reliance on fried foods. Keep in mind that when ordering the burger, the meat might be a little too much to get your mouth around. The service was exceptional, be sure to leave a big tip for BJ's. 3 stars  After an average incubation period, stool was large in quantity although easily passed. Consistency was an issue during the expulsion phase but the sheer quantity of mass purged from your system will leave you feeling light and free. 3 stars.  Overall 3 stars"
Dee G.,"Chatsworth, CA",211,19,30,4.0,7/22/2017,That portobello burger was everything I expected plus some. I get so excited when I love my food soooo much that I clean my plate! Nicole was so very patient and attentive with us . I also love the fact that I don't have to have French fries as my side. I appreciate choices
Arshan A.,"Superior, CO",16,104,92,5.0,2/12/2017,"This is a great place to go if you're looking for good food and a ton of TVs. It's always the first option for me in that scenario. They have a huge selection of food, and so far I haven't tried one I don't like. Any of the sandwiches are my favorite, and the food here isn't overly expensive. This one is huge and right in the middle of 29th street mall, which mean you can do a lot while you're there."
Sarah A.,"Boulder, CO",0,10,1,4.0,6/21/2017,"Went there with a few friends for dessert last night- Tuesdays they have these $3 cookie pie/ice cream things. They were pretty good! Really REALLY sweet. But that's what we were in for. I was looking over the menu otherwise, and most of the stuff looked a little over-priced for what it is, but the atmosphere there is nice, so I suppose you're paying for that as well."
Richard G.,"Fort Collins, CO",2,61,27,2.0,7/3/2017,"Aside from being forgotten for most of the evening by our waiter, the food was rather good for a chain store. Unfortunately the end of the night was capped by our server not remembering these special was half off for our pizza. Sorry B"
Nick D.,"New York, NY",72,478,655,2.0,9/9/2016,"Late night eats don't always go so well. I ordered a bacon burger which wasn't cooked the way I asked, my girlfriend and brother were upset how their meals tasted as well. They have a decent selection of beer, but nothing I haven't had or that wowed me. Can't say I'll be back."
Michael H.,"Boulder, CO",1,23,2,1.0,5/24/2017,"What a horrible example of service tonight. I come here often and have never had a complaint. Tonight, the bartender was totally oblivious to me. It took a long time to get a 2nd beer. Also, I had my credit card in the cup for at least 15 minutes before he noticed. It all started with him not hearing that I wanted a lemon with my water. Then, my medium burger was well done and the fried egg on top was hard cooked. To top it off, it's Wednesday and burgers are $10...he charged me $14.  Stay away on Wednesdays. The people behind the bar on Mondays and Fridays are much better."
Peter W.,"East Boulder, Boulder, CO",12,2,,1.0,9/17/2017,Our bartender Brandon was awful. Friendly guy but lacking any knowledge of customer service. My dinner came and I was half done before he brought my wine. When I asked him for it he said he was in the kitchen so how could he get me my wine.  Ok took forever to get refills on our drinks and he never got us menus. We had to ask another employee. He never apologized for anything. The customer next to us threw his bill at him as well.
Audrey W.,"Centennial, CO",0,3,,1.0,9/22/2017,"Had a very disappointing experience for dinner. We got there at 7:30 for a movie at 9, and didn't get our food until 8:50. I also ordered a sandwich with no cheese and with avocado on it, and got cheese and no avocado when it arrived. We went to BJs to get pazookies, but there was no way we could've ordered them anyway. Would not recommend because there are places much less expensive for better quality in Boulder."
Devan M.,"Platteville, CO",27,8,1,5.0,7/9/2017,Great service and my first time there. Food is delicious and the atmosphere in the restaurant is great too. Our server was really nice and on top of everything which for me was a plus. Would recommend going here.
M S.,"Riverside, CA",0,1,,1.0,9/30/2017,"Where do I start! Worst service ever. We waited forty minutes to get our food and when it did come we were missing French fries to go with my sandwich and waited an additional twenty minutes to get the fries. When we finally got our bill we were charged for two additional meals. The bill was fixed but took even longer. I'm not even from here and we came here because we frequently go to the one back home. Not anymore, goodbye forever!"
Mona K.,"Denver, CO",178,231,310,3.0,2/19/2016,"BJ's is the perfect place to come and relax with friends, share some pizookies, and sip on bottomless root beer refills. Highly recommend the appetizers, burgers, and pizza. The southwest egg rolls are by far my favorite.  Make sure you order the pizookie trio for dessert! The Oreo is a showstopper :)"
Bob F.,"Columbus, OH",37,4,,1.0,9/2/2017,"DONT GO. !!!!    Horrible service and manager Cody ?  should be fired.   Went in to eat and watch a game with 9 people at about noon and asked for a table to watch game, place was empty but lots of staff,  three  at hostess  stand even they told us they would get a table ready, 15 min later we were still waiting and they told us that they were waiting for our waiter to clock in.  I finally said aren't you going to seat us and get us some waters?   They said agoin our waiter hadn't started but guess they could seat us at table.  We sat down and after 10 more and still no waiter or water.  I went to the bar and asked for a manager and after about five minutes he came out.  I told him what was going on and he said he would get someone right over and five minutes later still no water or order...the waiter did ok but they were very slow to get us waters snd said they needed to take the drink orders up before getting us our app order.  Food was good enough, the manager Cody never came back out,  and we realized he had been sitting behind us drinking coffee while we waited for our waters and had to know how mad we were getting and ignored it and us.staff standing all around, no apologies or even an offer of a free drink, at that point they should have had everyone helping us.  Never again"
Laurel D.,"Littleton, CO",34,20,,4.0,3/26/2017,"We went for lunch during the week.  We got in and out in good time, which is important for a business day.  The grilled cheese was terrific 'comfort food' and my colleague's taco was excellent.  Service was good and serving size was great for lunch.  I would definitely return."
Jocalyn E.,"Boulder, CO",132,119,13,3.0,3/4/2017,"Your standard chain restaurant. They offer a crazy amount of selections, but quality and seasoning often are lacking. We go here when we don't feel like cooking but don't know what we want..."
Conrad S.,"Boulder, CO",96,226,34,3.0,8/16/2015,"I walk in and sit at the bar.  The lighting is excellent and the atmosphere is pretty great. Huge tvs playing the important games (Cubs ve sox), women's tennis, football, golf, etc. the interior is well decorated clean and nice with windows looking at some of the brewing equipment.  I am immediately greeted by the bartender, Jessica, who asks me what i want to drink. I'm unsure and she begins making recommendations and giving me samples of beers. The first few are a total miss for me, they are still all very interesting. She recommends a porter and its delicious, I ask for a beer that'll go well with a burger. She recommends a red ale. It's perfect and I order a pint and then proceed to order a portobello burger.  The red ale is subtle and light. It has a smoothness to it with an after taste that's almost sweet. Bjs also has other beers on tap such as Averys and Oskar Blues, Kona, Newcastle, and Sanitas.   The burger was cooked perfectly and the fries were also good. However they aren't anything to rave over.  Company policy is also against violent programming so no fights can be watched here. Bummer. Over all I was happy."
David Z.,"Boulder, CO",130,125,52,1.0,10/6/2016,"The Tortilla soup was not hot, and the Santa Fe Salad was missing, red onion, jack cheese and avocado, pretty much the stuff that makes it a ""Santa Fe "" salad , what i got was like Newark NJ salad."
Jill E.,"Boulder, CO",26,166,12,3.0,11/7/2015,"I've been here many times with friends and family, in it's new location as well as the old ones. Didn't realize it was a chain until the bartender mentioned it. For the most part, the food is just ok, not spectacular however, for the prices they charge, but the portions are large. Too salty though for me, so I have to ask them to skip all the salt where they can. I'll salt the food myself, if it needs it.  The last time I was in, on Halloween to watch game 4 of the Baseball World Series, I first ordered a thin crust pizza. It had waaaayyyy to much cheese on it, not enough veggies, and the crust was mushy. Made me feel a bit ill and almost killed my appetite. The waiter removed it from my bill and I ordered the Asian salad with chicken instead. It was a large dish, but also just ok. I thought the chicken was under cooked, so I pushed that all to the side. I took over half the salad home and recooked the chicken before daring to eat it the next day.  The alcohol selection is good, though one time I ordered an Irish coffee and it was terrible. The bartenders are wonderful people though, so I let it slide. I like the beer selection here and the wine choices are good as well. Service is a bit iffy at times. Earlier this year, I met a friend here for happy hour and we were ignored by our waitress. Waited 20 minutes for the waitress to come to our table with water and to take our order. And no, it wasn't busy. This was not good as my friend had some not so good news that day and she really needed cheering up. Having bad service only made her more unhappy and angry too. Needless to say, I left a very small tip and a note explaining why. The next time I came in, to meet others for happy hour, I asked the waitress to please not ignore us like the last girl did, and she made sure our table was covered well. Tipped her well for being on her game.  Noise levels here can get pretty loud, depending on when you come. My friends and family like to come here for the big screen TVs. I like those too, when I'm interested in a game, but putting the large one behind the bar into multi-screen mode is very distracting for some people, myself included. Will I be back, yes, most likely, but it's not my first choice."
Deb F.,"Fort Collins, CO",0,53,,1.0,10/8/2017,"What a disappointment!  We arrived in the early afternoon on a Sunday...the place was busy, but there were plenty of open tables.  We were seated right away and our server took our order for an appetizer to share (we had some hesitation between two different dishes ...this comes into play later) and our entrees.  The appetizer arrived quickly, but the server just dropped it in the middle of the table and sped off.  We had to catch her eye to ask for plates, since it was a little messy and there were three of us and we didn't want to slop the sauce all over the table.  Our server returned with a stack of 3 small plates and sped off again.  As we passed the plates around, we noticed the middle plate had food stuck to it.  Ugh.  We finished the appetizer and waited...and waited...and waited.  One person ordered coffee in the meantime; it arrived in a mug that had food stuck to the outside.  The server never offered to refill it, we had to ask.  Forty minutes later our entrees finally showed up.  The food was ok...nothing special.  We decided against dessert and asked for the check; it incorrectly included two appetizers, although we only ordered one.  Once the bill got straightened out, we were glad to leave.  We won't be returning."
Erin K.,"Boulder, CO",33,215,263,3.0,5/17/2014,"A decent location with your typical chain restaurant food. I don't mean to put BJs down, I would go there again. However, the food is what you would expect from an Outback, Olive Garden, Texas Roadhouse - it's good, but the flavors don't pop and it doesn't feel super fresh.  Great service, good bar menu and selection, and good for the price."
Anna F.,"Manhattan, NY",139,177,123,3.0,9/5/2016,"The only thing saving this place from a two star, in my opinion, were the brussel sprouts. They were somehow fantastic as compared to the other food that we ordered. I had the boneless wings because I haven't been able to find great wings since I moved away from the Midwest area, so I was really expecting something tasty. These were among the worst wings I've ever had. I probably ate 2-3 pieces because every bite had that weird tendony/chewy/gross part of the chicken texture and I couldn't stomach it. Each wing was about 1/2 sauced, there were so many 'bald spots' where there was zero sauce, so that was disappointing as well. My boyfriend's burger was subpar, and his brother's chicken was dry. Their beer menu was eh, the only good find was Odell's Myrcenary Double IPA which was obviously a guest beer. Won't likely visit this restaurant again."
Anne S.,"Lockport, IL",4,51,18,4.0,10/24/2016,For a chain this was pretty good. Standard prices. I had a salad with fresh tuna and it was pretty darn yummy. Lots of different ingredients. I would go back. Usually like the local eats vs. chains but we were on a time crunch and this was a pleasant surprise!
Bob M.,"Sunrise, FL",3,41,62,5.0,10/21/2016,"The Brussel Sprouts are the thing to try, they are salty with a hint of sweetness, I could eat the"
Devin S.,"Henderson, NV",19,8,,1.0,10/11/2016,My soup came out cold and then I found a giant hair in it. I'll I got was a snappy apology from my waiter. Like he was mad at me? Patricio was a dick to say the least.
Bryce L.,"Denver, CO",0,2,,1.0,11/19/2016,Made a reservation over the phone and they had no clue when we got there. No alternative was given. Terrible service.
Chris D.,"Arvada, CO",88,47,36,4.0,2/24/2015,"The food was good and service was adequate.  We were asked if we were rewards members when we walked in, but never asked about it again.   It has all the settings of a high class restaurant ( and priced as such)  but lacks the over the top service and food  to match the bill.  Good, not great with one exception, the Chili Cheese fries is covered in a pork Green Chili that I found delicious.  (Extra star just for the Chili!) Overall the party I was with felt all about the same. Tasty food, average service, but a heavy price tag."
Joanne P.,"Denver, CO",37,24,3,5.0,6/8/2016,"Food was great, waitress was outstanding, very accomodating. We ordered wings, bbq ribs for appetizers. Steaks, spaghetti for dinner, brussel sprouts. Everything was delicious!"
Shannon P.,"Highlands Ranch, CO",96,19,1,3.0,6/13/2016,"I have a weird review. I ate there with my family last weekend and the food was good. Then we ordered dessert (one of the pazookies) and all was going well until it was almost gone and my Dad said, ""What is this?"" and pulls something out of his mouth. It is a piece of chewed gum! We couldn't believe it was actually gum until we smelled it and it smelled like grape! Bleck!!! So disgusting. We had already paid, so we just informed the waiter to please let the kitchen staff know that one of their pieces of gum may have fallen into the dessert."
megan f.,"Wheat Ridge, CO",212,3,,2.0,9/12/2015,"This brew house felt like the inside of a strip club but wasn't as cool because we didn't see any butts.  But really, if you like overpriced food made of salt with some salt on top with a side of salt, definitely check this place out! (Salt!)"
Karla C.,"West Lafayette, IN",2,7,11,4.0,11/17/2014,"The ambience is nice, food is great, service varies, I think the server we had that night had a lot on her mind or was really busy so had a couple mistakes. I don't blame her though, still love this place!! :)  Price is a little high but not too bad. Try the avocado rolls. And the glazed chicken"
Julie J.,"Denver, CO",2,16,,4.0,7/15/2016,Popped in for an early dinner. Service was very good and the food was good as usual.  BJ's is a great place to eat and relax.
Sally H.,"Aurora, CO",126,102,281,4.0,5/21/2015,"This is a large chain restaurant so do not expect 5 star cuisine.  I been to other BJs in Colorado and the food is decent.  It does its job to fill one up.  I would normally rate chain restaurants as 3 stars.  However, I gave this specific location an extra star because they were so accommodating to our needs. My family had a reservation to another restaurant close by for a large party.  We were celebrating my neice's graduation and that restaurant could not fulfill our reservation despite having it made two weeks prior.  We end up calling this BJs and they made it work!!!  The servers were super friendly and was very patient with my family.  Great service is tremendously better than no  service.  Kudos to this location."
Joe H.,"Longmont, CO",2,16,,4.0,5/10/2015,Food: Extensive menu but I can only attest to the good burgers and pizza.   Service: Good. Beer selection: Good. Vibe: Big and busy. A bit touristy.
