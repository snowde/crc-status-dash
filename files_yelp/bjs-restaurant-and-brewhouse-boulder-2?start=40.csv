Nora B.,"Denver, CO",126,129,84,1.0,1/23/2015,"Skip it --- unless you like being sold reward program from the moment you walk in the door until the moment you leave, don't mine wait staff who don't listen, etc Lots of other choices for restaurants in this area -- I'll skip this one in the future"
Nick D.,"Charleston, SC",4,195,,5.0,4/4/2016,"First time here and it was great!  The food was really good as were the drinks.  When we are up in Boulder, we will be back.  Very good."
Elizabeth J.,"Centennial, CO",53,3,,5.0,6/6/2016,"By far my favorite place to take my family for dinner. Yesterday we showed up and were surprised to see Elka working the floor as we thought we always had to drive to Other stores to see her. The food and service were perfect as always, and Elka was the bonus surprise! She's one amazing manager, don't ever let her go! She's kind, she remembers your name and makes you feel as if she is welcoming you into her own home... That means more than anything. I'll drive for service before I drive for food"
Mark R.,"Denver, CO",0,8,,1.0,6/4/2016,I have never had worst service. I sat at the bar with an empty glass and the bartender walked by 3 times and said nothing. This was an empty bar I might add. I finally got his attention and he poured me a beer. How hard was that? I have been coming to BJ's since I was a kid and it was on pearl and I will never come back.
Natalie P.,"Denver, CO",145,143,77,3.0,1/19/2015,This place is mediocre. The clam chowder is supper salty. The bacon cheeseburger was bland salty and came with no house sauce. The fried calamari was cold and tasted very fried. At least the coffee was good ... The waitress was very nice and helpful but I wouldn't recommend this place if you are looking for quality food. I mean it's definitely nice looking but I would skip it.
Doug G.,"Marina Del Rey, CA",17,126,7,1.0,8/23/2016,"Didn't expect much and BJ's underdelivered.  The food was simple, a blackened salmon ceasar salad and their jambalaya, and it was pretty good at a solid 3 out of 5 stars.  What made the experience pretty miserable was the staff.  The only one who seemed remotely happy was the hostess.  The wait staff had permanent scowls on their faces, and it wasn't just our waitress Christa.  The waitress who came over to tell us someone would be with us soon, our waitress, the third waitress who slammed our pates down on the table, and the waitress we flagged down all had frowns on their faces and were obviously unhappy.  Not sure what management is doing to make them all so unpleasant but they should are a long look at it because customers can see and feel the negativity."
Eric S.,"Denver, CO",96,179,54,3.0,2/27/2015,"Ok, Boulder here we go. Walking in, I was not greeted, so I proceeded to the bar. The bartender was prompt and helpful as my salad came quickly.  The ambience is calm and pleasing. They seem to have 1001 taps available, but keeping it non alcoholic tonight. The ribeye was really good. The bartender refilled my water many times as my thirst was quenched. Walking out, the five greeters never said have a good night. I give the hostesses a zero out of five stars. I'll give the bartender four out of five stars, as I had to ask for condiments including ketchup, but got offered the A1 sauce. I'll give the food server a one out of five stars as I they never said enjoy my food or anything to that effect. They just dropped it off and went away -goodbye. Typical Boulder."
Nate C.,"Boulder, CO",5,11,,1.0,4/28/2015,"Me and my husband were out for the evening and were looking to get a bite to eat. The thing is, I am one of the most forgiving customers you will ever have...and this place still made me angry.  To start...the food was really terrible. The appetizer was chili verde on fries. It was plopped on the plate with little attention to detail. The presentation was sloppy and uninviting. I had the the chicken club with bacon. The chicken had no flavor and the consistency of a dry sponge. The fries were obviously frozen and deep fried. My husband had the Maui Maui with some sort of citrus rice. The fish was dry, flavorless, and very poorly prepared. But the worst part of the dish was the rice. It was half boiled and tasted like they squeezed a bunch of lemon juice on it.  Next, the service. We were seated by a very nice host, who was joking and inviting. However, our server was obviously disinterested in providing us a decent dining experience. He took forever to get our drinks and never once asked us about a refill. When the entrees arrived, he never came to ask how the food tasted. Again, I'm a very forgiving customer. I have worked food service in the past, so I understand how demanding of a job it can be. I always try to find something positive to justify leaving some type of gratuity, but I honestly couldn't justify even leaving a $1.  Overall, the experience was over-priced and abysmal. BEWARE!!! Do not eat here. I'm not sure how they are still in business. We will not be returning."
Jay A.,"Denver, CO",0,39,,2.0,10/1/2016,The beer they brew is bad. The food they serve is bad. Atmosphere is fun.
Alex M.,"Lakewood, CO",1,18,22,5.0,9/7/2015,This restaurant was probably perfect! The food was amazing. The service was amazing. And the surroundings where amazing! I love this place and will definitely be back soon. Good job BJ's!!
Cindy H.,"Littleton, CO",2,20,7,4.0,8/21/2014,"After moving our daughter into her dorm, we were famished!  After stumbling across BJs we stopped to eat.  Although the service was a bit slow, our server was very nice and personable.   I very much enjoyed my California Chicken Club, it was delicious!  They even got my 'Sally' request correctly and put the garlic mayonnaise on the side, (this does not always occur at restaurants).  My husband and daughter both enjoyed the classic burger.  I was thrilled that they had two types of fries to choose from - shoestring and wedges!  As I LOVE wedges, while my family enjoys the other.  I would definitely return!"
Taylor D.,"Broomfield, CO",16,12,,4.0,4/11/2015,"My boyfriend and I FINALLY decided to try this place out. I was definitely surprised by the menu (and that a pasta dish is more expensive than the mahi mahi my boyfriend got). I decided to get the pulled pork sandwich with their seasoned wedges and no slaw (not a fan). The sandwich was amazing and so were the fries! There wasn't too much sauce (just right). I shared it with my boyfriend who also got the mahi mahi. He liked it but thought it could use more of the glaze or whatever was on the fish. After we decided to get a dessert and it was amazing! We got one of the cookie things with the ice cream. We decided on the Oreo one and all I have to say is... Get one. I would go back more for the dessert than the meal!  The only downside to the visit is that our server seemed sort of overwhelmed. I got my drink and it was empty throughout my meal and was never refilled, he never asked. My boyfriend got a beer and loved it, but he didn't get a refill, and a lot of the time servers will bring him a water just in case, and this waiter didn't."
Megan E.,"Columbus, OH",79,296,51,3.0,1/4/2013,"I would say 2.5 - we came here after the movies for a pick-me-up.  I had the mac & cheese and DH ordered the wontons and a root beer. The mac & cheese was ok - creamy but not really with cheese so much as butter and stuff, I wanted it to be thicker and have more cheese.   The root beer was good though, and DH enjoyed his dish, although with $3 and 3 pieces, it was a bit steep. Service was slow and the place is loud, I think overall I liked the old location better but it's worth giving them a shot for yourself, just don't come on game day if you want it to be quiet!"
Tiffany P.,"Gulf Breeze, FL",30,5,4,4.0,12/29/2013,"Lunch on Sunday afternoon, at the start of a Broncos game. The place filled up quickly. Our server (Raphael??) was very nice and attentive. Made recommendations that we enjoyed.   Boneless wings were moist and spicy. We also tried the stuffed mushrooms, great  sauce on them. Yum.  Pizza was ok. Hubby really liked it. I liked the crust brushed with garlic butter.  Great flavor but not overly garlicky.    Great atmosphere too. Sports bar area but felt more grown up."
Ariel S.,"Silverthorne, CO",150,36,67,3.0,1/17/2016,Food was good. Service was ok- he seemed distracted watching football. Manager did his job well making sure we were ok!
Mary M.,"Boulder, CO",10,68,3,1.0,2/15/2016,"I have been frequenting BJ's since they were on Pearl St. Mall.  My kids love it there.  We usually sit in the same booth every time we go, and my 2 boys always request that we eat dinner there.  I was entertaining friends, and their kids there for my son's birthday, and realized that I'd left my wallet at home.  Obviously, I was trying to keep this information from my guests because I excused myself from the table and went to speak to my waiter in private.  I told my waiter of my embarrassing situation, and requested the bill and told him I'd be back in less than 20 minutes.  What happened next was so mortifying!  The manager and waiter come up to the table and I got up to meet them, because, again, I was embarrassed by the situation already. The female manager asks me for my drivers license....   Um....  I just told you people I didn't have my wallet.  I gave you my address, and I'm with a table full of kids.  I offered to leave my purse there for her, but she declined... I'm not going to go through a extravagant story just to dine and dash!  Then, as we were leaving the restaurant, the female manager and another male manager were up front just staring at us as we left!  I came back in less than 15 minutes and paid.  I told the female manager how absolutely awkward she had made things, and they have now lost a longtime regular, who has never spent less than $85 in a visit.  She actually looked at me and told me that she just had a family walk on their bill last week.  I wonder if that family approached their waiter and explained their situation and expressed their intention to come back and pay.  Mistakes happen, and I would never have treated someone like a criminal! On a side note.  We were there for an hour and 15 minutes, and my son didn't get his birthday dessert or a birthday song to him because of all of this ruckus.  Thanks, BJ's!  Never again."
Alina J.,"Superior, CO",0,24,,4.0,9/12/2015,"Love this spot on weekends.  If Joe W. was our server everytime, I would definitely be giving 5 stars.  We walk in and I don't even have to order my green tea, it's at the table with our water right when he walks up! The food is better too, it's like Joe knows how to put orders in properly to get the best result!  I love the deep dish ravioli, but I replace the pepperoni & sausage with ground beef.  He also gives great recommendations.  If you stop over, make sure you ask for Joe as your server & you will not be disappointed with the service!"
Leigh Z.,"Austin, TX",0,287,135,4.0,6/27/2015,Went in for dinner with my family on a Sat night but were there early....like a bit after five....So they weren't super busy yet. We were seated immediately and our waiter was efficient and helpful. The drinks and the food we ordered was very good.
Linda C.,"Denver, CO",0,38,,5.0,6/12/2016,"We were greeted by friendly people. Our waitress was amazing. The food was delicious! This was our third visit to this location and we have yet to be disappointed!! We ordered the mozzarella and tomato salad to start. It was out of this world fantastic!! I wanted to take about five more orders of it home with me. The dressing was fresh and tasty and the tomatoes were just the right ripeness.  So, so yummy!!! My husband ordered the BJ's favorite pizza - as he always does. It did not let him down. (I don't like pizza, but I like this pizza.) I ordered the chicken and quinoa dish. (Don't remember it's ""official"" name.)The chicken was cooked to perfection! Very moist and flavorful. I liked the quinoa which was flavored with spinach, tomatoes and other good stuff. I loved it. My only ""complaint"" was that it had a sort of lemony flavor and I'm not a fan of lemony things. I looked at the menu and there was no mention of lemon. Next time I would order it and ask them to omit whatever gave it that aspect. (The server said they use several different types of oils and that it probably came from one of the oils.) I cannot remember the server's name, but she was GREAT! She did an excellent job and had a fun sense of humor. She seemed to genuinely enjoy being there. She said she has the mozzarella salad for lunch with avocado if that helps the manager identify her!  So, I'm going to end on a negative note. We dined there at 5:00 on Friday June 10th and it was FREEZING in there!!! My husband never gets cold and HE thought it was very cold as well. I think they were anticipating a big crowd later and were just trying to get ahead of things. We always have dessert, but were too cold. We drive from Lakewood to come to this BJ's. It is worth the drive!! You've got to try it! Wear long sleeves, though."
Michael B.,"Boulder, CO",11,3,,2.0,11/1/2015,My girlfriend and I visited this restaurant the other night and were not totally happy. The food was okay but it took about an hour to turn our table when the restaurant was really slow. We were trying to make a movie and we were almost late to that because it took 40 minutes to prep my fish tacos and her burger.
