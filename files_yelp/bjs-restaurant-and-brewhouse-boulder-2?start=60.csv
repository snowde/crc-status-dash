D B.,"Albuquerque, NM",1,37,177,4.0,7/25/2015,Best fish tacos in town. And Happy Hour half off wine by bottle or glass.
Katie G.,"Boulder, CO",179,25,,2.0,1/20/2015,Crappy pedestrian food. Everything I've had is either bland or overly salty without having any other flavor. The beer is good though.
Wyatt J.,"Renton, WA",0,2,2,3.0,9/13/2014,Just ate most of a pazookie. Feel ok. This place is dimly lit hard to read menu if you have night blindness. Had beer too it tasted okay but pazookie doesn't pair well. Good day.
Skip T.,"Brighton, CO",12,38,5,5.0,5/31/2015,"Talk about an extensive menu! If you can't find something to eat here, I don't know what to tell you. I had a burger, my wife had a salad. We both liked our food. The best part, though, was the beer. The manager, Cody, brought us a few tasters if some of their rotational brews that were amazing. My wife, Toni, even liked their session IPA, a first. I liked all of them, which isn't all that surprising. Overall, great experience. Good food, good beer, and Cody really made us feel right at home. Thanks, we'll be back!"
Miriam P.,"San Diego, CA",44,106,19,3.0,3/19/2015,Good service and pretty good food.  I've been to this location of BJ's twice - both on company luncheons.  I've tried the Greek chicken tacos and the Asian chopped salad.  Both delicious choices.
Alissa R.,"Tucson, AZ",285,296,470,3.0,5/29/2013,"This is solely based on the bar experience here. We were on our way to a hike in Estes Park when I had had just WAY too much car time (hate riding in cars for an extended amount of time) I was craving a bloody mary and spotted this place.  Welcomed by a friendly hostess we headed straight to the long bar, where the Bartender was quick to help us. My friend sampled a few ciders before deciding on a great lavender infused one. My bloody mary was not only tasty and spicy, but it did the job and the rest of the drive to Estes Park was much more tolerable.  We did not order any food but the menu is expansive and very chain oriented, something for everyone."
Margaret C.,"Boulder, CO",514,511,105,4.0,2/24/2013,"Saturday night was my first time trying BJ's in the new location.   A friend was celebrating something and chose this restaurant.    The menu here seemed to have more choices than it had when it was on Pearl St.   I wasn't really hungry as I have been ill during the past week or so. The other people at our table ordered pasta dishes.   I ordered a sandwich.   Mine was fine.  The others liked theirs. What was really outstanding, though, was our service.   The place was fairly crowded when we first arrived.   From beginning to end, though, we received excellent service.  That was nice. I have read the other reviews and can only conclude that there has been some effort on the part of this restaurant to improve."
Nicollette R.,"Louisville, CO",26,4,,3.0,4/4/2015,The Meals were absolutely delicious but service was terrible! Sat at the table for 15-20 minutes before I had to get up and just tell someone we haven't been asked for drinks or if we were ready! Of course once we got orders in they were ready within minutes. And there was no wait and not a lot of people in the place.
Vincent V.,"Seattle, WA",83,181,276,1.0,1/28/2013,"Very courteous and helpful service. Except for the tacos, the food appears too salty. Shrimp scampi comes with heavily seasoned (salt and lemon juice) which may appeal to you if you're a heavy drinker. When the waitress offered to ask the kitchen to make it less intense they made a new dish exactly the same way. The shrimp tasted good though. For all of BJ's attempt to offer a healthier cuisine, such as the lower calorie menu options, they still appear to have a lot of work ahead in the sodium (and sugar) department."
Marianne L.,"Boulder, CO",212,142,34,4.0,12/2/2015,"BJ's may not be the snazziest or hippest place to eat, but it certainly is dependable in terms of flavor.  My husband may have had the best cooked chicken breast of his life one time, only to get the normal, average, slightly-dry chicken breast the next.  So the jury is out on that one.  I however, enjoyed my steak and salmon that I've ordered so far.  They seem to be busy every time we've gone - and of course I signed up for the VIP program.  I think that it's a reasonably priced meal for the qualify of food that you receive.  The s'mores dessert is WAY TOO SWEET though.  So I wouldn't necessarily recommend this place for desserts because it seems like all their desserts are overly sweet.  Give me good flavor with a pleasant amount of sweetness anytime, but holy moly it was way too sweet for me.  Anyways, I like to think that this place will become a place I frequent regularly for good ol' American food."
Kristen G.,"Richardson, TX",26,27,,3.0,8/22/2014,"This BJ's is sort of disappointing. If you come when business is slow, then everything is great. However, if you come when it is busy, service is so slow it takes your waitress forever to even take your orders and the food coming out is even slower. But like I said, during non-peak times this place is great. The food is sooooo good. I recommend the avocado egg rolls, calamari, clam chowder, and any deep dish pizza. The spicy jalapeño burger is also a must have. As for drinks, try the Buffalo Bite. It is surprisingly amazing. My only complaint besides them not being able to handle a packed house would be the price. The food is good, but it isn't worth what it is priced at."
C M.,"Cincinnati, OH",34,21,8,3.0,12/3/2014,BJs Brewhouse has some things I love and some things not so much.  Avocado spring rolls are my favorite!  I would drive out of my way for those.  Their beer is decent.  Burgers and sandwiches are pretty good.  Love the small bites menu!  Not a fan of the deep dish pizza though.  It's all bread!  Deep dish pizzas should be loaded with meat and cheese and yumminess and not a loaf of bread with some sauce and thins slices of pepperoni on top.  Avoid the pizza and you will enjoy the restaurant.
Elaine Z.,"Boulder, CO",19,159,10,2.0,3/8/2013,"We went on a Friday evening around 7ish, the wait was only about 3 minutes.   Busy, but the server was prompt and enthusiastic.  Very enthusiastic.  Made me wonder about his caffeine intake, but his service was excellent. I got the crispy chicken sandwich.  The chicken was dry, the bread decent, soft and not too crunchy.  The skinny fries were good.  Hubby got the gluten free pizza.  I tried a piece.  It was soggy and unappetizing, like a cheap frozen pizza that's been shoved to the back of the freezer.  The kind you eventually offer to your babysitter because you just don't want to have to eat it but don't want to throw it out.   Also, what's up with the plates?  The mozzarella sticks came out on a square plate.  I can accept square plates on the basis of easier storage, but frequently I find I need to turn the plate around to easier access something on it, and it's much easier to do with a round plate.  My sandwich and fries came out on an oval one, which I'll accept as a nod to sandwiches in those oval baskets, even though it forced them to cut my sandwich into an odd shape.   But the pizza . . . the ROUND pizza . . . came out on a TRIANGULAR plate.  Whose bright idea was THAT?   Also tried the Strawberry Patch.  Kind of like a pina colada, but with strawberries.  Not strong at all.  There were more drinks on the menu that I would want to try than any of the food.  Yeah.  I'm a sissy drinker, but if you put strawberries in it you'll get my attention."
Jim K.,"Denver, CO",66,40,10,5.0,11/23/2014,"Not crowded, not noisy. Promptly sat, great service and great food. Try the ""brewnette"" ale and scallops- highly recommended!"
Joel F.,"Denver, CO",22,123,14,3.0,5/3/2013,"Hi folks, thanks for coming to BJs, I will give you 35 minutes to read through our menu, or you can wait for the feature length movie to come out. I am not going to bash my experience, the server was great, the food was tasty, and the meal not TOO pricey. This is a solid neutral place to take the family or a medium to large group. There is something for everyone, and it will be decent. Though not a vegetarian, I try to watch how much meat I eat, and there were several meatless options that were real creations! Beer was good.... Sum it up: I'm not telling people to go out of their way to go here, but I am not stopping anyone from enjoying it either!"
Danny R.,"Boulder, CO",117,31,7,2.0,2/12/2013,"Maybe the best thing about BJ's is that you can say ""LET'S GO GET SOME BEEJAYS"" like Paul Rudd when you plan to go there. That's an unpaid endorsement for the film ""I Love You Man"", it has nothing to do with this restaurant.  I work really close to BJ's and we used to come here for happy hour a lot. It feels like what it is- a big corporate restaurant that tries to pass itself off as a microbrewery.  The service here is super slow. Always. The happy hour pricing isn't even that good. That's why we stopped going here. Now me and my co-workers to to Cantina Laredo up the street, which isn't great either, but it's got a better happy hour.  I work in retail. Stop judging me."
Mark L.,"McKinney, TX",5,10,1,4.0,12/9/2014,Consistent food across the nation. Highly recommend the Ahi Tuna Salad.
Mike B.,"Denver, CO",1,3,,1.0,11/15/2012,"Went in to meet a large group, and it was packed so I went to the bar to get a beer because the wait staff was ""taking a while."" I tried for five minutes to get the bartenders' attention and couldn't even get eye contact. Gave up and left. The floor was also waxed almost to the point of being a skating rink. I'm sure the food is the same mediocre junk you'll find at any BJ's, but the service here was extraordinarily bad."
Leanne G.,"Lafayette, CO",405,345,293,3.0,3/18/2013,"This is a large restaurant in Boulder, which we don't have that many of. That means you have a good chance of getting a table without a long wait, even if you have a large party and its peak mealtime. The food is OK. Nothing really incredible, but good. Its a great place for children while being classier than Chili's, but not much different than California Pizza Kitchen. I like that they brew their own beer. However, its my favorite that they brew their own SODA! My favorite is the Cream Soda or the Root Beer. So while its not my favorite, I like going there and think its got a place in the Boulder dining community."
Dan F.,"Denver, CO",0,29,1,1.0,9/12/2015,"I love paying $2.75 for club soda (that's per glass folks!). When I seek refreshment in the form of BUBBLED WATER to wash down horribly over salted food at a overpriced pretentious eatery, I head on over to BJ's Brewhouse. I recommend avoiding the burgers, quest sauce, chicken lettuce wraps and ahi tuna salad. That is, of course, unless you crave salt like a deer at a salt lick. Button down shirts aren't fooling anyone!"
