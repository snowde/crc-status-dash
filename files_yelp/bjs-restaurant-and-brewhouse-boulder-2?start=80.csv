Jim M.,"Boulder, CO",0,11,,5.0,9/11/2014,"Having A glass of wine when the nameplate on a beer tap breaks lose falling on and breaking my wine carafe.  They cleaned up quickly, disposed of the ice in the bin behind the counter and comped my wine.  Problems can happen but how they recovered was top notch service.  Nice work BJ's!"
Ashley W.,"Longmont, CO",0,26,7,2.0,11/12/2013,"Service SUCKS, SUCKS, SUCKS.  Wait forever before a waiter wanders over, acting like you are an inconvenience to them.  Tall blond super skinny dude is one of them.  ""Sorry, not my table"" he tells me after I am waiting FOREVER for someone to take my order.  Too bad as the food isn't half bad."
Michelle B.,"Boulder, CO",4,3,,4.0,7/20/2014,Sunday night with my husband at around 6:45. Had good samples of beer. Hubby had a pepperoni pizza said it was okay and I had the Mediterranean and it was the best pizza I've ever had. Service was great.  Had the cards game on too-go STL cardinals!  Price was as expected.
Mark H.,"Parker, CO",10,370,110,3.0,12/31/2013,This particular BJ's has had some pretty rough reviews. I'll say from the dinner experience we had everything was just fine. We got in about 5:30 and was sat with no issues service started immediately with some cold beers and appetizers. Our entrées didn't take too long nor did desert. Overall a good experience. The food is a little bit more upscale casual but it still fairly sports bar oriented. I would have no issue coming back to this restaurant again.
Jim J.,"Salida, CO",0,2,,3.0,3/24/2016,"the waitress was great i did not like the ahi salad she took  it back, the bartender knew how to make a martini but when i ordered the caesar salad disliked the croutons...do not say the croutons are oven baked when clearly they come out of a bag!"
Stephen B.,"Longmont, CO",4,11,,2.0,2/23/2014,"My family of  four went last night around 9:30 pm. For a Saturday night neither the bar area or the  restaurant appeared busy. There were several servers, busboys,and managers working. We were seated in a booth and assured our  server  would  be right over. Several of the staff passed by  our  table. After about 10 minutes, I told my wife that if no one came to our table be ]fore I  counted to 30, I would go to the  hostess stand to let them know we were still waiting on a server. Just then our  server showed up with two glasses of water for the  four of us, which I found odd. Why did she  only have 2 glasses of water? Incidentally, I told her that two glasses were plenty. If her plan was to bring us water, why not  bring all four at the same time. So, now  we have water. She was not ready to take our  drink order because she had to take care  of another table, so she left. Now I am feeling like the service is pretty poor. I have been to plenty of BJs locations, but this was my first time at the new one in Boulder. My wife and I both worked  in restaurants in college, so I am willing to give the waiter a pass if it is busy, or if they were double or triple sat. I surveyed the area, watched what our server was doing, and decided she was not ""in the weeds"". We finally got  our  drink order placed, and then our food order. The food was typically BJs quality. I have no complaints there. Through out the meal our server checked on us once twice, and left me waiting a fairly long time for my second beer.  Overall the service was mediocre. I am not really sure what the issue was with the server. Maybe lack of training, or maybe she just did not want to be there. She was nice enough and did not  give off that I am bothered by customers vibe that you  can get some times.  I will go here again, but when I pay a premium compared to say, Red Robin, or Chili's, I expect better. Continued poor service and I'll cross this location off my list."
Dalton M.,"Boulder, CO",0,2,,1.0,4/12/2015,"Absolutely the WORST my girlfriend and I have ever been treated at a restaurant. As two people who work for multi-million dollar companies that specialize in a great customer experience, I will never return to this restaurant. As soon as we walked in the door the hostess and waitresses gave my girlfriend and I dirty looks. Yes, I understand that we had been hiking prior to this, but that is no excuse for the way we were treated. After being seated our waitress took our drink order, then proceeded to stand next to the hostess (in my very plain field of view) and snicker and point at us. They made my girlfriend feel awful, and they should be ashamed of that."
John S.,"Boulder, CO",0,63,3,3.0,11/21/2014,Surprisingly good. It's got the chain restaurant feel but I have to say that the food is consistent and service usually perfectly fine.
Nellie S.,"Boulder, CO",0,1,,1.0,3/23/2015,"This used to be a staple when I was back in HB, CA years ago, so I was excited that they had one out here to grab a later meal and watch a game. However, I've been here about 10 different occasions now with the s.o. and friends over the past couple of years and every single time the service is AWFUL. As a manager of a local restaurant, I would write up my servers immediately if they gave the service they do to me here. I'm not even being picky but when one of the servers asks me a question and I answer directly yet politely and they continuously serve me improper food and never once apologize, I'm going to get mad. The tenth time tonight was the last time."
Erin Maguire P.,"Longmont, CO",1,7,,1.0,3/8/2014,"We have been eating at BJ's for 15 years. It is normally high quality. Today was DISGUSTING. I have eaten better burgers at Carl's Jr. The patty was charred and falling apart. The bun was stale, all food was cold. My husbands southern friend chicken was a three inch chicken finger. My daughter's mac and cheese looked like it had sat out all day. It was SO BAD and I am SO disappointed. I expect WAY more from a successful brewery and restaurant."
Matt S.,"Boulder, CO",0,10,,2.0,2/22/2013,"My girlfriend and I went here to meet some friends and were excited to try the place after having a good experience at the one on pearl street.  Finding a parking space took no less then ten minutes, but thankfully our friends had come early and already gotten a table. The waitress DID show up within a few minutes of us sitting down, but that was the only good thing she did. It took over 20 minutes to get water, the appetizers we ordered when we first sat down didn't show up until we complained to the manager. And at that point more then 60 minutes had passed. On more then one occasion the waitress forgot what we even had ordered and had to be reminded. The manager ended up giving us the appetizers and a round of drinks for free. I still don't think I'd go back, hopefully they can improve their service for others."
Ash C.,"Boulder, CO",4,52,32,3.0,3/18/2013,"First words of advice - - DON'T TRY THE PASTA HERE! We went here on a very busy Friday night, and it was packed. Good atmosphere, what i would expect from an all American family dining place with a sports type bar. We were seated pretty quickly and drinks came out on time.  I ordered one of the chicken pasta dishes can't remember exactly what it was. My pasta-  It came out lukewarm and soggy and flavorless. Theres really nothing to describe it except those 3 words. I wasn't that hungry to begin with so I just ate the artichokes and some salad. My friend who didn't order anything else but her pasta really couldn't stand hers. My pasta's chicken wasn't burnt like hers. She called a manager over and they sorted it out. She got a different entree altogether and was very pleased with one of the burgers. The fries that came with were very good! When the manager asked about my pasta dish, I just said I'd rather not get anything else, and that although mine was cold and flavorless and soggy as well, I ate most of the chicken so I wasn't expecting a totally new dish. When my bill came I was surprised that my entree was waived. I felt bad that they did that, since I ate most of my chicken and artichokes. I just didn't touch the spaghetti itself. But that was very thoughtful of them.  Service was great. The waiter was attentive even on a busy night and he was more than happy to bring the new dishes and ask how it was.  Food. The pizzas here are really delicious! So i assumed the pastas would be as well. Next time I'll just get pizza or a burger. The salads are pretty decent as well. I hope the next time I go and decide on a pasta, they will have changed something."
Karyn S.,"Lyons, CO",10,20,2,3.0,11/30/2012,"First time here, and enjoyed it. The food was pretty good and not excessive, although the calzone was a little small. The price wasn't too bad for 5 of us. We got out for $70, which is sometimes rare in this town. As far as service, we had no problems. The waitress was responsive and kept us watered and taken care of.  Yeah, I'd go back."
Peyton M.,"Longmont, CO",14,3,,4.0,9/14/2014,"Went in on a busy Sat. night before Buff game, Steve was our server, top notch! Food came out piping hot, just The way I like it. The specialty fried chicken is excellent."
Shana M.,"Louisville, CO",0,9,,1.0,11/30/2012,"This is not a good choice for dinner - at least it wasn't for us.   We sat for 15 minutes without being noticed by any waitstaff.. even though they walked by us several times waiting on other tables. We were ready to leave and possibly hop across the street to Baker Street Pub ... instead someone walked close enough to us that  I literally had to grab him to get his attention.  Yes, 2 minutes later... a waitress shows up.. hallelujah!  This was 8:00 pm, so not the busy dinner rush.  We ordered two entrees - a 'cobb' salad and a lemon chicken pasta dish. The pasta was horrible.  It was as if they had spilled a full salt shaker's contents on top of our dish.. it was extremely salty.  My husband likes salt and most of the time will even add salt to his food, but even he said this was over-the-top... WAY over the top on the salt, not edible.   So, the cobb salad was strange.  Not your usual cobb... it was tiny pieces of chopped, what looked like iceberg lettuce, a little bacon, crumbled feta I believe, and really unsure what else was on that salad.  It was also very salty.  Actually we weren't sure if it was just the massive salt in our mouths still from the pasta that we were still tasting, but nonetheless... not a good salad.  This food was WAY sub par for the price, and the service was lacking. When we told our waitress about our disappointment with our food, she did send out the manager to talk to us.  The manager seemed to insinuate that we were making up the salt thing... she said 'huh, not sure why it would taste like salt when we don't even add salt to that sauce...'... and 'maybe it was the ranch dressing... that can be salty'...    I don't know, it was SALTY manager, so please believe us and give us some credit.  Anyway, she took the food off of the bill, and so we paid for our beers and were on our way.... never to return.  Still hungry.  At least the beer gave us some nourishment until we could get home and eat PBJ's.   Sad, because we had been to the BJ's on Pearl Street back in the day, and it was really good food (pizza) and an enjoyable atmosphere/experience overall.  We also had lunch at the Westminster location previously and it was much better food and service than this location."
Amy H.,"Boulder, CO",36,92,,2.0,12/17/2012,"Given this new location a couple of tries, and have found myself consistently disappointed.  Today was an all-time low.  It took our server 10+ minutes to come and take our drink order.  My tomato soup tasted great but looked disgusting: the oil (how much is in there?) had separated from the rest of the soup.  It was so unappetizing I almost couldn't eat it.  We then waited maybe 20+ minutes for our lunch entrees.  Mine was delicious (a vegetarian pasta), but a very small portion, even for lunch; our daughter's kid's spaghetti was larger than mine.  They forgot to bring our daughter her applesauce, left my drink unfilled for quite a while, and seemed generally disinterested in our business.  The food is meh, the service poor, and the parking impossible.  I think it will be awhile before we go back, which is too bad, since they do have great lunch specials and offer a seated-style lunch when other places like Red Robin have gone the way of the dodo."
