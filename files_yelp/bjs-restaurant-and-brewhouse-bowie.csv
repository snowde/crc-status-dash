Angela P.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",5,17,,4.0,1/6/2018,"Better than we expected! Will definitely go back! Pros: The food was very fresh! Very tasty and had great combinations.  Wide variety to choose from. Waitress was knowledgeable about the brews.  Cons: The wait was an hour.  Once we got to our table and ordered, the food took a very long time to come out. One of our orders was wrong. The taste of the food was worth the wait."
Benjamin G.,"Norfolk, VA",0,16,,1.0,1/10/2018,"The manager himself admitted the place was terrible and needed ""serious work"".  That's all you really need to know."
Carol-Lynn S.,"Washington, DC",80,2,,2.0,12/30/2017,"Ok, so I went for a class reunion/holiday celebration.  The place is nice, and it was certainly crowded.  Reservations were made in advance by our party planner/classmate and followed up the day before and the day of our get together.  I was running late, but when I arrived, some of my classmates were already at the bar and having a great time.  Good service, great drinks, etc.  But when we moved to our table (and we were about 14-16 people), that's when the trouble began.  We sat for at least 35 minutes before anyone even came over.  Clearly, this is a new place and they are working out the ""kinks"" in service. But why are we asking for water when the waiter finally came over?  And why is there only one waiter for such a large party?  Not good.  Several of us went to the bar to get our drinks and paid there.  There was an awesome Mother/daughter duo (cannot remember their names) who were super attentive!   Thanks for them, BJs!  They are awesome!  And, shout out to Malachi ...he really did the best he could with the circumstances he was presented with.  He was sweet and patient, but this establishment needs to provide ongoing customer service training, from basic service as well as ensuring that you don't just ""disappear"" for 30 minutes without checking on your tables.   I would go on a tangent about that ""manager"" who came to our table and was basically condescending and disrespectful when our planner expressed her feelings about the late food, wrong food, etc.....but I will allow her the opportunity.  But I will say....it was BAD! Shout out to Desmond....he is the BEST!  Got everything together and made sure we will visit again....and I will; as long as he is there! Will probably do the bar area, until they figure out how to accommodate large parties.  They are new, so I know I need to give them some time.   And BTW, shout out to the chef...because my prime rib was AMAZING!  I did have some overcooked asparagus, but everything else was yummy!"
Talisha R.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",51,107,96,4.0,12/13/2017,"My husband and I had a wonderful experience when we visited BJ's. The place hasn't been open a month and all these non relevant reviewers with less than ten reviews, give this restaurant a bad review. I hope they visit again in 6 months and provide a update. Anyway, we visited on a Saturday and it was about a 20 min wait. Once we were seated, we ordered drinks and this huge $20 appetizer. It had mozzarella sticks, chicken wings, spinach artichoke dip and avocado egg rolls. As much as I love avocados I couldn't stomach those egg rolls. Just not for me, but I'm sure someone would like it. My husband ordered the deep dish pizza and I got the flat bread pizza. Everything was good and we followed it up with their signature dessert, the pizooke cookie with ice cream. We got the snickerdoodle one and it was heaven. We enjoyed every bite of it. This is definitely a great addition to Bowie and I look forward to many more visits. I also love that they have TV's all over the restaurant and not just at the bar."
Cameron B.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",328,73,51,4.0,11/26/2017,"What a nice addition to BTC this restaurant is!  I stopped by with a friend on Wednesday around 5 to check the place out and I am really glad I did.  We were greeted immediately by the host and directed to the bar area. The bar section has a long bartop with about 15 bar chairs as well as 10 or so high top tables.  We were able to grab two bar spots immediately, but by 6pm the whole bar was packed. We were greeted immediately by 2 different bartenders -- love the friendly service!  They made us rum and cokes which were a part of the $5 happy hour 3pm - 7pm special.  I did notice that the drinks made by the bartender weren't consistent.  One round would be strong and punch you in the throat while the next round was weaker and more like juice.  One round came with a lime...while the next round didn't.  Maybe those kinks will get ironed out in the weeks to come. The food is solid!  We ordered a $6 happy hour burger and fries as well as a cookies and cream pazookie.  I really enjoyed the burger and crispy fries but the dessert was the star of the show.  The have a whole menu page dedicated to their delicious pazookies! Definitely do yourself a favor and order one! While ordering food from the bar, we did notice another area of improvement -- food came out from the back for folks at the bar and the waitstaff didn't seem to have any idea who the food was supposed to go to. The waitstaff walked up and down the bar line asking each patron if this was their order.  Any dishonest bar goer could have had several free plates just by saying 'yup, thats mine'.  Help the waitstaff out and develop a better system to find the foods proper owner please! All in all, a great evening.  Loved the environment and the buzz of the place.  The menu is HUGE so I will definitely be back to try some more items and of course, get another pazookie!"
Joseph G.,"New York, NY",196,166,866,4.0,12/20/2017,"I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was pleased when we walked in. There was a 30 minute wait, that somehow was shortened to 5 minutes, YOU GET A STAR!!!! The server was pleasant, but as time went on, quite inattentive and that was reflected in the tip situation. Dawta, pay attention and you will be rewarded HANDSOMELY!!! I do not ask for special attention, menus, not a visit from the chef, just do your job well.  All of my dinner companions enjoyed what they ordered. I recommend the brussel sprouts. I also recommend the root beer drink. There is alcohol in it, but if you enjoy root beer, this is the drink for you. I heard good things about the sangria, and strawberry lemonade drinks, both alcoholic.  My only other gripe besides the service was the steak, too salty! I think the chef has low blood pressure, or a heavy hand. I think my blood pressure is STILL high. Besides that, we loved it. I'd certainly return."
Cindy W.,"Bowie, MD",151,35,83,4.0,12/7/2017,"Service was awesome! I loved the cherry chipotle and Nashville hot wings! The BJs Tavern Pizza was great and I had some left over for work the next day. For dessert, we had the pizookie trio! More specifically, The snickerdoodle, monkey bread and chocolate chip pizookoe. I thought each one was bomb. The snickerdoodle one is seasonal but was the best one. Each were topped with ice cream.  I've been to both the Laurel and Bowie location now. The Bowie one is my fave. I'm so glad they opened this new location!  This restaurant is a bit pricey but the food is great. Drinks didn't thrill me."
Jay H.,"Greater Landover, MD",93,57,83,4.0,12/5/2017,So how come no one told me that they opened a BJ's in bowie?  I just so happen to have a friend in town and I had her searching through yelp for a place for dinner and she asked me about BJ's in bowie.  I was shocked that there was a closer one to me than Laurel.  So we went immediately. Service:  This is a new location and I was impressed that the servers were very well versed and on top of their game.  All the food came out quickly and well timed out between courses.  It was a seamless process.  I wasn't disappointed in the least.   Food:  The reason why I love BJ's is because of the expansive menu.  I love that I can literally go and try something new every time.  This time I ordered some items from the happy hour menu.  The root  beer glazed ribs were very tender and had a great flavor.  They are very sticky but I like that they aren't enormous ribs.  Very dainty and easy to eat.  They aren't fall off the bone but they aren't tough.  Calamari nothing too special.  I really get the calamari for the sauces.  The lemon sauce and marinara sauces really compliment the tender calamari.  The spinach stuffed mushrooms were just ok.  They could use a little more flavor but they still weren't bad.  The stars of my night ...the pizookies!  These little desserts are to die for!  The salted caramel pizookie was my FAVORITE!  oh so delicious.  The only pizookie I didn't care for was the pizookie triple chocolate and that was due to the chocolate ice cream on top.  It tasted very imitation and not very good at all. I'll definitely return to try more items off the menu.
Kimberly J.,"Baltimore, MD",122,222,296,4.0,11/27/2017,"One word to sum up this experience: Pizookie! Omg... you have to come get one! It will change your life! Ok... I'll get back to my review now. We came to Bowie Town Center with every intention of going to another restaurant. While parking, my boyfriend noticed BJ's and said, ""well that's new! Maybe we should try that instead."" I agreed and we crossed over to BJ's parking lot and parked. The host told us the wait for 2 would be 15 mins so they allowed me to enter my number so they could send us a text when the table was ready (pretty cool!). We only waited 5 mins before our table was ready. Another hostess walked us to our table, gave us menus, explained the beer and wine options, told us about the food specials, and gave us food recommendations. She was pretty thorough and very helpful.  We had two servers, one in training and her trainer. Since they just opened, most of the servers were still in training. Even with training still happening, service was still great. The servers were prompt and came to check on us often. We looked at the beer menu, which had many great choices, but we decided to go for non alcoholic option, all which have unlimited refills. We tried the hand crafted sodas. I originally ordered the orange cream soda but the aftertaste was weird. I asked to switch to root beer and that was a much better choice. It was strong and sweet. The food menu is huge with many options. There's something there for everyone! I ordered the bacon guacamole Deluxe burger, which had pepperjack cheese, jalapenos, and chipotle mayo. It was pretty darn good. As a person who likes spicy food, it wasn't very spicy. If you are worried about it being too spicy, don't be because the kick is not strong at all. Their fries are good as well. My boyfriend enjoyed his prime rib sandwich but his side of broccoli was under-steamed to the point it was pretty much raw and tough. We saved room for dessert because we took one look at the monkey bread pizookie on the dessert menu and knew we couldn't leave without sharing one. It's pretty much warm monkey bread with vanilla ice cream on top. It was beyond words. I'm salivating just thinking about it! Sweet, warm, and buttery, with the richness of the ice cream. We had an incredible meal without breaking the bank. I would definitely come back again. Their lunch and happy hour specials are worth taking advantage of. And maybe a visit just to get a pizookie!"
Carmen M.,"Bowie, MD",0,15,25,5.0,12/20/2017,"I went here last night and I am in love. The atmosphere was great- loud enough to be fun but quiet enough that you don't have to shout to hear each other. The service is quick and the place is really attractive. There were a variety of seating styles, big booths, rounded, regular seating. The bar looked awesome too! The glass behind the bottles made the reflection look so cool. I got the shrimp and asparagus pasta with a garlic knot. My boyfriend had a burger with bacon and bbq sauce. We both loved it. The calamari was delicious and they offered both marinara and garlic aioli dip. BUT the show stopper was the dessert. We had the mini cookie skillet trip. White chocolate macadamia nut, chocolate chip, and cookies and cream, eat with a scoop of ice cream. Oh my god I cannot say enough about how magnificent they were. The cookies and cream was a choice on a whim but is by far my favorite. It would be part of my last meal if I was ever on death row. Try it out! It's a great place."
B H.,"Bowie, MD",22,81,24,3.0,12/21/2017,Great bar. Good happy hour.  Monday pizza night is the best night. Ribs night not worth it.   Waited two hours after being seated to get check. Table of two. Ribs and pizza ordered  waited 20+ minutes for dessert.  I hope they get it under control  love the location. Just left didn't wait for dessert !
Money M.,"Washington, DC",63,34,27,4.0,1/8/2018,first time here on january 7th n things went well i enjoyed the food i had pizza n wings pretty expensive but i may go back n the near future!!!!!
Benjamin L.,"San Diego, CA",0,1,,5.0,12/23/2017,"Great food, great staff! You should go! This was my wife and I's first visit. We had the stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer! Delicious! I had the Southern Comfort sandwich as an entree, which I recommend to anyone looking for something like a burger, but different. Delicious as well! That said, this place is new and popular. Long wait times for a seat and food are to be expected. We were able to skip the wait time by reserving ahead. If you're heading over there, I would recommend the same. Our food took a little bit of time to reach us, but it was worth every second. Finally, I want to shout out to our waiter, Kobe. He provided great customer service and was incredibly patient. For his service alone, I would consider coming back."
Michael Z.,"Baltimore, MD",5,5,28,2.0,12/8/2017,"Super long wait just to be seated, over 1hr. I don't know if it's a Friday night and folks are out shopping for the long wait. Even longer wait until we were even waited on just for drinks. Checked in at 5:45, seated at 6:42 and first food at 7:30.  Burger was ok, nothing really special. Was really messy. Hot ham and cheese sandwich was good as were sweet potato fries. Queso dip was ok. Waitress was all over the place."
Mark B.,"Glenarden, MD",6,12,,2.0,12/8/2017,"This is my first time in a Bjs restaurant I go there at the start of happy hour it had taken 45 minutes to get a burger 35 min for the mini pizza ,the burger had way undercooked bacon for anyone's liking ,crust on the deep dish pizza no crunch, not crispy. I did like the burger after I got them to cook the bacon, but that's just sooooo long to wait. I sat at the bar and my bartender Dee was great ,knowledgeable on the menu and the brews , and very pleasant. There was another bartender but she choose not to speak to me or offer any service for whatever reason . With that said I didn't complain but the server did pickup that they weren't doing to well and sent over a manager who was very nice and accommodating,  that goes along way with me but I was ready to just go been ther to long .  I Wil go back as another reviewer said  ( give them a chance to work out the kinks ) I see the potential."
Mark R.,"Bowie, MD",11,14,4,3.0,12/18/2017,"First time, new place. Looks good. went in for a afternoon bit around 1:30. Sat at the high tops in the bar. Server Shaela was very pleasant and knew the menu and beer... We ate small plates and beer sampler. Garlic Parm knots - Great Turmeric Cauliflower - good and tasty Hickory Smoked Sausage yummy especially with the pickled onions and pickles. Let it be know the sausage is room temp. surprised!! Seating a little cramped, and the severs walk between the tables. a little uncomfortable. We will try it again. They do give Military discount which few places do any more.... Thanks"
Jen H.,"Gambrills, MD",0,22,,2.0,1/1/2018,"My teacher and I went to this place the Friday before Christmas and it was terrible. I first heard about this place watching their holiday commercial (where the girl gets their dessert and brings it home to Santa) and I thought that it looked like a nice place and should try it. The experience turned out to be HORRIBLE. We waited an hour for our food, all I had was an appetizer (chips and salsa which were mediocre) and finally, my teacher and I decided to walk out without food. We did come like 4 days before and it was just mediocre. I understand that this is a fairly new restaurant and like all new restaurants, they are getting used to everything but they really need to step it up."
Grow u.,"Bowie, MD",45,42,25,4.0,12/30/2017,Went for their late night Happy Hour on Friday and it was a great experience. We sat at the bar and was served by Keshia excellent server knowledgeable and she can really make a drink. My typical 3 long islands turned in to 2 of her own creations. I'll definitely go again
Adam S.,"Washington, DC",101,8,,2.0,12/11/2017,"I get it. New restaurant still looking for a head chef but my food experience was horrible. Arrived around 6pm Sunday 12/10. My wife an I were quoted a 20 min wait but sat in about 5 min. I thought not bad for a place on a Sunday night. Seating is a little tight of you're a tall guy/gal and the overall decour was just a bunch of tvs... My waitress (name escapes me) stopped by and was pleasant. She was informative about the menu and what was what. My wife ordered a ahi tuna salad and I ordered the prime rib (medium). We place our food and drink order and they came at good time. The food however was the longest ever. I was informed that my wife's salad was done but my food was not. 20min turns into 40 and while we are debating to pay for the drinks and just leave the food comes. Food was ok came out warm and cooked to temp but an hour wait for a medium prime rib is ridiculous. After we eat my meal came with a dessert. I ordered the monkey bread pizzoki  they rave about. It takes another 30 min for the dessert and again as we were getting ready to leave it arrives. Not on the nice skillets but in some metal cheap dish. One scoop in and the bread wasn't done and no caramel sauce at all.  During this whole time the manager saw us but never came over to speak and didn't acknowledge out presence. As a restaurant person myself it's ridiculous for a manager to see a guest head in hands, no water, no drinks, or just a check in. Every table got spoken to. I don't go out for free food but the food I want and to mitigate these issues would be simple. Step 1. Hire another floor manager to check on guests or at least have two rotating so there is coverage.  Step 2. Staff levels in seemed high with such slow service. Waiteres and host bunched up at the host stand loudly talking. Start side work and send them home. Side note. (If the kitchen is backed up. Quote longer wait time to accommodate the wait. I'd rather wait thrn be seated and wait an hour for a meal.  Step 3. Hire an expediter for busy times or have the head of the kitchen to do quality checks. Standards of service is all we have between cooking at home and spending money.  Those are some suggestions that would greatly improve steps of service and keep guests coming back. For now I leave 2 stars. I'll return after the holiday season and see if it has changed as Bowie needs good spots to eat past 10pm. Best of luck."
James W.,"Capitol Heights, MD",0,2,,3.0,12/30/2017,"Our first time there. The spinach and artichoke dip wad very good. The jambalaya was tasty, and the ribs were great. Long lines, so we ate at the bar. Good service"
Ferne M.,"Bowie, MD",0,4,1,2.0,12/18/2017,Service was slow and wait staff was untrained  and unfamiliar with the wine choices and extensive menu. Took forever to get the bill and to run it thru the handheld check machine. Several people sent their food back because it was overcooked and not hot. Give it a few months to get the wait staff trained and get  the kitchen together.
Monica C.,"Silver Spring, MD",38,2,,1.0,12/13/2017,Worst experience ever !! We waited over an hour for our food . There was a big party of people that we understood but com'on !! Over an hour and no curtsey apps or anything . Very upset . The waiter was great but they need to have there staff prepared for unexpected situations.
Carlos P.,"Crofton, MD",7,14,6,2.0,12/11/2017,"First visit at this place. Ok experience. Typical ambiance of a sport bar. Food was ok, a bit overpriced ($11.75 for an appetizer). The mobile pay system didn't work. Will give them another chance but just ok for now. Nice to have a new place."
Debra C.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",0,1,,1.0,11/30/2017,I would wait and let them work out the kinks. Food wasn't bad but service was not good. The waiter was nice but several food items never showed up. To add insult to injury the bathroom wasn't clean. That is always the worst.  Hopefully they will improve and learn from the BJ's in Laurel!
Craig M.,"Bowie, MD",0,10,,2.0,12/9/2017,"Great beer selection and a wide menu, but the service/kitchen/bar is soooooo slowwwwwww"
Danielle L.,"Washington, DC",0,8,,5.0,11/29/2017,"My friend and I enjoyed a lovely dinner at BJ's. The food and service were wonderful. Our server was Koby, he was cheerful, attentive and his effervescent personality made it a really pleasant experience. My friend had the Hickory Brisket and Bacon Burger which was delicious, we tried the Root Beer glazed ribs which were yummy and Koby recommended the Snicker Doodle Pizookie for dessert which was phenomenal!"
J U.,"Glen Burnie, MD",169,7,,3.0,12/22/2017,"The drinks, selection and location are awesome.  The wait time for the food is horrible. Calamari and pizza should not be 30 Plus minutes to wait.  The food supply chain need work, but they just opened."
Britney N.,"Bowie, MD",0,2,,4.0,12/26/2017,"Great experience! We ordered their version on an appetizer sampler, baked ziti, turkey dip sandwich, medium bbq deep dish pizza, and two pizzookies (double chocolate and Oreo). The service staff was friendly but the kitchen staff could use some better ticket times. It look a little longer then we would've liked but the food came out hot and that's what matters! We took advantage of the $3 pizzookies and half off glasses of wine. Overall, my family would highly recommend this restaurant and fully plan on coming back again!"
Bre F.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",136,2,1,3.0,12/21/2017,The food is decent. I love the ribs here! The bartenders are really pleasant. The service on the other hand? HORRIFIC. Be prepared to wait a while. It's too many restaurants around to be waiting 45+ minutes for an appetizer! New restaurant cool I understand but come on now? I should never have to wait that long for food!
Nancy B.,"Bowie, MD",0,3,,2.0,12/28/2017,"Great staff, horrible service!!!  Waited long time before I received my check.  Some customers got other people's food.  I cancelled 2 items due to long wait.  Needs improvement before I consider going back."
Ray S.,"Bowie, MD",0,1,,2.0,12/26/2017,Great beer selection. The service is slow and the chef only knows one spice... Salt. I've often frequented the BJ's in Orlando while on business. The Bowie location is a disappointment.
Michael F.,"Bowie, MD",0,1,,1.0,12/21/2017,"Flat draft beer 2 of 4 meals COLD : veggies, steak, shrimp scampi. Cannot read menu due to bad lighting settings. Poor acustics cannot here anyone at same table. If this is an example of even their average quality they should pack their bags and crawl out of town!!!!"
Olivia P.,"Twin Rivers, East Windsor, NJ",98,1,,1.0,12/16/2017,"Today was my first and last time ever dining at such an establishment. Being that this is a fairly new restaurant in an up and coming area I had very high hopes. For my entree I ordered the Top Sirloin cooked medium rare. After a pretty long wait close to 30 minutes the server brought out my food. The steak looked very hard from the outside so when I cut into it I noticed it was extremely well done and cold. I sent it back and requested a new steak. After waiting another 30 minutes for them to bring out the new steak, it was so under seasoned it was inedible.  The manager decided to comp the meal, but it took the server another 30 minutes to get the check correct. Overall I was extremely unhappy with the food the service and I was in here for a hour and a half more than I would have liked to be."
Kayla C.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",0,2,4,1.0,12/13/2017,"Usually I enjoy this establishment (at least for what it's worth) but tonight I received the WORST service imaginable. I began the evening trying to be optimistic as it was an unusually busy night. My party of 3 was sat next to a party of over 20 with one server struggling to maintain his section. We waited for nearly an hour for our food for the two of the orders to be incorrect. We waited 20 minutes for a manager and never received correct orders. Even after having a reasonable conversation with the manager about our experience, we had to wait almost 30 minutes for a check. Our server was completely overwhelmed and unable to provide adequate service. If I return to this location, I hope that they would have resolved their staff planning issue."
Jada T.,"Bowie, MD",0,46,,4.0,11/26/2017,"What a pleasant addition to the BTC. Especially with so many businesses leaving the space. We tried a variety of dishes. The pizza and cookie dessert were by far, the best. We tried the Jambalaya (which was recommended by more than 1 person). But we weren't impressed. The happy hour drinks were much stronger once we mentioned they were watered-down. They also have food and drink happy hour specials. It's worth checking out. I look forward to visiting again to try some other dishes."
Sharnae S.,"Washington, DC",164,1,,1.0,12/13/2017,"Ordered curbside to-go and when my father got there to pick up the food, it was sitting out and cold.  They offered to re-cook the meal.  An hour and a half later the food is finally ready.  My father gets home with the food (I ordered a bacon cheeseburger), and the sandwich literally only had cheese on the burger (bread, burger patty, cheese).  No bacon, no fries onions, no ketchup or mustard as requested.  BJs was one of my favorite restaurants, and I've had pleasant experiences every time at the Laurel location.  But, the Bowie location has a LONG way to go and though it's only around the corner from my home, I will likely travel to Laurel if I want BJs."
Daryll B.,"Washington, DC",2,9,,2.0,11/22/2017,"Update: I came in for a late lunch on the day before Thanksgiving. The service remains very attentive, which is a positive. The food was so so. The fries have a crust, almost like being breaded (those with gluten allergies may need to ask to confirm whether they are, in fact, gluten free). I ordered traditional Buffalo wings. The wings came out ""Luke Cool.""  I tried one and it was below average. The quality reminded me of Sysco conglomerate brands similar to what you might find in any hospital or Federal Government agency cafeteria close to closing hour. The manager ""comped"" the wings from which I took one lonely and unpleasant bite.  Besides being cool to the touch, they lacked any depth of flavor.  The blue cheese dip could easily pass as Aldi's store brand.  Invest in a good blue cheese or make it in house using a good recipe.  The Grand Cru 2017 house brew was great.  That was my second time having the Grand Cru and it did not disappoint. Honestly, I wish the place luck. They are so close to getting it correct.  However, less than adequate wings at a brewery is unacceptable.  Your experience may be very different from what I encountered. Here are the pluses: The menu is varied, the staff is attentive, the beer is cold and good, the speed of service is great, and the décor is beautiful. Would that the food quality and temperature matched the tenacity of the service.  I may return but my expectations are much lower given this second experience.  Please try the place for yourself, maybe my visit is not indicative of the overall quality.  I hope your experience is better."
Kim B.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",0,3,,2.0,12/11/2017,"This is a bathroom and management issue. The food is excellent. I was there Sunday, December 10, 2017. I told a manager there was no toilet tissue in the women's restroom. He assured me it would be taken care of. Twenty minutes later I went to the bathroom and still there was no toilet tissue. I spoke to a different manager this time. A tip it doesn't matter how good your food is, if you don't properly service your restrooms. Its simply nasty!"
