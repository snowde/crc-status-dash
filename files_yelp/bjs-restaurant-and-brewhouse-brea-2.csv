Jennifer G.,"La Mirada, CA",350,312,183,5.0,12/8/2017,"Came here with my boyfriend to celebrate our monthiversary and to share a pizookie on Wednesday - which turned out to be $4 beer and $10 loaded burgers and endless fries Wednesday, yay!  There wasn't a long wait; we were seated right away. The female hostess let us know about BJ'S PREMIER REWARDS. I signed up on their website from my phone right there while waiting to order. You get a FREE MINI PIZOOKIE for downloading the app and using mobile pay. Plus, have the server check you in by scanning or entering the bar code numbers and you will start earning points that will end up saving you money on future visits. The service was phenomenal. Our burgers and beers were enjoyable. And we loved our free mini pizookie lol. We will be back soon!"
Rita G.,"La Mirada, CA",0,4,,2.0,1/6/2018,"No longer on our ""go to"" list. Service super slow taking food order and getting food. Not a busy time, 11am on Saturday. Kids pancake combo has rock hard pancakes. Fries and cold and over fried. I used to really like this place, even hosted an event here many years ago. Such a bummer. Update: Just wanted to add that we did let the server know about the pancakes and fries and she offered to correct. The restaurant did not charge us for the two kids meals, which was very nice."
Rigo A.,"West Covina, CA",41,15,,1.0,12/23/2017,"Do yourselves a favor. If you're gonna book more than 10 people, look elsewhere. You need a reservation for that many people, which is absolutely understandable. It's a lot of people. So they need to speak to the manager. I held for 7 minutes, nobody comes to answer. I hang up, call back. I ask about it again, they said manager is busy. I get it, it's Saturday. I gave them my number, and ask to please have them call me.  Half an hour goes by, nothing. I need to see if I can make a res before it's too late, so I call back. I ask to speak to manager. Again, on hold for 9 minutes. Finally comes to phone, says they can't because they're booked. I don't understand why the host or hostess couldn't just look at the list of reservations for that time and tell me they couldn't fit me in. What's the point of the runaround if they're booked to begin with?  Awful impression."
Rachel J.,"Placentia, CA",46,2,1,2.0,1/8/2018,"I was really disappointed when I tried the curbside pickup about a week ago. After calling twice to let them know that I had arrived and was waiting curbside, they brought out part of my order. It took 30 mins to get half of my order and while waiting for the other part of the order, our food got cold. I had to go inside and talk to the manager, who was nice about everything and had our food remade. The whole curbside pickup process took an hour and was not worth it. If I go back, maybe takeout will be faster next time."
Brianna W.,"Placentia, CA",96,6,19,4.0,12/3/2017,"For my friend's birthday party yesterday, we went to BJ's. The buffalo boneless wing appetizers was super moist and soft on the inside with a slight crunch on the outside.            However, the lemon thyme chicken that I ate was second to none. The tenderness of the chicken with the blend of fire roasted peppers, tomatoes, sauteed red onions, and roasted Brussels sprouts over the brown rice was simply delicious. Thinking about it now makes my mouth water.       The sparkling raspberry lemonade is a definite must try. It was a bit on the sweeter side, but it was such a nice blend, not to mention, picture-worthy. A light pink color after mixing, the best time for good photos would definitely be before it's mixed."
Natalia Z.,"Brea, CA",0,3,1,4.0,1/8/2018,The pazooki is amazing but the food is okay I mean it's definitely not bad it's pretty good actually and I would recommend it. I'm totally coming back again
Nicole G.,"Anaheim, CA",210,109,501,4.0,6/30/2017,"Came out for a teachers dinner, early evening on a Thursday , the restaurant wasn't too crowded but we were prepared and made a reservation.  We ordered the egg rolls which are seriously my favorite appetizer at this restaurant. They never disappoint and who doesn't love avocado?!  I also order the Santa Fe salad with chicken I liked the spicy dressing they add to it and the salad was just so refreshing for a hot summers night. It went great with my martini!!  Service was great, they took care of our big party and made sure we had enough filled waters. They even surprised one of our friends with a bday treat since she mentioned she just turned 21, we didn't ask for one so that was a sweet gesture!  You must try a pizcookie it's literally one of the best items on their menu! Fresh baked cookie with ice cream you'll be in love!"
Aly M.,"Placentia, CA",35,116,25,3.0,5/21/2017,"Ohhh bjs! I remember years ago when coming here was a treat and now, it seems like a last minute resort. Don't get me wrong, the food is pretty good and they have a huge menu but something about it has become so basic. I do have to admit, I love their pizzas and pizookies...yumm but aside from that, everything is just mediocre. I came here on Friday night with some friends and the place was packed but after waiting a few short minutes, we were able to find a table at the bar. I decided to get the ahi salad because I remember it being so good...well...times have changed!! I remember when they'd give chunks of ahi and now all I got was slivers. My salad looked so sad!!  This place is good if you want something simple and just some decent American food. If you don't frequent this location much, be advised that it's located by the Brea mall but not in the mall. Parking in the evening isn't really an issue but this location gets packed and it's not unusual to wait more than 30min for a table. Even with the 3 stars, I will come back because it's a good ""go-to"" restaurant."
Brigitte O.,"Yorba Linda, CA",274,474,2244,2.0,4/27/2017,"Used to come here all the time in high school and in college so I thought I would bring my boyfriend here since he likes gastropubs.  Either my taste buds have changed or the cooking has because the amazing deep dish pizza I remembered was salty -- even for him which is saying a lot. The wedge salad was okay but he was disappointed that the bacon was burnt.  The best part was the chocolate chip pizookie that we shared as a dessert. The chocolate was still melty and the ice cream was good. But by the end of the pizookie it was turning hard and became difficult to scrape from the pan. Wonder whether they all turn out like this or whether it was just ours? Overall the server was nice but the furniture was dirty (mystery hardened goop on my arm rest kept me from using the right side of the chair) which made us wonder whether the kitchen was clean and we can get better quality pizza closer to home with fresh ingredients for less money so we think maybe this location is just in business because people know the chain and because it's in a mall parking lot which generates a lot of business.  Three stars for service but one star for food, value, and cleanliness.  Hence the two star average."
Timothy S.,"Santa Ana, CA",2,24,4,5.0,9/24/2017,This place is nice to go to on Sundays. They have all the footballs games on different TV's throughout. The outdoor seating is a nice option as well. The food is pretty average but good for a chain restaurant.  Service was fine. No complaints. Will be back.
D R.,"Lake Havasu City, AZ",0,149,39,2.0,11/17/2017,Think Cheesecake Factory with a microbrewery. Ridiculously large menu where everything is average. No way one place can cover everything from pasta to pizza to burgers well. I had jambalaya and it was average: not spicy or memorable. So everyone can find their favorite and since most angelinos are not gourmets they will go away obliviously full of blandness.
Raechel S.,"South Lake Tahoe, CA",1,15,15,4.0,12/31/2017,"When I went in with friends, the waiter took us to a table and the wait to see our server again was a little long. It was a slow Thursday. Waiter eventually came with a bright smile, ready to help us. Explained a few different beer options, the specials of the day, and how the app worked to get a free item. Service was a little slow but overall good experience."
Danna T.,"Cerritos, CA",194,63,318,4.0,3/5/2017,"*TIP: This place gets packed on the weekends! Try the self-seating bar area right away if there's a really long wait. I always tend to get lucky with that one! Went here on a weekend and the wait was about 1 hr long, but luckily we found seats in the bar area! My bf and I were really hungry, so we went straight to ordering the calamari when our server barely got to us to ask for our drinks. lol!  Ordered the white peach margarita (get it on the rocks instead of slush = more alcohol!! *wink) Boyyy it was strong! It comes with frozen peaches too, which I enjoyed after finishing my drink. A must try! I love calamari, and BJ's calamari never disappoints! It was actually served out really fast, so that got me super excited. What I liked about it the most is that it  stays crispy no matter how long it has been. I remember I snuck in a last piece even after our main meal, and it still had a crunch to it! (a plus!) Also, I love calamari when it's served with the squid legs -- this choice was definitely a win! We also ordered the Spicy Pig tavern cut pizza. Yummy! It comes with pieces of jalapeno, so be careful because it gets spicy! I love spicy food and the fact that this pizza comes with pineapples (love!!) was definitely a good choice! Our server was super patient and was very nice -- even though it was obvious that we just wanted to place our order right away. lol If it wasn't for the self-seating bar area, then we would've left. Always check that area right away when it looks like a long wait. We unfortunately didn't have room for pizookies, but we will definitely come back to get some."
Ernesto M.,"Corona, CA",83,221,97,3.0,7/31/2017,"I only have 2 check in's at this BJ's, but Ive been here dozens of times. This is the first visit where the service just strait sucked. Took almsot 10 mintues to get ask what we wanted to drink. Food took normal time, but to get refills, sugar, and bix for pizza, it took forever! Never had a lunch take over an hour except for this one!  I will update if service is better next time....."
Nicole P.,"Long Beach, CA",99,71,37,4.0,8/11/2017,"I was thoroughly impressed with the quality of the shrimp in my Santa Fe salad. They give you about 15 shrimp, and for a dollar or two more than the chicken option, I thought that was a steal. Delicious! Service was good, the stouts were good, and my friend and I shared the new cous cous mac 'n' cheese too. It tasted like a bougie version of Kraft--in all the best ways! I recommend it for pure comfort. The chicken in my friend's BBQ chicken salad was smokey and flavorful, and my other friend got a huge portion of salmon on his Santa Fe salad. It's usually hit or miss when you come to chains like these, and I was very satisfied with this location! Hit!"
Jasmine R.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,12,15,1.0,12/21/2017,"Oh BJ's.... beyond the worst BJ's I've ever been to. Ordered some guacamole to go at 10:22pm... they gave it to me at 11:07 pm because they were making ""fresh"" guacamole. Literally handed me crushed Avocado with a bunch of salt... walked back in and asked for a refund. The manager looked embarrassed when he looked at the box of avocados. I just wish he could taste it to understand how gross it was. The sad part is that we have ordered this before and it was so yummy... Won't be coming back..."
Ashley L.,"Corona, CA",0,2,,1.0,1/6/2018,Came here yesterday around 7 pm with my fiancé and was sited down and waited for the server for almost 45 min and was never helped witch kinda disappointed me a lot the servers here were horrible the food the other people where waiting on took almost an hour to get to them witch is a waste of time ! Don't even waste you're time here you don't even get in-knowledge!
Joseph K.,"Beverly Hills, CA",297,92,1928,5.0,11/12/2017,"Food isn't always prepared as you tell them. Great Customer Service. Wait isn't too long. Cleaner than some other locations. Cheesecakes! What more can you say...?? What steals the show here is the gorgeous Host around noon that looks like Jennifer Love Hewitt! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE :-P"
MIchelle R.,"Long Beach, CA",25,19,30,1.0,4/5/2017,"This review is solely based on my take-out curbside, customer service and food quality experience.  I ordered a large pizza and pazookie through the mobile app. First, they allow you order a half and half of their speciality pizzas but they dont actually offer all of their speciality pizzas. I wanted to order half spicy Hawaiian chicken and half sweet pig. You cannot do this online or the mobile app. You have to order it al a cart. The pizza should have been just under 19.00 but soon blossomed to 32.00 for the exact pizza toppings on this particular half and half combo. I edited the order and just gave up my dream of this girl having my favorite in-store favorite not instore. Le sigh.....  The bugger was I called at 6:50pm to see if I could pick my order up 5 to 10 mintues earlier than my ticket time of 7:30pm. I was put on hold for almost  15mins! Needless to  when someone finally picked up I was in the parking lot. I just told them that I would go inside to see about picking out my order. Their take out personnel  try to  give me another person's order that was the complete opposite of my order because potato skins and a Pizookie don't exactly like a large pizza and a Pizookie. I would advise they would check on my order and proceeded to wait there until after 7:30 before I got it. After getting my order walking back out to the car for curbside takeout service I realized that he actually didn't even pack the ranch that I've specifically requested on the online order and had to walk back in to get it. Now it might not be a big deal, but at this point  I'm now hangry and tired from work and just want to go home.  Okay, leave  a girl without their Ranch they asked for.  Needless to say the ordering system and take out curbside service needs to be altered and for their communication needs to be addressed..... leaving a person on hold for that long, knowing still waited you could not even offer me a water while I waited inside parked on the curbside spot........very dissapointed to even say thr pizza was not even hot all the eat through and was dough-y.  Never again"
Alex G.,"Placentia, CA",4,141,21,5.0,11/20/2017,"Nothing but good things to say about BJ's. Order through their app, selected curbside to go, parked, called in and out came our food. Chicken club and turkey club are delicious. You can't go wrong. We love this place."
Liz M.,"Fullerton, CA",25,27,22,5.0,12/6/2017,"I am at this location often, and I can say that I keep coming back for a reason!  The food is pretty good, area and atmosphere clean and inviting, but I have to say the bartenders are awesome.  I am always treated right, they are very friendly, and always nice."
Tasha V.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",264,285,152,4.0,4/6/2017,"I am always a fan of this brewhouse. I enjoy their pizzas, pastas and appetizers. Of course you can't go wrong with the pizooki for dessert! As for the service, our server at this location was very attentive and kind. He offered items on the menu, when my Mother in law wasn't sure of what to get. She asked about the clam chowder soup and he brought her a sample.  Dine or Dash? Dine. With service like that, I will always dine."
Cindy V.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",5,57,68,4.0,2/25/2017,"We love going to BJ's but I think this is our first time in this location.  The wait was about 20 minutes on an early Saturday evening, not bad at all. Our table was right in front of the big screen, perfect spot for watching UCLA v Arizona hoops. The ambiance was that of a cavernous tavern, copper sculptured ceilings, lots of happy patrons. Good vibes. Our server, Lyndsie, was great. Attentive and quick at bringing drink refills. We were not in a Pizookie mood so we asked her about the beignets.  She was quick to inform us, ""it's really good"". We have tried all the Pizookie flavors so we gave it a shot. Man, that beignet was soooo good...topped with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream and surrounded by wedged strawberries   Thanks for the tip, Lyndsie! And thank you for the great service, we're for sure coming back to this location."
Me D.,"Cypress, CA",0,2,,4.0,11/26/2017,"I came here with my sister and a friend last night and we loved the atmosphere. The food was good, but what really made our night was our server Brandon. He was on top of everything and took care of us all night and he was such a sweetheart. Even though he was busy, he continuously came and made sure everything was ok. We laughed all night and after our week, we needed that. It was like we were old friends.  We enjoyed our food but we enjoyed Brandon even more. We'll definitely be coming back. Also shout out to Nate who I got to talk before I left! We had a short convo and he wasn't even our server but he was still nice enough to chat and ask how I was doing  =)"
Tricia C.,"San Marcos, CA",28,37,27,1.0,10/26/2017,"Extremely poor service. Came here after dinner across the street for a few drinks. Drinks were horribly made and the cups smelled like mildew.  Waiter was stiff and condescending. Moved to the bar and the bartender took our order, realized he forgot to make the drinks about 15 minutes later (keep in mind he spent a lot of time just chatting with other patrons and coworkers). Told him to the cancel the order and he allowed us to leave without an apology. Ended up going back to Tempo where we had dinner for cocktails where they had much better service and quality."
Vince N.,"Quartzsite, AZ",97,48,3,5.0,11/16/2017,"I don't normally leave 5 stars but these guys deserve it!! There was a mid communication on my order which caused them to bring out the wrong meal.. I told them I wanted the salad versus the dinner.. All they did was apologized and returned it. I got what I wanted, Parmesan crusted chicken and pecan salad.. It was great!!! Not sure why they are averaging 3 stars.. Awesome service and great food!! Thanks for a great experience!!!"
Matt S.,"Placentia, CA",13,75,157,4.0,4/1/2017,"We came here on free pizookie day! In order to get the pizookie, you need to spend at least $10 on food - which isn't hard to do as most items are over $10. We shared our food, and ordered the boneless wings, with both garlic Parmesan sauce and root beer BBQ sauce.  The BBQ is nice and sweet - perfect flavor.  We liked the garlic Parmesan, but it is rich, so I would take turns eating 1 at a time, switching between wings. The other item we got was the great white pizza.  It comes with chicken, alfredo sauce, tomatoes, and mushrooms.  We didn't get mushrooms on it.  The pizza was really good and we very much enjoyed it. On to dessert! We each got our own pizookies, (fatties).  I ordered the original, chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream.  It was so yummy and I actually ate the whole thing.  I felt so sick, but so good at the same time. Will most likely be back!"
Kristine R.,"Fullerton, CA",0,5,1,1.0,10/20/2017,"The food was pretty good, however the service was noticeably different between my table and the one next to my group. Our server, Kathryn F., was treating the table next to us completely different. She was constantly checking on them and made sure that their food came out fresh. She did a great job with them I'm sure but my table was kept waiting and ignored. We ended up waiting over 30 minutes for 2 small desserts, which were beignet, and they weren't fresh. When we got them they were so cold it felt like a bread roll that's been sitting out for at least an hour. All in all food was pretty decent but the service..deeply unsatisfactory. One star for service."
Ms J.,"Placentia, CA",3,13,1,1.0,11/3/2017,The service was bad.  First time ever at a BJs.  Took forever for waitress to take our order and even longer for food
Fabby D.,"Anaheim, CA",80,4,4,1.0,8/20/2017,"Hostess was rude.. blonde little girl, said they would text us so we could go to the mall and walk around so we wouldn't have to wait around for the 45 minutes and if I messaged them that we were on our way they would hold our table, just to let them know we where on our way and that's exactly what we did. But when we got there they said they had not received the message. And then we ordered an appetizer and the mozzarella sticks had no cheese. I love this place but this specific restaurant was not a great visit.  I went Friday night (8/18) around 8 so I knew we would have a wait but that hostess needs to learn how to handle her temper."
Joshua Y.,"Buena Park, CA",1,13,24,5.0,10/29/2017,It is real good food and hang out place. Such a good time watching the Dodgers world series. I love the place
Donna S.,"Los Angeles, CA",234,443,531,5.0,5/31/2017,BJ's Favorite pizza is always a safe choice here and always good! I also love when BJ's has promotions like a free appetizer with over $10 purchase because it allows me try something new. Make sure to check online for coupons before going so you make the most out of your meal. And I came to celebrate my niece's 2nd birthday so watching her blow out her candle and try to eat her mini pizooki was super cute.
debbiet t.,"Pomona, CA",147,39,45,5.0,7/28/2017,Great place to eat for lunch. Plenty of parking. Waiting minimum time. Like 5-10 minutes. Place is clean. Great service. Waitress knowledgeable w/ selections. Thank you Isabel! You gave excellent advice. My brother ordered brisket w/ bacon burger. He said he was in meat heaven. I got the unlimited soup and salad for lunch and upgraded salad for a $1. Great selections for soups and salads. I feel spoiled because I'm used to other Restaurants that only have 1 or 2 soups/salads I can eat since I don't eat meat.  Love the tomato soup. The ease of paying on the app is awesome.
Jonathan T.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,30,22,2.0,10/17/2016,"Sitting on the patio with family and watching some MNF.  Me: umm...there are Raccoons over there.  Waitress: yeah Me: ummm ok?? That means you need to clean your patios better and to do something about it!! Now for the next 45 mins, we are looking over our shoulders so they don't get closer to us!"
Krystle C.,"Fullerton, CA",215,11,7,5.0,9/18/2017,"Monday night bartender, Robert, is the best! Helpful, knowledge, quick, and personable! I'll even come in solo for a burger and beer (not usually comfortable for me to do, usually)! Go visit him and you'll know what I mean!"
Noemi F.,"Whittier, CA",15,8,3,1.0,8/25/2017,"Service at this location is horrible! BJ's is a favorite of my husband's so we went there to celebrate his birthday last night. There was no wait, so we got seated right away which was nice. Our original service was fine, but he was hard to find.  It took my 9 year old hunting down our server to order our appetizer. It took a while for our appetizer to arrive and when it did we couldn't eat it because no plates were given. The kids sat there patiently staring ...drooling over the flatbread pizza. :(  We didn't see our server, so after waiting a few minutes I asked the hostess to track him down.  I guess she couldn't find him either so she ended up getting our plates. Then, before we could take a first bite our entrees arrived. That's terrible timing! Asked the server to take the food back to keep it warm at least. We rushed through our app and again sat there waiting to spot our server. Finally, I spot him, signaled that we needed him at our table and I'm pretty sure he knotted ..he was carrying a stack of dishes back to the kitchen so I assume he'd come see us right after ---especially given the timing mishap. NOPE! He went to take another table's order. Ugh!!!! That was it! We walked out.  I explained to the manager what had happened. He was understating and offered to move us to another table or get a different server, but at that point my husband's birthday dinner was completely ruined and he just wanted to go home. I was offered $25 gift card to make up for the experience -- thanks but not thanks. You lost a customer for life!"
Alejandrina R.,"Anaheim, CA",2,10,,1.0,11/18/2017,"My experience here was probably the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant.  My coworkers and I decided to come here yesterday after work for dinner.  We left our workplace at about 8:20 P.M, and one of the women in our group had reserved a spot for us on the app at that time.  We arrived and waited... By this time it was already nine, and we still did not have a table.  When inquiring about our reservation, we were told that submitting one through the app wasn't sufficient.  Then what is? We were told our party would be next to make up for the inconvenience.  Another one of the women in our team ordered chicken wings, bone in.  The amount of time it took for them to arrive was pretty long.  And when they arrived, they arrived...boneless.  We let the waiter know, so he removed them and left.  Another twenty minutes pass, and they come back with the same platter of boneless wings (now cold).  We let them know again that we wanted them bone in, and when they do arrive bone in (the third time), they were cold.  By this time we request to speak to a manager.  We then proceeded to order the rest of our food, which also took long to arrive.  A mom and pop place would have had better food for less money.  The pros would be that our waiter remained kind and courteous through the whole situation (even after we requested to speak to a manager) and the pizookie was tasty.  I would only come back here if this was the only restaurant in California, but it isn't, so..."
Delicia B.,"Whittier, CA",175,55,107,2.0,9/30/2017,"Major fail; three oversights during one service is unacceptable.  Our potato skin appetizer was delivered to the wrong table which caused additional 20 minute wait. Then the chicken strip order was overcooked; another 15 minute wait. And the icing on the cake, a complete chicken sandwich order never got to the table and left one of my guests foodless and extremely upset.  What was supposed to be a long overdue enjoyable meal turned into a complete nightmare. However, credit must be given to the manager who tried to resolve the situation. Unfortunately the damage was done."
Corina R.,"Fullerton, CA",3,18,9,5.0,7/28/2017,"DOWNLOAD the BJ's APP  When we arrived, there was a wait, but downloading the BJ's app and putting my name in, BEFORE we got there, SAVED TIME the manager made sure we were comfortable until we got our seats-PERFECT place to meet up for dinner!  Excellent Service, food & Drinks"
Justin A.,"Beverly Hills, CA",42,163,12,3.0,10/5/2017,Bjs is bjs it's a good place to come and try a few brews and pizza and wings especially when there is a game on . Sampler appetizer platter is good too and who can forget the poozookie
