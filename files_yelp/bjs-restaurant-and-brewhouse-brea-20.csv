Christopher L.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,4,,3.0,8/27/2016,"Stick to the pizza! I had the ahi tuna salad and it was horrible. The tuna looked and tasted like it was prepackaged (ala Applebee's). Dressing was bland and salad was saturated with it. Wings and pizza was good, I'll go back for that and the beer"
Jomari S.,"La Mirada, CA",1,18,2,1.0,8/16/2015,"Wait time 45 minutes to be seated.  Wait time to order and eat 1 hr  Waitress was not helpful and she was not empathetic to our situation. I asked politely, ""excuse me, how much longer do you feel our food will take?"" Response, ""(shrugging shoulders), I don't know."" Horrible workflow and lack of motivated staff.  Something here needs to change.  They need to take tips from Cerritos BJ's"
Ron M.,"Irvine, CA",246,131,243,3.0,9/23/2015,"Went there again today, ordered a veggie burger. Waiter came back 15 minutes later to tell me that they ran out. Major oversight dudes! Posting this review in islands where they have plenty of veggie patties."
Samantha M.,"Corona, CA",3,148,34,1.0,3/24/2016,Okay so my family and I came last night. And it took 30 minutes for the waitress to come to our table 25 mins for our drinks and we ordered an  appetizer  it came after  our dinner? What after everything we went through the Manger didn't care she was rude and so was the waitress screw you guys and our food was cold after 2 and a half hours  here seriously
Vanessa T.,"Fullerton, CA",3,91,11,3.0,10/2/2015,"The worst time ever! Had to wait 25 minutes for a table. The kid calls my party and then tells me, ""Oh, the table isn't clean yet. Just wait here."" My party ends up waiting about 5 minutes ..total of 30 minutes for a table.  Standing around I end up sitting at a freshly cleaned table. The kid walks up and tells us that we can't sit there...he ends up moving my party to two different tables until sitting back at the first one we sat in. Ugh, at least the server was quick and attentive.  You've been warned."
Chris M.,"Camarillo, CA",50,46,39,2.0,5/30/2015,"This review is based on food:  My gf and I had the shrimp scampi and these sriracha Brussels sprouts. The shrimp scampi was very dry. We had to ask for a side of sauce just to make the dish somewhat enjoyable. As for the Brussel sprouts, terrible. I hope that this was a one time mistake, but it was way too salty. I didn't send it back because I don't like complaining, so I had to stomach through it. It looked nothing like the picture. The only reason I gave 2 stars is because the pazooki was and always will be good."
David N.,"Fullerton, CA",46,90,94,5.0,5/8/2016,Chicago deep dish is my all time favorite here and all the alcohol is worth trying! Service is always great here never had any problems and great for large parties. Celebrating Mother's Day here for lunch and was not busy at all.
Alexandra D.,"Canyon Country, CA",0,11,1,1.0,1/7/2017,The hostess here is a rude person. She doesn't have any people skills. She shouldn't be upfront with customers she should be in the back where she doesn't have to deal with customers . Wish there was a no star because that's what she needs. If she can't handle people then she's in the wrong business
Cindy G.,"Bell, CA",49,40,8,1.0,2/24/2016,"I don't get it, there is a ridiculous wait for this place and the food is pretty terrible.  I mean seriously how hard is it to make a salad?  I ordered  an Asian salad with no onions because the menu indicated it had green onions.  What I got was lettuce, red onions, a few mandarin oranges, and a few wontons.  I'd say 75% of the salad was lettuce.  There were absolutely no snow peas and there was red onions when it wasn't a listed ingredient and I had requested no onions.  My boyfriend asked for the pork chile verde queso dip, the missing ingredient was the pork.  He found absolutely no pork in the dip whatsoever.  Our mozzarella sticks appetizer were a little on the cold side so they weren't melty when you bit into them.  It was overall a disappointing meal."
Karen W.,"La Mesa, CA",12,14,8,2.0,9/11/2015,"As always, BJ's has great food along with great sport coverage!  However, I'm extremely irked by how my bill was handled. I paid in cash and waited 10-15 minutes for my change. Waiter came by and wondered why we were still there. I asked if he had our change ready for us and he responded by saying ""I thought you were going to leave me the rest."" REALLY??? You're going to just take my money without my consent?? How unprofessional!! I still left a tip and left the restaurant very upset.  I love BJ's but I'm not coming here again because of this encounter."
Erika J.,"Fullerton, CA",213,66,70,3.0,6/3/2015,"I absolutely love the pizookies here. The trio deal is one of my favorites! However the times ive been here the service is a little on the slow side. I get that it is a hot spot and there are normally a lot of customers that come in, but it took an incredibly long time for me to have my order taken as well as have the food come out after that.  come in when its not prime-time and youre in for a treat. Come in when its super busy, and youre in for a treat, but need to wait to get it."
Brandon M.,"Fullerton, CA",24,153,7,2.0,6/8/2015,"A couple years back this BJ's was the best of the best. But over the last year or so I have found that the place is falling apart (in terms of service/food/etc, not structurally). The food has become bland, under cooked at times, but yet takes forever to get - regardless to how slow or busy it is. Customer service has been suffering too. The ladies (and occasionally dudes) at the front greet people when they come to the podium to reserve a table. And as of late, that's about the best customers get. Many of the waitresses/waiters have extremely fake attitudes, they are not very accommodating, don't know the menu, and don't really seem to care about their jobs. My last visit is a prime example of this upset. The waitress we had was slow to getting our order, got half of our orders wrong, and then disappeared for the majority of our meal. It wasn't a busy night, so I am not sure what lead her to ignore our table. None of the 6 people in my party were happy with the meal. Its too bad most of the good employees moved on and management cant replace them with equally ""skilled"" employees. There is still a small handful of employees that are doing well, but overall its not that same great place I remember from a couple years back."
Sandra A.,"Anaheim, CA",104,28,26,5.0,9/7/2015,Came here for a ladies night and we were able to make a reservation and we were sat right away and on time!! Kathryn was wonderful she recommended the Honey Siracha Brussel Sprouts and they were sooo yummy. Great service and the food was great!
Mike G.,"Chino, CA",1,67,45,4.0,6/2/2015,"I've been a  server trainer for over 10 years so I know how it is. I came here on May 29th to celebrate my anniversary with my Fiance. We came it around 6, which is expected to be busy, nothing wrong with that. We wait about 15 minutes like the hostess said. Here are my complaints. We the hostess (different) sat us, she just threw the menus on the table, said something around the lines of enjoy your dinner or they will be with you, and walked away before we were even sat.  I can understand this if you are really busy and short staffed, but there are plenty of workers for this not to happen. Now, we waited about 12 minutes until finally someone came to our table, our server. Like I mentioned before, I am a server and understand, but it doesn't matter if you have a million things in your hand, at least walk by on your way to another table and say I will be right with you, then at least we know that you saw us. I'm the most patient person there is, and I was just about to get up and talk to management.   After our server finally came to us everything is great after that. I had about 6 cups of water and I never had to ask for any. The food came out in a good time, hot, and just what we ordered. Service was great and I would give that part 5 starts after the initial 12 minute wait for him. From one server to another, just remember to at least saw something as you are walking by to a new table. I do it all the time at mine at they will see that you are busy and understand better."
Cathycakes W.,"La Mirada, CA",110,37,3,2.0,5/26/2015,"We came here on Thursday night last week around 9 pm. My friend ordered wine and they didnt bring it until we were almost at the end of our meal. We had to remind our waitress and she was real apologetic about it. Maybe the bartender forgot or maybe she forgot to place the order - we dont know. At the end of the meal, she gave us a free mini pizookie for our trouble. We were happy with it but in the middle of my chew, there was a hair stuck on a chocolate chip. I immediately spit it out. Showed it to the waitress, again real apologetic. Offered a new one but at that point i wasnt eating any pizzookies ever again. Walked out of there with such a disappointed experience. They keep sending me coupons, I do love BJs but I am never coming back to Brea again..."
Julie B.,"Twentynine Palms, CA",0,1,,1.0,9/28/2016,"Went to Bj's today for lunch and was very disappointed. Had a bacon avocado sandwich. It only had 2 thin slices of bacon on it. Couldn't taste it. Also, ordered a sider Caesar salad. It was warm and wilted. Service was slow. Took a long time to receive  our check. Even after we asked 2 different times."
Chris B.,"Brea, CA",54,110,33,3.0,5/25/2015,"Not what it used to be. I remember when this and the chain altogether was new on the scene, making a splash.  I was a huge fan unaware of any other place around home one could get what they called Deep Dish (mocking tone only because I visited Chicago for a dozen years, and that's a different animal altogether).  Initially, the pizza was a valiant effort, never as much cheese as this Midwesterner would like and would get while traveling, but still tasty, with a wonderfully ever-so-slightly burnt crust edge.  Just the right amount of oil, and lots of great tomatoes.  Ordering extra cheese has a moderate impact on the volume. Since that time, a couple things have happened, but it all boils down to the company's gotten too big for its britches and the bean counters have assumed control.  Service is slow (I've experienced this not only when dining there, but when I had a party there the space was way understaffed, so people were always waiting for something).  Wouldn't you sell more drinks and have happier people if you had a couple more servers making sure everyone who wanted something got it? It's a shame when companies forget what got them where they are in the first place, makes the field ripe for someone else to come along and sweep the rug out from under them.  The place is still busy so status quo for the office in the meantime."
Judy R.,"Placentia, CA",24,5,2,5.0,1/15/2017,"Thanks BJ's!!!  Just had another great meal at BJ's Brea. Not only is the food really good, the staff is always friendly. The server we had tonight was Amber and she was so nice. Bantered with my Dad and made our dinner extra enjoyable. Our order came out exactly as we ordered, nothing was wrong. She checked back quickly to see if we needed anything or if there was any issue. I will definitely ask for her next time. So, if you want great food, great servers and great atmosphere visit BJ's Brea."
Kruti S.,"Buena Park, CA",872,170,140,3.0,8/8/2015,One of the better BJs around Orange County! I've been to plenty others but for some reason this one serves the best pizza.  Service is great & the servers are all very friendly & attentive!
Richard P.,"East Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,3.0,7/17/2016,"Bjs is one of my family's favorite place to eat so it pains me to write this, My wife ordered a wedge salad and potato when we first got her salad she got the wrong dressing and altho we never complain we had to say something well waiting for the replacement salad she received her potato and it came very undercooked because she had already felt bad about the salad we didn't say anything about the potato then when she received her salad it was completely brown and the lettuce was bad, Are waiter was good the rest of our orders where fine so that's why I give the 3 stars and we will continue to come to BJs but stick to the one in Cerritos"
