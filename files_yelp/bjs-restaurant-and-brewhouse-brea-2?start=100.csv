Richard D.,"La Habra, CA",0,25,,3.0,6/6/2017,"Years ago when this was a Magnolia's Peach, we'd come often, but after it became BJ's and was remodeled inside, not as often. The reason is the noise. I'm a senior, and have difficulty hearing and the noise in this place makes for a lonely meal, as I cannot hear anything said at our table due to the background noise. When it was Magnolia's Peach, there was carpeting throughout and it was much, much quieter. That's ancient history!,  BJ'd is too noisy for old folks like me. Before we sat down, I checked on the outside dining and discovered it was quiet, and the gas space heaters in the top of the awnings kept the area warm and cozy. (It was overcast and typical June gloom weather outside with a definite chill in the air but inside the tentlike enclosure, it was fine AND QUIET.) The food was good. We had Ribs, Chicken Club Sandwich, Spaghetti & Meatballs and a Mediterranean deep dish pizza. The wife had a Top Shelf Margarita on the rocks which was very good. The rest of us had soft drinks.  The dinner was topped off with Pizookie.  The best part was our table server, Judy C (#195). She is a star. We loved the way she treated us like family and took care of our every need. The lemonade, Iced tea and Sierra mist drinks were kept topped off without asking, and in a timely manner. Couldn't be happier with Judy's attitude and great service.  (Note to manager: Judy is a keeper - take good care of her.) For the record: Scoring as follows - noise level 1 star, food 3-1/2 stars, Service 5 stars!!! We will be back, preferably during off peak hours and with the ability to sit somewhere quiet."
Shannon L.,"Newport Beach, CA",148,184,31,5.0,1/31/2017,"you must try the honey sriracha Brussel sprouts!! such a bomb appetizer. I would go back for those alone. Of course I waited all week for a cheat meal to come to this place and get the pizooki. I do not know why someone would go to BJ's and not partake in pure happiness haah! The white chocolate chip macadamia nut, monkey bread and salted caramel!! We did the trio, was just heaven in my mouth. I had the ahi salad which was also pretty good, but nothing to write home about. Brussel sprouts and pizooki for the win!"
Ron H.,"Yorba Linda, CA",0,22,,2.0,4/23/2017,The only reason that we like coming here is the pizza. This place would be better as a walk up counter so you did not have to deal with waiters and the resteraunts lack of service.  We have been here many times and the story is often the same. Saturday night we did the preferred waitlist on the app that does not seem to do a thing at this location as we still had to wait over half an hour after we got there.  We were seated at the table and waited over 10 minutes before anyone greated us.  Then we ordered our drinks and meal all at one time.  15 minutes later we were served 4 of our drinks and one was still being made (strawberry lemonade). It was another 10-15 before our salads were served. The food was good as always - the reason that we keep coming back
Janice S.,"Orange, CA",35,106,52,1.0,6/24/2016,If I can give them zero stars I would. Worst dining experience of my life. No words can explain how awful the experience was.  The worst service I have ever experienced at a restaurant
Brian I.,"Fullerton, CA",4,61,467,4.0,3/12/2017,"Have not been here for a while.  Last time I was here, the food was not that good.  Came this time to meet up with some good friends.  The menu has changed a bit, but they still have your old favorites as well.  A lot more to choose from now.  The beer selection is on point as well.  They have more than just their own on tap now.  They had some good local crafts as well.  They are a definite must for me now.  I would like to think that I am going to put them on my restaurant visit rotation from here on out."
Justin D.,"Fullerton, CA",0,2,,1.0,9/17/2017,Poor service don't want to get here anytime past 8 service is slow short staffed and frankly just plain shitty don't get Devin Ballard he won't fill up your drinks for the whole stay
Raymond L.,"Orange County, CA",363,997,3699,3.0,10/31/2015,"It was a Friday afternoon, and Raymond saw the perilous path in front of him. Irvine to the 57 to the IE? Oh dear. I had left a little earlier than usual, around 4pm, heading out of Irvine. Looking at the traffic report, I knew I wasn't gonna be able to make it home without going crazy and yelling at all the stopped cars. Texting mi amiga Bonnie, asking if I should stop for Happy Hour or should I go, she said Happy hour! And so I stopped in Brea (it had already taken an hour to get to Brea- usual 35 mins) and wanted to do Yard House. Bonnie couldn't make it til 6 so I quickly switched to BJs since their Happy Hour is M-F 3-7pm. Going at 6, there was a line for parties that were more than 3, but since we were only a party of two, we quickly got a seat. Their happy hour is on their beers, cocktails and wines. They also have 50% mini deep dish pizzas and $2 off shareable/handcrafted appetizers.  Barefoot White Wine- Flavors of green apples and peaches with a creamy mouthfeel. Not really too much of a fan of this, because the fruitiness of the drink wasn't as strong as I had hoped for it to be. It was light and alcohol was more of a presence. Yes, that's the case, but it's my personal alcohol taste :P If you like more alcohol, go ahead and try it ($6.25/glass) BJs mini deep dish pizza- $11.50 reg. Totally not worth at that price. I think 1/2 price is a more reasonable price. 6"" pizza. It was indeed deep dish and you could taste the crunch. Plus so much more crust :3 There was a lot of cheese and a decent amount of mushrooms and toppings on there. The only thing would be that it is sooo not worth the regular price. You want wings? They got wings. They aren't dry either and they are marinated pretty well. Tangyyyyyyy. You got celery and ranch on the side as well :)  BJs is loud and boomin and will have tons of people here throughout the day- come here for Happy Hour and enjoy their beers and appetizers! :D No pictures included because  a) it was really dark- they dimmed lights around 620pm b) Phone was at like 7% battery c) Was too tired. Sorry ):"
Sebastian A.,"Whittier, CA",0,18,1,5.0,4/26/2017,"Tried the Brea one with friends honestly the service here AMAZING, food is okay I mean it's BJ's it's just pizza, beer amazing. Overall good experience but it was the service we received that made the experience great, even when I went to the bathroom a employee happened to be nearby and opened the door for me lol I'm only 21 no matter the age the professionalism doesn't stop, I normally go to the RSM location deep in Orange County with my work. You guys could give a few tips to them! Keep it up!"
Gris A.,"La Habra, CA",130,24,48,5.0,5/14/2017,Great food and service was amazing. Had an incredible Mothers Day lunch. BJ's never disappoints
Kiran K.,"Anaheim, CA",0,15,,1.0,8/31/2017,"Firts of i Love BJ's restaurants, specially their avocado egg rolls and cherry salmon. My isual go to place is anaheim hillsand i love their service and food . Last night we happened to end up the one in Brea and i dont wanna say but but i had a horrible experience ever with quality of food. We ordered egg rolls and jermiah red for starters and avocado rolls arrived after wait of 35 mins and that too uncooked and cold :( . After that we ordered jambalaya and cherry salmon and told the server that avocado rolls were cold so she made sure that our rest off food os burnt and overlly cooked. They totally killed our taste that i would think before going and eating and Bj's again."
Sophia V.,"Yorba Linda, CA",222,171,179,4.0,1/29/2015,"I've never actually dined in at this BJ's location. I've only gotten take out  twice and never had any issues with it. The hostess is so sweet! Their steak, pizza, and pasta are very good! The chicken and shrimp jambalaya is alright, tastes gets bland after. I love their clam chowder! Just the right amount of clams and creaminess. I prefer this location over the one in Anaheim Hills (which is 7 minutes away from home.) This BJ's is worth the 15 minute drive for better food and service."
Rod C.,"Brea, CA",322,121,606,3.0,1/15/2016,"I usually love BJ's, and this was a mixed visit for me. The food was terrific, our server took really good care of us, but the person at the front messed up and we waited almost two hours to be seated. We were given multiple wait times and we had to wait much longer than that. The manager apologized and gave us an appetizer on the house (by then, we were starving after all that waiting) and she was really courteous about it. Everything else was good, but the long wait did alter our experience. We were tired, hungry, and a little grouchy after waiting for so long. I know it wasn't the whole staff's fault. It shows how a restaurant staff truly is a team and how one person can mess it up for everyone. I'll still plan on going back eventually."
Sylvia C.,"Buena Park, CA",0,11,5,2.0,8/31/2017,"Dine in is Okay, but this review is strictly regarding DELIVERY. This is a rather new feature, I believe, and yes things can be improved. The order: BBQ chicken pizza, avocado eggrolls, BBQ boneless wings, cream soda. Delivery time: fast! and on time, but the driver made us go to the car, not attempt to come to our apartment, granted it is gated.. The error: incorrect wings (they brought spicy buffalo... which the kids cannot eat, thats why we ordered BBQ), missing soda (probably the easiest item to bring), and soggy eggrolls. The offered solution: to leave and bring back the soda Xs 2. The wait: 45 minutes later my brother and his kids were still waiting, it was movie night and we didnt want to be interrupted with the delivery of soda. we called the restaurant and the delivery person was still there getting ready to leave for another delivery and will drop the soda off after.  We said forget it, take off the soda, and the wings, and the delivery fee... They did take off the wings and soda, but the delivery fee remained.  The take away: DO NOT DO DELIVERY, not worth it. Soggy food, missing items, incorrect items. Dine in, however, is ok."
Gia L.,"Westminster, CA",496,161,46,2.0,2/2/2017,"The food is delicious with a wide variety of types of choices. The service could be better. Sometimes the servers take too long to bring the food and one time I went there, they forgot what I had ordered when the bill came. I tried it there a couple of times but the service seems to be a little chaotic at times. They do have a large selection of beers though as well as a pizza-sized cookie. So there's no problems with their desserts."
Ranj P.,"Orange County, CA",142,172,26,3.0,7/14/2017,"The food at this location is pretty average, but I always find the wait staff here always in a rush even when it's not that busy. It feels like it's always the same, I personally do not feel like I see anything new or exciting in their menus other than their growing Pizookie selection. I almost always order a pizza when I come here and that decision has always served me well , you can't really mess up a pizza right ? Occasionally, when I'm really hungry and I'm with a larger group of people we will all order a variety of appetizers and share them amongst ourselves and when those occasions occur almost all of us are always happy with our menu choices. I will say that though they do not do it often I am a big fan of their promotions. I love it when they offer 2 salads or soups, 1 pizza and one dessert for $20. At that price you can't go wrong, but like I said before, it does not happen often and most of the times when I've asked waiters or waitresses in the past about it, they didn't seem very happy  that I knew about that promotion as its not very publicly advertised. Anyways this is a good spot to get some pizza if you re in the mood."
Melissa N.,"Anaheim, CA",0,1,,1.0,5/20/2016,"Parking sucked. Had to squeeze into a compact space. Tried calling in for a reservation, but they couldn't accommodate. Decided to come anyways and ended up waiting for an hour and a half. Overall, terrible service.  By the way BJs, saying ""last call"" should mean last call. Don't keep on calling people who obviously aren't there."
CC P.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,28,8,5.0,3/25/2017,"Dinner & micro brew was excellent. Tried the avacado rolls, broccoli cheese bread bowl, boneless wings, lemon chicken, chocolate chip pazooki and berry burst beer. All of our plates and drinks were above average. Service here was good too. We will be back."
D G.,"Whittier, CA",0,4,1,4.0,2/18/2017,Came in to have a few beers but decided to order a mini pizookie. As I was patiently waiting the manager Santiago finally brought out my pizookie and took it off my bill due to it coming out longer than 10 minutes. Which I did NOT complain about or expect at all! Thank u for the great service and hospitality! Santiago went out of his way and it was greatly appreciated!
Little S.,"Schenectady, NY",4,109,5,3.0,4/22/2017,"My folks and I went there on Thursday afternoon with a $10 coupon. It was still pretty busy. City of Industry's interiors are more spacious than this one. My colony and I had spaghetti, soup, and pizza. They were good. :)"
Ale P.,"Bloomington, CA",5,54,23,5.0,1/23/2017,"This review is for our servicer, Matthew. I really hope its his name, at least that's what it says on my receipt (tall, young and had short hair). He was very friendly but soooo efficient. It was a Friday night and his section was pretty full. As soon as we got there he greeted us in a very friendly manner and brought us our drinks promptly. Even after we got out food he was constantly checking on us making sure we were ok with the food and offered to get us extra sauces for our dishes. I really appreciated the effort and going out of his way for all his guests (I noticed he was like that with every single table in his section). Keep up the good work!:)"
