Timothy H.,"Fullerton, CA",422,102,1945,5.0,4/16/2016,"Wow a great place for pizza and burgers and salads and great deserts like pozzookie, I love this place for lunch or dinner. You will too."
Deziree J.,"Placentia, CA",15,24,5,5.0,5/6/2016,"My husband and I just left this Bjs location. We have Michael as our server and he was INCREDIBLE. It was crazy busy tonight (Friday night at 8pm) and right away Michael stopped and asked us what we wanted to drink, we also ordered an appetizer. We then asked about a pizza they used to make (they made it for us yay!) we got our appetizer within 10 minutes of ordering it. Michael had pretty much most of the bar area to serve yet he came and checked on us multiple times (having conversations with us each time) he got our food out to us quickly and had an awesome attitude and a smile every time he stopped at our table.  Thank you SO much Michael for making our date night such an incredible night!  We will defiantly be back and ALWAYS asking for Michael to be our waiter."
Maria N.,"Whittier, CA",3,14,2,1.0,7/31/2017,"We are fans of BJ's and have been to this location in the past but they have lost our business after this last visit. We were there on a Monday at 1pm and it was not crowded but the service and food were both so disappointing. Our drinks came to us warm with very little ice and only one person was offered a refill. My daughter and I were brought salads with literally no dressing. We had to wait 10 minutes before we could find someone to ask for sides of dressing and then he still never brought any. The lettuce was wilted and awful looking. My mom has special dietary concerns so we asked for a plain baked potato but got  a tiny over-cooked rock. We tried to order her green beans (that were on the menu) but they didn't have any so we ordered a side of fruit. The side of fruit was RIDICULOUS. A teeny tiny little bowl that was half full no less! Like 3 bites of fruit... I thought it had to be a kids menu thing but no! Here's a tip- double or triple the price and make it a regular sized serving of fruit! Good lord! We also ordered the poké (we get it every time) and there were three little tiny cubes of avacado on the plate.. not even a full slice! If I hadn't eaten this there before I wouldn't have even known they were screwing us. So look, if you have a restaurant and want people to eat there, you actually have to serve a decently prepared, proper amount of food. ALSO- the table next to us? Those poor guys waited 45 dang minutes and all they ordered was a pazookie! (And their drinks had no ice either) So if you are a BJ's fan, seriously avoid this location. They'll take your money and give nothing in return."
Nick S.,"Whittier, CA",0,2,,5.0,12/3/2016,"A group of four of us came in at 10, we were told it would be a 25 minute wait 10 minutes later we were siting at a table.. our servers name was Michael by far the best server at bj's we have ever had never let a glass go empty. The food was brought out he came by our table and realized what were missing without us even asking. If anyone comes to this establishment ask to be sat in Michaels section he won't let you down at all.. fast super friendly server. Thank you Michael for the great service."
Mike T.,"Los Angeles, CA",468,366,4,5.0,12/20/2016,"Great service from my bartender. Very attentive, problem solver. Great wings and great pizookie dessert"
Nathan C.,"La Mirada, CA",4,17,29,1.0,1/16/2017,"Jeremiah Red. Today it was sour.. I tried to get someone to listen to me and Eric (mgr) said there was nothing wrong with it, but ""A"" bartender said it did not taste right. I think the lines still had chemicals in it after cleaning.  Anyway today's beer selection sucked !"
Ammar M.,"Buena Park, CA",10,31,4,1.0,1/26/2017,"So I took my entire family to have dinner there for a special occasion for my nephews birthday we had a total of 20 people in our party. They had only one waiter taking care of that entire section that included four more tables so the service was really poor after finally getting the food out we were not provided with any silverware. after our multiple requests and me personally walking inside the restaurant from the patio area to ask about the silverware the food was already cold. The patio area with a little cold we off for the heater to be turned on to be told that the heater was broken. So I brought all of my concerns to the manager who simply said (I'm sorry about that) and walked away and never came back to check on us or to offer any resolution.  The waiter was very kind and tried his very best to jump between tables, the manager on the other hand basically provided the poorest customer service I've ever seen a restaurant manager offers. I will never go back to that restaurant again."
Jay K.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,32,,1.0,2/10/2017,Such a disappointment this used to be a great restaurant. They serve soggy buffalo wings. And run celery. There doesn't seem to be a manager working on Friday night. Run by a bunch of teenagers
Karen N.,"San Diego, CA",25,3,,5.0,8/5/2017,"Our experience was absolutely perfect. Before going in I downloaded their app and put our name on the waitlist, while arriving we only waited for about 5 minutes  then we ordered our food. In which they took a little long with our wings due to how busy they were, which we understood. But the manager came to our table and apologize for how long it took and said that they were going to be free. Couldn't get better than that. Our deep dish pep pizza was so delish. Our waiter was super nice and always asking what we needed. Overall had a wonderful experience. The food, service and everything were exceptional. My family and I can't wait to go back"
Caitlin B.,"Orange, CA",424,48,6,1.0,6/22/2015,"The only real reason I'm upset is because I ordered takeout which was decent and I ordered a pazookie to go because that's really the only reason people go to BJ's and when I go to open my cookie, it's burnt.. Ruining my experience and crave for a chocolate chunk cookie.  You guys came through with the pazookie like LeBron James came through for Cleveland..... :("
Lauren U.,"Coral Gables, FL",11,6,2,5.0,2/1/2017,"This place couldn't get much better to me! Their food is amazing and don't even get me started on their PIZOOKIES! So amazing. If their is a long wait, no worries cuz they usually have room in the bar area and you can seat yourself ."
Jaimie W.,"Orange County, CA",168,334,498,3.0,8/18/2015,"Came here this past weekend for a big group dinner, and also since I missed coming to BJ's since high school days.   Pros:  - fun weight scales as pizza stands - delicious pizookies Cons: -service..slow and not careful (some people were missing plates, some were missing utensils, etc...) -pizzas are good,but too bready"
Matthew R.,"Norwalk, CA",42,19,28,1.0,12/18/2016,The exprinace i had today was horrible. normally it would be the fault of the waiter but what i notice today if you dont have a strong management team who supports you how can you not fail. So 100% i put the blame on the management team at bj for the horrible service. It was slow and he brought me the change wrong. Also my California chicken sandwich the chicken was burnt. I hope that bjs can learn from this and notice when a team member needs help or back up maybe  even a little more training. Grow from your mistakes and fix them.
Terry D.,"Brea, CA",4,131,10,2.0,12/27/2016,"Nice selection. Pizza, salads, burgers. Even steaks. Service is another thing. Tonight service was awful. Slow. After we were finished I sat there holding my card. There were 7 servers plus a manager. They were laughing and having a great time. Not paying any attention to us or anyone else."
Stephanie G.,"Anaheim, CA",73,23,,5.0,7/25/2016,We came here for our lunch hour. It is now past an hour. I ordered a steak it was overcooked by a lot. Sent it back and waited and waited.  Then I had to get it to go. Now I am waiting for the check. Not a fast place for lunch. 07/25/16. Server was excellent. This is the best service I have ever had at BJ's. I did not get his name. Tall thin guy. Kudo's to him!!! Food was also great today.
Ashley S.,"Fullerton, CA",1,9,2,1.0,2/2/2017,"I rarely go to BJs, but I'll be honest when I do I never expect great service but the drinks are always decent and the food is usually good. On my last visit I was with four other close friends of mine celebrating my boyfriends birthday, we found a spot at the bar and our waitress fumbled over to us checking our IDs as we ordered our drinks. Long story short she got to my boyfriend (who turned 25 today) and his ID expires the day of his birth and without her even wishing him a happy birthday she told him she couldn't serve him. First off IDs are expired the day AFTER their date of expiration, and it was his freaking birthday so is friendly compassionate service so much to ask for?! The manager came over and was EXTREMELY rude and told us once again they could not serve him. Let's just say they lost A LOT of business that night and even more for life, ridiculous."
Robert H.,"La Habra, CA",97,4,,1.0,11/5/2016,"We placed an online order and received a confirmation number. Upon arriving, the employee couldn't find the reservation. He called over a manager and the manager said that we did it wrong. I had my wife screen shot the confirmation page and manager had nothing to say. System issues happen but rather than chasing, make the issue right. Thanks for wasting 20 minutes of my time."
Jake K.,"Whittier, CA",176,12,1,5.0,10/21/2016,"We went for my wife's birthday tonight with a party of 12 and we had Adam as our server!! Everything was perfect, from the food to the weather and especially the service. Adam was perfect and met every needed tonight and made my wife's birthday special. It's hard to take care of a party that size especially with two kids and he couldn't have done a better job. Plus the birthday pizzokie was amazing!! Thank you BJ's and Adam!"
cynthia v.,"Anaheim, CA",84,27,32,5.0,10/23/2015,The wait wasn't bad for a Friday night. Drinks were tasty. Rootbeer yum! Classic margarita yum yum.  Calamari for appetizer.  The buffalo chicken pizza oh goodness  Salted caramel pizookie.  I'm so done!  Or waiter was so nice and patient.
Aleah G.,"Brea, CA",8,2,,1.0,1/22/2017,"This place has great food, however the service is not attentive. They believed I was intoxicated and I am totally sober. I felt judged on my personality. I use to love this place, but I don't feel comfortable coming back."
