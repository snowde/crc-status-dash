Valerie F.,"Brea, CA",85,3,2,2.0,10/21/2016,"Called before they opened on accident, but they were accommodating enough to take the order anyways and said it would be sent to the kitchen at 11 for pickup between 1125-1130. Went at 1130 to pay and pick up our order and it was not ready until now, 1155pm. Was disappointed that for takeout, the time scheduled was not the time the food was ready. Even if it was a couple of minutes past the time it would've been fine.  It's hard if you're on a schedule."
Keith N.,"Riverside, CA",0,1,,5.0,2/3/2017,We visited BJ's a few days ago and the service was great and our server Santiago was very polite. He made our visit very enjoyable. We will definitely go back.
Jacqueline R.,"Los Angeles, CA",2491,927,2572,5.0,3/27/2014,"2014 YELP 365 CHALLENGE - 158/365 This is a really great BJ's location! I have been to several locations and this has to be one of the better ones. My boyfriend and I aren't usually in the Brea area, but we come here occasionally.  We dined here for the second time a few days ago. It was pretty busy for a Saturday so had to wait around 25 minutes to get seated. The entryway was pretty packed with lots of people waiting to be seated. They had an ample amount of seating for waiting customers, but it still wasn't enough! They also have the takeout station/cash registers in the entryway next to the door, so that can cause some traffic as well. Interestingly enough I didn't see any customers picking up takeout in the 25 minutes that I was waiting there. They have some pretty interesting architecture here that I haven't seen at other locations. It's boredline castle-like with these big stone arches inside the restaurant. See my uploaded photos for reference. They also had pictures of half naked men in the womens' bathroom...weird? Haha. Service was pretty good! Our waiter was good, and had just the right amount of attentiveness but not overdoing it. For being as busy as they were, we didn't have to wait TOO long for our food to arrive. I have no complaints on my food and it was just the way I like it! Overall, other than the long wait time (which honestly was just because we went on a Saturday evening), I have no complaints about this BJ's! 5 stars!"
Denise O.,"La Mirada, CA",1,31,2,4.0,12/12/2016,"I coordinated my daughters 11th birthday at the BJ's location in Brea and was so pleased with the end result! Danny, the Brea Manager, was so helpful. He took time to walk me through menu options and recommendations to keep me on my budget and ensure enough food for my party of 20. The entire team, including our server was right on point, and the minute I arrived had my order in hand and ready to go. The dinner was a great success all thanks to the Brea team! Thank you Danny, for your time, attention to detail and assistance! I will certainly host another birthday at your location again."
Raelene S.,"Whittier, CA",0,14,2,1.0,1/26/2017,This use to be my favorite BJ's... walked inside right now for a late lunch and NO hostess was up front to seat us. Servers/bussers stare at me and boyfriend like idiots as if they can't take initiative to seat us! Don't you want tables!? Last time I'll ever go there.
Thomas T.,"Fullerton, CA",310,289,411,4.0,7/24/2015,Pretty good food here tonight.  Two of my friends had the Hickory Brisket bacon burger. They loved it. Very well made.  I had the salmon with quinoa. Also very good. Well balanced and tasty.  Wife had the Parmasean crusted chicken but it was a tad small portion for the price of $15.00.  Service was pretty good. OWe ended with the Pazooki. Can't go wrong with that! Always a great desert. Our server was very nice.
William L.,"Brea, CA",0,3,1,5.0,1/20/2017,"Just got done taking the family out to BJ's and all of us left completely satisfied. Food was correct, beer was cold, and the service was outstanding. Not only was our server (please forgive me if I spelled wrong, Fraze) was attentive but made sure that our drinks never emptied and that our food was correct and to our liking. She even plated our pizza for us. As my family and I left I forgot our take home container and Fraze chased us down to hand us our forgotten mid nite snack. Thank for an awesome dining experience, we will be back!!!"
Cyn D.,"Whittier, CA",175,39,97,4.0,4/29/2016,BJ's always has good food! The wait time given to us was about 30 minutes but we were seated in less than 20 minutes which was good since we were hungry! :)   Our server was friendly and courteous and tried to be as helpful as possible considering how busy it was.  I found a 20% discount toward our meal and our server was so helpful to make sure that it was applied accordingly.  The plus side was not only did we get to enjoy great pizza we also had the option of trying the Pizookie with ice cream and a great deal! :)
Nancy L.,"Pomona, CA",57,139,37,3.0,2/9/2016,"After a long drive to San Diego to deliver a car, my boyfriend and I were STARVING! We were craving a moscow mule and pizza from yard house but they closed early everywhere. We decided to go to BJ's since it was opened until 1am.  We arrived around 11:50pm and there was no one in front to greet or seat us so we walked right to the bar area. We sat there patiently even though we were starving. After 10 minutes, no one has came to our table to serve us. i started getting irritated and my friend got up and went to the bartender and asked for a server. The Bartender had to walk around the whole bar area and the back to find the server for us.  Finally our server too our order. My friend ordered a moscow mule and asked for belvedere vodka instead. The server said, ""But it's an extra charge for belvedere."" My friend just replied, ""that's fine."" This bothered me because every time we order our moscow mule, our server would say, ""It'll be an extra charge, will that be okay."" .. So, I thought okay, maybe I'm grumpy because I'm hungry. Nope, we ordered pizza with everything on it and asked for thin crust and she said that it's not on happy hour. My friend then says, ""I don't care, I just want thin crust."" ... Really, BJ's? Not everyone is there to take advantage of happy hour which would be nice but this is the way we want our food and drinks, happy hour or not.  Anyways, all that and they didn't even have the ginger beer to make the moscow mule. Our food came out perfect. Pizza was amazing. Service wasn't so good, I was bothered."
Frank A.,"Beaumont, CA",0,9,3,3.0,12/29/2016,"My family and I were getting pretty bad service, or lack there of, when I checked the Yelp review on BJs. Not too surprised, but very disappointing to find that Yelp has most BJs locations at 3 stars. The visit we had proved Yelp to be right on though. I hadn't been to BJs for a while but while the food was still good the service was bad enough that I won't go back any time soon. Long waits, forgotten parts of our order, slow refills, and unfriendly service."
Danielle J.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,46,4,2.0,11/23/2016,"This BJs was just ok. Service was ok. The waitress was nice. Busser was kind of rude. Overall experience was just ""ok"". We got dessert here and the pizookies were good but the vibe at this restaurant wasn't the best. Maybe we got it on an off night"
Katherine T.,"Anaheim, CA",0,18,18,4.0,7/17/2016,"Service was great, food was alright have had better Ahi Tuna salad elsewhere.  Pizookie was really good order the white chocolate macadamia nut with vanilla ice cream."
Jackie R.,"Buena Park, CA",47,49,12,4.0,9/11/2016,I had a good experience here. Only gave them four stars was because the lady with our food couldn't find us even passed us twice. The waitress kinda rushed us. I understand it busy and can get a little hectic but overall she was okay. The food was good as always but the drink taste sweet with no alcohol which was a bummer!
Emily R.,"Whittier, CA",147,6,,3.0,9/22/2016,Came in for lunch while my car was getting worked on at Sears Auto. Sat in the bar section and had a waitress named Stephanie. Cute blonde girl. She was super perky and professional. The food itself was just okay but it made it all better to have Stephanie as our waitress. It was the lunch rush and it looked like they may have been short staffed but Stephanie handled it all. She is definitely a wonderful asset to your restaurant. The food definitely could have been better. 3 stars for the food but 5 stars for Stephanie.  Kudos to you Stephanie - you're doing a great job!
Star D.,"Fullerton, CA",36,122,53,1.0,4/5/2017,"I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THIS LOCATION!!! Came here 4/2/17 for my daughters birthday. We use this location to celebrate all our birthdays, graduations, etc...So party of 15 we came in for a 6:30 reservation. To be honest service was pretty good, but a little off with 1 guest ordering only soup and it came out 15min after everyone else food. It was also cold and being that is was broccoli cheese soup it was so thick and non edible. That being said I would never write a review on something so minor. THE REAL PROBLEM IS THE MANAGER OF THIS LOCATION DANNY MILLER. He is THE WORST human in a customer service job that I have ever dealt with. He is dismissing and condescending. He lacks compassion and care for consumers. I actually had to have 2 separate interactions with him this week and they were both HORRIBLE.  I left this location trembling with anger and frustration today. I'm still in shock by the way I was treated. For someone in a job that requires customer care this guy gets an F! I really hope corporate sees this review or calls me back, nobody should get away with treating someone so poorly. So congrats Danny Miller you just lost a whole gang of  long term great customers. Go to Lazy Dog or Cheesecake Factory instead if your contemplating visiting this location..**update**Pretty sure the responce is standard. This guy 100% meant to act the way he acted. He belittled me over the phone and in person. Unless he can figure out whom stole or mishandled some bday cards or magically finds them like he did the credit card (that wasn't logged in, accounted for, and placed in the exact spot everyday for the 4 to 5 credit cards left behind.) All credibility has been lost. His answer is to take a name and number with no intent to help"
Angel G.,"Stanton, CA",10,15,2,5.0,5/4/2016,"Chase (""Chase, as in the bank"" direct quote ) was quite possibly the best server my party of 10 college students could've gotten. We were all on our way back from our exhausting 3 day conference. Because we received funding from our school for food, we're required to keep our receipts - so it's preferred that we pay separately. Trust me, I know it's a big pain in the ass so I made sure to ask if it was okay. Bless Chase's soul because he said he would do it, no problem  Although we were lowkey rowdy and obnoxious (probably highkey, but it could've been worse), Chase remained kind and as accommodating as possible :) Lastly, I've got to share my favorite part of my time there. So my party was ordering dessert, and Chase tried to convince me to order a pizookie since I only ordered shrimp tacos (I was trying to be good since I didn't go to the gym all weekend lol). I didn't end up ordering one (even though I was verrrry tempted) because I didn't have enough money. However! He ended up ordering a free birthday pizookie for me (and seemed to have overheard me saying that white chocolate macadamia nut is my favorite!!!)! I truly appreciate his thoughtfulness, and it meant a lot to me because I actually didn't have a birthday dinner with my friends (my birthday was in February lol). Thank you so much for making our experience great!"
Hayley M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",30,9,14,4.0,2/3/2015,"My best friend and I came here for dessert after a long day at Disneyland. We were seated right away but the people working there seemed to be standing around talking a lot. No one greeted us on the way in, and no one said anything on the way out. There were at least 5 people at the door each time. I dont necessarily need to be greeted, but its nice to know youre wanted there!      The pazookis we ordered were amazing. I got the white chocolate macadamia nut, and my best friend had the classic chocolate chip. They have those, salted caramel, peanut butter, peanut butter smore, cookies and creme, and I believe oatmeal. Always save room for a pazooki at this place! There is nothing in the world like a pazooki!      Our waitress was very nice, and on her game. She pretty much made up for the fact that there are a ton of people hanging out by the door doing Lord knows what."
Derek R.,"Whittier, CA",20,4,,1.0,12/19/2016,"After shopping at the Brea Mall we decided to stop at BJ's for a bite. We were seated immediately, checked out the menu and were ready to order. After 15 minutes of sitting there with not so much as a hello, and nothing to drink, we got up and left. I told the front desk that the menus looked great and if we had been waited on we probably would have ordered. Can't judge the food. Service SUCKED. One less restaurant for us to visit. Hey guys, be more cognizant of your newly seated customers."
Marie G.,"Anaheim, CA",5,5,8,2.0,4/28/2017,"came here 04/23/17 with a group of friends, wait time was 10min not bad. only reason why I give is 2 stars is because they messed up of 4 of our food plates. baked potato was old and burnt, steak was RAW, well done steak was burnt all over, wings had no sauce whatsoever. Probably wont come back again."
Ariana D.,"Orange County, CA",115,48,20,3.0,1/5/2016,"Bj's in my opinion has really became more commercialized as the years pass which is why I typically avoid this restaurant, however it was a friends birthday so I paid my dues & attended. This one is specifically located inside the mall parking lot past Cheesecake Factory around the same area as Sears & Nordstroms. Parking is difficult depending on the day/night due to being in a busy mall parking lot, so if you find a spot, take it! Now onto the Restaurant. We had an extremely large party of over 25 people, but the staff certainly took care of us & really made sure we were okay across the board. Our main server wasn't too knowledgable about drinks other than the beers. I asked a question about a sangria & he was grasping for any type of lifeline to help him, as my friend interrupted & asked if they only had a blood orange flavor, which in fact they did at the time. The food however is just mediocre in my opinion. It had its highlights & lowlights. I was loved loved loved the Sriracha Brussle Sprouts, yum!! We ended up ordering two extra rounds, delicious, even if you're not a fan of Brussels. The pizza is just whatever, the toppings are what makes it. The traditional pan style is dry and you kinda have to dunk it in ranch to make it palatable despite the toppings which is a disappointment. Onto the Pizookie, well how can you go wrong with that? Par-baked cookie fresh out of the oven & ice cream, yeah its still as delicious as it used to be (I ordered the cookies & cream).  If you do have a big party like we did, tell folks to bring cash. Its one big fat check with of course gratuity included."
