Rachel J.,"Newport Beach, CA",106,19,3,2.0,5/28/2017,"We came to this bjs for a birthday as it was a good location for our friends with a new baby. I'm giving two stars because we were a group of 13 including three kids. Having been a server in my past i under stand the struggle. What I don't understand is them taking orders on an iPad. Our waitress had a very hard time with it. We had friends wanting to look at the menu more before ordering she got frustrated cuz she took half the orders and said the iPad will time out in five minutes. Ok so submit this order and put the others in later or right them down...drinks were forgot. Come time for the bill we waited a half hour from the time we got it to the time she brought it back to us. I had to go to the hostess where every time many servers were just hanging out. They told me the waitress had to get manager approval. The waitress told me it was hard because we split the bill. It was 3 cards and cash and we wrote the amount down for each card. Shouldn't take a half hour no matter how busy. I think if servers were assigned at tables they can handle it would benefit the restaurant. The icing on the cake...the bathroom looked like someone tepeed it, it was so messy. No toilet paper other than all over the ground. Wont be going back, made me me really appreciate the restaurants close to home in Newport."
Dominic O.,"Placentia, CA",51,12,21,5.0,1/14/2015,"Had a simple mini meal date with my boyfriend and got seated right away. The Tuscan Tomato Bisque was significantly tasty, perfect balance, not to heavy on herbs or tomato flavors. We split a Personal Pepperoni Pizza which was baked perfectly and he had the Gourmet Macaroni Cheese, topped with a generous amount of bacon. And to wash it all down we each had a Blonde Michilada  Mmmmmmm definitely a great mini date."
Bobbie M.,"Riverside, CA",112,66,,4.0,11/4/2016,"My friend & I really enjoyed our meal & dessert tonight.  Our waiter, Mark, was friendly, answered our questions regarding the menu & seemed to know when we needed another drink or refill our water glasses.  He's definitely an asset to the restaurant."
Kari V.,"Gaslamp, San Diego, CA",0,36,40,2.0,1/21/2016,"Food & drinks are good quality.  Love their happy hour.  Service at this location has really improved over the years.  But literally EVERY SINGLE TIME that I dine here, the woman's restroom is a disaster!  Tonight, only one of the three stalls had toilet paper and none had seat protectors.. Trash was overflowing.  This is the one area that needs major improvement."
Dave P.,"Berrien Springs, Berrien Springs, MI",30,3,,4.0,6/2/2017,The Mango IPA was amazing and I wish I could have sampled some of the many other many microbrews that were on tap! The pizza left a little to be desired (it was a thick crust and wasn't very hot in the middle) and that is the reason for 4 versus 5 stars.  The service was top shelf!
Kat H.,"Pomona, CA",23,218,431,4.0,2/28/2016,Good choice for any type of munchie feeling.  They got everything and even a great selection of on the light side choices.  He pizookie at the end ruins it all though.  It's a cookie served hot with cold IcreAm on top.  It's thier specialty.  Comes in many varieties and we like the peanut butter right now
Sandy O.,"Brea, CA",73,43,49,5.0,11/8/2015,"Ask for Garrett to be your server. He did an outstanding job. He knew the menu, drinks and desserts from the top of his head.  Host said wait was 30-40 min wait for a Friday night. We waited it took 25 mins for table for 4. We order appetizers. Took about 10 mins and the rest of the food about another 10mins. We then ordered desserts and came out in 10 mins... Best hour we had. Great place for family and adults. Love how we can talk and laugh and enjoy the great food and service   My son was extremely happy he didn't have to ask for refills. Garrett had it ready before he was finished with the recent one.  Food was great!!! And desserts too. The wait time wasn't as bad and we did get our food in a good time. Thanks Oh yeah the jambalaya is my favorite, a bit spicy. Num num yummy in my tummy :)"
Allison B.,"Fullerton, CA",13,25,17,3.0,10/4/2016,"Slow service today, ordered the chicken club sandwich, it was ok. I could have made a better one at home... the French frys were excellent, nice and hot and fresh. No one asked us how our food was. Instead they made sure our water was topped off. Waiting on pizookie... I'm sure that will be good."
Kelli S.,"Honolulu, HI",1902,1170,9782,5.0,11/12/2014,"When I was going to school in the area, this BJ's was my go-to location because it was the closest one to me. Even though I no longer am in the Brea area on the regular basis, this is still one of my favorite locations. Though I have experienced long-ish wait times in the past and the restaurant is noisy, the quality of my food has always been really good. And--contrary to other locations--this location always does a stellar job with my ""Gourmet Mac and Cheese."" Here's what I would recommend when it comes to BJ's. Note: This review is primarily Pizookie-based because I always get one from here! ""Gourmet Mac and Cheese"": Sometimes I just get this mac and cheese dish as an entrée. When I got it from this Brea BJ's, it was extremely cheesy and didn't disappoint. I ordered it once in the restaurant and once for take-out, but it tasted so much better when I dined in. This mac and cheese dish features Rotini pasta with three cheeses, chipotle and garlic, and it's topped with smoked bacon bits and seasoned bread crumbs. It also comes with two, crispy pieces of garlic bread, which are perfect for dipping. I love the cheesy concoction, and I can definitely taste the garlic seasoning. The bacon bits add the perfect crunch, and the seasoned breadcrumbs also add welcomed taste and texture. I love dipping my garlic bread into the mac and cheese and spreading some of the gooey, cheesy mixture on top. Some locations don't have this dish on the small bites menu anymore, but when I last went to this location in May 2014, they still had it. I really hope they don't take it off more of the menus!   ""BJ's Peanut Butter S'mores"": I have to admit, I was a bit doubtful of this ""S'Mores"" Pizookie because I don't like lots of marshmallow ... in any of my desserts. But I was pleasantly surprised and delighted with BJ's take on the classic campfire treat because THIS version featured a layer of creamy peanut butter. That's right--the BJ's twist features a Ghirardelli triple chocolate cookie (one of my favorites because it's super chocolaty) topped with a peanut butter layer and completed with marshmallow fluff that's baked to a golden finish and vanilla bean ice cream. I thought the marshmallow layer would be overwhelming and too much for me to handle, but I was wrong. I rather enjoyed the toasted marshmallow layer and was able to pair it nicely with the rich, chocolate cookie and rapidly melting ice cream. I felt that the vanilla ice cream melted quicker than usual while I was enjoying this treat, but probably because of the added heat from the torched marshmallow fluff. I very much enjoyed this ""S'Mores"" Pizookie and hope it won't leave the menu anytime soon. The peanut butter layer truly revolutionizes this treat and makes a world of difference. I think the only thing that would make this dessert even better is if graham cracker crumbs were used somehow, maybe to sprinkle the top of the Pizookie.   ""Pizookie Trio"": This dessert option is great for sharing, especially if you're torn between several different Pizookies. These mini Pizookies (definitely smaller than the original; probably half the size or smaller than a regular-sized Pizookie) come with one scoop of ice cream each (your choice of flavor). You can choose one of the designated Pizookies from the menu; when I got this dish, I opted for ""Cookies 'n Cream,"" ""Triple Chocolate Made with Ghirardelli"" and ""Peanut Butter."" It was a hard decision, as I like the original ""Chocolate Chunk"" Pizookie as well, but I was completely satisfied with the different varieties. I shared this decadent dessert with my boyfriend, and we actually demolished most of it, as the mini Pizookies were definitely smaller (and so were the ice cream scoops). Would definitely recommend this if you're torn between two different Pizookies (and the problem can't be solved by getting half of one flavor and half of another in the same dish). ""Triple Chocolate Pizookie Made with Ghirardelli"": This Pizookie option is a great choice for extreme chocoholics. It features a rich chocolate cookie made with chunks of Ghirardelli chocolate, and it's topped off with two scoops of double chocolate ice cream, Ghirardelli chocolate chips and a Ghirardelli SQUARES dark chocolate. Yum! This dessert is definitely not for the faint of heart. Because I have an extreme sweet tooth, I ordered this Pizookie for myself once--the boyfriend insisted on getting a ""Salted Caramel Pizookie"" all to himself--and I was able to finish all of mine. I loved the fudgy, chocolaty cookie paired with the chocolate ice cream, and the chocolate chips added a decadent crunch to the mix. And, of course, the Ghirardelli dark chocolate SQUARES just put the perfect finishing touch on the sinfully sweet treat."
Wazcrakin P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,52,20,4.0,8/26/2015,"Came for lunch. We were seated quick and drink order took only a couple minutes. Place is a little loud but tolerable. Food didn't take that long to come out and the BBQ brisket burger with bacon is BOMB!  A little weird that they bring out a scale to hold the pizza and a prison tray for your food, but hey food was good and drinks were refilled quickly. First time at this Bj's. Just saw that if you check out with their app you get 20% off the order. Bill went from 63$ to 50$. Sweet!"
Joseph H.,"Cypress, CA",42,6,,5.0,8/7/2016,"yummy, good service, server was Matthew, he was super nice and hospitable. I don't yelp much, tl;dr good food, good service"
Steffy M.,"Yorba Linda, CA",312,2,,1.0,11/26/2016,"Made a yelp specifically to complain about this place. I have gotten terrible service on several acccounts. I love BJ's, the food and atmosphere is great.  But the Brea BJ's puts all of them to shame.  In the past year I have gone to the BJ's maybe 5-6 times, and every single time I have gotten terrible service.  The first time, I ordered a MINI pizooki and it took an hour. Really??? Furthermore, the waiter was no where to be seen the entire time.  I myself, who is also a waiter at a restuarant, know how difficult it can be at times so I let it go.  The second time I came was with my boyfriend and his family for his birthday.  We ordered a large pizza and it took an hour to come out. I understand pizza takes a long time to cook, but once it came out we found a HUGE strand of hair in the sauce.  When we told the server, she awkwardly walked away (without taking the nasty pizza) and called her manager to come over. The manager asked if we wanted another pizza, but at this time we weren't hungry because everyone had already ate their food except for the people who wanted the pizza. Another time I came, the server was NO WHERE TO BE FOUND.  We all finished our waters & had nothing to drink once the food came out because he never came back to refill our cups.  On another account, the server kept bringing waters out for us.  There were 5 people in my party, and at the end of the night there were 16 glasses. No, I am not making this up.  And they were ALL full, none of us were drinking that much water.  Why the server thought it would be smart to keep bringing out waters, I don't know. (We're in a drought- come one!) The final straw was yesterday.  I came in with a party of 8, and everything was fine until it was time to pay the check.  The server never came by to take the check, and we just sat at the table for about 30 minutes waiting for him to come back.  They also over estimate their wait times by way too much.   All in all, the food is good, but the service here is TERRIBLE.  If you're in the area, just go to the Cheesecake factory, it's right across from BJ's.   If you want good and quick service, don't come here."
Chris J.,"Alhambra, CA",2,147,410,4.0,10/8/2016,Service was okay....only okay.  Pizza was great and potato skin was awesome.  Of course our 2 pitchers of beer was even better.
Nesly I.,"Long Beach, CA",76,30,15,5.0,10/7/2016,"Whenever somebody mentions the restaurant BJ's, probably the first thing to come to their mind is their famed pizookie. Or their pizzas! Or heck, even their home brewed beer! I can now say that I have tried all 3, and possibly much more!"
Jessica O.,"Whittier, CA",0,22,4,5.0,4/6/2017,"Always a favorite spot of my friends and family but today at lunch was extra good. We placed our names on the wait list through the app but when we got there they said they didn't have our name in the system. They were super nice about it though and said they would seat us as soon as possible ( 3 adults and 4 kids 2 & under). Our waiter Bryce was extremely nice, very attentive and we hardly had to ask for anything. Always had refills when we needed them, food came out promptly and he even got the kids food out first because he knew they were getting hangry :) Would go back regardless & would for sure love to have this waiter again!"
Richele A.,"Long Beach, CA",9,1,,2.0,4/5/2017,"I never write reviews,  but I'm so upset about the to go service I received tonight that I felt compelled. I called when I was ten to fifteen minutes away to place an order for pick up and got two people that put me on hold. No one ever picked back up so I ended up just hanging up and going inside to place the order. There were at least 2-3 people working the to go area that I saw behind the counter and it wasn't even that busy. A young man with brown hair helped me and put in my order. I asked him for two sides of sour cream with my potato skins and he confirmed. When I got home, there were two sides of ranch and a side of this disgusting yellow sauce that tasted like horseradish. I've had the potato skins here before and they don't even come with that sauce. It says on the menu SOUR CREAM and ranch. It's not rocket science people. In conclusion,  I highly suggest checking your to go orders before you leave the place."
Sarah B.,"Anaheim, CA",509,103,57,4.0,1/16/2016,"The service was good, our waitress was really nice & checked up on us often and the food was good. Only complaint was that the country fried chicken plate had almost no gravy on it so they brought a tinyyy extra side for me & I had to ask again for another side. And the bathrooms have no purse hooks! I always carry a big purse & it sucks when I have nowhere to put it in the stall. Other than that, good overall experience."
April V.,"Fullerton, CA",1,4,7,1.0,6/20/2016,Probably the worst BJ's I've ever been to. The waitress took 30 minutes to come to our table & when she did she complained and blamed other coworkers. She then brought the wrong dish out & again blamed other people. She also gave a little TMI telling my friends and I she's going to quit because the manager and her other coworkers were rude and unprofessional. All I wanted was a good time instead I got a weepy waitress.
Erica V.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,12,,2.0,3/18/2017,They took a long time to bring our food. They forgot to bring our appetizers before our meal. When they did bring the appetizers it was very cold. They comped a drink and dessert. The dessert also took long to arrive. Probably won't go back to that location.
Jim C.,"Placentia, CA",0,12,,1.0,4/20/2017,"This review started out at 3 stars and went down from their. I had a problem with my bill and  another minor problem. I filled out 3 online requests for customer service over a 2 week period and never got a response, I tried the Customer Service phone # and it's an automated system that refers you back to the web site. I guess they don't have customer service."
