Judy H.,"Yorba Linda, CA",50,2,1,4.0,10/15/2016,"Very busy night with a lot of high school homecoming groups, and our server,  Yadira was excellent and very attentive, even though she had some big parties.  My salmon was excellent and my husband said his steak was cooked just right.  She was very prompt with drink refills.  It was my birthday and she made sure to bring a mini pizookie, too!  Very pleasant evening."
Aloha B.,"Irvine, CA",8,104,48,4.0,12/21/2015,"Overall: PIZOOKIE !! enough said. Based on my multiple experiences at this location. I've been coming here since 2007 and I will still be going back :) Pros:  -They have pretty good happy hour. -Great place to come grab a bite to eat/ catch up with friends.  -They have a pretty good selection of food variety (Even have some gluten free options.)  -They have great customer service -They have a good selection of alcohol. My personal favorite is their Berry Burst Cider #I'llHaveAnotherOne Cons:  -Service can be a little on the slower side with big parties.  -Wait time can be longer than what they tell you. (I had a reservation (for a big party) and we still ended up waiting a good amount of time before we were seated )  -Big Parties= 1 big check, they don't split the bill.  (However, They did do it for me one time when I went with 16 of my friends, our server was actually amazing! She definitely got a good tip.)  TIP: If you have a big party, make a reservation.  If you are going to decorate the table with anything (Ie: Bridal shower, Birthday etc.) Get there earlier and make sure to talk to the manager on which table they're giving you so there's no miscommunication.  ( I went in for my reservation for 25 on one occasion.The Server/Hotess showed me my table, So I set up with some table decor/gifts, only to have their manager tell me I was actually at a different table..so I had to move to another table at the other Patio (They have two Patios)..It was inconvenient to say the least.But the rest of the service was good.) Overall I would recommend this place."
Virginia K.,"Orange, CA",56,67,52,2.0,10/2/2015,"Well it's been 2 months. As requested, I contacted this person by email and even gave him my phone number. Never heard anything back. This was either a ""Bot"" response or a blow-hard response from a real manager. On a lighter note.... Went to the BJs in West Covina recently and their pizza was great! Stay tuned for that review!"
Julian A.,"Long Beach, CA",1571,506,1014,4.0,8/11/2015,"Whenever somebody mentions the restaurant BJ's, probably the first thing to come to their mind is their famed pizookie. Or their pizzas! Or heck, even their home brewed beer! I can now say that I have tried all 3, and possibly much more!  Located right next to Brea Mall, BJ's is already famous in this area, which already have a bunch of other eateries nearby! I have came to this location maybe less than 5 times,  but each time has always been a great experience. I have tried just about all of their pizzas. Their sampler beer is always just one to try and enjoy. My favorite pizza I have to say is their buffalo chicken! Beware that this place is almost always full and noisy at times too. The reason I am writing this particular review for this establishment is because this was my first BJ's experience, before I started going to the others! The macadamia nut pizookie is by far my favorite dessert! You probably will not ever see my take a picture of the pizookie because by the time it has arrived to my table, it is already devoured! Inside it is big with plenty of seating. There is plenty of parking available. The mall is just right next door if you are in the need to walk off your food! What can I say? BJ's has already made a fan out of this yelper!"
Omar P.,"Brea, CA",2099,372,31,4.0,8/15/2014,"Got take out for Friday Dinner. Poke Ahi Tuna- Delicious! Quality Sushi Grade Tuna on a bed of cabbage with Avocado, Chips, and lite soy dipping sauce. Refreshing smooth and creamy. Thai Mango Chicken Salad- Dressing was a bit sour, but over all the salad was good. Highlight was the tasty chicken and the thinly sliced mango. Angus Sliders w/ Wedge cut fries- star of the dinner. Fun to eat and bursting with flavor. Cherry Chipotle Salmon- Salmon needed salt and the cous cous reminded me of tapioca balls. Just ok, but it was healthy so I won't complain too much. Total bill was around 51 dollars.  Like Chris Rock says,""Good Lord 51 dollars? How bout I give you 5 dollars and you let me lick the sauce off the plate?"""
Matthew z.,"Diamond Bar, CA",330,144,41,1.0,8/9/2015,"Wow! This isn't a review about the quality of the food getting worse; its a review about the horrible customer service.  My mother ordered a chicken club and it wasn't a chicken club! The server was great and apologetic, however the manager was the true buffoon!  My mother has never asked to speak to a a manager as she is very passive, but she was truly bothered as they are patrons here. The manager dismissed her, and said he would notify the cook, starred at her and just walked off. The server was embarrassed of his boss and tried to offer a dessert. They declined and left. My mother asked for the GM's card and he literally wouldn't give it to her.  ""we are in transition"", was his response!  Wow please train your management or hire people with common sense!  My mother will be contacting her friend at corporate and handle it correctly this week."
Jash P.,"La Mirada, CA",436,299,793,1.0,6/13/2013,"DISAPPOINTED. It's quite unfortunate to have to rate BJ's (particularly my long-time default branch) such a low rating. Order: [Eat-In] 1. Lunch Special Grilled Chicken Pasta + Caesar Salad 2. Caesar Salad + Grilled Chicken (the regular dinner size) [Take-Out] Lunch Special Grilled Chicken Pasta + Caesar Salad Pizzookie (half White Chocolate Macademia + half Chocolate Chip) Personal Sized BJ's Favorite Tastes: Grilled Chicken Pasta was mediocre. It lacked that punch of flavor; you only don't get thin strips of chicken anymore. The cut is larger than usual, probably to mask just how little you actually get now. The lettuce in the salad was lackluster too; it didn't have the crunch of freshness. The to-go orders were an utter disappointment. 1. The amount of pasta in the to-go container is SMALL; my brother even asked me if this was my leftover! Either give more pasta or downsize your to-go box (former, of course, is preferred)! 2. The pizzookie had a gaping gap in the middle of the two flavors. It did not look appetizing at all. Price: Not worth what you actually get. All of the above was already $60 (that's a lot granted we got 3 lunch special dishes). Service: Waiters weren't as attentive. It took awhile to flag them down and get our bill and change. Bottom line: If you really want BJ's, I'd stick to another branch. Other than that, go have lunch elsewhere!"
Darlene B.,"Fullerton, CA",2,39,6,1.0,2/10/2017,You haven't gotten any better on your takeout. We received our order an hour after it was promised with many mistakes and waiting for one or two items at a time to come so my $19.50 salmon dinner was cold. Other employees couldn't help us because only one girl can handle the takeout orders and obviously she could care less. Even less sympathy from the manager.  This restaurant is definitely in need of employee training in handling customers.
Buster B.,"Irvine, CA",329,60,35,2.0,8/13/2014,"What's up with the HH here?  Back in the day you would come here for HH and get some cheap food and kind of cheap drinks.  Well last night my friend and I came for the late night HH.  Which starts at 10pm ... We sat down at 9:56pm and asked for the HH menu and the bartender Robert said we needed to wait.  Hahahaha are you serious?  OK I showed him my phone which now said 9:58pm and he asked if we wanted to wait or order now.  Ummmmm ok buddy I guess my cheap ass will wait the 2 minutes.  *Gasp*   Next I order a Patron Silver chilled.  When I got my drink instead of salt on the glass he put sugar on the rim.  Ummm yeah thanks buddy!  So I told him about his mistake and then he said well it's only on half the glass.  No apology, nothing.  Regardless if sugar is on half my glass it makes my $9.50 drink experience gross.  So I asked him for a napkin since the sugar was sticky and was getting all over the place.  Instead he grabs my drink and dumps it into a new glass and walks away.  Still no apology, nothing.  I couldn't believe this guy. Now on to the HH food we got.  Since they have items for $4, $5 and $6 dollars it appears at first glance to be a great deal!  That is until you receive your food and realize these portions have been cut in half or more.  So basically you pay less, and you get a lot less.  Not sure how that is a deal then?   This place used to be decent, but after this experience I'll just drive down the street to Taps ..."
Nick H.,"Orange, CA",269,40,40,5.0,4/14/2016,"I LOVE BJ's (no pun intended) This particular location has always had great customer service and food! I order pepperoni pizza or my new recent favorite the Parmesan crusted chicken with broccoli and mash potatoes, IT IS SO GOOD!!! Everyone is very friendly and they greet you throughout your entire dining experience. This restaurant is additionally awesome cuz they have a little bit of everything so no matter who you are with they should be able to find something! Highly recommended."
Emlyn D.,"La Habra, CA",46,41,17,1.0,8/15/2015,"My mom and I got sick eating here yesterday afternoon. I got the seared ahi salad and she got the Santa Fe salad with blackened salmon. This morning I felt light-headed and nauseous. It was so bad I had to leave work early and go home just so I could be close to a bathroom. My mom told me she felt the same way, and that her salmon tasted funny, like it had been sitting out for a while. I guess I learned to never order raw fish from any place other than a Japanese restaurant. I also learned never to eat at BJ's again."
Elisa Y.,"Rowland Heights, CA",77,71,8,3.0,8/3/2014,"After a 20 minute wait, we were seated. We started off with a waitress who asked what we wanted to drink and we placed our order. Then everything went down hill from there She had to go on her break so she brought a waiter who would be taking over. We placed our order of drinks and appetizers. It took him forever to bring our drinks. They actually came with our appetizers. When he brought the appetizers, we didn't even have any silverware so we asked him  to bring us some. He brought us some plates but they were dirty so we asked for some new ones. He forgot about it and we had to ask another waiter. By the time they brought us the silverware and the plates, we pretty much finished eating the appetizers with our fingers because it took forever.   The fried calamari wasn't as great because more than half was tentacles which I wasn't too pleased with.  We asked for refills on our drinks on several occasions and it took FOREVER as well.  We finally ordered our food. The food came, the server brought our pizza but they never brought us the pizza stand so he just placed it flat on the table, so I had to ask for the pizza stand. Isn't it common sense to bring a pizza stand before a pizza is brought out?  Once they brought the pizza stand we attempted to grab slices but the pizza wasn't even cut right. We were standing there cutting and tearing the pizza into pieces from the pan.  Our waiter came to check on us probably like once after that. On top of that when he finally brought us refills, he spilt some of the drink on my husband but failed to even acknowledge it or apologize it.  I've been to this bj's on many occasions but this was by far the worst service I've had EVER."
Victoria J.,"La Mirada, CA",3,5,,1.0,7/25/2015,"First off I would like to add that I usually have amazing customer service when dining at this establishment. (at other locations) The staff at this location are extremely rude. Staff were grouped up at the host stand and when I went up to update the hostess about my party's status, I felt as if I was a burden because I had to interrupt the staffs personal conversation.  great food but the staff members at this location don't know how to do their job and they lack good customer service.  I work customer service and I would be embarrassed to have people giving these horrific experiences to other guests and to think they're supposed be hosting and greeting you..."
Gary P.,"Brea, CA",1,22,1,2.0,6/4/2016,"This was a true disappointment on several levels. Firs, the restaurant has a ""put your name on the waiting list"" policy; same as call ahead seating.  When we put in our name before we left our home, it said there was a 15 minute wait.  Shortly thereafter I receive a text that there was actually a 30 minute wait.  When we arrived, the host said it would be another 15 minutes.  After 30 minutes I inquired about the holdup and apparently our name had been erased and then were immediately seated. Upon ordering, I added a wedge salad which the waiter said would be brought right away.  After 10 minutes I asked where my salad was and he went to get it.  Wedge it was not; it looked like lettuce sloppily thrown on a plate with dressing poured over it sparingly. While I was eating my dinner and salad, (dinner came a few minutes after the salad) the waiter asks if I wanted another beer.  I said yes and the waiter had to be remind again 10 minutes later where was my order. I t appears that the waiters/waitresses are spread too thin.  I don't understand why you need 4/5 people working take-out and another 4/5 hanging out at the host stand.  A lot of employees standing around doing nothing!"
Alana M.,"Henderson, NV",105,12,1,1.0,5/29/2016,"Horrible experience at Bjs . Waited forever for everything. Ordered the 2 for $25 deal. Which 2 ppl got 2 salads,a medium pizza and a pizzokie. Me and my mom got the same salad and hers looked so much smaller than mine which i felt bad. Then our pizza came way late. And i swear the size of the pizzokie shrank since we got that deal. The waitress hair was all messed up and un-professional. Wont go back to this bjs"
Victoria T.,"New York, NY",39,34,1,1.0,2/8/2017,"Came here on the weekday and the place that half empty. Yet it took 10 minutes just to get a table . Then waited another 45 minutes for the food. They brought charred Brussels sprouts, over cooked chicken, over cooked sirloin steak, and not fresh ahi tuna salad. I'm guessing the cooks at this place likes overcooked and charred food. Definitely not worth the time and money to step into this place unless you want to get an upset stomach or like eating burnt food."
Audrey C.,"Norwalk, CA",2,1,,5.0,12/1/2016,"So I've got to say that this location was probably one of the friendliest and most welcoming Bjs I've ever had the pleasure to dine in, than most I've ever visited. My server was Faiza ? Probably not spelling that right... Sorry girl! But she was very attentive right up until she started getting busy but I get it trust I used to server 10 years ago and I know how it goes lol thank god for her busser because Despite the fact that Faiza was busy it's nice to see other members of the restaurant like a busser helping out. I will like to add she was cleaning a table when I asked to help find our server to refill drinks and get some ranch... she didn't seemed bothered to help on the contrary she asked if there was anything she could help me with and did both herself. Food was great service was outstanding. I will definitely come back again! Good job guys"
Darla D.,"San Dimas, CA",166,885,685,4.0,4/24/2016,"I miss working in brea, I still come out here when I can. Bjs has always been a fav of mine. Good food and service always ..."
Jane L.,"Chino, CA",196,307,2328,4.0,9/29/2012,"BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse is a chain restaurant with pub fare and an extensive list of house brews. This location is across from the Brea Mall and close to Cheesecake Factory. I usually get the Blackened Chicken Pizza. The combination of cheese, alfredo sauce, and corn somehow blend well together. The texture of the pizza was soft and fluffy. I know it's not the real deal in terms of deep dish but it was pretty good. I've also had the BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich. This was a huge sandwich! The Pulled Pork was tender and had lots of flavor. The sauce was made up of smoky BBQ ranch sauce and BJ's Jeremiah Red Ale. The crispy onion rings in the sandwich were great. The crispy thin fries that came with the sandwich were pretty good. They were crispy and not overly salty. The coleslaw here was also good!   I also like getting BJ's Famous Pizookie. The cookie is fresh and hot and topped with two scoops of vanilla bean ice cream makes it perfect.  The service here usually has been great! The servers are very attentive. The seating arrangement is interesting They have U-shaped booths that face booths on the opposite side. Meaning that if I were to sit in a U-shaped booth, I'd be potentially staring at people dining in the booths on the other side. There are booths that can seat up to two people and others that can seat up to four. Pretty good food and great service. I'll be back for another visit!"
Kelly M.,"Fullerton, CA",114,69,601,1.0,6/17/2015,Snails pace has their pub runs here monthly. This place takes close to 30 minutes to get water..... Really.....the BJ's staff spent about 20 minutes speaking to each other and then sort of hid out not taking orders or serving drinks or food......where are the staff hiding . Why is customer service not a priority??? Ughhhhhhhh............
