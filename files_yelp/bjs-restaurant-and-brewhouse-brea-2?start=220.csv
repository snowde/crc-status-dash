Marta C.,"Placentia, CA",146,38,4,1.0,9/12/2016,"Ordered 3 BBQ chicken salads to go.  Pile of watery wilted lettuce, pool of water in bottom of bowl, a few hard to find black beans and corn kernels, no flavor and no crispy onion rings.  We threw them in the trash! Expensive mistake! Never again!"
Luckydumpling S.,"Newport Beach, CA",20,14,3,2.0,8/27/2015,"Well...I usually do not like coming to these chain family restaurants but it was where my 9 year old niece wanted to go for her birthday celebration so here we are.  Wait wasn't long since we called ahead & put our name in (it was lunch btw) for 5 adults 4kids.  Noisy but that's expected. The waitress was nice enough & took our order quickly. Unfortunately our food took FOREVER to come out! It would have been tolerable had it not been for the 4 kids ""dying"" of hunger breaking down with each passing minute. It took almost an hour to get our food which I find unacceptable. It wasn't like we had elaborate orders. We got the baby back ribs, pulled pork sandwich, seared ahi salad, Mahi Mahi tacos, sirloin steak, classic hamburger, chicken tenders & salmon quinoa bowl. After waiting an hour we only got half the orders & had to wait a good 5 min for the rest of the orders to come out. The sirloin that we ordered medium rare came out very well & my salmon was very overdone.  Despite my overdone salmon the salmon quinoa bowl had good flavor & was actually good.  Overall 3.5 stars for food 1.5 stars for service."
Alvin L.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",0,9,3,1.0,9/10/2016,"Came in for a late dinner and sat at the bar area. Took a while to get greeted by a server but after that the food came out quickly however our cups were left empty for some time. The reason for the low rating is that at the end of our meal the power inside the restaurant goes out and we were left sitting in the dark. Expected someone to come by and apologize and explain the situation, but not the manager or our server were seen. Everyone working there just whipped out their phones and began joking and looking outside. After at least twenty minutes of sitting in the dark with no water and waiting to leave our server comes by to drop off a written check. As a server I expect a certain standard when dining out and usually tip 25-30% but was so outraged by the lack of care and courtesy i paid and left. I could hear other tables around me getting extremely irritated that we were basically left in the dark and forced to stay until they felt it convenient. I will no longer frequent this restaurant. Whoever manages this location could really improve on customer service."
LC M.,"Burbank, CA",38,79,148,5.0,5/2/2015,Very nice atmosphere...great servers......thanks MARIE getting my late night otder to go!!!
Ivet C.,"Fullerton, CA",11,36,64,5.0,7/12/2014,"My girlfriend and I ALWAYS come here. Seriously, we've been as much as 3 times in one week which is excessive for a couple of chicks on a budget but it's hard to say no. I can't tell you how many points we've racked up and free pizookies we've managed to get. This is my favorite BJ's location and I wouldn't go to another one even if there was one closer. We always have the best experience here, waiters are awesome, the vibe is chill, and food is A+++++.  We love the beers, wings, avocado rolls, pizzas, and pizookies. The other menu items I've tried have been delicious as well! Also a great place to hang out and catch hockey games or the world cup!"
Richa A.,"Orange County, CA",383,157,311,5.0,1/26/2014,"Pretty much the only place I am 100% willing to spend $6 on a cookie and some ice cream. Truly believe pizookies are one of the best desserts on the planet. Whoever thought of the idea of a pizookie is an absolute genius. As far as this location, I have yet to be disappointed! The service is always great and I've never really had to wait long for a table at all. The patio area isn't that big, unlike some other BJs I go to, but it's fine if you don't have a giant party of 20. Normally after 10 p.m. They have happy hour on weekdays, so look out for that! Their mini deep dish pizzas are only $5 or $6 instead of the regular $10! (Along with a handful of other options.)"
Randall S.,"Anaheim, CA",0,18,,5.0,12/20/2016,"My friends and I came in on Monday night, and we seated ourselves in the bar area. I'm writing this review because Amber H gave us the best service I've experienced in years. Not only was she personable and funny, she knew every part of the menu page by page. She made great recommendations, told us about the Monday night deal (half off large pizza, what a bargain!) and was very attentive. It was truly a 5 star experience. Thanks again!"
Alba M.,"Norwalk, CA",293,246,,2.0,1/13/2015,"This is one of the more impressive looking Bj's that I have visited, so it's too bad that my experience there was one of the worst. I should have know it was going to be bad when, while I was waiting for my table, one of the hostess dropped a bulk of menus into my lap. Not sure if he had a case of banana hands or what, but that should have been a good indicator.  Just some of the highlights; ordered two appetizers - only one came out. The other one the waiter remembered once we were half-way done with our meal. We had to ask for everything - utensils (our food was out and still nothing), napkins, refills, we flagged a random waiter down to get cheese/pepper for the pizza. I just felt like the waiter flat-out did not care. The food wasn't even great to justify such terrible service. The pizza was very damp and greasy, especially in the middle. It looked like it needed 15 more mins in the oven. My salmon had a few bones in it, and my veggies were in this raw/steamed/cooked limbo (some were completely cooked, and some were completely raw).  ""Meh, I've experienced better"" completely fits this location."
Rho L.,"Chino Hills, CA",4015,1071,1568,3.0,1/2/2014,"For the past two years, we've had our christmas luncheons here. They generally reserve the outside patio area for the 30 of us.  Beyond that, I've also come here on my personal time, usually for a pizookie craving, or for when you can't decide exactly what to eat. BJ's menu is large enough that you'd find SOMETHING on their menu that would appeal to you.  Their deep dish pizzas are always carboliciously filling.  I do enjoy the pizzas and sometimes, when done right, their salads can be delicious.  Now about the remaining 12 pages of their menu...well....That's just the thing though, the menu is so huge that most to their items are just OK in terms of flavor.  Jack of all trades, master of none. On the positive note, nothing I've ever had here has been horrible either.  EIther way, I always manage to find my way back here so all is not lost yet, BJ's."
Heather J.,"Upland, CA",95,160,60,2.0,2/20/2016,What happened to the BJ's I used to love? Pizza was ok..thyme chicken was ok but the rice looked like soup. One of our entrees were rung in wrong 20 minutes later the right meal came after we were done eating. Should have been Taken off our check. Manager never came over. Service lacked. Waited an hour and a half for a poor meal. Has 2 birthdays at the table and we did get our desert. We heard singing At other tables but not ours.. Disappointing evening.
D-na P.,"Buena Park, CA",0,7,,5.0,5/15/2016,"Just had a wonderful dinning experience with our sever, Summer, and the manager, Eric. Our food came promptly and accurately. Summer would stop by to check in with us. I especially appreciate her stopping and giving us eye contact as she spoke."
Scott T.,"Corona, CA",133,155,31,4.0,5/14/2015,Had an awesome time! went there with my softball team to celebrate our winning streak. it took quite a while for them to seat us but that was to be expected since 20 of us showed up without a reservation. They were very prompt with everything and made sure we were well taken care of. Food was hot and beer was cold. That Monday night staff did an amazing job accommodating us on such short notice.
Ben H.,"Diamond Bar, CA",2,10,,2.0,4/27/2016,"Drinks were good, service is nice. But how dare you make steak like this, the cow God will smite you for making a steak this dry and overly chewy. Seriously bro who made this steak. You should be arrested for destroying something so beautiful."
Stephanie B.,"Murrieta, CA",28,132,24,3.0,6/7/2015,Well I definitely would replace the hostesses here. The red hair hostess is beyond rude and the others looked like deer in headlights. Our service was ok. Our waitress forgot our drinks a few times and the busboy neglected to bring us ketchup after we asked. The food did come out quick and was delicious though. It seems like customer service is a major issue here in Southern California.
Victor G.,"Whittier, CA",3,18,28,1.0,6/27/2015,"Family and I stopped by for dinner, HORRIBLE SPOILED CHEESE! Caused my 7 year old son to get a stomachache, My wife also had bad stomachache. We order two small pizzas that the cheese was bad. Server was really good but the food was bad.  The beer was good but I'm sorry they need to check the expiration date on their cheese. We do not recommend."
Kim T.,"Orange County, CA",1156,1046,2847,3.0,1/13/2014,"Southern Fried Chicken is really good, comfort food.  We also enjoy the Parmesan Crusted Chicken and Tuscan Chicken Limone pasta.  Pizookies are always good.  Pear cider is my go to drink.  Service is hit or miss though."
Movie G.,"Treasure Island, FL",7,70,108,4.0,11/14/2015,Kinda noisy but the mahi mahi and shrimp dish was delish. Nice and hot. Got a cool Pilsner glass as well.
Kari E.,"San Rafael, CA",13,405,20,2.0,5/2/2015,"Came here the other night with a group for a birthday party. Either the waitress had a bunch of tables inside as well as the patio (where we were), or there isn't really an excuse. Took quite some time to order drinks, and then even longer to come back and get our food orders. The food took a very long time to come out, but it was busy inside, so the kitchen was probably just backed up. However, leaving (by then it was no longer busy inside) was another story. We ended up spending about 30 minutes waiting for the check to be processed (we had it split on four cards and wrote how much to put on each card...it took an unreasonable amount of time...I was about to go in and check with someone when she finally came back out). There was also trash and a napkin on the ground under our table. There are just a lot of better places to go for dinner."
James N.,"La Habra, CA",65,16,1,3.0,2/20/2016,"The food was good, but today something I don't understand, We ordered 2 deserts, same Identical item. A cookie with a vanilla ice cream. We ordered 2 of them. One cost 2.50 and the other cost 3.50 . I asked them, why the difference in price? It's the same identical item! They said one is a kids price and one is adult price. I just think something is wrong, if it's the same item, it should be the same price. So you get three stars today."
Michelle M.,"La Mirada, CA",2,6,,1.0,8/19/2016,Just called to make a reservation and they could not take us because i didnt call 2 weeks in advance. Your restaurant is not that good to make people call 2 weeks in advance! We will go somewhere else.
