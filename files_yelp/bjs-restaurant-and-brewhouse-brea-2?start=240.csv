Jennifer S.,"Portland, OR",666,562,1974,5.0,2/20/2014,"Had lunch today around noon. When I walked in, my friends already had a table. Server was polite, entertaining, and friendly (and wish I got his name, because I would totally recommend him). Food and beverages were brought out in timely manner. Refills included. We ordered: mini pizza and salad, bacon cheeseburger, strawberry lemonade, and turkey sandwich and salad. Everything tasted great! Bill was approximately $30 for the three of us, which is really awesome. Overall, good experience and would visit this location again!"
Annie K.,"Chino Hills, CA",315,5,4,2.0,2/9/2016,"Not busy on a Tuesday night, which means their service  could have been a lot better for my party. Came in with a party of ~10 people for a birthday, and our server forgot to bring us water, spoons and other sides we asked for. Being a server myself, I know the proper qualifications are to be a waiter/waitress, and tonight, those standards were not met. We got checked up on about 3 times for our 3 hour stay. It's disappointing to even think that we got the service that we did because of the gratuity that's automatically included, or because our server just didn't care. Needless to say, their service could have been at least 1/2 as good as their food."
Jozie H.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,5,,1.0,6/4/2017,"I ordered take out today and was given a coupon on my email for a free appetizer if you spend a minimum of $9.95 food purchase. Our order was 2 kids meals which came out to $12.50, so we ordered avocado egg rolls for our free appetizer. We we got to the restaurant they did not want to honor our free appetizer because we did not get a entree of $9.95. The coupon, which is on their own website does not state an entree is required. It's just says a minimum of $9.95 food purchase. Which we did. The manger came out and proceeded to tell me he would not honor this coupon and I said yes you are it's not stated anywhere that we are required to purchase an entree. I asked the manager if he was going to fight this and he stormed off. Our food we guaranteed for 7:15 and it's now 7:45 and we have not gotten the changed back from our order and I already called once asking for our change. They finally came out after 10 minutes with the change. I am a rewards member and frequent this BJ's and am super sad at there behavior in this order"
Keith O.,"Placentia, CA",0,9,,1.0,8/13/2016,Five stars for the food but zero for their speed on take out. Waited over twenty minutes for my order after I placed the order on line!!!  To top it off they almost double charged me for the soup and salad combo just because we wanted the soup in a bread bowl. Manager straightened it out.
Brenda M.,"Placentia, CA",4,6,,2.0,4/27/2016,Ordered Takeaway. Scheduled for 12 PM. Got it 30 minutes later. Service is terrible. Lost our lunch time.
Roger J.,"Fullerton, CA",0,13,13,5.0,10/21/2016,Food was quick. Drinks were on point. Wait was minimal. Jessica was a good waitress. Oh yeah the bison burger and Lemon thyme chicken was really good too.
Liz M.,"Whittier, CA",1,12,,5.0,10/9/2015,"We came in the mid afternoon and were greeted by Diane R. #156 she was our server, she was absolutely Great!  we never needed anything because she always responded to everything immediately.  Always with a pleasant smile and grace.  Please take note management that you truly have someone special in your workforce."
Angela M.,"Fullerton, CA",1,4,,5.0,10/18/2016,"I had a great experience here! The service was great, lots of happy people. My waitress was Olivia and she was amazing. Such a cute girl! I had a lot of requests and she happily attended to my needs. I got a salad and pizza and was very satisfied. I am definitely a regular at  bjS! ASK FOR OLIVIA"
Joseph F.,"La Mirada, CA",148,32,23,3.0,5/24/2015,Only thing that is not cool is the long wait for our order. We arrived here at 12:18pm and are now just getting our food. Smh
Christina T.,"Garden Grove, CA",1,21,12,1.0,1/31/2015,"The hostesses are inaccurate and very clueless as to what is going on in their restaurant . I had called over the phone and they told me the wait would be about 30 minutes . When I got here , they told me an hr and I told them I called over the phone and they wouldn't let me make a reservation so they told me oh okay so it will be 40-50 minutes . My grandparents and I have been waiting for an hour and we have also noticed a lot of other people Coming in to confirm their wait time .  They will give you a false wait time and have you waiting and starving with a stupid look on their face ."
Nathanial L.,"Buena Park, CA",12,3,1,4.0,9/21/2015,"My boyfriend and I came on a Friday and the hostess said it would be a 45 minute wait so we decided to sit at the bar area and found a small table open with two seats and our server carla greeted us right away.. She was so nice and knowledgable about all of the drinks, she even knew the alcohol content of each beer, I was driving so I ended up getting the house honey blond which was low in the alch. But my boyfriend got belgium that carla recommended and he loved it. The pizza took about 40 minutes but we didn't mind cuz our server was so knowledgable about the area of brea and fun things to do for the rest of the night... The food at Bjs isn't that great but the staff and beer is amazing thanks so much carla!!!!!!!!!!!"
Craig L.,"La Mirada, CA",0,4,,3.0,9/3/2015,"We came with a crowd. Overall, things were okay. The food and service were good/typical/friendly. So..., three stars, even though I was less than thrilled when we left.  For me, red meat is important. When I order a steak, I ALWAYS have a discussion with the server about what RARE means. She said she understood, but obviously she and/or the cook didn't....  For the record, rare does not mean medium. Medium is burnt, just as rare would be ""raw"" to those who want medium. There were several other minor issues, including being served a beer other than what I ordered.  The manager came by for a chat (not at my request), and I answered his inquiry of how things were. When the bill came, I was surprised that not even one single penny was removed, including for the beer I didn't order.  I still tipped the waitress well, because that's how I am, but I won't patronize the restaurant again."
Amber R.,"Whittier, CA",54,54,12,4.0,2/29/2016,I frequent the species alive its clean and the service is always on point. My favorite is their chicken tortilla soup and the Very Berry cider and who can forget the pizookie of course. You have to be careful about coming during peak times there's been times where I've had to wait over an hour to an hour and a half to get a table
Andre N.,"San Francisco, CA",7,35,17,4.0,12/23/2015,"My food was excellent! Our server, Amber, was great and made awesome recommendations. I was pleased with my meal. But one thing that bothered us was the unexpected valet parking! We were about to leave, but we were lucky to find parking nearby. If my mom was more recovered from her recent surgery, it would've been less of an issue."
Stephany A.,"Anaheim, CA",30,21,18,1.0,3/3/2015,"By the way, I received this message from the Manager and BJ's and emailed them. Still no response from them for such a poor service at their restaurant!  #haventvisitedbjssince"
Michelle T.,"Long Beach, CA",5,34,2,1.0,4/10/2015,"Just ate here last night with a large group for a family birthday and it was an all around  bad experience I'm sorry to say.  I've been to BJs in Long Beach before, many times, and always had a good experience so I expected no different from the one in Brea, but instead was met with poor service and poor food quality/preparation. Our server was a meek young girl who was probably way too inexperienced for a larger party, and at times we couldn't figure out where she'd gone; she would disappear for long stretches of time and it took way too long to get our check at the end of the night. Can't speak for anyone else's food but the BBQ chicken salad I split with someone was wilted and seemed as though it had been dressed and left to sit for an hour (kinda soggy).  However, I could overlook the salad if I was able to end the meal with a delicious warm cookie topped with ice cream but NO, despite the past success of every other pizookie I had ever eaten at another BJs, this one tasted like it was baked hours ago and sat on the counter, then topped with ice cream sent out to the table.  Super disappointing.   I'd stay away from this BJs in the future."
Samantha G.,"Fullerton, CA",1,71,13,4.0,1/11/2015,"I love the pasta, pizza, steak,  and ribs here. I don't come here often, however I always love the service here when I do.  They have knowledgeable servers and friendly staff. They are all very well trained which makes for a delightful experience.  The food has never tasted poorly. Steak was cooked to my liking. Sides were tasty.  Pasta is also a favorite of mine here. The mushroom chicken marsala is a must try. Delicious and the sauce amazing. I love the pazzookies but who doesn't. I have had the cookies and cream, chocolate chip,  peanut butter,  and double chocolate. All amazingly doughy, warm, gooey, and delicious. I love the food, service,  and will continue to enjoy eating here. The pazzookies alone are enough reason to come here time and time again."
Soomi P.,"Irvine, CA",489,473,92,4.0,1/22/2015,"This BJ's location is amazing! We made reservations for a group of 10 for dinner. When we got there, we were seated immediately. I ordered the classic burger with mushrooms, which was absolutely delicious! The service here is pretty awesome too. We wanted to split the bill 4 ways and the server was happy to split it for us. Great food, great service!"
Coree T.,"Fullerton, CA",545,163,141,4.0,1/18/2015,I've had consistent bad experiences at previous BJ's but this location redeems themselves. The wait wasn't bad and the server actually checked up on us periodically. The food was too our  satisfaction and the pizookie was delicious! I recommend getting half Oreo and half white chocolate macadamia :)
Myra G.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",42,61,42,4.0,2/28/2015,So I've come here a few times... Drinks are pretty decent. I like the pomegranate margarita. Food is great if you like pizza and burgers. Everything else on the menu tastes    so- so. I ordered the Salmon. It was slightly over cooked and I did not get any asparagus with it which it's supposed to come with. Instead I had steamed broccoli and carrots which is great if you like them. I don't.  I'll still come here... And order pizza. Our server was attentive so that's a plus.
