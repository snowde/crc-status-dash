Nirali P.,"Bloomingdale, IL",0,3,1,5.0,7/16/2015,I know not everyone loves them but I do. No better way to end a day of relaxation and pampering than with a yummy deep dish Pizza.
John L.,"Fullerton, CA",182,4,1,5.0,2/19/2016,There is a park nearby here so after a workout i like to go here and enjoy their happy hour or lunch specials. I love their beers and their pizzas!
Grace D.,"Carson, CA",0,6,,1.0,6/17/2016,"Trying to get a reservation for party of 10 for lunch, when I called they said its fully booked. My reservation time was 11am!! AM!! I kept repeating that it was a lunch reservation right when they open. When I arrived earlier before 11am to get a table the whole restaurant was empty... Super dissapointed.. Very poor customer service!"
Jana P.,"Moss Beach, CA",44,65,33,5.0,7/31/2015,"Great burger! The double Brew House, with the house Cab. Yummmm.. it's kinda loud and busy here on Friday nite, but always a seat at the bar and tonight Angels vs Dodgers!"
Wesley W.,"Monterey Park, CA",1204,727,10,3.0,9/30/2014,"3.5 stars-Generally, I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants but BJ's is an exception.  The food is fresh and consistently tasty.  Lately, I've been a big fan of their unlimited soup and salad @$6.99.  Great deal for a light lunch.  Their clam chowder (not light) is creamy and thick with a good amount of clams.  Their tortilla soup is awesome with the tortilla strips brought out on the bowl and the soup poured on at your table.  The sandwiches and flatbreads are good as well.  A good choice for lunch in the Brea area."
Ellen M.,"Irvine, CA",182,104,33,2.0,11/29/2014,Food and beer is great but dang... Tanner was my waiter and was extremely pushy with paying and leaving. Can I finish eating first? Damn.
Princess P.,"Chino, CA",1,45,522,1.0,3/18/2015,My visit to this BJs for lunch today was probably one of the worst service experiences that I've ever had. The waitress that we got (Diane) needs some additional training.  The food that we ordered took for ever. She did not apologize for it being delivered late and in 5 minute interval for the four of us. We were never asked if anything else was needed. Water was scarce and the service component was completely missing.  I don't think that I will come back here again.  Thank you. The only saving grace were the free pizookies offered by the manager.
Nelson A.,"Los Alamitos, CA",65,130,84,4.0,9/2/2014,It was very busy however we were seated within 25 minutes and able to get service pretty quick !!!! Overall a good dinner and always have a great pizza and on the small bite menu the best seared ahi with a real hot wasabi with a kick which I love !!!!!!
Michael L.,"Santa Barbara, CA",478,11,20,1.0,8/19/2015,"Not my first time here, but certainly want to make it my last. It's not often I write a bad review on Yelp but deservingly so is BJ's in Brea. Service is awful and it wasn't to get service my first, second but even third time throughout the night. I came with a group but I might as well should of came by myself. By time I had my drink, everyone else was finished. By time I got my food, everyone was finished. By time I got my check, everyone was gone. Weird how I was one of the first ones there..."
Chae S.,"Chino Hills, CA",311,3,,1.0,3/26/2016,"Upon arrival, we were ignored for a good 5 minutes. Once they finally decided to seat my party, they gave us our drinks without straws because they ran out of them. They didn't give us silverware or napkins until we asked twice and the monkey bread I ordered, came out super super cold and hard. It was gross!!! All around, service was horrible and I will not be back."
Mark R.,"La Habra, CA",0,5,1,1.0,3/25/2015,"For years my family and  I have been enjoying the balsamic dressing at BJ's. However, today we found out that they've changed the recipe by no longer making it ""in house"". Instead, they ship it from corporate. What a shame, it's no longer worth ordering. I hope they drop this corporate approach and bring it back!"
Jennifer M.,"Vallejo, CA",2,35,2,1.0,8/1/2014,"Horrible service.  We were seated out on patio where only two other tables had customers, our friendly server approached us before we had a chance to look at menu, so he offered us a couple of waters while we figured out what we wanted.  He came back quickly and we told our server we were STARVING.   We said we'd put in our dinner order before even looking at drinks or appetizers.  That was the last time our server inquired about us.  We waited and waited.  All the tables filled up eventually, we are just sitting there.  Others order were taken.  Appetizers and cocktails are out.  Even customers who had our same server had delivered food while we are still sitting with now empty water glasses.   At one point, I tried to get the server's attention and got the ""just a minute"" signal while he helped other tables.  Finally, I just asked out loud if we could get some bread or anything to eat ?   So, after finishing with the other table, he walked by sharing BJ's doesn't offer bread but we could order some little bread things from menu.  We are hungry waiting a very LONG time for food we ordered before BJ's got busy.    Meanwhile, a woman finally brought out food, but not quite as ordered. (we had a detailed conversation with the waiter when ordering how we eat everything spicy). So our waiter notices the plate is missing horseradish, while walking by, saying he'll get some.  We ask for steak sauce, hot sauce, or anything spicy, This as a fast request, since it didn't arrive as ordered.  He continues to another table, takes an order.  On the way back, I ask for extra salad dressing.  He disappearing inside again.  (So we waited for him to walk by, waited while he took an order, and then caught him walking by again.  The food is already cooling down. We wait, wait, wait, wait the food gets cold.  Cold steak and potatoes, not happening. We have nothing to drink either, (on a warm August evening), so we are thirsty and hungry.   Sitting there, I now have a headache so I tell my husband I am just going to find our server inside.  I physically am feeling bad and put a credit card on his tray saying, please just bring us the check. oh and to go containers.  When I find him, our bottled steak sauce and hot sauce is on his tray with the other table's drink orders and the extra dressing I ordered. Essentially, we waited for him to go to take an order, go to a busy Friday night bar and order drinks, wait for the drinks, go to the kitchen, place an order, get our sides, rather than just provide bottled condiments so we can eat while our food is hot.  This after our order was somehow missed without so much as an explanation, refill on empty water glasses, let alone double check if we wanted cocktails ourselves, now that we've had a chance to  look at menu and ""think about it.""   So now that we see the tray, we are really pissed.  He delivers all the cocktails and sets our condiments down across the room.  I get the condiments myself, I go inside and pick up to go containers, while he is running the credit card.  He responds to this stating he wasn't sure  if we wanted the food because we looked unhappy.  Really, what about this situation made him think we weren't HUNGRY and THIRSTY. I explained yes, we are very unhappy.  We are unhappy with the service. We are thirsty and ravenous..  I point to empty water glasses and said we have been ignored this entire time, no one has checked on us.  CRAZY that he didn't get it when I was pleading for bread or anything please. Then it sinks in, he starts saying sorry, sorry, sorry. Excessively. Here's the thing...the people sitting behind us, who arrived much later than we did, who hear him saying sorry while I am saying look, we just want to leave get snarky with us.  They say it is too bad we have to behave like this.  Really, you are sipping on drinks and getting service...walk in our shoes for an hour.  Hey, ""sorry"" might have worked the first or second time there was an oversight.  But courtesy doesn't explain why we have nothing to drink and can't even get bottled condiments in less than 15 minutes, that wasn't nice for us.   The couple that walked in saying they were so hungry has to wait for everyone's cocktails, order taking, and kitchen interaction before receiving a bottle of steak sauce?  We were courteous by choosing not to skip out on the bill, no one around to notice us use the outside exit.  Now, please...let us pay for our cold bland food.  At least we have bottled water in our vehicle to ""jug a lug"" and quench our thirst.   We can drive, fix a cocktail, microwave the food, and season it quicker than waiting for a bottle of A-1 sauce in this joint."
Elizabeth C.,"Fullerton, CA",47,8,10,3.0,3/2/2016,The monkey bread pizookie was the reason we came tonight and it didn't disappoint. In fact it made the rest of our mediocre meal better. My hubby's Asian Chopped salad was meh and my fish and chips were not much better. But I will be back for the pizookie. It was delicious.
Sofia A.,"Anaheim, CA",49,104,177,4.0,12/11/2014,"I only come here when they have those $5 off coupons, the reason being that they don't provide any complimentary food items. And it also tends to be pretty noisy inside. I like they're buffalo chicken pizza the best. It reminds me of the Pizza Hut in Pakistan. The crust they have is especially good."
Kris B.,"Oceanside, CA",399,602,4414,4.0,9/5/2011,"When did the BJ's menu get so huge? Now it's like the Cheesecake Factory, a short novella of edibles.  We started with some items from the small bites menu - Artichoke Hearts $3.25 and Gourmet Mac n Cheese $3.95.  The Mac came out really soupy and when we pointed it out to our server Tyler, he immediately whisked it away and a new one appeared from the kitchen minutes later.  Now that's great customer service!!  The second Mac was delicious, thick and cheesy. Our BJ's Favorite pizza - size medium $20.25 was priced on the high side for what you get. It's not even deep dish! But we ate it happily and took the leftovers to enjoy later that night.  All in all, a good meal made better with great customer service!"
Hanz W.,"Yorba Linda, CA",201,231,81,2.0,12/26/2012,"Hit or miss but its your standard chain restaurant quality service.  Your server sometimes disappears for up to half an hour and no one checks up on your table even though plenty of other servers walk by your table, avoiding eye contact so they don't see you in need of something.  Maybe they should just add a bell service like ayce korean bbq places where you hit the bell and like all the servers know exactly which table requested service and other servers will cover each other if needed. Not a hidden em of explosive delicious food.  Standard watch-sports-while-chuggin-happyhourbeers/celebration meal/take-relatives-to-nice-dinner/shopped-at-the-mall-and-now-we're-starving/crave-giant-fresh-cookie-with-ice-cream-on-top/etc restaurant."
Palak S.,"Placentia, CA",80,4,,1.0,3/12/2017,"i went to bj just this weekend and what a horrible experience I had. I was attending a birthday of a friend of mine. while reaching bj parking lot I called my friend if they had already sat down inside the restaurant and she was like nope we are still outside. I asked her how long is the wait and she mentioned that it was 10 minutes (this was before I reached the parking lot). after meeting my friends in the entrance we were waiting for almost 20-30 minutes or more. finally we got our table, the waitress comes over and gives everyone the silverware except me(how do u not see a person)...after that she takes our order ....again she forgets me ( am I invisible or what)....luckily the person sitting next to me had to call the waitress and tell her to take my order. when we got our food ....my food was cold...I ordered deep dish pizza(no warmer to keep my pizza warm .......who the hell eats cold pizza?).........I don't think they even deserved 1 star.....its should be in negative ........"
Joanna D.,"Chino, CA",0,30,7,1.0,2/5/2016,"Don't waste your money on Take out.  BJ's is a rip off.  I ordered lunch for myself and spent $30.  When I picked up my food was sitting on the counter waiting.  They said it was ready they just needed to go get my lemonade and 2 scoops of ice cream.  I waited...and waited....it took them 8 minutes to return with the rest of my order.  Meanwhile my pasta was just sitting there cooling.  I ordered the fettuccini with chicken and broccoli. The pasta and sauce were cold and sticky.  The chicken pieces were so big I couldn't eat them, as my silverware packet has no knife.  I tried cutting them up using the plastic fork to no avail.  The garlic bread roll that came with it was tossed on top of the pasta and had soaked up all of the sauce which turned it into a soggy inedible mess.  I ordered a side of onion strings which were cold, oily and stuck together in one big pile of nastiness.  My raspberry sparkle lemonade was a rip off in size alone $3.25 for a child sized cup.  It had no ice and was a tart discussing mess.  In fact after sipping it on the way to my car I threw it away in the parking lot.  They even screwed up my ice cream.  I ordered and paid for 2 scoops and got one.  Never again.  I love BJ's when I go there, but the need to get rid of take out if this is the best they can do."
Julie Anne P.,"Artesia, CA",211,139,113,4.0,11/19/2015,"I LOVE BJS! You can never go wrong with this place, especially for dinner. They always have great selections on the menu and affordable. Some people might think it's pricy but it's good price for a restaurant type of food."
Gail S.,"Tucson, AZ",60,8,,5.0,3/8/2016,"This review has been a long time coming.  -  I'm a big fan of BJ's and I have been to several of their restaurants in CA; However, my absolute favorite is the one in Brea.  The food is consistently good.  My salmon is always prepared perfectly.  The staff is efficient.  I often wondered why this particular BJ's is so impressive.  One evening I got to know.  It's their management!  Leon Freemon stopped my table and seeing that I was alone, took the opportunity to find out what was going well and what could go better.  I had nothing to offer in the ""what could go better"" department, but I so appreciated that he genuinely wanted to know.  Seems he is always looking for ways to improve the experience.  I no longer live in Brea.  I live 45 miles away, but that doesn't keep me from visiting this particular BJ's.  I like this restaurant THAT much."
