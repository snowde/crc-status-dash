Brittany M.,"Westminster, CA",19,178,10,1.0,12/27/2014,"I went to this location recently because I had been in that area. My sister came down for Christmas and I hadn't seen her in a few months. She, I and her boyfriend decided to go out for dinner, and decided on BJs because it has always been a favorite. The place was packed, we waited about fifteen minutes for a table. No problem, it's the holidays, that's expected.  Sat, waited a while, finally got our drink order in. Waited and waited, drinks arrived at a snail's pace. Again, busy probably, excused because we were talking and not caring so much.  Finally got our orders in, a lot of the time we had to flag down our waitress or another one that passed by. All the staff was friendly and efficient, that wasn't the issue.  We ordered a pizookie before the meal. We were excited to try it, after one spoonful we found a hair in it! We told the waitress, manager came back with a pizookie. They just didn't charge for the hair one but charged for another one despite this disgusting mistake. Fine.  Next, our meals arrived. My sister's plate looked pathetic. The vegetables were all overcooked and the fish was like a balloon, overcooked as well. The plate looked like it came from a back refrigerator. She didn't send it back because it already took a lifetime to get and she was afraid the fish would then be undercooked instead so she ate it anyway.  The food was bad, the service wasn't on point. The whole place just wasn't inviting. I've noticed a lot of BJs locations going down the drain. I would not return."
David A.,"San Dimas, CA",144,1,1,1.0,9/16/2015,Horrible service. Waiter kept getting order wrong. Service was so slow someone from another table fell asleep! Manager could not handle anything. Worse customer service ever
Albert L.,"Pomona, CA",1295,573,1338,4.0,1/3/2011,"The only complaint I have about this restaurant is that parking is always limited during busy hours but I think that's just indicative of the area.  I've always had a good time here, SERVICE has ALWAYS been friendly, and I dig those famous pazookies, deep dish pizzas, and even the pastas they have. If I want to tempt fate I'll get the Berry Cider. ;) It's definitely not the largest BJ's I've been to (gotta watch that wording) but that kinda gives this particular one a cozier feeling than most."
Kacie H.,"Anaheim, CA",208,78,35,1.0,6/11/2015,"Terrible service!! First please never claim to be a great server when you're clearly not! We had a party of 11 to celebrate a friend's birthday. The server dropped unasked for waters...hello we are in a major drought!!!!!!! He started by ignoring a third of our party and the mistakes just kept on coming; food was forgotten, server was rude, food came out wrong, never got checked on after our food was dropped, never offered refills, and our bills were split into an absolute mess!! I normally enjoy dining at BJ's but I will be sticking to the long wait at Orange to avoid this location!!!"
Gina C.,"Whittier, CA",0,9,8,5.0,7/23/2016,"Nice location. On the drive there, I used the BJ's app to sign in for the preferred wait list. Meaning our table was ready once we arrived and checked in at the restaurant. Our server was awesome and attentive. Reminded us of the  daily specials and BJ's premier rewards specials. The food was delicious. We had the Meat Lovers Deep Dish Pizza. The atmosphere was comfy plenty of TV's. Baseball games and MLB Network. Definitely recommend for a nice meal be it lunch or dinner. Also open for brunch."
Susan L.,"Orange, CA",0,8,,4.0,2/22/2016,Recommend this restaurant.  The unlimited soup and salad lunch special is wonderful!  You can try each of their soups and salads (approx 4 different varieties of each).  I really enjoy the tomato bisque and broccoli cheese soups. The tomato cheese salad and wedge are my favorite.  My husband recommends staying away from the spaghetti and meatballs. The sauce is over spiced and not in a good way (strong on the vinegar).  The smell of the spices was overwhelming. We notified the manager so hopefully something will be done to correct it in the future.  Manager and staff are great.
Alex L.,"Diamond Bar, CA",87,5,,1.0,1/18/2015,Probably the worst service ever. Was never attentive and forgot everything. The only time our waitress actually smiled was when getting the check. Dont come here expecting any good service. Food is mediocre but the service really freaking blows.
Bob M.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,4,,1.0,3/25/2015,"Reserved the patio for a group of 50+.  They set up 4 tables of 10, with one person  taking orders for 50 people.  Our people were standing around  a half hour waiting to order drinks and get another table set up.  The patio was double booked with another group which stretched staffing too thin to provide timely service. I'm suggesting  our event organizer find another venue since we plan to do this again in April, May, June and July."
Vikram W.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,10,3,4.0,1/12/2015,Awesome beers and delicious food made our day and didn't forget the best service they gave.. Worth every penny that's spent..
Ereka M.,"Rialto, CA",1,9,24,5.0,2/15/2016,"The wait for little longer than expected, but the service was excellent!!  Our waitress Amber was very nice, but she was busy due to the size of the lunch crowd on the holiday, so Devin came along to save the day .  What an absolute pleasure it was having him wait on us!! He is so attentive, so professional, so helpful!!! Thanks Devin for excellent service!!!!!!  Oh, I should add food was also great"
Krystal M.,"Fullerton, CA",56,10,1,3.0,7/29/2016,The staff here is always friendly but the food is what I usually have a problem with. A couple months ago I ordered a steak (cooked medium) and they bring it out well done! This happened to me last night with my burger. Same thing. But I also have a huge problem with ordering a guacamole burger and having it cone out with three chunks of avocado on top. That isn't guacamole????? I don't know if its false advertisement or the cooks got lazy... I think I'll stay away from this place for a while
Aimee F.,"Buena Park, CA",187,2,,2.0,5/25/2015,"It was my graduation day and I came her to get dessert and and appetizers with my friends. We waited 20 min. for a table after I called and they told me there was NO wait. When we finally got seated we waited over 15 min for someone to come and take our drink orders and then another 15 minutes for them to take our actual order. We placed our order and waited for an hour to get our food and our servers excuse was that they were short staffed, but there were other servers just standing around. When I went to go speak to the manager about the service nothing was done about it and our food came out cold and the ice cream on our pizzookies were melted. The server did nothing for us and blamed the kitchen. This was the worse service I've ever received here."
Stacy H.,"Placentia, CA",1,12,,1.0,7/11/2016,"On Saturday night ( July 9th ) around 8:30 pm,  we went to BJ's to celebrate my son's 13th birthday.  The wait time was not long, about 20 minutes.  I don't remember the servers name but the first server we had was great.  We had 4 teenage boys with us and she was very patient with all of them.  She was great by coming over to refill their drinks but our food took a long time to get to us. After our food was delivered to us, we has another server come to say he was taking over for our original server.  It would of been nice if she would have introduced him to us.  Once he came over, our service went from good to very poor.  We asked for refills and for my son's birthday desserts.  It was awhile before we saw him again.  When we finally saw him, we asked were are refills were and he stated, he had forgotten.  When my son finally did receive his birthday dessert, he put it down, said Happy Birthday and just walked away.  We were never asked if the other people in our group wanted dessert or offered extra spoons so my son could share with his friends.  This is the second time we have celebrated my son's birthday here and both were horrible experiences.     This BJ's  is my mom's favorite place to eat for lunch.  Whenever we go for lunch the service and food have been great.   I have decided that this is not the place to eat dinner due to the poor service.  We have told my son we will not be celebrating any birthday dinners here due to the poor service."
Jolene U.,"Long Beach, CA",8,10,1,3.0,1/4/2016,"I've been to quite a few BJ's restaurants in my time, but I was not happy with this visit. The food was fine, but the service was terrible! Our waitress was very slow!"
Beth W.,"Pomona, CA",58,40,2,2.0,7/10/2014,"This BJ's sucks. All the time, everytime.  Customer service is ALWAYS horrible.  Hostess never made eye contact with me or my husband. She barked ""how many"" at me, and then took my name, then pointed and said ""over there."" The next girl that took us to our seats didn't have her shoes on all the way. I can't get over how gross and icky that is. Put your shoes on, get better ones... Something. Please don't make me look at your socks with holes... We came in at 9:15, ordered two Sierra mists and a salted Carmel pizookie. The only thing that didn't let us down was the pizookie and the last manager we talked to. Sierra mist was all carbonation, which I understand happens... Change the syrup, let it run, fill a glass, taste it (then.. If it's okay...), fill guests glass and return to the table. Do not let a carbonated/syrup mess go back to the guest. This is what happened to us. So we tell the waitress. With a scoff and eyeroll the waitress brought a new one... And they took 15 minutes to remove one Sierra Mist off the bill at the end. Their points program is deceiving- there's ""current"" points and ""lifetime"" points. Apparently somewhere along the line was a free pizookie that I never asked for/redeemed but had enough points for so they removed it from our ""current"" total.... So I was pretty peeved, waitress tells me how the program works, which I already understood. Her condescension was not what I needed in order to make the situation better.  The manager came over and heard about the dining event we had and removed the pizookie. So, we were out the door for $5.  I don't think we are going to let ourselves fall into this trap again. I have been here before with a similar experience. Next time we'll make the drive to chino hills, West Covina or Newport Beach, all those are lovely and worth our money."
Erica F.,"Anaheim, CA",110,21,3,1.0,7/22/2014,"I don't know how this place got so many stars because it is the worst service I have ever had. Every time I come here, I feel so annoyed by the service. First of all, we get in for the lunch special at 245. The girl asks us how many, takes our name, etc but then in the middle of that turns her back to us and then starts gossiping with another worker. UMM OK? Never turns around again to tell us to take a seat or anything.  So then we are sitting in an mostly empty restaurant surrounded by workers and about 15 minutes pass before we are even seated.  We are definitely ready to order by then but NO ONE stops by for another five. He then says he'll be back. Another five minutes go by and NOTHING.  So finally we just decide to order to go. Obviously no one is going to help us. We walk away (no one ever bothered to help is) and order to go. We have to talk to three different people before we find someone willing to take our order. The guy then doesn't even know what time the lunch special ends, and then when we tell him THREE PM, he asks us what time it is so he can ""make sure"" we don't order after it ends. Wtf. I told him that we had been waiting since 245. Then The guy doesn't give us everything we ordered so we have to wait for his incompetent self to go get the rest.  Of course no one in this place bothers to wear name tags. No responsibility or accountability. Never coming to this location again."
Mary S.,"La Habra Heights, CA",37,79,130,4.0,6/6/2015,"Great happy hour. Good wings, good spinach dip. Not a fan of deep dish pizza so I never get that. To get happy hour prices you have to be in the bar and that's loud and crowded. On the regular menu the BBQ chicken salad is my favorite loaded with lots of goodies like corn, black beans and jicama. I have also gotten the Hawaiian mahi mahi over brown pineapple rice which is my other favorite. I suppose if you like deep dish pizza this would be a good place to go for that too."
Jennifer G.,"San Diego, CA",0,47,17,1.0,7/3/2016,"My take-out order took over 40 minutes to receive when I was told it would only take 10 to 15 minutes. I get home and my order is wrong. I called to speak to a manager and she says she will be following up with an email to me and I received nothing. I sent a complaint email in and all I get back is ""sorry for the terrible service"" - zero acknowledgement of poor management follow through. I would definitely choose a different BJ's or even go to lazy dog in Bra -you'll get better service and better food. BJ's in Brea needs to clean up their customer service - for now, I would stay very at away."
Matt P.,"Anaheim, CA",3,12,,1.0,5/16/2015,"Absolutely horrible service from the hostess last night(red tinted hair). I called 1 hour before and they said the wait was going to be an hour, so I put my name in over the phone so that our table would be ready when we got there. Out of respect for the staff, Our party of 10 arrived on time. However we expected to sit at around the time you gave us. I went to check in and she tells me that we would have to wait one more hour. Not only did you not honor our reservation, but the hostess was so unbelievably unprofessional and rude. Being good friends of the founder of BJs, I know this is not the standards that he would allow in his restaurants.  Im a BJs regular (at least 3 times a week). Never returning to this location."
Mark S.,"Fullerton, CA",12,21,,5.0,7/19/2014,"Best pizza around. Good salmon dinners, very unique. I get the cherry Chipotle salmon and it's really tasty.  Cookie and I've cream deserts are very good too."
