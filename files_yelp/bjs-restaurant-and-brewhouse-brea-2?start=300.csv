Paul A.,"Anaheim, CA",394,1075,513,4.0,8/24/2012,"I was here last night and then my kids chose to come here tonight- tasty as always- last night I ordered the BJ's special and tonight a cheese pizza some kids items and a bowl of soup Kids dug on some of the special BJ's rootbeer- tasty this place is legit- probably my 30+ time at BJ's between Laguna Hills, Brea, Balboa, Irvine Market place- these places have amazing food and tasty beers at bargain prices. Happy hour here rocks!  Allthose nice things said... This place is too busy- not their fault what is their fault- shooting the bull with customers instead of taking my drink order when the converstaion has nothing to do with the customers order or needs... we had a three waitress rotation and it wasn't going that great till the last 1/4 and it kind of corrected. I could go on..."
Francine L.,"Los Angeles, CA",1577,1657,3140,3.0,7/4/2012,Came here after eating dinner and wanting to get some drinks and a little bit of dessert. This BJs is literally not inside the mall but really close to it. Getting a table was pretty fast.  Our server got our drink order and also the desert which of course we ordered the pizookie red velvet style. My first time getting it in that flavor. You could taste the white chocolate in it as well. Pretty good mix with the ice cream on top. Liked it ! The only thing I didn't like was our alcoholic drinks. We ordered mojito lights but they tasted soo sweet it wasn't as good as other places. I wasn't expecting it to be amazing but it was pretty terrible. I would suggest just ordering desserts and no drinks. Maybe a beer??
Atis S.,"Brea, CA",14,20,32,3.0,11/3/2015,"Called in to order BBQ chicken pizza for the takeout. The employee said the total was $20 something. (I'm fully aware it's pricey) When I picked up it turned out it's $28 in total so I said nothing and left but then it'd bother me if I stay quiet so I went back and told him off that he said it's $20 on the phone and he apologized so I'm okay with that. But when I got home, it turned out it's not the pizza I ordered. He even asked me twice to repeat an order for him.  Despite that, the pizza was great. But you can find better pizza at much cheaper price anywhere."
Dee M.,"Pomona, CA",11,152,109,5.0,9/16/2014,I came here really wanting to try the pizookie and i was not dissappointed! So good!! Try the chocolate chip one! It melts in your mouth!
Scott D.,"Fullerton, CA",3,16,,1.0,7/6/2016,Came for dinner and got seated right away on the patio and then set for a long time without being helped. I don't understand why you under staff so much. Now that we have ordered our meal has taken way too long. Our server has done the best she can just way under staffed. Please don't cheap on your labor.
Areli F.,"Anaheim, CA",174,8,3,5.0,10/21/2015,"After a long day, my boyfriend and I decided to have a late birthday dinner and our server Michael ,who likes sublime, was just amazing. That kindness he showed to us really helped turn the day around!"
Shachi R.,"Diamond Bar, CA",0,8,,3.0,5/6/2015,"I had ordered take out food from here, as our daughter had her newborn with us.  The avocado rolls that I had ordered were overly fried, and soggy with oil.  The avocado filling was brown and I did not appreciate this at all. I had ordered take out food previously from them, and the quality of the food was much better, so the 3 stars."
Matthew R.,"Valley Village, Los Angeles, CA",168,204,582,3.0,8/10/2012,"It seems like the summer lunch menu got bigger over the years. There are a lot more choices to choose and all at reasonable prices. I love the beer selections that they have and the food is decent. However, the service is always long. i have no idea why, it always take so long for a waiter/waitress to come and greet you.  My overall experience is A-OK."
Jennifer N.,"Fullerton, CA",418,45,14,5.0,10/11/2014,"Tonight I received such amazing service!  I cannot comprehend my happiness right now.  My friends and I ordered the pizookie party platter. We ordered half chocolate chip and cookies and creme and the salted caramel. When they brought us the pizookies out, they had bought out a whole chocolate chip pizookie party platter and cookies and creme and salted caramel on the side. I'M SO HAPPY THANK YOU FOR THE AMAZING SERVICE."
Erik J.,"Corona, CA",10,52,1,2.0,11/12/2014,"I've been to this location before and am familiar with the food and atmosphere. My friends and family went here for my birthday on 10/27. We had a larger party but were able to be seated almost immediately. However, after that, the service was much less stellar. My wife and I were there with our young son and some friends for my birthday dinner. When service is slow, it's magnified when you have a small child. In this case, service was sporadic at best. It took some time for even our drinks to come out (our son's milk included). Drink refills were also troublesome. My wife and I ordered a medium pizza to split between the three of us. When it came out, the crust was soggy and undercooked (even for a deep dish pizza). It had to be taken back to spend extra time in the oven. This caused my son to become more upset as we literally had to take the food away from him and he was hungry (as were my wife and I by that point). By the time dinner was served I was at wit's end between my son's temperament (dour, but almost understandable given how long we had been there overall by that point) and the service. We ended up leaving our friends as soon as we could get the check, which was lamentable since we were there to celebrate my birthday. As we left it didn't seem like there were many people waiting to be seated, so it was harder for me to ascertain how busy the place actually was (and therefor explain the slow service), since I was mostly focused on getting my son home at that point. Overall, the place is passable at best on most nights, but on busier nights the service can crawl. The venue has bad acoustics and it can get rather loud, especially if there are sporting events being turned up on the TVs throughout the venue. It definitely has more of a loud sports bar appeal than a family restaurant. It's a shame. I love their beer and menu, but I don't think it's enough to warrant another visit for a while at least."
Vi V.,"Orange County, CA",281,760,3358,3.0,8/21/2012,"I've been to this particular BJ's a couple of times already and everything is just okay. We came almost right when it opened so no wait for us. What we got: BJ's P.M. Porter ($3.50): so my BF was tempted to get this after seeing ""Dark Caramel and Chocolate""...I had a sip and bleh! He didn't like it either...but I mean if you like dark ale... Southern Fried Chicken ($6): yum! it was a fried chicken steak on top of mashed potatoes and surrounded by corn and roasted red peppers. I'm not a mashed potatoes kind of person, but I wanted the chicken steak...but the mashed potatoes were pretty good, it was creamy and smooth. The chicken wasn't try and it had a nice crunch to it. As for the corn, you can't really mess up corn... Enlightened Barbacoa Tacos ($6): comes with black beans as well. I had a bite of a taco and it was pretty good, but not something I or my BF would get again. The bean comes with a couple of tortilla chips and the BF said it was pretty good. Peanut Butter, Red Velvet, & White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Pizookie Trio ($9): my BF and I couldn't decide on one pizookie so why not get 3! Peanut butter was his and he really liked it and I took a bite of it and it was very peanut butter-y. Red velvet was mine and it was delicious! It had cream cheese bits in it. I've had a couple red velvet cookies before, but this is definitely one of the better tasting ones. The white chocolate macadamia nut was for both of us to share and by then I was stuffed. I had a bite, but there was nothing special about it. Definitely get the red velvet pizookie! Service: It has always been the same every time I come. It was just okay. They'd come by once in awhile and ask us if everything was good and if we needed anything else and yup."
Marcel W.,"Rowland Heights, CA",147,28,17,5.0,1/17/2014,"OK so this is not my first time coming to BJs but it is at this location. I think all BJ establishments are great! Great relaxing aura and  awesome food! And 95 percent of the time great customer service. I came in on a Friday around 5pm not busy at all! Sat right away. Decore was nice as always and clean. I got a very kind and attentive waiter! Refills came at a premium ! STRAWBERRY LEMONADE  makes my mouth water just by thinking of it! Food came out in less than 20 mins! We ordered a 9inch individual pizza 5 meats and the French roast beef sandwich. The pizza wasn't the best pizza I've ever had but it's good quality deep dish pizza that get the job done! The crust is super soft with a light crisp upon biting in. The French roast beef sandwich was a great choice the Au jus sauce makes the sandwich, so dip that baby!! And of course we ordered the chocolate chip pizookie! A warm baked cookie in a tiny pizza pan with vanilla bean ice cream mounted on top! The perfect combination! A must get!  Service was great! Food was delectable! And I will be coming back for sure!"
Fly I.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,,1.0,12/8/2015,"Went there around 4 PM on a weekday to discuss setting up a private party for 50 people. The reception guy said he was going to get the manager, and then I proceeded to wait 15 minutes with no one coming to assist.  When I inquired about where the manager was, the reception attendant said she was just very busy. I guess this place is doing too well and doesn't need my business.  Took the GM's business card so I can file a complaint, and let them know I will be taking my business elsewhere. Horrendous..."
H N.,"Placentia, CA",0,2,,5.0,7/10/2016,Thanks for being open late and taking our order over the phone!    After a  wonderful vacation in Maui and a long flight home it was nice to be greeted and treated so nicely on the phone and in person by Romero.
Mark Z.,"Fullerton, CA",0,14,9,4.0,6/15/2015,"Enormous menu and tasty beverages makes BJ's a lively location to enjoy good food and beverages. The interior has few sound absorbing surfaces, so expect a noisier than normal atmosphere. Lighting is good with extra directional track lights to make reading the menu a breeze. Wait staff are pleasant but not overly talkative. Relax and enjoy when your food is presented with a smile. Save room for a baked Pizookie topped with delicious vanilla bean ice cream. Yum!"
Thomas G.,"Long Beach, CA",0,26,,1.0,6/19/2016,"To be fair, I actually like the food at BJs. However, the service is fair at best, and the new brunch menu absolutely sucks. The normal menu has 865 pages of options (bit of an exageration), but the brunch option is so limited they do not even have french toast. If you are going to do brunch....do it right. From a price standpoint, I would rather go to a local spot."
Miriam P.,"Pomona, CA",20,8,,1.0,9/17/2015,"I must say... Horrible service! I went last night with a big party for a friends bday. And first off, the waiter literally came to our table once every 45 minutes... Then, he spilled water on my friend TWICE, (didn't even offer a napkin or anything). Then they tell us they can't split the bill when we all knew they could. We even talked to the manager and she acted like a coward saying it wasn't possible and it was ""too time consuming"" when that's not my problem as a guest there. So very very poor customer service and I was very dissatisfied. Won't be going back to that Bjs again."
A V.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",7,6,2,2.0,5/11/2015,"I visited this establishment tonight and was honestly very disappointed. I'll start with the good. Although clearly very stressed our waitress, Samantha, was really sweet and working really hard to make things right which is the only reason it got two stars. I ordered a glass of wine and it came out with what looked like crusted over sauce on the inside of the glass. They gave me a fresh glass. I ordered fettuccine chicken Alfredo and when it arrived it was barely Luke warm. I asked if they could hear it up. It came back mildly warmer and also half the size it originally was. The meal was also supposed to come with dinner bread which was missing. At the same time it took my friend at least 10 minutes just to get some ranch. It was a very disappointing experience especially since we were there celebrating my nephews birthday! I most likely will not be returning to this establishment."
Joyce M.,"Long Beach, CA",341,58,57,5.0,2/13/2013,"My All-Time Favorite Restaurant and Brewery! If you love beer and food, this is where to get stuffed! Very casual, the bar has wide screens for sports viewing, waiters and waitresses are very helpful. Become a Rewards Member, collect points and get free food! Get special treatment as well because you are a member! Oh, the best thing about BJ's is that they have gluten-free pizza crust! Yes! They even have gluten-free beer. Isn't that just wonderful for gluten-free customers? :)"
Emily N.,"Riverside, CA",246,115,13,4.0,4/20/2014,Came for Pizookie craving time!!! aka 11pm.  They gave us great service and knew exactly what we were there for and how to help us. Gave us no attitude for sharing one item and having many refills.  Of course we had to sit at a small table wedged in between two other couples (that probably were more bothered by my stories than i was of theirs).  Nothing beats chocolate chip pizookie's. I can't believe there are still people that do not know what they are... we must help them!
