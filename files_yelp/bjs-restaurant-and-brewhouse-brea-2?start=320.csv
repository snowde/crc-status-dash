Trevor J.,"Mesa, AZ",45,254,91,4.0,6/30/2014,"Love the atmosphere as I come here during an Angels game or other sporting event.  The pizza was superb and something I was craving at the time.  As with most restaurants, be nice and courteous to the waiter and they will pay attention to you.  Something I enjoyed is the BJ app and signing up, if you are going to come here more than once it doesn't cost anything and you can end up getting free food and order before you sit down.  Very efficient."
Britney S.,"Corona, CA",25,44,2,4.0,11/7/2014,"Food and Service was good! Tammy was great, outgoing and very attentive.  =)"
Violet G.,"Orange, CA",10,332,12,1.0,7/29/2014,"Average food, bad service.  We came here for dinner, and started off with fairly good service.  I will not name the server, but he was friendly and seemed on top of things at the beginning of our meal.  However, he appeared to be overwhelmed by a large table next to us, and forgot to put in out appetizer order.  We eventually received our appetizers, the avocado spring rolls and the stuffed mushrooms, which were both good.  We then had a long wait for our entrees, and when they arrived, they were incorrect; I had ordered a white pizza without tomatoes, and it arrived laden with tomatoes.  As our server did not check on us for quite some time, and they were dropped off by a runner, we didn't have any opportunity to request that they be fixed.  Other than the incorrect order, the food was fine.   We then had a long wait for the check; it was such a long wait that we decided not to order dessert.  When we received the check, we saw that our server had not put in the ""no tomatoes"" request on the pizza, so it was clearly not the fault of the kitchen staff.  Overall the food was nothing amazing, but it was decent.  The restaurant advertizes online ordering, so perhaps that is worth a try."
Cathy S.,"Newport Beach, CA",651,230,1788,5.0,12/28/2011,"Did you know that this where BJ's first started brewing their beer?  The laws changed in California where you cannot buy beer in a growler   unless it is brewed in the facility.  Hence, a drive to get our Grand Cru to enjoy on Christmas Day in a growler! We arrived at BJ's at 10:30 in the morning on Christmas eve.  And we just HAD to make sure the Grand Cru here was up to our standard so, we ordered a glass!   It is 5 pm somewhere in the world right?  wink, wink. It did not disappoint and we just HAD to order a BJ's favorite pizza, which did not disappoint again!   Whew, it is hard work to try various places and edible delights to educate our fellow Yelpers!  LOL   Service - 5 Stars - Emily was informative, patient and so sweet Food and beer  - 5 Stars Ambiance - 4 Stars - nice, but I prefer the Laguna Hills restaurant a little more."
Amy L.,"Los Angeles, CA",25,9,,5.0,8/20/2015,"Went to BJs for the first time when visiting my boyfriend - this place is awesome! Wait time to get seated was normal, noise level was not too crazy, and the table service was really fast once we sat down. Server Santiago was great, really professional, plus he made some great recommendations - the avocado egg rolls, which are addictive, then the burger and of course their speciality, the Pizookie, for dessert. Apart from the sweet name, its damn delicious - who doesn't love a (giant) warm chocolate chip cookie with melty ice cream. Winners all around!"
Karen G.,"Whittier, CA",5,13,1,3.0,11/29/2014,"Went to the Brea BJ's today at lunch time. Every time I have gone here, I get a quick, unfriendly greeting with an order to step to the side to wait.  We were seated pretty quickly, order pretty timely and the food appeared pretty timely, as well. I just ordered the egg roll appetizer.  It was very good and my mom ordered the clam chowder which she said was very good. Our waiter was very sweet and attentive enough, but when I put my debit card out to pay, never game by for it.  Another waitress came by and took it for us and then our waiter popped over and asked if everything was still OK...he looked at us kind of puzzled like, ""hello, why are you still here?""  We said yes but, hello, you never picked up our check.   Overall, I am never disappointed at BJ's.  Great menu and drink selection.  Decent service."
Chacon L.,"Riverside, CA",4,256,7,5.0,7/25/2015,"Wait was a bit longer than the quote time, but our server (forgot his name) was fantastic. Food was delicious and consistent with the BJ's brand. Will continue to visit locations."
Ian W.,"Pelham, NH",715,3717,5928,4.0,1/31/2010,"BJ's Brew House is one of my favorite late night places to go for happy hour, which offers discounted appetizers ($2 off), mini pizzas (half off), and drinks ($1 off drafts & cocktails). I can come to BJ's to relax and unwind and enjoy some pretty good pub food and drinks at a great price. On my way back to the SGV (my CA home), I always stop at this BJ's near the Brea Mall (conveniently located off the 57 Fwy) after spending a long day and evening solo at Disneyland running around to many rides and attractions. I do make it a point to consume minimal food and drink at the theme park since the prices there are very inflated. I come here very hungry and extremely exhausted from all of the excitement of seeing Mickey, Minnie, Goofy, Tigger and friends. I'm going directly from a fun place for kids (Disneyland) to a fun place for grown-ups (not Vegas, hehe). I usually seat myself at a high top table near the bar area with a good view of the flatscreen TVs, bartenders (*wink*), and for prompt service. On my last visit, I had a good pale ale & Diet Coke with a Mediterranean mini pizza and a big plate of Angus Beef Sliders & Fries. The food was up in 15 minutes. This is just what I needed! The Mediterranean deep dish pizza was good and very filling and greasy and had a soft firm crust topped with grilled chicken, basil pesto, roasted garlic, Kalamata olives, sun-dried tomatoes, feta cheese & sliced peperoncinis. In my book, the crust for this deep dish pizza takes a close second place to Pizzeria Uno's (Chicago Grill) deep dish pizza, which has a firmer and tastier crust. The pile of Angus beef sliders served on toasted mini buns were great tasting with my one beer, which came with golden brown shoestring fries and lettuce, tomato slices, and pickles. I was stuffed and took some of the food home. Overall, BJ's has been very dependable with solid good pub food and drinks. The service was prompt and I was given another refill on the Diet Coke without asking (brownie points). BJ's of Brea is definitely on my list of places for repeat visits."
K B.,"Brea, CA",9,16,8,5.0,9/16/2014,"The best beer around. I recommend the Jeremiah red or the Hef. Their menu is really big, so many options. I really enjoy the nachos or the avacado egg rolls. Service is usually great here. Sit in the bar on crowded nights you can usually find a seat right away! On the weekends it's a long wait for the resturant."
Kat S.,"Anaheim, CA",6,25,25,4.0,4/1/2015,"We went to this location yesterday (3/31) at 3pm for late lunch, early dinner. We were greeted at the desk asking if we were meeting a group..after I had said party of 3..she took us to our table and said our waiter would be right will us.  After 15 mins I noticed a waiter close that kept looking at our table and then looking around. ..he finally came to the table and asked if anyone had taken our order..we told him no we were still waiting. ..he apologized and promptly asked for our drinks and appetizers order...because we had been waiting we were ready with our whole order..he was great..offering suggestions and information on ingredients when asked... The drinks came quickly, but another wait for the appetizers...but when they arrived we were not disappointed. .we ordered the avocado egg rolls...the deep dish carnitas~ fries...and the stuffed mushrooms, this worked well for sharing. .my husband and I ordered the great white deep dish pizza..and our neighbor ordered the Malibu pork chop...of which we did have lots of leftovers for a few  doggie bags...we really want to thank our waiter James for turning our experience into a good one..."
Brittany T.,"La Habra, CA",68,188,259,3.0,6/11/2014,I'm not a fan of chain restaurants but overall I was pretty pleased with the food and service. The house IPA was very good and and the other house beers we had were also enjoyable.
Denny W.,"Fullerton, CA",0,14,,5.0,10/19/2015,"BJ's is one of my favorite places for happy hour! While it does get a little busy and loud, it is expected at a popular place like BJ's. I've been to this location at least fifteen times and 90% of the time service is amazing. There happy hour prices are great and you get decent size portions for the price. They also have good deals on their drinks and their brand brews are bomb for only $4! Try all the different foods and drinks on the menu! They have both an evening and late night happy hour. I would recommend this place to anyone who likes a good happy hour at a great price."
Kaylee T.,"Lakewood, CA",1,14,7,5.0,4/1/2014,"My husband and I frequent this location a lot bc it's close to work. We get the best service from David. He's always in a great mood and very helpful! My glass is always refilled without me having to ask, and he has great recommendations if we don't know what we want. World class service from him and the restaurant manager. It's very clean and the food is always amazing. Get dinner here tonight! You won't be sorry!"
Bigpapa M.,"Anaheim, CA",164,3,1,3.0,10/4/2015,We had ok service. Our waiter made a few mistakes but didn't really address them. Wanted to share our expierence.
Val S.,"Whittier, CA",4,10,2,1.0,7/18/2015,"Great food but the serve was awful! Alyssa H was our host. Only one person receive a refill, she didnt remove any of the dirty plates.We asked for waters and we just left after 10 minutes. It shouldn't be hard to get 2  waters. We only seen the host a total of 3 times. I think she went on lunch and just forgot about us. Awful service!"
Timothy E.,"Fullerton, CA",50,64,42,3.0,6/6/2014,Bjs is a hit or miss on most occasions. I love their bison burger and pizza but the past few times we have gone the food was extremely salty to the point where you can see actual rocks of salt over everything. Besides that Bjs is a go to if you are in the area. note: be prepared to wait 30-40 min on the weekend Note: I did call ahead for seating before leaving the house but they do not take call ahead seating / reservations. To the Manager: Please correct your previous statement because it is misleading for other customers Thank you
Ray H.,"Orange, CA",0,22,3,1.0,8/18/2015,"We ordered 2 pizzas. They forgot to include some of the ingredients on the first pizza and they forgot all about the 2nd pizza. The server asked us if we wanted the missing ingredients on the side...   When we reminded her about the second pizza, she ordered the wrong pizza. I have been coming here for years and have never had such a bad experience. The only reason these people are still in business is because they have such a prime location."
Natalie S.,"Reno, NV",75,38,19,5.0,2/3/2015,"Came in on a busy Tuesday night . I ate alone (I'm on business) and had Jacqueline as my waitress . Prompt and polite service . Delicious food . Only gripe was it was a bit loud , but that's inevitable with a busy restaurant. Can't ding the business for that."
Jesse F.,"Everett, WA",73,224,9,2.0,1/1/2014,Food here is the only thing that gives this two stars. Here's the reason I would give it one star: I usually like BJs...but the staff and management here are ridiculous. Bargaining with our softball team that they'll only seat us if we are done and out within the hour? Really? Isn't our money and a guaranteed 25 meals good enough for you? Are you going to keep turning away business all the time? Maybe you should rethink that strategy.
Hannah C.,"Whittier, CA",316,20,11,2.0,2/13/2016,"This is a PRE-review, before even having eaten here (at this location & been quite a LONG time since then), I just called to make a reservation (even if just for 3 people) for tomorrow considering it'll be Valentine's Day. I just like to be prepared and avoid long waits. The info on this Yelp even says it takes reservations so why would they decline? The lady on the phone asked me for what time and if my party was more than 10/ & how many. I said for 3 pm and that my party would be fewer than that, which I said for 3 people. I was told that she couldn't do that and it's best to just call in 30 minutes before arriving so my name can be put on the list -______- wtheck -_____- I haven't dined in yet and this accommodation is not possible on what I believe will be a busy day. I wanted to have hope in this place (despite A LOT of bad reviews that I've read on poor customer service). I guess we'll see."
