Erin F.,"Monterey Park, CA",2,16,340,3.0,8/2/2014,The service is good. We order the pasta which is really good. But the deep pizza is not as good as we thought. It is too salty. My friend and I drink two big grass of water still fell salty.
Christina D.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",328,431,157,4.0,1/7/2014,"The food here sucks, the beer is beer but they earn their stars in service. I've never come here with a party less than 12, yet the servers happily (or seemingly so) split the check into individual ones. For that, bravo BJ's of Brea Mall."
Caroline B.,"Fullerton, CA",59,17,,4.0,8/2/2015,"They have good pizza, which they are known for and they really can't disappoint on any of their menu items.   They're cooking is consistent which is one of the reasons they are so good.    All around great atmosphere, food and plenty of seating.  Can't go wrong here!"
Katie A.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",87,34,9,5.0,2/8/2015,"Came here for lunch with a group of coworkers the other day. Our server was very attentive, fast, and efficient, which I really appreciate being on a time limit. I don't know her name, but she was tall with light brown long hair. If only raises existed in the restaurant business, because she deserves one! Thank you for a good lunch."
Mona B.,"Whittier, CA",178,9,7,1.0,6/5/2015,Worst service ever ! Our food was brought  out 35 to 40 mins later.  People that got there after US were eating before us. And when they finally brought out the food they forgot our salads & soup.  Anyways.  I'm not a happy customer & it's horrible cause we love it there.  Not going back that's for sure.
Lisa F.,"Yorba Linda, CA",326,145,47,4.0,4/17/2014,"The Pizza is delicious,& the tortilla soup is yummy!   There are a few things Ive tried on the menu other than pizza, some were good and some were mehh.   Pizza is obviously the way to go. They could work on the service a bit.  Not very consistent and sometimes they take a LONG time to come back to refill drinks.  Hello?? I am thirsty!"
Richard L.,"Diamond Bar, CA",127,18,6,3.0,6/17/2015,"I love BJs food. For over 5 years Ive never had a bad experience at BJs, but in the past 2 months Ive been to BJs 3 times in 3 different locations and they've all been bad! No idea what happened....and I even went to my tried and true one here in Brea. The quality has dropped to what I would expect at Denny's rather than the better BJs that I expect. Pizookies are still darn good though."
Hope G.,"Downey, CA",1,3,3,1.0,2/18/2015,"Went into this with a positive mind although I've heard from friends that this is the worst location of servers. Alicia served us in the cocktail area and even though there were three other tables occupied, our server failed to give us a pleasant experience. We had to ask for ketchup and parmesan and pepper shakers which is usually set at the table after ordering at other locations. Our plates came out wrong even when she asked us to repeat our order and I witnessed her 'write' it down.  When presenting her with her check and a very good tip, she grabbed the presenter and walked away, no thank you was sent our way. I never take to yelp to give negative reviews, but I was blown away by how unsatisfied I felt tonight."
Jeanette O.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,13,10,5.0,2/6/2015,Made last minute reservations for this location and the manager.. I believe his name is Oscar was very courteous and accomodating Thanks Oscar! You made my birthday dinner possible..can't wait for next week
Jonathan R.,"Fullerton, CA",3,22,,4.0,4/30/2016,"I have visited this location plenty of times. I have come for Father's day, family member's birthday's and regular dinner. I've had a good experience with the staff. I am a big fan of their pizza. Also the pizookies (sp) are good! I've never really had a problem with service. I will continue to frequent this restaurant."
Javier H.,"Garden Grove, CA",16,4,5,5.0,7/10/2014,"Always love coming here. I'm always greeted and given awesome customer service. The parking lot is massive, even though there is a mall and cheesecake factory next door, you can always find parking. I've never been recommended anything I didn't like here. It's like they know my tastes! I really love the flatbread pizzas and the crispy jalapeno burger is BOMB! Don't just take my word on it.. You need to try it! Do it! Do it now! Go! Why are you still reading!?"
Jonathan C.,"Diamond Bar, CA",30,105,36,5.0,12/3/2013,"I love BJ's  It has a great atmosphere and the food doesn't disappoint me.  I have a hard time counting calories here because everything is yummy.  You can order a personal 4 slice pizza which can feed a moderately hungry person, mediums can feed 2 people etc etc.  Pazookies are also great!  Service is good. They will card you if you order alcohol, and the beers are also great!   I come here ordering pepperoni jalapeno pizza with a blonde light beer.  It hits the spot with friends.  I've tried some of the appetizers and I've seen some people with entrees outside of pizza but I usually stay with the pizza here.  Hope you guys enjoy!"
C R.,"Whittier, CA",0,3,,1.0,9/17/2015,Wish I could give 1/2 a star. Took forever to be served. Came with a large party. We had been to other BJ's who have allowed large parties to have separate checks with no problem but this one gave the excuse of it was too time consuming for them. Whatever happened to the customer is always first? Horrible customer service and the manager is a coward. Did not want to deal with it.  Positive side: Food is always delicious.
Robert V.,"Whittier, CA",17,11,8,1.0,7/5/2015,Here at 4:15pm on a Sunday and they can't seat 7 people inside or out. Not sure how that works when they are 1/2 empty.  Didn't offer to sit us at 2 tables next to each other.  Business must be good to let 7 adults walk out.
Jill C.,"Fullerton, CA",0,10,,3.0,1/23/2016,"I used to eat at BJs a lot. The last few times I've been there I've been disappointed with the quality of the food.  It seems like the menu and food quality have declined and it feels more like a typical average chain restaurant.  The best thing on their menu is the Pizzookie, which is delicious."
Walt K.,"Riverside, CA",2,4,,1.0,9/27/2015,The WORST service!! Forgot part of the order. Waiter was condescending and forgot what he went for. I will never come back to this place.
John D.,"Anaheim, CA",9,41,17,4.0,6/17/2015,The pizza was great. The beers were cold and over all it was good. The reason I gave 4 stars is because it took over 35 minutes of waiting and we were told 15 minutes maxim. Good pizza!
Karen T.,"Whittier, CA",1,9,10,2.0,7/21/2015,"Came here for a quick bite and it took forever to wait for the food... Waiter was polite but we only saw him when he brought us food and took our order, it was like we weren't even there! Overalls food was pretty good, but I give it 2 stars because of the services!"
Lily L.,"Bellevue, WA",296,388,405,4.0,9/21/2013,"For pizza, the restaurant isn't bad at all. It's not gourmet pizza and I would say a very different level from let's say, Tribunali, but for something casual and of course, American, it's good enough. It does it's job, which is to fill the stomach, and feed a table of customers.  My main reason to come is for the pizookie. The concept is very easy and widely known, but for a pizza joint, it's much more interesting. A pizza sized cookie amounting to at most four cookie flavors is cooked in a deep-dish pizza pan and then topped off with two to three scoops of ice cream. Sugar rush, anyone?  Good for large groups for any type of event. Beers on tap are a variety since they are also a brewery and cocktails are actually quite good too."
Sherry C.,"Whitestone, Queens, NY",101,193,719,4.0,2/17/2014,Came here for lunch with a friend. We ordered a vegetarian pizza and a white chocolate macadamia pizookie.  The pizookie was great!  The vegetarian pizza wasn't bad.  I liked this location than the Montebello location. I give it a 4 star since I didn't really get to enjoy my food (had to leave early unfortunately!).
