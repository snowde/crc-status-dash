Armin K.,"Irvine, CA",91,9,8,1.0,7/18/2014,"Bad service, bland food and dry steak. I wasn't pleased at all. My boyfriend and I had a long day doing errands and just wanted some nice dinner and pizookie so we decided to come here but it all ended up with okay dinner and NO pizookie! I was really disappointed. I ordered the Hawaiian mahi-mahi, I complained about my food being bland and in the menu it says that it comes with soy ginger sauce but there was no sign of it at all in my plate so the waiter said ""oh! They must've not put enough so I'll just get you more sauce."" I told him that it didn't even taste any soy ginger sauce in the first place. OMG! The rice that comes with it was too mushy. It wasn't good at all. He asked if I wanted anything else but I told him I'm okay, I don't wanna wait another 20 mins  plus my bf is done eating his dry steak. We didn't make a complain for that coz he was hungry. We wanted some pizookie but our waiter took forever! He keeps passing by. I can see he was getting kinda busy but our table was in the middle and he couldn't even stop for like 3 seconds. So we just didn't order any. I was really sad and disappointed.  The beer I got was good tho and our pizza appetizer. (Hefeweizen and Bjs favorite pizza) Not coming back in this location."
S K.,"Brea, CA",0,9,,1.0,5/10/2016,"Every time I go here, I think the service will be better but it never is. Terrible service, mediocre food. The only dish worth going for is the pazookies."
Tyler Q.,"Fullerton, CA",24,105,,1.0,3/20/2015,"Stopped in here because they are open later than 10pm and we were hungry. The drinks were good but the food sucks here. I had a pizza that was delivered to my table and was nothing more than dough, cheese and toppings. There was literally no sauce on this pizza at all. We're talking bone dry! The pizza was nothing more than dressed up breadsticks. The skinny fries that came with the burger are awful as well. The food here is nothing more than overly salty bar food. Not good at all. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else for much better pizza. You won't find it here."
Vina O.,"Downers Grove, IL",473,679,22,3.0,1/29/2014,I order the same thing every time I go here: the avocado egg rolls and an oreo pizookie.  Everything else is mediocre.
Connie M.,"Glendale, CA",78,310,114,3.0,2/5/2012,"So the boyfriend and i were starving...and he suggested going to BJ's although we were originally in rowland heights, i suggested going to the brea location because we had to return something at the brea mall.  So we went there...and man was it pretty good!! :) Just like any BJ's it was nice because of the lunch specials...the boyfriend and i both ordered the tropical iced tea...SUPER GREAT...especially if you like the that type of iced tea...(unsweetened!)  I also ordered the never ending soup and salad combo for i think $8? the boyfriend ordered some weird chicken over rice dish...his was good he said? i didn't try any! All in all my food was great...i had clam chowder first...it was super heavy and some caesar salad...then my next order was a house salad with light italian (horrible choice of salad dressing) and then i ordered a tiny cup of minestrone soup.  The boyfriend ate all his food..and the only thing i have to complain about was they messed up my order...in the sense that the guy charged me for a dinner plate not the lunch special which was quickly rectified so it wasn't that big of an issue.  So, it's a great place to eat lunch!"
Debra W.,"Orange County, CA",66,7,1,5.0,6/22/2015,"My family and I decided to go BJ's on Fathers Day. It was the first time at this location and oh my it is gorgeous inside! We love the brunch menu and the California scramble is amazing! Not to mention our server Michael was very kind and he has a great sense of humor. He informed us that the bloody Mary's and the mirmosas were 4$ each! WHAT!! Cant beat a deal like that! Overall great service, great food and my husband and dad got a free Father's Day glass!. I will be returning to this Location. Thanks"
Erin A.,"Walnut, CA",258,5,,3.0,4/12/2014,"Bjs is one of my favorite restaurants and has pretty good food as well but when i went to order to go sometime last week i was disappointed by the way our server took the order at togo.Her name was marissa g. and the whole time she took our order she had an attitude.I work at a restaurant and i always try to be very nice to other servers because i understand what its like to deal with people.Either she wasnt having a very good day or she didnt want to serve us,either way at least pretend. Also word of advice if you are gona talk bad about customers try to make it less obvious or save it for later when they aren't there. Im sure other locations aren't all the same though."
Kevin L.,"Fullerton, CA",383,154,7,4.0,9/25/2013,"Personally if Im in the same plaza, I'd rather go eat at Cheesecake, but if I'm really in the mood for some wings and pizza, I'll come to BJ's. The appetizer of Wings is good enough to share as well as eat by yourself if you're looking for a smaller bite. If you're looking for pizza, I'd recommend doing a Half-Half so you can taste two of your favorites. Of course, BBQ Chicken is one, and you can experiment with something else. And if you didn't know, you gotta try your pazookie. A great finish to a good meal. Deep dish pizza + Pazookie = YES I approve. -Goodfood.LA"
Nidia N.,"La Habra, CA",2,52,52,1.0,2/5/2015,"Had dinner here on Saturday evening on Aug 2. Our server was Robert. Very bad server. Gave us dirty menus that were sticky w juice & the pages sticking together. He walked by a few times but didn't pick up our empty plates but did remember to drop off the check and still leave our plates on the table.  We paid, tipped, & left.  I called about 20 minutes later because my friend forgot his hat. The hostess checked and said she had the hat there. i told her i would pick it up in the morning. Upon arriving to the restaurant the hostesses that day seemed so lost & confused. I felt like i was speaking w teenage girls giggling and twirling their hair. They didnt have the hat. They kept asking me ""what was the host's name from that night? and i look at their shirts & i reply, ""none of you have name  tags how am i supposed to know anyones name?  i asked to speak to the Manager. Nancy was her name. Very poor customer service. Made me wait about 10 minutes before she stepped out of the back. Didnt have a manager persona, maybe got the title by putting in her years. Definitely needs training if she is to hold this title.  i spoke to her about the incident. How an employee told me it was physically there and now its missing. I told her a hat doesnt just walk away on its own. Suggesting if its stolen it must be an internal issue. She replied ""Maybe a customer took it while we had it up here on the counter"" & i said ""or maybe it was an employee"" thats where she couldnt control herself. And replied ""our employees do not steal"" (i really liked how she said that without being sure. not everyone follows the policy.) then she said ""we keep our lost & found for 2 weeks, but we are not responsible if it goes missing"" ... Ive been in retail for years, this Manager Nancy either needs a LOT of training or a demotion. This postion should go to someone who knws how to handle this situation better. What i didnt appreciate is how she was quick to accuse a BJ's customer of stealing this brand new hat but how an employee would ""NEVER"" do such a thing.   And of course she goes on to say how she will speak to the manager on duty saturday and how she would give me a call. YUP NEVER HAPPENED.  i will not be returning to this Brea location; bad service, bad management, & sticky fingers."
Chris S.,"Yorba Linda, CA",0,67,,2.0,10/16/2016,"Use to go to BJ's all the time and for whatever the reason we quit going. Hadn't been in over a year. Took 6  15-16 year olds and my wife to celebrate a birthday. From our first contact I recalled why we had quit coming. A host walked us to the patio and said your waiter will be with you shortly, turned and left. And no he did NOT seat   we sat ourselves. the waitress tried but she was far from being capable of handling 8 guests. Appetizers and my salad came after our meals, The dip for the appetizers arrived after that. The appetizer (variety plate) was terrible. Maybe suffice at chukee cheese! I only asked my wife what she thought of her meal, she had flat bread pizza. It was greasy and tasteless. My lemon thyme chicken was bland w/o any flavor. The only thing with any flavor was the pizooki ice ream. This was not a cheap evening and surely expected more than what we had. Well my memory was refreshed."
Alex T.,"Fullerton, CA",16,21,10,2.0,4/4/2014,Let me start off by saying that I like this restaurant chain. And not many do I enjoy so when I moved to Orange County I was excited to see that there was a BJs right down the street. The first time i came here it was a weekend and it was super busy so I was understanding with the terrible service I had. Throughout the past two years I have continued having dinner here and the service continues to go down hill. Honestly if it weren't for my friends wanting to eat here I would never come back. The food is pretty good and the desserts are pretty on point but the service is fucking terrible.  The hosts are the only nice people and other than that every other server I've had has treated me like shit and moves so slowly.  I would suggest retraining the staff because they mostly consist of idiots.
Zina C.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",85,39,38,1.0,10/11/2014,"By far the worst BJs I've been too. After work a few of my colleagues and I decided to grab a drink or two. And I decided to order a pazookie. It took 33 minutes for my order to come out. When I checked with the bar tender (who I placed the order with) to ask why it's taking so long and he said ""that's what you get when you order from the bar"". You don't tell your customers that. Obviously this BJs treats their customers differently. Also, the waitress that was suppose to serve us never came by. She never showed her face until she decided to give us our check hours later. Never going to come to this BJs again."
Andrea K.,"Diamond Bar, CA",9,15,2,1.0,4/26/2015,"This was an experience from years ago when we went to try out the 2 for $20. We ordered a vegetarian pizza, and when we received it, it had meat on it! Not what a vegetarian wanted to see. We told our waitress and she took it back and made a new one. When we got the new one, it looked old and gross, but after having to wait an additional 20 minutes, we ate it, and we shouldn't have. It was not good. We also ordered a root beer, and when we asked for a refill, they said they had ran out! How do you run out of root beer? The waitress and manager had no sympathy for their mistake, and didn't even bother to comp any of our food. Needless to say, I will not be coming back to this BJ's."
Rachel H.,"Anaheim, CA",67,42,8,3.0,3/10/2014,Went to lunch with my friend she ordered a salad and they brought the wrong one with the right dressing so my friend asked if she could get the salad she ordered. They brought the right salad with the wrong dressing. She also brought me another drink when I didn't ask for it. She was awkward and didn't seem to know the menu very well.  The avocado egg rolls were not very good kinda mushy like the avocados were old . Just overall not a very good experience.
Ashley L.,"Wilmington, Los Angeles, CA",55,131,11,3.0,10/29/2013,"It was a great experience. I got mozzarella sticks which I absolutely love. I also got the California burger which was delightful. Our waiter was excellent, we we're sat immediately and waited on quickly. I enjoyed my waiter, he seemed very knowledgeable which is a plus."
Lorie S.,"Tustin, CA",0,9,,5.0,6/16/2015,"Friday after my daughter's graduation in Pomona a group of 7 of us decided BJ's in Brea for our celebration dinner and was not disappointed. OMG!! The food was amazing and such a variety as always. I had the Jambalaya and the chowder bowl, The waiter asked if I wanted a certain spice level.  I was impressed. I have been to a few BJ's Laguna Hills, Orange, Cerritos, etc... Never was I given a choice of spice level. The service for our table was quick, efficient and superb.  We tried a variety of foods and beers. The sampler appetizer feeds 10 people at least.  Overall the restaurant was a perfect end to our great day. We will be back!!"
mike j.,"Yorba Linda, CA",0,18,,1.0,6/14/2015,"I have held off in writing this review, hoping that BJs would contact me regarding the many issues we had with our lunch.  But since they have NOT, I will now write my review, and unfortunately, it's not positive! On Mother's Day, 2015, we took a group of ten to the BJs in Brea.  We had reservations and were seated immediately.    We were off to a good start, but things went down hill quickly!!   Several of us ordered appetizer salads, which were brought out fairly quick.  Four of us ordered Fish and Chips, a couple burger orders, a pizza, and a few other items. While we were still eating our salads.. a server brought out ONE Fish and Chips and sat it down in front one of the moms who ordered it.   She hadn't even finished her salad, so she continued to finish her salad while waiting for everyone else's food to be delivered.   Her Fish and Chips just sat...  I figured, that the rest of the food was coming for all of us.  BUT NO...    a few minutes went buy, and no food for anyone else.  After over 5 minutes, I got up and looked for the floor manager and told her that one person in our party had her food, and no one else.   Finally, after another five minutes, the rest of the orders began to trickle out.  TEN MINUTES AFTER the first Fish and Chips were delivered to the table!!   By the time she started eating her fish...  IT WAS COLD!!!   Finally, everything was deliver EXCEPT THE PIZZA!!  After all this time, everyone was finally eating except the two that order PIZZA.    The PIZZA was finally delivered after waiting over 5 minutes more.   The manager brought it out and apologized for it coming out late, and said it would be taken off the bill.   LATE????   Everyone else was ALMOST FINISHED with their meals!! On top of everything else, several of the HOT food items were actually WARM to COLD!!!   The total for the table was upwards of $200.   I guess the real bothersome issue is...   I sent an EMAIL through BJs website, and received ABSOLUTELY NO RESPONSE....  not even an apology for the poor service and poor quality food!!  Obviously they were NOT prepared for Mother's Day and the impact of the crowd.  SORRY, not my problem!!!   We paid good money and received POOR service and POOR food quality.   And then, not even a response from BJs Home Office!  Why do they bother to place a comments section on their website, if they don't plan on responding??   Used to be a good place to eat, not so much anymore... especially on ""special days"" like Mothers Day."
Enrique A.,"Whittier, CA",0,3,,1.0,6/12/2014,"Came to celebrate my daughter's graduation, and will not be a returning customer. Made a reservation, got there, and was told it didn't exist. I was told I'd get next table as a VIP guest, otherwise a 30 minute wait. 30 minutes later, I ask what was up. They said I stepped to the side so they thought I wasn't interested. I stood next to reception area, almost in front of her. I guess I should've stood in everyone's way. She tells me that it'll be another while. I told her it was a terrible to lose my reservation, then make use wait twice. They said they were very sorry. Then somehow they found a table 10 minutes later that they said they were setting up.  Told the front desk manager that it was unacceptable to treat customers this way. She said she was sorry but there was nothing she could do.  Table had only 3 settings for a group of 8. Waiter was ok, refilled our water. A PR manager came to discuss what happened and said his employees were shook up. I told him they should also worry about how their customers feel.  Food came in 50 minutes. Understandably it was busy. But table next to us with a larger group and that say after we did, for their grub first.  For our trouble, we got two free ice teas. No discount.  I've enjoyed BJ's in the past but will never return, nor will anyone else, if I can help it. Plenty of other fine eateries that care about their customers and will do something more than lip service when they goof up."
Matt C.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",143,57,86,3.0,2/22/2011,"BJ's is a great place to have a nice handcrafted, wonderful beer. The service is decent if you sit at the bar (not the bar area tables, but the proper bar) but if you sit at an actual table be prepared to wait a long time in between refills. The menu is a little too extensive for my liking, too many choices; it's like reading a book when you first sit down. After trying a few things there, I now know what to order without bothering to look at the menu. For lunch the all you can eat soup and salad is fantastic as is the ham and cheese melt with the tomato bisque. Dinner you can't really go wrong with the homemade meatloaf or the fish and chips.  Mostly I go there for the beer, and if it was just based upon that, they would have received five stars from me. The other great thing about this particular BJ's is they have special events a lot here. Scotch tasting for example, where for a small fee you get to sample about six different scotches and sometimes get a complimentary glass from the event, they also do this for different beers that they brew there throughout the year.  The bottom line is BJ's is a nice place to hang out after a long day at work with some good friends and some great beer. Enjoy."
Maritza N.,"Woodinville, WA",50,12,17,3.0,2/20/2014,"You can never go wrong with BJ's because their menu has just about everything! So it's great for everyone! I [overall] love this location because MOST of the servers I've encountered are really nice! And what a lot of people don't know is that they deliver! The reason I'm giving them 3 stars instead of 5 is because I was served raw hamburger meat once, I've been delivered cold food twice, my delivered food has smelled like cigarette smoke (I'm guessing that the delivery driver smoked while he was driving), and one time my server made a fuss that I asked her to bring me a new Shirley Temple because mine had too much syrup in it.  Now most of those are bad experiences with delivery and not dining in the restaurant but I do think that they should work on improving their delivery service especially something like serving raw meat.  But again overall I do love dining at BJ's and can always count on the Grilled Chicken Alfredo!"
