Stacey C.,"Brea, CA",0,3,,5.0,11/11/2014,"Went to BJs for the Grand Cru!!! Alicia and Albert took great care of our needy group, the best service ever! Great job BJs on the outstanding happy hour!"
Marie T.,"Pomona, CA",4,3,,5.0,2/14/2016,"Brendan, and Yadira were the sweetest, most attentive wait ataff we've ever had! Moses is a beast in the kitchen and food not only looks good, but every bite is deliciously sinful. Leon you and ur staff really gave us a wonderful dining experience,  we can't wait to come back to this location!"
Monica D.,"Orange County, CA",750,678,46,4.0,2/6/2013,"Four awesome stars for Jen (our server at the bar), Laurel (our server outside on the patio), Toby & co. for hosting an incredible Beer Appreciation Night, and BJ's new Spicy Meatball hand-tossed pizza. Throw in a fresh white mac pizookie for good measure. -1 star: BJ's beer tastings, while few and far between, have been known to have the on-time percentage of your average wedding. But this time? Not only were some offerings forced to be scratched off the tasting list for reasons unknown, but it just took foreeeeever. Something that started at 7:30 and ended at past 10:30 on a Tuesday night about 40 miles from my house does not equal a good time. Also... the bathroom could use a little more constant maintenance. Also... some of the servers toward the end of the night, especially standing by the bathrooms, should not be standing around talking shit or whatever about whoever. I just browsed through some other reviews of this joint -- what is up with all that unprofessionalism? It's Brea, for God's sake -- not Spring Break Tijuana. Also... caveat emptor: their new ""happy hour"" appetizers mostly aren't worth it. Angus beef sliders + fries = totally worth $5, but $4 for five tiny chicken nuggets with some sauce? Not again, thanks. Bottom line: I love the Belgian Winter Warmers theme; BAP was definitely worth it even with the slight price increase. Jen and Laurel are prime examples of the potential kindness and awesomeness that emanate from a BJs. Plus, I was totally blown away by the Spicy Meatball and their new pizza crust (not a fan of their deep dish). And, once again, a pizookie for good measure. Four solid stars!"
Rachel C.,"Yorba Linda, CA",0,13,,5.0,4/22/2015,My husband and I aren't big drinkers but have always wanted to try different beers and ales and BJ's was the perfect place to try this. We ordered their sampler and were able to taste 4 different kinds on tap: super! We enjoyed the ahi poke and we almost lost our minds while devouring every bite of our salted caramel pazookie. Amazing!
Brandy R.,"Brea, CA",377,143,504,4.0,3/28/2013,"I love BJ's in Brea, they have the best French Dip sandwich (they call it the 'Original Roast Beef Dip Sandwich') that I've ever had and I can't get enough of the broccoli cheddar soup. I don't know what it is, but the bartenders and servers are extraordinarily friendly & cool at this BJ's. I'd say that Brea beats the first BJ's that I ate at in Eugene, OR. although I do miss Eugene, tons!"
Laura A.,"Fullerton, CA",0,11,2,5.0,4/10/2015,"We are 3 time a week (atleast) and love the food. Our favorite server is Corriene. She is so on it and has such a fun, engaging personality. We really like Manager Leon, most professional!"
Snowman S.,"Bend, OR",0,55,,2.0,11/17/2013,"I had the mahi fish.  Luke warm, and dry, and overcooked, and part of it I had to cut with a knife.  Salad with ranch.  the dressing was so thin, I thought it was milk.  it was originally Magnolia Peach.  the decor was impressive, but it was horribly loud for dinner.  service was good.  will  never go back because of the poor food."
Z S.,"Portland, OR",3,50,,1.0,12/18/2012,"I have always been the one to persuade my group of friends to go here when we go out for a late evening dinner. Here is why I will not be doing that any more...The hostess. I'm sorry to call her out like that, but having worked in the food service industry she was most likely the biggest waste of an employee. Harsh but true. We walk in. Stand right in front of her booth. She continues to look down at her desk. One of my friends pipes up and says ""HELLO?"" She ignores him and starts whispering and joking with another server. Now all of us have at some point worked in hospitality so being hot headed one of my friends just decides to seat himself because we were not even being acknowledged. Food was the usual. Server wasn't bad. No complaints really. Then we decide to leave. My friend has cooled down by this point but shouts a very loud and audible ""BYE!"" as we are leaving to the hostess. No reply. What does a hostess do again? I get better service at Denny's."
Imran K.,"Walnut, CA",3711,725,48,4.0,11/8/2012,"This time parking was super easy, under a shady tree. No people in line on entrance at 12am. Got seated right away . Friendly service and great food. Got nachos as starters and they were awesome. Had their salad for lunch was lacking in dressing. Used the salsa from the nachos as dressing. Had the Arnold Palmer as a  drink  this was tasteless. However the table was awesome a large booth. Enjoyed the company and came out full."
Matt D.,"Yorba Linda, CA",53,28,2,1.0,11/10/2013,"Made reservations. Arrived at the specified time and we were told it be another 40 minutes. Last time we came they lost our reservation and the same thing happened. I've been to a few other BJ's and have never had any issues like this miserable one seems to have every time. No one is mean or rude, just incompetent.  Enjoy BJ's, just not here."
Kimba V.,"Orange County, CA",30,69,13,1.0,8/6/2014,We are currently still waiting for the waiter to check up on us so we can get the bill.  The hostess seated us at a closed section and we have been neglected the entire time.  It took us 20 min just to get menus and water.  They forgot our silverware and we had to had to ask multiple waiters to retrieve them.  I've always been a fan of BJ'S but this location has the worst service by far.  I feel so lonely.  Someone talk to us please.
Froy M.,"Placentia, CA",3,5,,2.0,3/28/2015,"To be honest I love this restaurant, but last night was ridiculous. My friends and I had to flag down our server after the host sat us down which was annoying. Even after the fact that our food took forever to get to the table, one of the dishes was cancelled because it didn't even show up to us for some reason, and along with the poor customer service that Garrett M. gave us came a wrong dessert item. I'm not saying it is a bad restaurant or anything I'm just saying the customer service can be improved.."
Paul C.,"Garden Grove, CA",9,56,,4.0,12/11/2013,"Good food, nice relaxing atmosphere, and nice service.   Nice options on the menu, and the best desserts (pizooki)."
Wes R.,"Brea, CA",0,3,,2.0,3/21/2015,The food here sucks! This place used to be good. Not anymore!  The food seems really old and not fresh at all. I can't believe they would let this place get so low.
Michael C.,"Anaheim, CA",361,33,472,4.0,10/23/2013,A little too pricy for the quality of food for happy hour but still overall good food.  The wings will always be my favorites with the ice cream pizookies.
Saul Z.,"Norwalk, CA",5,3,3,1.0,1/11/2015,"I am a huge BJ's fan, I go to their Beer and Wine Tasting events and my friends always give me gift cards for my birthday. I always have an amazing experience at my local spots Downey and Cerritos, however today I went to the Brea location and it was a disaster. I took my parents for their first time and I was disappointed with the service and the quality of food. The waitress took too long to greet us, by the time she came to ask us for our drinks we had our appetizer and course meals selected. When we got our appetizers our Avocado Rolls weren't freshly made. They were REHEATED, the shell was soggy and not crispy and the avocado was brown! My parents don't like to create a scene so I didn't bother calling the manager. They also seemed understaffed because our waitress seemed flustered and was always on a rush to leave. I didn't want to make my family's night worse by getting negative attention, but as a loyal customer I don't want to experience this again! I took a pic of the disgusting avocado roll and posting it. What's the corporate email? I'm still upset about my experience"
Nancy T.,"Orange County, CA",405,1218,301,4.0,11/22/2010,"I've been coming to this BJ's for years and years and years! It's consistently about the same every time. The service is always just okay and the atmosphere is very loud. I love the great white, sweet pig, and BJ's favorite pizzas - those are probably the best three and most popular ones. The BBQ chicken one is also popular, but it's too sweet for my taste and I think the one at CPK is better.  Their appetizers are all pretty good! I love their potato skins, spinach and artichoke dip, and avocado egg rolls. Unfortunately, they have this new ahi poke that I tried and it was totally gross! Basically just pieces of tuna and chips with nori on them. Uhhh, the name of the dish is actually poke, so I had to ask the waiter where the poke was...and then they had the nerve to bring out soy sauce for me! I was quite indignant by their false advertising!  Nonetheless, I still love this place. The pizzas are always a comfort for me because they're so thick and yummy. I like their sandwiches and salads too. And of course, I LOVE their pizookie! The cookies 'n cream and brownie ones are my favorites! This place is reasonably priced, but if you go for happy hour...it's super cheap! :) Check it out! Just don't get the ahi poke!"
Mark A.,"Los Angeles, CA",374,435,670,4.0,1/7/2009,"The Food? Who can get tired of the place of the Pizookie? Damn good! 1 is usually enough to feed a group of 4 or more since they want nibbles of cookie and ice cream. Unless your a pig and want a Pizookie all to yourself. The pizza are great, BBQ Chicken, The Great White and the Buffalo Chicken have become favorites here. Any sandwiches that have the words Parmesan and sourdough usually are kick-ass. I had their Burger-Melt on Sunday, geez that was a heart attack waiting to happen, but oh was so worth it, lol! Spinach and artichoke dip w/ chips is a regularly ordered appetizer for my group. The Scenery? Right in Brea, CA where lot's of attractive people reside and roam around. Brea Mall, right next to Cheesecake Factory... Tons of white girls, lol! ~Heaven~ *sigh* ^_^ Full? Walk off your belly at the Mall... Still hungry? Go across Imperial Hwy and devour the Hat's Chili fries. Beer? Yes, they have a selection of BJ's beers. I recommend to try the sampler to determine the beer that's best for your taste buds."
Jackie W.,"Anaheim, CA",213,51,126,3.0,3/2/2011,"A-OK experience! Good location though, since its within walking distance from the Brea Mall, additionally plenty of parking options.  BJs is known for their excellent deep dish pizzas and their well-known handcrafted beers. During this visit, one of their featured beers was a peach flavored beer, which was very tasty. Ordered BJs Favorites (the works - craving sausage) Pizza and Chicken Cesar Salad, which the pizza might have needed slightly more marinara, but otherwise great service. So FULL after the meal therefore, might try their Pizookie Cookies next time, another BJs favorite!"
Isabel H.,"Brea, CA",161,1,,2.0,8/23/2016,"I try to be very understanding when I go to restaurants, since i myself work in the industry and know how stressful things can be at times. But I have to say, the service at this BJ's is absolutely horrible. Every time I come in to eat here, the service is slow and food takes forever to come out. I became obsessed with their pizzaookies and would sometimes order them to go, but i stopped doing this since they take FOREVER to make simple mini pizzaookie. Last time i waited 45 for two mini pizzaookies on a slow Tuesday night! The guy who took my order kept apologizing and was really nice. Despite the fact that he messed up on my order twice, i still tipped him only, because I understand how difficult customers can be. but waiting 45 minutes for a freaking pizzaookie is ridiculous. Not to mention the fact that when you call ahead to order they put you on hold for the longest time. The food is good, but they need faster service. This honestly just makes me not want to come back."
