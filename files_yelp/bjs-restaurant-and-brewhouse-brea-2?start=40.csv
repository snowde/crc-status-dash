Sharon C.,"Fullerton, CA",17,23,5,5.0,7/31/2017,I love BJ's Pizza. The lunch special during the week is reasonable. It comes with an individual sized pizza with one topping and soup or salad. I always get the sausage pizza & Caesar salad. I also like there peach iced tea which is unsweetened.  Join there rewards club and you can accumulate points for free food. I also get lots of emails with discounts. Almost forgot about the Pizookie which is a baked deep dish cookie with ice cream. I like the Carmel one the best.
Cabree C.,"Culver City, CA",1,13,1,5.0,6/28/2017,"Phenomenal customer service. Thank you, Megan O and Manager Santiago.  Long story short :Came into BJs had a bite to eat(FOOD WAS DELICIOUS) SERVER WAS GREAT TOO (PHAEZAH M) took out my retainers left them on the table. Retainer got thrown away. Called BJs in a Panic spoke to Megan O (VERY GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS, SHE NEEDS A RAISE)she calmed me  down and exhausted all of her resources. Manager Santiago DUGGED through the trash  to get my retainers.  (PRINCE IN ALL BLACK) I will like to thank guys from the bottom of my heart!  Xoxo"
Douglas H.,"Long Beach, CA",2,16,1,1.0,11/12/2017,"Our group sat in the bar table area and ordered our food. I ordered a pepperoni pizza and ice tea. It did not seem complicated but the pizza was dry as a bone. Sat under heat lamps apparently and the ice tea was never refilled once. I had water so I could wash it down at least. The place was so busy, I doubt it matters much what you say about your experience."
Gilbert A.,"Fullerton, CA",39,58,40,5.0,5/31/2017,"Today we spent our daughters 15th bday party here at BJ and omg, I totally recommend this place for parties... we had the pleasure to have Adam take care of us and the service he provided was the BEST we've ever experienced, THANK YOU ADAM for the GREAT service, you made my daughters day memorable"
Dale A.,"Brea, CA",2,13,20,1.0,2/23/2017,"My friend and I came on the account of coupons we received from Clipper Coupon Magazine,  we came with the intention of using the free appetizer with purchase of 2 meals and 2 beverages. I mentioned the coupon to the waiter. He said no problem... we ordered our appetizer and meal. When the manager came and said, they would not honor the coupon. We had received our salads and the appetizer. I mentioned we came because of the coupon and had  informed our waiter before ordering.  The manager said, we will not honor the coupon. I said well then we will cancel our order. He said very well. Turned and walked away. We were polite never attempted to argue thelo point.  He was curt and had a very I don't care attitude.  We both live in Brea and eat out often, we both had not come to BJ's in years.  We arrived at 130pm and I commented on how slow it was.  BJ's has a lot of competition in Brea, I am sure they may have decent food, the prices seem a few dollars higher than a Red Robin or Chile's... THIS EXPERIENCE HAS SOURED US TO NEVER COME OR RECOMMEND THIS BJ's... Management could use some retraining.  BOO FOR BREA'S BJ'S"
Maria F.,"La Habra, CA",224,3,1,5.0,10/15/2017,"I love this BJ's location I come here very often with my friends for birthday dinners or just late night pazooki's. They have great customer service and amazing food in my opinion, I have never had a problem with a server or the food."
Raveen S.,"Fullerton, CA",138,2,2,4.0,1/22/2017,"This was my first time here! Everything was neat and tidy with exceptional service. I tried out a chicken dish (that's how I determine how good a restaurant is) it was delicious, crispy and tender! Although one item the dish had ruined the overall taste, which I removed it from my dish.  Overall a good experience!"
Jason E.,"Chino, CA",46,27,3,4.0,9/15/2017,"We like this BJ's because service is typically good, fast and friendly and it's usually not as busy as other locations we've visited. I like their wings and lunch specials (which BTW you can get on weekends too) and my wife loves the Santa Fe Salad as well as the California Chicken Club. I've had complaints at times in some of the other locations but everything here has been consistent. Oh and Pizookies. Yes."
Joyce F.,"Fullerton, CA",6,2,,4.0,10/12/2017,"I am happy to recommend BJs restaurant. Lunch or dinner has never disappointed us. We go with family or friends and we leave BJs satisfied with our meal, the service and the prices. The waiters are friendly and glad to be of help if you'd like a suggestion.  The menu is huge so you will definitely find something to your liking. We always like to start off with the avocado egg rolls...so delicious! BJs is a comfortable restaurant, often crowded but usually doesn't take very long to be seated.  I call it casual dining, a little upscale and the Brea mall is in the same parking lot. So do your shopping and stop in for a meal and definitely get the egg rolls."
April L.,"Santa Ana, CA",166,76,582,2.0,8/20/2016,"Pizza and beer that's how, we do it! Right Babe...for some reason I'm always full and I can't get my pizookie!!! So disappointed on my self... Thanks again for a good lunch baby..."
Y A.,"Buena Park, CA",0,22,18,4.0,1/5/2017,"Yum yum and yum  I love how bjs do the buy one get one free thing often. It gives me the opportunity to eat the rib eye steak which is amazing.  A little less salt wouldnt hurt but i loved the meal. It comes with two sides so if you and your partner want a good deal get the steak ($23.95), a good 14 oz steak. And choice of two sides! (I got the tomato bisque soup and caesar salad)"
Sam M.,"Santa Ana, CA",12,30,5,5.0,9/21/2017,"I love going to the Bjs in Brea! I always get great service and enjoy the company. This is for the siblings that work there: Korley , Phaezah, and Saleh. They are a great team and they are very nice. They always take care of us and talk to us when they can. I think if you want great service and a conversation, sit with them. Thanks Bjs Brea for hiring them!"
heather o.,"Brea, CA",3,29,1,5.0,8/27/2017,"Thong behind the bar is awesome!!  Super attentive. He will ask if you need something before you think you need it. I did a pain in the butt order, he laughed and took it in stride.  Thanks Thong!!!"
Christian M.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,7,14,3.0,6/30/2017,Came out on a Friday night and called in advance to be placed on the wait list. When we arrived we checked in but still waited about 20 Mins to be seated which wasn't bad. Our service from that point on wasn't the greatest. Once the food was ordered we waited about 25 mins for he food to come out. The food was tasty which we enjoyed. After we were done we waited for service to pay but that took another 30 mins to complete. I understand Friday's service is busy but let's manage all the guest to keep a good experience going.
Sam P.,"Placentia, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/19/2017,"I have been going to this restaurant for years with my family, but I doubt I'll be back. First, they informed us that we might not hear them call for our table if we sat at the bar to which I asked if they had a buzzer or a texting system. They told me it only worked 50% of the time. Whatever. I gave them my number and it worked fine. Unfortunately, the hostess tried to sit us 20 minutes later at a dirty table with food smears not only on the table but on the floor as well. Whatever. That's not her fault. My mother asked if we could just sit at one of the other clean tables, but she told us to wait back up front so they could clean it. Fine. My parents were pretty annoyed at this point. I was still fine, but I've worked customer service. I know stuff happens. I get it. The final straw came when we waited up front and were ignored while our table was cleaned, the hostess clearly wanting to wash her hands of us. Two other groups were then sat before us, one of which got our table. We put our almost finished beers aside and left. I would have been sad that I didn't get to finish my beer, because usually their beer is really good but it tasted watered down.  We went to Red Robin instead. Red Robin gets 5 stars."
Andrea M.,"Placentia, CA",93,203,89,5.0,9/11/2016,"This is one of my favorite restaurants to dine at. Like others probably said, there's usually a wait and the service isn't always fast. This place is mostly busy, even in the bar area. I've been here countless times and have never had a bad meal or drink which is why I keep returning. If you're unsure about what to order, their pizza is always perfect.  You definitely don't leave this place without dessert. The pazookie is an all around favorite and there are numerous flavors to choose from. I opt for the tradition chocolate chip but you really can't go wrong either way."
Wei Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",183,23,17,3.0,9/10/2016,"Service is great! The food is not up to par. Food: I ordered the crispy calamari for appetizer. It came fairly quickly with two sauce and a good amount of calamari. Tar tar and tomato sauce. The calamari is okay, a lot of legs and not so much the body.  Deep dish pizza for entree. The spicy chicken Hawaiian disappointed me. Even though they upgraded the pizza from small to a medium, the pizza was just not so good because it was very doughy.  Food wasn't that great, but a good place to hangout"
Johnny M.,"La Habra, CA",333,332,152,4.0,7/21/2016,"Pizookie, beer and decent food. That is exactly how I would describe BJ's to someone who has never been. The atmosphere seems to always be good, a little loud sometimes, but nothing that is unbearable. Recently came to celebrate a friends birthday, luckily the host of the dinner was smart enough to make a reservation way in advance, as the restaurant was packed and there were a groups of people outside waiting to get in. My go-to and seems like a lot of peoples go-to here is the pizza. If you like deep dish pizza then you will be fine here as the pizza is alright. Not too shabby by my books, and I love me some pizza. If you do not like deep dish then you might have some problems. I once had the none deep dish pizza and the crust tasted horrible, not my kind of thing. My fave pizza here is he BBQ chicken. Chicken, Cheese, BBQ Sauce, Onions and Cilantro with Tomato Chunks. Yummy! For dessert you have to get a Pizookie! Warm cookie (chocolate chip, peanut butter, white chocolate chip [I think]) baked in a round tin, and topped with vanilla bean ice cream. Soft and creamy goodness! If do not want a regular sized pizookie, then you are in luck as they sell mini sized ones... you'll regret that decision pretty quickly though."
Amanda A.,"Riverside, CA",24,64,70,2.0,1/7/2017,"What a terrible experience. I understand that it's going to be busy, although we were fortunate enough to find a spot in the bar area. My issue came down to the food, and how the situation was handled. First, our food took about 35 minutes to come out. Specifically, my husband ordered a steal medium. His steak came out well done. The waitress came back to take it back but asked him to slide the meat on a separate plate, leaving just the sides. Meanwhile, it took another 30 minutes for them to bring back out the steak. It was odd that they didn't just bring out a full meal, but rather just a slab of meat.  I had no choice but to ask for a manager who offered to compensate the meal, which was nice, although Yelp check offered buy 1 get 1 free so there was not much incentive. I explained to the manager that it was about free food so to speak but the overall experience we were having. A few other things had occurred that don't need to be mentioned. The manager didn't offer much solution or empathy. I hate to say that this becomes my frustration with major food chains, you become a number of the revolving door."
Chief 1.,"La Mirada, CA",0,5,3,5.0,5/18/2017,"took forever to get served even though only 15% of the building was occupied. Waiter was a bit condescending (tipped him his 20%), but what do I care, he's the one working. HaHa. Food is worth the wait though"
