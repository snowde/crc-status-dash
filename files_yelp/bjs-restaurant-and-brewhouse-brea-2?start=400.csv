Taylor E.,"Brea, CA",0,9,,5.0,2/22/2015,First off I want to say they changed the buffalo chicken pizza which I was pretty bummed about but they made up for it with GREAT service and management!  The manager (Eric) heard us ask what was different about the pizza (they add BBQ sauce to it now) and he came right over to make sure everything was ok!  He was very professional and easy to talk to!    Our server Samantha was also very polite and professional about the whole thing!   The service saved our night!!!   Great job!
Meghan S.,"Brea, CA",33,6,,1.0,8/8/2014,"HORRIBLE service, this place has gone down hill. My mom and I came in on not a busy Friday and had to wait over 45 minutes for our server to tell us he forgot to put our order in....Um excuse me?! The worst part is that there are over 6 workers standing around socializing and laughing. It took over 10 minutes for the manager to get to our table and in between my mom had to get up and ask multiple times on why it's taking so long for the manager to come out, well I'm sure it's because he knows he has incompetent servers. I guess that's the risk we take when you get service from college kids that are careless and just want to fool around at work. Nonetheless, service is horrible and I'm disappointed because I love visiting the Brea area. I will just stick to the BJs by my house from now on."
David N.,"Fullerton, CA",264,3,,1.0,6/11/2015,"ZERO STARS!! One of the WORST experiences I've had in a while! Even Denny's has better service than this place! Server was super cocky with his skills and couldn't get anything we ordered right! Food took forever if it even came out! Server punched in the wrong food, split the checks incorrectly and was super rude. Don't act like a cocky server if you give the WORST service there! Server skipped over 3 people so they didn't get to order till he came back a second time around even though we were all at the table. When I inquired about my clearly forgotten meal he seemed to not be concerned which caused me to cancel especially since all my friends were done and some had even left by this time. When I was done being ignored by my server, I went to look for a manager and approached the host station to find an employee on their phone. I interrupted their obviously important Facebook status. The ONE STAR goes to the manager who was the only apologetic one but at that point I wasn't in the mood to hear any excuses, I just wanted to pay my bill and leave this horrible establishment."
Jaimie F.,"Long Beach, CA",130,4,2,5.0,1/2/2015,"Every time I dine here I am never disappointed, this place has great food, great service and a really nice atmosphere. I highly recommend the BJ's favorite pizza and the chocolate chip pizookie!"
odila s.,"Whittier, CA",0,1,1,1.0,1/1/2016,This place is has horrible customers service.  Our waitress amber was not helpful at all or friendly. Our food took like 20 to 30 minutes to get. This place is always bad. That's why  I always go to the one in Downey.
Sara P.,"Irvine, CA",243,577,248,3.0,4/6/2011,"This location is super hit and miss. The last time I went, it was ok. My mom and I were both not that hungry and ended up just getting salad and soup. My daughter got the kids cheese pizza.  All basic stuff, nothing you don't know about already.. What I liked most about this visit was the service. Our waitress was awesome. I have dealt with staff that was rude once they realized that the bill would probably be only twenty bucks, including since we weren't drinking. But she was awesome and chatty. Even super friendly to my daughter. IF our waitress had been rude, it would have knocked it down a star for sure."
Danny L.,"Whittier, CA",18,24,14,2.0,5/26/2014,They weren't as attentive as we thought they would be. Hope they treat their guests with a little more hospitality next time. Over all the food was ok. Not bad just ok. I had the kale and Brussel sprout salad w/ fire roasted salmon. I wasn't impressed. The salmon was a little bland. The beer is always good. If we come back it'll be for beer and appetizers. I updated my previous review from 3 stars to 2 stars. The waiter took a really long time to bring us our check. When we were ready he took long to close us out. I'm not thrilled about my experience here. I don't know the servers name but he had very interesting hair.
Antony M.,"Brea, CA",44,34,17,1.0,3/22/2015,"As normal, very slow service with substandard food quality. It seems to take forever to get our order and as we are constantly waiting, the waiter will ask us what we ordered again and again. Once food trickles out, one persons food will arrive while the other persons food will come 10-15 minutes later. This is very common. Now, while waiting for the second meal, we have time to examine the first meal to see they tend to skimp on everything. For instance, we ordered cheese potato wedges. It appears that they ran out of cheese cause one out of eight wedges had cheese, the rest may have had one or two strands of shredded cheese. Some had none. I feel this is substandard in all cases."
David S.,"Brea, CA",10,14,12,1.0,7/2/2015,"Very disappointed with the customer service at this location.  It appears that the staff and management do not care about their customers.  Last night I placed a take out order for two build your own pizza from their app. Here is where the trouble began,  on one of the pizza's I noticed sausage appeared, so I went into that order, removed the sausage and placed the order,  I did notice on my receipt that it did say No Sausage, strange, but okay.  However, when my son went to pickup the pizza's, the one I specified no sausage on, had it. My son called to find out what happened, after I told him, he said the server thought it was strange that I would put no sausage, so they assumed it meant that I wanted it.  First off, never assume, second, all they needed to do was pickup the phone to verify my order, but they didn't . So now they tell my son, he has to wait 20 minutes for a new pizza.  I told him, if that is the case, they need to remake both, because the other one that is correct, will be cold.  They told my son that the correct pizza is in the warmer and that they will not make a new one and that it will be fine.  I told my son to talk with a manager, which he informed me he did ask, but one never showed up. Well, sure enough, just like I thought, the pizza they did get correct was cold and overcooked, as we all know it would be.  There was no attempt at any compensation/apology for their mistake and  for the time my son had to waste waiting for a new pizza, since they decided to guess at what I may or may not want on my pizza.  I thought that the number one rule in customer service, is the the customer is always right. It is obvious that this location doesn't believe in that, and to top it all off, the pizza's were very greasy and made my wife sick.  Last time we visit this location!!!!!"
Tori Z.,"Riverside, CA",3,18,10,1.0,12/16/2014,"Normally I love this place but tonight was a disaster. Their system crashed in our section, understanding that it would take some time to get our orders in but my boyfriend and I waited at least 30 mins just for drinks. We ordered our food right away when we put in our drink order we were left waiting for our food for an hour. Our waitress walked by once or twice ""checking"" on us, barely finishing her words before she was gone again. The soda I ordered was flat, ordered a different one, also flat, settled for water. Another waitress dropped a plate right next to us so we had to clean off ranch from our shoes and coat. I get that a system crashing puts a lot of stress on a server but she completely forgot about us. I like BJs but from now on I'll be sitting at the bar."
Meo W.,"Placentia, CA",0,6,,1.0,1/28/2013,"I was in here with a group of friends this weekend. We called in about ten minutes before we got there to put our name in, as we had a party of nine and knew we would be waiting. The host said he couldn't give an estimated wait time over the phone and so we made our way over. As soon as we got there, my friends and I were told the wait time was going to be 20-30 minutes tops. I wasn't expecting any less because it was a Saturday night. We all had to stand outside in the rain because the inside was packed with employees walking back and forth and another group took up the chairs.  After about 40 minutes of waiting, we asked the host what was going on. He said it would be an additional 15-20 minutes. Which was a bit annoying as we were celebrating a birthday and had somewhere else to be. We thought since we had already waited a while, might as well stay. Big mistake. We checked in periodically only to be told to wait an additional 10 minutes. Finally after standing outside in the cold for about TWO HOURS, our table was ready. The girl who sat us was very nice and offered to take our drink orders because the server herself was nowhere to be found. This girl even took our orders. When it came time to pay, it took forever to get our change back. Long story short, the wait time was not worth it. I wouldn't recommend this location..."
Dan Z.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",1,33,,1.0,1/15/2015,Had a bad experience with a waiter. While closing out the check. We paid with $50 gift card + $40 Cash for $75 check. The waiter just tipped him self the $15 with out bringing back change or asking if we wanted change.  I Would avoid this place! unless you like to be robbed by the waiters.
Abba D.,"Yorba Linda, CA",17,35,,1.0,8/1/2014,"Worst food ever. I ordered the Honey Crisp chicken salad. It was the soggiest piece of sh!t I ever had. I sent it back. Three  non alcoholic drinks a bowl of soup, a pizza and mac and cheese cost us $50.00. Never again!!!!"
Mitchal Q.,"Chino Hills, CA",142,148,58,4.0,4/9/2013,"Ive been going to Bjs quite a lot lately for their lunch specials. If your hungry for a great lunch for a good price Bjs has that for you. They also have great beer that goes well with the food here (Jeramiah Red is one of my favorites). I believe Bjs is known for their pizza, and their pizzas are great, especially the bacon cheeseburger specialty pizza, but i have to say the four stars is not for just the pizza. In fact, many of the other choices on the menu are just as good or even better.  I often choose Bjs as the place to go to watch a laker game. They have a pretty good happy hour. Decent prices for drinks and half off on personal pizzas. The environment is also great for happy hour. They have big screens, serve pitchers of beers and it isn't usually too difficult finding open tables.  If your in the mood for lunch, dinner, or a quick beer and snack i would highly recommend Bjs. The service is great and you will have an enjoyable experience."
Neal P.,"Anaheim, CA",164,89,38,4.0,8/24/2014,"This place gets the extra star because of its decor inside.  It has all brick lay out and design, and it makes this place look fancy.  They were so crowded on a Saturday that they were not taking reservations and the wait time was about 45 minutes.  Luckily they had room at the bar so we could order drinks while we waited for our table.  Another thing they mentioned was that while you were waiting for the table, you could actually order your food on their app and then they can send it to your table to save time.  I did always like their own brewed beer, especially the IPA, and their pizza and of course their pizookie is the greatest dessert of any restuarnt.  I will be returning to this BJ or any BJs for that matter."
Kim N.,"Lexington, KY",201,572,15,2.0,9/23/2010,"You know, if I had written this review after my second-to-the-last visit, this would have gone a whole other way. But my last visit was so unfortunate that the review is getting skewed way to the other side.  Here is the thing - I have never had a problem dining in the restaurant. Service is good, pizza is actually really good - I like it. But then I got cocky and thought that I would place an order online for pick-up. And I got really crazy by typing in a special request.  So, I show up to pick up the two pizzas I ordered, right at the time they are supposed to be ready (40 minutes from when I placed the order). A girl comes to the counter with one of the pizzas and here is what entails: BJs - Your order is ready! (however, she has only one pizza) Me - Do you have my other pizza too? I ordered two pizzas.  BJs - (looks at printed order) I have a gluten-free pizza and a spinach-artichoke pizza. Right? Me - Yes, but you only have one pizza there. Where is the other one? BJs - There is only one pizza on the order.  Me - No, you just read two pizzas - one that is a gluten-free pizza and one that is a spinach-artichoke pizza. BJs - Right.  Me - But you only have one pizza here.  BJs - Hmmm... Okay - so after we finally establish that there should be two pizzas, she remembers that she doesn't have the other one because they could not accommodate my special request. So, instead of calling me to see what I wanted to do, they just made up the one pizza and thought that would be cool. What? So, she said that they could make the other pizza for me now that I was there and could instruct them as to what was okay, but I pointed out that the first pizza would be totally cold by then (we still had to take these home to eat them). I asked to speak with a manager and insisted that they remake the first pizza while they made the second pizza so that both would be fresh and ready at the same time. The manager was very nice and said that wouldn't be a problem.  Of course, no discount was offered for the inconvenience of having to sit there and wait 15 minutes for the pizzas (hello, the entire reason I placed my order online was so that I didn't have to sit and wait there) and to top everything off, I got home to find that my spinach-artichoke pizza had artichokes, but no spinach. Awesome."
Kristina E.,"Orange, CA",11,8,4,3.0,10/25/2014,Not one of the better BJ's around Orange County. The food was good. The pumpkin pizookie was a little under cooked but had good flavor. Our  iggest issue was with the service. It took 15 minutes from when we sat down to when our server came over. If the restaurant was busy I would understand it but it was 4:00pm and not many people in the place. When the server finally came over I ordered a beer which took 15 additional minutes to get. My dad's glass was cracked and we had to flag down a runner to help us since our server was no where to be found. So I give the 3 stars to the chefs and the runners who were the ones really working.
Tom C.,"Yorba Linda, CA",5,23,38,2.0,9/13/2014,"The only thing that I would come back for is to kill time and have a beer. Service was awful, food was cold both times (sent the first pizza back) and the drinks stayed empty. This place used to be great, what happened? Major overhaul needed but their brews are the only thing keeping this from being a 1 star review. Get a sampler and go from there.. there is nothing on the menu I can recommend at this point."
Tony L.,"Fullerton, CA",14,41,19,5.0,11/23/2014,This place is so awesome and services are number 1 !! My girl told me that she really loves this place and wants to come back ..
Leslie P.,"Brea, CA",8,34,,5.0,6/18/2013,"My 5 star review is based on my most recent visit only. See, although I live locally, I have not been a patron of this restaurant in about 10 years. I'm not sure if something happened that long ago that would've made me not want to go back, but anyhow, my husband and  children wanted to celebrate my birthday over dinner and I chose BJ's because they have giant stuffed baked potatoes which I have been totally craving. BJs did not disappoint! Our server was Sam G.... Nicest guy ever! Great service, friendly and perfectly attentive. The food was great... I ended up ordering a pizza instead of the potato. WARNING! Their deep dish pizza is great but every pizza comes with tomatoes piled on top with your chosen toppings. Fortunately I remembered this and ordered it without! My husband ordered some kind of jambalaya dish, my daughter had the fish and chips and my son the bacon cheeseburger. Everyone was very pleased with their meals! I tried my sons cheeseburger, it was very tasty and cooked perfectly well done, as my son had ordered. They offered me dessert (a small pizookie and ice cream) as it was my birthday,but I was stuffed from the delicious pizza so they packed it to go. It didn't last long once I got home... That thing was just too good!  A+ for BJ's brewery in Brea and Sam G!  I will definitely go again!"
