Brandon J.,"Diamond Bar, CA",1,14,6,5.0,11/11/2014,This place is great and the servers are the best! I love their Hopstorm IPA and that one cocktail sever ;)
Anonymous A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,77,1,1.0,12/15/2014,"Great location, clean spot if I just wanted a beer at the bar but the restaurant wait was horrendous, waiting waiting waiting is all we did. They changed the menu to something more on the healthy side which makes no sense for a brewhouse, we want fat with our beer WTF!? Goodbye to my favorites.... cajun shrimp pasta and Avocado Egg Rolls.... what a flippin' bummer. So disappointing."
Henry T.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",401,63,42,4.0,8/20/2014,"Love the handcrafted root beer, orange and cherry sodas and they're refillable. I love the  turkey burger it's filling and tasty. The pizzas are great. The pizookie is the best dessert. Good for late night grub they close at midnight midweek, Thursday-Sunday close at 1am."
Mel C.,"Bakersfield, CA",21,299,154,5.0,5/30/2010,"Berry Burst Cider is BERRY DELICIOUS!  Spinach Artichoke dip is the best thing on the menu!  Last night a group of us went and sat in the bar. We had the Best Beginnings appetizer, it was the perfect amount of food for us. We also had a whole bunch of tasty drinks.  Darren was our bartender and he is the best bartender I've ever had at any bar before. He was talkative and very helpful. I love BJ's, its my favorite restaurant. I'll continue to go back as long they are serving Berry Burst Cider and Spinach Artichoke dip!"
Rusty C.,"Villa Park, CA",24,64,10,1.0,6/8/2014,"Walked in and was not greeted by any of the 5 staff members in the front. They were all talking to each other and wrapping utensils. Finally got asked, '2?' And were seated. We get sat and waited 13 minutes and NOT A SINGLE PERSON approached us. at that point we decided to walk out and head down to a different restaurant. The manager tried stopping us on the way out saying she would take care of us but we refused. There were 2 waiters that kept passing our table for 13 minutes, not once did they even acknowledge our existance. We have been here many times before, maybe 3-4 times a year for 8 years and service had steadily decreased on the past few years. This ess our last straw and we will not ever return."
Joe M.,"Villa Park, CA",16,325,5,4.0,12/11/2012,"Had lunch with a group in December, all entrees were excellent.  My cobb salad was excellent.  The menu has lunch portions and dinner portions.  They also have a nice selection of lower calorie lunches.  Service was good and atmosphere was very nice."
Nur B.,"La Habra, CA",22,37,4,1.0,5/8/2015,tried to make a reservation with the manager and he was a flat out asshole- no sense of hospitality or kindness whatsoever.
Mirna L.,"Anaheim, CA",1,10,7,5.0,4/21/2014,So happy with the service my boyfriend and I received. Hailey was a fantastic server and really wanted us to leave our table happy (unfortunately there was a minor mix up with the TVs) but that didn't matter because of her.  The food was great. We ordered a pizza and also had two pazookies to celebrate our anniversary. Thank you hailey for providing the best possible service. We will definitely be back requesting you!
Brian C.,"Encino, CA",163,545,207,4.0,4/11/2014,Try their tomato and mozzarella salad with lager beer. Eat your veggies. Always love thier blonde ale. Pizza hits the spot.  Great service and vibe.
Aaron M.,"Anaheim, CA",3,17,13,2.0,8/31/2014,"If it wasn't for the food, this rating would have been worse. This place has horrible service and I could not find a manager to complain. Will not be coming back to this location!"
Patrice S.,"Rialto, CA",71,4,,1.0,5/16/2015,Was seated quickly but that was the only thing quick about it. It was the slowest service I've ever had. It took our server 10min to even take our drink order and another 10 to actually bring a beer and a cocktail. Was continually passed by. I had to ask for place settings. The server even took forever to actually take our money. I will not being coming back.
Stephanie C.,"Brea, CA",15,48,32,5.0,5/28/2011,"They have really great pizza! I also love being able to customize, and that they have corn as an option (I love corn!) I really love their current lunch menu since you can get a lot of food, for about $6-8 dollars. They also offer half sizes of most of their stuff which is usually too much food to begin with (their baked potatos/flat breads/salads/sandwiches) and have a really large selection (you can choose out of their various salads/sandwiches). Recommended? Their flat breads, their chili baked potato, chili nachos (can probably split between 4+ people), chicken parmegiana, clam chowder, avocado egg rolls, and oreo pizookie. I still have yet to try their brunch menu, but hopefully soon! The service is always pretty good, although it can get really busy at night on the weekends so there will likely be a wait.  One thing I love is that you can actually call in to have your name put down (and ask how long the wait is). (Apparently they have an iPhone app for this now too). Perfect for me since I live close by."
SK D.,"Orange, CA",3,16,1,1.0,10/20/2014,Service was terrible. Bar service was very poor and they were not even very busy. Food was alright.
Christine K.,"Los Angeles, CA",301,717,479,4.0,3/5/2012,"My favorite BJs location. Why? b/c it's the closest to home. haha It's always very busy and a wait every night it seems. But I don't find it too difficult snagging a spot at the bar. I love their assortment of freshly brewed beers on tap and their appetizer sampler. If you need a meal, get the pizza...some salads and pastas are good as well.  I wouldn't really order their entrees though...just doesn't seem like the place to. Oh! Almost forgot. I know it sucks that they don't take resos. But at least they accept call ins. If you call in while you're on your way to BJ's, they will add your name to the wait list. You check in when you get there and they give you a pager. So now you don't need to wait 45mins for table. :)"
Michelle S.,"Brea, CA",0,5,2,5.0,10/16/2015,"We had great customer service tonight! For a Friday evening our waiter Albert L was very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed on a timely manner. We couldn't of asked for a better server, thank you Albert!"
Tina W.,"Rowland Heights, CA",30,464,129,4.0,7/12/2014,The BBQ chicken pizza is hands down the best here. Slices are good size and kind of thick so off one or two you can easily begin to get full. I really enjoy drinking large glass of strawberry lemonade just wish they could tone down the sweetness level little. For dessert I recommend that you try their famous chocolate chip pizzokie with vanilla ice cream.
Tommy S.,"Anaheim, CA",87,176,156,4.0,2/2/2012,BJ's is a fun place to go when you want to have happy hour you can have pizza beer side orders. I ordered a medium pizza with mushrooms pepperoni onion Green pepper ground sausage and extra extra cheese. I had two pale ale beers and a side of chicken wings. This was so good I will definitely come back yummy in my tummy uncle Tommy. PS: The service was very good also.
Steevens A.,"Los Angeles, CA",538,459,1402,3.0,4/2/2012,"They poured water into my friend's sprite when he was halfway done with it. Not a good sign, considering it was the same guy who took our drink orders. Your standard BJ's fare... the pizza was good... but that's expected from BJ's. The service left a lot to be desired... but I'll go here again. One of my friends lives close by. Oh, and Omar's is there too! :)"
Cherish K.,"Brea, CA",5,16,6,5.0,10/2/2014,BJ's was the perfect lunch choice. We sat in the bar & tried their lunch specials. Salads were cold & crispy. My California Sandwich was tasty & I loved the skinny fries.
Amy K.,"Fullerton, CA",7,9,4,1.0,8/30/2014,"I expect bad, slow service when I go to BJ's unfortunately but tonights was something else. I took my son and his friend and we shared the 2 for $22 and upgraded to large pizza, I ordered half buffalo chicken for myself and half smoked bacon and pepperoni for the boys. 1st a bug flew and landed in my salad and it took a while to get a new one. Then the pizza comes out and there's tomatoes on the boys side,  the server who dropped it off tried arguing with me that its what was ordered but eventually she took it back. About 5-10 minutes later the manager brings the pizza out and proceeds to tell me they just took off the tomatoes because if they had to make a new one it would take too long! This was the manager!!  No sorry your order came out wrong, nothing!  Not sure I'll be going back to this BJ's anytime soon!!"
