Michael S.,"Diamond Bar, CA",3,4,,1.0,3/25/2014,"As we approach the hostess booth we need to try and get the hostess' attention as she is talking with 5, of what appear to be servers. We ask for a booth and are taken to a 2 ft. table. I asked for something a little bigger and we are reluctantly taken to a booth that is larger. After waiting for someone to come to the table for about 10 minutes we quickly realized that most everyone waiting tables was at the hostess area chatting; so we left. As we were leaving, the hostess didn't bother to ask why, (I think she knew why) she yelled have a nice day as we walked out."
Sharon S.,"Modesto, CA",84,158,95,4.0,2/16/2014,Yummy food & we were able to sit outside! Loved it! They were super busy & we had a large party but they rose to the occasion & served us fairly quick. Everyone was pleased!
Elena R.,"San Francisco, CA",0,11,,2.0,12/3/2014,"The two stars is for the kitchen. The food and drink are excellent here, and I have nothing but good things to say about that aspect of my experience here.  However, while out with friends at this certain BJs, there was one particular waitress who clearly hates her job. And if she doesn't hate her job, she has a funny way of showing that she actually cares about the service she gives. The welcoming host walks me and my party over to a booth, and then a couple minutes later, a waitress comes by, passes out napkins as if she's in a hurry and barks to us, ""Drinks?"" No ""Hi, welcome to BJs, how are you tonight?"" No, none of that. Just abruptly and rudely: ""Drinks?"" My party and I are taken aback by this, but she continues to take our drink and food order. When our food is ready, she comes out with the plates, slaps each one in front of us, and immediately leaves. She doesn't ask if we need anything else, like a refill, salt and pepper, etc. She just departs the table without speaking a word to us, her guests and customers. About 10 or 15 minutes later, another waiter comes by and introduces himself, and explains that our previous waitress' shift was over and went home for the day. Then, we all understand. This waitress decided not to give us the light of day because she was not going to get a tip out of us anyway since her shift would be completed before we finished eating. Therefore, she didn't even TRY to give us good service .  The next waiter was fine and dandy and everything like that, but come on. If you're a waitress, you're there to give great service. That is your job, and I understand tipping is a major part of the job's pay, but we came out to have a great time and have a great dinner service. And because of her, we didn't. I only wish I remembered her name.  In conclusion, the food is great, but there are clearly some duds within their waitstaff. I'll continue eating at BJ's, but I probably won't come back to this one."
nancy r.,"Anaheim, CA",117,269,52,4.0,3/9/2010,"The new lunch menu they have rolled out is amazing! It has been a while since I had visited this area. I ate here around 2pm and it was pretty dead. My friend and I went to the bar top and were treated very nicely by Heidi and then another server whom took over but didn't get his name. Service was really good. I had the lunch 7oz  salmon with steamed rice and veggies. The salmon didn't even need a squeeze of lime, it was seasoned and cooked to  perfection.  You cannot beat 10.99 for that! Its incredible! Plus pair that off with a HH Beer for 3.00. BJ's I love you!"
Samantha R.,"Buena Park, CA",0,5,,1.0,4/12/2015,So where do I begin... My boyfriend and I decided to come here for dinner. We waited for about 15 minutes not bad considering we were in on a Saturday night and there had just been a group of about 50 ppl leaving ...looked like prom.. But then we got seated and everything was fine our server Robert was nice and he got us drinks. Next we ordered an appetizer but we couldn't eat because we had no utensils and we couldn't find him or any other serve seems like he was the server for the area where we sat. Then we finally got our utensils then he asked us if we were doing okay and we said yes then our food came and after he didn't bother checking up on us.. Keep in mind he was not the person who brought out our food. So no refills or anything.. We waited a more then 30 minutes to get a hold of him for a refill I even put my cup towards the edge of the table where it was visible for him to see and get an idea that we needed refills. He was not attentive at all. When we asked for boxes he asked if we were having dessert so I ordered my dessert and I asked for a refill I got my dessert about 15 minutes later and I got my refill after I was all done with dessert and everything. He did not bother checking on us and I can just imagine the lack of device I would have received if I had been dinning in during there actual rush hour because it was pretty slow towards the time I got seated. I have came to this location on a Saturday night with a group of 10 and have gotten better service then this which was my first time at bjs and this is my second time here and I'm sad to say I won't be coming back. If I could have grabbed utensils and my own refill trust me I would have but this is what I come to a restaurant for. And believe me I was not the only unhappy guest the night I came in I even overhear a customer tell our serve Robert 20 hours later when he finally received his drink. I wasn't rude to him myself because I also work retail but come on step it up !!!
Justin H.,"Whittier, CA",430,147,278,4.0,1/1/2014,This place is the bees knees people how have y'all not been here yet? I haven't had food I've disliked from here yet... The pizza is a sure fire thing to get.. If you're on a budget get the Bjs burger with cheese or the unlimited salad and soup will do the trick
Kaylee D.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,104,27,2.0,7/15/2014,Service here is always slow...no matter what time of day. And the food is more bland that at other locations. Not sure why! But there are better BJ's locations
Alexa R.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,11,,1.0,10/7/2014,"WORST experience ever.   (Let me start by saying I'm a server at a restaurant. We close at 10 and do last call at 9:45PM and I had people coming in until the last minute.) So I finally get off of work and call a friend up. It was Saturday, October 4th. All my friend and I came in there for was a glass of wine and something to snack on like fries or a small appetizer. It was 12:20AM when we walked in and they close at 1AM. That would've given us 40 minutes to drink and snack. We walked up to the hostess stand and she immediately said, ""Uh our servers are trying to get out of here but let me see if they want to take you."" ??? I'm sorry but the restaurant doesn't close for another 40 MINUTES.. I did not know it was the servers' choice who gets to eat at that restaurant. She finally came back and said we are able to sit but we walked out. We went to TGIF for wine and happy hour and had a wonderful time so thank you BJ's!!!!!!"
Karen S.,"Anaheim, CA",0,10,1,5.0,8/19/2014,Great service from BJs! Lovely waiters and host! My server was James and he was awesome! Ordered the fettuccine chicken Alfredo and was amazing!!!Love to come back here again!
Chriss L.,"Fullerton, CA",41,507,269,4.0,3/3/2010,"not bad, not bad at all! It's been awhile since I've eaten here, but with my pay check looking smaller than it used to, their ""Lunch Specials starting at $5.99"" banner looked more attractive than usual... Went here with fiance for a late lunch.  Service was kinda slow considering the place was kinda empty I ordered the mini one topping pizza and salad combo for about $6.99? The house salad is nothing special and they forgot to put ranch on the side. The pizza was softer,crispier, more delish than I remembered! WOW! But what my fiance ordered stopped me in my tracks: creamy tomato soup (That had more the consistency of a pasta sauce) and grilled ham and cheese. Separately they were just good, but together they were an unbeatable combo! I gotta say this is a MUST TRY I saw their other lunch specials being served near us. One woman ordered teriyaki something. I dont know if she ordered lots of sauce or something, but that thing WAS SMOTHERED in sauce..... i dont think I could eat that.  two drinks, two lunch specials, one pizookie (sweeter than i remember, sickeningly sweet) tip and tax ~ $30 not bad at all"
Kimberley H.,"Laguna Hills, CA",21,172,19,2.0,6/6/2012,"I was here again the other night for happy hour in the bar. I got there first and waiting for my girlfriends who were stuck in traffic. We usually go to the Tustin location, but every now and then we come to this one. As we always do, I ordered the chips and salsa off the appetizer menu. In Tustin, the chips are refillable, but the waitress here told me that the chips were not refillable and it was a whole new order.  Seriously? Chips? Are they going to break the bank? I mean we are all ordering drinks here so it isn't like we're trying to cheap out, but we LOVE the salsa (which comes in a bowl for goodness sake) but apparently the chips can't be replenished. Absolutely ridiculous.  We wound up ordering a second plate of chips and salsa, so then we wound up with two bowls of salsa that was tossed out when we finished the chips. Waste. I know it shouldn't be a big deal, but it is to me. It's chips people!!"
Pete R.,"Whittier, CA",11,27,5,2.0,6/8/2014,"Waiter Robert is the worst, most inattentive, no personality waiter in this place. This is the last time I come here. Service always sucks here. Food was just OK. 3 burgers were ordered and requested them to be cooked medium. Obviously that means well done. They were all dry and tasteless.   I really want to Like this place, and I'm  really not that hard to please. That's why I keep giving it a try."
Kevin W.,"Garden Grove, CA",16,5,,1.0,8/1/2015,"Ordered a mahi mahi tacos. When it came, the tacos showed little to no meat. Asked the waiter to put more meat on and waited about thirty minutes for the same plate to arrive. By that time, my party had already eaten and I was no longer craving food. Terrible service and horrible solutions from the staff. There was no excuse for the meal nor the amount of time I waited."
Jamie G.,"Buena Park, CA",54,22,8,4.0,6/28/2014,Had the bbq chicken pizza and the Parmesan crusted chicken both were good but the macademi white choclate pazookie was delicious !!!
Joyee C.,"Monterey Park, CA",61,264,616,5.0,6/28/2014,I loves to join friends group at this place!  The food is ok with acceptable price!  The restaurant has good promotion sometimes!
Laila N.,"Anaheim, CA",96,278,12,3.0,7/9/2012,"There were some pros and cons to my last visit.  Con-The waitress did not know much about the beers available, other than the BJs brews. I asked about which Lost Abbey and Bruery beer they were serving, and she couldnt tell me and didnt seem all that interested in finding out for me.  Pro-service regarding food was quick and easy. Was even able to get 4 birthday pizooki's.  They seem to have changed their pizzas though. They no longer come in that deep dish pan, so the crust isnt as thick or crispy as it used to be. Not sure when or why they changed it. Was a bit disappointed about that."
Cinda L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,1.0,9/2/2015,"I tried this location a few more times and continued to receive the same crappy service and carelessness. One time our spinach artichoke dip hadn't even made it to the oven so it was completely liquid with unmelted cheese on top. One time the people next to us received their pasta dish sin pasta.... As in it was just the sauce and meat thrown in a bowl. HOW does the kitchen forget to include the main ingredient and how does the plate make it to the customers table without correcting the mistake?? We also received stale french fries once. I have since moved away from the area, but I had stopped going to that location and would drive an extra 15 minutes to the City of Industry location when I wanted BJ's. It's SO much better there and was SO worth the drive! They even made me an item that I used to love and is no longer on the menu! I suggest taking the time and effort to avoid the Brea location!!!"
Unique R.,"Fullerton, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/27/2015,This is the worst service in the world. The server is the slowest and ignored us four times after he clearly heard and saw our party trying to get his attention. After 20 mins he finally comes to see what we needed. We have been waiting for our check to come out for  about 40 minutes. He not once asked if we needed anything our offered to refill our waters. Over 300 dollars worth of food that wasn't worth it. When ordering he only asked half of the table what they wanted to eat and the other half was just sitiing with there mouths open!!! What kind of service is this ?!!
Pauly D.,"Santa Ana, CA",18,23,,4.0,2/7/2013,"I went here with a friend of mine for lunch on a Thursday evening around 5:30, the place wasn't crowded at all. Not bad to start out.  I walked in and there was no line. I was seated IMMEDIATELY! I ordered Scampi Shrimp Pasta 15min later my meal came..until... 10 second later before I can get a bite off the pasta, my waiter came and asks me ""How's everything here?"" ..What can I say? I said.. ""everything is good"" Started chomping down the pasta and shrimps. And I have to say: It's very satisfying! Would I come back here again? SURE! -1 star for disrupting le derps' first bite."
Abraham C.,"Anaheim, CA",2,15,,4.0,8/26/2014,"Aside from the waitress taking a long time to bring the food and refilling our drinks on a slow day, the steak was delicious! It may get supper busy at times, but completely worth the wait. I'll give this place a 4 out of 5 because of the food."
