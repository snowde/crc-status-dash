Anne P.,"Orange County, CA",1090,115,237,1.0,9/11/2013,"This visit already started off bad when the hostess walked me to my seat and there were food crumbs alllllllll over the booth. SMH. Worst customer service that I have ever had at a BJ's. My guests and I hardly saw our waitress except for taking our order and bringing us our food. She never asked us how we were doing and it took forever and a day to get our bill delivered and returned. But that wasn't the worst part... THERE WAS A BUG IN MY FOOD!!!! At first I thought it was a flying bug but it still stayed there and I tried shooing it away. Disgusting! Last time I am getting the Thai shrimp lettuce wrap. The manager tried making me feel better by making me a new plate but when he brought it over, I was already disgusted by the previous plate. He then asked me if I wanted something else so I said calamari. It took another 10 mins for that to come out and by that time I was already over the whole experience. The waitress still took her sweet time, it was so miserable being served by her. The check came and I loved that the manager comped the calamari but left the shrimp lettuce wrap, you know the one WITH THE BUG IN IT! I had to wait another 5 minutes for him and when I told him he said ""Oh, I thought I took that off"". No sir, no you didn't. You obviously did not care enough to take the time to make sure everything was ok. I did not even get to express my feeling about my experience, he cut me off when I started talking. Ugh, totally disgusted by this manager, the lame waitress, just the overall vibe from this place.  Best believe that waitress did not get a tip and I for one will not come back to this location. I rather go to Yardhouse in Brea. It's only 5 mins down the street, the service and food is better. Hell I rather go to Friday's than this BJ's and that's saying something!"
Juan C.,"Fullerton, CA",50,7,1,4.0,8/14/2014,"Came here doubting this restaraunt due to the horrible reviews on yelp, but turns out to be a great service restaurant well at least my waiter was. Great place bomb food, beer, and their mouth watering pasooki dankssssss. Recommended :)))"
Genius G.,"Los Angeles, CA",259,115,140,4.0,5/15/2014,"This location has outdoor seating!! Yeah! Ok I like to sit outdoors when eating, and this is the only BJs that Ive been too that offers it. Downey no, Cerritos no, Long Beach no, Las Vegas no, West Covina no, you get the picture. The food taste the same as the others, the service is good like the others. My favorite is the Broccoli cheese soup in the bread bowl...awwww soooo goood! Oh and the craft beers are good too, try the taster set."
Dennis K.,"Buena Park, CA",1,12,5,5.0,8/12/2014,Love this location. wait time is a little while but the wife and I really enjoy the food and the services =)
Kevin S.,"Brea, CA",184,313,35,3.0,3/29/2012,"Went to the bar for happy hour. Even though it was dead, service by the two guys working the bar was inattentive and the vodka tonics I ordered were watered down. Didn't realize a well vodka here was $6.25, but then -$1 from that for happy hour. This is not a great price for a watered down drink. The BJ's specialty beers are $2 off for HH though, so you can get a good sized one for $4.75..... not bad."
Jose V.,"Anaheim, CA",12,2,,2.0,8/9/2015,"Been going to BJ's for around 10 years and have never experienced such horrible service than at the La Brea branch. I hope this is not a frequent event. Apart from being threatening and offensive about an alcohol-related ID delay for our international guest (who don't carry around passports around all the time; honest mistake), we ordered a 1/2 Sweet Pig 1/2 BJ's favorite. Apart from the waitress being rude and cold, she put in a wrong order and looked extremely annoyed at us when we told her the mistake when the pizza was brought over. To make matters worse, we waited over an HOUR for the right pizza to arrive afterwards. The manager, Leon, looked heavily disinterested in our complained and actually tried to charge us for the incorrect pizza and tried to be ""making us happy"" by discarding that charge, even though we didn't order that pizza. I even wanted to order a pzookie but was discouraged after the entire ordeal. The (now closed) Long Beach and Cerritos branches have much better service. In terms of food though, it was great, as usual, albeit the longer wait time and horrible service."
Thao A.,"Temecula, CA",242,124,49,4.0,7/22/2009,"I used to eat here all the time, and I mean ALL the time. And I usually always order the same thing. First, I'd order their half-sized caesar salad and then their avovado egg roll as my appetizer and then finish my order off with their bbq chicken pizza. As for drinks.. if you're a non-alcoholic drinker you can order their strawberry lemonade, which is alright. For all you alcoholics out there, you can try one of these drinks or heck, try ALL of them because they're all pretty good. A Drink Like That - Grey Goose Vodka, BACARDI 151 Rum, DeKuyper Pucker Sour Apple, DeKuyper Pucker Island Blue, sweet & sour mix, Sierra Mist and a splash of grenadine. What A Peach - ABSOLUT Vanilia Vodka, DeKuyper Pucker Peach, BOLS Peach Schnapps, pineapple and orange juices, club soda and a splash of grenadine. Pomegante Sunset -  Stoli Razberi Vodka, PAMA Pomegranate liqueur, BJ's fresh squeezed lemonade, orange juice and Monin Pomegranate. Ultimate Long Island - ABSOLUT Vodka, TANQUERAY Gin, BACARDI Rum, Cointreau Orange Liqueur, sweet & sour mix and a splash of Pepsi. Also, if you're looking for a place to celebrate your birthday our loved ones birthday, I highly suggests having it here. I had my 22nd birthday dinner here with a party of about 25 guests and it turned out pretty well. I was very satisfied!"
Krissy M.,"Sarasota, FL",663,833,22,3.0,9/12/2011,We have been to a few BJ's in Florida so we were glad to see this chain pop up on our Yelp radar when we were staying in the Anaheim area last weekend. The food was good (shared a pizza and avocado eggrolls) but the service was so-so...seemed like they really wanted to turn over our table.  Good thing Yogurtland was nearby so we could actually feel comfortable about chatting and socializing somewhere!
Jonathan L.,"Santa Ana, CA",4,10,,2.0,6/30/2014,"The food here is ok. The pasta I got was so gross, I didn't even bother taking two bites. My moms rice was flavorless. The only good thing was the service, and my dad's steak. Everything else besides that was gross."
Dustin C.,"Fullerton, CA",21,14,3,1.0,4/29/2014,Half hour wait for a pizookie? And your server didnt apologize or even come over once to check on us? It's 11:30pm and not even busy. You've got to be kidding me.
Aileen A.,"Anaheim Hills, Anaheim, CA",61,5,,1.0,9/15/2013,"I usually like this BJs but if i could give my experience tonight zero stars i would. I've never ever experienced the lack of customer service. I rarely write a review or even complain but my experience today was beyond words and ridiculous. The head manager of this establishment does not the the meaning of customer service. We came here to celebrate a friends birthday. One of our friends who might I add is 32 years old wanted to order a drink, but he didn't have his ID. We all knew that it would be tough to order a drink but we wanted to at least try. So we spoke to the head manager and her exact words were ""no offense but you're not worth my Job."" And I'm sorry but regardless of the situation you as the head manager should never say that to a customer. Besides that we tried to have a good time. We ordered 2 large pizzas one came out so cold that the cheese wasnt even melted and the dough wasn't even cooked through and the other came out wrong, we ordered a pepperoni and pineapple pizza but it came out without pineapple. The server who was training apologized and took it back but then brought it back and they literally just sprinkled pineapple on top. It was edible but not good. We weren't going to say anything until the couple next to us pulled a handful of hair off their pizza. At this point no one could eat anymore. We asked to see the managers again and a different manager came and he was extremely accommodating and he was truly embarrassed at the quality of food that was given to us. He was extremely apologetic and he took off our two pizzas from the bill. I wish I would've gotten their names but lesson learned I won't be coming back."
Andrew F.,"Brea, CA",113,1,,5.0,10/27/2013,I highly recommend the wedge fries with pulled pork sandwich ! Another great thing was the service . Our server by the name of Dani. She was awesome. She was quick to serve us and checked up on me and my friend at the right moments. Thankyou Dani !!! Will recommend you as my server again. Anyways the food is always awesome !! yeah BJs !!
Julia J.,"Chino, CA",63,262,1851,5.0,5/5/2012,This 5 star is for this specific (Brea) location.  We were here today to celebrate my niece and nephew's confirmation.  There was about 25 in our party.  My sister-in-law had pre-arranged the menu.  We had 5 pizzas and 3 large salads.  The pizza was cold when it came out.  It was mentioned to our waiter - who immediately remedied the situation.  The service level for our large group was AMAZING - I've been to large group functions before and the service level diminishes with a larger group.   Our wait staff was very attentive and sincere about providing excellent service.  I really appreciated it and it is unusual to find this quality in a 'chain'.  My regret was not getting the names of our servers so I could write a nice letter to their corporate office - they deserve this recognition. I would highly recommend coming here with a large group (providing you arrange it ahead of time).  I've been to BJ's (different city) with a larger group a couple of times and it was a disaster - but I think the difference was they knew about our party well in advance and could plan and staff accordingly.  :D  Good job Brea BJ's!!!!
Marki H.,"Santa Clarita, CA",39,41,47,3.0,3/6/2014,"We can't seem to make it through a whole dinner without sending something back.  At times, the food has been cold or not cooked correctly.  The good news is they always do their best to make it right.  Even when they  miss the mark,  we keep giving them another chance!  That must be a testament to their effort to make the customer happy."
Janelle M.,"La Habra, CA",13,2,1,5.0,1/8/2014,"I love you bazoookies,! Stuffed mushrooms and mac and cheese.... make my mouth drop! I would eat you any day any time !"
Johnny L.,"Monterey Park, CA",637,44,,2.0,8/8/2011,I FRIGGIN LOVE BJ's! But I dislike this one in BREA! I went here for my Birthday and service was terrible. They took a long time getting me a menu and my orders. On top of that I had to find out that they didn't have any more Pizookies! AND the only thing they were serving that night was just appetizers. If you plan on coming here. Give them a call first!
Bruce A.,"Yorba Linda, CA",45,79,485,3.0,3/14/2014,"Usually when my wife and I go to BJ's we have a good experience. This time we decided to go and take my mother-in-law I would meet them there after work. Well I got there early and got a table in the bar are so we could order happy our appetizers , so I ordered chicken wings. Then my wife called we had to move to a table so I got a table, got drinks ordered, our waitress name was Bridget,.she started of strong got our  drinks suggested the root beer,( they don't have coke) by Bridget the root beer was really good my wife had a strawberry lemonade, my mother-in-law had a lemonade. Then she took our order she nelt down ( like every good waitress, or waiter does) my mother-in-law ordered a full rack of baby back ribs with a baked potato, my wife ordered chicken wings, I ordered the the 5oz black and blue burger with fries, but at the end of the meal there was no hot towls, not even towlets ( handi-wipes) and the baked potato was cold ( our waitress got anew hot one for us) and we had to ask twice for things,  maybe Bridget was new but we come back ."
lisa s.,"Whittier, CA",1,7,,2.0,6/29/2015,"When we were offered a seat in the bar, with a comment that the service would be better & wouldn't take as long (it's father's day after all), we jumped at the opportunity. Wrong, waitress had no personality., that's ok, can deal w/that, puts a commemoration cup on the table, no comment, is this a gift? Dirty utensils, request some condiments, ate the meal w/no condiments. Like bj's, but not in a holiday."
Ron L.,"Covina, CA",4989,1343,5039,4.0,4/22/2009,"We ended up on the patio and it was really cool with music playing and a nice breeze and great waitresses....especially (Jennifer).  I drank my soda within seconds and Jennifer said, ""you wern't thirsty were you?""        I ordered my steak and it was delicious...as I completely poured one of those very tiny A-1 steaksauce bottles all over my steak (see photos of steak) .       The bowl of chili was delicious and my mom's fettucini was great too with very tastey garlic bread.       Funny, I've been to BJ's several times before and have had that pazzooki and always feel so bloated after I'm done eating that.        Excellent food and service"
Kyle S.,"Fullerton, CA",133,195,58,4.0,4/24/2012,"Been here on a couple of occasions now and I do not know why I have not reviewed this place. I think it might be that you cannot check in here. hmmmm... Well lets start off with the beer.  They do call themselves a brewhouse and their beers do not disappoint.  They are relatively inexpensive and are much better than the other beers you may order (bud light, miller lite, etc....)  I have tried about half of them and am pleased with all of them. The food here while good is a little pricy.  With their specialty deep dish pizzas costing around $10 for a small this is just outrageous.  Their pizzas are about the size of a pizza hut personal pan pizza and they charge you $10 no way jose.  That is why I only order pizza during happy hour when it is half off.  Definite win.  The pizzas are of high quality, they are delicious, but definitely not worth $10, maybe about $8 but not $10.   The real reason for me to come here though is the pizookie.  It is a warm freshly baked cookie topped with ice cream and man is it delicious.  They come in flavors from the original chocolate chunk to red velvet.  I have tried almost all of them and they are all equally delicious.  I have come here on a few occasions just for the pizookie and I wish that they would have these go on special on happy hour too."
