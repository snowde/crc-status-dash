Liv V.,"Brea, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/9/2013,Wow! Went to my former favorite place to meet my friend. We have been meeting here for a year because LOVE their food. It is the only place we can agree on for lunch or drinks.  We had an unexpected friend show up.....a flying COCKROACH! They didn't seem to care much. A waitress came and hit it with a rag. A manager only came by and took our cash to pay the bill. No apology from the manager. We won't be meeting there again.
Angela W.,"Los Angeles, CA",111,180,27,2.0,5/24/2013,"Honestly, this is by far probably the worst I've ever had in my life. EVERYTHING had too much sodium in it. This was for late night on Mother's day. The seats were dirty, we didn't even have utensils until we asked, the calamari was sad in terms of amount. I've never had such a poor experience. Our server was excellent but the management needs to work on it. There was a server I guess she was off duty, but her bf/friend and another guy was just lingering in the lobby hugging and kissing. Then walked out with arms around each other's shoulder. I don't know about ya'll out there but I don't think my work would be very happy about that."
S. F.,"Bloomfield, NJ",0,45,,4.0,6/11/2015,Pleasantly surprised here! Came in very late night at 12:30am and they closed at 1am but they still made us food and were so incredibly nice. I had the bacon chicken ranch pizza and it was delicious.
Ben M.,"Fullerton, CA",0,4,,5.0,7/16/2014,"Im not here to vouch for other peoples dinning experience, but the five stars I am giving is specifically for our waitress Isabelle. After reading some of the reviews, my buddy and I were a little skeptical of coming. I know a bad service experience does kill the whole mood and enjoyability of our food.  We came here not knowing what to order, so she starts off with asking general questions of what we like, we simmered down, and we eventually ordered 1) seared honey lime scallops 2) Chipotle glazed salmon 3) BBQ pizza. Im more of a seafood guy and my buddy is more of a pizza burger kinda guy. Ive never let the waitress order for me which made me kinda nervous but in the end I am very glad I did. The honey lime scallops are cooked to perfection with no raw fishy smell. Same goes for the salmon and the perfect chipotle glaze. It is not too overpowering to where you cannot even taste the fish. As for the pizza, she recommended getting it slightly well done because sometimes the dough might be a little too soft for someones liking.  We started off with a beer taster and ended up washing everything down with their jeremiah red and hopstorm IPA. I tried their seasonal hoppy Scotsman, let me tell you this..I am not a fan of that beer. Its too hoppy for me. should've guessed by the name they chose for the beer baby.  Because of her recommendations and slight modifications, we had an awesome experience. Next time, we are definitely going to request for her. For someone to actually take the time of their day to suggest things and make sure you get what you really want is awesome.  The only  bad thing I have to say about this restaurant is that during the games, it is completely impossible to get seating in the bar (understandable).  Btw, do not forget to try their cookies and cream pizzokie.  even if you do not have room for it... completely worth it.  dont skip it. seriously...dont. and isabelle if youre reading this, you are an awesome human being!"
Lauren Ashley S.,"Orange, CA",77,144,77,4.0,1/21/2012,"I love BJ's Restaurant and I don't come nearly enough. I love their cheeseburger and their caesar salad, but most of all, I love their pezookis!   I brought a friend from out of town here to try their beer sampler and food, she left absolutely ranting and raving about BJs and she wished there was one in our hometown.  BJs has always provided consistent customer service and food. Their prices are moderate, their portions are reasonable and they have an excellent selection of beers and food.  There's sometimes a long wait here (Thursday + weekends), but it's totally worth it."
Sean M.,"Anaheim, CA",0,5,,1.0,10/24/2013,Food is OK but Service is awful. Have to wait a long time for food and drinks. Order was delayed and wrong. Give this place a miss.
Kirill O.,"Long Beach, CA",0,10,,4.0,7/7/2014,"I always go to BJ's thinking ""this time I'll try something different,"" but inevitably I order pizza and beer. That said, they do have delicious mozzarella sticks and tortilla soup. If you like your beers dark and heavy, get the porter. Be sure to save some room for a pizzookie at the end. So what if it will bring you one step closer to diabetes..."
Steve L.,"Santa Monica, CA",143,1190,17,3.0,11/28/2009,"Not a bad spot.  Standard BJ's... with the standard choices of food.  Parking was a bit tougher for this spot, maybe because people were trying to take advantage of after Thanksgiving sales.  Just drive a little bit past their valet area, and you'll find plenty of parking. Otherwiseg nothing really distinct to write about this particular location..."
Darlene M.,"Fullerton, CA",9,23,116,3.0,3/18/2014,I Notice when you order strawberry lemonade juice refill  the waiter became grouchy when you Ask for the third time. Not just strawberry lemonade juice any refill juice. I know there job isn't so easy but we need more juice! I guess if not so good service not so good tip aswell ;)
Lily S.,"Orange County, CA",140,80,485,5.0,3/13/2009,BJ's has to be one of my favorite American restaurants and trust me I don't have that many so BJ's is super good. My bestfriend started taking me here about last year and now it has become my number one suggestion whenever people ask where to go eat. The service is great! The food is great! & the price isn't too bad!  MY USUAL: Seasoned fries  Clam Chowder [bread bowl is optional] Hot wings* [sauce is so bomb] & celery Shrimp Chardonnay Pasta* Bazookie*
Alexandria H.,"Whittier, CA",73,32,,4.0,1/9/2014,"always here for lunch, I get mac and cheese and a pizookie. great food! but I will say that my food never comes out the same way. it's always made differently but it's still good. Service could be a little better especially the front host."
Amanda M.,"Fullerton, CA",66,47,41,5.0,3/12/2014,"Server was on point and food was great. Literally have nothing to complain about when I went to this location other than the wait. But, I guess it's a good thing that that many people want to eat there. I always figure it a lot of people like to dine there, they must be doing something right!"
Steve F.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,5,,1.0,4/13/2014,I've always been a long time fan of pizza and fresh brewed beer at BJ's but my experience last Sunday April 6 was awful at the Brea mall location.  After a 40 minute wait to be seated my friends and I were banished to the outdoor patio.  There we sat there and waited for very basic services such as drinks and silverware.  After a longer than normal wait food arrived and it was cold.  Last visit to this BJ's!
Jessica Z.,"Binghamton, NY",4,3,,4.0,6/23/2014,My husband stopped here for dinner one evening. I had the Chicken tortilla soup and my husband had a prime rib steak. We were both very pleased with our meal. We sat out on the patio and it was quiet and beautiful.
M R.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,9,,1.0,4/7/2015,"My party and I had spent over two hundred dollars, at least, and then there was a misunderstanding within our party. The manager (the one with the flamboyant mustache) said we were okay to stay and then came back and changed his mind. He was rude and uninterested in listening to our reasoning. I wouldn't recommend this locale to anyone."
Mary N.,"Los Alamitos, CA",475,1627,1012,4.0,10/10/2011,Fast service and good well priced lunch menu.
Mike D.,"Lake Forest, CA",0,15,6,1.0,4/20/2013,"Really bad food. I had the 12oz Ribeye, ordered medium rare. Not sure how they got 12oz weight on it as it was only about 1/2"" thick. The temperature was medium is spots and well done in others. Really tasteless and not even a good char on it. The horseradish mashed potatoes were pretty good as was the wedge salad. Wife order the 1/2 slab and they tasted as though they were over-boiled or something. Really lacking flavor. If you want a good steak, go to Stubrik's in Fullerton, if you want good ribs, go to Lucilles. Sorry BJ's, won't come back again."
Bby S.,"Anaheim, CA",226,54,32,5.0,5/27/2013,pizza was bomb! beers are top notch! my fav is the Porter!
Nina Y.,"San Francisco, CA",671,1277,1718,3.0,1/6/2011,"Average. Average. Average. Maybe their beers and drinks are better. I came here after not being to BJ's since like elementary school so it's been like 10 years. I think I came here when I was like in 6th grade and I got a pizza or something. I don't really remember. So for my birthday lunch with one of my friends, I decided it was good to revisit it. The drinks looked good, and the menu of drinks was created by various BJ employees so that was pretty cool. We were able to see where they were from and what drink they created. Since I was driving, I thought it was a good idea not to drink. Instead, my friend and I each ordered our dishes and an appetizer to share.  Food: Spinach Artichoke Dip - It comes with these really good corn tortilla chips. The dip itself was really good too. Warm chips and delicious dip? That's my kind of appetizer.  Half Sandwich and Salad - this is one of their many lunch specials. I decided to go with the California Chicken Sandwich. The sandwich was too oily and buttery for me. The bread was fried and it gave it nice texture for a while, but after a while, it was just soggy. The avocado and chicken were nice. The salad was average, but decent. It also came with french fries - yum. They were amazing or anything, but it's been a while since I've had french fries so they were good.  Overall, I had a decent meal. I guess I'll be back if their happy hour deals are nice. AND to try their dessert."
Cathy M.,"Anaheim, CA",280,1133,1081,4.0,9/19/2011,"Today, my best friend and I came by for lunch! We ordered the Best Beginnings appetizer platter and it was amazing! It was huge, with mozarella sticks, avacado eggrolls, etc. It's enough for 3 people to share, therefore, it is the priciest appetizer on the whole menu. Aside from that, we ordered the half thin crust pizza and salad lunch combo. It was small, but enough to satisfy us. I recommend the Tomato Basil and Italian Sausage! After we finished, we ordered the Red Velvet Pizookie. The red velvet cake was a bit uncooked, because we could taste the dough...so asked for another Red Velvet Pizookie, but that one was a little less uncooked. Didn't make much of a difference, but it wasn't all too bad. I suppose we'll try a different Pizookie next time. Service can take a little while..."
