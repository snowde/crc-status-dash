B-House J.,"Anaheim, CA",0,11,1,2.0,5/28/2015,This happens everything I come here. The place is relatively empty (I have small kids so we eat early) but I still have to wait 15-20 minutes for a table. I don't know why I bother to come back.
P M.,"Orange, CA",72,106,36,1.0,12/19/2013,"BJ is good for dinning in but for Delivery their hot mess.  For holiday parties they shouldn't over book. My burger was cold, so were my fries. They should be more organized."
Bernie F.,"Fullerton, CA",1,3,,1.0,3/13/2014,Poor service!  We were served our orders but have to ask for plates and utensils. Have to ask for water and all. Ordered their pizookie dessert but took forever to serve.
Stephanie G.,"Fullerton, CA",15,20,3,5.0,2/17/2012,Went to the bar for happy hour. Jennifer and Jonathan were both taking care of us. Gave us great happy hour selections and were very prompt. Great service and were very helpful. Would definitely come back again for them!!! A+++ :) great place to start your Friday night! Bartender steph
Stephanie P.,"Pomona, CA",155,626,331,3.0,7/8/2011,"#151 Yet another chain in SoCal, so it's comes with the usual pluses and negatives.  + Extensive menu  + Reasonable prices + Delicious apps + Great crowds + Drink specials - Nothing that stands out  - Weak drinks - Detached bartenders - The same crowd over and over again This particular location is better than most since it's in Brea. But, it's not that much better than, say, Cheesecake Factory. It's our usual to-go location though when we're off to the movies in downtown Brea or if we're supposed to meet up with friends for a night out in Hollywood (we're from the Diamond Bar/Pomona area)."
Kingweasel X.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,34,,2.0,4/15/2012,"Here's some irony: We wanted pizza and went to BJ's, but after looking at the menu decided other, non-pizza-y stuff sounded way better. It was a busy Saturday afternoon and server Shaun was pleasant enough, though we both asked for iced tea and never received it. Instead getting ice water that was refilled in fits and starts from a half full carafe with no ice in it at all. His inability to hear us was matched only by ours to hear him, as he was incredibly soft spoken for the atmosphere in this place. $8.95 Potato skins? Haven't had any in ages once we realized how incredibly bad they are for someone to eat more than a sliver of them. I really liked the fried-ness of them. I didn't like the stinginess with which they doled out the cheese and bacon, though. Also, the monkey dishes they use for dipping sauce are WAY too small. $5.95 Clam chowder was tasty and a decent portion size as well. $3.50 Fried artichoke hearts were not too oily and tasted good. Great price since it was an add-on to an entrée. $12.75 Chicken fried steak was quite disappointing. The vegetable mix (baby carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, and squash) didn't really suit the dish. One decent sized dollop of their signature white cheddar mashed potatoes had two hamburger patty sized cfs's canted at an angle leaning on the mashed potatoes. A meager splash of thin pepper gravy was dropped on top of this. When I asked for extra gravy they server brought another one of those half ounce monkey dishes. Gee, thanks buddy. $17.50 Miso salmon dinner was a bright spot for the visit. The wife liked it more than a lot, although she did mention the rice bed it was on tasted like it came out of a cheap box.  All in all, it didn't really make me want to return any time soon. Maybe we will stick to pizza next time."
T S.,"Sedona, AZ",66,187,304,5.0,11/11/2011,"One of the few places that have a GF menu. Food was very good service a bit slow that day, but they were busy. I will be back."
jolie d.,"Fullerton, CA",66,65,35,5.0,4/8/2011,"oh how i love this place they have great lunch specials form 11-3 . 1/2 a sandwich with a salad or fries usually $7-$8 . . and there broccoli cheddar soup is amazingly cheesy.  when i go for dinner i always get the same thing avocado egg rolls,  med buffalo chicken pizza with no celery or onions. its to die for with an extra side of buffalo sauce and ranch .and of course a pazookie is a must.. double chocolate chip with vanilla ice cream"
Shari C.,"Anaheim, CA",20,13,9,1.0,2/5/2013,"Went to BJ's last night for dinner with my family of 4. Got there at 6;30pm, and it was not busy. Got seated quickly. We had a child w us, but the hostess neglected to give us a kid's menu. Server brought it to us. We ordered a medium BJ's favorite deep dish, small BBQ ck deep dish, and kid's pepperoni deep dish. Pizzas came out quickly!  We were pleasantly surprised. After we all had our pieces served, we took our first bite.  I noticed that my pizza was not hot. It was just warm. How could this be when they just brought it to the table? Told the server and he apologized and said it was weird because they were not busy. The  manager came over and offered to comp the pizza... That's not what we wanted, we were not complaining to get free stuff. We ordered desserts as well... Chocolate chip pizookie and a red velvet pizookie. These too, came out under baked!!  The red velvet one was still doughy and gooey.  The chocolate chip one was edible, but still didn't finish it. We spoke to the server abt this. He did take off the red velvet pizookie. It was awful.  When I go out to eat, I want to eat HOT food. That's why I gave this restaurant 1 star... Our food was not hot and cookie was not baked enough. I think that BJ's in Brea needs to have their oven checked to see if it is calibrated correctly. I will NOT be going back any time soon."
Dani W.,"Diamond Bar, CA",24,57,12,5.0,10/20/2013,"I ate at BJs this week and our server Diana was amazing. The food was decent, but I loved the red ale. Our server recommended it and I loved it! I would definitely come back and request Diana because I know she would take great care of me again."
Ashley W.,"Brookeville, MD",4,12,2,5.0,6/20/2011,"I've only been to this restaurant once, but it was a great experience. The pizza I ordered was delicious and their P.M. Porter beer was tasty! For dessert, the Pizookie was awesome!  Our server was nice and the food came out pretty quickly. I went around 10 at night, so it wasn't too busy.  I loved their atmosphere and I would definitely come back to this restaurant!!"
Angela A.,"Fullerton, CA",82,10,,3.0,2/10/2016,"service is horrible ! waited 20 minutes for a refill, busser girl threw our food on the table caus she didn't understand who's food went to who, just sucks over all."
Tammy N.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",1,61,,4.0,5/26/2011,"I only came for desserts I came for the pizookie trio and tried the red velvet, cookies and cream, and the triple chocolate.  My favorite was the cookies and cream, my brothers favorite was the triple chocolate. Each pizookie was about 4-5 inches across but i know the regular ones are a lot bigger.  Each pizookie was topped with a scoop of ice cream and whipped cream. The differences between the three is that the cookies and cream had vanilla ice cream with a cookies and cream whipped cream, the bottom is like a soft oreo cookie.  The triple chocolate has chocolate ice cream and a dark chocolate cookie part.  The red velved had little white chunks and i couldnt tell if it was white chocolate or nuts but they could have gone without it because it made it chewy. Service was okay, it took awhile to get the pizookie's out but our server was friendly."
Robin D.,"Anaheim, CA",0,6,,4.0,7/6/2012,"I come here whenever I'm craving a mouth watering pizooki! Generally by the time we get here we end up ordering food anyway. No matter how much I consider trying something new, I always end up ordering the shrimp scampi pasta. Its always reliably delicious and large enough portions for leftovers the next day.  Service has always been great. Waiters come to check on you often to refill and ask how everything tastes. If you're coming on a Friday or weekend night, be prepared to wait at least 15 min to be seated and 15 min for your food to come out.  Also, order your pazooki halfway through your meal so its ready by the time your done eating... YOU MUST GET THE PIZOOKI.  That being said, this is my favorite location. I love reliability!"
Arggie G.,"Fullerton, CA",8,7,,2.0,4/7/2013,"Ordered to go. we walked in to get our food, the guy left the"" to-go area"" as soon as we got infront of him, so we went to the front hostess, the girl was like its that one, pointing where we at before, so waited , waited...the guy came back and answered the ringing phone. after he was done, he said hell be right back at us, ok...maybe after 20 mins...we got our food. He got the food out from this fridge looking container, and didnt even bag it, so his like u ordered this and that right?!, ok we paid...2 other guys came, and the guy talked to them....still havent bagged our food...when he finally did, didnt even put any fork or knife, no napkins or anything, i guess...he knows we wont give him any tip, so no need for customer service effort."
Bryce P.,"Brea, CA",1,11,,5.0,8/31/2014,"Came here the other night to have dinner with my brother and his girlfriend. The waitress that we had was the best server we have had in a long time! She was so polite and friendly. And she had a great sense of humor too! I totally recommend Julie (Jewels). Anyone who wants a great waitress, ask for her! She's awesome!"
Dave S.,"South Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",357,247,11,3.0,12/26/2010,"Whatever.. it's Bj's Their food is alright, but over-priced in my opinion. Sometimes after eating their pizza I wish I'd have gotten a Dominoes $5.99 large. I'd enjoy it just the same and have an extra $20 in my wallet.  Their bar is always a good time, but really, there's better bars.  If you want average food at ""we gotta pay the rent"" prices then, ya, you're in the right spot."
H Q.,"Placentia, CA",153,715,1751,4.0,6/24/2011,"I came here with a friend for lunch. I've said before that I'm not that big a pizza guy as I was before, but I chose here over going to a burger joint which my friend is more apt to go to.  The restaurant, as is most of them in the mall area, was pretty busy for the lunch hour. We didn't have to wait long to be seated or have our order taken. The employees were efficient and nice.  We had the Sweet Pig Pizza, which is basically a Hawaiian Pizza. Before the pizza was brought to our table, the waiter brought us a card to rate the pizza because they were trying something different. I've had the Sweet Pig before, but that was awhile ago and when it was placed on the table and I had my first slice, I honestly can't say if it was any different. What I can say is that it was pretty good. The crust was really good. I liked the way it was rimmed with slightly burnt cheese. The toppings weren't too abundant, but were tasty. My friend liked how the pineapple wasn't overbearing. Overall a good experience and it was even better when my friend paid for it."
Rebecca S.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,4,,1.0,2/23/2014,"Went to this BJ's for a late night meal. Knowing they close at 12:00 a.m., my boyfriend and I were mindful to arrive 30 minutes before their closing time. The host greeted us about a minute after we walked in and advised us they had already done last call and they were no longer seating people. So, basically 30 minutes before the restaurant closed we were turned away! Hmm...wonder where the manager was on this one."
Jodie R.,"Brea, CA",0,3,,2.0,1/19/2015,"Very disappointed with the food.  Seems like their standards have lowered.  I got the broccoli cheddar soup and it tasted like a can of condensed soup and was as thick as that too.  My daughter got the chicken fettuccini pasta with broccoli.  Her broccoli looked and tasted microwaved.  Aside from the poor food, the customer service gets 5 stars."
