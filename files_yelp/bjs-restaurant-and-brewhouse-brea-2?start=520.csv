Daniel D.,"Anaheim, CA",7,6,,4.0,1/16/2014,"4 stars, why? Jambalaya. Amazing! Avocado rolls are magic as well. The beer? Decent, they brew a good pale ale and IPA. Wouldn't go for the beer alone."
Christy H.,"Glendora, CA",322,54,14,5.0,12/29/2012,"Excellent service!  Greeted at the front by a friendly hostess, seated right away, food was delicious!!!  The only complaint is that we were seated right by the bathrooms and the draft coming in from the outside patio was freezing, and inside the place was cold...but it was an unusually cold day in So. Cal 46 - besides eating with my jacket on, it was great!!!"
Stephanie H.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,119,93,3.0,9/21/2013,Stopped by here on the weekend for a late lunch. I was surprised we were seated right away. Appetizer platter was yummie and shareable between 3 people. The two of us snacked on it and there was so much food left. Drinks were stiff. Service was fast and friendly. I reccommend coming after 1pm.
Ernesto A.,"Riverside, CA",54,26,1,1.0,8/4/2013,Wow! I am so disappointed by my favorite restaurant. We were walked to 2 tables which were dirty and kept being escorted back to the waiting area. Our table did not have silverware. I ordered the chicken wontons and 1 out of the 3 had chicken inside. I ordered the same deep dish I've been ordering for 10 years and got a hand tossed pizza. My friend ordered pizza as well and it was returned because it was brought in to us on a dirty dish. We had to get up twice and approach the bar for refills. I can't express how disappointed I am. I will keep coming here however this place needs better service.
Lola M.,"La Habra, CA",0,3,,4.0,3/16/2015,This has become my go-to place for bar food and great light beer. I love the blonde and the Lightswitch. The staff seem to love being here and it sure makes a huge difference as far as service goes. Love the chicken wings extra crispy and the roasted beet salad minus all the goat stuff. Regular vinaigretteis better with it if you ask me. This location seems to be busy all the time especially during happy hours. Great beer with great friends almost weekly!!! Let's not forget the pizookie. Peanut butter is my favorite. Nom nom
Brenda K.,"Placentia, CA",0,2,,2.0,3/14/2015,"BJ's has been one of my favorite restaurants, but after today that has changed. We ordered the Barbecue chicken salad and it had no flavor at all. I requested NO tomatoes. It was covered with tomatoes. I ask for an extra plate to split the salad and the plate was so hot it was hard to handle. We had to ask for a cooler plate and the waiter said, ""Yeah it just came out of the washer""!  My son ordered spaghetti with meatballs. They came out with sauce and noodles and they told us they were out of meatballs. Three strikes, you are out!"
Jackie K.,"Orange County, CA",67,224,222,3.0,6/14/2011,"Nothing too special about this place. Their happy hour is OK..I don't like how their drinks are only $1 off during happy hour. I believe you get $2 off on shared appetizers, which isn't that great either..  I came here with friend during happy hour and ordered 4 drinks and 2 shareable appetizers (the thai? lettuce wraps and sliders; you get 4 each too)  total came out to ~$50 There are definitely other places that have better happy hours, which I would rather go to, but this one is convenient since it's right by Brea Mall. There are also a lot of TVs too for sports fans.  If you're coming for a birthday and tell your waiter/waitress they will bring out a pizookie! It comes with a candle too!"
Alina M.,"Los Angeles, CA",376,463,60,4.0,5/6/2011,I've been here about a million gajeelion times which pretty much comes with the territory if you go to school anywhere in the area and I'm always excited to go back because I know this place is solid and I'm gonna have a good time with my buddies. The berry cider is fantastic!  The barbecue chicken pizza with added bacon is my go-to order.  The service here is unobtrusive and there isn't any blaring music and so you can laugh it up like a fool and just relax and unwind. Never had a bad time here and so I know it's a great standby in the area.
RICARDO R.,"La Mirada, CA",1,30,1,3.0,12/18/2013,Not bad but not great either. The kids like to come here.   We ordered the BBC chicken pizza and it was good but nothing spectacular.. I have ordered other things here and learned to stick to the pizza.
Adriana Q.,"Fullerton, CA",91,87,65,4.0,6/7/2011,"LOVES: Pizookie (!!!) Jerry Burst (drink - mix of Jeremiah Red & Berry Burst Cider) Stuffed Mushrooms (mmmmmm!) Southwestern Eggrolls Buffalo Chicken Pizza BLT Flatbread DISLIKES:  When really busy, service is spotty. However, we have had a great serve here from time to time. Selection of beers is OK - not top notch like Yard House IN SUMMARY, We like this place, go here often and have not ever had a ""BAD"" experience. This shares the top spot on my bf and my list for ""go-to"" restaurants for eating out...it depends on what we're in the mood for."
Lauren M.,"Anaheim, CA",338,181,281,2.0,9/1/2010,"Mozzarella sticks were cold. Angus beef sliders are dry. Took 30 minutes for me to get my water, while my boyfriend never received his. I just had throat surgery, I NEED to stay hydrated, lady.  One star for service. One star for food I could have microwaved.  Not my favorite BJs."
Philip T.,"Fullerton, CA",5,99,,4.0,10/8/2014,After one of my ex good friend brought me here for lunch. Me and my mom has been a regular. So far i have came to this location for about 10 times. I never received a bad service. I had one problem with the one down at the OC outlet. I do like the BJ's home brew blonde beer. Very light and crisp. Always does the magic to make my day feels better. The food is decent. the portion is always just about to get me full.
Gayle W.,"La Habra, CA",2,2,,2.0,1/24/2015,Good is always good but we arrived at 730 and were told a 20 to 25 minute wait. My husband checked and was told he was 2 away. We are and now r on our way home at 1040p and t still waiting on our test. The front desk says the r sure they text us but it some times doesn't go thru. They wished us a good evening. Whatever system sucks! They didn't seem to care. They got our money.
Lady-Lourdes D.,"Walnut, CA",180,87,128,4.0,5/17/2011,"It's a chain restaurant, but I love BJ's.   We came here for lunch and we ordered the Avocado roll.  So darn good! The wrapper is not your typical eggroll wrapper or flour tortilla. It's a little  spicy, and it comes with their sweet and sour sauce.   We also ordered the clam chowder - never fails, I always find chunks of clams.  Its how a clam chowder should be (or at least how I like it) and not full of potatoes.   The special baked potato is huge - your choice of topping.  The seared Ahi and shrimp Thai lettuce wrap - BJ's version of it of course. Dessert never fails...mini Pizookie (no room for a regular one) with white chocolate macadamia topped with vanilla ice cream!"
Mike F.,"Placentia, CA",18,8,,1.0,12/16/2014,This is the third time in a row that I've been to this restaurant the food has been late the computer broke and they didn't even know how to bring up the bill and we had to sit and wait for almost 35 minutes just to get our bill an apology was all we Gott not even a complementary dessert or anything so I won't be back
Troy W.,"Cypress, CA",0,16,,3.0,1/19/2015,"I've been going to this BJ's for some time 5-6 years. Over the years the quality has declined! Tonight was a little more disappointing than the last! What went wrong is beside the point ( service was great). I spoke to the manager and pointed out the flaws! It seems corporate is running this very nice place into the ground! Please voice your opinion, I really like this place and the employees, but quality is #1!"
Alison B.,"Oceanside, CA",0,40,,2.0,1/19/2015,"Not a good night. Service was poor & the food disappointing. It was very busy and it appeared they were overwhelmed. The bacon cheeseburger my son had was very good, so were the fries. Try the wedge salad, I am hooked on it now."
Kim Chi P.,"Garden Grove, CA",309,108,7,1.0,11/12/2010,"Our waiter Christian was a douche. No smiles, no courtesy. ordered the lunch size pasta, angel hair toscana, and did not receive the soup or salad that came with it, even though we waited for eternity for our entrees. Grilled ham and cheese with tomato bisque was as good as ever for 7 dollars and the angel hair was delicious but the service was so terrible we will not be returning to this location. We will go somewhere else for our oatmeal raisin pizookie. Summary: food good. Lunch prices awesome. Waiter service despicable. GO TO A DIFFERENT LOCATION. I am not hesitant about this one star review.  the management needs to hire better servers.  When we walked in, the wait staff near the door acted unprofessionally, and did not give us a proper greeting. i'm sure all you other yelpers hate waiting, but i can't afford to.   is diabetic, and, to reiterate, one last time, we waited for SO LONG that his blood sugar dropped to the low 40's, which is very bad, considering 100 is his general target."
Anamarie T.,"Mission Viejo, CA",32,109,26,5.0,10/11/2013,"This place is ALWAYS busy at nigh especially weekends.  The food is good, although a little noisy, great fun atmosphere.  OF course the beer is what they are known for, but I do not drink it so lets talk about the dessert.  The pizookie is AMAZING! and the brownie sundae is to die for too (MY FAV).  This place is a great place after a long hard day shopping at the mall."
Rilo H.,"Anaheim, CA",4,11,,1.0,12/17/2013,"I like BJ's. I dont know what it is about this location, but the pizza always tastes like a combo of cold, dry, and bland. Last time I was there the beer that I had tasted very odd, and vaguely like soap. Other than that the service was pure, uncut, horsep*ss. My waitress paid no attention to me despite me being practically the only guest there meaning she never checked on me outside of when she absolutely had to to take orders/bring food. I hope this place falls off the face of the earth! Failing that, I wont be coming back."
