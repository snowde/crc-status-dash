Nathan A.,"Santa Ana, CA",84,148,90,4.0,5/5/2013,There are only two things that need to be ordered at BJs. First is the house made root beer and second is the bacon cheese burger pizza. These are the two best things on the menu and they will not disappoint.
Geoff O.,"Alexandria, VA",49,197,2,4.0,2/16/2011,"I've been a fan of BJ's ever since it opened back in the 90s. There's nothing particularly noteworthy about it, but BJ's offers solid food at a good value. I think that;'s one of the best things about it - management has smartly weathered the recession by keeping prices comparatively low (plenty of entrees for under $10) and quality up. Service has generally been good and attentive at this location. Like anything, some servers are better than others, but most seem to strive to be on the ball and communicative with patrons. Happy hour is a great deal here. I don't even drink, but soda is half off and appetizers are either half or $2 off. You can really make a killing if you swing by there for either happy hour (there's the typical post-work, pre-dinner one, and another that starts at 10). Two appetizers, drinks, and even a pizookie will barely set you back more than $20.  The place goes bonkers, though, during busy hours and weekends, so be advised. Wait times can be absurd. It's also a louder, rowdier sort of place, so keep that in mind if you are taking anyone who's hard of hearing."
Krystal R.,"Anaheim, CA",209,188,198,4.0,8/2/2010,"There are lots of tasty and wonderful reasons why I love BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse.  It's a chain restaurant that I don't mind visiting every now and then. I've frequented this location many times, and my husband and I even hosted our wedding rehearsal dinner here. On this occasion, we were out having a late dinner with our fave couple, Adrian and Monica. There are a couple must haves' on the menu that are pretty darn delicious: Starters- BEER! It's a brewhouse - you gotta have a beer with your meal!! BJ's Brewhouse blonde is a great choice for those who like something light and refreshing with a slight touch of hoppiness. My husband prefers hoppy beers - something with a little tang to it and he would order either the Jeremiah Red or Piranha pale ale. They both have big bold flavors and very high alcohol content. However my number one choice since I'm not a beer aficionado - I always order the berry burst cider blend with beer - it's a beautiful blend of beer and mixed berries - it's so refreshing to drink. It's better than pear cider! Appetizers - My number one pick is avocado egg rolls and Bruschetta. Inside the eggroll is a delicious pairing of cream cheese and avocado with some spices. It  almost tastes like an avocado butter with the cream cheese. The filling pairs well with the crispy wonton shells and the sweet and spicy tamarind dipping sauce is mouthwatering delicious. This is truly an APP-TEASER!!! Our main entrée for the four of us was easy decision - PIZZA! They have a great selection of signature deep dish pizzas and we quickly picked the Southwestern pizza. The description and picture sold us immediately ""chipotle tomato sauce with spicy blackened chicken, green chiles, cheddar cheese and diced tomatoes with fresh cilantro."" Yum and YUUUUUUM. Monica and I like to plan ahead for dessert, since a pizookie is one of our favorite desserts here. It's one of the main reasons we visit!! We decided a smaller size pizza - the medium would be perfect fit for us - anything bigger - we would stuff our faces silly with pizza.  Southwestern pizza was a tad spicer than I thought it would be, but it was still delicious. It had a great combination of flavors that melded together beautifully on a pizza. I don't know if was the spicy chicken or the chipotle spice sauce that made my mouth on fire. Make sure to have a couple glasses of water on the side just in case if it's too spicy for you.  And of course, we got our desserts....the PIZOOKIE. It's a pizza shaped cookie made in a mini pizza pan and it's freshly baked with two big scoops of vanilla ice cream. Eric and I love the traditional flavors of the oatmeal-raisin walnut cookie and Monica and Adrian got the ooey-gooey cookies and cream pizookie. It truly completes the glorious meal to a perfect tee. Beer, pizza and pizookie...definitely a great dinner with great friends."
Rosa R.,"La Habra, CA",95,8,1,1.0,11/9/2014,"We came to this restaurant for our first time thinking it would be a great place to dine in by the location it's at, but it was the complete opposite. The service was terrible, the waitresses seemed to be lost and out of place. They took our order, but they took awhile to serve us"
Samantha L.,"San Francisco, CA",676,953,2057,3.0,4/10/2010,They were advertising their new Oasis beer on tap.  I'm a sucker for any restaurants little ads so I ordered it and actually enjoyed it. Now I have another beer on tap option other than the hefeweizen!  I only ever choose to come to BJ's for their lunch specials. Their pizza and salad lunch deal is hard to beat. It's a personal deep dish pizza with one topping plus a salad of your choice for a great price. I had a pepperoni and mushroom pizza that came out with that extra crispy cheese on the crust from the oven. It's the perfect sized meal and they're more than willing to give you a cup of ranch if you ask!
Sarah S.,"Yorba Linda, CA",24,125,17,4.0,4/10/2011,"One thing I have to say... be careful of how many drinks you order! The Strawberry Confusion (my favorite) is $9.50 per, and I can easily order two... which will definitely run up your bill. Food is pretty good, nothing ground breaking and definitely good enough to make me want to return. Salads are HUGE, pizzas are a good amount to eat, balsamic glazed chicken is pretty good (sometimes the chicken can be a little dry), California Chicken Sandwich is good as well. Jambalaya is good but is also around $16!  I think my main complaint is that the food is a little more on the pricey side, but it has a good ambience and has large TVs (and many of them). Can be a little loud so don't go if you want to enjoy the company of your date quietly. It's a more comfortable (and well lit) Cheesecake Factory - good for groups, though the wait can be a little long sometimes.  Beer snobs may not like this place for their brews... I don't drink beer though, and am only repeating the comment that I've heard a few times from a few friends. Most people enjoy the beers here though, so don't let that stop you from trying some.  Even if you're not particularly hungry, be sure to get a pizookie (pizza cookie... served warm from the oven with a scoop of ice cream). Also tried their beignet, it's pretty good, though it's hard for me to pick that over a pizookie."
Jeremy M.,"Chattanooga, TN",409,359,67,3.0,1/12/2011,"Ya, it's a chain. BUT, it's a chain with good deep dish pizza and craft brewed beers!  Worth a stop."
Jan L.,"Fullerton, CA",185,49,,2.0,10/1/2010,"I don't drink beer and was just looking for a good pizza. Came here a couple of times in the past, but on my last visit (last week) I came specifically to evaluate the pizza...BJ's is not the best nor the biggest - and overpriced.  First off, the CRUST is airy and puffy. I personally prefer substantive, doughy, chewy crust - sort of like good bread...not airy, puffy and light. If that's your thing, then I suppose BJ's is right for you. I think this place tries to model their pizza's after Chicago style...I just decided I don't like this style.  Hey, but that's just my opinion. Hey, anyone out there know of a good pizza with the kind of crust I'm speaking about? So, taken all those things together - not a great value, took a long time to come out, overpriced, wrong kind of dough - I won't be coming back here for a long time."
Lynn J.,"Anaheim, CA",81,285,41,4.0,1/15/2011,"BJ's Pizza is always yummy! The service is what makes the difference in locations. This location seems to always have great service and a wait team that actually seems to enjoy what they do and enjoy working together. Makes a big difference in my dining experience. Just steer clear on game days, the drunken patrons hitting on the waitresses makes service a bit slow. BJ's favorite is the pizza that constantly beckons me and I never am disappointed. Crust is thick and cooked perfectly crisp, cheese is melted and gooey, not too saucy, and plenty of toppings. I need to use a fork and knife for this pizza experience, but I am okay with that because it keeps my pizza slices to a total of two. It is so filling and I have plenty of leftovers for later. With their many home brews offered, I always guaranteed to leave completely satisfied."
Robert K.,"Fullerton, CA",11,4,,4.0,11/18/2012,"Here to celebrate my mom's bday.  I ordered the calamari as an appetizer and it was nice and crispy. More to follow.. we got a large deep dish pizza, forgot what kind it was but It was good. Expensive.  And then they gave my mom a Pazooki for her bday."
Jessica K.,"New York, NY",327,997,485,3.0,12/25/2010,"Not too fond of the food here. But the dessert is good. Try the pazookie. It's basically a huge cookie with ice-cream on top. You can share one amongst ten people, no joke. It gets so sweet that it is shareable with ten."
Kristine W.,"Seattle, WA",133,659,153,3.0,3/27/2008,"I used to come here all the time in college since I went to CSU Fullerton down the street.  As a matter of fact, I spent my 24th birthday dinner here with my friends.  I know it's a chain, but it's a still a cool place to kick it with friends.   I went here last night with a friend for happy hour.  Their =) hour isn't too bad. My friend and I both had two beers and two appetizers and it came out to $35 including tip.  Not too shabby. I did get tipsy after two beers.  What's wrong with me? Geez, I blame that on the fact I only had an apple in the a.m. and a granola bar for lunch. I give this place 3 stars only because sometimes the service is meh, but the food is good."
Amy B.,"Upland, CA",0,32,14,5.0,8/9/2011,"BJ's is famous for their pizza, and rightly so. The Chicago style deep dish crust is delicious. My favorite is their Mediterranean pizza, which has feta cheese, grilled chicken, kilamata olives, and pepperonchinis.  They are so willing to customize your order, and you can take off and add things at your leisure. They let me customize the hell out of a sandwich once and got it just right! The service for me here has always been impecable. I've been coming to this location for a few years, and I'm always greeted warmly and felt taken care of. They get extremely busy, but you can see the staff working as a team. If there's ever a long wait you can head up to the bar and find an open table, it's full menu. If you go save room for pizookie! It's the best part. Last time I went they had a new Red Velvet pizookie, which was AMAZING. As far as chain restaurants go, this is one of the better locations. The building used to be a brewery called Magnolia's Peach, and it still has frosted glass peaches on the windows. If you're in the Brea area, I definitely recommend it."
Tiffany S.,"Tustin, CA",27,41,,4.0,4/21/2011,"I never really had a bad experience here, so I'm happy and they have some really nice waiters at this location, so that's some extra points for them! anyways, love avocado eggrolls! my roommate got me hooked on them, so now (almost every time) I get them. and honestly, never had a bad food experience here, so no complaints beer-wise: I like the honey blonde and they have this berry cider which is really delicious (especially good for girls who don't really like beer or beginner-drinkers)"
Lynda T.,"Yorba Linda, CA",59,160,152,4.0,4/18/2013,"Been here twice. Love their buffalo chicken pizza but service sucks. Got lots of people running around doing nothing!! So if you are not in a hurry, this place serves really delicious foods but expect to wait a while til the server waits on you, especially during dinner. Best buffalo chicken pizza though so I have to go back!!!"
Aaron G.,"Anaheim, CA",159,37,,4.0,8/25/2012,"Been going to this BJ's for years, since the 1990's back during my days at CSUF when happy hour consisted of $2 beers and the only selection was their own brews.  Times have changed but its still a solid spot to enjoy some beer and pizza.  The beer selection has drastically expanded and I have never had an issue with the service at this location.  If you are on a diet, this probably isn't the place for you but its a good spot to throw down a few while the girlfriend shops at the mall."
Angela L.,"Walnut, CA",8,25,,4.0,5/21/2011,"Went here last week with friends for the first time and... like it! The service was good, we only waited for around 10 minutes which was not a long time, considering how many people were there for dinner before prom. The food was also served pretty quickly. I ordered the flatbread pizza and my friends order burgers and pasta. We shared the Strawberry bread thing for dessert and loooved it! Would definitely come back again, a good experience."
L. P. M.,"Orange County, CA",4,208,1,2.0,2/23/2011,"When this location opened in the old Magnolia's Peach, it was a great place to go.  The deep-dish pizza rivaled Numero Uno, then across the street, but wasn't quite as good as BJ's in Balboa.  Maybe the ocean air added to the flavor in Balboa?  Added that they brewed their own beer on-site, as this was a great place to go, hang out, watch sports, listen to music, eat too much pizza and drink beer.  In homage to Magnolia's Peach, they offered Magnolia Peach, a you guessed it, peach flavored beer. Through the years, BJ's has added too many items to the menu, gotten away from making great pizza, and no longer brews their own beer.  Always a sure hit, their Piranha Pale Ale, is now another macro-brew tasting ale.  It misses the mark totally.  Same as the Double-Double pizza.  We used to come here for the brewery tours and beer tastings, now no longer available.  I still have a couple clear glass growlers in the garage from the days when they brewed on-site. In all, BJ's has lost step with what made them a local favorite in favor of expanding into another chain offering generic, bland food to the masses. Please bring back Magnolia's Peach with the 'unsafe' revolving front door and gas lamps in the bar.  You are missed but not forgotten."
Joseph W.,"Anaheim, CA",17,63,1,4.0,4/22/2013,Great craft beers and pizza selection.  The root beer is awesome and wonderful food menu.  Keep up the great work guys.
Carrie D.,"Littleton, CO",156,336,10,4.0,12/16/2010,"I'm a fan of BJ's already. We visit the one in Cupertino whenever we can. I really like the pizza, but when I visited this BJ's, i was with a large group of people from Chicago. Let's just say they did not agree that BJ's pizza was Chicago Style.  But regardless, it was tastey. We had a group of like 12 people and I think they did a great job of serving us and keep ing everyone's orders straight. Overall, it was a good experience for me here, so I'm still a fan!"
