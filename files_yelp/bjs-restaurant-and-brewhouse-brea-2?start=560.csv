John C.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",4,18,4,2.0,6/20/2013,I love BJ's and go quite regularly but this one I am disappointed in. The dishes for our appetizers were dirty and the olive oil had floaters of some sort. This is not the typical BJ's!
Jody B.,"Westminster, CA",1,45,2,5.0,11/5/2013,This place is always busy during the prime eating hours.  The service always is good.  The staff seem to help clear plates even if it is not their table.  The small  bbq chicken pizza is good on the menu and big enough still to share with another small eater.
Rachel L.,"Orange, CA",49,41,30,4.0,1/19/2011,"Went here the other night for dinner and it was great. I mean this isn't my first time going to BJ's I've definitely eaten here 100 times before, but for someone reason this particular time was beyond excellent.  Our waiter was outstanding. He was easy to talk to and really personable. He checked up on us at all the right times even though he had a couple other big parties he was attending to. Our food took a little bit to long to come out, especially for not ordering anything complicated, but out waiter refilled our drinks and kept us generally ok while we waited.    I ordered the angel hair toscana without cheese and added artichoke hearts and extra pine nuts, and let me tell you it was delicious! I don't know if it was my starvation from waiting so long for my food or eating so late at night but my pasta was perfect and i practically inhaled it without even chewing.  The only down side is how loud it is in there! Sometimes it gets hard to carry a conversation while eating because the echo of all the drunk people screaming.  Also, if you order their home brewed root beer (yumm) know that if you want ice in it, you have to request it. It comes without automatically and is all warm and gets fizzy in your mouth when you try to drink it."
O V.,"Pasadena, CA",22,53,11,3.0,1/7/2013,The blue-cheese burger was delicious. Not anything different or special than all the other BJ's.
Eleanor A.,"Yorba Linda, CA",0,37,,3.0,9/13/2010,"The only thing here that makes my mouth water is the pizookie. Incase you aren't familiar with what this is, let me explain. Pizookie is created by taking chocolate chip cookie dough and baking it in a mini deep dish pizza pan. Once it is baked, scoops of tasty vanilla ice cream is placed on top of the warm, chewy chocolate chip cookie. *drools* My only complaint is that it's not bottomless :) Other than that, the pizza is alright, and the onion ring appetizer is equally alright. Nothing on the menu (other than the Pizookie, of course) makes me wanna do cartwheels by any means."
Julie T.,"Lakewood, CA",110,224,5,4.0,1/31/2010,"Went today for lunch with a large group, and everything was really good - service, food, atmosphere (we sat outside, beautiful day, flat screen TV hung for our viewing pleasure).  I had the BBQ chicken chopped salad (half), and was very pleased.  Hub had the California burger, and was a happy man (yes, I tried it, and it was most excellent, I thought).  We also had the combo appetizer, calamari, and a pizuki (sp?), most delicious, all.  Good solid eats here, and the service is of a high quality; I would definitely come back and do it again."
Katie Y.,"Fullerton, CA",36,37,8,3.0,11/10/2012,"I love the Great White Pizza here and when they have their 2 for 20 special going on you can't beat that deal!  However, I am SUPER UNHAPPY that they no longer carry the oatmeal raisin pazookie! It was my absolute favorite! :( They apparently replaced it with a white chocolate raspberry almond pazookie? They already have white chocolate macadamia nut. I would think you would only offer one of those two since they seem similar and keep oatmeal! BRING THE OATMEAL RAISIN PAZOOKIE BACK!! I don't think I will come back unless it was during the 2 for $20 special now."
Emmy L.,"Anaheim, CA",2,21,,3.0,6/23/2012,"I came here today with my mom and sister and my server was Michael. This was my first time coming but the service was excellent. He came by often to check up on us and was friendly. The hostesses greet us nicely and the wait on a Friday night was surprisingly not too long! But the food took a loooong time to come out. For appetizers, we got the Chicken Pot Stickers which were blaaaaand, even with the sauce. I could honestly make better dumplings at home.  For entrees, I got the Tuscan Chicken Limone. I was surprised how little the portion was when it said it was 1560 calories! I initially thought the lemon-butter sauce would be a light drizzle or was not a thick sauce, but it's extremely thick has no scent of lemon or butter and just seemed like it consisted of only cream. It came with angel hair pasta and four pieces of garlic bread. I couldn't even finish it just knowing that average size portion dish was over 1000 calories.... Unbelievable. The taste of it was a little bland and creamy, no salt, but the chicken was nice and juicy! My mom got the Hawaiian Mahi-Mahi, I believe. It was a little bit on the dry side and the rice pilaf was extremely sweet. My sister got a hamburger and fries, which was extremely large. The fries were thin and delicious!  For dessert, we ordered BJ's Famous Pizookie, which was okay. The cookie is sooo sweet and gooey, but the ice cream was delicious! It's not a memorable dessert, which it claims to be, but it's fun to share with friends or family. Overall, I had a nice first experience at BJ's. The service was excellent but the food was not the best I ever had at a franchise. Food was okay, not great"
Rohit K.,"New York, NY",26,79,5,4.0,9/12/2010,"I've been going to BJ's for their pizza for years. Their house brewed Hef goes very well with their deep dish Chicago style pizza. The barbeque chicken and the buffalo chicken pizza's are my two favorite pizza's here. I've also eaten a few sandwiches here over time, and those were pretty good too.  The Pizookie is easily their best item on the menu. It's hard for one person to eat one whole Pizookie; there's just too much sugar in that thing.  There's usually a long wait here during dinner times, and during game days. They have TV's EVERYWHERE!"

SteveH H.,"Buena Park, CA",0,48,,3.0,9/16/2013,"It's a good deal, if you go for meal for 2.  For happy hours, it's better at Yard House.  BJ's happy hour is pretty lame.  You have to sit at the bar to get the discount prices & the portion is smaller too. The greeter does not know the happy hour menu.  The waitress does not remember what's on the happy hour menu, and their menu does not even mention it as well. Next time, I will head to Yard House for the happy hour, where I will be truly happy :)"
Anita C.,"Chino, CA",82,22,5,1.0,4/16/2014,"Working 5 minutes away from the mall, BJ's has always been a very popular lunch choice for my coworkers and I.  While usually our visits are enjoyable and pleasant, this one was far from such.  Upon arriving at 12:07, we were not greeted by our server Andrew until 12:18.  He passed out our menus and came back at 12:30 to take our order.  We ordered soup and salads off the lunch menu (one of us ordered a half sandwich and salad).  We received our salads at approx 12:35...as we finished our salads, we continued to wait for our soups and half of a sandwich which never came.  Nor did our server.  I approached the bar and asked the bartender to get a manager for me.  When the manager (Ryan) arrived, I explained what had happened and he responded with just:  ""I'm sorry"".  Although he did take care of food portion of the bill, his lack of any further customer service is atrocious.  Furthermore, once the bill was paid for the one drink that was ordered, our server Andrew returned and made a comment stating that next time, if we are in a hurry, we have the option to ""call ahead"" so our food is ready.  So apparently, it is our fault for choosing to eat at BJ's restaurant for our hour long lunch hour.  Due to the lack of service and food, I had to call our boss and explain that we would be late back to work because we were going to have to stop at Subway to be able to grab something to eat!  I am extremely disappointed with my experience today and hope that something is done so that further patrons do not experience the same thing.  I have forwarded my concerns to the corporate office as well."
Jasmine W.,"South Pasadena, CA",134,947,35,3.0,1/26/2010,"a clean, familiar, chill place to catch up with friends and just hang out. met up with my sis yesterday night and we had a late dinner at the bar. service was great - took good care of us balanced with letting us catch up and gossip. i wanted to try their home-brewed orange cream soda but they only had a special flavor - black cherry - available. taste reminded me of mr. pibb and i appreciated the complimentary refills. my sis had the strawberry lemonade (and also took advantage of unlimited refills) and we had the shrimp jambalaya (tasty with lots of shrimp and a good, balanced kick of spice), california turkey burger with thin fries (loved the avocado but preferred the jambalaya), and topped it all off with a white chocolate macadamian pizookie... fresh from the oven and perfectly complimenting the two scoops of vanilla ice cream! happy hour prices available 3-7pm and then after 10pm sun-thurs with drink specials during NFL games."
Brian S.,"Brea, CA",17,117,20,4.0,2/6/2011,In general I like BJ's. The food is always delicious and the staff is pretty good. I haven't had a bad meal here yet. Make sure you try the Pizzookie for dessert.
Ryan C.,"Pomona, CA",5,44,2,4.0,12/19/2010,"Another great lunch with my wife here.. on a rainy day.. We were served by Amanda and she was great.  Very friendly, helpful and extremely attentive.  The gift card idea she offered even got us a set of 4 BJ Pint glasses for free. Food was very good.  We've ordered unlimited soup and salad, normally not on the weekend menu, but Amanda said ""BJ never says no!"". Great!  Clam Chowder and Tomato Bisque.  Very good.  Caesar salad.. well, it could've been better with a bit light on the dressing. Their Jambalaya was also very good.  A bit salty, but as expected with Jambalaya.. could've asked for more rice but we were full already anyway. Great food and service on a busy rainy day..  Walked out with plenty left-overs and smile on our faces. We will definitely be back there very soon."
Kimberly T.,"Anaheim, CA",217,78,139,4.0,9/26/2010,"So I agree with the review below mine (Hi Troy! Class of 2004!) where this is an easy place to go to, but not necessarily a great one. It's great for groups or parties because they have a lot of tables, both inside and out. My pros outweigh the cons, but I'll start with the cons: -Sucky service! The waiters are so slow! They only good thing they do is that they cut your pizza for you. -The BJ's parking lot isn't so big. And you're constantly fighting with the Cheesecake customers for parking, whether it's in the restaurants' lot or in the mall lot. -The amount of people that are crowding each other waiting to be seated. The pros: -Awesome pizza! My sister, friends and I love the BBQ Chicken Pizza. I've tried others, and they're just as yummy :) -Their BBQ items are really good. Their BBQ salad is really good, along with the burgers/sandwiches. -PIZOOKIES!!! -The remotes that they give you that beep and turn red when it's your turn to be seated. I'm running out of pros and cons, but basically, this place is a good place to eat when you're undecided. It's a good go-to restaurant that's affordable, which pretty decent food. The servers are a hit or miss, so hopefully you get a good one. If you're a first-timer, get a pizza :)"
Melody K.,"Long Beach, CA",32,52,16,4.0,9/18/2010,"I have been coming here for years.  You can't come here without getting one of their deep dish pizzas and the Pizookie.  Even better if you come here with a big enough group to get the party platter pizookie, a giant cookie topped with vanilla ice cream the size of a pizza. I always come here if I'm looking to catch a game in Brea because they have plenty of TVs."
Curtis L.,"Coronado, CA",58,73,238,4.0,2/12/2010,"I Love BJ's Fish Tacos! I met up at BJ's in Brea with my homies from back in the day. I've been there a few times before and didn't expect much as far as the food or service goes. I was expecting average service and a TGIF-ish ambiance.  But let me tell you something, our server was THE man. Friendly, FAST, and helpful. Just all around great service. We stayed until the place closed but the staff didn't rush us. They were polite the entire time. I had the fish tacos and a stout. I was starving so my judgement may have been skewed  but I'm sure they were close to amazing. Best fish tacos I've had in more than a year. Easy. It's probably different on the weekend, but we went on a Thursday night so the ambiance was mostly family. There were some high chairs and gray hairs. No loud music. Wasn't expecting much from this place, but I'm giving four stars because our server over delivered. I would visit again."
Andrew S.,"Orange, CA",146,18,,4.0,12/30/2011,"I've been to this place about 3 or 4 times now, and my star rating is in between 3 or 4. But I'm a nice guy and I give it 4. :P The staff and service is always quick and prompt. I ate here yesterday and we had a really big party. Around 15 or 18 I think? Each time we were running low on drinks they were always fast to refill em' up without us even asking. We had a lot of people come in late but the waiters were really good about it and they knew which people just walked in and everything. The only thing that was a bit odd was that the waiters weren't as friendly as usual. They seemed very ""business-bee"" and they were like, ""What do you want? Do do you want soup or salad on the side? Okay."" And they were off. But that doesn't bother me too much. The food experience will differ however. They have a very very large menu for a restaurant. I don't think I've come across a menu that large before. Its 14 pages long! My goodness! Its so hard to pick something because there's so many damn things! I spent 10 minutes figuring out what to get. Normally their pizzas are always on the mark. Its always hot and full of flavor. The bread and crust were AMAZING. It wasn't too soft and it wasn't too hard. It just had the right amount of bite to it. And no matter which pizza you get, based on what I've had, I'm confident that they'll satisfy you. Some of their other things are okay. Like their New Orleans Jambalaya, that was not what I expected to be. It was definitely under seasoned and it was missing that spicy kick to it. It tasted very meh, too much of tomatoes. Definitely needed more paprika and cayenne. It was not worth $15. I also tried their balsamic glazed chicken, that wasn't bad either. The chicken definitely need more salt and pepper, but that's what the salt and pepper shakers are for. It also definitely needed some more of that balsamic glaze. It was a small amount of sauce they put with it! As for their pazookies, don't even get me started. You will always enjoy the pazookie if you're in the mood for something fattening and sweet. So in short, food here is good, you will be content with it. Its just that the higher calorie foods taste a lot better. LOL."
Cupcake V.,"Anaheim, CA",57,110,40,4.0,3/29/2010,"4 Stars:  just good food. I like their chopped BBQ chicken salad and the new proscuitto & artichoke flat bread pizza. The sliders and deep dish pizzas are a big hit with my boys. The service is usually friendly and helpful. I've never been in a BJ's that wasn't clean.  Who am I kidding? It's really the pizookies that keep us coming back. 5 sugar-lovin' stars just for the warm, delicious chocolate chunk cookies with rich vanilla ice cream melting on top! Gotta love 'em!"
