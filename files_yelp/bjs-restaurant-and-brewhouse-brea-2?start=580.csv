Jason W.,"Costa Mesa, CA",67,16,,4.0,9/17/2014,"The food here is generally always great. Some of the wait staff is good, some of them are not. I'm never really expecting the best from a place with that many TVs. I will say the noise level is always absurdly loud."
Esther A.,"San Francisco, CA",645,1160,406,5.0,5/30/2006,"Haven't yet tried any of the locations in the bay area but I really liked this place. Had the medium deep dish pizza and for 3 people, it was totally sufficient. Yummy! =) No wait and the service staff was very accomodating. =) Next time I'll try the pizookie."
Andrew L.,"Santa Ana, CA",36,7,,2.0,12/13/2011,"I've been to this location time and time again, but lately (past year) I've seen it get progressively worse. Within the last year I have been to this location about six times and each time I left unsatisfied. I typically get the pizzas because they are usually delicious, crispy on the outside, moist on the inside. Lately, whenever I get the pizzas they either have very little toppings on them, almost as if I'm eating a cheese pizza or they are dry and warm on the verge of room temperature.  I actually just went there tonight, and my pizza was as described above. My girlfriend ordered the seared ahi salad, substituted with raw ahi poke tuna rather than seared and received what was expected, however the tuna was old, dry and very pale in color.  Now as for the service. The execution of customer service was on the verge of minimal standards. We sat at the bar tables, took us almost 20 minutes before even being asked for drinks. I ordered the hand crafted root beer which by quality standards of other BJ's that I have been to typically comes in a nice frosty mug, this time it came in a room temperature mug and no ice. However, when she refilled it, it came in a nice frosty mug and very cold. When receiving my dish I was not offered or given Parmesan and crushed pepper for my pizza. I had already been through my first slice when the waitress was collecting dishes from the table behind me, grabbed the cheese and pepper from the table then offered it to me. I may be going a little extreme about this part but it rubbed me the wrong way. Then as we were barely half way through our dishes the waitress came and asked if we wanted dessert we declined and she decided to leave the check for us. A little prematurely in my opinion, but maybe that's just me. We finished eating, she took my card and when she came back, placed the check, and said the usually ""thanks and have a good night"" etc, but she said it as she was walking away without making any eye contact.  Maybe I'm expecting too much or maybe I'm just used to the service I get at the other BJ's. BJ's isn't a bad place, i love the Harvest Hef, pizzas and pazookies, but this location just does not cut it for me. I would rather drive the extra miles to go to the Huntington Beach location off the 405, that place has never steered me wrong. I have been to that one every Tuesday night for the past 4 months."
Celina L.,"Placentia, CA",82,73,12,5.0,7/30/2012,"You get what you pay for.  Service was excellent, drinks were strong, and food was your average bar/grill eats.  5 stars because of the service. I was super happy for how the hostess kept offering water or for us to set at the bar and giving us updates on when the table would be ready. (we didn't make reservations so we had to wait) and for it being a large party, we didn't have to wait that long to get our food."
Carlos U.,"Santa Fe Springs, CA",33,138,53,2.0,2/24/2012,"I love me some Bj's!! But I have to say I hated the service here.  I've tried this location three times and out 2 out of 3 times i have been here it seems like the waitors take a very long time to do anything.  They always give us the excuse that they are understaffed or have to cover the bar for some reason.  I also ordered a ""Giant"" baked potato...That thing was the same size as the ones I make at home and with a $9 price tag...It was disapointing also because I have ordered the baked potato at other BJ's and those are huge!...should have complained but I just wanted out."
Jay L.,"San Diego, CA",92,220,19,1.0,10/30/2009,"I've tried Derek's Favorite Meatloaf, and I WAS TOTALLY RIPPED OFF... The meal included a SALAD but the server, Greg, (yes I remembered his name) he didn't take note of it. Not to mention I wasn't even wearing revealing clothes but I didn't like the way he looked at me :(... I didn't feel comfortable there. I just remembered that I had a salad included, what was even worse was that the meatloaf was BLAND and my girlfriend told me to send it back, but this will be my first time, and last time eating at any BJ's. I refuse to give business to this establishment. Frankly I could've even made better meatloaf for practically half the price. I feel like this place is obnoxious and overpriced, the group of college kids sitting near us just made the experience even better. EDIT**: I forgot to mention that I also received a prize hair in the meatloaf, hows that for salting the wound?"
Lauren S.,"Glendora, CA",0,6,,4.0,6/18/2013,This is my favorite restaurant of all time! Great location and the grilled chicken pasta is incredible.
Jonathan H.,"Anaheim, CA",64,172,8,3.0,4/17/2010,"The food was alright, and the service was ok as well. I wouldn't go here often though. Ok so let's start. Umm I had a bit of the grilled chicken pasta. That was a big no-no. Very dry chicken. And I mean very dry like it had been left out in the desert for a couple days. Appetizers were great. I had calamari and the potato skin plate. I also had a medium pizza with mushrooms and pepperoni. It was decent. It could've used some more tomato sauce. There was almost none on it. The highlight of this place is definitely their pizookies. Delicious and sweet dessert. But it should be renamed Diabetes on a Plate. So bad for you, but so so good. The environment can be summed up in one word. Chaos. People all over the place in a super cramped restaurant. Not really my type of environment. The service was alright though. Our waiter was at times M.I.A. but he was helpful when nearby. Overall, 3 stars."
Vanessa F.,"Anaheim, CA",78,10,3,4.0,1/19/2011,"It's def not my first time at BJ's and it most def won't be my last. First and foremost their happy hour is FANTASTICO. They have a great selection of food and drinks at great prices. The service varies by location i'm sure, well more like by visit to be honest. It's a great place to meet up with friends in small or large groups. The deep dish pizzas are to die for but if you are looking for something lighter the salads are yummy as well. Quick tip: If you come with a large group it's easier to have the server split by person. It's become easier to split and it helps the confusion. Friday and Saturday nights can get quite busy so try making a reservation or have part of your party show a bit earlier.  Many of the portions are large enough to share but there are a few new mini meals that have been introduced to the menu."
Matt V.,"Temecula, CA",21,502,32,4.0,5/5/2010,"I will go to BJ's anytime anyone suggests it, or when I'm in the mood for a really fresh-tasting, special pizza. The delivery chains can't touch BJ's pizza. I usually order a sausage and garlic with some fresh chopped basil sprinkled on top just before serving. The beers are okay and the atmosphere a bit on the noisy side, but I will put up with high sound levels from the TVs, sound system and other patrons when I'm jones-ing for that delish ZZZzzaaaa!!"
Aaron Z.,"Yorba Linda, CA",739,46,90,4.0,9/9/2012,"BJs Restaurant in Brea CA at the Brea Mall is a great spot to dine, hang out with friends, watch the games, and find a good gluten free pizza. It's conveniently located at the Brea Mall just off the 57 Freeway in North Orange County. I call in my order and pick it up most of the time. (714) 990-2095. I'm not a fan of noisy restaurants but the food never disappoints."
Kevin Y.,"Fullerton, CA",3,134,243,2.0,12/20/2010,Busy in Holidays season. But they forgot a order and I didn't payment it.
Mandy R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,4.0,10/30/2009,"This place is awesome!  Food is great, and the drinks are decently priced. Staff is awesome and always on top of things"
Brianna C.,"Whittier, CA",23,21,5,2.0,5/28/2014,"This location has sadly gone down hill. The staff is not as attentive as they used to be. I had a graduation party there in May 2013 and had the patio reserved, yet they failed to mention to me that I wouldn't be getting the entire patio area for my party. I planned that party months in advance! We had over 30 people! I could have really used the extra space. It was hard for my guests to get around the tables the way they set it up. I have since been there and have had very similar negative experiences. The service is slow, and they don't listen to their customers when they ask if they can put a game on tv. I then made reservations for 15 people for my fiancé's grad party (basic menu, nothing like what my party was) and they almost messed that up by not having the table ready and having the wrong reservation time. I was fuming! It was a surprise for him too! Luckily my friends were able to get it taken care of before I got there with my fiancé. Needless to say, I am avoiding that location from now on because I have been too dissatisfied and can't bare to deal with the lack of service and sub par food that they serve, since after all the food is lukewarm by the time we get it."
Troy M.,"San Pedro, CA",168,245,12,3.0,11/26/2009,"To do it: $17 First, I'd like to say I'm really impressed with the Yelp community here.  I really expected this place to have 500 reviews that said, ""This place is AWESOME!"" 5 Stars.  Well, it's not exactly awesome. +There are things that I like, -and things that I don't like. +The seasonal pumpkin ale -Every other beer on the menu +The buffalo chicken pizza -How I feel after eating it +How your waiter cuts and serves your pizza -How the waiter takes forever to do anything else +The pizza -The other food +The spicy tomato marinara spaghetti as an entree for one -The lack of other good, one-person entrees +The surrounding, empty Sear's parking lot -The unparkably full BJ's lot +The bros -The bros Summary: An easy ""go-to"" choice for groups, and not a bad one.  It's not a great one either though."
Gabriel D.,"Los Angeles, CA",142,41,1,3.0,10/21/2009,"BJs food is so good. The pizza is amazing, their calzone is even better, and the pazookies are what I fantasize about, sending me into fits of cursing myself for having ever decided to diet. Pazookies... Anyway, yes, the food is good, that's established. So you may be asking yourself, ""But Gabe, why are you only giving them 3 stars LOL?"" (That's my favorite phrase) Well, because they can't seem to figure things out quickly, the service sucks, and if you ever need anything taken care of, you end up being ""That guy"" who hunted down the manager. The hunt was quick, by the way. His camouflage did him no good. I had a real easy request (read: Demand). I just moved here from NorCal, and the Sharks were playing the Kings. I called ahead of time and asked if they would be showing ""The Kings game."" They assured me they were. I picked this place over any other sports bar, or bar that I could have gone to. When I get there, it takes a while to get a drink ordered, which is never a happy time. At one point, I was considering asking the bartender to stop grabbing the other bartender's ass and maybe try and earn some money. I didn't... There's no hope for those who don't want a decent tip. After getting a drink (finally) I asked about the game. The bartender, while catching glances from his coworker, informed me that they wouldn't be showing it. Excuse me? Go check again. I sent him on a few wild goose chases trying to figure something out, while frantically calling 411 to find a bar that would show it- Hockey is important! Finally, I was forced to get the manager, and it was amazing how quickly he was able to tell me when it would be on, on which TVs, and that I should order another drink. He was very persuasive, and unbelievably helpful. I usually don't interact with the wait staff more than ordering, so normally this would be a 5 star attraction... But sitting at the bar is utter hell, competing with one bartender to get the others attention. In the end, I will go back... I like their drinks and they'll play the games, but just a recommendation for that bartender, if he reads this: When you're going to make out with your coworker and not get me another drink, don't do it out in the front. I know you think no one was watching and getting pissed off, but they were."
Elizabeth S.,"Cypress, CA",0,22,1,5.0,10/9/2012,Came in for lunch yesterday and had an amazing BJ's experience! My server's name was Jenny and she was awesome! She was super friendly and gave us great service. We ordered the BBQ chicken pizza and it was delicious! It also came out nice and warm unlike other BJs restaurants we have been too. The tomato soup is also a MUST to get. One of the best tomato soups out there!
Javier J.,"Los Angeles, CA",1656,1996,248,4.0,8/7/2009,"(Insert crude Blow Job joke here about the name) I mean everyone else has done it, why can't I?  I have been to this location more times than any other BJ. Why? I really don't know. It's about 30 minutes away from me on the highway that I never can drink till the point that I could get a cab ride back.  I suppose I come here because all the friends willing to come here live in the area and they don't want to get drunk far from home. Oh well, doesn't mean I can't enjoy the pitchers that come out.  The line is long. I mean, both for this place and the near by cheese cake factory, you can face a two hour wait at times. really frustrating but if you arrive there early enough, you'll get your table without too much of a wait.  The pizza, while I'm not always in the mood for Chicago style pizza, was pretty good. Over the course of time I have had to had everyone at least twice. I still like the BBQ chicken one the best.  When it comes to beer, it's best to go with pitchers, but unless you know what you like, it would be a good idea to get a couple of the sampler pacts. Those come in lovely little test tubes and are great fun and will get you pretty buzzed."
Rose C.,"Manhattan, NY",21,98,1,5.0,4/18/2013,"I've always been skeptical of chain restaurants but I have to say I was very pleasantly surprised here. We went not expecting much and all left very satisfied. Nice atmosphere and the food was really great. We ordered the Stuffed Mushroom Appetizer and we probably could have eaten another 2 orders, it was that good. My sister got the Shrimp Angel Hair pasta and ate every bite. She gave it rave reviews. I had the Cajun Pasta and I absolutely loved it. It was just the right combination of spicy and creamy and the portions were nice and substantial. My son had the sliders and they were obviously very good because he ate them all and that's unusual! Definitely worth a visit for a nice lunch or dinner."
Kevin Z.,"Riverside, CA",4,56,69,1.0,10/9/2011,"If I could give no star I would.... but I love the beer at BJs so they can keep the one star..... the review is based off this location. Came here with 5 people. It took them an hour to seat us. People were getting seated before us who had come after us. It took the staff THREE attempts to seat us. They sat us, we told them they are nuts if they think we'll fit there and so they took us back up to the front. a girl said our table was ready (a minute after we got back to the front). She took us right back to the same table.............. we told her that they had tried to seat us here already...... and it wouldn't work......  she had us just stand at the door to the patio (where we were to be seated...) and watched them fumble with the tables and chairs.... finally they had us sit down.... we had two different sized table that weren't even the same height and fitting us at the tables was a joke. We had a pregnant lady in the group who felt like she would pass out if we didn't sit down soon to ea,t so we just took the table as is.  As for the service after the whole seating shenanigans..... very half assed. It was a busy night and BJ's slips up BIG time when it comes to service. They have three or four girls seating people... and like 2 server working the entire patio full of people. We were not there with a group of HS kids who don't care what the food or service is like as long as we can talk about facebook. We were a family of people trying to have a nice dinner. Maybe it's our fault for expecting to have some service with the price associated with the cost of eating at a venue like BJs?"
