Alex G.,"Carson, CA",1,29,3,2.0,9/2/2017,This BJs sucks. Third time I come and I feel like the waiters don't service you because you don't order booze. Had to ask 3xs for refill on our waters and kids drinks. Asked twice for bbq sauce for the kids nuggets. Which never came. My daughter waited forever and i mean in excess of15 min. When it was brought was asked if we wanted a piezookie knowing we weren't done eating. I understand a waiters job is difficult but 3xs to get bad service? I'm a club member and all three times I let them know and get ignored. Sorry yelpsters wish i could give a better report.
Fred G.,"Long Beach, CA",0,3,1,5.0,11/25/2017,"Have to say the service is amazing here... first time at this restaurant... I normally pick up for Door dash but today I wanted to experience the food... the staff was amazing and very friendly... Vanessa, my waitress, was on top of things and always made sure my cup was filled, food served in a timely manner, can't wait to return and again thank you Vanessa for the smiles and great service"
ML M.,"Honolulu, HI",89,2,,3.0,6/9/2017,"Went to a christening. The reservation is at 12 and there was no food ready for the party even if it was already 12:30 when we got there. My friends didn't anticipate a hot weekend so they reserved the patio spot. I know the restaurant is not to blame for the weather but their patio felt like their heaters were on! They only had 4 fans and there were no extra blowers whatsoever. All guests were sweating like crazy.  The food was decent - pizza and pasta. However the first batch of spaghetti was very pale. The server didn't mix it properly and whatever sauce was there was extremely minimal. I don't know why they don't mix it themselves because for the second batch, there was sufficient sauce. I was only aware of it because I ended up mixing it myself.  Chicken BBQ pizza was really good. And servers were nice. That's about it.  I don't know if it was just a bad day for us."
Ernie C.,"La Habra, CA",1,50,1,3.0,8/23/2017,Been here many times...i always sit the bar and order my food and drinks...the bartender are very friendly and always ask if you meed anything...as far as the food its good nothing gourmet...but good...they always have a good group of guest beers along with their own brew...pozookies are always a treat...this place is a great place for happy hour with happy hour discounts
Fran W.,"Anaheim, CA",0,3,,2.0,9/16/2017,"Service was terrible! Service felt like eternity! My daughter had hair in her pasta. Again, she had to wait forever to get a new plate! We got charged for her meal -Most restaurants would take it off your tab! Waiter was nice but needs to be more attentive or they need  to hire more employees!!!! We were there celebrating a special occasion...I'll think twice before I I choose to go to that location again!!! I love their Brussel Sprouts, that's the only reason why I gave two stars."
Tino J.,"Whittier, CA",6,171,32,5.0,7/15/2017,"Came in last night with the wife after doing a little shopping. Place was pretty busy but our wait time was 20min that was unbelievable considering most establishments usually say 20 mins and it's 45 mins wait time. We were seated I ordered the chicken Parmesan and the wife ordered the peanut yakisoba with a wedge salad and Cadillac margarita,our bill came out to $45 and some change. Food was good and our service was excellent our waitress was on it never had to ask for anything. Great atmosphere casual dress. Would definitely be back for dinner with friends."
Kimberly S.,"Long Beach, CA",54,9,17,2.0,12/22/2016,"This review is mainly based on service. It is Thursday night, 8:40pm and the restaurant is not too busy. We check in at the front as ask for a table 2. The girl said give me five minutes so we said ok and continued to stand there and wait. After a few minutes we sat down and a party of 3 came in after us. 10 minutes pass by, the party of 3 is sat. So my husband goes up again and asks when we can be seated, the girl replies with ""for how many?"" Clearly having forgot that we were there and never took our name.  A few minutes later we are seated, just about 9pm when we ordered. We just wanted a relatively simple and quick dinner so we ordered a Santa Fe salad and portobello fries as an appetizer with a peach tea and a sparkling water.  Our appetizer came to the table at 9:24. It took about 10 minutes after we finished eating the appetizer (had it cleared from the table also) until the salad came out.  The waiter was attentive with our drink refills by coming and asking when our drink was low, but it took so long for the refills to come out. We were so thirsty!  We finish the salad and order dessert. One pazookie. I think after 15 minutes he noticed we were slumped over in our seats just tired of waiting, (cause at this point it was nearly 10pm) so he came over and said let me check on the pazookie and also said I'll get you a refill as well.  Finally the pazookie came out around 10:10. Delivered by someone else who wasn't our waiter. Still no refill in sight. We finish the pazookie and he comes back and says he will get the check (and the refill) which at this point I didn't even want anymore. Finally, done with the check and left the restaurant at 10:30! We arrived at 8:40.... 2 hours of our night for an appetizer, SALAD and a fricken pazookie.  Definitely not going to eat at bjs again if it's a night we have things to do and take care of. I understand that amount of time being spent dining if we had a large group or ordered a lot, but we didn't. Just two people and the restaurant wasn't busy at all. Slowest service I've had in a long long time!"
Danielle B.,"Fullerton, CA",212,21,4,5.0,8/25/2017,"I went to BJ's with one of my awesome friends last night for dinner and I have to say, the service was excellent. To my surprise, we were seated right away without any waiting. Kathryn, our waitress was very nice and efficient with her job.  The food was delicious and  she was also great at getting our orders to our table in a timely fashion. I would definitely come back to this restaurant, because of the delicious food and service. Also, the restaurant wasn't too crowded as this was a weekday night, so I'd recommend visiting BJ's around 5-6:30 on a weeknight, if you want a high possibility of getting a table right when you walk in."
Justin V.,"Cerritos, CA",1,16,50,2.0,8/22/2017,"Went in for lunch time and wow things were horrible. Salad my girlfriend ordered was soggy when it arrived to our table and our waitress was running around nowhere to be found. Didn't remember to bring water or anything to us while waiting. Also, even getting the check took forever. Going back to the Cerritos BJs which is my usual. Horrible experience, will not be coming back"
Michael T.,"Riverside, CA",155,99,442,4.0,7/12/2017,"Came here on a busy Sunday afternoon and was seated quickly. BJs has a pretty large menu so I really wasn't sure what to get until the Late Night Burger caught my eye. It's an open faced hamburger patty covered with bacon, chili verde and a fried egg. Yes. It's an incredibly strange combination but I'll be damned if didn't work. The burger was nicely cooked and you could taste the bacon underneath. But really the proceedings were dominated by the chili verde covering everything. Delicious. Had I been sloshed the night before this would have been a gift from heaven but as is, it was a damn tasty meal. The kiddo got the KRAFT mac and cheese again so no comment there. Even though it was busy, service was pretty good (other than getting coffee spilled on my jeans, which also netted me a free pizookie). My water glass was constantly filled and we were constantly being checked on. So yeah, overall another good experience at BJs."
John M.,"Walnut, CA",0,1,,2.0,9/7/2017,"Use to enjoy this restaurant, but lately the food quality has not been very good. Went there for a quick lunch. Had a Cesar salad that was awful. Lettuce was not fresh and the chicken was precooked and heated up. Very disappointed! Service was great. Food was not!"
Ron A.,"Whittier, CA",105,711,214,5.0,1/12/2017,"This is by far my favorite location ever since I moved last year. I came here for lunch on Saturday on my most recent visit with my wife. Parking was easy to find about 100 yards away from the entrance. The wait for a party of two was only less than five minutes. Awesome! The waitress was very nice and friendly. Made good eye contact with me when I talked to her. For a beverage, I ordered a glass of a cabernet sauvignon. I cannot recall the exact name of it, but it was a full body red. For appetizer, we order the avocado egg rolls. Came to our table in about 10 minutes. They were warm, crispy and delicious. As for the main entree, we ordered a half ""BJ's Favorite"" and half ""Chicken Bacon Ranch"" deep dish pizza. It was just as good. Great amount of cheese! I like cheese. We decided to not eat dessert here, but if we had room for it, we would have ordered a small pizookie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. While we were eating, the waitress did refill my wife's beverage since it was only soda. She also did check on us time-to-time to make sure we had the best experience. I can say, we did! As for the ambience, since it was not busy at lunch, my wife and I could hear each other talk without raising our voice. Like any BJ's Restaurant, there were plenty of TVs around to watch any game."
John P.,"Clearfield, UT",5,4,3,2.0,4/8/2017,Ribeye steak is horrible!!! Sizzler has better cuts of meats and I will never eat a steak at sizzler!!!! Atmosphere is cool!
Stephanie M.,"Yorba Linda, CA",418,101,504,5.0,4/17/2016,"My boyfriend and I stopped at this BJ's location to watch the Clippers vs. Trail Blazers 1st Round Playoff Game 1 and get food and drinks at the bar.  Andrew & his co-bartender (I forgot to ask her name) did a great job getting our drinks and food orders. For food, we split the chicken lettuce wraps and a crispy jalepeno burger with a turkey patty substitute. For drinks, I had a greyhound with Kettle One, and my guy had a Piranna and a Committed Double IPA. Andrew mixed my greyhound perfectly, and we both thought that the drinks paired well with the food we ordered. The crowd at the bar was fun, and we all enjoyed watching the Clippers dominate the Blazers, 115-95.  GO CLIPPERS!"
Pineapple C.,"Lakewood, CA",7,176,2,5.0,1/2/2017,"This review is for our server, Natalie A.  Our large party dined on December 18, 2016 from 4-6pm, and she was FANTASTIC!!!   I had the baby back ribs; too sweet for me."
Sebastian C.,"Fullerton, CA",2313,339,42,3.0,4/29/2016,"This BJ's location is not the best one because of a couple factors. The food is alright and so are the drinks, but what really gets me is the service. It's usually very slow 80% of the time. I've been to this location countless number of times just because it's the closest one to my house, but i'm never fully satisfied after eating here. Maybe I got the bad servers, maybe I didn't. Maybe i'm just rambling like an angry old man. I just haven't had any good impressions left here yet. One note: This is right next to the mall, so parking may be a little on the rough side, but there's usually more than enough room for that. 3 stars at most just because of my experience with the service here."
Liana S.,"Fullerton, CA",0,1,,2.0,10/29/2017,"Came here for dinner last night. It was pretty busy because of the baseball game. I ordered the bacon guacamole burger and asked for a veggie patty and no bacon. I asked for no bacon twice to make sure my server heard me over the noise. When I got my burger, there was a veggie patty, but there was also plenty of bacon. I ASKED FOR NO BACON. Disappointed with the service and felt like I wasted my money here."
Jan B.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,14,,2.0,8/17/2017,"As residents of the LasVegas area we absolutely enjoy BJ's!  So when we saw there was a restaurant near our route, we made a choice to exit for a great meal! No!  First, my Husband went to the restroom.  Although the restaurant was not busy they were placing names on a waiting list.  I suggested we would sit in the bar at an available booth. I waited 10 minutes and got concerned about my Husband...He appeared and was upset....they had seated him at another table?!  When he returned from the rest room, he asked where I was seated.  Three people were at the front desk and no one knew?  He accepted a seating thinking I went to the restroom since we had been on the road 3.5 hours. He was on his way to check on me and saw me seated!  10 minutes!!  As I look around I am the only single woman in the restaurant....I even received a group hug from two of the waitresses when I was seated since I was road weary. It was Happy Hour and our destination was 45 minutes away so we ordered appetizers: Chips and dip (guacamole)....the chips gleaned with grease, the dip was dark with wilted garnishes.   I got the dry ribs with saturated ribs with a side of finely chopped dry vegetables saturated in dressing . My husband got the avocado egg rolls which were fresh and delicious. Sadly the food preparation was poor with a distasteful appearance. Very different than Las Vegas!  So disappointed..... My husband spoke with the Manager that offered an indifference with no response!   Our waitress was a delight, courteous, and attentive."
Car C.,"Lynwood, CA",0,20,3,1.0,10/28/2017,"Ordered curbside 2:45... get there 3pm called 4 times to number no one answered until finally called the restaurant and they answered. I advise paid over app, 5 min later they come and say it's 43, as explained on the phone already PAID. I wait another 10 min nothing I finally get off the car and people just stare at me??? Like really what's the purpose of having that option if you can't complete it properly. Rude people! Didn't even apologize for inconvenience just looked and acted like not happening"
Martin B.,"Laguna Beach, CA",303,27,204,5.0,4/6/2016,Let's start with the service.....Brooke was our server what an amazing waitress she is! She pleasantly greeted us and took four very hard orders perfectly. The food was cooked to perfection and delicious!  Best of all Tuesday is half off all wine!!!!!!!
