Amber G.,"Orange, CA",21,14,,4.0,1/15/2013,The food and service were amazing! I loved that we could call ahead and wait only 15 minutes once we arrived. My entire family loved their meals/drinks. I got the Angel Hair Toscana pasta with Cajun Shrimp and I couldn't have been more happy! Def worth ordering again! Had a great experience :)
Angeline W.,"Fullerton, CA",104,91,20,4.0,6/1/2012,"Heavy, filling food. Don't come here too often. You will get really fat."
Brittany m.,"Whittier, CA",79,16,,4.0,8/23/2010,"Order a Piranha Pale Ale and a side of Thai Shrimp Wraps and you'll be in heaven. There's a reason this place is always packed, and that's because the food is terrific (especially the deep dish pizzas) and the beer and drink selection here takes up the first four pages of the menu. The service won't let you down either, our waiter was even eager to share his experience of tasting the deep dish cheeseburger pizza with us (""do you want ketchup?""), and the Pizookie dessert is a hell of a way to end your experience, (to die for, but not literally, no choking...) I completely recommend this place AND it's Happy Hour to anyone, any day."
Chad G.,"Yorba Linda, CA",3,74,,2.0,5/17/2011,"This place is ok. Food is generally good, but pricey. Parking can be a pain generally can find one, but you might have to walk a little. My problem is with the Buffalo Chicken Pizza. It had onions, which threw my taste buds off making it taste like something other than Buffalo Chicken. Totally took away the taste I was craving. Will go again sometime in the future and order something else."
Alan J.,"Los Angeles, CA",111,75,,4.0,4/7/2010,"Gotta review this place, I worked here for about 9 months when I was in college so I know the menu and atmosphere pretty well.  BJ's is good for pretty much anything.  Drinks after work, a birthday party that can seat lots of people, a brewery for the beer lovers, excellent happy hours, a great place to watch a sports game, or a good place to take the family.  I've had the menu many times over and their pizza is the best thing on it for sure.   During happy hour mini pizzas are $5, which is a great deal for the quality you get.  The bar pops off, so if you're looking for  a crowd, the place is always full.  The nachos are huge, I like the spinach dip and chicken tenders.  You can choose from any of 6 sauces with everythign you get, honey mustard, ranch, thousand island, bleu cheese, and a couple others I can't recall.   Overall, I give the place a 4 because while the food is good, I wouldn't come here if I was looking for a great meal.  I wouldn't come here if I was looking for a good whiskey, or  any type of really good drink.   If I was single, I wouldn't come here to ""mingle"".  I'd rather go to Yardhouse down the street or Taps.    So the point is, this BJ's is solid for any occasion, but not great for any.  4-5 stars."
Ken M.,"Long Beach, CA",49,106,2,3.0,6/30/2009,"I came here on a Saturday night, and while the lines were long, I went right in because my friends were already sitting at a table. It was my first time at BJ's and the first thought that came to my mind is that this is going to be another chain home style resturants similar to TGIFs. But to my surprise, it was the total opposite of TGIFs, it has the ambergris of the pubs you find in England with the crappy British food. They brew their own beer here, and I enjoy the blonde ale here.  Food-wise, I had the roasted chicken, which I was expecting to come in breast format. But instead, they give you a whole side of a chicken, and a cesear salad, which I enjoy a great deal. The chicken was well cooked, and the breast meat was tender and juicy. In all, the give the chicken 5 stars. The reason why I gave the restaurant 3 stars is because of the slow service. My friend order a simple club sandwhich which shouldn't take an hour long to make. We were about to finish our meals when the sandwhich finally came. Talk about long service.  In all, this place isn't too bad for a causal meeting of friends, but they need to hire a faster cook."
Steven S.,"Anaheim, CA",5,3,1,4.0,4/21/2014,"Good friendly customer service, food was good , especially the jalapeno burger ,melts right in your mouth,and   mansion the peanut butter pazokie so good ,only bad part I would say is the wait on a sunday afternoon was long but other than that its great"
Jim W.,"Chittenango, NY",49,6,,4.0,2/20/2011,"While visiting family in California I was really itching to visit a local brewery and try some of their craft brews. Truth be told this was not our first choice but it worked out well. My father in-law and I visited this location on a Saturday afternoon and sat at the bar. We decided to each try the beer sampler. I was surprised and pleased to see the size of the beers included in the sampler. The sampler features eight beers set on a mat which explains the characteristics of each. The beers ranged from a very light beer with about 3% ABV to their stout which was close to 9% ABV. The beers came in tall glasses which were about 4 ounces each. I thought the beers were good, but not fantastic. In fact, when we finished the sampler I didn't even order any of those beers, but instead ordered an Oktoberfest which was very, very good. The atmosphere is nice, and I would definitely try it again sometime."
Jeri M.,"Monterey Park, CA",15,24,3,5.0,3/19/2012,"Went for dinner New Year's Eve. The hostess quoted a 30 minute wait. We made our way to the bar for drinks while we waited. We found a table for the 3 of us and were quickly greeted by Laurel who informed us that bar seating was open seating and we were welcome to eat there. She also informed us that they were experiencing some computer problems and some delay in orders could be possible. However, that didn't seem to be the case. We ordered and were finished in under an hour....Laurel was great!!! Thank you for starting our New Year's Eve off on a positive note...."
Markelle G.,"Whittier, CA",79,202,583,2.0,9/22/2009,"I have to agree with some of the other reviewers...it seems as though the service at BJs has slipped in recent months.  I went there with a group of co-workers to celebrate a birthday, and we were almost an hour and a half LATE getting back to work.  This is because the service was incredibly slow, and our food kept getting messed up.  One person found an unidentifiable hard object in her broccoli-cheese soup.  Another co-worker found a piece of bone in her chicken (which was supposed to be boneless, of course).  Yet another girl ordered a pizza, and it was so undercooked it had to be sent back...TWICE.  The same thing happened with another co-worker, who had meat that was so undercooked, it also had to be sent back.  My boss ordered a salad, and even though the waitress asked her what kind of chicken she wanted, the salad was delivered to the table without meat.  Keep in mind this all happened in ONE SITTING...ONE SINGLE MEAL.  At least the manager on duty was gracious, and comped our entire meal.  It was a disaster.  By the end of the lunch, we were so appalled, all we could do was shake our heads and laugh!  It was like something out of a bad movie.  A few weeks later, a handful of my (brave) co-workers made a return trip, and they had a similar experience.  Particularly with the pizza, it never seems to come out cooked.  The first time it was so doughy, it looked like it hadn't even been sent through the oven! I also have to echo the complaints about happy hour.  They will absolutely refuse to serve you drinks at happy hour prices, unless you're seated at the bar.  At least, that was MY experience.  It's frustrating."
Dr. Catherine L.,"Moreno Valley, CA",517,127,93,4.0,3/6/2012,"I like the place. It is a nice and fun place to hang out with friends. Food is good for an American sit down food.  Nice set up, ambiance, and lighting."
Andy C.,"Fullerton, CA",9,31,8,4.0,4/7/2010,"I've been here a few times, always with a large party of at least 12. Each time we are seated in their indoor-outdoor patio. The entire restaurant was packed every time we went. The environment is okay. The food took quite a while to get to us, but we were a large party. The food is great. I've had several types of pizza before, and none of them disappoint. They are thickly crusted. I've also had one of the chicken dishes before, as well as some pasta dishes. Pizookie: It's hard resisting ice cream on top of a warm cookie. Good place for food. A bit pricey, but worth it with the right people."
Michael L.,"Washington, DC",1,182,3,3.0,11/25/2011,"Eh. I ordered a round of beers off tap and they were flat. The service was good, but... I don't think I'll be heading back."
Vic S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",14,98,41,4.0,1/2/2011,It's great they serve the nutrition guide along w/ the menu. It really helps to make wise choices. Among that they sell mini poozookie's. Less than 1/2 the calories. Minestrone soup comes in cup size too. Something I couldn't find on the menu.  We arrived on a rainy Sunday @ 5:00 pm - got great parking; seated pretty quick considering it's BJ's. Within an hour the place was packed which meant our service when downhill. Up until then it was pretty good.  I love the menu selection of bar drinks that were created by by various staff members.  I tried 3 of them.   There is outside seating - great for large gatherings.  BJ's also takes reservations if you have a group of 10 or more.   Overall the BJ's is pretty good.
Tina-Marie L.,"La Mirada, CA",592,586,357,5.0,12/19/2009,Our waitress rocked! She was on it and she was so accommodating. There were promotions that she didn't fully know about and she went and checked what they were for us.  This was one of the best experiences I've had at a BJ's. And I did a bunch of Christmas shopping there too. I was able to get gift cards and got myself some pint glasses and a surprise card I can check the day after Christmas.  The other cool thing about this BJs is that it shares the parking lot with the Brea mall but it's not attached to the mall.
Erica C.,"Garden Grove, CA",79,31,1,4.0,3/25/2009,"I've always had great service at BJs.  Our server was Shaun this time. He was so nice and professional. I could have sworn he had more than 5 tables at once and he had everything under control and had time to check on us numerous times.  I had the Pot Roast Sandwich. It was not exactly a sandwich...It was a half of french roll bread with juicy pot roast beef, topped with a scoop of garlic mashed potato and gravy and served with a side of steamed vegetables. It was ALL GOOD.  For dessert I had a rootbeer float. I kinda regretted it after I laid eyes on my bf's cookies n' cream pizookie. After much bickering, pinching and plate grabbing, he gave finally in and shared his pizookie. Pizookies taste so much better with a side of sweet victory."
Tiffany T.,"Fullerton, CA",120,28,4,1.0,5/28/2013,"This bj's sucks butt. I have been here multiple times in hopes that it was just an off night. Or that my server was new or SOMETHING. But every time that I have gone the service is horrid. The last time that I went was with some friends. the waitress was hurried and disappeared all the time. She would be gone for 30-40 minutes at a time. My table was not rude to her we figured she was just busy. There were only 5 of us. When we were finished with each course the plates sat on the table until the very end of the meal. When someone finally cleared A plate. Then we wanted dessert but she just came and took our plates and then left for another 30 minutes. When we asked for the check she threw it on the table and left before we had a chance to make sure it had been divided up correctly. I had to call her over to fix a mistake on the check. She then attempted to fix it and 25 minutes later came back with the check. It was still wrong. When we alerted her she rolled her eyes at my friend and then walked away not saying anything. She was awful, and every server that I have had since going to this bj's at least 6 times, has been terrible. I am never going back again. And I suggest that anyone who feels like the bj's food go to a different one in a different city, OR just walk across the street to the cheesecake factory."
Jessica R.,"Fullerton, CA",21,29,3,4.0,4/5/2012,"The pizookies are sooo good especially the peanut butter and the red velvet. Overall the food is good, I prefer the appetizers over their main dishes though. Lettuce wraps, avocado rolls, etc all very tasty. However when I do get a main dish it's usually the ahi tuna salad, the fish tacos or one of their tasty pizzas like the Mediterranean or barbeque chicken pizza. As far as their specialty drinks go, I don't think I have tried one that I didn't like. Service is pretty good as well and the hostesses are pretty spot on about the wait times."
Eric G.,"Placentia, CA",0,2,,2.0,6/23/2014,Came in 6/20/14 for a bosses happy hour I was the least of impressed with the guy bartender on duty. I don't believe he has any kind of customer service skills. Middle 3 rd time up to the bar he skipped charging buddies of mine their tab even though he closed out the tab twice in front of me so I was told when I bought a drink that I had to cover it. I doubt I'll be going back here for awhile. The food is great but the customer service is very short.
Bonnie Y.,"Chino, CA",125,741,3648,4.0,4/28/2009,"great place to hang out... sports bar with nice food... whether it''s just the finger foods, pizza, sandwich or pasta... not to mention finishing up with a Pizookie...  never forget the beers from their own brewery... get a sampler to try everything first and pick the ones you like!"
