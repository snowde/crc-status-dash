Sterling R.,"Anaheim, CA",52,9,2,4.0,3/3/2012,"I had a very good burger from here, can't really remember it's name. I do recall it being very good though. Very nice atmosphere, enjoyed my first time!!"
Kristin F.,"Irvine, CA",24,32,,4.0,12/25/2010,"Came here for a birthday party and let's just say that we all left STUFFED!  I had a taste of the BBQ pizza, salad, and caesar salad with chicken. So excellent!  Considering our big group, our server brought our food out pretty quickly and was fun with our group. This location is always so busy. Hence, we had to make reservations outdoor in the patio area.  Overall, a great restaurant that is quickly becoming one of my favorites."
Jamie C.,"Fullerton, CA",1,44,1,4.0,3/30/2014,Tried the cookies and cream pizooki for the first time.  So yummy!
Ryan B.,"Rowland Heights, CA",285,27,3,4.0,9/20/2009,This is your typical Bj's it's full of dark wood comfy chairs and moderately priced fare. Good beers and drinks and decent American food.  There is nearly always a wait here and the strange terraced floor plan makes it nearly unacceptable for people with wheelchairs but if you don't mind being on the bottom level or bar you should be fine.  Great pizza and appetizers though if you want beer get the sampler from their micro-brewery.Save room for a pizookie a large roughly pizza sized cookie with ice cream on top.
Neil G.,"Irvine, CA",383,86,21,4.0,12/24/2011,I lOVE BJs... great service and the pizza is always amazing. Drinks are kind of expensive even during happy hour. Parmasian Crusted Chicken is what is up. YOu HAVE TO TRY THAT. OR the blacked chicken potato. Like WOAH.
Maria V.,"Fullerton, CA",4,18,,4.0,8/5/2009,"I LOVE BJS  haha i am sure if i said that out loud people would  look at me like ""wtf?""  but they have GREAT service GREAT pizza GREAT entrees  delicious desserts MMMM pazookies! woooo! and the root beer [which they make] is amazing but sucks that  they charge you for each refill :[  i can't wait till i am 21 soon and can drink the beer there."
Aaron D.,"Anaheim, CA",421,415,27,4.0,2/11/2009,"BJ's Brewhouse. A lot of upsides and a few down.  This location has seemed far superior to the one in Huntington Beach. It has better seating. It has way way more room. The Parking is amazingly better. The service at this location has always been good for me.  Let it be said that BJ's is no Tap's or Yard. It really pales when compared to some of the other nicer brewery/beer oriented restaurants in Brea. If I was looking at this place on its own it would really shine a lot more than when comparing it to the other places available.  As for BJ's - I often avoid going there because I don't really like any of their appetizers. They are not awful they just also are not great. They need to work on more variety in the menu and on adding some complexity to their recipes.  Most bars can make the appetizers they are offering. The Lettuce wraps are pretty good. If you eat meat then the Angus sliders are ok. But, in general: the appetizers are not great. Appetizers don't make a restaurant; but if your a brewery you better work on your appetizers or people will eventually quit dropping in for a beer. They really need to consider adding a Calamari appetizer with a decent sauce.  As for the beer - I really enjoy the refreshing quality and flavor of the Brew house Blonde and the two varieties of Pale Ale. The Heifenweizen  at BJ's however has a nasty aftertaste. The Jeremiah red is fantastic. And the freshly brewed Root beer is worth trying. Its also delicious with ice cream as a dessert. A great way to go at BJ's is to order the beer sampler and try em out till you have a favorite.  On to Entrees. The Salmon is not very good. It could be that its because its farmed and from the Atlantic. Unfortunately many restaurants have not learned that cheap, farmed, crappy, Atlantic Salmon is not every going to taste elegant or amazing. Its going to taste like cheap, farmed, atlantic Salmon. The clam chowder is pretty tasty. They don't always consistently deliver it hot but when they do its wonderful. The Chardonnay Shrimp Pasta is delicious. They sometimes bring it out with some nasty bacon on top but other times they don't. And some people probably prefer some bacon on their pasta. But, the sauce is fantastic on it. The Jambalaya is pretty tasty here too. They occasionally have a Fish special that's tasty but most of the time they seem to think a lot more about red meat.  The Pizza can be pretty good depending on the night. They need to work on their consistency which is always an issue with chains.  They have a fantastic pazookie. Its a giant cookie with a nice scoop of ice cream served right in the middle of it. Its really a bit much for me but there is nothing wrong with that. So, overall this is a nice location. The food is pretty good. The beer is decent. It's way better than the Tustin Brewery. Its not quite what the Yard and Taps are however.  But, if your with a group and you want some beers and some grub - by all means go and enjoy."
Tom W.,"Fullerton, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/12/2012,"The worst dining experience EVER. Service ( if you want to call it that) was terrible. No food after 45 min after waiting 30 min to order. Not even our salads arrived until we complained , then only two of the five we ordered. Asked for manager and waited 15 min for him. Then after we complained, we were treated like crap and  ignored even more ( if that's possible). Finally asked for our food to go and waited another 30 minutes for them to get the order right! Asked for the manager again, and he never showed.  Gave it one star cause the bathroom was clean.  Been to several BJ's but never this one again! Don't waste your time (literally). Plenty of other choices in this area."
CJ J.,"Irvine, CA",1367,1047,570,1.0,11/24/2008,"BJ's is BJ's. Well not that kind. You know what I mean. The restaurant is the restaurant. Once you've gone to one, you've pretty much gone to all of them. BUT No smoking on the patio?????????? F A I L"
Terry K.,"San Diego, CA",20,82,,2.0,12/11/2008,"First and foremost, this is the only time I've had a bad time at a BJ's restaurant and I eat there a lot. The reason I am writing this is more for the atmosphere/service that was going on when my friends and I ate there last.  Our server did a great job getting our order and getting our food, except the dinner salad I ordered came out after my entree.   The real problem was the family behind us.  They had a young child, probably about 5 or 6 yrs old, maybe younger, I'm not sure, but the kid was going CRAZY!!!! Yelling, screaming, he even had a paper airplane he kept throwing and landing on our table and he kept coming over to grab it back.  Now I understand that kids will be kids, but this kid was way past that phase, and thats when parents or the STAFF need to do something.   I know the servers probably get more than enough complaints, but after asking to either be moved or have someone ask them to just stop being so loud, nothing happened.  Just imagine if that was the server and his friends eating next to that DEVIL CHILD and his inconsiderate family. So the morale of the story is that the service was only so-so especially since they weren't able to figure out that the atmosphere that kid created made the food and experience very bad."
Kristine P.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",136,111,74,3.0,9/26/2009,"Need a place to meet up with good company coupled with great food? BJs is your best bet for great food and drinks. No matter what you order - baked potatoes, pizza, pasta, entrees, burgers, sandwiches, drinks - you get good portions that taste good. You basically get what you pay for IMO.  My favorites?  - Spinach and Artichoke Dip - Avocado Egg Rolls - Wedge Salad - Basalmic Glazed Chicken - Barbecue Chicken Pizza - Sweet Pig Pizza - Grilled Chicken Potato - Grilled Chicken Club Sandwich - Roasted Turkey Cobb Sandwich - Chocolate Chip Pizookie!  However, service will vary from location to location. I was here last Wednesday for my friend's birthday. One of her friends whom I have never met before had reserved a table before we arrived. I approached the hostess, telling her that we were there with a group under the friend's name. The hostess replied, ""Oh, you're here with a group? You can go ahead and walk around the restaurant and look for the group.""  I then explained to her that I had never met this person before, expecting the hostess to politely walk us over to the table. I mean, if a table is reserved, the table location should be programmed into the system right? Annoyed, I told her, ""Never mind, I'll just wait until the birthday girl gets here."" After 10 min of sitting in the waiting area, I guess she must've asked another co-worker about the reservation, so she approached us and said, ""Your party is at the big table in the corner."" Isn't it part of your job to seat us? I wasn't going to lose all hope in BJs just yet. Our server (I totally forgot his name) was VERY attentive and polite, probably the best service I've ever had at any BJs restaurant. At most locations I've been to, after the server brings you your order, you don't really see them until they bring you your check. This guy, however, was constantly checking up on our party of 6. One of our dishes came out undercooked, and he gladly had the dish redone. He also took the dish off the check because it took so long for it to be re-cooked.  I would have been happy to give this BJs a 4-star rating for the food, drinks, and server, but I had to knock off a star because of the hostess at the beginning of the evening."
Jonathan Y.,"Monrovia, CA",61,198,1,4.0,3/14/2009,"After patroning BJ's in Tustin and Cerritos, this is now my local BJ's. Food: As always, the pizzas are above average and much better than fast food places. I love the appetizer sausage pizza!  Service: The service is oh so average and they could check in on you a little more frequently. This isn't a Chinese restaurant so I demand excellence! Ambiance: Great pub like atmosphere typical of most BJ's. However there is no giantic screen behind the bar like Tustin. The bar area is mostly stools unlike the others which do have some tables. TIP: Come after 10pm (I think its 10) and you get half off appetizers and mini pizzas."
Tori L.,"Orange County, CA",1399,1096,502,4.0,8/12/2009,"If you like deep dish pizza, this is your place. If you like big portions, this is your place. If you want good drinks (mixed, beer, etc.) this is your place. I love this place - where else can you get a humongous baked potato, most likely injected with leftover steroids from Barry Bonds' baseball years, and a half of a roasted chicken for under $20? Their mixed cocktails and floats are also yummy.  It's a good place for a 21st birthday or any sort of gathering. The best, of course, is their pizookie.  I know it seems super basic to have a warm oven-fresh cookie topped with vanilla, but seriously, if you can make the same goodness at home, please open your own restaurant."
Katherine L.,"Seattle, WA",55,110,2,4.0,2/15/2009,"The go to place for me and my boyfriend when we want a beer and some good food.  The things I like from Bj's: pizza (with corn), mozzarella sticks, potato skins, chicken lettuce wrap, crispy chicken sandwich, spinach and artichoke dip, fries, Tatonka stout, Belvedere and tonic, the roast beef dip (even though I ""don't eat beef""), and PIZOOKIE (I also like their brownie thing, but I'm mostly overwhelmed with my want for pizookies, it doesn't happen very often).  I'm a very healthy eater, as you can see. Service is pretty good, usually, drinks get refilled pretty often, and prices seem reasonable. Good place to chill at the end of the week, or Wednesday."
Simon K.,"Brea, CA",0,3,1,1.0,3/19/2012,Very unhelpful staff and suuuuper slow service. Go to the Cheesecake Factory right across the way... At least the food is better there.
Karen J.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,18,,4.0,5/20/2012,"First time here was to see an old friend from grade school. We came at Happy Hour, and even though the place was busy the service was still good. Been to places in the past where the staff aren't too interested in answering questions from first timers. Our waitresses was more than happy to help. Think we stayed almost three hours, drinking, eating, laughing and having an overall good time. The beers are excellent, and their appetizers as well. There is an outdoor patio, and that gets packed quickly once the inside fills up. For being a brewery, this place still has a family friendly atmosphere. Will definitely be coming back here next time I'm in the area."
Sierra K.,"Chino Hills, CA",298,30,2,4.0,12/20/2011,"This place has thee biggest menu I've ever seen. A little bit of everything.. I usually go here for lunch with coworkers and the lunch specials are awesome! I usually get the salad/pizza lunch special.. so filling for only less than 10$. & this isn't a dinky iceburg salad... Way better deal than any fast food. Actually, since I'm talking about it, its making me crave it & I might go there today!!"
Del L.,"Orange, CA",8,27,8,2.0,3/24/2009,"I have been a long time patron of BJ's restaurant/brewery in the Orange County area. BJ's has consistently delivered high quality food with excellent customer service. However, that has not been the case in the last month. Two weeks prior, my colleague found pieces of cellophane wrapping in her Ceaser salad. One week prior, my clam chowder was filled three quarters full compared to my other colleague's bowl. These minor problems were remedied quickly and appropriately. I understand mistakes happen, especially in a fast pace environment such as the ""lunch hour."" Nevertheless, the event which transpired two weeks passed on March 12, 2009, has served as a watershed moment for the rest of my professional colleagues and I. On that fateful Thursday, March 12, approximately 60 of my colleagues and I visited BJ's of Brea to celebrate two colleagues' birthdays. The restaurant/brewery had only a few other customers at the time. I do not believe we placed a heavy burden on the staff. We arrived during happy hour 4-7pm. We were declined happy hour pricing on our alcoholic beverages and appetizers, the waitress stated happy hour prices were only applicable to guests at the bar. There was no mention of this policy anywhere I was able to observe. The waitress however, did state we were able to buy alcoholic beverages at the bar, at happy hour prices.  Upon visiting the bar, the bartender stated he could not provide alcoholic beverages at happy hour prices because we were guests seated at the tables. This ""run-around"" type of customer service is inexcusable. More over, as I have stated previously, there is no mention of such strict happy hour policies printed where guess may access it readily. I do not appreciate such inconsistent discriminating policies.  The service was incredibly slow. Mind you, I understand we had a rather large group. But as I have stated previously, there were only a few other patrons at the time. The staff size should have been adequate enough to service our party well, but it was woefully not. To ad insult to injury, the waitress refused to ""split the check."" I cannot comprehend how a large restaurant such as BJ's cannot split the bill for 60 adults. It was not an unreasonable request. We cordially spoke to the manager on duty about our concerns and grievances. He promptly reiterated it is policy and he cannot do anything about the matter. ""Deplorable and incomprehensible"" was my reply. I would like to remind you all of BJ's Gold Standard, ""Our genuine commitment is to take pride in passionately connecting with every guest, on every visit, through flawless and relentless execution of every detail during every shift - to create and keep fanatical fans of BJ's concept and brand."" I observed none of the Gold Standard during our birthday celebration on March 12.  I will add that I am also a patron of the Yardhouse. The Yardhouse does not have limiting policies regarding happy hour availability to guests seated anywhere. The Yardhouse is more than happy to accommodate large parties. In fact we recently had another birthday celebration yesterday, March 23. The Yardhouse was more than obliging to ""split the check."" Comparing BJ's services to other restaurants and businesses, I have come to the conclusion BJ's does not appreciate business during a recession. I have also come to the conclusion money speaks louder than words and my colleagues, family, friends, and I shall no longer patronize BJ's restaurant/brewery. Two Stars, because I am a generous person and I believe BJ's can still turn themselves around if they are willing to listen to customers and make appropriate changes."
Emma P.,"Orange County, CA",182,191,10,2.0,1/30/2009,"Came here for my friend's birthday party and we had to sit out in the party area and it was cold! There wasn't any of those heater things, so yeah.  We had like buffet style food and it was only two dishes: pizza and Alfredo pasta.. that's it! The thing was that it wasn't that good... =/ but I still took home some that night, ate it the next morning, and it was horrible.  It was a party of about 33 and it was like 586$ without tax... it was 17$ per person without tax  or tip. I think that's too expensive for only two items that didn't even taste good.  Therefore, I'd rather go to the one in Huntington Beach!"
Alvin V.,"Pasadena, CA",690,211,37,3.0,8/31/2008,"BJ's will always be the same... I didn't have the food here but I'm pretty much it's the same quality as any other BJ's. We went here for a night cap. The place was pretty packed for a Monday night.  The bartender was nice and the drinks were ok. We were surprise she didn't know how to make a Washington Apple with Crown... I guess she was use to making it with Vodka.. Ewwwwwww The place overall is nice, clean and spacious. Nice location and recommend to anyone for groups. I mean, it's BJ's come on! Pazookie!?!?!?!?!?!?!"
