Eun K.,"Buena Park, CA",78,35,2,4.0,12/22/2010,Ordered an appetizer pizza. It was good~ The service took awhile. But then I felt bad cuz my friend who shall remain nameless *cough* Greg T was acting like a weirdo. So I'm happy she didn't spit in my food. =)
Ashley M.,"Chino, CA",41,10,2,1.0,12/9/2010,I gave it a 1 star because if you try UNOs deep dish it's better that bj
Emily D.,"Utica, MI",3,53,,3.0,5/27/2009,"Deep dish Chicago style pizza was all that I needed to hear to get me to try this place. Coming from Detroit, where Pizza Papalis reigns king of the deep dish pizza category, I am a pretty tough judge, but was excited to try BJ's nonetheless.  My friend and I split a medium cheese pizza, which was enough for the both of us. We also ordered some garlic cheese bread and some pizookies.  Okay, so the garlic cheese bread was just french bread with herbs on it. The pizza tasted like bland Pizza Hut pizza, had almost no sauce on it, and wasn't even really deep dish.. but the pizookie which is a deep dish  cookie was warm and chewy and delicious but took longer than our pizzas to come out.. So this still leaves me on the hunt to find descent pizza in So Cal.."
Mike L.,"Brea, CA",0,3,,5.0,3/3/2014,"Food was excellent at bj's of Brea..lived in Brea for 15yrs and think this is was my first experience their.  Food was amazing! This is my second ever review on yelp and I'm taking my own time to log in to reconize our server Albert.  One hell of a nice guy and a perfect ten of a server. Thank you so much for a great experience.  If my wife wasn't  three weeks from delivery  of our child I would of tipped you triple of what I tipped.  Some people work so hard and should be reconized even though  that's their job!   Again thank you and thank you to manager Steve for running a great crew, and nice talking to you.....Mike L. -----Brea resident"
B. C.,"Pittsfield, MA",110,168,8,3.0,3/25/2011,"The atmosphere is 4 stars, and the food is 3 stars.... Overall I was satisfied with my meal, but nothing truly wowed me.  The waitress was pretty knowledgeable about the beer selection and had some decent recommends for the food menu also.  The price point is a huge plus as I have seen other people posting about.  The service was very fast and efficient and everyone appeared to like their job.  That is always a plus.  haha."
Ana B.,"Portland, OR",811,699,339,4.0,6/9/2008,"I love BJs - take that statement however you wish and it still stands true! j/k....um idk. I have been here a bunch and have always had a good experience. I have tried a wide variety of things on the menu, the pizzas are really good! I've also had all the micro brews they offer. My personal favorites are the Jeremiah Red and the Brewhouse Blonde. My friend ordered a pitcher of Jeremiah Red for the cute boys at the next table and it was a hit. Previous to yesterday, I had only seen that done in cheesy movies , but it works folks! If you're a beer person, such as myself, they have beer appreciation night the 1st Tuesday of every month at 7:30, for 18 dollars. So worth the money! My friend and i started off out meal yesterday with the Lettuce wrap ($8.95) appetizer which was great. One of the sauces was a little gross so I just stuck with the other one. We both got Margaritas which we agreed weren't super impressing. Not to mention they were 7.25$, only .70cents cheaper then our lunch specials. whack! We got the lunch special which included half a sandwich, a salad , and french fries. Pretty good deal is you ask me, super filling! I got the turkey  cobb sandwich which i recommend! You can't really go wrong with anything you order here. Another thing I feel worth mentioning is that have ""Curbside service"" you can order ahead and they'll bring it to your car. I will most definitely be utilizing that some day i don't feel like getting out of my PJs."
Meghan S.,"Yorba Linda, CA",2,15,6,2.0,8/13/2008,"So went here last night for a friend's birthday. Now I understand that a wait staff might have a few issues with 17 people, but when you have 3 waiters working the table, it shouldn't be a problem. I loathe blue cheese dressing. Despise it. I ordered the Turkey Cobb Sandwich with NO blue cheese. I told the waitress TWICE specifically NOT to put blue cheese on my sandwich. Another girl ordered a pazookie as her dinner. The waitress even asked her if she wanted it to come as her meal, she confirmed. The Pazookie never came. Other than that... all was good. Everyone else's meals that I taste-tested were excellent including my own shoe-string fries and dinner salad that I had orderd. Just needs a little work on the service."
Bob S.,"Yorba Linda, CA",165,13,4,1.0,8/23/2013,Wait time was given as 10 mins now an hour and counting. Establishment needs some training of staff. Time is asimportant just as much as a meal to a costumer.
HELEN L.,"Lakewood, CA",0,65,27,1.0,6/17/2010,"ROACHES!!!!!!!!!  Finished my meal, was quite satisfied with the food, then I saw the disgusting roaches!!!!!!!  TWO!!!!!!  Two means two million!!!  I am never going here again!!!!"
Joe R.,"Chino Hills, CA",39,137,1,5.0,8/15/2013,Best service i've had from a BJs!
Shayna O.,"Rohnert Park, CA",46,47,10,4.0,7/2/2011,Came to visit family and this was our first time here. My husband and I ordered a small pizza for the two of us and it was delicious! I had their custom root beer and it waste best I've ever had! Would definitely come back to choose from their big selection of food!
Cynthia J.,"Costa Mesa, CA",1023,368,57,4.0,4/9/2011,The service is pretty good here the few times i've been here. Prices can be expensive for what you get. The portions are huge though. They have a full bar and nice beer selection of BJ brews. Dinner time there can be a wait. So just plan ahead for that.
Arlett V.,"Fontana, CA",6,9,,3.0,12/22/2013,"I came here on a Saturday night with a group of friends and we were seated right away.  It looked like a pretty slow night.  We got our waters right away but when it came down to take our orders it took 20 min.  He checked on the 2 girls that were sitting next to us about 3 times before taking our orders.  We mostly ordered appetizers.   To get our food and the drink I ordered was another 20 min.  I understand if he was busy with another table somewhere else, but not once did we get an apology for the waits.  We waited a total of 40 min to eat.  I'm not even exaggerating!  My friend had the stuffed mushrooms and she said it was amazing.  My bf and his cousin had pazookies, which they said were very good.  I shared the artichoke and spinach dip.  I had wonton chips instead of the tortilla chips. I had to try something different.  It was actually really good!  So the food was good, but the service not so much."
Grant T.,"Irvine, CA",88,49,1,5.0,6/29/2011,"Great pizza, awesome pizookie, and friendly service. What more could you ask for?"
matthew p.,"Anaheim, CA",18,252,134,3.0,4/4/2011,you cant beat a pazookie! warm cookie and ice cream...MMMMMMMMMMMM their new calamari on the menu is terrible. AWFUL in fact. stay away.  the wings are mediocre as well and whatever they consider hot sauce is a joke.  the beer is served fast...but is never terribly cold...so ur always in a rush to drink it fast before it tastes like urine the pizza is good.. i had a slice of pepperoni and sausage the meatloaf is good as well.  this place is like a cheesecake factory. it does a lot of things right and a lot of things wrong.  prices are acceptable but are not a bargain by any means i would go back...it just wont be on top of my list
Joy C.,"Walnut, CA",5,30,,4.0,5/5/2011,"My boyfriend and I love this BJs out of all the socal BJs. Why? Because their service is the friendliest and quickest. And they don't over heat the pizookie, which is a no no!"
Maria F.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,30,21,3.0,8/22/2011,"Went here yesterday for a family lunch.. my kids love the Salmon.. and of course,the pizookie! they can't take enough of the pizookie.. And we loved the clam chowder on the sourdough bread. The service was kind of slow compared to other locations especially when we got there it wasn't that busy.  Noticed that other tables got their food first eventhough we came and ordered ahead of them. Place was clean but it would be nice that they make sure to remove all the napkins that drops on the floor as I almost slide when I was trying to get in the booth and sit.  I don't think they would want there customers hurt. The good thing about this location is that it was close to the mall.. easy access for us."
Paul G.,"Orange, CA",9,71,1,2.0,3/22/2011,"Food great, service ok, patio really bad. We were seated next t the exit to the street and the staff more or less continuously went out on smoke or other break and left the 'cat flap' open so we got a nice cold breeze every time. I got up about 12 times during our meal to correct this"
Helen S.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",236,485,,4.0,1/30/2011,I love going to BJs for their happy hour menu!  I recommend their buffalo wings (YUM) and their flatbread pizzas!  It does get a bit crowded on weekends but great place for food and drinks.
Kris C.,"Anaheim, CA",164,28,15,3.0,1/27/2011,"The brea location is smaller than other locations. The bar doesnt have any bench-style tables, and the group of people that come here are very diverse. The only reason I go to Bj's is for the delicious beer, food, and great atmosphere. I'm not too fond of the brea location compared to the west covina one. The server's aren't as friendly and personable."
