Lo M.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",0,2,,1.0,1/2/2015,"Ridiculous front service. Went here for lunch with my cousin and let me tell you I'm not the oldest looking person in the world but I'm 20 years old and I've always gotten how I look like I'm 15, 16, etc. The place wasn't very busy and I told the blonde at the desk a table for two and she said she'll call us when our table is ready. Let's see a party of three who came in after us got seated first, another party of two, and a party of 5. Not until I had to ask the woman in the front AGAIN for a table for two. They did not even acknowledge we were sitting there waiting while person after person walked in and got seated and there was no one waiting with us! Probably thinking theyre young so we don't care about them. Listen, age doesn't necessarily mean you have more money. I had plenty of cash in my wallet to pay for the whole section if I wanted to. Secondly, the woman then seats us at a table that has spilt water all over the floor in a dark corner when there were plenty of other tables open. I've been going to this location for the past three years since going to school at CSUF and I'm done coming here. Why would I go out to eat if I had no money? I'd rather take my business to the other BJ's over the hill in Puente Hills who actually appreciates my business. Ridiculous. I don't care if I look 10 years old or 80! You're supposed to treat everyone who walks through that door the same!"
Paul K.,"Bandera, TX",379,553,284,5.0,1/22/2011,"I've had bad experiences at other BJs', but the service this night was top notch.  Our server, Kevin, displayed exemplary service, so much that I told his manager before we left.  I actually paid for my drinks and appetizers with gift cards from a previous visit at a different location that was less than perfect.  Come to think of it, I had a bad experience at this one about a year ago when a server didn't bring me back my change at all (which was around 9 bucks for a $30-ish tab).  But this experience makes up for it.  And because one appetizer was late out of the oven (my beer made me forget about the fact), the server offered on his own to remove it from my meal.  Why can't more restaurants have good, old fashioned, honest service?"
Jon K.,"Monterey Park, CA",5,72,5,4.0,8/25/2008,"Had lunch here with a group of people on a Monday around noon.  The food was great. The waitress keep our glasses full with refills. The food came out in reasonable timing.   We were lucky their wasn't a wait.  Friday lunch is usually a long wait.  Recommendations: 1 - Sesame chicken salad. (the mandarin oranges make it taste so good) 2 - Grilled chicken pasta. (Rotelle noodles with grilled chicken) 3 - Clam Chowder (hot and rich tasting) 4 - Chicken Fettuccini alfredo (Fettuccini noodles in a creamy Alfredo sauce topped with  blackened chicken breast...yummy). The pizzas are good too, but takes a little longer.   If you ever get a chance, try the beer sampler."
Serena L.,"Yorba Linda, CA",4,47,6,4.0,5/21/2011,Haven't been to this place in a long time. Came here to meet a friend for a quick bite on Saturday.  I had the seared tuna salad and she had the chicken pesto flat bread.  Both were very good.  The tuna Salad was large and had more tuna pieces than I expected.  The ginger Asian vinaigrette saddest good.  Didn't really understand the three drops of wasabi on the corners of the plate since no soy sauce was offered.  The flat bread was crunchy and not too oily.  They also have a small brunch menu on Saturday and Sunday but we opted to not try those items.
Carrie B.,"Fullerton, CA",73,47,37,5.0,2/22/2011,"Had a party there this past weekend for my hubby's 40th It was great! The food was wonderful, we had the pizza and salad buffet and the service was terrific."
David K.,"Seattle, WA",15,50,11,4.0,1/6/2009,"This is mostly a happy hour review.  Appetizers 2 bucks off, beers $1 off, and I'm sure 1 or 2 bucks off cocktails.  half off personal pizzas.  I suggest getting the nachos, and don't forget to ask for salsa and jalapenos on the.  This is a huge portion with plenty of their piranha ale chili on the bottom along with chips, sour cream, olives, pico de gallo.  you can add chicken for a buck or two more if you'd like.  very cheesy.  one person cannot finish it all and great to munch on while you sip on some brews. pizza was ok.  i didn't think it was that great. they also brew their own root beer, and i thought it was good.  not the best, but not bad for a chain place.  their berry cider however was gross and tasted like a diet diet fruit 7up. jer. red.  strong beer.  i personally like their porter, and am not a big fan of their hef.  dont' forget to ask what seasonal beers they got. They have some interesting bottled beers with lindeman's, gulden draak and some others.  i rec the gulden draak.  10.5% and it packs one hell of a punch mang without any of that bitterness.  very malty and darkly sweet (if that make sense to you).  i've gotten the wings and tenders and they were also ok. service is pretty friendly(at the bar) for the most part, and i've never really had a problem.  sometimes the bartenders would hook it up w/ a free drink or two. one time we got free chips and salsa.  this was when i used to go a lot though before school. my rec. is that if you ever go there and there's a long wait, go sit at the bar area.  there are tables there too, and you can order from the menu. 4 stars for being a decent chain with a good happy hour food wise."
Destry H.,"Alameda, CA",188,207,998,4.0,5/29/2008,"All that I can say is that every time that my wife and I are in Brea,CA. (and that's at least twice a year) We have to stop by BJ's to have lunch...my wife and I cannot resist having their clam chowder with our meal, regardless of the entree! It's just that good....sometimes their service suffers a little because they are so busy, but I've never really had a bad dining experience here! They have something for all ages and appetites. Another plus is, it's located close to shopping so you can walk it all off and not feel guilty for treating yourself to really well prepared food and overall dining experience!"
Stacy W.,"Novato, CA",25,7,,3.0,7/10/2009,"I came here on a Wednesday night with a few friends during my trip down to Los Angeles & Orange County. It seemed to be packed but we only had to wait around 15 minutes for a nice outdoor table. The menu seemed to have nearly EVERYTHING an ""American"" restaurant could have to offer, from salads to deep-dish pizza to 1/2 pound burgers.  I ordered a 1/2 pound Cuban Burger, which is served sandwich-style with a good helping of ham, pickles, mustard, Swiss cheese, and mayonnaise. It came with a side of some of the best french fries I have ever had. Thick and flavorful, they complemented the burger great. All in all this is a good place to go with a big group of people, fairly casual and a pretty positive atmosphere."
Dori D.,"Fullerton, CA",1,36,11,1.0,5/3/2011,"BJ's food is okay but it's pricey, long wait, packed parking, and the service is no bueno.  I took my girls to eat there.  Our food arrived and we had nothing to drink and our waitress was no where around.  I finally walked over to the waitress station to find our waitress and try to get water.  I found her and told her we had nothing to drink and our food had arrived, she got flippant and said she'd send someone over to take our drink order.  I wasn't happy with that and If the manager hadn't stepped in to appease me, I was ready to walk out and leave the food on the table sans drinks.  I won't go back to BJs."
Rob B.,"Yorba Linda, CA",0,11,,2.0,9/12/2010,"It occurred to me last night who the ideal customer is for BJs.  I had plenty of time to think about it, because we called to get a reservation, which they don't give, but we were told to get there by 6:00 and there would be no problem--which in all fairness, it probably WASN'T a problem for them that we were seated 35 minutes later...  But it DID end up being a problem for them that we got our two simple pizzas 45 minutes later.   I used the large aluminum pizza dish off a neighboring table like a giant frisbee/ninja star to get the attention (take off the leg) of our server, who hobbled off bleeding and dying to get the manager.  When the manager came crawling up on hands and knees ducking his unfortunate head and jabbering incoherently about mercy, we cut his noggin off with a butterknife and sent it back to the kitchen  on a pizzookie plate with a napkin taped to his nose that said ""PIZZA--NOW.  Table 8"". Actually, most of that just happened in my head while we were waiting for our food, I'm pretty sure.  But I still do believe we are all only one late-pizza-step away from being mass murderers some days.   So the manager was nice about us having to wait 1 hour and 20 minutes total to get our food, and took about $15.00 off our $45.00 total bill.  More importantly, he apologized profusely and sincerely in grand style, which I valued at about $30.00 so in effect we ate for free and he got to live. Dinner and a show on a budget.  A win win.  Of course my daughter got to the game an hour late, and she wasn't going to be paying the bill anyway, so it was probably a win-win-lose.  Ok, and the other people with her who were in the same boat, so the final count was probably, win-win-lose-lose-lose-lose-lose. The ideal customer?  The guy who is on a first and probable last date with a girl out of his league.  Assuming she's only going out with him because she's hungry, she won't say no when the hostess tells him it'll be 15 minutes, nor will she leave 20 minutes later when the hostess says it'll be 10 to 12 minutes longer, and when they're seated 15 minutes after that, she'll be so relieved to finally be sitting at the table with a menu with stomach growling that wild cannibals couldn't remove her from your presence.  And the waiter is on your side, dude.  Small talk, oozing around the tables, hey maybe a salad, hey maybe some appetizers, cool; whoops forgot the salad, I'm on it dude...  There's never a moment when she realizes she's going to be with you for THREE HOURS to eat a pizza til it's over.  Of course, it's BJs deep dish, and it's good pizza.  So there's that too.  And beer.  More beer than you can drink.  Maybe by the time she's finally full of both, she finds you more attractive than a white chocolate macademia nute pizzookie.  Maybe my cat will speak Latin.  You never know. My three best tips to you, ideal customer of BJ's, is (1) to come with a list of conversation topics, (2) letting her know you are an 'acquired taste'; and (3) if she still isn't convinced after 3 hours of tasting you,first get your server's attention by grabbing the pizza tin . . ."
Frances L.,"Orange County, CA",67,3,,1.0,9/10/2011,"I have always loved this type of restaurant and have even gone to this location frequently several years ago. However, I  recently made birthday reservations at this location with my family and friends. Unexpectedly, on the day of my birthday celebration, my dad was hospitalized from a heart attack, which goes without saying, caused a setback in plans that day. I called ahead to notify the hostess and she mentioned a 15 minute leeway. I show up 3 minutes later than the leeway time and the hostess Kayla coldly explains that they gave up my reservations and despite my circumstances, there was nothing she would or could do. (This was the same hostess who coldly refused to greet my dad and me the week before.) Truthfully, such rude service and lack of flexibility in the face of the most extreme unfortunate circumstances makes me never want to visit this restaurant ever again."
Jason Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",170,213,8,4.0,11/13/2010,"It's all about Happy Hour here.  BJ's is like a quieter version of TGIF.  It seems more upscale but the prices are pretty similar.  They have their own beer (try the Jeremiah Red and don't bother with the Pumpkin Ale), and provide nutritional information on everything on their menu.  Service was good, just expect to wait 10-15 minutes on weekends if you have a group of 4 or more."
Susan N.,"Santa Ana, CA",21,67,149,3.0,3/27/2008,"Actually, i've been here before several times but this recent visit that I had just the other night compelled me to have to write a review for it.   I discovered that they have chili cheese fries which is quite yummy!!! I usually only like non-shredded cheese (the nacho cheese kind of cheese) but for this particular appetizer, the cheese was really good.  It is basically potato wedges smothered with melted shredded cheese with chili topped with sour cream and chives.  I loved how the cheese stayed melted and didn't dry up so fast. Must try that when you go there!  If you like pizzas, I'd suggest the Great White as first choice.  It is deep dish pan pizza with lots of carbs so if you don't want a lot of flour, then you won't like this. It is very filling.  My friends and I had pizza, spinach artichoke dip, and chili cheese potato wedges with a pitcher of Berry Cider.   The dip - don't get it, it isn't all that great and they serve more chips than they do dip.  Dip doesn't come portioned to the size of chips that are served.   If you want good dip, I love RED ROBIN'S Spinach Artichoke dip. Yum!  Dessert- I am not a sweet eater but OMG the white macadamian (if that's how you spell it) pazookie with vanilla ice cream is to die for! That's amazing to me being that I am not into sweets at all. I loved the softness of the cookie. We ordered the ice cream to be separate instead of on top of the cookie.  They gipped us on our ice cream portion though but all in all, great dessert. Just talking about it makes me want some!  Last thing - Service is terrible here.  We waited a long time to get our check and getting our change too so we just left cash instead since the wait was too long. I don't think it's the entire place, it's just our waiter was terrible. Darn it, I forgot his name!"
Alyssa M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,,1.0,6/18/2011,"I went to this BJs at least once a month. The last time I went to this BJs will be my last, not at just this location but at all BJs.  My friends and I received a raw dough pizza, when we asked to get another pizza that is fully cooked our waitress rudely said, ""That is how our pizza is."" The pizza was clearly not cooked, the dough was still raw and the cheese was not melted. It looked horrible. The bad customer service just topped it off. Never going there again!"
Carl A.,"Fullerton, CA",3,23,,3.0,2/18/2011,"We went to BJ's for a casual burger after the lunch crowd had left so it would be leisurely. We had service that was friendly. The California Burger was juicy and tasty with avocado and green chilies. It comes with a choice of thin or thick fries. I chose the thin and my wife chose thick, both of which were tasty and flavorful. The drawbacks were the chips and salsa, the waiter forgetting to refill water glasses, and stale chips. The salsa had an off putting flavor, to me. The wife said it wasn't great but it was OK. The waiter said that he would bring fresh chips but I guess he forgot. It couldn't have been the customers that took his attention because they were minimal. And I guess he figured that we had enough water for the day. They didn't forget the check though. Now I must admit that we were there for a tasty burger (half pound) and that came to us beautifully but there are other things that go with service and they did not live up to what they could have done. I dislike having to continually remind the wait staff that they have forgotten something. BJ's is where I go for quick and tasty food and I will go to this one again to see if this was a fluke (it is not the first time it has happened at BJ's). Don't get me wrong, I am not complaining over water. I am complaining because the wait staff is not as attentive and proactive as it could be. After all, that is part of the fee for eating anywhere. You pay a fee for not having to get up to serve yourself. BJ's is suppose to make you comfortable not cause you to find your particular waiter among a sea of others to ask for service. I like the food at BJ's but service to the customer suffered today"
The G.,"Whittier, CA",0,7,1,3.0,8/16/2011,Ok. If you haven't been to bj's to eat then you have been living somewhere under a rock in so. Cal. Over all the food is good. I recommend the roasted chicken with a pint(or two)of jeramiah red. Be warned the service will either  be really good or horrible. Enjoy!!!!!!
David G.,"Anaheim, CA",63,157,103,4.0,4/1/2011,We love to get the blackened chicken potato and order a pizzokee for dessert. Their micro brew beer is also work the trip especially the Nutty Brunette
Teresa Y.,"San Francisco, CA",147,647,33,3.0,5/8/2008,"Typical BJ's location. It was a busy night with the crowds cheering on the Lakers. BOOOOO LAKERS!!! Got myself the cilantro pesto pizza. Yummy like always! Paired with a Jeremiah Red and a big appetizer sampler. This location has a good layout. I like the outdoor seating... lots of heat lamps to keep you warm! Parking is everywhere, so no need to stalk people coming out of the restaurant.  Three stars because the service was ehhhh. The server only came by a few times - once to get our drink order, next for food order and one more time to give the check."
Steven R.,"Chicago, IL",53,461,2,4.0,12/31/2007,"I know, I know; it's a chain. However, this is one chain I will proudly admit patronizing because they are one of the few chain restaurants that appeal to something I consider a food group: beer.  Yeah, not in a fat mid-westerner or frat boy way, but I like beer.  I'm not talking a 12 pack of Bud Light as much as I'm talking a few micro brews or some Belgian ales.  BJ's has both. The food is decent.  It is self-described as comfort food, which I guess works.  They have meatloaf, pot roast and chicken.  The pizza is tasty although comes with a lot of bread.  The burgers and sandwiches are all pretty good, especially my favorites the blackened chicken sandwich.  Another plus is that they have two happy hours, one of which runs during a time when you might actually be drinking anyway, Sun. - Thurs., 10pm - Close.  Also I know you used to be able to get 6-packs of the BJs brews although I'm not sure if you still can. The beers are all outstanding.  This particular BJ's is an actual brewery, so besides having the standard lineup of BJs beers, they have a few exclusive brews like their Sesame Wheat, different Pale Ales, a barley wine variety, Oktoberfest, Pumpkin Ale, and even a cask ale which is usually the oak pale ale.  They all have weird/random names so I can't really remember them and they get rotated out.  Add this to the fact that they carry Sierra Nevada varieties according to season (Bigfoot Ale) and an array of bottled Belgium beers, and it's usually hard for me to leave this place before closing time.  One of the best things is the monthly beer tasting night.   For about $18 a head, you get to taste about 13 different beers and you usually get a free beer glass from one of the featured breweries.  After it's all over, they'll usually let you buy pints or bottles of the leftover for like $2 or so.  The lectures can be a little rough at times but overall it's a good experience as each month has a different theme like ""winter warmers"" or ""wheat beers"", etc.  Yes, you can smile or ask nicely and a server might pour you a little extra sample.  It probably doesn't sound like much for the money, but trust me, the only way you won't get wasted is if you don't swallow each sample. Probably the most annoying thing is the bar area, where you're at your wait person's mercy for beer refills unless you have cash for the bar.  Beyond this, I love coming to eat here knowing I can have something besides the boring ol' Heineken, Guinness, Pyramid lineup of most chains."
Minda w.,"Rowland Heights, CA",327,845,688,3.0,2/11/2010,"BJ's is just what one expects from a good chain store: solid food, nice service, good atmosphere. I'm not particularly crazy about the pizza but it's the pizooki that keeps me coming back =) Mmm...pizooki."
