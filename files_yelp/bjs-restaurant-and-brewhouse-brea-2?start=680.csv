Khelyn C.,"Corona, CA",3,101,35,2.0,10/31/2012,"I usually don't have a problem with BJ's since I often come here for their lunch special; however, my last experience here was not so great. I came with two friends. It took a while for our server to ask us for drinks. Once she came, we all ordered water with a request to have a lemon put in it. She brought out the water.. without lemons and said she'll be right back with the lemons. Again, she came back and took our orders without the lemon. I could let the lemon go, it was not that big of a deal. When she took our order, one of my friends ordered her salad with dressing on the side and to take out the fried onions on top because she's allergic. When her food came out, they totally forgot to even include the dressing on the side and there were fried onions on top of her salad. We didn't want to make a big deal out of it so she just asked her if she can get the dressing as she took out the onions by herself. The biggest thing that got me was that there were no utensils on the table when we arrived and we had to ask for them after our food had already come out. It wasn't a bad dining experience, I just wish the server was more prepared so we didn't have to call her so often to get something for us. Plus, I didn't get my water refilled because she never came back after she told she would come back with water."
Johnny C.,"Whittier, CA",3,29,7,2.0,3/2/2013,"Food is good. I always get the buffalo chicken pizza with a Jeremiah Red beer. Their service is so so a little slow. The waiters have no sense of urgency when it comes to getting your drinks. The last two times I was there. I was on empty for 10-15 min before the waiters came back and asked if I wanted another drink. I finished most of my meal by the time the waiter came around to asked me if I wanted another beer. One of the times I had to call the manager over and let them know how long they were taking,  my waiter was not bringing us drinks. Second time I just left no tip because I wanted a drink and my waiter never came till I was more than half done with my meal. I even told her ""does it always take this long with drinks"" ? Since it was my second bad experience there."
frances p.,"San Diego, CA",4,26,1,5.0,4/27/2008,"One might ask, of all the BJ's I've been to why write a review particularly in this area? If one must know, it's because the servers (note the plural) here are so nice!! Okey, nice is such a simple and over-used word, but I can't think of any other word to describe them at the moment. I've been to a lot of different BJ chains (as a matter of fact, one of my friends from school used to work at a different location) but this crew is just different. The bottom line is: i get free Pizzokie here -- 3 TIMES with 3 DIFFERENT servers, and its not even my birthday!! I'm not gloating or whatnot, but c'mon if that happened to you, you will give this place 5 stars too right? Macadamia Pizzokie and booze  are my kryptonite =)  But in all seriousness, even if I don't get free deserts whenever I come here, the servers are still nice. Very attentive and accommodating to the customers needs. And with that they really deserve 5 stars"
Karen L.,"La Mirada, CA",111,152,33,5.0,7/27/2006,"Okay, well I'm sure that everyone has been to BJ's at least a few times in their lifetime... but this is one of the larger, more popular restaurants that actually has good food and good seasonal beer!!  Things I always get there: The Sweet Pig (I'd die for Hawaiian pizza any day!), Chili Cheese Fries (yum on their beer dipped chili beans), and when they have it seasonally, Pumpkin Beer!! =D I haven't really tried a lot of their other food items because I love Hawaiian pizza and their chili cheese fries wayyyyyyyyy too much to pass them up. But I've heard from good friends that their other items are for the most part, equally yummy."
Carlos R.,"Upland, CA",38,127,31,3.0,9/7/2008,"This place has it's ups and downs for me... The up, The Brew-house Blonde PWNS my soul. I love this beer like no other. The finish is just perfect for my palate. The food, is Ok. Fav dishes are the SESAME CHICKEN SALAD, the Classic Baked Potato and the pizza is pretty good too. Finish with a Pizzookee. *unbuttons jeans as belly grows just thinking about it* The down... I used to frequent this place with a special gal (special at the time) this was as she said ""our spot"" and we would share a pitcher or 4 and some artichoke spinach dip. Now when ever I go there I think about that and it bothers me. I know it's retarded. The real issue is that I invariably  end up getting completely sloshed trying to drown the sorrows. /emo rant But yeah...that Blonde is the SHIT!!!  The Brunette special gal, not so much. p.s. if you love any of their beers. The Growler is a wise investment :o)"
Mitchell F.,"Hawthorne, CA",85,264,1,5.0,10/10/2006,Love the deep dish pizzas.  The pizza I get is the great white and you gotta get a Jermiah Red to accompany it.  The pizookie's are pretty good also if you still got room for desert.     They have pretty good happy hours.  I know one of the times is after 10pm sun - thurs it's half off mini pizzas and $1 off pints of beer.  Not too sure about the after work happy hour times.
Janey Y.,"Alhambra, CA",187,565,253,4.0,1/1/2010,"Definitely consider coming by here during the lunch hour because that's when their entrees are pretttyyyyy cheap.  We ordered the Chicken tender with fries (the waiter didn't ask us how we wanted our fries although we had choices), the unlimited soup and salad, and an Oreo pizookie.  After ordering the meal, I found it kind of funny how the waiter insisted on telling us that the unlimited soup and salad could not be shared between us.  Haha, darn!  But seriously, do you really think you can lose profit for salad and soup?  When my friend first ordered the brocolli/cheddar soup, the waiter gave her a big bowl.  However, when she requested clam chowder, he decided to give her a smaller bowl.  Honestly,  when I go to Souplantation, I *would like* to try at least 3 soups... My friends thought that if she ordered a third bowl, he would come back with an even smaller bowl! haha, overall, the price isn't so bad and the service is great!"
Lisa N.,"Redondo Beach, CA",62,55,2,4.0,10/18/2007,"I'd give 4.5 stars if I could. This place is good for meals, but it's actually one of my favorite places for late night happy hours.  Their brewed beers are pretty good.  They have a nice assortment...from really light blondes to super dark dark lagers.  My choice?  Get the Jeremiah Red....the alcohol content is higher than others and *ahem...it'll mess you up. The pizzas aren't bad, either.  I'm a sucker for the sweet pig.  Oh yeah...and it's nice how the personal pizzas are half off during happy hour, from what i remember.   Pizookies are a must.  If you didn't know, they can do half-half of certain cookies if you can't make up your mind.  I really like the peanut butter and the oreo cookie combo, but a lot of others like the oatmeal cookie.  Whatever your heart desires, friends.... I know there are plenty of other BJ's around, but the one in Brea sticks out to me.  The servers seem to be a little friendlier and the atmosphere a little warmer.  I go here for a consistent good time.  Perhaps you should too."
OC B.,"Placentia, CA",16,4,,4.0,5/16/2011,I've had there pizza before here but today I had a chicken club sandwich and it did not disappoint and like always there pazookie is just bomb!!!
Tom C.,"Redondo Beach, CA",62,560,35,2.0,5/31/2010,"This location sucks. I like BJ's pizza, their beer is good too. But this Brea location was terrible when I visited today.  Service and food was so sloooooow. Im disappointed because its usually a great place to get pizza, salad, and beer."
Roland E.,"Anaheim, CA",0,13,,1.0,2/11/2013,bad service. Techno service just doesn't work.  They order your drink on an Ipad and stand ten feet from the bar.  After 5 minutes they look at you surprised that no one has brought the drink and then get it themselves.
Manuel Y.,"Fullerton, CA",0,3,,1.0,4/7/2013,"Very poor service! Don't care how good the food is or how fun the place is, their host and hostess staff is horrible. They are so busy talking to each other, they always seem to be bothered to seat you. What a shame that this does not train their staff better. This place really has too many people up front so it invites screwing off. Having tried this place several times, I I am finally ready to give up!"
Rosa C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,11,,3.0,1/20/2013,"Bring back the ""real"" deep dish pizza! We LOVE BJ's deep dish pizza, but when we ordered it today... not only did it arrive on a plate (not in a pan), it was also not piping hot as usual. The crust was also very deflated looking -- more like a pizza made using a pizza stone, not in a pan! We told the server that he MUST have brought us the wrong pizza. The server was very gracious and brought over the manager, who told us they no longer serve the deep dish pizzas in the pan because it was a poor conductor of heat. Really?! Because a plate is better?! The pizza we were served on a plate was room temperature! The manager was very nice & told us that we could request that the pizza be served in a pan. We did make that request & enjoyed a real deep dish pizza the way it should be made & served! Only 3 stars were given because of the poor pizza quality the first time around. Service was great all around."
Mozuz T.,"Whittier, CA",3,10,3,5.0,1/14/2011,"I've been to the bj's in cerritos and brea. I must say that both places are great. Great service, great food, and great atmoshpere. The artichoke dip is awesome with those red, white, and black chips. Good beer too. I don't know the name of the red ale but it taste really good. Also, both locations the waitresses were very nice. Food didn't take a long time. No complaints about these two locations. I would recommend to anyone who wants try it...TRY IT!"
Caroline L.,"Fullerton, CA",38,131,2,4.0,3/12/2010,"pizzzzzzzzza. pizza! pizza is one of my favorite foods.  and bj's does a great job with making me happy because their pizza is SO GOOD. it has great crust. great toppings, great cheese. and it is a bit oily but not overly oily like my old favorite pizza hut pan pizza. i've never been disappointed in their pizzas.  i think their other things like pastas and sandwiches or even baked potato are aiite, but i would come here and definitely order pizzzzzza. i especially love their BJ's Works, and the BBQ Chicken. MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM­MMMMMMMMMMMMMM! even their appetizer pizzas are pretty good! the only con to this is that my stomach hurts later cuz i stuff too many huge slices in my mouth and then add a pizookie on top of it ! booo stomach for being too small! PS: DO not confuse this with real chicago deep dish pizza! that's relegated to Giordano's in Chicago! that is Real deep dish! the crust is flaky, almost biscuity, and in a deep pan, so that the inside is Filled up to the top with Cheese, and Toppings!!!!! its Amazing!"
matt h.,"Anaheim, CA",0,41,1,4.0,2/4/2011,they have some good lunch specials for a very good price... i havent been here in the evening. Had a bloody mary here once and it wasnt that great. Its not a bad place at all.  Their beer is decent ... nothing amazing about it but its not bad at all.
CHAUSTER S.,"Anaheim Hills, CA",15,221,180,1.0,7/6/2012,"thai shrimp lettuce was too salty,barbeque chicken salad=chicken  was too cold and chewy, ahi poke was too salty,chicken lettuce wrap was too salty"
Jenifer H.,"Fullerton, CA",330,82,82,3.0,2/16/2012,"This place is so hit or miss. Never consistent and I have been here a lot.  I have to say that the waitress was very nice.  But the food......  I ordered Spaghetti  with  meat sauce.  The girl who brought it out said, ""Here's the spaghetti with .............""  She stopped there.  And when I took a look, it was obvious why she did not complete her  sentence.  There was a huge plate of spaghetti with an itsy bitsy dab of sauce and tomato chunks.  No meat whatsoever.   When the waitress returned I explained to her that this was the first time I've  ordered this dish and that I would never order it again if this was the meat sauce.  She took a look and said that she would go to the kitchen and get some more sauce.  She came right back with a tiny condiment dish of sauce.  She then said this is all we have now but the cook is making more!  Aha!  Now it makes sense.  The cook did not want to go through the trouble of making more sauce so he gave me the bottom of the bowl and thought he would get away with it.  Anyway, the waitress finally brought out the serving of sauce that should have come with the plate.  By this time I was over it:("
Jordan P.,"Tustin, CA",42,606,194,4.0,6/1/2009,"Place was pretty fun and relaxed on a Sunday afternoon. The Brewhouse Blonde & Hef were very tasty. I wanted to try their ""WIT NIT"" seasonal beer but the keg got tapped out! Damn. Anyway deep dish pizza is Always good!"
CC P.,"Cook, IL",0,6,,2.0,9/21/2010,"I booked this BJ's for my rehearsal lunch for my wedding and this was the worst vendor my husband and I worked with the entire wedding. We put in our order, they drafted the contract, we signed it and then they were supposed to sign it and send it back to us so we would have a copy. Instead, the worker couldn't even figure out how to use the fax machine. He assured us our order was in and we were all set so we let it slide.  A few weeks before our wedding, we call to double check our order. Employee #1 couldn't find our order and said that there was no reservation in the system. We were handed off to employee # 2 who found our order, but had 3 of the 4 pizzas and 2 of the 3 appetizers wrong. He asked us to call back because they were going into a staff meeting. WTH? So, we called back and talked to employee #3 who reads us our correct order and says we're all set.  Fastforward to the day of our event and we arrive with our entire bridal party to find that the patio had not been set up. We waited with our bridal party for 15-20 minutes before we were seated. No apologies from the manager, just a HUGE attitude - almost like we were inconveniencing HIM!!! Once we were out on the patio it was sweltering.  The food was fine and at the end of the day we were given some free pazookies and undercharged, but we were still pretty upset as this was our rehearsal dinner.  This BJ's is probably fine for dinner, but think twice before having an event there!!!"
