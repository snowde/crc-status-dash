Carrie W.,"Orange, CA",0,3,,1.0,8/29/2012,"So far, this is the only ""one star"" I have ever given.  I have had a lot of poor service and experiences at this particular BJ's.  The first time, our large party was seated outside.  We were seated next to a metal gate that they employees used.  Everytime they opened it, it slammed shut.  It was very disruptive to our entire party.  Last time, we did the call ahead seating.  That was a joke.  We got there when we said we would.  They said it would be another 20 min.  After waiting 45 minutes, I checked in at the desk again.  She said ""Call Ahead"" seating is not a guarantee.  An hour and 15 min. later, we were finally seated."
Carolyn M.,"Cypress, CA",11,18,,4.0,1/17/2009,"BJ's is your typical Sports Bar and Grill type place. Even if the lay out is different, once you've been to one - you've been to them all. It's loud (w/ people and music) and it can generally be pretty crowded. The wait staff is only so/so and I think this is b/c it's comprised mostly of college students. So, don't go for the atmosphere - go for the food. I prefer ""regular"" or New York style pizza but Chicago style (or ""deep dish"") has it's merits. It's much more filling, more of a meal. The fact that it's messy to hold makes you want to dig in w/ a fork and knife - go ahead, that's pretty traditional in the Chicago area.  The ""menu pizzas"", as I call them, are the pizzas that come w/ toppings created by the chef and christened w/ some kind of name (Hawaiian, Meat Lovers, etc.). These are pretty Good. The toppings make sense and are generally well portioned. You could also make your own, which i suggest doing more often than not. The other menu items are Good but a little odd: meatloaf? Who the hell serves meatloaf? And Pot Roast! I haven't had that in, like, 15 years! I wonder how often these items are ordered...Anyway, suffice to say that there are MANY choices to make from this menu. Which is a little annoying for me but will be a blessing for those who don't care for the pizza. All the salads are Good - EXCEPT for the Sesame Chicken Salad. I had a good laugh looking at the menu recently, when I noticed that the salad was described as ""unforgettable."" ACTUALLY, it's very forgettable - in fact, just forget that it's even there on the menu. The salad is bland, watery and overdressed w/ salad dressing. Try the Cobb, it's way better. The sandwiches are also generally Good. And they all come w/ your choice of seasoned (think Jack in the Box) thick-cut fries or crispy shoe-string. I suggest you order one style and you lunch mate orders the other so you can compare notes (I like them both, so it's Sofie's Choice for me!) When it comes to desserts, I am no wallflower. I will eat just about anything - happily. The Handcrafted Root Beer Float is AMAZING. BJ's makes it's own root beer, so you know you are in for a treat. And the vanilla bean ice cream they serve on it is rich and creamy. Now, the ""famous"" Pazookie (I hate that name) is OK. A lot of people will go on and on about it but I say Whatever. It's a cookie baked in a deep dish pan, topped w/ vanilla bean ice cream. The ice cream is better than the cookie. The poor thing comes out uneven and gooey in the middle but crispy (greasy?) on the outside. It doesn't help that the ice cream instantly starts to melt and makes the cookie soggy. What you'll want to do is come here with a couple of friends that enjoy sports. Order some very tasty beers and a nice selection of appetizers. Then, sit back and enjoy your afternoon/evening. Don't go on a Sunday after church hours - there will be a swarm of old ladies, babies, kids, frazzled mothers and depressed dads sucking the life out of the joint. Do yourself a favor!"
Natalie C.,"Fullerton, CA",96,35,4,4.0,1/14/2009,"I've never had a bad experience at this place yet. The food is good and the drinks are even better. The cajun pasta dish is a fave for me and my bf. I'm not a beer drinker but I always order a pitcher of the berry burst cider. Yeah it's girly, but it's damn good. The servers are always nice and fast. Nice atmosphere for hanging out with friends and when we come here, we always spend a good amount of time here. YAY!"
Carlos G.,"Brea, CA",1,20,,4.0,3/19/2010,2nd favorite happy hour in the area. BJs beer is great and the mini pizza's are awesome if you like deep dish pan style. Can get crowded unless you're there early. A must try is the chocolate chip pizzuki!
Dulcia T.,"Diamond Bar, CA",250,162,91,3.0,1/27/2009,"This place is like any other american restaurant, nothing too special. The only thing I come here for is the pizookies! the cookie with the icecream is absolutely a perfect way to end a dinner. I've had the bbq chicken pizza here which was pretty alright, not bad. I've also tried the chicken marsala which was pretty good too, chicken was kind of dry but the sauce kind of made up for it and the mash potato's that came with it was pretty good too. This place is alright, I've had it alot for friends dinner parties and a few times with my beau but other than that I didn't and wouldn't really want to go back there. Food is good and the pizookies are a must have but it wouldn't be on the list of restaurants that I would draw straws for to chose a place to go eat."
Rony H.,"Orange County, CA",15,138,,3.0,10/21/2008,"We had the mini pizza and bjs cobb salad--it was very good.  The pizza was moist on the inside and a bit crispy on the outside.  I think the crust could have been a wee bit more crispy, but the flavor was totally fine.  The cobb salad had enough of each ingredient: the crutons were perfect-- not too hard where it cuts the roof of your mouth and not too uncooked where it tastes like flour.  The lettuce was fine (not like totally crispy but good enough) and the bacon and other ingredients were good. I wish they would hire more professional staff.  The girl manning the seating chart was totally cool, but the guy showing us the seat was kind of airheady.  we asked him if we could sit near the outer rim of the seating since it was such a nice day and he told us ""oh, there's a big group reserved there"" without checking to see.  so we gave up but not a few minutes later, did the pretty older white ladies who walked in behind us sit where we had asked to be reseated!  my guy and i just kind of looked at each other...only a certain race of people sat in the seats where people can see from the parking lot.  so we asked the waitress (when she came to us) to be seated by the outer rim of the patio...she hmmed and mmmed for a good while and reseated us but forevermore had an air of attitudiness.  we just wanted to enjoy the weather!!  the waitress we had (i wont name namesrachael) asked us at the end of the meal if we wanted a pizookie, and since i didn't hear what she said, I asked, a what? she answered "" a pizookie"". and it was silent for a few seconds and she didn't elaborate like we were supposed to know what that was.  sadly to say, my first experience here with the people didn't turn out well as i really enjoyed the food.  they have a flatscreen tv in the patio so if you want to watch the game (like it was on Sunday) it will add to the enjoyment.  perhaps i can try another bjs.  really loved the food there...."
Jason Y.,"Irvine, CA",0,30,,1.0,12/20/2010,"I would've give a zero if there is a zero on Yelp. I decided to come in on a Sunday to give this place a try since they have many selection of Deep Dish Chicago Style Pizzas. I went inside to order a Vegetarian only with only Mushrooms and Tomatoes Chees piazza. The guy took my order looked clueless, and also counting his tips infront of me.. acting like he's a big shot for some reason. Then he gave me the receipt and i sat down to wait for my pizza. I waited for 20-30 minutes, and it was busy inside and no one seems to care why i'm sitting down. then i got up around 40 minutes and asked the manager in glasses, for my piazza. he then went into the back and 5 minutes later a different person brought me the pizza. I opened the pizza expecting my order again with mushrooms and tomatoes. but there were pepperoniza, meatballs, and mushrooms on my pizza. As again they seems to be very careless to what the customer wants, I will never go back there again !! People who spend top dollar on BJs, you are out of your freaking mind!"
carolyna e.,"Fullerton, CA",1,8,1,5.0,12/17/2008,I went here a few times. The staff was highly proffesional not rude. The food is always good as well.Bjs is always the same every time i go. Always same quality.
Heather P.,"San Francisco, CA",220,178,2,4.0,5/31/2009,"Usually come here during Happy Hour which is pretty good actually. They have mini pizzas for 5 bucks and beers for 3 and some change. This place is also a brewery by the way, and I have to say, their beers are pretty damn good. Ive tried all of them, but like the Hefe the best. Their gold beer is good too, and easiest to drink while scarfing food in your face. The service is awesome as well; ask and you shall receive. Seating may be minimal towards the end of happy hour (615-7pm), so standing may be one of your choices. Whatevs though! Good food and beer = well worth it."
Steve W.,"La Mirada, CA",429,79,186,3.0,6/26/2009,"Love the restaurant but can never go because the wait is TOO LONG. They need to expand and put in more rooms and tables. FOUR TIMES and even after 9pm we were told the wait was an hour. We won't try again, big waste of time."
Sarah H.,"Anaheim, CA",35,53,11,4.0,2/27/2012,"Love BJ's pizza!  I attended a large birthday celebration here and the service was great.  The hosts ordered the salad and pizza (on their large event/take out menu), and the food just kept coming!  Plenty of salad for everyone to have seconds and thirds, and plenty of pizza (4 types) also (more than enough pizza! They took like 4 pizzas home)!  The garden salad was fresh, crisp, and delicious.  The pizzas were fantastic!  YUM!  Servers were out on the patio all the time bringing drinks and taking away dirty/finished dishes.  It was a great experience and I would definitely recommend BJ's for any large event like this!!"
Hion L.,"Fullerton, CA",469,665,412,2.0,11/11/2010,"Have you ever had a moment where you wish wouldn't have forgotten something?  One of the things that I keep forgetting is how bad the service is here.I think that out of the 5 times that I have been here at this location, service was decent once, and subpar the other 4 times.  Food is consistently late and servers are usually overwhelmed.  Once our pizza took over 30 min and I kept asking my server to check on it and he kept stating it was coming.  He stated that our pizza, the cheeseburger pizza takes a bit longer than the other pizzas.  What kind of BS is that? Then after 30 min, he stated that they had to remake it since it was burned. I asked to see the pizza, and he stated it was thrown away. I also had to ask to see the manager twice before he came to our table.  He was very apologetic and comped our pizza.  But when the pizza finally came, it was cold so I had to have them reheat it. WOW. Kinda hard to find a place that fails so consistently yet stays in business."
Judy K.,"Orange, CA",81,92,8,3.0,4/17/2009,"I haven't been here for the food but the bar is nice. Drinks are over priced and weak but the bartender made it completely clear that he thought I was very attractive and made me drinks and shots on the house all night so, all in all, good experience. This review is pointless."
Jess P.,"Las Vegas, NV",53,273,59,4.0,3/2/2011,you come to BJ's for the beer and stay for the pizookie...and that's exactly what i did- i tried the new berry cider- it was yummy and super light- its gonna be great for spring and summer nights!! i got the traditional pizookie and the fact that it was gone in like 3 nanoseconds should indicate it was spot on! oh and the guy who helped us out (i feel super bad but i forgot his name) was freakin awesome!! super attentive and didnt have to ask for anything- he was so intuitive!! def rec!!
Jill C.,"Long Beach, CA",0,23,,2.0,4/22/2012,4/20/2012 Friday Night @ 6pm.... seated quickly & clean & tortilla soup was good = 2 stars  Horrible BBQ Pizza! WHAT? (Isn't that a staple food to BJ's?) Flat warm Root Beer! WHAT? (Isn't that freshly brewed here?) Orange Creme Soda tasted like soap! WHAT is going on? Almost FAIL....D-
April B.,"Yorba Linda, CA",3,30,1,1.0,8/1/2011,"I used to go here and it was decent.  The past 2 times I've been the experience has been miserable!  The waiter put in the wrong order and it took them 30 minutes to bring out the correct order.  This last time they brought me a pizza that was the wrong size, lopsided, and cut inappropriately.  They redid my pizza which was fine, but they made it the wrong way and it tasted of sausage, which was not on the pizza.  The service is terrible, the waitress did refill drinks once, but that's all and the food took exceptionally long to be delivered both times.  Not worth the wait to go to a chain restaurant."
Lina O.,"Orange County, CA",404,485,1970,4.0,6/26/2008,"i like the BJ's restaurant in general. food was good as usual. service was just okay, nothing special. could have been a tad bit better, seeing that it really wasnt that crowded. we had to save room for a pazzooki. half chocolate chip half white chocolate macadamian.  they have good lunch specials (half a sandwich and a salad or soup, mini pizza, half size pasta, etc) plenty of parking since its in the same lot as the brea mall."
Michael G.,"Rowland Heights, CA",18,35,7,3.0,1/12/2009,"well let me tell you that this bj's location is much better than the west covina location. the service was excellent up until we were ready to go. the pizza was awesome, and the beer was ok. we had a pitcher of the nutty brewnette."
Robert F.,"Buena Park, CA",1,324,,1.0,10/29/2010,"Yeah, I'm done with BJ's.  I went there tonight and everything tasted like cafeteria food.  I don't really like pizza, though, so my menu options were limited (though the menu's pretty big).  Indifferent service in an uncomfortably noisy room means the food better be spectacular to make me want to come back, and it was so the opposite of spectacular."
Ashley M.,"Placentia, CA",62,31,13,2.0,8/23/2010,"BJ's has always been my favorite restuarant. I went last night and I'm not sure if I will go back again, or at least not to this location.  I ordered a margarita and pizza with soup. First off, I got the wrong soup. That's ok, mistakes happen and it was probably the chefs fault not the waiters. Then he brings out my margarita. I took a sip, looked down at it and saw a dead fly floating around. I almost gagged. So then I tell the server and he brings me another one. I would think he would  have given the margarita drink complimentary after that, but he did not. I was not a bitch at all about it but I probably should have been. Sometimes i hate being a nice person. Whatever. I ended up tipping 15% instead of my normal 20%. Not that he even deserved that! Probably should not have given him anything then my drink would have been paid for through his damn tip! First bad experience but I will find another BJ's and go there instead."
