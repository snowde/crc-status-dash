Jason T.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",4,14,2,5.0,10/2/2009,"food is good....service is good....yes it is a chain.... But lets talk about the BEER!  BJ's is a brewery afterall.  Go ahead and get a sample of the all the house selections, but please save a little room on your pallet for the seasonal beer.....Oktoberfest.  beautiful amber color, silky smooth texture, light caramel and oak notes...I could not order just one!  Also try their Gran Cru around new years."
Amy S.,"Fullerton, CA",164,197,149,1.0,1/16/2011,"So I just left this brea Bjs and went to the Rowland heights Bjs instead. Let me tell you why. The server wouldn't accept my friends ID because it had a crack in it, so he showed them his social security number and another form he got from the police station with his bday and picture on it. They wouldn't accept it because it wasn't passport or California ID. Keep in mind he is turning 30 in 5 days. So we left and came to the Rowland heights Bjs and they accepted his ID no questions asked. The Rowland heights Bjs is cleaner and brand new anyway and they also have all the regular beers not just the beers they make. Boycott this Bjs it sucks. The rowland heights one is off the azusa exit on the 60"

daniel m.,"San Francisco, CA",191,139,4,5.0,12/17/2006,"The food at BJ's is whatever but once a month there is a beer tasting on the patio of the Brea BJ's.  It's around $20 and you get to ""taste"" 14 or so different beers.  There is someone talking about the beer that you are tasting.  But after several tastes it's hard to pay attention.  When I went they were doing Bock's which were almost all starting off at 6% alcohol.  I had 14 ""tastes"" plus all the free beer I could drink because they ordered too much for the tasting.  Needless to say, going to work was hard the next day.  It was great."
Neto K.,"Placentia, CA",2,10,,4.0,10/21/2011,My bf and I go here alot for late night happy hr. We love the pizza's and beer special. I recommend the spinach artichoke pizza.
Elizabeth T.,"Fullerton, CA",3,32,1,2.0,8/17/2013,"We were a party of eight on a Friday night, so I expected us to have to wait so I tried to make a reservation. I called on Thursday on Thursday in the middle of the afternoon thinking they would not be busy. They left me on hold for 10 minutes. I hung up and called back around 5. No one answered. I called backed later and when I finally spoke with someone I was informed they only took reservations for parties of 10 or more. But I could call ahead seating. We planned to be there about 7 so at 6:30 I called and I was told our wait would be about 10 minutes. When we got there at 7 and checked in I was told our wait would be about 40 minutes. I heard the hostess tell the people in line ahead of me the same thing and they had not called ahead. I told hostess we had called ahead and that I had been told it would be about a 10 minute wait. She apologized but we still had to wait 30 minutes to be seated. We had children with us (the reason we didn't want to wait) and by the time we were finally seated they were tired, bored and hungry, not a good way to start dinner. Our server was okay and the food was average. The good thing was the restaurant was so loud it didn't matter that the kids were loud too."
Stan C.,"West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",64,196,11,4.0,6/22/2007,"The Pizookie rocks...I give 4 stars just because of it.  Vanilla ice cream on a huge white chocolate macadamia nut cookie?  You can't go wrong with that...unless there's a hair in it like Eunice C's. The pizza is ok.  Tastes just like Uno's.   The Tatonka Stout is by far the best beer on the menu.  Bitter, sweet, thick (it's almost a meal in itself), and 8.5% alcohol...tasty."
Eric S.,"Brea, CA",0,109,,5.0,8/16/2010,Love this place! Great food at a great price. Brew their own beer! Always a wait though so call in ahead
Miss V.,"Costa Mesa, CA",14,89,2,3.0,1/18/2007,"BJ has great food! The only thing I dislike is the service here - sometimes! The waiters are usually pay more attention to themeselves & their conversations then their tables.  But the food is great, so it keeps me coming back, maybe not to this particular location but to other BJ places around Cali."
Jennifer L.,"Snohomish, WA",2,54,,3.0,1/27/2007,"The food is OK, and I don't really care for their beer.  The service has been bad every time I've been there, so I've started sitting at the bar.  I think the bartenders are better servers than the actual servers.  Their pizza and baked potatoes are the only really worth eating there.  I also don't really like the setup of the restaurant because it feels like you're eating in a warehouse with blaring music.  At least their happy hour is cheap and they're open relatively late.  But they're definitely not my first choice for dining out."
Jennifer F.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",138,211,27,2.0,1/24/2007,Something about this location I've never felt comfortable here (no matter how many beers I drink).  I don't like the set up they've got and the music is terribly horrible at that bar.  Don't care too much for the Chicago style crust I'd rather share the spinach & artichoke dip.  I definitely love the red ales they got gets ya happy and relaxed.  Try the West Covina location instead for environment & music.
