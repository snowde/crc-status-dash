Haywood J.,"Claremont, CA",2,20,5,1.0,10/16/2016,"Let's say I'm a generous person and every restaurant starts out with five stars, and it's up to them to lose them. Here's how BJ's lost theirs: Cold spinach and artichoke dip: minus one half star Had to ask more than once for both lemonade and tabasco sauce: minus one half star. Had to send incredibly undercooked burger (practically raw) that was ordered medium rare back to the kitchen: minus one star. Had to send second slightly less undercooked burger that was ordered medium rare that the manger brought us personally (you would probably call this one very rare) back to the kitchen: minus one star.  Get third burger, which is sort of properly cooked, and accept that from the manager, only to realize a few minutes later that the bacon on this particular burger was so undercooked that no reasonable human being would eat it: minus one star.  Not having the burger that took three tries for them to not get right taken off of your bill: $12.50. Getting to eat cold chili to go with your bacon-less burger while all of your companions have finished eating: priceless.  I have never been to a BJ's before tonight, and I won't be darkening their doorway again."
Vivian N.,"Ventura, CA",475,495,1734,3.0,5/14/2015,"BJ is your typical American chain restaurant. It's clean and straight forward. I am not a huge fan of their pizza or pasta but I have to say that their appetizers are amazing! Recommendations: 1. Lettuce wrap! (Get two cause one is just not enough hah!) 2. Avocado egg rolls (not as good as The tavern in Ventura but still delish) 3. Nachos (has chili smothered at the bottom) 4. Watermelon Feta Salad (something lighter if you want) I hear the beers on tap are good as well but I did not try any, maybe next time!"
Jim R.,"Orange, CA",38,28,12,1.0,6/5/2017,"Bartender Stacey 303 pays no attention to the guest. We were the only couple at the bar. She took our drink order at first but never came back for our food order. She like to hover around the kitchen exit and talk to other employees. Once the bar got busier a co-worker sat at the bar and she spent majority of her time chitchatting with her instead of attending to the paying guest. She continued to talk about drinking with co-workers, parties and drama about other employees. Completely unprofessional. Good food/beer very poor service!!!"
Antonio L.,"Anaheim, CA",553,552,825,3.0,3/27/2016,"Typical mall parking, so depending on what time of day it is will determine how easy it will be to find parking.  We were lucky to have a friend in the party to regularly use their app and put in our name. We arrived, and our table was ready within 10 minutes. Definitely will download the app! We came for dessert, after visiting some food trucks down the street. We went for the pizookie of course. But my friends wanted to try some other fun desserts. Well, I went for the cookies and cream pizookie, cause I don't recall ever tasting it. It was pretty much a chocolate cookie with cookies and cream whipped cream. Wasn't anything exciting for me. Definitely would go back to either the white chocolate chip macadamia or chocolate chip next time. I wanted a little alcohol and went with the watermelon basil margarita. Bad choice. It did not mix well with the cookie. It was way too sweet and had too big of a kick. Both items I wouldn't go back to again here.  My friends went with the sampler and I tried the monkey bread and that was so much better. They also ordered the baked beignet which was covered with strawberries, it was so light and delicious. Another win for that! Unfortunately my dessert choices were far from delectable. But my friends choices balanced it out the loses and I give them a neutral rating for desserts here.  Our server Chase was pretty cool. Very attentive at first. We arrived an hour before the end of his shift. We received our check, divided up the check, and waited for his return. We hanged across the patio and there he was just sitting there. Another server came by to finally pickup the check. Thanks Chase for abandoning us."
Karina L.,"Pico Rivera, CA",0,12,9,1.0,7/21/2017,"Terrible service ! Our waitress in the bar was so rude and could care less about her job. Multiple servers in the bar are drunk. The bartender keeps making drinks and the employees take them to the back.  Some waitresses are so drunk and still serving patrons. A menu fell on the floor during our visit and 15 employees walked past it, some even stepped on it,  it was on the floor for over 15 minutes. Worst service ever ! These employees should be fired for excessive drinking at work."
Bree A.,"Anaheim, CA",213,5,2,1.0,6/23/2017,"The only reason I'm giving it 1 stars is because i knew our server was busy and he was trying to give us good service but failed at the end. This was dinner for a baby reveal. I had asked the host TWICE on 2 seperate occasions to let our server know it was a celebration and to bring a pizookie out. They didnt and we finally just ordered one. I let the server know about the incident, i even cried a little cause i was a tad upset and I wanted it to be special. The server replies with the hosts are both new and don't worry the pizookies are only $3 today....? The price didnt matter it was my experience and i wasn't happy and he knew cause i cried in front of him! I work at a restaurant and if someone isn't happy tell a manager or try and do something. Totally ruined the moment ):"
Ariana S.,"Orange, CA",204,8,12,1.0,7/24/2017,"I love eating at BJ's. In fact, this is my second time eating at a BJ's in the past 3 days. However, I have never been to this location and I am extremely disappointed in the service I have been shown so far. I arrived over a hour ago as a group of 8. I was quoted that the wait time would be 35 minutes.  Obviously, that was not the case. My party repeatedly made attempts to check in and find out how much longer till we'd be seated. The first time we were told 10-15 more minutes. Then, after 20 minutes, we returned and they said they were cleaning our table. After 10 minutes, we checked back in on our table and they said that they still needed to clean it, which they had said 10 minutes prior (why had they not started cleaning it earlier). Finally, they began to clean our table.  Nonetheless, we ended up waiting over an hour and 15 minutes to be seated. Four parties of 6 were sat in the meantime and we were originally told only 35 minutes to wait. This location has lost my business. I will not be returning."
Nate J.,"Anaheim, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/12/2017,"Came in asking for a booth. Waited 35 min and was taken to a table OUTSIDE?!?! Why was I taken outside when specifically asking them for a booth. I believe all booths are located INSIDE the restaurant, then told me to wait again. After another 25 min. Was given no update as I sat in front of the hosts, whom were talking among themselves with their backs turned to us.  Side note: Last time I was there, spotted a cockroach on the wall, was sitting on the right hand side. Where you can see the beer vats from the windows."
Richard Y.,"Yorba Linda, CA",0,4,,1.0,12/9/2017,"came in at 9:30pm for some pizookies w the boys, we were seated under a 15 minute delay despite a ton of tables being open in areas that were clearly being served. once we were seated we waited about 30 minutes to even get our waters. 30 minutes later and im sitting here typing this review on my phone because we havent gotten our pizookies yet"
Deana Y.,"La Mirada, CA",40,95,84,4.0,3/25/2016,Came here with a few friends after shopping at the mall! I rarely come to bjs but whenever I do its usually because I'm at the mall and super hungry after an intense  cardio session running through the stores and trying on clothes. I really enjoy the atmosphere here and their pizza is amazing. I usually don't get the greatest customer service at chain restaurants but for some reason our waiter last night was phenomenal ( although I think he forgot our parmesan cheese) aside from that he was very sweet and on point with refilling our drinks and making sure we were satisfied. This spot will always be a favorite.
Priyan A.,"Fullerton, CA",29,8,1,1.0,10/7/2017,"normally i get good service here, but today i ordered a mini personal pizza add the crust was so hard.   i returned it and they replaced it. hope i didn't piss them of by returning it. they have me a new one,  hope they didn't did anything to it.   i wasn't rude about it.  also i've been sitting here with an empty glass of beer for quite sometime. no one's asked me if i want a refill."
Victor H R.,"Newport Beach, CA",26,2,,1.0,6/28/2017,Usually BJ's are good with bringing food quick but for some reason this store has taken their sweet time and I have been waiting an hour for my food. Take note it's 9 o'clock at night and there's hardly anyone here.
Isabella E.,"Corona, CA",6,67,9,5.0,10/14/2016,"So I've been here like over ten times so it's about time I write a review! This place is just fantastic. Every single time I go here, the service is 10/10. Amazing servers. We have had Brooke a couple times and she is the definition of customer service. There's two tall guys with like beards that are also just as amazing. And that one girl that wears a headband. Okay I'm starting to sound creepy. What I'm saying is like I've never had to ask for a refill, I've never had an order come out wrong. Just great service over and over.  The food is super delish. I'm not even a fan of the deep dish but the entrees and pazookies are great. That spicy broccoli mac and cheese THO. And the pazookies always amazing.  I'm one of those annoying customers that always get a zillion refills and when I go here they are ON IT. I love it. Food is great and service is even better. Keep it up BJ's in Brea."
Mike S.,"Big Bear Lake, CA",16,21,5,5.0,4/17/2017,"Came tonight to watch the Ducks game and enjoy some good food and drinks. Food was great but even more importantly was the outstanding service in the bar area from Zach. Super polite, attentive, and one of the better servers I've had. Thank you very much Zach for the hospitality. Cheers."
Dorothy J.,"Los Angeles, CA",24,29,,2.0,2/19/2017,"We came in on a busy Sunday afternoon but that still doesn't excuse the fact that a table seated after us got their food, plates, and utensils before we did. 2 of the plates had dirty gray water on them so we asked for new ones. We had to ask for utensils too as we never got any. When we finally got our appetizer, the table next to us that came after us had gotten their burgers. They were ordering dessert by the time we got our main entrees (pizza, sandwich, and tacos). Only thing that was prompt was the water refills, but that's it."
Alex N.,"Whittier, CA",5,107,54,5.0,10/6/2016,"My first time here in about three years and I had a great experience. We were greeted by a friendly and engaging waiter, the food was delicious and the atmosphere was nice.  If you want a great server and someone who is genuine, ask for Jarrett."
Rick L.,"Brea, CA",10,288,594,2.0,3/13/2015,"Began at happy hour with family. Good time. While reviewing menu found out that the ""hand tossed"" pizza is no longer an option.  We love the deep dish but like to mix it up with hand tossed pie occasionally. The new gimmic is ""tavern cut"" pizzas which are nothing  more than a longer flat bread pizza (basically an appetizer) that doesn't fit on the pizza table rack. Our pizza wasn't cut so we had to try and cut it on the round rack with the long narrow pizza. It was a mess and all fell apart.  My first thought is they introduced this pie to cut back on dough which would add up due to the 160+ restaurants. The toppings were ok. I had a chicken pie with green chili etc. the pizza was too much work, sloppy and disappointing. Too bad because we like BJ's and most of their food. The bartenders were good and friendly until I found my bill inaccurate. Granted it was .60 off but it doesn't matter. Especially when the bartender girl told me it was mixed with someone else's bill!! What?? How much more was incorrect on this bill? I didn't check, i just wanted to leave. The bartender got pissy with me and shrugged off that it is only $.60. That is not the point young lady.  Maybe when she is my age, those $.60 mistakes will add up to a nice chunk of change. I have found other restaurants charging misleading costs that are no longer in business ( Inka Trails, Claremont). They were down right crooked.  Just got rubbed the wrong way tonight at BJs, Brea."
Kerry J.,"Mira Loma, CA",0,17,10,4.0,5/10/2017,Great enlightened menu if your watching calories! Very consistent food and service. Wish they had a lower calorie pizookie!
Samantha H.,"West Covina, CA",174,122,24,5.0,4/1/2017,My husband and I came here for dinner on a Saturday night at 9pm. Surprisingly quiet but it still took 15 minutes to get seated. I ordered the Atlantic salmon and my husband ordered a burger. Food came pretty quickly. Our server was nice and refilled our drinks promptly. I like this location. Easy to find parking.
Diana B.,"Brea, CA",0,13,,1.0,6/12/2017,I just called to confirm an event I am having at BJ's and they informed me they were too busy to check and that because THEY were busy I had to call back later.  Are you kidding me???  I'm busy too and had a moment to call in between classes to confirm.   Apparently their time is more valuable then mine?!?  They couldn't  take 2 minutes to check on my reservation?  Or at least they could have asked for my name and number to call me back.  At which point a simple message on my answering service would have done the trick. But now I have to call them again when I can find time and hope they aren't too busy when I do.  Makes me want to relocate my party to another venue that actually cares about customers. I called back since the manager reached out to my yelp and was put on hold for 9 minutes. Finally able to confirm my event.  Let's hope it goes better then these phone calls.
