Ivy R.,"Martinez, CA",137,1779,4674,3.0,9/14/2017,"There are so many other places Id rather go than BJ's in Brentwood.  Its a city that I've seen grow over the years and well, BJ's is just another chain to accommodate the ham & egger's who like long commutes. The best thing that I've found on the menu is the Ahi Poke.  They do buy some good fresh tuna.  I cannot complain about that and its usually what I order and its always good.   Everything else on the menu is poorly represented.  The Mushroom dish looks terrible but it tastes OK.  The Brussels Sprouts were also OK but you could tell that both dishes were just left out way too long. The Honey Crisp Salad was just shaved lettuce, dripping with dressing and soggy.  Chicken Fingers are OK but if you have bad chicken fingers you're officially terrible. They have room enough for very large groups as well.  If you have a group that, needs a space to eat and talk amongst themselves, then by all means come enjoy."
Valerie J.,"Pittsburg, CA",1,4,,2.0,1/4/2018,"We went to BJ's in Brentwood last night to celebrate my daughter's birthday and didn't have a good experience. I must say though, the beginning of our night was not so bad... We were a party of 7, was seated about 10 mins after checking in.  We had a sweet waitress who took our order and promptly served our drinks and appetizers shortly after that.  About 20 minutes after finishing our appi's we hadn't received our entrees. Nor had we seen our waitress...clearly she was extremely busy.  She passed by our table and noticed that we didn't get our food and asked someone else to check it for her.   A good 45 mins after we put in our order, we got our food...it looked like it sat around for a long while and most of it was cold.  We asked to speak with a manager.  She heard our complaint and took our food back but never came back.  We paid for the appetizers and drinks and left there upset and hungry...needless to say, ruining my daughter's birthday. I would have given them 1 Star, but I gave them an extra Star because our waitress was very apologetic and just as upset as we were.  Her crew let her down and she didn't get any support."
Hanna W.,"Concord, CA",2,16,,1.0,12/28/2017,"Terrible service and no one seems to care to do anything to compensate patrons when they screw up. Yesterday was the third time we've eaten here (done in & take out) and we were, yet again, disappointed. This was our second pick up order and the guy who ""helped"" with the to-go bags had an apathetic attitude and seemed inconvenienced by our desire to know what all was in each bag. After dealing with his bad attitude and being told ""it's all there,"" we headed home.  1 entire meal was missing, which we called to reorder after we were all the way back home, and none of the dips/condiments had been added to any of the meals.  After driving back to BJ's to pick up everything that wasn't in our bags, no one apologized or offered a coupon for a future visit or anything.  So then we get back home and discover that the meal we called to reorder was made wrong.  Seriously?!? How hard is it to read: ""no mayonnaise"" or ""no sauce"" on the ticket?  We paid well over $100 for a family of 4 and it wasn't even close to worth it. I can deal with honest mistakes, we all make them, but not even offering an apology is just rude. This is a customer service business, and though the customer is not always right, they are still always the customer."
Bill B.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/23/2017,"Was just there with my son,who is 16. Although I live near I have never been to this establishment. Before I make any comments I must say the service was top-notch and food(pizza) came out quickly,the server was outstanding! My son and I took the first bite of pizza almost simultaneously looked at each other and said....""this is DiGiorno pizza!""..I just drooped almost 40 bucks(sodas)on a pizza I could have got at winco for 5 bucks...but I get it....it's place to get buzzed watch sports and eat...very nice place....if I go there again will hit winco first and just tell em to throw this in the oven."
Isaiah G.,"Pittsburg, CA",8,318,536,2.0,1/8/2018,This place is in a big outdoor shopping center. Parking is a little busy. This place is huge inside and they have a small waiting area. I had previously been here to the bar area. The bar area is ok and they have plenty of seating. There is a lot of tv's all around the place. We decided to come here for my sons birthday lunch. It was Thursday and was pretty busy. The appetizer was well sized portions but it tasted like frozen microwave food. The chicken sandwich I got was way too greasy. When we were done the waitress was talking to her friend and it took forever to leave. The bill was $60 for three people. I thought was a bit high for the type of food. This place is good to go to if you want to drink and are buzzed that food taste no longer matters. Sorry two stars for the portions of food.
Nelly B.,"Brentwood, CA",0,29,6,5.0,1/5/2018,"Bj's service is always excellent. I've had very, very few problems and when I did (wrong/missing food) it was fixed right away and the server was apologetic. Even when it is busy, our servers have always made time for us. One of the things that keeps us coming are the pizookies! Love that they add new flavors every so often. Will definitely be back!"
Jax D.,"Discovery Bay, CA",1,5,,2.0,1/6/2018,"We've been coming to BJ's since it opened several years ago.  The staff has always been great, attentive and friendly to us.  We've never had any issues with them.  But sadly, the food quality has gone down terribly.  We recently went there after not going in about 6 or 7 months.  We ordered the rib eye steak with roasted asparagus and soup and salads.  The flavor of the rib eye steak was bland and had way to much fat on both.  The asparagus were the very thin ones and were not roasted.  They were barely cooked and cold.  Unfortunately, I don't think we will be going back for a while, if ever."
Natalie B.,"Antioch, CA",111,8,,4.0,1/7/2018,"Have always had great service here and the food is good. Not a big fan of the beer though, had a bit of a sour taste when I've ordered it."
Yasin S.,"Brentwood, CA",64,45,23,2.0,12/12/2017,I called for takeout. Everything was fine but I ordered deep dish pizza. When I think of deep dish I think of chicago deep dish. This was just thick crust. Overall the food was okay but it is not deep dish. I dont know why so many places in the bay area will advertise deep dish and then just make something with a puffy crust.  The food is meh at best and definitely not worth the price they're charging. I paid almost $50 for two pizzas that were not better than the stuff i couldve ordered from lil casaers.
Peyton W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/26/2017,"Drink: i ordered  the peach berry ice tea if I wanted a drink with water and syrup I would just ask for it  The table: was very sticky and dirty even though the waiter stated ""it was clean""  Food: i order a sausage small pie I questioned if they got the recipe from Pizza Hut or not. I also order a side of the thin fries thinking that it would taste like fries..... but I was sadly mistaken. They were freezing cold but i don't know how it is possible for the fries to be  burnt. The oil that they used for the fries must have been at least two weeks old. In all I would not recommend. If I were you McDonald's would be a better option."
Lynn C.,"Brentwood, CA",0,76,9,1.0,11/19/2017,Nastiness! Hundreds of cigarette butts outside and trash. Can u imagine what the kitchen looks like. Management-clean this up! I even emailed a complaint to their corporate office. Nothing has changed!
Alycia C.,"Brentwood, CA",3,12,,1.0,12/31/2017,Wow. Talk about disappointment. $20 steak is about 2 inches wide and long. One of them were so dry we sent it back. It's not the first chance I've given this restaurant. It is clear that they have lowered their standards as far as the quality of food goes. The only thing keeping this place in business is the lack of other options in the area.
Lee Ann C.,"Fairfield, CA",1,2,,4.0,1/1/2018,"UPDATE: After writing my yelp review, and sending an email to the restaurant expressing my frustration and displeasure, I am happy to update that not only did the General Manager respond to my post here on Yelp, but reached out to me within just a couple of hours of my post via telephone AND sent me an email. Her apology was warm and genuine and I look forward to returning to BJ's in Brentwood another time in order to be proven it can be better."
Angela W.,"Antioch, CA",369,18,82,1.0,10/10/2017,Always have a terrible experience every time I come here! The only thing that keeps me coming back Is the beer. Service shitty bartenders shitty they like to steal your change btw! Food always comes out wrong. Tonight decided I'm done waiting and told her I didn't want it let me leave with what I've already had. Now I have left a restaurant more hungry than when I walked in! Thank you!
Mel V.,"Pittsburg, CA",309,3,1,1.0,11/15/2017,"If I could rate my experience here with negative stars I would. Ally needs to get fired, & I usually never get on yelp to make any reviews but this women had no type of care when my boyfriend & I found out our crispy chicken salad had raw chicken in it. We went back to return our order (we drove from Pittsburg to Brentwood 15-25min drive) & she came out w/ no type of courtesy. My boyfriend was talking to her about how they need to check their food before sending it out & how he ate a piece of it & while he was talking she turned around & walks away , what kind of manager does something like that. She didn't even bother to wave anything, or to give us a gift card for our troubles for coming back & we live about 25 mins away & the fact my boyfriend can get sick for eating that shit is why we're going to call corporate. Thanks for your service ally ."
danny B.,"Brentwood, CA",0,16,5,1.0,10/15/2017,"Again... same old thing. No place settings, wait staff playing high school, wrong food, cold food.... this place never ceases to amaze me. This time I have learned my lesson. I wouldn't come here for free anymore. Two weeks later... no response from management on here. Whole problem is management obviously"
Leslie R.,"Discovery Bay, CA",87,26,18,1.0,12/13/2017,Sadly this place is going downhill again. 4 years ago i posted a negative review. About a year later everything changed and this became a favorite place to dine. The last few times service and food has been lacking in quality. Tonight food came out burned on one meal (this was a problem a few months ago as well) Took asking twice to get refills on drinks. Pasta wasnt cooked all the way. Several bites with hard noodles. Had to ask for extra sauce and a salad dressing size portion was brought out. Just very disappointed to spend money on such a crappy meal for the entire table and tonight was to support our schools PTA. I dont think after how bad its been the last few times that we will be back until management fixes things. Hoping for the best because this place has had great food and service in the past but the last 6-9 months has been terrible.
Chan S.,"San Francisco, CA",0,3,,1.0,12/5/2017,"One of the most horrible service I've had at any restaurant.  Arrive at 11:15am and was told there would be a 10-15 minute wait due to ""only one waiter working"" when the place opens at 11am. Went to the bathroom came back 5 minutes later to see same hostess seating a couple that walked in as I was returning from the bathroom. I asked why were they seated first and she looked puzzled. Some guy, assuming manager, walks up and say ""just seat everyone.""  Get seated and the manager takes my order. My salad and drink came out within 5 minutes but my food took 30 minutes long. No one came to check on me at all. Finally I stopped a waiter and asked what is taking my food so long (as I sat and watch other customers get their food order before me and they arrived after I was seated)!!! Waiter said oh your order takes longer (more excuses and no accountability)! I ordered a piece of fried chicken on top of mash potato, the lunch portion. The table next to me had the same piece of chicken on his sandwich and it came out 10 minutes after his order.  My husband was having surgery at the local hospital and I thought BJ's would be easy in and out, especially since I came at opening time. This experience just caused more unnecessary stress to an already stressful day.  Never going back."
Donna F.,"Ripon, CA",1,83,396,1.0,9/21/2017,"Met some friends at  the Brentwood BJ's Restaurant. Very disappointed in the food.   The nachos, our favorite, were bland. No sour cream or guacamole. Only toppings were a speckle of black olives that looked like someone threw them on as the waiter passed by. Oh there was five sliced green onions.......sad so sad.   Where's the cheese bj's ? Did you use chicken jerky? I lowercased your name.  You failed so badly you don't even rate for me to capitalize your name.  You got one star only because of your beer. When we met are friends in Brentwood we're going to have to find a better place.  FAIL!"
Deborah E.,"Spring, TX",15,2,,3.0,12/6/2017,I visit this place in California with my son it was okay but they seem to enjoy the pizza very much my order of Cobb salad was mediocre but the service was great
Aly R.,"Antioch, CA",0,12,6,1.0,12/31/2017,"So sad to have to write this because I am a BJ's fan. But after receiving such awful service and even worse experience with management at the Brentwood location, I just had to write this. My group of friends went in 12/22 around 6pm waited 40 minutes for a table just to have the server ignore our table, get confused on the transfer of the bar tab to the table tab, then had major attitude when we finally just asked for the check to leave since the appetizers and drinks too so long.    Talked to the manager on duty and she was not interested in our feedback and was warned about this review and still just stared at us.  She even went to get our check and never came back I had to leave cash on the table and tell them to figure it out.  We walked right across the street to Black Angus for way better food and much better service. I have been going to BJ's all over CA for at least 12 years and Brentwoods service and attitude was appalling.  I work too hard for my money and my time is too valuable for a restaurant to not be giving good service. Might even need to tweet corporate and let them know how Brentwood location is tarnishing the BJ's name.  Really hope they get it together soon.  Peace and love people."
Chris H.,"Boise, ID",44,6,,3.0,12/5/2017,"Solid beers & a huge menu. Surprised at the number of guest taps. Service was good, restaurant kind of loud. Lots of big TVs showing sports-ball if that's your thing."
Jennifer M.,"Antioch, CA",151,112,674,5.0,4/17/2017,"I usually go to Bj's all the time and order the same thing.  Brussels sprouts!  YES...they're good!  I do ask that they cook them longer (I like them crispy on the edges.)  They have this amazing Sriracha sauce that has just the right amount of mayo to off set the spice.  I actually found Sriracha Mayo at the Grocery Outlet and it's not bad.  I also decided to try something that's brand new on the menu.  The Super Salad!  It's extremely healthy with a vinaigrette dressing.  It has local grown corn, jicama, blueberries, strawberries, and  Peruvian quinoa.  Kinda bland but....it's good for you so I'm not complaining!  My favorite waitress ""Abbey"" always waits on us.  We never have to wait to long for a meal and if we don't like it she offers something else.  My stomach was full when I left  but on the way home I bought a banana nut bread from Quick Stop!  Oops!"
Bill F.,"Discovery Bay, CA",0,20,7,1.0,11/6/2017,"We are longtime patrons of BJs, having lived in Baton Rouge and Albuquerque prior to Brentwood.   We had always enjoyed the extensive menu offerings and good drink selections.    We were happy to find your location after moving here in 2015. As you can see from our activity, we would typically dine in 2-4 times a month, whether appetizers and a drink, or more recently enjoying your Prime Rib offerings.      I am vegetarian, and have enjoyed the expansive list of items you offer.  We write at this time as we have seen a recent and notable decline in food quality and service.    Whereas a year ago we would tell friends and family ""BJ's is A+- great servers and awesome foods"", we find ourselves actually shying them away, having ourselves experienced more than a fair number of failures in service and food quality. Of note, the recent cited visit has made us to decide to make the drive over to the city for offerings or out to Tracy for the TX Roadhouse.     Service has slipped- booths are dirty, even at 4pm- sticky and wiped with towels that are stagnant.    We used baby wipes to wipe the smell from our own table.   I requested to know what the guest tap of Speakeasy Brewery was, as I saw it listed on the board.   Our server actually argued that I did not read it right, and repeated the BJ brews.   I asked her to read the board and find out what the varietal was.  She did, and 15 minutes later, we had the drinks on the table.     15 minutes.  We then ordered Root Beer ribs and Siracha Brussels sprouts.  We got cold ribs with almost no sauce on them, and straight mayonnaise on the Brussels sprouts.  Having ordered them often, we know how they are to be presented.   After arguing with our server that it was not ""siracha mayo"", she brought a bottle of siracha to the table- not a small cup, but a half bottle, grease covered, from the server station.          My wife ordered the Prime Rib dinner, medium rare.   Came out looking great in color, but was ice cold- potatoes, meat.    Asparagus was woody, cold and shriveled.   She sent it back.   Second round comes out 15 minutes later, same thing. Cold.     Server argues it came right out of the oven.  We asked her to touch it herself.  She did, and agreed it was cold.  My wife declined a third attempt, and asked for a French dip.   Guess what-  cold.   Au jus, cold and crusted with fat on the top edges.  Fries- recycled?   couldn't tell, skipped it.    Server ""comped"" the sandwich and said there would be no charge for the prime rib plates..... really? I ordered the lentil soup- it came warmer than usual, maybe 110f.    On my last three stops, the stop was always cold and sent back.   I requested they microwave it in an attempt to get them to understand the cauldron was cold.    I also ordered beet and arugula salad.   Came minus the roasted almonds.   We were too tired arguing with the server to point it out. Manager on the floor? No where to be seen.    Servers- standing at the server stations BSing.   Hostesses?  Looked like High School girls gossiping at the front.    We have seen this get more and more pronounced each visit, and now feel unwelcome and unsatisfied returning.  By the way, it was not busy when we were there, but it was a Friday and the World Series game was just starting.    Lot of missed opportunity to serve food and beverage----        We actually went to Mels and ordered dinner- my wife having been served nothing edible at BJS. Just thought you would like to hear from a long time, multi store, customer who probably wont come back.    *********update ********** Manager called Day after I wrote this (had emailed a copy to the two co owners) ""Sorry sorry sorry"".   Excuses and admitted problems.    That was it.   Pretty obvious the place has gone down in the past 6 months.     Excuses and requisite sorrys We take the drive to WC and hit Pizza My Heart.    Better Pizza, much cheaper, great staff and small but good beer selection.   Great rewards program.  Pizza by the slice or whole pie."
Norell A.,"Pittsburg, CA",4,16,19,2.0,10/30/2017,"Always incredibly disappointing from the execution of the cooking to the quality of the food, the inconsistency of the drinks. Service is usually horrendous. Sucks because the food could be great the drinks could be good but nobody here seems to give a shit.. added a photo of the second ""southern fried chicken with corn and red pepper succotash"" the first one day in the window so long the teaspoons just regular corn looked fried. The food was dead, the bartender seemed irritated at me that I asked for a fresh dish when the food was clearly sitting in the window until it was inedible. Not to mention I literally had a teaspoon of corn and there was no succotash. Whatever... total waste of money."
Robert S.,"Oakley, CA",0,9,,2.0,12/31/2017,"The food was pretty good but service was lacking from start to finish. Went early and wasn't real busy, not sure what the problem was. After looking at other reviews it seems to be a problem at this place"
Cindy N.,"Antioch, CA",0,1,,2.0,12/29/2017,The best I can say is everything is so-so.  Barely average.  This is the second time we've been here and most definitely won't be back.  I just can't understand why this place always seems to be crowded.
Hal L.,"Oakley, CA",1,13,,2.0,11/11/2017,"I have eaten at this BJs several times in the past and it was typically OK, but today was bad enough that I don't expect to go back. First the server, while friendly, was clearly overwhelmed. I asked for sweetener for my iced tea literally 4 times and it never came. We had the same issue with a few other condiments and sides we ordered, and we never got the plates we asked for when the appetizers came.  The worst part though was my food. I ordered a chicken sandwich that looked good on the menu. What came out actually looked like a chicken strip in the middle of a large bun. The cheese and dressing that were supposed to be on it were missing as well. I asked for the manager and she agreed that the sandwich looked ridiculous and she apologized and said she needed to have a talk with the chef. She asked if she could get me something else, and reluctantly I ordered another (different) sandwich. That sandwich finally came when we were leaving, which was about par for the rest of the visit. The manager offered her apologies but the bottom line is that I was there for 90 minutes and left without lunch. I understand now why the BJs reviews here on Yelp have been so bad lately."
Randy S.,"Oakley, CA",232,147,209,2.0,7/3/2017,We come here at least 1 to 2 times a month. The consistent message I would say is the lack of consistency with service and food. The service is subpar at best. They act like it's a privilege to be served by them when it's the job description. Refill my drinks when you see it empty without being asked for starters that's a good first step.  The food where to begin. I'll keep it straight forward the portion sizes are never even close to being the same from trip to trip. The temperature is never consistent whisk is a big issue. Look I get it at times you are busy today was not one of them. I spent $80 on four of us with tip and left hungry and dissatisfied. C'mon you can do better with just a little training.  To come back or not is the decision we will have to make.
Rob H.,"Rio Vista, CA",0,3,,1.0,12/19/2017,"My ""deep dish"" pizza was NOT a deep dish pizza by any standard and bears no resemblance to what you would find in the home of deep dish pizzas in Chicago .   This limp imposter was, actually, just a thick crust pizza that might have been cooked in a dish."
cindy b.,"Kapaa, HI",0,73,1,5.0,7/30/2017,Whatever changes you made on the weekends are great!! Our orders and the service were perfect!!!  The prime rib was excellent!!!!!!!!!
Allyssa P.,"Oakley, CA",0,5,6,5.0,7/16/2017,"I love this restaurant!!! Every time I eat here, I get sides of Ahi tuna, because I don't want the salad that typically comes with it. I also usually order their glazed salmon dish and it is cooked perfectly every time. Their drinks are typically pretty strong (in a good way!), and we frequently eat here or order to go.  They have an excellent selection of brews as well, if you're looking for a good beer cool you down from the scalding heat in Brentwood. Bonus: they're open late and have online ordering for the curbside pick up, which is super convenient!!!"
Lucia F.,"Buena Park, CA",0,6,3,1.0,5/13/2017,So disappointed.... I ordered curbside and got half my meal.. looks yet I paid full price... never again. I actually like BJ's but this was a total too off.
Sienna D.,"San Francisco, CA",37,5,,5.0,9/20/2017,"I have absolutely no complaints. I ordered curbside pick up. I picked a time for pickup and although I did have to call to tell them I was outside (only because I  couldn't be seen on the side of the monster truck I was parked alongside) the service was prompt, my food was hot and my ice cream for my dessert was separate from the food. The server was great and my food was excellent."
Jackie S.,"Dublin, CA",19,3,,1.0,6/25/2017,"1. Called to make a reservation but the first available opening was way too late. I asked how long the wait was if I were to show up and was told it would be 30-35 mins. I asked to be put on the wait list so I could avoid the wait. I get there 30 mins later and checked in and was still told that the wait was 30 - 35 mins. Purpose of the call ahead was totally defeated.  2. There were six of us and we were seated at a table for 4. We asked to be moved since there were clearly other bigger unoccupied tables. Didn't happen. 3. Had to remind the server to give us utensils after our food arrived.  To be fair, the server was nice."
Wendy B.,"Campbell, CA",6,14,3,1.0,5/5/2017,Update: Tried to call to speak about this experience and literally spent 10 minutes waiting to be connected to a manager....still 1 star Where do I start....came here with my mom for lunch at 1:50pm. The restaurant was not full! We ordered a side of fries and then our meals. She ordered shrimp tacos and I ordered a bison burger. Our waitress practically threw our fries on the table and then when we went to eat them they were lukewarm at best. My bison burger had absolutely no flavor and onions (which I had asked for none of those). Very expensive for 2 meals and very disappointing since there is not much in the area. Won't be back anytime soon.
Nicole V.,"Oakley, CA",22,5,,5.0,10/30/2017,"Finally got to get away with hubby alone for lunch.. pleasantly surprised.. Sunday afternoon very busy, yet excellent service.. food was delicious. Waitress was great also.. don't know her name.. ( we ate in the bar Sunday )! Will be back soon!"
Shamika F.,"Antioch, CA",85,26,29,1.0,3/24/2017,Insulting - I have ordered the wedge salad many times when I've eaten in the restaurant. When you order something to go they basically screw you. It has never looked like this . It's less than half of the size they normally give you . It's kind of like since you don't have the server waiting on you and no one's getting a tip they think they can just do whatever.
Dz N.,"Benicia, CA",0,7,,1.0,4/8/2017,"I wish I could give them 0 Stars!!!!! Do not come here!!! Go next door to Red Robin, Black Angus , Johnny Garlics or anywhere else !!!!! Went out to dinner for my daughters birthday tonight with 8 other people and experienced the worst service in my life. #1---server took 6 of our orders then walked away before getting the other 2 orders. #2 ---server then brought out food but no silverware. #3--- server would disappear for 20 mins at a time. We literally had to get up and get a pitcher of water our selves and pour our own water !!!! #4 --- server brought the bill before asking if anybody wanted any more drinks (4 of us had been drinking beers and martinis) you would think he would want to make the tab larger ....or ask if anybody would like dessert...we even told him we had a birthday girl with us!!!!  #5 ---once we put our desserts in (which they messed up and brought wrong dessert items) they took literally 30-40 mins to come out. We were sat at 5:30 and left at 7:45...... my daughter is a hostess and said these servers and managers wouldn't last 1 night at Outback. She's only 17 and she realized this!!! She also was the birthday girl and didn't get a song...wow!  #6 ---asked for a to go box but never came. Had to go to server stand myself again and grab some myself!!!  #7 ---numerous managers walked by our 8 top table and ignored us numerous times...once he over heard me say to my son "" where the hell is our desserts it's been 30 mins "" and replied while waking by "" they still have to put the ice cream on"" wtf!!! #8 --- the table directly behind us was very upset as well. Their child's burger never even came...really again wtf!!! They were semi busy but not slammed. The food was good but the service was the worst I've experienced in my life and I go out to eat about 1-2 times a week at 3-5 star restaurants locally an in SF. This place does a good business only because of there location!!' If they were not a chain in the Streets they would be out of business in a few months. I'm a business owner so I know what I'm talking about. Avoid this place like the Plague!!!!"
Sylvia T.,"Tracy, CA",15,16,37,3.0,6/11/2017,"We came here for lunch Friday. Restaurant was busy, but our waitress was trying her best. I waited close to 25 minutes for my bar drink. When I did receive it, it tasted like it was watered down like it was sitting on the counter for awhile. We ordered our appetizer and lunch specials. We were hoping to get our appetizer first with our salads but it came out all at once with our lunch and salads. And with the little table we were sitting at, we were not comfortable. I do have to say our dessert was good tho. We might come back, but hopefully next time we don't get everything at once and we don't have to wait 25 minutes for a watered down drink"
