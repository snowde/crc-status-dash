Jeremy T.,"San Ramon, CA",17,41,22,5.0,3/26/2016,Went here yesterday with my lady. We both got the ham and cheese and a strawberry lemonade. That was the best ham and cheese I have ever had. The waitress was awesome. She brought us seconds on our drinks before we were halfway done on our first. We never even had to ask for the bill. She just brought it. This place is great. Highly recommended.
steve K.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,18,,2.0,4/10/2016,"Came in to catch the end of the game.  Food is not very good.staff was friendly. Got a pizza to go. Very doughy not enough sauce.not very flavorful. Calamari came out in about 3mins which is nice but tells me it's not fresh and it wasn't .probably frozen. Makes me think someone sent it back and they kept it under a heat lamp until someone else ordered it. That's how it tasted.  Got a blonde beer, tasted great. Will only come back for   food."
D N.,"Alto, NM",29,22,11,2.0,12/6/2014,"The only reason for 2 stars tonight was the service, and maybe the not-so-cold beer. I've been here several times and the food is always good, and tonight was no exception! We ordered two appetizers, the fried artichokes served with a chipotle aioli, which my wife loved, and the corn fritters which I loved. The fritters were perfectly textured! My wife ordered the California chicken flatbread pizza, and enjoyed it's delicious simplicity. I had the jalapeño burger. The jalapeños were crispy fried, which gave it a nice crunchy texture, inside that juicy burger. Very good..!! That was the ""center"" of our experience tonight. The ""beginning"" and the ""end"" is where the two stars came from. After being seated, no one approached our table for some time. In fact, it wasn't even our server who finally took our drink order, it was some other server filling in for our station's server, who was too busy to even notice us. When she did come to take our drink order, we already knew which appetizers and entrée's we wanted to order, which can be challenging at BJ's, because of their extensive menu!  I ordered my favorite beer there, the Nutty Brunette, and my wife ordered her standard lemonade. My beer wasn't very cold when it arrived, which in my opinion is just wrong! It's a brewhouse for crying out loud, and beer should be served icy cold!  When our entrée's arrived, no one came back to ask if we needed anything, at all, until it was too late that is. I like mayo on my burger and it was not served with mayo. After waiting a few minutes, trying to flag someone down for mayo, I ended up using the chipotle aioli that came with the fried artichokes, on my burger, and it made the burger even more outstanding, so when someone finally came by to see if we needed anything, we didn't.  When our server came to ask if we wanted dessert, we said no thanks, but did ask for an ice water for me and a refill on my wife's lemonade. It didn't come. I thought she forgot about us. We didn't see her anywhere! Seriously, 15 minutes later we finally flagged down another server and asked if she could find our server, and tell her we would like to get our check.  A few minutes later, here comes our server with a huge tray of drinks, which included ours that we no longer wanted. After dropping off our drinks, she gave us our check, just as I handed it back with my credit card in it. Obviously, we were ready to leave! Rather than running my credit card immediately after emptying the rest of her drink tray, she stops at a table of 8 to take their dinner order first. Big mistake!  At this point, her tip has been compromised. No matter how good the food is, when the service is this bad, there's no excuse. Yes, it was 6pm on a Saturday night, but a person shouldn't have to wait for a Wednesday to go out to dinner just to get good service, in my opinion.  Hey, BJ's!.....Here's my two cents: Staff your restaurant sufficiently on a busy weekend dinner service, or next week maybe I'll just go to Mel's...."
Kalistina D.,"Antioch, CA",105,40,9,1.0,11/6/2015,"I have honestly never had a good experience here.  I'm not sure if it's because they are always short staffed or because the servers genuinely do not care about tips or service. The food leaves something to be desired, if its even made correctly. I have never once had my food come back the way that I ordered it. I am NOT a difficult person, & I do not ask for a lot of things to be excluded or added to my meal. Generally I try to find things that I am able to eat without doing any substitutions. I am allergic to a few items that can cause a serious reaction. I try to stay away from those types of foods because I do know that sometimes accidents happen. With that being said, I had ordered some sort of chicken sandwich that avocado on it. I requested that the avocado be left off. When the food was delivered my sandwich ended up having avocado on it. I sent it back and requested that the avocado and the top bun be removed As I am highly allergic to avocados. 10 minutes later my sandwich returned without avocado. When I lifted the bun I noticed that all they did with take the avocado off and left the bun that was saturated with creamy avocado paste. I tried to flag our server down several times and was not successful until the end of the meal. I ended up not eating and placing the sandwich into a to go container which I inevitably threw away. The other thing that really bothers me about this place is the fact that there's a different person that approaches your table for every stage of your meal. I am big on consistency and if I'm having a hard time trying to find my server it makes it very difficult to enjoy my meal especially if there's something wrong."
impression m.,"San Francisco, CA",0,51,17,4.0,4/26/2016,"Been to this location off and on past couple of years.  Great waitstaff (Linda is excellent), delicious food and lots of TV's to watch your favorite sports team.  They have a 'new' items on menu like Derby Style Cobb Salad, chicken wraps and of course alcoholic drinks. ;) Highly recommend for nice lunch or early dinner. Read the other YELP reviews complaining about the high noise level, it's a sport bar/restaurant people.  If you want quiet and romantic, go to Vic Stewar'ts or Capps. Props to Mario and Linda!!!"
Jennifer M.,"Browns Valley, CA",10,18,1,4.0,3/6/2016,"After reading so many negative reviews, I didn't hold out much hope for a nice dinner out with my husband. Boy, was I wrong. Despite it being a very busy Saturday night, we were seated earlier than expected. Our server was friendly and attentive and our food was delicious! We will definitely be back!"
Jasnoor S.,"Brentwood, CA",0,6,,1.0,3/22/2017,"I've been to BJs a number of times and I don't expect top notch service but what I do expect is for the servers to be polite. The food was okay and it was served to us in an adequate amount of time. However,  the server was rude and demeaning. I came in with my younger sisters and as soon as we sat down I could sense that the server was not thrilled to be serving us. When I explained to her how we would like our checks split, she became very condescending and rolling her eyes at us. We were a large group and we all ordered different things so just to ensure it wasn't confusing I thought it would be easier if I explain to her. She basically blankly looked at us and interrupted me in between my sentence and said ""So we're just splitting the check! That's what we're doing!"". I said yes, and then proceeded to tell her in what way we would like it split. She interrupted me again and said ""You're confusing me!"". Once she walked away, we spoke about how rude she had been and it turns out she was behind us and mostly likely heard what we said. Later on, when she came back with the check she was definitely more polite than she had been earlier. We were a party of 6 and while we did not order the most food or drinks, I don't think she should have treated us that way."
Gustavo A.,"Emeryville, CA",269,82,23,3.0,10/9/2014,So I love Bjs. It's one of the best corporate restaurants out there. They always chose great locations and their food is amazing. I usually don't do reviews for a corporate restaurant but maybe the managers need to know that this place gives inadequate service.  I've been here plenty of times. As well as other Bjs state wide in California. And for me being in the hospitality/catering/restaurant business I tend to not judge but I also notice the small things. 90% of the time I have visited this location I end up waiting for more than expected. It's also a task just to get a hold of your server. Over all the place is great just like any other Bjs restaurants but the service here shows and makes this location an unpleasant experience. Haven't been in about half a year so I really hope they have improved.
Tara J.,"Santa Clara, CA",114,59,11,1.0,6/17/2016,Worst.service. ever. Literally every step took them at least half an hour. They were rude and everything i asked for took forever.  Several ofmy ffriend's received horrible service here too. Never coming back.
Maeve M.,"Brooklyn, NY",270,535,107,3.0,1/23/2015,"Fine spot. Not amazing but I am giving this review 3 stars because our server was really nice and I liked that they had calorie counts on the menu. My chicken tacos were pretty bland but I did order something from the ""healthy"" menu section. I asked for hot sauce and never got it but our server seemed pretty busy and was very nice in spite of the crowd so I'm not going to hold it against him. I would not go back but if this is all that's open or nearby it's not a bad place. I think my parents liked their food too, and appreciated the beer selection."
Peter A.,"Danville, CA",9,133,434,4.0,1/5/2016,"came in with a group of 10, we waited for about 20 minutes, service was good and friendly (then again when waiters/waitress see Asians, they see automatic big tippers for good friendly service), food was good, I ordered one of the fish menu - I forgot which one, it was done right, not overcooked"
The Ç.,"Oakley, CA",0,14,,4.0,4/10/2016,"I've been here many times and I wish I could give this place that fifth star, but honestly I've had too many occasions where the service was bad. The food is excellent and they charge only half for virgin drinks, which is why my friends and I continue to go back there, but there have been some problems with the staff. First of all, the server was really inattentive. She didn't take our drink order for like, 20 minutes. I was about to call the manager when she finally showed up. After she finally brought the food out we never heard from her again. The other servers were at least polite and filled our drinks for us on request. One of my friends is a vegetarian and usually gets a soup and salad. This was the first time we brought her with us, and they served her before everybody else and she finished before we all got our food. That's backwards. Her meal only took a minute to prepare and should have been served at the same time as the rest of us. Now I have to explicitly ask them to prepare hers last. Last time I went, it was Valentine's Day and my boyfriend and I had dinner there. I ordered a personal pizza with pepperoni and artichoke. It was expensive for being mostly bread, but the kicker was that among the artichunks there was one, single, solitary pepperoni. The server rushed off before I could stop him. I must have stared at it for a good minute wondering why somebody would make a pizza that way and consider it acceptable to serve and why the server wouldn't take one look at it and ask what was up before carrying it to my table and skittering off. I had to flag down a different server to get it replaced, and when I got the second one it had tomato chunks all over it which I had requested to be left out. The manager himself gave it to me and at that point I was more amused than I was mad. I opted to pick off the tomatoes rather than have it remade a third time because I was starving, but they threw in a free dessert and gave me a coupon for a free dessert on a subsequent visit. If you can get past the occasional major inconvenience, this place has awesome food and drinks though. Their weekend brunch is actually delicious. I actually prefer it to Outback nowadays because of the food quality and closeness to home."
Nick L.,"Glen Burnie, MD",1,74,13,3.0,11/16/2014,"I will always sit at the bar, not in this case. The bar was busy and so were the tables closely seated around it. It took a few minutes to get a server. I ordered a beer, and ordered my pizza when my beer came. The server was very nice and courteous. I enjoyed another beer and my pizza came. Pizza was just ok. Had another beer and went to the hotel. The service was the best I have encountered in Brentwood."
Steve L.,"Byron, CA",0,9,,4.0,3/9/2016,"the service, food and beers are excellent.  we often go there for a light dinner and a couple of their house beers. i was not happy the last time we went as they now allow small children to sit at the bar to eat.  i am not aware of this being legal.  i know the resturant does get full, but it is in appropriate to have a young child sitting at the bar.  if the child was in a booth in the bar area, that would be more appropriate.  i don't know whether i should report this to the authorities or just the management."
Veronica S.,"Brentwood, CA",12,36,41,3.0,10/30/2015,"Honestly it's an okay place now, used to love coming here but the service has gone down way to much. Servers are not on top of their game, I get a good server once in awhile but more with getting the bad ones and food is slowly diminishing of its taste."
Oliver N.,"Campbell, CA",5,20,6,5.0,4/4/2016,Great place to go to for brunch. A bit crowded but always great service and food. We always eats outside since we bring our Great Dane and they are always very accommodating.
Jessica H.,"Antioch, CA",0,11,3,5.0,8/19/2016,Writing a 5 star review because our server Becka was awesome! We had an issue she fixed right away and made things right for us. Thanks Becka for the great experience!!!!!!!!!!!
Dawn C.,"Benicia, CA",0,2,,2.0,3/29/2016,"The food was great!  However the service was the worst I've ever had. It wasn't the waiter fault, it was the kitchen. It took an hour for us to receive our meal. The waiter did check in with us after about 45 minutes of waiting and said he would send over the manager. The manager came and offered to give us dessert on him. EXCEPT they waited until long after we finished our meals to take our dessert order. Which then took another 30 minutes to make it to our table."
Rego S.,"San Francisco, CA",91,269,37,4.0,12/30/2015,I've been going here for years.  Their beer is great (my favorite is their Jeremiah Red and seasonal Grand Cru) and the food is consistently good.  The biggest drawback is the slow service.
Savannah S.,"Davis, CA",45,73,188,1.0,2/28/2013,"I cannot stand this place. Everything about it is bad. The service. The food. The prices. The portions. Okay, maybe not the cleanliness/overall look of the place, but everything else is just so bad that I don't even care about how the place looks. The food is bland. They're always messing up orders. The prices are sky high for tiny portions. The (alcoholic) drinks have way, WAY too much ice. You're basically paying for a cup of ice. The wait for the food is outrageous. I like to consider myself pretty lenient with the service of restaurants/cafes/etc since I work in the food industry as well and know that you have to deal with a lot of stressful things, but still. Lots of the staff here seem to have attitudes.  Definitely would not recommend and would not go back."
