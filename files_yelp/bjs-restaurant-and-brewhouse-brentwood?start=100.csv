Mitch M.,"Brentwood, CA",0,15,,3.0,2/4/2017,"I like BJs a lot but there are quirks.  The wait for dining room seating is brutal on weekend evenings.  The bar seating is seat yourself and is usually easier to get.  The menu is lengthy with lots of choices but they're of uneven quality.  I've found some things that I like and their are enough to visit once or twice a month without becoming bored with the meals.  The craft brew choices are very good.  I' ve had good service recently but there some long waits in past years.  I love the New Orleans jambalaya, the guacamole and chips, the Sante Fe salad and several other dishes."
East B.,"San Francisco, CA",37,45,9,5.0,3/22/2017,"Great atmosphere for family or just to hang out with your friends at the bar.  I love there flat pizza, burgers, nachos, wings, and their BEER!"
Fer R.,"Oakley, CA",237,341,1803,4.0,10/19/2014,"Ok, so I haven't written a review for this BJ'S so here I go...... I enjoy dining out here. The handful of times I've eaten here for different occasions all have been pleasant experiences. I've eaten on patio and different areas is dining area, I've even had just a bar experience. No qualms or anything negative to let ya know about. Drinks: the many beers and cocktail drinks have always been poured or made to our liking and been served cold and in a timely fashion. Our most recent trip we tried the Pumpkin Ale and it tasted just like pumpkin pie (IMO). Calamari & fried artichokes are appetizers we've tried, Seafood tacos (comes with 2 mahi mahi tacos grilled or fried), BJ'S bacon cheeseburger (quite filling), open faced chili burger (another tummy filler) and house salads. And plenty of kid dishes my kids have tried. No complaints. Decent portions for the prices. Service is good. Bathrooms have been clean. Friendly greeting from hostess. All in all, we enjoy coming to BJ's."
Bill E.,"Kansas City, KS",3,20,,4.0,2/18/2017,I don't see what all the negativity is.   It's a tad pricey and a few little errors doesn't constitute slamming them.   We enjoyed ourselves.  Food was good.  Our service was good.   I did four stars for being pricy.
Lupe L.,"Oakley, CA",156,13,5,5.0,1/17/2017,5 stars to Amanda for recommending my drink and my appetizer that I never had!!!shes awsome!
J M.,"Brentwood, CA",0,2,1,1.0,1/1/2017,"The service is TOO SLOW. Our party of 5 waited just short of an hour to be seated. Currently we've been waiting just about an hour for the food to come. We've been to BJ's several times and wait time is ALWAYS an issue. If you are hungry,  I recommend going elsewhere, because the wait here will bring out the hangry. If you don't mind waiting a couple of hours to eat an average meal then you'll be fine. Maybe bring your favorite novel."
Mayalia B.,"Sacramento, CA",235,191,435,5.0,11/10/2015,"I came in alone to enjoy the rootbeer chicken wings all by my lonely!! Yea I didn't want to chance anyone asking for some lmao I'm totally kidding. Service was great, she made me half lemonade half Sierra Mist with no extra charge!! And my wings were perfect. What else can I say this was my first time at this location I was super tempted to try the pumpkin pazookie but I exercised extreme control lol and said no. I will most def be back this was a very clean establishment."
D P.,"San Diego, CA",60,131,80,1.0,5/30/2016,"5/27/16-2:54pm-HORRIBLE!!! Service was slow (and it wasn't even busy) The waitress kept forgetting things The waitress constantly brought out parts of our orders instead of the appetizers then the salads then the entrees.  I consistently had to stop another waiter and or the MANAGER to get me more water or my friend Pepsi Or booziki was cold and super hard around the edges.  I asked for NO BACON on my pizza and of course there was bacon.  My friend asked for cheese and extra ranch for her salad and she got neither Her potato skins were barely covered w cheese Very disappointing for spending $59.51 I would like a refund but that's probably not possible.  You can look up my bills if you would like  0137 Table-802 #Party 0. That's incorrect there was 2 Melissa M was our waitress  SvrCk-7 1:43pm 5/27/16 Completed at 2:54-that took a LONG time for two ladies to have a quick lunch!!! All bc of the horrible service!!!! Previous review It was Easter Sunday and not very crowded. I'm surprised bc every other place we tried to eat at was closed.  We ordered two appetizers and a 1/2 pizza and salad.  I was a little disappointment that my salad was so small. But the bar tender was nice enough to et more lettuce for me. Food was served fast, it was average. Nothing to brag about. Just a little bit of constructive criticism. Since the bar tables are so close to the bar tenders. I don't suggest they talk about their personal lives so loud.  That's all :)"
Cheryl L.,"San Ramon, CA",7,50,150,5.0,1/16/2016,"Great customer service! Char was an excellent waitress! Two thumbs up Char! 1/16 - today was also a great experience. Our mac'n'cheese looked horrible so our waiter returned it and Junior, the Manager, came to make sure everything was ok. Thumbs up Junior!"
I M.,"East Bay, CA",2,145,9,3.0,5/31/2016,"We love the BJ's chain. Unfortunately this particular franchise was disappointing.  The average here on Yelp is 3 stars, and I agree. But for a BJ's it should really only be 2 stars.  The good: - Friendly and attentive service. Others here on Yelp seem to disagree, but ours was really good. - Clean and new looking premises, interior, bathrooms. The bad: - Caesar salad looked good, but in no way tasted like one. Just couldn't figure it out. Disappointing - Deep dish pizza (that's why I come here for) was bland and doughy. If we had had more time I would have sent it back to the kitchen. - Asian dinner salad looked like a mediocre mini salad from your favorite fast food place. In fact, it was just a bit bigger than the Caesar side salad. After expressing my deepest disappointment I got a new one. But even that looked skimpy. Weird.  The ugly: - There wasn't one, luckily."
Asher B.,"Rodeo, CA",133,2,8,1.0,11/25/2016,Made us wait 30 minutes before they let us know the pizza we ordered was unavailable. Then tried to charge us for an order of fries we never got. Worst service ever.
Tyson R.,"Brentwood, CA",5,5,1,2.0,1/27/2017,"I really like BJ'S and have been a fan for at least two decades. However, over the past 18 months or so, their Happy Hour has gotten worse. There prices go up and portions get smaller. Their Happy Hour is only $2 off when it used to be half off. As for their beer, which is always delicious, isn't even a good value anymore. It costs then less than $0.10 per pint to make, but their Happy Hour price is still $6! I'm going to try a find a new place in town! Any recommendations?"
R M.,"Pittsburg, CA",0,3,,5.0,4/15/2016,"Unexpectedly Amazing! The hostess was sweet, our table and flatware were spotless, our server, Dominic, was attentive, kind and knowledgeable, and the food was hot and tasty!!! We enjoyed the lemon chicken, and the deep dish pizza, both were fantastic. I have had Chicago deep dish, and this pizza was a very close second. The chicken was tender, well seasoned, and served piping hot. Thank you B.J's for a wonderful dinner!!!. Only downside is the restaurant is very loud; however, perfect place to bring the children :)"
Chelcie C.,"Martinez, CA",0,4,,1.0,8/11/2017,Cold food and shitty service. Gave them several chances to make a good impression and they failed all 3 times. I would give 0 stars if it were a option.
Bailey B.,"Brentwood, CA",0,1,,2.0,3/6/2017,"Called in on Saturday around 7pm for a party of 3 and was told it was an hour wait so I asked to be put on the call ahead list. Got there to check in, as I was told, at around 7:30 and then was told it was another hour long wait. Took my name off the list and left.  If you want to go there, you should probably make reservations like a week in advance. Or just go during the week when no one else is there.  The only good thing about this place is the Pizooki... only reason why I'm giving it 2 stars. Plus the service isn't too bad when you actually get seated."
Gary B.,"Discovery Bay, CA",0,24,1,2.0,7/17/2017,"Kinda disappointed with our dinner yesterday.  My grand daughter ordered a salad requesting certain deletions. Waiter said no problem.  Well, she didn't get what she requested.  Waiter said he would bring out a replacement but it never arrived. Instead, we were credited on the bill for her dinner but my grand daughter went hungry as she didn't eat the original salad as she was waiting for the promised replacement. Then I ordered a half rack of ribs which comes with two entrées. I asked for a baked potatoe and the waiter asked if I wanted that ""loaded"". I said I would. He failed to advise me that was an additional cost so when the bill came I questioned it. The waiter had to go ask someone but came back and said the additional $2 was for the upgraded baked potatoe. No big deal but waiters should advise when there is an additional cost for an upgrade which I didn't know was an upgrade. Otherwise the food was good."
Joey N.,"Brentwood, CA",89,46,21,5.0,12/13/2016,Great food and beer selection!  Fast and friendly service.  The servers and bartenders have always been good to my family and business associates. Keep up the good work in Brentwood!
Andi E.,"Antioch, CA",0,14,,2.0,1/29/2017,"Really disappointed. Don't get me wrong, the server was great!! I would love to give more stars for the server, but everything was just wrong. Called ahead at 12 for a party of ten, got there at 5 and the hostesses had no idea we were coming. Had to wait 30 minutes just for another hostess to tell us that they didn't have a server that could handle a party of ten..... finally get sat and everything was going fine, waited super long for food and had a manager come by to say that something went wrong with the order.  Could tell that the server was trying to juggle multiple tables, but then when it came to dessert, it took 30+ minutes for a sample platter of pizookies to come out! Don't think we will celebrate birthdays here again, I thought they would do a birthday pizookie but I think the server forgot."
Ema P.,"Pittsburg, CA",22,33,32,2.0,10/30/2016,"Only rating two stars. Read on to see why. I'll post pros & cons, and then add details.. - PROS: *Food was excellent! Delicious. I ordered the lemon thyme chicken and my husband ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken. Both were very good, and our food came out fast, fresh & hot.  *Waiting time to be seated was about 10 minutes, which was good for me. - CONS: *I highly disliked our waitress. She BARELY came to check on our table, and we waited THIRTY MINUTES for her to come, because we had finished our dinner. I needed a box and we wanted to order dessert. I had to ask the hostess to track her down.  *The bathrooms are disgusting, there's only about 4/5 stalls and they. were. FILTHY! We came to dine here on a Sunday, around 8:00 pm. I usually don't ask to speak to the manager of restaurants, but I'm definitely complaining about our waitress' lack of customer service and hospitality. I understand if you have a lot of tables, but tonight was fairly calm & we should not have to wait 30 minutes for a waiter to check on us, sad to say we didn't order dessert. I spoke to the manager, a nice man - and he apologized and explained to us that it was a miscommunication due to our original waitress going on break. He offered to buy us a dessert to go, on the house but we declined. He also asked if there was anything he could do to make it better, but I said no. I simply just wanted to let him know that we were unhappy with the service. I did explain to him though, that everything else was fine as far as food went. Probably won't come here for a while again. Sucks because we're new parents and this was one rare occasion where we were able to leave our baby with family to enjoy some quality time out to dinner, without our little one.  I wrote this review while still sitting at our table, waiting to pay for our food. The manager took our cash to pay for the bill, and I asked him if I could get a little box to put my leftovers in. The waitress came with a receipt and our change, apologized but didn't bring a box. It might be a little detail, but I can't help but feel as if the manager blew me off, wasn't listening and didn't communicate to the waitress to bring a box for me as well. Eh. Not a cool experience. Boo for BJs!"
Pat C.,"Brentwood, CA",58,67,,1.0,12/11/2016,"Had a tough day and decided to treat my kids to dinner (5 of us).  After we ate, waitress had to go on  a break so, even though we still had dessert coming, I paid the bill. Big mistake. We never received our dessert and the replacement waitress didn't have a clue. After waiting 30 minutes ( yes we asked to speak with the manager) we got fed up and left. Manager never came to speak to us. I'm sorry I paid in advance."
