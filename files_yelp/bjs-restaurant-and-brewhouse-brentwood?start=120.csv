Rose M.,"Brentwood, CA",2,29,15,1.0,10/28/2016,"My fiancé and I had dinner here last month and we didn't have a server for the first 30 minutes. Our table and menus were also very sticky.  At one point I thought we had a waitress but she was always busy talking to people she knew, I wasn't entirely sure if she was our waitress or not. I could tell other customers were getting impatient too. Having worked in restaurants myself, I understand when service is lacking when overwhelmed by a lot of tasks. However, this was not the case and customer service was just not there."
Katie H.,"Brentwood, CA",44,5,2,1.0,3/9/2017,Food is not good at all.  In the begining we went there and the waitresses were so attentive. And that stop.  The food was food also and i loved a bit of my hometown hamburger pizza..took it off the menu.  Tried other stuff...not impressed..
Sandy B.,"Brentwood, CA",0,1,,2.0,8/1/2017,"I ordered the sliders off the appetizer menu today for my lunch.  They were supposed to come with grilled onions, pickles, lettuce and tomatoes (according to the menu).  All I got were 4 sliders with a quarter sized smearing of ketchup on them.  I asked the waitress where the rest of the vegetables were, she took my plate away.  When she brought it back there were 3 slices of tomato, no grilled onions, no pickles and the same wilted lettuce as before.  She said ""the onions were on the bottom of the sliders"".  Well, no they were not.  Nothing like having the waitress tell me I'm wrong!!   And she never came back to fill our water glasses. Not sure I'll be going back there!!!"
Niall M.,"Antioch, CA",16,320,60,4.0,7/8/2014,"I am having this argument with myself. One half of me says that really it is just OK. The other says, look, your the Duke, your loyalty card shows you have spent $1500 here just on food, you have to like this place better than three stars. Well, I can attribute all the money I spend here to a lack of decent competition. But then I have to admit that their Tatonka stout, though totally different from a good pint of Guinness, is my favorite beer after Guinness and I wish I could buy some to take home. And I have to  admit that the menu is very extensive with some very nice items. As long as I sit at the bar service is pretty good. A reluctant four stars. Tip: Stay away on Friday and Saturday nights."
David W.,"Brentwood, CA",16,209,8,1.0,4/8/2016,"Every time I come here I'm disappointed.  I don't know what happened to the giant burgers, tasty pizzas, and fun appetizers.  Of our four meals one burger was good.  One was luke warm.  Mac and cheese had to go back because it was so cold, then it came back nuclear hot.  The mini pizza was depressingly doughy with no flavor.  The calamari was over cooked.  The fries, how do you mess up fries? The fries tasted like they were either bathed in mineral oil or cooked in oil from 2 years ago.   Everything was awful.  I wish I had thrown my money in the toilet.  It was so bad the table next to us dined and dashed after complaining about their meal and hostess experience. Please for the love of food, go somewhere else if you want food.  The drinks are okay though, if I must say something nice. edit to add this....Our waitress was great.  She was working as hard as possible to deal with the crowd she had in her section."
J C.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,5,,2.0,9/22/2016,"Food was okay, didnt have a server so hey had to find someone for us. Server didnt really seem to care. There was a lady with tattoos on her arm she was really nice but was not our server."
Morgan T.,"San Francisco, CA",0,4,,2.0,7/25/2017,"Food is great, but the time it takes to get the food is incredible. Two visits ago, our table was not given a waiter. Several people walked by and looked at us, but no one stopped to offer us water or anything. After 30 mins, we had to walk up to someone and ask for someone to help us. Today, our waitress took our order and then didn't come by for another 20 mins. This was at 3pm on a Tuesday when it wasn't even busy."
Tiffany D.,"Antioch, CA",93,96,3,4.0,12/5/2016,"Had lunch here during one of the busiest shopping times of the year (and on a weekend), but we had no problem being seated quickly, and we received excellent service from our server Frost (yes, that's his actual name :) Great guy and even though the restaurant was pretty busy, he was very attentive.  Husband had the brisket burger and I had the chicken alfredo and we both shared the calamari appetizer.  Food was delicious and arrived quickly.  It can get a little loud with all the TVs going and the acoustics from the high ceiling, but other than that, we really enjoyed our lunch."
Scott H.,"West Tampa, Tampa Bay, FL",97,4,1,2.0,7/7/2017,"Walked in, the guys at the host stand just stared at me, awkwardly (I'm just an average guy). Finally, Asked ""table for one?"". I was met with ""you can go to the bar."". This isn't the first time the front desk people acted rudely. I turned right around and walked out. Host stand people are your first impression. They messed that up."
Breana M. W.,"Los Angeles, CA",88,18,16,2.0,12/31/2016,"Some friends and I went on NYE. Our waiter was nice and the food was good, service is not great though. We were waiting for a bit for water and the rest of our drinks. They gave us appetizers with no silverware or napkins, so we had to wait for them to bring that. A friend and I shared a pizza (the flat one) and it wasn't cut so we couldn't eat it. We had to ask them to cut our pizza into slices. Our wings appetizer was BBQ flavored, but BARELY had any BBQ sauce on them. I asked if I could have someone sing to me for my 25th bday (on New Year's Day) and get a complimentary pizookie. I only had one waiter sing to me (when another table had 4 waiters sing) and I couldn't get a birthday candle because ""they ran out of candles."""
Jo N.,"Castro Valley, CA",192,17,20,5.0,11/25/2016,"Michael Z thinks outside the box! When it comes to beer suggestions,  he nailed it. Even  sneaking in stuff I wouldn't normally try, based on my description of what I like.  Great job. And the sour was off the hook!"
Roxanne A.,"Pittsburg, CA",58,152,39,2.0,9/7/2016,"I HATE to give this place another bad review because it's hella convenient to go to and the food isn't that horrible but I have to. After my last review I spoke with the manager shortly after and after a few months I decided to give this same spot another chance. Everything was perfect from the service to the timing to the food I did not have one complaint AT ALL and I was lucky enough to come when it wasn't too busy or crazy packed. HOWEVER, the past week I came back again with my boo because I discovered the Oreo pizookie is my new favorite ever and (all the calories for one day lol) and I was craving it! We came later in the day but at a busy time on the weekend and was happily seated right away. Our server was friendly and quick. Our orders even came out pretty fast. The reason for the bad review is because the ranch that came with my man's buffalo wings had a piece of IDK what... I wish I took a picture of it but it was just nasty I pretty much lost my appetite. Our waiter said it looked like a piece of calamari (which we DID NOT order) but because my man found it because he chewed on it he said it had to be HELLA undercooked because whatever it was felt like a rubber band. EW. It also had a little cube in it which could have been a potato... Again we won't and do not know. TO TOP IT OFF... Someone ended up leaving with food poisoning, I am just lucky it wasn't me this time. I don't think we will be back here..."
Damon B.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,14,4,5.0,1/16/2017,Always consistent with delicious food.  They have the best salads in town and every dish is excellent.  Friendly staff and a great place to go watch a game.  This place is always busy but worth the wait.  Keep up the good work BJ's.
S K.,"Harrisonburg, VA",0,24,19,5.0,6/1/2016,Always a good time at BJ's.  Excellent service. Extremely courteous. Food quality never disappoints.
Elaine W.,"Pleasanton, CA",14,1,,1.0,10/10/2017,"I like BJ's food well enough but their option to do mobile ordering is a nightmare. I have a daughter going through chemo treatments and several people want to bring meals and many others say that they would like to online pay for a meal that can be delivered or picked up. To order online first to have to set up a BJ's account, then when it's time to pay the only thing that will allow you to pay with is a screenshot of a check. No option for the donor to give all of their credit card information over the phone and Order directly with the restaurant. Most people prefer to pay with credit card. There are protections for you if somebody gets a hold of your information with a credit card, and that protection is not there with a check tied to a checking account. Very disappointed when trying to get help from the BJ's in Brentwood, ca.  I was put on hold so long I gave up when I asked to speak to a manager."
Joselyn G.,"Pittsburg, CA",1,5,,5.0,12/8/2016,"We had such a great experience having dinner here on a Friday night. Our server was Casey and she was amazing! I don't know if she has any children but she sure did understand what it's like to have a hungry child at the dinner table. When I asked for a kids mashed potatoes for my 11 month old son, she walked straight into the kitchen then right back out. It's the littlest of things she did that made our dining experience great. We ate here on Veterans Day Friday so it was pretty busy. We usually get pretty lucky when we visit BJs some days we sit at the bar and we'll get Ashley who is also great. I think we might come here a little too often, one day we sat down and Ashley approaches us and asks ""Hey guys 2 Simtras?""  we appreciate her remembering us. Definitely recommend."
Jeff Y.,"Oakley, CA",0,42,,4.0,7/8/2017,"It was still a packed house at 9 PM on a Friday night.  Luckily my wife got a booth in the bar area so the wait was minimal.  Service was pretty good.  When we needed something, the server (Tabitha) was fairly close by.   My wife's food was missing an ingredient, but Tabitha was able to take it back to the kitchen to get it fixed.   I ordered the cherry chipotle salmon which tasted fine, but it was skimpy on the couscous.   A great option is the pizookie trio which lets you try three ""mini"" versions of the dessert cookie (comes with a scoop of ice cream too)."
Christina S.,"Antioch, CA",6,17,10,1.0,3/10/2017,"I am normally pretty happy with this place. I love the one in Sacramento, that was an awesome experience. I've only been to this BJ's one time for dine-in, once for order out, and then I tried to do curbside this last time. No where did curbside tell me I had to call a number before I could pick it up, so we sat there looking like an idiot for a while waiting for a food. Meanwhile our food is getting cold and nobody even called to see if you were coming yet. So the pizza that we always order was less than appealing this time. There was almost no sauce, it was crispier than a cracker, and couldn't even to the edge pieces. I was really disappointed with the pizza and I spent almost $100 period I was too tired for my day at work to bother going in to make a complaint. And I also asked her Ranch, and they never gave it to me. That's actually the second time that's happened to me there. And then when I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, I told the waitress that it was for my kids and I wasn't sure about it cuz I never ordered it before. I asked about size, but I didn't realize there was red pepper flakes. I would have appreciated her to take notice when I said it was for my kids, and she could have told me that it is spicy. We not throwing it away. I'm really disappointed at the service and the lack of consideration from this certain location. I find this really sad because I love a lot of the food at the other locations comma I just wish it was as good at this location."
Nancy S.,"Antioch, CA",0,6,,1.0,12/2/2016,"I ordered the Deep Dish Baked Ziti, the cook left out the meatballs, pepperoni and the marinara sauce.  The manager was walking passed me and I asked him if he could bring me marinara sauce.  He looked at my food and he could see how dry it was.  He did bring me some marinara sauce.  When I started to eat my meal, I realized that the cook left out the meatballs and the pepperoni.  I didn't say anything until the waitress brought the check.  I let her know there were no meatballs in my meal, she proceeded to tell me that meatballs are not in this menu.  I told her that that menu had the meatballs, marinara sauce and pepperoni. It appears that the people who work at BJ's do not know what goes in there dishes they serve."
Kathy S.,"Brentwood, CA",63,34,,4.0,11/13/2016,"I have had a real problem with this restaurant in the past with bad food and bad service. However, the past few times my husband and I have come in, we sat in the bar area and the service and food has been really good. Tabitha is a great server who checks on us frequently and always has a smile! We've had wings, sandwiches, and deep dish pizza and all has been good."
