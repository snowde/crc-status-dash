Scott A.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",151,27,52,3.0,1/31/2015,"BJs has decent food. Nothing that will blow your mind, but nothing truly awful either.  The atmosphere is typical for a chain restaurant. Large seating area that only rarely is filled to capacity, TVs throughout the restaurant and bar area, mediocre service and wait staff. Pizzas are probably one of the better choices on the menu. Dinner salads are pretty good as well. Had a casserole made of Fritos and ground beef once. I wouldn't recommend that. Peasant food. Overall, it's a chain restaurant experience. Decent for Brentwood where there aren't a lot of home grown alternatives, but you'd probably be better off going somewhere not quite so generic."
Deborah B.,"Oakley, CA",1,3,,1.0,9/8/2016,Very very loud!!  My husband and I could not carry on a conversation without screaming at each other.  We both had a head ache when we left.  Never had a chance to try the food
Marlene L.,"Antioch, CA",0,23,,5.0,5/17/2017,"Went for lunch today on a overcast day so my friend & I thought the unlimited soup and salad sounded good.  We started with the chicken tortilla soup which was delicious!  We then had the beet & arugula salad that was topped with goat cheese.  Beautiful yellow & red beets & oh so good.  My friend tried the clam chowder which she also enjoyed.  Our waitress was exceptional ( I'm sorry I didn't get her name but a petite brunette).  She was very attentive & did not hesitate to offer more soup, salad & refilled our berry hibiscus tea without our having to ask.  We will definitely be back soon!"
S P.,"Pittsburg, CA",0,5,,1.0,2/24/2017,"I used to really like this place, but won't go back after today.  The restaurant was about 1/3 full.  Still had to wait 5-10 minutes to be seated.  Plenty of booths available and she tried to sit us at a table.  My dad (walking with a cane and clear back issues) cannot handle the chairs and needs the softer booth seat.  So, I asked her for a booth and stated why and at first she just kinda stared at me.  Then she half-heartedly points to the booth in the corner which is huge and meant for like 6 or 7 people.  I was like, really?  I mean, there were a TON of 2-person booths, and that's what she offers?  Finally she went back to the hostess stand and sat us in a ""normal"" booth.  Was it really that much to ask?   Now, onto the meal.  My dad wasn't super hungry, so he ordered a bowl of soup and asked for a roll to go with it.  I ordered the beef dip with extra horseradish.  My dad's soup came out within about 3 minutes, no roll.  The waiter saunters back by about 2-3 minutes later and I had to stop him and explained that we had really wanted to eat our meals together, but if that wasn't going to happen, could my dad at least get his roll WITH his soup?  So, the roll does come out a minute later.  My food, about 5 minutes after that.  So, of course, dad was done with his food by then.  Despite all this their beef sandwich is REALLY good.  So, I could've forgiven it all.  However, I get my sandwich...no fries, nothing with it.  WTF?  And, extra horseradish apparently translates to extra au jus.   Ugh.  I say to the guy that brought my food, I asked for extra horseradish, and where are the fries?  He was very nice and apologetic and did bring the sauce and fries.  BJ's ALWAYS had amazing skinny fries.  Apparently, they don't have those anymore.  Now, they serve the same crap you can get at any run of the mill chain restaurant.  The fries were one of the best things about this place.  Those alone would've gotten me back in the door after the disaster that was today.  Now?  LOLOLOL  FORGET IT.  You don't change the best thing about your menu.  Never again."
Muthoni K.,"Discovery Bay, CA",10,1,,2.0,1/9/2016,"After a movie, me and my husband decided to go to bjs brentwood.  We ordered the clam chowder, calamari, full rack ribs and the skinny margaritas.  The only thing that was good were the drinks.  The texture of the calamari was too chewy and very bland and the sauces that came with it were just as bland.  The ribs were a great disappointed...dry, tough, burnt on the edges.  If the ribs were cooked any longer it would have been like jerky. Even the fries were dried out as well.    It was 11pm when we arrived to the restaurant...wish we had the energy to complain more since the only response we got from our server is that he would let the cooks know.   We spent  $70 for our order.  We could have gotten far better food at Chili's or Applebee's for nearly half the price."
S F.,"Brentwood, CA",0,7,,1.0,5/20/2017,"Bad service! Lukewarm food! I don't often post reviews of places with mediocre service, but this place is just not good. Crazy loud you can't hear yourself think. Two out of three entrees were lukewarm. Servers that don't know their drink menu. Had to ask for silverware and had to ask again because the first set had dirty napkins. Won't be going there again anytime soon!"
Cecy G.,"Discovery Bay, CA",1,12,,1.0,8/10/2016,"I've visited BJ's three times and each time the drinks are watered down, the food is ok and always a long wait time:("
Justin G.,"Richmond, CA",3,5,,5.0,7/27/2016,"Love the bj's chain , ambiance is very welcoming and fun , food is solid and the pizooki is to die for ..."
Max K.,"Las Vegas, NV",12,133,14,4.0,10/17/2016,BJ's offers good service and good food at an affordable price. I enjoy patronizing this establishment and eating the food that is offered. I enjoy drinking the Root Beer!
Suzy Q.,"San Martin, CA",8,309,18,3.0,3/12/2016,"Mahi mahi 2.5- too salty. White choc mac mini pizookie 2.5- too sweet Bison burger 3.5. Side of Coleslaw 2.0 Service was awful- 1.0  The woman was a negative nelly, slow, and did not ask if I'd like more water, how I wanted the burger cooked or what flavor pizookie."
Sean I.,"Oakley, CA",18,124,9,4.0,2/23/2016,"BJ's has gotten a lot better. The service got a lot better in the last few years.  They clearly noticed they had an issue addressed it.  I started using their App and getting feedback cards.  The commitment to improving the experience impressed me. On a side note, the app you can use is fantastic.  You can track the rewards program, sign up for a seat before you arrive, pay your bill, and even order if you wanted to.  It's a really nice touch that helps the dining experience, at least for me.  Only thing I wish they'd do is lay off the Sriracha.  I know it's popular, it just feels like the cilantro of the 2010's."
Robyn J.,"Brentwood, CA",45,315,670,4.0,3/6/2014,"I am definitely a Foodie so its kind of weird that I would give this place 4 stars. They have excellent service. The Bacon Cheeseburger is outstanding. The second time my daughter and I went she decided that we should try their pizza. We asked for bacon and fresh garlic on our pizza. They served our pizza with both items missing. I asked the server about it and she said she would bring some out, we never saw her again. A different Server came out and we advised her of the missing toppings and she said she would take it off of our bill. But, you must agree that the Pizooke (spelling?) is/was delicious. All that gooey melt in your mouth fresh baked cookie with a large helping of ice cream. Although the service was not so good this time. I would go back for the Cheeseburger and the Pizooke."
Rachel S.,"Pleasanton, CA",757,547,284,4.0,6/24/2013,"I've only been to this particular location later at night (like 10:00PM) and sat in the bar. I'm a fan of BJ's in general. This location is right off Highway 4, by the movie theater. Since I've come at later times, we've always been helped quickly and efficiently. The waitresses that we've had are always nice.  I like to order a bowl of clam chowder, strawberry mojito and of course, finish off the night with a chocolate chip pizookie. My friend always just has a beer...and helps me with the pizookie.  We tend to come here since they are open until midnight (even on Sundays). It's a cool place to come chill, relax and catch up with friends. No complaints from me about this spot."
Olivia F.,"Hayward, CA",23,16,53,2.0,12/9/2014,"Tonight I ate here for the first time at this location and it is definitely my last time. When my friend and I walked in, the hostess had some sort of attitude. I guess we interrupted her and her coworkers conversation by coming in. After being seated, our waitress(the only reason why I gave more than one star) Alicia helped us out. She recommended a really good sparkling lemonade and was very kind and helpful to us. The first thing we ordered after the drinks was the potato skins. They were pretty thick for potato skins and also they were kind of tough to chew. For my meal I ordered steak with rice pilaf and chili . I asked for medium and got well done. As for my chili I ate a couple bites , but I realized the soup was on the warm cold side. When I order chili or any food I expect the restaurant to follow food safety temps.  I do NOT recommend this place."
Kate M.,"South San Francisco, CA",5,55,11,3.0,12/27/2016,The soup is prepackaged and salty. There is nothing local or farm fresh integrated into the chain menu. It's an overrated Denny's with nicer ambiance.
Jenn N.,"Brentwood, CA",722,778,894,5.0,4/28/2013,"We have been here numerous times. The PM Porter is my beer. The flatbread sausage pizza is addictive. The balsamic glazed chicken is divine. The watermelon feta salad is fresh and delicious. I paired it with a strawberry splash and everything was right with the world. 99% of the time the food and service are right on point.   We had trouble on one visit (very slow service with a ton of mix-ups) but the manager came out, apologized and made it right. Nobody is perfect and I respect that they acknowledged the situation and handled it really well."
Lynn F.,"Discovery Bay, CA",0,6,,4.0,4/14/2017,"Enjoyed Saturday dinner with my family. Warm welcoming atmosphere, attentive staff, great food and choice of beers.  Thank you."
Sara H.,"Oakland, CA",93,120,1,2.0,6/15/2016,"I, like many of the reviews here, am sorely disappointed in this BJ's location. I sincerely believe they are so corporate, that they just don't care about service. I am well-versed in this location as I have been here at least 5 times. I come back for the GF pizza and GF beer, but when I do, I expect nothing less than HORRIBLE service every single time.....at least I'm never disappointed! The first experience I had was with their takeout. They have a little door to the left of the main entrance to go through in order to get to the takeout/pickup area. I didn't see it and walked through the main entrance. I walked passed the two hostesses, they pointed out the pickup area and I walked over to an empty area....no one there to help me. I continued to stand there for what seemed like 5 minutes. I tried to stop two people who happened to be walking by and I know they heard me, but didn't even acknowledge me. My friend and her boyfriend came in after me wondering what was taking so long. They both tried to get someone to even look at us and nope. Finally someone walked out from the kitchen and assisted us in paying. My most recent experience was two weeks ago. I went there with a couple of friends who were in the area visiting. I prepared them by making sure they knew this was going to be a very long meal. It was 9pm when we arrived on a Sunday evening. There were no other customers in our seating area and the server confirmed we were her only table. We ordered alcohol and it was served 20 minutes later. One of my friends couldn't decide what she wanted so the server left and didn't come back until 20 more minutes later. By this time, we are ordering more alcohol, appetizers, and our meals. 25 minutes later, food finally comes out - but it's all the food; our appetizers and our meals at the same time. We ordered drinks one more time before the end of the meal. We have now been in the restaurant for about an hour and 20-25 minutes. No check brought to the table. I ended up getting up and walking all the way to the hostess stand in order to pay the bill. Needless to say, that bill was around $125. I tip nicely and would have easily given her at least $30, but I don't tip nicely with horrible service. The thing that worries me the most is that corporations come into small cities like Brentwood, don't do anything about their service, and when people no longer wish to settle for that service, instead of changing, they close the store and leave the city in financial peril.  PLEASE FIX YOUR SERVICE BJ'S!!!"
Gaby M.,"Brentwood, CA",0,1,,5.0,4/12/2017,"i love this place, it's so yummy and also great service! i would definitely recommend everyone to come here!"
Kerry S.,"Brentwood, CA",12,4,2,4.0,4/10/2016,So they are trying much harder to improve service. Good food good beer and at least Irene is great give her a promotion he'll make her manager
