Bob M.,"Discovery Bay, CA",0,18,,2.0,10/4/2016,"My wife and I have eaten there several times in the past, and the ONLY positive experience we've had was when we ordered one of their pizzas. Their pizzas are excellent, but our experience dictates that they take very little pride in the rest of their menu items."
Bruce B.,"Oakley, CA",0,3,,5.0,3/29/2017,Great food and above board Service from Alicia. The encrusted chicken with cheese mashed potatoes was tender and cooked to perfection. The Root Beer ribs were excellent as well. We will be back.
Stacey C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",257,262,1102,3.0,12/2/2015,Your standard BJs experience.  Nothing stellar but nothing terrible.  We snagged a booth in the bar and asked the hostess to have someone come wipe it down which they responded promptly.  I started with the House Hefenwizen which has a note of banana to it which I love.  My family split a salad and pasta for the table.  We got the Honey Mustard Chicken Salad which was delicious as always.  We also split the Italinao Vegetable Penne and added chicken.  I personally found this dish to be lacking flavor and thought I could make better at home.  The waiters seemed a little more interested in socializing than checking on their tables. To top off the experience I was very surprised to see on one of their large TV's Judge Judy and not the Warriors game (15-0 at the time) or even a football game.
rachel M.,"San Lorenzo, CA",20,9,,1.0,3/8/2017,"Horrible service. We left because it was taking so long for our waiter to just take our drink order, over 10 mins. Then another 10mins (I timed it) until we got our drinks and we only got our drinks because I reminded the waiter about them. This was the first and last time there. I do not recommend this place whatsoever.  If I could I would give a zero."
Rachel H.,"Tracy, CA",64,13,7,4.0,5/28/2016,Amazing staff that attended all of our party needs! We celebrated our son's graduation here with about 15 people. We pre ordered from the menu a few weeks before and everything was ready for us and was delicious! Thank you so much for making our special day so memorable! We will recommend to all our friends!
Rika H.,"Honolulu, HI",24,22,37,2.0,8/9/2015,"Food is great here but honestly, the food takes wayyy too long to come out. One night, my boyfriend and his sister ordered soups and I ordered a bison burger. Took about 50 mins to come out. We were starving so we almost walked out as my food was really the only one that could possibly take longer than usual (I guess?)  we decided to give it another chance and came during lunch (which btw it was quite empty) all three of us ordered soup and salad and it took about 35 mins. How is that even possible? Soup and salad shouldnt take more than 15 mins during lunch. If the owner is reading this, please figure something out for this. Your food is great but waiting way too long is not worth it. We always want to walk out as we are starving when we are there.  If the food didnt take super long, Id rate it 4 stars. Not 5 because I don't want to DIE for the food, but its good!"
Logan A.,"Pittsburg, CA",0,14,4,3.0,7/27/2016,"Service was slow at first but she ended up being attentive. Calamari was a smaller portion than normal but not bad, sauce was cold. Flatbread tasted great. Went for happy hour, no spectacular deals but still some deals!"
toothfairy m.,"Danville, CA",25,29,11,1.0,1/5/2017,"Ordered two hamburgers. Absolutely no pulled pork on top of mine and husband had a microscopic patty. This place has gone downhill. No more chances. What a shame and soooo mismanaged. Please corporate, do a training here in Brentwood BJs. Our Community would greatly benefit and be able to eat here again."
Mimi R.,"Brentwood, CA",0,11,,2.0,2/20/2017,"Super horrible service, they were out of almost everything on the menu. The lobby was filthy and the server seemed overwhelmed. It took about 50 minutes to get our food and when they brought my plate it was not the same ingredients that were listed on the menu, when I asked them to take it back and remove it from my order the server was irritated and said they were improvising in the kitchen. That's fine but they could have let me know that before bringing it to me. I would have like to have the option to order something else. Never once did a manager come over to apologize or even ask how service was. I won't be returning."
Chad W.,"Lake Havasu City, AZ",295,25,,4.0,9/7/2016,Bjs has great food and drinks! The wait can be a little long for your food sometimes but it's always good
Bonnie Z.,"San Francisco, CA",336,459,632,4.0,5/31/2013,"Weekday lunching seems to be the perfect time to dine here...I came here for lunch on Memorial Day and the lunch specials were still in effect. LUNCH SPECIALS {Half Appetizer Pizza + Half Salad} My mother tried the basil and Italian sausage flat bread  pizza and the house salad. She said it was the perfect amount of food for lunch and she really enjoyed the pizza (mainly because she loves the thin crust) {California Chicken Sandwich Special} this came with half a sandwich, side of fries, AND half a salad. This was a very good deal compared to their normal prices. The sandwich was a bit on the oily side - probably because the sourdough was toasted with butter like a grilled cheese sandwich. Definitely did not skimp on the toppings - my sandwich was overfilled with the chicken breast, pepper jack cheese, avocado, and roasted peppers (my favorite part). Shoestring fries were a bit too dry but there was enough to share b/w 2 ppl. And you can choose b/w 3 different types of salads: house, Caesar, or tomato & mozzarella - choose the latter! It was like a fancy caprese salad.  If I ever have a day off or want to go out to lunch on a weekday holiday, I'll stop by here."
Jessica C.,"Los Angeles, CA",279,118,71,3.0,7/25/2015,"At this location, BJs is honestly alright. I like how it opened up in Brentwood because it's a pretty convenient location. The food there is your standard American food and they have lots to choose from! They even have meals that look pretty healthy if you wanted that option. I love the pizookies! The service here is hit or miss. Some waiters/waitresses are super attentive and some are not. It just really depends if the night is super busy I guess."
Lindsey F.,"Brentwood, CA",0,3,,1.0,3/19/2016,"I usually have nothing bad to say about BJ's other than the occasional rude waiter- (I've never had a rude waitress there BTW) but I was really disappointed the other day. I ordered take out on my way home from work & not only was my food cold but I the burger they gave me me was completely RAW and pink. And not just in the middle- the complete patty! I was so disgusted it didn't even look decent enough to give to my dog so I had to throw it out& it was too late to go back. I used to like take out from bjs because it always seemed better than fast food but after this I will not be returning. 15$ wasted, very disappointing!"
Richard M.,"Fremont, CA",0,24,4,1.0,2/4/2017,Over 30mins to be seated after the hostess said 15-20 than she sat people that came in after us and admitted to doing so. Will never return here and will tell my network and clients to never come to this establishment. Gm never called me after speaking to Rachael the manager. If i could give 0 stars i would this place should learn who the regular customers are that spend 100's of dollars each time.
Ssss R.,"Tracy, CA",0,15,,1.0,1/31/2017,Food was okay. Service kind of lack luster. Loved the bill and having the tip recommendation circled super classy!
James M.,"Gardnerville, NV",1,16,,3.0,4/24/2016,"A bit underwhelming for the price.  I had the bacon cheese burger and fries, and it was $13.  I better have someone feeding it to me for that kind of money.  The waitress brought my wife a mimosa that was small to begin with, and spilled the top few sips.  No offer to bring her a new one.  Food was OK - the skinny fries were great, though - but not worth the money."
Shonna B.,"Pittsburg, CA",8,17,1,5.0,8/24/2014,"Went for Sunday Brunch with a girlfriend and my 2 year old.  Offered a kids menu which I declined, my son eats what I eat. Our waitress was helping another table and a gentleman took our order to speed it along. After I placed my order, the waiter offered a side of fruit...for the little man. Of course!! Drinks came quick and good followed thereafter.   My eggs were perfect, my son thought so too and my friends tortilla soup was amazing.  We both love how they pour in front of you so the tortilla strips don't get soggy.   The waitress checked on is regularly and everyone was all smiles.  I've never had trouble at this BJs and look forward to my next trip."
James C.,"Oakley, CA",63,7,2,5.0,8/3/2015,The pizza and bleu cheese burgers are very acceptable.  A little noisy during the evenings but totally bearable. Varying crowds always provide for interesting people watching if you're into that sort of thing. The beer is not as cold as you'd like but whatever. If you want ice cold beer then get it from your own refrigerator at home
Marlon B.,"Brentwood, CA",0,2,,4.0,7/28/2016,BJ's is a five star to me. It has a nice atmosphere and fast service. And I love the televisions for the sports!
Adrian B.,"San Ramon, CA",4,3,,1.0,4/9/2016,We come here because its the only place open this late to get a drink and something to eat but this last time the food was good the drinks were ok but the service was pretty bad Madelyn was our server she was not attentive at all she look like she was in a rush to get out of there we were gonna order more drinks before dessert but she never came back to check on us and we thought *uck it why make the check any higher with this kind of service at the end of it we just payed and left next time ill just sit at the bar instead of the cocktail area if  im just gonna get rushed to pay and get out ! I know the Business      Im a bartender but i would never rush to the point of rude a costumer out
