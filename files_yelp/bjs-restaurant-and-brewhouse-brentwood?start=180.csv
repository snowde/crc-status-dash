Jesse C.,"Antioch, CA",47,39,30,3.0,5/19/2016,Servers are great. Excited they brought back the watermelon feta salad! Wasn't excited to see a poorly prepared plate of much with too much  vinaigrette no watermelon literally two pieces.. Very upsetting..
Deborah B.,"Antioch, CA",4,21,7,5.0,5/13/2016,"A big shout out to server Ashleigh Boggs at BJ's in Brentwood. Her service is spot on and memorable. She has just the right amount of attentiveness and her demeanor is delightful! We very much appreciate that once we've been served our bill, or even paid our bill, she still fills our water glasses and continues to ensure our needs are met. One of the delights of eating out is to linger, to sip wine and enjoy the company of others. It's rare to get continued service once the meal is eaten, but Ashleigh gets it. I understand that economically, it's just good business to move us patrons along and seat new patrons--but we visit restaurants as much for the whole experience as we do the food, the prices, or the atmosphere. In addition, I must rave about BJ's ribs. It's the only place I order them. Forget Lucille's or Black Angus - there is no competition. I order my ribs at BJ's ""dry"" (without sauce) but they are anything but dry - they are moist inside and slightly crispy outside: perfection! The rub they use is all you need. Pair them with the grilled asparagus and some 14 Hands red wine and you're all set!"
M C.,"Contra Costa County, CA",0,17,,4.0,1/2/2017,"ADDENDUM: The last visit to BJ's was an awesome experience. We had one of the best servers I've ever experienced - wish I could remember his name so that he could get kudos. Hopefully this means their service is improving and not that it was a lucky night and we got the best waiters in the county.  The food is still so-so in my opinion, but adequate. We mainly go for the ice cream cookie desserts which the kids (big and small) love-love. THANKS FOR THE GREAT SERVICE. I've raised from a 3 star to a 4 star. ______________ Let me start by saying this is a complaint. With that said, BJ Restaurant in Brentwood has a great atmosphere and is in a very good location; their staff are friendly. It is a good place to have a drink or a couple beers (Brewhouse) if you are so inclined while waiting for your food. I think this is why they are still in business.  I've been there a number of times for special family occasions - typically a small group. The wait before and after seating is agonizing if you go with an appetite; this last time despite trying to be ahead of the curve and ordering in advance online, apparently their online system was not working properly at their end, the order was lost and there were all kinds of problems straightening it out - it took 45 minutes for the first sight of food, another 20 minutes to get the main course. Our salads were served without utensils - it took three requests to finally get a fork, the hostess at the front desk was not at all helpful, the server seemed overwhelmed and his backup person ditto. This was mid afternoon, intentionally planned to avoid dinner (or lunch) rush and there were many tables and booths vacant - maybe less than 50% capacity. Because of the apparent disorganization I think perhaps there is a management problem. The servers were trying hard to do their job... with a smile, however, the good service mark was seriously missed. This is a fun place to go but you decide if you can endure the wait and possible service problems before finally getting a meal."
Steve H.,"Tracy, CA",31,101,12,2.0,8/3/2015,"Disappointed.  Long wait for lunch despite the fact that the place wasn't very busy.  We ordered Brussels sprouts as an appetizer and asked that they come before the food. after a considerable wait, the server tried to deliver the food first, prior to the appetizer.  Other people came in afterwards that were served way before we were. At least the beer was cold.  What happens to people that only have an hour for lunch?"
Sam S.,"Oakley, CA",0,13,1,5.0,7/1/2016,As anyone reading this would know best pouzouki's ever. All-time favorite the Oreo one. Went there for lunch the other day had the best roast beef dip sandwich I have ever had highly suggested that garlic sauce is to die for.
Bob C.,"Freehold, NJ",56,397,180,4.0,4/7/2014,"Ya know I almost passed this place up even after someone at a client site recommended it to watch the 2014 NCAA Championship Game. Have to say in real glad I did. A screen larger than a sheet of plywood greeted me just behind the bar.  Tap beer galore and the tv sound was behind and above me for a perfect experience.  Bar service was really good, at times, but the food made up for it. I had the Chipotle Salmon and it was cooked perfectly. Couscous and asparagus was as well done. Lastly, I got to check out the decor and woodwork on the way out so appreciate it if you get the chance.  I forgot to mention that the reason I almost passed it up was the Yelp stars. Today it was maybe 2.5 with 230 reviews and that nearly scared me away. I must say stop here, especially to watch a big game."
Sierra M.,"Brentwood, CA",0,23,11,4.0,12/22/2016,"I have been to BJ's a lot. It's my favorite place to go. I absolutely love the food. The sad thing is some of the waiters/ waitresses. I've noticed that some will talk to their fellow co workers and ignore you. The last time I went with my service dog, I told them I needed a 4 seater booth. After about 15-20 mins they called us up and then said they forgot I had a dog. So we had to wait again. The waitress that time was amazing and I had no problems! The waitress this last time (just my husband and I) she kept saying sorry because she had a big table. And left us for a good 15 minutes. She was sparse to find. And when it finally came to the end we wanted to leave. We asked for a military discount. And she left to ask a manager. FIFTEEN MINUTES later she returned. It wasn't worth it. I almost wanted to leave. I had my service dog at home and had to take care of her. I was extremely frustrated with how long everything took. I know having big tables are hard to deal with. But I didn't have the time to wait around. I was very sad because I like this place a lot."
Tom G.,"San Francisco, CA",796,12,43,2.0,4/5/2015,The staff needs to work on customer service skills. They are not that friendly. Waited 30 minutes for a table on a slow day. And waited 40 minutes for our meal. The food is average.
Bryan R.,"Antelope, CA",17,14,3,3.0,4/23/2016,"meh, everything is pretty good, nothing is real outstanding. The house porter is excellent though. Atmosphere is nice. The service is hit or miss, don't be surprised if you have to wait 25 minutes after you finished in order to get your check and leave. Servers will regularly lose track of people. Some people seem to fly in, while some seem to be upset that others are getting served much faster than they were and were waiting for quite sometime. Pizza was a little overrated, as it was a little to pillowy (too much fluffy bread, not enough topping). Hey i can't complain, there is not too many large chain restaurants yet in Brentwood."
Brian D.,"Brentwood, CA",1,5,,5.0,5/22/2015,"I met first date at BJ's for a quick drink and appetizers. We had their great brew and then left after a few hours. Prior to leaving, we pulled down a few more drinks and indulged into BJ's high brow brew. Let's just say that was the moment that I knew I enjoyed her company. Since them we've been back several times. However, there was one incredible evening that we both enjoyed the taste if BJ's Brew and decided that it was time to depart our location. Let's just say that thanks to BJ's we had the most sensual experience of our lives. Hair waving and an explosion or serenity and pure joy!!  Thanks to the atmosphere and ""blonde/dark"" refreshments that pulled the whole night together!!  Let's say that BJ's lived up to their name and very, very satisfied with their service and desire to expedite our true desires!!  Here's to BJ's...succulent and fulfilling -;)!!"
Sofia R.,"San Francisco, CA",572,667,2522,3.0,10/22/2012,"It was my birthday weekend and I wanted a pazookie so I had a small birthday dinner at BJ's. I haven't bothered trying to go to BJ's since the last time I had gone simply because of the wait. Bj's doesn't seem to be quite as busy anymore. I guess all of Brentwood finally go to try it out.  Wait to get seated was non-existent but the wait for food was very long. I ordered a Thai Chicken Mango Salad, gourmet mac n cheese, and a cookies n cream pazookie. My parents got the Maui mahi mahi or whatever.  Mac n Cheese was way too salty. I thought it was just the bread crumbs but it was the entire thing. I had to send it back. The mahi mahi was good. Not enough for two people in my opinion but my parents shared it. My salad was really tasty. Not too heavy. The grilled chicken pieces were a little dry and not too plentiful but it was okay. I wish there had been more chip crisp things because I like the texture. The pazookie was delicious. I've never had the cookies n cream one before. Basically an oreo pazookie. So good. I didn't think the mousse they topped it off with was necessary. I think it made it taste too sweet and didn't go well with the ice cream.  Oh and I had a peach iced tea. I didn't like it because it was too syrupy sweet. Average experience at BJ's. Could have been more chill if I decided to get a few drinks."
RekaYuki J.,"Pittsburg, CA",27,35,63,4.0,7/20/2015,"I went to BJ's on Valentine's day for the first time earlier this year. I know this review this late but I enjoyed the food a lot there. I also really loved the drinks, food and desserts here. I would love to come back in the future to try out more of the menu. This place has a very lively feel to it, and everything looks good. Can't wait to be able to come back and try it out again."
Bernadette M.,"Hayward, CA",610,652,1036,4.0,12/28/2014,"They're take out spots are only up to 9 PM. Place a to go order online for your convenience. I bought a personal sized pizza, a salad and luckily a beer to go! The pizza is as good as I remember it and I really was craving the beer. The cashier was friendly. Also came here for a beer with a girlfriend and had the same blonde beer. The service was friendly as usual."
M N.,"Antioch, CA",254,135,178,4.0,5/5/2014,"I love this chain restaurant. They are always consistent, environment always feels private even when you are seated in booths. It does get loud specially when there are big games at the bar or when big groups arrive.  They have a massive menu book from salads, burgers, pasta, BBQ, pizza, etc....my order always comes out right. I have tried a handful of their dishes. Appetizer for me is always the Calamari, but the lettuce wraps and the sliders are also great. For entree I have only tried a handful and the top 3 are; 1.Parmesan Crusted Chicken     *topped with an Amazing Lemon    Chardonnay butter sauce. 2.Balsamic Glazed Chicken      *Balsamic Glaze is awesome 3.Double Deluxe Burger      *two patties with applewood smoked bacon the Bjs signature sauce will leave you wanting more. Served with your choice of fries. I like the thin cut fries. ....And Finally the Desserts! Pizookie Trio *Red Velvet (idk if they still carry it) *Cookies n' Cream *Chocolate Chunk  Those are my top 3 but all the Pizookies are Awesome!"
Andrea P.,"Walnut Creek, CA",74,5,3,1.0,8/8/2016,Customer service is still extremely disappointing. Our waitress didn't even try and talk to the manager like the said she would regarding our coupon.
Ashley K.,"Concord, CA",0,5,,4.0,1/30/2016,"I normally sit in the bar area, but I decided to get a table this time. Service here is inconsistent but for the most part enjoyable along with the food. had really great service recently from a newer server, Dijon! He was really polite and efficient. Drinks and food came out in good time and overall had a good experience."
Timothy N.,"Brentwood, CA",150,152,24,5.0,3/17/2014,"I've only been here like 3 times, I dunno what it is about the place but I'm not really a fan... Lol But all of my experiences have been good here. Came here the other day for dinner with my family.  Our server was good and did an awesome job with refills/recommendations and such.  We ordered the calamari and a rack of ribs as an appetizer to share, both delicious. The ribs fell right off the bone (: I wanted something different so I had the Bison burger... It came out pretty small but honestly it's gotta be in the top 5 burgers I've had... And I've been to alot of burger places. I asked for it medium well and they did just that. Cooked perfectly. It was delicious... Tasted just like a regular burger thoo, so it coulda been regular beef for all I know lmao But yeah, I come here once in a blue moon, maybe it's the prices? People? I dunno... But it's worth a try lol"
Hello M.,"San Bruno, CA",103,123,12,3.0,3/9/2016,Atmosphere of the place was cool with good energy and clean. Personally I think the portions (and calories) are much too high. It would be nice if they had smaller portions for much CHEAPER. Dinner for two with a couple bar drinks will run you $80 plus tip.
Angela O.,"Antioch, CA",0,8,,1.0,1/11/2016,"Went with my husband last weekend and I have to say it was the last time we will go. Service was horrible.  The minute we walked in the hostesses were rude and unprofessional.  They were all gathered around the front talking about a guy at the bar and who he was sleeping with.  Everyone could hear their nasty comments. I finally interrupted them to get my name in the list for a table. Once we finally got a seat (not because it was that busy but because the hostesses were too busy talking to each other) we had to wait 20 mins for our waitress to come to the table. Megan was just an awful waitress.  Once she finally arrived she took our order and NEVER CAME BACK until she dropped off our check. Never asked if our foods was ok, which it wasn't.  My husband had hot tea!but we had no spoons or sugar in the table for it.  Food was not what we ordered and it was cold by the time it made it to our table. Had to ask another waitress for silverware because Megan couldn't be found. We left without eating half of our meal because we were so frustrated.   Management really  needs to do some training at this location and customer awareness. Would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."
Blanca V.,"Pittsburg, CA",2,9,6,4.0,7/15/2015,"Had the build your own pizza, and I had the vegan friendly deep dish with no cheese and with much rooms and sweet corn. Super delicious. Also had the thin cut fries which were delicious. Our waitress Victoria was so kind and attentive. Had a great experience."
