Jerrid V.,"Brentwood, CA",57,11,,1.0,7/27/2014,"Had dinner with the family this evening and was shocked at the service. The restaurant was so much better when it first opened.  Tonight we waited forever, food delivered was wrong for one person and cold for another. Waiter was completely uninterested.  Overpriced, low quality and terrible service. Highly disappointing!"
Ben H.,"Antioch, CA",8,1,,5.0,1/21/2016,I really recommend this place it all started with the hostess who i think was asian with glasses she was really nice and funny and helped us alot even when we kept asking her various questions about the premier rewards program then the server was amazing he kept up to date with us and kept seeing how we were doing even though it was quite busy . I will definitely come back again.
Debbie N.,"Brentwood, CA",3,3,,1.0,3/18/2016,"I ordered in advance for take out. Santa Fe Salad and Grilled chicken pasta. The grilled chicken pasta was very dry and it looked nothing like the picture on the menu. The Santa Fe Salad is usually sliced breast of chicken I received chunks to make it appear as if it's a lot but it was a very small amount of chicken. It sadden me as to how little amount of avocado,  looked as if it was thrown in the plate where as in the past it's usually served sliced and it would be a half of a avocado. There should of been the strips of tortillas chips there were none. Another tacky thing that really bother me the salad dressing was placed inside the Togo plate on top of my salad. Gross, I am so disappointed in the taste and quality of BJs food. You can see where the focus is on making a better profit than keeping the customers coming back."
Alexis S.,"Oakley, CA",1,10,2,3.0,2/19/2016,"The food is good, the pozokies are the best! But to get a table at times is ridiculous. I only come here on occasions just because I don't want to fight the crowds"
Natalie M.,"Brentwood, CA",0,10,,1.0,9/11/2014,"Well.... Where do I start... Last Saturday the service sucked, food was not fresh. I was informed by our waitress that they are experiencing kitchen delay. We've been at this restaurants a few times-but we never experienced this bad service and taste of the dishes before.  The hostess lady was scratching her shoulder, then her back and other parts of the body-which turned off my appetite right away. Kids menu was not cooked all the way. Lemon Chicken was not cooked good. At the end waitress provided us to sign the check in the filthy black leather book. The whole atmosphere was dirty. Not coming back again."
Jeff M.,"Brentwood, CA",0,3,,1.0,5/19/2015,"I decided to take my wife out to dinner Friday night because our pre-school was offering free babysitting from 5-9.  I started off with a Jack and Coke and the wife had some fruity drink.  I recall the food being good when I visited the Foster City location years ago.  We had the chicken pot stickers that were just OK.  I ordered the Jambalaya and wife had  the Buffalo Chicken pizza.  My Jambalaya was terrible, it was basically a bowl of rice with a thin top layer of dime size shrimps and diced sausage and mashed tomatoes & red pepper ($16).  It was a very poor attempt at making Jambalaya.  I tried a bite of my wife's pizza and I am not kidding I've had better frozen pizza!  The crust was soft like a piece of wonder bread.  The chicken topping was sparse and totally dried out.  The waitress came back an asked if I wanted a take out box for what looked like a full bowl of rice, I looked at her a little longer than I would've and said no thanks. This is a newer restaurant in Brentwood and it's beautiful building, great bar, awesome TV's everywhere but the food really really sucks!  It's too bad someone spent all that money to make such a nice place but not serve good food.  There is 0 quality control happening on the food that leaves the kitchen.  Red Robin or Chilies blows the doors off this place in regards to good tasting food.  I felt ripped off an left $100 poorer"
Kayla S.,"Discovery Bay, CA",9,5,5,4.0,8/30/2014,Friend and I sat at the bar on a busy Saturday night and were quickly helped by a server. He gave me a good recommendation on a light beer (blonde brew) and a sample. Service was quick & pleasant and the food was pretty good. I'd come back for drinks.
Tiffany M.,"Stockton, CA",0,11,14,4.0,10/2/2015,"Great service, delicious food, fast, just a little on the chilly side with where we had been seated."
Jessica A.,"Antioch, CA",0,15,,5.0,8/10/2016,"Love BJs! Me and my friends always come here, sometimes the service isn't so great but the food is always amazing. The chicken tortilla soup is my favorite and they have an amazing bar! I love that they always send me free pizzokies and appetizers through the rewards card, definitely one of my top places for a good lunch."
Leo D.,"Antioch, CA",137,98,7,1.0,7/18/2014,"I'll give a star for the hostess who seated us, when our party had all arrived she promptly seated us. ordered a cocktail .... waiter tells us it's happy hour and if I go to the bar and order it it's cheaper......really, why should it matter where the drink was ordered ? service was ""okay"" , could have been a little better considering it a ""popular"" resturaunt ordered chicken Alfredo , chicken was dry, really dry, sauce was ok I visited here when it first opened and it was ""fun""...... today's visit was ""blah"""
Samarian B.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,42,1,1.0,6/24/2014,"Waitress was rude and forgot parts of our order. Floor was extremely greasy and my fiance and I almost slipped multiple times. The kicker was that even after forgetting parts of our order, our waitress tried to get us to sign up for a member card.  The icing on the cake was wanted us to order desert, and we replied with no thank you. She then insisted, saying she could get us one for free, and that's when we had had enough.  Been to several other bjs around the east bay, and this one is an insult to their service and quality.  Never coming here ever again."
Candice S.,"Antioch, CA",9,292,,2.0,12/14/2012,"I've been to BJ's twice in the past year and I can say with certainty that the customer service has definitely gone downhill. The first time I went to BJ's was about a month after it just opened and I had a $50 gift certificate for the place. I went with a friend and we were seated immediately on a very busy night. Now, our waiter was a bit pushy and didn't even let us look at the menu for longer than 2 minutes before he asked us what we wanted to drink. In my head I was like, ""Dude. You have a 4 page drink menu. This is going to take a while."" but I ended up just ordering a water because I felt so hurried. After we got our drinks, the customer service flowed better and the food I had was excellent. I had a jalapeno burger with avocados and my friend had an assortment of seafood options. We also shared an appetizer and had red velvet pizookies between us for dessert. Fast forward to a few weeks ago. I'm going to eat with my family and it's about 6:30pm. It took our waiter 15 minutes to even ask us what our drink were, an addition 10 minutes to get us our drinks which was just 2 waters and a Midori sour. Then we waited another 10 minutes to order our food. And get this, we waited 55 minutes to get 1 pizza. 1 large pizza took 55 minutes and everyone around us who came in after us was getting served by her. Except us. Now, I've been to pizza joints where I got quicker service than this. After we ate our pizza we waited even longer to just get our check. I think we left the place at around 8:30/9 which is unacceptable considering we were there so early and that we ate very quickly because we just wanted to leave at that point. All in all: the food is good, but the customer service is the worst."
Steven G.,"Modesto, CA",84,945,143,4.0,12/31/2012,"This is yet another location I hadn't been to until the other day. The restaurant is beautiful inside yet smaller than the other locations I've been to. We were seated quickly although there was a packed house and our waiter began attending on us shortly thereafter. I ordered my typical fare and it was as good as the other locations, consistency is key. I enjoyed my visit but more importantly the company I had that day made the visit much more enjoyable!"
Joe C.,"Discovery Bay, CA",58,52,3,5.0,7/19/2015,"Had the Chipotle  Salmon. It was excellent! Chris was our server, one of THE BEST Servers I've had in a really long time. I will  be back."
Angela D.,"San Francisco, CA",176,144,504,1.0,2/26/2013,the two biggest reasons I dont think I'll be going here very often: 1. they dont know how to properly make a snake bite 2. they dont know how to cook a burger medium rare.  I really want to love this place since I am in love with the BJ's in Daly City but this location just cant seem to get it's act together. Ive been there multiple times and always left disappointed. At first I didnt mind because they were newly opened and always super busy but at a certain point things like non-existent waiters and overcooked food shouldnt be a constant problem.
Marisol C.,"Pittsburg, CA",46,2,,1.0,1/23/2016,"The girls at the front desk who check you in are so incompetent. Second time here in a week and they're the worst part of the experience. They always have their backs to the customers. A group of 3-4 girls and no one ever turns or greets until you're in their face. I just witnessed one tell a customer that they never gave their ""name"" when my husband and I saw and heard that he did. Extremely unprofessional! How disappointing. Last time we came we got the wrong dressing on the salad, the waiter never came back with a drink. How can something so simple be so difficult? We love the food here but the people need to be a bit more professional or need to stop huddling and chit chatting."
Juan G.,"Antioch, CA",5,7,12,5.0,12/26/2015,Our waitress was awesome we were having dinner and a movie they offer discounted tickets for AMC Sarah the bartender makes really good drinks! Ordered the guacamole hamburger was delicious but the calamari is to die for very crispy
M F.,"Antioch, CA",0,6,3,1.0,8/15/2014,Ordered the 2 for $22 special. The tomato soup was great. The pizza (great white) was horrible. Easily the worst white sauce pizza I ever had. Service was horrible waited over 30 minutes just to get our check. I will never get a white sauce pizza from here again. Would rather hit up Mountain Mike's.
Kelly R.,"Brentwood, CA",32,52,10,5.0,10/30/2015,"Tried the north Shore Mahi Mahi and shrimp and it was 5 stars! Fish was fresh, sauce was light and tasty, and guilt free! I could only eat half (and I came in ready to put down/in serious starvation mode). This may soon be my new go to! Great price point too for 14.95"
andrew d.,"San Mateo, CA",47,3,,1.0,1/14/2017,"I'd give them zero if I could. On 1/14/17 at 12:45pm I Walked in with my 6 year old daughter and had the couple that walked in, in front of me immediately seated. I was told it will be a few minutes wait. No problem, my daughter needed to go to the bathroom. As we came out of the bathroom the people who came in after us were getting seated. The people behind them approached the counter to be told by the same girl there's no wait right now, and we're walked pass me to be seated by a server. So I asked her how much longer and she said there's still a wait. Wouldn't tell me how long that wait was, and insisted I needed to move so she can help the people behind me. The only difference between us and everyone else, I was the only person in the restaurant with a kid! Screw the place and their rude staff! Off to better food elsewhere, and be served by people who won't treat me like crap because I want to take my 6 year old daughter out!"
