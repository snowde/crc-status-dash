Dave ..,"Discovery Bay, CA",1,24,,1.0,10/26/2015,"Don't bother with this place unless your standards are down in the dirt. Ever since this place opened the kitchen has had issues.  Getting your salad, appetizer, and entree all within 30 seconds is ridiculous. We figured out we had to order in stages to get time between courses.  We bring it up to the manager every time.  But then it's no surprise,they get a new manager every couple months.  Either no one stays here to manage, or they keep getting fired, but still no one fixes the kitchen problem. Last time the salad had 3 pieces of lettuce total.  I sent it back for the rest of the lettuce.  The new manger that week of course came to tell me that was a 3oz piece of lettuce.  Really?  Ridiculous  I go to BJ's all over.  This one sucks, don't bother going to it.  Drive to Stockton or Concord.  Better food and no revolving door on the mangers office"
Jon M.,"Antioch, CA",1,4,2,1.0,5/30/2015,How could you screw up a kale / brussel sprout salad? With gross Brussel sprouts and no kale in the salad.
Edward F.,"Brentwood, CA",0,3,,1.0,8/21/2015,"Horrible experience! Food taste was satisfactory, but the food came out quite cold. When asking for replacement soups, was told the warmers not working and new soup out momentarily. Another 20 minutes pass and I ask to speak to manager who comes to table to apologize for the experience and new soups out shortly. A few more minutes pass and we finally receive replacement soups. Waiter (nice enough kid) brings check after lunch complete, and not adjustment made to bill nor sincere apology made. This manager does not understand customer service in the slightest. I don't need an adjustment made for monetary purposes. It should have been made to let the customer know they value our business and overall experience. This was not done. I plan on never returning to this establishment. A quick 30 minute soup and salad lunch turned into a 90 minute fiasco. Avoid at all costs."
Holli G.,"Berkeley, CA",40,110,40,2.0,5/20/2014,"Poor BJ's. This place used to be fun when it was first introduced to Brentwood. It definitely was a nice change up to the usual Chili's and Red Robin dining. In the beginning, servers were very friendly and attentive.  Now it looks like the dining area is run by preschoolers. Vacant tables are covered with dirty dishes, servers are too busy hanging by the IBMs to run your drinks or payment, yuck ladies room. And I don't know about you, but when I am done eating, I would like the check in a timely manner. None too thrilled about being held hostage in front of a table of dirty dishes and leftovers for 25 minutes plus while I wait for my cc to be ran.   This past time our waiter forgot to enter our appetizer and put in our order completely wrong. Our first clue should have been when they weren't writing the order, but rather just nodded and appeared to absorb the info. Nope. Absorbed air.  Management is usually seen walking about, but that's about all. Just do yourself a favor and skip this particular all together."
Rebecca H.,"Dublin, CA",345,2142,212,1.0,4/21/2014,"There is nothing that would compel me to come back.  I'm standing there with a diaper bag, kid, portable high chair, all in my arms, and it takes 10 minutes to figure out what table to seat us in a nearly empty restaurant.  My friend arrives 5 minutes after I'm seated; she sits, 15 minutes later we realize we have yet to see a waiter.  I ask the host to send one over.  We then get a waiter who says he will be assisting us, ""for now.""  Thanks for deigning to be our waiter.  I got the BBQ lunch special, a slider with pulled pork and a piece of chicken.  It was the driest, most unappetizing piece of chicken ever.   The coleslaw was a few scraps in a tiny cup.  The slider was ok.  Good fries .  The bathrooms are nice.  That's it.  Nice bathrooms and lousy food and service.  Won't be back for more."
Kay D.,"San Jose, CA",0,6,1,1.0,12/26/2016,"i went here on xmas eve with my family . horrible , just horrible . first of all , they tried to fit us in a booth for 4-5 people max when our party had 6 people . so after we all ordered, the rush had died down . so when our food comes out , its only 3 plates . 5 mins later 2 more plates come out, including mine . so since my food took longer to come out i thought it would be hot. wrong . the burger was lukewarm and the fries cold . my dad who ordered the same exact as me didnt get his food until 5 mins later so like 10 mins after the first 3 people got their entrees.. this wasnt hot either. so i can eat a warm burger but cold fries, no . so i told them my fries were cold so they bring me another plate of cold fries but this time waaaay too salty . i also asked for ranch for my fries 4 times . until i finally got it by the end of my meal . we were always polite with the staff so being treated like this is unacceptable. so then i asked for the manager and he was in a ""conference call"" at 8pm on xmas eve ..... Suuuuure . lol but they took 3 burgers off our bill so we wouldn't continue trying to contact the manager . whatever i guess , this was honestly tge worst experience i ever had at a restaurant. and to top it all off , all my step mom had all day was dinner at BJs, and that night she got food poisoning... probably from her chicken alfredo. anyways i am so disappointed and will never be coming back . the staff is full of liars who dont care about customer service. oh ya and while waiting to leave i asked for a box and the waitress came back 10 mins later saying im about to grab ur box . 10 mins later & her coming to the table next to us 3 times after she said shed get the box , i ended up just leaving without boxing my food . i wish i knew the servers name because she needs to work at burger king or something with her horrible work ethic & bad customer service . i just cant believe they refused to let us talk to the manager and lied about him being in the meeting . overall , never coming back to this location . all i wanted was a burger & u guys messed up in every possible way .... worst experience of my life"
Christian M.,"Brentwood, CA",11,22,30,3.0,9/16/2015,I like BJ's as a restaurant but this location can sometimes be hit or miss. Not consistent with good food. Came here a number of times & had to send my food back for it being cold or not what I ordered & the last time there was hair in my mom's food. But other times everything was great. The one positive is that whenever I do send it back the waitress or waiter makes sure to try to fix the problem & make sure that I leave happy which I can appreciate. The staff here is always very nice.
K L.,"Antioch, CA",0,7,,1.0,1/21/2016,Me and my Friends went to BJs and it was horrible they drop my pizza and I had to wait another 10 minutes to get another one The waiter was horrible she didn't even greet us only like once she didn't even ask for refills she just took our cups.
Arianna F.,"Oakley, CA",0,1,,5.0,7/20/2016,"I came into BJ'S and this very nice attentive young lady in take out, I think her name was Mayra or Maria helped me out very much. I came in very confused on what I wanted to order but instead of being frustrated she pointed out some of her favorite food from the menu. Made me feel very welcomed. As I was preparing to leave and pay out she asked me why haven't I used my loyalty points. I didn't even know I had any points!! SCORE! Got great food, service, & a discount. Who wouldn't love that!!"
Bruce H.,"Discovery Bay, CA",2,97,7,2.0,9/21/2015,"Lunch, for most working people, is an hour or less. To take 45 minutes to put food on the table after an order is placed...well, it just doesn't work. The food might be ok but not when one is so rushed that it can't be enjoyed."
Dick H.,"Brentwood, CA",5,260,3,3.0,8/5/2014,"Happy hour again.   As always,  food was good, but the service suffered this time. 30 minutes to get our drinks.  Not smooth, seemed confused. Asked our waiter if they sell beer by the bottle (take-out).   He wasn't sure.  Really? ? He checked, and said yes.  It's like $4-5 for a big bottle (22 oz.).  Not too bad, I ordered 3.  When I got the bill, 2 were $10 each!  Good, but not THAT good.  So I passed on those two bottles.  Other than that, again, a good happy hour menu."
S J.,"Brentwood, CA",0,53,6,5.0,6/26/2014,Great value Fresh food Always great service  Great selection of beers and the bartender will let you sample if you want to try a new one  Overall a great place for kids and adults The Pazooki is the kids favorite
Jennifer E.,"Oakley, CA",1,9,,4.0,1/9/2017,love their tortilla soup! but its always super loud. price is about normal as other places. we usually eat there when we want to get this cookie and ice cream dessert. FYI order your dessert right when you get your meal because it takes for ever to come out!
David B.,"Concord, CA",70,17,,3.0,1/8/2016,"BJ's is kind of hit and miss. I didn't really like it the first 2 or 3 times I ate at the Brentwood location. Then I ate at the BJ's in Fremont, and it was very good. Then I went to BJ's in Tracy and it was terrible."
Nicole Y.,"Brentwood, CA",0,14,5,4.0,1/1/2016,"First time doing curbside pick up. Only problem I had was no open spaces. People were parked in the specific ""take out or curbside parking"" and I had to keep circling. I called the number and they were very prompt in coming out. They had a little slip up with part of my order but came back out and said it would be an additional 10 minutes. She apologized and said they were extremely busy as it was New Year's Eve. It was a great experience minus the lack of parking spaces for the curbside"
Kai R.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",620,495,966,2.0,3/1/2014,"Sadly, our experience here was less than stellar.  We brought my mom here when she visiting awhile back so perhaps things have changed??   Took far too long to be seated; apparently, finishing a personal convo is more important than greeting & seating customers in a timely manner.  Our apppetizers were the best part of the meal.  Beer was good, as usual, but the entrees were seriously lacking :("
Andy W.,"Brentwood, CA",0,2,,1.0,3/19/2016,The service is slow. The food is disappointing.  I keep thinking they will get better but they haven't in years. I will not be returning.
Tony C.,"Brentwood, CA",137,109,1,1.0,7/21/2014,"Now lets start off by saying that lunch and dinner are fine there....BREAKFAST is horrible. The breakfast page consists of one page so not much to choose from.  We went for Mother's Day because we always seen the posting for Sunday Brunch but learned it was just the ordinary menu, nothing fancy.  The pancakes were under cooked, you still could taste the power and raw batter...the food took forever to come out and it wasn't busy....I timed the tortilla's on one occasion and it took them 8 minutes to come out... I would say if you're going for breakfast, go to MJ's.....way better"
Ken B.,"Brentwood, CA",14,36,,2.0,7/2/2015,"Had dinner with the wife and two younger kids. We had certificates for free kids meals. The kid meals were fine for them. We ordered a deep dish pizza. I have to say we were greatly disappointed. It was billed as a sort of chicago style pizza. With no disrespect to Little Cesears, it was not as good as their deep dish. There was little to the pizza except that it was delivered in a big deep pan. There was not much in terms of stuff on the pizza. When I consider that the pizza we ordered was well over $20 ( we ordered one topping, sausage) we were very surprised. I tried one slice and my wife one slice. That was it. The server made no comment nor asked how our meal was.  I also had a seared Ahi salad which was OK. Not a lot of variety on it but it the Ahi was good. They do have their own brewed soft beverages and the two kids and I all had the home brewed root beer.  While we will probably return, we certainly wont be ordering their deep dish pizza again."
Cait L.,"Brentwood, CA",0,24,,2.0,5/10/2016,"We ordered the pizookie and were disgusted. There were unmixed bits in it and it was mushy so you could tell it wasn't fully cooked. Also the waitress had an attitude. Like she couldn't be bothered to serve us, a younger group of girls. (The attitude magically disappeared when we gave her a tip)."
