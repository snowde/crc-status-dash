Alex W.,"San Francisco, CA",195,118,69,3.0,6/2/2014,"I can't give a chain restaurant more than a 3 star rating on yelp... I am just really opposed to chain restaurants but BJ's has a really friendly staff and the best beer selection in the Oakley-Brentwood area.  After 10pm ""guest beers"" are a dollar off and all house beers are only $4."
Krystin U.,"Brentwood, CA",1,7,1,1.0,2/28/2014,"The theme in all of these reviews is that the service here is atrocious. It's blatantly obvious that management could care less about their customers. I sent an email about a bad experience I had (which I normally don't do). It's been two weeks and I haven't heard crap from anyone! Not even a sorry. Bjs management, employees, etc, you have soo much to learn about customer service! I can't understand why people even eat here. Your food is sub par and drinks, although good, are way too expensive. Glad I won't be wasting my money here anymore! Maybe would've been different had my email, which was very polite by the way, been at least acknowledged.  Goodbye forever"
Marie C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",158,30,1,3.0,5/5/2016,"This place is just fine. The service is okay, the food and drinks are okay. The only item that really tasted wow to me was their parmesan crusted chicken. Also, it's very very loud in there because the whole restaurant is one giant room and they blast the music in there so everyone is screaming over that. Defiantly room for improvement."
Tim W.,"Brentwood, CA",23,304,5,2.0,6/18/2015,"Service is friendly. Salmon dishes and salads were good. But, the cooking takes quite awhile times. 20-25 min!  Staff did apologize for it.  One day we had ordered a steak. But, it came out all burnt. Manager came out telling us we could order anything in exchange. We ordered something simple, but the server still charged us for it.  Had to remind her. For the price, there are other good options. For the decor, vibe, and environment depending on the social occasion, I can see why BJ's is a good location. But for a family meal, we prefer other restaurants now."
Richard N.,"Honolulu, HI",209,267,112,3.0,10/26/2012,"There isn't anything too amazing, unique or special about BJ's, but its a great place to have a huge group of friends meet up and grab some drinks and some good food.  The root beer is AMAZING.  Comes in a chilled glass, which makes all the difference.   Suggestions: try the pale ale nachos with shoe string fries instead of chips.   avocado egg rolls are always good. its the sauce that makes it (although it is sometimes spicy depending on where you go. all the pizzas.  ALSO - call ahead and put your name down.  could help you grab a table faster."
Kelvin D.,"Antioch, CA",0,7,1,1.0,11/18/2015,"This Place SUCK! Now! They was Alright, nothing Exciting, Except the Happy Hours! But Just last month, they change the Happy hour menu!& Prices! Bad Move! I Would NOT GO BACK! Hello Johnny Garlic, Chili's,Applebee's, Etc!"
Jeannie W.,"Brentwood, CA",0,2,,5.0,7/4/2016,I had my birthday lunch at BJ's Restaurant and was very impressed with the service and great food!  There are so many different foods to chose from!  I look forward to going back and trying something new on the menu each time!
Melody K.,"Brentwood, CA",154,274,395,5.0,12/20/2011,"Not sure what all the complaining is about...my husband and I went here at approx 1:30 for lunch and did NOT experience any wait...maybe those who are complaining about that should not come at a peak time.  As soon as we were seated we were greeted by our super cheerful waitress who took our drink order and gave us ample time to look over the extensive menu. I had the 1/2 California Chicken Sandwich with a YUMMY wedge salad and my husband has found his new favorite burger...The Black and Blue which is VERY tasty.  Excellent food, service and atmosphere...YEP, I will be BACK!!!"
AJ F.,"Antioch, CA",99,20,1,4.0,8/5/2015,"I honestly think this is the best restaurant in the streets of Brentwood. They outcompete everybody in my opinion and I enjoy the atmosphere here than anywhere else. If you're going here, I suggest getting the appetizers. Those are the best thing on the menu. Just look at them and choose which ones seem the most appealing to you. Pazookies are good but they aren't to die for. If you haven't had one and you're curious then I suggest you get one. Good customer service, nice atmosphere, and the appetizers are good. If you're looking for a place to eat in Brentwood and don't have a clue of where to go, save yourself some time and go here."
Ed N Edena B.,"Antioch, CA",0,12,3,4.0,11/2/2015,"We went to the restaurant with food restrictions, only to find that shrimp scampi was no longer on the menu. Our server was Anthony, he spoke with the manager and we were served the most delicious shrimp scampi, ever!!"
Suzie H.,"San Ramon, CA",1,27,,2.0,5/9/2016,"This review is for the curbside/take out. We called in a to go order for curbside pick up. This is the second time we have done this and both times the experience was poor. We ordered take out last night and I specifically ordered a turkey burger WELL DONE and when I got it, the burger was light purple/pink in the middle. I was so disgusted, I threw away my dinner. I guess they don't know how to make a burger well done! Second issue, I asked for a different dressing with my wedge salad and not only did the salad come out sad looking and lack of toppings, but the dressing was wrong!! Third issue, they came out promptly when we called the curbside number to take our credit card payment and then took over 20 minutes to come back with the food( btw we phone ordered our meal over 60 minutes ago at this point) they apologized for the wait and said it was because they were so busy, isn't the reason for take out/curb side to get a meal faster than dining in the restaurant?!? And they don't even provide any utensils!! They should NOT offer take out/curb side service if it cannot meet the restaurant service level or any decent customer service level!  The only reason I gave them 2 stars is because we have eaten inside and had decent service with good pizza!"
Shannon H.,"Brentwood, CA",749,1031,606,3.0,11/9/2011,"I have been quite a fan of BJs since there opening in concord and have never found the execution of there food disappointing in the least so, I was more than ecstatic to find out of there opening  here in Brentwood. Located smack dab in the streets of brentwood, right off sand creek road, this place is an easy eye catcher. I have always loved the modern, rustic atmosphere of Bjs- as of this one as well.  High vaulted ceilings, dark cherry woods floors, large comfy booths- providing a very fun, yet engaging atmosphere (depending on the crowds that is). They certainly have more then a couple of handful of dishes to choose from ( almost compared to Cheesecake Fact) which is great though, can also be hard to come to a decision. My hun and I started with some fruity cocktails. He ordered  the Frosty Peach which is Absolute Mandrin Vodka, Peach Schnapps, Monin White Peach, Monin Mango Puree, sweet & sour mix and grenadine which looked and apparently tasted amazing. I ordered a berry fruit cocktail which I forget the name though it was Divine. For an appetizer we ordered the Grilled Chicken Pesto flat bread pizza. This was incredible! Flavor was superb and it was backed perfectly def a big winner with us! For our main meals I ( It was Sunday afternoon) they offer there brunch menu so, I ordered there Italian sausage and Swiss cheese omelet and My bf ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken. Meals arrived slightly longer then anticipated. My omelet was slightly disappointing in presentation. Its basically the egg and all ingredients put in a omelet maker leaving it perfectly round and the taste of the omelet was certainly nothing great. My guys chicken Parmesan looked quite good and was tasty however, nothing special. Our server was nice ( not as prompt though friendly)  The starter of our meals was on top just unfortunately compared to some not as special plates. I am definitely still a fan and will certainly visit again however, will just stick to deep dish pizzas or try some other dishes."
Flora L.,"Yorba Linda, CA",0,12,,2.0,1/5/2014,"If you're looking for a nice place to dine, stay clear from this particular BJ's, as a word of advice. There's nothing too spectacular about it (the food or the service), and the amount of cons heavily outweigh the pros of going there. It takes, at the least, 30-40 minutes for the food to actually make it to your table - and in most circumstances, that's just for your appetizer. Then when (and if) your entree gets to you, literally anything that gets put onto the grill/stovetop is slathered in oil and, ultimately, unappetizing (which should be expected, as the presentation of their food is also usually very unappealing). The last time I went there, I was with a medium-sized party. Waited and waited and waited for my California Burger, even as those around me (who ordered steaks and such that seem like they would take longer to make than my burger) began to get their orders. Everyone was served except myself; called over the waiter, and mentioned that I hadn't gotten my order yet. The waiter checked into the kitchen and apparently the chef had either overlooked, hadn't gotten, or had forgotten about my order and it was only THEN had he started on it. Basically, was already 40-45 minutes in, and no food. The only good thing I suppose about that was that a manager who was checking in on all the tables came over and we told her about it. She apologized, and took the charge of it off our bill and a free Pizookie. A free California Burger would've been amazing (despite the fact I waited nearly an hour for it), if not for the fact that the burger was unappetizing. Could only eat half as the whole thing was just so oily and mushy. At least the wedges were good... All in all, I've never really had a good experience the few (3-4) times that I've dined at this BJ's. Not really recommended at all."
Erin B.,"Discovery Bay, CA",13,11,,1.0,12/1/2013,"Boy do I want to love BJ's. It's a shame the service is TERRIBLE. Each time we've gone there it gets worse. The last time was a real doozie... We checked in and told the hostess we had 4 including a baby who needed a high chair. So where did we get seated? At an elevated booth where a high chair would be impossible to use. So we asked for a booster seat. Ordered drinks, apps, and my 4 year old's kids pizza (and an applesauce for the wee one). 20 mins later we finally get the kids drink and my soda but my hubby's beer is missing. That took another 10 minutes . We finally order food.  Our entrees come out first. WTH? We have no silverware, no booster for the baby, no apps, no kids pizza or applesauce (which we ordered right off the bat). I had to ask more than once for the manager. She is apologetic and gets things under control. She took the apps off because they were useless and gave us a free pizookie. That was nice and all but really didn't make up for that whole disaster.  At least the food was pretty good. Or maybe I thought so because I was so darn hungry by the time I ate. The white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie was to die for.  Next time we're going out to eat at the streets we'll pick a different spot. BJ's is not worth the hassle (unless it's a pizookie to go)."
Daniel B.,"Oakley, CA",2,23,6,5.0,10/24/2014,"This Resturant is VERY GOOD when in th Brentwood, CA area. They do have really good food and recently for free WiFi. Im using the WiFi on my tablet right how to publish this. It is really good wifi! Watching the Giants game lol"
Roger W.,"Grants Pass, OR",79,303,325,2.0,11/26/2011,"My wife and I finally went to the new BJ's Restaurant in Brentwood. The food was average and the noise was defening. I could not hear myself think. I had the chicken in basalmic sauce with mash potatoes and my wife had the chicken salad. The food was good but people told me the food was great. That it is not. I had one of their beers which I have to admit was good. The nutty bruinette. If you are looking for a super loud environment for dinner, this place is for you.  Service was average. Took her awhile to get to us but then again there was a 1/2 to 1 hour wait to get seated. They did offer us pizza samples while we waited."
Mike L.,"Ewa Beach, HI",10,12,4,2.0,7/23/2015,"The service and food was great once we had a server come to our table. We tipped her generously and thanked her for turning a bad situation into a decent one. However, the hostess' and the management team need to get their game tightened up and ensure customers start out their experience positively. BJ's has great food....help us enjoy it!"
Natalie B.,"San Francisco, CA",4,70,9,1.0,6/5/2015,"I used to looooove this place! The food has gone extremely down hill! The atmosphere is fun and I like to go get drinks at the bar sometimes, but that's about it. I usually feel grossed out and annoyed that I spent so much on food I didn't enjoy. So I stopped going and won't eat there any more. I'll eat at Johnny Garlic's instead."
Crystal O.,"Oakley, CA",48,115,253,5.0,9/11/2012,I love going to BJ just for the small bites apps. they are afforable and delish!! It seems to be a very popular place and is always busy.....The staff is always nice and willing to accomodate! My niece ordered a flatbread pizza that was so good I'd like to order next time I am in. We also shared a Pizookie-I had never had one--AMAZING!! The bar area has the games playing on big screens and looks to be fully stocked with anything and everything you need.
Logan U.,"Brentwood, CA",67,1,,1.0,6/2/2016,"Worst service I've ever received. We waited over 30 minutes for a cookie and the restaurant wasn't even half-way full. Then, the cook comes out to tell us that they burnt it. Welp, I guess we're waiting another 30 minutes."
