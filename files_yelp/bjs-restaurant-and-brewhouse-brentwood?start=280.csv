Amanda C.,"Oakley, CA",3,139,1,1.0,10/20/2013,"BRUNCH- Don't even try.  15 minute wait time and the restaurant was empty. Minimal Menu.  We made our selections and waited a lifetime for the food to arrive.  French Toast Breakfast was ONE piece of French Toast, and it was raw inside, complete goop.  The waitress argued that some people like it goopy and raw. Another lifetime waited  to receive the check. In typical BJ's style, no apologies."
Panchito P.,"Martinez, CA",0,29,,5.0,1/16/2016,"Came here tonight with a friend who has never tried this place.  It started off really bad with the hostess.  We arrived and was told 15 min.  Since it was crowded inside we stood out side the front doors. After getting to cold we came back in. We then sat down and after 20 min I approached them and said how much longer. They said we were called. They said sorry and we will seat you right away when next table opens. We watched two other parties of 4 get seated who came well after us. Feeling discouraged I approached her and asked why are others being seated before us?  She became defensive and made me feel like it was my fault. I said I watched u go outside and call for parties and yet you didn't do that for us. Mistakes can happen but I felt it could have been resolved if we were given next table. We waited 45 min before being seated.  We decided to put it behind us. We were very discouraged and almost left. THEN WE MET OUR WAITER!!!  Christoper S. Was our server. Let me say he not only turned it around for us but made our friend love the place. He knew we were frustrated. He listened, apologized, and said would promise best service. Wow did he keep his word. He was on top of everything. Polite fast in delivery of food and as a special treat he gave us a small desert on the house.  If that is how he serves everyone then this restaurant needs to recognize the GEM they have!! Chris was the face of this restaurant tonight for us.  He made sure the food was perfect and it was very very good. Our drinks were always full and we felt valued as customers.  He's not even a manager. Just someone who loves his job, cares about his company and obviously loves people.  CHRIS you made our night. Thank you. BJ's you better recognize what you have and use him as an example for the rest of your team. He is the only reason why I am putting 5 stars. It's all for Chris, and the chefs who made our food.  Thx again guys and your hostess needs to GO!!!"
Daniela D.,"Antioch, CA",124,13,1,4.0,8/11/2015,Little overpriced but overall very good food. Very nice place for a dinner date. A little loud but satisfactory meal and service. Would recommend for a night out without the kids. Recommend the honey mustard chicken tender salad. It is to DIE for.
Michelle A.,"Vallejo, CA",48,13,23,1.0,10/1/2013,"The menu was huge and thus made it really hard to decide, I went with the worlds smallest steak, burnt to a crisp on one side (the side I couldn't see till I dug in.) Right from the start things weren't good, our drinks we're terrible, service was slow even though it wasn't that busy AND our fried calamari was clearly MICROWAVED TO PERFECTION!!!!  returning? ""me thinks not."""
Will B.,"Antioch, CA",0,10,4,3.0,2/25/2014,"I like BJ's food but have had a few issues with service.  Sometimes it's the wait staff.  Sometimes it's the kitchen.  Not long ago they screwed up and didn't bring my son's food.  They finally brought it out after everyone else finished their dinner.  The manager and host did nothing to make the situation right including not charging us for his meal.   Tonight they screwed up my daughter's dinner.  She order the spaghetti from the kids menu. The kitchen staff put the wrong marinara sauce and put spicy marinara instead. Our waitress told us it was the 3rd time today they did that.  Our waitress, Ashleigh, was awesome on the other hand.  Attentive, apologetic for mistakes beyond her control, and friendly.   Again, hit or miss with my experience here.  Sometimes the service is good.  Seems like I have a bad experience here 1 out of 3 visits."
Riza T.,"Brentwood, CA",39,233,461,3.0,7/13/2012,"Service is better at this BJ's Brentwood, compared to the Pleasant Hill one. The food: Avocado Roll  - isn't as crunchy. It is better at BJs Pleasant Hill. Mahi Mahi Tacos - Too much sauce, the Fried Mahi was dry. Better at Pleasant Hill. Chicken Lettuce Wrap - It was good Rootbeer Drink - Great Ice Tea $40.xx plus Tip. I am happy it is in the neighborhood. It is open late.  They have really great $6 lunch specials."
Darien C.,"Redding, CA",0,31,,1.0,9/24/2013,"Well...the day I wrote this a manager called to express her feelings about my experience. She apologized every way to Sunday and tells me that a new chef is starting soon, and there is a new management team in place. She also tells me that the gift card was actually for $20 bucks and not the $5 I was told in the restaurant. I had chucked it in the trash anyway thinking $5 was an insult. She then proceeds to offer a new gift card, and to invite me and my family back in for a more appropriate experience. I accept her apology and acknowledgement of the experience and restaurant and proceed to give her my address to mail me this ""invitation""....and have heard nothing since. So...not only do I get blown off by the restaurant in my initial visit, I get called and sold on a false apology as well. Thanks BJ's! You've certainly lost my business for good now."
Evan A.,"Antioch, CA",6,17,4,3.0,7/24/2015,Met friends  for dinner. Food was good  but service was slow. But it is Friday and it is Brentwood.
Becki J.,"Oxford, AL",3,161,70,5.0,9/15/2013,"My review is only on our server, Alicia b/c I love BJ's and everything on the menu. We arrived on a Saturday night (drove up from LA for an event)  and had a pager for a 35 minute wait time which I don't think is a big deal. There were a couple free tables in one section but we didn't really question it. Well, our server Alicia comes up to us and asks if we are just a table for two. Why yes we are. She goes and speaks with a manager and comes back and says we can sit in her section. Perfect. She explains that the wait is so long because the kitchen is backed up with orders. No problem, we will order drinks. We place our order and about 10 minutes later Alicia returns with this magnificent dessert called the Baked Beignet because she feels bad for the wait time. OMG...I usually don't order desserts at restaurants but everyone should try this. It is AMAZING!! Our salads came out soon after and maybe 15 minutes later our pizzas came out. I didn't think the wait time was any big deal. Alicia was super attentive and friendly. Sit in her section!!"
Steve N.,"Brentwood, CA",199,453,403,3.0,11/3/2013,"Excerpts from my brain on this visit.... Water tastes like mold- sent back and told the server Can't keep up on a busy Friday Warm salad plates? Wilted spinach like it sat around too long Bison burger was very good but the slaw was dry Flat bread pizza was fine Plates were not cleared as they went On this night, service was subpar. Will avoid Friday and Saturday nights from now on."
Dj M.,"San Francisco, CA",3,102,28,1.0,10/19/2013,Good selection of appetizers & small plates while enjoying brews & cream soda! Slow service! Slowww service. Made the mistake of ordering the 'all you can eat soup & salad combo'. But the 2nd round of soup didn't arrive. Servers came by to check on out table of 7 ONCE throughout our lunch service.  No drink refills. No extra napkins. We borrowed Ketchup from the next table ourselves.
Federico O.,"Antioch, CA",4,71,8,2.0,4/17/2015,The food was good but it took oh so long to get it I forgot what I even ordered that's crazy I only saw my server twice.
Baron P.,"Walnut Creek, CA",2,16,1,1.0,9/4/2013,"This place has gotten worse each time I go there. Last Sunday I ordered a Hand Tossed Pizza off the menu because the picture of it looked so good and it sounded great. After waiting nearly an hour the pizza arrives with a wavy edge that looks more like a bad taco than a pizza, the crust is hardly cooked and the so-called pizza isn't even sliced! What kind of atrocity is that to a poor old Pizza? The service was primitive. Our waiter acted like bringing water, bread and our food was something she never had anticipated doing on her job of two weeks duration according to her boss. We waited an hour for food, requests for fries took 30 minutes, a salad took an hour and the worst food atrocity in my estimation was the half baked and weird hand tossed thing called a pizza which even the manager said was sorry! That's it for me we won't be back! In 50 years of eating Pizza that's the first one so bad that I sent it back! BEWARE PIZZA LOVER'S!"
Irresistable U.,"Antioch, CA",25,80,33,1.0,4/8/2015,"Quick dinner before grabbing a movie. The ribeye I ordered was tasty and was the best thing about the meal - other than the nut Brown ale I was drinking. The meal was served cold, the potatoes were dry, and the roasted brussel sprouts were shriveled and tough. I repeatedly pointed out the inedibility of the side dishes but nobody seemed interested in swapping them out for something decent. Indeed, we didn't even get a discount on our check."
Lorelie S.,"Antioch, CA",142,1,,1.0,5/22/2016,"We were there for 35 minutes today and no one bothered to take our order, even if I talked to the lady that gave us the seats.  We tried to call other waitresses and they just ignore so we decided to get up and leave. Left this place so hungry what a waste of  time!!!!!"
Lidia C.,"Antioch, CA",0,5,1,5.0,6/28/2015,This is my second time coming here and it just gets better. Everything was great!! It came out just like ordered it. Service was excellent. Kelsie was our server she was very attentive and very kind.. I'm really happy we came here I will be returning soon.. Staff was very kind..
Mark T.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",31,148,450,4.0,10/6/2011,"Man this BJ's went up about as fast as an Amish barn!  Thursday evening around 4pm and I was surprised they were so busy, although it didn't effect the service. I noticed some reviews mentioned poor service so either they took note of the reviews or they must be training new servers since it looked like at least 15 servers training and helping people out.   One common denominator when they bring you something and you thank them, several different servers all said, ""It's my pleasure.""  Either they are all very polite and raised in the same Amish home or it's BJ's server policy.   We had the Mozzarella Tomato Salad with freshly grated parmesan, garlic and a balsamic glaze.  The mozzarella was fresh, light and the whole salad just came together well to make a nice dish for $2.95.   The fried artichokes with lemon garlic aioli dipping sauce was succulent and only $2.95 as well.  The artichokes were fried nice and crisp without too much batter and they were bursting with flavor, especially dipped in the aioli sauce!   Happy hour is 3-7pm Monday through Friday and there is also a reverse happy hour 10pm to close Thur-Sun.  $1 off draft beers and 1/2 off mini pizzas which works out to $5.25 a pizza. BJ's combo mini pizza tasted pretty average.  Lots of good toppings but this kind of crust reminds me of the mini pizzas you can buy at Costco or in the frozen section of the grocery store.   BJ's fudge brownie with vanilla iced cream, chocolate syrup and whipped cream $4.95 was cooked in a mini pan and very good albeit a bit undercooked. The mini portabella mushroom pizza with carmelized onions, fresh basil and balsalmic vinegar glaze on the other hand was outstanding!  Flavor came through strong without being too overpowering.  The initial WOW factor on the first bite was noteworthy and made my taste buds say, HELL yeah!"
Audrey S.,"Antioch, CA",14,22,16,1.0,8/18/2013,"Wow! Very dissapointing... It's our first time going to this branch and the service we received was really awful. It was around lunch time, we were seated quickly but the service was slow. It took 30 mins. just to get our drinks, additional 30 mins. to get our appetizer then 45 mins for our meal. The server was slow and noticed that the family who came after us got their food first. Never coming to this area eventhough its convenient and close to home.  I love Bj's but they need to train there servers and practice better customer service."
Ken C.,"Antioch, CA",76,8,,5.0,8/8/2015,"The service is always good. Sometimes it's great. Tonight was great. I think the food here is top notch. I had a Black and Blu burger and it was really good. I am a stickler when it comes to food so believe me when I say, ""The food is very good."" The beers are awesome. They have a beer blend selection where they mix two types of brew. I tried one (red something) delisch. BJ's, you can't go wrong."
Laurie I.,"Vallejo, CA",1,37,,5.0,11/25/2015,This is truly our favorite restaurant. We are here at least twice a week. Our favorite waitress is Maddie because she is awesome. Chris Heridia is also one of the best waiters we've ever met. They remember what you order and treat you like friends. The food is also fabulous.
