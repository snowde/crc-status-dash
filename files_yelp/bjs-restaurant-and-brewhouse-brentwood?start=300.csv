Megan H.,"Antioch, CA",107,2,,1.0,6/7/2014,"I would love to say this place is great. Overall dining the last three times has been so lousy. I usually go during lunch and although I don't have a problem getting sat, I have a problem having a server even acknowledge me.  I understand if you're a little busy talking to your co-workers about their party last night, but at LEAST say hi, and don't act like you don't see me. This happens everytime and yet I keep going back thinking it was random. I have a 14 month old son that will not sit still and it doesn't help that I can't place my order.  I was there on Thursday during lunch and watched table after table get sat after me and receive service. The food wasnt horrible, just ok. The servers don't seem to care.  I would give the SERVICE a negative star if I could."
Bianca U.,"San Francisco, CA",497,385,27,3.0,10/13/2011,"Regular old chain restaurant pretending to be a brewery. The new restaurant/building is bright, beautiful and clean. However, I am paying to have a tasty meal, timely service and competent servers to assist me. I also don't want to pay an arm and a leg for a mediocre meal.  Well, BJ's is having trouble getting a very good vote from me. First of all, the place is packed because it's a new restaurant, so some of the servers might be overwhelmed. But it seems like all the servers I got were still wet behind the ears or had never even served before.  Our order was sent to another table and we waited 30-40 minutes for our food. We didn't get an appetizer, so we were hungry and disgruntled by this point. The waitress was strange and didn't seem very well established with the menu or trying to find good selections for us. Two of the people in our party had never been to a BJ's, so they weren't familiar with the menu. She also didn't know what drink my father had ordered, and that's strange because it is a two ingredient drink that's as old as the hills. The drinks were on the steepish side for a run of the mill chain restaurant.  The manager came out to placate us when our food was given to another table and we were left waiting. He did a lousy job and sounded more like a used car salesman than a restaurant manager trying to appease new customers.  Our food came out and wasn't all that presentable. My meal (Chicken Marsala) tasted like a Marie Calendar microwavable meal. The other meals all had small issues that were corrected (not enough sauce, no condiments, etc.). The Pazooki was good, but how can a cookie with ice cream be wrong? This is a large restaurant, but the music is EXTREMELY LOUD. It would be a poor idea to go here on an intimate date.  I would try it again, but I hope the service and food improve for me to be a repeat customer."
Paul V.,"Brentwood, CA",170,424,423,3.0,3/7/2012,"A friends suggestion can go a long way. ""You gotta try the Bacon Cheeseburger Pizza!"" And so I did. It was a pretty good pie. BJ's makes all (except for gluten free) of their pizzas deep-dish. That serves me well because their crust is pretty good, moist, have some flavor, and not dry. I have also tried their BJ's Favorite and it was good as well. The breadth of their menu is as vast as lets say Cheesecake Factory but alas, I have only tried their pizzas. Next time I will try something different. Oh, and their pizzas go down well with their Harvest Hef..."
D H.,"Antioch, CA",0,10,,4.0,7/26/2014,"Have a good time every time I go to this place. Never had bad service. People have always been nice. Love Love Love the pizza here. If I've ever run into a problem, management has been swift to take care of it. Good place.  Now.. to all the haters.. if you have been here 5 times, and on the 5th time, one thing went wrong. .that is no reason to give one star. I'm seeing single stars being handed out like candy on Halloween night. WTF? Get it together..."
Rodella F.,"Antioch, CA",45,5,4,1.0,3/27/2015,"I've been to BJ's a few times in hopes their service get better. Unfortunately it has not, in fact it probably has gotten worse. Whether it's lunch or dinner service is slooowwww and horrible. Food is not worth the wait."
Alison P.,"Brentwood, CA",1,15,17,1.0,5/14/2013,"My husband and I tried this place for the first time, this past Saturday night.  We had heard pretty good things about it and were excited to enjoy a nice dining experience......NOT!   We were seated right away but it took over 20 minutes for someone to approach us.  We ordered a lemonade and an iced tea to our waiter that had absolutely ZERO personality (definitely in the wrong line of work).  It took another 15 minutes to get the drinks.  The iced tea came plain (non-sweetened) and there was no sugar or sugar substitutes on the table.  Another 15 minutes and we had to flag down our waiter.  He took our order at that time and we asked him for sweetener.  The sweetener never came and we had to ask again.  It came WITH our dinner and at this point, my husband had already drank the iced tea because he was so thirsty.   Here comes the really bad part.....hubby's pasta dinner was ""luke warm"" with no bread.  My pasta dinner was ""cold"" and with no bread.  Again....no waiter to check on us.  Had to flag him down again.  He apologized and at this point, we had been there about and hour and a half.  Our drinks were obviously gone and he didn't ask us if we wanted a refill. Now the manager comes to our table and apologizes profusely.  He says he is going to make it ""right.""  Another 20 to 30 minutes for the food.  It was hot this time but there was no flavor and the presentation was bland at best. When we got the tab, he ""comped"" my entree but we were so disapointed at this point, we just wanted to leave.  It was noisy and just NOT a good experience.  We will not be back."
Ana-Silvia V.,"Brentwood, CA",6,13,,5.0,4/23/2015,Vicky at take out was awesome! She was super sweet and I really appreciated all her help. She was super nice over the phone and just as nice when she brought us our food! Thanks Vicky for the great service!
Cathleen R.,"Brentwood, CA",112,5,,1.0,4/19/2015,"Booked an after prom/surprise birthday party here for my 17 year old daughter and 20 kids.  10 minutes before the event we dropped balloons, presents and cupcakes there.  Manager assured me they would serve the cupcakes with candles to all the teens.  When my daughter arrived home after the surprises party, I asked her how the cupcakes were.  She never saw them and they were never served to her.  I called to complain and girl who answered phone could not promise they could hold hem for me until morning.  Really? It's 1AM and it was your mistake.  Really tired of the crummy service that has become a BJ's norm!"
Maria G.,"Sunnyvale, CA",0,10,,5.0,4/18/2015,"Been there a few times! Great food and a big selection of beers and other drinks . Stuffed mushrooms are to die for . I haven't eaten anything I didn't like there yet . Service is always friendly and attentive!  Will be back soon , thank you Bjs (:"
Trisha P.,"Brentwood, CA",34,21,8,4.0,5/14/2015,"Excellent food and service!! But it is way to loud in there..  Love the chicken alfredo, strawberry lemonades and pazookies!!  Just wish they could tone down the noise.."
T S.,"Antioch, CA",1,12,1,4.0,5/9/2015,Nice place to hang out with friends. Friendly service. Flat bread pizza is great! I've been here 10 times this year already. Not sure why the place isn't busier.
Patrick S.,"Brentwood, CA",81,14,9,2.0,3/27/2015,"So I love BJ's!  I have over 1,500 rewards points over 3 years.  Today, I go to eat a meal with my wife and notice the quality of the appetizer was sub par and undercooked.  The manager comes by and tells me the factory that they get the food from along with their cooking system would not allow this.  I tell the manager it was undercooked period.  We go back and forth before he tells me he cleared the appetizer from my bill.  Not pleased with the quality or the service!  C'mon BJ's!!"
Cinthya R.,"Lincoln, CA",0,13,5,1.0,11/15/2014,"Had lunch at around noon and they were not busy at all. The waiter was friendly but lacked on sense of urgency. Who likes to wait for their food! When we were ready to go, our waitress was no where to be found and another waitress stopped by to give us the check. Very sassy and unfriendly. Will not come here again!"
Tami L.,"Oakley, CA",45,6,,4.0,4/26/2015,"I think this BJ's may be improving. I am here to say I love the menus and all the choices. The restaurant is very cute and clean. I have had both bad and good experiences there... About a month ago our party had a terrible experience. They ended up comping our entire bill. I still felt more should be done. We were there to celebrate my friends birthday who was here from out of state. The whole experience was ruined as was her special dinner. So I did send a complaint email to corporate. I must say within minutes I received a phone call from Kyle (regional manager) who was so pleasant to speak with. He listened to my whole adventure and we talked about a lot of things that needed improvement. He in turn phoned my friend ( the birthday girl) apologized and invited our in tire group back at another date to retry their restaurant on them! Tonight we went there . We were greeted by Melissa (general manager) who watched over our entire table. She was pleasant and caring. All of the servers that helped us were on top of their game tonight. We had a awesome dinner and experience. I wish Kyle and his BJ's crew the best of luck at turning this restaurant around. It truly is a nice place with a pleasant atmosphere and I would hate to see it close because of mismanagement.  Kyle shared with me that he recently relocated  here so I really thank you for the invite. I was really impressed with the food and the service. Our entire party was Happy and thankful for the second chance. I will be back so keep up the good work... It really showed tonight that you have made some serious changes. P.S..... I do think that you do need to figure out why your water tastes like mold...i'm sorry, but it really did..."
Jennifer L.,"Martinez, CA",146,41,27,5.0,1/21/2015,"Im sitting here eating right now and I have to do a review because my food is so delicious! !!!

bob b.,"Discovery Bay, CA",1,12,87,5.0,1/18/2014,Good food Good service Just don't be in a hurry when you come here Deserts are great  Great place to come watch games
Espresso C.,"Antioch, CA",3,112,23,4.0,12/5/2014,"We went there last Sunday night.  It was pretty empty and yet we had to wait for a table because the hostess wasn't in the front of house.  When she did finally saunter up to us, smacking her gum btw, she was very lackadaisical in her attitude, kinda strange. But other than this, we really enjoyed our food and service.  I had the guy big bite burger with the pretzel bun, delicious.  My husband had the ahi tuna burger, which he said was delicious. My daughter had the veggie pesto pasta, which was very good.  And lastly my son had the chicken tenders which were good.  We also really enjoyed the artichoke heart appetizer, but you must order a side of the garlic dip, so yummy!  Lastly we had desert which was the mint pie and the snickers pie, they were also very good.  So overall we had a pretty good dinner.  Kinda pricey, but I would go again."
Denisse B.,"Antioch, CA",1,18,10,4.0,2/24/2014,"Beast desserts ever baked  hot cookie with ice cream on top mmmmm.. Melts In your mouth, beers are so smooth you can drink them like water, this restaurant never disappoints me their open late great customer service"
Likwid C.,"Manteca, CA",54,17,19,3.0,12/30/2013,"Had the balsamic chicken today (my go to) the chicken was a tad on dry side.. I make this same recipe at home using organic chicken thighs as opposed to the breast that they use. Overall I would get it again, but today's was dry."
Kathy D.,"Rio Vista, CA",0,8,,1.0,5/21/2014,"We eat at this location on an average of 2 times a month. Always have had excellent service until yesterday. The server, who was a young lady,was terrible ,rude and was too busy visiting with another  male customer that was at the bar she forgot our drinks. Literally ran by our table and quickly too our order and yes didn't listen to us and our food came out wrong.  We weren't the only table with this problem she gave the table next to us the wrong bill. Clearly she was enjoying her visit we the  male customer at the bar, not working or servicing her customers.  We love the restaurant and most of all the Berry Burst Cider but  we will not be returning due to the poor service . Black Angus is right next door we will choose that restaurant  over BJ's going forward."
