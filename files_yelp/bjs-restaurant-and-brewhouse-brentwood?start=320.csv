Jim G.,"Union Square, San Francisco, CA",9,12,,1.0,2/16/2015,What the heck is up with this place?  Food took 45 minutes to get here. Had to send back my daughter's because the sliders were burnt. Then took another 45 to get them back. Waitstaff looked clueless and needed help getting thru order process. She was like a little engine that couldn't. Sorry won't be back
leah l.,"Oakley, CA",0,6,,4.0,3/10/2016,The food is always so yummy and the drinks are delicious! Great customer service and convenient take out
Jeannine C.,"Pioneer, CA",792,83,303,2.0,1/5/2013,"When I spend money, I'm voting for a business to succeed or fail; therefore, I will not be back until your manager is replaced....BJ's if you fail I won't be surprised.  It will be either s-harrassment or upset customers.... First, your manager is too young, to unprofessional, and shouldn't flirt with the girl behind the bar.  Second, managers should be helping your staff and helping customers like me.   When I had my waitress ask if I could take photos for my assignment and you said yes then when you saw my big camera changed your mind...why didn't you come to my table the first time when I asked for you?  David, you're a terrible manager when your staff tells me that it's typical for you to be off trying to bed the young new bartender.  Really?  We will not come in again for the Wedge Salad, the bar, and to meet up with friends.  We will meet our friends at a business we want to succeed.  It's sad that a manager could ruin what BJ's has worked so hard for.  I look forward to hearing David is gone.  Then I will visit again and see if I can change my review.   I've always said a business represents what the management is lacking.  This is a prime example of a hard working wait staff carrying a manager.  A manager should be a person that is mature and customer focused, customers should never see a manager flirting instead of greeting them.  Sorry!"
Devin W.,"San Francisco, CA",212,4,,2.0,2/2/2016,"OK well I normally wouldnt write a review about bad service, and usually the people who say that are the ones who always do.  However I mean it, being a service industry worker myself I never have anything bad to say about my fellow brothers and sisters. UNTIL there is a really bad, unnecessary experience in my evening out.  Now the fact that there a few pet peeves from all of us servers amoungst other servers while critiquing the big mess ups that can easily be avodied. With that said,  our server (yes I'll say his name) Anthony was all but great, I wondered thr entire time if I or one of my friends offended him at all before I arrived 10 minutes after they arrived. Of course they didnt. I'll keep this part short but basically we were ignored, we had to flag him down for everything, everytime something was delivered he preceded to run away from the table without asking the rest of us if we needed anything, I couldn't believe he did this more than once, the resturant was not at all busy. ANOTHNY never checked on us after we got our meal, never offered refills on drinks...my friends diet Pepsi was empty for almost 20 minutes before she had to flag down the server. I myself had a glass of wine which I also not offered another glass on this half off wine tuesday, in fact I still had food in front of myself when the server dropped of the check. How rude. YOU NEVER DROP THE CHECK WHEN THERE IS SOME ONE STILL EATING. HOW RUDE, I asked for cracked pepper on my salad which he completey ignored, I then pretended to add more table pepper to my salad to see if he remembered.  It doesn't take it to be another server to realize  how god awful and careless this dude was. Made me sad. But we still tipped him at least 10 percent even though he did not deserve a penny. Really hurt how someone could be so rude. I would have spoken to a manager but I hate being that person so thanks yelp. I gave this review two stars because thr food was great as always at this location.  Thanks."
Tammy L.,"Salisbury, NC",0,60,23,2.0,7/13/2014,"Only good thing is the pizza cookie, everything else is the same old boring crap you can get everywhere else, nothing special or memorable. It's always very loud, service is below par. We've only been 3 times cause we don't usually eat at chain places but even that was 3 times too many. I cringe now when someone mentions going here,  other than the pizza cookie I see no reason why anyone should step foot in the place. Please go back to where you came from."
Adelisa L.,"Danville, CA",333,42,85,5.0,10/19/2013,"I'm really glad I stopped by this BJ's. Our waitress was great, she was helpful when we were trying to figure out which pizza to order. I ordered the spinach and artichoke deep dish pizza (vegetarian) it was pretty good. At the end of course my friend and I ordered a pizookie which was so amazing. The dessert here is always the highlight of my entire meal."
Angelina O.,"Antioch, CA",158,119,84,2.0,7/3/2014,"came here today for lunch with a few friends.  Worst service ever! The waiter paid no attention to us, did not pick up any dishes, didn't even ask if anyone wanted refills. I actually had to call over the manager to clear off our table.the manager did take off $10  for the bad service. Normally service is good here but not today."
Brian O.,"Brentwood, CA",5,30,51,5.0,7/29/2013,Excellent bar service.  Currently being waited on by Ricka and Shawn. Great beer selection. They both took care of my friends and I. We never had an empty glass.
Steven C.,"Discovery Bay, CA",0,60,3,4.0,12/15/2014,"I remember how slow service was when this location first opened. Service is vastly improved & staff are polite and attentive. The burgers & brew are well crafted. I, however, had some pretty awful pizza & haven't been willing to try again. This is a great place to try a variety of ales!"
Deborah B.,"Brentwood, CA",0,21,,4.0,10/15/2014,"I want to update my previous review to increase stars to 4 since they finally lowered the music volume so people can hear themselves.  I really like the food at BJ's, especially the lemon thyme chicken which is a delicious, low-cal meal, and also they're appetizers and burgers are great."
Staci M.,"Sacramento, CA",6,41,23,2.0,9/29/2013,Normally I love BJs and I've been to quite a few. Came to Brentwood to visit family and we decided to have dinner here. The service was alright. We had to wait for silver wear for 15 mins after our appetizers had arrived and waited 45 mins after that to order. Our waiter told us they were out of cups in the back and they were working on getting more silver wear for us. Food was horrible!!! No one was pleased with the food and one of my family members got the wrong food. Everyone had finished before they even got their calzone.  Not going back to this location..ever!
Amber G.,"Concord, CA",107,132,136,3.0,4/3/2013,"Just a tip: Alicia is the best waitress there. If you ask to get seated in her section and there's any problems, she'll more than make it up for you. I'd gotten her a few times last year and saw her again last night and she's still super accommodating.  One more tip: The BEST time to eat here is when they're doing they're two for $20 deal. I like their FB page so I could see when it's going on. You and another person both get soup or salad, a medium pizza, and a pizookie for the price of just the pizza itself. That's the best time to try this place out and basically the only time I come. Oh, ok, one more tip: You can customize your selections... a lot. If you're torn between two pizzas, you can order half of one and half of the other. If you get a nice waitress, they will often let you switch out one of their gourmet sodas so you can try multiple ones for the same price. You can even do half a pizookie of one flavor and half of another, change the ice cream, and apparently even add hot fudge underneath for no charge.  The service is really hit and miss, but the food is pretty good. Unfortunately, they don't have my favorite pizza anymore (the Balsamic Portabello Pizza... omg), but they still have a few good things to get.  Tried the chicken bacon ranch yesterday and I really liked it - my husband and I both don't get a lot of ranch anything, but it was really well balanced. The Mediterranean pizza is good if you like those flavors. The buffalo chicken can be really good or just meh depending on how much sauce they put on. You can ask for light or heavy sauce and they will comply. I actually love the Cheeseburger pizza which is weird, because I was so resistant to try it. I get it with no pickles. The only pizzas I don't like are their more traditional fare - you can get a better meat and combination pizza somewhere else, for sure.  The specialty pizzas are the way to go. BUT, some days they are better than others. This place has a lot of inconsistencies in cooks. Tried the new raspberry nut pizookie - yum! I love the red velvet and the chocolate pizookie, and this now goes in my top three. Weirdly tastes a bit like raspberry muffins, but in a good way.  If you like broccoli cheddar soup, I think they have the best in town. Go Sunday-Tuesday and try it. SO good. That's my favorite thing on the menu. The apps are a bit expensive for the portions (although I love the avacado egg rolls, I never get them), but the small bites are really good money-savers. You can get a pretty big, yummy bowl of fancy mac and cheese for a few bucks. If you're on the cheap, it's not a bad bet.  I would suggest not ordering a drink here since their portions are small and my friends that have ordered drinks have had a lot of complaints."
Lisa E.,"Brentwood, CA",2,5,,1.0,2/6/2015,"VENTING!!!! Just returned from BJs and was disappointed. Every week we go and I order a California Burger but with Bison meat. So, when my burger came it was not Bison. I told the waiter, Chris, who was very nice. The patty was not only larger than usual but did not taste like Bison. The manager said it was Bison per the cook. This is something your customer orders all the time. AND I paid extra. So CYA? Too bad, very disappointed!!! I called the manager after we left - he said the cook said it was Bison. NOT!!!! UPDATE:  I WAS SURPRISED THERE WAS AN EMAIL THIS MORNING SENT OUT LAST NIGHT- This morning checking my emails, I did receive a note *** Ms. Ellingso, there is never anexcuse for poor food quality.  I assure you that we will work with our team to make sure we are creating the best experience possible, Sincerely, Marco Vazquez, with a Courtesy Card attached for $25.   At least they responded."
Victoria A.,"East Bay, CA",129,49,7,1.0,9/27/2014,HORRIBLE! By far the worst service ever!!! The waiter even admitted that the restaurant in fact over-price everything... From food to drinks! Stay away!!
Alexis G.,"Rocklin, CA",115,213,395,5.0,7/5/2013,"The food at BJ's is always awesome, from their appetizers, pizza, and pizookies.  The service is always very friendly and fast which is always great to say! They are a little expensive but the food is really good and worth it. Very busy on  Friday's and Weekends all day so make sure to call ahead for a table.  Keep it up BJ's!"
Natalie C.,"Oakley, CA",0,1,,2.0,3/20/2015,"I go to the BJs on Sand Creek at least once a week. And tonight I have had the worst service ever. Our waitress was so bad she inspired me to make a Yelp just to write a review about her. We waited more than 10 minutes before she even came over to ask for drinks and by that time we were already ready to order. Once we get our food we don't see her again until we are almost done. Our drinks sat empty most of the night. Then she brings the check and walks away it was another 15 minutes before she even walked past us again then I needed her to split the check which she took forever doing.. Definitely not a good experience. Ashley R, was not a good waitress she was talking most of the time and not checking her tables. Probably not going to go back there for awhile.."
Brandon P.,"Brentwood, CA",42,53,1,5.0,8/17/2013,"I don't normally review chains because let's face it -- corporate doesn't give a s..t.  I will, however, say that Sherry behind the bar is the absolute best."
Laura B.,"Oceanside, CA",0,9,,5.0,9/9/2014,"I came to BJS Brentwood for dinner a while back w/ a group of friends, there were 8 of us total. Our server Irene was awesome! She was very attentive to our entire table and was super friendly. BJS by far has to be one of my favorite restaurants of all time. A diverse menu gives you plenty of options to choose from, and you can't leave without having a pizookie first!!"
Nga P.,"Alameda, CA",237,327,743,1.0,11/5/2012,"Dont get me started. This is by far the worse bjs i have ever been too. The waitress took 20 minutes to come back to our table. The manager saw that we were waiting so he stepped in and took care of us. When we got our first appetizer our waitress came back and asked if we were ready to order. We looked at her, and said we already order. -_- we got jipped on our calamari. Normally at other locations we get a whole plate where we cant finish. we order our pizookie, and the waitress didnt even bother to ask what kind. good thing my bf and I werent allergic to anything, otherwise we would have complained about getting a chocolate chip one instead of our favorite. never coming back again!"
Lukey D.,"Oakley, CA",7,74,84,2.0,8/14/2012,"Each time I have been to BJ's regardless of the location, I have always been consistently pleased. Well, should I say until they built the Brentwood location in my neck of the woods. The place is always hopping and there is always a wait. Their call-ahead service makes that more tolerable though. Their food is all very tasty and tastes consistent from location to location. I can say the same for their libations as well. What is lacking in this location is the service. On the fourvisits I have made there, they have done the following: Visit #1: Forgot one of the entrees. (no, I really didn't need to eat. I just came to stare at others hungrily whilst they dined). My dish came after everyone else at the table finished and they in turn had to sit there and watch me eat. Visit #2: (it's the avocado issue again) The item I wanted clearly came with avocado. So I told the perfectly communicating server that I was allergic to avocado but that I wanted the dish with no avocado. She said no problem. The dish came with avocado, I sent it back to be redone. It came back a little too quickly. I come to find that they simply took it off and there was still a green smear on the food where it once was. Visit #3: Told the server upon arrival that it was my Brother's birthday, so that they would do their birthday thing and give him a birthday pazookie. She agreed. That never happened, no apology, nada. Visit #4: We ordered an appetizer and two entrees. The entrees came out quite quickly and we thought they had just beat the appetizer. Waited, waited, no appetizer. When we questioned the server she stated that she would have it removed from the bill and that it appeared we had enough to eat on the table presently. No complaints about the food, drinks or anything else. Nor about any other location except this one. The servers in this location have been consistently bad. The tasty dishes and experiences at other locations are why they get two stars and not the minimum to write. Four times is enough, I honestly won't go back to this location again."
