kati m.,"Oakley, CA",8,62,,2.0,1/6/2014,"My husband and my in-laws have visited this location 3 times and all visits have included good food, but extremely slow service. Every time we have dined here, we have had to check on the status of our food, or speak to a manager. The ""manager"" we spoke to on visit 2 never even apologized. We gave it 3 shots and my husband and I will not return.  If you are not in a hurry - the food is pretty good."
Mike W.,"Sacramento, CA",2,29,2,1.0,8/16/2012,"SLOW SLOW SLOW So slow we left. On the way out we told them it took too long, they said, meh, see ya later! BOO"
Marie A.,"Antioch, CA",0,15,4,4.0,3/1/2015,I love this chain restaurant! Your basic foods what's not to love! The waiter tonight was great and has a great sense of humor. Always come here every couple months for some drinks. Love the strawberry mojito!
Sean W.,"Antioch, CA",6,8,3,3.0,12/20/2013,BJ's is beautiful on the outside.  Great building and great spot.  I picked up some gift cards and they were having a great 2 for $35 special with a pazookie.   I ordered the wedge salad and the rib eye. Wedge salad was OK. (For those that enjoy Outback Steakhouse's wedge salad- Outback's is better.  I think it's the Balsamic Glaze they put on top that makes the difference.  The rib-eye was not very good.  I always eat my steaks medium rare and this cut had some rubbery fat and wasn't very tender. The Pazookie is always tasty.  It's a slightly undercooked cookie (just the way my wife loves cookies) and some ice cream melting on top.  Delicious. I also enjoyed the draft Root Beer.  For those that enjoy a good Draft Root Beer this was very tasty and had endless refills. Overall it was an OK experience with great Root Beer and dessert and an OK meal.
Jennifer B.,"Brentwood, CA",0,14,,1.0,6/16/2014,"We ate here 6/14/14 and had terrible service, as usual. The food is good but it is the poor service that brings this place down. We waited 45 minutes just to get some water once we were seated. Two of us were served our entrees 10 minutes before the rest of the table got their food. It was ridiculous. We were ignored the whole time and we waited forever just to pay. On another visit, we had raw bacon in our pizookie. Disgusting. I heard 2 other tables near us ask to speak to management. Complaints fall on deaf ears because the managers just do not care."
Logan G.,"Vacaville, CA",12,2,,4.0,12/4/2013,"As a regular to the restaurant there are some amazing staff members on board working to bring this establishment to its full potential.  From personal experience I receive much better service on the main floor. I have found that many of the cocktails servers provide service levels on expected tips they weed customers out based on appearance.  Katelynn, Mario and Melissa have all worked to go above and beyond the call of duty to meet their company values and I expect them to bring this mentality to the rest of their team as time goes on. Keep it up."
Tom M.,"Byron, CA",12,5,,2.0,7/8/2014,I keep asking myself why do I keep coming back here.  I do like the food and they have a great draft beer selection.  That's why I give them any stars.  I have been here no less than a dozen times and only once have they gotten orders correct.  A number of times they have just completely forgotten to deliver food.  Exactly what happened today.  Meal showed up before the soup.  Had to ask twice to get it.  What is wrong with their system that they cannot get thing right?
Birdie F.,"Brentwood, CA",0,39,14,5.0,8/16/2015,"Clean, quick and friendly service as always. Even when they are slammed, they are prompt to serve tasty food and drink!"
Marie G.,"Concord, CA",37,9,3,2.0,2/6/2015,I was surprised that there wasn't a wait at 8pm on a Friday. I see why now.  The salad was tiny and my side of broccoli consisted of 5 little pieces. I wanted to come here since it's been awhile but I definitely won't be coming back unless its to the bar...
C G.,"Antioch, CA",2,124,60,3.0,12/14/2012,Tasty chicken bacon flatbread pizza.  But kinda pricey overall.
Melissa F.,"Daly City, CA",76,27,7,5.0,10/3/2015,"Megan L. was of great service she was very attentive, never missed a request and was fast with serving tables not just to us but to everyone else as well. My boyfriend and i had a wonderful first experience to the area since we just moved out here. Thank you Megan L!"
Kitty D.,"Alamo, CA",64,756,913,4.0,3/5/2013,BJ is a nice place for happy hour as they can reserve tables for you during the happy hour!  We were able to get some patio seats and it was wonderful. Good happy hour prices and menu selections!
Laura B.,"Danville, CA",565,90,2,4.0,9/8/2012,"Sit in the bar! Great happy hour and much better service there! The seating below, well, if you like being ignored, or want to have a LONG date, then it's cool. I will say, honestly, the cooks rarely get my order right, but the servers are more than willing to fix it.  The last time they REALLY went over and above to make things right with me since I'm a ""regular"" so I'll give them bonus points there. The Ahi Poke tastes fishy, don't get it, especially with the added onion... uuugh! Their happy hour pizzas are REALLY bad for a diet and have toppings galore! The Nachos, well, 1700 calories of yummy deliciousness. They will do basically anything you ask, you just have to ask, and they have a decent happy hour menu (M-F 3-7pm) and lot's of drinks to cool off with. It's a fun place to hang out with friends, have some drinks and watch the games."
Jorge R.,"Concord, CA",68,18,2,2.0,6/1/2014,"Unfortunately this Bj's quality food and just plain service has gone down, the waitress rushes you into ordering then dissappears for a while, the calamari order you can tell it was frozen before cooked due to the excessive soggyness, the jambalaya sauce you can also tell it was frozen microwaved because i found few pieces hard and cold.... Just not a good experience anymore as it was before and also extremely loud!!!   I will keep on just going back to the Concord one which the service and food is better....  Sorry you lost an almost 2 yr customer which went from enjoying to not."
Kalifornia K.,"San Francisco, CA",0,21,5,1.0,7/29/2012,Ordered a California Burger and received a Classic Burger. I was damn sure to make sure they got the billing correct. Wish they shut down the restaurant and just served beer and popcorn. A bank of microwaves so we can do it ourselves'.  .
JP C.,"Discovery Bay, CA",6,126,112,1.0,8/3/2012,"Don't waste your with the long waiting list!  The food is horrible... I have tried/ate at lease 6 pasta plates thinking I will find one thing that taste good there and it all sucks!  We finally went there for just the pizza and that was even worse!  Their beers that they brew is horrible! I must have sent back 3 beers until I finally a standard draft beer that you can not go wrong with.  Not to mention you will spend an arm and a leg just to wait to be seated, then have either a really really nice waiter/ress or a really really crappy one, then eat really bad food.  I seem to amaze me how many people keep going back because I am not the only one! Look at the reviews if you do not believe me!  STAY AWAY! If you want italian, go to MELO'S!!! Great Pasta's and even way better pizza's!"
Tiffany M.,"Las Vegas, NV",181,47,,1.0,5/11/2014,"The customer service was terrible. The food was cold, wrong, burnt, and took over an hour to reach the table. After complaining to management , the service got worse. Then to top it all off we paid with 2 separate cards and ONE card was charged 4 times. I LOVE bjs but unfortunately I will not be going to this location again."
Jacob K.,"Antioch, CA",15,18,12,1.0,9/8/2012,"Awful. Gave this place at least 3 tries. Worse every time. - Under-cooked pizza. How did they do that? - Incorrect orders with no acknowledgement, apology, comp, etc. - Extremely overpriced for what you get. We told our waiter we weren't happy with our meal. He told us to ""maybe order something else next time"".. One star for beer. Don't touch the food."
Michael K.,"Livermore, CA",0,11,2,4.0,12/26/2014,I ate here for happy hour with some family of mine. We decided to sit by the bar and I found the service to be very fast and friendly. The flat bread is delicious as well as the chicken winges and they did not mess up on our order. The flat bread was almost like a miniature pizza and it only costed $4 dollars during happy hour. The wings were also very well-done. I had my wings breaded and it provided that extra crisp which I find satisfying. The sauce it came with was ranch and this sweet and sour sauch which complemented the winges perfect. I have yet to try any of the entrees put look forward to trying them the next time I can come back.
Erin M.,"Berkeley, CA",0,6,,4.0,10/28/2015,"I remember first coming here when it opened and it was NOT good. Came back for the first time in a long time and everything wasuch better! Calamari was tender, the pumpkin pizookie was to DIE for. And the lemon pepper chicken was AMAZING. DEF COMING BACK SOON"
