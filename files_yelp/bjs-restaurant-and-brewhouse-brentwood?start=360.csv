Grace L.,"San Diego, CA",1143,621,560,4.0,2/21/2012,"I hate to admit. This has comfortably become my back up weekend spot. If a friend calls and wants to do something, the options in Brentwood are quite limited. So I always throw BJs out there hoping my friend would agree. And thus far, there hasn't been one friend that hasn't turned down BJs (har har). I've grown quite fond of their bar area that's well stocked with brews and the nice, courteous staff. Even the patrons are pretty nice, tipping their head as to allow the little lady to order before them. So kind.  As far as food, get the chicken lettuce wraps if you feel like being good. The sliders if you're feeling bad. And the red velvet pizookie if you're feeling down right devilish."
Yvette M.,"East Bay, CA",11,102,341,4.0,7/13/2014,Came here with a few of my girlie friends for appetizers and writing this review after two visits during weekday lunch time.  Service has always been very good.  We usually order a few appetizers and share. Crispy calamari ($10.50) are just that! Nice and crispy that is just right.  Ahi poke ($l0.50) is a nicely diced with avocados about the same size and the crispy wonton chips aren't just wonton - they have an undescribable luscious flavor with a crunch that is so right. Crispy fried artichoke ($4.75) had a nice fry and not greasy.  Corn fritters with bacon aioli ($3.25) were one of my friend's favorites.  We never felt rushed and I wish I could remember our servers name because he was very nice and frequently checked on us without making us feel like we were not welcome.
Lois G.,"Oakley, CA",0,28,,5.0,9/10/2015,"I rarely give a corporate chain five stars, but the BJs on Sand Creek deserves a higher rating than it seems to have here on Yelp.  This is one of our go-to spots for lunch or dinner and it's one of the few places for late-night take-out.  Have a pizookie next time the munchies hit and you'll see what I mean!The food is always good, with a huge selection so everyone is happy. The barbacoa chicken is a favorite.  Personally, I like their burgers, especially the jalapeño/avocado.  They always cook them perfectly to my specs -- which I don't get at Habit, Five Guys or Chilis.  And the fried jalapeños on top are killer.  The drinks, alcoholic or not, are great.  We've always found the servers to be very personable and the atmosphere is positive and friendly.  If they're crowded, there may be a wait for food, but we're sports fanatics, so there's usually something to watch on the big screens.  The bar is hopping most nights.  Get yourself a BJs Diner Card and you get specials online.  I hope others who have positive things to say will add their reviews -- this spot is better than most and its rating should be higher!"
Karleen G.,"San Francisco, CA",5,26,7,5.0,3/12/2013,"Sherry at the bar is AWESOME.  She is outgoing, proficient, and just awesome. She definitely makes the bar experience very pleasant. Visit Sherry...you'll lover her! Oh, and the Avocado Egg Rolls are the best!"
Stacey M.,"Temecula, CA",0,110,10,5.0,10/9/2015,Excellent food! Service is great. I can't figure out why they have a low star rating.
S T.,"San Leandro, CA",2,164,9,2.0,4/20/2014,"I was really disappointed with our experience at the Brentwood BJs. We came here for Easter Brunch as we wanted to try a new place for Brunch. We checked out the menu online and although it wasn't full of options, it was good enough to try.  We came shorty after 10am which was nice since it was still very slow. We sat in the open bar seating in a booth and ordered mimosas (which weren't that great even though the appearance was nice). Our food was brought out fairly quickly, but we didn't have any ketchup, butter, jams or anything for our breakfast entrees. We kept trying to get someone's attention and after 5-10 min our waitress (who I think was our waitress) came by so we could ask. It took another 5 min or so for someone in the back to bring us those things and by then our meal was cold. No one ever came back to check on us and we weren't offered another drink or refills until after we asked for our check to leave.  The workers were all huddled at the bar the whole time. Looked like they were arguing about something but either way, we felt the overall service was horrible. I was really disappointed since I never have a bad experience or meal at BJs. I know it sucks to work on a holiday, but doesn't seem like the service is better any other day based on reviews."
Marisa A.,"Brentwood, CA",115,9,7,1.0,2/29/2012,"My family & I have eaten here twice to celebrate birthdays & have been very disappointed.  The first time we went the server seemed new; very nervous, forgot/messed up our order, & food took too long to get served. We waited over 40 mins & my mother-in-law was so upset that we cancelled our dessert order because it took too long. Yesterday we had dinner, our server was much better, but we had another over 40 minute wait. They were obviously not that busy being that it was a Tuesday night, as only a third of the tables were used. But really I don't mind waiting if the food is really great. It wasn't. It was ok. They admitted to the birthday celebrate that she was the third person who asked for ribs that night & they had none.  My husband asked for his steak well-done with no pink; surface looked burnt & a big corner was pink. I ordered the Maui pork chop, it was ok. I expected it to taste Hawaiian, just seemed like something I could cook at home. I finished my plate, nonetheless, because I was starving from a long day at work & a longer waiting at BJs. I know why they serve alcohol here, it's so you can be tipsy enough to mind the long waiting, mediocre service, & disappointing food. I would rather save my money & my gas money & eat at home."
Theresa F.,"Anaheim, CA",28,64,9,3.0,6/3/2012,"I think the excitement and buzz over the brand new restaurant in town as now subsided. That also means that the staff at BJ's' should have their best practices conquered by now. I think as with any large chain restaurant your experience is largely dependent on your server, the kitchen staff and how busy it is or is not when you opt to dine there.  We are not strangers to BJ's as they are all over Southern California. We have gone to breakfast, lunch and dinner numerous times since they have opened.   We have only had two really bad experiences and in both cases, the on-staff manager was able to quickly resolve the issues. On one occasion after he took quick action to resolve our problem (dead fly wrapped in a  cob web in the napkin with the new silverware), it appeared he would have to spend more time adjusting the attitude of our server. On another occasion, though our server was still fairly new, it was very quite obvious that my fiancee and I would receive our food but it was going to be a loooong process and wait. When the food did come out, only my fiancee's came but not mine. About 10 minutes later mine came out and the restaurant removed it from our bill. My two long standing complaints with this restaurant and staff is this: 1.  I am not sure why it's a battle to have bread brought out with a meal upon request. Charge me for it. I don't care just do not cop an attitude. 2.  When I order the Spaghetti with spicy tomato sauce, why is the sauce never consistent? If I am ordering the dish, I need the sauce too. That means more than 3 tablespoons should be a requirement for this dish. Every single time, this is a battle to get this right. By the way, marinara sauce is NOT spicy tomato sauce. Again, I do believe it's all dependent who the server is, kitchen staff and how busy but remember we are the paying customer. That means you do not have to agree with us but you need to work with us to ensure our satisfaction."
Amanda F.,"Brentwood, CA",168,25,2,1.0,2/23/2014,"definitely did not have a good experience there. We had a wait for our table which was totally understandable because it was Sat. But the waitress that helped us acted like she could barely be bothered with us, Was not friendly at all. She came to fill up my friends water glass but left the other two almost empty and barely even came to check on us. When we asked for our check she simply said ""yup"" not even asking if there was anything else wed like etc. The food took forever and a day to get there even though we ordered very simple stuff. needless to say I will not be going back there to eat again. I can name 10 other restaurants that get just as busy and have excellent service and friendly staff."
Tim W.,"Brentwood, CA",1,14,3,4.0,3/10/2014,"Great beer and the Jambalaya is fantastic. It is a little spicy, so don't order if you can't take it. The Jeremiah Red is really nice if you like hoppy beer."
Eric B.,"Antioch, CA",0,6,,1.0,11/15/2014,"I have been to a few other locations and had always thought bjs was worth the price... until this location. long wait, but thats no big deal it was a friday night. got a beer at the bar (a 7 dollar beer) and waited.  was seated and ordered drinks, appetizers, and our food. the waitress smelled funny and was rude. one of us recieved their appetizer quickly while two of us waited an additional 15 minutes for ours. about 5 minutes after I recieved my appetizer I was greated with my entree, while I had just started my appetizer. at this point three out of four of us have our food. we begin to eat while one of us was waiting on his dish. the ranch was watered down, despite the tiny serving. 10 minutes later the 4th plate arrived at the table. we ate paid and left.  if you want overpriced beer and bad service this is the place for you!"
Cindy W.,"Brentwood, CA",0,3,,4.0,11/1/2015,I like the half off wine night on Tuesdays.  The happy hour appetizers are reasonable and delicious.
Vera M.,"Oakley, CA",0,1,,1.0,10/30/2015,"Just left BJ'S after using their preferred waitlist app. What a horrible experience! I put our names in at 7:15pm and the app said we had a 45 minute wait. We arrived at 8:00pm only to be told that our names were not in their system (not the first time this has happened ) and that I had another 30 minute wait. The hostess said that the app ""never works"".  Isn't the whole point of using the preferred waitlist to avoid long wait times??  I won't  do this again. The evening manager pretty much said the same thing so I am giving one star only because I can't do zero."
Sandy K.,"Boulder Creek, CA",51,2,1,1.0,8/28/2014,I got an order to go which was a Ceasr salad with chicken and and a stuffed mushrooms appetizer.  They spent more money on the plastic container that the salad was served in than the actual salad...maybe a cup of lettuce and 1/4 of a chicken breast with almost no paremsan cheese  Not worth it at all.  The stuffed mushrooms were really good. Overall a C-
Jeff P.,"San Francisco, CA",40,10,,1.0,10/26/2011,"Terrible service, which is unfortunate because the food is good. It's a little too loud as well. Manager even comped our food due to the poor service....they just need to get their staff situation settled"
Andrea S.,"Bend, OR",125,15,,1.0,4/9/2012,"Overall: Friends and I have given BJs another several shots. Having visited five times since my initial review, the verdict is in: BJs is a just another mass-produced culinary disappointment with a penchant for exploiting poor customer service and average corporate food. Customer Service: With the exception of one visit we made to the bar, in which our playful bartender gladly allowed us to re-name him to suite our sensibilities, each visit resulted in the return of lukewarm food, and a server who was either too busy to check on us or too green to answer questions or provide adequate service. Since my great fall on the freshly waxed floor (a Three Stooges moment that resulted in purse contents scattering and feet leaving the floor), I've spoken with the managers and staff about how staff walked over me without a second glance as I lay there. The response? ""Did you ask for help?"" My bad! I wasn't updated on accident protocol at BJs. Note to self: if ever visiting BJs again, bring Life Alert necklace in the event of another fall; that or a microphone and portable amp for announcement to staff to stop on by on their way through. Food: Got salt? The food is fair at best. Think Chilis with more seafood options. At these prices, I'd prefer to visit a local joint that's privately owned where I'm going to get real food rather than the seemingly microwave heated options with pre-packaged sauces offered here.  Beer: Still a good beer menu no matter how you slice it. My recommendation for those with a beer hankering is to sit in the bar area where the better servers seem to work. You'll probably get a better deal at Bev Mo for a lot of these, but let's face it, you don't always want to stay home. While it may not be enough of a reason for me to patronize BJs, beer lovers are not likely to be disappointed by the hoppy options available."
Stephanie S.,"Brentwood, CA",456,251,279,4.0,9/27/2011,"Let's start off by stating the obvious... BJ's is a chain restaurant. Being that it's a chain, one would assume all the negatives a typical chain restaurant would bring. Come on now, we all know what they say about assuming things. It makes an ass out of you, and you can leave me out of it. That being said, forget your assumptions. Although this particular BJ's is new (opened Sept. 26, 2011), this was not my 1st time at  a BJ's. I have frequented several locations (Concord, Elk Grove, San Mateo and now Brentwood) numerous times. If you are looking for a ""stand out"" meal, you aren't gonna find it here, but BJ's has NEVER disappointed and has always consistently been good. September 27, 2011 (one day after the Sept. 26 grand opening) Arrived with party of 4 at aprox 6pm. Busy. 20+ minute wait. Seated at a booth. Drink and appetizer order was immediately taken. Drinks arrived quickly. Appetizer was brought out within 10-15mins.  What we ordered: -Best Beginnings Appetizer Combo (Spinach & Artichoke Dip, Mozzarella Sticks, Avocado Egg Rolls and Santa Fe Spring Rolls)  *btw... my favorite is the Avocado Egg Rolls -Parmesan Crusted Chicken -Classic Burger with fries -Deep Dish Pizza -Soup (minestrone) and Salad (wedge)  *the soup and salad combo was my choice of the evening. REALLY wanted to order a burger, but I'm trying to make healthier choices blah, blah, blah... Great place to meet friends for drinks or dinner. Accommodates large parties. Kid friendly."
Lee L.,"Brentwood, CA",13,113,3,4.0,3/6/2014,"I hadn't been to BJ's in a while. Last night made me wonder why.. I had the Atlantic Salmon. It was delicious, but smaller then I expected. Service was good, pleasant and accommodating. I love the fact we could be seated within 10 minutes of arrival, although it was in the middle of the peak hours. Over all it was a great experience, again."
Jennifer M.,"Antioch, CA",391,156,,2.0,12/3/2011,"I went there a couple weeks ago and I was a bit disappointed by the lack of customer service they had there.  I went with my mother to enjoy some drinks and some good food because I've been to the one in Newark, CA  before and had such a great time so I was introducing my mom to this restaurant. We arrived there and were seated rather quickly in their outside area since it was such lovely weather that night. They gave us our menus and no joke we had to wait about 20 minutes just for someone to take our orders.  It took about 15 minutes just to get our drinks since we ordered some alcoholic beverages. I do recommend the Cherry Throwback Cola. It was superb! However, it took about 30 minutes to get our food and it wasn't even busy that night. At first they came out with the wrong order and kept bringing us dishes that weren't ours.  Finally, after much waiting and my mother cussing, we got the right food. The food was okay, I've had better. It took just as long to get our check and by the time we left, we were just frustrated. I understand that this is a new location and maybe the staff didn't get enough training but at this point, I'll just wait until all the employees get more experience for me to step foot in there again."
Valerie C.,"San Francisco, CA",213,137,43,2.0,1/3/2012,"Bar service: Four stars. Table service: ZERO! (More on that later.) Average stars earned: Two stars. First the good: Because of an hour+ wait for a table I decided to hit up the bar for a beer so as to make the waiting and subsequent small talk with my party more tolerable. Lo and behold: PYRAMID APRICOT ALE. ON DRAFT! So here I was in the middle of suburbs and the only thing getting me through this wait were two pints of beer and a feigned interest in the current football game. Both helped kill the wait time and before I knew it I was at my table. Should have stuck to the bar. On top of the wait for the table, the wait for the food was absolutely unacceptable. And when the food did come, the appetizers came out with the food, the food came before utensils, and our server was just an overall unknowledgeable, clueless mess."
