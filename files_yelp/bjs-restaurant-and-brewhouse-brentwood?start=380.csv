John Z.,"Dublin, CA",171,309,53,3.0,11/13/2011,"BJ's is the star of the show at the Streets of Brentwood. While the rest of the shopping center struggles, BJ's packs them in because they offer something for everybody. The food selection is impressive - not quite as expansive as The Cheesecake Factory, but it still covers a lot of ground. BJ's has dishes for the pizza/calzone crowd, lighter eaters (""EnLIGHTened Dishes""), traditional food lovers, Asian fusion fans, New England Clam Chowder aficionados, the list goes on. We had the deep dish pizza for our visit. The crust was pretty good, it reminded me of the crust at Pizza Hut. The toppings a little bit scant for the price. The cheese was decent quality and the sauce was too light. We also asked for the whole wheat crust and received the regular...not cool.  The iced tea was just so so. I really couldn't taste it...no tannins at all to give it the punch I was hoping for. BJ's could learn something from Chipotle in how to make iced tea. While the minestrone was just okay, BJ's gets points for effort by offering to put it in the sourdough bread bowl and by making the top of the bowl garlic bread. Much like the Americana interpretation for all of their dishes, BJ's interior decor has a very Americana sensibility. The artwork and somewhat rustic design elements make me think of America's heartland. Maybe it has something to do with the farm murals on the outside and inside of the building. The Brentwood BJ's, which is an example of their latest model. is split into three areas - the bar, traditional booths, and the more open social area for larger groups. Each section has three completely ceiling designs - the bar has a modern mesh look, the booths a basket weave, and the more open area's ceiling is a Nordic looking upside down boat look like something from Denmark. The ceilings are framed in high quality cherrywood crown molding.  The music and overall ambiance inside the BJ's at Brentwood is very upbeat, friendly, and somewhat eclectic - again, something for nearly everybody. The restaurant is very clean and well taken care of...which it should be after being open less than two months. If I go back to the Brentwood BJ's and order something else, I might be able to give it a 4 star rating...but at this point, with an average pizza and so-so iced tea, I can only give it a solid 3 star rating."
Emily A.,"Brentwood, CA",0,11,4,5.0,8/1/2015,"My husband and I constantly do date night on the weekends at the bar. The calamari appetizers are always good, I wish it was a bigger serving though. The beer selection is great and the Mojitos  and martini drinks are always delicious."
Cliff E.,"Brentwood, CA",88,18,4,3.0,8/10/2012,"So our first experience here was  a year ago when they first opened. Let's just say the first experience was one of the worst. Pizza took forever, waitress didn't look like she knew what she was doing, it was the saddest deep dish I ever ate, and the management came out and tried to sell us on how they make their pizza's. An experience that made me never want to come back again. Fast forward a year and my son asks to go eat there to get their happy face fries... so we gave it another shot. Round 2: This time around was much better, not best, but better (jumnped 1 star up to 3). We were seated in a timely manner and the service was really good. We were informed of the special (dinner for 2 for $20) which fit exactly what we wanted to get. Ordered a medium deep dish (same as last time) and the included salad and pizzookie. Okay, now I know that when I want a real deep dish pizza, go to UNO's. Other than that the experience was good. We ended getting a large pizza at no extra charge and had some food for our dinner the next day. The kids loved the experience and the layout of the place is nice and clean. We will definitely go back again for our family dinners but will take a stab at the entree's next time around and avoid the pizza. Oh yah, and their seasonal beer is EXCELLENT!"
Lillian R.,"Discovery Bay, CA",0,23,6,4.0,2/14/2013,Great place for beer and pizza...and if you are into sports. Several televisions located through out. Service can be slow at peak times.
Joe B.,"Sacramento, CA",11,759,7,4.0,7/23/2012,"I see some of the bad reviews, but I'm happy to say that we enjoyed our time here this weekend.... We were able to get a nice table with a view of the big screen tvs to catch up on the sporting events. We ordered a few mojitos and other drinks.. The mojitos were extremely tasty and consistent each time they came out... We would come back for happy hour for sure.... Overall, a good night out...."
Gina S.,"East Bay, CA",783,70,1232,4.0,9/26/2011,"Had to come to the grand opening! Ordered ahi poke, Caesar and house salads, deep fried artichokes, baby back ribs, tuscan chicken limone, hefeweisen beer, strawberry lemonade and baked beignet for dessert. The pluses: finally close to home, entrees were delish, great ambiance and decorum. The minuses: lemon aioli is watery, beignet took too long saying they had technical difficulties. WTH? did they have to use a microwave because it is hard as hell and the waitress is still new i can tell. We were halfway into our meal when she asked if we want a to go box twice.  She then came with a box and bag and i took it.  Then hubby got the bill and she just took it and he hasnt signed for it yet.  Hubby calls her ""Jumpy""!! LOL  Sweet girl but she needs to learn timing. Hubby says im a meanie! LOL"
Janete K.,"Antioch, CA",0,44,21,2.0,10/13/2011,"Sorry, but this restaurant it's open for business but it's not quite ready yet.  We have been to different BJ's before and  I understand this one  has just opened, but there is no excuse to open its doors without necessary training.   For a party of four on 10/12/11: 1. Reception: The girl was very nice and attentive. However, there was this kid on the computer that looked like very annoyed. While waiting, I was watching how he was giving costumers very bad looks. People at the reception are supposed to smile and make the costumer comfortable. .  2. Wait: I understand that the place is packed and 30 minutes wait is understandable. However, I don't think it is OK to tell customers their table is ready and then, ask them to stand behind the reception for 10 more minutes because the table is being cleaned (actually, the guys cleaning the table were more like talking and joking around while we waited). 40 minutes wait. 3. Service: Our server was actually nice. She brought our drinks really quick. However, it took us 3 minutes to get our appetizers. After 20 minutes, they brought us wrong meals.  Then,  30 more minutes and we finally got our orders right. I should say almost right. My husband's jambalaya was a joke. Some white rice with dried chicken and shrimp on top, sprinkled (I swear) with some Cajun spice. My burger was overcooked and they didn't bring the salad I had ordered as a side.  The server came to check on us and asked if I had already got my salad. She went to get it and came back 15 minutes later, when I had already finished my burger. Sorry, but I had to send it back.   For now, it's only getting 2 stars from me because I think it has a lot to improve. I don't appreciate waiting that much and seeing other people get their orders before I do get mine. Besides that, i believe that they need step up regarding quality. I did pay their price, but I didn't get what I was told I would.  I'll be going to the one in Concord instead."
A B.,"Concord, CA",1,42,,4.0,9/13/2014,"They have a season pumpkin ale that's one of my favorites. The beer makes up for the food. Lol. The food is okay, depending on what you order. I always order something different and when I go back, I can't remember what I had in the past. That's usually my tell tell sign that the food is just okay and not memorable. This last time I ordered a steak with mashed potatoes and veggies. It was good. I love the pazookies. We get one to share for our little family of 5. Eating it alone is a sugar overload and so sweet! Great environment, staff is nice enough (they do great disappearing acts when you need refills), alcohol drinks are good, price & environment are decent. Great for kids since it tends to be a little loud in here.  Overall, we'd go again."
Lisa C.,"Brentwood, CA",25,11,,2.0,2/10/2014,"I always read the same thing about this place and it's that people try and try again to eat here and it's never a very good experience and I would have to say my experience has been the same! I never really like the food! :/ I don't like giving bad reviews but I use this site to check out all restaurants before I go to them, so honesty on this site is the best policy!"
Rick J.,"Brentwood, CA",91,48,,4.0,6/5/2014,"Like this place a lot more than most that have reviewed. A notch above other chains of the same kind. Big menu, very good beer selection. Burgers are great. Good place to watch a game, but seating near bar area and TV is limited."
Dennis H.,"Oakley, CA",0,8,,1.0,9/23/2013,"We went there a special night on the town and it was a party of 17. That would be 9 Adults and 8 children. We arrived at 430pm before anyone was even there on a Sunday and  we left ant 722pm,let's just call it a 3 HOUR dinner. We asked to talk to a manger and he said the next time you come I'll Give you a discount and we said there will NOT be a next time. As others herd of our complaints we started to get a real idea of the same problems other had. They all said the same--"" If you have a large party this is NOT the place to go"".  I say if they can't do large party's then WHY do we want to come here at all.. I have there rewards card that I will never use again... I WILL NEVER GO TO BJ'S AGAIN....... I WILL TELL ALL NOT TO GO HERE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Justin L.,"San Leandro, CA",1,29,,2.0,8/21/2015,"The waitress was very nice but she kept trying to get my date and I out. If I'm paying for an $80 meal, I'm going to enjoy it Back off. Or at least get the stuff I asked for instead of checking on the next table first."
roderick s.,"SOMA, San Francisco, CA",3,101,2,1.0,11/29/2013,"We came here for a family dinner and we were so dissapointed. Me and my wife ordered the 2 for 35, our son orderered the steak and lobster and daughter ordered the seared ahi. My wife ordered the rib eye medium rare and came out medium. Our soups came out the same time as our entree and all the steam vegies are cold. The manager Rebecca came out with with the rib eye wants to verify if we want medium rare or rare I have to cut the steak again and showed her if she thinks pink inside is medium rare. And she said "" yes it is medium rare"". WOW! We have been to many steak house and pretty much they get our order right. And we know the difference if how our steaks get cook. They did redo the steak. It's just how the manager handled the situation."
Chris M.,"Brentwood, CA",0,1,,1.0,10/6/2011,"Decided to try BJ's yesterday, as a first timer and it was an experience I would rather forget. Seating time was about thirty minutes, average for restaurant time. But the servers lacked the experience and common courtesy I'm used too. Plates were handed to me rather than placed on the table, I was always replied back with a ""yeah....""  ""what...."".  I understand they have been in service for less than two weeks, but to wait an hour for my entire family's order is extremely slow. I finally had to walk out when the family sitting behind us, received their food first and only after about 30 minutes. Their group was bigger than my family of 5. The whole time I was waiting was 1 hour, after I placed the order. Either they didn't send the order in and forgot about it, or they were to busy to care. I got there at 5:50 seated at 6:20, ordered 6:30, received appetizers @ 6:50, attempted to deliver our order @ 7:30, after they served family that came in after us in only 30 minutes?? I noticed other customers complaining too, and the staff seemed to be congregating among themselves, for whatever reason. Kept getting apologies from some staff and manager. But they never did give a complimentary card for dinner next time, which is the common norm in any restaurant. Common sense, dictates that, but they don't have much since they failed to deliver. Blame this on the inexperienced servers, and managers. We are only human, so in time maybe I'll give BJ's another try, until then I'll spend it elsewhere!!"
Michelle M.,"Oakley, CA",25,4,,2.0,1/19/2014,My family and I went to BJ's last night for a early dinner. The service was absolutely horrible. We had to wait 20 minutes just for a drinks. Another 10 minutes after that just to order our food. My husband and both ordered side salads they didn't get served to is until we had to ask two times for them. After waiting for an hour we eventually got our dinner. Well me and my three children got our dinner. My husband's dinner came out about five minutes later. The restaurant wasn't even busy!! We spoke to manager and he said that he was going to bring out a COUPLE of desserts once we were done with our dinners. We waited 10 minutes for the dessert. When the manager came out he only had ONE dessert with four spoons to share. We were a table of five people! So even though the manager got involved their service still didn't exceed our expectations. I don't know if we will ever go back.
Princess B.,"Antioch, CA",102,54,4,2.0,4/16/2014,"I've been to other locations, but for some reason this location is by far the worst. It's not only the food, but the service. The food is gross, bland, usually cold because the wait staff takes forever. I don't get it. Come on Brentwood, I have given this location MANY chances. Maybe if I become a beer drinker, I'd like it. This location needs to step up and hopefully they read these reviews and get it together!"
Rock A.,"Antioch, CA",0,17,,4.0,6/14/2014,"It gives me pleasure to have to write this review. We dined at the Brentwood restaurant, 6-13-14 for early dinner (approx 6:00pm) and was greeted accordingly by the front. The food was delicious. I had the Burger platter, and my wife had the lemon pasta dish. The thing that really stood out the most was the great service we received by our waitress Sarah.  She was very pleasant, smiled continuously, and made sure she not only got our food, but we were taken cared of. The server makes a huge difference. Few servers would make their clients feel comfortable and satisfied. Sarah stands out above the rest in that restaurant, as well as many other service businesses. She deserves recognition for over all excellent performance and attitude."
Stewart B.,"Castro Valley, CA",12,256,137,3.0,3/21/2014,BJ's Barbecue Lunch Platter was very good. pulled pork slider and Jallelujah-spiced chicken breast with wedge cut seasoned fries and slaw. Yum.
Bridgett L.,"Antioch, CA",0,4,3,5.0,7/28/2014,"Whenever I feel like having a drink and a nice bite to eat I think of this place, especially after I've had a loooong day at work. SHAWN the bartender is suuuuper cool and knows how to treat his guests well. Whenever we come, we go straight to the bar top becasue we know we will get great service."
Leo M.,"Brentwood, CA",85,5,,5.0,9/1/2015,"Giving you guys 5 stars because I've never been let down. Plus, anyone who complains that food takes too long can go home and cook it themselves. You get to sit, talk to good company, and have food served to you. It's a packed place, so expect a long wait."
