Kelli S.,"Antioch, CA",121,31,6,5.0,6/28/2017,"Ever run around all day and then get home and realize you're hungry? And you don't want fast food? And it's 10:30 at night? I looked on Yelp for ""what's open now"".  Most place were closing in 27 minutes, but BJ's was open until midnight.  Yay.  Their online ordering makes it super easy to order for curbside pick up.  It asked for my member number and while I was looking for it in my email I found a coupon for a free appetizer!  Yay again. I had the Parmesan crusted chicken and the stuffed mushroom appetizer.  It was really good.  It was ready when I arrived and I just showed her the coupon on my phone and she took it right off even though I didn't add it when I submitted the order.   The curbside was so fast and easy, I'll be using it again."
Megan J.,"Antioch, CA",40,13,30,1.0,3/10/2017,Place is a joke called ahead 2 hrs came 20 mins early they said they would text us never did! We have 5 young kids in our party they messed up my name and people let a family of 9 in before us so we have been waiting over an hour with a screaming baby wow this is just unexplainable!!
Est L.,"Concord, CA",23,5,9,4.0,9/25/2017,came in for 1/2 off pizza.. service started off slow.. but Brody (maybe Brodie *shrug) managed to pick things back up & enough to where we stopped worrying brentwood bj's was becoming like concord..
Alicia R.,"Stockton, CA",39,7,1,4.0,4/10/2017,"We had an awesome waitress, Amy. Loved the service, our potato skins were a little greasy and crispy, our pizza was good just needed a little extra sauce"
Debra F.,"Brentwood, CA",10,5,,1.0,8/19/2017,"Take home service was horrible. We called in our order, but still had to wait an hour. The order wasn't brought out at the same time. The pizza was left out behind the counter about 1 hr and became like cardboard. The avacado appetizer was put it the warmer and became warm black mush. There was heavy salt on the shrimp tacos making it inedible. They almost forgot the cookie so it wasn't baked. Everything was bad and worth $0. The manager stating he was from a different location apologized and said he would send me a $50 certificate to use when eating in sometime, but I never received this promised certificate. Their rating was truly a 0 for food and service provided worth 0."
Jewells Z.,"Oakley, CA",133,89,64,1.0,8/9/2017,"Ive been disappointed with this place every time I've been there. I have tried different things, but it's always the same outcome, meh. The last time we went, it was because friends wanted this place. The guys are big eaters, so they ordered the Bison Burger, with an extra patty, thinking it would be humongous as hell, and filling. It was NEITHER!! They wolfed down those bland burgers, and were complaining that it didn't do anything for them. At $20 a pop, they should've been popping at the seams. I ordered a pasta dish, and it was bland. We also ordered Mac n cheese for our friends baby, and they brought it when everyone was done eating, and in top of that it looked like Kraft Mac & Cheese. I fed the baby my pasta, and she got full. Our $75 was not at all worth it! We've been to basic places that had better burgers and food. So, sorry to say, we won't be going to this place, or any of its chain affiliates.  Oh, and our server was snooty, and was MIA most of the time. I swear, if we were in the desert, we would've died of dehydration!!"

David A.,"Antioch, CA",112,7,,5.0,9/20/2017,A great time as usual! Anthony and I enjoy taking advantage of the late night happy hour. We have a Jambalaya addiction that only BJ's can handle. Tabatha was our server and she was pure awesomeness! Thank you for such a wonderful experience!
J W.,"San Francisco, CA",0,183,986,3.0,5/6/2017,"This review is for end of March 2017.  I've been to BJ's once back a several years ago.  We've spent more than $100 back then and I did not like the food especially the pizza (overpriced for the portion) or the service. ATMOSPHERE: Very nice atmosphere.  It is trendy and loud.  I like restaurants that are loud because that way other people could not easily listen in on our conversation.     SERVICE: Finally came back here with my friend for lunch.  The server was attentive in the beginning and she even poured more iced tea for us without asking which was nice.  After my dessert came, our server brought over our bill and I asked her for water since I drank all of my iced tea.  She took our payment but never brought me water.  I was so thirsty after eating the pizookie that I needed some water.   FOOD:  - Lemon Thyme Chicken $11.25 - 3/5.  Served with brown rice, sautéed red onions, fire-roasted red bell peppers, tomatoes and roasted brussels sprouts in lemon thyme sauce.  The sauce was a  little too soupy and tangy but good.    - Clam Chowder Soup - 4/5.  Good flavor.    - Roasted Salmon Peruvian Quinoa Bowl $15.95 - Sautéed red onions, quinoa, sliced mushrooms, sautéed spinach, seasoned tomatoes, extra virgin olive oil and lemon juice.  There was quite a bit of spinach.  Salmon was cooked just right.  - Salted Carmel Pizookie - 3/5 (cookie baked in a pan topped with Vanilla ice cream) $7.50.  Too sweet and it's quite small.  It cooled too fast and the cookie got too crunchy. Great that BJ's have a lunch menu.  They have a special price for lunch to add a bowl of soup or a side salad.  If I can remember, I think it was $1.75 extra.   Overall, I would return for the atmosphere."
Christina M.,"Roseville, CA",0,2,7,1.0,8/17/2017,"Extremely disappointed by our visit. The service just keeps getting worse and worse! Out glasses stayed empty the whole time  Our waiter walked by probably 4 times when our glasses were empty, looked at them then walked away. We had to ask for water every time - pretty sure it's common sense to ask your customers for a refill.  The main reason why we came tonight aaa for a pazooki. I ordered 1/2 peanut butter 1/2 chocolate chip. Our waiter repeated it back to me to make sure he got it correct and he did....until he brought it to me. He gave me some weird carmel thing which was not what I ordered (he got everyone else's correct) and so I sent it back. While I'm waiting for my correct pazooki to come I have to sit and watch everyone eat there's. When my pazooki finally comes it's like soup!  Totally raw I couldn't even eat it - it was horrible! I am just so disappointed because all week I've been waiting to go to bjs for a pazooki and instead am served a nasty pazooki soup with a big side of horrible service! This service at this place hasn't ever been great but tonight it takes the cake!!  Never again! If I want a pazooki I'll go get a cowboy cookie at Black Angus"
Nydia S.,"Brentwood, CA",16,147,261,4.0,3/4/2016,"Pleasantly surprised this early evening as we considered the possibilities due to some very negative reviews on wait times. We were seated promptly upon arriving at 6:30. Our server Dustin was super attentive and quick to bring needed items like condiments and refills of refreshments without us even mentioning. He provided exceptional service. Our food came in less than 20 minutes and when I realized I'd forgotten to specify my desire for a clam chowder bread bowl instead of a regular bowl, the server assisting Dustin explained than it would be slightly more in cost and 6 minutes longer in preparation. It's always good to have these things explained. :-) The kids enjoyed their meals of pizza, and mini corn dogs with fries. The Kale and Brussels Sprout salad was equally delicious (I could use fewer cranberries). All is all we had a pleasant evening dinner and we were done without meals within an hr and 20 minutes of arrival. Yay to a good dinner night."
Rick S.,"Brentwood, CA",0,11,2,1.0,10/21/2017,"We came in and met with the hostess. Gave our name and when she said it would be 45 minutes for a table when she suggested 15 minutes for outside. Then 45 minutes later I asked the reason for the delay and she said she forgot to put us on the list. Several families came and were seated after we arrived. She immediately seated us at a small inside table. Then when I ordered, my food came virtually under cooked and cold. Service was slow and they seemed to ignore us. We've eaten at this BJs several times and have to say service has been rapidly declining."
Andy S.,"Brentwood, CA",37,81,17,5.0,8/4/2017,Went here tonight for dinner with my wife. There was a little bit of a wait but to be expected as it was prime time for dinner. I got the black and bleu burger and she got a chicken dinner both were very good and cooked perfect. Also got the 3 sample pizookie platter which was good lol our waitress was very busy but it's honestly some of the best service we have ever got at a restaurant. She made sure everything was good at all times from start to finish and always refilled waters before they were empty. She even applied a 10 dollar coupon that we found last minute on my phone. Thanks for a great night out! Highly recommended
Zehavit C.,"Brentwood, CA",197,163,1285,4.0,11/8/2015,"So I went today to BJ's again! The food and the service was way better than last time. We were party of 13. We got the big long table in the middle of the restaurant. The TV was playing the Sunday night football game... Which was very entertaining  We ordered;  Drinks: Strawberry patch cocktail, handcraft Piranha Pale Ale, Ice tea & sprite.    Appetizer: Brussels sprouts, beets salad, asparagus and portobello mushroom salad, and Tuscan tomato soup in a sourdough bread bowl,   Main dishes: Chipotle Glazed Salmon, veggie patty Hamburg with French fries, margarita flat bread pizza, and kids Mac & Cheese.    Dessert: peanut butter S'mores Pizookie The foods was pretty good and we all enjoyed it!!!    I usually love BJ's restaurant, but this one in Brentwood, unfortunately is not so good! Most of the time they messed up my order. The food doesn't taste the same (I guess it's the chef). I think they have way too much dishes on the menu."
Nelitta C.,"Antioch, CA",4,33,7,3.0,8/12/2017,"Our servers were awesome! Very fast with refills! *5 stars to them!!! No complaints there. However, our food was brought to us very dry and over cooked. Our server apologized before we even got to see for ourselves stating that it had been sitting under the heat for too long. It was a busy evening... and the fact that the manager came out to make it right, is good enough for us to go back and give it another try"
Janet B.,"Oakley, CA",0,3,,1.0,9/7/2017,"HORRIBLE!!!! We tried eating here on Sunday around 6pm.  We didn't wait long, when seated my daughter asked for a kids menu...  Do you know the hostess told my daughter she could bring her a menu to color on, but she can't order from it!!!!!!  I asked why, she said because its for kids 12 and under.  I asked how does she know my daughter isn't 12, the hostess didn't answer and walked away.  The server came over a few minutes late, took our drink order returned with the drinks and took our order.. Mind you, he DID NOT write anything down and the items we ordered did not come with specific sides...  So after about 20 minutes someone else came to our table to ask what we had ordered... REALLY....  At this point we walked out.  I emailed BJ's of our experience on Tuesday and still have not heard from them..."
Nikki W.,"San Leandro, CA",6,97,,3.0,7/30/2017,"Went to BJ's with my cousin while I was visiting her. The restaurant wasn't overly crowded when we got there but we were still required to wait 15 minutes which is ok. The hostess wasn't very inviting and seemed more interested in the personal conversation she was having with another employee.  We were seated and were immediately asked if we wanted something to drink. My cuz and I just wanted water and it was brought right out. I ended up ordering the Brussels sprouts for an appetizer and an ahi salad for my entree. The Brussels sprouts were burned and shriveled up and the taste just wasn't pleasant. The texture of the ahi tuna in the salad was a bit mushy and I was too afraid to eat it. My cuz said that her food was just ok (boneless wings& BBQ chicken chop salad) but nothing to write home about.  Our server was ok, not bad, just ok. The dinning area and the women's restroom were clean and orderly. I don't typically dine at BJ's but it was close and the experience is what I expected from this type of restaurant."
Osiel E.,"Brentwood, CA",72,1,,1.0,10/13/2017,Horrible service here always get orders wrong make you wait long and come find out they forgot to write your name down
Maddie J.,"Brentwood, CA",0,1,,5.0,11/21/2017,"Bj's wasn't very busy and was understaffed so 3 stars to bjs. However , our waiter , Brodie made the experience the best so 5 stars for him! He was super nice and the mf plug dude. This man deserves a promotion."
Mary S.,"Brentwood, CA",37,2,,1.0,4/21/2017,"I WILL NEVER COME HERE AGAIN! They told us they wouldn't split our bill for our large group. Then they fucked up our bill and left and came back with our bill all split?!? Why didn't they give us that option in the beginning? It wasn't even split properly and they charged us for things we never ordered! He wouldn't even get the manager when we asked!  We specifically ordered for the kids first so their orders will be brought out first.... their food came out 10 minutes after the adults!!  The service is slow and HORRIBLE!!  I've been here before with a small group and the service was slow and the food was horrible.  So don't come here with a big group and don't come here with a big group.  As I'm writing this, I see the manager talking with a group of employees talking shit about our group and the fact we're complaining! I'm videotaping them and I'll be posting it online"
