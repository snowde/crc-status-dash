Bob M.,"Discovery Bay, CA",1,61,,3.0,11/4/2011,"I guess my expectations were too high after reading all of the reviews before we tried this place.  My wife and I went to BJ's in Brentwood on a Thursday about 6 pm or so. Though there were many groups of people in line, we got right in. The staff was very friendly and informative. Our first and very obvious observation is that it's an extremely LOUD atmosphere. My wife and I had a booth for two and we literally had to shout at each other in order to communicate. My wife ordered their fish & chips, and I tried their chicken fried steak, as that's one of my most favorite ""homestyle"" types of meals. My wife said the batter they used on the fish was very good, but that the fish itself had no flavor whatsoever.   The chicken fried steak just wasn't memorable for me at all, but was memorable enough to know that I'll never order it again there.   There were mashed potatoes covered by two nice portions of meat, which was fine, but there was no gravy on the potatoes, and there couldn't have been much more than 2 tablespoons of gravy on the meat itself. What there was of the gravy, was very watery and didn't go very far on taste; actually the gravy had little-to-no taste at all.  I asked our server for more gravy, and she brought me probably not much more than a shot glass full of additional tasteless watery gravy. One of the managers came by to ask us how our meal was, and I explained my concern about my chicken fried steak, and he was the first to admit that the Black Bear Diner in Oakley does a much better job in their preparation. I told him that I'd eaten their chicken fried steak there dozens of times in the past and was very pleased. Now if you read between the lines on what this guy said, he simply stated ""Yea...some of our food sucks so you might want to go elsewhere else, depending on what you're in the mood for!"" (LOL)  We believe in giving different restaurants at least 2 - 3 chances unless there's something terribly wrong the first time around. We'll be returning one of these days but will each try something else the next time around. I'd have to say that the service was good, yet  about ""average"" like everywhere else and that the prices overall were pretty reasonable for the quantity and quality. Overall...it's worth a visit if you haven't tried the place before!"
Dustin M.,"Brentwood, CA",10,44,14,4.0,5/29/2012,"Went back- food was just as good, if not better! Call ahead seating got me right into a booth.  Black cherry soda- try it!!"
Dena M.,"Bethel Island, CA",22,5,2,1.0,8/23/2014,"I have been to this location many times and had mixed experiences. This trip takes the cake. I ordered my usual Parmesan crusted chicken, generally delicious. The first one came to the table soggy, undercooked, and with a puddle oil on the plate. The waiter took the plate back and got me a new one. I hate sending food back for the fear what will happen to it in the kitchen. The second plate came out and looked like normal, crispy golden brown. After eating one of the chicken fillets I moved the second piece and found a black hair hidden under my food. Now I was disgusted! The only positive to this trip was our waiter, he was awesome! They ended up taking the meal off my bill but I will not be back for a while"
Chuck F.,"Byron, CA",10,35,,4.0,1/14/2015,"The management for BJs has settled in and are a solid performing restaurant.  The earlier cleanliness issues are resolved as is the speed of service.  Overall, this is a regular eating place for us because of the high variety of beers available."
Ken M.,"Byron, CA",0,45,,4.0,7/12/2015,"Finally got there for dinner. Wife had her regular angel hair pasta with shrimp and pronounced it excellent as usual. I had a Ceasar salad and jambalaya. Salad was a little mild, but fresh and good. Jambalaya was excellent, as good as any NOLA place. Both took home plenty for future lunches. Service very good and friendly. Increasing my rating to four stars now that I know it's good for dinner too."
Brian F.,"Brentwood, CA",0,13,1,1.0,5/16/2015,"I'm not sure why I do this to myself. Another evening at this restaurant and have waited 40 minutes without my appetizer arriving yet. Hopefully it shows up ahead of our entrees. I get that it's busy, staff accordingly or figure out how to make the kitchen more efficient."
Ling Ling R.,"Sacramento, CA",49,116,96,3.0,7/29/2013,"Service is hit and miss. Our waitress last night was very rude. Last time I checked its pretty hard to find a job in this economy, change the attitude and everyone will end up having a good time. Food was good though."
Angela C.,"Concord, CA",1,10,3,1.0,7/9/2014,"I was with a large group for a birthday dinner, which understandably gets loud but the rudeness and the nerve of this staff is ridiculous. To top it all off they charged my credit card thirty dollars more than they should have. After fighting and fighting with management and proof of the reciept againt my bank staement , they finally took it off but not happily. I make sure i steer away from this place when im in the area, worst part is, I love BJs food and frequently go to their Concord location. As for Brentwood, I will never give them my business again."
Matthew R.,"Brentwood, CA",27,27,1,4.0,4/8/2015,Very quick dinner with a co worker.  Had the bacon cheese Niger with wedge fries. Couldn't go wrong.  Also tried the Irish root beer. Not bad. Finished off with a black cherry cola.  All in all a pretty good deal.
Rachel R.,"Pittsburg, CA",172,138,111,4.0,12/29/2011,"I would definitely go again... I'm surprised at the loads of bad reviews.  I went for lunch with co-workers a couple of days before the Christmas holiday.  It was packed with families and business lunches going on, we were seated right away by an energetic and cheerful hostess.  As soon as we sat down we were greeted by our waiter who was very eager to please, he wanted to take down our drink order/appetizers right away, but we were waiting for one more person.  When she arrived he came right back to take our order, which we weren't entirely ready since she just got there.  That might of played a part in why I didn't give 5 stars, he came a little too often when we weren't ready. My co-worker ordered the stuffed mushroom appetizer (I am not a stuffed mushroom person) to my surprise it was amazingly good!!!  I had the Hand breaded Chicken Parmigiana, An Italian classic! Hand breaded breast of chicken smothered with provolone cheese and served over spaghetti noodles tossed in spicy marinara sauce.  It was very good, I didn't read the fine detail where it said spicy marinara, I'm not much of a spicy food eater but it was fine!  My co-workers both had the Half Flatbread Pizza & Salad, they both had it with California Club.  For dessert we had the pizookie trio!  Everything was delish and hit the spot!"
Rodesha J.,"Antioch, CA",9,16,13,2.0,12/2/2011,"I've been to BJ's twice and I can say i will only go there for drinks. First visit only had appetizers and they weren't very appetizing.  The second visit it was extremely busy so we  understood the wait.  But once seated we waited 20 plus minutes for our drinks 2 beers and a lemonade.  We ordered and NEVER received any of our food.  We watched as others who were seated after us be served and finally the waiter (very young kid) came and said ""what did you order again?"".  He then said let me get the manager.  The manager informed us that the waiter, NEVER put our order in!!!! :( So we decided to leave. The only reason I'm giving two stars is because the Manager gave us our drinks for free. SHOULD HAVE ORDER TWO BEERS!! LOL!! my advice is eat there at your own risk and don't be two hunger!!"
H M.,"Brentwood, CA",0,26,,3.0,6/27/2015,Typical chain restaurant.  I like the ambiance.  It can get crowded on the weekends so be prepared to wait with a larger group.  Food is sub par.  I always go with the soup/bread bowl which I love.
Stacy G.,"Antioch, CA",4,31,2,1.0,2/26/2014,Came here b4 Xmas during the week and had to wait 30 min for a table for 2 and the place was half full.  When they seated us it was next to a large party with what appeared to be well behaved kids.  Long story short...long waits for water...menus....silverware. ..order steak with baked potato and 25 min after taking the order they came back and said they didnt have potatoes anymore.  Mind u the large party had 2 wait persons waiting on them hand and foot.  The kids started acting up and the losey parents didnt care when started playing chase.  They didnt give us a break with the lack of knowing they r out of food...mind u it took forever for our food to come and it was cold.  And finaly after dropping off the bill and taking forever to pick it back up to the front to pay because we were tired of waiting and annoyed by the terrible kids.  Would give a half a star but Yelp wont let u.
Heidi M.,"Brentwood, CA",17,4,,5.0,4/23/2014,Went in on a Sunday around 5 pm and were seated immediately.  Our server was very friendly and suggested some appetizers.  Both suggestions were absolutely delicious!  Our meals were hot and perfectly timed and our drinks were re-filled regularly.  Had a great experience and can't wait to return!
Hazel S.,"Ontario, CA",0,65,5,2.0,3/17/2014,"The food was just not up to par with what it should be.  Service was ok, not bad - but not stellar either.   Sizzler is better than BJ's."
Eddie N Amanda B.,"Brentwood, CA",18,3,,1.0,7/26/2012,"One star cause the food is decent, one for beer selection, wait this is the second time I've ordered a lost coast beer and been told they're out. So make it 1 star cause I didn't get sick from the food.  I had to ask for 4 of the 6 meals, I asked if the meal I ordered was filling, waiter said yes. It was the size of a kids pizza at pizza hut, but cost $10. Good thing my kids didn't finish their food. Go somewhere else to eat. Come here to sit at the bar."
P J.,"San Francisco, CA",0,36,5,4.0,10/10/2011,"First off, it's very loud. Capital L!  Good menu. Good food. Reasonable prices. Friendly staff. (Our server forgot quite a few things but it was opening week, we were a large group and it was extremely busy...so we'll overlook that and see how she does next time around) Great place to watch Sports. TVs are strategically placed so even 'Dad' can check out the game while having dinner with the family.  Might stay crowded awhile since it just opened; best to call ahead for seating or go during the 'slow' times. Try the Giant Baked Potato - you won't be disappointed!"
Bernadette F.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",1,21,12,2.0,4/9/2014,This was the first time I was disappointed at BJ's. Had the lunch special of salad and choice of pasta. I ordered the Scampi and my friend ordered the same thing. I had 3 shrimp on my plate and she had at least 10 when it arrived. That is a huge discrepancy and for $15+ this was definitely not worth it. Will stay away from this one and go to other restaurants next time.
Matt D.,"Brentwood, CA",0,5,,1.0,6/3/2014,I've been here 5 times.  Every time ether terrible service or poorly cooked food.  The beer is average and the stout is watery.  We usually have to wait an hour to be seated and served.  I don't know why it took 5 visits to make this decision but I will not waste anymore time and money at BJs.
Cathy D.,"Brentwood, CA",95,31,2,1.0,4/2/2013,"Save your time and money. Terrible service, mass produced food. You can get the same stuff at McDonalds but with better service"
