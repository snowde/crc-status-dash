Colby S.,"Brentwood, CA",6,37,,4.0,1/30/2015,"Its a busy restaurant, but good food and beer. We've had large groups go there for dinner on busy nights, but have always had excellent service. And the kids all go crazy for the pazookie."
Corey G.,"Brentwood, CA",2,7,14,3.0,2/24/2014,I give the food 4 stars but the service 2 stars (at least in the dining area). There are some good waiters and waitresses but it seems like it always takes an eternity to get the food around dinner time. Never any issues at lunch time though.
Amanda M.,"Brentwood, CA",9,2,,1.0,1/5/2013,"Wow. I have had the most awful week dealing with BJs. I was having lunch with my husband on new years eve when I went to go put my Iphone in my purse. However the Iphone slips off of my purse and into this small space between the booth and the wall. the space is about half an inch wider than my Iphone and it quickly becomes clear that it is stuck deep between the booth and the wall.  We tell our waiter what has happened and he reassures us that he will be informing a manager. The manager doesn't come until nearly a half an hour later and gives us a bent ladle to try and get the phone out of the space. He helps us for a short time and then is off doing manager things, Meanwhile, my husband is using all sorts of tools to try and pull my phone out of the small space but to no avail. On his last try he had the cellphone pinned between make shift tongs he had made out of two knives and he nearly had it out of the space when it slips from his grip, and disappears into the wall.  My husband and i spent an hour trying to get my phone out of the booth, only to have it slip further. So my phone was stuck in a wall. The manager apologizes, takes down my husbands number and assures us he will get back to us.  THREE DAYS LATER, it is decided that the booth will be cut open and my cell phone will be taken out. I understood, but was having a very hard time being without my cellphone for three days, but i figured one more day wouldn't hurt.  I return on the fourth day, when the phone was supposed to be ready and speak to a manager Ivan. Ivan quickly walks up to  me and says, ""well we have cut open the wall, and your phone was not there, and there is no hole."" He takes me over to the booth that they had cut open and reassembled only for it to be THE WRONG BOOTH! I told him that my phone was in fact in the next booth, to which he said, ""oh...uh.... we cut that one too."" Then Ivan has the nerve to say to me, ""maybe you left your phone somewhere else and just thought you left it here."" ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?!?!! His superior, Rich, comes out and is flabbergasted that they opened the wrong booth, and Ivan tells Rich that they didn't in fact open my booth. So Ivan lied straight to my face about my booth being open and insulted me saying that I just ""forgot"" where my phone was. They decided to call the crew to come out again to cut the correct booth saying that it would be ready by tomorrow (Day 5 for those of you keeping track at home.) So I arrive on the final day. My phone is ready and I didn't get to even talk to the manager or get an apology or jack @#%$%. I am happy to have my phone ready, but i am furious with how I was treated and I will NEVER be returning to BJ's again."
Michelle W.,"Brentwood, CA",167,351,41,4.0,11/8/2011,"Went with the family and had a nice time.  They have an okay kids menu which our older son loves.  Our baby eats bits and pieces off of every ones plates.  My husband likes the french toast and I had the buffalo wings.  I wouldn't get the wings again, but I'm all for trying more dishes there.   Service was okay.  The waitress asked our son if he wanted cheese on his burger and then it didn't come with it.  When I asked the guy that brought out the rest of the meals he said it doesn't come with it.  When I said that our waitress offered it he said okay and brought a plate of cheese.  It just wasn't the same as having it melted on the burger so Dylan didn't eat it.   We will be back!   Bonus, it's loud so we weren't too worried about our 1 year old being a little loud."
L Z.,"Oakley, CA",0,4,,3.0,5/19/2015,I took my daughter to BJ'S and I must say we both were content with the meals.  The waiter Chris was very friendly and attentive to us.  He made  a couple of recommendations and we thought of having a pazooki after dinner but we were stuffed.  We will be going back so I can try a pazooki according to my daughter and the waiter their delicious.
John S.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,11,1,2.0,5/11/2014,"Music was so loud you had to shout your order to the waitress, who did not have any Basic Knowledge on house brewed beer types. I was served 3 Bite Size salmon pieces vs singular piece that was not even close or the same as the menu larger pictorial Portions. Waitress said ""they used a Wide Angle Camara"", really? The main course was served very Sporadically so family had to wait to everyone was served to eat."
Diane O.,"Brentwood, CA",17,3,,1.0,2/24/2013,"I need to have my head examined! About every 3 months or so I convince myself that BJs has probably stepped up their service. I love the menu but can die of thirst and starvation waiting for service. So I figured if I sit at the bar, I will get a drink a little quicker. Not much quicker. These bartenders are slow as snails. I also sit there to enjoy a little adult time. (Kid Free) Not at BJs, they allow small children to sit at the bar and whine and cry while I'm trying to enjoy my overpriced drinks. Then to add insult, they serve me my salad 50 minutes post ordering and 1 minute later, served my entre. So now I have to mow through my salad so my dinner doesn't go cold. No such luck. My beautiful Mahi Mahi was ice cold. Then to top that off, the kitchen expediter took the liberty to add seracha chili to my meal. Thanks a heap. If it's not on the menu, do not put it on my meal!!! I didn't complain while there since I'm tired of having sections of my meal comped. Just get it right the first time and I will gladly pay the bill with tip at the end. Comping my meal means I didn't have an enjoyable time.  Corporate really needs to look long and hard at the manager of this one store. I've met the unkempt bed and now I know why this place is in trouble. If your manager can't take the time to dress appropriately for his rank, how can he run a successful kitchen? This time for sure, I will not be back!!!"
Kandi B.,"Long Beach, CA",11,47,26,1.0,11/2/2013,This bj suckssss!! Stay away!!! Bad cooks bad food but our server joe gets 5 stars
Nise R.,"Concord, CA",43,77,2,2.0,1/8/2013,"Each time I go here, which isn't often, I say, I'm not coming back. It is out of pure convenience since not much is open late.... I was here last night and had to wait for a mini spicy meatball pizza for over 35 minutes???? The pepsi tasted flat. Although, I prefer coke. The Dr Pepper wasn't much better.  It obviously was not worth it. I was just about to cancel my order when it finally arrived! Don't go if you are hungry and want to eat in a decent time frame! The bartender said he was going to check and see what was taking so long, then when he came back, he never mentioned anything? No thanks, I think IF I ever eat at Bj's again, it will be the Concord location."
Sunny P.,"Vallejo, CA",174,73,16,4.0,1/2/2012,"I've been to BJ's bar area for both food and drinks in the evening. I always have great service!! The bar staff is always attentive and polite.  I love the menu, alsmost anything you possibly could want is on it, and it's been great."
Ellen C.,"Discovery Bay, CA",0,6,7,2.0,5/2/2015,"Our visit on 4/26 was terrible!  Came in at 3 pm was seated quickly & waitress took our drink order.  25 min later we still hadn't gotten our drinks.  Waitress apologized said bar was busy.  Really cause it sure didn't look like it and the rest of the place didn't look that busy!  Hate to see what would happen on a busy day. My husband ordered the chili Frito's nachos.  When it arrived there was a little cheese and jalopinos on top but nothing under it, where was the chili???  We sent it back but then decide to cancel the order and ordered something else. This is the second, BJs we've been to and both experiences were not enjoyable."
Erich D.,"Brentwood, CA",165,115,83,5.0,9/20/2011,"Five stars for great service and excellent food, my party of four was here for their soft opening and they really hit it out of the park!!"
Bryan R.,"Santa Clarita, CA",6,24,6,2.0,11/7/2013,This place sucks. I have been here 3 times and there won't be a fourth. The service is the worst. Each time we have waited over 45 minutes for our food. The food all 3 times came cold and looked and tasted warmed over. My family of 5 will never go back to this BJ's.
Ethel-Lynn Q.,"Pleasanton, CA",536,181,64,3.0,9/25/2013,"The first time I went there I think their fish and chips was too oily, the second time I visited the service was ok for a big group.  They forgot one of the kids meals so that was a long wait.  Anyhow, it's the only BJs in town.  At least they are more clean than the Chili's in Brentwood."
Jessica C.,"Brentwood, CA",0,10,,2.0,4/13/2012,"Went here on a date with my fiance..the place was way too LOUD!  service was great though we just couldnt hear eachother talk. Oh and for the girls that work there, when you see a guy is on a date DONT say hi especially when he isnt even intrested in talking to you, cause then you just ruined a date! thanksss much!"
Debbie F.,"Antioch, CA",0,5,,1.0,7/30/2012,"Normally I'm not that picky with my food - especially when I'm not having to make it myself.  I'd been craving ribs all day.  When my husband, friends, and I finally got to BJ's in the evening my husband and I were starving and anticipating delicious, juicy, falling off the bone pork ribs. I got a halfrack that seemed alot smaller than ""half"" of the full rack my husband got. It looked and tasted like it was the other side of a half rack that was ordered several hours ago and kept under the warmer waiting for someone to order the other half.    It was served on a plate the same size as they use for mini pizzas so I couldn't open the baked potato without it falling off the plate onto the table.  The waiter didn't bring me a rib cutting knife so had to wait 5 minutes and watch everyone eat until he brought one.   The ribs were dry and hard with the sauce baked on -  probably from being under a warmer.  (And I asked for no sauce.) PLUS it was $17.25 For a dubious ""half"" rack of ribs and 19.95 for a FULL rack.  What a rip off! Bottom line: next time I want ribs we're definately going someplace else."
Sonia A.,"Antioch, CA",68,13,,1.0,11/11/2012,"Two words. Horrible service. I came to eat here with my niece and the waitress had us waiting 50 minutes after the 15 minute mark of ordering... No restaurant should make their customers wait that long! I went up to complain to the hostess and asked to see a manager, and she assured me that she would come to our table. But of course, timing is not their thing and I had to wait it out until the same hostess passed by my table and AGAIN I had to ask to see the manager. Mind you, the food is still not here. I hear the hostess talking to our waitress and the waitress says ""I'm not sure, it should be ready by now, I'll have to go check."" ... it should be ready by now is an understatement. By the time the food came it was cold and had obviously been sitting around for the waitress for some time, and the presentation was completely off. Fyi, if you order something one day and get the same thing the next, chances are it won't be the same. This is called spotty service, or hit or miss. Finally the manager came by and apologized and she said she would take one of the dishes off the check, and when I got the check shortly after nothing was taken off. Never coming here again, and am going to tell all my friends the same. It's a shame because I really wanted to try one of their desserts. But there are far too many places I'd rather go to, and even  drive the extra miles to Walnut Creek for better service."
Tt M.,"Whittier, CA",67,29,3,3.0,11/5/2011,"OK-- I should probably give it 4 stars because the manager was so nice!  The reason for the 3-star review is because we actually waited 2 hours for a table for a party of eight...crazy, right? I know,  but the group wanted to stay.   Once we put our foot down and begged the manager for his help he got us a table within 10 minutes and actually cleaned it himself.  Then he hooked us up with that incredibly massive dessert (a huge multi-variety cookie with like 8 scoops of ice cream gently melting on top-- so yummy!) Everyone in our party seemed very happy by the end of the night-- the drinks were good and the dessert was superb!"
Jennifer R.,"Brentwood, CA",81,11,1,3.0,1/26/2013,"I really wish I could rate BJ's in Brentwood better; however, they mess up on orders WAY too often.  Drinks, Meals, and the amount of time it takes to receive your food.  Why do I keep going back??   Because, despite all of this, the Food is really good and I have no problem letting management know of the issues.   They NORMALLY rectify the situation and/or comp the dish.  What is a shame, is that this shouldn't have to happen.   BJ's, I am pulling for you...But, you need to step it up!!"
Dee S.,"Brentwood, CA",5,8,2,3.0,10/25/2013,"My friend and I shared the 2 for $20 deal. Amazingly, it was a lot of food. We had the Cesar salad, Chicken Ranch Pizza, and the chocolate chip pazookie. All good!  The wait staff need to really step up their game. Slow and unattentive. It was a normal lunch crowd, no excuse. The stars are for the food only."
