Bryce L.,"Antioch, CA",0,4,1,2.0,2/1/2014,"I've been here several times, and each time it has been almost good.  Last time, the waitress was gruff and one person got the entirely wrong dish.  This time,  my rib eye was cooked properly and even seasoned, but the wedge salad wasn't very wedge-shaped and not very cold.  At least I didn't find the lettuce core that I kept expecting. Now for the bad part.  I had to send back the baked potato - it wasn't warm enough to melt butter, let alone steaming like it should be.  The waitress was nice, and apologetic, and brought me another one that was hot - on the outside.  The middle was lukewarm. I sent that one back, too.  Considering that a baked potato will stay hot inside for hours if you don't cut it open, this is just embarrassing. Final score: Kid's spaghetti:  he liked it.  Beer: quite good Wedge salad: meh.  Rib eye steak:  good.  Baked potato:  the third one was fine.  Going back?  Probably not for food."
Eve K.,"Antioch, CA",8,8,,4.0,10/13/2012,"I love the avocado eggrolls! The pizza and beers good too.  The service is slow at times, but at lunch time it doesn't seem as bad."
Chrissie G.,"Antioch, CA",71,127,82,3.0,7/13/2013,"Though their service will prolly never improve, my husband loves going here because he enjoys their Jerimiah Red beer and loves to try their seasonal ones also. And you can't g wrong with their Bjs favorite pizza and their new chicken bacon pizza also! The hubs loves their enchilada soup. its different from Chillis where they bring the soup base out to the table and they pour it infront of you in the bowl with the chicken and tomatoes in the middle of the bowl. I also had their caprese salad! yumm lil mozerella balls. hahah Can't leave w out their pazookie!"
Jessica H.,"South San Francisco, CA",24,9,2,1.0,10/4/2012,"Absolutely the worst waitress ever! RUDE, extremely SLOW, and major ATTITUDE!  On 10/02/2012 , Me and my sister and brothers went to eat at Bj's to celebrate after playing bingo. We were greeted by an extremely nice hostess that took us right away to our table. She chatted with us for a few minutes and left us with menus. That is where the service ""STOPPED"". We waited some time not knowing who our server was because no one came to the table for quite sometime. ( mind you we were the only table in the section) after about 10 min the waitress appeared out of no where to take our drink order. She seemed stressed out and short with words. No apology for the wait. After 20 more minutes of waiting for (just beer) no fancy drinks she popped up again and began to set the drinks down so hard beer was spilling. She walked away with out asking if we were ready to order. Going on 30+ mins already 2 more party's were set in her section.  She immediately helped them taking drink orders. My sister had to shout to her that we were ready to order. She ""sighed"" loudly and came to our table. She took the order and we asked to order more drinks and she said ill be right back. She never came back. My boyfriend and brother had to get up and go to the bar and order the second round or drinks... ""ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE"" . We waited and waited"
Brad H.,"Stockton, CA",53,176,29,2.0,9/9/2012,"This was my third and final visit to this establishment. Nothing major that triggered this, just a series of less than stellar visits.  Last night 9/8/12 we went in around 9PM. It was nice that we were seated right away with no wait. Took quite some time to get drinks and orders in. The waitress did not want to wait for us to order and insisted on coming back. Keeping in mind a deaf friend was with us and may take an extra minute to order and verify. She was not having this. So eventually we ordered our drinks and appetizer. A little while later she takes the dinner order. Twenty minutes later dinner comes out. We were somewhat surprised as the appetizer had not arrived.... we figured she never put it in. Half way through our meal the appetizer comes out. Keeping in mind it was simple chips and spinach dip..... The chips and dip was HOT. It had been sitting under a heat lamp for some time. The dip was so hot it started to crust on the sides of the dish and was too hot to eat. Add that to the lack of refills and it just made for a less than stellar experience for the price. On a plus side, the cajun chicken pasta (ordered extra spicy) was very good.  Next time I'll head over to Mel's and get a better meal, quicker and cheaper."
Theresa H.,"Oakley, CA",7,36,30,1.0,11/4/2013,Was thinking perhaps since it's been a year and a half things may have changed.....after reading current reviews I see it's still the MESS it was when we tried BJ's in Brentwood. Guess if you want a good beer this is the place to go....unless of course the COOLER isn't working LOL Down to 2.5 Stars I will pass
Jennifer D.,"Alameda, CA",506,1721,81,3.0,6/3/2013,"Being a chain, the food is exactly what you'd expect.  This seems to be one of THE places to get dressed up and go to on a Friday night in Brentwood.  The drawback was when they tried to fit a party of 30 people onto a table set for 20.  We managed to get situated eventually, and while it took a little while to recover from that and get going with drinks, menus, and place settings, we were all fed and watered to our satisfaction.  It was fine."
David M.,"Brentwood, CA",73,27,3,2.0,10/17/2011,"So I'm changing my 5 star review to a 2 star review after my latest visit.  Not because of food quality but because of the service of the hostess in our visit this evening.  We showed up just before 9pm on a Monday night.  Waited about 5-7 minutes in the lobby because there was no hostess.  At least 5 servers walked by and looked at us, but nobody even said hello.  After a line had built up of people behind us, a hostess came out of the kitchen and told us all there was a 10-15 minute wait for a table and that we should have a seat in the lobby then promptly disappeared back into the kitchen. THE RESTAURANT HAD 40 EMPTY TABLES!!! We had a baby and grandma, we weren't going to sit in an uncomfortable lobby while the hostess went to flirt with the cook or work on her side-work so she could go home.  We came to have dinner and give the restaurant our money. We promptly turned around and left, Red Robin next door was more than happy to take our money and treat us like customers.  I have friends who work there or I would have changed the review to a 1-star.  Next time it better be improved experience or we will not only never come back, but recommend our friends never come back. Very disappointed. ---------------- First time visitor, thought we'd give it a try when it wasn't busy (ie: 2pm on a Monday).  Dude behind the host stand wearing all black was clearly busy with something and didn't even look up.  ""Stand over here and I'll get you seated right away"" he said in a monotone busy voice where someone else took over and guided us to our seats.  Not the best first impression, but that's when the tide turned.  When our server (Alicia) stepped up (like 2 seconds later) I swear we stepped off the rainbow into ""nobody gets treated this well-fantasyland"". The decor was awesome, sure it's new but... it was just awesome!   The bar is gorgeous, giant TV's everywhere that you can see from any seat in the joint.  The menu was a little big, but everything on it looked great.  I ordered a nutty something or other beer (which was tasty) and my girlfriend got Iced Tea.  We got the stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer and were very pleased.   She got Chicken Alfredo, I got the Jumbalaya.  I'm a native of Louisiana and thought this was very good.  Not as good as mine, but one of the best I've had at a restaurant in California. The use of cayenne was perfect, it will heat you up for sure.  (And I grow ghost chili's... I love heat!) I ordered a ""Buffalo Bite"" with dinner which is a black n tan style stout / raspberry bliss in a glass.  For $5.25 it is heaven in a glass. To finish the review, the bathrooms were spectacularly clean and modern.  The decor, the privacy, the cleanliness, everything was awesome.  One of the best restaurant experiences I've had in Brentwood in a long time.  I am sooooo happy that we went.  I am typically a good tipper, but I left a $15 tip on a $40 tab because I was so happy with the service, the food, and the atmosphere.  If I could give this 10 stars, I would.  Without doubt we will be back and we're bringing friends next time... Cheers! =Dave"
Mel R.,"Antioch, CA",0,8,,2.0,2/28/2015,"Food decent enough that we've gone there for our Christmas party the last two years.  The wait staff also good.  On my most recent visit, however, I ordered a Long Island Ice Tea.  It was easily the worst I've ever had.  While I would go there again for food, I'd never order another drink."
Paula R.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",13,126,20,2.0,7/3/2013,"I'm glad we only walked out of there paying $4. We had a gift card to use so my husband and I had a rare weekday lunch date. We started off with the Avocado egg roll.. I've had much better.  I ordered the half flatbred pizza and salad. It was fair, not out of this world but it was ok. We decided that we would share a mini pazookie. We waited so long for our server, Brittany to return we decided against the dessert as we only had a short amount of time to spend together before we had to pick our son up from school. Along with our gift card I used a $5 off $20 coupon. Our server informed us she had to get her manager because we were using a coupon. I got the coupon from the newspaper. I would be nice if they are putting coupons out there that the servers either know how to process them or allowed to process them without having to get a manager. The food was fair, the waiting sucked."
shannon w.,"Concord, CA",219,6,3,1.0,8/20/2012,Waited two hours to get a seat because they kept delaying our table. Then waited two hours to get our food and they forgot mine. Then waited another hour to actually get my food. Still charged all of us a 17% gratuity... SLOW SLOW SLOW SLOW. I go to culinary school. it seemed liked there was no sense of urgency at all in that kitchen
Nadine S.,"San Ramon, CA",8,13,7,2.0,8/8/2013,"I love BJ's, I go there all the time for dinners, birthdays, other occasions, and sometimes just a quick lunch. But the reason I give this 2 stars is because this particular BJ's I've had bad encounters with. The first time I just brushed it off my shoulder that the service wasn't as great as I've had before. But the second and last time I came in I felt like I was done with this particular BJ's.  We went out for my friends birthday dinner, granted it was an hour before closing time, but Bj's was still open and we did like it there. When we came in we sat by the bar area and as we sat down we immediately felt rushed. Like I said I understand it was late and close to closing time. The server we got, she gave us the menu, and we had literally 5 minutes to think of what to order. She came back asked us if we were ready and we said maybe a few more minutes please. She came back in yes a few minutes and we just did a quick pick since she was rushing us. When we ordered she then said OK just to let you know the kitchen closes at so and so time so if you want to put in other orders you do so at this time. We barely knew what we wanted to begin with. What made me and my friends mad was the fact that when we were eating she kept coming up to our table looking at our plates to see if we were finished, and once I ate pretty much the last grain of rice she took it from the table already. I understand it's getting late and you're closing but technically they still had 10 minutes left till closing. Once she put the bill down she kept repeating, here's the bill when you're ready, here's the bill when you're ready. OK we heard you the first 20 times we see it, were trying to figure out how to pay, relax."
Rick F.,"Concord, CA",10,5,,1.0,2/19/2015,This is my first time back here in a couple years sadly I have to give at least a star. We came in Thursday 2/19 at 10pm. We ended up sitting at the bar area. It took 15 minutes for someone to a knowledge that we even were here. Even though there were waitresses and waiters walking by us. Even the manager walked by to talk to a table and didn't acknowledge other guests. So a server came by named fadie. He stated he would get us menus and be right back. Yeah that was a joke. He never got the menus. My wife had to get up and get them on her own from the front. So we started to look at the menu and decided we needed drinks. No waitress or that server around so my wife got up again and went to the bar. She asked for a beer and water. The bartender had an attitude with her because we were at the table.  Finally fadie came to the table and was how can I help you. I see you got menus. No shit. You could help us by treating us like customers. I told him that he could help us since we got our own menu that you promised and our own drinks. I even told him if he was really going to help or do we need the manager to help us. He took our order at 1022 pm.
Gary S.,"Brentwood, CA",2,2,,1.0,11/9/2013,"If I could give them zero stars I would. Very poor service from the time we sat down until we left. Very disappointing. 10 min wait until we were acknowledge at our table our appetizer came out with our food order, the waiter kept trying to give us the bill before we had a chance to order dessert. The fish and chips did not have any flavor. I blame management for the lack of training to the staff. But not to leave on a negative note, my date was very sexy. That's who get the star for making my time enjoyable"
Cron M.,"Discovery Bay, CA",0,27,,2.0,7/18/2014,"Use to ""live"" at BJ's when they first opened and loved it.  Now they are going downhill fast.  A few of the servers are pretty good if you are lucky to get them.  Otherwise they forget what you ordered, forget to bring you what you ordered.  When I ask for ranch or anything extra I'm almost done with my meal before it arrives.  I sent several dishes back because it looked horrible on the plate, not enough sauce on chicken friend steak because they ran out of sauce.  Shrimp in my artichoke sauce when it wasn't supposed to have shrimp in it because I'm highly allergic to shrimp!  I keep trying to go back and every time I'm disappointed so no more for me.  And we use to go at least 2 times a week.  Now we are Johnny Garlic fans.  Get it together BJ's.  It is nice they stay open late for us late eaters but I'd rather go to Taco Bell then get a bad expensive meal at BJ's."
Ernie S.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",0,18,12,1.0,8/25/2013,"Just moved to Pleasant Hill and was visiting family. Decided BJ's as it was great in Carlsbad. Boy, what a disappointment. Server was clumsy and forgot our orders. They were out of Calamari and egg rolls but never told us. Wedge salad had turned brown inside and was served this way! Gross! Entree was decent. No credit on bill for crap served and Manager ditched us when he came to our table. Never will go to this restaurant again."
Liz O.,"Pittsburg, CA",6,45,3,2.0,2/8/2013,Delicious! Love the flatbread chiken n pesto ..which they have discontinued.. Love the ahepoke and stuffed mushrooms.. Better than. Most I've had.. But they close at 1 am and tonight.. On one of the best nights of my life... They ruined it completely by closing the kitchen early at around 12:20 and giving me a cold flat bread pizza and a mediocre avocado egg rolls.. If you close at 1 am.. You close the kitchen at ONE ...A...M... !!! How dare u take my drink order and then cancel my precious  stuffed mushrooms and Thai lettuce wraps?!?!?.. They're spicy and sweet!!! Cold but hot!?!?!?... I love them and u close the kitchen at 12:20?!?!?!?... Won't be back here.. At least not after 11 pm!... Service is good but times must be consistent!!!
Gina V.,"Antioch, CA",98,17,,1.0,11/15/2012,"My friends and I stopped in on Sunday, Nov. 11.  This was my first time at a BJ's.  There was a little bit of a wait, so we gave our name to the hostess and proceeded to the bar.  After about 25 minutes or so we were seated at our table.  Service SUCKED!!!  No one said ""be right with you nor did anyone ever take our order, even after attempting to tell the 3 other waitresses that kept passing our table that we were ready to order.  I say attempt because all 3 of them, even though looking dead in our faces, did not say a word and just kept walking (can we say BAD TRAINING), so after waiting nearly an hour and being ignored we walked out.  I did call the manager who said he would send a $25 gift card to get me to come back.  But I don't know if I will be going back there.  Maybe another location.  SHAME ON YOU BJ'S IN BRENTWOOD, YOUR WAIT STAFF SUCKS!"
Jazmen G.,"Pittsburg, CA",45,77,93,3.0,7/29/2012,Well 3 stars because my waitress or waiter was very nice the food is a no tho..went here for Sunday brunch the menu literally had 7 items to choose from. Not much for a Sunday brunch the Concord location is more lively food is wayyyyy better...i was expecting a great brunch from here but i was disapointed. I know to stick with El Torritos Sunday brunch
Jay O.,"Los Angeles, CA",17,101,20,4.0,12/22/2012,Great service. The server said they had avocado rolls and minutes went by and no rolls he comes back and said they ran out.  So they give me and my friends a substitute dish and comped it (very nice of them). They have nice beer selection.
