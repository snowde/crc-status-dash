Kerry W.,"Austin, TX",10,58,55,4.0,7/20/2012,"Great restaurant with great food. Our first server was blah so I don't remember his name but when his shift ended,we got Erica. She was great. High energy and Johnny on the spot. Will be back soon!"
Carlos S.,"Brentwood, CA",3,48,51,3.0,2/11/2013,"Good food, ambiance, clean bathrooms, but pricey, not earned. I had the Creole Tilapia, ok, but too hot without the  pepper flavor, so, the extra heat was not appreciated. Tried the fried calamari too. Very good. Drinks were only ok and pricey for their happy hour well drinks."
Jack J.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,15,,1.0,11/17/2013,"Atmosphere OK. Food messed up. Manager incompetent. What happened was my family of five ordered pene pasta - very little sauce (dry), asian burger - no teriyaki sauce, a salmon dish over rice - usually has sauce under the rice (no sauce added), and another noodle dish with wood splinters in it. Asked manager to correct the dishes and he merely responded that's how the cook fixes it. Well, that's the last time we'll eat at BJ's! Is this guy not customer service trained!? Fire him and the head chef! Oh, yah, the manager never even offered to comp, or apologize, just avoided our table all night. This place is going down fast. I've heard from others who commented the same. Best go to Red Robin, at least they get everything right and with a smile!"
Stephanie K.,"Pittsburg, CA",0,8,1,5.0,12/13/2014,"The visit was awesome! Clam chowder is better than pier 39's, the shrimp scampi was excellent and the pizzoli's are the best dessert!!! Our waitress was friendly and attentive. The menu selections are extentive, they have everything! Oh, the beer on tap was so cold and the hefiweisen was creamy and smooth."
Lolita B.,"Antioch, CA",0,3,,1.0,11/13/2013,"I so totally fell in love with their Cheddar Broccoli Soup that I first experienced at the Concord location. I took my daughter out the following weekend to this location and had it been my first I would have absolutely never eaten BJ's again.  1. Table was dirty, the guy cleaned the table and booth seats with the same towel. Gross 2. I needed a refill forever and the waitress had passed me plenty of times. 3. I was served someone else's food.  4. When served the right food I had no silverware.  - Finally! The server who brought my food out asked if I cared for a refill. 5. My soup was terrible. Not thick and creamy at all. Tasted more like chicken broth which I assume was the oil looking substance floating atop the cheesy mushed broccoli.  6. Had to flag the server down for my bill and a to go container, as my daughter didn't eat her food either. Absolutely would never visit this location again unless I see an ""Under New Management"" sign and would definitely make sure they had new cooks as well."
Cvj C.,"Brentwood, CA",0,1,,2.0,11/9/2013,"35 minute wait (for food) was a bit too long... . mediocre at best. Nice effort by staff but still a dressed up chain concept without much  creativity.  Basically a Chili's/Applebees/Cheescake factory etc... They may have beer  labeled  for them but definitely not a brewhouse.  To be fair, I am not a fan of mall locations that rely on the captive audience and heavy traffic of large commercial areas. Could not survive on it's own merits as an independent restaurant . A reliable option for hungry shoppers,  but not a choice I would recommend as a destination or special occasion restaurant."
Craig N.,"Pittsburg, CA",88,55,1,2.0,3/7/2013,The service after you order is slow and they constantly make mistakes on the order...our don't have some of the ingredients...I think this may be the last time we are here...
Early L.,"Danville, CA",13,53,18,2.0,2/23/2013,Our  server is great but it takes a long time to be served. Don't know if we come at the wrong time or if they are understaffed. What we ordered wasn't right. Let's hope they get the flow working right.
Margie P.,"Discovery Bay, CA",21,59,2,4.0,5/12/2012,"I was taken here for an early Mother's Day lunch, today, by two of my kids.  We were seated promptly, the booth was very comfortable, they took our drink orders right away, and left us to peruse the ridiculously large menu.   The service was very good, and the food and drinks were brought out at just the right timing.  I ordered the Enlighted Chicken Thai Mango Salad, or something like that.  It was very good, I would order it again.   My daughter had a mini Buffalo Chicken Pizza, which she shared with me.  It was really good. My son ordered a caeser salad and spaghetti with chicken and garlic bread.  I didn't taste his, but he seemed to enjoy it.  We had a Pizooki Trio for dessert and after tasting all three we all chose our favorite to finish off.  Delicious. I don't know why there are so many negative reviews.  The service was very good and the food was delicious and fresh. I will definitely be back."
Tom A.,"Brentwood, CA",3,12,,2.0,9/16/2012,service was ok we waited awhile to receive our food but it didnt bother us because we came with friends to have drinks first. we ordered a deep dish pizza and it was not very good at all. The pizza had very little sauce or toppings it was mostly bread.
Marc G.,"Antioch, CA",0,5,,1.0,9/23/2013,"When they first opened, the food was good and the service was great.  There was either a change of management or all the good people have found better jobs because I was there twice last month and the food and service sucked!  What happened?!!"
Woze Z.,"Oakley, CA",20,24,35,4.0,10/29/2012,"Great food, great service but most of all... great beer. My wife & I found BJ's to be a fun place to watch the Giants sweep the Tigers in the World Series too. We even had our waitress from a previous visit stop by just to say hi. On our visits we've always found the staff to be very friendly & I'm at a loss as to why there are a number of reviews stating poor service."
Chris C.,"Oakley, CA",36,15,1,1.0,1/31/2014,"Awful service (45 minute wait for appetizers), the only thing not microwaved is the salad. Better options in the same area."
Megan W.,"Walnut Creek, CA",68,132,192,5.0,10/10/2012,Stopped in with my Mom for lunch because I know this place has plenty of Low Carb options.  We've been to the one in Concord and the service there is horrific but this place was amazing!! Our server Joe was extremely helpful and fast. The food was top notch and the restaurant was clean. I cant figure out why it has such a low rating. I would make the drive all the way out here just to avoid the concord one.
Wendy K.,"Brentwood, CA",1,4,,2.0,4/22/2013,"Restaurants in Brentwood are particularly poor on service. BJ's is no exception as they have always provide extremely slow service with luke warm food that has likely been sitting under the heat lamps for a long time.  The wait staff and management are friendly but seem to disappear for long periods of time.  I have not had such continual bad service at other BJ's across the bay area, and had originally looked forward to them opening here in Brentwood.  They need to up their game, although they are one of the few 'games' in town, unfortunately."
Peggy S.,"Dixon, CA",0,7,,2.0,10/23/2014,"Met friends at BJ's in Brentwood for a late lunch. Service was slow. Water tasted musty, not really drinkable. Ordered the Asian Salad, which is a favorite of mine that I order when I eat at BJ's. They've changed the recipe, I won't order it again. I've eaten at other BJ's and have enjoyed my meal. This one disappointed me and my friends who were eating there for the first time."
Charlene P.,"Discovery Bay, CA",13,10,,1.0,12/17/2011,"We went here on a Sunday night around 7 with some friends. I was impressed by the decor and atmosphere but that was short lived! Our waitress was not good at all! Our friend had ordered soup and salad for her entree and it was brought out way before anything else. We had to keep asking for refills for the children. Not to mention I left still hungry! I ordered a salad for my entree and was very surprised how small the portion was, about the same size as a dinner salad. My husband ordered a rib eye steak, which we found out about 10 min after ordering that they were out of it!! So he settled for a new york cut. Once again the portion size was ridiculous! For what you are paying you would think you would at least leave full. Not the case here, would not recommend this place to anyone!"
R H.,"Antioch, CA",13,54,5,4.0,1/28/2013,"BJ's Always good food and plenty of it, we had the nachos, chile burger and also the chicken fried steak, all good eats and more then enough to take some home. I like and brew beer so I always tried the the available beers which are always good. This time I especially liked their stout. Seated quickly and service was  good, fast, restaurant was busy and a bit noisy, expected given the crowd. All patrons appeared to be having fun and enjoying their meals and company."
Alexandra T.,"Sacramento, CA",21,13,7,2.0,5/1/2012,"Although the food was pretty tasty, the service was horrible.  They brought the salad.  And when I was still eating it, they brought the appetizers (spinach stuffed mushrooms) They apparently ran out of lemons for my tea.  The silverware was not clean, even when we asked for a new set.  My husband wondered if they had pie for dessert and the waitress said with attitude, ""No, this isn't Marie Calendar's!""  For two of us the bill came to over $50 for lunch and we didn't have any alcohol.  The waitress forgot to bring us items and we had to remind her.  She rushed us by trying to take the plate away when we were still eating.  It made our experience such a hassle.  We love the place in Concord, but this new onein Brentwood sucks.  We don't plan on going back."
Mary E.,"Martinez, CA",3,120,4,3.0,1/24/2013,"Service is hit and miss but the food and drinks are always good.   A bit overpriced on some of the cocktails.   Wait time on weekends is long since there are only a few decent restaurant choices in the area.  Lunch specials and happy hour are best times to stop in.  And if the wait is too long just go next door to Red Robin, similar food and rarely a wait."
