Kim S.,"Antioch, CA",36,56,10,1.0,11/4/2011,"They need more time to figure out scheduling and such.  Our party of four went in on a Sunday...the bar was full, lots of employees working, however we never got our order.  We finally walked out after waiting for 30 minutes.  Very loud in there so if you're looking for some peace and quiet, you might want to pick another spot.  I think that it has great potential, but the staff needs more training."
Celine D.,"Oakley, CA",1,17,,5.0,7/15/2013,"Came and sat in the bar Friday and experienced fantastic service from SHAWN. Great beer, happy hour menu, very clean bar, perfect. Very organized and professional! Will be back soon... Thanks so much for a great night out."
Gef J.,"Walnut Creek, CA",1,56,66,4.0,3/22/2012,"I have been to BJ's all over and was thrilled to see this open last year.  The staff has always been eager to please, the food for us has always been good too.   It is our continual fallback restaurant.  If you can't find anything on the menu you like, you just aren't hungry"
Steve S.,"Discovery Bay, CA",3,51,6,1.0,3/31/2012,"This was my second visit and am not planing on returning anytime soon. Ordered the French dip and frys, dry, cold and took forever to get to the table. We had a group for a friends birthday and seemed the waitress was more concerned about her smoke breaks and putting us off on other service staff. Large party = 's free large tip with minimal effort put forward. I feel taken from, hope you got enough this time. No more for you."
Liz J.,"San Francisco, CA",1,28,7,5.0,6/5/2014,the only and best reason to come is Michelle best server ever!!! her attention and service is impeccable from the moment you walk in and leave!
MICHAEL M.,"Brentwood, CA",5,38,5,1.0,9/11/2012,"I have given this place my 3 strike rule. They have horrible customer service, over priced food that is either cold or not what you ordered when it comes out to you. Don't expect your drink order to get back to you for 20 minutes and your food 45-60 minutes. Parking sucks to because they share parking with REI and Red Robbins. In Brentwood we are limited to restruants so they will keep up the crappy service and most of us will be going."
Michael G.,"Concord, CA",0,21,4,2.0,12/16/2011,The food Is good but the service is some of the worst I have experienced. On top of that they served our main dish then our salads and completely forgot the appetizer so they brought it to us after the salad. Our dinner was backwards just like the way the place is being run. Bring ear plugs.
Sarah T.,"Oakley, CA",0,22,,1.0,11/3/2013,"I chose BJs tonight for one of my best friends birthday dinner. There was 12 of us, I requested a table in advance (sunday night). Upon arriving, we were seated shortly and immediately ordered drinks. The four of us, that were at the table first... did not get our drinks (beers) until almost 20 minutes later after everyone was seated. We ordered appetizers, that also took another 30 minutes to come out. Everyones aps and drinks came out at different times. A friend of mine ordered a blue moon. After 15 to 20 mins of wondering where her drink was asked the server why it was taking so long. She then told her that the keg was frozen and she would have to order another drink. The food came out about an hour and a half later. I ordered a steak medium rare that come out completely black. My fiancé did not get his order until the time that everyone else was finished eating. I asked to speak with the manager. She came to the table and I explained the situation. She apologized for the burnt steak and offered to take it off the tab. She also informed us that the fish and chips my finace ordered had not even been put it the cooker. When we got the bill, we had been overcharged by 3 beers. 2 of my friends tabs had additional items they did not order on them. We finally got the bills figured out a long time after. We sat down to eat around 5:45 and did not get the bill until 9. Not only did this ruin the birthday dinner we had planned, but it completely frustrated every guest at the table. I will definitely not be returning to Bjs ever. Worst service I have ever experienced.  I was hoping the manager would comp us the meals that were over 30 minutes late, but it did not happen. We paid in full with gratuity included for our horrible waitress.  VERY disappointing One other major issue: the water tasted like dirt water from the delta."
MICHAEL S.,"Antioch, CA",0,19,,2.0,3/25/2012,Just above average food but the biggest turn off was the acoustics.  This place is LOUD inside.  The cafeteria design and big crowd's ensure that you cannot hold a conversation at your own table.
Tim H.,"Antioch, CA",1,10,,4.0,7/19/2014,"been meaning to write this review. loved the waitress and hostess. they were all great walking in. food was a bit bland and over priced. for that, 4 stars."
G D.,"Pittsburg, CA",1,18,,5.0,5/3/2013,"My first experience with BJ's was the Pleasant Hill franchise and it seemed like a bad nightmare.   Not very clean and the service was lousy, so I went to this one in Brentwood figuring more of the same.   I was very wrong.  Excellent food, clean, great service and even though we have had to wait for a table, it has been always been better than the last time we went there."
M W.,"Oakley, CA",55,5,,1.0,11/9/2013,"After deciding to give them one more chance, wtf was I thinking! I would give them 0 stars if that was an option.  I feel that a portion of the wait staff training must include how to apologize profusely about the slow kitchen/bar and not give anything away to the customer.  Last time I submitted comments on the website about the horrid service and received a call from the manager - weeks later - her voice mail on my phone sounded accusatory - I think I am completely done with this place! Bad service, mediocre food, the beer is amazing but not so amazing as to make it worth the wait!"
Lisa L.,"San Leandro, CA",139,26,12,2.0,7/14/2012,"2 stars  one for our server alicia because she was awesome! if the review was based only her performance then id give it 5.  hands down. she knows her job. but the food? discusting. ive been to bjs before usually the one in fremont but im out here for work and it was my friends birthday and she wanted bjs so we all came in...a party of 8.we called 30 mins ahead got there and then had a 30 wait time. 4 of us had pasta ..the alfredo noodles werent cooked all the way. They were even too hard to be considered al dente. and the scampi was flavorless no matter how much salt i added. So i asked for some sauce to throw on it and it was alright but not really edible. After having a few bites my stomach started to hurt and thats when i stopped. gross .. pros? Alicia was kind enough to remove the pastas from our bill since we hardely touched them.  military discount the pazooki? however the hell you spell it was delicious lol the manager did come by the table and asked about the food, i think thats good cause shes getting actual feedback she was very attentive and checked on us often. my friends loved their mixed drinks  cons? food was gross. undercooked and favorless cant walk on their damn floor with heels on lol would i dine at this bjs again? No. id probably hop over to one of the many other resturants in the area.."
Jenelle A.,"Antioch, CA",4,27,,4.0,8/19/2012,"I've been here a lot and I usually go during off-peak hours because I don't like to wait to eat, haha. If I'm hungry, I'm hungry. I've always had really nice servers and the full size salads are delicious. The giant baked potato is good but always leaves a little something to be desired, perhaps more veggies but I did get the one with chicken rather than the vegetable one. My choice. I like the cocktails and the mocktails on the days when I have to go to work and I always have food left over to eat later which is always a plus.  It can get a little a loud because there are a lot of tv screens and I think the materials used in the restaurant promote a bit of echo. If you go during prime time be prepared to wait. They seem to fill up quickly and I suppose they may not always have the staff to handle the crowd.  Overall: -nice servers -good food & drinks -I've never been disappointed."
Carmen J.,"Brentwood, CA",0,4,,1.0,10/20/2011,"Went to the Brentwood BJ's for the first time last Sunday around 7pm. Told it would be a 20 min wait and it was 40+ mins. Sat on the patio which was nice as the inside was way too noisy. We ordered a beer each and my husbands came in a cold glass but the beer was warm and both were not even filled to the top of the glass. My husband ordered a hamburger and I the cobb salad. The buger was ordered medium and came out well, but after saying somthing about the warm beer my husband didnt want to complain anymore. My salad was boring, the lettuce was some finely chopped with just a few pieces of diced turkey on it, it was pathetic. Needless to say we wont be back for a while, at least until they work out the opening blues."
C R.,"Brentwood, CA",35,94,72,4.0,6/9/2012,This was our second visit and we sat at the bar. Our server was great. She was quick witted and great at remembering everyone's order . It's a bit pricey but a pretty good atmosphere and they make a mean long island !
Nari M.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",128,67,108,3.0,10/19/2011,"Typical chain restaurant. Could tell off the bat that our server has NEVER served in a restaurant before. Didn't expect much because lets face it people, they JUST opened. Do not ever expect everything to be perfect just because it is a new restaurant. There are definite kinks to be worked out. Basically just a fun place to go to to hang out w/ friends & have some drinks & appetizers. I do LOVE their potato skins though! =)"
Kelli S.,"Discovery Bay, CA",55,230,168,5.0,5/8/2012,"Went here for late lunch mid-week and it was not very crowded or loud. We sat in a very comfortable booth. Great service, speedy and efficient. The oriental chicken salad was amazing. Had the strawberry beignet for dessert, which was also good."
brad a.,"Discovery Bay, CA",0,161,15,5.0,11/13/2011,Michelle was very friendly . She put the Sharks on TV for us   The place was packed.    The food was great.  Glad BJ's came to town.
Kelle S.,"Antioch, CA",13,36,2,4.0,6/20/2012,"Delicious food, yummy beer and fast seating in the bar area. Love this place! So Glad it's finally here!"
