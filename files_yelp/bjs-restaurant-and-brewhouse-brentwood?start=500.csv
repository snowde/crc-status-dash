Andrea C.,"Brentwood, CA",20,70,,2.0,11/29/2011,Went again this weekend because my friend wanted to go. We called ahead told the wait would be 30-45 min. Showed up 35 minutes later and was told they should not have quoted us a time and the wait was currently 45 minutes.  We actually had an experienced waitress.  I ordered soup and salad. They serve their soup in a shallow bowl which is fine but my bowl was chilled! My salad plate however was not. They have been open long enough to not have these issues anymore. I am truely shocked with how they are still busy. And they comp so much food I cannot fathom how they are turning a profit.  Really disapointing.
Brassy 5.,"Chico, CA",0,14,,2.0,1/22/2013,"It's a chain ""brewery"" with a thin veneer or character.   Each time I've gone, the order brought to the table has varied from what was ordered.    The menu is huge with an impressive variety, but I think they'd be better off focusing on a few strong items instead of stocking the freezer with so many selections.   And as far as their brewed specialties ... I've never had one of their beers and thought ... ""That is a damn good brew.""    Its always been ...""Meh"" If you're thinking ... why have I gone back?  I'm asking myself that same question..."
Gorev C.,"Antioch, CA",30,9,1,3.0,7/21/2012,Food is up to standard but service is so slow. We were there a few nights ago on a weekday and it took 20 minutes to get a beer to our table and the place was not even that busy.
Tracy D.,"Oakland, CA",0,1,,2.0,11/28/2011,"Food was good but won't go back. Called to see of we could get a reservation and was told call about 30min before you come and they would put our name in, which we did. Then got there and they said no they didn't hold a spot and it would be 45 minutes. An hour and half later, with a hungry 2 year old, we finally asked them enough times that they have us a table. Service was slow an the place is WAY to loud to have a conversation in."
Trisha B.,"Antioch, CA",1,57,2,2.0,6/25/2012,"This brewery has never let me down until this recent past visit.  Went in for dinner on a Wednesday night and was seated right away with no wait.  After ordering our food, we waited 25 minutes with no contact from our waitress.  As incorrect orders began coming to our table, we mentioned that we didn't even receive our salads yet.  Basically, some of us were eating our appetizer salads while the other half of our party was finishing their entrees.  After speaking with the manager, he comped us one dish off our tab for the inconvenience.  If the waitress would've checked in on us from time to time and our dishes came out together, this visit would've been rated higher."
Karen J.,"Brentwood, CA",4,18,,4.0,3/17/2012,"Very thrilled another good restaurant was added to Brentwood. This one opened last September and seems to always be busy. We have figured out to go a bit earlier so we don't have those hour-long waits. I think the portions are fairly good sized, and while some things are pricey (like the pizza) I think it's mostly competitive. The service is really quite good. At least for us it has been. I have enjoyed the Chicken Southwest salad, a Chicken sandwich that is served with a garlic parmesan spread on the grilled bread (can't remember it's name) and the calamari appetizer is the hubby's favorite. I like the thai chicken won tons. We tried the Pazookie dessert once and it was too sweet for me, my hubby found the Beignet; fried pastry with vanilla ice cream and strawberries... he was in heaven. On the negative- it is WAY too loud in there. I worked concerts for many years so I've heard all kinds of music but when your table can't hear much of the conversation because everyone is talking over the music (which just makes the whole restaurant louder) they should really take notice."
John G.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",0,3,,1.0,11/3/2013,This BJ's sucks...Always has and always will. Do not waste you time our money. Hard to figure out how it is still in business.
Cheryl G.,"Sacramento, CA",146,140,28,3.0,4/2/2012,"Maybe I was a little too giddy by giving them a 4 star review. More like 3 1/2. We came for dinner & my boyfriend ordered a roast beef plate..I think. Portioning was off but our server was super sweet about it. She didn't argue with us like most other places. She agreed with us & was happy to order another one without charging us. I wish I could remember her name because I think we would probably go back just to have her. Asian girl, light brown hair, 20ish, about 5'2, had the prettiest sparkling blue headband. Anyway it was pretty busy when we walked in. I apologize to the hostess ladies because I was a little crazy the last review. Lol..all smiles. Wonderful job."
Vladimir G.,"Roseville, CA",1,3,,1.0,6/15/2014,"So I took my wife and kids for their brunch, we waited for 40 minutes to get powder eggs scramble, and 1.6 pieces of bacon.  My wife ended up having some green stuff stuck under her plate of pancakes so here is what I think. You pizza is good, your beer is good. Stick to what you know, and when I let the manager know all he had to say was let me go tell this to the cook, nicely managed...."
Mindy D.,"Brentwood, CA",1,6,,2.0,7/4/2012,"My husband and I really want to love this place, the food is always good. The service however is really bad! We waited an hour this last time to get our food and the waiter never came by to check on us. When we did get our food, we had no utensils or napkins. My husband had to get up and get some. Both of our forks were dirty!:(  Every time we go to this BJ's the service is slooooow and it's like we're not important. This is our fourth try and I'm afraid our last. We live only 5 minutes away so it  definitely would be a convenient place to take our family and friends when they come to visit, but unfortunately that won't be happening. :("
Byron D.,"Concord, CA",0,9,,1.0,3/11/2013,"My wife and I went to BJ's in Brentwood yesterday, Sunday March 10 for lunch.  My wife and I have been to 6-7 different BJ's, but this was the first time at the Brentwood restaurant.  I have always liked BJ's for their food and especially their beer.  Piranha Pale Ale is my favorite.  My wife ordered a lemon drop martini with Absolute Citron Vodka and I ordered my usual Piranha.  A long time passes before our waitress came back to tell us that they were having a hard time finding the Vodka my wife preferred.  In  the mean time, my Piranha was served and it was warm!!!  I immediately told the waitress that it wasn't drinkable and sent it back.  The manager did come to the table to inform me that the glycol chiller for all the beers on tap had been broken all weekend.  He went on to say that all his waitstaff was instructed to inform their guests of this fact.  The waitress never mentioned this to me and in fact, when she came back to tell me about the problem with the glycol chiller, she had no idea what it was and couldn't even pronounce it correctly.  So, obviously the manager hadn't told at least my waitress that beer would be served warm.  Had I known that the beer would be served warm, we wouldn't have ordered anything, we would have left.      My wife's drink finally did arrive.  I drank water while we ate a flatbread pizza.  The part that really burns by backside, is that BJ's is a brewery and for them to serve warm beer is totally unacceptable.  I know there are refrigeration techs that work on call just for this reason and to be told that the unit had been out all weekend and couldn't be repaired is a bunch of bunk!!!  The manager made no attempt to comp anything about our meal or try to appease my total disappointment. He really didn't seem to care.  More like an ""Oh well"" attitude.  Don't think I'll be going back to that BJ's."
Karen W.,"Antioch, CA",4,1,,1.0,4/24/2012,"I have never been to a Restaurant that assures such negligence with respect to how they operate their business, the fact that I'm not an isolated incident and Andrea S posted a comment on 4/9/2012 three days after I fell simply shows that BJS are not concern with the physical welfare of their customers; as a result I will never patronize this establishment ever again.  I'm truly upset and disappointed at the nonchalant attitude of the Manager Chris.  Thank you BJS for ruining my date night and my recovery after having surgery, your negligence has made my recovery more painful and frustrating.  It's taken me some time to post this comment regarding my experience at BJS Brentwood because I had wrist surgery and I haven't fully healed.  My husband decided to surprise me with date night on 4/6/2012 three weeks after my surgery. I was looking forward to getting out of the house although I had no idea where we were going.  We arrived at BJS Brentwood at 6:50 our reservation was at 7:30.  My husband and I checked in with the hostess at which time she said areyour other guest here,? Which was a surprise to me, my husband had taken the liberty to invite 2 other couples which we hadn't hung out with for a while.  Surprisingly we were able to find two seats at the bar while we waited for the other 2 couples to arrive.  We sat between to other tables; the volume in the restaurant was extremely loud.  However I was excite to be out and about with the prospect of seeing our four friends. The server came over extended pleasantries and ask if were ready to order we ordered from the Happy Hour menu, 2 appetizers a Bud light and a cocktail,15 mins later our food and drinks arrived, I took two sip from my cocktail hadn't yet touch my food and two of our friends Vanessa and Damon had arrived, they came over to where we were exchanged pleasantries, Vanessa went to ask the Hostess how long it would be for our table, just then another friend Stacey walked over to our table and we chatted for about 5 mins.  Vanessa motion to us that our table was ready, the two guest to the left of us said we are just about to leave if you want our table, I said sure thank you.  At this time Damon went to join his wife in the lobby.  Stacy took a seat right next to me to wait for her takeout order.  The two guest to our left said we are leaving shortly if you would like our seats, I said yes thank you so much, I told my husband  I'll let Damon and Vanessa know  to come back to the bar we would be more comfortable rather then have a booth. Case in point:  I made my way through the lobby to the table where Damon and Vanessa had just been seated, I said hey we just got 2 other tables in between us at the bar, lets just sit there; they were rather happy; more room, more space, plus Happy Hour prices.  I turned to walked away a few ft and bang I FELL REALLY HARD ON THE SLIPPERY WAXED HARD WOOD FLOORS; I tried to get up 3 times and kept slipping, I couldn't get any traction, Damon (a few ft behind me) rushed over and tried to help me up, the staff walk all over me and said nothing, next thing I saw our other two guest Kennan an Gina hurrying from the lobby with my husband franticly trailing behind them. I could see and hear the laughter within the dining room. Damon and my husband hoisted me up under my arm pits from the floor OMG babe are you ok?  I couldn't answer fast enough, as I tried to stand I felt the pain in my left knee throbbing; I said honey it hurts when I stand on my left knee, they assisted me over to the table in the Bar.  Reka our server seemed very concern she said OMG are you ok I'm so sorry, I couldn't speak, I'll get a Manager, the volume and the commotion at table was loud everyone was trying to make sure I was ok, my husband looked worried and was really up set, he said I was watching you walk back towards me and next thing I didn't see you, it was like you slip on a banana peel or something.   Manager: About a min or so Chris came to the table identified himself are you ok, I said I fell really hard 4 times, I don't know my left knee is throbbing, Stacy, Vanessa and Damon chimed in those floors are really slippery, (Vanessa I slip when the hostess was walking my husband & I to our table, if I hadn't grabbed onto the hostess that would have been me on the floor, Stacy I've been here several times and I almost slip on those HW floors.  Manager I'm sorry Mrs. Wright can I get you anything, call and Ambulance I said no I don't want to be more humiliated anymore than I already have been, He said have you had anything to drink, I said no we just sat down 15 mines ago, I took 1 or 2 sip from my cocktail its still full, the two guest to the right said they just got their food drinks, We have been here before and I have seen other people slip on those HW Floors.  I said to the Manager I'm not an isolated incident (no reply) those floors are very slippery.  He said can I get you some ice, yes please, msg cont:"
Sara A.,"Oakley, CA",0,8,,3.0,8/5/2012,"I like the location but the food is not that great, there are a couple of choices from the menu that I like, the service sucks, not good."
Vickie R.,"Antioch, CA",2,106,,3.0,9/7/2013,"Food was OK. I had a chicken dish and it was good, a large serving, actually better than I expected it to be. Husband had the sliders and he said he likes Chili's better. These were OK but they were kind of dry and had no cheese. one of our daughters had a Cobb salad. She liked it. Another one had tilapia off the light menu. She said it was very good but it was also a very small portion. I ordered a dinner salad and it was really sad. All it was, was some chopped up head lettuce and a few croutons. I actually sent it back because I hate head lettuce. I expected for the price it would be a nice mixed green salad with Possibly some tomato, cucumber or other veggies on it. Overall the food is pretty good though. the only thing  really unpleasant was the noise level in this restaurant. It was so loud in there we couldn't talk to each other, we couldn't hear each other and we couldn't hear the waiter. He had to really yell  over the noise to be heard. It seems as if they cater to the bar crowd. Just too noisy to have a nice family meal or to be with friends."
Wellie T.,"Brentwood, CA",45,14,,2.0,6/14/2013,"Five of us went to BJ's to celebrate my daughter's 19th birthday this past Thursday. We called and got on the call-ahead list. Arrived at the restaurant and then waited 45 minutes to be seated. There were lots of empty tables around the restaurant. Our waiter showed up about 10 minutes later to take our drink and app orders. Then, we waited 45 minutes for the drinks to arrive and the drinks were wrong. One person ordered a Pepsi with no ice. The person who ordered a black cherry soda received their drink with no ice, as did the person who ordered the Pepsi. Another person in our party ordered regular lemonade but received a strawberry lemonade that she described as ""chunky"". I personally ordered a Diet Pepsi, which I normally drink on a regular basis. It was flat and tasted like expired Diet Coke. We didn't see our waiter again until our dinners arrived, about half an our later, with our appetizers. Appetizers should come out before any main course is served. Everything came out together. There are RAVE reviews about the avocado rolls but ours were super bland and were literally avocados inside a roll. No sun-dried tomatoes, no pine nuts, no cilantro (except the pinch that was dribbled on the plate). Blech! I ordered the chicken wontons buffalo style (which comes with celery sticks and bleu cheese) and it didn't come with celery sticks or bleu cheese. We also ordered the mushrooms and the reason I gave two stars was for the mushrooms. They were phenomenal. They were the only thing that was phenomenal or had any taste at all. For my entree, I ordered the Santa Fe Salad with Cajun shrimp. I've never tasted a more bland salad in my life. I was sitting there looking right at the shrimp, half of which seemed to be slathered in seasoning and the other half completely void of seasoning. Despite the apparent over seasoning of some of the shrimp, there was no kick, spice or taste to any of it. If you're going to name something ""Cajun"" it better have some spice to it! My daughter had the Reuben which she did like...but she is also a french fry addict and after a handful said they were the worst fries ever and didn't eat anymore. We ordered pizookies for dessert and again, the waiter got our orders wrong. The pizookies were good...you can't really go wrong with ice-cream on top of a cookie...but we all ordered different ones and the wrong ones were brought out. Every time he got something wrong (I lost count) I didn't say anything because it had taken so long to get anything to begin with, I could only imagine if he'd had to correct something. We'd probably still be sitting there. The kicker was that I told our waiter it was my daughter's birthday and I don't know if they don't do anything for birthdays there, but he brought out her pizookie with a candle on it and that was it. Big freaking whoop. All that aside, and the waiter screwing up our orders, etc. the reason I won't go here again is because the food is total crap. Boring, cold, bland, unseasoned, and just all together tasteless. I am actually writing this review the next afternoon because I took most of my salad home to have for lunch today. I honestly thought that maybe I was just having a bad taste bud night (LOL) and gave the salad another shot this afternoon. Nope. Nothing. I honestly feel like I just ate soggy cardboard. I will say though, in comparison to most other places, they give you a TON of shrimp...which would be completely awesome if it had tasted like anything. Hey Gordon Ramsey...come and clean this place up! It has such potential with a HUGE menu of unique items but everything sucked! Do not recommend."
P S.,"Albany, CA",0,30,,1.0,7/4/2012,"We've been here a few times. The first time was a good experienced, the rest were just terrible! The staff just don't bother to check on you, the calamari appetizer was served to us one day almost burned and just a handful on a plate!!! The food are the same way, different all the time, some times good and most bad. We will not be back. There are other great restaurants here in Brentwood to try."
Alicia N.,"Antioch, CA",0,3,,2.0,3/24/2014,"Went here on a Sunday at 5 and waited for a booth that was already empty when I came in. The wait was so long and what I mean by that is: I waited 20 mins for my family's drinks, another fifteen for my appetizer which I had order at the same time for my drinks, another 20 for my meal then after eating for fifteen mins ordered dessert waited there for another 15 and I was like the whole time "" where is my food, it is taking to long"". Differently not going here again. The food is just ok, I can cook better things by myself."
Danielle G.,"Byron, CA",17,34,,5.0,10/8/2013,The food is amazing here but the REAL GEM HERE IS ALICIA !!!!  What an outstanding server and so knowledgeable of the menu items and her recommendations are spot on !!    She is super friendly courteous and just well all around amazing server ever!   WE only now sit in her section and will call in advance to make sure she is working!  This is not just a job for her .... the world needs more people like her whom love there job and people!  There are two Alicia's here at BJ's we found out and the other one is not anywhere near as good as ALICIA Z... I don't want to put out her entire last name here because of privacy for her but rest assured if you ask for ALICIA Z you will have the best service ever!! Be sure to try her version of the Mahi mahi tacos !! We are trying to figure out why she isn't a manager there as we really thought the first few times we went in that she had to be some kind of management ... !!!   You will never be disappointed in your visit with Alicia Z at this BJ's !!! Danielle
Julie A.,"Oakley, CA",124,16,16,1.0,10/4/2013,"I have had good experiences at BJ's in other parts of the Bay Area however I do not recommend this particular restaurant. I went there a month ago for a birthday dinner with friends. The service was slow, we waited over an hour for food. Then as we were served dishes, I ordered one of their salads, I was disgusted as my hands grabbed the dish and discovered that the dish was coated and dirty on the outside. Multiple people at the table had dirty dishes as well. We asked for new dishes, yet even the new dishes were still dirty."
Allison C.,"Antioch, CA",0,3,,1.0,5/12/2012,"Just tried this place for the second time and disappointed for the second time. Once again the service was very slow! The waiter was nice and apologized a lot so I'm thinking that the problems lay with the cooks? My chicken Parmesan was awful. It was drowning in cheese and the spaghetti was watery. My mother ordered a pot roast sandwich and there was little meat and a ton of mashed potatoes...and the veggies were uncooked slices of onion and celery...not appetizing.  Anyway, we won't be going back there."
