Chris R.,"Oakland, CA",34,5,,2.0,1/15/2012,"My review is much like most the ones I've read on this location. The food was fantastic but the service left much to be desired. Slow service the whole time, bringing  us items out of order and then to top it off, They brought me the wrong check in the end and the took 10 plus mins to bring me my change. Needless to say I didn't feel bad about leaving a small tip. Next time I'll just order take out,"
Lady S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,29,,2.0,1/3/2014,"This place is ok for breakfast and lunch if you just want a mediocre meal, but not dinner.  There's nothing special about it at all.  I don't like the dinner options in their menu and they haven't changed it in a very long time.  The Pizooki's are WAY to sweet, so you can't even enjoy them.  BUT, what really drives me crazy is their service.  It takes forever to get drinks and appetizers EVERY time we go.  It doesn't even matter if the place isn't packed b/c they still take way too long.  Also, their waitresses don't understand how nasty it is that you're sick and rubbing your nose while taking our order.  Really?  I don't plan on going back here anymore.  We've given them enough chances.  The two stars is ONLY for their pizza."
T O.,"Oakley, CA",0,26,1,5.0,10/18/2011,I am so excited for something like this to come to brentwood! I have been here several times since they opened and each time gets better! Everyone who works here is super nice and attentive! The decor is really nice and the Bar and all the TV's are awesome!
Dan M.,"Oakley, CA",0,9,,1.0,10/13/2013,Disappointed again.......the only reason i can go to this location is the beer selection. Party of four and it took twenty minutes to pull four beers. Pizza was like a five dollar cardboard cut out. Chili's just needs to get more than five taps and this place would fold.
Audra B.,"Antioch, CA",11,38,4,2.0,8/15/2013,"I was disappointed, I really was hoping we would get some good restaurants out here and they would stick. The first time we went to BJ's it was about three weeks after they opened and it was really good. Great atmosphere, good service and fun. Well we didn't go back for a while cause we don't eat out much. We'll we decided to go to BJ's for a celebration dinner and I tell you I have ever been so disappointed. The food was not goo, it was just temped not very warm. The drink I had was so watered down, for a $8.00 margarita it better be good, it wasn't and the service was terrible. Well ok so four month later we tried it once more cause a friend wanted to. I thought I would give it one more chance. Yet again the same thing. My friend ordered an Arnold Palmer (half ice tea half lemonade)  it tasted like watered down ice tea. Again, the food was temped the service was horrible, we ordered fish without the sauce, they put sauce on it, the meals were tiny for the price. Well they lost my business. I can't give them another chance for the money. Sorry BJ's. Now the one in concord is delicious, too bad we can't get anything good out here!"
Jerry H.,"Antioch, CA",0,6,1,3.0,11/27/2011,This is a fairly new location. We have been to it twice now. Food is ok. It is extremely noisy. It is very hard to hold a conversation in your booth. The service is very slow. Today the server took our drink orders and then disappeared for well over 10 minutes. We were just getting up to actually walk out and go elsewhere when he finally came back to take food orders. The Nutty Brewnette brown beer is very good.
John S.,"Brentwood, CA",1,12,,1.0,2/9/2014,Sunday at noon. Took an hour for food to come. Waiter appologized but kitchen was ridiculously slow.
Concerned P.,"Antioch, CA",1,21,1,5.0,1/25/2014,Chris Snider is THE best waiter at this restaurant he is personable and really gets to know his customers. He is fast with taking your order and always bringing refills before asked. Also the manager Melissa is a very person she is an excellent manager who is concerned about her customers and the experience they have and how she can make it better.
Starla R.,"Oakley, CA",25,18,4,2.0,8/10/2012,"I rrally like Bj's in concord so when I heard my hometown was gettong one I was excited. When they first opened I heard a couple bad reviews but gave them the benefit of the doubt because most restaurants need to work out the kinks the first couple weeks. Well I waited for a month or two later to go but I wasnt impressed. The hostest didnt give me a menu becaus I told her I was going to the bar but there were no menus on the tables in the bar so I had to wait for that ontop of waiting 15 mintutes for my server to even aproach me. When I finally gave her my order I waited yet another 15 minutes just to get my beer. The food took a while too and it was tasty but considering how slow the bar was I was a little peeved. I work in the industry so I know it can get a little crazy but this has happened to me everytime I go. Another thing that really irritated me was how the employees, young waitresses were running around the restaurant. I could tell some of them were off duty but it was really immature. I usually dont like to write negetive reviews, but hey, everyone needs a little constructive critisizm."
Geraldine B.,"Los Gatos, CA",1,10,,1.0,11/13/2013,"My Mom choose to eat here on 11/9/13 @ 5:00 pm.  The music was so loud we asked the server to have the Manager turn it lower.  Drinks were served quickly although after 15 minutes the music continued to blare.  I went to the hostess desk and asked to speak with the Manager.  I was assured the music would be lowered and the Manager even agreed the volume was too loud.  The steak salad I ordered was good, although the steak was cold.  My two dinner companions ordered burgers which were also cold and arrived at the table 45 minutes after we placed our order.  While eating dinner the music was increased to  Club level sound.  Great job Manager.  I will never, ever return to this place of business."
LeAnn G.,"Discovery Bay, CA",0,10,,1.0,9/28/2013,"Wouldn't waist your time or money, starting with the water all the way to every food item on our table was miserably done. My cocktail even had to be sent back as it taste like cleaning product. Please don't waste your hard earned dollars here!"
Moovers Inc. I.,"Pittsburg, CA",130,40,3,1.0,11/3/2013,"Well I really like this place but they are getting worse! The 30 minute wait turned into 45 minutes. No service for 15 minutes longer.....ordered right away and waited the usual 30 minutes. When food arrived we still had no silverware and no one paid attention to us when we asked for it! A host came by and we got her attention and she stated "" I'm just a host and I'll have to get a server"". We were like ""what just happened?"" Long story short management is terrible and they need to get a hold of their staff and quality control!"
Megan M.,"Brentwood, CA",9,44,3,2.0,3/20/2012,"I usually like BJ's and have been to different ones a handful of times, but this does not seem like a good one.  We had an early dinner and while our server was extremely attentive and friendly, the food was not the best.  The food did not seem fresh, the greens on my plate were wilted (maybe it sat under the hot lamp too long, maybe it was old, either way it wasn't good).  The tilapia was under-seasoned & fishy.  My mom had the parmesan crusted chicken.  It was good, but that cheap kind of good because you can taste all the fat in the dish.  The kid burger meat was about the size of a half dollar but 1/2 inch thick and overcooked.  My other son had garlic cheese bread & it came out like crouton sticks, one had about 3 shreds of cheese & was half buttered.  I doubt I will go back.  This is obviously a problem with tuesday management because 1) the food was sent out of the kitchen like that and 2) it was served to our table like that when the food was visibly sub-par.  That means there are no checks & balances for quality and no one feels comfortable saying ""hey, I'm not serving that!"""
Alan J.,"Oakley, CA",14,388,3,1.0,12/4/2011,"OK first thing I should explain is that i have only been to this chain twice (never to return) once in fairfield and now this one. Both of these were the same BAD BAD BAD. First we went to another restaurant and the wait was out the door so my girlfriend say oh lets go there, to BJs. We are going to a movie (in an hour and 15 minutes) so in we go. They seat us right away and this is as good as it gets!! the server shows up and gives us our drinks (this would be the last time we will see him till the next millennium) and we order appetizers. So far so good we get and eat the appetizers (good job or they would have found skeletons by the time we got served) a couple who apparently know the staff well sit down at the next table, order shoot the *&%^ with the waitstaff and take pictures (huh?) we wait for our food, and wait and wait and wait....the couple that sat down 10 minutes after us have eaten, paid and left!!! Now I'm mad. Call the manager who goes to deepest darkest Africa on the big game hunt for our food! He returns (meanwhile we wait and wait) with all the food which was not worth the wait and an excuse (ya this should be good) as to why the other couple have gotten express service. Not buying it guys. The burger that my girlfriend is eating is wrong (not the way she ordered) and basically all they did was try to smile and make excuses. Don't know why its so darned busy, was it just me? They don't like us? Did I used to live next door and they're getting even now? Anyway my advise is avoid this place like the plague, I know I will."
Jennifer J.,"Brentwood, CA",0,4,,3.0,12/19/2013,"just love the ahi  poki and a black and tan!  and for the desert pizouki is awesome. don't go if you're in a hurry, just if you want to enjoy your company."
Rhonda C.,"Brentwood, CA",0,5,,2.0,3/21/2012,"I really love BJ's , but this particular location needs some help...I keep hoping they will get it!  I will keep trying though....."
T D.,"Tracy, CA",0,50,,2.0,12/18/2011,"Had a tough experience last night at BJs Brentwood. Here is how it went down: 4:45 PM- Called to put my name on the list.  Was told 15 minute wait. 5 PM: Arrived, my name is on the list with 7 or 8 parties still in front of me, now told 15-25 minutes 5:25 PM: Finally seated with wife and 2 kids. 5:25 to 5:42- We sit, no one comes to take our drink orders.  Same story at next table over who sat down 5 minutes after us. 5:42- after taking order of a table that came in AFTER we were seated, waitress comes up and asks for our drink order.  We order our pizza as well just in case she never comes back.... On the plus side she is polite and professional.  We ask for 'smiley fries' and fries for the kids- and specifically ask that they come out whenever they are ready, kids are already restless and hungry!  5:55- ask for milk and fries again when my beer and my wifes iced tea show up.  Beer is excellent, as usual (I got the BJs IPA) 6:10: Pizza shows up.  Delicious as usual.  No complaints about the food.  Overall, the food was great.  I am just getting tired of the ordeal it takes to get a slice of that excellent pizza in my hands! A month ago, we went to the Roseville BJs.  After an hour wait, the manager came out, said our order had been lost, and gave us our pizza for free.  We appreciated it, but our kids were not happy.   BJ's has pizza and beer down to a science.  The rest of the operation is haphazard and seems poorly organized.  Getting people in and out should be the goal.  We took up a table for almost an hour.  They should have cycled 2 groups through in that time period."
Jo M.,"Orinda, CA",14,157,12,5.0,10/1/2011,"What we expected from E.J Phair Brewery, Grazie's Grille, we did not get in terms of consistent food and service, HOWEVER,  BJ's really exceeded our expectations.  After a day of shopping, we noted that the restaurant was finally opened and we walked over only to find that there was an hour and a half waiting time.  My husband decided to check out the seating around the bar and we found two open seats.  The waitress/bartender VANESSA was our server.  From the start, she was helpful, made great recommendations, always checked to make sure we didn't need anything and was overall very attentive without being intrusive.  For that matter, the service from everyone that gave us our meal were very polite and had ""great manners"" in the way they dealt with us.  As for the food, I had the ahi poke, fried artichokes, bruchetta, and Caprese salad, all under to Small Bite menu and my husband had New Orleans Jambalaya.  EVERYTHING TASTED GREAT!  Since we loved our food, we decided have dessert and tried BJ's Famous Pizookie, which is a freshly baked white chocolate macadamia nut cookie topped with vanilla bean ice cream.  FANTASTIC!  VANESSA , #36, our waitress in the bar, suggested next time we try the Red Velvet Pizookie.  We will!!  This was such a great dining experience and that is not a normal experience in East County.  We HIGHLY recommend BJ's and expect the level of food and service will be consistent. Thank God we now have a place where service and food is consistent and we can expect it.  We are going back and look forward to our next visit."
Sarah M.,"Danville, CA",5,148,9,1.0,10/26/2011,BAD SERVICE. good food. i cant believe at how bad the service is. its a joke.
David R.,"Galt, CA",2,17,,5.0,2/14/2013,LOVE THIS PLACE! Been here at least 10 times (including once last year when the Giant's beat the A's and again when the 49ers beat the Patriots); I've gotta say that the sports environment is the best that I've found in Brentwood. The food is always great; I love the blackened salmon; any kind of pizza that they serve; the angel hair pasta (AMAZING!); and of course the pizookies are all wonderful. The staff is friendly and courteous and do a good job of getting you what you need without being constantly in your face.
