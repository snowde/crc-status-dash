Lindsey S.,"Discovery Bay, CA",1,8,,3.0,10/15/2012,"Pretty decent place, nothing too special. I went there on my birthday and expected a little extra attention but instead we received a little below to just average service. I would go there again only if I couldn't think of another place I'd rather go."
Amber P.,"Brentwood, CA",0,7,,1.0,1/15/2013,"Went to bj's tonight with my husband and boys, the service was good, the food, awful! Our soups were brought to us cold, my husbands green beans were supposed to be steamed, instead they were raw. And both my son and I ordered two different flavored pazookies and we were informed they were out of both flavors.. Also our ""crispy"" calamari appetizer was more soggy than crispy.. We won't be eating there again..oh, and FYI if u try to make a complaint or comment on their website, forget it.. I think it purposely doesn't take the review, it kept saying over and over again that I typed the wrong Incrytpted letters.. B.S."
Kathy M.,"Burlingame, CA",0,42,1,1.0,7/11/2012,"Waited sooo long for a table,ordered the calamari and it was greasy and burned.Chicken was drrry. Never comin back."
Stephanie S.,"Brentwood, CA",3,18,1,2.0,1/9/2012,"I doubt we will give this restaurant another chance.  The first time we went there was only a month or so after they opened.  Although the food was fabulous, the service was not so great.  I thought perhaps they had new help and/or cooks. They do not take reservations but have a ""wait less"" system where one calls to set a time you and your party will be there.  I called at 4 or so and asked for my name to put on the list for 6 for a party of 4.  We arrived a little later than our friends and the place was just a madhouse. When my friend asked if we were on the wait list, she was told no. I walked in there and found a hostess and asked her what to do to find out if I was on the list and she directed me to a short line.  Thank God it was short! Anyway, I got to the desk and yes, my name WAS on the list and I was told it would be about 30 minutes but we were called within 15. That was nice.  However, it took 45 minutes to get our dinner!  All four of us were hungry and I swear I was ready to walk out of there and go to Mel's Diner (across the parking lot) and get a patty melt.  Again, our food was great but due to the slow service and the noise (get to that in a sec), we won't go back.  The acoustics in this place is a nightmare. It seems that it was purposely designed to increase the people talking.  My husband and I and our friends are all senior citizens with hearing disabilities. It was impossible to have a conversation in there. We had to yell at each other to be heard. NOTE: our waitress told the manager we were unhappy about the wait for our food.  He came to our table, apologized and said our dinner would be discounted.  It was heavily discounted and the only thing that we were charged for was hubby's beer and my friend's soup/salad.  The total came to $24!  That was very nice but as I said above, I doubt we will go back there since the wait less system is lame, the wait for the food is unacceptable and it is too noisy."
Bri-Anna N.,"Martinez, CA",0,4,,2.0,9/3/2012,"So I've been to BJs a few times and have yet to see what's so great about it. Today was probably my last visit there. It was somewhat crowded so we sat in the bar area. As soon as we sat, our server let us know mojitos and martinis were $5 - can't beat that right? Wrong. I got a watermelon mojito - not only did it come out long after all the other drinks, it was one of the worst drinks ever. We ordered stuffed mushrooms which took forever to come out. We finished the mushrooms and then sat, sat, and sat. Server passed multiple times without so much as a glance. After about 35 minutes, we had to ask where our food was. 10 minutes after asking for ETA on entrees, food was brought out. It came out hot and mine was okay (I got the California Burger) but little brother's Chili Cheese Burger was DRY. Overall, very disappointing. If we had not been starving, we could have gone in search of a quicker meal. Service and food - blah. Paying under $40 for a couple drinks, appetizer, and entrees is pretty good but I guess we got what we paid for."
Emma S.,"Concord, CA",0,26,9,1.0,5/29/2012,"This review is for their take-out. Let's just say never again! We had a big order for the family but ordered at 4:30pm (a time where they would be less busy). We ordered 2 sandwiches, 1 burger, 1 salad, and 1 chicken dish. The take-out girl left one of the sandwiches in the heater but luckily I double checked everything before driving off and was able to go back in and recover the missing sandwich. So checking to make sure you have everything is logical but I didn't think of checking to make sure the portion size was correct. I should have taken photos because it was unbelievable how tiny the thai chicken mango salad and chicken a la fresca were! The salad was literally a handful of greens and 3 slices of chicken! Plus the other stuff it comes with but it was amazing how cheap they were on the greens and chicken. The chicken a la fresca was 4 slices of chicken (less than half a chicken breast), skimpy on the vegetables, heavy on the rice, no sauce and no arugula salad mix on top. So I basically paid over $10 for just rice. Don't do take-out! They couldn't even spell my name correctly even after I spelled it out for them. It's only 4 letters, come on!"
Donna B.,"Antioch, CA",0,11,,4.0,11/15/2012,Always a great evening when we come here.  Love the specialty drinks and the food.  A bit on the noisy side but fun!
Marie O.,"Brentwood, CA",2,143,21,1.0,2/2/2014,"This review is a little delayed as we went to BJ's for our Christmas Eve dinner. We ordered a variety of food. Appetizers, steaks and honestly none of us enjoyed our meal. It was a good time only because it was the holiday and everyone was in a festive mood. Besides being disappointed in the food, service was even worse. Our server, seemed to rush us through our ordering and we had to wave him over when we needed drink refills, as he NEVER once came back to our table. We purposely went in for an early dinner so the restaurant was not busy at all. The table next to us was evidently friends of our server because that is where he spent all his time. All his time. Taking pictures for them, going over the drink menu each time he went back to their table. We wanted to try other beers, but again he not once came back to our table. Does BJ's even read these reviews? We will not return. Looking forward to Black Angus opening."
Martina D.,"Brentwood, CA",0,11,,4.0,10/13/2012,"I really like the variety in the menu here. It's a great place for my kids and it's even better for my group of girlfriends with all kinds of picky habits or vegetarian lifestyle. I never go Saturday nights because it's crazy busy and so I really can't complain about any wait time there (lots of other reviews complained about that). The waiters are sometimes great and sometimes just ok but the food comes out consistently tasting great. We LOVE the Ahi Tuna Salad and the stuffed potatoes and the ""small plate"" section is an awesome deal! I'm really glad they decided to built one here in Brentwood!"
Victor W.,"Pittsburg, CA",0,7,,1.0,9/29/2011,"This place is horrible! I just came from there and I never had such slow service and ditsy waitresses before in my life. For one, the portions were A LOT SMALLER than what I would get in Concord. I go to the Bj's at Concord at least once a week with friends and never in my life did I get such small portions of a dish I ordered. It was so tiny! Two, it took them a great while for our food to actually come. Three, our ditsy waitress was horrible as I would try to grab her attention by even putting my glass in the air and looking at her and she'd just look at me and smile. Four, I kept getting the wrong meals at first, then I kept getting the wrong checks. Five. I got there at 2:58, I ordered my meal at 3:01. Although happy hour starts at 3:00 they still charged me for full price. I asked her and she said there was nothing she could do about it even though the check said 3:01!! I asked for the manager but I was being completely ignored. Horrible place, horrible service. I will not be coming back here, and for those who want to try it out. I recommend going to the one in Concord, I've never had a problem with their service. Concord is excellent!"
Michael W.,"Antioch, CA",53,29,3,3.0,11/23/2011,"OK wait at the door, 45 minutes, not too bad considering 6pm on a Saturday. Wait on the food, 45 minutes, not at all what I expected. Although the wait staff was very attentive and i was pleased with the overall service i received after we got in. Yes they have some improving to do but don't we all! I will go here again as we go out to dinner with friends every Saturday night."
Laurie m.,"Discovery Bay, CA",1,23,1,1.0,8/16/2012,Very slow very noisey friend was diabetic got sick from waiting with out food very long wait .Service too slow will not come back!!!!! Mogianeso
Frank H.,"Brentwood, CA",0,61,,4.0,12/12/2011,"I've enjoyed BJ's in Arizona & Concord but this location is too noisy to enjoy a meal.  The food is good if one goes at an off time to avoid the crowds.  As long as they have so many customers that there is a long wait for a table, they will not fix the noise level.  We'd like to dine there but won't until they tone down the noise or have a section without the blaring music."
April L.,"Brentwood, CA",0,15,,3.0,5/30/2012,"So I would have given them two stars but the food was pretty good. I went there on a Monday night, we were seated right away and told our waitress would be right with us. Well she wasnt, it took her about 20mins to come to our table and the place wasnt even busy. When she finally came to our table she took our entire order (drinks and dinner)... our drinks took another 15mins to receive and they were okay. I ordered a margarita but it was pretty weak. By the time we got our food we werent even hungry. Luckily it tasted pretty good. Overall our waitress was rude, the drinks were weak and the food was good. Dont know that I will be going back there anytime soon though."
Jane W.,"Brentwood, CA",0,30,1,3.0,12/28/2011,"This new eatery is popular due to its location in a major shopping mall with a theater.   We've eaten there twice in a month, both times for lunch, and only had a short wait.  Soups are average to unimpressive.  Pizzas are generally good but the dough is puffy meaning there is less of the topping and more of the bread. The service is average to good with an upbeat attitude.   Avoid the flatbread pizza ... I had a half flatbread with a tiny salad which is a lunch special.  I received something the size of about 6 saltine crackers and about that thick with six 1/2"" cubes of chicken, three 1/2"" cubes of avocado, several cubes of tomato and some cheese waved over it.  What did I expect for 600 calories?  Guess I got it although the photo in the menu showed something far more ""generous"".   Only for dieters obviously but a rip-off anyway.   Large menu, special beers, things for kids, and lots of TV screens so sports nuts won't miss a play.  Pre-ordered take-out available too."
Michael R.,"Antioch, CA",1,12,,1.0,3/8/2012,"I've eaten at several BJ's: san jose, walnut creek, fairfield, etc, and found them to be fairly decent, but every time i've been to the Brentwood, CA restaurant, we have a terrible time. My family went out to celebrate my birthday and we were seated immediately. Server was slow to even acknowledge us and ask us for our drink order. this is a wednesday early evening, btw, not a weekend.  Our salads come and the lettuce is the white part we typically remove and throw away, no green, yechhh. Later, everyone gets entrees except for me. I keep nursing my anemic salad waiting for my thai salmon and nothing.  waiter keeps saying, ""it'll be right up...""yadda yadda. My family finishes their meals and are getting ancy to leave when a kitchen hand arrives with a plate of jambalaya that we did not order and our waiter quicly intercepts him and directs him away from us.  FINALLY, my salmon comes and it is a bit overcooked and very dry.  No time to ask for a replacement since we need to get home, i ask waiter for some of the sauce that probably should've been included with the dish, not just in very trace amounts on the rice; this fish is hard to swallow it is so dry.  he takes off, i presume for the kitchen to get the sauce. Later, i hear him chatting with the table next to ours and give him a look like where is my sauce. i have stopped eating otherwise it'll be too late.  he takes off..returns and asks us if we want a refill.  I say, ""you're killing me, where is the sauce i asked for?!""...""oh yeah"", he says and eventually brings it and says he is going on his dinner break.  Finally we get the bill and are astonished at how expensive this mediocre meal was and leave.  before we get home, i look at the receipt and notice we were charged an extra $15.50 for a jambalaya. I now believe the little punk ordered his dinner on our bill and didnt think we would notice. I drove back and it took awhile for a manager type to make it up to the front and he credited me the $15.50.  We could've had a better time elsewhere and saved our money. People, check your bill carefully...maybe this is some sort of scam; he could've been feeding his friends or something."
Ashley S.,"Brentwood, CA",131,3,,5.0,2/1/2012,We would definitely return to BJ's.  The Bartender's were attentive and the timing of lunch was leisurely.  The California and Classic Burger were delicious and were loaded with fresh produce.
Martin B.,"Concord, CA",0,5,,1.0,8/21/2013,"Worst service ever had at a restaurant hands down. For the record I love bj's and have been to many of them but I will never go back to this one.  The server said it was her first week so I'll give her the benefit of the doubt, but we sat for 10 minutes and had to ask her where our server was, she said I'll find them. She ended up being our server. Seemed like no organization, the servers were running all over the place but yet everything took forever and was messed up. The manager finally came over to kind of apologize because one of our plates came out wrong and took too long to get right that we said forget it just bring the check.  Then the check took at least 10 minutes.  The manager was the worst he didn't offer anything to try and fix anything I'm not asking for a free meal for 6 people but make an effort to do something right. Until they get a new manager I would recommend to stay away because he seems to be the problem."
Michael L.,"Brentwood, CA",0,5,,3.0,11/17/2011,Visited this place for the first time tonight.  We are not beer drinkers..ordered a nice bottle of wine.  The person taking our order did not open the wine.  Another person did that job...she just pulled the cork through the metal cap.  She then poured the wine over the metal cap.  This was a warning...I think I should order beer in this place.  The food was ok.  Wife had pasta with meatballs.  Pasta was clumped...stuck together and the pasta sauce was sweet.  I had the Texas Chicken Fried Steak.  It tasted good...veggies were just warm.  Noise level was very high.
Kenneth C.,"Brentwood, CA",151,15,,4.0,9/30/2011,"I was really excited when I found out that BJ's was coming to Brentwood. It seemed like it was up and running very quick too, I went there yesterday for lunch with some friends and it was packed! There must have been 30 servers working and every table was filled but believe it or not we were sat down immediately. Although the service was pretty slow it was kind of expected because ever one knows the first two weeks a new restaurant  opens your going to have some kinks that need to be worked out. Needless to say I see this BJ's coming together in the near future and being the most popular place to eat. They have so much food to choose from and there selection of beer is very nice (I love beer lol), being that it is a chain restaurant I wasn't surprised by anything, I think BJ's ambiance is outstanding especially the way there bar is set up and the vaulted ceilings and huge paintings give it a nice touch! I had the fish taco's and they were delicious, the service was kind of slow but the food was worth it and its the first week give them a break people. I see my self being a frequent customer to this place and I recommend that everyone checks it out. Don't forget to save room for dessert, there pazookis are the bomb!!!!!!!!"
