william m.,"San Francisco, CA",0,9,,4.0,9/30/2011,Just about what I expected.  I've been to the San Bruno BJ's several times.  I ordered the Irish Float (two thumbs way up) and appetizers.  Service was fairly quick and the portions seemed to be more generous than the ones I'm used to in San Bruno  Great atmosphere with several sporting events being televised at the bar.  I will definitely come back again and again.
Marcus H.,"Brentwood, CA",0,4,,3.0,7/21/2013,"I've been to this place a few times and I've been (for the most part) okay with it. It isn't the best service I've received from a BJ's restaurant but not the worst. Unfortunately tonight I ordered some food to-go from home and it didn't go very well. I came to pick up my food and they told me it would be just a couple minutes until it was done. No Problem. They then had me pay. A minute later the cashier  let me know that they were out of artichoke dip for the best beginnings appetizer I ordered. They offered salsa as a replacement. I also ordered calamari so I asked if they could just remove the chips and dip and comp me the calamari. 5 minutes later he comes back and says ""Oh you know what, they actually found some artichoke dip in the back so we can give that to you after all."" ... Really?... That just sounds a little fishy to me. A minute later they bring out my order and I head home. Once I get home I take out the artichoke dip and its ICE COLD!! First of all, if you can't fulfill an order then that should be mentioned before I pay. Secondly, if you magically find the missing part of my order you can at least prepare it. If I wanted frozen food I would have gone to the grocery store. I come here about once a month because I honestly like the place so I really hope this was a one time issue. Other than this occasion, this place has been fine. The food is good and the service is fine."
Jessica G.,"Antioch, CA",0,2,,2.0,10/13/2011,"Ok so we go to the concord one alot and that they have closer to home I def had to check it out, so I go for my sis birthday an were a party of 8 we called 2 c if we needed to make reservations they said and it was kind of slow ( it was a wed night) so we get there and they tell a table will be ready for us in a couple of minutes and we've already been waiting for about 30 so we said ok about 20 min later they look at us and say oh no ones getting up and if we want to sit outside, first they said they were getting our table??? Now there moving us to a total different area??? But whatever we sat outside and it just got worse another was complaining there food was taking to long so they left and then our waitress just got our drink orders all wrong and took forever to come!! Whn we finally ordered our food came pretty fast prob bc not everyone ordered something, so the food was good and now came the check since not everyone ordered something we split the check as we sit there mingling a few people since it was late and we had already paid for our food, so about 4 of us stick around and the waitress comes back and says ""oh have the others gone?"" we said yes and she oh bc I lost there orders an credit card info so I have to recarge them, mind u this about 30 min after they left, so she keeps looking at us to pay but it's not our fault she lost it It was only $40 u wld think after waiting almost an hr to sit and forever for our drink orders we wld get something complimentary but no, so afte moments of her staring at us we just paid. All again is this was just business our drink orders were wrong they ran out sone beers(even though there a brew house!) they ran out of candles for birthdays and they don't sing happy birthday..... Just a sad experience!"
