Cheryl C.,"Antioch, CA",13,263,109,1.0,10/1/2017,"WE'RE DONE!!!! This was the last straw!! We arrived with our friends around 6pm. After about a 30 min wait, they sat us in the room to the right. The place was packed as usual, which I just don't understand since they're are actually quite pricey, and the service SUCKS!!! Brandon H was our server. He took our drink order, then our food order. I told him we had a coupon $10 off $35. It took forever to get refills, and our food. Once the food finally showed up, our friends Steak looked more like a burnt hockey puck at $18.90!! My small Great White Pizza was actually hot a yummy, but come on $16.50 for 6 small pieces of pizza!! My husband's Chicken Fried Steak Burger/Fries $12.75 was pretty bland, but at least they managed to give him hot fries this time. Brandon was MIA most of the night, and once we managed to finally get the bill, the $10 coupon wasn't taken off, so I went to tell Brandon but he already seemed to know like he did it on purpose!! This entire dinner fiasco actually took 2 hours!!!!!"
Bianca V.,"Tracy, CA",105,79,229,3.0,7/21/2017,"2 drunk guys at the bar in the afternoon ruined my experience. Our bartender was nice, and drinks were good. Get the pizookie trio, it's bomb."
Amy E.,"Oakley, CA",240,37,9,4.0,7/20/2017,"In the time this location has been open, a lot of the problems they had in the beginning have been resolved. Employees are far more friendly on the phone now, estimated wait times are closer to accurate (though they still tend to give you a slightly shorter timeframe than you actually end up waiting), and the servers are attentive and take good care of the guests now."
Race R.,"Livermore, CA",0,20,1,2.0,11/10/2017,Just tried the spicy chicken with soba noodles; definitely didn't come out of the kitchen looking like the menu. The menu showed sizable chunks of chicken atop the noodles. Both myself and my daughter had to hunt for small chicken pieces in the noodles. I doubt there was two ounces of meat in my dish.
Anne P.,"Monterey, CA",139,182,342,3.0,1/19/2017,"Visiting friends in Brentwood, their daughter wanted spaghetti so BJs it was. The wait to be seated was your typical wait for a Saturday lunch approximately 10 minutes. The wait for our main entree was quite long since we were seated at 1230 but food was not served until 130. My friend had to wait even longer because she wanted her burger well done and it was medium rare. They took it back and made a new burger and it was done to her liking.  As all other Bjs they had sports on the flat screen TVs. Good vibe and ambience. Had crayons and paper to keep the child entertained while the grown ups were talking."
Eric M.,"Chico, CA",85,2,,1.0,5/30/2017,"If you're looking for mediocre food at a premium price with the worst service possible, this is the place for you. Easily one of the most overrated restaurants in the area. Don't waste your time coming here, you will leave disappointed. 0/5 stars"
Jacob B.,"Brentwood, CA",40,44,,3.0,6/18/2017,"Everyone is always nice and happy, but overall it's just an average meal. The food is ok to mediocre for the most part. The wait can be long, usually long. We come here from time to time but less often these days, as the service and quality have declined over time."
Rochelle D.,"Pittsburg, CA",86,1,1,5.0,4/2/2017,"My husband an I stopped in for the 1st time last weekend. We sat at the bar and order spinach stuffed mushrooms, flat bread, and the auhi tuna salad. The food was sooo good! Our bartender Alicia, was very nice and knowledgeable. I was in the mood for a rum punch, but they didn't offer anything like it on the menu. So Alicia put her skills to work. She surprised​me with a fruity frozen rum concoction that was Delicious! We named it the ""Razzmatazz"". I highly recommend stopping in and visiting Alicia!"
Andrea R.,"Brentwood, CA",31,12,6,1.0,7/19/2017,"This location is a bust. Food was haphazardly prepared, breaded chicken was tasteless and rubbery, ahi poke was cut like it was hacked to death. I used to advocate for this place and hubby always told me it was gross, I guess I had to prove him right for once. ‍ You win babe, place is gross, won't be back (at least to this location) for a while."
Rory B.,"Discovery Bay, CA",23,6,3,1.0,6/8/2017,"I use the waiting list feature in their app and voila my name is nowhere to be found, even I showed to the receptionist that I did it around 11am, here I am waiting, I will give this wait for at least 30 minutes... so disappointed"
Neriah L.,"Antioch, CA",120,11,,1.0,6/3/2017,"I always come here for the Pizookies and tonight I just had the worst service. There was a hair in my bread bowl and when I told my waitress she rolled her eyes went and fixed it but she took off the wrong entree and when I let her know she just didn't reply and glared at me and she said ""so do you want me to fix it or something?"" And once I said ""yes please"" she rolled her eyes said something under her breath and walked away. Her name was Alicia. It was just totally rude and disrespectful."
Kelley F.,"Brentwood, CA",51,23,,3.0,1/31/2017,"Its just like all the other BJ's, the wait isn't that long and the servers are nice. Its very loud and can be distracting at times, so loud that you can not have a conversation with your family. They have the music loud, plus the tvs plus just the noise in the restaurant is off putting at times.  The food is ok for the most part. The outside is kind of dirty and could use some cleaning up. The dessert is the best part my kids love the pizookie!"
Lauren V.,"Brentwood, CA",62,16,3,5.0,10/13/2017,"The food was delicious and the servers are always very friendly. Our waitress Alicia treated us great! The fried mahi mahi tacos and the cherry salmon were yummy. Also, great customer service from the GM, Macy! We will definitely be back!"
Monie B.,"Antioch, CA",0,13,3,1.0,6/8/2017,The chicken wings were so dry here I should have went to Applebee's the drinks that they are charging $10 for tasted like virgin beverages guacamole had an extra long hair in it this will probably be my last visit
Kim B.,"Antioch, CA",93,11,,3.0,5/31/2017,The food is great and the atmosphere is what you can expect for a brew house. I liked the individual pizzas.  I'm giving this place three stars because of the temperature and lack of managements concern about patrons comfort.
danny p.,"Brentwood, CA",0,12,1,1.0,10/15/2016,Brown avocado rolls food all came at once waitress was nice but the food was the worst
Kelly R.,"Rocklin, CA",0,23,2,4.0,10/21/2016,"This place has such good service (my husband and I always sit at the bar) but the food is terrible. The beer selection is meh. The food selection is HUGE, but poorly executed.  We've ordered pizzas twice (how can you mess up pizza?) and both times were very disappointed. Anyhow, the service is great and the employees are very attentive - I just wish the food was good."
Jennifer R.,"Antioch, CA",0,1,1,5.0,8/11/2017,Had an amazing dining experience with our waitress Alexis I. She was very funny and food came out in no time! Definitely coming back again and requesting her as my waitress.
Vickie A.,"Antioch, CA",131,3,2,1.0,7/9/2017,"Long freaking wait was here since 6 and it's 8:30 now, I gotta and want to get outta here......... smh"
michelle b.,"Oakley, CA",225,162,76,5.0,6/21/2017,Decided to have dinner here on a Wednesday to celebrate my parents 46th wedding anniversary. Seated pretty fast even when we were told it would be 20min. We had Cady R as our server and she had gone out of her way to find out what if they even serve any wheat pasta or grain rice. She was attentive and always had a smile on her face even when she had a pretty good amount of tables given to service. So we will definitely come back as Cady gave such great service and was kind  enough to accommodate the rest of my family of 6 to sit behind me and my parents. Food was good and service was great!!
