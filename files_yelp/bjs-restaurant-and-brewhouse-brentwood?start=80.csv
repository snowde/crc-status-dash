Karlo B.,"San Jose, CA",258,115,157,1.0,9/17/2016,This review will be very subjective. It's such a shame that their service isn't up to par with their food. I actually had to walk out of the restaurant this time because i was disgusted that my server was just talking to coworkers while he left me and my wife waiting for more than 10 minutes. The table next to us had been sitting down for at least 5 minutes without being helped. It wasn't busy. There is no excuse and sometimes you just have to walk away. I took my money elsewhere.
Ryan B.,"San Francisco, CA",0,4,3,5.0,8/1/2017,"Long weekend boating in Disco Bay led to needing some hearty comfort food in a comfortable environment; enter BJ's. Close to the highway, it was an easy call with the promise of good food and drink. Count me impressed! The barman started things off right with a few tastes of some killer IPA's and we had a nice chat about the BJ's brewing program. Solid beginning. App of calamari was freshest I've had in a while and was delivered very quickly. My buddy and I both went with a new menu item, slow roasted prime rib sandwich with Sriracha fries, which as you can see from the pic was a generous size and melted in your mouth! Plus, leftovers for lunch the day after. Service was speedy with kind people, food was on point, and they had the ac pumping strong (it's hot out there); I'll be back next time I'm driving through. Thanks team!"
Kristin G.,"Brentwood, CA",125,14,2,1.0,7/16/2017,So disappointed with the service. The good is fine but the service is horrible. Called for curbside pickup they didn't have our order and then when I showed them the email they said they just received it and it would be 20 minutes after I had already been waiting 20 minutes and my curbside order said it was ready. I can't stand bad customer service so therefore 1 star is all they get and rarely give bad reviews. Too bad it's a chain restaurant and my one bad review won't change the way they handle their customer service.
Christine R.,"Oakley, CA",0,7,,1.0,7/10/2017,"We got a deep dish pizza and it was not sliced. Had to rip it apart. Dry and flavorless, cold, no sauce. It was gross. My husband is easy going, and he was totally ticked off like I never see him. Reminds me of my last visit to Chili's ten years ago. Or my last visit to Applebee's like 15 years ago. This will be the last visit to BJ's."
Russell Y.,"San Mateo, CA",32,4,,1.0,4/10/2017,"WOW is the first word I would choose for a nightmarish day at BJ's. 1st) We ordered our drinks and my wife got this new drink. It was a peach ice tea and it didn't taste good, so she ordered a strawberry lemonade.  2) We ordered mini corn dogs and fries for my 4 year old. When we took the batter off, the hotdog was ice cold and we asked the waitress if she could order another one. So, when we got his new order it was the same..ice cold hot dogs. Third time was the charm, but it took about a half hour just to get our first appetizer.  3) Another half hour went by and we got our main entrees, but our 2nd appetizer was no where to be found because the waitress said it was ""lost"".  So, when all was said and done and we got the bill the waitress chuckled and said that we were the only ones who's day went wrong. We were going to buy $100.00 gift card for my parents since it was their 60th anniversary but since we had such a bad experience here, we decided to go some place else."
Alex W.,"San Francisco, CA",27,78,1,5.0,3/19/2017,The food is always fresh. Service has been just fine. I wish I could block the people who give this place bad reviews. I don't need your opinion on anywhere else thanks!
Nihad V.,"Antioch, CA",51,137,155,5.0,5/1/2016,"I love this place , these guys know their food . Food is always fresh and very well done. The building it self is very clean and nice . I love the layout."
MsShari B.,"Antioch, CA",0,9,,5.0,7/18/2017,"BJ's is my absolute favorite place to dine, eat or fill up on. For starters, the menu is not two or three pages, it is a heavy book of all sorts of entrees. There is something for every taste bud. I am a fan of the clam chowder and now of the Appetizer Rootbeer chicken wings, yum!! It is not proper etiquette to lick your fingers and pick your teeth at the table (sorry!).  Everything was delish. One small suggestion, please serve the clam chowder hot! So hot that you can see the steam rising from it. The clam chowder is cold after 2 or 3 spoonfuls. This has happened more than one visit. Other than that, everything was awesome! If I am not dining solo, I always bring someone who has never dined at BJ's.   Great food and atmosphere. But work on the heat of the food, please."
Cesar S.,"Brentwood, CA",29,3,1,1.0,6/24/2017,"This particular bj's is horrible. The service is super slow and they sat 6 of us in a table for 4. Right beside us was a table for 6 with 2 people in it and we got here at the same time. We asked if they could do anything about it, they said that they could not sit us anywhere else when there was a big table right beside us that had room."
Stacy M.,"Discovery Bay, CA",77,6,1,5.0,7/15/2017,"I love eating at BJ's. Their food is really good and I love the 1/2 off wine on Tuesdays. I get the Similar wine at $6 a glass...so good.  And I like their service, they always smile and do a little extra."
Denise F.,"Discovery Bay, CA",80,1017,209,5.0,2/29/2016,"The menu has gotten more veggie/vegan friendly lately, and the service was outstanding the last time I came in here for dinner & drinks with my roommate! The spicy Brussels sprouts are awesome, the salmon & Flatbread pizza was also really good too! It seems like the food is much more creative & unique now, very different than before! The beers, ciders & mixed drinks are always great from this place, the berry cider is awesome, it's a low alcohol %, but it's an awesome summertime drink!!"
Paolo G.,"Brentwood, CA",0,31,,2.0,5/6/2017,"Let's see. We have been there several times because of its convenience and the variety of the menu. (1) Food: 3 stars: although the food is a ""standardized"" version of Italian, American, etc...cuisine it is ok for the price. (2) service: 3 stars: we have had quite a few waitresses. Overall​ no major complaints. (3) hostess:...1 star: to the management..please stop hiring people that ignore when you approach the podium and keep on talking among themselves. I would say this part is consistently between mediocre and bad."
Emma B.,"Brentwood, CA",0,2,,5.0,10/6/2017,I only put 5 stars so people would see this. I arrived an hour early and they said that it was a 25 min wait. A hour and and a half go by and I am still sitting waiting for a table. We had to cancel our plans for after dinner because we were seated so late. Dinner was very yummy  and pazzokie was delicious.
David H.,"Antioch, CA",1,12,,1.0,7/2/2017,Trying to come here again to see if the service has improved. I was wrong. Their wheat beer didn't taste very good and my mom's burger came out raw. The server was a little slow too.
Adam W.,"Alamo, CA",0,5,,1.0,7/24/2016,"The family and I used to eat here once a week.  Tonight the server delivering our food, reached across the table and knocked an ice water over with her arm. The entire water spilled directly on to my wife and our four month old baby(who she was holding at the time.)   This caused the baby to begin hysterically crying and then vomit on to my wife and my sister.  It was a chaotic scene no doubt.  Hey no biggie, accidents happen.  After a lengthy clean up and a soaking wet/uncomfortable wife and baby, we quickly finished our dinner.  The waitress said she would send the manager over, who never showed.  I was then delivered the check at full price. So I went in seek of the manager.  After locating him, and informing him of our experience, he took care of us by giving us a promotional ""app usage"" of 20% off.  Wow!   After an incident like this, which made our visit way more trouble than it was worth. I was expecting a little more.  The best part....  wait for it....  we were still charged for the ""sparkling cucumber mint"" water my wife and baby were now wearing.   To the corporation of BJ's:  You just lost a considerable amount more money than you gained, I love your beer and food, and frequent the Brentwood location often.  you can thank your a** clown manager ""Travis"" for a loss of a regular customer."
Mandeep S.,"Hercules, CA",15,16,4,1.0,2/28/2017,You order a vegetarian sandwich and you are delivered a sandwich full of bacon. This is ridiculous. I cannot believe the careless attitude we endured here at this location.
Jessie K.,"Antioch, CA",256,76,4,5.0,5/18/2017,"Love this place, I stop for a bite when traveling on road trips though the Dublin area, good food, great in house beer, and the employees are awesome! Michelle m, the bartender was amazing the last couple of times I've been in... thank you folks! Keep it upď"
Critic V.,"San Francisco, CA",50,34,,5.0,9/26/2017,"Thanks to Nick for going the extra step to bring complimentary (bread and fruits) treat to our table even before introducing yourself. Today is an auspicious day for me, and you actually made it feel extra special without knowing it   thanks for the awesome customer service"
Sebastian M.,"San Francisco, CA",15,17,5,5.0,5/14/2017,I literally only came here for the desserts just because I had already eaten dinner and had a late night sweet tooth
Betty M.,"Brentwood, CA",2,20,,1.0,2/11/2017,"I don't like leaving bad reviews, but we were very disappointed with the service here. Our waiter went MIA, and the food came out cold after a long wait. When my husband wanted to ask them to heat it up, we couldn't find anyone to help us. Ultimately, my husband had to bring the plate to the kitchen himself and ask for help. By that time, he had lost his appetite. Very bizarre experience because the restaurant wasn't even that busy. We won't be going back."
