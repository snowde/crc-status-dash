Me C.,"Beverly Hills, CA",13,94,2,3.0,12/21/2017,"Menu limited great. Food was just okay. I won't be back.  Calamari 8/10 (wasn't hot when it came out) Pork ribs 8/10 Jambalaya - 7/10 Poozikie - 7/10 (bland, cheap ice cream)"
Chris S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,2,1.0,1/1/2018,"Honestly this is the 3rd or 4th time this place has let me down. I came last time and the same waiter messed up my friends drink and switched it with a couple that was behind us, only reason we knew it was her drink, because there was lipstick on my friends drink. Then we told the waiter ""hey this is the wrong drink, it's not my drink"" he said its your drink and began walking away. So that was like in September 2017 idk what day. I kept it cool cause I like bj's but TODAY IM WRITING A REVIEW BECAUSE I CAME IN AND GOT THE SAAAAAAAAAAAMEEEE DUDE.!!.! Like bro quit alrdy.... right off the back I knew it was him.. stayed quiet and told my girlfriend about it. So I ordered a burger then I got my food and asked the server who brought it, hey can I get some ranch, he ignored me and I saw him help somebody else. Ok that was annoying and I'm waiting nearly 15mins after getting my food with no refill or ranch. So I drank my girlfriends water and ate my food then this dude still has the NERVE to bring me RANCH.?!?!? All I gotta say is I'm NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER COMING BACK.!! I'm mentioning to all my co workers and everyone I bumped into in Burbank.! #TheyNeedBetterCustomerService"
H B.,"Glendale, CA",1,18,2,1.0,12/27/2017,"If you're planning to spend the same amount of dollars but get half of what you get in BJs in glendale or pasadena be my guest!  Small portions compared to anywhere else I've been, bad service, takes 30 mins to bring a hot sauce !!!!! Not coming back!"
Matthew P.,"Redondo Beach, CA",3,6,,1.0,12/22/2017,"No respect for time. Myself and several colleagues decided it would be fun to fo out to lunch here.  We arrived at 11:15 and did not depart until nearly 1:00.  You might be thinking that we enjoyed a long lunch but you would be wrong. We were ignored for the first half hour and then the chef showed up to take our order?  Weird.  Several of us ordered their special which included ""bottomless fries""  well we reached the bottom but since our waiter was nowhere to be seen we never got a refill.  Then it came time to pay and the waiter was once again nowhere to be seen.  Once he finally showed up we threw down cash and bolted.  If we had waited for change it may have taken another half hour. Up until today there had been only one place on my personal blacklist in this area and now there are two."
Sheryl T.,"Granada Hills, Los Angeles, CA",17,55,38,4.0,12/20/2017,"I love BJs - great stable restaurant that you can count on for a variety of food.  This is the second year we had our company's Christmas luncheon because it's convenient, great ambience and good prices (although my supervisor was paying for it we didn't want to break the bank..lol).  For appetizers we had bbq chicken wings and avocado rolls that were delicious.  My entree was the spaghetti & meatballs -- yeah I was impressed' Very large portion that I finished the remainder for lunch today.  The service wasn't the best maybe because it was 11 of us and it was lunch hour but the waiter looked low-key stressed and didn't provide the best service.  I'll be back soon!"
Walt P.,"Reseda, Los Angeles, CA",0,14,1,1.0,12/17/2017,"Ordered  a ""to go"" order of Asian chopped salad. Got home, opened the box and a big disappointment: Half empty container with rotten lettuce and missing almost half of the ingredients mentioned in the menu. It honestly looked like I received yesterday's leftover. Called the manager and they said they're going to send me a gift card for $15. As if that is going to fulfill my hunger... Update:  they asked me to email them the picture of the salad and the order number which I did. Nothing happened. Not only did I not receive a follow up but no one cared to even reply to my email."
Rini J.,"Irvine, CA",178,1,1,4.0,1/6/2018,"I take it back! posted on here about a burnt brussel sprout appetizer and the manager happened to get a notification, found us, apologized, and offered a new appetizer. He was really friendly and understood us and was just genuinely happy to help! Also, my incredibly picky mom loved her food so bonus! And my vegetarian deep dish ziti was perfect. Our food came pretty fast and it was an enjoyable lunch."
Allen A.,"Los Angeles, CA",43,12,1,1.0,12/31/2017,"I was planning to eat across the street but the wait was to long so we decided to eat here. My wife had the salmon and I had the pork chops with a bowl of claim chowder. Salmon was good but her veggies were very soggy. As I was eating my pork chops I notice the farther I ate to the center the more raw it got. At this point I did talk to the waitress and she said after she talked to the cook that they cook it to 165° and if you want it cooked more you must request it? I just want it cooked, she didn't even look at my food just trusted what the cook said. Come on customer gets raw food on his table get the manager and look at the food,  It's that simple. dam I should have read yelps reviews before I came here. My mistake!!!"
Adriana R.,"Van Nuys, Los Angeles, CA",241,230,280,1.0,11/25/2017,"Oh BJ's. I loved you in my youth. Many high school and college memories involve your pizookies. But you just do not stand up to the test of time. First of all, this location has valet parking for $4.50 and they drove my car two parking spaces to park it. That annoys me.  We had to wait 30 minutes for a table and they didn't even seem that busy. Once we did sit, our server was nowhere to be found, CONSISTENTLY. My husband ordered the prime rib special and that was a mistake. The prime rib was incredibly over cooked and dry, and the sides were lacking in flavor. I had the BBQ deep dish pizza and it was also bland. We then ended with a chocolate chips pizookie which I was SO SURE was going to be amazing, because it's a hot cookie with ice cream, so how can you mess that up? Well it turns out you can serve a lukewarm cookie and it kinda just kills the whole vibe.  Also, because of the slow service and disappearing waiter, the whole meal took over 2 hours. What a waste of time and money."
Travis H.,"Los Angeles, CA",237,130,165,1.0,12/27/2017,"I love BJ's, but dang does this one suck. I ordered a mini size pizza for pickup and even though it was ready shortly before I arrived, I still had to wait 20 minutes before they would give it to me, so it was cold by the time I actually got to eat it. On top of that it was undercooked, the layer of dough under the toppings was, well, doughy and not fluffy. Not cooked all the way through. I've done carry-out with BJ's more than once before at the Westwood location and it's been delicious every time. So disappointing."
Jerald R.,"Sunnyvale, CA",178,1,2,1.0,11/7/2017,"Absolutely horrible. I placed my order via DoorDash and received an email from DoorDash stating the restaurant had confirmed my order at 6:37p. Delivery was scheduled for 7:41p. And at around 7:46 I wasn't even showing the dasher at the restaurant so I texted to be sure everything was okay. They said they were picking it up. I contacted customer support and the dasher texted saying the restaurant claimed the order was never placed and it would be a few minutes. By then it was 8p. 20 minutes after it was supposed to have been delivered. The customer support rep tried calling the restaurant and was placed on hold for an ungodly amount of time while my poor dasher was stuck waiting there. Finally the rep gets back with me at 8:40p and informs me the restaurant is not even going to fill the order, and that the dasher said there were many people waiting. TWO HOURS after I placed the order and an HOUR after it was supposed to be here.  My dasher waited at the restaurant for over half an hour - i wouldnt even have to wait that long for my food if Id gone there to eat in person!!! IT'S a TUESDAY night!!! Even in person on a weekend - no matter how busy you are I would never have had to wait 30mins after i ordered let alone TWO HOURS to receive my food. Absolute shittiest service. DoorDash was nothing but helpful, and I've never had a problem with them - but to have you as a restaurant tell me you wouldn't even FILL the order after all that? Absolute Shit."
G H.,"Arroyo Grande, CA",1,29,1,4.0,1/10/2018,"On a family vacation. Stopped here just because we were driving around looking for a place to have dinner. Dinner was great!  We had Fire Roast Chicken Barbacoa, Chicken Alfredo (good size portion), create your own pizza (deep dish), BJs Brewhouse Classic Pizza (thin crust) and the Mediterranean Pita Taco. Food was very good.  Service was fast. Friendly waitress. Good family atmosphere.  Create your own pizza was over priced (yikes!!$16.50 for a small!!).  Overall, good place to stop. Note to BJs:  take a brush to your sinks in the bathrooms. Gross!!!  In less than 5 min they could look decent."
Loren R.,"Anchorage, AK",10,242,262,4.0,9/2/2017,"Wings. Got the traditional buffalo  Great flavor Over cooked on my opinion, dry...ish Not a meal, it's a light meal size Smaller wings.  Sweet potato fries too salty for me.  Yet they were a welcome option and would order them again.  Friendly bartendress. ""Mika ""very personable and positive.  Beer glass never stayed empty.  Food order on fast.  I'd probably try something else on the menu( tomorrow) before doing the wings again.  They weren't bad.  Just not something that would draw me in the door.  But if you have a hankerin' fir wings. , get em. Love the relaxed atmosphere. ------------ Next day.  Ordered the deep dish pizza.  Rebecca. The barristress , was attentive and pleasant  FYI, owners of restaurants. Re: business travelers/ single patrons  I sit at the bar because I can: Get attention fast  Get beer fast Not wait for a refill Order food fast.  Pay fast  And get to my hotel and get to sleep.  NONE of that happens at a table.  None ! Also, not all barkeeps get that.  Rebecca nailed it.  Food order and beer order in , in 30 seconds  Second beer on the way as I finished the first Paid and potentially out the door in  30 min.  Deep dish pizza.  4.5 stars.  I'd prefer more cookin, to get the cheese crusty on the edges. ( didn't get that) and more brown on the corners of the veggies ( nope) Still  I'll starve myself again to order the pizza here again. I'll just ask for a few more minutes.  Thanks Rebecca  And thanks BJ's"
Jordan S.,"Burbank, CA",51,43,3,1.0,12/22/2017,"made the mistake of trying it again because my son loves pizookies. From the hostess to the waitress, it was just not good! dinner with 2 kids, my daughter spilled a bit of her overfilled soda and instead of bringing us place settings, she brought my daughter cocktail napkins. ordered cheese curds, they were burnt. Asked again for place settings. 10 more minutes until they brought us some. She rushed us to order , which i hate. Food was blah, not the waitress fault. She disappeared when we were done, took forever too get a check. I wont be back. Just sucks. The one in Woodland Hills is much better."
Lena P.,"Ontario, CA",21,486,1384,4.0,11/5/2017,"Our waiter, Hunter, was amazing! We had a huge party of 25 and he managed our whole table by himself and did the best job I've ever seen in managing a large party like this. He was always polite, happy, energetic and always there when you needed something. 5++ stars for Hunter's customer service!  The food was good, BUT...they did mess up on my tavern pizza, it had meat on it when it wasn't suppose to...but it was sent back and taken care of. Although the new pizza I got was still wrong, as it was missing other ingredients, and I didn't want to send it back for the second time, so I just ate it as is. The pizza looked like it was thrown together very messy...their line cooks need some work! Their chocolate chip Pizookie is always good and so is the monkey bread!"
Nav B.,"Irvine, CA",238,2,,1.0,1/6/2018,"Upon our visit to this BJ's location, we were seated at a dirty table with no utensils. It took 15 minute for the waitress to get our drink order and another 10 to bring us our drinks. The food was cold and we were offered sharing plates when we were almost done eating. We finished eating and it took the waitress another 20 minutes to come take our dessert order. The pizookie came out cold and hard. To add onto that, we were not offered a refill on any of our drinks. We waited for the waitress to pick up the check, yet it took another 20 minutes and we had to go up to the front to see if we could pay there. Extremely dissatisfied with the experience and will never come to this location in the future. Also the waitress seemed like she did not want to be there and gave off a very unpleasant vibe."
Wendy Y.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",28,4,7,5.0,11/4/2017,Love this place!!! My favorite is the club sandwich with a baked potato. Too bad they didn't have potatoes this evening so I got fries instead and still was delicious... For dessert my daughters love to order the Pizookie it's so delicious.
David S.,"Seabrook, TX",0,19,1,5.0,12/28/2017,Service was awesome! Food was hot and quick .  Great dinner out with the kids . Always happy with BJs restaurants.
Jak Leroy D.,"Hidden Hills, CA",108,155,261,5.0,7/19/2017,"We love BJ's! We come here at least 3 times a month and every time is perfection.  The servers and bartenders are all very personable and hard working and the food is awesome! Whenever we're craving pizza and a pizookie, we head over to BJ's. The best pizza is definitely BJ's Favorite and the Classic Pizookie is a great meal ender. For appetizers, I recommend the Beets with Feta, the Sliders, and the Root Beer Glazed Ribs. Can't go wrong! They also have an awesome Happy Hour Monday through Friday 3pm-7pm."
Ashley A.,"Los Angeles, CA",245,136,4,1.0,10/6/2017,"I ordered a salad and specifically said no feta cheese, I'm vegan...cheese was sprinkled in, out and around it. Either someone was being passive aggressive or just doesn't do directions. That's kind of scary to operate that way and work in the food industry. Thx, BJ's!  Unbelievable."
Kevin C.,"Denver, CO",14,86,19,5.0,10/19/2017,Who doesn't love BJ's?  Great menu with plenty to choose from! Everything we ordered tasted excellent and the service was excellent as well!
Valentina S.,"Los Angeles, CA",108,304,847,4.0,4/24/2017,"In downtown Burbank, there are several decent sport bars to watch games but most of these bars do not have their own parking, so you gotta park in a public parking and walk at least 10 min to a bar/restaurant; however BJ's has its own parking (self-parking and valet parking) and you don't have to deal with any parking problem. The food quality is the same as other BJ's which I'd give 3.5 stars for the food and beverages. The service is decent and ambience is good in this location. Overall is a cool spot for watching a soccer or basketball game with a group."
Bree N.,"Burbank, CA",515,154,172,1.0,9/14/2017,"Came here after class to continue my son's birthday celebration. This time, joined by more family. Everyone ordered something different and shared. I wasn't crazy about anything. Not even the Pizookie. Oh wait- the beer was great. I mean, but that's the point, right? You come here to enjoy a beer and watch sports in a clean restaurant setting but the food appears to be secondary to that. The restaurant was clean and comfortable and the service was good. Despite the subpar food I would've given this place a two to three stars. But halfway through my son's birthday pizookie he found a long straight hair embedded in the cookie (Did not match the texture of anyone at our table). We notified the server who apologized and offered to replace it but we were over at that point. Just gross. Won't be back."
Steve W.,"La Mirada, CA",429,79,186,4.0,12/2/2017,"Came here for lunch. Valet parking was awesome and super fast. Used the app and were moved up in line to get seats, and even placed our entire order online while waiting to hear seated. Had our food in less than 10 minutes and enjoyed an incredible lunch! Service was outstanding too!"
Em K.,"Seattle, WA",88,218,115,5.0,11/16/2017,"I think this place would be a great place to take your parents or in-laws!  They serve a variety of things, everyone is sure to be happy :) I've had their pasta and thin pizzas and have been very happy with both!"
Andrea A.,"Burbank, CA",48,37,5,1.0,12/4/2017,"UPDATE- I have reached out to the GM who responded to this three times without a return phone call. I am keeping the corporate office updated, and they seem to be taking this very seriously.  What a disgraceful way to manage."
Cassandra Y.,"Burbank, CA",5000,1338,8950,3.0,2/4/2017,"The Service: Super super super slow on Friday night. It was packed!! It was tough to get good service. Our server was always no where to be found. The food was served 30 minutes later....  The Parking: Valet parking or self-park. Just let the attendant knows, they will guide you where to self-park. If parking lot is full, you can park across street, public parking lot (free)"
Janet K.,"Reseda, Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,4.0,12/10/2017,"Love to hung out with my old friends here.they have big parking lot and you don't need to worry about parking space, soonest i see the sing of Bj's i have to pulled over and get something. to be honest you can get the lots of restaurant in Burbank town but most of the time i have parking place problem. so i highly recommend this place in burbank don't miss it."
Evelin F.,"Los Angeles, CA",99,13,1,1.0,12/28/2017,Because we got seated and literally every waiter just passed us by and ignoring us. This is not the first time we been treated like this at a BJS the waiters only care for the nice dressed  people vs anyone else and dont care  if a client waits there for more than 15 mins to just get even asked if they want water. This place needs to rethink on how they treat i guess regular clients.
Stevi B.,"Los Angeles, CA",145,96,124,4.0,11/7/2017,Being from the east coast I had no idea what BJ's was. It's actually pretty good!  They have amazing portions and great drinks. Just like any chain restaurant if you been to one you have been to them all so you will never be disappointed on the food. That's a promise! They have pretty good drink deals as well!  You can not leave without getting the dessert!!! Soooo good!!!!
Jay W.,"Rowland Heights, CA",144,1,,1.0,1/1/2018,"So me and my friends go to Bj's for food after universal and this was the closest one. We've been to BJs before and we thought it was great so we just hopped over to this one because we were starving. This was undeniably the worst decision of the night. Keep in mind we're just a group of four college kids and wanted food. The first thing that happened was the cups they brought out were plastic. At first we thought it was just like whatever but we looked around and someone ordered a drink so I thought that was why they got a glass. But after looking more I found that everyone else who ordered water got a glass except for us. The waitress came back and explained there were no cups left and that was fine until the party who just sat down right after us got their water and it was in a glass. Second when our food came out my friend and I ordered the exact same thing but the difference was that his platter had the full dish on it while mines had 4 pieces of broccoli and noodles. I searched underneath to look for the rest and found none so I called the waitress and I was surprised to see her serving the table behind me. I made sure she saw my hand raised for help and thought that she would come after only she left for a couple more minutes before coming back. Alright so whatever that's all fine. But once she came and. I notified her that there was barely any broccoli while showing her (literally moving it all around and lifting the noodle) she said ""oh it's under the noodle"". To which I just lifted it again and asked her if I could have more. I thought this would be the end of the trouble but after she brought back my plate of food and I began to eat I discovered a clump of undercooked pasta in it. I thought it was just me being picky but I wasn't feeling like finishing so I asked my friend if he wanted the rest and he ate it and said it tasted funny and that the other one that was brought out tasted a lot better. At this point I gave up on the dish and just wanted to leave except my friends wanted to get a pizookie so I just went along with it. Only when we ordered the pizookie we asked for a refill on the water. Only the refill never came and for that matter, no one ever came around to offer us a refill on our plastic cups of water. That's the end of my story of the night. Hopefully this was just a minor problem because their a new startup(according to yelp) but if I were to be honest, the only reason I gave a 1 is because yelp won't let me give them a 0."
Lorie N.,"San Jose, CA",87,118,663,3.0,6/14/2017,Spacious space. Food is similar to other BJ's. Cool and familiar American food and beer.
Jem K.,"Irvine, CA",3,142,373,2.0,7/30/2017,Came here around 430 and they said 10-15 min wait. i looked around there were alot of empty tables. So we just assumed not alot of servers to cover the whole area. So we waited and waited and waited... and we finally got called after 30mins.:)  Food: Great white Deepdish pizza 14in. - dont expect Chicago deep dish. It's ok. a bit salty. Enough to feed 5 people with 2 slices for leftovers. Avocado roll - my favorite dish! 2 rolls had the spicy taste to it.. some just had plain avocado. i remember it being really good but today it was ok. I mean... i'd order it again.. today just felt off maybe? Calamari - crunchy good ol' calamari. Deep it in marinara. Yum.:)  Shrimp and asparagus pasta - bland. we smothered it with cheese and crushed red peppers. Had like 3-5 pcs of shrimp? Dry and a bit undercooked. Will probably not order this again. TIP: if you download their app and use mobile Pay... U get to free mini pizookie! My other favorite!:)  Park in the structure if you dont want to do valet
Chris G.,"Las Vegas, NV",45,123,153,2.0,10/12/2017,"Wow! Insert said face here! After a long day at universal studios ( private party ), we decided to chill back at the hotel and grab some food to go , luckily ( we thought ) bjs was right across the street ? We placed an online order and were awaiting a confirmation email as it said one would be arriving soon ......after a minute or 2 no email arrived so we called,they said they received order , so I started walking across street , upon arrival there was no one at podium or take out area and I was told by other guests who were waiting for take out as well that the girl would be back,I went to restroom to wash up and coming out still no one who worked there, after a few more minutes the girl came back and brought out the other guests food and apparently my order, which was quoted as 15/20 minutes from the time we hung up the phone at this point it was only about 10minutes from hotel, waiting and bathroom break , the takeout girl asked if I was picking up and I gave my name  and she says order was ready , I was ""wow cool!"" Than she says that we were just waiting on the queso dip, I did place an extra order for milk and extra pzookie, which she said should come out together, once again cool, she said it was just going to be a moment,after a few minutes the manager came out and said they were out of queso , and if I would like something else because they were closing soon, I decided on spinach dip , then she said it would be out soon then after a few minutes more I got spinach dip and pzookie, the girl forgot the milk and I had to wait a few more moments for that ! By the time I got back to room about 35 minutes had gone by , for an order that was mostly ready when I got there !! Wtf ?? Anyway back at the room, we opened food that was either cold ( spinach dip and sliders ) or burnt ( pzookie) , there was no ketchup for fries and all in all it was a very disappointing experience !! My friend called the restaurant and was told by Agatha the night manager that there was nothing she could do because they were closed already ! For the most part at the Henderson NV restaurant , I totally enjoy my BJs experience but here in California this left a lot to de desired !!"
Abbiegail S.,"Atascadero, CA",152,117,80,3.0,5/7/2017,"Food was great! Especially the avocado egg rolls... which are to die for! But the reason I'm giving the place 3 stars were because we waited 15-20 minutes on our drinks and there was a mixup on our salads. I asked for shrimp on the walnut salad and my friend asked for the salad with fruit (no meat). After eating it halfway through, I realize the salad I was eating was hers but with shrimp and the salad she was eating was mine. We didn't want to say anything after consumption but the chef should have given us the correct orders.  With that being said, food was still delicious and I appreciate the waitress' effort despite the drinks being held up. She was great in every other way and was very sweet and friendly."
Andrew P.,"Long Beach, CA",138,341,761,5.0,11/19/2016,"My friend & I had a great experience yesterday with our server, Adam. He was very friendly and efficient with us and we were glad to have him take care of us. Originally we were seated by the smaller bar in a smaller 2-top booth, but we were uncomfortably warm sitting there so we asked if it was possible to move to a different spot (in which case we were moved to a bigger booth close by with a much better & comfortable temperature.  We were told about the 2 for $25 deal so we pursued it and Adam was very willing to explain what we could get. We ordered the 2 salads, a medium pepperoni w/ jalapeños and bacon, and a Cookies N' Cream pizookie. All of it was amazing and it only came out to $25 plus tax. Of course had to get a pitcher of their delicious Brewhouse Blonde Pale ale so our bill came out to roughly $47 or so.  I was a little disappointed in finding out that I wasn't credited my BJs rewards points as I had asked, but maybe I will contact the restaurant in hopes to getting them back, haha.  Definitely a good location for BJs. Luckily for us, the place was not that busy on a Friday night at 6 or 6:30 (I was surprised), but later on it filled up quickly."
Christine L.,"Los Angeles, CA",841,521,1386,5.0,10/3/2017,The staff here is outstanding!!! They are great at accommodating my food allergies & gluten intolerance. The Pazookie is awesome. Food is good and we didn't have a wait.
Alexa O.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,10,12,1.0,11/25/2017,I had the WORST experience at this bjs with my friends. We came in a larger group (12-15 people) for my friends birthday and our waiter whom resembled josh from drake and josh was EXTREMELY RUDE and INCONVENIENT. He fat shamed my friend for ordering two meals and judged her for the amount of food she was eating  and made her feel bad. This establishment then took over two hours to bring out all of our food and then when my friend accidentally spilled her drink trying to reach food from him he became extremely annoyed and angry. He then CHARGED US AN INCONVENIENCE FEE of $45 all because he has a rude temper. I will post a photo of him.
Arina O.,"Burbank, CA",186,101,38,1.0,12/10/2017,"BJs in burbank is very disorganized and messy. The plates are always dirty and it takes a long time to get any waiters attention or even the food. We waited 45 minutes for pazookies and when it finally arrived there was food from someone else's order on the bottom. The staff is extremely nice and tries hard, but there's always some sort of mix up happening at this location."
Mona T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,,1.0,9/22/2017,BJ's has been a favorite restaurant of ours for years.  The food flavor is excellent. However the service consistently is slow from the front door through to the kitchen. It took 1 hr and 30 minutes to get our food once we sat down. I'm saddened!
