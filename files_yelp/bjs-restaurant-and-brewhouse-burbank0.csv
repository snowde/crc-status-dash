George B.,"Modesto, CA",7,16,1,1.0,8/27/2016,Avoid this restaurant. They brought us cold food and spaghetti with no sauce. They did nothing to rectify the situation. Go somewhere else. Wish I could give zero stars.
Manuel A.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,63,28,1.0,2/20/2017,I can't put negative stars but if I could I would. The worst service I have ever experienced. Went with friends. Took 2 and a half hours from the moment we arrived until the moment we left because the service was extremely slow. The pizza we ordered was cold. The drinks never came on time. We wanted to pay separately they didn't make that happen. Just the worst experience of my life. I even had nightmares of this place. Please don't go there HORRIBLE. GOOD THING they're going to open a yard house down the street in a few months def going to do business with them. Wish i could campaign to not waste your money on this horrible service joint. Had better expectations about this place I can't believe they did my friends and I this way.
Justin P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,1.0,12/9/2016,"If I could, I'd give zero stars. I took my girlfriend here for her bday because she loves pizookies. The servers were friendly enough but the service time was awful and when we ordered our pizookie, it took over 30 minutes. When we finally received it, it was heavily overcooked and pretty much inedible. They gave us a free pizookie coupon but it wasn't nearly enough compensation for the poor overall service we received. We certainly won't be going back to this location and will very likely not be visiting any other any time soon."
Aneta K.,"Chatsworth, CA",0,16,,1.0,3/31/2017,If I can give no stars I would. This is the second time I've been here this month and it's been an absolute disappointment... I was here beginning of this month and there was hair in my food.. and today here I am again (because my daughter loves the food here) and I get my food and the rice is cold as ice. I'm lactose intolerant and they brought my re-made  jambalaya with a bit of cheese in there.
Robert B.,"Carmel, NY",26,21,,2.0,2/20/2017,"Reasonable food for the money, but playing fast pop music was driving everyone crazy and service was slow. Zagat rates music and noise as number 2 complaint, so why lose customers? I'm aware that studies show more noise makes people leave sooner, but keep in mind that after two visits we probably won't be back. I'm 53 and my wife is 48. But my partner is in his late 20's and won't go to BJs due to noise. My son was annoyed and he's 12! Noise is elevated because now customers are talking  louder to be heard. Conversely we went to Outback the other day. It was just as crowded, but they had the music turned down so it was still pleasant.  I think we'll have to take BJ's off our list and warn others off on Yelp. If you do go to BJs, don't go when there's any chance it will be crowded."
Yonatan O.,"Porter Ranch, CA",0,2,,1.0,2/20/2017,"My girlfriend and I were here on a Sunday night around 9:30pm, we put our name on the list as we are waiting we see the hostess sit 2 couples who came in after we did, no big deal it must have been a simple mistake. We finally order they bring our drinks and we are told they ran out of artichoke dip which was why we decided to go to this place on the first place, my girlfriend was pretty annoyed, at that point I decide to order a coffee, after 10 min I still had not get my coffee I see our server and reminded her about my coffee, a couple minutes latter the finally bring it to me without a spoon to stir it with, I ask someone and they bring me a dirty soup spoon so at that moment we decide to get up and leave... terrible costumer service"
Michelle F.,"Studio City, CA",28,138,155,1.0,11/11/2016,Unfortunately I had to even rate them. Immediately greeted upon entering. We waited 15 minutes while 3 waitress/waiter were talking personal business behind us then another 5 waitress /waiters at the other end of the isle talking. No acknowledgement. No eater. No drinks. Place is not busy. First & last time here. Wasted money on valet
Stacy R.,"Burbank, CA",0,85,3,2.0,5/21/2017,Ordered for take out that I was told to pick up in 15 min...what a lie! Order wasn't complete and pizza got cold and waited another 30+ minutes for their kitchen to get the sandwich. Lousy food. Waste of money.
Haley K.,"San Jose, CA",499,405,720,3.0,7/21/2015,"I love BJ's Restaurant...usually. I actually had just visited the San Diego location only a week prior, so I'm definitely a fan. Can't go wrong with their oreo poozokie and their deep dish pizza's! My family was in town and staying at the Marriott in Burbank, walking distance to this location. We figured why not grab some dinner there. We all love this place, so it was perfect. I called ahead to make sure we didn't have to wait too long, since it was a Friday evening. We got there, put our name in and only waited about 5 minutes before we were seated in a big booth. Perfect! Our waiter was great. He was super attentive and I could tell running around to make sure everyone was pleased, but apparently there were some kitchen issues. I'm glad we opted away from ordering a deep dish pizza (got the flat bread to start, which was good), because the large table next to us had ordered 2 large deep dish pizzas and apparently had been there for almost 2 hours waiting. They were accommodating, giving them free salads and making sure they were happy, but still!  My dad got the fish and chips, and my mom and I decided to split the avocado egg rolls and the shrimp scampi. She had ordered it before and enjoyed it, and I had been wanting to try it. When it came out, it looked nothing like the picture on the menu. I'm not one to send food back, but it was horrible. No flavor at all. I felt bad since I knew they were stressing out with the kitchen issue, but I also didn't think we should pay $17 for something we didn't touch more than a few bites. The manager came out and was nice. Asked if we wanted to try something else or would like a poozkie, but at that time it was late, we had an appetizer and ate the eggrolls, so we were fine. We also didn't want to be stuck waiting for anything else.  I'm not sure I would go back to that location, but I will give this place 3 stars because the service was great. The food, ehhhh."
Benjamin S.,"Los Angeles, CA",460,460,191,3.0,6/5/2015,"I've been coming to this BJ's since it opened as I was one of the original servers hired on back in 2000 when they opened.  I respect the company tremendously and it's been interesting to watch their menu change over the years (and sadly, the price of the pizzookie go up... oh inflation!)   Back in April my wife had her birthday and since she's part of the BJ's club, she gets a free pizzookie so she thought to make life easy on us all, we'd just have a pizza and pizzookie for dinner that night and do it takeout style.  She called at 4:30 in the afternoon to have the host tell her he was too busy to take her order and that she'd have to call back in an hour.  Had he said that to me, I would have given him an earful, asked to speak with the manager, given them an earful and made sure never to return to this restaurant again.  Remember, I worked for BJ's and I KNOW this is unacceptable.  My wife was annoyed, but she really wanted pizza and a pizzookie (she's pregnant) so she called back an hour later. Picks up the pizza, comes home, and on our Sweet Pig, there was very few 'sweets' or 'pigs' meaning very little pineapple or ham.  There was also hardly any sauce on the pizza so it was super dry and a thin layer of cheese.  Again, I worked at BJ's and never saw a pizza look like this.  Then, our chocolate cookie for the pizzookie was burnt to a crisp on the outside, and raw on the inside.  What the heck?!   This is not cool ever, but for someone's birthday meal?  I call BJ's and ask to speak to the manager.  I really want to remember his name correctly, I believe it was Mark (he was fairly new and had only worked at BJ's for a few months.)  Mark turned the whole situation around.  He was extremely apologetic and asked us to come into the restaurant as his treat to compensate for this nightmare of an experience.  We worked out the day and time. Came in and was seated.  Our server was very friendly, but pretty slow and forgot several requests (lemons for our ice water, to go boxes etc.)  We touch base with Mark and he did a great job dealing with us.  Meal was on the house and a bit of faith was restored in the Burbank BJ's location.  Good to see it's not going down the tubes 15 years later."
Narek D.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,,1.0,11/18/2016,"What happened to this place?!? Decided to go have lunch here past weekend and I gotta tell you worst experience ever, I used to love this place but now it seems like it's hit rock bottom. Service sucked, food was horrible and took 45 minutes for food to come out server didn't seem to care, after food came out the side dish was missing so didn't get the full order after mentioning it to the server she said they're bringing out and next thing you know they didn't bring the side I order complete different from what I had asked for I didn't even want to bother anymore after that I let it be, after the food I wanted to order dessert server comes and hands me the check which I hadn't asked for yet and when I tried to order dessert ""oh we don't have that today we ran out"" on 3 different desserts I asked for. I won't be coming back here again!"
Rosie G.,"Burbank, CA",0,3,1,2.0,7/23/2017,This place has terrible service.  We were a party of 6 and had to get up to ask for refills.  Never again will we go back to this place.  Lack of help!
Lynsie L.,"Los Angeles, CA",34,23,3,2.0,5/26/2016,"I guess we went on a busy night. Service was slooow. Our waiter was a nice guy but you could tell he was way in over his head. We ordered at 9 and our food didn't come out until 9:50... ridiculous. I have never experienced this, I wanted to cry I was so hungry haha. While we were waiting our waiter didn't even let us know the status of our food so we were just aimlessly waiting. What makes it worse is that people who were sat way after us received their food before us. Infuriating! One of them was a large group too.. they really need to work on their serving techniques here. When it came out the food was good, not worth almost an hour wait though. If you come here, don't come at 9pm on a friday. Also, the Pazookis are a must. Best part of the whole night."
Uncle L.,"VALLEY VILLAGE, CA",228,98,,2.0,3/27/2016,"This place is the very definition of mediocrity as far as eating at any sort of chain restaurant. (Yard house, TGI Fridays, etc) Typical ""wait staff doesn't give a shit,"" sat for 15 minutes before anyone even took our drink order. Another 10 minutes at least til the drinks came. Waitress barely checked on us, didn't see her again til we were ready for the check. (Had to flag her down every time) Food was bland and thrown together; boneless chicken wings looked and tasted like they had come out of a microwave. (They barely took the time to toss them in wing sauce, most of them were half covered) No presentation, no passion whatsoever. Just everything thrown onto plates like you got up at 3am and nuked leftovers, then sat down to watch an episode of Roseanne until ""the spins"" wore off because you drank too much.  The lighting in this place sucks, I don't know why it's so bright. It's a lot of rocks & wood ""ale house"" motif, yet have it lit up like a surgical theater. I don't know why there was a 20 minute wait when easily 1/4 of the restaurant was obviously available for seating, empty tables and even whole sections all over the place. The parking ramp is a nightmare, it's horribly designed and way too small.  Trying to eat out anywhere in LA is just abysmal, the service sucks 90% of the time anywhere you go, because it's people that don't give a shit about their job or the customer service, they're just there until they find something better or get that role in a sitcom they moved here for. This BJ's reeked of that attitude, ""sit down, eat, pay, get the fuck out."" It had all the ambience and passion of a school cafeteria. The one in Canoga Park was always good, but haven't been there in years. This is the 2nd and last time I'll ever eat at the Burbank one."
Michelle L.,"Sylmar, CA",0,5,1,1.0,8/12/2016,"This location is awful! After talking to people about my experience here, I couldn't believe how many other people had problems! I was extremely ripped off and the orders were ALL wrong!! The take out order consisted of 3 burgers and 1 pazookie. I have been to other locations so I knew what to expect. However, the order was not what I was expecting. 2 burgers were ordered with no tomatoes, they both had tomatoes. Some people are allergic to tomatoes. 1 burger was ordered on sourdough. Their ""sourdough"" was regular sandwich bread with grill marks on it! 1 burger was ordered with cheese (which is $1 EXTRA!) and there was NO CHEESE! but we were still charged for it. The pazookie was extremely disappointing. I've had delicious pazookies before so I was very excited to indulge and share it. When I opened the cookie, I was shocked!! The cookie was burnt and tiny!! It was about half the tin which it usually completely fills up. I basically paid $7 for a chips ahoy cookie. I only gave this review a generous 1 star (not that I could give it any less) because the food was still good. I just wish they paid more attention to get it right. So many things went wrong here. Very disappointed in this location."
Johnny J.,"San Mateo, CA",0,6,,1.0,11/12/2016,Horrible fckn service. Took forever for them to tell us that they're out of meatballs. My wife's dinner came out first. About 10 mins after that they finally told us that they're out of meatballs. My daughter and I still waiting for our food. The place wasn't even packed. They had the audacity to charge me full bill?! Fck this place!
Randolph M.,"Burbank, CA",0,5,1,1.0,2/18/2017,"Wasn't expecting this for my damn birthday! All i wanted was a good dinner! Bad service 110% food wasnt cooked well, my plate looks like it was sitting out for a long time! Not satisfied at all! WHAT HAS THIS RESTAURANT BECOME! waiters need to step up their game and take care of their customers and tables regardless how bad theyre busy! Shake my head! Better off eating hot dog from 711 and wouldve enjoyed way better !"
Alysha T.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,51,31,1.0,6/8/2016,"Let's start off the review with how we got seated in a pretty crappy section, right by their extra back door and a servers pos station.  Every other minute a busser, a server on a smoke break, or a customer being directed out by servers. So every 5 seconds the light was shining in on me and my boyfriend face and eyes, the constant door opening and shutting was getting pretty irritating because the light was in and out of our eyes every other second and it was actually getting pretty warm too. OH And the kicker was how loud that table was, the servers literally yelling at the pos station behind my head, the ridiculous noises  coming from outside, and the overall noise of the restaurant. Ok whatever, not that big of a deal right?  My table was sticky, ok still not a big deal.  Our server was polite, and suggested us the queso dip, it came out DELICIOUSSS. What wasn't delicious was the fruit fly/knat that was in it. Ok whatever. It happens. It's a knat, it's tiny it happens when doors get opened. We've all eaten worse. No big deal for me, and this queso dip is the bomb.  We get our I believe it was some sort of guacamole bacon or avocado bacon burger, it was pretty basic nothing special at all, and rather bland to be honest, patty did not seem seasoned with even salt or pepper.  We also had a meat lovers pizza of some sort, also again basic, on the greasy side, and the crust was on the rubbery spectrum of crust, and wasn't delivered with any sort of utensil to actually cut the pizza just our butter knives and forks with our silverware, although servers were constantly behind me not one of them would stop talking to each other long enough to realize I've had my head turned waving my hand in their face asking for some sort of pizza cutter or anything really, that was more helpful to actually cut the pizza.  Once I was finally noticed they sent a server running to grab one she then sliced it for us.  Now desert, the whole reason we all come to BJS right! We now have another server a very awkward, timid server, we basically had to offer ourselves a menu to her, to choose our pizzookies! We got a trio, they sounded amazing and I've eaten at a couple different BJS and have always had the best experiences with their pizzookies,  The only issue was that the cookie was barely luke warm at most on arrival. It reminded me of a sad microwaved Von's cookie that lost any sort of the heat by the time they actually got it to the table.  Kinda bummed, considered still going back for desert again sometime. Until it hit about 10 PM and I felt uncomfortably sick to my stomach, my boyfriend was asleep and woke up around 12 AM feeling exactly the same, and now I'm sure we will NOT GO BACK to this location whatsoever and possibly the chain as a whole because of how bad this experience was, during, and after.  You would think with SEVERAL quality restaurants in the area and a couple opening with outstanding reputations, they would really amp up the service and standards."
Elizabet M.,"Pacoima, Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,10/24/2017,"I have not been to BJs in a while and this Sunday I remembered why..... they were not busy surprisingly but as the 2 1/2 hour outing proved I was slowly reminded why I stopped going. I went with my 2 kids and mom for a late Sunday lunch around 2:30. My kids order tenders and a pizza and of coarse they wanted cheese sticks. My mom asked for a cup of soup and shrimp tacos, I asked for a sandwich. We waited 30 minutes for the appetizer and soup on top of that my moms food was wrong waited about 45 minutes for my kids food and an HOUR for my sandwich and my moms tacos that they brought wrong..... my moms soup came cold BOTH times and we had to flag down a waiter in a group of servers talking and joking with someone that seemed to work there but was off the clock to get a refill on our drinks we waited 20 minutes for these refills. My youngest daughter did not like the pizza so I had to order solders for her.... not only did it take another 35 minutes but the server brought it in a to go plate knowing that we were waiting so could eat. This was just the beginning.... the server was nice about it and it was ok. Our total came out to 55.37. My mom gave 20 cash and I told the server he could put the rest on my card. Well I checked my account today and I was charged THREE times! One for the total 55.37, the second for 20.00 and the third for 34.37 I was furious because they didn't even tell me. I called Monday to speak to a manager to see what happens only to be placed on long holds both times I called. I kept getting cut off while I was trying to tell the manager what happens because he said he knew what happened.. really?? Nope never again worse service ever what a shame."
Dro E.,"Glendale, CA",0,24,2,3.0,10/30/2016,"Ok i'm confused about this place! Got here on Saturday at 1 pm. As soon as i turned into bjs parking lot 1 man rushed into my car trying to grab my car. I could guess it was the valet parking guy but if you guys have self-parking there, don't assume whoever comes in is going to leave his car there and let you park it! Maybe he can park himself! Please teach your workers to not kill themselves for $5 tip!!!! Then he made me feel bad that i dont wanna give him my car! Afterwards, he started talking to his coworkers and both were staring at me!!!such an idiot! Our waiter was nice! Little tooo extra nice that we could feel how fake he is but still better than other workers! I ordered a classic cheese burger which you couldn't find on the menu but the waiter said ""i got you."" Later on i found out what ""i got you"" really means! I got a burger with only the meet! And took them another 6-7 minutes to add the rest on the burger while the meat was cold when i got it back! In addition, he kept asking us if we want any desert! 3 times! Wtf!!! My gf felt really bad so did 3 stars only because he told us stupid jokes and made us laugh."
