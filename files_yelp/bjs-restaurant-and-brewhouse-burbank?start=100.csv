Darylynn D.,"Los Angeles, CA",132,1705,7771,4.0,10/28/2015,"BJs is known for their beers, pizza and pizooke.  I usually get the Great White Pizza because of all the toppings.  Sometimes I'll try the Sweet Pig or Barbeque Chicken Pizza when I'm feeling dangerous.  The White Chocolate Macademia Nut Pizooke is full of good fatness.  I know they have Salted Caramel and Peanut Butter S'mores, but I can't venture away from the Macadamia .   I know when I come here there is always something new to try and I know I'm never disappointed.  The place can get busy on Friday's and Saturday's so be prepared to wait.   They offer valet or self-parking on top of the structure."
April A.,"Granada Hills, CA",0,3,,3.0,7/6/2017,"In my opinion food wasn't that great, only their dessert was good. I recommend only going for their dessert."
J J.,"Toluca Lake, Los Angeles, CA",4,202,165,2.0,12/26/2016,So if you are going to come here prepare to wait over an hour for your food on a busy day. Service was good but the again the wait is horrendous especially if you have hungry kids. I would think a big chain restaurant would remedy problems like this with there kitchen backed up. Well I guess this is why I haven't been here in over 5 years and won't be coming back anytime soon.
Renee B.,"San Diego, CA",1,5,,1.0,8/19/2017,"Do not use curbside takeout. This feature is completely useless. You will probably have better luck calling in your order, or better yet, come in to order your Togo food."
Rita A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,5,1.0,12/26/2016,"WORST SERVICE first off !  She was kind but the orders were messed up , forgot two of my items I specifically wanted , we waited for the food for over and hour! The utensils were DIRTY . Bria was the server , she was disrespectful after we told her something ,she ignored us practically the whole night ..I saw her talking about us to all the other waiters which is very unprofessional. We finally had the manager come to our table she was sweet and convinced us it wouldn't happen again, she gave some sort of discount but I didn't care I was still disappointed"
Mish S.,"Long Beach, CA",380,500,678,2.0,1/26/2017,"The service today was so incredibly poor. Our waitress was so unprofessional. Firstly, she was not informative about the happy hour menu and seemed annoyed when we asked her about it. Secondly, she took our friends orders but did not take ours when we were all clearly sitting at one table until we called her back after she disappeared so it was awkward waiting an extra 15 mins for our food after our friend's already came out. They had to wait and by the time our food came there was freezing cold.  She was abrasive and blunt and did not make us feel welcome at all.  Not only was the annoying error of not checking if the entire group had ordered a pain, but she did not push for our orders to come out first when the restaurant was empty and we ordered before everyone else, yet everyone's food came out before ours: also did I mention that we ordered tiny appetizers?  It should not have take the length of around 30 mins that it did for our food. The bill even with happy hour came out to be a hefty $65, with everyone ordering one appetizer each and a drink (not all alcoholic).  I love BJ's but their happy hour deals are not worth it, and this waitress definitely needs retraining. She ruined our dining experience and upset our friends with her uncaring behavior.  I love BJ's dependable and variety filled menu and their quality of food, but with these type of inconsistent servers it's hard to return."
Henrik k.,"Glendale, CA",42,18,34,1.0,10/29/2016,"In Burbank, Ca.  Waited 45 minutes for our food. This sucked! Two inpatient hungry kids. I asked for the check for the beer and salad we ordered. I wasn't gonna wait anymore. Manager took care of the bill except for the beer. Supposedly we were 2nd up for the food."
Ivy S.,"Los Angeles, CA",896,147,,5.0,10/16/2016,I love this place!!!!! This past weekend was my first time here and it's one of my new favorite restaurants. The pizza was great and the Oreo pizookie was like tasting a spoonful of heaven. Our server was Stephen F (according to the credit card slip) and he was fantastic!!!! Usually the service at chain restaurants is really bad but he was on top of everything from start to finish! It was seriously a breath of fresh air!!!!! Did I mention I LOVE IT HERE!!!!
Luis G.,"Burbank, CA",8,10,3,5.0,6/14/2017,I always happen to find my way to BJ's during the NBA finals and I'm never disappointed. The happy hour specials are pretty good and the service is attentive. My only complaint is the parking but there's nothing we can do about that.
Doc S.,"Burbank, CA",3,48,14,1.0,6/27/2017,"Trying to get seated and or served is much like waiting for it to rain in Hades!!  The service is absolutely horrible, combined with lousy attitudes.  Time to give notice to the current ""management"" team and bring on some folks that actually understand customer service!!  Food has also suffered mightily over the past few years.  Maybe the cooks should join the management team exodus!!!"
Jen R.,"Corona, CA",0,29,87,3.0,2/22/2017,This place is packed that we have to wait for a big party. We seated outside and it's better to stay away from the hustle and bustle inside the restaurant and that was nice. Food was good but not too crazy for it. Parking is a mess though.
Morpheus V.,"Burbank, CA",0,1,,1.0,4/29/2017,"My 14yr old daughter warned us, only I thought she was just upset that we weren't going to her choice of restaurant. This place was the nightmare you always hear about,  but have yet to experience. Where do I start? After a 30 minute wait, we were seated in the upper corner of the place. The waiter was a nice guy, attentive to entering our order. I assume he entered the selections correctly on his tablet device,  but it started with my daughter getting a strawberry lemonade when she asked for a regular lemonade. She's particularly self conscious about attention and makes it clear, even though it's wrong, ""it's fine."" Our order staggered to the table, yet one thing after another was wrong. My burger was cold and lacked the normal amount of mayonnaise and also the tomatoes I requested on it. Mayo lettuce tomato and cheese is simple, yet their kitchen showed that they could screw it up on another level. Then came the pizza we ordered, oh wait, the delivery person, not our waiter,  gave us someone else's pizza. Our waiter came over and took it back. About 10 minutes later,  the waiter was heading our way with what appeared to be our actual pizza. Somewhere on the stairs up, the pizza dropped to the floor just 15 feet away from our table. He apologize and said they would get working on a new one. By the time we were eating it, most of the place had left for the night. In the end, the $13 burgers sucked. The baked Ziti was bland and left much to be desired. The right pizza took FOREVER. AND it seems that the management was like a absent landlord. After the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant,  there was zero contact about how they would make it right. How can management be this oblivious to such horrible service? Instead we received our bill which exceeded $90, zero courtesy credit for the messed up order or the complete inconvenience of the pizza issue, or the horrible burgers. Go here at your own peril. But don't say I didn't warn you.  We on the other hand, will avoid it and share our experience with friends and family, most who, like us, live here in Burbank, California.  If you like to have customers,  you should appreciate them enough to own your horrific service, and make things right with them. Otherwise,  like us, they will walk away,  and start running as soon as they hit the doors to the outside."
John F.,"Alhambra, CA",58,106,154,3.0,10/6/2016,"I just simply love the atmosphere in his particular location. I've been here years back and finally decided to come back again. SERVICE:8/10 Patrick our server was absolutely friendly and welcoming , not to mention he was attentive and understood when I said I had a Yelp coupon for 10$ off of 35$. FOOD: 7/10 The food is just standard American food which was decent but nothing to be amazed about. I ordered the hickory brisket burger 3/5 the patty was a bit dry and my bacon was burnt. My girlfriend ordered the meatball and spaghetti 3.5/5 pretty standard stuff they did not make a mistake on it. We also ordered the best beginnings combo which was very delicious 4/5. OVERALL: 7/10 Service and food landed a solid 3 stars would recommend anyone to come by to grab yourself a drink and watch sports. $10 off 35$ is a pretty sweet deal."
Robert S.,"Van Nuys, CA",30,11,1,2.0,7/17/2017,"Waited a long time for our food.  The drinks were bland. They had no taste at all and I rather go to seven eleven for drinks. I just didn't dig it, but the server did burn his hand though. Second degree burns he a tru soldier"
Bertboogie J.,"North Hollywood, CA",112,17,2,2.0,7/14/2017,"Food was ok. They could have at least paid attention to the quality of the food the served. Service was not that great. Dropped off the food, dropped off more napkins and never heard from the server again until it was time to pay."
Heather F.,"Bakersfield, CA",192,204,435,5.0,4/13/2016,"After a day of rosebowl shopping  and then ikea shopping it's dinner time . Kids ordered chicken tenders and fresh fruit.  I ordered chicken wrap which I have to say was YUMMY. Then to top it off had to have the hot and delicious cookie. Service was great . There really is g anything bad I could say about his place, just that it was quick to seat even being by freeway entrance . We will come back here since we shop a lot at IKEA   Sorry a short review but it was yummy yummy"
Harmony L.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",337,301,156,5.0,4/1/2016,"My friend and I ordered the Mozzarela Sticks, Lemon Thyme Chicken, Fire Roasted Barbacoa Chicken, and of course, their pizookie trio (Monkey Bread, White Choco Macademia Nut, and Salted Caramel all with Vanilla Ice Cream).  The sticks were perfect, so stringy :) The Lemon Thyme Chicken might be my favorite dish. It's healthy, great portion size, and great flavors. The pizookies were obviously amazing; a major reason I come here...just super sweet, especially the monkey bread. Gotta eat it fast before the ice cream melts!"
Jen N.,"Henderson, NV",124,473,969,5.0,6/23/2015,"This weekend was our first time at a BJ's Brewhouse. Definitely will not be the last. Their food was excellent.  My husband and I got the California Chicken Club, with bacon, avocado, swiss, lettuce, tomato, roasted garlic mayo and grilled sourdough. The sourdough tasted like garlic bread, and there was a lot of avocado. Very flavorful. My in-laws both go the Lemon Thyme chicken, with herb roasted chicken breast, seasoned brown rice, sautéed red bell peppers, tomatoes , roasted brussel sprouts in a lemon thyme sauce. They could not get over how flavorful this was, and actually ordered this twice in two days.  *Lunch version comes with one piece of chicken, whereas the entrée is $2 more and comes with two pieces. On our second day, my husband and I got the Tavern Cut Pizza 'Cantina Chicken' with Alfredo sauce, grilled chicken breast,  green chilies, cilantro, their signature 5 cheese blend as well as Jack cheese and Cheddar. This was much bigger than I thought that it would be. The flavors were excellent. I was worried about the green chilies, but they gave a nice tang to the pizza. I would order this again in an instant.  Shannon was our waitress on the second day, and she was hilarious. Very personable, and funny."
Diego H.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,12,54,5.0,10/2/2016,"The steak here rocks, the tomato bisque is breathtaking.Also the calamari is great to. But the root beer tastes amazing, it's practically enough to make a grown man cry."
A L.,"Torrance, CA",0,4,,1.0,10/23/2016,"For the past 5 years I've enjoyed the atmosphere, food & service from this restaurant chain.  I've been to many locations and the customer service was great.  I've been among the many that have waited over 30min to be seated; because we knew everything else from that point would be great.  Until I went to this location on a Saturday night. I was seated outside quickly which was great. My server asked me for my order, which we started of with water & drinks.  And then.....we waited.  We waited over 20min to get our water. It wasn't until I went to look for my server, and another server visited us that we finally got some water, and then 2min later, our drinks. While I know weekends are busy it shouldnt take 20mins to at least get water.  We were told the manager would be over...but whoever that was never showed.  So i took 3 sips of my water, 5 sips of my drink, paid the check and left.  Our original server apologized for the bars delay and didn't show any accountability. No manager visited either.  Disappointed customer who will NOT return to this location. I went to another restaurant later and completed my dinner; which provided great customer service and got a nice tip."
