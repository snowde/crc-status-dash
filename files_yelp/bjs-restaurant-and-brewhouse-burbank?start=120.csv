Fred M.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,8,,3.0,2/23/2017,Food taste good.  But the service is bad.  We ware a group of 13. Half of us got our food 1hr faster than the rest.  We got the appetizer after our food
Robert R.,"Glendale, CA",1,6,,1.0,5/14/2017,"Soooo, I gave BJ's one last try. I already gave up on the Glendale location as their service was well below standards. I had already visited the Burbank location and thought it was struggling with the customer service too, but decided I'd meet up with a buddy to have a couple of beers and an appetizer. Wouldn't you know it. It took 45 minutes to get Chicken lettuce wraps. That's only after reminding the bartender that we placed an order over a half an hour ago. And chicken lettuce wraps are an appetizer!! Scoop some chicken, slap it on the plate with some lettuce and serve it! Heavens forbid if we dare order an entree. We'd be there at closing time eating. One bartender to cover that entire bar plus table drinks. This is a joke. I'm done. Never again!"
Kira P.,"Los Angeles, CA",185,79,186,5.0,9/30/2015,"My husband and decided to go to BJ'S last night because it was Free Pizookie Day. When we arrived we found out there was a 20 minute wait. (Which was to be expected on this momentous day) As it was, the main bar was full so we had to wait. My husband got antsy 10 minutes into our wait and decided to explore the restaurant... and he found a second bar! (There is actually another bar inside the restaurant area) We asked the host and he said yes, we can seat ourselves at that bar as well. Once seated we were greeted by Rebecca who said,  ""Thanks for deciding to join me tonight guys."" Right away we knew we had made the right choice. Her bright smile, welcoming personality, and charisma made us feel right at home. While perusing the menu I couldn't find the stuffed baked potatoes. Rebecca assured me that they do still have then on the menu, they are just on the lunch menu now. I was elated, since I had been craving that dish for weeks, and was looking forward to finally getting to go to BJ's so I could have it.   Throughout our meal Rebecca was very attentive and always there whenever we needed anything.  Towards the end of our meal we overheard a regular asking our server how she liked married life. So when she returned to our table we inquired if she is newly married? She told us that she just got married in May. We informed her our wedding was just 3 weeks ago. We congratulated eachother and it was a bonding moment. All in all, the food was delicious, our food came out very fast, the service was excellent, and the Pizookie was the icing on the cake (so to speak).  Thank you BJ's for making our date night truly special!  To ensure our compliments get to the right place I feel it necessary to include information that might help.  0490 Table 652 Rebecca 30 SvrCk: 12 9:10p 9/29/15"
Ian A.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,18,3,2.0,9/11/2016,"Whatever you do, don't sit at the bar.  Each time that my wife and I come here, the service is horrible.  The two women on the weekend are the worst.   First, they take for ever to ask if you like a drink or something to order off the menu.  One of the reasons it seems is that the bartenders are cleaning massive amounts of cups, pouring drinks for the entire restaurant and they are balancing the register.  I think if management were to actually think about how much the bartenders are doing, they would staff accordingly.  Right now as I type this, my wife and I waited for our desert for 15 minutes and the bartender never checked on us.  We had to flag her down.  In fact, she walks by each person and never asks if they need anything. This isn't the first time and this place must be Union.  The bartenders must be dishwashers and janitors, bc all they do is clean and never ask if anyone needs anything.   Please staff one extra person or go over what service should mean.  The BJ's in HB and Tustin are much better."
Rob C.,"Lake View Terrace, Los Angeles, CA",0,40,4,1.0,6/25/2017,"We go in ask for a cool spot sit. The AC IS BARELY working! Snooty waiter ignores us , then after a bit tells us the table is not part of the bar so we have to check in. I do hostess says no problem, five minutes later we told we must move! No I guess the money we were spending was not important to them! Manners gang manners!"
A M.,"Montebello, CA",0,3,2,1.0,7/19/2017,Worst BJ's ever. The service was awful. I ordered a medium rare steak and it came 30 minutes late and so over cooked and dry. We didn't leave a tip because of the rude service and awful food. Gonna skip on BJ's from now on.
Anton N.,"Redondo Beach, CA",4,11,,2.0,10/18/2016,"Oh BJ's. For some reason you are very consistent at pretty bad service.  I went with a couple and warned one of them to prepare for bad service. We called ahead, then arrived and were asked to wait 15 to 20 minutes. So much for calling ahead. When it hit about 20 minutes I told the hostess we called ahead and had been waiting for a while. Nothing other than they completely screwed up; and if I did not ask we probably would never had been seated. Food is always pretty good on another side, but to add to this they screwed up my simple order as well :-)."
Kermit T.,"Burbank, CA",0,26,1,1.0,7/16/2017,It shouldnt take 2 hours for a meal. Not the first time either here. Always takes forever and something always comes out wrong. I used to work for them in Seal Beach in the 90s and they were great... What happened?
Sharee I.,"Long Beach, CA",39,44,14,5.0,7/1/2017,We stopped in on the Friday night around 9:30 p.m. . We were seated pretty quickly. We are the drinks in our food or waiter got it to us pretty quickly within 10 minutes we had our order and our dinner on the table. food was delicious Vibe was great.
Niat A.,"Oakland, CA",0,5,,3.0,4/19/2017,I ordered the brew house burger which was yummy. My mother on the other hand ordered the Peruvian quinoa bowl with shrimp and that was super dry and flavorless. Overall average chain restaurant
Elaine P.,"Winnetka, Los Angeles, CA",48,148,607,5.0,9/3/2015,"I was wary of coming here due to the recent reviews, but I got the opposite experience. Went here Monday night for a farewell dinner. Parking is free and it's a 2-3 story lot next to the restaurant. It's fairly busy even on a Monday, but we were seated quickly.  Our server was the nicest guy ever. Friendly demeanor, patient, and didn't get our orders wrong (argh! I wish I remembered his name to give him credit!). When he found out that it was a reunion, farewell, and late bday celebration all in one, he was like ""I usually don't do this but..."" When someone says that, you can't help but be curious. He offered to make us a 'pizookie platter'. What is that you ask? Well, I'll just say, It's a monster. It's 4 cookie flavors in a large pizza pan topped with a mountain of ice cream. None of us could finish it (I regret nothing! NOTHING!). Other than our main waiter, other servers were nice and helpful when we asked them to take pictures of us. Our main food and drinks were great, no complaints there. Get the fish and chips (extra tartar) and the berry cider (Jerry Berry, I think it's called). All in all, a great place to bring a small group of friends. The customer service made the memories all the more sweeter (hah! I'll shut up now.)."
Melanie W.,"Studio City, CA",378,25,101,1.0,8/18/2016,"We came here last weekend and once again regretted it.  I'm not one to complain but sometimes you can become so annoyed and disappointed with a place that you really should say something. When we walked in it was pretty empty and quiet with tons of tables open in the front and back.  There are two separate desk areas in the entrance.  One was empty and the other had three people behind it talking. You could tell that they weren't servers because of their attire.  We stood there as they continued to talk and ignore us and waited until I tried to get their attention.  Someone suggested that we could sit at the bar table tops for happy hour if we would like and we declined because we wanted to sit more comfortably than teetering on some tall stools with tables. More confused conversations ensued and they asked if we would like to sit in the back of the restaurant and we requested to sit in one of the booth areas near the front. They told us that we would have to wait until the hostess returned to seat us and 'make sure that it was 'okay' so we sat down and waited. We were the only two people waiting to be seated.  Five minutes later (finally) this extremely busy hostess in this empty restaurant showed up and asked us if we wanted to sit in 'happy hour' and again we said no thank you can we please sit in the front and she said that's happy hour and I asked about the booths and many tables beside the happy hour and that's when she said I'll have to ask someone first and then she asked  'Would you like to sit in the back?' REALLY?  Seriously? Umm, no.  1st thing-We already had this conversation with someone else   2nd -that's where you should put large parties and families or for when they have a fully packed restaurant. Why would you put a couple of two in the back of a very big empty restaurant? Especially if they already asked to be seated in a different section already. It's insulting. Listen, I know the drill.  You have servers in certain areas and it's your job to farm tables for sections and their servers. I get it, but don't put guilt trips on customers because they don't want to sit there and try to make them feel like they are being difficult.  Unacceptable. Smile and say of course. Next we get our waitress who was a bit intense.  She seemed irritated or something. We ordered chicken wings as an appetizer (they never came out) our server didn't even notice until after our salads and we were eating our meal. (Another thing that I would like to mention here is that the wait staff doesn't even bring the food to your table and I know that's common now and I get it-but the waiter or waitress should always come over and make sure everything is thumbs up) Plus how can you be soooooo busy when you don't even have to bring out the food???  Seriously?  I just don't understand.  I was a waitress in one of the busiest restaurants in town. She was nowhere to be found 95% of the time. When she finally realized it she said 'you still want those wings right?' and I said 'no, it's okay' and she got irritated and huffed off.  This brings me to the food. Every meal that I've had has always been sub-par.  Everything tastes very bland and mass produced.  There's not a lot of love in what they serve, or a very good palate. The selection (book) menu doesn't feel right.  It's way too large and Overwhelming-while the food is Underwhelming. The golden rule is don't try to do everything just do some things really well.  Anyway, it was my man's birthday and still trying to make the best of the situation we ordered the cookie with ice cream. I think they call it a Pizookie?? it came out hard as a rock.  You couldn't even put a fork in it.  It was terrible.  The whole experience was terrible. Like a bad dream. The hostess was difficult.  The waitress was difficult and the food doesn't cut it.  Their only saving grace is their beer selection. I'm not going to name our server because I don't want to point her out specifically-but her attitude stinks.  Maybe one of the managers will note that she was working the front bar and seating area last Friday.  Maybe she was in a bad mood that day but who cares? not us when we're trying to have a nice dinner. I've worked in two different restaurants and the first rule is to leave your emotions at the door. especially if you want to make money. Her attitude is affecting your business because we won't be coming back.  Any suggestion that I would have is to change your staff or do some retraining and remind them that they are in customer service. They seem to be more preoccupied in conversations with co workers and giving attitude more than making a pleasurable dining experience. Also try to make a better smaller menu. We go to dinner three times a week and we've given this place more than a few tries and this was our last. We aren't returning but I'm hoping that someone within the company will read this and make some severely necessary changes to this restaurant. Good luck!"
Jeannie M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,4/20/2017,"I came here with my nephew on a Thursday around 9:30. There was a 15 minute wait which is about what we expected. They weren't that busy, so I wasn't expecting the horrible service we got.   Our appetizer came but we didn't have plates so I asked the gentleman if he could bring us some. He passed us up two times before I finally asked him again. He apologized and said he'd be right back. We never saw him at our table again. About 5 min later the food came. We ended up just starting everything at the same time.   My nephew ordered a burger, and when the waitress finally came back ( We hadn't seen her since she took our order) he asked for ketchup. By the time it showed up he had finished his fries, and his burger was cold.   She walked away before he could ask for a refill so he sat through his meal without one. Noticing this I made sure to go easy on my iced tea.  After we were done we sat there for about 10 min longer before the guy who forgot our plates noticed us and walked to the back. Coincidentally our waitress emerged and asked if we needed refills.  I told her we needed a refill and some boxes because we just wanted to leave.    She came back another 10 minutes later to take our plates and ask if we needed anything else and 5 min later she dropped the check. My nephew burst into laughter when she came back for the check because that was done in under 2 minutes.   I get it. I was a waiter for over 10 yrs, and sometimes you get busy. This was not that situation.  Nobody in that place gave a crap, and management was nowhere to be found.    I left a tip because they have to pay taxes, but I'll be damned if I go back to that place."
Briana N.,"Sunland, CA",2,49,5,1.0,6/11/2017,Terrible service! We asked to order rite away as our party was hungry and knew what they wanted. We were there for TWO HOURS!!! It took forever for our food to come and anything else we asked for. Will never come to this location again.
Marissa B.,"Burbank, CA",16,103,22,1.0,3/4/2017,"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. I contacted the restaurant Friday to schedule a reservation for 10 people Saturday. Some snotty a-hole answered the phone, put me on hold first then told me to call back in the morning. When I asked if reservations were possible he said, ""call back in the morning"" and hung up. I reluctantly called back today and was told to hold while the person who answered transferred me to a manager. I asked for an explanation, ""why did I need a manager?"" He said they were booked, I asked what their reservation policy was? He said typically you have to reserve a day prior or days prior. I explained I had attempted to reserve and was told to call the next morning. At least this person was a bit more helpful but still a ridiculous attempt to book reservation. Bottom line, this is shitty customer service and now my party of 10 will take their business elsewhere"
Daniel R.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,6,,1.0,8/6/2017,"I swear i am never going to BJ's ever again not only did i found egg shells in my pasta but the service was terrible. I use to go with a couple of friends every once in a while and when i did go we would usually get ignored by our own server because he is way too focused on the bigger party next to us. Mind you i always tip 15 percent and i always try to be polite because i use to worked in the food industry but the people working at BJ's lack proper training. Not only do they ignore you but the one time i go with my family to celebrate a few day after my sister graduation they made us wait a hour for our food because the system went down and instead of apologizing the server had the guts to tell my cousin waiting a 1 hour and 30 min for a party of eight is the norm and gave a lot of attitude when we ask when is our food was coming. Not only did the food came late but it was also cold. To stop us from leaving the manager promised us to give us a pizookie on our next visit instead of there and now and when we asked if we can get a coupon or a written agreement he told us he told us he would honor his word and when we did come back he lied to our faces and said he does not remember that and played ignorant till we left. All in all the service is terrible unless your in a big party, the manager is a liar, and the food is not even that great it comes out lacking flavor, cold, and might have egg shells in it. BJ is expensive for no good reason when the service is terrible and the food is not even that great. Congrats to BJ's for not only losing a customer but everyone i am associated with."
Melanie D.,"Los Angeles, CA",306,946,1535,3.0,2/25/2015,"This review is for BJ's beer dinner event. Several times per year, BJ's holds beer dinners, highlighting a special brewery. This time it was Rogue Brewery from Oregon. The dinner is 4 courses with 8 different beers to try - 6 from Rogue and 2 beers that they brew themselves. The cost is $30 advanced purchase, $35 on the day of the event. They started with the lightest brew (good chit pilsner - yes, that's the name!) and progressed to the richest one (double chocolate stout). They served a variety of ales in between. Each beer pour was about 6 oz, so drinking a full 8 of them would have been way too much. They were very generous with their pours (sometimes offering seconds), and it was nice to be able to taste so many different beers. Unfortunately, the food was lackluster and boring. They started with 2 appetizers - crispy, fried artichokes and chicken tavern-cut (thin crust) pizza. The entree was cajun pasta. The apps were tasty enough but nothing special. The entree was horribly bland with a minimal amount of chicken and overcooked pasta. Dessert was an individual sized peanut butter pizookie (basically a big chewy cookie) topped with vanilla ice cream. If you like their pizookie, this is right up your alley.  The amount of beers to try was impressive, but the food left a lot to be desired. I'm glad I tried it, but unless they elevate the food, it will be my last beer dinner here. parking -limited free self parking or valet"
Regina P.,"Burbank, CA",16,70,48,2.0,2/8/2016,"BJ's has really declined in their service and quality of their food.  On this particular visit, my dad ordered a steak to be well-done and was shocked to see how raw the meat was (I posted a photo). At first, he tried to forget about it and dunk the pieces in some A1, but the texture was chewy and tasted bloody. So, as you can imagine, it was difficult to swallow. I called to speak with a manager and I was surprised by the lack of reaction to my dad's raging red steak. He tried to be reassuring by insisting that my dad was always welcome to have his meal sent back to the kitchen to be fixed. I explained to the manager that my father was a diabetic and couldn't wait for the restaurant to get things right on their second, or perhaps, third try.  I didn't appreciate the direction of our interaction. I felt as though the manager was simply shrugging off the incident as something that happens sometimes, instead of taking full accountability and apologizing on behalf of their error. Although I made it clear that there was no excuse for the raw steak, it still felt like taking it off the bill was pulling teeth for this guy, (though it should have been a no-brainer).  It's unbelievable what customer service has become. I feel like this restaurant needs to be more willing to take responsibility for their mishaps and not try to smooth things over by offering a free pizookie. You can't buy a consumer's loyalty with a hot cookie and vanilla bean ice cream, even if it does sound tempting.  Simply apologizing and not making excuses for your staff's error would've sufficed. Speaking up about the quality of food being sub-par shouldn't be taken lightly. My parents don't go out to eat much and they shouldn't have to settle or wait forever for the staff to get it right."
Myra L.,"Sun Valley, CA",5,10,,5.0,12/28/2016,"Drove in from Las Vegas and was greated with enthusiastic and friendly faces. We were seated immediately and our waitress was very informative on the specials and what was the most popular dishes. Our daughter was a bit fussy but our waitress, Amanda, was very patient and kind. The meal was delicious and the experience was worth it.  We wil be back, especially for the pizookie.  Thank You Amanda, you're such a gem."
Ardi M.,"Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, CA",229,4,,1.0,3/25/2017,"Went in around 11:15 pm last night. Waited almost 45 min to get a cold pizza that wasn't even made right. On top of that the manager tried to compensate us for our time by ""rushing out"" another pizza which took 30 min. Our server said that our manager is going to ""hook you guys up"" on the bill when all they did was deduct the first pizza which was supposed to be replaced regardless cause it didn't even taste like a bqq chicken pizza. I go to the Woodland Hills location at least minimum once a month and when I compare the 2 it's pathetic as to how disgusting the customer service was from both the server and manager. Manager was a small short middle eastern looking woman. I hope other people don't have to go through what I went through last night."
