Sean W.,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",7,13,1,3.0,4/15/2017,"Sunny day, 130p. Burbank. Pull into BJs driveway. Valet blocking road. We know the top of the structure is wide open so we pass paying $4.50.  Walk into BJs, empty. Empty like a Kmart on... any day.  Sit at the bar where we are told service should be even faster, however, that was a big lie. Nice server, very chatty, but slow on delivery. The Bingo partners next to us also complained about their service.  On our walk out we thanked the greeters, responded to ourselves, twice, and walked out - not hearing a peep.  If you like beer, recommend."
Frank S.,"Los Angeles, CA",85,46,6,5.0,6/11/2017,"We came here during dinner service. There was a problem with their system so every orders were delayed. We waited almost an hiur just to get our food. However, the waitress and the manager was very accomodating; they told us the reason why everything was late. Because we got our food really late, they gave us a big discount; which was really awesome. The customer service was reallt phenomenal. The food was also good."
Hayk I.,"Glendale, CA",220,2,,1.0,7/14/2017,"Decent deep dish pizza, but somebody PLEASE teach these so called bartenders how to pour a pint of Guinness. I've been back many times with coworkers because of location, but last night's stale beer was the last straw for me. Won't be returning."
Cheri S.,"Camarillo, CA",56,10,2,1.0,6/9/2017,"Serving half the table , then serving the rest of the table a half hour later is BS. What the H?????"
Jason R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,5,1.0,2/18/2017,"wow what can i say! only rating 1 starr because i cant put 0.  get to the restaurant with a party of 10, on a saturday night. get sat down rather fast about 15-20 mins. take our waiter about another 10 mins to get or drinks which i thought was weird. he takes our order it took over an  hour to bring the food.  aside from it taking over an hour for our food everyone around us that got there after us got their food first. the food was also cold. i ordered a guacamole bacon burger and our waiter asked how i wanted my patty and i said well done. when i got my burger it was so pink i asked him to take the burger back and not bring me anything. it is by far the worst service i have ever received from a restaurant.  food was cold, waiter was attentive,worst birthday my friend has ever spent. waiter didnt want to give his name when we asked for it. it said ryan on the receipt."
Edythe M.,"Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",78,31,16,5.0,5/15/2017,"Their BBQ drop dish of sooooo fire!   Never disappointed with anything from pizza, to pasta or chicken dishes.  Even their entree salads are on point."
Whippet G.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,10,,3.0,6/13/2017,"I really do enjoy their diverse menu and food, but never go there if you are in a hurry! I went there an hour and 15 minutes before I planned to catch a movie at the AMC.  I only ordered an appetizer and a salad, and it took them AN HOUR to bring them to me. I was literally getting up to leave and cancel my order when the food finally arrived.  So, the server took the app off my bill (because it was the cheaper of the two) and put my salad in a to-go box. I attended the movie hungry, and very annoyed. PS Nobody wants to eat a leftover soggy salad! I still gave them 3 Stars because when I do have unlimited time to devote to dining out, the food is great! Those servers must be perpetually slammed, because it's  always the slowest service in town!"
Jazmine G.,"Sun Valley, CA",26,43,47,5.0,5/12/2016,"I was here about one week ago we came just to have some good dinner and to our surprise it was surprisingly on point. I hadn't been here in a while so I didn't know what to expect. My fiance got a bison burger, I on the other hand was craving clam chowder but for some reason I went with the bacon brisket burger which was delicious btw,I have not had such a good burger in so long. We also got calamari has an appetizer because that's always good and of course my boyfriend couldn't say no to some good beers and a triple chocolate Pizookie. Janice was really nice, great customer service."
Johanna M.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,6,8,1.0,3/4/2017,Worst place to eat. Service sucks. Especially on a Saturday. All the tables get waited.  But if I got here first where's my food. Maybe it doesn't help that you ask who's your waiter. No water offered upon arrival. The impression I got being from out of town is. Don't come here so bad. No appetizer even though it was ordered. Food came kinda cold. And we'll after telling the waiter no appetizer just food. I did get a free desert. But was gonna order one anyways. At least my date had a better mood then mines.
Joe E.,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",849,385,1240,2.0,12/30/2014,"It's kind of silly to write a review that is only highlighting lunch specials. A chicken quesadilla and chicken tacos. Each served with a side of black beans and 3 tortilla chips. 3. Coming in at around 6 dollars a piece, what is there to complain about? It's just that the tacos were so dry it was almost inedible. The quesadilla was mostly crispy tortilla. If you're going to have lunch specials, at least make them good. Next time we drive by all I will think about is the blah food we had last time.  On the bright side, the beer was 3.50 a pint. Their IPA is pretty tasty if you're a fan of the West Coast style. Service also wasn't bad. But it wasn't great either. Parking is valet so bring some singles."
Robert L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,25,23,3.0,3/5/2017,got here and the place was jam-packed. After a 40 minute wait we were seated. 20 minutes later we got to order and another half hour before our food was delivered. To top it off all the food was cold
Erika M.,"Prosper, TX",1,11,,1.0,3/9/2017,This was terrible food.  I had the deep dish mini pizza.  Something on the pizza tasted soured.  The thin crust pizza was also not good.  My husband said the gluten free pizza was actually pretty good.  Overall it was way below average and not worth your hard earned dollars.
Christel L.,"Murrieta, CA",572,641,1647,3.0,2/4/2015,"We were in the area and I had a BJ's gift card, so we came here for lunch. Wanting a little sun, we opted to sit on the patio rather than the dimly lit restaurant so the seating was quick. We ordered a couple of lunch specials and drinks. The food (personal pizza, salad, sandwich) was your standard BJ's quality food. Wedge salad, potato wedges, chicken tenders, and of course the small pizookie were good, but the pulled pork sandwich didn't have enough sauce on it. From this visit I've now noted that they've gotten on board with smaller drink portions, so I got a half pint of their Berry Burst Cider since it was still midday.  The service was fine albeit laggy, but put me on the list of others who have issues with their valet parking. Being first time visitors, we pulled into the lot thinking the only option was valet because of their sign. If we knew self parking was also an option we would have tried that first, or at least nearby parking. Instead, we shelled out an extra $4 and change because they specifically encourage gratuity."
Britta G.,"Los Angeles, CA",518,243,403,4.0,1/24/2015,"I know BJ's is one of those chains that everyone knows about, but I'll write a review anyways!  I personally love this specific BJ's because it's so huge. You never have to wait for a table. I'm also a fan of the layout. There are a few different rooms so it doesn't feel like you are surrounded by people.  I've gotten so many things here, but I would say the ""Great White"" pizza is my absolute favorite. The personal size is perfect. I don't even like deep dish pizza but I just love it.  ALL of the appetizers are phenomenal. You really can't go wrong. My favorite is the pepperoni pizza dip though. I've made pizza dip before with basically the same ingredients and it's no where near as good as theirs.  This really goes without saying, but the pizookies are life changing.  I went this morning and was happy to find out they have a weekend brunch menu. I ordered the breakfast flatbread pizza and it was really good! Well cooked and flavorful."
Cindy A.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,17,16,3.0,4/30/2017,Service was ok at best. Waited about 15-20 to be seated. Waitress didn't come to our table too often and was nowhere to be seen. She kind but quite clumsy. She dropped a utensil when picking up our plates. Our food arrived after over 20 minutes of waiting and the pizza we ordered wasn't hot anymore. My family took a bit into it and it was cool. This place redeemed itself with my correct order of the California chicken club.
Leona R.,"Spring Valley, CA",403,126,109,3.0,3/23/2017,"average BJs, nothing too special. they are almost always consistent with their food"
Peter V.,"Fresno, CA",9,8,,4.0,5/13/2017,"Great place to eat, good prices and enjoyed the atmosphere here. The outside was well furnished and I recommend to many that enjoy great food"
Webes T.,"Sun Valley, CA",0,53,,1.0,3/9/2017,save yourself the frustration of being treated like shit and eat anywhere else in LA but this particular BJs. The staff is so bad. Seems like every time I try to go here I just get frustrated with the staff. This time they couldn't even seat us right. I couldn't take and left. I hope the new restaurants opening in Burbank are better and don't hire anyone from this BJs!!
Mel D.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",375,166,105,4.0,1/4/2016,"Look it's BJs (hayoh)... We all know what the food is like, it's very typical. Nothing special but it is one of the better restaurants to go to for a game or meeting. What I love most about this specific location is the parking. You never have to worry about parking because you can always valet. Like I mentioned, food is alright. I usually get the bbq salad or wings and they've always been good. But it's nothing crazy to flip the table over from excitement. It's alright - just alright!"
Monica T.,"Covina, CA",0,1,4,5.0,4/26/2017,Just got back from a dinner with coworkers and our waiter Mike was A M A Z I N G. I don't usually do these Yelp reviews but I feel like Mike really did make our visit a great one. He was on top of everything and so kind! We even asked when he's usually in just to go back and have him as our waiter! Ask for him if you want great customer service!
