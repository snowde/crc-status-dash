Christine S.,"Glendora, CA",0,4,,1.0,9/18/2017,"Bjs is usually my first choice when dining out... but this bjs I will never return to again! Horrible service, food taste so different I left feeling sick.I had my usual fettuccini Alfredo with a coke. The waiter served us our dinner with no utensils what do we eat with? We asked nicely, waited patiently 15 min passed and we asked again. Of course, we had a cold dinner. No problem we still ate it and left! After couple days I posted this review,manager contacted me by email to apologize , I found that very professional of him to do that. Thank you Nick For taking the time and effort to apologize!"
Kevin B.,"Panorama City, Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,1.0,6/10/2017,"By far my worse experience at BJ's in Burbank. The service was slow, they had issues with their point of order system and paying. It took 15 minutes from the time we sat down before they even asked about drinks, took our entire order. My wife's beer came relatively fast, our cheese sticks came out. We had to ask for the two remaining drinks, one water and one strawberry lemonade. Explanation, they had to get the lemonade from the back. But how long does it take to get water. We had a coupon for a free appetizer and two gift cards. We ordered two deserts which they comped because of the slow service. I reminded them of the free appetizer when I gave them the gift cards. I estimated the amount of the check, when I got it back I owed $16, but they could not get the one gift card to work because of system issues. The amount was higher than I expected, I asked for the check, was handed the wrong one, we were a table of three adults and I was handed a check with kids meals on it. I finally got the check and saw they had not take off the appetizer. We went over the check, the free appetizer and the one gift card, we estimate a credit of $4. I left an $8 additional tip. Much higher than was deserved but I once was a waiter. And we left. When I got home and put my leftover flat pizza away there were only three slices when I know there were 4 left. It may be a while before I go back."
Diana G.,"Los Angeles, CA",177,89,214,4.0,7/28/2016,"I don't usually go to big chains, as I love to support mom and pop shops, but I have been going here for years (10+).  I am a rewards member and get a lot of deals sent to my email. BOGO, free desserts and/or half priced meals. Because of this, I have tried almost everything on the menu. The one thing I recommend most is the pizza. Nothing beats that deep dish. I have tried the meats, Mediterranean and Hawaiian. I also like their sandwiches, fries (both skinny and fat), calamari, parmesan chicken, steak, mashed potatoes, salads, etc...I can go on and on. Their ahi salad....OMG....Do yourself a favor and GET IT! Thank me later.  Ok, I feel like I am all over the place on this review. I've been there too many times.  The only reason I knocked off a star is because their burgers are not that great. I've given them a few chances, but they are never right. Only once did I return the burger, but it still came back as burnt as the first one, so I stopped ordering them.  I've never had a problem with the service. They have usually been very friendly and attentive."
Chelsea S.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,9,1,1.0,1/20/2017,"I want to start off by saying I was server myself at a local Cheesecake Factory and now work at Marriott as guest services so I know how crazy guests can get. I don't ever complain because I understand the struggle. But this review can be used as a training tool. Our server started out as a welcoming male and then he went on break and was replaced by Alyssa. We ordered appetizers, sliders two with cheese and the other two without along with the beginnings combo.  When the food came out the sliders had no cheese so I simply told her the situation and she looked at me with a blank face. With that, awkward silence so I suggested to just bring a slice of cheese and I'll make it myself. The cheese didn't come out for another 25 minutes so by then the sliders were cold and dry. Still, I did not complain. The service by her was very poor. She had an unprofessional attitude. After the cheese came we didn't ask her for anything else because we wanted to avoid her unprofessionalism. Paid for our meal and left."
Sarkis A.,"Burbank, CA",77,54,548,1.0,7/29/2017,wow i'm going to give theses people 1 star since the whole place is empty and they said we have to wait 15 to get a table.  can you believe this one employee can bring down a good biz
Michelle D.,"Vista, CA",0,13,7,4.0,5/31/2017,To be honest the food was great BUT they brought my brisket burger to the wrong table and I had to wait an additional ten minutes. I'm not picky but the customer service wasn't the best. I tried to get gravy and find a waiter for 10 minutes and he was no where to be found. The stars were earned by the quality of food and the fact that they made it right by offering a desserr
Cynthia A.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,5,,1.0,2/18/2017,"ONLY RATING IT ONE STAR BECAUSE I HAVE TOO. Worst service ever the waiter was like ""oh I'm going to help you guys with your drinks but let me help the other table first"" came back 35 mins later took our drinks waited more than an hour for our food asked for the burger well done and it tasted like it was only cooked for a couple mins the red juice was coming out of it completely gross. And when we got the food it wasn't even hot. To top it off it wasn't even that busy never coming here again!!!"
Rachel L.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",1,2,1,1.0,7/27/2016,"Tbh man, I came in here pretty excited for some good food, but I was fucking wrong smh! I asked for a Mac N Cheese, and all I got was the noodles without any sauce, or salt! What kind of food is this man? I hope y'all don't expect me to pay for this because I'm super heated! PLUS FOUND A CRICKET ON THE WALL NEAR MY FOOD AND MY WIFEY WAS TRIPPING SHIT! GET THE FOOD INSPECTORS TO INSPECT THIS BITCH AGAIN! KAREEM OUT"
Maria M.,"Sylmar, CA",160,1,,1.0,2/4/2017,I am here right now ...it didn't take long to get seated but when we did we ordered our food and took almost an hour my husband asked for his burger n it came out pink so we asked if they could fix it took another 25 min the 2 tables on each side of us came ate and are waiting for the check while me and my husband are barley starting to eat......never again
susie a.,"Burbank, CA",0,91,97,2.0,2/4/2017,Slowest service ever and the food isn't that great. Ovoid this place if you are hungry!!
Eva S.,"San Fernando, CA",1,14,,1.0,4/5/2017,"Service and quality of food have gone downhill. Server Marcus first forgot to put our appetizer order than finally came with the coldest order of calamari. I asked for another it was inedible. A long time later our entrees came out. Shrimp and asparagus pasta was . Pretty much salty marinara sauce. Fish n chips were super oily not crispy at all. I asked for wedge cut fries server didn't notify  me that they ran out til  after my order came n gave me regular. He finally ask for the check and he takes 20 min to bring it. Server kept disappearing on us and would randomly walk by n say ""oh yea u wanted this or that""  Worse service and food!! Go to woodranch grill near by. Much better quality food and better service. Also, when the bill came it was just the printed bill no portfolio along with it to place your card in. How awkward is that felt like I was at Denny's lol"
Jovanee R.,"San Diego, CA",73,18,28,1.0,1/4/2017,On my way to my flight for New York City my friends and I decided to check this place out. The waiter by the name of Jessie was not friendly and took forever to take our order. She never refilled our water cups and our orders were all messed up and our food was cold. I will NEVER go back to this place and will not recommend it to any of my friends. Bad customer service and bad food.
Mel E.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,181,180,5.0,4/11/2015,"Good spot to come with family and friends.  We sat down at the bar and right away approached by the bartender. He took our order and came back right away to serve us. They made sure we were taken cared of. If you are coming here as a group, do come in advance since it is a big family restaurant ."
Elen S.,"Los Angeles, CA",16,8,,1.0,2/3/2017,"Came to celebrate my birthday with my friends. It took over an hour for the food to come and the only reason they brought it out was because we complained on the wait. The pizookie ice cream was melted, my mini pizza was cold. It was absolutely the most disappointing birthday dinner I ever had in my life to the point that we ended up leaving the place without touching the food. Absolutely unacceptable."
Jennifer K.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,2,9,5.0,4/14/2017,"We have been here many times. It is always good. We came tonight and had the pleasure of getting Heather as our server.  She told us about the prime rib special, which two of us got. Although my meat was too rare for me (even after they cooked it more), I didn't really care. Heather was awesome. She didn't have to write anything down and got everything right. She kept checking on us and making sure our drinks were full and we were doing ok. She was very personable and friendly. I will definitely ask for her next time."
Rick R.,"Los Angeles, CA",438,231,219,4.0,10/12/2015,"Bj's is Bj's, and has lost its luster over the years; however, today's experience was much better than normal. Our server, Julia, provided top notch service. She was friendly (especially with the kids), attentive, and professional. She could have served us stale bread and I would've still given the experience 4 stars. If everyone provided this level of customer service, the world would be a much better place. If you stop in to this location, do yourself a favor and request to be seated in her section."
Gunner J.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,39,21,4.0,4/25/2017,"Great place to eat, very many options. Sometimes the service can be a little slow... especially if it's a big game night. But the food is great, pizzookies make the whole trip to this place worth it! Highly recommend those! The spaghetti is great, the Siracusa queso is also great and I haven't really had anything I didn't like here! Enjoy!"
Ruben N Olivia E.,"Santa Maria, CA",28,11,1,4.0,5/13/2017,We loved BJ's in Oxnard so we tried this one in Burbank.  The food is delicious we both had the steaks and they were great . The only reason I gave it a 4 was because the server didn't check in on us often to refill our drinks.  We arrived and were seated right away.  It was not packed for a Friday evening.  Other than that it was great.
I. T.,"Glendale, CA",1,31,2,3.0,4/24/2017,"The three stars are for the very friendly, helpful, charming staff, from the front desk to all the servers. Really nice people.  I wish the quality of the food was as good as the quality of the staff.   The spinach cheese dip was hard as a rock. Dip should be soft and luscious, not something you have to smash with your fork before you can eat it. Plus, it came in a ramekin so small, you could barely share it with anyone. They have great tortilla chips, but they all broke off in the dip because it was like cement. And the dip needs salsa on the side, because it's quite bland The little $5.50 salad I had with it was okay. Decent ranch dressing. I would eat that again.  The prices are reasonable. Valet parking, and free self-parking upstairs in their parking lot.  The restroom was stinky and gross, with paper towels falling out of the trash can, which looked like it hadn't been emptied in a while. Do clean restrooms matter? They do to me.   Not the worst place I've ever been, but I'm not planning to return. I'd like to give the staff jobs in a better restaurant!"
Jamilett M.,"San Diego, CA",0,5,1,1.0,12/29/2016,"WORST SERVICE! Waitress messed up everyones order, it was four of us about 10:30 pm, we were really hungry and she was even rude when we asked her to double check a beer we had asked for and when she finally gave up she came back and said that the server had poured the wrong drink. Honestly never had such bad service. Waitress name on receipt labeled as Jessie."
