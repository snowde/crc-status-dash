Michael B.,"Sun Valley, CA",4,5,2,1.0,10/22/2016,After terrible service.  JESSICA came to the rescue.  And she ain't even a waitress.  She's in take-out.  Short staff Long wait  Everything was good.  Except for waiting an hour. If ur really hungry... don't come.
Priscilla T.,"SYLMAR, CA",103,40,22,1.0,10/4/2015,"Parking was only available for valet $3.50 or parking across the street on street parking.  Our wait was 47 minutes for a party of 10. It was pretty busy so we did understand the wait time.  The woman's Bathroom were extremely dirty ; toilet paper all over the floor, 2 stalls smelled like urine and one sink was out of soap. I know because I have 3 children and hey take turns visit the bathroom.  Our server came and drop off the menus and immediately asked what we wanted to drink? (Hello, we just the menu...I say this because since we are in a water drought I don't want to order water unless if I plan to drink it, yet she offered a round of waters.)  She came back 7-11 minutes later to drop off the waters and take our orders, given the fact it was our first time we had menu questions. She was able to answer 2 out of 7 of the questions due to lack of knowledge of the menu. Placed our order. Part of that order was a pitcher of beer. When our beer came it was warm and the beer glass was dirty.  The order came out in half', half the table had their soups meanwhile orders waited. By the time the other soups came the others had finished the their soup. Then our meals came out in that same order... Once we got all our meals, our server didn't come back to ask if everything was okay. We needed sides of blue cheese/ BBQ but she never came back so we had to look for another server.  Finally, the desert came,we ordered 4 pizookie, those came out and tasted good. Not sure if I would recommend this place maybe it was the server/ maybe it was that it was Sunday or maybe their isn't an excuse for service like this. $180 not well spent"
Brian S.,"Sun Valley, CA",0,1,,5.0,3/29/2017,Best experience my wife and I've had in a long time Tyler was excellent and very friendly such a positive person
The G.,"Glendale, CA",1,44,14,1.0,1/30/2017,"bjs has changed quite a lot over the years. They have taken out all of their good food choices and now when u ask them to have the chef make a SIMPLE crispy chicken sandwich, they refuse. Highly disappointed."
M M.,"Arlington, TX",0,18,,1.0,4/27/2017,"We come here often for the beer and HH specials.  On the last visit, we ordered a Margarita.  Big mistake! All shaved ice and lime juice.  I have had stronger Slurpies or snow cones.  Stick with the beer."
Daisy I.,"Downey, CA",0,8,1,2.0,9/3/2017,Ordered an deep dish ziti for take out. And it didn't have much sauce or flavor. Very disappointed about BJ's. Never going back again
Michael J.,"Santa Monica, CA",93,69,35,4.0,7/27/2016,"Came here randomly with my woman and had a beautiful lunch. I think Jeffery was our waiter and he was fast, professional and basically perfect. He didn't do anything extra, he seemed genuine and our food was terrific. I would definitely come here again especially with the free valet parking, as it just makes things much easier to handle when going out to eat."
Paola S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,1,1.0,7/6/2017,"Went on a Sunday at around 12:30. It was a nice day so we sat outside, don't know if that's why our service was so bad. It wasn't even as busy as I expected, but maybe they were understaffed? Took 20 minutes to get our drinks and an additional 10 to get our orders taken. Had to ask for silverware and once we got it, it was dirty. There was a guy smoking at the table next to us. The waiters didn't ask him to put out his cigarette until someone complained. There was a family with a dog that came after us and the dog got fed before we did!this location sucks. Would recommend a different location."
Erick D.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,15,23,4.0,4/15/2016,"If you ever happen to stop by this BJs location in Burbank....make sure you have SHANNON be your server. She's Amazing!!!! I'm a regular here, there's never a day she's not in a great mood; just makes the experience and vibe extra chill! Just remember this name SHANNON :)  She's definitely a reason why we come to BJ's and not the other local restaurants. P.S. white choc pazzuci is the best!!!"
Salute U.,"Burbank, CA",4650,260,281,1.0,11/11/2016,"We came here on Veterans Day for the military meals that BJ's offers to vets and active military personnel. The service was VERY SLOW, there was no bread or breadsticks offered while we looked over the menu. In fact I had to ask for bread even though I had almost eaten my meal. The waiter never offered anything. Then a person who may have been the Manager came by our table to check on things. I expressed my irritation of their poor service to him and this knucklehead made no attempt to make things right. What an A hole. Don't come here otherwise you will be disappointed."
Cinderella R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,4,5.0,4/13/2017,I love this place!!!! There chicken alfredo is the best in town!!! Stephanie Martinez our server of the day was the cherry on top to a beautiful lunch! She's so caring and always on top of the game! And their garlic knots are to die for!! Will definitely be coming back in hope to get the same customer service!
Scott D.,"Burbank, CA",21,37,1,2.0,3/25/2017,We love the food but they have way too few self parking spaces. Don't like to be forced to valet. There were a large number of spaces but all reserved for the valets.
Kendall M.,"Los Angeles, CA",95,113,1,4.0,11/30/2016,"You know, I was pleasantly surprised by this place. I spend a fair amount of time in Burbank and although I've been to other BJ's before I hadn't been to this one yet. We couldn't spend Thanksgiving with my gramma, so we took her out to lunch a couple of days later, this place is really close to her home and she doesn't like to go far, so it worked well. I was expecting it to be loud because the freeway is so near, but it wasn't! We sat outside (there were dogs on the patio! my favorite thing) and it was lovely. Our server (Nikka? Oh, please forgive me for forgetting your name!) was sassy and nice, we were fans. My salad was enormous, and my beer was good! all in all it made for a really nice afternoon."
Susan D.,"Los Angeles, CA",51,116,58,3.0,7/29/2016,food is salty...ie the  boneless hot wings...mini deep dish is 1/2 price on happy hour...you choose the ingredients....use your yelp check in for a free app offer...hot in here but beer is cold!
Karie F.,"PORTER RANCH, CA",260,600,450,4.0,11/27/2016,"Had a business meeting here. Great location, right off of the 5 fwy. Parking is available in the lot next to the restaurant, or you can valet for $3.50.  Our waiter was top notch, such a kind person, even to other employees and bus people(forgot his name, uggh).But we visited on Friday at 2:30, if that helps. Very attentive and friendly. The food was great! Noise level was a lil bit too much but we were seated near the kitchen so maybe this was a factor. Booths are nice and roomy too. The bathroom was pretty dirty though. It smelled bad and had lots of garbage on the floors. This was a shame too because otherwise, the decor  was nice. They also have a toddler toilet which is great for the kiddos, however, they don't have any kind of sign on the outside of the stall. So when I entered I had no idea until I was practically sitting on the floor. Overall it was a great visit and I would def recommend and come back!"
Laura H.,"Burbank, CA",381,149,441,4.0,7/15/2016,"I really enjoy BJ's because it's one of those ""there's something for everyone"" places, including a full bar. On weekend nights, there is a bit of a wait for a table, but it's usually not more than 30 minutes. Servers are consistently good! They are pleasant and rarely have gotten any orders wrong in all the years I've been coming here. The drinks are great as well, especially the beers. There is valet parking, but also a free parking structure past the valet signs and to your right, but only after 5pm on weekdays and all day on weekends. Try the pizza and the pizookies- it's what they're known for!"
Promise R.,"Burbank, Los Angeles, CA",30,10,,4.0,2/28/2017,"Our server Heather was phenomenal! Always there when we needed her, and knowledgeable about the menu and bar!!"
Batavia M.,"Los Angeles, CA",549,75,73,5.0,2/14/2017,"We had Valentines dinner at this Burbank BJ location and our server was KYLE M, he is the bomb, great customer service skills and multi tasking, management should give him a raisE PERIOD!!!!"
Carrie S.,"Burbank, CA",216,56,18,2.0,10/23/2016,"I will start with a positive, our server Sarah was so sweet.  It was a Saturday afternoon and me and my friend just wanted a chill place to have a bite to eat & gab. Well, what used to be a spot to visit on occasion, this experience will definitely deter from that. Our food took quite a long time for a couple of sandwiches, one cold and one hot. When our food finally arrived, my french fries weren't what I ordered and my sandwich was cold. Sarah was kind to send it back to the kitchen and bring me hot and fresh fries while I waited for my fresh sandwich. I had ordered it WITHOUT BACON, I want that to be clear from the get-go! When my sandwich came back, it was hot but had bacon in it. That was unfortunate. I brought it my server's attention and she apologized profusely. She asked if a wanted another one and at that point, it wasn't worth it. I ordered the salad I should have ordered to begin when perusing the large menu of options. The manager came over and said ""I heard there was a problem with your sandwich and we'll take care of it for you."" I told him how the first one was cold, and the second one had bacon in it. He quipped ""It didn't."" Shocked by how the 'customer is always right' didn't apply, I said, ""I know it did, sir."" He said, again, as matter of factly, ""I'm telling you didn't."" Appalled by how rude this man was speaking to me, I said, ""I'm telling you that it did."" And he then had the audacity to say, ""it was probably an overcooked piece of chicken that you mistook it for."" Whoa, are you kidding me? So now am I not only ""wrong"" but it's okay to serve a guest overcooked meat?! Wow. I tried to keep the smile on my face and not the show the disgust I felt in the pit of my stomach. He then walked away.  Off the look of my friend, who was equally mortified, I asked if I had come off to him in any way that would warrant him to speak to me so passive aggressive and condescending, and she said ""no."" I flagged our server over and thanked her, and mentioned that the manager had come over to address the food issues, by being beyond rude to me as a customer and basically called me a liar. She also was extremely apologetic. So sir, I now know you're the GM of that location and I will let your corporate office know what a jerk you were to a customer. The fact of the matter is this, I don't go out to eat often but when I do, I expect great service from top to bottom. The kitchen doesn't have it's stuff together because they messed up the order three times. Your food runners should get the food to the table faster so it's hot when served, then I suppose this situation wouldn't have happened to begin with. TRULY disappointed, and will NOT return to this location and will tell others to do the same."
Ashley H.,"Glendale, CA",0,11,1,2.0,8/22/2017,"Food we good. However it took about 20 minutes to get some chips and guacamole. My daughters steamed veggies were hard, and obviously not cooked well. Service was very slow, especially for it being a weekday evening and it was not busy. I assume it was the kitchens fault and they need to get their act together."
