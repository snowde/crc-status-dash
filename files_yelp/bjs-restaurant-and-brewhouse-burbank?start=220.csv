Matthew J.,"Glendale, CA",32,62,3,1.0,4/1/2016,"For whatever reason there's valet. You can drive past them to get to the structure that is right next to where the valets park your car. The wait on the weekend can be long. Overall the staff is decent and the food is on par with the other Bjs I've been to. The past two times I've gone here they have either not accepted my phone number for the rewards points because ""it's a hassle"", or told me I was good to go only for me to find later that the points weren't added. Missing a couple of points isn't usually a problem. But this happened to be when the bills were $160 and $250 respectively. This is the only branch that has given me this much of a problem. I'd rather them tell me that they just don't accept the rewards system so wouldn't have to play ""will they or won't they""."
Abe M.,"Burbank, CA",20,61,17,1.0,2/5/2017,"Ok. Where do I start?  Last time I was there, the waitress took our order and never came back. Someone else came and dropped off our food and we never saw anyone else til we asked for the check.  When I complained to the manager on the way out, she didn't seem to care and we left.  This time was even worse.  The fish came over cooked and tasted terrible. It was more grease than ever and the vegetables were old and tasted rotten as you can see in the picture.  That wasn't the worst part. We sat near the kitchen and I had to look the other way become I was soooo grossed out. I have never seen anything like this in my life. I eat out at least 4 times a week at fancy restaurants and I guess you can't compare them the BJ's but that's no excuse. Obviously the manager in not doing her job.  She doesn't seem to care. I am attaching pictures so you can see for yourself. I will never eat at BJ's again. I don't think anyone else will if they ever see the kitchen. I wonder how many insects are walking around in that condition."
sweetie p.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,34,1,2.0,6/7/2017,"Is it me or has the food gone downhill here? The pizza is terrible, the avocado rolls were a mixture of other things than avocado, they keep changing everything..even the fries. Not happy with the companies changes. It sucks now."
terry s.,"Burbank, CA",11,58,24,2.0,9/25/2016,"I will never come back here!!!!! Service was deplorable, we waited 35 min for our food. My pasta was very bland. Can't wait for my check & go home. The $10.00 off coupon my friend has is not worth it!!!!!"
Zoie H.,"Los Angeles, CA",2279,807,1539,4.0,3/14/2014,"I need to start off with the highlight of the evening: The BJ's Berry Cider. Oh My gosh, it was super delicious (amazing berry flavor), and super crisp and refreshing. I had a pint of it by itself and a pint of it combined with the Jeremiah Red Stout (called a Jerry Berry). So worth it! Beyond amazing! The trip to BJ's was part of Tyler and I's date night. It's hard working graveyard shift to actually have nights out so this was perfect and well needed! We treated ourselves to some Santa Fe Spring Rolls (good sized portion for the price), and we both had burgers (he had the jalapeno burger and loved it, I had the regular BJs Brewhouse burger -  both with fries), and of course we had to have a giant cookie topped with ice cream! (we had the new salted caramel one, it was worth every single calorie and pound of fat that I am sure to gain!) Service was friendly and attentive without being overbearing. They have valet parking, but if you go to the second level of the parking structure it's try your luck for spaces self-parking. I want to go back, mainly for the berry cider and giant cookies. That could totally be a meal right?!"
Bryan R.,"Los Angeles, CA",149,1,,1.0,9/26/2016,"Patrick you suck at your job you should get fired . We went for my brothers birthday and we saw others get treated so nicely for their birthdays they sang for them and had a nice candle on their dessert , PATRICK came to our table threw the cookie down on the table as if he was mad and just said ""here"" and left so me and my friend just sang happy birthday for my brother instead. ""GREAT SERVICE"" 25 min for some water. First trump now this."
Erik D.,"Los Angeles, CA",80,27,5,5.0,10/2/2016,Christian is the man! really good waiter. Good service all around. Pizooki was the ish!!
Gigi G.,"Alhambra, CA",0,2,1,3.0,1/25/2017,"My friend and I decided to go to this place yesterday for lunch, our experience was not what we expected from a place so popular like BJ'S.   First off, I ordered fried Calamari, let me tell y'all it was hard as a rock, dried and old. Then we were offered a free dessert if we sign up for the members rewards program. Well we ended up paying for it. Overall bad experience."
Roman G.,"Burbank, CA",61,201,1043,5.0,5/17/2016,Great dinner with family on Mother's Day. the people were very much but nevertheless we got the place quickly. Everything was very tasty and the price given Sunday is quite acceptable. I recommend to all.
Megan Alexis G.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,4,,5.0,6/22/2017,"RYAN J IS THE BEST SERVER EVER!!!!! He's so sweet!!!!! Even tho we were literally the last ones left, he was so accommodating & didn't rush us at all. :)"
Monica M.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",311,43,46,2.0,6/11/2015,Are you serious? Lol.  The stuffed mushrooms keep getting smaller and smaller as time goes by lol.  Flavor: it's alright.. Kinda dry since they're so tiny and whatever.  Little mini mushrooms lol.
Flower P.,"Sylmar, CA",0,16,6,3.0,12/30/2016,"I had an EXCELLENT experience here many moons ago maybe about 5 years ago. But the few times I've gone this year have been from bad to so-so.  The waiters and food is not up to par. I rather go to the one in Woodland Hills. It almost seems like they are annoyed with every new customer that walks in. Didn't bring us napkins/silverware until we asked, cold food, waiter seemed like he was trying to rush us out giving us the bill when we still wanted dessert plus not good knowledge on the beers we were asking about. It is a brewery as well, right? Just a very ""blah"" place. BTW none of the times were ""busy"" days."
Phil S.,"Burbank, CA",223,69,20,1.0,8/31/2016,Only ordered about 5 items and out of the 5 three were sent back.  Steak was extra salty which they took off the bill.  Waiter messed up on the pizza and acknowledged it and still tried to charge me until I called him out.  Won't be coming back here again
Deborah M.,"Burbank, CA",0,3,,1.0,3/4/2017,"Worst dining experience ever! Waited over an hour for food and was told two of our six meals were almost ready. Asked for the manager and when we explained we had been waiting so long and our two toddlers were starving, she replied ""I know, we're backed up."" No I'm sorry, no let me make it up to you, she took no ownership at all. We finally got the kids Mac n Cheese and what a surprise they were cold. The drink orders weren't much better. The waiter told us that the drinks were delivered to the wrong table so we had to wait until they made new ones. Never did get all of our meals. Will never go here again!"
Daryl P.,"Pasadena, CA",122,17,,1.0,11/13/2016,"BJ's allocates entirely too much parking to valet. The restaurant is not even packed, but I have to wait around for people to leave. It's like like more than half the parking is valet."
JR C.,"Los Angeles, CA",74,3,,3.0,6/25/2017,Update: Nick responded to my email and I appreciate the effort to rectify the situation. Hopefully our next visit will be more pleasant.
Yohanna P.,"Burbank, CA",0,8,,1.0,7/11/2017,Love the food at BJ's but this location service sucks. My friend and I got only checked on once by our waiter. It wasn't even that busy. We had to ask for our refills. Took probably about 20 mins to get our check. When we asked for our check she said our bills were the same so if we wanted to give her our credit cards and when I told her no we wanted the bill to our table she made a face. Get way better service at the one in Glendale. She gave the tables next to and in front of us better one on one service and they both got their checks before us and boxes and they were here way after us.
Arineh S.,"La Crescenta, CA",0,3,,3.0,6/18/2017,"Bj's food is always great! However, the front host who was taking our name for our seating tried to make us wait longer when he didn't even call our name,text us,or give us a beeper notifying that our table was ready. He tried lying saying that he did notify us. He also tried making us wait an additional 30 min. Not cool."
Arik T.,"Los Angeles, CA",136,193,398,5.0,2/28/2016,"Always a pleasure. Other than the parking situation this BJ's is great! It's huge and the servers are always on point, the drinks are always good, and the food is always fresh. The location is huge so it get's a little loud but there really isn't a bad seat in the house, there are TV's everywhere so you're pretty well covered in that aspect. I highly recommend the new ""Monkey bread pizookie"" it really blew me away! I will definitely be back!"
Cheryl A.,"Burbank, CA",0,2,,1.0,12/11/2016,"This review is mainly for their to go service and the food quality. I ordered a bowl of chicken tortilla soup and a pizookie via online ordering and for a specified time.  When I arrived at the designated time, I waited.  20 minutes came and went and I still waited. It was a Saturday night and extremely busy, so even though they were given over an hour to heat up soup and a cookie, I can maybe understand the wait.  It still isn't ideal, but I'm pretty reasonable.   I got home (5 min drive), opened my food and the soup was cold and the cookie was the wrong order and BARELY cooked. It was just mushy and  completely disappointing. This isn't the first disappointing experience that I have had at this location with their curbside delivery service.  Undercooked steak.  Undercooked pizza.  I'm seeing a theme here...  I won't be back to this location."
