Kayla R.,"Los Angeles, CA",107,105,240,5.0,4/19/2016,"I've been here several times & even at the Glendale location. Not sure why I haven't written a review yet, but I really needed to after my last experience. We came here last Thursday after my brother's pinning ceremony and figured this would be a quick and smart place to go and have a celebratory dinner. We walked in with 7 of us. They just needed to set the table & had us seated right away. Our server was Jan & she took care of us entirely. Everyone got their own thing, but I ordered the Lemon Thyme Chicken and the Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms. I always always always get the Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms when I'm here. It is so freakin' good. Highly recommend!!!!!!! My parents shared a rack of ribs with their side soups. My brother got the jambalaya. I'm not sure what the rest of our group ordered, but everyone was happy. No complaints. Everything was delicious. I tried some of my parents' & brother's order and everything was cooked & seasoned well. Our server even offered a complimentary pazookie to my brother as we were there celebrating him as a new college graduate. How sweet & kind of her! It was such a special day for him, so I thought it was extremely thoughtful of her to do that for us without us even asking!!!!!!!!! She took care of us from beginning to end & her section was full!!!!! I love a good server. Good food. Good service. For our most recent experience here, 5 stars!"
Mi P.,"Compton, CA",140,47,24,1.0,11/22/2016,Made an order online in order to a ovoid the wait when picking up food items. Arrive to the restaurant and they seemed to never have received my order even after i got a confirmation number via email and everything. Manager didnt even bother apologizing on their part and i still had to wait for my food. Point of ordering online is to nothave to wait for my food! I have ordered online at pther Bjs and never had this happened to me. Never coming back to this location. What a dissapointment on management and customer service.
Jeff K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,22,,4.0,6/28/2017,"Attentive service, great menu options including healthy entrees. Meals did not disappoint and BJs is a great value. Plenty of leftovers for lunch the next day. I recommend this BJs location."
Christina C.,"Los Angeles, CA",240,140,2,1.0,8/9/2016,"I'm really disappointed to say that I've been coming to this BJ's for the last 4 years that I've lived in Burbank, and each experience has blatantly and steadily declined in quality. Last weekend, a small group of us (5 total) came in for a birthday dinner at around 6:30pm. We were seated at a high top in the bar area since there were lots of empty tables. We got our drinks in a timely manner and proceeded to order our entrees (a salad, a small plate of wings, chicken tacos, lemon tyme chicken, and a burger). We talked and hung out....and realized that AN HOUR has passed by and we haven't gotten our food yet. Checked in with the server, and she assured us the food was on its way. 15-20 mins later, the food arrived, except for the burger. The 4 of us were almost done eating when we had to remind the server that we were still missing the burger. 20 mins later, the server came over with the burger, and to collect our empty plates :( A very nice manager came over and asked us if our food was alright, and that he would take off the burger from the bill and offered us complimentary Pazookis, which was unexpected! We probably should've left at this point because the 3 mini pazookis took well over 30-40 mins to arrive. The whole dinner took about 2.5 hours, and the restaurant wasn't at capacity by any means. When we were finally able to flag down our server, we were charged incorrectly, and the desserts were charged as well. At this point, instead of having the bill fixed, we bit the bullet and paid it so we could leave as soon as possible. Bottom line: It was probably a warning sign when all 5 of us started to realize we've all had horrible previous experiences here and traded stories. Honestly, the food is really great, but DON'T expect decent service AT. ALL."
Martin S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,15,,1.0,9/15/2016,"Terrible service from the beginning. Our waiter was completely rude not one smile since we arrived and sat down to order. I had to ask serval times for my beer and when it was finally brought to me after 15 minutes of waiting, I received my beer in a dirty warm glass with spots all over the glassware. Also when we ordered all our food was brought out at different times when we all ordered together, why each plate had to come 15 minutes apart from each other is extremely odd and when I asked the waiter what was going on with the long wait, he simply ignored us and walked away. Food was ridiculous and undesirable, way too greasy, bland, and overpriced for the quality you actually get."
Disraili G.,"Burbank, CA",22,49,,1.0,3/5/2017,"Let me start with that my wife and I eat out regularly. Maybe as much as 3 times a week. We have been to almost every restaurants in Burbank. Yet we don't go to BJ's that often. My wife suggested I get the ribeye. As I love a good steak. So we order. My wife gets strawberry lemonade and I got sunset peach ice tea. Got the drinks and my wife has that yuk look on her face after the first drink. The drink was so sweet it was like drinking double the sugar this drink should have. My wife ordered some sort of shrimp dinner. She order an appitizer mushroom. It was pretty good and there was a lot of them. I ordered a clam chowder soup. I thought it was pretty good. My wife said it was a bit salty. But she still ate some anyway. Now we get the main dishes. My wife food was great. Now my food, I taste the mash potatoes and its bland. I think ok fine. I taste the steak and it has huge chunks of salt on top. I know a good steak need salt bit this is rediculous amount of salt. My wife tried it and said she can taste the salt even after having some of her drink. I tell the waiter. He takes it back. It takes a long time as they had to cook another. By then I had another ice tea. Now I'm full and didn't even get to have steak. The waiter offered me more food. I turned him down and got the steak to go. For a steak meal I was disappointed all the way around. $62 for a meal for 2 with no alcoholic drinks. Think I will pass on the steak here. As well will think twice before I come for a meal again. Who ever cooks and prepared the strawberry lemonade needs to have their taste buds checked with a doctor as this is rediculous."
Ana V.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,22,1,2.0,10/23/2016,"Don't order curbside. Wasn't ready it was supposed to be....what's the point of it if I have to wait outside door in the cold and in the rain? Also, pizza was less than their usual. And their avocado rolls had more chipotle sauce than avocado... The rolls tasted like mayo  I suggest the Pasadena location"
Daisy C.,"Northridge, Los Angeles, CA",6,45,6,5.0,4/16/2016,Its the second time i visit this location. The first time i ordered pizza i can't remember if it was good or not. I went yesterday again and i ordered chicken alfredo and a lemonade. The chicken alfredo was so good! It's a large portion i couldn't finish it so the price of 15.95 is not bad at all. However the lemonade was not good at all. It was sour.  Service was very great very welcoming young lady and had no problem exchanging our cold food. Thank you!
Amina's J.,"Burbank, CA",55,36,21,3.0,4/23/2016,"Great place for a drink... their chilled Patron shots are like triple shots. And the selections of veers and occasional local featured beers is always refreshing. Usually don't have a complaint about this place, which is why we return even after the mishap I'm about to explain. Now... one of their downfalls is an obvious breakdown in the kitchen. For a family who does not eat beef, it was disheartening to be served clam chowder bowls with chili chunks in it, not once but TWICE in the same meal.  Seems like some jack ass in the kitchen did not give enough thought to cross contaminating the soups, and after being told by the manager that he changed the entire clam chowder container, the replacement had chili beans in it too!  After pointing this out, I ordered a grilled cheese with shoestring fries and they attempted to charge me for the soup AS WELL AS the grilled cheese. Needless to say, a simple discussion with the waitress and she made sure all of it was removed from the bill.  It seems like over time, this place is starting to struggle with basic food prep errors, but still a great atmosphere overall.  And despite some of their pitfalls, management usually goes out of their way to fix issues and make accommodations to show their apologies instead of it just being lip service."
Lilit P.,"Glendale, CA",0,5,1,4.0,6/14/2017,We ordered for pick up. Food was good but they forgot to put the sauces for the salad. We ended up eating a dry salad. Make sure when you call for pick up you remind them for what you need!
Michael B.,"Burbank, CA",36,8,,2.0,5/8/2017,"First i want to say that the food is really good. So why am i give only 2 stars? When my group arrived we came in 2 cars there was only parking for 1 so we asked the valet guy if there was any other palce to park the car, he said no and that we had to go somewhere else to park. Since we were on short time limit we paid for the valet, but they didnt park our car, we parked it  ourselves. We didnt have to wait long to be seated and the waiter was very nice and patient. We get our drinks and food in a decent time. We shared a plate of some noodles (i dont remember what the plate was called). I get my fork and wrap the noddles around and eat it. As i am eating i feelvsomething a little hard amd thought it might be a bone. I pull it out and see that it is a metal tie that you get on your beard or tortillas. I wasnt mad or looking for blood but when our waiter passed by i informed him of it and he apologized and said he would inform the manager. We continue and about 10 minutes later someone with the plate and metal tie come to the table and asks who ordered it. We saod we were sharing the plate but i was the one that pulled it out of my mouth. He tells us the he was cofused cause he says the dont use those types of tie but imstaed have the ones that look kind of like guitar picks. We all look at each other and he asked ""well what do we want?"" We said we dont want anything, just take the plate off our check. I was the first one to take a bite so the plate was almost still there. He kept insist that they dont have that tie. We told him that we work in customer service and didnt want to cause any problem just to let them know what happen. He looks at me and says ""well you would be suprised at what people in customer service will do to get free stuff."" That got me mad. To accuse us of tryimg to get a free meal is horrible to say. But he kept on asking if we wanted anything. We also came to realize that he is the chef not the manager. So why is he coming out and the manager not. Horrible place to go to and by looking at other reviews im not the only one."
Michael P.,"Sussex, NJ",3,29,3,3.0,10/23/2016,Ok food; feels like an Applebee's. If you want an ok meal for a reasonable price with little atmosphere you've come to the right place.
Joyce F.,"Burbank, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/21/2017,"I placed a take out order and was told to pick up in 15-20 minutes. After I arrived, I waited another 30 minutes because the order wasn't complete. And meanwhile the pizza got cold.  Lousy food and a waste of money."
Louie B.,"Sylmar, CA",72,38,22,1.0,5/20/2016,"Everything I ordered is salty except the glass of waterthe ribs and steak is salty, the mash potato is salty too much cheese, the asparagus they're over cook and they did not cut the top part, the clam chowder as well is too salty. The fish is salty and the shrimp too.  This is my first time here and this will be my last time as well"
Katy C.,"Los Angeles, CA",27,10,3,5.0,4/5/2015,"We celebrated my sister's engagement party here last night. It was such an excellent experience! They provided us with a semi-private seating area for our party of 30 and let me go in early to decorate.  I have to say from start to finish, the staff was superb. As soon as I got there, the manager greeted me and asked if I needed anything, and introduced me to our main server, Jordan.  Jordan was assisted by Steven who went out of his way to make the evening perfect, including finding me tape, placing the finishing decoration on our cake, and helping me with the champagne I brought. Jordan was super professional and really sweet. She made sure everyone was well taken care of. Jordan and Steven were terrific, the manager was especially welcoming, and the food was great. Couldn't have asked for a better experience! A+"
C H.,"North Hollywood, CA",0,14,3,3.0,5/11/2017,I like sitting in the patio during summer eves. Food is ok. Big menu so lots of choices.  Beers are good. Great place to watch sports!
Gohar S.,"Burbank, CA",11,37,45,2.0,3/18/2016,"I hadn't been to BJ's for a while, but it still remains a 2 star restaurant as how I remember it. The service was extremely slow. It was a Friday night, not as busy as we expected, we didnt have to wait at all for a table, but why was the service so slow? Who knows. We ordered a pizza and salad, the pizza was not bad, but the salad didnt taste fresh and crisp, alot of wilted lettuce pieces. They really need to up their game with Woodranch opening across the street.  Also, they force the valet parking on you, there is a lot they use but 90% of the spaces are reserved for the valet, not too reasonable."
Lorin M.,"Los Angeles, CA",435,37,75,5.0,7/26/2016,This place gets 5 stars just for the host named Alex who was extremely nice and welcoming today.
Mike K.,"TOLUCA TER, CA",0,33,1,1.0,4/1/2016,"Please stay away from this place. Horrible food and long waits. Driest pizza on earth, no cheese and their online order messed up my order. I've been here maybe 6 times and never was amazed. Cheese factory is better. I'm so disappointed, I'm just sorry I left a tip. i should have left something else. The chiefs need to be thought how to cook by Gordon Ramsay.  Ps: shrimp on the side was good ._."
Sanka D.,"Los Angeles, CA",274,12,1,5.0,7/30/2016,Had a GREAT dinner here tonight! Our waiter Jonathon was Wonderful and on Top of it. Dale's steak was over cooked and he had the manager come over to personally apologies for the error and completely remade his dinner.  And for the trouble they gave us our appetizers on the house.  I recommend the BJ'S to everyone!  Great employees and WONDERFUL Manager Mark!!!!
