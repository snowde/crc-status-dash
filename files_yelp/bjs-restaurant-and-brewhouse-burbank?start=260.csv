Jim L.,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",0,20,3,5.0,4/29/2016,"Great place for lunch.  Service at the sports bar is fantastic!  Claudia is really top notch.  She cares!  She is helpful!  She is very personable and friendly.  She helps find the lowest cost combination when my wife and I are looking to split a meal because we know we cannot eat two meals.  We almost always sit at the bar corner so the three or four of us can talk to each other.  We're usually early in the lunch period, so the bar area is reasonably quiet, important for us. Claudia gives her space around the bar a lot of personality and makes everyone feel like family. Edgard, who runs the Valet Service which is FREE (no charge), is also a super personable friendly guy.  He really welcomes you to HIS establishment and sets the tone for a great  welcoming. We just love going to BJ's often for lunch. FOOD?  A great variety.  Complained only once when the Brocoli & Cheese soup only had a few green specs in it!  Now, there is always plenty of brocoli in it.  Beef dip great!  Thin fries are very very good."
Victoria M.,"Visalia, CA",0,11,,2.0,1/22/2017,"We waited to be seated for about 30mins as they were pretty busy. When we were seated it took them another 15mins to take our drink order. Our waitress was nice but I was not impressed with this place. Our food took forever to come out and when it finally did, it was cold."
Jacqueline R.,"Los Angeles, CA",2491,927,2572,3.0,10/3/2014,2014 YELP 365 CHALLENGE - 289/365 3.5 stars. I have dined at this BJs twice so far. Pretty decent. Seemed like a smaller location but they still had a good amount of seating. There are a lot of walls/columns so it feels really sectioned off and the layout isn't super open.  Thankfully I have never had to wait super long for a table. Service has been pretty good and the food was consistent with other locations. Highly recommend their deep dish pizzas (Great White is my fave!) and their pizookies (large baked cookies with ice cream on top) are a must! I love their Oreo one :) The only reason I was really turned off from this BJs was the valet-only parking. $3.50 to have a guy drive my car into a spot that was literally right in front of the restaurant. I could have done that myself and saved the $$. Valet felt very unnecessary at this location and I was annoyed that I had to pay a guy to move my car 10 ft.
Hasmik M.,"Griffith Park/Los Feliz, Los Angeles, CA",4,6,1,1.0,12/18/2016,"My first time and most likely my last, food is okay, but service is horrible and it's not even crowded. I arrived at 4pm, it's 6pm and I'm just getting my food"
Lorraine M.,"West Hollywood, CA",35,17,23,4.0,11/3/2014,"I came here for my nephews birthday with my family and we had a really good time.  The atmosphere of this place is really fun and the waiter that we had was really sweet and funny.  The only thing that is keeping me back from giving 5 stars is that the pizza was good, but I really did expect a lot more from it.  The Pizookie samplers were so good!! I will be coming back for those!"
Virian G.,"Sunset Strip, CA",108,10,4,1.0,9/28/2015,"1/2 a star because our Bartender was attentive. Cleanliness: Restrooms were terrible. I get that it's Sunday and you had a busy turn around. Honestly I saw three hostess. I'm sure one of them could have checked the restroom.  The food: We started with Avocado Egg Rolls. They are my favorite and the real reason I went to BJ's last night. The avocado tasted old.  Ordered Wings Extra Hot and sure enough they tasted like traditional. Sometimes it happens so we ordered one more app hoping we'd hit a good one. The Calamari was not Crispy but in fact was SOGGY!! We should have said something earlier but we were starving. I did not want to wait for a remake. Last but not least shared the Jambalaya with Angel Hair. The plate had water in it from the pasta which diluted the flavor. I asked for a side of Cajun Spices hoping to make it better but by the time I got it my food was cold.  I spoke to a manager ( Tall, Slim, Caucasian, Male, & used to work at The Cheesecake Factory) and clearly he didn't really care. He made us feel as if we were out to get a free meal. When we mentioned how we've been coming to Bjs for years, even though we didn't have a premiere rewards card. (Simply because I don't really care for one) He would continue to justify the reason behind each plate mistake. We also mentioned how we haven't had food all day since we were on a long ride home, he said he hadn't eaten all day either. I never speak up to a manager for this reason and yesterday was the first time I ever spoke to a manager with a complaint. It was a total waste of time.  What a failure!  I guess in order to be treated better you have to have a premiere rewards card so they know and trust your word. 1/2 star for the pizookie. Total price for the 3drinks, Meal & Experience was $70.25 Never Coming Back Again!!"
Jacqueline A.,"Huntington Park, CA",0,4,1,1.0,1/21/2017,"Went in with my boyfriend about 3 weeks ago for dinner. We started off with a drink each: he got a Guinness & I the pear cider. We then ordered the calamari to munch on while our pizza was being made. Well, the drinks were the only good thing that night. We only ate about a quarter of the calamari. It tasted stale and old. Not even warm. And each piece was 99% breading than not. Not a big deal so we let it slide without calling it out to the waiter's attention. Granted, we were hungry and were looking forward to our pizza even more now. Pizza gets to the table and it looks great. We each start with a slice and are immediately disgusted. It was cold and all the veggies seemed to be raw! I went in to feel the pizza pan and cold to the touch, were as other BJ's locations, you have to be careful to not burn yourself on that thing! That was the last straw. It only took one bite from our pizza slices for our appetites to be completely ruined! We were unhappy and proceeded to letting the waiter know of our dissatisfaction. He apologized, asked if he could replace the order for us or get us anything else but we were just done and annoyed by then. He took the food away and we asked to still pay for our drinks so we could leave. 5 minutes of sitting there, the manager comes along and also apologizes. We don't blame him nor the waiter. Just serve better food. Edible dishes! Keep your kitchen on check, please!!! After speaking to the manager, we waited another 10 minutes for the drink bill and nothing. So we left! I guess drinks were on the house?! Whatever. Safe to say I'll never be eating here again. I'll stick to the BJ's by my house.... Downey for the win!"
Fadi A.,"Irvine, CA",0,3,,1.0,4/8/2017,"Horrible Experience, took 50 minutes to get the food order in and when we brought it up to one of the managers, she just grabbed the plate with the cold food and walked away, no refills for our drinks in 45 minutes, very poorly managed. Never Again."
Cody R.,"Los Angeles, CA",149,4,3,1.0,4/24/2016,"Let me just start this off by saying what wonderful things we had heard about BJ's Brewhouse. My boyfriend is a beer connoisseur, and was excited to go to a local brewhouse. We go out frequently, we enjoy divulging in new foods, drink & experiences overall.        That being said, we were extremely disappointed in Burbank's BJ's Brewhouse.  We sat down at an unset table, I am a server/bartender myself so we always are the first to be understanding of other circumstances, busy restaurants, oversat severs etc. so no big deal to begin.        When our waitress did come over, neither of us were quite ready to order but my boyfriend ordered a beer none the less right away, then pressingly asked if we had decided on appetizers or entrees, we had sat down 2 minutes prior - who would have been ready to place drinks, appetizers & entrees at that point?         His beer came and I ordered one for myself and a small appetizer right after. Our appetizer came before my beer did. She asked again when she dropped off my beer if we were ready to order and did not ever ask how the appetizer was. When at that point, no we were still not ready, she seemed annoyed with us. We ordered fried artichokes with a lemon aoli, the artichokes inside were barely cooked and slid right out of the fried battered around it. Again, we were unimpressed and said nothing. She came back and put our orders in. My boyfriend got the Chicken Barbacoa and I got the Chicken Bacon Siracha Mac & Cheese. When our meals came, they looked nothing like the pictures inside the menu or the descriptions that came with it. They were half the size of the portions shown. We never complain so again, we tried our meals encouragingly and were thoroughly disappointed. My entree had no flavor, the bacon was barely cooked, and I kid you not came with three pieces of broccoli. My boyfriends came with one tiny speck of cilantro and no yogurt crema sauce as it had implied.      In the midst of our meals, our waitress came over, asked how the meal was & offered us dessert while we were still eating.. We declined and ""finished"" soon there after. We waited 15 minutes for our server to come back and ask if we were finished. We waited another 10 minutes for her to return with our check.       We go out very often and are always kind and understanding, but this was such a let down for us. We went in on a Sunday, the place was not extremely busy, and no part of our meals were appetizing or what they appeared. Had we not been starving, we wouldn't have even eaten half of them.      Overall, I can only give BJ's one star, and I do not even think they deserved that. There are so many wonderful places in Burbank, and we will absolutely never be back. Just a headsup to all others who also heard ""amazing"" things about BJ's Brewhouse."
Jen P.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",0,9,1,1.0,1/8/2017,"We have been waiting for 45 minutes to get our food, completely unacceptable. Second time it happens at a BJ's. NEVER coming back."
Juanita D.,"Los Angeles, CA",333,600,568,3.0,8/29/2013,"Lord have mercy, their Happy Hour, ""Snack"" menu & beer flights here hit the spot. I only went to BJs back in the day for pizookies (this was pre 21). Now being way over 21 and a craft beer drinker, I was told that BJ's brewed their own beers and had flights.  __________________________________________ FOOD/SNACKS: // Chicken Wontons - both the Thai & Buffalo are beyond tasty // Mini Bruschetta - yes please! light, refreshing and with a side dipping sauce that will knock your socks off. // Gourmet Mac & Cheese - good, but needed some salt & pepper  // Cajun Fries (on their BBQ menu) - salty goodness // Buffalo Wings - definitely have a kick to them, be ready to get messy! // Beignet - holy god.. I was expecting a little old fried donut however this is shareable.... it's a huge beignet topped with ice cream, strawberries and whipped cream. BEER: Their best deal on the menu! For around $6-12 bucks you can get a small or large flight set with a variety of their handcrafted beers. I've been impressed by all of the beer samples I've had here. __________________________________________ In all honesty, I love to kick back here... enjoy some beer and a table of appetizers. The service is average probably because of how busy this place is. It's not a 5-star restaurant so I don't expect that. One time there was no toliet paper in the womens restroom which is really incovenient - you regularly have to wave down your waiter. I mean these are things that happen all the time, so I don't let it get the best of me. Also, I dislike the ""valet only"" option... why am I paying for valet in Burbank?! Park across the street in the mini lot like I do for free! (dates/times apply) Extensive menu - something for all to enjoy. I try really hard to not focus on the calorie breakdown... If I did I'd probably NEVER dine here, hah."
Nicole L.,"Los Angeles, CA",27,44,,1.0,2/11/2017,"This is an updated review going from 2 stars to 1 and that's being generous. One of the last times we came to this restaurant there was a super long black hair in my boyfriends salad which was met with zero empathy and I felt like I was begging for a fork. Tonight just further justified my last review. First I was told to input my phone number so I could be texted when my table was ready. We grabbed a drink in the bar and when our friends arrived the host told us they had tried calling us for our table a while ago. Why did I put in my number again? Anyway, the waiter was so absent from the table it was unreal. It was at least 20 minutes between sightings and some of those weren't even for our table. We waited a good 20 minutes for our first round and another 20 for the second. There were no napkins or utensils on the table. We had finished our appetizer and they were finally bringing the food out before I even had the opportunity to ask for them. Then he only brought 2 utensils even though there were 4 of us at the table. If he had been more attentive he probably could have sold 2 more rounds of drinks but we didn't see him often enough. It felt like we had to ration the drinks we did have because who knew when we might get more. The restaurant was busy but I didn't see him serving any other tables until they sat a large party nearby (which he shared with another waiter). Whenever I looked around he was nowhere in sight. Tonight was one of the worst experiences I have ever had in a restaurant if not the worst. The only reason I keep coming back is because the food is, for the most part, (minus the hair) very good. In the future we will try to meet at another location even though it will be much further for our friends to drive."
Suzy S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,2,3.0,3/30/2016,"I came here with 9 people for a little birthday get-together. We chose to sit outside because it was available right away. The server was super nice but was pretty forgetful when it came to the orders. A couple of us had asked for water with our drinks and she never showed up with the waters. One of us had ordered a Guacamole Deluxe Burger (I think that's the name) and there was no guacamole in the burger. I ordered the Crispy Jalapeno Burger and it was just a plain hamburger. Two people had ordered pasta that wasn't even the correct type. Maybe we had gotten other peoples orders, who knows? We obviously told the server and she didn't fuss or anything and she kept apologizing.  Now for the food itself, it was pretty meh. Nothing too special. The burger I had was cooked to my liking but lacked in any sort of flavor. My friends said the same thing about their food. The only thing we all agreed was good was the wings we got as an appetizer. Our drinks were also way too sweet, hence the need for water. We unfortunately didn't get the infamous pizookie because it was getting late and we all just wanted to go home. All in all, this place is pretty average. I've been to other BJ's and they've been really good. I give this place a 3 star rating for the server being an absolute doll even though she was forgetful and the whole atmosphere of this place. The food itself gets a 2 star rating."
Anna I.,"Los Angeles, CA",516,216,1281,2.0,11/3/2015,"The only reason I stepped foot into this terrible restaurant is because my friend was craving the pazooki or wtv it's called. The waitress was the rudest person I've ever met. The food was terrible. I would rather eat dried road kill than come here again. Oh, the pazooki was great but it's really not worth coming here."
Ernest M.,"Los Angeles, CA",624,284,672,5.0,1/21/2015,"Shout out to patrick!  So being a chain restaurants I don't usually like to go unless it's a birthday party someone is hosting. If I want to generally go and eat the top of the list would not be BJ's. ( Note: i use to come here every night after work when I use to be at macaroni grill and like drop like 1/3 of my tips here and have a great time)  I came to meet up with a friend here since a lot of the restaurants close around 8pm. We played catch up and Patrick did a wonderful job. I use to be a waiter so I always notice the little things that they do. (timeliness, attitude, knowledge and all that fun stuff) If he was to be certified as a waiter I would definitely give him a job well done.  Food was good, service on point, and even hooked us up with a surprise dish! WE were eternal grateful and we would come back and see him again. Good job Patrick!"
Avo B.,"Colorado Springs, CO",3,10,4,2.0,9/17/2016,"Came to enjoy a nice dinner with my friends. After waiting a little over 90 minutes for the food, the food tasted horrible. Ribs where dry , even the Pizookie was dry and burnt.  If you enjoy spending 3 hours at a restaurant you would Bj""s"
Godfrey W.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,31,2,2.0,2/28/2016,"Four us decided we wanted the Pizookie, so decided to head here, since we were roaming around the area, the staff was friendly, but I did notice that they didn't ask if we wanted a refill for our drinks. -10 points in service. The Pizookie was all the yums, never having it prior til that day, didn't know what to expect but the other three liked it, so I guess that's a good sign? +20 for desserts Probably won't be coming back here. There are other places for foods."
Lynne N.,"Burbank, CA",0,8,,2.0,8/4/2015,"My husband and I have given this place so many tries. ""Maybe the service will be better this time. It's been a while."" After trying seven times over several years, we've finally given up. Now, the food is not bad, and the beers are great. But every other BJ's I've ever been to is so much better. I get the impression that they're just doing the bare minimum. And the service is so bad that you'll leave 40 minutes later than you intended, because you couldn't get your beer and your food.  Go to any other BJ's. This is just not worth it."
Karen F.,"Burbank, CA",28,194,4,4.0,8/11/2016,Best Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms (appetizer) they just melt in your mouth! I will absolutely be ordering them when I return.  Service is always nice and accommodating.
John N.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,2,2.0,3/26/2017,"The food here is always good and it's a big and busy place. Our server was accommodating and refilled drinks quickly. Our order, however, took 90 minutes to come out (for a party of 3), and was cold. Come on a full stomach because you will be starving by the time you get your food."
