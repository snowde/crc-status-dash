Rebecca S.,"Whittier, CA",90,86,41,3.0,6/22/2016,"Food is good, but service is lackluster,  especially app ordets and take out.  2 employees at front desk see me walk in to the take out desk.  No one is there,  yet im the one who had to ask them for help in getting someone.  I ordered take out on the app at 144 pm,  got my food at 220 pm.  I still left a tip.  Ridiculous! Oh,  and it wasn't that busy as i could see 4 or 5 employees hanging around goofing off at front desk.  I order here quite often,  but the service needs work.  I know it's not a 5 star restaurant but Jesus... We are still customers and a quick acknowledgment or even a fake sense of urgency won't kill anyone.  The take out girl did seem nice though and offered me water while i waited.... Forever."
Sitrak S.,"Glendale, CA",44,12,1,4.0,2/18/2017,the first time I went there was on Valentine's Day with my girlfriend there was a long line but they didn't let us wait too long they let us choose our table & they were so nice with us the waitress was so nice too she came in to couple times to ask us if everything is still ok but she didn't come a lot because she didn't want to annoy us the orders were coming out within 15-20 mins even though we ordered a lot of stuff couple times my girlfriend asked them to take a picture of us & them instead of taking one they were taking more than one so I liked that place & im definitely coming back btw they we ordered their classic steak & it was delicious it was so tender & juicy & their floats are amazing too but the star in my opinion was the bazoki so if you're close by you definitely need to go there
Ingrid E.,"Paramount, CA",54,35,1,1.0,7/28/2016,"Not the best Bj's ot there. I went there the other day with my coworker for lunch. We usually go there for the lunch specials, especially the unlimited soup and salad special. The reason why I rated this place one star is we both got the wedge salad and the lettuce was yellow. The lettuce was not fresh at all! When we brought this to our waiter's attention he said that is fresh lettuce. When we asked for the second salad the waiter brought back the center of the lettuce missing since we had requested FRESH lettuce. I cannot say I enjoyed my lunch, because this made me feel sick. I do not think I will be returning to this location anytime soon."
Lala R.,"Glendale, CA",379,268,548,4.0,7/12/2015,"I like this place because the beer selection is pretty good, the food is usually good, and the service is on point. Most of the time anyway. Last night they sorta messed up with our pager and the seating situation but they corrected it and it ended on a good note. My steak was seasoned aggressively well and my drinks were delicious."
David M.,"Sunland-Tujunga, CA",87,6,1,1.0,3/21/2017,"Very bad experience today at this location. Arrived at 4pm, waited 5 minutes for waitress to come and take drink order. Waitress brought drinks right away and took our order then proceeded to flirt with a table in the bar which seemed to be her friends from high school, was not surprised. Salad and soup came out a little slow but not horrible. Now is when it gets exciting. The food expeditor brought out our food and gave it to the table across from us. The table accepted the salad which was a BBQ chicken salad but turned away the flat bread pizza. The other table started to chow away at the salad and made comments that this does not seem like what they order and we laughed. About 10 mins later our waitress decides to pull away from her high school friends and comes by our table and asks ""is there anything else I can get you"" ummm yeah what about our meal? She was dumbfounded with a blank stare. She obviously was not paying attention to anything but her high school boy friends. She said she would look into it. We waited another 20 mins with twice asking the pre occupied waitress where are meal is and she only once went back into the kitchen as she was too enthralled with her ""friends"". Finally we ask a different waitress and another waiter to get the manager and nothing for 10 mins, NOTHING. Our waitress walks by and we ask her for the manager and he/she never shows. We get up to leave and I mention to the front desk that we are leaving and to let the manager know since he can't be bothered to come talk to us that we are leaving and he can take the salad and soup off of our bill. And now the plot thickens..... As we are waking out the door a young deer in the headlights manager comes up and ask if he can help us. We explained everything to him and he says "" well I just got here at 5pm and have only been here for 9 minutes and proceeds to pull out his smart phone and show me the time, really? REALLY manager Mark? Wow no apology, no solution nothing. I ask him if there was no manager on duty prior to his arrival and he says he didn't know. Again, really? After a little more non sense out of the manager we left and to never come back to this location which is the closest to our house. Change of management at this location is in order. Off to California Pizza Kitchen it is. Just read through many of the other reviews  and am not surprised that countless other people experienced the same things I did today. ATTENTION BJS CORPORATE LEADERS. You have a serious problem at this location. Time to clean house starting with your GM, assistant mangers and the whole bunch."
May O.,"Arcadia, CA",0,5,10,1.0,6/12/2016,"Our family thought it we would give this BJs  mostly for convenience of location for our daughter's graduation dinner party of 11 people. Our ss what our graduate's request. We ordered pizza, sandwiches, pasta. After ordering, we waiting well passed 1 hr before being served COLD pizza and sandwiches arrived. Two orders were still not ready, my lemon chicken (thin piece of chicken breast) and quinoa chicken. Im a diabetic and had to search my purse for sugar because I felt the start of a  sugar low.  The server Alex kept apologizing and checked kitchen several times. NO ""manager"" came to check our table and orders. He only appeared after I complained about the SLOW kitchen service and he being the manager was not making sure his customers were taken care of. He never offered any bread or something to eat while we waited so long for our food. In hindsight, if we had known it would take so long to get our meals, we should have ordered appetizers. Never did we expect to wait 1 hr 15mins after we put in our orders. He did offer to comp the 2 extra late meals, but this won't resolve their internal problems.  Our server, Alexandra, was polite and kept apologizing for the slow kitchen. This was on a Thursday night at 8pm.  I cannot imagine how chaotic weekends are. I suggest the kitchen be expanded into the 2nd smaller unused bar area to improve service. Only reason there are any stars is to give credit to our server Alex who tried her best under the circumstances of poor management. We will not be returning to this location again. I hope other locations are not like this one"
Oscar C.,"Valencia, CA",3,42,20,1.0,11/13/2016,Came to dinner today and from the beginning everything went wrong. Out of the 7 orders 2 were the wrong ones and 1 plate was brought out almost 20 mins later. The food was cold and they were out of several items. The server seemed very stressed and busy. We were never offered refills. For the amount of money we paid we felt we over paid. I don't think we will come back again. We should've gone to Bobs Big Boy!
Steve K.,"Los Angeles, CA",141,226,497,3.0,6/16/2016,This location is smaller than I'm used to. Parking is in the structure next to the restaurant and it seemed like there wasn't enough space even with what seemed like limited capacity in the restaurant. The staff is generally nice though.
Jay Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,2,,1.0,6/30/2015,"Don't ever come here after 10pm. Service was very very poor...took 45minutes to get two orders of chicken wings, pitcher of beer, and a desert. Never coming here again..."
Alexis A.,"Glendale, CA",65,95,22,1.0,7/17/2015,Ugh where shall I start. This is my second awful service at this current bjs location.   First time:  Ordered a full rack of ribs. They brought out half. I told the server we order full he said he'll check on it. Then 25 minutes later they bring out the other half. And 5 minutes later someone else brings a full rack and said here is your full rack. No idea what happen there. However that half rack they brought out 25 minutes later we didn't touch because we were ready to leave!  Second time:  Waited 5 minutes for a someone to approach us for menus. We order drinks and appetizer as soon as she came. Following another 5 minutes we ordered wings it took 40 minutes!!!!! We asked for the check the same time the wings came. Ridiculously slow services waiters and waitresses just standing around when our food was probably just hanging out in their kitchen.  I will not return to this location!!!
S. Alicia S.,"Burbank, CA",2046,670,3300,4.0,8/19/2014,"The USPS in Burbank was so hot inside. I got some stuff, but needed a cool place to write and pack. So I decided to grab lunch at BJ's. The hostess and waiters dealt with my wackiness today. They had really spacious booths. Also, there's a menu just for lunch. How cool is that.... I ordered a garden salad with raspberry ice tea. However, I had to order a chicken choice for my salad. The waiter recommended BBQ Chicken. It was so gourmet and fancy. The salad was good. Great ambiance. Good prices. Nice lunch."
G S.,"Burbank, CA",0,3,,2.0,11/26/2016,"I've gone here a bunch of times and ALMOST EVERY TIME it's taken over an hour to get our food. Recently I ordered online and when I showed up, picked it up and took it home - it was all wrong. The funny thing is the label's on the boxes had the correct order - but the f**king food inside was completely off. Furthermore, whenever I approach them about this - it's like they're making it my fault some how. You'd figure with so many screw ups they'd be ready and willing to make it right and give you like a percentage off or something. They really need better management and - from how it appears - a much better kitchen staff. It's a damn shame because I've experienced so much better at difference locations. This one just needs to get it's sh*t together. Big time."
Leon D.,"SUNLAND, CA",0,41,,3.0,7/28/2015,First one there today Managed to get order wrong Welcome to Burbank
Ritzi I.,"Studio City, CA",205,129,424,2.0,5/25/2015,"Came here for my niece's bday dinner. It was during Memorial Day weekend and they werent packed. At all.  We got there around 10pm. We were seated right away and our server took our drink orders. Half an hour passed and they barely took our order for appetizers. For that length of time we had already decided what were gonna have as our main course. 2 parties came after us and they have already been served their appetizers while we were still waiting for ours. I called our waiter's attention to ask what was going on. He said its because we ordered steaks and those take a little bit of time. I said, ok thats understandable, but the appetizers shouldnt take that long. Then he said he was gonna check. Couple mins later the Manager (Im assuming she was the Manager) approached us and she was very nice and she apologized and that she saw the time of our order and she didnt know what happened either as to why it took so long, according to her, the appetizers that we ordered shouldnt have taken that long. She was very polite the whole time and I respect that. All in all, we probabaly waited about an hour and 10mins just to be served appetizers.  Now the food.  The quality of the Calamari rings was wack! It tasted different, it used to be light and crunchy, now its all greasy and chewy and it was a little bland. We had the Gourmet Mac n Cheese and that was good, also the fried artichokes, I didnt like those very much. I ordered the Ribeye steak medium well with the side of filaf rice and chicken tortilla soup. The chicken tortilla soup was a bit salty. My cousin who came later ordered spinach dip and chips. Refer to the picture i posted of the tortilla chips of how greasy they served it to us. Dont they let it sit on a napkin or at least shake of the residual oil? Idk if the regular main cook was off that day or whats going on?  By the end of dinner, I got the bill and they waived all our appetizers. They only charged us for the main course and the drinks, which I appreciate, thank you BJ's, but I didnt come to get free food. I am more than willing to pay, obviously, but service sucks. I would understand if they were crazy packed, but they werent. What happened??"
Ashley W.,"Los Angeles, CA",25,7,,1.0,9/22/2015,Oh that was unfortunate...  Though beautiful in appearance the food was in fact awful!  The price does NOT match the quality.  Our waiter was perpetually MIA. The potatoes were nearly inedible. A paste so thick and dry I could have hung a shelf with it or built a brick wall to last the ages..  The chicken was barely seasoned and poor quality.. Like discount bulk chicken from a bin.. Will not order balsamic glazed chicken again. My husbands burger was basic ordinary nothing great..  just is what it is.  The Gluten free pizookie was very burnt and overly sweet.  I will try a BJs at a different location and hope for better quality and service.
Sharon H.,"Irvine, CA",124,122,101,3.0,6/14/2015,"So our Mother's Day lunch reservations was at 11:30am... Didn't get to order our food until 12:00pm. We were one of the first groups to arrive... Others came after us, got their food and was almost done, before we even got our food. I called and requested to speak with the manager. He name is Ashley. I told her what was going on, she asked if I was here and came over.. 12:47pm our food arrives as Ashley is speaking with me. I told her the service we are receiving is unacceptable... She said a few things and realized whatever she was saying we're sounding like excuses. She was very apologetic and stated they should've been more prepared for the rush due to Mother's Day. I appreciate that she understood that. Ashley, indeed, made things right and accommodated us for the bad service received.  Thank you Ashley. A tip for the GM: it's better to be overstaffed than under."
N K.,"Tucson, AZ",0,1,,1.0,2/25/2017,Extremely slow service.  Requested items never brought to table. Food was good but over 3 hours door to check was too long to make it worth the trip.
Emily H.,"GRANADA HILLS, CA",55,5,1,3.0,5/28/2016,"We love the pizza here but the service is slower than a turtle running a race in peanut butter! Our waitress was not very friendly and hard to get ahold of.  The best part of coming here is their infamous pizzokie. My personal favorite is the Oreo pizzokie, it's a dessert lover's dream!"
Jeremy W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,15,,1.0,11/7/2016,"I've been to this BJ's multiple times and I have never had this kind of experience. I had a decent party with me and it wasn't super busy. We ordered our food around 7:50-8 and didn't start seeing things until about 8:45-9. Prior to receiving the food, I requested a manager and that took an additional 10-15 minutes. I told him what was going on and instead of him trying to solve the issue, he apologized with a very nonchalant attitude. He later brought out food that was eventually sent back because it was too cold. Our waiter was not really seen until it was time for the ""check.."""
Doug K.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,17,2,3.0,8/3/2016,"We where excited to find the right by the Hotel. I love BJs. In all the others we are in and out in about 1 hour. Here we were stuck for a 2 hour tour. I don't know if it was the wait staff or the kitchen. Food was not as hot as usual. It was good, but not great like usual. We won't go back to this location."
