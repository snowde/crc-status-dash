Trisha G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,1,2.0,9/2/2015,"Just brought my to go order home and for the third time in a row, the food is terrible! Somehow when I'm there the food is better, but the second I place a to go order its as if they give out the crappy portions that should've been thrown out because by the time you notice, you'll be home and can't do anything about it. I have a new born baby so to get the chance to grab food, even takeout, is a blessing so to only be continuously disappointed is a huge bummer.  My crispy fried artichokes were cold and soggy in the middle and the crackers with my ahi poke were so undercooked, I don't even think they were fried at all. It takes a lot for me to take the time to write a review, so please don't take it lightly. Order to go with caution."
Kim K.,"Burbank, CA",145,573,3279,2.0,8/11/2012,"BJ's Restaurant & Brewery = Burbank So we went to BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse tonight, 8/10/12 with reservations that were made earlier in the day for a table top of 10 at 7:30.  We were told they only seating available to accommodate that large of a group would be on their outside patio.  (Yea.. fun. It was only 109 in Burbank today).  But that's fine.. the wind was slowly settling in.  I was told they had my table and were just cleaning it up and they'll be right with us.  Approx. 15 min. later, I jokingly went up to the same guy and asked, whatever happened to that table for Kim??  He gave that look of, ""Crap.. where did that go"". After a moment to regain his composure, he had us follow our waitress out to the back patio, So the work begins.  We all just sat down, no we don't know what we want for drinks (there's 5 pages of drinks) and no we aren't ready to order appetizers (again.. 4 pages min and we hadn't even opened the menu OR ordered our drinks!).  But thank you.  Little chit chatting  then spilt glass of water.  Oh the table is up in commotion.  LOL!  Waitress back.. so can I get you drinks.  Well, we just had an accident.  Um.. No not yet.  Thank you. Wait.. could we exchange this table for a stable table?  This one's wobbly.  Eyes roll, kids help.  New table in place.  Thumbs up! OK.. is everyone ready to order drinks?  Yes.  Start with the kids (the ones that look like line backers), work around.  Water with lemon.  Blonde Beer. Hefenweizen, couple pops.  Cool...  No appetizers?  No No thank you.  Oh wait, hello?  Um.   Whoo hoo..  Miss??  Waitress comes back, yes?  Do you sell potato skins?  Yes.  Well we would like an order.  Yes please. Thank you. So you ready to order dinner.  Yes.  Finally.  Please start with the kids (I think they've become full backs by now).  Couple root beer floats, fish & chips, pizzas, burgers, etc.'Great!  Um. could I get a refill of my lemonade.  uhh Sure. Food came.  Everything seemed to par.  Fish and chips were quite nice.  Not to oily.  LOVE LOVE LOVE the thin cut fries!  BONUS!!!  Root beer floats were awesome!  Pizza.. eeehh.  Nothing to write about here.  Overall food decent.   Can I get anything else?  Everyone no no no no... um, yes.  Um hello.  yooo hooo.  It's ok.  No, what is it you want?  WAITRESS!!!  Did you want a drink.  Yes... Just a beer with my pizza.  HELLO MISS... yes?  Yes.. she would like a beer with her pizza.  Ok.  Beer first.   Tick tock tick tock.  Ding.. there's the pizza.   Here's some extra root beer for your floats.  Cool, thanks.  :)) Holy crap!!!  No one told me don't mix the root beer float mix with the soda!!  Bwahahahaha!!  It was like a mentos and coke explosion!!!  Damn it.  LOL.  We need more napkins!!  Next.. is there anything else I could get you?  Um yea.. we had another accident.   We need more napkins.  Ok  20 napkins later.  We're good. Are you Gil? Yes.  Here. Sets down a mini pazookie with no candle.  Walks away.   Wow.. really??  We come here with 9 people to celebrate our friends birthday and our waitress apparently doesn't have time to sing or even smile!  Hell.. a candle would of been great!  We have been here multiple times before to celebrate birthdays and we've always been sung to.  Matter of fact the other group outside seemed to have had 2 birthdays sung to them.  What are we chop liver?? Fast forward to checks.  Mine has someone else's item.  Theirs is missing it.  Can you fix it?  Waitress (Rachel) states, can you just put the payment in so I can take them.  I have like 6 other tables inside.  WOW!!  So we just settled up with each other and when she came back she decided she would change the bills to the correct bills.  Ugh.. ok, no worries.  OH WAIT!!!  They added on 17% gratuity to the bill.  Now mind you, I don't mind gratuity being added to groups.  Especially when they've gone through the trouble of at least trying to keep our bills separate.  But what is really starting to bother me is waitstaff NOT STATING there has been a 17% gratuity added.  And then to top it off, they have an additional tip spot to tack on a higher tip if desired and total.   Thought about putting a number in there and subtracting it!  WORST SERVICE EVER!!!   Listen BJ's Management.... hire waitstaff that can handle groups or don't give them to the groups and then give them 6 other tables inside!  Apparently Rachel doesn't like that!  Also, its just sneaky.. make it policy that if you have added tip, make the server state the fact.  It makes for good practice and honesty.  Probably the deal breaker for us ever going back.   :( Thanks for letting me share. Here's the break down: Food is a 4. (loved the fish & chips. Root beer floats yummy.  Pizza's ehhh.  Service a 2. (rude, slow and overwhelmed)  Bathrooms 2 (no tp, trash cans over flowing) Atmosphere 3 (light out on patio, one was broken all together) Staff 2 (unfriendly, especially the ones taking their breaks on the patio on their phone) Parking $3.50.  What??"
Kassy S.,"San Fernando, CA",13,53,34,3.0,6/8/2015,The food is amazing and the drinks are good however the service is super slow. By the time my friend got her pasta the rest of us where done with our food we ordered the pizukis and they took forever to come. Our waitress was awesome
Jess D.,"La Crescenta, CA",147,218,156,2.0,7/14/2015,Service: ok  Food: small cold portions that are tasteless and overpriced
Maria S.,"Burbank, CA",16,10,1,2.0,5/10/2015,Both the service and food were awful. We also found hair in one of the appetizers. Won't come back again for sure
Kay M.,"Granada Hills, CA",37,27,,5.0,7/17/2016,This was my first time coming to bjs. My friend and I went straight to the bar section the bartenders there were very nice and helpful.I oredereda mojito which was very refreshing and well made I also ordered the California flat bread pizza which was very good and a good portion to share ..I was very happy with the service
Juan Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,18,18,1.0,6/6/2015,It took 15 minutes for our server to realize that we were waiting to order. There was a family that came after us that was attended before us. The food was good but he fact that the service was lagging brought this rating to a one star. I decided to give this location a second chance but unfortunately this location aims to disappoint.
Lorraine F.,"Lynwood, CA",1,31,1,3.0,10/20/2015,"Ate at this place on a Sunday for a birthday celebration. The wait was not long at all despite the busy afternoon. The service was just astounding.  Our waitress was warm and very cheerful. She made certain our table had everything we needed. Took our order and everything was out in a few minutes. I ordered the shrimp scampi pasta and added artichokes to the dish.  I like that I didn't get hassled for asking for additional veggies in my pasta like Olive Garden.  I was really surprised when all he food was brought out at the same time by different staff members. I hadn't had that experience at other chain restaurants so it was quite lovely for all of us to start eating together.  I didn't  give this place 4 stars because my food didn't taste like much. The presentation was pretty but the taste matters too. Also, the little dishes that are provided for the appetizers were dirty!  Only reason I give this place 3 stars is because of the service from our waitress."
Lynn V.,"Granada Hills, Los Angeles, CA",36,84,30,1.0,3/1/2015,"The only reason why I went to this location was because it was a coworkers going away dinner. We did a reservation for 18 people and did call two days ahead of time. You would think the management would be decent enough on holding a table for 18 at 6PM. I understand that most chains/restaurants are busy, but what's the point of reserving if we're going to end up waiting the exact same time as people who just come in?  Anyways, our reservation was at 6, but they decided to sit people in that area and they obviously can't kick people out of the restaurant (which is understandable), but when you have a reservation and we warned them we got 18 people. I think those tables should of been saved at least by 5PM.  So we pretty much waited for our table for about an hour and a half Yes, an hour and a half to get seated. Let me just name the issues we had at this place in numerical order. 1) We got to our table around 7:30. Thank you for the ""complimentary appetizers"", but this doesn't sum up to your customer service. 2)It took over 10 minutes just to get our drinks. 3)We sat at our table staring at each other because we couldn't find our waiter and didn't take our orders about 30 minutes later. 4) Food took about 45 minutes - 1 hour to get to us. The 1 hour entree was done, but given to a different table....and when the entree came, it was made incorrectly.  We spoke to a guy in a plaid shirt and all he said was ""okay."" This is my third time at this BJ's and I still haven't gotten good customer service for the third time. I think I'm okay not returning to this restaurant."
Julie O.,"Burbank, CA",11,156,528,5.0,9/19/2014,always a great experience here at BJ's....   my sis started with the Jeremiah Red which she's a huge fan of I tried the  Berry Burst Cider which I really liked very light beer with that sweet berry taste. very fresh for a hot night. Our fun waiter recommended this combo drink The Jeremiah mixed with the Berry Burst.. Oh what a great taste....  Now I'm a fan... I recommend anyone who wants a beer but with that fruity taste in it ask for this combo....got the Ahi Poke very good combo with the beers we had. A great relaxing night. ...
Big L.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,242,397,4.0,9/16/2015,Great happy hr lotta TVs lotta beer. Long wait for happy he chicken wings. Parking structure close by & free is very convenient. Lotta couples no single ppl. Fair prices but I only visit during happy hr. Refuse to pay full for this stuff.
Marisa S.,"Pacoima, Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,1.0,1/8/2017,"First of all, I ordered a tortilla soup and it was EXTREMELY salty, i then asked the waitress for a clam chowder instead and it was just as bad. I took one bite and left it alone. It took forever, almost an hour, to get the main dishes! Then when my food came it was cold and tasted like microwaved food, i ordered the big appetizer dish that comes with different types of appetizers, my wings were soggy and barely even warm. My mozerella sticks also, the cheese wasn't even melted. I literally took a couple bites of each and lost my appetite, spent money for nothing, worst BJ's I've ever been to"
Nima S.,"Los Angeles, CA",38,23,7,1.0,7/22/2016,"Not too sure what our severs name was, can't remember if the guy even told us or not, but I do remember the crappy service. He did not ONCE smile... How can you work a job where customer face to face time is your highest priority and not even smile, that's no good.. I had ordered the Sriracha Queso Dip and the photo of the appetizer clearly shower chili, that wasn't the case when we received the dish, and that was pretty disappointing.. Ordered the mini deep dish pizza which came out uncut, had a dull butter knife and nothing else so I had to sit there sawing at the thing.. By the end of the check our server came back and delivered the check with absolutely no happy hour prices when we ordered happy hour items, informed the server about it and he said it was weird (like he didn't even care to look at the bill when he printed it out and just wanted a bigger tip, or what?) and he said he was gonna get it sorted out with his floor supervisor. 20 minutes passed by and we finally got the correct check back which was a whopping 50% lower than the original incorrect check, I will not be returning here."
Tamir K.,"Toronto, Canada",16,14,6,3.0,1/16/2016,"Great variety, decent food, very friendly service.  Ordered the ribs and though it was a bit slow (crazy busy night, they were delicious.  Should really stock wet naps for a restaurant that serves ribs and wings."
A M.,"Arleta, CA",65,323,114,1.0,4/25/2016,"Came in on Sunday night for late night happy hour with my friends at around 10:01.  At around 10:07 we placed our orders; two of us ordered water and one of them ordered mineral/soda water, waiter said they had a bottle only, which was strange, but my friend told them to bring out the bottle with her food.  Then we thought about it and wondered why they didn't have fountain soda water when they have a fully loaded bar. She asked the waiter why they didn't have fountain soda water and he said I thought you wanted mineral water, she replied that she wanted either or, as she originally told him.  We placed our order right after.  I ordered my favorite buffalo chicken pizza no ranch, my friend ordered a buffalo chicken pizza no ranch no onions and my other friend ordered the BJ's special (I believe it is called)pizza.  I also placed an order for avocado rolls.  We got the avocado rolls like 10 minutes later, awesome, while we wait for our pizzas!   It was around 10:35 when the waiter came out to tell us that they had burnt our pizzas and they were working on getting new ones out....we were already flustered for waiting so long, but whatever at least he came to tell us.  We got our pizzas and mine or my friend looked NOTHING like the buffalo chicken pizza (as we order this frequently) it had chicken, bacon, cheddar, and who knows what else..... def not what I ordered, but was not going to ask for a replacement and wait 45 more minutes!  I told the waiter that that is not what I had ordered and he swore it was, he said there was nothing else he could do... wtf? ... the the ""buffalo chicken"" pizzas not what we asked for the the BJ special pizza was cold!  We were so upset and disappointed!  This has never happened here!  The waiter told us he spoke the manager and that our meal was comped.  We ate what we could as my pizza still had some burnt on it... and left, but before we left we spoke to the manager and he didn't seem to be in the know prior to the incident.  I hate when you plan on a good meal and it turns out to be a disaster!"
Lee R.,"Moorpark, CA",0,15,10,1.0,3/22/2017,"I work in the area of this BJ's location and recommended to a co-worked that we eat here, Tuesday 03/21/17.  The place was empty....only people there, were in the bar.  We both ordered burgers and were brought our drinks.  One hour later, our burgers were brought to our table!  I mentioned to the server, that I realize it probably was not his fault that our 10 minute items took 5 times longer than they should, to be brought to our table.  But I also mentioned that we were on our lunch break and it did not offer us time to enjoy our food.  He asked the manager to come over to our table, who literally threw her kitchen staff under the bus.  She told us that when it's slow, they get lazy.  I mentioned to her that there are several options in the area, Islands, Wood Ranch BBQ, Chipotle, Panera and that we should have gone to one of them.  She apologized to us again and said, she hoped that we would give them another chance.  She left and we were brought our check and no discount at all!?  After a 1 hour wait for a burger, not having time to eat and talking to the manager, no compensation at all.   Just an excuse and request to try again?  Why would I?  I would rather eat at Taco Bell, than ever eat at this location, at least I would get my food promptly."
Ed D.,"Los Angeles, CA",19,29,33,1.0,3/22/2015,"Came here by chance. Service was good. Food was shit.  Ordered calamari & BJs deep dish pizza.  Drinks were extremely sweet. Calamari was rubbery and greasy.  Pizza was way too salty, not enough marinara sauce, under cooked dough & greasy.  Will not return. Woke up the next day with a terrible stomach ache."
Sandra P.,"Burbank, CA",0,18,2,5.0,3/14/2016,This restaurant has the best steak i could ever have they are very nice here.great hospitality. People I advise u to come here you will love it.
Bunny B.,"North Hollywood, CA",46,124,2,2.0,4/17/2015,"Place has gone downhill.   To me, the pizza is super overpriced just for the mere fact of it being, well, pizza.   Tried several different pasta dishes, they all sucked.  Bland, lifeless and should be sold for $7, NOT $15 or more.  The only dish i loved was their Tuscon Chicken Lemon pasta - not on the menu anymore.  They serve shameful pastas! Their clam chowder, fries and sandwiches are pretty decent."
Meredith D.,"NORTH HOLLYWOOD, CA",1,22,,1.0,6/7/2016,"The service here is the worst, particularly for take-out orders. Literally every time I order something to-go, some part of the order is either wrong, or one item has clearly been sitting out a lot longer than the rest, or both. Plus it takes forever every time. The servers seem to understand the order clearly when they take it, but somewhere along the line it goes to hell. I don't know if it's the servers, their ordering system, or the kitchen - probably a combination of all three - but it needs fixing. I'm seriously done with this location. The food is usually good (albeit somewhat inconsistent) which is why I kept coming back, but after this last time round of chasing the right order while the rest of my food gets colder, I've had it."
