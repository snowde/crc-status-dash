Won't be going back there
Tiffany A.,"Burbank, CA",33,38,151,3.0,5/8/2016,A little disappointed this visit. I received a promotion to try the new app for 20% off discount. My boyfriend did everything through his phone with the app. When I got to the restaurant I realize the discount never went through and was told nothing could be done because the order was already closed out. They did comp my pazookie but the discount didnt quite add up. I just let it go because they were busy and my mother's day was already not going well. I won't be using the app again and I will need to start checking my receipt.
Robert F.,"San Marcos, CA",0,9,,1.0,3/10/2016,For the second time in 4 months the Food has really gone down hill. The fish and chips was the worst ever. My Wife had pizza and that too was just not good. 8pm at night not that busy and food took 45 mins. We just don't plan on returning.
Coco S.,"Herriman, UT",3,128,308,4.0,3/20/2016,We ordered take out from this location while staying in Burbank and we were pleasantly surprised that everything still tasted good (even the Pizookie). I especially love their deep dish pizzas and our order was ready pretty fast.
Trisha W.,"Los Angeles, CA",274,835,564,4.0,6/11/2014,"The first time I visited was back in 2004 at the Warner Center location and was a bit indifferent, I mean I thought it was good, but never gave it another chance until now. I came for dinner on a Friday night with some friends and we had a really lovely time. The wait for a table was fifteen minutes, but it felt like 20. We were seated and our orders were taken immediately. Our deep dish pepperoni extreme pizza was divine. It certainly isn't good for you, but it was a really tasty and rich in texture. The pizza was hot and puffy, but crispy on the outside, cheesy and memorable. We had a pint of BJ's Jeremiah Red for 5.50 a piece which I would highly recommend, it was very refreshing and light. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. The hosts were ok, one was welcoming and the other was very rude.  our bill for four was reasonable considering we ordered a medium pizza $20, a small $15, two beers, an irish root beer, a coke and a pizzukie for dessert our total was $82 after tax and tip. Overall good experience, will definitely come back here for a cheat day ;)"
Adrian L.,"Los Angeles, CA",49,38,13,2.0,4/21/2016,"It's a BJs, they're basically cookie cutter establishments that produce the same vacuum sealed aura as every other one does. Staff is wonderful but it still doesn't have the cleanliness that one my hope for out of something as prepackaged as this. Unless it's going for the edgy urban feel where you might catch a flu with your meal then yes their cleanliness is on point. I just wish for a little more sterile feeling rather than I just wiped the table with a dirty rag and hope you didn't notice vibe."
Jessica S.,"Colton, CA",9,260,10,3.0,2/20/2016,"The GM for BJ's contacted me, after seeing my previous review, and sent me a gift card, so I feel better about the whole experience. BJ's food is usually good, so I'm willing to give them another try."
Jacky A.,"Hawthorne, CA",130,48,5,1.0,3/28/2015,Service was great. Food was disgusting though.  Calamari was so greasy and tasteless.  California Burger was beyond soggy and fries were like refried. Pizza was salty and burnt. Even my ice tea tasted bitter. It was all gross. Maybe a new cook is needed. That's how bad you're food was.
Dominic P.,"Los Angeles, CA",24,178,31,5.0,10/24/2016,"Great job all around. From the comfort food, to the level of service. Nicest male waiter one could ask for during lunch. Very polite and professional hostess as well. Was unaware of the valet so I was a little disappointed in that I didn't have any cash to tip the valet. Will certainly return."
Mia P.,"Redondo Beach, CA",76,50,31,3.0,3/14/2015,"Let me start off with the fact that ""Im a people watcher""  soooooo i definitely liked the eclectic group of hipsterz, actors/actresses, wanna bees and  that comes out to this establishment. Me and the boo came out to get some drinks we stayed a block away at the holiday inn I had one of the flat bread pizzas and quite a few drinks, enjoyed it all. I didn't like that it took a waiter 15 minutes or more to acknowledge us after us sitting down even if it was to say be right with yah But other than that we had a great time on a crowded friday evening"
Emin S.,"Glendale, CA",11,77,15,1.0,5/23/2016,"The service was great!!!! But omg the food was absolutely horrible, ordered their baby back ribs and a mushroom pizza!!!! The ribs were so salty it was able to eat even half of it when I was starving, and the pizza was extremely soggy and gross!!!!!"
Daniel L.,"Canyon Country, Canyon Country, CA",0,3,,5.0,6/10/2017,"This is a long overdue review and thank you to the staff at this B.J.'s Restaurant.  Back in January 2017 I was trying to plan a last minute surprise birthday dinner for a friend and about 20 guests.  I called several ""fancy"" places that were just too expensive for our casual affair, and I tried a few other restaurants in the Burbank area and they just couldn't accommodate our party on the date that worked for everyone.  I called B.J.s and the manager (I think his name was Mike) said sure no problem.  20 people?  No problem.  On Saturday night at 7pm during prime dinner rush?  Sure no problem.  He made a reservation for us, they put together a bunch of tables, and we were able to have a nice fun time at our birthday girl's favorite restaurant.  I couldn't believe how easy it was.  This has always been a nice place to get a beer or have a pizza but this was a true example of great customer service."
Brandon G.,"Burbank, CA",59,2,,2.0,1/14/2015,"If I had to summarize my entire experience, it would be blah. I saw on   that BJ's was running a promotion for buy one entree get one free. I saw the yelp reviews were pretty low, so I went in with VERY LOW expectations. I figured I would just have a nice Tuesday night dinner, and it'll be pretty middle of the road, but overall decent experience. I walked and get seated. The bar looked great, the actual interior of the restaurant is very nice and fun, lots of tvs, nice art/wall features etc. We're seated, my waiter was very nice dude, but when I asked what he recommended, he didn't really seem like an expert on the menu. I asked what he liked, he just told me what he saw go out of the kitchen a lot, and he basically just read off the menu the descriptions of dishes etc. So that wasn't that reassuring. I ordered one of their pizzas, half BJ's special or whatever they call it (it's their ""famous"" combination) and half chicken bacon ranch as just something ""out of the box."" My girlfriend ordered seared scallops, so I figured it would be a pretty easy 2 dishes to knock out. I ordered a beer, and it took 10 minutes for it to show up, and it was served in the cold glass, but  the beer wasn't TOO cold. I've never waited that long for a beer to be poured into a glass, and then it's not at a proper temperature? I can deal with the wait if they were slammed, but this is a Tuesday night. There was a decent amount of people in the bar area, but the rest of the restaurant was empty. Also the temperature of the beer is not the servers fault, but more of the brewmaster, bartender, or whoever was in charge of the kegs. Besides the wait and the temperature, the beer was OK, nothing great, but if it was at a colder temperature, it would be much more enjoyable.  When we got the food (which came in a reasonable amount of time compared to the beer), I was immediately disappointed with the quality. My pizza, although advertised as deep dish pizza, was really a pan pizza (with actually pretty thin-for-pan pizza size) absolutely covered in toppings. Every square inch had some sort of pepper, pepperoni, sausage etc. And the toppings were very meh in general, nothing really too fresh, the chunks of tomato's on the Bj's signature side tasted like they were canned or preserved or something, it just didn't taste fresh. The dough was also very doughy (not too crisp) and flavorless. I mean, the pizza wasn't terrible to eat or anything, but for $20 price tag its insanely overpriced. It really really reminded me of Pizza Hut quality, except sloppily put together. That's right, a phoned in Pizza Hut pizza with a $20 price tag. Yuck. My girlfriends scallops were an absolute joke in terms of size. They were pretty rubbery consistency, and were VERY small and thing, as if they sliced them in half to yield more on the plate. Again, the taste of the scallops weren't BAD, but the ingredients and the amount of food were less than average, mediocre at best. Overall, even with the promotion, I would have rather gone somewhere else for dinner that night. I think it's complete garbage that those entrees were $20 (for the pizza) and $15 (for the scallops) when you use terrible ingredients, sloppy presentation, which screams to me overall cheap business practices. My service was decent, the waiter was nice and friendly, but he wasn't that knowledgeable about the menu, and the beer was very average for a place that supposedly has signature beers. Personally, it offends me for a restaurant to fool people that it's more high end eating and cheap out on the execution. I can go down the street and pay half the price and go to places with nice food.  There are much better options in downtown Burbank to eat... go to any of those other places. ANY OF THEM. If you want to go to a place similar to BJ's but uses good ingredients, go to Gordon Biersch on San Fernando, which has similar prices but MUCH better selection and ingredients (like night and day difference.)"
Joshua W.,"New York, NY",269,97,68,4.0,7/29/2015,I've never heard of this restaurant until my visit. Reminds me of Houlihan's... In the sense that it's American dining and cuisine. I recommend this place. They have items that will appeal to all pallets.  From the health-conscious to meat consuming carnivores. From salads to bison burgers to pizza - they have it all here!
Matthew S.,"Holly Ridge, NC",0,20,14,1.0,12/17/2015,"Horrible service. Made a reservation that was not honored. When we were finally seated, they tried to put us at a table for 4 when our party was 6 adults and 2 kids. We asked to talk to a manager and he would not honor our request. Horrible customer service. Will never try to eat here again."
Ronald A.,"Oceanside, CA",129,75,37,1.0,1/20/2015,"This being a chain restaurant, I would assume the place is pretty consistent with other BJ's locations. After eating here, I can see why this particular location has a low rating.  The Bad:  They messed up our order. I asked for 1/2 medium great white, 1/2 BJ's favorite.  What we received was 1/2 Mediterranean, 1/2 Bj's favorite. I didn't notice until halfway through eating the pizza (since I started with the Bj's favorite. I noticed it right away because The mediterranean slice had some peppers and was a little spicy, and i do not like Spice. I asked our server if there was a mistake, and she admitted that the pizza she brought wasn't the pizza we ordered (although she entered it correctly).  She called the manager, and the manager asked us what happened and in his exact words ""what can we do to fix it?"" I just asked for a small great white pizza, since that was exactly what I was craving.  It arrived, and we ate it. At the end, the bill comes, and I noticed we were charged for the small great white. No discount, didn't remove the wrong pizza we received. NOTHING. I don't really see the point of bringing the manager over.  The Good:  The food is tasty. When we received our correct order, it was delicious.  In short,  I don't appreciate getting the wrong order and even after admitting it was incorrect, the staff doing nothing to fix it.  Before dining here, I didn't bother to read reviews because I've always had great experiences in the past with this Chain restaurant. Now, I can see why this place has such a low rating.  I will never return to this location and I urge others to do the same until they can get their act together."
Martin N.,"Glendale, CA",0,10,4,1.0,4/27/2016,"Apparently you owe them and the workers by asking for service, their service level is bellow 0, and you have to look around for couple of minutes in order to find someone. And God forbid you change your spot 10 feet away just to have a better view of the TV and its other waiters session  then good luck to you. Your previous"
A T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,,1.0,5/11/2016,Worst slowest service ever 30 minutes waiting on appetizers and salads  waiter bringing wrong drinks
Andrew L.,"Santa Clarita, CA",1100,178,145,1.0,1/26/2015,This BJs use to be my favorite. The place is definitely not managed like it use to. Food came out cold and waitress rarely came by.  Will not be returning even if food was free.
Chris G.,"Los Angeles, CA",97,155,26,4.0,5/19/2015,"Came here for a friends birthday dinner.  Parking: valet requires gratuity. Or you can self park and walk all of 200 yards. Restaurant: clean and pretty spacious. No funny odors, except delicious food. Staff: the waitress handled our table of 9 great. She definitely was not a rookie. Only con is that she didn't smile the whole time. Little things like that matter to me, but eh maybe wasn't the best day for her Food: I've order quite a few things here. This time ordered burger. Was made right. Decent portion. Wasn't too crowded, but definitely not empty. It was Monday night How can I forget that pazookie. Man that thing has crack in it. I said I wasn't going to order one, but my friend offered some and I ate half. O_O I would definitely come back."
