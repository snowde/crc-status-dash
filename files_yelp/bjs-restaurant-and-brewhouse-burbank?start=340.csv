Bill L.,"VALLEY VILLAGE, CA",20,54,33,4.0,4/8/2016,"My friend and I had the Ribeye steaks. I had to send mine back to have a new one redone to Mid rare. The server brought it back and it was perfect. The manager came over to apologize, it was unexpected and shows how they care about their customers. The service is good. We wanted to try the salted Carmel Pizookie but didn't have room. Will have to save room next time."
Meriaa C.,"Burbank, CA",0,7,,3.0,5/8/2016,"Definitely go for the beers and pizookies, sometimes we go to eat lunch or dinner. The pizza is usually pretty good.. I have gotten a salad before it wasn't my favorite not one I'd get again. I recently had the calamari and I figured we were getting what the menu showed but try half the amount. I guess you could say I'm not a huge fan of the food but as far as a bar aspect and the perfection of the dessert they are pretty good and the only reason I really go to BJs. Service is always about the same great workers doing their jobs."
Patrick D.,"West Hollywood, CA",67,4,1,4.0,3/28/2015,"My friend and I arrived to BJ's last week,     Our host showed us the table, explained the menus and hoped we had a great experience. Waited for our server for about 15 minutes as she walked passed up a few times. Got us waters and asked if we were ready, I ordered the Spinach and Artichoke Dip and must I say, it was delicious. Minutes later we also order french fries and those were just as good as the dip if not better. She came back multiple times but my friend and i were just having conversation we forgot all about the food until our stomachs rumbled and we were immediately ready to eat. Our server came back, and we ordered a deep dish pizza. Overall, it was good but our service from our waitress was not so good.  I love the overall vibe of the restaurant, management is great and bathrooms are fairly clean. The restaurant has a great feel to it and portions of food are great! The kids would love it here too!"
Sunshine S.,"SUN VALLEY, CA",0,26,2,5.0,4/1/2016,"Shannon is awesome, so kind, quick and helpful.  The food was yummy,  especially the new dessert , delicious, highly recommend it. It's sooooo good"
Nicole U.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",192,685,219,3.0,1/22/2014,There was a slight mix up with my buffalo wings...traditional usually means bone in and not breaded. I ended up with boneless and breaded. They fixed it as quickly as they could and the finished product was tasty. Not too saucy and served with a huge side of blue cheese for a dipping sauce. I also had a side cesear salad which was fresh and crispy. Perfect keto (low carb) lunch. Friendly service. Parking can be a pain but we opted to park across the street and walk over.
Vardan T.,"VALLEY VILLAGE, CA",119,27,7,1.0,10/25/2014,"We decided to go to bj's tonight and we had the worst experience ever. The waiter acvidently dropped a cup and it shattered cutting my wife's finger very deep. The waiter went to get his manager, which showed up 5 min later. Everyone was staring at us while my wife's finger was gushing blood. The waiter had an accident we understand. But the fact that the manager was not concerned about my wife's well being was just wrong. People from other tables were helping us with napkins.  Never mind that we still had to pay for our dinner that we didn't eat is just amazing. I hope the manager looks really good on paper in front of corporate with his $50 profit."
Oliver P.,"PORTER RANCH, CA",839,24,22,1.0,4/14/2016,Calamari was the worst calamari I've ever had! It was cold and soggy :/ Didn't want to complain because our server was super nice but never ever ever getting it again! Do not get the Calamari!
Elaine P.,"Toluca Terrace, CA",1,29,116,3.0,1/30/2015,Service was so slooow.. Food was good though..
Shane L.,"Bristow, VA",164,64,31,3.0,5/24/2015,Service was my favorite! The food was good for having such a large menu. I had the California Burger with wedge fries and their home-brewed cream soda (highly recommended) and the peanut butter s'mores pazooki to finish for desert! Our server was very accommodating and sweet and the environment was very welcoming as well!
Pnut E.,"Roseburg, OR",0,3,,1.0,1/31/2016,The worst experience ever at a restaurant!!!!  Racist ppl who work here are sad!!!!!  Will NEVER be back!!!!!
Bobby E.,"Glendale, CA",4,36,,1.0,11/14/2014,"I just don't know where to start with this BJ's experience. First, if you are considering going here, DON'T! We used the app to dine in and order ahead. We arrived promptly at our pre-selected time. When we walked in, there was another couple waiting at the front. It was obvious they had not even been greeted yet. In the 5 minutes it tool for someone to finally acknowledge either of our existences, two employees stood at the take-out desk and did not say a word or look for anyone to help the people standing there for so long. Several other employee's walked by at that time without even a hello. The hostess finally showed up and could barely finish a sentence, it was bad. So we get our seats, have our server take our drink order (we had ordered the food in the app already). He bring our fries and leave, we had also ordered chili. About 5 minutes later he comes back and asks us if we also ordered soup. We confirmed and 5 minutes later finally got that as well. Did not see him again until we were ready to go. Further, he too seemed to be unable to talk very coherently. My guest and I were quite  sure most of the staff had been partaking in some booze on a slow night. Will not be back and could not possibly recommend this location to anyone. Third bad experience in a row and we are DONE! I guess this did not get posted the other day. Shame."
Vicki M.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,17,1,1.0,8/16/2016,"We were here 2 days ago for dinner. My great nephew wanted to come for his 18th birthday. There were 7 in our group. We waited a short time to be seated, then we were lead back into a corner booth by a side door and a server station. It was over 100 degrees out and most uncomfortable where we where sat. People kept going in and out of the door, letting the heat in. No air flow back there.    It took awhile for our server to come to our table, were he said he would be right back. He came back and took our drink order, one was wrong. It was corrected. He took our order. About 30 mins later, he brought over a server who he said was relieving him for a break. Another 20 mins later...still no food!!! We called over someone to check on our food. About 10 more mins the food started coming out one by one. It was like our food sat for a long time and was reheated, because the sandwiches had hard crust edges and the ham was hard! The kids pizzas had cheese melted in the plate. My potato wedge fries were burnt to a crisp! Should have taken a picture. They brought out some new ones, but they were taste less. Finally, the last pizza arrived almost 10 mins after the first person was eating.     There was no apology from our server or reason why this happened. We finally had the manager come over and by then I had already told the server to bring me my ticket, cuz I did my meal on a separate check. I had been there way too long and needed to drive a home, which was 30 minutes. I knew the rest of my group wanted to get dessert for the birthday boy, but I had to go. The manager said he could give us a gift card to make up for the poor experience, but since my card had already been ran he could not help me. The rest of the bunch got a $25 card for a bill that was over $90, not including tip. Unfortunately, I will not be going back there, and I was born and raised in Burbank. Bob's Big is always good, but no beer served. Head there if you are looking for fast service and a least you know what to expect!"
Stephh F.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,24,14,3.0,3/25/2016,"Yes most of these reviews are right service is usually always slow, sometimes the waiter/waitress is super nice sometimes they seem like they do not want to be there at all. So service is 2 out of 5 stars just because of the few friendly ones. The food used to be the best I've ever had even in more expensive restaurants. Their cheddar mashed potatoes are always great as well as the grilled asparagus and I can't forget the white chocolate macadamia nut pazookie. However, I used to absolutely LOVE the rib eye steak. It was never even close to being bad but recently these past couple of months the steak is usually disappointing. Sometimes it's ok but most of the time is dry and flavorless or cooked to well (I ask for medium) and rarely do they make it amazing like before. I've even sent back the steak a couple of times and it would still come back horrible. Food used to be 5 out of 5 stars now it's barely a 2 just because of the delicious side dishes and desert.  The beer on the other hand never disappoints, I always get the  jerramiah red (something like that) and at first it tasted kinda funky but now I crave it once in a while and would even come here just for the beer. So 4 stars on that. Last is the wait time before being seated, the parking lot is a little weird valet is only 3.50 but most of the time unnecessary. And what a lot of people don't know is that you can call in to be put in the wait list as long as you get there within 30 minutes. I usually do that and get seated within 10 minutes of going in or sometimes right away. Plus the girls in the front desk are usually very friendly. So 5 stars to that."
Luis M.,"Agoura Hills, CA",17,3,,5.0,4/22/2016,Claudia is the best part of BJ's. She makes my experience that much better. Nothing beets the awesome pizookies they serve. A definite must have for deserts.
Ben B.,"Yucaipa, CA",5,10,,1.0,12/8/2015,I was seated by the hostess on the patio at 6pm. I asked for water to start while I wait for my guest to arrive. It's now 730pm and know one has come to the table. Luckily my guest is running extremely late.
Ryan B.,"Burbank, CA",55,37,7,5.0,4/5/2016,I LOVE that new hostess Chloe I think her name was? So accommodating and such a beautiful and sweet young lady :)
Deb S.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,117,2,2.0,1/9/2015,"Came here 2 days before Christmas with my bestfriend. I don't know if it was this particular location, or just our server, but the service was very, very slow. I've been to different BJ locations and they were a lot quicker and attentive. We ordered the cajun pasta with shrimp and the jambalaya. The jambalaya was on point, but the cajun pasta hardly tasted cajun-y and just tasted like a tomato pasta. When we informed our server about this, she brought us dried red pepper flakes (the thing you put on your pizza) after 10 minutes. That didn't help. So we asked for hot sauce (another 5 mins) and barely finished half of the plate. The table next to us complained about their food too, asked to see the manager (which took about 10-15 mins) but I noticed they still had to pay for their food. I don't think I will ever come back to this location. I always get a pizookie (regardless of what my stomach is telling me) but I was discouraged from getting one due to the lack of service."
Armen G.,"Los Angeles, CA",601,282,624,3.0,1/15/2014,Great place to watch a sporting event and have some freshly brewed beers.  Food is ok here too I have never had any bad experiences with the food it has always been above expectations.
Mike H.,"Lake Balboa, Los Angeles, CA",146,303,354,3.0,10/23/2014,"Food is good as usual but the experience this time around was unpleasant. Charlie was our server and we came in for lunch. We were a half hour late even after we asked him to expedite the check for us. It took around 20 minutes to get us our checks,"" & change. It didn't take that long for us to get our food!!"
Lee S.,"Mountain View, CA",10,43,10,3.0,12/31/2015,"Phone ordered and they forgot half my order. I'm waiting for 30m and they didn't even start it. Didn't bother to refund me. Also they screwed up my other order, meanwhile the rest of my meal is in their hot box getting old.  A huge line of people for takeout built up behind me because none of their employees bothered to as what the heck was going on. I came in the next day to complain and instead of refunding me, which I wanted, they gave me a gift certificate, so I had to come back. Ugh. The manager of this place needs to get a clue and get fired. However, the food we ordered from the yelp menu (which is an outdated menu but they made it anyway) was actually really good. Not sure why they eliminated both the items we ordered from that menu."
