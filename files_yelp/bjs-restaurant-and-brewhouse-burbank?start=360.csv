Edward P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,10/30/2016,Horrible service and burnt food!  We drove up and there was a long line of cars for the valet who were so slow that the line went out into the street.  We got inside  and were told that we'd have to wait 15 minutes even though there were only two couples ahead of us and 25 open tables!  We ordered hors d'ourves and fish  for entrees which both seemed to take forever.  Then the fish was nearly brunt for one meal and just over cooked on one side on the other meal.  It was not even that crowded.  We will never come here again!
Matt B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,19,17,1.0,1/4/2016,"Bj's could care less about it's customers. Both the management at this location, as well as their corporate customer service, have been on par with the abysmal service that you get from Time Warner Cable. Absolutely horrible service top to bottom."
Lisa H.,"Los Angeles, CA",99,69,15,2.0,12/8/2014,"Wished I would've yelped this place before having one of the worst chain food experience. Have been hearing about BJ's this and that from a few people so since BWW was packed, we, thy bf and I, decided to make the extra block walk to this place. Again, I really wish I could turn back time to reading yelp reviews on why we should've gone elsewhere. Upon arriving, it was obvious the place was super duper packed seeing people stand around in the lobby area. We get it hence it was a Saturday night. When thy bf and I walked to the counter to check in, the lady w/ the curly hair didn't even look up but instead said, ""I'll be right w/ you"" typing away at her computer. You can tell she can't work well under pressure caz she was short w/ the other hosts. Waited a good 20 mins before getting seated which we didn't mind since we were keeping up with our FanDuel line ups. Woohoo for winning that night btw. Our server was pretty average. None of your above and beyond for the extra tip moolah type. Took our orders and left. Pretty much saw her only 5 times; introduction, took our order, called her to give us ranch, gave our bill and took our money. Womp womp. Food was AWEFUL! Here's our order: - New Orleans Jambalaya / Worst ever. Thy bf says it tasted like wood haha - Calamari / Should've been called small calamari rings w/ a giant ball of deep fried batter - BJ something burger / MORE no bueno b/c how can anyone do bacon wrong???? These people can!  - Strawberry splash / Should be strawberry crap b/c wth WAS that crap? I'm sorry, $9.50 for that small amount of alcohol w/ whatever strawberry jam stuff and whip is not worth it. Should've just gotten a shot of vodka and call it a day. - Some BJ specialty beer Total of $56 bad food.  Save the money and go to any other restaurant chain."
LC M.,"Burbank, CA",38,79,148,4.0,6/9/2015,Great place to watch the playoffs  AND THE RAIN  ( in the flippin middle of June..).. Now if LeBron would just fall down and go boom I would be happy......half time/half happy. Flippin`  Nit Wits!!!!!!!
R S.,"Los Angeles, CA",427,67,55,2.0,7/10/2015,"Beer is great. Coleslaw is the dryest and worst ever and the restrooms... Don't go in there! TP everywhere on the floors & a stink that will make you lose your meal. Good side, BBQ sauce is good."
Marivic S.,"Simi Valley, CA",14,24,,3.0,1/8/2016,"I'm a Burbank resident and don't usually come here as I like to support smaller independent restaurants. My boyfriend and I went here tonight to try it out. The pizza was good, service  was ok but felt like we were being rushed out the door. Don't know if I want to come back."
Vladimir P.,"Norfolk, VA",0,2,,1.0,9/27/2015,"Last night me and my 3 friends were having dinner.  Manager showed up at the table and stated that they will remove all alcoholic beverages from the table.  The reason wasn't clear. We were ordering double shots of hard liquor.  But we were behaving very well, none of us was drunk, we were very quiet. Basically having good time in a mellow way.  To be fair they retuned our money back from removed alcohol.  Needless to say, we won't be back to this joint."
Courtney L.,"Encino, Los Angeles, CA",36,15,9,1.0,7/28/2016,"I went last night for a friend's birthday dinner. Our waiter was Brett G. We were a party of 10 people. I've never in my life had such horrible service at any restaurant, like I did last night. I was disrespected as a customer and I will never come back here. After being seated, 15mins go by to order drinks. He messed up our drink order, with no apology. After that, another 15-20 mins to get an order for appetizers. Another 20min goes by, we want to order our meals, hes nowhere. Up to this point, he never checked on us to see how we're doing or for refills on drinks. We finally order our meals, my boyfriend ordered a Medium bbq chicken pizza. When food was brought out, a ""mini"" bbq chicken pizza was brought out. No apology, & he went to get a new pizza. Everyone else finished eating before his pizza was brought out. The pizza came out all doughy with barely any toppings. I called his attention for a box, and with attitude he brought one. I also said our service was really bad. We all needed refills and he never asked the entire table. He defended himself and said, ""I did ask everyone, you just weren't paying attention"". He was very rude the entire time we were there. Being extremely busy as a waiter is understandable, but there's absolutely no excuse for his rude behavior to a customer. I did ask another waitress if I can talk to a manager, but no one ever came. This type of experience needs to be addressed to the waiter himself and all staff. If you are short staffed, I get it, but at least let us know before you start our orders so we would be aware. But don't ignore us the whole time. I will never go back to this BJs."
Josue A.,"WINNETKA, CA",0,4,6,4.0,5/30/2015,"Good customer service, good food the lemon thyme chicken was well cooked and the chicken was great in every way also very tender!! But please do not eat the carnitas fries! Greasy and salty!!"
Ryan M.,"Orange County, CA",910,912,3408,2.0,10/13/2013,"It's very rare that I give One-Star rating to a business, but when a very important person in my life wanted to enjoy dinner with her son and service is lacking, then the low rating is deserved. This is for BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse in Burbank. Usually, once a week, I take my mother out to dinner to catch up. I had been frequenting the Burbank area more often and I had already gone Barney's Beanery. So, I wanted to try out BJ's Restaurant & Brewery. Its located just a couple blocks south of Barney's, but right next door to Black Angus. You have two parking options: Valet or Self-Parking. It will be quite tight at the entrance and exit if you have a pickup truck. My mother and I had come in during a Thursday Night Football Game and ALDS Game. We were seated at third booth from the entrance just at the wall of the bar area. The lady who seated us told us that our server would be right with us. After five minutes, I was wondering where our waiter/waitress was. In about 10-15 minutes, three different parties were seated and their drinks ordered. I flagged down the next waitress that would walk down the aisle. I got a waitress and I told her that this was unacceptable for my mother and I to wait. She said that she didn't know where the waitress for the area was, but she was the only one serving the area. So, that did not make any sense. She had served three other tables, but neglected my table. I continued on to be a customer because my mother wanted to enjoy her meal with me. However, I was already upset by the fact that the other tables were served their drinks and food and it seemed like we just walked in right after. Normally, I would just walk out, but I wanted to see if there were any other pros that would make this up. There was just one. My mother just a lemonade ($2.75) and I ordered a BJ's Irish Root Beer ($8.25). The reason why I ordered the BJ's Irish Root Beer was because, she saw a review next to the drink with the name: Ryan M. So I ordered because she spotted it out. Right after ordering our drinks, I told the waitress I am not waiting any more and order right now. I ordered the Best Beginnings Appetizer ($16.95) and Crispy Thin Fries ($3.25).  I still was quite upset and to tell you the truth, the food didn't calm me down. Best Beginnings was very delicious. Best Beginnings had Spinach & Artichoke Dip with chips, Avocado Egg Rolls, Santa Fe Spring Rolls, and Mozzarella Sticks. Each had their own sauce which can compliment any food. Sometimes, I would dip the french fries in the sauce to mix it up. As I mentioned before, I was still upset and the food did not do the job. The waitress was who did take our orders was going on break. I did get her name, but her replacement, Lidia did better job in a few moments than the previous server. So, its not a one star review, but a two star, just for Lidia. I am not sure if she was aware of the situation before she took over. She complimented my watch and asked for my million dollar autograph when I forgot to sign the check. She deserved the tip because she did her job very well. The incident happened a few days ago and I emailed BJ's Corporate Office for a response. Let's see what happens. I was not particularly fond of what happened, but I couldn't show it to my mother. I know it was a memorable moment for my mom, but for me it was a service nightmare. So, I won't be coming back here until I get a response from BJ's Corporate Office and see how they can correct this service flaw. Yelp! The One Stop Place For Your Everyday Research!"
LiLo LiLy K.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,4,,1.0,9/16/2016,This is the worst experience i have ever had 1st my pink cadilac tasted flavored water after had to change to just tequila shot then my santa fe shrimp salad came which is suppose to be grilled shrimp the shrimp is not grilled at all this is the worst day i would never recommend anyone coming to Burbank Bjs worst service ever
Tina D.,"North Hollywood, CA",28,22,3,3.0,4/20/2016,"We've been here before and had nice meals, which is why I am giving three stars.  This last Monday, four of us went.  I ordered the boneless buffalo wings and schiracha roasted Brussels sprouts.  I thought the schiracha roasted Brussels sprouts would be good, but there was only an extremely small amount of the sauce drizzled on.  My wings were, without a doubt, pre-frozen and awful.  My husband's meal was no better.  He ordered the club sandwhich with applewood smoked bacon, and even ordered a side of the bacon.  Was not like any we have ever tasted, very thin and undercooked.  They only put one strip of bacon on the actual sandwich, just placing it in a an x on the bread.  Thank goodness he ordered extra.  His fries appeared pre-frozen to me as well.  Anyway, disappointed for sure."
Jack H.,"Los Angeles, CA",756,493,2422,4.0,11/13/2014,"My wife and I go to BJ's once in a while for our date night.  They USUALLY a have good food and good service.  There is nothing outrageously great or bad about this place.  It's a cool spot to go and kick back for dinner.  I love their outdoor seating and they've recently changed it which makes it more likable.  Service is usually good, except last night.  We went and had a server, Maria, that was not very attentive.  Our waitresses kept changing which was weird cause one would bring out our food and I was ask for something that wasn't initially brought to us by Maria, and she wouldn't say 'I'll get your waitress for you.   What the heck?! Lol. Like they didn't want to do their jobs or something.  Then they brought my wife soup in a bread bowl when my wife didn't want it in a bread bowl.  Anyways, other than last nights service, their service is usually good, friendly, happy servers.  Food is good and has consistency.  It's not like your going to order the same thing and not sure if it's made well or not.  If you like a nice place to go and kick back, BJ's would totally be recommended. P.s. I really like their hamburgers! P.s.s. Their pizza's are pretty bomb. P.s.s. DONT YOU DARE LEAVE WITHOUT EATING A PAZOOKIE (unless there is an emergency) lol"
Natali N.,"Glendale, CA",0,6,,1.0,1/8/2017,we waited an hour for our food i had to tell him to bring me Lemons 50 times until he did at the end the food tasted like shit the stakes were really dry  and the waiters gave a lot of attitude. he took forever to come and get the check literally 30 min. sticky table. never coming back
Brent G.,"Burbank, CA",0,6,3,1.0,10/15/2016,"horrible service.  greasy pizza, LONG LONG LONG waits and unfriendly check in people.  I have been a dozen times and the last few SUCKED.  I will NOT GO BACK!!  DO NOT GO."
Cindy D.,"Burbank, CA",24,26,46,4.0,10/28/2014,"Drinks are good but the margaritas are not strong and are $10.00, for that price i want to have a buzz with just one drink... lol... food is always amazing and great service..."
Arman M.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,21,4,3.0,2/26/2016,"The food was alright. I got a broccoli cheddar bread bowl, it lacked flavor. However, some of the other food looked pretty tasty. The beer selection is a bonus. Will give it another try and get dessert next time."
James H. L.,"Los Angeles, CA",176,149,33,3.0,11/12/2014,"With Elephant Bar closed, BJ's is our local go-to for lunchtime catering when we burn out from burgers and need a wide variety menu. Service has always been excellent wherever seated (and the place is quite big for huge parties, if needed.) Bar area has lots of TV's for sports, if that's your need of the moment.  The food is pretty much middle-middle. Nothing really bad, nothing constantly craveable. I seem to like the entree salads the best of the mix, especially their version of the crispy chicken style. Standard pizookies (chocolate chip, peanut butter, caramel) seem best. Their seasonal ones are kind of hit and miss. The Chicago-style pizza never quite has been close, but it's a puffy crust semi-deep dish style that's edibly filling, as long as you're not expecting Giordano's. Fries come both julienne thin and wedge cuts, and are pretty good when topped with the works (chili, cheese, bacon, etc.) or the new Carnitas Fries with Chile Verde version. Have had fun with a Double Deluxe burger - which is best split into 2 open-faced versions since thats about 2/3 of a pound of meat. Not really a date night kind of place, but more like I want more like a Marie Callendar's without pie. Not Claim Jumper or Cheesecake Factory portions, but bigger than average. Vegetarians/Vegans might find it tough here - stuck with salads holding the cheese and bacon bits, or the some of their soups.  Beers are plentiful and include the microbrews and a fun sampler flight. Full bar, otherwise. Of course, Biersch, BBG, Black Angus, Barney's, Granville,   are up the street, so you could go nuts at happy hours bouncing from bar to bar to bar to bar to bar in downtown Burbank.  But for a sit-down-watch-the-game over huge nachos, or bring the whole family for a one-size-fits-all menu - no problem here. The valet parking has to do with the proximity to the big office buildings next door tending to take extra spaces whenever they can get them (none of the 1st street business buildings seem to actually have enough parking for ALL of their tenants). For evenings, you could always walk from across the street from the BofA parking, or any of the multitude of free parking multi-story lots if you're doing a night on the town in Burbank. Lunch hours, I'd stick to the streets along Angeleno, or the lots."
Christopher T.,"Glendale, CA",0,14,,2.0,12/21/2015,"A reasonably atmosphere to watch a sports game, and a fully-rounded drinks menu. The food is way below average.  Everyone at my table commented on how bland everything tasted.  Dry, unseasoned burgers (both beef and bison), and steaks that were improperly prepared, lacking all flavor & salt.  The sides were all prepared poorly as well, as if they were heated carelessly in a microwave before plating.   Customer service was not very good either, the waiters were not attentive, and the hostesses did not say hello or goodbye, they were too busy chatting with each other."
Abigail L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,49,,2.0,3/6/2016,"I really enjoyed BJ's the first time we went. The gluten free pizza and pazookie were delicious! On our second visit, the service was really bad.  Tonight when we went for a curbside pickup, we waited for 10 minutes after calling them (and after our scheduled pickup time) before I went into the restaurant to track down my order. I'd purchased a pazookie and ice cream because I loved it so much the first time. When I got to the car and opened my order, the pazookie was already cold, and even more disappointing, it wasn't baked. Only the very edges were done, the rest of it was like eating raw cookie dough. Super disappointing."
