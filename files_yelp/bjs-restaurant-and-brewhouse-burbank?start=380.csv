Jim K.,"Burbank, CA",0,30,,1.0,12/30/2016,"BJ's has a chronic problem with service. I have been in this restaurant numerous times and the service has always been slow but last night it was shambolic. We were a party of nine, got seated almost immediately and the place wasn't particularly busy. The service was typically slow but within the realms of being tolerable. However, when our food eventually arrived, the items that come with fries were served without the fries and our server explained the fries were not ready but would be out shortly. So four of us sat there with half our meal, one of the meals was supposed to be fish AND chips (which didn't come with tartar sauce). The fries did eventually get served. One diner ordered a steak, cooked medium and it was served rare so that had to go back to the kitchen. We waited ages and had to ask our server where the steak was before he fetched it and by that time everyone else had finished eating. There were a lot of other fairly minor things that spoiled the experience but I won't list them. We complained to the manager and she was very apologetic and deducted the four items that came with fries from our check. The food was decent, the server was doing his best but he was new and it wasn't entirely his fault. Management need to figure out why the service is so bad because this place has always had really slow service and it deters me from returning."
Jennifer N.,"Glendale, CA",68,31,5,2.0,10/31/2015,"First off, the parking lot is so small you have no choice but to valet for $3.50. They don't accept credit card, only cash and they would like a tip on top of it. We arrived about 8:30pm and it was packed which is typical for any restaurant on a Friday night which is fine. We waited for about 30 minutes and were seated. We got a corner table which was ideal since there was 4 in our party with 2 kids under 5  years old. We were greeted right away by our server and got our drinks rather quickly. It wasn't until we ordered our food, our server had to take a break and we were given a new waitress. That's when our experience went down hill from there. It took 30 minutes for us to get 2 small pizzas, 1 pasta order and a kids mac n cheese. The food was cold. We didn't have any silverware.  We asked the guy who brought us the food for them, didn't see him again. Had to ask another server for them. We saw our waitress 1 time after that and we had to track her down to order 1 pizookie. That took another 30 minutes for us to get. Then we had to wait another 20 minutes from when we finished everything to ask for 3 to go boxes, wait for those and wait again for the check and had to wait more to get change from the bill. It was just not a great experience. The service was bad, the food was awful and the valet was a rip off. No other restaurant does that in Burbank. The parking structure is so small you have no choice but to use valet. No impressed one bit with this place."
Rara S.,"San Diego, CA",18,28,,1.0,11/22/2015,Absolutely the worst service ever. Tons of available seats but it seems as if the servers were overwhelmed. There was five girls checking people and tons of people running around but it took over an hour to get food. We went to celebrate a birthday but left frustrated because the service was awful. Good was cold. Salad drenched in dressing and soggy pizza. Gross. Will never return to this location. Anywhere is better than here.
d p.,"Redondo Beach, CA",135,14,,1.0,10/8/2016,"my first time will be my last time. my friend and I called in a take out order for a burger and a flatbread sandwich. they said it would be ready in 10-15 minutes.. so we get there 15 minutes and my friend waits outside blocking part of the parking lot because he has a trailer attached to his vehicle. I went in to pay and pick up the order but my order wasn't ready yet. the guy who i paid said it would be 10-15 minutes.. I told him we already ordered it on the phone 15 minutes ago and they had said 15 minutes on the phone.. he said he was going to check on it and never returned.. then I asked a girl who came to the take out counter if she could check and she apologized that their take-out was going slow.  I ended up waiting there for 35 minutes.. 50 minutes total from the time I ordered and when I received my order. who takes 50 minutes to serve a burger and a flatbread sandwich?  BJ's does! ..and even after the wait, my burger was worse than a Carl's JR Six Dollar bacon guacamole burger, yet it costs $5 more, and it took 10x longer to get it... tip to the management, train your employees not to lie about how long the food orders take.. had I known I was going to be waiting for 45 minutes, I could have bought 2 beers at the bar while I waited..  the place looks like it could be a good place to bring friends, have some beers and eat.. but the management is clearly unorganized and the staff is poorly trained..  NEVER AGAIN!"
Clarity B.,"San Jose, CA",8,57,78,4.0,3/31/2015,Second time here at BJ Brewhouse. I can't say anything bad about it. It's good. Not great. Good American steak chicken pasta pizza.  It's the cookies or as they call em pizookies that rock. Tonight we had two f their hand crafted sodas. Super tasty.  We had root beer and cream soda.  Portions are big. Menu similar to the Cheesecake Factory. Seated quickly. Friendly waitress. I'd return here.
Khatchig H.,"Glendale, CA",58,9,1,5.0,12/14/2015,"Bj's is one of the best restaurants I've to, their food is the best and their service as well but I don't know for some reason this time that I went it was different. I felt it was 100 times better with the service girl Alyssa she has been the best service provider until now in Bj's probably I'm not going to write about the food, the drinks, and their pizookes because everyone knows how good their menu is."
Armen R.,"Sunland-Tujunga, CA",113,78,75,5.0,1/16/2015,"4 stars for overall food (not counting their amazing 5 star dessert) 5 stars for the liquor (thanks for not watering it down like most places) 5 stars for our 2 awesome waitresses. #1- Maria was so nice, we had a party of like 9 people and she handled herself very well with all our random diverse orders.  #2-(don't know her name) blonde girl with the nose ring, she backed me up when my friends made fun of me for ordering fruit and broccoli for dinner. I love her : ]"
Douglas H.,"Burbank, CA",1,37,1,3.0,9/25/2016,Good food but trying to use the curb side service today I see others parking there and walking across the street to Black Angus. Nice job BJ'S
Robin H.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,9,5,1.0,11/8/2015,Waited over an hour for dinner very upset with BJ is I don't recommend this restaurant at all ever! The manager was also very unhelpful. The food was tasteless! I will never go to a BJ's restaurant especially not the one in Burbank again ever! The only good thing about the evening was that they comped our meal for our large party of 15 people.
G M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,408,722,5.0,1/23/2016,"I have been going to BJ's for many years but thank of them as pizza and beer only. But actually we had some great dishes - salmon and quinoa, salads ribs, etc. A great meal and fun place."
Rick S.,"Redondo Beach, CA",542,1619,11938,3.0,6/10/2013,"BJ's is a reliable chain, the pizza is okay, but the deep dish is not similar to the Chicago styled pizza I've seen replicated at Zachary's in the Bay Area, in that it's more like thick crust than a saucy pie, but if you like a greater ratio of dough/bread than the thinner crust, and like your pizza soft, then you may love the pizza  for those properties. I had the Jambalaya which is $15.95 and is a generous portion with sausage, chicken and shrimp and has mild spices, so not too hot (you can add your own hot sauce if you want to too) and is zesty enough to appreciate the flavors without the heat killing the dish, which is what I like. The french fries are thin ('tho they offer wedge versions too) and have the look and taste that makes me think they're fresh cut (as opposed to frozen), which is always nice. The hamburgers, I believe they cook to order, or at least ask you how you'd like it, which is always nice.  It's a decent size too (and comes with fries). The Poke (Ahi/Tuna) dish was good, and has a generous portion of fish with avocado on crisp crackers. The waiting system is buzzer/pager based and the wait isn't that bad when they're crowded.  The service is good, and the positions of the TV's are good, so you don't get a neck cramp trying to look at a TV screen, since there are pretty much TV's from every angle, which is nice. It's located in the more busy part of Burbank, near the Media Center area, and they do have a parking lot, either pay $3.50 for Valet, or there's free, but limited (however achievable with the right timing, patience and parking karma) FREE parking in the adjacent structure."
Lale p.,"Burbank, CA",12,103,128,1.0,7/14/2014,"Worst experience ever. Hair in my turkey burger they replaced it and I atr half took it home and heated up the other half the next day took a bite and low and behold another hair! What's up in the kitchen?  Aside from my hairy turkey burger it took 45 minutes to get our drinks, another hour for my sad excuse of a turkey burger. Not going back again that's for s"
Patrick D.,"Glendale, CA",0,30,7,1.0,8/15/2016,"Visited this location with 7 other people today.The service was ridiculously bad but the response from the manager in charge in regards to our concern was even worse. First of all it took 40 minutes for our food to come out. Second we had to wait a while for our drink to be refilled. The place was about 2/3 packed so it was not bad and I don't blame the servers since they seemed like they had too much on their plate. When we brought this to the managers attention instead of acknowledging this major issue especially since our receipt had the printed time that we were seated and the time we left,  we were told that they plan staffing based on some internal algorithm. I thought the days of giving excuses for your shortfall were over in customer service but I guess not here. Very disappointed with this."
Shenny S.,"Los Angeles, CA",60,355,189,3.0,6/12/2014,"Was here for Game 4 of the Stanley Cup Finals. Luckily a friend arrived early and was able to grab a table. Overall, a good place to watch a game. Sound was up but not as loud as I'm used to at other sports bars. Waiter service was decent. A couple times the waitress forgot to bring water and napkins when we asked the first time, but second time asking we got it. No biggie since it was a full house because of the game. Parking was tricky. I was lucky to get a spot at the limited self parking lot. There's valet service or you can park elsewhere a block or two away to save money. A Metrolink station is nearby, although I generally don't use Metrolink since trains only arrive only once or twice an hour. Good variety of food and drinks available for Happy Hour including mini deep dish pizza which was decent but not like the deep dish you get at Chicago. I also got the angus sliders. i was expecting something more gourmet than ketchup on the burgers but surprisingly they were good. Guess keeping it simple is the way to go. The berry cider was a bit on the sweet side, but I learned you can mix it with another brew."
Jasmine B.,"Glendale, CA",75,10,,1.0,9/28/2015,"Wouldn't recommend this certain location, I personally love BJ's but the service here sucks. I went in last night for dinner and ordered a Chicken Alfredo (which if you didn't know is a pretty easy dish) so the server brought the Alfredo without the garlic bread and I asked her if I was going to get it which she said they were making a new batch and that it would be out shortly. It seemed as if the food had sat there for a long time because it was cold. I realized that she had forgotten to bring it since we were waiting a long time. We never saw her again, until it was time to bring the check, she didn't even acknowledge anything. Won't being going to this location anymore. They might want to work on training their staff or at least teaching them common sense."
Talin M.,"NORTH HOLLYWOOD, CA",0,6,1,1.0,9/11/2016,"I have been to this BJ's three times and all three times they treated us terribly. The seating hostess acted like some douche snob towards my grandmother, mother and me.  I got the shrimp scampi and they left the breadsticks out. On top of that, our waiter had an attitude, and when I asked for some water with light ice, they acted like it was such a burden for them to get something so simple. Not only that but it took FOREVER for them to get us our food. It took so long we thought they forgot about us and we were thinking about leaving. Terrible BJs, always go to the one in Glendale that one's awesome."
Luis D.,"Los Angeles, CA",333,153,72,3.0,11/19/2013,"You call this ""deep dish""!? Pizza is flavorful but in no way can you call this deep dish. It was very doughy and fluffy. I ordered the cheese and pepperoni and wasn't that special.  I think that you come to BJ's for the bar and the drinks and the big screens and the game and the group and the loudness and all of this is there so you won't notice how standard and regular their food really is. Yet you pay the price for all of the other hoopla.  One thing that always stand out to me is their sinful delicious pizcookie dessert! Wow! Now that marks the spot. It's a chocolate cookie oven baked with a couple of ice cream scoops at the top. Amazing! Too bad for their pizza."
Michelle R.,"Los Angeles, CA",21,5,5,5.0,2/28/2015,"I Loooove BJ's!!! My boyfriend and I decided to come to this location because it was the closest to us at that time. The view of the outside of the restaurant is very nice and valet is only $3.50. We walked in and got seated right away. Our Waitress was extremely nice and attentive, she truly earned her tip. We ordered the sirloin steak which was cooked perfectly to our liking. My favorite thing to Order is the Chicken Tortilla Soup, once it came out I was the happiest woman on earth! Needless to say, we always walk out of BJ's with a Completely satisfied Stomach and huge Smile. One of our Favorite Restaurants/Brewery for sure!"
Amy M.,"Van Nuys, CA",1,13,2,5.0,8/4/2016,My review is more on the service than the food. Short story is I needed a quiter place to breastfeed my 5 month old. I went to the Hostess desk and a young man told me there was an area of the restaurant that wasn't being seated at that time. He directed me to a little nook at the far side of the restaurant and I was able to feed my baby in peace. Thank you for your immediate assistance!
Dave E.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",513,25,1,1.0,7/25/2014,"90 minute lunch, food took way too long guys.  We have jobs!   Food was good but everything about the service was super slow.  I even got the wrong order and didn't have time to rectify it bc by the time we got it we had to scarf it down to get back to work."
