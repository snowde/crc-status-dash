Singris B.,"Burbank, CA",38,37,23,1.0,9/4/2017,"I used to frequent this location, but within the last 2 years my 3 visits were a bit disappointing.  FOOD: the quality of the food is nothing like it used to be, I used to order the Parmesan chicken or fettuccini Alfredo, they were made to perfection, and ALWAYS hit the spot. Well not anymore! Not sure why the Parmesan chicken has dry tomatoes sprinkled over it now, still a bit pink and bland! The mashed potatoes used to be covered in a delicious sauce, not anymore.  It seems like they cut back on a lot, especially the warm delicious complimentary bread and butter they used to serve. We were super hungry so we ordered bread to eat while we waited. cost (5.99), but our food got there first! So it was pointless and we canceled it. The grilled chicken pasta, is not what it used to be. It taste like pieces of chicken that were frozen, warmed up and tossed over pasta. Not the fresh off the Grill tasting chicken Over a creamy Alfredo pasta I remember! I won't get started with the pizza =(  WAIT TIME: took way too long to get our food considering it wasn't busy. We were seated right away, and there were plenty of empty tables. How ever, it took about 40 min to get served! And when you have a 2 year old with you, it seems like an eternity!  The waiter seemed like he could use a break, it Took way TOO long to get our drinks/refills. Not sure if I'll go again, but if I ever do, I'll update my review if anything changes."
Chris D.,"Bakersfield, CA",166,244,342,3.0,9/12/2017,Well the reason I gave it three stars instead of five we had to wait 35 minutes to get a table but looking around the restaurant there was at least 17 tables empty we did have a server that was training another server which I didn't mind the service was a little slow getting refills was alone most hard to do unles I flag somebody down the food was good and their parking is a little small but they do have valet parking for four dollars if you want to pay that
Kae M.,"Burbank, CA",1,25,5,1.0,9/10/2017,"Another chain restaurant that is going downhill quick ! Pretty soon it's gonna be trying every gimmick in the book to get customers back !  I decided to give them a try tonight after a 3 year break and I was quickly reminded why I stopped coming here . Service --- Slow , no refills , took 15 mins just to take our drink order , waited over 25 minutes to get the check !  Food --- buffalo wings that most likely came from a freezer bag .. Pizza had the smallest amount of cheese , I couldn't even taste it or see it !  I don't know why I decided to give them a chance again tonight , but never again ! Lesson learned"
Nancy N.,"San Fernando Valley, CA",69,134,148,1.0,3/20/2017,"Went here with the bf since he got a craving for a Pizookie. It was a Sunday night and the wait time was only 15 min which was great! So far so good.  Once we got to our table, that was a whole different story. We were practically ignored and had to flag down anyone to place our orders, to ask for a refill, to ask for our ck and to ask for a bottle of ketchup that ACTUALLY had ketchup in it. We actually ordered more than what we originally said we would order. We opted for burgers and fries, chips and salsa, sadly no beer since it was given up for lent.  ""our waiter"" was tending a bigger party next to us and we kept seeing him come back and forth tending them the whole time. We literately sat there and stared at him to see if at any time he felt us looking at him.  No more Pizookie cravings I said. Next time we'll make that sucker at home, unless we go to a different BJ's.  Management: If a waiter has a large party or a few large parties and then they have a few parties of 2, send someone else to help him or her. The smaller parties will definitely be ignored."
Edgar O.,"Los Angeles, CA",204,44,9,1.0,11/18/2017,Let me start by saying I have never waited 50 mins to an hr when ordering food ‍ then I get my soup which was klam chowder I ask for Tabasco and crackers never got my crackers and my Tabasco took forever to come then me and my wife order steaks she gets hers well done mines medium well and let me tell you they both came rare ‍ then we have no napkins no utensils like really how are we going to eat just plain horrible experience I had to ask for utensils and napkins then later on I ask for water omg another 30 mins just plain horrible experience never will I go to this BJs and I will tell all friends and family to definitely avoid coming here by any means necessary.
Claudia D.,"Los Angeles, CA",22,14,58,1.0,8/10/2017,"BJ's  has always been one of my favorite restaurants but the experience at the Burbank location disappointed me. I'm sorry to say that the Parmesan crusted chicken was not prepared in the same way that it is prepared at other locations. Lemon cream was cold, poorly blended and inedible. The rest of the meal was ok.  I don't like to complain about service but The valet parking is unnecessary and the staff seems overwhelmed. The greeters were talking and appeared bothered that I had interrupted them. The person that served my table was just ok. No smile, seemed upset to do the job and never asked how my meal was. The bartender appeared upset as he was loudly throwing ice and glasses around Bad energy overall."
Candace B.,"PANORAMA CITY, CA",195,279,2578,4.0,2/19/2017,"OMG!! The best clam chowder sourdough bowl I've ever had. Now, it took forever to come out because the bowl is freshly baked but trust me it's worth the wait. All the food was delicious tonight! The clam chowder was full of big juicy clams and so creamy. The chicken picatta was lightly breaded, perfectly seasoned and had tender juicy chicken on the inside. The fish and chips were crispy and flaky and not salty. I didn't take a pic but he calamari is always good and the hamburger sliders. My only complaint root bear flavored boneless chicken had a weird taste. Would not order that again. We ate so much we had no room for dessert but if we did, it would be the pazooki. It was packed and originally told it was a 40 minute wait but only waited 13 minutes. Our server was nice. Good night all in all."
Suekay D.,"Santa Clarita, CA",38,40,37,2.0,11/18/2017,"Service was horrible to say the least. Food was decent, basic would be a good word use. Our order was wrong so that was a bummer since it took over 25 minutes to get out food. Highlight was the pazookie that was good."
Frank M.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,4,,1.0,11/6/2017,"I have a hard time giving a bad review. But I was so excited to have dinner here and even more excited about the pizookie. Today is the following day and my stomach is still in pain. All of our entrees were awful, tasted like rubber and cold and stale. Lemon chicken tasted like rubber. Pasta and meatballs were disgusting. And at the end I was excited about the pizookie. It came out cold. And hard as a rock. The service was fine, but the food was awful."
Bill S.,"Torrance, CA",7,33,,4.0,12/11/2017,"A good place to have a bite, a drink and watch the game.. the waitresses are always friendly.  The decor is not the best but okay compared to other BJs.."
Adis Z.,"Burbank, CA",2,20,11,5.0,9/15/2017,I love to eat in BJ's. I visit BJ's at least once every week or every two weeks. We went to this restaurant on 9/14/17 and were helped by Nick the waiter and honestly We got the best service ever. He is a cool guy. Very professional. Friendly and super nice. Food was good like always. Restaurant clean and full at 5:00 pm.  Thank you Nick for your service. I hope you get raise
Amy S.,"Los Angeles, CA",76,146,22,4.0,11/19/2017,"Good service, good pizza, and of course, their Pizookie's! This location in particular is great because while people in the lobby were waiting for tables to open up, they served a couple pizzas to us! Free of charge :) A great way to make you feel welcome. I'll be coming back to this location for sure (and not just for the free lobby pizza)! I've got to try the holiday Snickerdoodle Pizookie!"
Caroline S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,1.0,12/2/2017,"Been here twice. The first time I wasn't impressed but tried to give it another shot this time around- turned out to be an even worse experience.  Ordered a pizza, a piadina, and pastas.... Food came out lukewarm at best, it took almost an HOUR for our entrees to come out.... lost our appetites, decided to pack it up and instead of coming back with enough boxes, the server had to do it in 3 trips, even with bags. I empathize with servers especially during busy hours, but the whole experience was just disappointing.  Food was horrible though and soon as I got home, had to yack. If you're planning on a corporate restaurant- go elsewhere. Too large of a menu with less than mediocre food."
Brian A.,"Encinitas, San Diego, CA",0,13,,2.0,9/9/2017,"Slow service on a slow night with plenty of staff! Red flag should have been the fact the place was empty on a Saturday night. We had to ask them to put the SC/Stanford game on TV. Now mind you, I'm a UCLA fan rooting for whomever is playing against SC, but how clueless is the management/bar staff? Your restaurant is in Glendale which has a huge SC fan base! Oh, and by the way, kind of doesn't look too professional for one of your employees to take her break in the bar area eating In n Out while another one sits next to her, talking on his phone with his bag of Cheetos in front of him!"
sue b.,"San Jose, CA",0,19,,2.0,11/24/2017,Wrong choice for dinner tonight.  Service was seriously lacking and the prime rib was the worst I've ever had. So many choices in the area and we definitely made the wrong one.
Cris I.,"Burbank, CA",637,453,6482,4.0,6/24/2016,"Buy One Get One Free Entree for Premier Rewards Members I had been here several times already in the past but came back here for the promo. Who would say no to a BOGO free offer? Not me so I'm in for another visit and tag along a coworker to share the promo.  We were promptly greeted and led to our table. Although there were several tables in the front, we were assigned a table to at the farthermost section where the bar is so we requested a table nearer the main dining area. They obliged without any objection. We ordered a salmon quinoa bowl ($12.50) and a chicken pesto pizza ($15.50). The salmon was crispy on the outside but juicy in the inside. The quinoa and the vegetables were also perfectly cooked. The same goes with the pizza which came with chicken, tomatoes and artichoke. We really enjoyed both the meal so we finished them all. The restaurant is huge and has many tables divided in different sections to give privacy to diners. Customer service is always great every time I come here. The only reason I took off one star is the issue with valet parking. I would fully understand if there's limited parking but on the contrary, there is a huge inside parking lot. As a matter of fact, cars are just parked near the entrance. I believe that parking should be free to customers as an incentive for patronizing the business."
Brandy J.,"North Hollywood, CA",0,4,2,1.0,7/6/2017,"This was absolutely the WORST experience I have ever had at this location.  Three meals two came out but I had to wait 20 minutes before my meal was brought out.  One of the sandwiches was raw and my ribs were so dry.  I have not even started on how poor the service was.  What is worse, the table behind us were seated 10 minutes after we ordered and they finally got what they ordered as we were leaving.  #bjsbrewhouse"
Liz O.,"Glendale, CA",199,17,13,2.0,1/4/2017,"I used to love coming here for parties, games and beer.  Uuummmm never again. Came to have a family dinner. Party if 3. The wait for a table was not too long. 15 min on a Wednesday night. Got to our table. Took 22 min to be waited.  Finally our waiter came...I asked for the Santa Fe Spring Roll...he said they don't have that on their menu anymore.  #Fail So we just ended up ordering our food. 48 min later we get our food. Sister and I got pasta....it was cold.  Sister felt like she was eating chicken Alfredo's pasta cold soup (See Photo).  My Penne Pasta plate was cold too. I was not a happy camper. Waiter wasn't all that great. Checked up once in the 2 hours we were there. I say 2 hours because the first 48 min we waited for our food. Guess they actually killed the chicken and made it from scratch. This menu change is garbage and I definitely will not be back here again."
Darrio C.,"Sylmar, CA",89,23,26,3.0,11/12/2017,Great location great food excellent on Sundays it's crowded so the service is not the best but the pizza is worth going back for
Denise R.,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",2,11,,1.0,10/29/2017,"Since the manager reached out, I emailed back to resolve the issue. 3 months later, and nothing. Just so you know, I'm waiting..."
