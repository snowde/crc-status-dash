Marianna K.,"San Mateo, CA",251,379,1832,4.0,3/18/2013,"I usually don't wast my time reviewing chains - what's the use? they are all the same, they will not change and... it's a chain! :)   I have been to a few BJ's, but the Burbank one is my fav by far.  They have a lot of booth seating and tables for large groups.  Can't comment on service - depends on who you get - had both great and not-so-good experience.   Bar has a lot of seating without the wait, and you find yourself surrounded with TVs playing all different sports.  Open late too!  Oh, and, in case you have not been to a BJ's restaurant before - pizooooookie is a MUUUUUUUST!"
Nancy E.,"Northbrook, IL",1,19,10,5.0,10/10/2015,Came for dinner and Tyler was a wonderful server delivering very good food! Such an attentive server he anticipated all of my families needs. I will come back for him if nothing else!
Robbie B.,"Burbank, CA",1214,351,346,4.0,5/6/2014,Have a whale of a good time at Burbank's BJs.  Don't let all the valet signs fool you -- free parking in the adjoining parking lot on the second level!
Art H.,"Los Angeles, CA",128,25,2,4.0,12/7/2014,"Ambiance: I really like the ambiance inside of BJs. It's got nice decor, and is very casual and friendly, although I think I like the one in Glendale more. Appetizers: The avocado rolls are to die for! Also try the calamari if you're feeling it. Entrees: You really can't go wrong with the food. Pastas, Seafood, Burgers, Salads, etc. You're almost sure to find something you like. My friend and I both got burgers and sandwiches, and they came out really good. I was offered the option of thin-cut or wedge fries, I chose thin cut, but they came out with wedges instead. They messed up there, but it was not a big deal cuz I'm not too picky about my food (unless I really don't feel it that day or hate it) Parking: This BJs is ridiculously busy, and the parking can suck. There's a small 2 story lot next to restaurant where you can park for free (if you can find a spot!), or you can pay valet ($3.50?) to park for you in certain designated spots. Service: Our waitress was really warm and friendly, and attended to us well. No complaints. Overall: 4/5 stars."
Yess R.,"Los Angeles, CA",116,4,,5.0,2/21/2016,I love coming here! It's also my daughters favorite place to eat! Chicken Bacon Ranch pizza is delicious!!!
Natalie A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,1/31/2016,Bad customer service!!! We had been waiting for over 45mins to be seated when a another family (same num of ppl) walks in and only waits 5mins to be seated. Walked out to never come back. There's plenty of other restaurants in the area to choose from.
Erick R.,"Los Angeles, CA",104,419,101,4.0,1/14/2013,"I was out with my girlfriend late Friday night trying to get something to eat in downtown Burbank, when she suggested BJ's as we were in the mood for some actual food and not any Fast Food junk.  I wasn't sure what I was in the mood for, just that my stomach was saying ""Dude, feed me!  We have not eaten all day, Bro!"" On our drive down I was all like ""Mmm...I smell greasy Cheese Burger. I want me some greasy Cheese Burger. Nom Nom Nom"".  This was my first thought as I drove past the In&Out Burger on the way but like I said before neither of us wanted Fast food as we've been having lots of it lately and we wanted to go some place where we could just sit down and enjoy a meal...but at least that smell did help me pick what I wanted.  I didn't like the Parking lot much, as it's really small, and the garage next door was very full.  Then again, it was Friday night. Our meal started off with some of the Calamari and dipping sauce.  Then to our main dishes which where the Bacon Cheese burger for me, and a patty melt for her.  Both with the potato wedges and some dipping sauce.   To drink I had the Cream Soda which was really tasty, and my girlfriend had a few cocktails.   The food was good, the service was fast, and the Atmosphere was quiet considering there were a few groups of people inside throughout the restaurant.  Our waiter was pretty helpful and stopped by to check on us a few times, and offer some suggestions on appetizers, drinks, and desserts. I think on my next visit though, I'll order a Pizza."
Emily B.,"Westwood, Los Angeles, CA",35,32,5,3.0,8/12/2014,"Server was scatterbrained!!! Not the best service I've ever had. They have their 2 for $22 deal again, which is why we went in. Always have a goo meal here, yet last night was a little different. Crust was undercooked, and it took a while for the pizza. Manager said he would wt us desert, but desert comes with the deal. Oh well, neither the server or manager seemed to have their stuff together. When the bill came server had charged full price for everything even though we specifically ordered the deal by name. When brought to his attention, gave us some song and dance about how it rings up at every other BJs but at this location the manager has to do it. (Which is all 100% irrelevant to me) had to the wait for manager to take care of it.  All in all the worst experience I've had had a BJs which is weird because it is usually just the opposite. Still love their food but will surely not get that server again.  Avocado egg rolls were delish as usual. Pizza was undercooked even though it took forever. Pizookie was outstanding! ;-)"
Martin D.,"Sylmar, CA",37,5,6,5.0,11/13/2014,Love this place!!! Brews are awesome...food is delicious and the service is great. Awesome portions for lunch at a great price.
Mayra S.,"Sylmar, CA",1,4,2,3.0,1/10/2016,The place was really nice great service friendly and constantly checking to see if we needed anything but was a very long wait for the food and once we got to desert would have rather gone home then waited that long for the desert.
Tatiana C.,"North Hollywood, CA",56,33,5,4.0,10/31/2014,"I came here not too long ago with a  Couple friends for happy hour. Love the happy hour. I must of had four strawberry mojitos it was amazing,  felt great! Had me turnt up!  I had a few appetizers as well.  Nothing was disappointing,  nice scenery."
Julian G.,"Fontana, CA",2,2,2,4.0,8/7/2015,"This was my first time at this location so I was super excited especially knowing It was in Burbank & just coming from Six Flags Magic Mountain celebrating my Girlfriends  Birthday We decided to stop on the way home and End the night at BJ'S. We were Gretted and seated with respect. At first our first server which was an older lady was kind of rude but I didn't judge she probably had a ruff day and was ready to go home, but our server Torry took over and did an amazing  job at tending us. He was on top of his game and I appreciated his hospitality. He even showed us love and took in consideration that it was my Girlfriends Birthday and came out with a pazooki thanks Torry!!! Will definitely come back if I am in the area"
William G.,"North Hills, CA",40,46,78,4.0,12/22/2014,Love the corn friters with bacon aioli. burger was nice and in house blond ale was refreshing. Thank you for the great customer service!
Mrs. H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,41,4,3.0,7/10/2015,"Spoke to GM Matt, he is aware of the service issue and was brought in to address it. After two attempts to reach the manager, Ashley for the gift certificates to make up for the bad birthday dinner ..Matt finally sent me gift cards to apologize. I hope they improve on service it's half the reason families go out. I mean, i can cook pasta and pizza myself!"
Colette Y.,"Burbank, CA",33,68,27,4.0,10/16/2014,I'm not a fan of the food at bjs but their employees were so kind to my boyfriend and me last night that they deserved this rating.  Bjs closes at 12 but at 11:40 my boyfriend and I decided we wanted a pazooki. I had a feeling they wouldn't serve us but right when I asked if they're open they said yes have a seat.  I'm sure they didn't want to stay longer to serve us a pazooki but they did and they were super nice about it!  My boyfriend also loved the pumpkin pazooki so try it out :)
Felda A.,"Glendale, CA",4,5,,1.0,7/17/2016,"I like the place, but waiters are a little awkward and unfriendly. They just don't care. My waiter got our food order wrong, he never came back to ask if we needed anything else. Our table wasn't even setup with napkins, forks etc.. I had to ask for some napkins and forks.  I just feel like we weren't welcome there"
Narineh A.,"Glendale, CA",0,7,,1.0,7/16/2015,"Came to eat here with friends and the service was horrible. First of all we ordered appetizers and a salad and had no utensils, asked for it 3 times and at the end the hostess brought it. We ended up eating calamari with our hands and the salad as well. When our food came finally we started looking around to get refills on our drinks. At the end we decide to order desert I must say we have never waited this long at bj's for pazooki's. We were about to just pay for it and leave.  Never coming back to this location. Took us 2 1/2 hours to finish this process."
Eric S.,"San Fernando, CA",1,15,,3.0,6/29/2016,"The last time I went, customer service wasn't so good and I pretty much paid for some fries I didn't even get, but I understand that it was one of their busier nights, considering around graduation times this place gets full at night. Aside from that day, this BJs restaurant always has good customer service, food is good, although I can't find one item in their menu that stands out in particular, everything is pretty good."
Mari Q.,"Burbank, CA",87,82,12,2.0,8/16/2015,The hosts aren't very good. They quoted us like 20 minutes too long. The server was rude because our table didn't know what they wanted. I don't think he even mentioned his name. And the food was not good. It's way over priced and I feel as though I can make these dishes better myself....
Everly S.,"Burbank, CA",0,4,,5.0,1/29/2016,"Went to BJS last night for our daughters birthday. Patrick, our waiter was fantastic . He was very attentive, never needed to ask anything he was already on the way with drinks. Brought the little ones their food first. All and all everything from service to food was great. He interacted with the little ones and we all had a great time.We do come from time to time but tonight was great.  Definitely a night to remember. Thanks Patrick!"
