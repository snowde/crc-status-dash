Amber ..,"Saugus, CA",0,34,9,5.0,6/25/2016,"I just wanted to update my review because after seeing my last review Nick reached out to me and was willing to fix the issue. Thanks Nick I appreciate it, and I'm sure my next visit will make up for the last one."
M G.,"Burbank, CA",5,119,1,4.0,9/28/2015,Me and my bf decided to have a late night dinner. We were sat at booth within ten minutes. Our server was polite. She could have been a little more attentive. My bf liked his meal and I liked my cherry glazed salmon. Yummm .We then asked for stuffed mushrooms to go. The server returns to say they ran out of mushrooms. Ok this is a huge chain restaurant that obviously needs to keep better track of inventory.I expect better from such a place. I think I'll be back to this location but I took one star off for not having the one appetizer I wanted.
Corey B.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,37,66,4.0,10/25/2014,Car pool for this excellent restaurant. Great for groups or families or a date. The valet parking helps for a fee. It may be a bit crowded on the weekends for dinner.
Glaizll G.,"Los Angeles, CA",269,61,117,2.0,6/2/2015,"usual B&Js chain...This review is in regards to their parking.  Parking: Self-parking at night is EXTREMELY bad IF you drive a crappy/old car. To self park, you would need to go up a VERY SHORT & VERY STEEP hill/incline just to get to the TOP parking.  The incline is VERY SHORT & VERY STEEP that: + When I drove my SUV up, I was not able to see the top, to see if there is a car backing up or in the way. + When an older car, tried to go up, it was stuck close to the top and eventually SLID DOWN the incline. (Imagine if you were behind this car. Your car would have been hit... Dangerous, right?) There is valet but why pay when you can park it yourself?"
Ruth W.,"SYLMAR, CA",9,66,440,5.0,10/18/2015,I absolutely love eating at BJ's!!!! I love the Asian chicken salad. Its the best! The pizzas are good too! They have the best appetizers. Yum! Great place to dine! Highly recommended place to eat !!!!
Rcktmann L.,"Southampton, PA",1,36,,1.0,4/4/2014,Stuffed mushroom are one of the best I have had in a long time. The calamari was one of the worst! Way over cooked (brown in color not golden) and had left over onion from a different order mixed in. The place wasn't over whelmed so no excuse!
Matt M.,"Chandler, AZ",10,19,13,1.0,2/27/2016,"Giving BJ's a 1 star for my most recent visit. I placed an order over the phone last night around 755-8pm for curbside pick up. I asked the girl after I finished my order how long it will take, she responded about 15-20 minutes. I go and get there around 820 and call in to say I'm here for pick up. One of the waiters comes and takes my card and says we are running a bit behind, it will be like 5-7 min longer. I go ok another 5-7 min isn't that bad. He comes back 10 min later with my card and says the kitchen is backed up and it will be another 5-7 min. At this point I am contemplating to just cancel this order because it's 840 at this point and it's taking too long. I decide to wait anyway and until 852 I call in to cancel and they said oh it's on it's way out sorry for the wait. They brought the order and for the wait they gave an extra order of fries. Nice but it literally took 1 hour from order inception to pick up. I might as well dined inside had I known it would be that long. Isn't the purpose for curbside pick up to be less of a wait time? I know there are glitches here and there and kitchens run a bit slower, but I believe 50 minutes is too long for curbside. Believe it or not California pizza kitchen takes 15-20 minutes when you place the order. 1st time with curbside pick up with BJ's and it is the last time."
Jose A.,"Studio City, CA",28,153,371,1.0,5/27/2015,"Gave this place a second chance , came on a Friday night, yes prime hour but I believe if a restaurant staff can't handle prime hours they should t be open. Service was sub par. We ordered two they both came to the table as though they had been sitting out for 10minutes not hot at ALL !! Barely warm"
Danielle G.,"Canyon Country, Canyon Country, CA",3,23,8,2.0,11/7/2015,I would no longer recommend BJ's for happy hour. Their happy hour is awful now. $1 off is all you get. They used to have a really good happy hour. I won't be coming back here.
Maddy S.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,2,,4.0,7/14/2016,"Great experience. Working at a restaurant is hard, and our server, Alec, did a wonderful job. He refilled our glasses, brought me some ranch for my fries when I requested, and made us feel welcome at BJ's. The wait time was only 2 minutes even though they were tremendously busy, props to the table turn around ratio for that one. Only reason I took off a star was because of the ticket time... The kitchen was taking awhile. 30 minutes for 3 dishes? Seems crazy. I know it's hard to plan for the right number of cooks, but it seemed as if we were waiting for awhile. The manager even came by to another one of Alec's table to apologize about their food taking so long (even longer than ours). How can they expect table turn around ratios at a faster rate of the food is taking too long to get out? Anyways, thank you for a great night, BJ's and Alec. If we are in Burbank, we shall visit again."
Jay D.,"Granada Hills, CA",40,2,,1.0,2/9/2014,"From start to finish my experience at this BJs was probably one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had.    As I walked in to the restaurant with my family I knew I should have walked out, but I figured I'd give it a chance.  Starting with the hostess, no smile, no welcome was offered, we weren't even asked how many in our party.  The hostess had the ""I don't want to be here"" look.  Two other hostesses, one may have been the manager, standing there gossiping with her employees.  We were sat down right away which was a plus; however, we had to wait about ten minutes before our waiter took our drink order, by that time we were ready to order our food.  If they are going to make you wait that long at least offer a snack.   So we placed our orders and as I expected the food took some time to arrive.  If you've been to this place you know it's a good size restaurant. The main bar was some what busy, the party room/bar was empty, the dining room we sat in did not look completely full so I'm not sure what could explain the slow and poor service.  Our food wait time was about thirty to forty minutes.  Our waiter came by once to tell us or food was on the window and they were waiting for runners... Really, WTF, you tell me the waiter can't bring us our food.  To top it off, the runner tried to deliver our food to the wrong table, we tried to tell him it was ours but he had to go back and check.   Let's talk about the food, maybe it was the long wait that left a bad taste in my mouth but the food wasn't worth the price.  I ordered a Deep dish buffalo chicken pizza. The dough was good but the pizza looked like it went through spin cycle. Limited toppings, dried up sauce, cold from sitting on the window probably fifteen minutes.  The wife ordered a salmon dish. Of course it was cold and the flavor bland... You could smell the curry but couldn't taste it.  My son had the chicken scampe.  This one was OK taste wise a bit cold.  Service throughout was nonexistent. Asked waiter for Tabasco and a refill... Took a good seven minutes to get the refill and I never got the sauce. Not sure about this place maybe they had an off day but I doubt it.  You can't hide poor service.  Probably why half the place was empty during lunch hours.   If you decide to visit this establishment I hope your experience is much better than mine..."
Greg O.,"Mountain View, CA",0,6,,4.0,12/2/2014,"I get that this is a chain restaurant and there is nothing super individual about it, but when you are looking for a known quantity there is something to be said for a straight forward place where the food is the same no matter which one you go to.  That was my experience here and it was a good one.  I sat at the bar to watch MNF and was very happy with the bartenders.  Nika poured a great drink and gave me some good recommendations on the happy hour menu.  I had wings, a flatbread, and sliders (all small portions on the happy hour menu) and it was just the right amount for the duration of the game (I spaced them out).  The flatbread and sliders were what I expected and were good, but the wings were perfect.  For the true buffalo wing aficionado, they had just the right amount of sauce and were still crispy.  It was pretty busy for a Monday night with the football game on, but the bartenders kept an attentive eye on my glass and were happy to refill it at the earliest opportunity."
Samuel G.,"Athens, TN",77,12,1,5.0,11/28/2015,"Our waitress and hostess were both very friendly and courteous.  Our waitress, Maria, searched far and wide for a hair tie for my date because she didn't want hair in her face when she attacked her bacon cheeseburger....which smelled great by the way. I only had the house Hefeweizen and it was delicious! I tasted her fries and the seasoning was excellent. Great atmosphere, but too many tv's going, but I guess some people like that."
Erin C.,"Carson, CA",0,1,,2.0,1/6/2017,"great restaurant clean place, nice ambiance however both me and my friend found hair in our food we were so disappointed cause we were so hungry.. Even though our meals were comped it doesn't excuse the fact that this was unacceptable what in the world are those cooks doing back there"
Jacqueline E.,"Burbank, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/5/2016,"Believe me...I love a Poozokie as much as the next person, but as I am currently sitting waiting for my food for 45 min. btw I will probably not be returning to the Burbank location. The waiter is doing her best, but has already lost two tables in the time we have been waiting. I don't believe this is due to anything else, but a lack of good management and not enough staff. Additionally, upper management was not helpful in making the situation better. I do not care how good the food and dessert is, BJs needs to be prepared for a Sunday night rush."
Aaliyah T.,"Burbank, CA",12,12,1,1.0,5/20/2015,Honestly just the worse service I've ever received. I showed up on a Wednesday the place wasn't busy and waited an hour for for our food. It took a half hour for my appetizer to come and to add icing to the cake no one came by and refills on the ice teas. I used to love this place I don't understand what's happened.
Artin Y.,"Burbank, CA",3,30,1,2.0,10/16/2015,"Horrible service, we waited for 30 minutes for drink..no BS. The pizza was under cooked, their service and food quality has dropped big time the past few years. Maybe its only this location. I complained about the pizza dough being under cooked on their website and received no replies for 3 months now."
Stephanie B.,"Burbank, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/25/2015,"Honestly the service was terrible ! The waiter passed us five times without asking us anything when we were done with our meal, the waiter then introduces us to a new waitress. She then threw the box on the table and the check. I've been here several times and I have never had such horrible customer service."
Nancy A.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,32,2,2.0,9/7/2015,3 people told me that this place was awesome well not for me and my friends the food is just like any other restaurant the only thing that was very pleasant was the chocolate chip Pazokiee we ate it was yummy.  And customer service was good also
Hailey Z.,"Glendale, CA",301,626,508,1.0,3/5/2012,"This place is LOUD! Doesn't matter what time you come here. There is never enough parking and the wait always exceeds an hour. My last visit may be my last. I understand that it was really busy, Friday night, etc. It took my waiter 25 minutes to make his presence at our table. The pictures on the menu of the food are very deceiving (my mozarella and tomato salad was half of what I thought it would be) and the portions are super small, yet the food is so expensive. What I did have here though, was very good.  We sat by the bar, which was a huge mistake. This place is where drunk men that are going through midlife crisis' go to to be loud and annoying. I almost put an axe to the chair he was sitting in so he could fall and hopefully hit his head. Not to mention, the stuff he was talking about LOUDLY was quite inappropriate. Had I had kids with me I would have taken it upon myself to tell him to shut the hell up or leave. I really do think that the staff at this place should have taken it upon themselves to ask him to shut up or to leave. None of them said a single word to him. Don't think I'll be visiting this place ever again."
