Edd-Arlo G.,"Los Angeles, CA",130,32,18,4.0,9/1/2015,"All my favorite food is served here, I always have a difficult time choosing between the pizza or the chicken crusted Parmesan and ending it with a pazookie, the environment is nice here, the only thing is the parking but other then that good eats"
Mary C.,"North Hollywood, CA",76,39,17,4.0,7/14/2015,"I went to BJ's for a work lunch and ordered a lunch special (Salad & Pizza). Apparently my topping wasn't available but instead of the kitchen telling me, they decided to just give me a cheese pizza.  I was a little peeved, my co-worker said something to the server.  Our server was Brennan S. and he completely took care of the lack of consideration from the kitchen and apologized even though it was not his fault.  The food was good, but the server was excellent and he's deserves 5 stars.  Thanks Brennan S!"
Kaori T.,"Burbank, CA",1494,793,1274,5.0,2/22/2012,Dang you OREO PAZOOKIE!! *Shakes Fist*
Ashot Y.,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",0,7,,1.0,5/30/2016,Did not get one of my plates that I ordered because they forgot about it. The fries was cold and super oily. The chicken on the starter plate was disgusting and the chips were cover in oil. The avocado on the avocado rolls turned black the minute they brought it out. Basically the food was horrible!
K S.,"Los Angeles, CA",71,118,12,3.0,7/11/2014,Pretty decent BJs. The wait was not terribly long and the food is just the normal BJ's food. Make sure to get a pizookie for dessert. Yum
Joy L.,"Burbank, CA",0,10,1,2.0,3/16/2016,"Location #10. Food usually 5. very good...Lemon thyme chicken was fab.  ...once u finally get it.  BUT SERVICE is appauling. Never offer refill deinks.   Had to flag down every time we wanted something.  Finally called the front desk & asked them 2 send him over. We got soup & salad....easy.  right? WRONG.  We has to ask WHERE our food was after 15 min.  And then it was only the salad. another 12 MIN BEFORE the soup cAME out (which, did I mention WE HAD 2 ASK 4.) we have been have been here 5+ °times... and it IS ALWAYS THE SAME.  NOT AGAIN.  ? One and a half hours for lunch after we got there.  cookies take 15 min after ordered."
Chandlar D.,"Moorpark, CA",0,4,,5.0,11/10/2015,"I went to BJs for the first time ever and I personally had a really great experience. I ordered the shrimp tacos which were some of the best shrimp tacos I've ever had & for dessert, I tried the pazooki! Soooo good. It was a Sunday night & it was a bit busy, you can tell that BJs is a favorite place to eat for many people. My server, Alex T was a big part of my wonderful experience at BJs. She was very friendly and outgoing. She often checked to see how we were doing or if we needed anything. She seemed to know the menu really well which is something I appreciated since it was my first time eating there. Overall I had a really great time and I will be back again!"
Phil B.,"Glendale, CA",66,182,28,2.0,1/19/2014,"Had the sweet pig pizza was soggy and under cook also the seared tuna salad lacked flavor the fish was ice cold and tasted fishy, I say Woodland hills or Cerritos this place lacks quality,  Our server was great though."
Mane S.,"Lake Balboa, CA",29,475,58,3.0,5/21/2014,We arrived with a party of 8 tonight and the host was very disrespectful she seemed like she didn't want to do her job. Then her manager finally got involved and gave us a table. The food as always was great and our waitress was a sweetheart
Gaya K.,"Glendale, CA",3,6,1,1.0,9/27/2015,"Used to be good, but now service sucks and kind of depressed stuff!  Won't visit this restaurant anymore..."
Ellis J.,"Los Angeles, CA",243,251,28,4.0,5/30/2014,"The parking situation could be alot better....there self parking lot isn't the biggest...so if there aren't any spaces then your forced to do valet...thats whatever... Other than that, this spot is pretty dope. TV's everywhere, big enough inside to where you don't feel too close to others, and service was great as well. I got the brewhouse burger with thin fries and my cousin got the bison burger....both were very good, flavorful, and filling. We also got BJ's PM Porter beer which was a very smooth beer and went well with the meal.  I'll def be back for more food, and def the beer. Forgot to take a pic and next time i have to def try the dessert I hear about!"
Geoff B.,"NORTH HOLLYWOOD, CA",45,257,82,3.0,1/1/2013,"I've been coming here for several years, with several different groups of friends on different occasions.  I would probably say that three (3) stars is probably the best I'd give it.  The service isn't bad but isn't good/great at the same time.  Whether or not it's busy the workers there are just that; workers... The food is usually good, I can't argue there, but the drinks, mainly the mixed ones are pretty sub par.  I would stick to the beers if I felt like having a drink. Regardless, it's a place I'm not deterred from going to, and I will return if invited for a gathering/party."
Andy L.,"Pacoima, CA",283,220,6,2.0,2/17/2014,"Used to come here a lot for the food back in high school and everything was great, would have gave them 4 stars back then. Went back recently for lunch and sever dinners, all pretty lackluster experinces.  Food: Same as with any other BJs really. Usually go with a burger or the pulled pork sandwich, if it's a large party we usually grab a couple pizzas and share. Burgers are juicy and delicious, the sandwich is also great, might be my favorite thing there. Pizzas to be honest isn't that good, crust is a little thick and there is very little topping. Toppings arent spread out evenly so someone can have like no crust and lots of topping when someone else ends up with all crust. The beers are tasting, big fan of the Piranha Red. And of course the pizookie, thing is delicious. Keep in mind the party platter is tempting to get but it is rather huge, takes about a good 6-8 people to finish.  Service: Here's where the downfall of this particular BJs. Service used to be good and consistent no matter the time or rush. Now the service is poor even when its not crowded. Food takes a while to come out and not everything is brought out at once, some orders are messed up and drinks take awhile to be refilled. And before all that the seating process is a little unorganized. They tell us 15 mins but then after those 15 mins they tell us another 10 and it continues for a few more times.  Location: Pretty good location right off the 5 freeway. Also kind of away from the more congested area of Burbank. Once you enter you are met by the valet drivers, you can leave your car to them for a couple bucks or you can drive pass them and find self parking on the second floor of the structure. Be careful of the ramp leading up to the second floor, its a little tight and steep. Also there is not a lot of spaces up top since it's shared with the building next door."
Vilson S.,"Glendale, CA",815,30,188,5.0,4/15/2014,"There's nothing like coming to BJ's to get some yummy salads and take in the sports bar atmosphere. I ordered the Santa Fe Salad. I thought the portions of her chicken were appropriate and really loved the thick avocado slices. It was very tasty. Any salad with black beans and I'm there. The lettuce was finely chopped. It reminded me of how California Pizza Kitchen chops their salads. You get plenty of lettuce in addition to the toppings. Our server was attentive and did a great job as the amount of people increased inside the restaurant. If this B.J.'s was near me, I would come here again. Although, I would make mental note of the small amount of self-parking in the area. There is a parking garage for the restaurant, but it also shares spaces with a nearby business. If you get here during the dinner rush, I would probably recommend the valet parking available."
Sarah T.,"Burbank, CA",60,38,51,2.0,6/1/2014,"We wait a entire 45 minutes to recieve our food.  For apitizer I had the spinach and artichoke dip with tortilla chips, tasted amazing BUT the Hawaiian Mahi Mahi was disgusting. The fish was salty and the rice with so sweet. The part of the fish that had soaked up the sauce from the rice tasted like sugar cubes. I couldn't even pretend to like my dish!  The atmosphere is nice and the restaurant is a great place for game night."
Taylor G.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,2,,1.0,12/18/2015,"WORST customer service...made a reservation for 8 people, with 2 high chairs. They tried to fit us in a table that MAYBE could have fit 4 adults. The hostess was beyond rude, the manager had a bad attitude and was rude stating that we didn't have a reservation only a ""call ahead"". Last I checked ""calling ahead"" to ""make a reservation"" is the same thing. We will never be attempting the restaurant again. We headed up the street to Gordon Beirsch, they seated us immediately, amazing customer service and even apologized for BJs being so rude. They offered us a complimentary desert to make up for our horrible service at BJs. Honestly don't waste your time at BJs, walk up the street to Gordon Beirsch, you won't be disappointed."
Alex B.,"Glendale, CA",219,95,126,1.0,8/6/2014,"I took my girlfriend here at the end of an awesome birthday night I planned for her. All we wanted was a pazookie. So we got seated by the hostess and 10 minutes later the hostess saw that we hadn't been helped so she brought us a menu. Finally, the waiter came and brought us water. He ended up taking our order 10 minutes later so in total it took 30 minutes to order a pazookie on a Wednesday night What was even worse though is that I went to the waiter and I asked him to put a candle on the pazookie for my girlfriend and they even forgot that! I was very disappointed and I usually don't complain but I complained to the manager and he ended up giving me half off of my bill but it definitely did not make up the fact that they forgot the candle! That was the whole point of even going there"
Diana L.,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",239,80,7,2.0,5/17/2014,"Found a hair in my pazookie today. My server kept disappearing. Had to ask a different server for help. I love BJ, but they really let me down today. It wasnt even busy, Ive been here enough times to know that whens its busy, everything takes a lil longer, but tonight. Wow what a disappointment"
Caroline I.,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",6,11,,3.0,5/20/2015,"The manager of the BJ's got in contact with me, apologized for the bad experience, and offered to pay for our next meal there. I'm glad he took the time to make up for the bad experience."
Albert G.,"Glendale, CA",3,125,603,3.0,5/16/2015,"This place is busy and loud. If you have the time and don't mind the loud noise, come on down.  The food is mediocre at best. They've got a big menu in order to accommodate just about everyone but their non-specialty items are nothing to write home about. I tried their grilled pork chops and it didn't deserve more than 3 stars. Meat was tough and had no flavor."
