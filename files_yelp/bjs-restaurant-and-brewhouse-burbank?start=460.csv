Lady M.,"Glendale, CA",0,5,,5.0,9/23/2014,"I had my family birthday dinner here. The waitresses were very nice, my dad didn't like his first drink and so they took care of it very easily and friendly. They even kept my cake in their refrigerator, then brought it on table after our dinner. They also give a free puzzici with candle when they know it's someone's birthday. Strawberry martini was strong a bit, buy still really good. In non-alcoholic drinks, they have real fresh strawberry lemonade to die for!  Overall I had so much fun on my birthday evening with my family. They also had kept my cake box so that we could take it home. Xx"
Joseph A.,"Los Angeles, CA",25,48,16,2.0,11/1/2013,"Boy has this place lost its touch. I used to go to BJs for a long time but haven't for a couple of years. I went into this place last night with a group and was expecting the same great service and food but boy was I wrong.  The waiter that was taking our order was an excellent waiter with lots of potential but due to the lack of support he wasn't able to do his job well. We ordered our food and drinks and it took over 1 hour and a half to get our food because the kitchen was ""backed up"" but the place was not busy at all.  When the food came out it seemed like they downgraded in their quality of how they used to make their food. They use minimal of everything from toppings on pizzas to the ranch they give you. Overall I didn't enjoy my experience here and will probably never go back into a BJs again. Cheesecake factory has really stepped it up and is doing a lot better than BJs is right now."
Tania R.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,11,16,2.0,9/19/2015,Food is very good but service is pretty terrible. Waiter/waitress seem flustered & not happy to serve. Waiting for periods of 20min in between.
Roy A.,"Anaheim, CA",0,1,,1.0,9/19/2015,"Worst BJ's I have been too, the food is great but the service sucks. My table was left with out service for 20mins at a a time. The employees seem unhappy and botherd anytime I would ask for a condiment or more water."
Sarina V.,"Los Angeles, CA",801,553,1304,3.0,12/11/2013,"We came with about 10+ people. Service was pretty good, guy came around but didn't want to really joke around with our big group when we made them. He was a little awkward. Food came out all on time. I had the salmon here for the first time, I was a little hesitant but it was actually good. I was trying to eat healthy unlike the rest of my family who all got pizza's haha. They like their food. My cousin had a steak and fries. The fries were good, I stole a couple. We usually always come to this location when I'm hanging out with cousins and we decide to go out and eat after."
Jennie C.,"Burbank, CA",39,39,4,3.0,1/25/2015,Bad service today. The waitress and staff were friendly but the chef messed up on my pizza so by the time they made my pizza again my family was done eating.  Maybe it was just super busy but this is not the best service from all the times I've been here.
M G.,"Burbank, CA",0,2,,3.0,9/13/2014,Its simple....dont have seats outside if your staff wont come outside to call you in to be seated. Also found hair in my salad from a couple of months before. The manager replaced the salad for free. Thats great customer service. But still. Other than that the food is always good. I would come back and recommend.
Allena C.,"NORTH HOLLYWOOD, CA",7,6,1,1.0,6/10/2015,"I came here with my family for pizza and pasta. The pizza was great, but the fettuccine was completely horrible! It tasted like it was frozen pasta that was microwaved. Disgusting! I was not expecting that"
Jessica G.,"Las Vegas, NV",200,125,174,2.0,3/1/2014,"This place doesn't steer you wrong on food, but service here is just awful!  I get it if you're busy and trust me I'm not one to complain.  But if you can't remember something write it down!  Seriously you can't be that smug to not write something down when you don't remember.  It's just bad form, and not appreciated, for a staff that large how does service become so terrible?  Food is good, but good luck waiting for it."
Erika P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,4.0,9/9/2015,"Went for a my mother's celebratory dinner, we had a family of 8 people. The service was okay, a couple of our orders were wrong. A few days later as I was looking at my bank statement and noticed I was overcharged, I called to find out what happened I spoke to a gentlemen who asked me some questions and assured me he would call me back in a couple hours. I never received a call that day so I called back and spoke to a man named Matt, he checked and also said he would call back. Matt actually called me back and noticed that I was overcharged, he gave me two options on how to get my refund. He was very pleasant and attentive, he definitely turned the experience around, he took a problem and made an opportunity. Thanks!"
Eric I.,"Westlake Village, CA",4,132,105,1.0,3/22/2014,"Just ate here and had a terrible experience.  The server was great, but the food was terrible.  The large deep dish BBQ chicken was cold, dry and undercooked.  We also ordered the pazookie figuring you cannot mess that up.  Wrong... Served over cooked, too thin and wasn't even round.  It was as if someone threw the dough into the pan and didn't care to form it.  Never going back."
Johnny M.,"North Hollywood, CA",0,7,,5.0,4/21/2016,Claudia at the bar is the only reason I come to visit and eat. She is the most friendly person in all of downtown Burbank. No other bartender compares to her awesomeness! The food is not bad either. CLAUDIA FOREVER!
Becky W.,"San Jose, CA",96,103,563,5.0,3/24/2014,Best bj's I've gone to by far! The service was great and the good sf this location was fresh and delicious!  The artichoke dip and artichoke pizza was great. The fish and chips were fabulous as well. Will definitely be returning to this location in the future.  I also tried the new salted caramel pazookie and it was AMAZING !!!
Anthony N.,"Los Angeles, CA",831,593,2353,4.0,6/4/2013,Have you guys been watching THE CLIENT LIST?  With J-Love in it? Don't pretend like you haven't... This can be our dirty secret...just like hers...only mine has melty ice cream involved...although if u watched the show it might not be too long before ours become one and the same. I love BJs..who doesn't?  Haterade drinkers that's who.  I love their white chocolate macademian nut pizzokie.  And I enjoy their hefeinweizen..everything else can wait. I think my fave pizza is the BBQ chicken one.  I could huggle that thing all night.  Turn on some lifetime with undoubtably j-love in it :) Other than the bad service...which in my head is synonymous with BJs...I still like it.
Carol Z.,"Burbank, CA",0,11,,2.0,1/24/2016,"Service is poor, especially the ""hostesses"". Not worth the wait."
Brooke A.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,8,,5.0,8/23/2015,I love the food here its so good ! Service is great I recommend the Mac and cheese and the Parmesan chicken
Sabrina M.,"North Hills, Los Angeles, CA",91,356,226,4.0,3/5/2014,"Good service, good food, the parking sucks.  At least 75% of the time you'll be forced to use their valet, and they charge for valet.  How about just opening up your valet area to your patrons and losing the valet service?"
Susan C.,"Bell Gardens, CA",0,1,,1.0,5/2/2016,"I am so done with bjs!!! I just left bjs in Burbank, ca found two hairs in less then 2 minutes in our food. All I got from manager was an I am sorry we are all human. I was the bigger person and asked to cancel the rest of my order and chose to pay for drinks and appetizers. But I can't believe that's all I got. When he saw how upset I was he said you can have the food it's going to the trash but honestly I chose not to take it but they just left it on table. Can't believe that is all I was offered. Sad to see the horrible customer service."
Rick R.,"Glendale, CA",0,6,2,1.0,1/25/2015,Worst service I have ever had at a restaurant. 0 stars for service. food was just ok and the wait time is outrageous. Waiters/waitresses dont refill drinks. Dont go here.
Sam V.,"Los Angeles, CA",21,20,4,3.0,4/18/2015,"Went to BJ's this past Thursday around 6:30pm with a group of 8. They have valet parking outside for $3.50, but had I know I could have parked myself then I would have.  They sat us at a nice spacious booth in the corner next to the bar. This was my first time at a BJ's so I bought stuff on the menu that had ""BJ's"" in the name cause you figure it must be good if they put their name on it. I had the BJ Mojito for $4 which was delicious, then the BJ's Oasis Amber which was aight, and for dinner I had the BJ's Favorite Pizza for $16 which was just meh. I enjoy a hearty pizza and what I had tasted airy. My buddy told me BJ's is know for their pizza, but I didn't see what was so special."
