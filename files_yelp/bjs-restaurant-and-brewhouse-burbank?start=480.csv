Stacy P.,"Sylmar, CA",7,20,11,1.0,11/7/2014,Hostess are so rude ! I understand that it's so packed (I've worked in the restaurant industry before & know what it's like as a host) but not even a smile or greet from them . . I had to leave ! Customer service is key to a restaurant & this place is defiantly lacking in that area ! Thanks Chelsie for that horrible experience .
Christine D.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,3,1,1.0,7/2/2015,"Our server was A-MAZING with PERSONALITY!  The food SERIOUSLY LACKED in presentation and flavor.  Ordered calamari VERY GREASY, potato skins were okay, at BEST.  Ordered the watermelon feta salad that looked less than appetizing but tasted good.  Grand~spring ordered California Chicken Club...AWFUL!  HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED!   MY son AND his teenage son, independent of one another said they'd NEVER dawn another BJ's. DO NO, I REPEAT, DO NOT WASTE AN APPETITE AT BJ'S BURBANK!"
Arly D.,"San Fernando, CA",1,13,6,3.0,6/30/2014,"Parking lot could be better, other then that this place is pretty good. The food is great big portions so there's  left overs the service kinda sucks the beer and drinks are good but seating can be a bit cramped needs to expand more the bar is awesome for games though so over all it's ok."
Agnes K.,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",17,19,11,2.0,4/8/2015,"The Cajun pasta I got was way overcooked, the noodles were so soft & made it taste like it was a day old & was microwaved. Not getting that again that's for sure. The ahi poke app is really good though."
John E.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,5.0,4/21/2016,"See Claudia at the bar. She's great, will take good care of you. Good food, good beer, good place for lunch"
Lou E.,"Burbank, CA",144,268,74,3.0,4/19/2013,Good people working here. I was given great service. Although the pizza left me thinking why they even call it deep dish when 85% of it is just pizza dough. It's better you go for the hand tossed.  The best place for work lunches. It has everything one could want for lunch. The sports games never have the sound on. FYI. No subtitles either but who goes to bars to read anyway?   Pizookies are what you want to order. Avocado egg rolls for appetizers are heavy. Just jam packed with calories. The pretzel has just enough salt for it not to be too offensive.  BJ's has a foundation for children's learning and health care and are west coast natives. Nice.
Candace L.,"Los Angeles, CA",2883,1503,3011,4.0,3/4/2012,"3.5 STARS BJ's is a great chain restaurant - pop in for a pizza (they now have whole wheat crust, which is wonderful) I love the deep dish with big chunks of tomatoes. Have a beer and order a pazookie and you are good to go! They have a HUGE menu! I'm sure other things taste fine but I go here and keep it simple. This is a very casual place to pop in for a quick bite to eat, good for families and kids. Recently discovered this is one place JBHS Show Choirs go to get their grub on after shows - way to support the local Burbank businesses. Part of me imagined the entire place breaking out in song and dance with all of them there but it's more like them just being teenagers. I like to take my son and his friends here before or after catching a movie at an AMC in Burbank. Parking is a little annoying - not sure what the deal is, sometimes its valet, sometimes its free valet or sometimes there is self parking up top in the back."
Sandra W.,"Burbank, CA",269,211,230,2.0,2/15/2014,"Stopped in for lunch here with some coworkers before the thanksgiving break.  It's been awhile since I've had food here so I was cool to give it a shot.  First off, forced valet.  Grr.  I hate that. I know it's necessary at times but it's a layer of annoyance that will deter me from coming here.   Secondly, food was just ok.  I had the Cobb salad (ok, but missing key elements of a Cobb salad, it was more of a hybrid salad) and clam chowder.  I took a spoonful of chowder and looked at my spoon- chocolate was embedded on the soup spoon.  Gross.  Those pizookies are pretty popular I take it, but not mixed in with clam chowder.  Took awhile to flag someone down to replace it.  My coworkers food all looked fairly ok though.  Burger, BBQ platter, chicken pasta dish.  Maybe I should have gotten one of those dishes.  One of my coworkers is all about their beer, and at the end of our meal found out he could buy a bottle.  Our server charged him separately, no problem. However the server then disappeared for about 25 min while we all wondered if he would come back with this bottle of beer.  He finally appeared with the bottle of beer, so we could finally leave, with little explanation of why it took so long.   There's so many options in downtown Burbank for this kind of food, so I'm bummed that this place couldn't wow me."
Maria C.,"Anaheim, CA",3,4,6,3.0,5/10/2015,"Looking forward to celebrating Mother's Day, my family and I ended up here...  First, they only have valet parking, but I thought to myself it was sort of nice for a day of celebration.  We were seated right away. Our waiter was nice and took our order promptly. I decided to order their BLT salad but with no cheese. I was very clear about the no cheese part and was repeated several times by me and others.  Food comes and I get a salad with cheese...lol. OK I'm a little confused but I understand these things happen so I just alerted the waiters and asked for a new salad. Well, that was a mistake because it came when everyone else had finished eating and me enjoying watching them eat. By this time my niece had also been waiting for syrup for her cold pancakes. I alerted a waiter about this and after she gave me the ""wait a minute"" she came back and said she would tell the supervisor about this issue. Well, I did not have to pay for my salad, which was nice. However, we often had to get up to get the waiter's attention whenever we needed something (not the initial waiter who was actually nice)."
Andy H.,"Burbank, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/27/2016,"Haven't been to bjs in a long time went there, worst time ever food was cold server was rude and they are very slow I won't come back again!"
Barry W.,"NORTH HOLLYWOOD, CA",6,10,,5.0,10/13/2016,they have the best unlimited soup and salad lunch. their new rib special has me coming back every thursday
Hailey J.,"Burbank, CA",13,9,,5.0,7/13/2015,Their pizookies are bomb The reason why I go eat here is pizookies  So amazing.  All kinds of their pizookies are delicious
Stephen O.,"Sunland, CA",13,18,9,1.0,1/4/2014,"If I rated this two years ago, I might've gave it around 4 stars. However, lately as many reviewers have experienced, this place has gone downhill.  Food and service is pathetic. 4 out of the last 6 times I've been there, at least 1 of the people at my table has not gotten something they ordered. I usually like the BBQ beef sandwich but 2 out of 4 times they come out with the BBQ pulled pork and tell me their computer is messed up. I'm allergic to pork so good thing I know the difference in how they look before I take a bite.  That dish also comes with wedge cut fries, which some days you'll get about 8 fries total. It's really pathetic looking even on the small dish it comes along with the sandwich on.  My last trip (ever) was last week when my friend didn't get his beer for 35 minutes, and then when my table got all our food they said his was on it's way.... After 20 minutes and the whole table was feeling bad about eating in front of him without his food, we still were basically finished with all our meals when they brought out his burger and fries out.  He took one bite of the wedge cut fry and spit it out like something was wrong. He said something wasn't right and we all smelled them and compared them to someone else's and they smelled like burnt hair or burnt plastic. We actually took 2 home in a ziplock bag  like CSI in case he got sick. The next morning they smelled fine. Overall this place gets tons of business and is always crowded for big events and yada yada, but their food is awful, and their service is non-existent just like the marinara sauce they were suppose to put on top of my brother's spaghetti."
Lupita L.,"Los Angeles, CA",191,140,1130,4.0,2/10/2012,"I don't usually like pan pizza but their's is great.  My favorite is the buffalo pizza, chicken with buffalo sauce. Love their homemade root beer, it has accents of vanilla and licorice if you like root beer it's a must try. I also like that they have mini appetizers. Another reason to try BJ's is the Pzookie! Warm fresh out of the oven large cookie served with ice cream!! YUM YUM! They also serve their own beers if you enjoy beer drinking."
Shant D.,"Burbank, CA",2,15,,5.0,6/6/2015,Seating is comfortable. Food is awesome. Service is awesome as well. I don't know why anyone would hate this place.
Alexis K.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,20,4,3.0,5/4/2015,"I used to live in the midwest and sometimes get a craving to eat at a chain restaurant, so we came here tonight.  Even by chain restaurant standards, BJ's is only okay. It's loud, but the service was fine. The drinks were good and reasonably priced enough. But the food was generic, and fairly bland. I had shrimp scampi pasta, which was much heavier and less tasty than I'm used to getting elsewhere. My boyfriend got a pizza though, and he was really happy with it. I agree with other reviewers that it's a bit overpriced for the quality.  We got dessert, though, and it was the bees knees. A+ in that department.  They were also careful about my food allergies, which I always appreciate.  So, the experience wasn't bad by any means, but it wasn't amazing, either. Which is kind of what one expects from a chain restaurant, right?"
A. P.,"Elk Grove, CA",1,12,3,4.0,7/11/2015,This is a very busy location and parking has to valet because parking is limited.  When entering the restaurant I saw many seats open and requested to dine outside. I was  surprised that seating took very long when there many seats available outside.  The waitress was very friendly and did an outstanding job. The only issue was that it took a little longer to get our meal and desert but I  am assuming it was because they were busy. They forgot my daughters meal and try to cover it up but  not a big deal. My kids enjoyed the poozkies as usual and my family enjoyed themselves.
Destiny C.,"Glendale, CA",60,253,51,3.0,8/30/2013,"I visited this location yesterday with my daughter and the bf. Three things stood out to us; the hostess, our server and our food.  Our visit started off and ended poorly with the hostess. She seemed distracted and made us feel unimportant... like, she had better things to do than greet us. There was no one else standing in the waiting area so I'm not sure what she could have possibly been distracted by. Then again, when we left the restaurant she didn't bother acknowledging our presence. She brushed past us... as if she still had something better to do. She wasn't with a guest either time that we encountered her so there really is no excuse for her rudeness and lack of... hosting. Someone yelled across the restaurant to thank us as we were leaving so we weren't the only ones who noticed her complete lack of friendliness.   Unfortunately, our pizza was pretty terrible. I am a big fan of BJs pizza and was very disappointed by what we were served. We ordered an appetizer platter, which was absolutely delicious. The pizza, however, did not live up to the same standard. My 2 year old daughter is a huge fan of pizza (as most toddlers are) and she didn't even eat it. The pizza was grossly lacking in sauce and cheese. It tasted as if we were just eating bread. I can get a large pizza for $5 at a pizza chain. When you walk away from a pizza restaurant having spent $50 on 1 pizza and an appetizer, you expect good pizza. I think this is the first time pizza leftovers have survived breakfast in my home.  The good news is that I was very impressed with our server. His name was David and he was possibly the best server I have ever encountered. I was a server for 7 years, it would be fair to say that I have high standards and David exceeded every one of my expectations. He was incredibly friendly and attentive from the moment he approached us. I cannot say enough about how impressed we were with the level of service he provided. You can thank him for 3 stars instead of 1 or 2!"
Julie K.,"Burbank, CA",2,6,,1.0,10/25/2014,This BJs is the worst BJs the waiter dropped a cup on our table which broke and cut my sisters finger the blood was gushing out and for 10 minutes we were standing there nobody came to assist us then finally the manager came with a clueless face not knowing what to do. This is the most ridiculous situations I have ever been in. And they actually gave us a check where we had to pay they had only tooken care of my sisters food when it should have been all of ours
Michelle A.,"North Hollywood, CA",1,7,3,1.0,5/25/2015,"We wanted to go here for lunch, working in a hospitable background you learn to appreciate customer service, I have been to other locations where you were seated right away, offered drinks etc. Not only were we seated to be forgotten about but a whole 25 mins went by and no one, I understand being very busy, short staffed, what have you. But a few feet away and seeing waiters talk amongst themselves and two picking up one table is unacceptable. So we walked out. If I could give it negative stars I would. If you really do want to try out bjs go to another location."
