Robin S.,"Los Angeles, CA",82,16,9,5.0,4/22/2014,Bjs is really good ! I love the atmosphere there. Definitely go for the pizookies they are to die for! I usually get the chocolate chunk one. The salted caramel is also pretty good. But they have great service Soo worth the money
Mike M.,"Sunland, CA",242,380,231,3.0,7/22/2013,"I'm not a huge fan of the pizza, but the beef dip sandwich is pretty good.  Served on garlic bread and along with shoestring fries, it's surprisingly lower in calories than most of the burgers!  Throw in a cold cider and you have a great lunch - if you have the time (service is VERY slow here.)"
Derrick Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",52,8,1,5.0,5/20/2014,"This place is known for their pizza, but don't let that stop you from ordering from the rest of the menu. Their burgers are awesome and come with perfectly cooked shoe string fries. Last time we were here my girl got the fried chicken with gravy which was amazing but due to a pepper allergy we had to order the fish and chips. Our server Genaro took great care of us and swapped out the order with no issue whatsoever.  The beer here is a definite must try. They have a sampler where you pick any four beers on their menu and get 5oz. taster glasses of them... Only $7!!!! Great way to figure out your second round.  We're back for the second time this week and had to ask for Genaro again and he remembered us and my girls allergy after serving us only once. If you want a great experience and everything to run smoothly... Ask for Genaro."
Erika M.,"Los Angeles, CA",419,502,127,3.0,7/29/2013,"Our group of 7 came in on a Friday night, celebrating my brother & future sis-in-law. We were seated right away, which was nice.  Our server was amazing. Super nice, super attentive, super patient and super accommodating. Super! My qualm with this particular night? The fiancee and I shared their BBQ platter for two. The BBQ platter was sub par. It tasted like the meat had been reheated. We didn't even finish our plate, we were so unsatisfied. Add on to the fact that our platter was the last plate to make it to the table. Waaaay after our group was finishing up their meals. Turns out that our first dish was overcooked, so they had to prepare another one. Yet, we were never notified of the incident until we complained. Our server had left us in the care of another server because he was going on break. This new server blew. When we complained to him, he said he'd bring it up to the manager. The manager came over, apologized and offered a pazookie for our troubles. That's it?! So we complained again. Another manager came and comped us our two appetizers. Now we're talking. Customer service means that you keep your customer happy. If they have to wait until their dinner party finishes eating to get their meal, then you now have a problem. Your next move is to fix it. Simple as that.  Thanks to our server and the second manager that came to our table for salvaging what was supposed to be a celebratory night."
Caresse V.,"San Diego, CA",72,38,65,5.0,1/20/2015,"The PARKING:  When you pull in, you have the option to valet for $3.50 or to take your chance at self parking on the top floor of a 2 story parking complex that is right across from the restaurant driveway.  The most time I usually spend looking for a spot is a minute, max.   The WAIT: Our average wait time is 5 minutes give or take.  Sometimes we are seated right away.  Bottom line is I have never had to wait past 20 minutes (For 2 of us). The PLACE: The restaurant has a great layout.  It's perfect for dates, big groups and game nights. The FOOD:  I have ordered so many items from the menu but I'll mention a few that I love and a couple that are...meh. Appetizers - My favorite appetizer is the Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms.  They're mouth watering good.  The mushrooms are juicy and the spinach filling is full of savory cheesy goodness.  The lemon pesto sauce is a beautiful compliment to the mushrooms.  I have to plead with myself not to lick the plate clean, lest I lose my date's interest. lol...  My second favorite is the Ahi Poke.  The tuna is fresh and the poke sauce is to die for!  Lastly, the hot wings.  The hot wings are great.  They are crispy with a nice light salty batter with sauce on the side.  The celery is fresh and the ranch is a good quality.  The wings are great to share and pair well with pretty much all of their beer choices. Entrees - My favorite entree has to be the Hawaiian Mahi Mahi.  The glazed mahi mahi is oven roasted and served over stir-fried vegetables and roasted pineapple fried rice mixed with a spicy soy ginger sauce then topped with slivered snow peas, red bell peppers and sesame seeds.  The fish is always cooked perfectly.  The rice mixture is sweet and savory and light.  During my last visit I decided to try the Prime Rib (Just under $20).  I asked for it to be served medium rare.  I ordered it with seasonal veggies and cheese mashed potatoes.  When it came out, it was well done, the potatoes were fine but the veggies were under cooked and were 90% sliced carrots, green beans and Asian peas.  Normally, I don't care and I will eat whatever they give me.  But at $20, I really wanted something I would enjoy so after showing the waitress the steak (she saw the issue right away and offered to get it fixed) I asked her if they could give me rice pilaf instead of the veggies.  They were so kind and apologetic about it.  After the waitress left with my plate, the manager stopped by and apologized as well.  He was really awesome.  When it came out, the waitress asked me to check it while she was there, so I cut into it and it was PERFECT.  I mean, the steak could be in an educational book to show exactly what medium rare should look like.  It tasted, awesome!  The taste was something that merits being a $40 steak.  It had really good seasoning and was so juicy.  The rice pilaf was scrumptious as well.  It was cooked perfectly and had a really yummy chicken broth taste.  The potatoes (while a bit pasty for my liking) were very tasty as well.   Dessert - The Pazookies are a must when you come to BJ's. The cookie is fresh out of the oven and the ice cream is so creamy!  I am always too full to get one after a meal, so I will go JUST FOR ONE .  If you haven't tried it, you must! In conclusion, there are many awesome dish choices at BJ's, but I love this location for it's fantastic customer service and for their awesome chef.  Thank you and Bon Apetit!"
Bruce L.,"Burbank, CA",0,20,41,4.0,2/23/2016,"A nice place, The food is good nothing to get overly excited about but it's tasty and it's not too unreasonable. This location has valet service so you don't have to wait for parking space but self parking is also available"
Eunice L.,"La Crescenta, CA",205,32,8,3.0,3/7/2015,"It didn't seem too busy when we came in, but everything was just average. Our waitress was nice, but she was barely around and forgot our drink and ketchup.  Another guy brought us our food and it was just decent. We ordered bacon cheeseburger and chicken wings. The Malibu teriyaki glaze on the wings was delicious,  but both entrees came out barely warm... like it was sitting out for a while. The fries with the burger tasted like they were just reheated in the microwave. The pazookie at the end was delicious... actually hot. Normally the BJ's chain is great, but this time around was.. mehh..."
Max H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,29,,2.0,7/25/2014,"Overpriced average food, ridiculously slow service.  Our order was not taken until we had been there for 25 minutes. Then food was delivered another 40 minutes after that. Price for lunch special seems to be a crap shoot and not what's actually in the menu. Had to ask for my Salad three times before actually getting it. On the plus side, they did offer one of the guys in our party a free dessert for his Birthday which was nice of them. That said,  too little too late. Will not be returning. If you have an hour and a half to burn during your lunch hour and want to over pay for average food, this place is perfect."
Christina A.,"Burbank, CA",101,19,14,4.0,1/26/2015,"I really enjoy coming here for lunch and dinner. The main thing I order is the sante fe salad because I'm a salad lover. The beer is great and it's a hype environment. The only thing that I would change is their portions. Compared to the glendale locations  It's too small not too fulfilling, glendale has bigger portions.. Other than that everything is good. The pazookies are a must im sure everyone knows about those haha."
Julie M.,"Burbank, CA",4,78,453,2.0,2/15/2015,"I'm giving only 2 stars, and that is being generous. We tried the sliders, chicken wings and mini BJ's Favorite pizza. We rarely saw our server. We she did come by, I told her the pizza was bone dry. No sauce and just a token of cheese. I had to ask for a dish of marinara to cover it in just so I could eat it. No offer to redo it or get me something else. Service was really slow throughout the meal no refills on drinks either. The sliders and wings were good, thus the 2 stars."
Martha F.,"Decatur, IL",1,32,,4.0,3/13/2016,Above average food for a reasonable price. Service was good too.
Rob L.,"San Diego, CA",39,102,17,3.0,11/27/2013,"Cold cheap beer = good. Cold cheap food = not so much. We came for the late night happy hour which was from 10pm-close. Seated ourselves at a hi-top in the bar area. Our server was fast and attentive. Very nice. The drinks were cheap, $4 for a pint, $5 for a house martini. My fiancé ordered the boneless wings, I had the mini deep dish pizza.  Her wings looked like chicken mcnuggets dipped in wing sauce. (How they tasted also). And I've definitely had better frozen pizza. It was mushy and cold to top it off.  I would say come for the drinks. Just make sure you're not too hungry beforehand."
Molly N.,"Sylmar, Los Angeles, CA",2,25,5,1.0,2/25/2015,"Ordered 2 pizookis and an order of mac n cheese.  ON THE PHONE  .. went in about 25 minutes later...I get there and the take out girl had her boyfriend holding her around the waist whispering in her ear... Ew?  I'm trying to eat I go up to ask for my order waiting for her to finish her conversation with ""Romeo. "" My order isn't ready -__- I sit down for another 20 minutes...at this point I'm annoyed.. I go back and ask if it's almost done..she said your mac and cheese has been done were waiting on the pizookies. . I sit another 15 min. ..mind you the lobby is EMPTY I say just give me the mac n cheese . I have to go, she says hold on walks to the kitchen to call her manager  (he needed to delete it off )  At this point Romeo left..Juliet is acting like such a GREAT employee now, the manager says nothing.. No ""what happened "" no  ""hi how are you"" nothing . I told him ""hi I been waiting almost an hour for a pizooki I ordered over the phone. .while your employees are making they're own soap operas. Smh... He still had nothing to say! ! No sorry, NOTHING  At this point i lost my appetite and left the Mac  got my money back  I now go to the BJ's in glendale."
Amanda H.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,9,,4.0,11/11/2014,Great place except they no longer serve the stuffed potato for dinner!!=(
Marvyn R.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,2,,1.0,2/23/2014,"Number 1. They didn't have a server at our table for 15mins. 2 servers asked us later throughout the night if we had one. FAIL! Next ... After two drinks they denied us of drinks on my best friends birthdays. We kindly asked the manager to come out but no success.  In conclusions, don't come here on birthdays"
Dulce D.,"NORTHRIDGE, CA",198,96,72,5.0,12/3/2012,"Came Here last night for dinner right after the La Auto Show... It was worth the drive. hahha  Came in perfect timing because we got seated right away. This was like around 6:30pm.  The food is delicous ...  I order chicken parmesan... Very good and filling....  I had no room for the delicious :(  dessert , but next time for sure hahah :D"
Winston S.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",93,447,89,3.0,8/30/2011,"I've been going to BJ's on and off for 10 years now, and always loved their pizza and dessert.  The food was good as usual, but our server wasn't too friendly nor attentive.  They don't sing for birthdays apparently either.   The reason for the 3 stars is the food, but the service made me remove 2 stars."
Stephanie P.,"Hollywood, CA",207,218,116,1.0,12/26/2014,"I use to love coming here, but now i dislike it. The service is horrible. The food is not made with love anymore. I decided to try the new carne asda fries. STAY AWAY from them, they are definitely BLAND. BJ's has too many items on there menu and usually when they add on instead of removing items from the menu, then the restaurant starts going downhill. BJ's you definitely need to make changes."
Sevag R.,"Downey, CA",0,2,,5.0,2/10/2016,The food was great but the service was even better! Heime is the waiter to have!! He did everything we asked for with no questions asked and no attitude!
Joseph M.,"Palmdale, CA",0,3,,1.0,2/24/2016,"Went to this BJ's to take my brother out for his birthday.  Both our wives were there with us. Service by our waiter was good. Ordered calamari appetizer and was barely enough for two people and when our dinner came out everything was cold. Kitchen made the food and the servers forgot to bring it out until the Pizza was cold and had to be reheated. My wife had the Black and Bleu-House burger was cold and missing the bacon and bleu cheese. My Roast beef dip was barely warm and fries were the same. Will never go back to this BJ's again and sounds like the reviews I'm reading, not many more people will either. Finally I sent an email to BJ's Corporate email and no response at all so seems like they don't care at all either. Bye bye BJ's..........."
