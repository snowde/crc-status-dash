Sandra M.,"Houston, TX",53,95,4,3.0,9/6/2013,"I Went with my cousin and friends while out here on a business trip and the food was consistent with all other BJs locations I have visited. The place was clean, the service was fine.  My slightly dirty martini was made right, although it could have been shaken a bit longer to make it colder. My Parmesan crusted chicken tasted good."
Franz C.,"Santa Clara, CA",30,16,3,5.0,10/26/2013,First time in BJs in Southern California. This place was super busy yet a very big establishment. We got out seats within 10-15 min. And our sever was cool! The food was good and the pizzokie was really good!  I would come back here but maybe at a less busier time.
George H.,"Los Angeles, CA",45,50,12,3.0,8/25/2013,"The service here is slow. Not by fault of the servers but the kitchen is holding up the show. We had ordered and waited nearly 40 minutes for our food to show.  We had 2 salads, a flat bread pizza, Mac and cheese and a deep dish for 4 people. The pizza came out cold. We asked if they could reheat it and the server apologized and took it back right away.  We didn't complain but a manager showed up to our table right away and said he would Comp us the pizza and apologized again. He was on top of things and saved the dining experience. He even brought out the hot pizza himself and apologized.  This gives me notion to give them another chance but the kitchen has to step it up.  The food was great otherwise and their craft beers are always a pleaser. When the kitchen can keep up this place will be solid for anyone. Until then they need to fix the issue, but keep the great service the wait staff and manager have.  Good job to them. Will defiantly be back for seconds."
T G.,"Huntington Beach, CA",5,136,143,2.0,10/16/2014,"I love going to BJs restaurant in general, but this location leaves something to be desired. I'm on the fence about giving 2 or 3 stars. Annoying parking situation, restaurant was freezing inside, was brought the wrong food (I have a food allergy and had ordered a specific meal) so I had to wait while they remade my dish, was offered a desert to compensate for mix-up (never saw it), had to wait forever to flag down our server to get the bill. Yeah I think I will stick to the Brea location where parking is free and the service as always great."
Christopher G.,"Burbank, CA",12,16,2,1.0,3/23/2014,"There's a Dog in the restaurant isn't that a health code violation??? Egg rolls where very hot and burned the top of my mouth, pizza was soggy wet like it was under cooked. Place is going down hill.. Maybe it's just this location.."
Anna T.,"Burbank, CA",49,53,8,1.0,11/26/2015,"Last night I was at bjs, I ordered the fettuccine Alfredo for dinner, while sitting there I noticed a bug inside my bread, so I was waiting for our waitress to come, but she never did. (She never even refilled my ice tea!) So I flagged down a another waiter and showed this to him. We all stopped eating our food because we were disgusted of what we saw we had no appetite to eat anything else. The manager came 15 mins later. She was a tall skinny girl with glasses. (She didn't introduce her self so I don't know her name) she went to the wrong table and then came over to us and said I heard there was something wrong. She didn't even know what was wrong. Wow! I explained what was wrong, and she said she was sorry. She wanted to know if she can get us anything else, we explained we were done and we didn't want anything else (after seeing that we don't have appetite for anything else) she said ok, and only took off the fettuccine Alfredo. (Yes I know she should have removed the dinner from the bill that had a bug in it) As a manager or whatever she was because she never introduced herself, she could have handled it a better way. This was the last time I am going there. FYI please train ur managers to introduce theirs selfs and train them to handle a situation a little more proper. Clean ur kitchen! Seeing a live bug in ur food is not appetizing!!!!!!!"
Artemis P.,"Burbank, CA",2,6,1,5.0,1/12/2015,"The only restaurant in the area that was willing to play a Los Angeles Kings game for paying customers. From the hostess to management, everyone was courteous and friendly. The food was great, as usual."
Chloé M.,"LAKE VIEW TER, CA",326,372,173,5.0,11/8/2012,"5 stars definitely for this particular BJ's since they're a chain restaurant. I love this location, it's my go-to. I've been to the one in Glendale and did not have a good experience (hair in my wonton says it all).  Their food here is really good and no hair :]. They're service is good as well, for all the times that I've been I always have a pleasant time. I do have a few yummy in the tummy choices but I forget their names, I only know them by photos on the menu haha sorry. The only go-to I can tell you is to get a pazookie!!!!!!!!! The most amazing thing ever and now that I'm thinking about one, I really really want one.!!!!!!!! So go and enjoy!!!!"
Pablo C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,5.0,2/12/2015,"Came last night for my brother's birthday. I got some of the best service I've had in a while. Scott was our server and the dude killed it. Attentive, nice and great cameraman. Food was awesome and it all came out fast. I'm glad I went. Thanks Scotty."
Jonathan C.,"North Hollywood, CA",86,3,,4.0,1/24/2016,Great experience. We were a party of 15 and took less then 10 min to be seated. Our waiter I believe by the name of Scott was incredibly amazing! He knew what we wanted and didn't take long. The food was great as well as the pazookie!
Anna T.,"Valley Glen, CA",10,21,31,3.0,4/28/2011,Had lunch overload today!!!! Margahrita Fresca Chicken wings Crispy fried artichokes Gourmet melt burger Nd finally ... :)  Triple chocolate pazookie!!!! 5 starzzz!!!  Woot woot
Marice S.,"Burbank, CA",18,34,20,3.0,7/27/2013,"To sum, BJ's has a decent deep dish pizza, the only reason I gave it stars at all. But let's talk about their curbside service, shall we?  What. A. Joke. It's not convenient. It's not fast. And it certainly doesn't make sense. So one evening, we decided to order take out for said pizza. We placed an order online and saw they had curbside pickup. Sure, why not. When our pizza was ready, we drove to the special parking spot in front of the restaurant and called the number on the sign. The guy who answered said, ""Let me guess, an order for Dave.""  Me: ""Um no, this isn't Dave."" How about less guessing and more getting the order right. So we told him our last name and he said they'd be right out. Now in this time, another customer had parked next to us, walked into the restaurant and returned 5 minutes later, food in hand. Ok, so we chose the wrong take out method. When a server finally came out with the food, I handed her my credit card. She had to walk back to the restaurant to ring me up, then back out to give me the receipt. What, no mobile credit card reader?   Sigh, I don't know what I was expecting but it sure wasn't that. And as for the pizza, it was already soggy and cold by the time we got home. Curbside service can kick it to the curb."
Alina S.,"Los Angeles, CA",45,46,670,1.0,10/18/2014,"Been coming here for years and unfortunately what I experienced here tonight, I was really disappointed. Place was a freezer, our waiter he was sick and didn't look right. I felt bad for the guy that he had to be at work with that condition. He was coughing while taking our order and I didn't feel comfortable with that. I had to give 1 star just to be able to post this review."
Cynthia S.,"Granada Hills, Los Angeles, CA",382,284,61,4.0,7/2/2012,"AAAAAAAhhhh... Back to this location for the Avocado egg rolls I adore so much...  Service is always good, and friendly!  Went there for a girls night couple of weeks ago, got seated right away (at a booth) we asked the waitress if they could give us the happy hour prices even though we weren't at the bar area, she asked the manager and agreed! (non of us got drinks) Wth happened there? lol Food is always consistent and delicious... They have a huge menu selection, so something to eat for everyone...  not a big fan of their pizza but other things usually all taste good.  Service has been been good on some nights and bad on others...  Pizzookie is fantastic!!! make sure you always save room!!"
Marconi De M.,"Los Angeles, CA",102,454,5,3.0,7/20/2013,"They improved adding some other craft beers to the menu, they have a nice variety of items on their menu, but it's been a long time since I found a server so unprepared like we had. Taking nearly close to 10 minutes to bring a beer and rushing me asking if I wanted to order food while waiting for the beer... duuuhhhh By the way... I had to get along with my 3rd beer selection... the first two weren't available... only their house IPA... weird... at least... I keep trying wishing it works better next time but I get disappointed every time. It's not bad... it's just another average beer bar where nothing stands out with a terrible service."
Erin A.,"Henderson, NV",21,42,5,4.0,9/14/2013,"This was our first experience at BJ's and I have to say it lived up to all the hype. Everything, and I mean everything we had was delicious. First we ordered the Best beginnings appetizer combo, I tried everything but the avocado egg rolls. The Santa Fe Spring rolls were my favorite. The mozzarella sticks were skinnier than I am used to, coming from Wisconsin where we love our cheese. I was very impressed once I tried them though! We also got the chicken pot stickers, which would of been good if they hadn't sat under the heat lamp waiting for our other appetizer to arrive.  They were just a little crunchy on the outside.      Our waitress was really great at telling us what she recommended and was always on time with our soda refills, which is a must for us! We really hate to wait for refills :)     Next, I ordered the Blonde Fish and chips. Best fish I have had in awhile. Just squeezed a little lemon on them, and they were perfect! Even my husband, who is not a fan of fish, decided to try it, and fell in love! Said he may even order it next time!  All in all, very, very pleased with our visit. We will be back again soon."
Katy P.,"Burbank, CA",140,5,2,1.0,12/30/2014,"Terribly disappointed..  I have been to BJs 2 times within the month... I used to love this place as a kid, but I suppose being a kid my food pallet usually consisted of Kraft Mac n cheese, hot dogs and McNuggets.  I came on a date with my boyfriend. I ordered my favorite appetizer, the avocado egg rolls... Well apparently they come cold and with a slap of buffalo sauce on the side of the plate... On top of that, our appetizer came after our meal.  Although I talked to the manager and she was very nice and gave us a gift card to come back and get another order of my favorite apps.  Well, this time, my friend and I ordered the pazooki trio to go.  One Oreo, one peanut butter, and one chocolate chip.  The Oreo was great, but my peanut butter and chocolate chip were totally burnt....  I'm just totally disappointed.... In all honesty, if I'm in the mood for a big cookie with ice cream, I'll be next door at Black Angus."
Lianne O.,"NORTH HOLLYWOOD, CA",17,255,59,3.0,10/14/2014,"My friends and I waited for 30 mins at our table before a waiter came to take our drink orders but luckily for the waiter, we were so into our convo having fun that we didn't even care. The waiter was so delightful and made sure he made up for his long absence but we assured him it was ok. The food was okay, it wasn't amazing. I expected more from my balsamic chicken :-/. The mashed potatoes were amazing though!  It was nice experience but would prefer elsewhere."
Zachery E.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,4,,1.0,7/9/2012,Really BAD! Food is decent. Service is okay. I came here after work starving. Some coworkers and I ordered a pizza to share and drinks. When the waitress finally brought our food out it was the wrong pizza. She took it back informing us that they would make a new one. That took about 15-20min. When she was on her way to bring it she drops it all over the floor and has to go back to make another one. We waited about and hour or more till they were able to bring it out to us. It didn't taste good and kind of dry for my liking. We ate and we were given our check and they charged us for the wrong food. Overall horrible experience.
Charles D.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,48,85,2.0,8/23/2013,"Not sure what happened here but over the last few years this particular store has seen a decline in food quality. When they still served their deep dish in the pan instead of plate, pizza's were fluffy, crispy and delicious. Coming here at least once a month if not more, I didn't expect such a drastic drop in quality over the past year -- maybe they're no longer using fresh ingredients or modified the original recipe. In any case everything here is now bland, tasteless and seems to be focused around quantity rather than quality. Suffice to say, I'm no longer a regular."
