Genevieve P.,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",0,3,5,5.0,11/24/2013,"This place has been my family's number 1 choice to go eat dinner for about two or three years now. The waitors never fail to keep you satisfied and most of the food on the menu is very good. I always perfer the pramasian crusted chicken. Finally the main reason this is my family's favorite is the pazookie, who does not love a warm cookie topped with ice cream yumm!"
Aerial C.,"Studio City, CA",1,3,,3.0,1/19/2015,"I am new to yelp and like to give good reviews, but about a month ago I went to BJs here in Burbank and received TERRIBLE service. The server was rude and the food came out cold. I had to wait for my food while my friends was already out. This is not good service. I have been to BJs before and like the menu and usually get prompt and friendly service.  I did like the way the manager handled the situation, but now I will think twice about going to BJS (Hooters has just as good  of food selection and service) so humphh."
Salvador E.,"Sunland-Tujunga, CA",0,3,,1.0,1/31/2016,Seems you gotta be white to be seated in a timely manner....RACISM comes in different forms...
Tyler M.,"Burbank, CA",26,40,6,4.0,10/25/2014,"Service can be spotty, but it has improved from previous years.  The food is always good, especially their pizzas (Buffalo Chicken is my favorite) and priced appropriately.  Drinks and beer are good too."
Lisa M.,"Burbank, CA",0,36,,1.0,6/4/2014,Walked in.... A baby strapped to a bar stool AT THE BAR... Babies at the bar. Repulsive. I don't care if it's legal... It's repulsive.
Natasha A.,"Northridge, CA",3,7,3,3.0,7/6/2014,Me and my coworkers come here almost every friday and saturday night around 11 or 12 after we get off work from down the street and I don't know what it is but every time we come here we always receive bad service. I dont know if it's our timing or what but there hasn't been a time where something hasn't gone wrong and it doesn't matter what waiter. It's too much to write because my list can go on and on but for one we never get our drink refills until AFTER we get the check -_- Honestly the only reason why we come back is because we like the food and it beats waiting an hour at buffalo wild wings. We always hope that the next time will be better but it never is. We like to sympathize with our waiters because we work in the food/service industry as well but to get bad service every single time is just weird.
D D.,"Glendale, CA",0,1,2,1.0,2/11/2015,"I ordered from them 2 days ago for pick up, i was surprised when I  opened the  boxes at home. I was one of their fan before, I saw my order.  I will Never go or order from them again. It seems like they throw my food on the boxes and the fries were awful and bad quality same as the food. So disappointed."
Ani B.,"Griffith Park/Los Feliz, Los Angeles, CA",39,187,159,5.0,2/26/2013,Had the pazookie trio! YUMMMM!  Red velvet pazookie sucks! Cookies and Cream----DELICIOUSSSS!!!! Chocolate Chip---YUMMMYYYY!!!! It is heavenly people! I think I am driving myself crazy thinking about it.
Shylo G.,"North Hollywood, CA",29,11,12,4.0,1/1/2015,We came to watch the college football game for the rose bowl. We had 2 different waitresses.  The 1st was OK closed our tab and then didn't tell her replacement to come cause we were gonna be here a while. 2nd one comes her name is Maria. Let me tell you she is on it. She is always checking on us. The food was great. I'm a fan of lots of lemon in my water and she even brought me a plate full. Can't complain
Mako E.,"Los Angeles, CA",27,21,,1.0,10/12/2015,"The receptionist said that we would get faster service at the bar for lunch so we sat there. We spent over a hour and 20 minutes slowest service I've had for an order of chicken wings, a burger and a sandwich.  One server for the busiest area and it wasn't even that busy maybe 20 people."
Paul C.,"Chicago, IL",15,1,,1.0,12/30/2014,"The waiter apparently added $5 tip to himself... My bill was $67 during bank process.. After the bank process $72... We left the tip in cash.  I will  make this short, we order too much food for a small table, ask the waiter to change table, he didn't help us, just walked away... Maybe it was because I wrote how horrible the service was on my printed receipt ..."
Jeniffer I.,"Palm Springs, FL",2,18,6,1.0,8/21/2013,I picked up a pizza here and I was very disappointed. I expected better. Is almost similar to dominos pizza yet not as good. I've had lots of pizzas from all different places so for a medium pizza that cost me $22 it wasn't worth it.
Chantal B.,"Saint Louis, MO",21,22,11,2.0,8/13/2013,"This BJs location is really subpar. Every time I go here I kick myself for not going to the Glendale location. The food is ok, but the service is slow and not really all that friendly.  If you have a craving for BJs, go to the location in Glendale on Brand Boulevard. Sure, you may have to pay for parking, but you'll have a much better experience!"
Claudia R.,"Milford, CT",93,677,2,3.0,4/2/2013,"Pretty average Saturday afternoon lunch here.  Good service.  the veggie burger was good.  I can say, however, that their beer tasted pretty darn good! Maybe I'll stop by again when I go to Ikea!"
Andrew F.,"Carlsbad, CA",37,179,25,5.0,3/13/2011,"GET THE OREO PIZOOKIE! The first time I had BJ's I was in college. It is one of my favorite restaraunts, and I'm super happy we got one in Escondido. I wish it wasn't so popular"
Nance B.,"San Fernando, CA",0,6,1,5.0,11/16/2015,"Awesome server! We went on a Saturday afternoon, so no waiting. I realize there are plenty of places similar to BJ's that offer a quick bite and some beer,  but what made BJ's different was our server. He was just amazing! The young man who served us made it one of the most pleasant experiences I've had in years at any restaurant. I didn't get his first name but I think he mentioned his last name was Boss, which is fitting because he should be promoted to one soon. He not only did a great job answering all our questions (since we rarely come here) but he spoke and socialized with my 6yr old directly. He was great with my son and didn't dismiss him when my son tried to engage him in conversation. You stood there and acknowledged  my kid, and he really felt special because you included him in the conversation.  So I will definitely be coming back , and hope all your staff is as great as Mr. Boss."
Robert D.,"Burbank, Los Angeles, CA",245,285,113,4.0,8/31/2014,This place is good. Always fast service unless ehe you sit outside. But the pazooki is the best.
Orsolya D.,"North Hollywood, CA",835,799,1415,3.0,4/18/2010,"Am I the only one that always thinks of vulgar sexual jokes when it comes to the name of these brewhouses? I'm thinking that was their intention. It's a marketing gimmick to bring attention to the establishment. I know how this works. I was a marketing minor in college... Well, job well done BJ's! Hahaha BJ's ;)  Anyway, putting my immature 12 year old version of myself aside; the BJ's location in Huntington Beach was one of my first reviews on Yelp. It was so horrible; I gave it one star, emailed the corporate BJ's, and swore off the establishment for life. Tonight, I ventured to BJ's in Burbank with some other Yelpers (Val, Jessica, and Anthony) and can say that Mr. BJ gained back some love (I'm still weary but I'll give it SOME credit).  The Burbank location is very spacious with several eating areas and two bars. The seating resembles a cafeteria in size and layout so don't be surprised if you feel the need to look for the ""popular kids"" or the ""computer nerds"" and revert back to high school. We ordered the Pizookie Platter with half chocolate chip and half Oreo and the Beer Sampler. The Beer Sampler included about 8 or so varieties of beer ranging from light Belgian-like beers to dark twins of Guinness. The waitress politely explained each and even asked later in the evening which we liked, etc. An excellent way to find a beer you like for your next visit or feel like a beer connoisseur to impress your friends. The pizookie was fresh, soft, and MUCH better than the raw cookie dough at the Huntington Beach location. Overall, a much better treat which we engulfed like children.  Maybe BJ's isn't that bad and the OC just offers bad service. I suppose one can't go wrong with a BJ!"
Kevin P.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,121,3,4.0,10/17/2014,Food was good but this one waitress too talkative...i thought she was my friend or something. Little too far there. And it felt like the wait was longer than other BJs
Stephanie L.,"Santa Monica, CA",285,676,6,4.0,8/20/2010,"The biggest draw for me to BJ's are the pizookies.  That's really it. Since I can't JUST have a pizookie for dinner, I also ordered the healthiest thing on the menu--Buffalo Chicken Pizza.  I really enjoy buffalo sauce, so I got a side to dip my pizza with.  The small pizza was enough for me to save half for another meal. I was going to order the Pizookie Trio, but my friend wasn't up to the challenge of eating a pizookie and a half by herself so we just got a regular chocolate chunk pizookie.  I sat there waiting in anticipation for the yummy gooey goodness to arrive. It was like one of those moments out of a movie where everything moves in slow motion and the light seems to shine a little brighter like a spotlight on the waitress as she makes her way to our table.  The ice cream was slowly melting so I dug right in.  Pizookies are absolutely amazing and I was VERY happy. My waitress was helpful, a little slow but super nice.  There was a little 10 year old boy in the booth next to us who kept waving at me and even gave me a show using his hands as puppets.  All in all, I had a wonderful experience at BJ's and will definitely be back."
