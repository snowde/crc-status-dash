Robert M.,"Jersey City, NJ",1,2,,3.0,1/19/2015,"A bit disappointed as I've been to others in Florida, Arizona and Los Vegas.  The service was slow and the atmosphere just not the same as experienced before."
Brian C.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,14,,5.0,1/14/2016,"This restaurant is always good.  The food is great and the staff is always friendly and prompt.  I've been going there for a few years, and on the rare times there's a problem with the food, like it wasn't served hot, they immediately - no questions - bring me a new dish freshly cooked - never reheated.  The bartenders are always terrific and treat you like a regular customer.  My only complaint is that they took one of my 2 favorite dishes off the menu.  But chain restaurants are known for changing their menus regularly."
Richard R.,"Escondido, CA",41,26,13,2.0,7/14/2013,"Entre came out right after appetizers. Burger was over cooked.  We sent it back, and again it came out wrong. The manager at least tried to be helpful.  I think what really made this experience awful was our first waiter was fun and attentive, but he went off shift.  Our replacement waiter was the opposite.  Just not a good experience, and we're very unlikely to return."
Conor B.,"Chatsworth, CA",163,1350,106,3.0,6/26/2012,"I can't think of a time I've been to this location when it wasn't absolutely packed. I've even been here where they've lost our reservation (and when you show up with a party of 12 that can be quite a problem). However, the wait staff have always been beyond friendly and helpful which make up for any frustration before being seated."
Jessica G.,"Burbank, CA",14,17,4,3.0,6/16/2014,"I've been there twice (lunch n dinner) and were not fun and amazing experiences. The food is so delicious, yet the servers are too sluggish."
India C.,"Costa Mesa, CA",26,56,34,2.0,3/29/2014,"I tried this place twice, I was excited because we didn't have to chain back home in GA and ppl always raved about the Pizookies. The pizookie and strawberry lemonade are their saving grace - this place is lacking in every other area from customer service to seasoning on the food. The food is bland, mediocre at best! I don't see myself coming back here!"
J G.,"Burbank, CA",0,15,2,2.0,1/23/2014,"Terrible food. Ordered the Thai Salmon that came out without the vegetables and salsa that was shown on the menu. To the staff's credit, was quickly rectified by management so the service was ok. Not great though.o However, when the fully loaded salmon came out, the vegetables tasted like rubber processed garbage.  Not great at all."
Tuesday H.,"Ventura, CA",0,18,,5.0,9/26/2014,"Lidia is an amazing waitress. good service, good food, && very attentive :) thanks for the birthday pazookie. (:"
Betzabeth A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,1,5.0,10/3/2013,"This food was super yummy and you get very big portions. I ordered pasta and my boyfriend ordered jambalaya. Also our server was very attentive and quick. I suggest you call head though, it gets pretty full. Thank you Stephanie Z!"
Marc B.,"Sepulveda, CA",156,104,80,3.0,7/11/2010,"Beeer! So this place is as chain as you can get, but it's pretty decent with pretty good food, and pretty decent beer.  The taste of the food is pretty greasy, even if you got salad. Recently, my friend and I got some drinks and the pizookie and it was pretty good.   Specialty: Pizookie and pizzas.  Beer is specialized here but tastes pretty much the same as the others, really. Recommendation for first timers: Pizza and pizookie with a pint of Hef, if that's what you're into. Service: 7/10, Atmosphere: 8/10, Theme: 9/10 (I like the subtle communist themes lol) Be careful at the Burbank location with the parking as there is a steep hill going up the second level. marc out."
Marisa Z.,"Altadena, CA",316,416,111,4.0,1/29/2013,"***Bar Review***     I have never sat in any of the dining rooms at this or any other location. I have always sat at the actual bar or one of the surrounding high top tables. I don't really care about the whole service aspect of the dining room in corporations such as this one. They always seem to coddle you, filled with fake enthusiasm and try to push things on you that you have no desire for. The bar area is easy, laid back, chill. Plus during breaks in conversation, while say your friend went to the restroom, you can catch the scores to every game.      The happy hours are pretty decent here too, there are two of them. One during the traditional hours one would normally be use to seeing post work, as well as the reverse happy hour that starts at 9, i think, and goes til closing.      The food is decent, better than I anticipated actually. The beer is great, I really enjoy the red, and usually stick to this over the others. Although the last time I was there I noticed something new, guest taps!! And quite a lot to boot too. I was surprised as well as curious and made a mental note to look at the list next time.      The service has generally been great, smiling happy servers that seem genuine rather than acting as if they care.     Remember to stop for cash for the valet. The first time I came here I was driving my manual transmission Mustang and opted to park it myself in the structure. The ramp that leads up to the top floor is steep as hell!! I was super thankful that no one was behind me or in front of me. I could have rolled or stalled. It is that steep. I can't remember how much valet is, I have a truck now that is automatic and the steep incline is just plain fun now."
Hank K.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,81,236,2.0,8/5/2012,"We haven't been back here in a long time. The facility is clean and the service is friendly enough. On par with what you expect from a chain.  Although I didn't have any last night, the pizza is the only thing I'd recommend if visiting a BJ's. It's fairly decent but not traditional Chicago style pizza. The best comparison I can make is Pizza Hut's pan pizza (I figure nearly everyone has tried that at least once). Thicker but not as dense with a chunky marinara sauce and overall better ingredients. Whatever you do, DO NOT order that ""Greek"" pizza. One of the worst pizza's I've tried in my lifetime. Do yourself a favor and stay away from that bitter mess. The Pizookie(?) is a solid dessert.   As a rule, most chains I review receive 3 stars as long as they're clean, consistent and efficient. A few years back we had our credit card information lifted and we have a strong suspicion it happened here. I can't prove it but I'm still knocking a star off because I have a feeling I'm right after retracing our steps. If I could, it would have received one star."
Arpi M.,"Glendale, CA",129,46,,1.0,1/29/2014,Not a fan of this place. My food always comes cold and looking messy. The waiters/waitresses are rude and full of nasty attitude. I don't plan on coming back to this restaurant ever again.
Julia K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,19,,2.0,12/12/2014,I had a pretty bad experience here. My toddler was sleeping and we were seated in the bar area. Service was bad and different waiters would be waiting our table and drop silverware or plates on the table loudly. The food wasn't very good in comparison to other BJs we've been to which is inconsistent.
Kay G.,"Los Angeles, CA",36,248,48,3.0,1/2/2013,"Went to this location in November for a small birthday celebration. This is the first location I've seen that has valet parking. The lot is small and the tiny parking structure is...tiny, but if you can manage to park in the structure then there's no need to fork over $6-7. Like every restaurant on a Saturday night, expect a long wait. Because I've only gone to this location once I can only say that the service for that particular evening was okay. The waitress came around a few times: once to take our orders, once to ask how everything was after our orders had been delivered (she didn't serve us), and once to deliver the check. The waiter serving water came around more often. I'd return, sure. It's BJ's. Chances are the server will be different and my experience will be, hopefully, better."
Jenn C.,"Burbank, CA",4,27,5,4.0,4/29/2013,"I've ordered all diffrent kinds of food (salads, pizza, pasta, bugers, etc) and it's all been good.  The service has always been very friendly.  They are very accomadating for last-minute large parties.  I've celebrated my husbands birthday there for the past two years, and they were very gracious when my party of 12 suddenly turned into a party of 20!  My husband likes the selection of beers, and they have a lot of cocktails, but they are a little watered down. I'll definately be using them again for my next medium-large party."
Irene O.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,1,1.0,6/15/2015,Parking sucks. We drive a Chrysler 300 and when we went up to park the bottom of the car got scrapped. I asked if we could park downstairs but they wouldn't allow it because the bottom parking belongs to the valet parking. The other option was to park a block away. So much for customer service. Because of that I will not take my business to BJs anymore.
T M.,"Burbank, CA",0,41,27,1.0,4/2/2015,The service was terrible and the food was bland.  I wouldn't come to this place again.  Just stay on San Fernando Blvd.
David M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,13,4,5.0,12/3/2014,"Always get great food and service here. Waiter took down my order correctly, but the chef had missed up. They re-did my plate and comped our desert. Always leave here happy."
Benjamin R.,"San Francisco, CA",329,6,,1.0,4/25/2012,Untrustworthy staff. :::BE WARNED:::. My credit card information was swiped from this location. It only place I used and left my credit card out of site while traveling in LA. Food was subpar as well compared to other locations.
