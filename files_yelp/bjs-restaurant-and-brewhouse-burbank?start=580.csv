Remy Y.,"Burbank, Los Angeles, CA",0,8,,5.0,10/25/2014,I have been here for 15 minutes and the service by the waiter Tyler has been nothing but amazing. He greeted us and made us feel very comfortable knowing there is a bunch of homecoming kids and it's super packed. Ensured us that no matter how busy is it his main focus is to take care of us. I highly recommend asking for this guy when coming in.
Luckiblu M.,"Burbank, CA",6,41,16,4.0,4/6/2014,Great service....good place to watch the games & be able to eat decently.  Awesome appetizers to boot!
Katie M.,"Burbank, CA",327,79,2,3.0,3/2/2012,There is nothing better than BJ's pizza and a pitcher of their brew for dinner and a PAZOOKIE for dinner (I go for the half peanut butter half chocolate chunk- YUMMM!).  I love to sit in the bar area on game days since they have so many huge TV's. Add in GREAT happy hour menu and you are in heaven.
Mila D.,"Palmdale, CA",23,86,1,5.0,9/25/2013,"Seriously service is everything.  Thank you Roy I will be back and will be asking for you.  He is awesome. We ordered drinks... I had a caesar salad.  I also had the nachos. And drum roll please... The pazooki with White Macademian.. Goodness it was amazing 3lbs later I will definitely be back.  On a side note another yelper mentioned it, but the hostess did appear as if she had better things to do than to greet people at the door.  She was clearly not thrilled to be there.  Management might want to change that one out.  Considering that is the first person you see when you walk through the door. Hire more people like Roy!!!!!!!!!!!"
MJ N.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,40,3,4.0,6/17/2012,"OK, I think we're regulars. The food and beer have us coming back. Is it the best? No, but it certainly hits the spot. I also experienced the Pazookie for dessert for the first time. An absolute must try!  They've added some dishes to the menu. I tried the Hawaiian Mahi Mahi and it was perfection. Perfect portion, a light meal, great presentation, and very yummy. I highly recommend. We had a funny, attentive waiter again this time too. He was awesome! I still think it's a hit or a miss with this place, but lately it's been hit after hit. We'll be back again very soon, which is almost unfortunate because that Pazookie loving will start showing pretty soon..."
B V.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,3,1.0,9/7/2015,"The waitstaff is terrible and they sit you next to dirty tables. I've asked three times to have the dirty table next to me cleaned off and I've been sitting here for 20 minutes and it's still dirty. The table is full of plates, cups, to go boxes that people left behind. Just disgusting!"
Ketevan E.,"Burbank, CA",1,23,3,5.0,8/10/2015,"ALEXANDRA My server was amazing !!! Sweet ,professional & the best service I'v gotten in a long time ! I will come back :) plus the deep pizza was amazing"
Benjamin S.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,110,22,2.0,11/26/2012,"BJ's just isn't what it used to be.  I had dinner here a couple nights ago and I don't need to eat here again for years (if ever again).   I ate at BJ's a lot in college and it was great.  Now, not so much.  The pizza is nothing special.  The appetizers we ordered were not good.  Even the pizzukie was just ok.   Maybe I've outgrown eating food like this?"
Ralph T.,"Stateline, NV",14,438,28,3.0,11/11/2012,Friendly staff. The normal BJ's restaurant and food. Not really too much to say about it. This is a kid friendly place with lots of TV's to watch sports. They have a full bar and happy hour. Food quality is good and what you would expect from this type of restaurant.
Katherine J.,"Los Angeles, CA",83,6,31,1.0,9/27/2014,"I took my family here tonight.  First they forgot my salad, I had to ask two different servers where it went.  Our waiter tools me after ten minutes that someone else took it.  There was a large and lid table next to us that always had their drinks filled and even when I asked for a refill on my water, I did not get one.  Felt like I want worth the time. I then got my favorite dish, the balsamic chicken.  I specified that I wanted light on the glaze, it came with more than double the amount.  I had explained this to the server. He said, oh yes that is a lot more than normal.  He spoke to the manager and they were unwilling to do anything about the issue.  The manager didn't even have the courtesy to come apologize.  Poor service.  I wouldn't recommend this location."
Ally P.,"Peoria, AZ",3,1,,4.0,8/26/2014,"Had a great lunch at this location. Sat at the bar, bartender named Jesse provided EXCELLENT service. I'm not big on tomatoes but he suggested to keep tomatoes on the top of the pizza because they are cooked and seasoned, like having a little extra sauce on top! Salad was a regular caesar nothing special but still good. For lunch under $8, definitely hit the spot!"
Aaron F.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",215,424,,3.0,10/12/2012,"As usual, this is your typical BJ's restaurant. One thing that kind of annoys with me this chain is the overburdened toppings on all the pizza's. I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Pizza and every slice broke in half as I was about to take a bite. Maybe lay off a bit on the toppings? Service was really good from the hostess to the managers."
Jolyne C.,"Burbank, CA",15,77,4,2.0,6/19/2014,"Drinks are fantastic (especially the root beer), but the food has been bad almost every time I went (and you can get a better tasting steak for cheaper at say, Outback.) The servers have always been pretty nice but a couple of times I went for takeout and the hostesses were rude."
Michael P.,"Sunland-Tujunga, CA",0,2,,1.0,9/13/2015,We have been here many times before but tonight's experience was terrible. The worst service and waited over an hour for our food. It will be a while before we return. I spoke with the manager and she apologized.
Liz V.,"Los Angeles, CA",21,91,1,2.0,6/11/2014,"like most american chain restaurants, BJ's is whatever. i never crave it  but if a friend wants to come here, i don't object.  after so many times of ""hmm..i should try something different. the menu is pretty large...sandwich, specialty entree..."" , i realized to just stick with what's good.  appetizer: avocado egg rolls entree: pizza (any one) dessert: pizookie (so many options now...all delicious) drink: blonde; very berry cider"
Tiffany L.,"Glendale, CA",23,24,5,4.0,9/12/2014,I love this place. Great variety of food and drinks. The beer is very delicious. The service is good nothing special. The pazookie are the best dessert. Make sure you order one!
Kim L.,"Los Angeles, CA",190,79,22,5.0,6/7/2014,Came here on a Friday night and the wait was only 10 min! Which was great how packed they where. So we sat down and ordered or drinks. Then after ordered are food. The food took longer then expected but our waiter Arnold was checking on us every 5 min and gave us free French fries and some drinks because are food was taking so long! Which was so nice of him. He always came by to apologies and was very attentive . On top of that our food came and he took $5 off my bill and gave us a free pizookie on the house! He was such a great waiter with great costumer service skills. Not once was I upset how long the food took to get to us. I will defiantly come back and request him to be my server! He was beyond great! And the hostess at the front desk was very happy and answered all my  questions I had! They where so busy and so on top of there game still! One of my favorite BJ's I have gone to.
Alex S.,"North Hollywood, CA",36,29,3,5.0,4/17/2014,"It was the celebration of my lovely brother. Party of over 20 people. Service was great, the waitress took care or all of us. She was friendly and fun. We did order a lot and had different orders. Would definitely recommend this place due to the service and great food."
Morgan S.,"Burbank, CA",0,12,1,1.0,12/17/2015,"Called BJs at 2:50 to make a reservation to eat at 5. Walked in just a few minutes before 5 and was told it would be a 15 min wait. Made reservations because our party had to be somewhere by 7 and we couldn't afford to be late. Was a little thrown off when we walked in and they said it would be a 15 min wait.  Since it was my mom's birthday and that was where she wanted to eat I was willing to wait. We finally go to get seated and they attempt to put us in a small booth that might have fit 4 adults, mind you our party was 6 adults and two high chairs. We asked to get a different table with a little more room and they told us all the other tables had reservations....the place was practically empty! We asked to speak to the manager. He finally comes out and is rude. He goes on to say we actually didn't have a reservation it was actually considered a call ahead. He said the table they were offering usually fits 7 people. I couldn't help but laugh, there was absolutely no way! The manager made no attempt to even offer us a different table he just wanted to make negative comments towards us that we didn't have reservations.  We walked out and called over to Gordon Biersch. They were able to sit us immediately and they were busy!!! They had great customer service and extremely friendly. We had never been before and our server offered us samples of beer so we could pick what we wanted to order to drink. Had a great atmosphere too! Highly recommend you head to GB over BJs! Gordon Biersch even apologized on behalf of BJs for giving us such a horrible experience.  Needless to say I will never think to go back to BJs!"
Zoey S.,"Union City, CA",126,72,125,5.0,10/8/2013,"Came here for dinner on a Saturday night. Wait time was only 15 minutes for a party of 2. Our server was Lindsay and she was a great server. She was super friendly and attentive. We ordered lettuce wraps, chicken and salmon teriyaki. All entrees were delicious. Staff here are super nice."
