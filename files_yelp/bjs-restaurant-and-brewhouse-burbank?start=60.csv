Marc C.,"Toluca Lake, Los Angeles, CA",0,11,,1.0,10/23/2017,"No stars deserved!! What's the point of having an app or offer to give customers the option to order online if every single time, countless times, the food is never ready, ""oh, it says pick up time, but that's actually the time we actually receive the order to start preparing."" After long day at work and having to have your dog wait in the car since the expectation is to go in and come out with paid for order.  Instead having to wait at least another 15 to 20 min because of an error they are already aware of?? And in the past you call several times to confirm they have your order and are working on it, but constantly getting placed on hold and no pick up."
Tab A.,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",78,7,4,2.0,6/29/2017,"We have had really enjoyable experiences at the BJ's in Santa Clarita and Glendale, but Burbank?  No bueno.  Poor customer service, filthy bathrooms, and rude management.  Restaurant critic Elmer Dills always said that if a restaurant's bathrooms (which are public) are filthy, you can bet that the kitchen will not be any better. My personal opinion is that the poor customer contact, neglectful table service, and dirty premises at the Burbank location is most likely a reflection of bad management (the staff trying their best under poor leadership).  The manager was condescending and dismissive.  We will return to Glendale and Santa Clarita, but definitely not to Burbank."
Thomas B.,"Burbank, CA",12,72,8,3.0,7/2/2017,"The food was ok but service was not great.  No cutlery. We had to ask for it. Lighting was Too dark to read menu.  During meal, not one plate or glass were bussed off the table.  When the bill came it was just a printout...no faux leather folder or anything.  Just the bill.  Just as we are about to leave they take plates.  I don't know if that's their policy but I don't like to eat surrounded by plates. Might try another time. Maybe we came on an off night"
Crystal C.,"Van Nuys, CA",16,42,48,1.0,10/8/2017,The service is horrible! It took us an hour and half maybe even more to get our food. We didn't even end up eating and took our food to go. I used to like BJs because of the dessert but it's hard coming back here . Our waiter didn't even come to our table to give us refills and couldn't even clean up our table . I'll just stick to TGIF
michael r.,"Glendale, CA",42,87,,1.0,9/30/2017,I dont know how I even ended up here.. but Mark the. Manager does not honor any Promos that Bjs play on national tv. Next time Bjs...hold the sausage...

Judy L.,"Burbank, CA",123,263,770,4.0,1/22/2017,"Came here just for their famous Pizookies and now with this mini trio, you can satisfy all your sweet tooth needs! Delicious as always. Check out my photo and salivate !"
Jen R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,1.0,10/12/2017,horrible experience! my family and I went out to dinner to celebrate my nephews birthday on a Friday to leave very disappointed. Food took over an hr to come out and when it did my medium well steak was dripping blood! I was so grossed out ! waiter literally only served us one round of drinks when we asked for a refill it never came. ZERO STARS if I could! Oh and to top it off our appetizer came out once we were done eating !!!!
Tristan S.,"Burbank, Los Angeles, CA",88,4,,1.0,12/11/2017,"Want to wait 40 minutes for an order that was completely f***** up? Want to wait an additional 45 minutes for a very simple order of ribs? Or do you prefer waiting 30 minutes for 2 beers? BINGO! You have found the right place! Our server Gina was awesome! But the kitchen SUCKS and the bartenders SUCK at this location. We got there at 10PM and left at 12:45! Worlds longest BJ's trip! And to top it all off, they triple charged us for EVERYTHING! Do NOT go to this location. Horrendous. I dropped a single $20 bill on the table and said f*** you guys and left."
Edy O.,"TUJUNGA, CA",144,74,421,5.0,5/3/2017,"This place is awesome, but let me start off by saying that you shouldn't expect a 5 star steakhouse. This is just a great place to hang out and have something to drink and eat, that tastes good, and has very nice staff. That's why this place got 5 stars from me. Enjoy, I suggest the ribeye, medium with an ipa."
J.Krys M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,18,8,1.0,5/15/2017,"Myself and a few friends happened to be driving by the area and decided to stop by this location this saturday 4/13/17 around 5pm.... very disappointed in the end.  First of all, parking is very difficult to find unless u are doing valet. Second, the bartenders werent very attentive and didnt care much for what you were saying. Third, my friend and i both ordered the Chicken alfredo... it came out (30 min later) looking like only pasta with raw broccoli on top. Neither of us were given alfredo sauce.. and the food looked as if it had been sitting for quite some time before being brought out to us:/  We were so hungry we decided to only ask for more sauce instead of returning the entire plate. 10 long min later after asking our server to bring a side of sauce, we get only ONE side instead of 2.  It was terrible and the broccoli was crunchy and entire plate was cold after everything.  Definitely my least favorite BJ's location. I will never return here sadly."
Shirley T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,17,16,1.0,6/9/2017,"So am writing this review as we leave the restaurant. There are a couple of things that went wrong with today and most of it has to do with the long wait and service. I would normally not mind such things but it is different when I see the staff chatting and having personal conversation among each other and several empty tables. First we put or name in for a table with the girl at the front and was told 15 minutes, no problem. Then as we are sitting there with no one else waiting, it seems the girl at the host table leaves and the gentleman takes her place but not before chatting it up for about 15 minutes. We continue to wait another 10 minutes or so and the gentleman asks us if we are waiting for take out. I tell him no and that we are waiting for a table. He then says ""omg why did no one tell me, let me get you a table"". Apparently the girl didn't notify him of our wait.  Once we get a table we sit there and look at the menu without getting acknowledgement. Normally I wouldn't mind especially if it is busy but we had quite a few tables around us that were empty. We figure out what we all want to order and are still waiting. By this time a little less than 10 minutes have passed. Our waiter then comes over and tells us he will be right with us. Then a few minutes pass and another group gets seated next to us. The waiter goes to them and gets their drink orders while we are still waiting with no drinks or having put any orders in. We then see the waiter go in and out of the kitchen several times and stop to have personal conversation with coworkers. By this time it has been a little under 15 minutes of just sitting at the table totaling about 40 minutes. By this time we were done and angry so we walked out."
Sean S.,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",2,5,2,5.0,9/28/2017,"First, let's talk about Max our server. At first he seemed a little shy by his body language and that was perfectly fine. Then my Girlfriend and I soon found out it was his first day and the whole house was packed. I knew from previous occupations that the first day is the day that makes or breaks you. To my knowledge, today being busy was the perfect opportunity to make him a great server. He kept the drinks flowing without even asking and told us about the daily specials they offered. Overall, and I'm speaking to the owner reading this, he did great. Thumbs up max, I appreciate your hospitality and I'll definitely be coming back."
Ritchie P.,"Granada Hills, CA",540,26,65,4.0,6/12/2017,"Was here for my Sister in laws Birthday, we started off with a awesome server Brandon that is very attentive to our orders, specially with our crazy noisy group. Our appetizer orders came fast and they are delicious, the Pizza with thin crust just lasted a few seconds with our group and gone, i ordered rib eye steak for my main course, my clam chowder soup came first and the taste and texture is already perfect. My Rib eye the was another story it was salty. Over all my experience with BJ was good"
Destiny P.,"Las Vegas, NV",87,15,5,1.0,9/28/2017,"My boyfriend and I were staying in Burbank on vacation at a nearby hotel close to the BJs Burbank location and decided to get takeout from there one night since we had a coupon. I ordered the prime rib dip with white cheddar mashed potatoes and my boyfriend got the sliders with French fries. The girl ringing us up was very friendly and accommodating. However, when we got back to the hotel to eat I was unpleasantly surprised. My prime rib dip was bright red in some spots and then gray in others. It looked extremely unappetizing. To top it off my mashed potatoes had MOLD on them. Yes, mold. I immediately contacted the restaurant and waited on hold several minutes to speak with a manager. I explained to him the situation and even offered to bring the food back. He then argued with me and said that they cook their prime rib to medium rare and if I brought it back he could cook it longer for me if I wanted. I said I would just prefer a refund and he said in order for me to get a refund I'd have to come back and he would have to reauthorize a charge for the entire meal on my card again (which would come off who knows when) and then I would get a refund (who knows when). I declined and he said he'd have his manager email me a gift card in, also, an undefined amount of days. I am now disgusted, without dinner, and without a refund. This was a pretty sad outcome for a place we usually love to go to."
Sarguis G.,"Van Nuys, Los Angeles, CA",47,42,25,1.0,12/10/2017,"It starts with managment because your who trains your workers on how to perform at a level customers expect them to perform at. We get seated, not one worker approches us for 10 min, we all order and I got a beer so everyone got their drinks except me. After another 10 min of waiting for my beer I had to walk to the bar and ask for my beer and our waiter which was the bartender said he forgot about it. Poured a terrible pour from the tap which was half foam and it was spilling all over as he handed it to me, had I had to correct him and said Theres no way im walking away with this, unreal. after we got our food we never saw a waiter again till we received our check, no refils no nothing. terrible service. All these waiters know that people double the tax for tip or there is a percentage printed to help us tip so they dont bother trying. Well I left nothing so hopefully they can change their ways. I wont ever know because I wont be back."
Annie T.,"Los Angeles, CA",58,59,90,5.0,5/18/2017,Getting drunk at bjs lol drinking all day all the way to Palm Springs haha the food is amazing I got a healthy choice of grilled salmon with some salad I LOVE THIS PLACE I HATE THE GIRLIE DRINKS lol I just couldn't drink hard liquor with the fam bam but I need a scotch right now cheers ya filthy animals
Rainbow Y.,"Santa Ana, CA",58,10,529,1.0,9/30/2017,"Do not ever go to this BJ. I just spoke to the manager Mark about an ad that we saw on TV but did not receive. My mom saw the ad on TV that lead her to want to try BJ but did not remember the name of the deal and we asked about the special that's happening now and was lead to the specials that were only happening during the weekdays not the one that was advertised on TV. So when we saw the ad again and called to find out how come we didn't get the deal that was advertised on TV, the manager Mark said that it's because they are not allowed to advertise an ad that is on TV in person because they have so many coupons going on and we had to say the specific deal to get it. I just thought if you advertise something on national TV, they should say tell you when ask about it.  This just leaves a bad impression and we won't go there again."
Tadeh B.,"Grandview, Glendale, CA",13,15,,4.0,10/16/2017,Great serving and fun atmosphere. I love their pan pizzas so I'm going with great food also. Drinks are really tasty too.
Steffi H.,"Newport News, VA",0,19,2,1.0,3/11/2017,"Horrible service, after waiting 25 minutes for a personal pan pizza it came out freezing cold, my daughters chicken Alfredo was cold with barely any alfredo. The restaurant itself was dirty and the bathrooms I couldn't even go in because of the toilet paper streamed from one side to the other and the smell. It didn't appear that it had been cleaned in days. Very poor service, rude customer service and couldn't even get the correct bill. WILL NEVER RETURN !!!! Suggest a training day and cleaning spree for your staff"
