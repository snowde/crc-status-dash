Steven G.,"Portland, OR",69,4,,4.0,9/5/2015,"Sorry for swearing, service at the front desk was less than friendly. The hostess never even looks up unless you summon her.  I feel guilty posting that earlier but they more than made up for it after that start. Staff and manager were excellent and they do care about your experience.  Food was really great and the desert was excellent.  Great birthday dinner for my wife and family to end the day."
Joel M.,"Sunland, CA",71,22,5,1.0,9/11/2011,"Made a reservation for 7, got there, made me wait 30 minutes till I asked why haven't I been seated, they gave away my seats to another party who only been there for 5 min, Yeah... that's all, we left and got tacos Tip: don't make a reservation, you will probably get a seat faster"
Taylor W.,"Los Angeles, CA",552,34,12,3.0,6/2/2014,"My friend and I have been going there once a week now. We've had some really good service but last night really made me upset. I had a salad that I asked for no cucumber, they messed it up once so they remade it and it still had cucumber, then my pasta came out. IT WAS COLD, they sent it back to warm it up it came back, I couldn't even taste a difference.. They ended up remaking it. I spoke to the manager which his name was jack.. Worst choice to do, he took ten minutes to get to my table and was laughing while we were telling him our issue. I will never go again when jack is working."
Jason O.,"Pasadena, CA",235,288,8,4.0,9/21/2012,"I have been to this location at least 3 times now.   Each time has been a pretty good experience.   Once they made my pizza with cheese even though I asked for no cheese.  they took it back and fixed it and gave me a pazooki for free.   That's good service. This trip there were no problems.    Great pizza, great sandwiches, and the pazookie is so good.   This place could go up to 5 stars if they keep this up."
hrayr o.,"Burbank, CA",79,7,5,1.0,8/16/2013,"I love BJ's.  I love how their menu, food and service is pretty much the same, regardless of the location.  But I stopped coming to this location since the last time I ate here, and I doubt I'll be back anytime soon.   On my last visit I had the worst waiter experience in my life.  His name was David (if I'm not mistaking), a young black male.  If there was a contest for the most annoying person, i would definitely vote for him.  I'm pretty sure that everyone else who was being served by him would do the same.  I can't find the right words to describe how obnoxious he was and I don't even want to. It will take me back to that day and get me angry again.   Thanks for messing up my dinner David.  Now because of you I drive extra 5 miles when I want BJ's."
Jazmin B.,"Sylmar, CA",2,8,14,3.0,7/27/2014,"Super sad, ordered to go and my pizza was chewy, and lacked ingredients... I'm wondering if the quality of to go is different than dine in?  We've been there before and it's usually pretty good, was thinking about having my birthday party there... But now I'm not certain that's a good idea.  We paid 33 bucks for a chewy pizza, and a pizookie, it will probably be a while before we go back.  On the upside my husband said it looks like they remodeled, and it looks nicer and wide open, the pizookie was very good too."
Jim D.,"Burbank, CA",1,104,,2.0,3/20/2012,"First off let's get this straight, this is not Chicago style pizza, not even close. It's just some deep dish swill. Real Chicago pizza is amazing, this is not. Now that we've got that out of the way let's talk about the terrible service you get here. If there are ruder waitresses than this place has, I've yet to meet them. I get it, the place is understaffed but here's a thought, swing by your customers' tables every 20 minutes or so to see if they've died yet. Cool? Next, damn this place is loud. It's like the trading pit for commodities in Chicago. Why is it so bloody loud?  Also, ever notice and this is funny, they never, ever have the beer you want. Ever. How can a place that claims to be a brewhouse not have the brew you want?  Lame, weak sauce, pass!"
Dana P.,"North Hills, CA",65,299,28,2.0,9/24/2011,"I struggled with my decision on whether to give this place 2 or three stars.  I had to settle on 2 because I have had some of the WORST service here..EVER. The food is on par with any other BJ's location.  My issue here is the service.  Now, good customer service has never been synonymous with any BJ's I have ever been to, but this location has some major issues.  Some of my favorite horrible customer service moments include: - Being seated at a DIRTY table.  I asked the hostess to have someone clean off the table, and she brings ME a paper towel.  Are you serious?! Did you put me on BJ's payroll and forget to tell me?  After I told her that I wanted someone other than myself to clean it, she gets a bus boy who makes sarcastic remarks to me.  The server is just the cherry on top and ignores me and my bf while being perfectly nice to everyone else in the place. - Being with a group making them LOTS of money (ordered pitchers of drinks, apps, entrees, the works!).  We get to dessert and the pizookie comes out COLD...the ice cream wouldn't even melt.  We tell our server (after waiting 20 minutes), and her response is ""Well if you want me to send it back, you're just gonna be waiting even longer.""  Really???? It took at least another 30 minutes to settle the check.  We got the manager, who informed us that we had to wait for the server because of the way we were paying. WTF...I guess BJ's pays so well that these people don't want tips. The last time I came here was a few days ago and my experience was actually okay, but they really need a Customer Service refresher course!"
Andre B.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,33,,1.0,6/18/2015,"I have been to many BJ's before, but the customer service in here is just terrible. Besides the fact that the waiter had an attitude deficiency as if the customers were the inmates of Alcatraz, the manager simply didn't care when she was asked to look into it. This place has really bad customer service issues."
suzie b.,"North Hollywood, CA",120,151,28,5.0,7/16/2011,"Wow, i feel really bad that so many yelpers have experienced bad service here because our waitress was excellent! They have  a few good beers on tap (better than Gordon Biersch, actually), but i opted for a bottled Hoegarden. First beer that came out wasn't super cold....i told the waitress and she made sure the next 2 were just the way I wanted it. I had the margherita flatbread, which was delicious!!! They have a bunch of other really good stuff on the menu like the avocado egg rolls. And for the sports enthusiasts...plenty of flat screens!"
AnThony A.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,14,,1.0,6/30/2015,let me save some poor unsuspecting sucker the time to come here the service = shit not only that the prices will murder your wallet 2 pizzas and 4 drinks over 60 wtf go to another place ppl
Wendy S.,"Van Nuys, CA",360,424,,3.0,12/19/2011,"you know. what are you gonna do? the mister wants pizza, and it has to be gluten free. you take one for the team and head off to bj's so your manchild will be properly fed this holiday season.  now, the service is fine, it's comfy for a large scale operation, and the waitress was so kind as to bring my a menu that specified all food ingredients to facilitate my decision making process. basically, what i discovered, is that other than chips, the only items at bj's that do not have milk are meat, poultry and fish are salads. so, to put it in a little vegan nutshell, bj's is NOT a vegan friendly joint! being a super good sport, i ate my salad sans half the ingredients and used tabasco for my dressing. which, at least, means my ensalada was not the originally designated over 1000 calories that the menu listed."
Onion O.,"Valencia, CA",12,13,2,3.0,5/24/2014,it was okay. i ordered a fettuccine chicken Alfredo. wasnt the best.
Amanda N.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,3,,1.0,12/18/2015,"Extremely poor customer service.  Walk to the counter to inform the hostess I had a reservation, she said it would still be 15 minutes to ""prepare"" our table.  The place was empty except for the bar.  She never apologizes for the wait or even acknowledge us.  Once we are taken to the table, it would not fit our size of a group.  We requested not to be seated in a booth and was told there were no other options, even though we were surrounded by plenty of open 4 seater tables.  When we asked for the manager, he again never apologized instead wanted to debate what a call ahead vs reservation was, even though it was HIS staff that told us we had a reservation over the phone.  These differences were never explained on the phone when the reservation was made.  The manager made no effort to remedy the situation, explain or even apologize; therefore, we left.  Myself, coming from a customer service background was horrified by the service from the front line staff all the way up to the manager.  I would NOT recommend eating here.  Customer service should be more important than arguing with a customer.  Extremely disappointed."
Tim H.,"Beverly Hills, CA",27,81,,4.0,4/24/2014,Irish root beer is astoundingly good.
Phoebe Y.,"Burbank, CA",157,19,4,4.0,5/5/2014,Most of the time I come here because it's one of the few places open late in Downtown Burbank. The food is always good and the staff is always kind. I've even come here without a reservation on the night of the Super Bowl and didn't have to wait long (I guess because the restaurant is so big). Overall it's a nice place to have dinner or a late night snack.
Derek I.,"Burbank, CA",1,28,,1.0,10/11/2013,"I'm Derek, Party of 2.  I was quoted a 25 minute wait time and after 30 minutes I checked in and they told me that I was three parties away from being called.  After a total of 60 minutes I checked in again.  Apparently they had me written down as Eric Party of 3 and had called for us 20 minutes before.  Obviously we hadn't responded since we are Derek Party of 2. When we asked what the mix up was, they told us that we should have checked in earlier.  When we told them that we had, they told us that we should have checked in again. Word of advice: Check in every time a party is called, even if a different name and a different sized party was called."
Diane F.,"Burbank, CA",28,26,8,2.0,6/21/2013,"I really like BJs and have been there a few times, but this time, the food wasn't that great.  The Strawberry Martini was excellent and the clam chowder too, but my meal which was Chicken Fried steak was awful.  It was tough and the mashed potatoes and vegetables were cold.  The gravy that came with it was spicy and I had to order extra because they barely put any on the potatoes and steak.  Not happy with it.  Should have stuck with a burger or sandwich.  I wanted to order dessert, but the selection was either cookies with ice cream or just ice cream.  So I passed."
Aimee T.,"Burbank, Los Angeles, CA",1024,253,2132,5.0,3/13/2012,I love this BJ's however sometimes the service can suck during really pack nights.  The food is always good.  Great for curb side.
M E.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,12,,1.0,11/11/2013,"Food hast lost it's quality, the deep dish pizza's are not worth it AT ALL! The ""entree"" salads are not enough for a light meal, and the customer service is just horrible. Don't waste your time."
