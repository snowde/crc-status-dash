Jennifer L.,"Los Angeles, CA",40,30,,1.0,3/8/2014,"took the waitress an hour to come to our table after we were seated, I had to walk to the front and ask the hostesses what was going on and she had to go look for our waitress. Then she proceeded to take forever and talk to the fellow waitresses instead of serving us our dinner. Worst experience at a restaurant. The food was cold when it FINALLY came and she never offered to make up for the terrible experience. This solidified my feelings for chain restaurants."
Wendy B.,"Los Angeles, CA",38,7,2,1.0,5/5/2015,I'm giving one star no for the service!!! I went this past Saturday to this place and I'm giving one star for the valet parking  in this place they stolen an iTunes gift card from my car so be careful if you leave belongings in your car it may disappear
Keith S.,"Glendale, CA",286,13,,2.0,6/6/2014,"Very disappointing.  Sat at a table with sun setting on us, preferred to move to another table next door with same server, yet hostess moved us into the BAR, with three TVs, not conducive to conversation.  Ordered Bleu burger medium rare, came out well done, dry, not a good preparation...Granville much better.  Slow, inattentive service, no check backs."
Eric W.,"Canoga Park, CA",166,672,148,3.0,2/7/2010,"The biggest complaint I have about this BJ's location is the parking.  It's a narrow driveway that essentially requires valeting the car and the non-valet structure (top only) is a really small lot. I had to choose a restaurant for a work lunch and chose this restaurant because I like it and I knew everyone could find something they want.  I've been several other times too including with my girlfriend and we had really good meals with solid service.  The food is usually really good -- their menu is super diverse from sandwiches, salads, pasta and pizza.  Their micro brews are really good too.   I had one error on a visit here.  We had just been to a USC football game and came for a dinner.  The restaurant messed up our order for a calzone and not only did the manager come over and we got comped on the calzone but they gave us a free dessert.  That made up for the error. The sports bar has a lot of TVs if you can find a seat.  Also, there are several TVs throughout the restaurant to catch a game.  It's also a great place to let kids run wild because it's so big. I'm up for BJ's Restaurant just about always and this location works.  It's not as unique as other restaurants because it's like a high-end Chili's if there is such a thing, but everyone should enjoy it."
Jean L.,"Burbank, CA",424,331,141,3.0,2/16/2011,"I love beer I love beer I love beer I love beer... I don't come here for a nice dinner with a friend. I come here for: The basketball games; Pitchers of beer; Shareable appetizers; And pizookies.  I get the best beginnings appetizer, which is eh, because the Avocado Egg Rolls taste more like pure avocado than a roll; the Spinach and Artichoke dip is alright; the Mozzarella sticks are eh; the Santa Fe Spring Rolls are okay too, I eat them without the sauce. It's just something to snack on while watching the many TVs in the restaurant. I've also had many of the sandwiches they offer, they are OK too. I'd probably order only burgers if I had to eat here. If you don't care about foodie food, and instead care about 1) COLD BEER; 2) GAMES; 3) and DESSERT, this place is a 3-bird-1-stone hit."
D D.,"Sylmar, CA",39,61,5,2.0,6/15/2011,"I was getting together with two really good friends and us girls decided to let the guy pick where he wanted to go.  ""let's go to BJ's"". In my mind I thought Yuck.....but I don't like it when someone asks me where I want to go eat, I reply with Blah, and they say: ""No, let's go somewhere else"".  I complied. This place is so boring to me. The menu is large but nothing seems appetizing. I decided to go with the Seared Ahi Salad. After all, how much can you mess that up right?  It was decent. I asked for dressing on the side, which was a great idea, since what I got on the side was oil and chives......""Excuse me is this the dressing?"" Not impressed. I don't really get this place, but know people that tend to disagree.  BJ's I will have to pass on your extended menu. Third time is not a charm for you."
Burbank D.,"Burbank, CA",0,21,1,3.0,7/5/2015,"The food was pretty lifeless (the burgers are basically just circles of ground beef), but the service was pretty good. Eh. I can see why people would come here for events, or if they don't know any other restaurants in the area, but I probably won't come back unless I'm going to an event. The food's not worth it. Don't expect a culinary treat."
Thomas M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,9,2,2.0,7/2/2015,"Did you know that BJs started out as a pizza parlor in Santa Anna, CA? Too bad they lost the recipe for pizza. How difficult is it to put on some sauce? Sent the first pizza back and the waiter requested ""extra sauce"" for the remake. About 15-20 minutes later and after my dinner companion completed his meal, the replacement pizza came out. No sauce but more tomatoes on top. Was so hungry, ate first slice and took the rest home so I could add some spaghetti sauce to give it flavor and moisture. Manager not thrilled that pizza was so bad, esp after being reminded of their history posted in their menu. Service is mostly good but have had tastier from food trucks."
R T.,"North Hollywood, CA",7,15,19,2.0,4/29/2012,"Good place for beer, and that's it. The food is terrible. Cut down on the menu so you guys can focus on making better food. I had rib-eye, only because everything else looked so bad, and seasoned fries, which were dry with steamed vegetables, which were more than likely microwaved."
Benny S.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,223,,4.0,3/25/2012,"BJ's Restaurant is awesome.  I consistently have a great experience here. Pros: - The Food.  Other than the pizza, everything on the menu tastes SO GOOD.  The flatbread pizza is great, but the regular pizza is below average.  I recommend the Chicken Parmagian or their pastas.   - Outdoor seating on a sunny day during lunch. - Extremely low prices for lunch specials. - Their brewed beers deliver a strong buzz.  Porter is too strong, too dark though. Cons: - Valet parking during lunch, but it's totally free, and you can park a block away to the south on the street for free, fairly easily. - Pizza doesn't have enough sauce. - Some of the indoor wrap-around booths are uncomfortable to sit at.  Stick with the classic table and chairs, or sit outdoors."
Tara H.,"Inglewood, CA",2,7,,1.0,6/5/2013,"I ordered a Medium-Well Sirloin steak with broccoli side dish. After 10 minutes they brought me an Over-Done steak and when I complained, the manager came and said they will bring another one soon because they have steaks on the grill already, but it took another 7 8 minutes. This was in a Thursday night at 10 o clock which is not that crowded. The second dish they gave me didn't even have broccolis!! Don't go to this branch. It is a waste of money and time."
Danny B.,"Sun Valley, CA",5,14,2,1.0,4/17/2014,Horrible service.!!!!they do not know how to run a business and serve a customer. Saw roaches on the floor and they didn't even apologize wish I can give negative stars.
Logan G.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,82,3,1.0,9/4/2014,I tried to come to this location this afternoon. The parking valet blocks off 80% of the parking spaces available there for paying valet customers. They told me I couldn't park on the ground level and had to park upstairs in their garage structure. Their second level parking had half of the parking blocked off as well. There were no spaces available and when trying to go back to ground level I had no choice but to exit the same way I took going up. There was no separate lane from ongoing and in going traffic. It's a really dangerous move to try and cause accidents. Shame on you for hogging all the parking. I will never go here due to crappy unacceptable parking ethics by your valet people.You will lose customers daily to Black Angus right next door. Get a clue.
Elena S.,"Burbank, CA",4,4,,1.0,4/6/2013,"I don't usually waste my time with reviews but I had to say this ! I ordered chicken Marsala- flavorless , the side pasta was undercooked and flavorless as well just a hint of salt and a lot of oil! The worst food I have had in a while!"
Juan R.,"Sun Valley, CA",1,11,,1.0,5/9/2014,"Found a hair in my food,they denied it saying it was a shred of salary I'm not stupid. They made me feel very uncomfortable. Never going there again!"
David S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/12/2015,"For this experience, there should be no stars.  I've been to other BJs before and generally they are good.  This one was pathetic.  I had a flight out of Burbank airport in two hours and my girlfriend and I were looking for someplace to catch a fast bite when we saw BJs and decided to stop.  To begin with there was a birthday party with about 20 4 year olds screaming their heads off.  That's what Chucky Cheese is for -- not a brew pub.  It took a while for our server to take our order and we got a couple of pints of the house brews -- which were good.  That was the highlight.  We ordered burgers because we thought that would be fast.  Wrong.  Almost an hour after we got there our meal showed up.  The burgers were supposed to be medium rare -- they were cold and well done --mine was thinner that a McDs burger..  I was supposed to have cheese, no bacon.  I got bacon, no cheese.  My girlfriend's potatoes did not show up with her order.  By this time I was running late for my flight so we didn't have time to replace our order.  I nibbled on a few fries, my girlfriend ate a few bites of her burger.  We paid for the beers.  And had to run to the airport.  I just made my flight and had nothing to eat.  All in all, a very miserable experience."
Leticia D.,"Glendale, CA",1762,726,226,3.0,4/2/2013,Mojito and pizza mood  is what i was in for when i went to this place...tv playing sports bar and loud noise all around and people enjoying drinks so its a young crowd but i really didn't pick this place so i wasn't there to eat dinner just enjoy a quick meal and drinks...i haven't been back to this place in a while...
Diana V.,"Woodland Hills, CA",899,221,51,4.0,3/8/2011,"I was here on Sunday with a very close friend of mine for a lovely lunch date. We didn't want to over due it so we decided on getting the special Gourmet Mac & Cheese. Oh Goodness! It was Delicious. It was the perfect portion and it came with 2 strips of crunchy Garlic bread. Also came with a side of House Salad. It was just perfect. The Gourmet Mac & Cheese had the right amount of cheeses, crispy bacon bits and crunchy bits of bread. I enjoyed every single bite. Customer service was on point and pleasant. Cudos to our waiter Brandon who would stop on by and ask if everything was OK every 5 minutes:) I wish I had a Pizookie after this but I was way too full from this delicious meal.  Will be back for sure! :)"
Adam D.,"Modesto, CA",12,85,28,4.0,1/30/2014,Came here for just alcohol. Had a lot of drinks and they seemed to be done fine. Heard no complaints from the party I was with. Bartenders did a good job in getting the drinks out fast.
Kaitlyn R.,"Burbank, CA",94,1,,1.0,1/5/2013,"Piss poor and pitiful service by Brandon. Not only was he MIA for most of the time, but our entrees came out almost right after our appetizers. Drinks were not filled unless asked. He only asked two of our party of six if we wanted boxes, and finally brought the check BEFORE WE EVEN GOT OUR DESSERTS!!!  The kitchen wasn't much better. Our party ordered two medium burgers and they came out well done TWICE. I finally just gave up because obviously they don't know what a medium burger looks like. Terrible. Will not be coming back and I suggest you do the same."
