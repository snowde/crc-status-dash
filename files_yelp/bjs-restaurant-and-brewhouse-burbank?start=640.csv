Crystal L.,"Granada Hills, CA",52,49,180,5.0,1/27/2011,"I'm so glad Girly Adventure Day with Kaye A. ended with a Pizookie Trio and Strawberry Splashes! Happy Hour bar service was amazing! You know service was good when they bring the bill and you're excited to pay because you want to reward them with a good tip.  What goes around, comes around."
Fred B.,"Glendale, CA",507,122,,2.0,10/6/2011,Service?  Hello?  Anyone care???? Went here for a quick Lunch...  Cheese Sticks  Medium Pizza  Salad  Pizzookie  Total before tip?  $59.
Melanie K.,"Glendale, CA",20,86,3,4.0,10/6/2013,"Yummmmmy! I've been to Bj's many many times, but not too much at this location, we came today for lunch with a group of friends and I must say this ones probably my favorite. I ordered the Harvest Hefeweizen.. AMAZING! It's a Brewhouse so obviously it's fresh beer which makes it a million times better. If you haven't tried a Hefe, your missing out. I also ordered a Crispy Jalepeno Burger and have it split to share with my boyfriend. They first brought us back half a slice with a full order of fries (apparently the other slice fell on the way to the table) so they brought us a whole new one with a full order of fries on the house! It was so nice to have it offered to us without even asking, I honestly wouldn't have made it an issue. Great service, great location.. they offer valet also for a cheap price. There is another Bj's around the neighborhood on Brand ave. but I would suggest coming here.. it's bigger and the service is better :)"
Marie D.,"Seattle, WA",17,147,,3.0,3/26/2014,Nothing special.  Was able to accommodate a huge party which was good but the wait was long.  Great bar area and right off the freeway.  It just sucks that you have to pay for valet.  Why can't I just self park for free?!
Guillermo M.,"Diamond Bar, CA",152,62,19,1.0,4/7/2013,"Service was so-so. Had to wait to be attended to at the front counter... and wait... and wait.  not enough silverware at the table so had to wait for that.  I ask for the steak well done... not burned, hard, and cold. baked potato was cold. veggies were so so. By the time we left it was 8pm and the place was jammed... and i don't see why... i was not impressed. Won't be going there again."
Izzy M.,"Glendale, CA",8,37,4,1.0,1/18/2013,"Went here for a birthday today. Waiter was aweful, he had a nasty attitude from the begining. Couldnt help with the menu and had no suggestions to give. Who hired him? Too bad I didnt get his name. I later got my chicken marsala dish, and the photo had mushrooms in it. I asked him why my dish doesnt have mushrooms and he said because its in the sauce. Umm then why is it showing in the photo on the menu? So in a RUDE way, he said ""do you want mushrooms?"" I said well i wanted it cooked with my meal, not on the side what the heck am I gna do with a side of blan mushrooms. Then again with an attitude and rolling his eyes looking annoyed he asked if ""I want mushrooms or not."" VEEEEEEEERY rude considering it is not my fault the maker of the menu included mushrooms in the dish. He completely forgot about our table of 10, never got refils nothing. And we were later charged with a $22 tip he did not deserve. If anything we should have gotten a comp for his nasty attitude. Cant remember his name he was a pretty white boy with nice skin. Definitely NEVER going back again."

Hector A.,"Sylmar, CA",134,132,19,3.0,12/17/2014,"like previously mentioned, my ratings are 2/3 based on customer service and the first thing i encountered while asking for a table was a an extremely rude women at the front desk and a TERRIBLE host and waiter. left alone without any drinks for a legitimate 20 minutes BUT after that, food we ordered came out delicious and faster than ever experienced and our waiter was replaced with someone a lot more personable."
Vntg C.,"Sunland-Tujunga, CA",22,3,,5.0,3/15/2015,"I rarely rate, only when great or absolutely horrible... Shannon S. was our waitress and she was GREAT! Very funny, very quick, and professional, so much so that we even spoke with her manager before we left! Thanks you for the great service and hope you're getting big tips!!"
Nora F.,"San Diego, CA",405,235,45,2.0,1/16/2013,I go here because I love the pizza and of course the beer is great.  This BJ's in specific makes me not want to go to BJ's anymore.
Gil G.,"Burbank, CA",0,57,,1.0,2/14/2014,"Never again. I ordered the broccoli cheddar soup. I kept finding chunks of inedible... stuff in there. I tried to eat around it (because I was hungry). Finally, there was a big enough piece so that I could examine it. It looked to be wood. I found several other chunks in there as well. Waited FOREVER for the waitress to come by so I could say something. Someone else brought my entree (and, at that point, I didn't really feel comfortable eating it), so it wasn't until the end of the (uneaten) meal when she came by. I told her about the wood in my soup. She PICKED UP THE WOOD with her bare fingers and closely examined it. Pulled it apart to look at the fibers, ran her fingers over it, etc... Again, it had been in my mouth. Then she declared it wasn't wood and that it was probably part of an artichoke that had fallen in the soup. I eat artichokes all the time, and it wasn't that (and it was all throughout the soup), but whatever. I waited her for her apologize and offer $$ off the bill or something. Nope. No apology. She didn't even take the price of the soup off. I was furious but didn't want to ruin my date by bitching about it, so we just paid & left. Never ever again. The next week, I went to a similar, but different restaurant in Burbank. My husband's spoon had a weird sharp ridge on it, so he mentioned it to the waiter (I know it sounds like we go to restaurants and bitch a lot... but we really don't!). The waiter brought him another spoon. Later, the manager came over and was SUPER nice! Very apologetic (even though we assured him it wasn't a huge deal), brought us free dessert, and then took 50% off our check! All without us asking! We WILL be returning to that restaurant."
Kim l.,"Santa Clara, CA",595,1236,897,3.0,10/24/2011,3.5 stars for the food Hawaiian aka sweet pig is ok. The bbq chicken is good. Thick crust pizzas. Hits the spot. If you can't find parking in the self parking area on the second floor of the structure just park a block away in one of the free lots or find street parking. The valet girl was not helpful at all.
trinka g.,"Glendale, CA",14,25,,5.0,10/1/2011,"We have been searching for a decent gluten free pizza and beer house- and we found it here! The crust was delectable and the toppings were many, and the Red Bridge beer was awesome! I felt like one of the football watching crew and not left in the dark for food and good times!   Thank You, BJ's"
Ethan B.,"Riverside, CA",85,28,5,4.0,1/6/2014,"Good food, Server was not very helpful and constantly had to wave her down to get something.  Over all good place to chek out"
Elle I.,"Glendale, CA",8,15,3,5.0,1/6/2015,"So I came to BJ's for my Mom's birthday today just the two of us...wanted to treat my mom. Anyways, we ordered the Lemon-thyme chicken, which came with an ample amount of veggies and rice which bedded the delicious lemon-herb chicken breast. The good was great as always, but I'm reviewing more for the customer service. Our waiter's name was Charlie, and he was the best waiter I've had in a very long time at BJ's. Charlie was very courteous, accommodating, and friendly! Somebody needs to make this guy employee of the month or something--seriously. I hadn't been to the Burbank BJ's in a very long time due to a past negative experience, but I'm so glad we went in today. The only thing I thought was kinda weird was the mandatory valet parking--I don't like leaving my keys with anybody. That's just me. I really don't think it was necessary to have a valet, when there was a plethora of parking spots available. Anyways, I'm sure anybody who comes to this BJ's and has Charlie as a waiter can agree with my comments. Thank you Charlie!!!!!! :)"
Stephen P.,"Los Angeles, CA",154,1103,2803,3.0,1/17/2009,"2.5 stars - it seems harsh, but this place was barely A-OK (3-stars) on my visit...hmmm, ok I'm gonna round it up... I treated my colleague to lunch since the co. told her that her temp position wouldn't be there at the end of the month. Sad. So she ordered a pint of Piranha and a lunch special grilled chicken pasta with a side salad. I got the fish and chips (with a choice of fries or wedges) and an Arnold Palmer (why is the drink named after a golf pro?) Looking at my colleague's pasta it looked a little unloved. I didn't try it as my fish and chips arrived. The cod came in nugget-sized pieces, but one of them was grey instead of white like cod is meant to be. And the greyness had a watery consistency. Probably a bad bit of frozen fish. It happens. But then comes the condiment incident.  Sarson's malt vinegar was a ""wow"" for me. But only at BJ's is the sprinkler cap missing (mine at home has a sprinker.) So, I go and sprinkle, but it turns into a pour, pour, pour malt vinegar all over the potato wedges which proceed to soak it all up :( Bollocks!  The best thing is the free parking, the patio to enjoy the 75F temp on a balmy SoCal January weekday."
Larae H.,"Simi Valley, CA",41,120,20,3.0,12/2/2011,"So I came here with a few friends on a Saturday night for dinner.  We ordered the spinach-artichoke dip as an appetizer which came with colored tortilla chips & was very good. I ordered a wildberry mojito (definitely recommed trying one) and a garden medley salad for dinner. It looked really small compared to my friends BBQ chicken salad. And when her pizza came out, it was the wrong one.  Overall I like this place. It's a good family restaurant. But if you're on a diet, definitely go somewhere else. I was totally shocked by the calorie content in some of the food. I mean my salad alone was 500+ calories, for a SALAD! But it is a good place to come, try a few different beers and watch the game."
Arbi G.,"Glendale, CA",333,230,81,3.0,12/29/2013,"First time visiting, food's not bad, service needs attention, specially when you order food and you do not get the condiments you order. You wait and look at your food and wait and wait. Food gets cold, does not taste right, so need improvement."
President Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,4.0,2/22/2014,BJs is not too bad. They got plenty of TV's to watch the sports. The food is pretty good. The best thing about BJs is the beer. They have an awesome selection.
Vvn W.,"Van Nuys, CA",63,546,30,2.0,1/23/2011,"I typically like BJ's; they have fun fabulous food and a lively dining atmosphere.  Great for a lunch or dinner crowd, BJ's offers a rather huge menu of all types of foods and a variety of brew ha-has.  There's something for everyone. This particular BJ's is somewhat disappointing.  For one thing, the only parking the restaurant has is valet  If you want to park in the restaurant's parking lot, it'll cost $3.50 plus tips for the valet parker.  Most folks find nearby street parking to avoid this expense. Secondly the usual quick lunchtime service was unusually slow.  For awhile we waited for the server to show up to take our order and then the fun begins: waiting over 20 minutes for food to arrive.  I ordered the quite bland Pesto and Chicken thin crusted pizza which was served on the cold side.  I had the server reheat it which took another 10 minutes.  If I were to wait 20+ minutes for food, it should come to the table piping hot. Sorry but this BJ's didn't make the cut...."
