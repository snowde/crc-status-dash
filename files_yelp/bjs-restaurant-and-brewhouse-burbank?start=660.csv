Kevin C.,"Irvine, CA",5,27,2,1.0,12/2/2012,"Service was horrible. My girlfriend and I were seated and did not receive any service for more than 10 minutes. Annoyed by the lack of service, we thought we would try our luck in the bar area....boy were we mistaken. We sat for another 10 minutes and had to flag down a waiter who didn't even work in the section. Once we finally ordered and received our food, my girlfriend's burger came out charred on the outside and raw on the inside.  After sending the raw burger back to the kitchen, no manger came to apologize for the inconvenience. I ordered something simple, a pizza, but it came out extremely dry. Needless to say, we were completely disappointed with our experience and walked out with made up minds that we will not be returning to this location."
Kristen C.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",112,81,61,5.0,10/11/2011,"This review is long over due! I LOVE this restaurant, but the service is what puts it over the top. Maura Mitchell was our waitress, and she could not have been nicer! While I am almost an expert on the menu, I couldn't decide what I wanted and she suggested a Summer Special that was a Medium Pizza and a Pazookie for like $20! Which was MORE than enough for my friend and I, who are total foodies.  I can't say enough great things about the great service we received, or the always delicious food!  ps.. this review really is long over due.. Can't remember the exact price.. But it was still an excellent deal. =)"
Tom N.,"Cypress, CA",11,35,1,2.0,12/1/2012,"I've been to this BJ's numerous times, because the location was just so convenient for a drink with friends. The more I go, the less I'm impressed. The last time I was there was maybe a week ago. We got a pitcher of the Nutty Brewnette (if you like New Castle), this is the one you should go for). I wanted some fries and some chicken fingers, which is only on the lunch menu. They were nice enough to accommodate it, but when this order came....it was like warm. Like it's been sitting on the counter. So I asked if I can have it fresh and the next order was hot on the ouside, but hard/warm in the inside (like it wasn't cooked through). I didn't want them to spit in my food so I just decided to shut up from this point on. We also ordered the blackened chicken cajun pasta. The garlic bread is not a bread. It's a huge crouton.  The visit before this was worse in the summer when we sat outside. The server completely forgot about us. We ordered Martini's, appetizers, and the main dish (it was jut two of us). The main dish came. I was in shock, because we didn't have our drinks or utensils....and then the appetizers arrived, and then our Martini's. During this time, I continued to ask for utensils until I stood up to go ask and pick it up myself. I never get upset or complain, but I had to say something. I said, I normally would like my Martini and appetizers first before my main dish. The server's excuse was that it wasn't his shift and he was forced to cover....I just kind of sat there listening to him complain thinking....so what does this have to do with me and how are you going to fix it? He didn't care and it really upset me so I had to tell the manager. The manager just said he'll give us one of the dishes on the house in the attitude like as if he's saying, ""are you happy now?"" I feel like the food and service gets worse every time I visit this location. The Woodland Hills location does a better job."
A H.,"Vacaville, CA",0,67,10,3.0,1/10/2014,"I would say this was okay.  My husband and daughter ordered burgers and found them to be average to below average. My husband said the kind of beer they had was not very good either.  I ordered an Ahi Salad which I thought was delicious although the fish had ALOT of sinew in it which I have never experienced with Ahi before.  I did have some special requirements for my food with allergies and they did all of that correctly.  Our waiter was okay, parking was free although you had to walk up/down a set of stairs to get to the restaurant."
Alex M.,"Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/24/2013,Worst chain restaurant in Burbank.  Hands down. The food is truly disgusting and the staff does not have their act together.
Pearl V.,"Culver City, CA",5,13,,1.0,1/19/2013,"Never going back to this location ever. Our server's attitude was terrible from the start. Then, our food took forever. Our server went on his break and the new server was terrible too. When our food finally came out, it was cold. When we flagged down a MANAGER she couldn't have cared less! Yes she took my plate to ""fix it"" but she also didn't apologize once and kind of just shrugged her shoulders! Then, she never once came back to check on us. Also, I ordered my steak medium, and it came back to me well done after they heated up the food. Overall just terrible service. We expected at least the manager to care and be more apologetic but nope! Awful."
Shelby S.,"Burbank, CA",173,25,,3.0,11/17/2013,This place can be hit or miss depending on how busy they are and who is cooking. I've had better luck dining in rather than take out. They usually mess up the take out orders. Especially if it's later at night. Their pizzas are really good and I like the atmosphere.
Eugene G.,"Los Angeles, CA",40,130,6,2.0,9/21/2013,"Went on a Saturday and it was miserable. The service was slow, the receptionist looked annoyed and the food was sub-par. I would give it a one star if it wasn't for the extensive beer selection and TV at every angle."
David P.,"Los Angeles, CA",127,21,4,5.0,4/9/2011,"This restaurant (location, anyway) has some of the best service I have ever received every time I go. I remember once a few years ago we ordered some steaks and because the kitchen kept over or undercooking the steak (before we ever received it -- they wouldn't bring it out incorrectly) the manager came and apologized without us ever uttering a word. He gave us all free desserts and it was awesome Aother time a few weeks ago, my fiancé and I went and although it was packed on a Friday nig, they told us we could sit on the heated patio ring away. We went and there was always a different server, runner, busboy, etc making sure our heater was working well. O top of that, they had gluten-free pizza (for this crazy diet I am on) and a tomato and mozzarella salad that were both to die for. SO GOOD! This time tonight, it was a little chilly so we opted to wait the 25 minutes for an indoor table. Wile we were waiting, the manager and a server came out with some pre-sliced pizza for everyone waiting. Wo has ever heard of such a thing?!  Amazingly great service. Also, our waiter noticed out iPad and stopped to talk to us about his favorite apps, etc.  This is no fluke here, this location is well managed. If you steer clear because of it's chain-restaurant stigma, fret-not. This place is the reason the chain exists. Well done!"
Dave K.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,27,,3.0,3/31/2014,I go to BJ's about once or twice a month for lunch.  The staff is usually very friendly and prompt although I go early.  Once it gets crowded the it seems they are understaffed.  The portions are usually pretty generous and the beer is good.  Plenty of TV's to watch multiple games at the same time is always a plus. Valet parking is typical for LA - completely unnecessary.  Why is it necessary to have valet with the lot and garage right there?!
Laura D.,"Burbank, CA",77,23,,4.0,12/21/2010,I've been here a number of times and it's always been consistent on the food and service. I love their sante fe salad with grilled shrimp. I honestly have a hard time ordering anything else.  It's one of those places that can be fun on game day or you can choose to be put back in a quieter corner. We've have good size groups and have had no problem getting seated. Overall it's a decent place to eat!
Robert M.,"Glendale, CA",303,112,54,2.0,11/9/2010,"Not a big fan of the Glendale BJ's. Go to the Burbank one, much better. Wait times on busy days are terrible, parking situation is worse and for some reason food quality is worse than the Burbank, CA BJ's.   I do not think i have been there once and been happy with the service we've gotten.  I'm not sure why that is but something has to change! I haven't been there in a while and probably wont go back unless i'm dragged their by friends."
Nicole R.,"Tujunga, CA",74,40,80,5.0,8/8/2013,"Once before me and my boyfriend had gone to the one in Valencia for a night out. We loved the deep dish pizza. So when we saw that there was one in Burbank we had to try it. So we went in and we were greeted by the kind lady at the service desk. Then our waiter promptly arrived to seat us. We got seated close to the bar which is fine because it was far from the kitchen. The sound level can be a little noisy but that is to be expected at a place such as this one. So really it was no biggie! Next here comes our waiter, he asks us if we would like to order some drinks to start. seeing as we don't drink we ordered a coke and a sprite with no ice, about 5 sec. Later here comes out waiter with the drinks. He then says he will give us some time to look over the menu. We were seated about 5-10 minutes before our waiter came over and asked us if we were ready to order which we were. We ended up getting a small pepperoni and sausage deep dish pizza and a side of chicken strips. Surprisingly the order arrived very quickly and was very hot. Also the food we got was just the right amount for us (2 people). So we began to chow down and our waiter comes over about 2 different times and asks how our food is. The food was really good. The pizza though is the topping on the cake, it is so delicious and piping hot I might add. So when we were finished it was almost like our waiter was watching us, because he came over and took our plates from us and offered dessert but we declined as we were going up the street to Yogurtland! Then before he got away we asked him if we could please have our check and he handed it to us. Our total was right around $27.00 which is not bad if you think about it. We got a small pizza 2 drinks and like 6 chicken strips...not bad I would say and it definitely filled us up. Our service and food was great and would definitely come back for more. Thanks Bj's."
CSC M.,"Burbank, CA",11,139,1,2.0,11/17/2012,"I was confused by our experience at this Burbank BJ's, because our experiences at the locations in Pasadena and Palmdale have always been excellent. The staff is definitely friendly and apologetic, and we had a manager taking care of us after a multitude of issues happened, but overall it's not a location we will go back to."
Vrezh G.,"Valley Glen, CA",74,31,4,5.0,11/10/2013,Great customer service !! Me and my gf just went for dessert and it took alittle long for our pizookie to come out.. not so long that we complained but noticeably longer than usual.. we finishing eatting our pizookie which was perfect and the manager came by to inform us that he was sorry for the wait on our dessert .. that he covered the bill and also gave us a gift card for $10 for our next visit! Never see stuff like this anymore..im amazed by the service
Dylan B.,"Fresno, CA",20,23,3,5.0,5/2/2013,"I felt compelled to leave a glowing review for our waitress, Rebecca (it says Rebecca 30 on the receipt).  She was a shining example of an excellent waitress.  Our food was awesome, too.  Thanks Rebecca!"
Kevin A.,"North Hollywood, CA",0,26,,1.0,12/31/2014,"Food arrived 45 minutes later and cold!  When our waitress said ""careful hot plate"" we thought the plate was actually hot. Not so. When they offered to remake the food it returned warmed up Not remade!  Ruined my evening."
Amanda C.,"Winnetka, CA",35,41,16,4.0,4/10/2013,"Went there Friday night. Enjoyed sitting outdoors on a cool late night, delicious beers and deep dish pizza. Had to get the pizzookie of course. Our waitress handed my date her number when he went to the mens room. That provided us with a laugh the rest of the night!"
Cindy N.,"North Hollywood, CA",70,113,117,3.0,7/17/2011,"Alrighty! So I tried their  new ""Grilled Steak Salad"" and I have to say it was pretty good! The waitress that we had was really great and always on her task! Recommend that salad! && of course I RECOMMEND a PAZZOOKIII!! To anyone and everyone who goes to BJ's!"
Barbara M.,"Los Angeles, CA",66,85,12,3.0,8/3/2013,Came here to watch basketball finals! it was perfect had some steak and drinks and enjoyed the game at the same time!
