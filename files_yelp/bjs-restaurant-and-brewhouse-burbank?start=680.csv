Letty B.,"Sylmar, CA",11,78,6,1.0,7/8/2012,"FOOD POISONING.    FOOD POISONING.    FOOD POISONING. My friend and I both got food poisoning from this place last night. He ordered the meat lovers pizza and I ordered the BJ's favorite pizza. I don't know if the pizzas were undercooked or their refrigeration is inadequate or they have poor sanitation. I just know that every time I think I'm done with the toilet, I have to run back to use it again. On the plus side, I think I lost weight overnight."
Garin V.,"Tujunga, CA",0,5,,1.0,3/8/2013,"Came in on a Thursday night with my two cousins. Had a pretty bad experience with the food. - First, the nachos we ordered had a long hair in it. It was baked right into the cheese. The chips were soggy and it looked like it was sitting around. - My cousin had ordered the chicken plate. The chicken was also soggy. - My other cousin ordered the lamb chops which came out cold and also had soggy bean sprouts. - I ordered the chili cheeseburger with fries. Pretty much everything on my plate was soggy. Fries didn't taste good and the bun was a liquid mush. Won't be going back here again..."
Sahina K.,"Los Angeles, CA",37,114,,4.0,9/24/2011,"They're doing this 2 for $20 deal that is amazing! 2 salads or soup, a medium pizza, and a pazookie!  So good! We ordered the mushroom and balsamic onion pizza!  We got the white chocolate macadamia nut pazookie!   What a good deal!"
Michelle P.,"Los Angeles, CA",677,593,1665,3.0,7/1/2008,"Overall a 3 star from me, but based on the cookie pizookie thingy - oh yum -  5 star.  If you just want to chill, watch a game, have some drinks, this is a decent place.  I like the large bar area.  But, if you want to go somewhere just for a dessert, wowzie!   I had a french connection, which was made well.  But, when I asked for a Godfather, the bartender didn't know how to make it.  Boo!  However, this place has a nice selection of brews if you like beer. And, if you like pizza, they have great build it yourself option.  Just a little on the pricey side."
ELeen A.,"Glendale, CA",16,4,,1.0,12/29/2013,This place has the worst service. Bad management and crappy food. found a cockroach on our table and they did not even offer to give us a refund.
Vy N.,"Burbank, CA",58,61,8,3.0,5/26/2013,"Food here is your average chain restaurant food, good, reasonably price and atmosphere moderately loud and and very spacious, however on one occasion I left my credit card here accidentally after paying and called to speak with the manager a couple of days later and was put on hold so decided ill head over.... It was a 12 min drive.... Arrived and went to the front desk... Unfortunately the manager was still busy on the other line... I'm waiting and waiting.....and no manager to be found. The receptionist can't do anything and only the manger has access.  Its a busy evening and instead of being on the floor supervising and overseeing dinner service at the busiest time of the evening, the manger is apparently on the phone.  I wasn't very please to wait for over 35 minutes to get my card.  Yes it's my fault for leaving my card in the first place, but waiting for a total of 47 minutes to get my credit card is pretty ridiculous.  Customer first, phone call to corporate, etc can take a minute break."
Jamie C.,"Lubbock, TX",2,32,3,2.0,8/30/2014,"It started out so well.  It was 3 pm and we were seated right away, our waitress seems attentive and got our drinks and took our order within 5 minutes or so. Then everything went downhill.  We don't see our waitress for 30 minutes. The salad my husband ordered finally appears at 3:35, brought out by someone other than our waitress.  Baby is starting to get fussy now and a quick afternoon bite is turning ugly fast.  We get water and soda refills at 3:45. Realizing this just isn't going to work, 50 minutes after arriving, we ask to have our order to go.  An hour after sitting down, we now have our food.  Sure, the service was slow, but at least we have our food.  We get home, get the baby settled down for a nap, and go to finally eat. *sigh* the disappointment continues. My burger is over cooked and missing the grilled onions advertised on the menu.  Well at least my husband's wings were...oh wait...it was missing the dipping sauce.  Oh BJ's, what happened?!?! Why are you so bad?!?!"
Patricia W.,"Burbank, Los Angeles, CA",6,2,,1.0,10/19/2013,"While the food was good, the service was awful. We asked the waitress to spilt the check and at the end of the night she said she forgot and we had to say what we ordered again. Also, we ordered our pizookies at 7:00 we got them at 8:30!!! That's just ridiculous!"
Joey G.,"NORTH HOLLYWOOD, CA",122,19,10,1.0,7/15/2013,"Went with a party of 7 (3 kids) last night. After waiting 20 minutes for a table while easily 1/3rd of the tables were empty we were sat a table next to kitchen on the wall opposite this dishwasher... The table was one that was so ... oddly designed, and the noise from the kitchen so loud one could only talk to the person next to them. We ordered and the dinner was timely and the food good.   We opted for dessert. 10 minutes after we ordered dessert the waiter brings our check and tells us he'll take it when we're ready.  This strikes us (3 of us in the restaurant business) odd. Another 5 or so minutes go by the waiter comes to clear a few more plates and ask if we are ready to pay the bill.  my friend comments, no, we haven't even had received dessert yet. Waiters says oh while I was just trying to move things along. You want your dessert first? Friend says yes please and can we have some extra cherries for my daughters sundae? Waiter says yes... Few minutes later dessert comes. I've ordered this a few times before and this one was not the same 2 pazookie trios & 2 kids sundaes all come with no whip cream (who serves a sundae w/no whip cream?). Waiter sets our desserts down & describes them at which time we pay the bill. $120 tab to which we five him $150. 25% tip. Waiter bring back the cc slips sets them on the table walks away without a word. 10 minutes later I flag him down for a to-go box, again sets it on the table, not a word. We pack up and walk out passing the host desk to which I pay close attention to see if they provide a salutation (cuz by now I'm irked)... The girl at the desk never looks up from her computer as the 7 of us way by but mutters thanks, goodnight...) The cherry on top??? Bot only did the sundae no have one we never even received the extra cherries we asked for.... Service my friends... Is a lost art..."
Gem S.,"North Hills, Los Angeles, CA",226,387,125,4.0,5/14/2013,"In general, I enjoy BJ's.  I like their food, desserts, and drinks.  Most of the time, I split a customized pizza with the boyfriend then delve into a sinful pizookie thereafter.  It's not the most romantic spot, as it can be pretty loud, but it's a fun spot to gather with family and friends.  There are a ton of TVs so often times, the loudness originates from the patrons catching a game."
Jeff C.,"Orem, UT",115,230,37,3.0,4/8/2013,Average food and drinks. It's a sports bar so can be crowded when there's a big game on. My Burger was burnt and was average. The service was average. The waitress we had missed not getting a bigger tip my not bringing us our change back. Overall I'd say we had a OK experience with OK food.
Ara K.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,31,7,2.0,11/27/2012,Eh. I've had worse. But the hostess thinks she's working as a door girl at a hot night club. Servers could pretend a little harder that they care. Not worth it.
Dr. Heath U.,"Redondo Beach, CA",6,82,1,2.0,12/9/2013,"There is nothing special with the food.  It tastes like it was mass produced in a factory in Mexico.  I had a pizza, it was made incorrectly.  The pizza could have been a frozen one from the supermarket and wouldn't have been able to tell.  Chicken in the pasta had blood dots in it still.  Clearly undercooked, thank god we didn't get sick.  Service was typical, no personality, she made all the stupid suggestions, offered us a dessert that we didn't want, thanked us for coming in.  I think i would prefer having a robot serve me than a typical corporate restaurant server.  Don't come here expecting anything other than putting food in your mouth and leaving."
Nancy B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,1.0,2/16/2015,"unhappy valentine""s day my family and i went to bjs in burbank for valentines dinner. what a bad choice. we only waited 10 mins to get a table but the service was horrible. i had to wait 15 mins to get a refill on my pepsi. she kept coming to the table saying oh yes your refill oh yes your refill. she came by 3 times but never refilled it. when the server brought our food he asked can i get anything else for you. i asked for steak sauce, parmesan cheese and a spoon. he never brought it. i asked the waitress she managed to bring the steak sauce.i asked for a pizookie but the wait was too long i asked her to cancel it. she said oh we are soo busy tonight, yet she was standing at her computer most of the time. at this point if i needed anything i just got up from my chair and walked over to her. she brought the pizookie as were leaving saying its free. forget it. dinner was ruined."
Sandy S.,"Arleta, CA",98,248,542,4.0,5/1/2011,"I had the Sesame Chicken Salad, Chicken Pesto Flatbread, Glazed Caramelized Chicken, and the Pazookie. My other friends had ordered the Cheese deep dish pizza and the fires and it cam out way before our dishes. So we waited patiently for our food to come. When it finally came, it was delicious and flavorful but I have to say I waited a LONG time for the food (and so did my friends at the whole table). I was a little disappointed that it took a long time and some of the food was already cold. I also waited a good 30 minutes for the pazookie and the kids at my table were falling asleep."
John E.,"West Covina, CA",0,8,,1.0,12/21/2014,"Me and my wife came in on a Sunday afternoon. The hostess sat us down and we waited for our server. We waited 10 before I initiated a conversation to another waiter on how long the wait would be (after we sat at our table). We waited another 10 minutes, and still nobody had came by. The server staff/service is poor. ** mind you this is the first time we've ever walked out on a restaurant. I'm still hesitant to give it 1star."
Luke W.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",1034,975,1519,4.0,10/12/2008,"So we show up around 10:30pm, which is usually the wrong time to show up to a resturant around town as most places are looking to close down around 11pm.  Well....not BJ's. I was hanging out with some friends and we wanted a place for some good beer and food.  BJ's was recommended.  Wow. What a cool menu.  Too bad I had eaten dinner a around 7pm.  I could have had a field day with their sandwiches and and various grilled BBQ'q items. But alas, I had to try something.  So I went for the $8.95 Nachos. Wow.  I can usually put away some nachos and beer, but I barely made it halfway through. I had a few different beers.  All excellent. My friends had the most amazing looking pizza. And it wasn't until about 1am that we were told last drink and food orders needed to be places.  Too cool. Nice service, friends waiters, good food, great beer. A chain?  Yes.  but who cares when its really good? I am a fan and will be back. Check it out.  Lunch, dinner, or just some good drinks.  Though I don't drink mixed drinks, they had a good selection and it can serve quite a varied palate of drink and food desires. Check it out. Can't wait to go back."
Dorothy L.,"Los Angeles, CA",849,422,753,4.0,8/30/2010,"I love beer, but I just cannot seem to like any of the BJ's brews... I try, and try, and tryyy to like even the blonde, or the red, but they're just not wonderful. BUT BJ's may have the best happy hour food of all time. That is the sole reason it is a staple happy hour place for me and my sports-loving boyfriend. We love to stake out spots during NBA Finals or MNF or just a regular old Wednesday after work. We think BJ's has the best chicken wings around. To accompany those amazing wings, we vary between a mini favorite pizza, nachos, or my new fav on HH - pork sliders. (You GOTTA try those - with the pulled pork and onion ring strings... OOH WEE!) I also love that their HH goes until 7:00 p.m. weekdays. It can get pretty crowded sometimes, but just try to get there ASAP before 7, and you should have a wonderful experience!"
Scott R.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",3,93,29,3.0,5/20/2013,"Had chilli and a salad - salad was plain no biggie. The chilli was good, nice kick but would have been nice to have some bread . Server was good for our party of 6, she kept asking me if I want more salad and chilli, she might want to have explained to me it was included, I had no clue. The light shades over our table were filthy, dust was caked all around, might want to clean a bit!!!"
Nicholas B.,"Pomona, CA",101,233,38,3.0,3/27/2013,"Its a BJ's If you have been to one you have been to them all. There really isn't anything too special about this place. The service was good, there is a lot of seating, and the wait is long."
