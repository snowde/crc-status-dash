Daniel L. d.,"San Leandro, CA",127,26,23,5.0,1/24/2011,"One luv!!! 5 Orales One of the best time ever. Came to vist my brother from the San Fransisco. We walked in to the bar. There was only one seat at the bar. I jumped in it to wait around for more seats, there was 3 of us.  The couple next to us told us they will move down so we had 2 seats. After we order our drinks the bartender came around and brought another seat for my brother. Front row in the middle at the bar with 6 tv screens to watch. COuld not ask for a better time. BJ brownie is OFF THE CHAIN."
Ryan C.,"Los Angeles, CA",31,33,,2.0,7/23/2013,"Our server was overly chatty. Good at his job but we felt awkward at times. We ordered three appetizers and were unimpressed with all of them. The sauce in the avocado roles was watered down, the calamari was lukewarm and soggy, and the shrimp rolls were not anything special at all. Not worth the calories or money, I'm not ready to rule out BJ's quite yet as I've enjoyed their chain in the past just not sure if I'll try the one in Burbank again."
Bea B.,"Burbank, CA",52,53,12,3.0,5/14/2011,"Went here with a big group for lunch to watch the Celtics/Heat game on a Sunday.  Crowd was alright. They were pretty nice considering our group was the loudest. Half Celtics-Half Heat. They don't turn up the volume for the game though, but it's cool you don't  really need to hear the commentators. Food was meh. They have Stella Artois which pleased me but no Blue Moon. Parking: I'm not sure why there's a need for valet but I'm not going to avail of that for $5. I can park my car in the structure and walk two flights of stairs."
Lyndsey P.,"Burbank, CA",2,15,2,5.0,6/22/2012,"One of my absolute fav places to go, if not my fav. Very hard to get into on a game night. Couldn't get a seat until around 10 PM but it is still worth it. They are always busy, so if you want immediate seating it's best to go at odd hours or later in the evening, or bring something to read or do while you wait. The whole menu has great food options, I haven't had a dish I don't like."
Iska B.,"Los Angeles, CA",153,521,35,4.0,3/4/2011,"Not at all bad for a chain! Seriously! Maybe it's just my memory of the  beer sampler talking, but I genuinely enjoyed myself here! If you like beer, it is absolutely worth a try, even if you're a big food snob and you never go to chains.They brew their own beer and the samplers are very fun and quite good. There is sure to be one you'll want to try and they're generous with their sample sizes too (think cups not shot glasses). I went for the wheat beer sampler but there are many more to choose from or else just get a pitcher of your favorite brew.  I did actually eat something (ha) and that was quite nice as well. I ended up going with the Italian Market Salad which was really big and they didn't skimp on the ingredients. I loathe when a restaurant serves me a salad and it's mostly iceberg lettuce with one tomato and one olive. Not so here. This is a great and filling salad that tasted really fresh and was covered in delicious olives and fresh mozzarella cheese plus artichokes and other veggies. I found it to be very filling which was also a pleasant surprise. Despite all this food and beer there was also room left for dessert so we gave their infamous ""Pizookie"" a try. Stupid as the name is, this thing is quite tasty. It's basically a freshly baked cookie sitting in a deep dish like a pizza and topped with ice cream. It's deliciously soft (I HATE hard baked cookies) to boot. You can't go wrong with this thing. Trust me. All in all this is a satisfying chain restaurant. I'm definitely liking it a lot more than other similar counterparts (Chilis, TGIFriday's etc.) and I'd definitely come back to try more beers."
Sean S.,"Burbank, CA",23,11,15,4.0,3/11/2015,"Everyone knows BJ's is an excellent place to go grab a drink and enjoy some delicious food that is both crafted well and not to expensive but i will tell you why I am only giving 4 stars. I was seated in the late afternoon with two other friends a couple of days ago and granted we sat in the patio (always a difficult place for servers to get food out on time) my deep dish vegetarian pizza and chicken alfredo pasta came out kind of cold. Again i completely understand given where i was seated and the fact that the server was so sweet and dealing with other customers that were spaced out is why i think 4 stars is fair.I HAVE to reiterate how good this girl was, i wish i could remember her name so i could ask for her next time i come in! In conclusion i enjoyed my meal, the steak that my friend got was also delicious and not cold whatsoever (medium rare i might add) but yes i would recommend anyone to go to BJ's in burbank if they never have (which honestly i would not understand why someone needs to read this review to understand how good BJ'S is)  overall awesome experience and cant wait till i am old enough to enjoy the drinks they have available (and maybe not sit at the patio) last but not least PAZOOKI FOR THE WIN if you don't know what that is.......then i give up hahah"
Bernadette S.,"Covina, CA",63,4,,1.0,4/20/2012,"Haven't been here in a long time, last time we had the worst service.  Decided to give it a try 1 more time because we love the food but once again we got crappy service.  The waiter has a really bad attitude, he seems bothered just to bring us drinks.  Will not ever come back to this BJs"
Benito L.,"Los Angeles, CA",511,291,12,3.0,1/2/2011,"For a pretty mediocre place, I don't understand why people constantly flock to this restaurant/brewery day in and day out. No wait, yes I do.... PIZOOKIE!!!! :)"
Lawrence T.,"Honolulu, HI",0,66,,4.0,11/2/2011,"We were first seated by the hostess at the darkest table in the restaurant.  So dark, we could hardly read the menu - and it's not like we're senior citizens!  Asked our waiter if we could move, and it was no problem.  In fact, he gave us outstanding service the whole time we were there, answering our questions deftly, meeting our needs, and making great suggestions. The place is huge, and so is the menu.  We started with the nachos and just about ate the whole thing between the two of us.  Not that it was small, but we were hungry and they were good.  Crispy chips, real cheese, and a bed of tasty chili. We also had a pizza, which our great waiter told us could be done half-half.  We got half portobello mushroom and half combination, both of which were delicious. For dessert, we were also informed that the pazooki can be done half-half, so we got half peanut butter and half triple chocolate.  Great complimentary flavors. I'd definitely come back.  Just watch out for the dark table."
Ed S.,"Studio City, CA",6,26,,1.0,10/26/2012,"I normally love BJ's, as the pizzas, wings, and pizzokie usually doesn't disappoint. But this Burbank location provided the worst experience that I've ever had in terms of quality of food - I would've gotten better food digging through a trash dumpster behind any of the other restaurants in Burbank. I visited this location a couple Saturday ago with my wife, and decided to order wings, pizza, and a pizookie. The wings were delicious as always, but that's where the fun stopped. The pizza was undercooked by a significant margin and all I could taste was dough. I asked for a replacement, and the replacement took over half an hour to get, which wasn't the worst of it. This time they overcooked the pizza and made it into a hard, crunchy cookie that I could have easily thrown through a brick wall. And just when I thought the meal couldn't get any worse, out came this undercooked pizookie that was nothing more than raw cookie dough covered with ice cream.  All in all, a pathetic effort by this Burbank location. There are a lot of better restaurants in that area that will serve better food, I suggest you go to one of those."
Martha L.,"Alhambra, Los Angeles, CA",0,10,4,4.0,1/2/2014,"The order was late, but the server (not her fault) made up for it with no charge for 2 N/A drinks and 3 free mini pazokies!  The food was delicious, we had a great lunch!"
Jamie R.,"Corona, CA",100,45,20,5.0,3/21/2011,"This gets 5 stars purely for their customer service. Their food is great...My mom had a turkey burger (huge), my grandma had the pot roast (she said it was tastey...and she's very picky) and I had the fried shrimp (yummy!). We were promptly seated, and immediately greeted by our waiter. He was very efficient, being sure to not let our drinks go empty or napkins run out. And we even had the manager check on us multiple times to make sure we had everything we needed. Great experience!"
Annette M.,"Anaheim, CA",6,53,86,4.0,4/11/2011,4.0 service... 4.5 food... I've been to the Bj's over in Brea several times and the food is always delicious and always busy... this was my first time at this location and everyone was polite and courteous upon arriving.. parking valet was like $4 but there was a two level mini lot there and we just wanted to save some money and parked. The greeter immediately had us seated and the server was attentive and informative. Had the best beginning.. great appetizer dish accompanied with the strawberry confusion and long island iced tea... was too full to eat anything even their signature cookie and ice cream concoction... pizookie ): perhaps next time..
Jonathan P.,"Los Angeles, CA",455,184,91,4.0,2/17/2011,"I often frequent this BJ's. The parking here kind of sucks, very limited. And then they make up for it by having valet. I'm sorry, but I don't feel like BJ's should be one of those places that you should valet for. Parking aside, the service and food here has always been good. The bartenders are always fast, friendly and professional. As always, Great White, Buffalo Wings and Piranha Pale Ale for me! Pizookie if I'm feeling extra glutinous."
Jenny J.,"Los Angeles, CA",94,126,66,3.0,9/2/2010,"ok. We came here for dessert. I don't regret it but wish the waiter was different. So heres the rundown: We walk in. Got seated. 7 minutes passed by. Waiter arrives with the menu.. Woot! (now the boys are having fun playing with the salt and pepper shaker and trying to stab each other with the butter knife) 10 minutes passed by he finally came and took our order. We got the pizookie trio, apple and oats, cookies and cream. 20 minutes passed by and our dishes arrive YAY!!! yum yum delicious something I would RECOMMEND!!!! OK. NOW WHERE THE HELL IS OUR WAITER!?!?!? 10 minutes passed by... 5 minutes passed by. screw it. I managed to flag down another waitress and had her bring our check. lala.. i gave her the money before she left to stop any other delay. 5 minutes passed.. another 5 minutes she stops and she looks at us and says that our waiter was going to bring it.. 5 minutes later.. the manager stops by asking us if we want anything else and i told him I WANT MY CHANGE. Finally got it, left a 2 dollar tip and left very pissed and annoyed."
Molly A.,"San Fernando Valley, CA",73,57,934,3.0,12/3/2010,"Turkey Club, Lasagna, and Avocado Rolls  are my favorites..."
Adam J.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,47,10,2.0,8/23/2014,Service was ridiculously slow. it took 30 minutes to see our server. It took 45 minutes for our food to come out. And it took another 20 minutes till someone came for us to ask for the check.
Kyle S.,"Burbank, CA",369,350,99,2.0,9/7/2010,"HANDS DOWN, WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER HAD THE MISFORTUNE OF EXPERIENCING. THE NIGHT MANAGER IS A JOKE. TO SUM IT UP.... PROS: -Big portions -Great food -Decent prices CONS: -HORRIBLE, RUDE & SLOW service -It gets VERY crowded VERY quickly -Parking is awkward."
Erica F.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,,2.0,6/29/2012,"Sooo i recently went with a few friends and and somehow they managed to send our pizza to the wrong table, so then we had to get a new one, only for it to be dropped on the way out. then they tried to charge us for large pazookies when we clearly ordered small ones. Besides those kinks food was okay and our server was funny."
Eric Z.,"Studio City, CA",1,26,,4.0,11/22/2014,"Pizza is good, but they have by far the best Hef you will find anywhere."
