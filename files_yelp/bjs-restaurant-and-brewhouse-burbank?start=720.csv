Jasmin A.,"Sun Valley, CA",176,36,3,1.0,2/17/2010,"Bad service. period I went there on a Monday to have an early dinner . The waitress served us our food, but disappeared for most of the evening. The restaurant was not even packed for being a long weekend, so there was really no excuse for her not to check up on us. She never came by to refill my soda; not once.  Our appitizer was served twice for some reason, but we shun away the second. We saw her from a distance chatting it up with other waiters most of the time and sitting down to socialize with other customers. We left disappointed at the service and gave her a tip that she deserved.  BJ's just lost 2 customers after that stunt"
Jen T.,"Los Angeles, CA",313,770,58,2.0,8/26/2012,"The good thing about this location is that it's a lot bigger than other BJ's, but there's a mandatory valet parking fee. So just be warned when you come here that if you want to park in their lot, you have to valet for $3.50 on a friday night. Not sure about other nights..."
Kait R.,"Houston, TX",0,356,138,3.0,5/7/2010,"The first thing that comes to mind when I think of BJ's is their Pizookie. It's definitely one of my favorite chain restaurant desserts. The buffalo chicken pizza is good with ranch and the beers are a nice bonus.  BJ's is good for a big group of people who like different things because their menu is pretty extensive. It's also fun to take someone who just turned 21 and introduce them to the beer sampler. The problem I have with BJ's is the service is always bad and the food isn't consistent. I can order wedge cut fries one day and order it the next day, and it's like two completely different plates of fries. Luckily, the pizza is consistent, but burgers and sandwiches aren't."
monica m.,"Covina, CA",102,14,4,1.0,6/15/2012,This place has the worst service of any restaurant I have ever been to!!! My group had a table n it was faster to go to the bar n get our order..our waitress never came to see if we needed drinks not until I asked to speak to a manager did we finally get a waiter to come ask us about drinks (n even then it took 20 mind n they were wrong)....we ordered a moscatto n got the giraffe no wine glass..so I asked for a glass they never came back...I had to go to the bar for glass...they get one star because that's the least I cam give them!! This place get a minus -0 for service...even the manager sucked!!
Tom A.,"Burbank, CA",7,49,8,5.0,5/28/2013,"I don't really give out 5 stars ever and yes it's a chain , but I have to say my wife and  I went last night and ate in bar area , no waiting, and I had the rib eye she had the sirloin steak  we realize  this is not a high end steak  house but the prices aren't also, but wow it tasted like one , both med rare cooked perfectly !  And mine 20 bucks hers 17. Really! With a wedge salad and other sides amazing!  And the beer selection and quality is awesome and the staff was super nice and it was at the busiest time of night ! Well done and that's why 5 stars for this type of restaurant its top of its class."
Chanda D.,"Los Angeles, CA",152,54,13,5.0,2/11/2010,"I love BJ's so much that I unabashedly proclaim ""I love BJ's!"", even though I know it sounds like I'm talking about blowiez.   Rarely do I frequent the same restaurant more than once/month because of all the oodles of choices in LA, but my first visit was a month ago and I've been there twice since. The pints of delicious hand-crafted beers are well-priced at $5 (the blonde is my fave - so crisp, clean, and smooth!), but is an even better price during the 10pm-close happy hour, during which time they're only $4.  Our knowledgeable waiter Chris suggested we get the pitcher, which was $14.95, cheaper than four beers at even the happy hour price - smart boy! I always get the veggie deep-dish pizza, which is great, but what's even better is that the personal size is half price, about $5, during the happy hour.  Note: happy hour is only at the bar tables. I've never had a bad experience at BJ's.  In fact, when I looked around at the tables last night, everyone looked as joyous as if they were in a Dave and Buster's commercial. There was a coupon on the bottom of my receipt that promised a code to get free mozz stix to complete a survey, so complete it I did.  I expected 3 stix, maybe 4, but the order was a full 10 stix! I love you, BJ's!!!"
Tiffany H.,"Embarcadero, San Francisco, CA",0,1,,2.0,11/15/2014,"I hope our server, Katherine S., has a better day tomorrow than she did today. A smile, eye contact and some personality would have made the long wait for our food more tolerable. Having been to this BJ's many, many times before, this was uncharacteristic of this location. We were expecting more than overcooked pasta and no pizza to-go boxes on a slow Saturday afternoon. Because this was unusual we'll most likely be back, but hopefully next time our review will have more stars and less complaining."
Scott D.,"Los Angeles, CA",117,55,28,3.0,1/23/2011,"The servers don't know anything about the gluten free menu.  You can't show them either because the iPhone won't bring up the Internet only the m.Internet.  Stupid smart phone, even more stupid servers.  Oh, the home brew beer is awesome."
Kaili C.,"Arnold, MO",4,205,30,2.0,9/13/2013,"Their piizookie cookie is wayy too sweet, overall their menu changes for the better, lighter and cheaper.   Better than apple bees."
Angie C.,"Mountain View, CA",43,152,1,1.0,3/6/2012,"I went to another BJ's Brewhouse in northern California this weekend that made me recall the absolutely HORRIBLE service from the Burbank BJ's. When I relayed the story to my friend, she advised me to share it on Yelp as well. 1st horrible experience: I threw a surprise party for a friend. I made the arrangements with the general manager three weeks in advance, down to the last detail including that there would be multiple checks, the party guests would need to be seated immediately even if the entire party wasn't yet there (it was a surprise, after all), and that I'd be bringing a cake/candles for the birthday girl. The morning of (Saturday in September 2010), I brought in the cake and candles and confirmed all the details with the host staff and management. Everything went smoothly for about an hour, and then things fell apart. It took more than two hours to split the checks, even though I'd offered from the start to help the servers divide them up and keep them separate. During those two hours, NO ONE came to check on us. Plenty of people wanted dessert and alcoholic drinks, but we couldn't even get anyone to bring water. I asked the server THREE TIMES for the cake. When she finally brought it out, she plunked it down in front of me (still in the box with the candles in a bag on top) and walked away. The most frustrating part was talking to management as this was happening. I was mortified that my guests were unable to leave whenever they felt like it because they didn't want to stick me with their bills. We were all stuck there for several hours with no drinks, no snacks, and no birthday celebration despite it all having been arranged in advance. When I pointed this out to management, he repeatedly apologized. Nothing more. I finally had to ASK what steps were being taken to fix the problem, and what they planned on doing to compensate us for the ruined party. After about 4 hours in the restaurant, we finally had an acceptable solution and got to leave. I was satisfied with the resolution and even came back a couple times (with non-memorable experiences) until my next horrible experience. 2nd horrible experience: This time, it was MY birthday. I was stuck at work, but wanted a to-go lunch from BJ's. I called in the order and left to pick it up. The problem with this restaurant is really the parking layout and the valet service. When I pulled into the parking lot, the valets had parked cars in all the to-go spaces. The valets directed me to a non-existent spot at the back of the lot, and I had to circle the block and re-enter the lot. Then the valets directed me to a second non-existent space. I circled the block again. The third time, I was getting pretty pissed. The valets told me to park in the handicapped spot. I told them no. They told me it was the only way I'd be able to get in at the moment, and that they did it all the time with no problems. I told them they'd be responsible for paying for any parking tickets and parked, furious.  Sure enough, a driver who actually had handicapped placards stopped me and asked why I'd parked there. Frustrated, I explained to her that the valets had told me to do it, and all I wanted to do was get my damn lunch. Wouldn't you know it, that lady called the police on the valets? Apparently she was a regular at this BJ's and was tired of the valets taking up to-go spaces and then telling to-go orderers to park in the handicapped spots (how does this become standard operating procedure?!). The valet rushed in after me, grabbed my keys, and reparked my car before the police arrived. When I mentioned what just happened to management, and the fact that this was two horrible experience related to birthdays in just a few months, I got a very nonchalant apology. I had to chase corporate customer service for MONTHS to get a response. I wound up getting a gift card for the aggravation, which I promptly used at a DIFFERENT BJ's location. I will never be returning to this one again."
Youbi K.,"Burbank, CA",56,60,13,4.0,5/12/2013,"Went on a friday night with 3 other friends, got seated quickly, friendly service, and clean, tasty food. What more to ask for?"
Marie D.,"Whittier, CA",0,2,2,1.0,11/7/2014,Horrible service called before arriving to ask for estimated wait time and they said 15 mins after arriving they told us it was 35 mins the hostess chelsey was really rude and made me feel like I was lying about calling when they had my name! They made us feel very humiliated and kept looking at us wrong they also had us move rudely when the place was crowded and there was no where to go go. Never coming back!!
Marie G.,"La Cañada Flintridge, CA",0,13,2,2.0,7/5/2012,This place  usually does well with service. But came here with a few friends the other day and ordered a large pizza and everything went wrong with it. First pizza came and it was mistaken for another pizza. Second one got dropped by our server right in front of us. Third one came out perfectly but the waiting really upset us. Desert was even an issue. We ordered mini pazookies and they charged us for large ones but on the plus side we did receive large pazookies. I've experienced better service here.
Lisa F.,"Burbank, Los Angeles, CA",51,9,,4.0,6/19/2012,"I was concerned coming in on Father's Day without a reservation, but was very happy to be sat within minutes! Our server Claudia, was amazing!! She was quick to greet us and made sure our toddler's meal was ordered at the same time as our appetizers. The buffalo wings are a favorite! For our meals, my husband ordered the pork sliders (which he loved)  and I tried the mahi mahi. The mahi mahi was good, slightly bland, but I added a bit of chili paste that was painted on my plate for a bit of flavor. Of course you cannot leave without trying a pizookie for dessert!! Our favorite by far is the Oreo pizookie! They also offer a trio plate which is nice to share and you can pick a variety of flavors to try at once. Our server also gave each of us ""Father's Day"" pilsner glasses to take home for coming in Father's Day weekend! We will definitely be back for the food and especially the service!"
Stephanie A.,"North Hollywood, CA",2,48,,5.0,6/8/2013,"I love BJ'S!!!!!! Everything is good here the bbq pizza, their lettuce wraps, Jambalaya... & i absolutely love their PIZOOKIE!!!!! If you want to enjoy delicious food come here!"
lindsey a.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,28,4,2.0,2/16/2012,"I LOVE the food here but this location is the WORST. It's close to my house, so it's convenient but I'd definitely rather go to the Glendale location, and here's why: -The first time I went here, we were seated and our sever never showed up to our table. When I say never, I mean never. We waited for 30 min since it was busy, and then called over a random server to see what was up. She said she'd find our server and send them over. Didn't happen. We called her over again and she ended up taking our order out of pity, even though she was slammed. Naturally, the service sucked since we weren't her table. We never met our real server. -One time, we were sitting in the back and a COCKROACH ran across the wall. I freaked out and got up. The manager came over and said he couldn't see it but asked us if we wanted to move (Um, no, I want to stay and dine with it...?). He placed us a few seats over which wasn't really far enough. I was sketched out the rest of the meal. We could see out of the window that the dumpster was close to the booth we were sitting in, so that's definitely where it came from. -Another time, when eating the spinach artichoke dip, I bit down on a huge chunk of GLASS! We could see that the dish the artichoke dip was in was cracked and missing a big piece,  about the size of a quarter . The piece was now in my mouth. The waiter didn't seem too worried. He kind of apologized and took it away. He didn't replace it, even though we were only half done. He ended up giving us the appetizer for free but that's all. Now, I'm not one to expect free stuff from places but I felt like this matter should have been handled a bit better. For all they knew, I could have cut myself or went home and filed a lawsuit. They treated it like I complained that the dish was cold or something.  Every other time I've been here the service has been super sketch.  So why do I keep going back??! Because I am obsessed with their BBQ Chicken Salad!! It's my favorite salad ever. Their food is always good. I've never had anything bad from BJ's (except service). Their beer is amazing too. **Oh and a little tip: When you pull up, there's a valet man who wants to take your car. Valet is  optional!!  Just tell him you want to self park and drive 3 feet forward into the lot. Most everyone thinks you have to valet so they pay money to have this man pull your car up a foot and park it. Unless you're the laziest person in the world, save your $3.50 and park it yourself.   After the glass incident, I switched to the Glendale location and haven't had any more problems."
Brittany B.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,10,3,2.0,5/3/2014,"Not my best experiences I've been so other bjs and they are great but this one made me so displease he spilled my drink and did not offer to get another. No Silverware was provided till asked while eating. We had to send back three dishes for wrong food, under cooked food, and over cooked food. One of our dishes was still not cooked properly after sending it back. The manger was fack and did not offer to comp any of it till we requested it. Then messed up the comp sad. Our waiter was at lest understanding and sweet. All in all bad experiences I'm glad it's not my first cause I would not go back"
Hannah M.,"SUNLAND, CA",3,5,,5.0,9/20/2014,"Always satisfied with BJ's food and service! Everything I have ever tried there has been great. But I always get their crispy fried artichoke, they are soo amazing!"
Ru K.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,1,,5.0,10/16/2014,My friends and I come all the time for happy hour. It's a pretty good deal and then we always get a pizookie...which is to die for! We had Brittany for the first time and she was awesome. Went above and beyond to make sure we were happy. She was funny and had us laughing with almost every encounter. Going to go in again for sure. Wish all BJs had this kind of friendly staff.
Stacie Y.,"Buffalo, NY",11,82,49,3.0,9/19/2012,"Has a great choices on the gluten free menu, and the tortilla soup was very good. Service was good, nothing spectacular."
