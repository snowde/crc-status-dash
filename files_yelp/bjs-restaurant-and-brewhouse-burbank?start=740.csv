Byron A.,"VALLEY VILLAGE, CA",42,131,17,4.0,11/13/2012,There are a lot of negative reviews about the service here. When I came our service was pretty good. Waitress was attentive and our food was brought out promptly. Food is like any other BJ's. I'd go back if I'm shopping at this mall again.
Tina N.,"Los Angeles, CA",2231,326,1248,3.0,2/28/2010,"PIZOOKIE! The only reason why i come in to this restaurant is for the amazing corse salad they give with BLUE CHEESE, and the STUFFED Chili Potato! YUM! + Party Size PIZOOKIE with Brownie and ICE CREAM to top it off! HEAVEN! Thats it, no other reason! Thank you, please come again! Oh by the way, service needs to get better. Front hostess was really mean and rude. FIRE that guy, no tip for him! C+ 5 Stars"
Topanga S.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,251,2,2.0,3/4/2012,This place used to be so packed  now it's dead. I guess Yard House beat it.
Jose L.,"Burbank, Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,2/23/2014,Pretty bad . Got there for my friends bday and they told me he was I was cut off because the birthday boy was too drunk. He left at least 5 mins after I came in.
S E.,"Mission Viejo, CA",2,14,7,1.0,12/2/2011,"Ive been to plenty different BJs but this was my first time here. It was horrible. Seriously--take the time to find a different one and drive there.  My server was Rebecca and she was very nice.  I ordered a classic baked potato, added cheese and bacon for about an extra $2. The potato came out and it was not even warm, the cheese was not melted as it usually is, they forgot to bring butter, and they forgot green onions. They made me another one, which I ate, but it was also not warm and they still forgot the green onions. Oh and they were both stale. Considering they brought them both out within like 2 minutes of ordering them, I'm guessing they were old. I'm usually excited when my food comes out fast, but that was not the case this time.  Then I got an Oreo pizookie, which at any other BJs is the best dessert ever. Not here. It was extremely doughy. So undercooked. Oh, and, they were not generous with the ice cream. I didn't eat it.  I am so disappointed with my experience here. I do not recommend it. Service was good, but the food was terrible...and what's a restaurant without good food ?"
Sabrina F.,"Los Angeles, CA",133,249,82,4.0,11/2/2012,For a Saturday night the wait was not too long.  We were seated and serviced with a smile. Our food was prompt and delicious.  Our waiter was friendly and quick.  We will come here again.
Kyle D.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,14,,5.0,7/9/2013,"This place has better Deep-Dish Pizza than any Pizza place! And don't get me started on how awesome the rest of their Menu is! They've got great service, a full bar and televised sports. Take my advice...eat here! To heck with the review. WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE?! GO EAT! You'll thank me! I'd love to finish this but a Pizookie is calling my name."
CD B.,"Corrales, NM",0,9,,4.0,6/26/2013,Did not disappoint in the least. Very consistent with other locations in food & drink quality as well as service. Good value for the money.
Leonard S.,"Palmdale, CA",48,95,266,1.0,10/22/2011,After 1:30 hr wait they sat us down next to a bunch of drunk ass fools. We asked the waiter to sit us in a different spot but they told us we would have to wait another 45 mins or told us we can leave. So I decided to say Fuck this BJ's. We left and told them off.... It's been over three years & I still haven't gone back!!!!
Rodene R.,"London, United Kingdom",100,218,36,3.0,9/5/2010,"Their pizzas are okay, but their PIZOOKIES are the only reason why I'd ever visit.  Must try their regular warm, chocolate chunk cookie with vanilla ice cream!!! They have the triple chocolate pizookie made with Ghirardelli - soooo delicious!!!  I love all of the flavors EXCEPT oatmeal. If you do go here, might as well try their PIZOOKIE TRIO!"
Matt W.,"Wilmington, NC",659,295,17,4.0,8/10/2012,"Love their salads (my wife's favorite salad), buffalo chix pizza and pizooki dessert"
Brice S.,"Portland, OR",19,13,9,5.0,1/25/2011,"Always a friendly staff. Every time I've been here they've been on the ball, but that is when it's just me and my girlfriend. When the people in my party start to multiply, then the service dies down and gets lacking. The food is always top notch and delicious. Their weekend brunch menu is awesome (gluten free breakfast pizza is a favorite). The portions are big and the beer is crisp and cold. There is a massive tv over the main bar, and many different smaller nice tvs all around. Never had any problem asking for them to be changed to a specific game. Bear in mind, I don't think this place is a ""sports bar"" but more of a restaurant that happens to keep sports on when it's on. Actually, I am thinking about their beer right now... and it's only 11:30am...!"
David T.,"Burbank, CA",78,327,5,3.0,7/30/2010,"The food and dessert (pizookie) here are really good. I was very satisfied in that regard. The worst part here is the parking situation. This is probably the only restaurant I can think of in Burbank that requires valet parking. I guess you can walk a few blocks from one of the parking garages if you don't want to pay a valet, but who wants to do that? Also, as for the service, once we were helped, everything was fine. The problem with my last experience here was that after we were seated, it took over 20 minutes for us to get served! Fortunately, a waiter who normally was not assigned our table saw us waiting and took care of us. So the service was not terrible, but we should not have had to wait as long as we did. I only hope that this place does not fall to the level of bad service that many other restaurants have in the year 2010."
Heather H.,"Glendale, CA",254,139,263,4.0,9/12/2010,"Quick service, friendly staff. :o)  Pizookie's are awesome, I suggest the mini's unless you have a friend of two to help you eat one. :oP So is the Berry Blast Cider (21+).  Parking isn't all that great, not a lot of spaces due to Valet. I parked across the street with no problems."
Brian T.,"Los Angeles, CA",82,49,,2.0,11/15/2010,"Only been to this location once and it wasn't that great. Host was an amateur. Told us 15-20 minutes and we waited over 45 minutes for a table for 2. I understand that it was a busy night but anyone who has ever been a host before should know that you always overestimate the time if you're unsure or if it's busy (especially on a game night). If they had told us 30 minutes for a table we would have gone elsewhere since we were on somewhat of a time schedule. But having invested over 20 minutes it was too late for us to move to a different restaurant. Our server was also not so great. Since we waited 45 minutes we had already decided on our order so as soon as the server came we were ready to order. I told her so and she gave us this look like ""wtf I only wanted drink orders from you."" She took drinks and food orders from us and then left without a word. No ""thank you,"" no smile, nothing. She just turned around and left and I was still holding our menus for her to take. Way to ignore me. She never did take those menus, they sat at the table until we left. She wasn't the most prompt server either. Even if she was insanely busy and having the worst night of her life, I would have been happy with at least a smile. Terrible service. Food and drinks were fine though. I've been working in the food industry for over 10 years and this place utterly fails in the front of house. Someone should send those kids back into training."
Jerry V.,"Bullhead City, AZ",33,92,,2.0,11/6/2012,Service sucks.  The beer is good and the food is OK.   The walk to our house has us coming back.  We go for the Tuesday 50% wine and appetizers.  Would never go at full price. Too many other good places for that kind of money.
Ms I.,"Los Angeles, CA",43,147,,4.0,12/27/2012,"I'd give BJs a 5-star rating, but the last time I went there to eat with a client, the food was sub par and the waitress had an attitude problem. Usually, when we go in they know me and come over and chat. Most of the wait staff is fun and super nice, but not this waitress we had (an older African American woman). The food is excellent and I love the variety of beers. I like the giant baked potato and the wedge salad. Save room for the Pazookie (the giant cookie with ice cream). I always forget and get stuff, even thought they have miniature versions. Fun place to go with friends. I was actually taken here for my bday this year and the waiter didn't sing (we tried to make him), but he did bring me and my crew a Pazookie."
Sara R.,"Dallas, TX",108,276,,4.0,6/19/2010,"You only come to BJ's for Happy Hour.   If you don't, then no wonder you're not happy. Happy Hour yields 50% off of their mini pizzas (so it ends up being about $5), $2 off of the other apps, and $1 off of their draft beers - and I think the wine, too.  Not the best deal, beer-wise, but the deal on the food before 7pm on weekdays, makes up for it. Happy Hour is only reedemable if you sit at the bar, or the tables in the middle section of the bar area.  NOT the booths surrounding the bar.  Lame.   You get a good dose of sports, sporting updates, and more sports with the many TVs along the perimeter.   The food.  It's good.  Especially their pulled pork sliders.  Some of the best pulled pork I've had!  I got the angus sliders last night, and although they're good, the meat is not thick enough to make me vouch for them.   The mini pizzas are great.  Very fluffy crust..  loads of cheese, good amount of meat, and limited veggies.  Well, if you get the veggie one, I'm sure it would alter that ratio.  I got the Southwestern one, and it was just ok.  I wouldn't get it again.  I've had the buffalo chicken pizza, and that's royal.  I've also had the Great White (a long time ago), but remember it as being pretty freakin good.  I mean, alfredo sauce?  That has no option to be bad. They don't have your typical beers..  draft or bottle..  i.e. Miller/Lite, Bud/Lite, Heineken, etc.  Alas, it's a brewery.  I haven't had their beer in awhile, but I believe it was good.  It was the blonde beer (the lightest one they have). The place is clean, good atmosphere, and the service is an A!  They messed up my order a bit, but that's not the wait staff fault.  And I won't blame the cooks, because they're working on a Friday evening and we're getting to enjoy ours.  Slack.  Cut.   Oh, their wedge salad.  Holy *#@$&(@#&$(#*@&$(*#$&.  That's all I'll say."
Cliff M.,"Lynwood, CA",3,1,,1.0,5/13/2013,"called ahead they said it was a 20 min wait. Then I got there in less than 3 mins and they said it was an hour wait. I got upset, then I was standing there and another customer called they told that person the samething 20min. I guess they really want to make business. Lol (Wish they were honest) after that... waiter/waitress forgot a few things.. never saw it... I been to other BJs and there much more polite ;) I did not have a very good experience."
Renee P.,"South El Monte, CA",15,15,,1.0,9/28/2011,"I ordered $14 ahi tuna salad, think it was an appetitizer, it only had three thinly sliced ahi and 1/4 of avacado, it was pittiful, nothing like the picture shown, so i politely mention to the waiter, upon returning he said the chef apologize for not putting enough lettuce (garnish) at the bottom of the mound to make it taller and fuller like the picture. At that point i didn't want to talk to them anymore, decided to just keep my peace and never to return. I've never felt so ripped off by a restaurant lol."
