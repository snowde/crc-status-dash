Tim S.,"Savannah, GA",42,26,1,3.0,9/16/2010,Really cool sports bar atmosphere with an extensive menu.  Better than bar food but not by much.  I do enjoy their brews especially the dark beers.  I've had problems with service in the past but not into the last few visits.  Don't try the pizza.  Its more like garlic cheesy bread than pizza.  Where's the sauce?  And don't you dare call their pizza deep dish.  Its nothing like Chicago style deep dish.  Dress warm because these guys keep the temp around 60.  It's always freezing in here!
Leanne P.,"Burbank, CA",140,39,8,4.0,10/23/2009,"I've been a BJs regular for, um... decades, I guess, beginning with the one on the Balboa Peninsula.  So I appreciated that when they went corporate, at least they were nice enough to open a location near home.   The food here is good, and there's something for everybody.  My personal favorite is the Angel Hair Toscana pasta (get it with grilled chicken), which gives me enough leftovers for another meal the next day.  Salads are good pretty much across the board.  The thin-crust appetizer pizzas are awesome.  I'm not a huge deep-dish fan, but I still splurge once in a while.  The bartenders, by the way, mix a terrific Mai Tai. This is NOT a romantic date kind of place.  It's loud.  But if you're into sports, it's a great place to watch a game as long as you can find a table.  Parking can be a drag--you either valet park (grr), or brave a hideously-designed ramp up to the top level of the tiny parking garage.  Don't even THINK of trying that if your car is lower than your average sedan... either park across the street or use the valet.   Overall, a good place for a relaxed meal, or for drinks with friends."
Raymond N.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,1,2.0,7/3/2015,Will say this. Been to this location a few times and food is always good and service is good as well kinda slow at times but over all good. Went in tonight 6-2-15 and went into the men's restroom to wash my hands before dinner. The bathroom was a mess water everywhere and used hand tissue all over trash over flowing. I informed the host a young lady who acted like I was a bother and told me we will get it cleaned. During dinner I excused myself to once again visit the restroom and the place was still a mess nothing was cleaned. When I walked out I saw who I believed to be the manager a tall guy and told him about it and again he looked at me like I was being a bother. When dinner was over my friend who I was dining with excused himself walked into the bathroom and couldn't believe how messy it was. He thought I was making it up. I'm sorry 3 different times in that bathroom and you couldn't clean it. Again over all food is good but keep up with your cleanliness cause stuff like that makes me wonder how you keep other parts of your restaurant.
Myro B.,"Burbank, CA",166,17,,3.0,12/21/2012,Love their spinach artichoke deep
Manoj N.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",146,827,100,3.0,2/23/2013,"Even though I lived and work in the neighborhood, I went to their happy hour for the first time yesterday with colleagues from work. First off the happy hours prices are not happy. Its only about a $1 less than regular prices. The food portions are very small so I ended up ordering the regular dinner sandwich. Food is just okay and tending towards terrible. The fries I got seemed cold and looking back I should have sent it back to the kitchen. I got the wildberry mojito ( 2 rounds) and they were pretty good. Strong in alcohol and flavor. Beware of the valet parking trick. The valet goons will stand along the parking driveway as if there is only valet parking. But thats not true, just drive past them and into the parking structure on the right side. Its free there after 3 pm."
Stephanie S.,"San Fernando, CA",17,37,,5.0,8/14/2010,"I've been to this location and to Glendale countless times.  During my most recent visit, I experienced the best service I've ever received -- anywhere. It was a bustling Thursday night and the place was crowded with high school students and birthday parties.  The wait staff was clearly busy, so I did not get my side salad until the entree arrived, and they forgot to include pineapple salsa with my salmon. It wasn't a big deal -- I'm not one to be fussy, especially with my favorite restaurant.  However, they more than made up for their mistakes without me even having to ask!  I received many apologies from both our waiter and the manager... then they completely took my entree off the bill (it's a $15 dish) and gave us a free pizooki! This is why I come back again & again.  Not only is the food hot, fresh & delicious each time, but the staff is friendly, considerate, and more than happy to make your experience enjoyable.  I moved here from the Midwest last year, and it's appalling how horrible the customer service is!  This is one chain that I can count on.  I don't understand why it only averages 3.5 stars and I'm shocked that reviewers are complaining about the prices.  It's about the same as The Cheesecake Factory, El Torito, or pretty much anywhere else in Los Angeles. If the beer prices are a little more than what you're used to, it's because BJ's brews their own beer -- and it's totally worth it.  Ask for a half-and-half pitcher of Hefeweizen & Berry Cider!"
Michelle R.,"Burbank, CA",1,2,,1.0,6/16/2015,"I went to BJ's in Burbank with a friend. The service was awful our waiter seemed like he was stoned out of his mind. When it came to paying the bill I want to use my points that I have from catering all of my business meetings, which totaled 592. They told me I had no points and I have never used them. They went on to say they could nothing about the points but would give us half off of the bill. Well I checked my bank account and they charged the full bill, but the charged slip I signed was for half the bill. So not only did they lie about it they had me sign charge receipt with a different amount then what they charged. Now all this was done by the manager because as I said the waiter was too stoned to know what was going on. So this is one of two things or maybe both; fraud, or they have no idea what they are doing, or both. I will never eat there again and I definitely will never use them for our meetings. They have lost a very good customer. Good Bye"
Clayton W.,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",15,144,,4.0,6/11/2010,"Is BJ's fine dining? God, no. But the beer is great and all of the food is very workmanlike and tasty for a brewery.  Go with a friend and get a pitcher of the Jeremiah Red or PM Porter, or if you feel like walking around Burbank in the zone between buzzed and drunk for about an hour, go with the extremely flavorful Tatonka Stout. Food I get often includes the Meatloaf, Buffalo Chicken Pizza, and the Beef Dip.  These aren't trendsetting or amazingly innovative meals, but they're always flavorful and done consistently right.   As a result, BJ's is always an extremely agreeable choice for the neighborhood, franchise or no franchise."
Gabriel A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,12/22/2013,So I haven't been to bj for a while and after this experience I don't think I'll be back first they took almost 40 minutes to bring us our food and then the salmon we ordered was raw so they took it back and they finally brought us the salmon to find out there was a hair in the broccoli! Not a good experience I was very disappointed with the service and I questioned the cleanliness of the kitchen.
Marlaina R.,"GRANADA HILLS, CA",128,141,56,4.0,6/2/2012,"You can't go wrong with this place, really. The menu is extensive and the lunch specials are an insane value. Most importantly, PIZZOOKIE. That is all."
Roberto S.,"Burbank, Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/3/2013,"If I could give a no star, I would.  Bad, bad, horrible service. We arrived and even though there were tables, we had to wait over 1/2 hour. When we finally were seated, even after ordering our drinks, they took forever to bring them. When the food finally arrived, mostly it was cold. All the plates came in at different times. Their motto was ""the other ones are coming after.""  Some of us started eating 1.5 hours after we arrived. We decided that we would give them a chance due that it was my moms birthday. So we order their bazookie or whatever their dessert was. It took over 1/2 hour.  The whole ordeal took over 3 1/2 hours. We were very dissatisfied.  Don't come here!!!!"
Chris D.,"Irvine, CA",2115,313,52,2.0,8/27/2009,"Now if i gave the newer and better Glendale Bj's a 3 star then for sure I have to give this a 2.5. Simple. PARKING! that damn one floor of parking isn't enough for my family(no were not Mexican and don't all squish in one car) [ that was all in good humor nothing racist]. But seriously, the only plus this one has over the Glendale one is the wait time, definitely less, I feel it is bigger then the Glendale one and busier since the AMC is right around the corner, Oh well you get my drift! TFR"
Anasheh H.,"Glendale, CA",28,12,8,1.0,12/12/2013,"First of all- I don't usually write reviews but when I do it's either the place deserves business or doesn't deserve business. I don't even know where to start.  To start off, they were out of Pepsi, and almost every appetizer I wanted. That wasn't so bad. Then my food came out and I asked for ranch because the container that should've had ranch was missing the ranch. That was ok too. So I asked for plates. That took 25 minutes to come out. So by the time the plates were out I told my waiter that my food was cold and he said well ""these don't usually come out with plates"" this guy loved to talk back. On top of that he pointed out that he spilled the ranch on him and that's why he didn't bring that out.  So I asked for the manager.. The waiter comes back and says ""the manager told me you can have a pazookie"" ummmmm I never asked for a pazookie actually I asked for a manager and he never showed up!!!!!! Terrible service and I can guarantee you I will go back to find out this waiters name to add it to this review. If I could give this this place no stars I would. This was Unbelievable."
Denise A.,"San Fernando, CA",0,34,7,1.0,3/18/2011,"I've been here plenty of times, but this last time I went will def. be the last time. We barely had recieved our appetizer, and there on our booth, was a ROACH!!!! a ROACH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The waitress and manager, kindly asked us not to make a big scene, and told us that they get inspected like every week for this. Very convincing.. NOT! seems to me this happens often, seeing as the manager was very ""cool"" about it. I really don't have anything else to say.."
Paul D.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,38,11,4.0,3/27/2010,"It's my fourth time eating at this BJs so here goes.  First, they make you wait in their waiting area for 10-15 minutes, so that once they sit you down, you wait another 10-15 minutes for mediocre service and your food...  So once they finally get to you, they start you off with drinks and appetizers. I've never had their beer but I have heard that it is good... I'll have to try it for myself some day... Anyway, their soft drinks are $2.95... I always get the Strawberry Lemonade which is pretty darn good. For appetizers, if calamari is available I always order it and wudduya know? They have it for $8.95 and it is pretty awesome. It has the right amount of crispiness so that you can enjoy the taste, not like other places where it's not crispy enough or just too crispy. It comes with two lemons, marinara dip, and ranch dip.  For the main course I get the Scampi Pasta, because I love shrimp,  but here's the kicker, instead of the Angel Hair and Roma tomatoes that it originally comes with, I ask for Fettuccine and Sun Dried Tomatoes!!! This costs $14.95.  You seriously gotta try it!!! You most definitely won't regret it!!! : ) Finally for dessert, their signature Pizookie for $5... something... sorry I can't remember off the top of my head but it's usually just under $6. Anyway, I always get the White Chocolate Macadamia with Vanilla Ice-Cream. Haven't had any other one but this one has never let me down. If you do end up eating at BJs, don't leave without having a Pizookie!!!  So aside from the wait and mediocre service, the food is what gave them a four. The fact that they actually do the changes I request and the quality of the taste is good. It's not great, but I do need a BJs pasta n Pizookie fix here and there..."
Miguel O.,"El Monte, CA",2,117,,3.0,3/9/2010,"The name is what gets people to come inside this place. What were you expecting? A whorehouse? It sez, ""Restaurant and Brewery"" on the sign. Their happy hour is pretty good, not great, but good. The appetizers during this period are a really good deal. The mini pizzas are all pretty good, share 3 of 'em with friends. The drink menu is interesting. BJs makes their own beer, but not on the premises of course. That operation is done elsewhere. The beer vats are just for show apparently. I like the seasonal trappist style ale they make (winter time I guess). The porter is okay and the rest of their beers are average. During happy hour the beer prices are good. Even better is getting a drink though that would cost you $9 or $10 normally and paying like $4 or $5 for it. They make a good Long Island Ice Tea here too, in other words, they don't leave out the tequila like most people do. Can't see myself coming to a BJs a lot, and parking sucks at this place during the day, the staff is alright but not great. If you don't know where to go for happy hour and need some breathing room this place might be alright for you."
Gary E.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,22,,4.0,6/29/2012,"The Burbank location is way better then the one at Glendale, I think it's bigger too, classic place good food huge plasma T.V's and we always find parking"
Leens B.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,23,4,3.0,3/25/2010,"BJ's is the type of place that it makes sense to order dinner from on a late working night--there's something for everyone on the menu (same with Granville Cafe, CPK, Cheesecake Factory and every other slightly too pricey, generic chain restaurant). I guess that explains how I feel about all those restaurants... The avocado egg rolls with the accompanying sauce are super yummy! The portions are gigantic and you'll have leftovers unless it's a salad and there's no point in keeping lettuce to go wilty. I had the bbq chicken pizza, which was tasty but it's certainly no chicago deep dish."
Martha L.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,58,428,5.0,12/5/2011,"My boyfriend and i decided to go to bj's and have some pizza and beer. It was saturday night and the wait was 30-45 min for 2 people, we do not have thaT much time because i have a 5 month old baby to get back to asap so we took a pager and started looking for seats at the bar. My bf sees 2 people leaving and we scored 2 seats in the bar area which were perfect, high table for 2 directly in front of the televisions. We were approached immediately and had our table wiped down. we started off with 2 jeremiah reds my favorite beer there, i noticed they changed their uniforms because i used to work in the bj's at glendale. the girl was very happy to tell us why and when they made this change. She was very friendly and understanding to all of our needs. We ordered the best beginnings as our appetizer and doubled the spinach dip. The only annoying part was that there was a couple sitting next ot us on a date and the girl just kept talking louder and louder, I think she was obviously getting sloppy drunk and the guy was so nervous he kept shaking his foot and that drives me crazy. i turned side ways to face my boyfriend and enjoy his company instead of getting mad. He ordered a clam chowder which was super good, and the food runner brought a second one, i told him we already had one and he said ""now you have another"" woo hoo! Finally we ended with a bbq chicken pizza (sooo good). Nothing could have  made our night better. Until i decided that i just had to take a couple of glasses home to drink beer later. I asked the girl instead of just stealing them if she could charge me for 2 glasses or if i could have them. I was shocked when she said i could take them and even brought me 2 fresh clean glasses from the back. WOW!! We really had a great fun time, and really enjoyed the service, we never had to look for our server to get anything, she was always there. Eventually she had to go home and introduced the next cocktail girl to us and we decided to close the tab out with her so that we could show her our appreciation with a nice tip. For this pleasant evening i give them FIVE STARS!!"
Gene S.,"Burbank, CA",0,11,3,4.0,10/9/2012,"Nice selection of beers, including the guest ones! Appetizers are so far all very good with the Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps in first place, and fantastic pizza!"
