Brenda F.,"Los Angeles, CA",57,3,,1.0,5/20/2014,"My friends and I ordered a table for 20 people at first the service was going okay, but once we sat down. My friends and I didnt get a waiter to take are order until, I had to go to the counter and ask the host if he could take are order since we had been waiting for 30 minutes already. The manger came got are order at 11:30p.m & are food was not delivered until 12:45p.m. We waited so much just for are food and to top it off are food was cold . We complain twice so they could warm are food. I honestly didnt want to stay any longer & left . This place was so horrible . Dont go here specially with a large group. I would like to be contacted because I love bJ but the customer serivce their is horrible."
Gerard I.,"Pasadena, CA",501,806,351,5.0,11/17/2008,"Das Bier.  I love premium beer. I forgot what we ordered. I think I had the blackened chicken potato, you can never go wrong with that gigantic 'tater.  We split a pitcher of Tatanka, and a beer sampler. I think we were pretty buzzed off of the sampler even before we got to the pitcher of Tatanka.  I think we also ordered a Pizookie towards the end. Pizookie washed down by some premium beer is good eatin'!"
Leah A.,"Burbank, CA",10,63,20,2.0,9/4/2011,"I understand large groups can be a challenge, but come on! This many screw ups, so not acceptable! We've had delayed orders, wrong checks and orders, and terribly cooked dishes. Our last visit was especially awful. Two of our friends had to send back orders of the ahi poke because they weren't fresh and they royally messed up on our check. Not to mention we kept getting mystery dishes sent to our table not belonging to anyone. By the end of the night i felt like i was being punked and we were going to see cameras pop up from under the table.We ended up staying there waaay longer then we wanted to get the mess all cleared up. What a bummer, cuz BJs used to be a great hang out place : ("
Mari D.,"North Hollywood, CA",19,69,,4.0,6/20/2012,I recently came here and got the BBQ pulled sandwich with wedge cut fries that was amazingly delicious. Our waiter for that evening was very helpful. You can't leave this place until you try a pazookie!!! The pazookie's are so freaking delicious!!!
Kat B.,"Glendale, CA",0,1,1,2.0,6/29/2013,i usually like coming here but we got our meal to go this time and first of all theres no sweet potato fries. ok fine just do regular fries but when i come home i dont want to see mashed potatoes. my plate portion was a sad looking cold piece of chicken with a sad side of no dressing salad and 3 pieces of grilled onion. no way !! that is not the amount or what you get when u sit down! and it happened before. im bummed out! attached my picture. i mean i paid a fair amount of $
Chelsea D.,"La Canada Flintridge, CA",97,23,,1.0,2/22/2014,"Came in for lunch, my burger was pretty bad and made me feel sick afterwards. The service was lacking. Over all it's such a mediocre restaurant- the prices they charge are almost criminal."
Frances L.,"Los Angeles, CA",1425,1184,462,3.0,11/5/2010,"I am by no means a fan of their beer here. Sorry, folks, but if you're going to go the microbrew way, then California's got tons of better places for that sort of thing so the huge BJ's chain just doesn't make the cut. HOWEVER, BJ's does have pretty good food, so not all hope is lost! Their rendition of pub classics and hearty American comfort food is pretty good and at a decent price,too. The service varies with each location, but I tend to drop by this Burbank location over the one in Westwood because it seems less crowded. They make a pretty good draught root beer for you non-alcoholics, but be warned: it's suuuuper sweet. AND, you can't leave without having a pizookie. It's a MUST."
Marion S.,"North Hollywood, CA",182,102,39,3.0,1/4/2009,"""It's not a bad place to go but there are just better out there. I know I say that in most of my reviews but it holds true at BJs. It's a cool place to go with some friends and have a few drinks. That's the one great thing about this place, you get some friends and a few drinks and you can never have a bad time. Let's start with the food shall we. I can't speak poorly of the food nor can I speak highly of it either. Certain things are better than others however. I'd stay away from their burgers, I've never been a fan of it. Their sandwiches though, depending on what you get can be good. I remember getting the Turkey California Club once and it left me full and satisfied. The Jambalaya is good and really spicy. I once had the pasta and it was just meh. The meatloaf is worth getting if you're hungry and don't want to chew. However the two best things to get here are their HUGE baked potatoes or their pizza. The potato can be kind of a crap shoot. Sometimes it's cooked perfectly and other times not so much. If you're hungry and are on a high carb diet or just want to die of gluttony, I say get the baked potato. It's prepared a few different ways. I'm a fan of the Broccoli and Cheese with Alfredo sauce. So many calories yet so much goodness. Their pizzas are some of the best I've had. I'm not a fan of deep dish pizzas but I am when I'm here. Usually deep dish pizzas can be chewy but that isn't the case here. Sure you may need to eat your pizza with a knife and fork, which I've been informed makes you less of a man. (Sidebar: Thin crust pizza FTW!) Best way to have a meal here is to wash it down with something alcoholic. As it says in it's name, BJ's is a brewery so they make their own beers here and only serve their own beers (with the exception of a Chimay I believe). Their beers are OK, but I'm only a fan of their lighter beers. The blond and hef are probably the best. Once you're piss drunk and full, you're gonna wanna get the pizookie or the brownie. Both are just cookies (or a brownie) warm from the oven and they pile on a few scoops of ice cream. There's nothing really special about it but it's just so good. All in all, it's a great place to go but it's just average."""
Kelly S.,"Minneapolis, MN",110,250,12,1.0,2/28/2011,do you enjoy standing at the host stand being ignored by a hostess while she has a long conversation with her friend? this is just the place for you!
Jake C.,"Garden City, MI",27,46,,1.0,1/24/2011,the service most always sucks at this BJs tried it again and yea still sucks try glendale BJs it not to far from here  don't go here unless you want a stressful frustrating experience
Ryan C.,"Los Angeles, CA",96,161,1199,5.0,2/11/2009,Whenever my friends and I are in the mood for deep dish style pizza and a cold pitcher of beer.... this is the spot! You can't go wrong with a large BBQ chicken pizza and 2-3 pitchers of the Piranha pale ale while catching the game on the flat screens or just enjoying great conversations amongst one another. Everything I've tried on their menu is pretty good and never disappoints. I highly recommend you try their Famous Pizookie which is probably one of my favorite desserts of all time. Damn!.. I can definitely go for one right about now!
Terra O.,"Los Angeles, CA",668,119,332,5.0,7/15/2011,"5 stars for having one of the best deserts I've ever had!  You must try the bazookie when you visit!  Even if you're stuffed, do it!  Their sample beer platter is also great!"
Sal D.,"Haddonfield, NJ",1218,543,374,2.0,9/28/2010,"came here for the 2 for 20, food was great service was horrible."
Joey H.,"Los Angeles, CA",62,320,3,5.0,9/24/2013,"me and my friend come here as a reward after our hikes in the hills nearby. we talk about coming here before, during and after the hike so we really enjoy this place. its a nice place and its always clean when we come. we always share a large veggie. its so good!  i dont think we ever took home any leftovers. the last time we went we also had the avocado egg rolls. thats good too, i can eat a couple of orders if i let myself. but its all about the pizza when you come here! btw, she always gets the pizookie, lol."
Soo C.,"Alhambra, CA",81,193,26,2.0,3/15/2011,This was my second time here. Food was good nothing spectacular. Service was pleasant. The prices were standard. Just a Ho-Hum place. I grew up in Chicago so I'm not a fan of their pizza.
Brian R.,"Burbank, CA",214,112,46,3.0,11/9/2008,"Got a mystery coupon in the mail to try out their fall food specials so we took a trip to BJ's on a Sunday. It was game day so people were cheering and screaming at their teams on one of the many tv's around the restaurant. The Bar was packed, and it defiantly was a noisy experience. We started out with a garden salad, which was nothing special, the tomatoes were a little mushy, but not too bad. I got the parmesan crusted chicken which was delicious, its drizzled with a cream sauce that I had to request for more of (because without it, the chicken was dry). The broccoli and mash potatoes were average. The lady got the jambalaya, which was filled with shrimp and chicken sausage. It had a nice taste and spice to it.  We didnt try the beer, but it looked like a good selection. The prices seemed right, and my only complaint was the service didnt seem very friendly, and it was loud. Being a ""brewery"" I guess this isnt the best place for a quiet romantic dinner. I liked BJ's, i'm sure it would be a great place to watch a game and drink some beers, but I also dont think I would ever crave BJ's.  It is what it is."
Brittany B.,"Santa Clarita, CA",191,1064,133,3.0,9/8/2013,"Really nice servers but a few quarks that make the experience more of a three. I love BJ's in general, as far as chains go. The in-house brews are a treat, and the non-alcoholic homemade drinks (like root beer, cream soda, and orange cream soda) are a nice plus if you are with a group that is not in for imbibing (as was the group I was with). But when we arrived with our party of five adults and two kids, they placed us in a booth that was really meant for 5 max. We had to ask them to move us, which they promptly did, to a table in the bar area. But, really, who puts 7 people in a booth that small, especially on a very hot day and when tables in the bar are plentiful? Service was great, orders taken fairly promptly, and refills kept a-comin'. There was a situation where two of the men in our group ordered bowls of clam chowder and got bread bowls instead, a minor mix-up. But towards the end of the meal our server went AWOL for awhile. This is less felt when you are with a big group and everyone is talking, but I noticed it. It was the very moment that my 6-year old wanted water to finish up his meal, and it took awhile from that point for our waiter to stop by so that we could ask for it. It was brought promptly from the point we could request it, and shortly after there was a shift change, so that could have been the reason. So even though the waiter was nice and helpful, just enough funky business to lose this place a ""4""."
Xochilt P.,"PACOIMA, CA",0,3,,1.0,1/22/2013,"This is been the worst service ever, specially the server name: Dustin, he is the bad waiter, no skills at all, really unprofessional. he is racist and has an anger Management problems. He got bother because he didn't like the tip we left him, he started yelling all over the restaurant assaulting us with really bad words. and he left slamming the back kitchen door, really what service is this.. i right away reported to BBB, still waiting for call to further discuss this with my attorney. never ever experience such bad service with BJ's, The manager Nick Momayez was no help at all, he did not even express the sorry he had when he told us, he will take care of it. really bad service by this server Dustin.... trust me this is not going to stay like this..."
Elizabeth B.,"Baltimore, MD",9,20,,4.0,9/29/2009,"So... yeah. I met up with some friends down in Burbank last Friday. Being totally unfamiliar with the area (I live on the East Coast, my fam is in Ventura), I let them do the choosing of the place to eat, and BJs was chosen. Why? Well, mostly because we're all a bunch of lushes and they do their own beer. I did not mention that I'd eaten at the BJs in Oxnard the night before. That'll be our wee secret, okie doke? I ordered hefeweizen tonight. Yum. A vast improvement over the way-too-weirdly-tart-but-sweet cider of the night before. Really, any place that does their own beer is going to get three stars to start from me. As long as they're, yanno, good at it. I ordered a salad (a damn good salad smothered but not drowned in awesome honey mustard--there's another half star), my compatriots ordered the BBQ burger pizza sans cheese and the sauce. Our waitress was tits, y'all. She dealt with some odd requests and other eccentricities with aplomb and good grace. Not to say we were dickish about said requests, just that she didn't get pissy about them--very helpful and well-trained. I wish I could remember her name. Oh well. What you really want to hear about is those cookies, right? God*damn*, they're good. Pizookies, they call them? Yeah, I don't get why, but who really cares? they're humongous and warm and gooey and come with ice cream. I attempted one all by my lonesome on this trip and failed utterly. I only got halfway through. I was sad to have to abandon the other half. here's a tip for you regarding the parking: if you know your way around, park at the mall and walk. just don't lose your spot or forget which garage is the east one, like we did."
Natalie A.,"Porter Ranch, Los Angeles, CA",33,70,32,4.0,9/21/2009,"I hate that I love EVERYTHING on the menu. pizza's are bomb, appetizers are awesome, love the nachos! should I have a sandwich? Maybe a stuffed baked potato?  a pitcher of beer (or berry burst cider) and i'm in heaven! yeah, this is life. I'm pretty easy to please =)"
