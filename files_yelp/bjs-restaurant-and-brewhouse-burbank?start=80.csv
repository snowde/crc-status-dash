Rowen H.,"Las Vegas, NV",44,102,310,3.0,9/8/2016,"I tried the Sirloin Steak that came with two sides. For my sides, I chose the Tomato Bisque and Skinny Fries. The steak was mediocore, nothing too special about it. I thought it was actually a bit too dry (I did get the medium well) but it seemed like it was well done because some parts of the steak was burnt. I really enjoyed the tomato Bisque and their fries were also really good. For $15, I thought it was well worth it. Service was really slow. We asked our server if she knew what the letters ""BJ"" stood for (we were not trying to be gross) and her response was, ""it's not what you think it is.."" She actually had no idea what it stood for so my friends and I ended up looking it up online. Anyways, I thought my experience here was average. Try it when you are in Burbank, CA."
Mitch M.,"Burbank, CA",2,30,3,3.0,2/6/2017,"Food was great. Service wasn't. We waited almost 10 minutes after we were seated for our server, Brandon, to ask us our drink order. Then waited another almost 10 minutes to get them. I ordered a burger with no mayo or onions and a side. Burger came with mayo and onions with no side, of course waiting another 10 minutes to tell the server it was wrong. Drinks weren't refilled often. Plus side was he apologized and thanked us for our patience which is why it gets 3 and not 2 stars. I also chose BJ's because it is a bar and assumed it would not be such a playground for children. WRONG! Kids everywhere...."
Kimberly R.,"SYLMAR, CA",101,155,19,4.0,9/9/2017,Great server and fun atmosphere. I love their buffalo chicken pizza so I'm going with great food also. Drinks are really tasty too.
Saul R.,"Santa Clarita, CA",12,1,,1.0,12/16/2017,"After 2 years of not coming back to this place... and yet again another horrible wait time.... first started with coming in to this god for saken place and ask for a table for 7 people.... after 20 minutes of standing around and ""waiting"" for our table.... the ""lovely"" hostess comes up to us and ask if we had been helped out?????? So I politely told her yes we had been waiting for 20 minutes for a table for 7... so she proceeded with telling us to wait again for another 15 minutes we were finally offered a table outside....  once sitting outside, another 15 minutes went by until my friend decided it's been too long and asked for our server and turns out no one even knew we were outside!!! Really???? The only reason why I'm giving this place a 1 star rating is because of the waitress that helps up out she had a 5 Star attitude, but still BJ's somehow manages to screw up another dinner once again..... still waiting to see how food is going to taste.... I'll give an update once food the comes out"
Mel B.,"Ontario, CA",5,2,,1.0,8/19/2017,Used the yelp ordering feature to order curbside pickup. Pulled up and call the restaurant to let them know we were outside. They could not locate the order and I was placed on hold. The call abruptly ended so I went inside. The host did not know what we ordered so they wanted to see a copy of the order so I provided it. After waiting for 15 minutes my order was ready. They need to work on customer service and not put the blame on the customer that an order was misplaced.
Gio Z.,"Sun Valley, CA",3,9,4,1.0,2/9/2017,"I'm really not a stickler for complaining, but tonight BJ's in Burbank really brought it out of me.  Me and my pregnant wife show up ready to eat. The building was practically empty at 10:30 on a Wednesday night. The waitress was nice, she took our order. But our food never came. Usually I don't mind waiting. But my impatient pregnant wife kept pointing out that it's taking longer than it should. 45 minutes pass and I started getting upset, and our food still hasn't come out. My wife confronted the waitress to let her know that we haven't gotten our food. We paid for our drinks as the manger took the time to speak to us. I can't remember what his name was but he was nice enough to get us a gift card and apologize. I'm not even sure if I'll come back here though."
Bernadette T.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",0,3,1,1.0,10/1/2017,"We went in on 9/30 around 11pm, Waitress was horrible we waited for our drinks for more then 25 minutes.She  bring our drinks It was warm we sent it all back then she still forget to bring a sprite for my daughter. Then we waited at least another half hour for food, We get serve one of of entree they didn't have why in a heck you waited all that time to tell us you don't have it. We're already pissed off!! Sliders was cold and I will never go back there again. As we were leaving there were a group celebrating there Bday there they also had a horrible experience that it took 45 min for there drinks. DO NOT GO THERE!!!!!!"
Amanda W.,"Los Angeles, CA",1192,242,1146,4.0,4/6/2017,"Pretty good service and decent food. Nothing special/foodie about it, but good. I got the all he tuna salad and it was edible. The pizookie was to die for though. Like it's a pretty basic place, with eh food, but if you're hungry enough and you want some dang good cookie, this one's for you. I'm very healthy so I had to order a salad basically, but I'm sure the chicken tenders (which my boyfriend ordered!), nachos, burgers, and more are delicious. Bon appetite."
Toni D.,"Studio City, CA",10,15,3,3.0,1/1/2017,"Where do I start? I'm going to be generous and give this place a 3 because of it being New Year's Day, when in reality a 2 would suffice.  The service: From the very beginning at the hostess stand was below mediocre. There was a 20-25 minute wait that turned into a 35 min wait. That's not the problem. There were at least 12 tables open yet 20 people waiting to be seated. None of the 4 people at the hostess stand had a welcoming attitude. Then I noticed people after me were being set first. Annoying.  The waitress: For whatever reason the waitress had a new hire shadowing her (the standards must be really low). She was sweet but not great at what she does. But then again maybe she was just busy.... but still you're a waitress. Another waitress had to bring me silverware and she acted as if I'd ruined her day.  Outside of taking my order, she checked on me once which I then asked for my check. It took 10 minutes to get it. Then I have her my card right away... another 10 mins. It was really difficult to only tip her 20% of the check (because it was a $25 check). I normally would leave at least 50% if not a 100% tip for such a small check (especially since it's the holidays).  The guy shadowing though, seems like he will be great at serving. He came by a few times on his own accord while walking by following the other waitress.  The food: While didn't expect a Michelin experience the food was very basic and tasted like something from a cafeteria. My 9 year old said that this place deserved only 2 stars because of the long wait and basic tasting food.  Anyway... I'm sure there's an excuse for the experience I had, but unfortunately I won't ever be back to find out."
Latisha P.,"Los Angeles, CA",407,661,1227,2.0,12/1/2015,"Now the Pizookie disappoints me and that's really the only reason I'd come here.  FOOD  Brussel sprouts (3 stars): Pretty good appetizer. The sauce goes well with it.  Chicken burger-lettuce wrapped (2 stars): can you give me a smaller piece of chicken breast??? Seriously like 4 slices on there...ridiculous.  Mahi mahi with shrimp (3 stars): Fish was overcooked, tough on the outside. Shrimp were cooked well though. Flavors were good. DESSERT Pizookie (2 stars): Used to be so good! Now they put the thinnest cookie layer and most of it ends up getting burnt to the pan so you have to try and scrape it off! So disappointed! Before I had to ask for extra ice cream since they had more cookie, now I need way more cookie   SERVICE (3 stars) Came on a Saturday night and they took our party of 7 in about 10 minutes. Our waiter was really nice but it took FOREVER for the food to come out!  ATMOSPHERE Lots of room and tables, good place to go if you're going to watch a game.  PARKING Self parking if you go up the steep hill to park on the top of the parking garage. Otherwise they have valet."
Raul A.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,14,14,5.0,2/27/2017,I've been here about three times all three times have been great different servers every time and great service from all three sometimes they are really busy and you might wait a little longer for a refill but they will come as soon as they can especially when they have big groups to take care of so it's understandable
K W.,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",0,19,1,3.0,9/10/2017,"The waitress was amazing! However, the food was okay :-) although the cobb salad was good and my husband once again enjoy the spaghetti and meatballs our onion rings had to be sent back twice because they were cold. But like I said the waitress did her job and made sure that we didn't pay for the onion rings. And we will go back and give them another chance."
Victor C.,"Henderson, NV",346,9,,2.0,8/26/2017,The wait for a take out order is ridiculous!!! Placed the order and paid for it online  and had to wait an extra half hr AFTER the time it was supposed to be ready. The customer service was bad by everyone on the front end. Very disappointed.
Steve W.,"Upland, CA",1,54,21,3.0,4/16/2017,"3 cons: the bathrooms were horrid. Walls dirty and bins overfilled  when we arrived the gentleman who greeted us was rude and unfriendly.   Then on the way out I bought 2 6packs to go for $21.  I gave $25 and the reply was, ""do you need change?.. If so I have to go get it from the bar""...YES, MOVE YOUR BUTT 25FT PLEASE. Pros: food was delicious. We ordered different plays for all 10 of us and they were great.  Aaron gave us great service and checked on us many times.  The place is trendy and comfortable.   Bill was about , $20 per person out the door."
Susan F.,"Rosamond, CA",5,1,,1.0,10/22/2017,"This place is horrible. We went 10/21/17 to BJ's in Burbank, we have always loved their food, not this time. I realize they were very busy that night, but that is no excuse for bad service and bad food. My daughter had the steak and it was so raw it should have been sent back. We had waited an hour for our food and she didn't want to wait any more. I had the prime rib sandwich with au jus sauce. My sandwich came without the au jus, I asked three times for the sauce and when it came it was cold and I was done. If I could give negative stars I would. This was my daughters birthday dinner. What a disappointment."
David B.,"Los Angeles, CA",25,17,18,4.0,4/11/2017,"The salmon was decent. The jambalaya my wife had was better than expected. My three girls had had spaghetti, my littlest loves spaghetti no matter it taste like. My middle child had chicken tenders and fries, they were very meaty. My eldest had chicken Alfredo, again the meat was juicy and tender, but I can't say much about the pasta and Alfredo sauce. The restrooms were a mess, both men and woman's, we had to ask the manager to stock the tissue cause they were out on this particular night."
Artin Z.,"Burbank, CA",9,10,2,4.0,11/20/2017,"It's a nice restaurant,excellent food,great service . I like their buffalo chicken pizza . I also like their sandwiches!!"
Mariel F.,"Chicago, IL",17,47,14,3.0,12/29/2016,"We got there on a late Friday night and since it was the closest open restaurant from the hotel we decided to give it a try. The menu is extensive, there are different options so I would say there is something for everyone. The food was nothing extraordinary, personally the food did not have any seasoning or anything special to justify the prices. Service was ok, a little bit slow but it was a Friday night. Not sure I would return, but if I do it would definitely be any other day but Friday night."
Jaime V.,"Burbank, CA",6,11,5,1.0,7/8/2017,"First off we waited 25 minutes in the front waiting area with no A/C, it was super hot. Then we waited for 15 minutes before anyone came to ask if we wanted anything to drink and take our order. We were told that we were sat at a table without a waiter so the bar tender came over to take our order. The table that was sat behind us arrived about 10 minutes after we did a they were eating way before we were. When we got our food they forgot the kids fries, I ordered the ribeye medium rare and it was not. It was super dry. I ate it because I was hungry but it was a bit salty. My wife ordered the spicy peanut chicken with sobe noodles. I do not recommend it, it's a bad rendition of chicken chow mein. We also had to get up and get our own condiments from other vacant tables. To top it off there was an annoying fly going around. The bar tender was nice, but was trying to cover the bar and attend us. Don't think I will come back here!"
Narek A.,"Burbank, CA",0,20,,3.0,10/19/2017,The chicken is usually not cooked well. 2 out of 3 times when I go there. I like the one in Glendale which is only 10 minutes away.
