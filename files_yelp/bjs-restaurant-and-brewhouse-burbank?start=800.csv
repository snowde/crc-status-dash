Cat A.,"Plano, TX",10,120,19,5.0,7/31/2009,"OMG the pizookie is SO GOOD.  For anyone who is a fan of chocolate & warm soft desserts, you cannot go wrong with the Cookies and Cream pizookie. It is soo good mmm my mouth is watering right now... It's $6, but well worth it!   Their pizza is good too...but I don't come here for that.  It's all about the pizookie."
Jessica K.,"Los Angeles, CA",166,253,111,3.0,11/11/2008,"I magically got a coupon in the mail and we figured what the heck, lets check it out..They have BJ's in TX but i kept forgetting* that there was one so close to us out here in Burbank. We had to park on the second level garage, BUT be careful driving up the steep ramp to park - dont get hit by a car and dont hit another car, it was a little tight. The place was packed for Football Sunday-we had to wait about 20 mins before getting seated at this god awful table that was basically in a walkway, im a booth kinda girl..**Heads up, you can call ahead for a table and if we come here again I will definitely call ahead**  I got the Jambalaya with shrimp, blackened chicken and chicken-andouille sausage on top of a bed of dirty rice..Whewee! it was spicy, and trust me I LOVE SPICY, BUT not this spicy and salty Bleh.  The service was decent but the food was mediocre, nothing too great. I do like that they have a large alcohol selection though. So, I think next time we will come here for beers and apps, not dinner.."
Gina G.,"Cleveland, OH",561,465,232,4.0,9/15/2008,"I am a self-admitted BJ's junkie. I have a pretty set menu of items I order when I come here.  The Field of Greens Salad. I order it with blackened chicken. The mix of the baby greens, chicken, candied pecans, red onions, mandarin oranges, feta cheese, roasted red bell peppers and yummy raspberry vinegarette is out of this world!  I also love the crispy appetizer pizzas and the chicken pot stickers! Yum!  I almost always try to save room for a chocolate chip Pizooki. Best shit ever!"
Tommy c.,"Los Angeles, CA",211,16,16,3.0,11/29/2008,"ahhhh another wonderful night of eatery with the friends.  This trip though, i actually tried the beers.. not a beer person here. The taste of it wasnt for me i guess. I shall stick to my mixed drinks and shots. hahah. On this trip, i decided to get the same thing as my last, a nice two topping mini pizza which was half off because of happy hour, and a plate of wings. The pizza was soooo good. i tried some of walters Cheeseburger pizza, damn! that was a pretty good pizza. My stomach was starting to hurt a little because of the beers but i was fine after a few burps. ahah This place overall is pretty chill. a cool place to grab a bite and watch a few games. The waiter was ok, took a few for refills and such but they were pretty chill about having 5 of us at the bar area. i personally like the glendale one. if you like beer, this is your spot. Later days."
Sean W.,"Burbank, Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,4/3/2013,On a Saturday night at 5:00pm this BJ'S was seriously understaffed. The wait took 45 min when half the restaurant was empty. A large party behind us was seated  first and got their food first 30 min before us. We were at this BJ'S for an hour and a half before we got our food. And that's after talking to the manager twice. I will not    be coming back.
Siddeeqah B.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",13,16,,4.0,9/3/2010,I like BJs. It's got ok food something you can bare to eat.  I'ts a great place to have a beer and watch the game.
Erin H.,"Santa Monica, CA",238,171,17,2.0,7/5/2008,"Yep, still sucks.  I mean, as long as you don't eat food here you'll be OK. But if you're one of those people who goes to restaurants to eat you might be a little upset.  Even the famed Pizookie doesn't do it for me. It's just abig grocery store bakery cookie with a scoop of ice cream. Don't try to tell me you just baked that thing and that's why it's warm. I know what a microwave is."
Ella B.,"Los Olivos, CA",26,628,12,1.0,7/20/2008,"We met up with my friend after going through the IKEA maze.  We were starving and pizza seemed like a good idea.  We were seated quickly and that was about all the quickness for the night.   Elizabeth A. was our server.  We were a group of 3 seated next to a group of 33!  ok, maybe not 33, but something to the tune of 10 adults and 5 kids.  maybe our server was a little overwhelmed and maybe she was new, but really, that's irrelevant b/c that's not my problem, it's hers.  just like when i am having a crappy day, it's my problem, not my clients.  see, i'm fair! anyway, so *finally* our waters were brought out... by another server mind you.   *finally* Elizabeth A. decides to take our order.  We ordered beers first.    i was nearly done with my beer when Elizabeth A. *finally* decides that she's at work after all and takes our food orders.  We ordered, one spinach artichoke pizza, one chicken dish and shrimp tacos.   the food came out promptly and each of them were decent.  the pizza wasn't half bad, and if I were judging them solely on food, i would go 4 stars.  The beers were pretty decent too.  4 stars for beer.  We also order the apple cobbler thingy for dessert and it was ok.  not bad, but not as fantastic as the description in the menu would have you  believe.   the service was spotty throughout the whole night and at one point it was like Lizzie realised that she was sucking ass so she was trying to be our friend.  yeah, thanks but no thanks, you're my server and all i really expect you to do is bring my food and bring it with manners, not this ""yah""  ""what's up?"" bullsh*t.  m'kay?  you don't say ""what's up?"" to a female customer that already doesn't like you, it doesn't work that i may find you cute.  try it with the guys, it may work better, in fact i'm sure it will work better.   I realise that i must be sounding like a stuck up little skank and I very well may be, but this is so cal, i'm far from being mean, yet.  anyway, the FINAL straw were two things (yeah, really the final two, b/c up till this point i was going to tip her).  1) she brought the bill and just dropped it off, no words, like ""whenever you're ready"", ""take your time""  or even: ""can i get you anything else?""  NO, NONE, ZIPPO, NADA.  really.  2) we wanted to split the cards and she grabbed the check and didn't ask us how we wanted to split it.  She grabbed it so fast WHILE I was still having dessert so i didn't have a chance to stop her.  and it may just be me, but i generally don't find it necessary nor desirable to chase down my server in order to pay my bill! so, she split it in 1/2 which was NOT THE WAY I WANTED IT DONE ELIZABETH A.  I wanted $20 on one and the rest on the other, capiche?  next time, ASK when you SEE two ccards in the holder.  it won't hurt to ask, really it's better to ask than to assume things. anyway, so when the bill came, i DIDN'T tip her b/c most of the night she didn't serve us.  yea, and i'm the customer that wrote you a nice little note so if you don't like it, try harder next time.  Bottom line: 4 stars for the beer & food. 3 stars for ambiance. 0 stars for service this review is based on service - if ya couldn't tell.... if you want deep dish pizza, i suggest take out...."
Jessica P.,"Sunland, CA",2,17,,4.0,10/21/2011,"Great food, polite staff... wonderful lunch specials!  Their hot wings are to die for and the spinach artichoke pizza will blow your mind."
Karen O.,"Canyon Country, CA",0,19,,2.0,2/17/2014,"We had family coming from several different areas (Long Beach, Santa Clarita, and Northridge) so this seemed like the perfect, convenient, something-for-everyone place to meet.  One person in our group said they hated BJ's, but we talked them into going there anyways.  After all, it's BJ's....they have TONS of stuff on their menu, there has to be something you want!  We talked him into coming there by promising a pizookie! The hostesses were great.  Friendly and helpful in picking a table with easy access for one person in our party who has some difficulty getting around.   Waiter came to our table immediately, and although he talked a mile a minute and mumbled which made him hard to understand, he was very friendly.  Drinks were fine.  Appetizer (Chicken Lettuce Wraps) was just okay. Waiter changed as our original waiter went home...but the new waiter was very nice and very personable.  He answered tons of questions. We ordered our food for the five of us.....and then we waited....and waited....and waited. We finally asked about our soup and salads that came with our order after about 25 minutes.  The waiter made an excuse about waiting for the soup, and then showed up about 5 minutes later with our soup/salad.  Cesar salad was blah.  Not much flavor in the dressing.   Our food came about 20 minutes after that.  Yes, we waited over 45 minutes for our food. Buffalo burger was cold.  Moroccan Salmon was cold.  Santa Fe Rolls were cold.  Pizza was cold.  Quesadilla was cold.  The only thing served to us that was hot were the beans that came with the quesadilla! One item was ordered with no avocado, but came with avocado.  The pizza which was supposed to have mushrooms, didn't even have the mushrooms.   Our meal was pathetic.  We started to send the food back, but the waiter didn't seem confident that we would get it back any time soon.  So, most of us ate the cold food.   Except for the one in our group who hadn't wanted to go there at all....he just sat and shook his head saying ""Told you so!"" and wouldn't even touch his pizza.    He couldn't get out of that place fast enough.  Skip the pazookie!  Not worth it! The waiter did send the manager to our table and after expressing our disappointment, she did comp the entire meal.  The ENTIRE meal.  We certainly didn't expect that! I do give her credit for accepting responsibility for the lousy meal, and that's why I gave two stars instead of one.  But we won't be going back.  Next time, we listen to the kid who likes everything, but hates BJ's!"
Artin F.,"Encino, CA",65,121,3,4.0,9/18/2011,"Even thou i don't live in Burbank anymore, the Burbank BJ's is still the best one. It's cozy, always pretty load and happening. Love sitting at the bar and watch a game."
Jenna W.,"TARZANA, CA",162,50,1,4.0,9/17/2013,Went last weekend and had a great time. The atmosphere is open and there is lots of energy and fun all around. Will return with friends again!
Adam G.,"Long Beach, CA",0,20,,5.0,2/7/2014,"I love the food at BJs, plenty of choices for varying diets (meat, vegetarian, etc) and everything I've had there has been delicious. They have a good selection of drinks as well, I enjoyed seeing items from many local/SoCal breweries on the list. The restaurant was a little loud due to a large, teenage birthday party nearby but even still it wasn't a bad experience by any means. Service was great, we'll definitely be back"
Alya G.,"Woodland Hills, CA",41,31,53,4.0,4/28/2009,"I have been to nearly all BJS breweries around LA and Ventura county so you may say I am a fan. I actually think that those places have no competition or anything alike which would also be a chain...Gordon Birch maybe but those are so rare. Their menu is huge and offers anything form wraps to steaks to soups to pastas name it they have it. Anyone in your group will probably be able to find something to the taste on the menu. Needless to mention they are famous for their pizzas and beers. They brew their own beers which are pretty good and have Belgian beer menu where you can find some pretty weird beers form all over the place ( please try the lambics yum!). As for pizza, it is supposed to be ""Chicago style"" and is pretty damn good , although as I have heard from people who actually lived in Chicago is nothing like pizzas over there. The only downfall I can mention about the place is the fact that their dessert menu is non existent. Sorry, Pizzuky just doesn't cut it for me. BJS is great for groups, casual parties, or just drop in for dinner, although you might have to wait a while to be seated. So call and try to reserve!"
Jessie S.,"Burbank, CA",10,206,24,4.0,5/17/2010,"I know I've mentioned in previous reviews that I usually only go for pizza with medium, chewy crust and lots of drippy cheese that you can fold in half and stuff in you face.  This is the very clear exception to that rule.  I cannot vouch for the other food on BJ's menu - though my tablemate and fellow yelper Kim H. got a roast chicken meal which apparently was horrible - but I can say this: their deep dish Mediterranean pizza makes me happy.  Very, very happy.  A 'mini' pizza is the perfect size to fill me up, I got a 'small' last night and am having the leftovers for lunch today.  Don't trust your server to give you an accurate size estimate, three others at my table got 'medium' sizes and will be eating pizza for the rest of eternity.  Not that that's a bad thing, I assure you. So by merit of their pizza, four stars.  Everything else...couldn't tell ya.  I almost ordered a sandwich until I realized it was the same price as the pizza for something I could probably assemble at home."
Cindy R.,"Granada Hills, CA",15,85,1,4.0,6/24/2011,Love BJ's!!! They have a good deal with samples of beers!!!
Marci P.,"Chatsworth, CA",8,57,13,2.0,7/4/2010,"I went to BJ's a few nights ago on a week night. We got there about 7:30 pm and it was really noisy. We chose to eat outside- very pleasant with a great view of the freshly mowed grass and the parking lot. We had a nice server and split a mini pizza and turkey club sandwich. It took a while but both were good, not great, and reasonably priced.  I then went into the women's bathroom and, to my disgust, saw a fairly large roach. I thought I better step on it to preserve the evidence cuz I was blown away that a major chain restaurant would have bugs crawling around in plain site. (sorry animal lovers!) I then went to tell the manager of my find. He told me he was sorry but since roaches only go where there is food it must have been a 'water bug'. I mean really- who the fuck cares?-it was a big bug strolling around in your restaurant! He then proceeded to tell me he would take care of it and thanked me for telling him about it. That's it. WTF? Why not offer me 10% off or a free pizookie for the trauma I went thru? I thought that was crummy customer service and I couldn't believe he didn't offer me anything for my bad experience. I liked the food and I liked the service but don't tell me it's ok to have a bug in your restaurant just cuz it's a water bug!?!  As we were leaving we saw the manager and he thanked me again for telling him about the bug. I told him 'You're welcome and make sure you read the review I'm going to write on Yelp'....."
Damir T.,"Burbank, CA",14,10,,1.0,6/11/2012,"Bad service bad food bad beer bartender was short uninterested and didnt know whats on the specials menu had beer it was bad stale and old i got sick from it after first sip, so sad they have not closed this place by now and opened Something fun."
Billy J.,"Chicago, IL",0,11,,1.0,8/6/2012,"I was just there 5 minutes ago. I brought my family. We sat down and we sat there for exactly 15 min and watched everyone get served. We didn't even get a drink order nor did any server introduce themselves. We got up to leave and the greeter who sat us and who I had a 3 min convo with earlier about a high chair, smiled and said have a nice day, lol. She just saw us sit down. Our table was right next to the front. She kept passing us and she noticed us the entire time. I thought for sure, she would ask if everything was okay. Maybe she knew their service sucked and was embarrassed. Lol what a joke of a place. I will never go there again."
Carl F.,"Glendale, CA",25,60,,3.0,7/9/2011,i love drinking beer here but the service stinks a lot of the time. Went with my 30 yr old pal from Germany. He had a passport. The manager told us no way. And he didnt care where he was from. Very rude things to say. So we left. Theres on in Glendale now with different managers that i will go to if im in the mood for one of their beers.
