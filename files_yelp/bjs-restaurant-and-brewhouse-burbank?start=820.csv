Bridgyn O.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",178,121,10,4.0,6/27/2008,"Solid 4 stars, if you love you some deep dish pizza go here. I usually don;t stray far from the pizza and avocado egg rolls which are super good too! They brew there own beers and I love the Jeremiah red mm mm super tasty red beer. I have not had much else beside the pizza here because i mean why fix something if it's not broke. If you are a cookie lover the pizookie is gonna blow your mind. A giant hot right out of the oven cookie with vanilla ice cream on top MMMMMMMMMMMMM.  Gets real crowded on weekends so be prepared to wait a little, and it does get a little loud if you sit near the bar, well actually the whole restaurant is pretty loud but great food!"
Adam C.,"Burbank, CA",13,68,,4.0,10/12/2010,"Place has great food, but the evening bartender has no idea how to make drinks. I was with a group of three and he had to remake our drinks several times before getting it right. Otherwise its a pretty good place to hang out."
Griz M.,"Culver - West, CA",17,27,,4.0,6/14/2011,Love the variety on the menu and the pizzas are just so delicious!. What's best is that I can order for delivery too! at   for any of those who dont know.  Yummy!
Ellie L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,35,14,2.0,12/26/2012,"BJ's is a great restaurant and honestly, who can resist those pazookies?! However, after my experience there last week, I won't be going to this BJ's again.  BJ's is always ridiculously busy, and this one charges for valet parking. Limited self-parking, but the whole parking lot is always full. I went here and ordered the California burger medium well (which is a little pink in the center) - avocado, chipotle mayo, creamy ranch - sounds great! I added bacon  However, I made it clear to my server that I wanted ONLY BACON, NO CHEESE. So you can imagine my disappointment when out comes my burger and I'm staring straight at a cheeseburger.  It took extremely long to get our server to come over, and I told him, ""I don't think this is my burger."" he stares at it and goes, ""no it's not"" and took it back with the promise to get me the right burger.  A couple minutes later, the manager heard what happened and came over to apologize. As the manager is apologizing, our server came out with my (correct) burger.  however, now my steak fries had changed to the string fries. I politely noted this and the server reached to take my burger back again.  The manager stopped him and told him to leave my burger and just bring me a side of the correct fries.   I was unimpressed with the service or how long it took to get my order delivered correctly.  It was hard to get a hold of our server the rest of the night and it took about 10 minutes for him to come pick up our check."
James S.,"Los Angeles, CA",561,1194,627,5.0,1/6/2009,"This is our regular haunt me and my lovely movie buddy We usually catch a coupe drinks before we head out to the Burbank AMC16 just up the block Lately, we have gone every single week either on a friday or saturday to drink up a storm before heading into the theaters. I know why even watch a movie, when you being entertained at the bar? Well we are movie buffs and have a long list of movies to see plus we are tanks! We can handle our own or we like to think we can.  Our favorite and regular bartender is Matt he is tall and caucasian if you were wondering when you stroll in and head over to the bar. That man right there can make a killer Bloody Mary, actually he mixes his own ingredients and not what BJ standards prefer which is bogus because his are awesome. Go check it out and you might see me and my movie buddy one of these days drinking it up, we arent hard to spot. Loud and Sexy"
Michael A.,"Glendale, CA",4,11,19,3.0,5/6/2013,one of you typical rest. chain. service was good. beer sampler was pretty decent. overall all the food was good nothing too great. the best part as usual was the poozokie (oreo). just make sure to get one if you go.
kimberly a.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,,4.0,11/22/2010,"The food is great especially the spinach dip, parmesan crusted chicken and pizookies. Don't expect the best service, but that's to be expected at a chain restaurant.  One problem: Do not get take out at this location! They completely rip you off when you get take out here.  Sometimes when we get home and finally see our food, it is laughable. The veggies I got one time with my meal were 4 carrots. At times, it can be almost half the food.  It's kind of funny because they think they have this big secret that you won't figure out....I eat at the restaurant so I know how much a serving size is there vs when you get take out, and the difference is ridiculous.  I realize they are probably trying to save money, but they are losing my money because now I will only eat in the restaurant. Unfortunately, I don't really have time to do that so I just get food somewhere else.    Hopefully they will read this and it will change. I will try again in a few months to see if it's gotten better, but until then I'm only eating at the restaurant. It's just happened too many times."
Kevin F.,"Los Angeles, CA",196,172,4,4.0,10/13/2007,"I've been to a few different BJs locations, but I have to say this one is my favorite.  The food is pretty much the same, but the atmosphere is much better than the others I've been to.  It is a big place, and generally busy in the evening.  Even though it is crowded, since it is a big place the wait usually isn't very long.  They have a bar area with open seating as well, so if there is an empty table there you can grab it.   The food here has always been good.  I've had the pizza, french dip, BBQ beef, meatloaf and probably a few other things I can't remember at the moment.  The pizza is thick crust, which I'm a big fan of.  The buffalo chicken pizza is my favorite.  Nice and spicy and served with a side of ranch dressing.  They have a good selection of appetizers (I've had the nachos, wings and chicken fingers, all good) and desserts.  Their specialty dessert is the pizookie.  Mmmmm...pizookie...a big warm cookie with ice cream on top.   They also serve a variety of microbrew and specialty beers.  They have televisions showing sports throughout the restaurant so you can follow the games while you eat and/or drink (although you can't hear them because they're usually playing music).   My only complaint with this BJs is the parking.  You either have to valet park, which I'm against, or you have to drive up a 45 degree incline and fight for one of the limited spaces on top of the parking structure.   One last note for the fellas, for some reason there are usually a lot of attractive women at this location."
Aimee S.,"Whittier, CA",291,278,5,2.0,2/3/2007,"If it wasn't for my delicious Pizookie and my friend's Poison Apple (which I only tasted, but seriously, delicious), this place would get NEGATIVE stars for its slow and crappy service.   I hadn't been to a BJ's in a long time and when Maria called me up and said ""Pizookie"" I said ""what time"".   Even though it was chilly outside, they had heaters on the patio and we were all starving so we said outside since the wait was less.  Big mistake.  We knew we were in trouble when we overheard our waiter tell the table next to us ""I'm sorry, we're really busy"".  No $h*t.  Every restaurant on a Friday night is busy.  No excuse for bad service. Anyway we ordered the Avocado Egg Rolls that just melt in your mouth.  Yum.  But our waiter sent some PMS-ing chick to tease us with them.  She literally waved them in our drooling faces and said, ""Um, lemme check..."" and walked away.  Evil wench.  Luckily she came back and my friend said ""Are you back to tease us again?"" in an obvious joking manner.  She responded again PMS-y ""Well I had to check otherwise I'd get in trouble"".  A few minutes later our order starts to come out.  Again our waiter sends another stick-up-her-ass assistant who mumbles what she has and none of us understand so we ask ""What was that?"".  She:  SIGHS (!!!) and says ""BBQ Chicken Pizza and Calzone"".  Oh.  BBQ Chicken right here.  Sheesh.  And my BBQ Chicken Pizza was just okay.  I prefer CPK's.   Also, Maria had what she called ""Berry Beer"" and it tasted...yucky.   We all get our food and luckily having great conversation and having fun complaining about our shitty service.  But when my friends try to order another round of their drinks (Cadillac Margs, yummy!, and the above mentioned Poison Apple) it took FOREVER.  And he got the Poison Apple wrong.   After what seemed like an hour after we asked for our check, he apologized for the poor service and complained that there was supposed to be 3 servers out on the patio but 2 had called out sick and he was left alone.  Sorry, not our problem.  They shouldn't have sat so many tables outside then!   But yay $2.25 valet."
Cathy G.,"Burbank, CA",294,205,56,4.0,12/3/2008,"Back in the day, my ex and i used to frequent this place on a weekly basis. It was because of these frequent visits that I unabashedly gained 10lbs solely from the baked potatoes and their vast drinks menu. It came to a point where I found myself turning into potato, the carb intake in this place is criminal enough to make Richard Simmons commit murder.  Since then, I've gained a new boyfriend and a better handle on my self control and limit my visits here to once every month or couple of months, depending on the Lakers game schedule. I've also gain a high tolerance of beer and everything carb related. I usually stick to my fail proof dishes -- the bbq/ranch chicken salad, the grilled burger melt, the crispy chicken, cuban burger, the blackened chicken potato, the great white pizza, and the bbq chicken pizza. Best beer yet is the Jeremiah Red mixed with Berry Cider. Jeremiah Red is also great by itself, as is the berry cider. As someone so kindly pointed out, pizzas are half off during Happy Hour 3-7pm. Appetizers are $2 off and I think it's $2 off the beer too(I'll have to check that).  All so good. Damn, I think I just gained 5lbs writing this."
Chris O.,"Glendale, CA",2,27,,2.0,7/30/2010,"BJs isn't the kind of place you want to eat it every day. The prices are a bit high for the quality of food that you get. The service is so-so. You'll get your food, but you might have to wait awhile. And if you ask for extra tomatoes on your pizza, you might not get as many as you hoped for, but it'll still taste good.  That said, I'd still go to BJs every once in a while if someone else in my party suggested it. I'd be game, 'cause you can't ask for everything.  EXCEPT that the last time I tried to go there for lunch with a friend, the valet guy wouldn't let me park my car on my own. This is a deal breaker. I've been to this BJs several times. The valet guys are usually totally cool. I don't know if BJs or the valet company changed their policy, or maybe I just got a dumb guy, but he said I absolutely had to valet park. So we left and ate somewhere else. And I won't be returning, because there are tons of other restaurants in Burbank that won't force me to valet park, and they have better food."
Felicia C.,"Redwood City, CA",344,430,124,3.0,3/8/2008,"Everyone's been to BJ's, blah blah blah. Who cares. I just gotta make a quick comment about their delivery service. The Burbank BJ's only delivers to places in Burbank, pretty much until you hit the production studios and such. Luckily, I worked in this area so BJ's was a great place when work was busy during the day and I didn't have time to drive over and pick up food. BJ's has this great thing where they print your order on labels and then attach said labels to the box so you always know what's what. These labels also say what you modified with the order, again, making life a whole lot easier when you're picking up food for busy, picky people. Maybe I'm just impressed by stupid things but those labels are awesome.  ...And the food's decent too."
Ryan F.,"Round Hill, VA",1,17,2,4.0,8/10/2011,I've been here several times.  Its a good place for pretty good beer and really good food.  The happy hour deal is OK.  Only a buck off per beer.  As empty as it was they should may be half price to drum up more business.(Just a suggestion)  The apps are $2 off and personal pizzas are half price.  The pizzas are deep dish and are awsome.  Meaghan was the bartender and she was great.  Will be going back!
Priscila C.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",128,3,1,1.0,5/30/2014,"Took my best friend here for her graduation dinner right after her graduation. We were meeting other people there who had gotten a table for us. We sat down and no server came over to our table for five minutes to get us drinks. I ordered a lemonade and everyone else got water and our server couldn't even remember who got the lemonade. Then she disappeared again for another five minutes, came back, and asked us if we wanted appetizers. We weren't even finished ordering when she started to walk away and I had to shout for her to come back. We then ordered our food and received it about 15 minutes after and I turned around and looked behind me and saw a cockroach!! So disgusting!! We told a server and he came over, climbed on the booth, and crushed it and said ""I hope you don't see anymore."" WHAT?! We shouldn't have even seen one!! Our server said she would send a manager right away. A man in a button up came over and just said ""so who saw something over here?"" Didn't introduce himself at all. Then he said ""sorry about that, hope you don't have to see anymore"" and walks away!!! Our server was so embarrassed and made him comp our of our entrees. What a horrible experience and terrible management."
Gregg F.,"Los Angeles, CA",21,78,2,1.0,11/2/2007,"Blerg...  First thing's first, What has two thumbs and doesn't like BJ's? *points at self with both thumbs* THIS GUY! I really haven't ever LOVED BJ's Restaurant Brewery, but the beer has brought me back a few times. But this location is crap crap crap. After waiting somewhere in the vein of 30 minutes for our disinterested waiter to come take our drink order we knew we weren't in for a good day. 20 minutes after my girlfriend had received her cocktail I finally got my pint of beer and he took our food orders. So we were approaching an hour in the restaurant without so much as a sip of beer and not even a hint of some food. Here's a quick rundown of what happened thereafter. He returned with our appetizer and dinner at the same time. Okay, I'll let that pass. He didn't come back to our table until my girlfriend was pushing the somewhat warm lettuce of her salad around her plate with her fork out of frustration that we'd not been offered a pizookie yet. The Waiter kind-of threw down the check in the little folio and walked away without offering us dessert. Wow... I worked food service for almost 6 years and have never left a tip under 15% except this once. The service I was given justified my $0.47 tip made up of random coins from my pocket. Sorry dude, but food service just ain't your calling."
Alan P.,"Granada Hills, CA",1,82,,2.0,10/11/2011,"bottom line, this particular BJ's has some of the worst service I have ever experienced at any restaurant, particularly BJ's! Just had lunch there a couple of days ago, the restaurant was relatively empty and the waiters were running around acting like if they were actually busy. I have no idea how people with ridiculously bad customer service can actually work at restaurants.  The food, same as usual, in fact I believe it to be rather mediocre for the prices they charge, beer was good, but even the bartender had an attitude problem. Pros: pizza, appetizers, beer Cons: service, employees with horrible attitude problems"
Marcus S.,"Altadena, CA",45,49,,3.0,7/4/2006,"Party Pizookie. Thats really all that you need to know. And if you don't know what that means, well then let me educate you. Imagine a cookie so large that if sent into space it would disturb the tide and currents of our oceans. SO large that if placed in front of the sun, it rays would be blocked and would send our world into ice and darkness. SO EFFING LARGE, that if Rosie o' Donnell ate out the center she could use it as a hula hoop. Well i might be exagerating but a pizookie is a rather large cookie (freshly baked mind you) served with a generous helping of ice cream and more than enough sugar to keep you bouncing off the walls through all hours of the night. Other than that though? The food selection is only meh. Their pizza is great deep dish style, but very small, and very expensive. On the whole to me it dosen't seem like the price matches up to the food they serve. It's really one of those situations where you might end up paying like 9 bucks or something for spaghetti or 8 for a slice of pizza.  While it should be noted that their food does taste really good (and the pizookie is quite possibly the 8th wonder of the world) the price is effing steep."
Jesse H.,"Studio City, CA",1300,57,33,4.0,9/2/2006,"I had heard great things about BJ's and decided to try it for lunch yesterday with a cousin.  We each ordered the mini pizzas and man they were off the charts good.   The atmosphere at this location is very much like any brewery/sports bar.  10+ tvs tuned to ESPN but without the sound on so you can carry on your own conversations.   My cousin ordered a drink and it took three more requests for it before they brought it, so that's very odd because I ordered a ceaser salad with my meal and they brought that out promptly.  For being a brewery you'd think they'd be more prompt with the beer.  But it came during the main course so it's no big deal.  The waitstaff is very friendly and the hostesses are cute too =). The place has items on the menu that make your mouth water whether you are on a diet or meat lover, vegetarian, or just stopping by for a snack or dessert.  I wish there was a location closer to me in the south bay, but it's worth the drive. Enjoy!"
Andy S.,"Venice, CA",325,143,40,4.0,12/26/2006,"LA has a ridiculous shortage of bars that are ""showing-the-game,"" which is, not necessarily to say ""sports bars."" In the year I've been in LA I've run up to BJ's several times to get my fix of Chicago Cubs and Bears action. Parking is free on the roof of the $2.50 valet lot. The beer is surprisingly good for a multi-venue moderately-chainy ""microbrewery."" -- they often have seasonal specials, although I'm generally happy with the IPA. My favorite is the Roast Beef Dip, with half a gigantic baked potato. I've always wanted to try the pizookie dessert (a cookie baked in a mini pan-pizza pan w/ ice cream), but I seem to always end up here alone! Only 4 stars because they claim to have chicago style pizza, and their deep dish is far from the real deal (no big surprise here)."
Chris U.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,29,2,3.0,6/7/2011,"5 stars service 1 star food that is not pizza 4 stars for the pizza and beer I have been here twice. First time got pizza and beer and everything was alright. Second time we got Nachos and Burgers. Worst ever. We actually sent it back for being served cold. Here I need to mention that the staff was super cool about it and tried to do everything they could to fix it, and for that I give them props. However, when the food was served again it was still not very good but we decided to just muscle through. So, if you go,  GET THE PIZZA  and you will be happy.  DO NOT GET THE BURGER.  Other info, portions are really big and the desserts look delicious but i have not ever had room leftover to try one."
