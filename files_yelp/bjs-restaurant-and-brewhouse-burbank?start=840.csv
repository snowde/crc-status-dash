Ralph A.,"Los Angeles, CA",16,25,,3.0,12/28/2010,"Oh yeahhhh! A nice sit-down restaurant, way to go BJ's! Pizookie is probably my only favorite thing. Food was a bit pricey and it wasn't good as I expected it to be. Place was too crowded. I went with my friends and we were pretty loud at the place. No one noticed us because the place was loud as well. Hahahahah. The servers were friendly. I had removed 2 stars because it was just ehhh how do I say it.. plain. Yeah. The restaurant and food was too plain in my taste. Nothing really special. I think my family or neighbor can cook better food than this. Oh wait, the pizookie is good. YOU HAVE TO TRY THAT!"
Arthur F.,"Los Angeles, CA",347,52,7,2.0,8/2/2010,"TOOK ME 25 YEARS TO GET A DRINK, terrible waitress, they comp'd the whole goddamn meal, woulda had a better time getting a route canal."
Andrea Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,,2.0,6/30/2012,Love bjs!  It was first at this location last night our waitress was terrible got our orders completely wrong. :(
Emily C.,Inland Empire,2,263,,3.0,4/1/2007,"The service was quite good.  It was a little slow, but very friendly and accomodating.  And when my calzone came out wrong, it wasn't entirely their fault... it turns out I ordered something that it was impossible for them to make.  But so they sent me out another one, and it was the exact same thing with a little motzarella added.  But the server made it all better when he gave us the drinks for free, didn't charge for my calzone, and then brought us a pazookie on the house.  I didn't get my calzone, but I got a ton of free stuff, and since I am a certified freegan, that makes this dining experience Alright In My Book. Plus, I saw a couple of pretty funny things while I was here. 1. A dude with super curly hair and then PERFECT eyebrows.  Come on.  You're not fooling anybody. 2. We were sitting outdoors, and there was a lady who went in and out and in and out pretty much all night long.  Near the end of the evening, I went in to utilize the ladies' room, and there she was again, going in, with one of her little friends!  Is that really necessary?   3. The lady at the table next to us with a facial piercing, a short skirt, and an AWESOME laugh that made me giggle every time I heard it.  Or maybe that was the berry cider talking.  Laughing.  Whatever. PS try the BBQ pizza."

Dan F.,"Burlington, VT",1,25,,2.0,7/23/2013,Anybody who rates this as 4 or 5 stars is on crack or was plain out wasted. It's a chain with medicre food.
Joe D.,"Burbank, CA",0,29,,3.0,5/4/2013,Great Pizza.  Just make sure you instruct the waiter to tell the cooks to cover the pizza with toppings!  For some reason they skimp big time on the toppings and you end up with a whole lot of dough.  I will be writing the corp office in this regard.
Tina V.,"Glendale, CA",0,6,,3.0,8/22/2013,"We've always enjoyed BJ's and the food.  Quality of service has started lacking, though.  Our appetizer arrived and we didn't have silverware.  Couldn't find our waiter for the longest time, so we asked another waiter for silverware.  He disappeared as well, we then asked someone else.  We continued waiting as our appetizer got cold.  He should've noticed right off that we didn't have silverware/napkins on the table as he seated us!  The stuffed mushrooms are yummy!  Don't really care for their salads.  Mediterranean pizza is delish!"
Aisha C.,"NORTH HOLLYWOOD, CA",88,4,,1.0,7/10/2013,"First, the valet is not great service. They were like texting while helping us with our car. Second, it was a 15 minute wait to eat outside even though when we walked in we saw plenty of open tables. Third, my dad ordered the salmon and it smelled super gross and tasted awful. It looked like super undercooked or old or something, and the vegetables were cold. My brother's ribs were dry, and my potato was mediocre. The service took a long time to deliver the food too. Only good thing I can say about this place is the service but the food makes it not worth going."
Byron L.,"Glendale, CA",27,14,,5.0,8/15/2011,"My friend brought me here on a Sunday night and the atmosphere was great and the food was amazing. Cimmon was our server and was exremely attentive and welcoming. Our appetizer combo plate had run out of spring rolls and she quickly advised us and offered alternatives. No delays in food and our salads were delicious, great experience for a sunday night."
Gina Q.,"Whittier, CA",17,705,136,4.0,10/3/2007,"There's nothing like coming to BJ's to get some yummy salads and take in the sports bar atmosphere. After an afternoon at the Ellen show, we came here in an attempt to avoid the after work traffic on the way home. We had already partook of some Pink's hot dogs, so we were feeling like we needed to eat something light. My friend ordered the Santa Fe Salad. She thought the portions of her chicken were appropriate and really loved the thick avocado slices. I ordered the BBQ chopped salad. It was very tasty. Any salad with black beans and I'm there. The lettuce was finely chopped. It reminded me of how California Pizza Kitchen chops their salads. You get plenty of lettuce in addition to the toppings. Nicole G. is correct in saying that the salads are huge.  Our server was attentive and did a great job as the amount of people increased inside the restaurant. If this B.J.'s was near me, I would come here again. Although, I would make mental note of the small amount of self-parking in the area. There is a parking garage for the restaurant, but it also shares spaces with a nearby business. If you get here during the dinner rush, I would probably recommend the valet parking available."
Amanda N.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,22,,1.0,7/17/2013,"Terrible service, from a waiter who I guess didn't care that we weren't a celebrity, so he ignored us, to the BURNT PAZOOKIE! How the heck do you burn the best thing on the menu and then serve it?!?!? Shame!"
Rhonda C.,"Sylmar, CA",51,13,,2.0,2/11/2013,"I had eaten at BJ's once before - We were seated in an alcove at a large round table next to a door to the patio dining area.  It was cold out (it was April) and the constantly opening door made it cold inside.  It was not diners who were coming in and out, but employees - management could not be bothered to seat us elsewhere even though we asked.  There was also an unpleasant smell.  I ordered the Tuscany Pasta with grilled chicken that evening - what came was burnt chicken on a bed of pale angel hair pasta.  There were pale tomatoes, which tasted acidy.  To give credit, the waitress brought parma cheese, garlic salt, etc, immediately and exchanged the burnt chix for a fresh piece, so I figured it was a one time thing.   Last night we had a family dinner, and ended up at BJ's.  We ordered our drinks and an appetizer from one waitress who handed us off to another due to required breaks.  She seemed to have it together and was very attentive and nice - we did not see her for the rest of the evening - we were there for 2 1/2 more hours.  The second waitress seemed to be lack luster and apathetic - took our order and went along her way.  It took almost 45 min for a third server to bring our soups (4 ordered soup - 3 soups arrived).  He brusquely served us and when asked about the 4th soup, he said ""let me get your server"" and walked away. . .it was about 15 minutes before our server showed up and by that time the main course came out.  When I asked about my soup she stared blankly and asked what kind of soup was it. . .she was not one of the two waitress serving the entree's and was just standing there.  One of the other servers was bubbly and apologized and explained the kitchen ran out and was making more!!!  But by that time I didn't want it - why would I?  my main entree was there!!!  My entree was Tuscan angel haired pasta and remembering what happened the last time, I ordered it with grilled salmon.  It was burnt to a crisp!!!!  I immediately called it to the servers attention and she again stood there.  The thin blond bubbly one whisked it away immediately and said it would be fixed.  I was hungry and annoyed!!!  The manager came over and kept asking if I wanted the soup.  Of course not - I just want my food already!!!  but he insisted I wanted the soup, so I would have soup!!!  The main entree came back out within 5 min, salmon was perfect this time, but pasta was missing peppers and pine nuts. . .I decided enough was enough and asked Apathetic waitress for garlic - she left and came back to ask whether whole or powder. . .Bubbly girl came back and gave me both.  Manager came again to say he was sorry, and offered a couple of deserts for free.  Great - my choices were pizookies with ice cream and a berry crumble with ice cream.  Apathetic waitress came back to take our dessert order - my children asked her regarding anything sugar free for desserts - She said ""ice cream"".  When my kids said, no - she is diabetic, anything else - Apathetic girl turned and walked away.  Then turned around, said ""i'll ask the manager"" and walked away.  Bubbly blond girl served us the one dessert we did order.  We never saw the manager again and when I tried to get Apathetic servers attention, she was in the middle of a group of servers, wildly waving her hands, while the other servers ackwardly glanced in our direction.  Finally she brought the bill and never came back for it.   I don't think we will ever visit again. . ."
Cheryl V.,"Los Angeles, CA",157,192,,4.0,7/28/2010,"Went last night with friends and, despite being really busy, our server (Heather) was amazing!  So friendly and didn't bother us ... made sure everything went well.  THANKS!!!!"
Moriah R.,"Burbank, CA",3,20,,3.0,12/22/2012,i think its stupid that they charge you parking. the steak is way to expensive. black angus steak is cheaper and bigger and BETTER TASTING. food is ok but to pricey for the taste.
Jesus S.,"Sun Valley, CA",0,5,2,4.0,10/8/2010,Great place to eat! Don't forget to try the spinich dip :D!
Sam G.,"Ventura, CA",0,3,1,4.0,1/27/2011,"Service, food great. Forced to valet park eventhough they have huge lot."
Jeff A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,1.0,1/16/2013,Called to ask if they did delivery the lady right away said no right away then asked why and in gibberish gave a weird answer only on weekdays (which it is a weekday?) and then proceeded to just hangup while I was saying thank you
Alex K.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",4,7,2,4.0,9/28/2012,Great place! Excellent costumer service! A little of bit noisy. But food is great!
Chelsea V.,"Burbank, CA",481,293,61,4.0,1/2/2008,"BOMB Food: PIZZA - thin and regular crust MMM, best god damn crust ever Crispy Chicken Sandwhich w/ the honey dijon Cajun Chicken Pasta Turkey Club Sandwhich Avocado Egg Rolls Spinach Artichoke dip Potato Skins Oh ya, REALLY good Lemonade and Rootbeer in a frosty mug. (the refills aren't free tho for the RB) It gets crowded around dinner time and on the weekends so be aware you might have to wait. ***edit 2/4/08 I just went here last night and the waitress was insane.  She said she was going to spit in our food, (jokingly) but what waitress says that?? We got our spinach dip and it had a hair in it!! We ordered pitchers of beer and they took 4802938403 hours. Needed some lemon for our Hef's and that took 8402934 hours and we were sitting 2 ft from the bar so my friend just got up and got them. The baked potatoes ARE TERRIBLE. It was barely baked and really sick. It seems hard to screw up a baked potato but it happened here! I love BJ's Brewery, but last night made me sad! The blackened salmon was good though...so they lucked out w/ that."
