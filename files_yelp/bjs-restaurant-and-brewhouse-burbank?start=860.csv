Debra C.,"Los Angeles, CA",177,395,7,3.0,1/27/2010,"Lunch is a bargain. You get a pretty good personal pan pizza and salad for $6.50!  But bang-for-your-buck lunch aside, the experience was only so-so. Service was rushed, and you're forced to valet your car. Though the sign read ""Complimentary"", I found myself guilted into handing over two bucks."
Z Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",63,575,67,4.0,5/8/2007,"I have been to Bj's a bunch of times.  I wish I could give it 3.5 stars but I will go with 4.....  :)  I always get the same thing:  Santa Fe Salad and the Brew House Nachos (w/o the chili).  Its funny, almost everyone I know that goes there gets the Santa Fe Salad....it is delicious.  I get the blackened chicken on the side (i am a vegetarian) and then give it to Paul bk you aren't charged less getting meatless.  Paul got the Pizookie last night and I had a bite.......WOW, it was fantastic......it was so sweet and omg, it was great.  Back to the nachos though, they are SO good and they give you so much food, I always have like two meals of leftovers.  Same thing with the salad, it is huge!  Oh, the have dinner rolls that they will bring you with the salad but you have to ask them....... The cons.......service is SLOW, especially is you get take-out.  Parking is the PITS.....and it is frustrating that they don't charge you less for the meatless stuff.  Plus, it is almost always crowded there, expect a 10-15 minutes wait even for a Monday evening.   But, the food is consistently good, large portions, pretty big menu, lots of veggie options, and the bar area is fun and lively.  Lots of tv's to check out whatever games are on....if that is you thing!  :)  (We sat with our backs to the tv bk Paul didn't want to see the score of the game....not sure what gave but.......he was stressed about it!)"
Scott G.,"Los Angeles, CA",102,135,27,4.0,2/24/2009,"Love this place. Really good deep dish pizza that's hearty. Burgers come on like a kaiser roll or something and are delish. The beer is great, and also the Root Beer is awesome and they brew that themselves too. We've never had to wait that long for a table here even on the weekend, and it's a great place to go to have dinner while there's a Lakers game on, lots of energy then! Also they give you a free pizookie (deep dish cookie topped with ice-cream) on your birthday, its sooooo good! Not a place to go if you're on a diet, but that's what the gym is for!"
Alicia A.,"Temecula, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/17/2012,"this is honestly the WORST service i have ever received at a restaurant... my roommates and i LOVE the food, but the service is just crap! the first time we came, the waitress NEVER came by, took forever with our food, didn't care to ask if we needed anything, we had to track her down just for refills... terrible! then the latest time we went was the WORST ever! first, i ordered a mini pizza because i have gotten those before, and they are filling for a mini and usually very delish! this tiny piece of crap came on a plate, which the waitress threw down and the cheese wasn't even on the damn pizza and no sauce at ALL and it was just shit for 8 bucks! so pissed. the server was AWFUL she never came to ask if we needed anything or if everything was fine... i didn't receive silverware of a napkin.. wtf. so i asked and she just brought me drink napkins, what the hell?! meanwhile we wanted to order dessert, and she was too busy talking about stupid crap with the table next to us.. we were pissed. so she finally comes and says dessert? and we say yes. no menu or anything she just starts saying 'double fudge, chocolate chip' and we were like uhhh... she was like telling us the names of the pizzookies, which was what we wanted but it was the matter of the fact.. anyway we order and right away she brings us a bill! ARE YOU KIDDING? so rude and we couldn't even ask to split, so we did and then she brought it back but we didn't even finish yet! then we were done and waiting, meanwhile she still didn't bring back a refill for my friend and then we brought it up, and 10 mins later we get back the wrong thing! SERIOUSLY? so shitty, took forever to take our bill and charge us.. and then when she did she took forever doing that! which makes me feel like she was doing something else also..... ill be checking my bank account since i read another review they took account info..  (last time i payed cash)  no tip either times! never going back there again. only reason for that location is because its the closest... BAD!"
tron d.,"Nashville, TN",50,58,39,1.0,1/7/2009,"Well, the beers were terrible.  I believe that the taps are not clean or somewhere in the brew room there is some unsanitary conditions.  I ordered the 4 beer sampler (Blonde, Pale, Stout, and Nut Brown) and all 4 of the beers carried the same nasty sweetly-bitter odor and taste. The stout seemed to suffer the most. Underneath that mask of off-flavor was a beer undoubtedly, but to get through to it was too much to ask. I only finished one of the 4 flute samplers (the blonde) and did my best to accomplish that. My food was decent but I believe I would've been more satisfied with IN N OUT.  I had the Turkey Cobb and crispy fries which were stale.  I would not recommend the BJ's in Burbank."
Nicole O.,"Burbank, CA",11,42,8,4.0,12/15/2005,"Pizookie Cookie, YO! It's a gigantic (maybe not so gigantic) fresh out-of-the-oven cookie served with french vanilla ice cream. I always order the chocolate chip and macadamia cookie. It's a cool hang out spot - watch basketball games, sit outside and order pitchers of your favorite brew - and all that jazz. And, try the BJ's favorite for your chicago deep dish style pizza."
joseph s.,"Los Angeles, CA",16,170,1,3.0,11/22/2009,"Your typically BJ's. It's food & drinks are pretty much the same, but this place tends to get really packed, especially when I go here. The parking is okay and the restaurant is just right down the street from the mall and the AMC 16. Overall, its is surround by other competitors, such as elephant bar, islands, black angus, fudruckers, and many more. But if your looking for some pizza and drinks, then this is not a bad place to hit up."
Sarah S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,9,,3.0,6/20/2012,I really only come here for the pizookie!!! A pizookie is any type of cookie (i prefer chocolate chip) with any type of ice cream on top (i prefer vanilla). The chocolate chip cookie is always fresh out of the oven and the chocolate chips are almost melting!!! Yummy!!!! The food is ok. I like to get the burger. It's really big and the prices are fair. Service is good and they have AMAZING drinks. It's a solid restaurant.
Buck M.,"LAKE VIEW TER, CA",1,44,2,4.0,4/8/2012,Normally service here isn't too hot. However lunch just now with a party of twelve WOW.  All food came out together all was great refills on the spot no waiting. No one sent food back for any reason. Loved it. Waiter was  David   Ask for him he's great and worth it if u have to wait.
Hannah T.,"Monrovia, CA",86,180,4,3.0,9/4/2008,"Our friends and I will not forget our waiter Jeremy. He took care of us 110% when we told him our food came out cold. We ordered ribs, chicken, steak, crispy pizza, Caesar salad and of course pizookie. He quickly fixed the problem even though the place was super packed!! When we saw our bill, we had to double check with everyone at our table that the amount was right. We asked Jeremy that he made a mistake but he said ""that's the correct amount."" We left him a fat a$$ tip."
Ange N.,"La Canada Flintridge, CA",0,1,,5.0,6/14/2010,"Geate food and atmospher, when you are out with girls, it is a perfect place.  We had there plates to share, good size portiones and good price. Staff very frendly. Deffenetly will be back again."
Jonathan H.,"Burbank, CA",3,13,,2.0,3/24/2011,"This is based purely on this visit, gauging from other reviews I just got the wrong thing.  I ordered the Classic Turkey Sandwich on multigrain bread.  It looked good.  The bread wasn't too fresh, a little on the hard and dry side.  I thought I could choke it down, but couldn't.  The wedge fries were delicious.  Instead of sending it back and making my lunch complicated, I asked for some fresh bread.  They brought the same stale bread and didn't seem to think there was anything wrong with it.  Manage apologized and took it off the bill.  My problem is that they just brought the same stale bread and that the kitchen staff doesn't seem to know what stale is or they just don't care."
tina d.,"North Hollywood, CA",0,32,,1.0,11/18/2008,"Go somehwere else (especially with all the better choices nearby). Everytime we go...staff is not at all concerned with getting our order right or giving you a good experience.  Last time we went, we had a family (with kids) with us.  We got a lot of bad attitude from our waitress -- it's quite common for families to EAT here..."
M o.,"Cathedral City, CA",0,10,,3.0,3/28/2010,"I've been to BJ's in Maui several times and always love it.  I've been to this location twice now.  Pizza is great, but expensive for what you get.  I can eat 1/2 a large by myself.  What used to be a medium pizza is now a large at many places now days.   Even though they're busy, the wait is short because they have lots of seating.   Good place for groups and teenagers.  They loose a star because they only vacuum the middle of the floors and apparently never dust.    They loose another star because my beer was skunky.  The tap lines needed to be cleaned out.  Bad management."
Efy M.,"Encino, CA",0,54,,3.0,12/27/2009,"Food is decent, but attempting self parking is a pain. The ramp is REALLY STEEP so be careful.  If a car is coming down, make sure you let them go down before you attempt to go up the ramp.  It wasn't made for two way traffic.  If you have a large SUV, good luck trying to do a three-point turn because it doesn't loop around.  once you reach any end of the parking, you have to do a three-point turn to come back around.   The service was okay.  We wanted to get seated sooner, so we sat outside.  It wasn't as loud as the inside so that was nice, but we couldn't watch any of the games.  Our waitress didn't come outside much, so our water cups were empty for a while.   The food was good.  Not the best I've ever had, but still good.  We had the artichoke pizza and a yummy pzookie.  One medium pizza for three girls was just the perfect amount for us and let us have some room for their famous pzookie.   Overal, it was just okay. If I'm in the mood for BJ's and I'm in the area, I'll come back, but it's not a place I'm desperate to come back and try again."
David B.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",4,1,,5.0,11/30/2009,"I was only there for the pizza, because a friend had said it was good. The SPINACH & ARTICHOKE PIZZA: A rich, creamy medley of spinach, artichoke hearts, cream cheese and mozzarella topped with our fresh tomato basil blend and Parmesan cheese.  It was delicious! As far as the service, the waiter was a little slow, but did not have to wait long for seating."
David T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,5.0,7/30/2007,"What can be said about BJ's? It's just a great resteraunt.  It's got a cozy atmosphere, (once you're actually seated), and friendly service.  Really, they don't get mad when you keep changing your order! Food is great too.  If it's your first time there, I recommend the Meatball Sub.  It tastes fresh and juicy, and you can really taste the sauces.   BJ's also boasts the best desert in the entire world.  It's the kind of thing that you plan your meal around.  It's not, ""If I have room I will order it.""  It's, ""I probably won't have room for it if I order a sandwich...I'll have a salad instead."" It's called a pizzookie, and it is a perfect mix of hot brownie and vanilla ice cream, topped with fudge and (optionally) oreos chunks. If you see this resteraunt as you drive by, stop."
Chance G.,"Los Angeles, CA",380,46,1,3.0,5/23/2008,"I always order the beer battered fish and chips...because I like to get my fish drunk, and then take advantage of them."
Rod R.,"NORTH HOLLYWOOD, CA",4,8,,5.0,7/28/2009,"Freakin LOVE! this place...my favorite place!...pizza is the best! the chicken wings are great...great beer! recommend the Jeremiah red. Ive been to about three bj's locations and this one by far has been the best...mainly location,scene, and service!"
C S.,"Glendale, CA",24,48,4,2.0,6/2/2010,"I went here a few months ago and we ordered a pizza.  It was ok, nothing I would really care to experience again.  Also ordered their single serving of rootbeer.  Tasty I guess, but nothing special.  Notice they now have a B rating, just shows that Burbank is Not the place to be find a good meal.  What is really nasty about their new rating is one of the violations was, ""DISEASE TRANSMISSION - CARRIER / WOUND""  Obviously the ratings do not go into exact detail, but that alone would scare me away from ever going back."
