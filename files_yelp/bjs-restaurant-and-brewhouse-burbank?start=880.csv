Chuck D.,"Studio City, CA",103,226,4,2.0,3/8/2009,"This is a place that I remember being a disaster from start to finish. The service was terrible, probably the worst roast beef sandwich I ever tasted and the bruschetta ...not the place for it...but why even have it on the menu. Just gross. The highlight was the beers on tap and the big screen tv's and of course having a hot date. Would never go back. 66/100"
Steven F.,"Highland Park, Los Angeles, CA",2,2,,5.0,12/22/2009,"We go to BJ's for the great pizza, beer, and service.  Our server Steve is always fast and makes us feel at home.  Definitely go to BJ's if you like deep dish pizza, they can do thin crust too, but not is the medium and large sizes.  Try a pizzookie too!"
Jill A.,"Covina, CA",735,493,149,4.0,11/25/2007,"did someone say happy hour?   bj's brews and cider- $1.00 off mini pizzas - 50% off appetizers - $2.00 off well drinks - $2.75 i had the sweet pig pizza, 2 jerry burst (jeremiah red + berry burst cider - YUM!), and a soco and lime shot.  it was definitely a HAPPY HOUR! :)"
Annie T.,"Burbank, CA",0,19,,4.0,10/25/2011,I really like this place for their burgers and garlic fries! Good place to go with friend for relaxing atmosphere. Servers really pleasant and nice.
Lee R.,"Playa del Rey, CA",12,51,4,4.0,8/3/2007,"I happened across BJ's after my second trip of the day to IKEA for some house furniture.  We couldn't fit everything during our first run, so we went right back for more.  Well after that fiasco I definitely needed a nice cold beer, and since LA lacks brewpubs whenever I see one I feel obligated to check it out.   Let me tell you friends...the beer is FANTASTIC.  We started with the 7-beer sampler, very reasonably priced at $8.50 considering the samples are 5 oz. glasses.  First was a Kolsch-style blonde ale, light and refreshing but still retaining a nice hop bitterness.  Next was a bavarian style hefeweizen, strong aroma of banana and cloves.  No lemon needed!  Then a Pale Ale, beautifully balanced and delightfully hopped with Chinook and Cascade hops.  Then came a red strong ale, tipping the scales at 7.3% ABV.  Surprisingly smooth for a beer of that strength.  Next was the PM Porter, served on Nitro to give it a super creamy texture and head like Guinness.  Yum.  After that was the Tatonka Stout, an Imperial Stout (8.3%ABV) that was deliciously intense.  Finally their seasonal was a Nut-Brown ale I think.  By that point my tastebuds were thoroughly worked over.  I would order any of those beers again, and it's not often I say that about a brewpub's offerings. Food was 2-3 stars, we tried the lettuce wraps and a mini pizza (the works) for about $8.50 each.  Nothing to write home about, but I'll definitely be back to try more.  The pizookie sounds awesome, getting that next time for sure."
Ferdinand M.,"Los Angeles, CA",50,118,1,3.0,6/30/2008,"I know this place is a total chain, and I usually avoid chains if at all possible, but I think BJ's is solid. Good selection of house-made, draft beers.. Good Hefeweizen.. The food is a definite step up from your standard brew pub burgers and wings place too and they step it up a little by giving you the club sandwich on some kind of garlic toast or something as opposed to just normal bread. It's the little things like that.. Just a vast selection of things that taste really good and are incredibly bad for you and a nice variety of house brewed beer to wash it down with. I would give it four stars, but honestly the sports bar and Nickelback & Creed on the radio vibe bums me out."
Nelson P.,"North Hollywood, CA",18,23,,2.0,4/5/2010,"Dude this spot was a disappointment, the food was simple... In taste.. I expected the presentation to be bland. Well let's say the place is pretty inviting and when I went it was full so I expected good things. Took about ten minutes for us to be asked for drinks and another 7 to get them. I started off by ordering the fried calamari an when they brought it over it looked appetizing, but it was disappointing. It tasted like they just dredged the pieces in flour and fried them in some funky old oil. Now where I work we season the flour for the calamari. Then I ordered the balsamic grilled chicken thing and when I got it again same thing, looked appetizing smelled good , but no flavor. Once I got through that I dared to go for the brownie, and let me tell you, it HAD flavor!!!! Yaaaaay I thought to myself, but as I kept going for more I found out that I was in for some archeological findings as I had to chisel away at the edges to get the caked on parts of the brownie. All in all this place was to much money for what they give you. The food was bland and I noticed that most of their desserts are served in the same five inch cake pans so I have a feeling they don't even make the batter for the brownie, but order it pre-made so they just pour it into the pan and microwave that B. So now I know why it's a brewhouse too, so you get drunk of what I hear is good beer and don't notice how tasteless their food is. Not going back here no more son!"
Michelle O.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",248,787,345,4.0,9/3/2006,"This place is fairly good, they have a good selection of food. They have salads, which i recommend the BBQ chicken salad, o so good  and it's filling. They also have pizza, sandwiches, won tons, these massive baked potatoes that sometimes people just get those for lunch and they come w/ different topings. So as you can see if they have good variety. This is the somewhat new place that many younger people like to hangout at, teenage-20 somethings. This place stays open til around 10 on week days and around 12ish on weekends. You can say this is the replacement of the Chili's hangout. Though when it gets towards the evening it can get pretty loud in there. Not only do they have great food but they have a bar as well that you can sit at anytime and tablesin the bar area (of age for drinks) and don't have to wait for sitting. Back to the food they have a great dessert (basically the only dessert) it's called a a pazookie. It's good, basically it's ice cream and a cookie, whether you prefer chocolate chip, oatmel etc. They also have the party platter that my friends and I got, which it contains 4 different types of cookies as well as  ice cream. This place can get very crowded so as we suggestion, especially if you are a family or a big group of people, make sure you go to a early dinner, b/c this place get's busy. The only time it's not TOO bad it at lunch during the weekdays. Also the one in oxnard is just the same, and the service there is good as well. But again it gets busy and you can be waiting around dinner 6-7+ pm from 1/2 hr. on, sometimes 15-20 min.  So grab some good friends and a pazookie platter and you're good to go!"
Martin A.,"Burbank, CA",2,42,,3.0,12/13/2010,"Wait is sometimes longer than it should be and if you get a crappy waiter/waitress then its very annoying, otherwise the food is great and the atmosphere is top notch for a brewhouse.  nice place to catch a game.  Biggest problem is parking.. Although there are MANY open parking spots available, they still insist on making you park far if you self park because they try to get you to valet the car.  This would make a lot more sense if it was needed but its obvious the valet is just set up to annoy people"
Angela H.,"Burbank, CA",0,14,2,5.0,6/20/2009,"I L-O-V-E this place i mean great service great food awesome desserts the flat screens r pretty awesome too but i was from a distance so i couldnt really tell... but, i would definitly go back there again!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Shawna M.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,3,,3.0,6/13/2011,The food is okay and the Beer is GREAT
Terra O.,"San Fernando Valley, CA",6,39,,5.0,11/13/2010,"Never a disappointment, always a treat! When in doubt get a pizza, that's always a favorite. We love the 2 for $20 deal!"
Dennis T.,"Los Angeles, CA",309,213,5,4.0,6/25/2007,"7 piece sampler is all I gotta say. 8 bucks, and BOOOM I'm pretty nice and crunk. LOL. I'm such weak sauce. Remember to drink them from the darkest brew to lightest brew. In my opinion it makes it a lot easier to drink and enjoy. Food wise, all the typical bar foods. Mini pizzas are great, especially during happy hour. Those who eat at BJs and decide not to have a pizookie should be jailed. When they ask you what kind of cookie you want, for those who don't know, you can do half and half. Half chocolate chip, half white chocolate. BOOM!"
ariel p.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/5/2009,"Never having been to a B.J.'s, yesterday was the night to go for the first time. We ordered drinks (one very tasty and hoppy Piranha Pale Ale, one nice Daiquirí) and some nachos to nibble while deciding what to eat. The drinks and the nachos appeared - a huge platter overflowing with nachos and chili. By huge I mean - there was enough food on it to feed a family of four. Honestly. So that's all we ate. Apart from that - the place is huge and very, very noisy. It probably would be fun to go there with a group to add to the din.  So I actually can't rate B.J.'s. I'll first have to get a group together to come with me."
R J.,"Glendale, CA",0,13,,5.0,5/3/2011,"I love the deep dish pizza here, the mushroom-spinach appetizers, and the pazookie is great. A great place for a get-together."
Josh A.,"Burbank, CA",43,62,2,4.0,6/7/2008,"The pizza is very tasty, but this place is always packed so expect the service to be a little slower than you'd like."
Joshua L.,"Sun Valley, CA",5,17,,4.0,3/23/2011,i want to thank jamie the manager of the restaurant for helping us . we ordered our food about 5:45pm and it took about 1 hour to receive it. she help us by making sure we received our appetizer first and food after we were done. she also gave us a free drink which was greatly appreciated. i appreciate that she stood up for the company and showed it cared for it's customers. thanks again jamie.
Tracy S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,15,,4.0,11/24/2010,You gotta have a pazookie. OMG.. delicious. Great deep dish pizza too.
Mac F.,"Alhambra, CA",0,32,,4.0,10/11/2010,"stopped by today for lunch at 11:45am... sat in the bar area with friends who wanted to go to BJs... first off the service was good (i read several bad service reviews on yelp)... i ordered my drink first as I looked over the menu... the drink came quickly and I decided on mac n' cheese and chicken teriyaki... mac n' chesse came at the same time as the others salads did... the mac was good not great but passable... my chicken teriyaki was very good, the chicken was over rice,grilled onions and peppers which made it very tasty... I will be returning to BJs in the near future..."
J S.,"South Pasadena, CA",12,101,1,4.0,2/20/2008,"Its a sportish like bar/restaurant.  Cool place to bring your friends, not some dark, nasty old beer smelling place. Went there for dinner with a friend, not for a game. Screens were on, not the sound, you can sit at a real table and have good grub, or you can sit at a bar table and drink. I'm sure on game day, it must be crazy cool, lots of space. If you are a sports boy and your girl wants you to take her out, you'll both be happy at this place. Staff was very friendly and patient too. Tip: You don't need to valet park. Go up the parking, and park at the top. Also, entrance is only from First Street."
