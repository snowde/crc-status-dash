kate q.,"Seattle, WA",0,27,,5.0,9/1/2007,"I'm giving this a five star review but you HAVE to sit at the bar okay?  Otherwise it's a 3 on a good day.  The interior is a corporate nightmare but sitting the bar, you'll never notice.  The service SUCKS but the bartenders serve you food quick and with a smile.  The beer is some of the best we've ever had and that holds true no matter where you sit.  The food is good too and fairly prices.  AND if you sit at the bar, it comes up pretty quickly.  If you don't sit at the bar, you must sit inside because if you sit outside they will forget about you =(."
Sarah S.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",9,27,,4.0,7/24/2009,"I love Bj's oh yes I do. I love this location just cuz Burbank is a cool place. Start off with strawberry lemonade, ventured off from my usual order of root beer.. The spinach dip is usually a hit or miss for me but tonight was a sure hit cuz it was cheesy, gooey, spinach-y and the tortilla chips were crunchy. I try to get different dishes everytime I go anywhere and tonight I was in the mood for salmon and tried the Salmon plate (blackened, of course) and it was quite tasty. The peppered seasoning was not so overwhelming like other places and the steamed veggies were the right consistency. Okk enough bout the food (which are always tasty don't get me wrong) but I can not, I repeat, I CANNOT go to BJ's without getting a pizzookie. I dont care if Im stuffed, full and on the verge of puking from eating, I dont care, because its a definite must. It's like a freshly baked oversized chocolate chip cookie and scoops of vanilla ice cream on top. It sounds plain and simple, but when you take a bite of that cookie with ice cream, its pure bliss in your mouth. I salivate just thinking about it. =)"
Eric G.,"West Newton, MA",1,20,,4.0,10/26/2009,Had a great lunch here yesterday. Yummy fish tacos. Very atttentive service
Caitlin B.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,5,,5.0,6/12/2009,BJ's just started serving these new Flatbread Appetizer Pizza's that are out of this world. The food their is soooo good but the flatbreads are the best appetizer by far!!!!
Mark F.,"La Crescenta, CA",1,28,,4.0,3/25/2007,"You can't go wrong with the food and drinks at BJ's.  The humongous multi-screen TV with multiple games going on at a time is by far the best feature inside.  Pizzas, and appetizers are all excellent.  Go with the microbrew sampler, you won't be disappointed.  Always a happening vibe in there, usually never have to wait too long even though its that busy.  Only downside, there is a major lack of good-looking female wait staff.  Go to Valencia if you want that.  It's all dudes who work at this one."
J L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,75,1,4.0,3/14/2008,a cool place to go with a group of friends for some good pizza...the spinach/artichoke dip is pretty good too and their PIZOOKIE's are to die for!!!
