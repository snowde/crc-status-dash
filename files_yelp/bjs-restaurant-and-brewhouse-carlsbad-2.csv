Krysten S.,"Oceanside, San Diego, CA",279,67,78,4.0,1/7/2018,"Came here for an easy dinner/get together with a few friends on NYE before we hit the bars. It was pretty busy with young people who probably had the same idea. The server was really nice and attentive but you could tell he was a little stressed out with how busy the place was.  Drinks were okay, not super strong but not weak, it is a family friendly place after. I tried a Paloma which was refreshing just super sweet. Food wise, everything came out relatively hot and altogether. We had the Parmesan chicken with lemon thyme sauce, chicken fettuccine, salmon, spinach artichoke dip, sriracha Brussel sprouts, queso and fries. Everything was pretty good, just kind of normal food, nothing special you know? The chicken was crispy but needed more sauce, the pasta was pasta, it's hard to mess up. The salmon was very good with the asparagus and the apps were just kind of meh. It's the same experience you'd get at any chain place. However, the atmosphere, the friends and the service coupled with easily good food made this 4 stars."
Carmik T.,"Gilbert, AZ",67,382,737,4.0,12/30/2017,"Service was very polite & professional. I had the lunch special "" endless soup & salad"" $9.95. I only had one serving of soup/ salad so a fair price. My son had the brisket burger, huge and couldn't finish it. Very tasty.. My husband had the club sandwich and was a delicious classic. We had ordered the chicken wings as an appetizer ( bone in Traditional) they brought out the boneless and presented them on the table. We told the server who brought them, they should have been traditional ( bone in). She proceeded to take the plate off the table and correct the problem. Our server came out and said it was her mistake, that she hit the wrong key. It was some time before we would get the order right, so she asked us if we wanted the boneless back out to munch on. ""Of course"". My son is a server and stated that technically once the plate hits the table, it should be served / comp'ed. I applauded them for ""making it right"". We travel often and always enjoy eating at this chain, as they always have something to offer everyone. Great menu at an affordable price & portion wise you get what you pay for."
Cindy K.,"San Marcos, CA",6,42,20,1.0,12/3/2017,"Beyond disappointment. Great waiter, awful food.  Jambalaya was a complete false advertising. I wish I had taken a picture of how white it was as it was rice and boule barely shrimp with a whole can of dry seasoning shaken all over. I was so offended they were trying to pass it off as Jambalaya. It looked nothing like the picture on their menu.  Ordered a pizza and raw.  The Chicken Bacon Ranch Piadia - looked nothing like the picture again. The wrap was toasted hard so the filling was a disaster. Not once did the picture or description mention toasting. My son could hold it and regular knife could not cut through it. Fail."
David l.,"Encinitas, CA",117,81,153,5.0,11/17/2017,The food was great tonight.  The service was exceptional.  Our sever was out of control responsive! Her name was Lissette and I swear our drinks were never left empty for a second.  So impressed by the level of service at our table that I had to give this server an honorable mention.  As always the food was true to the brand and the wait time at the busy hour was nothing..great job BJ's. Side note if you love cinnamon rolls you have to try the monkey bread pazookie.. your welcome...
Lili T.,"San Diego, CA",346,200,346,4.0,9/5/2017,"Came here for lunch yesterday and we barely beat the rush! It was so great coming in around 1pm during the holiday weekend and getting seated immediately.  I've been here a few times before (in other locations), but this was my family's first time here. We were greeted with a very friendly waiter and he quickly got us our drinks. For entrees we got a grilled chicken sandwich, quinoa power bowl with shrimp, Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos, and the Chicken Pesto thin crust tavern pizza. Everything came out relatively quickly and everyone enjoyed their meal! The grilled chicken sandwich had an egg overtop, the fries it came with were AMAZING, the quinoa power bowl had plenty of shrimp, the pita tacos were delicious and had a great yogurt sauce to go along with it, and the tavern pizza was thin, crispy, and flavorful.  We had a great experience and will likely come back to this establishment."
Taylor S.,"San Diego, CA",238,5,1,5.0,1/6/2018,I was super happy with everything tonight! We had two very very excellent waitresses! I asked for suggestions on the menu and got great ideas. I even asked one of the bus boys and he gave me details of what he likes. I got the deep dish five meat small pizza. I was worried it wouldn't be enough food but I'm stuffed. They brought out great birthday pazookies. Great service and good food.
Johnny C.,"Central West End, Saint Louis, MO",0,26,40,5.0,12/31/2017,This a must go when visiting Carlsbad outside San Diego. Their BBQ IS TASTY! The menu is packed with so many amazing appetizers and dishes. Best of all they are a brew house with beers for all taste buds. Today I am having a Black Velvet...with BBQ ribs on the way.
Chad C.,"Carlsbad, CA",3918,394,2444,5.0,10/25/2017,"I have been coming to BJ's since the nineties, this is a great restaurant right across the street from the Carlsbad outlet stores.  The lines can get long to sit but it is well worth it, I love their buffalo chicken pizza, also beer selection is top notch.  Five stars !"
Monica T.,"Las Vegas, NV",52,135,225,1.0,7/24/2017,"I was very disappointed at my visit here. I figured there was no way BJ's, a huge and reputable food chain could ever have such a low rating; that was until my visit last night.  We arrived and we're seating right away. I should have read the signs the universe gave me when we arrived. The hostess with an overloaded amount of make up took our names. This was followed by another young lady who seated us. I said we had 5 in our party, and we were seated at a table for 4. We told the hostess she was missing a chair, so she sent us back to wait until the tables were reconfigured to accommodate our party.  We were finally seated and our server asked if we wanted drinks. We asked for water and beer. The first round of drinks were correct, however the server did not notice when our drinks were empty and needed refills. When ordering a refill of a beer, the server brought the incorrect drink. We had to walk up to the bar to exchange our beers for the correct ones. We waited before doing so however our server was no where to be found.  We ordered calamari as our appetizer. Unfortunately the breading was missing on a few pieces and the breaded ones tasted like the calamari was fried in recycled oil. When we received our appetizer, we had to ask the hostess for utensils because we were never given any when seated.  My son ordered a steak. He told the waiter he wanted medium rare, I told the waiter no, medium. My son received well done. The waiters response ""you told me medium well"". We asked for a new steak because it was certainly over cooked. That was the first time we realized we may have been irritating our waiter. My son also ordered a side of macaroni and couscous, and a second side of just couscous. When his food arrived, it was both the same macaroni and couscous. The macaroni and couscous tasted like soggy left over couscous thrown into macaroni. The cheese tasted like the nacho cheese you eat with nachos at a baseball game. The kicker- the credit card fiasco. We were ready for our bill and the server said he would be back with our (separate) checks. We waited and waited, and tried to flag down someone. I felt bad we had been at the restaurant for 2 hours, waiting for a majority of the time. I never like being ""those people"" who sit and hold up a table, however there was no one waiting for a table and there were plenty of empty ones.  We finally received our bill, and gave the waiter our credit card. When he returned with the receipts and cards, the bill changed to our card was incorrect. We noticed another guy flagging down the same waiting with the same problem; our credit cards and charges were mixed up. There goes another 20 minutes trying to find our waiter to settle our credit card Fiasco.  There is no way I would ever return to BJs. The server seemed annoyed with us correcting him and I felt bad at first but then I think about how much attention he really gave us. We had dirty plates from appetizers on our table, and we had to request our plates get taken away. It's one thing to mess up once and be sincere about it, it's another to make patrons feel like we are bothersome to you.    Never again."
John  F.,"Oceanside, CA",13,38,1,4.0,12/13/2017,"I haven't been to BJ's in a few months. So my wife and I visited this location this evening for dinner! Man what a pleasure! The consistency of the food is great! The service top notch! Our server Lauren Smiley, was a pleasure and adds to the good time! I should mention the support team was there as well! I always think there are to many choices but given that their all pretty darn good so be it!  Another thing, my wife wanted to speak to the Chef, first to compliment the team and also to  comment on a change she noticed in the soups. So we met Jesus Bermudez, young, professional and well spoken! He listened and said it will be noted and welcomed customer feed-back! That nice to see is a large chain like BJs. Keep it going BJ's you guys are in our top two places to dine where ever we go!"
Karla B.,"San Diego, CA",9,16,3,1.0,9/17/2017,"The food and staff are horrible and not to mention disgustingly dirty!  The greeter I swear didn't even as much as say hello, ""how many"" and had the most pissed of face!! Who knows what was going on on her head and the food was simply horrible! But the worse part was taking my 5 year old daughter to use the restroom and finding it so horrible dirty!  See the pictures!  I remember this place many years back being a much nicer place with a much better quality of food!"
Kristel D.,"Escondido, CA",7,2,1,1.0,12/11/2017,"Third time ordering to-go from here, and it's getting increasingly disappointing. First time, everything was in order. Second time, Hickory Smoked Brisket burger had to be thrown away because of the sauce tasting rancid. Third time, different order, our Deluxe Guac/Bacon Cheese burger had about 2-3 pieces of bacon, an inch long directly in the center. Don't think I'm recommending/holding any events here any time soon. Thought I would give them another chance after the second order, but just ended up wasting about $60 collectively for inedible, poorly prepared food."
Cookie F.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,1,,5.0,12/29/2017,"Your manager, Brynne, at the Carlsbad, CA Restaurant went above and beyond the call of duty to help us today.  She is fantastic, and you are lucky to have an employee so devoted to customer satisfaction.  We are very appreciative. Jeff & Cookie, Carlsbad, CA"
David J.,"Carlsbad, CA",1,43,,4.0,12/25/2017,"After some last-minute Christmas Eve shopping we (me, wife, 17-year-old daughter) went here for dinner. I had the Grand Cru beer on tap (excellent, and was recommended by our waitress), my wife had a bloody mary (she enjoyed it), and my daughter had several glasses of raspberry lemonade. All of our dinners were really good. My wife had the kate/broccoli salad with salmon. My daughter had the boneless chicken wings. I had the prime rib. More on the prime rib ... this is only available on the weekend after 4pm. Last time I was at BJ's it was a weekday so I couldn't try this dish - I'm glad I came back. The dinner comes with a salad (my Caesar was very good), two sides (green beans, which were not hot, and rice pilaf, which was good). The prime rib was very good. It was cooked to order (Medium rare, of course) but looked a bit smaller than the advertised 15 ounces. I declined the horseradish sauce and had raw horseradish with my au-jus. Again, it was very good. The dinner also comes with a full-sized Pazookie, which we devoured. A good value for the price. Our service was very good - all in all a nice way to spend Christmas Eve dinner."
Steve H.,"Del Mar, San Diego, CA",20,86,89,5.0,6/22/2017,"We descended on BJ's with a Big group.. 24 people, and BJ's really came through for us.  They reserved two tables for 12 each, and we had what felt like our own full-service wait staff, even at peak Friday lunchtime.  That's impressive.  Full restaurant, and still available parking -- that's a plus. The deep-dish pizza was a hit, and filling for everyone.  We served everyone with BJ's Favorite, 5-meat, Veggie, and BBQ Chicken.  No complaints and everyone left stuffed. The menu is long, and the beer list is dazzling.. as extensive as it is varied. The five stars here was earned by BJ's staff, who was enthusiastically helpful throughout.  Never an empty glass, and the pacing was perfect. I was surprised they did not include a fixed gratuity in the tab for such a large party, as seems common now; all the better.      A real pleasure to visit."
Aaron H.,"Escondido, CA",10,76,40,4.0,6/16/2017,"Service here was great! Came in late one night to talk things over with a buddy and the hostess was super attentive, getting a booth ready within a couple minutes. We weren't looking for food but once I saw the pulled pork burger I was all for that! We had a few tasters and really liked their house porter. BJ's beers have always been on the more mild side and I am fine with that. Nothing wrong with no having to worry about getting a super hoppy taste from an IPA or getting an excessively bitter/dark taste from a porter. Needless to say, this location has friendly and fairly quick service."
Dawn H.,"Oceanside, CA",2,17,8,4.0,12/26/2017,"A little pricey, but overall it's a great place with a lot of menu options. The food is really good too."
Jen C.,"Carlsbad, CA",3,123,298,5.0,7/2/2017,"Great sandwiches and burgers! A bit pricey but sends out frequent coupons. Expensive sodas $3. Staff is great. Polite, attentive, flavors are all there! Good atmosphere at the bar. See pic."
Shane B.,"Temecula, CA",166,3,,5.0,11/2/2017,"My girlfriend and I have been here quite a few times, and each time is better than the last. Our server, Brooke, is on point every time. She brings us our food faster than we ever expect and is always one step ahead in terms of refills and taking our order.  Highly recommend if you're looking for great food and an amazing atmosphere to enjoy it!"
Lindsey K.,"Los Angeles, CA",233,10,,5.0,1/5/2018,"This review is for the brussels sprouts only. They are TO DIE FOR. We go to BJ's for this dish only, so I can't speak for the rest of their food but their brussels are seriously out of this world. So crunchy and crispy, and the honey sriracha sauce is perfectly balanced. We always ask for extra sauce! According to their nutrition facts they're actually not that caloric, but I am very suspicious. I don't think there's any way to achieve that delicious crispy texture without deep frying. But they're worth it. Make sure to get 2 orders if you're dining with more than one other person! They go quickly."
Diana L.,"San Pedro, San Pedro, CA",61,17,,2.0,11/4/2017,"My bf and I had to wait for more than 20 minutes before we were attended by a server. I had to call prior in order for us to be attended because the available server, whose name is David, paid no attention to us whatsoever while he was attending every single table surrounding our table. I felt discriminated against because David was serving everyone else but my bf and I. The manager then came over our table and gave us a $25 courtesy card and apologized for the inconvenience. Will I come back to this location again? Probably not because of the first impression I got."
Kris K.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,39,147,4.0,4/18/2017,"Not much to brag about this place as Service is little lacking here compared to the one I go to in Torrance which is way better. Me my friend walked into the bar area which is self seating, we sat at one of the high-tops and no server approached for about 10 minutes despite the bar area being very empty. Once the server stopped by we asked if we could move to booths next to our high-top and she was ok with it. Ordered about 3 dishes (Chicken wings, mushrooms with spinach and cheese, California club flat bread). Flatbread was over baked where it was bit hard to bite on, toppings were less compared to other BJ's I had. Chicken Wings had little excessive bbq sauce and was over powering the wings, Mushrooms with spinach and cheese was good."
Caleb T.,"Encinitas, CA",90,396,819,4.0,8/28/2016,"Kind of surprised I've never written a review for this place... I mean, I've come here often enough, typically out of indifference to someone else's choice.  As far as chain restaurants go, you could do much worse.  Everything I've eaten here has been average or a little above.  Most appetizers are precooked, frozen, heated to a hint over warm, and served with bottled sauces.  Food is salty and sweet, not much spice or acid to help cut through any of the grease.  But all pizzas are still a step or so better than you would get at Pizza Hut or Papa Johns, the burgers and chicken on par with your local Chili's. All of this together may sound like the makings of a three or even three and a half star review, and I would leave it there if not for one thing ... those damned Pazookies. Moist, gooey, sugary sweet, laden with cold and melting ice cream, and served in a variety of flavors that seem to cycle with current tastes.  Red Velvet, Salted Caramel, good ole' Chocolate Chip or Peanut Butter, these things are basically half baked cookies with a couple scoops of something on top and there's no leaving BJ's without getting one.  Typically the outer edges are burned, difficult to get out of the pan without forceful scraping, and when you do your spoon gains that tangy aluminum taste that makes your face sour up.  The rest of that Pazookie, though ... damn. Honestly, BJ's is probably best around happy hour, a drink or two, maybe an appetizer, and a tableful of Pazzokies while you laugh with friends and keep clicking on nearby PokeStops.  Do dinner if you have to, but don't leave without that hot cookie and ice cream and you can go away with a bit of a smile and a fairly happy stomach thinking this place is the weak four star place that it is."
Jacqueline C.,"Carlsbad, CA",204,22,19,3.0,10/14/2017,"And we're back!! It's been an hour and we just received our appetizers. I don't know what to say. It was great to see the USC game while we waited. USC won against Utah. Fight on!!  We have a family visiting from Hawaii. They wanted BJs. Anyway, the fam devoured the appetizers. Good thing we ordered three appetizers... Still waiting for our entrees. I only ordered dessert as i had a late lunch earlier. Do they not have enough chefs in the kitchen?!  I gave a 1 star because of the wait.  Thanks for listening. I am back adding to this review. Staff saw me on Yelp. Within about 10 minutes, we all had our order. There were at least 4 people who assisted in the ""rush""  ... I'm giving a 3 star (final answer) as we had to wait again. The waitress was kind and pleasant. Not her fault we had to wait so long.. in the end, BJs took off the cost for the flatbread pizza. Thanks BJs. See you next time."
Nicole M.,"Oceanside, CA",73,67,41,2.0,4/16/2017,"I have been to enough BJ'S at this point in my life. On a good trip, it's a 1 on 1 sport, but not this time. I don't mind being vocal and people staring, but when you give me faulty meat - we are going to have issues.  You dropped the ball BJ'S with your sub-par protein. You're only saving grace was the young bartender, I don't know her name, hee hee, that was kind enough to apologize.  Cooks, GET IT TOGETHER. This wasn't even like an ""oops""."
Essie K.,"San Diego, CA",68,500,254,2.0,3/6/2017,"I have such fond memories of going to BJ's as a kid but our recent visit to the Carlsbad location was a disappointment. The only good thing was plenty of parking spots.  Why the 2 stars? - on Sunday around 6 PM, the wait was over 25 minutes for a party of 2. They initially said 10-15 minutes but it took 25 minutes.  - overpriced food (most of the entrees were between $11-20); medium pizza for $21  - food was mediocre: our tomato bisque soup was not even warm and tasted like it came out of a can; our pizza was super greasy, had no tomato sauce, and had minimal toppings (we got only a few pieces of each topping); our salad only filled half of the plate. - lack of service: our server was clearly waiting too many tables; we had to flag him down for extra water, napkins, the check and a to-go box. he was nice but did not check in with us at all.  - love their pizookie but the size had not changed over the years but the price keeps going up! it's now $7-8 for one pizookie which can fed 1-2 people depending on how hungry you are at the end of your meal.  For the price, I feel you can get so much more and better quality/taste at other restaurants around San Diego. Or go to Cheesecake Factory which has the same type of menu but better quality and portions."
Nadia G.,"San Diego, CA",4213,331,209,3.0,7/24/2016,"The hostess was lovely. We didn't have to wait very long to be seated. The atmosphere is very nice.  The food this time was too salty for two of the four meals we ordered. One of the meals was very tiny.  I had a simple question to confirm if my rewards were recorded for the visit because it was it didn't show on the bill as it usually does and wasn't showing on my app. The waiter, who was nice enough before, became very argumentative and huffed off saying ""I'll get my manager"", who I never asked for and who didn't show up so we left after 10 minutes. I just wanted to know that I got my points!"
Richard J.,"Vista, CA",73,247,317,4.0,2/6/2017,"Been here plenty of times for food and drinks. Also have been able to make it to their beer and food pairings as well. Depending on time of the day the wait can be a little long so always check out the bar for seating, especially for happy hour! By far the best food that they have there is the pizza. The rest of the food is ok, but the deep dish pizza is pretty darn tasty! The buffalo chicken pizza is one my favorites. Also if you sign up for the rewards card you get emails that give you some good rewards. Sometimes its a free pizookie and sometimes it a buy one entree and get one half off or free. Also they notify you about the beer and food pairings.  The beer and food pairings are pretty cool! I have been to a few of them over the past years and each one has been different. Some are better than others depending upon what food and beer is on the menu. Sometimes the food portions are smaller but if you ask the wait staff sometimes you can get some extra food for the servings if they have extra. Being able to try new and different beer is cool as well!"
Dan M.,"Newbury Park, CA",5,22,18,4.0,9/18/2017,Great ambiance - food was fast and really good - perfect appetizers - and tried the new churro pizookie a really really really good limited time dessert - try it before or goes!
Karen S.,"Encinitas, CA",63,16,2,4.0,9/15/2017,"The service has greatly improved at this location. We went to have dinner last night and our service Michael B was outstanding. He was timely, courteous and when we had to return one of the items we ordered due to dissatisfaction he was very kind and knew exactly how to handle it. Bravo you man!! Job well done.  I would not suggest the spaghetti and meatballs. The meatballs were awful. They tasted like they were half meat and half flour.. Root beer ribs are excellent and the pork loin chop was my husbands new favorite."
Alexei N.,"La Mesa, CA",1,10,17,1.0,9/27/2017,You know I been to other Bjs restaurants. This one in Carlsbad was the worst. The waitress was not pleasant. She was not a good advisor on what is the catch of the day. Just direct and rude. The food was bland and not satisfying at all. The staff seem very lazy and complacent. Just a bad experience for my friend who just happy to go to a restaurant and enjoy his meal. Not!  Don't go there I learned my lesson bad service equals bad food.
Sang L.,"Porter Ranch, Porter Ranch, CA",0,61,1,1.0,11/21/2017,Came here for dinner tonight. Seated right away. Saw a lot of servers just hanging out and talking. Waited 10 minutes. Nobody took our order. Saw the table next to us. They were greeted and drinks were served. Can't take this kind of service from a restaurant. Just bs. Poor management bad service.
Brittney L.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,1,,5.0,12/29/2017,This is probably my favorite place to get a out of this world burger. The service my family received was wonderful. Our waitress was Brooke and I swear she never let our drinks get half empty and was extremely attentive to our needs. If you're looking for a great burger and great atmosphere this is the place to be!
Alvin R.,"Irvine, CA",105,6,,5.0,11/12/2017,We had the most wonderful server named Dakota! She was very courteous and expedited great service. BJ's honored an extension of the Veterans Day special. Thank you for honoring us!
Steve H.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,9,2,5.0,8/6/2017,We had a large party of 45 people and Brooke took great care of us!!! Definitely will be back!!!
E T.,"Oceanside, CA",97,8,,1.0,11/16/2017,"Bad Bison BURGER & steak...poor service, overpriced, O'well what u gonna do. Bad, bad, bad. Don't buy there"
Cindy W.,"Carlsbad, CA",2232,1937,4290,4.0,5/17/2016,"I came here for lunch with my friend and I've been to BJ's many times but having a person visiting from out of state, sometimes, they don't get BJ's or the concept. The best way to describe it is: it has a menu like the Cheesecake Factory, it's an upscale version of AppleBee's, and it has its own brew options like Karl Strauss. I think I got it?!? For an appetizer, we got the boneless chicken wings and it was good, but it was a bit dry for some pieces, bone in would have been better, but my friend wanted boneless. For our main course, I got the fully loaded tator tots bowl. FIRST OFF, I didn't know BJ's had a tot's section but for this location, they had three different tots bowl to choose from. I got the fully loaded without the sour cream. It was delicious and though some tots were soggy on the bottom, it's my fault for not eating it fast enough. My friend got the chicken and asparagus pasta dish, it looked good but mine was better.  Of course, you can't take an out-of-towner to BJ's without having pizookie so we got the mini pizookie. The white chocolate macadamia one. MMMM.  I think I'd come back here just for the tots."
Mae M.,"Oceanside, CA",70,9,24,2.0,6/30/2017,"I put in my order online to pick up around 1215pm. I showed up at the time but I had to wait until 1245pm to get my order. When I first got there and paid for my order, I asked for a cup of water. Cashier responsed but completely forgot to give me any. Then she returned to give a cup of water to the customer who arrived after me. I then had to ask her again for my water. Then her supervisor jumped in to help which didnt make any different. The food is good; but for your reference if you order togo expect to wait double the time they quote you."
Alec B.,"Vista, CA",60,4,,5.0,11/14/2017,"I happen to work with one of the servers, Dalton, at a different restaurant; he highly recommended the slow cooked pork chop. This has to have been the best pork chop I've ever had. Cooked perfectly with a baked potato on the side. Our sever, Joy, was wonderfully friendly and polite, she made a nice night out a truly memorable experience."
Linda A.,"La Verne, CA",0,19,1,3.0,11/12/2017,"Our waitress was fantastic!! Even when the bartender kept messing up our drinks. Bringing  back 3 wrong drinks out of 4. We asked how the spaghetti was and she said she wasn't that pleased with it, but one of our friends ordered it anyway because she wanted pasta and then said she should have listened to the waitress. So I wouldn't recommend that. Our chicken club was really good and you can't mess up a hamburger. Ha Ha. It was a Saturday night and of course pretty loud inside and a long wait, but we sat outside with awesome heaters and no wait. We had a great time!"
