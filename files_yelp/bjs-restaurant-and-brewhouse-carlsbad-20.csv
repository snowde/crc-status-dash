Sandy M.,"Oceanside, CA",41,35,33,5.0,10/28/2015,"Approximately a month ago my family and I came in for dinner on my husband's birthday.  We very disappointed by the service and I wrote a review.  I received an apology quickly from their GM Scott.  We came in for dinner tonight and we were seated quickly. Within 3 minutes of being seated we were greeted promptly by Hayden.  He took our beverage and appetizer order. No joke, within 5 minutes our drinks and appetizers came out. Hayden checked in on us on a regular basis to make sure if we needed anything and to refill our beverages.  We received our meal shortly after.  I'm pleased and eager to announce that I absolutely enjoyed my visit tonight. Hayden was a outstanding server and was wonderful. I changed my review from a 2 to a 5 star because of his care. I look forward to my next visit and hope he will be our server the next time around."
Jamie H.,"Carlsbad, San Diego, CA",72,43,53,5.0,11/19/2015,We had a could of bad experiences here before and thought we'd try again. So glad we did! Sat at the bar and had a Bloody Mary and a beer - both fantastic. Shared a pizza and some avocado egg rolls which were delicious! This place is close to home and we will be back!
Courtney G.,"Carlsbad, CA",123,26,165,5.0,7/15/2014,Ordered the fettuccine Alfredo and side Cesar salad. Yum yum and yum. I order this pasta almost every time I come. Or the cajan  chicken pasta is also a home run. More on the spicy side but very flavorful.  The beers are amazing. You pretty much can't go wrong ordering any beer. What's amazing is that they offer a few tasters that you are able to try multiple types of beers and so you aren't limited to having to settle for just one taste.  Everyone already knows that the pizookies are to die for. If you have enough room for a little somethin share one! You won't regret it. They also offer a mini size in select options but the main ones are offered in mini version! My personal favorite is the Oreo chocolate with vanilla ice cream :) Getting hungry just thinking about it :)
Melissa A.,"Oceanside, CA",8,15,2,2.0,5/8/2016,Food was good but the service was not great! They didn't have enough staff to support the crowd they had. Lots of open tables yet we still waited 20 mins to be seated. I can only assume because they didn't have enough servers. Brought us appetizers but no utensils so we had to wait for someone to come back. Every time we would need something we hesitated to ask for it because it would take forever for them to come back with it.  Not a great dining experience overall.
Jim K.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,1,,3.0,2/13/2017,"Although the events of my original review stand, I appreciate that the manager cared enough to contact me in an effort to make things right. This hopefully means BJ's will do their best not to have this problem recur going forward."
Baylee O.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,9,1,2.0,1/14/2017,"Tonight I ordered 2 pizzas using the online ordering service. The website seemed like they made it really easy to get what you want. I myself ordered the Mediterranean with the chicken and pepperoncinis on one side only. When we got there everything seemed to be running smooth but thankfully we checked the pizza before leaving. Chicken was on the whole thing which is not doable as I am a vegetarian. Our curbside attendant was polite and apologized and clarified what we wanted and went to go have it remade. Well the new one comes about 20 minutes later. Still wrong. This is a negative review towards the pizza chef and preps as it should not be this hard to make a $30 pizza right with one try let alone two. While I was extremely disappointed with the chefs, Dalton who helped us did an amazing job. He had a great personality, was funny, apologetic, and asked what he could do to make this right. Way to go Dalton! Horrible job from the chefs as the pizza was wrong and honestly not even good. There should be more than 4 olives on a $27 pizza."
Rhomel D.,"Oceanside, CA",801,364,82,3.0,5/24/2014,"Why 3 stars instead of 4? Reason being is because I personally think there is hundreds of places like BJ's and what only separates them from other similar restaurants, is there wide selection of there home brewed beers...without that, there more like Chilis but with more seating and less crying babies. Their food is delicious and their service here is somewhat of a hit or a miss...I came here a few nights ago and the restaurant was not even a quarter packed. Well the 2 hostess they had working were not professional (checking their cell phone, chit chatting about what they were gonna do for the weekend) and we were seated waiting for a hostess to seat us. The whole time I was staring at them and I didnt think either one of them was going to seat us and to my surprise one of them looked up and it was the one looking at her cell phone and the first thing she said was ""oh, crap im sorry"" Yeah.....oh crap is right. From there it didnt seem like it could get any better from there but it slowly did. I asked our server if they could make me an Old Fashion with Tequila and she said she would go check. She came back and told me that the manager said it would cost me $20 for that drink!?!? ARE YOU SERIOUS??? That drink is normally $10 no more than that, so I went ahead to choose a different drink that wouldnt cost more than their expensive pasta dish. Then our server came back and she said she spoke with another bartender and she said it would only cost me $10 if I still wanted it. So, I went for it! Overall after the seating experience and confusion with the drink pricing it turned out a pretty good night. Without my humorous conversation with my gf and poking fun at some of the people who were dining I probably wouldnt of had given this place 3 stars. But im a bit of a harsh critic (straight to the point). Tip:I would come here on a Monday-Thursday if you want stellar service."
Joseph W.,"Oceanside, CA",12,21,7,5.0,6/25/2015,"I think I am hooked on this place! The menu selection is awesome. The beer is excellent! The price is just right! On the way home, nice to stop in and relax! Stop in and check it out."
Joe S.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,14,,2.0,7/25/2015,"I really wanted to like BJ's.  Having just moved to Carlsbad, my wife and I have been trying to find a casual place with good food and drink and a friendly atmosphere for our two young kids.   The atmosphere is nice.  We have no complaints with this or the service.  Even though the number one complaint with this restaurant seems to be the service, we haven't experience anything resembling poor service.  My biggest gripe is with the food.   I'm a big salad guy.   I know it's not very manly and I do eat red meat from time to time.  I usually seek out an ahi tuna salad if I can find one.  BJ's has this along with a few other good looking salads (at least from the menu perspective).  I ordered the ahi salad for myself and my wife hoping for the best.  What came out of the kitchen was one of the biggest abominations for an ahi tuna salad I have ever seen.  Where do I start.   The greens: browning on the edges, drenched in dressing that seemed to be applied at least an hour or two ago.  The tuna: you simply cannot cut slices of tuna hours ahead of time and expect them to stay fresh.  The tuna had already started to oxidize and turn brown.  Nothing close to the nice red color you usually see at good restaurants. The avocado: overripe and oxidized brown just like the rest of the ingredients.   I was hoping this was an anomaly.  The salads had obviously been prepared some time ago and stashed in a fridge.  You could tell because all ingredients (including the bowl) were all at the same temperature.  Kinda like when you order a salad from McDonalds.   The rare tuna should be served closer to room temperature than the salad for best flavor.    After expressing our concern to the waiter, he apologized and brought out two new ahi salads.   Prior to bringing out the salads, I politely asked the waiter to have the kitchen make two fresh salads instead of bringing us soggy salads from the fridge.   To our horror the new salads looked the same, if not worse than the previous!  Unbelievable!  I've come to the conclusion that BJ's likes to cut big corners by preparing dishes ahead of time and simply reheating or pulling dishes out of the fridge.  Items are not being made to order.  Another small nit picky item is with the soup we ordered.  I asked the waiter to have the soup brought out with the entree salads.  Not 2 minutes after we order, the soup is brought to our table.  I tell the waiter that the soup will be stone cold by the time our salads comes out.  He takes the soup back and brings it out with the entrees. Here's the kicker.  The soup is cold!  Like they left it in the kitchen while the salads were prepared!  Better tomato soup can be had at Panera.  At least they will bring it to you piping hot :) Long story short, we left hungry having not eaten dinner.  At least we didn't have to pay for the gross salads. We won't be going back...which is a shame.  I wanted to like BJ's."
Lorenzo M.,"Whittier, CA",1,9,,1.0,4/22/2016,Would give them ZERO IF I COULD. I have eaten at bj's all over LA county.  But I ate at the one in Carlsbad and never have I felt like a second class  citizen. Seeing other races being treated the way they were made me sick.  We NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN.  Will go to Miguels at least they treat everyone the same there.. would give them a ZERO star if I could..
Krista S.,"San Diego, CA",2,92,3,2.0,6/8/2016,"This place is usually my favorite, but this was my first time to the Carlsbad location, and I don't know if I'll be back!  Just me and my bf, got some pizza and an appetizer. Our waiter took forever to serve us and after sitting for 45 minutes, waiting for him to come back with our check, we finally just grabbed someone else to close us out. Basically no service, which is what you are paying for when you go to eat out.  We wanted a pizzookie at the end, but by the time we waited 45 minutes, we were over it. No pizzookie for us. I'm only giving it a few stars because the pizza was good! Deep dish, and clean atmosphere!"
Brittanie P.,"Escondido, CA",0,8,,1.0,2/16/2017,"If I could give less than 1 star I would. My husband and I are a big fan of BJ's. This was our 1st time down in Carlsbad and it will most certainly be our last. While the food was great, the service and overall experience was awful. Our waitress has 0 patience and 0 customer service. She rushed everything as far as taking our offer but it took about 30 minutes if not longer for us to get our food. Upon leaving, the hostesses would rather gossip and talk bad about customers rather than greet incoming and outgoing customers. Management needs to get a better grasp on the understanding of customer service."
Cassandra C.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,8,,5.0,8/1/2016,"First off, the music is awesome at this restaurant! Upbeat and very current. All the staff were dressed nicely and were very warm and friendly. We were served by Andrew and he did an amazing job making sure we got everything we needed. I got the penne asparagus shrimp with tomato sauce, topped with cheese and bread crumbs. I am SO happy I chose this! I could not stop eating it! We had a coupon for a free pazooki and it was so warm and delicious and a ton of ice cream!! I will definitely come back to this location!"
Donald S.,"San Diego, CA",0,32,,1.0,1/1/2017,"I realize now that not only do I dislike this place, I actually hate it. I've been here 4 different times. The service is always slow. They forget about reservations. They've left paper in my food. Idk it's just ridiculous."
Mayra D.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",61,33,20,3.0,7/2/2016,Great place to grab dinner or lunch while away working. Pretty consistent and great service.
Logan L.,"San Marcos, CA",1,13,6,5.0,12/24/2016,"We came here for my sisters baby shower and I'm so glad we did. Our server , Ryan, was extremely helpful and went above and beyond his duties. He was the only server for a party of 15 and was fast, accommodating , polite , and took so much stress off of me as a host. BJs set up everything for us and helped us take it all down, especially our server. If you need a place for a large party, I highly recommend this location."
Rashmi N.,"San Diego, CA",32,7,,2.0,5/31/2015,"I was shopping with a group of girls at the outlet mall near this BJ's and came here with a group. The service was extremely slow. They first off forgot to get us appetizers we ordered , and than just made a show of providing a plate of the appetizer . The food which came finally was good though . This  place would have been a good experience if the service was just a little better."
Isabel B.,"Solana Beach, CA",34,14,2,1.0,4/7/2016,"So my sister and I came in here for lunch while waiting for the car to be serviced.  First thing noticed, was the array of French fries left under the table. Then the Waitress, Michelle E., was not attentive, not friendly. Not timely. Did not get my order correct. Did not check up on us to see if we needed anything. The caprese was soggy, I've had better at which which. Then she thought I was going to leave her a 13 dollar tip asking if I wanted the change. Ha. I wasn't happy at all, I have been to different BJ restaurants before and never received bad service. Definitely won't return to this location."
Chris K.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",144,284,4,2.0,3/15/2015,"Disappointing. Two things here:  The service- the girl had little interest in really being a server who wants to please the guests. I wish I had gotten her name. She was too much business and attitude and not enough friendly. But here's the really upsetting part: my friend and I were on our second beers after finishing dessert when she came by and said, ""You guys are holding up my table. Just kidding!"" as if were camping at her table and keeping another group from sitting there and not allowing more tips in her pocket. Were were enjoying the beers we bought from her and catching up on conversation! No crime, right? But immaturity and lack of experience got the best of her. I should have called her over and explained that what she said was inappropriate.   The food- underwhelming. I got the shrimp tacos. Tortillas with some shrimp and white sauce with some chopped tomatoes mixed in. There was a lot of empty space in those tortillas. The guacamole that comes with it seems mixed with sour cream so don't be too surprised when it tastes a little off.  I've had better experiences at other BJs. I hope if I return to one that it's a step up from this experience."
Jaime F.,"San Marcos, CA",5,186,3,5.0,5/13/2016,Had a great experience here tonight. Anthony did a fantastic job.  My salad came out a little messed up (but nothing to complain about) and he noticed and brought out another one. Totally unasked. I will come back again if they keep hiring servers like this.
