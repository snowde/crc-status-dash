John S.,"Minneapolis, MN",76,4,,1.0,6/13/2017,"Went here to celebrate a friend's birthday who was 26, her ID expired at midnight that day and the waitress who was nice said she had to check with the manager. She came back and said she could be served according to the manager. I asked to speak with the manager. She came out with a ""can't help you, won't listen"" kind of face. I said we are obviously here for a birthday, she's not driving, we come here often... she interrupted and with the same face said ""it's expired."" I asked if she thought that this ID was fake, again said this is not a matter if she is driving, it's still proof of identification... she again interrupted in a very rude and unprofessional way ""Its expired.""   Our group was six people, we all agreed that was handled very disrespectfully and we won't be going back. Poor and unprofessional management."
Sam M.,"Oceanside, CA",0,4,1,5.0,5/17/2017,I had my sons birthday dinner party at BJs for a group of 40 people.  The service was excellent and the the manager and the staff were friendly and very accommodating to all of our requests.  The food was delicious and fresh and amazing!!!!!!!!  Thank you for making this event an enormous success.
Dennis H.,"Bakersfield, CA",153,4,1,2.0,5/9/2017,I ordered a lemon drop martini and when it came it had salt on the rim..I asked if they could take it back and do it with a sugar rim..they took back the drink and seems like they poured out the drink and put sugar on the rim and brought it back..like I could not taste the salt..it came back warm and still had salt.
Amanda A.,"San Diego, CA",0,8,,5.0,5/7/2017,"Came in last night right before closing after a few beers with friends, originally ordered our food to go but asked if we could stay, Jack helped us out and made us feel like we could take our time, he had perfect costumer service. It was ta great topper to our night, thank you BJs Carlsbad for hiring a staff that takes care of there costumers no matter, and thank you for such a great experience jack!"
Reese S.,"Chula Vista, CA",100,10,45,5.0,9/24/2016,Family dinner at BJs. Arrived around 5:15pm and only waited 5 minutes to be seated! Niko our server was extremely friendly and made sure we were enjoying our dinner. Ordered a large BJ classic combo which is one of my favorite. The pizza can definitely feed a family of 4. I can always count on their tomato and mozzarella salad.
Gabbi W.,"Oceanside, CA",127,140,352,3.0,4/11/2015,"BJs has lots of yummy options to choose from. I usually have a difficult time choosing what to get! They're cocktail list and wine list is extensive, although the cocktails are usually too sweet for my taste. They have some fun choices for appetizers as well- tonight my husband and I got the deep dish nachos (using Fritos!). The pizzas are yummy. And of course, most importantly, the pizookie are out of this world. The gluten free chocolate chip pizookie is good too.  Service can be kind of slow, depending on how much staff they have and how busy they are (they seem understaffed when we come) but the foods always consistent."
Cyn T.,"Oakland, CA",52,293,946,3.0,2/24/2016,We ordered a flatbread pizza and a burger. The pizza was just okay. You tasted more bread than sauce or meat.' The burger was rather delicious. I substituted the fries for a tomato mozzarella salad. It was delicious as well. I wish they gave you more of it.  The presentation of it on the plate made it look like a dessert. The service was just okay until Vuc took over for our waitress. He was very courteous and attentive. The noise in the restaurant was louder than usual.  Overall the visit was decent.
Sheri S.,"Monterey, CA",103,2,1,3.0,4/28/2017,Very disappointed with the fish and the shrimp tacos over cooked and too much cabbage 5 chips as a side dish It was not what I expected from BJs
Holly S.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,9,3,5.0,5/18/2017,"We had a great evening out and a great meal. The staff was amazing our waiter Chauncey made sure we were well taken care of, he went above and beyond most servers. It was well worth every penny we spent."
Leon H.,"Oceanside, CA",25,37,102,5.0,11/20/2015,"Great place and good food. A friend and I met here for lunch around 3pm, which was perfect if you're trying to avoid a big crowd and the crazy dinner rush; this place gets crowded for dinner. Our server was sweet and very attentive during our visit. She kept our water glasses full without us even asking, um hell yeah!  My friend ordered the balsamic chicken plate with a beer and I went with a ""Sweet Pig"" mini pizza with a Caesar salad, and of course a margarita , well just because.  They have a full bar (um hell yeah) and parking is always a hit or miss. Busy nights means you'll have to walk off a few pounds before you eat and then walk them off again afterwards. We got there at slow time so most parking spots were open. Tons of food and drinks options, the menus are booklets lol. The only regret I have is not ordering a Pizookie!"
Andrew J.,"Vista, CA",115,103,638,4.0,11/13/2015,"I came here on Veterans day, and this place was really busy. I came alone and the wait was still about 15 min. I tried out the vanilla cream soda and the new hickory brisket and bacon burger. It was a pretty good sized hamburger and there were plenty of fries on the side. The burger had some char around the edges and gave it a taste like it was cooked on a BBQ grill. The sauce was a sweeter kind of BBQ sauce, it was good, but I think it would be better a little spicier. I could only finish half of it because I had a lot of fries on the side. The soda was pretty good, and after I finished it the waitress asked if I wanted to try one of the other flavors. I tried the black cherry soda, and it was much better than the vanilla one. The menu says they're made with real sugar and brewed by them, so I thought that was pretty cool. The service was good, but a bit slow because of the whole veterans day thing. It makes it tough on the workers when they're a few miles away from a military base and everyone is coming for a free meal. I'll have to come back to try the jambalaya sometime."
Kevin A.,"Riverside, CA",2,29,14,3.0,3/9/2016,"Had lunch here with a few co-workers - it was just OK.  The service was great. Really nice people here. No complaints on the service front.  We started with the boneless chicken wings. Sriracha flavored. I had to ask the waiter if they made a mistake and sent us wings with no flavor. They were dry, breaded, and very little flavor. There were a ton on the plate which was good - nice portion size.  The ranch they served with it was super runny.  I ordered a ribeye - probably a mistake. Not seasoned well and not very good. I had it with asparagus and broccoli. The asparagus was way over salted.  This place will do in a pinch, but not my favorite."
Chris M.,"Oceanside, CA",0,39,,1.0,3/9/2017,"I get to-go food from this BJ'S time to time. Every single time they tell me ""about 30 minutes"". I arrive after 30 minutes then have to wait another 30 minutes until the food is actually in my hands. Food is good, employees are nice, but I have no idea what is going on in that kitchen. This place needs to step up and actually put food out in a timely manner."
Fun C.,"San Diego, CA",255,366,795,3.0,11/20/2015,"Food was meh... Pizzas used to be much better. Service was slow once it got busy, drinks were pricey, and heaters were poorly monitored. Too many choices around, so... Carla tried hard and was very friendly."
Andy K.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",17,101,33,4.0,12/21/2016,"We had a holiday dinner for our employees, had to wait a while past our reservation time before we could sit down. Waiter forgot two extra appetizers we ordered. I had a sirloin steak, it was prepared good but too much fat in the steak. Over all the service was good. Portions were good. My colleague had the penne pasta and he said it lacked flavor. Anyway they do have great pizza and great beers."
Jackie I.,"Carlsbad, CA",176,106,523,4.0,10/7/2015,"I've always felt that BJ's is an overrated place so it's hardly ever a first choice of mine. Met some friends here for lunch on a Saturday and because I ""tend"" to run late, I didn't have to sit and wait like my friends did haha. So far so good.  The service was great. We had two female servers (didn't quite get their names) and they did an awesome job. They were on top of things, which I appreciated. There were a few of us at the table and our servers were very patient, plus there were 3 kids too-it can get a little crazy at times. Phong, the manager came to our table and visited for a few minutes, super nice guy! Definitely a plus! The food was fine. Our side of the table ordered a medium sized deep dish pizza (BJ's favorite) and a couple side salads-definitely enough for 3 people! We boxed up what we couldn't finish as it was pretty filling! It was all well flavored, can't complain!  And finally the pizookie!!! Heard nothing but great things about this dessert so we had to indulge. We got a half salted caramel and half chocolate chip with some vanilla ice cream to top it off. Delicious is an understatement!!! I'm going to have to order one of those again.   I'm sure I'll come by again!"
Leone P.,"Encinitas, CA",0,4,,5.0,9/3/2017,Every time we come to this location we have good service. The food that we order is good and we never have any issues at this location. We have been to others that have not been as clean or well staffed.
Kaitlyn M.,"Oceanside, CA",0,4,,5.0,4/24/2017,"Went here last week and had the best time ever!! I came with a few of my girlfriends, and we fell in love with our handsome bartender Vuk. We were overwhelmed with the beer choices so we had Vuk choose for us, and he made the best choices. We are coming back next week just so we can chat with our new fav bartender!!"
Michael C.,"Redondo Beach, CA",165,206,363,4.0,10/23/2015,"Went here on a Saturday night (03OCT?) after attending a 6yr old girl's bday party. The wide, delicious beer selection was uplifting. Busy as the place was, we were seated after only 5-10 minutes and had attentive service all night long. All the waiters and hostesses were friendly, not just our waiter. We had a burger, salad, and some nacho appetizer thing. The food is consistent with other BJ's: good for a chain.  Ask for Tommy. He had great recommendations for beer as well as sweet wines and desserts (some brownie/cookie ice cream decadent thing) for the gf. Great waiter. Can get pretty loud when they're full. It's also a bit dark inside. Still a pretty good escape from the crazy car salesmen nearby."
Diamond M.,"Rialto, CA",98,120,201,2.0,1/11/2016,"First off i live in rancho cucamonga and there's a bjs by the Ontario mills it's awesome. anyways,  Its my 3yr olds birthday so we came to this bjs before getting to legoland.  What a disappointment. Santa fe spring rolls which i love had this tomato garnish on them that made them soggy. My sons mac n cheese was cold and dry. I ordered the ribeye with mashed potatoes and steamed veggies. Ill post the pic i took. They were cold and sad."
