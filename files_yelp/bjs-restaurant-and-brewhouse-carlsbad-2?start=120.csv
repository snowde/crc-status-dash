Guy T.,"Lakeland, FL",32,11,2,5.0,3/15/2017,"Amazing bison burger!  It's simple to let the meat provide most of the flavor. The Jeremiah Red ale is one of the best reds I've ever had. The baked beignet with strawberries , vanilla bean ice cream and fresh made whipped cream is so bomb I'm surprised this joint is still standing. If you're in town and like food and beer, then you have to stop in!"
Daniel D.,"San Marcos, CA",8,143,106,2.0,9/13/2015,"Not a good place to bring your kids/family. The food was great, but service was not.  I'm a fan of BJs. They have good food, delicious lunch specials and decent beer. I've often frequented over the years. We went to the one in Carlsbad for the first time last week. Same food and drink experience (which including the pizookie would make this a five star rating) but a very poor service experience. Our server was curt, short with us and rude. With our 19 month old there, he wanted nothing to do with our table. He was friendly and flirtatious with the table of girls next to us but rarely said a word at our table. We seemed like an inconvenience to him the whole time. The last blow, we forgot our daughter's blanket at the table and when we came back, he had thrown it away. I mean, who throws away a kids ""blankie""? We like the chain so we'll go to others but I don't expect to return to this location (except to dig in the dumpster for a lost family member)."
Darci C.,"Oceanside, CA",0,3,,1.0,4/4/2017,"We got BJ's to go tonight we both got a ""bowl"" of soup and salad. I use the word bowl loosely. It was about 5 bites of mediocre soup and a pathetic excuse for a salad. Bummer we won't be partaking in BJ's to go again"
Ailidh S.,"Torrance, CA",103,6,8,1.0,6/21/2016,"BAMBOOZLED I HAVE BEEN. Paid $24 for a veg pizza and $16 for cheese pizza. Was there sauce? No. Was there an extreme amount of bread? Yes. Was this disguised Pizza Hut? Possibly. Am I disappointed? Most definitely. Will I come back? No, I don't live in Carlsbad.    -frustrated from LA"
Michael M.,"Bayfield, CO",50,9,2,3.0,10/13/2016,"Good food, great service. Had the shrimp tacos which were good. Also had the hefenwiesen as well as the piranha pale ale. Both did a great job of giving me a buzz as well as tasting fresh and enjoyable. Well done!"
Joe A.,"Hemet, CA",12,11,1,5.0,2/6/2017,"This is one of my favorite places to eat. I love their deep dish pizza's, the California chicken club is one of the best. But my go to is the roast beef dip. Delish, the staff is super friendly on busy days and like today when it's slow and rainy. Keep up the amazing job."
Alice S.,"San Diego, CA",117,212,173,5.0,4/21/2016,"I went here for dinner a little while ago with my boyfriend and had such a good time, I could not resist reviewing even though it is a little late. I love the bj restaurant chain in general. They have a wide selection and they do everything pretty well. Good quality ingredients! The reason I am rating this particular bj restaurant so highly is because of our server, tommy. The food was consistently good quality, but our server's entertaining friendliness and good recommendations made the dinner perfect. So if you go to bj's ask to be seated in tommy's section! He is so friendly that we both felt welcome immediately. He was prompt on service and checked in on us regularly to make sure we didn't need anything/liked our food. His cookie ice cream dessert dish was a good recommendation and the perfect way to finish a good meal. Next time we drive through Oceanside, stopping by here again!"
Anonymous A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,77,1,5.0,2/8/2017,"Based on outdoor seating: Great food, great location. Dog friendly!"
Robert M.,"Fontana, CA",0,12,8,5.0,9/4/2016,Just had lunch with my family. This was a great experience. The food was good. The service was even better. We were seated fast and our orders were taken quickly. Our waiter Taylor C did a great job. He made sure we had refills and was very accommodating. The entire staff did a good job of working together. The management should recognize his hard work.  Good job BJ's.
Keith N.,"Carlsbad, CA",178,135,104,5.0,8/4/2014,"Absolutely amazing customer service. David was an amazing bartender and very helpful on my order and helped find a couple great deals. Ken, unfortunately, let me know that the avocado rolls were sold out. I let him know that those were the main reason I was there and he was MORE than accommodating on my tab.  Service like that gets my repeat business any day. Tl;Dr: Great food, amazing service, great HH drinks."
Kyle B.,"Murrieta, CA",144,2,,5.0,8/8/2017,Seriously impressed with the service on the patio last night for dinner our children loved the attention our server gave them we will be back for sure!!! Thank you Brooke!!!
Michael T.,"Oceanside, CA",0,6,1,2.0,5/10/2016,"Starting off, got seating quite easily, no wait. Got our drinks about 10 minutes later (normal beverages). Then waited about 50 minutes just to get our order taken, ordered appetizers and waited about another 40 minutes.  The variety of the menu is astounding!  Although the service isn't up to par. Got the food (wings and pot stickers) and the quality of the food was great!  The place wasn't too packed and to my knowledge don't understand why service wasn't as well as it should've been.  So I'm giving this 2 stars due to the service not matching up to the quality of the food."
Raschelle D.,"Oceanside, CA",0,2,,5.0,8/5/2017,My family went to this location last night for dinner. We were seated right away. Food was great. We tried the prime rib and it was delicious. Thanks for a memorable evening BJS. We will keep coming back
Kara K.,"San Diego, CA",574,414,127,4.0,6/6/2014,"I just love BJ's blonde!  We sat at the bar tonight- the server was pretty darn on point.  I wish I knew the servers/bartenders name, she had dark hair in a bun.  We had the ever tasty ahi poke, sweet pig pizza and salad-- delicious!  It's always clean, good temp and we didn't have to wait to sit at bar.  Only down falls , literally are falls... The floor on the way to the restroom is always sooooo slippery! The very best thing about this bj's ... This where the place that my baby and I had out first date ever!! Xoxo"
Lisa P.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,15,,1.0,8/25/2016,"I had dinner and dessert with friends (3 adults and 3 children) and our service was ridiculous, in a bad way! It took two full hours start to finish and we only ordered entrees and desserts. Servers kept trying to bring other orders to our table. Disorganized and very slow!!! When you have young hungry kids this is not the ideal!!!!  Update: it's still horrible!"
Amanda H.,"Vista, CA",72,64,164,3.0,4/29/2016,"Came here around 6pm on a Thursday for father in laws 72bd birthday. Server was very slow and didn't have great social or customer service skills. Pizza came out cold and we had to track down our server to send it back to be rewarmed. I ordered the Mahi Mahi for myself. It tasted good but I was sick for the rest of the night. Server never returned to check on us and as how everything was. We ordered a birthday pazooki but it never arrived so we just left. Pretty disappointing birthday experience. If it were my birthday Id be very sad and disappointed at the experience. I know it's not a bad place as this is my third time. However, if you choose a place for a birthday it should be special."
Stephanie L.,"Oceanside, CA",227,25,3,5.0,6/29/2016,"This place is nothing short of amazing. Favorite spot to try different drafts, enjoy a game and a pizookoe (or two). The staff is always on point here, with excellent customer service. Tip: call ahead to reserve your party on a wait list to dodge more time in the lobby instead of a table.  Favorite dish here is the Parmesan Crusted Chicken with the sides of garlic mashed potatoes and broccoli. C'est magnifique!"
Sydney T.,"Garden Grove, CA",39,537,2458,4.0,9/27/2015,"This is the second time coming here.  Food is good and friendly service.  We ordered jambalaya pasta, grill salmon, chicken, and pizza.  Pizza is crispy and delicous. Plenty if parking and lively atmosphere.  Right across the street from the outlet."
Tim M.,"Camarillo, CA",44,44,117,2.0,4/23/2016,Things that were bad: -a 1/2 hour wait -order was wrong.. 3 mistakes at our table of 3 people -prices were high It is noisy and crowded so they are doing something right.. perhaps the beer?
Jeremy S.,"Encinitas, CA",913,1252,2270,4.0,4/24/2015,"Not really a big fan of this chain of restaurants... That being said, this location is probably the best BJs that I have been too and it's not really even close. This location is super clean, well appointed and the bar is absolutely immaculate. The menu here is ridiculously large and it makes it hard to order food, which is why I tend to only grab drinks and desserts here, the pazooki is ridiculous. Mmm, white chocolate macadamia nut is top notch. Can't really say too much about the food as I'm not a fan of chain restaurants or deep dish pizza... I'd recommend coming here, kicking back at the bar and grabbing a good beer while watching the game.  Pros- Beer Bar Location Service Seating Cleanliness Desserts Huge portions Cons- Food Menu size"
