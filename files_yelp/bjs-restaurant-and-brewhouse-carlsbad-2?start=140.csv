Ly T.,"San Diego, CA",73,143,342,3.0,5/22/2016,"I always love coming to Bj's! The food is usually always great, great beers and service is usually also great. This time around I guess there was a confusion in sections. My son and I got sat down and waited awhile and wasn't sure who our server was. Finally a guy came over asked if we have been helped or anyone came by to introduce them self yet. I said no, no one hasn't. Anyhow he told me he will be right back and see you is my server. He came back and said my server will be right with me. Anyhow he went to go get us water which was great...after awhile still waiting for my server. At that point! My 5 year old is hungry and and getting impatient.  Our server finally came and helped us. She apologized and I understand there was just a confusion. It happens. So overall service was good. But when my pizza came out the pizza was salty and felt over seasoned wasn't that good. Was disappointed in the quality this time. So I'm giving 3 stars for the food not really for the service. Not sure if I wanna go back to this bj's again."
Dani W.,"Vista, CA",191,137,20,4.0,7/8/2015,"Walked in for lunch after car shopping. The hostess obviously didn't want to be there (it was the Friday before July 4th). She didn't make eye contact with us and just did her standard script, ""please wait here"" and the waitress took us back to our table.  Thankfully our waitress was much more attentive. I ordered the caprese salad to start and the margherita flat bread. While my partner ordered a bacon cheeseburger - it was to be topped with onion straws, but it was served at the table without them. The waitress said she didn't want to hold our food because the onion straws weren't ready?! Those kinds of things make the whole burger, so why not hold it under the lamp while the onion straws are being cooked and serve the whole thing or at least give the customer the option. My food was good, nothing that I would say was exceptional, but was okay.  We'll be back because it's a good location and good food and one of those nice happy hour places."
Adam Q.,"Carlsbad, San Diego, CA",42,1,,2.0,3/26/2016,"I have never had a problem with the food here, nor with the servers themselves. The problem I have had--not only today when I went for lunch, but every time I have eaten here--is that of trying to find any help mid-meal in a decent amount of time. Today's experience included having a hard time acquiring: drink refills, silverware (after our food had arrived), half of the food order, the check (both to be dropped off and to have our cards run), and two to-go pazookies. Altogether we spent a little over two hours in the restaurant when we could have been--and very much would have liked to have been--out in half of the time. I work in a restaurant. I know the struggles and I'm not one to complain, but when the restaurant is not busy and service somehow seems to reach every table but your own, that is an issue that should be acknowledged."
Jason F.,"La Mesa, CA",0,7,,1.0,7/21/2017,"Came in here the other day had the worst service I've ever received at a restaurant in my entire life.  The staff was very rude, did not make eye contact, and acted like my wife and I were a burden.  Drinks were not re-filled the entire meal.  Food took 30 mins to arrive, and we had a very simple order that included soup and chicken alfredo.  Waiter didn't check on us for up to 30 mins after we ordered our food.  Finally had to ask another waitress for a water refill, and she didn't make eye contact or even respond to us.  She just left and came back a few minutes later with a water pitcher. When I attempted to order another soup, it took another 20 minutes to arrive and was luke warm.  TERRIBLE Service and RUDE staff, I won't be coming here again."
Shelby M.,"San Diego, CA",1,15,5,5.0,12/23/2016,"I come here often because the bartender Johnny is a true professional.  He always remembers what I want and how picky I can be.  the variety on the food and cocktail menu is outstanding! Something for everyone. I haven't even had their pizza yet and I have been here probably 100 times. I love the rib special on Thursdays. And mmm the pizookie is perfect for ""cheat day"". They change up their house brews and guest taps so I gotta keep going back to try them all! I have encountered excellent service from every single friendly employee even if they weren't my server. I met the lead manager Jack Everett today and he definitely won me over for life! They truly care that you have a good experience and will go out of their way to be sure you are satisfied. Brynn was very attentive  to my questions even when she was clearly busy. THANK YOU ALL for creating an excellent restaurant for my family and for our corporate lunches. BJ'S Rocks!!"
Beckve B.,"Temecula, CA",1,14,13,2.0,1/13/2017,"Overall the experience was so so. If you're coming strictly for the service I wouldn't hold your breath, if you're coming strictly for the food- it's not that great I would consider going somewhere else. I first started with a wait of about 40 minutes to get in, understandably as it is a Friday night. However, once we were finally seated it took too long to get appetizers and our meals. Our first appetizer came and was actually incorrect- we requested our boneless wings however we received wings with bone in which was not what we had requested. The meals themselves were okay. I ordered the cherry glazed salmon which was good but the snow peas had a very tarty almost sour sauce which actually hurt my stomache. The children ordered corn dogs, chicken strips, and mini burgers which they consumed without a problem so I'm assuming all was fine. However my husband ordered a shrimp jambalaya with chicken as a substitute and it was bland. The cook simply put a lot of spices on the plate rim itself so as not to put it in the food. We had to constantly ask our server or look for our server for things we needed such as ketchup, refills, napkins etc. We waited about 20 minutes after the meal was completed in order to be able to receive our check to go. All in all, not worth the $90 for dinner. I will not be coming back to ANY BJ restaurant, I will spend my money elsewhere."
Kameron P.,"San Diego, CA",1,31,855,1.0,1/8/2017,"My girlfriend and I have been loyal customers at bjs but last night was just to much. We were told the wait would be 15 minutes. After waiting 40 minutes to be seated we were sitting for 45 more minutes without a single waiter or waitress coming up to us where all the other tables around us were being assisted. There goes an hour and a half of our time. When leaving I let the hostess know and she just looked confused. And I asked to speak to the manager and after 5 minutes no one showed up. A big F U to us, thanks. Bad part on you bjs. Someone that's been to this location 25+ times and this wasn't even the first time I had an issue with this location, just the first time I decided to let you guys know. Instead went to Texas road house and I must say their service is far better and good is cheaper with greater portions. Don't waste your time with the ass clowns. I learned my lesson."
Rylee H.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,4,2,5.0,1/7/2017,"Came in for dinner tonight with my boyfriend and it was the best experience I've ever had at BJ's because of Tila! She was so sweet, attentive, and personable. I'll be back and requesting her again!"
Amber G.,"Beaumont, CA",20,8,1,2.0,6/12/2016,"Food was the same as any BJs I've been to, service was average, but the major thing was how incredibly dirty it was. There were napkins, paper and major spills everywhere. The women's bathroom was over flowing with paper towels and water puddles. And as former server myself I wanted to start picking up trash and wanted to ask if I could have a sani bucket so I could start to wipe down tables to help out. And of course the classic manager at the host stand instead of seeing if any servers or bussers need help.  Aren't us servers and ex servers the worst people to wait on?"
D. C.,"Wilton, CT",0,64,2,4.0,4/28/2016,"Place was understandably PACKED on a Friday evening. We needed a good place to eat after Legoland (which, btw, has GREAT food - not your typical garbage food). Had to wait about a half hour for a table, which wasn't too bad given how crazy busy they were. Beer selection is absurd. And I mean that in a good way! Had the red ale, which was delicious, while waiting.  Server was very friendly. I'm having a hard time remembering what the kids had, but the wife and I both had the deep dish pizzas. Honestly, I'd rate them a 4. I've had REAL deep dish in Chicago many times and in other places. This was very, very ""bready."" I had the pepperoni supreme. It was good, but the overload of bread/crust just stuffs you quickly. I'd argue that it's not made fresh on premises. So, they need to work on that. I would get something else next time. Overall, a decent experience and we'd probably go back if we were ever out that way again. Next time, we'll make a reservation!"
Eric E.,"Carlsbad, CA",1,7,1,2.0,6/8/2016,"Super bummed to be leaving this review...  I want to make it clear that I have loved this restaurant for years and have been to a ton of locations.  This was my first time at this location and not a good experience for me.   Short version : We had unkind, poor service that took well over an hour to have just soup and salads for lunch. My experience: I was meeting up for a quick lunch with a friend and arrived first.  I told the hostess that there would be two of us for lunch and she kindly asked me to wait at the top of the stairs (I was expecting to be met by someone who would then take me to table).  I waited there for about ten minutes, when my friend arrived.  She asked if I'd requested a table and said yes, the hostess asked me to wait here.  A few more minutes went by and the hostess finally approached us and asked if we'd been helped.  I mentioned that she asked me to wait here. Off to our seats!  Finally (elapsed time ~13 minutes)...  It was a nice day so we sat on the patio.  We discussed possibly getting a pint of the newly advertised beer and chose our food.  We sat patiently as we awaited our waitress.  Our waitress came to take our drink orders (elapsed time ~20 mins).  We asked to try to the new beer and placed our food orders -- unlimited soup and salad lunch and a cobb salad.  She said most who have tried the new beer haven't liked it, but I am a big fan of BJs beers so I thought I'd give it a try. Our food, water, and beer samplers arrived (elapsed time ~45 mins, mind you we each have hour lunch breaks).  The beer was bad.  We didn't order any after the sampler.  The food was pretty good, as to be expected from many visits to other BJs locations.  Unfortunately, because it took so long to get our food, I was unable to enjoy the ""unlimited"" aspect of my order.  We requested our check and a to go box for the rest of my friend's Cobb salad.  We kindly mentioned we needed to get going because our lunch breaks were over (elapsed time ~55 mins). My friend's schedule was a bit more strict and she called into work to let them know she'd be late.  We both work within less than a mile from this location.  After about ten minutes, she went inside to ask for the check and box.  During this time, guests at a nearby table had gotten up and left, having waited a considerable length of time for service.  My friend returned and said that our waitress, of which we'd had several, was just inside chatting up the hostess.  A few minutes later she set the check on the table and walked away, as we both sat with cards in hand, expecting to just give her our cards. Our waitress returned and took our cards (elapsed time ~65 mins).  She came back in five minutes later asking if we wanted to split it down the middle.  This was the worst part, it took another five minutes for her to return.   Conclusion: As I mentioned from the start, I am super bummed to be sharing this experience.  Now, I understand that occasionally there are staffing issues.  Occasionally someone is having a bad day.  Therefore, I will definitely be giving this place another chance, especially since I have enjoyed other locations so many times.  I hope they earn my confidence back the next go around."
Kamron D.,"Oceanside, CA",37,40,22,4.0,10/4/2016,I go to BJs about once a week with coworkers. They have wonderful lunch specials and great prices for house brewed beers. Today we had a fantastic server. Angie was so helpful and nice. The BJs app is great. You can pay your bill without having to give your debit/credit card to the server. Fast and convenient and safe! Food is consistent and on most occasions we get back to the office on time.
Dan O.,"Vista, CA",28,2,,4.0,12/20/2016,"I have to give props where props are due. Jose Luis Torres a Senior Manager at BJ's Restaurants stepped up and sent me some gift cards to try to make up for the bad experience our family had at his Carlsbad location. It seems they are sincere about good customer service my hats off Jose. Thanks, we will be back."
Nikki M.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,11,,4.0,12/15/2016,"This place is huge! It's a nice atmosphere where you could go with friends or family. We go with our 4 year old and it get a booth for the 4 of us, lots of space. Restaurant is clean and they have consistent prompt and good customer service. The menu offers way more than just pizza and salad. While the food is far from gourmet, it's great for a casual meal out."
Kaizen M.,"Tujunga, CA",0,22,9,2.0,5/22/2016,"05/22/2016 We usually dine in Bj's burbank...we tried this branch after shopping to carlsbad outlet mall. Finally we got the attention of our server after 15 minutes, after i request for a change of table and after i seek the attention of the front desk lady. Wooow I love Bj's, im a fan of this business and thier customer service practice, but my experience here is far more diffirent.... its not  good today to eat Atlantic salmon and mini pizookie."
Michael R.,"Oceanside, CA",6,124,95,3.0,8/21/2015,"Hum, dropped off at table.. oh waiter here,  beer ordered, tick-tock, tick-tock.... Hum worked out, good beer, good fried chicken"
Henry W.,"Fairfield, CA",2,18,4,1.0,7/26/2016,"Food was mediocre and the service beyond slow.  Food was either undercooked, roast chicken, or burnt, balsamic glazed chicken.  Entrees took about 50 minutes to come out.  Only saving grace was the 7 beer taster. I've had better experiences at the BJ's up by my neck of the woods so maybe it was a bad day or this BJ's was just not up to par tonight."
Teresa R.,"Vista, CA",3,5,8,1.0,5/18/2016,"A friend and I decided to swing by this place last night for the 2 for $25 they advertised.  Came in waited about 10 minutes or so to be seated. The waitress who initially helped us, I was given the impression, was rushed and not too concerned for our table. She took our drink order as well as noted we were in for the 2/$25 deal and rushed off. It was a tad busy when we arrived, however, I've seen this place at peek traffic time before and had far better of an experience then. It had most definitely thinned out by the time our table was taken over by the second waiter.  We received our drinks (2 sodas and 2 waters) and our salads soon followed. At this time she introduced us to Chris whom would be taking over the table. He seemed pleasant at first but as the night wore on proved to be inattentive and scattered.  After our salads we waited a good 30 minutes for the main dish to arrive and when it did, it was a bit overcooked and cold. At this point we just didn't care as we were already hungry. The waiter checked in maybe once with us before he brought the check. Now, this deal comes with: 2 salads, a choice of pizza and a pizookie to share. If sodas were added they were advertised to be a charge of only $1 each... Clearing that up, when we received our check we had not received the dessert yet. Chris was informed of this, yet as the waiter taking over a table it is his responsibility to take care to know these facts before closing out the bill. He expressed to us he wasn't even aware of what we had ordered and left. It then took about another 20-25 minutes to get the dessert. We received the check again and realized we were overcharged for the sodas. We paid the bill as it was considering we had been there nearly 2 hours when it was meant to be a quick dining experience. This is more so a review of service. I would come to this location quite often and would hold various business meetings here as well. I was astounded by the lack of care of the staff. They seemed more concerned with carrying on personal conversations rather than attending to the customers whom are the reason they have a job in the first place. I am sorely disappointed with the conduct displayed within this organization and it has not only been displayed to me as of last night. I have been coming here for years but am now having serious doubts as to the direction this company is headed. Sorely disappointed and doubtful I will set foot in this establishment again."
Arlene P.,"San Diego, CA",2108,1086,4222,5.0,12/6/2013,"This location is a winner. Great deep dish pizza - what BJs is known for , spacious and nice service...  plenty of bathroom stalls too...  and wow, you have to try their holiday pizookie (say holy moly!) *see picture"
Diana S.,"Solana Beach, CA",54,47,25,4.0,3/25/2016,"I came here on a Thursday night, and the lobby was packed. Fortunately we found a good table at the bar in 5 minutes. They have plenty of TVs in the bar for sports, etc. They have terrific beer! The menu is on the long side, and there were almost too many choices. Each menu item has a calorie count listed. This was especially helpful for choosing a ""healthy"" dinner. Usually I get their awesome pizza (don't look at the kcal), but that night I wanted something refreshing.  I ordered the  Asian chicken salad (~600 kcal). It was crunchy, sweet, and savory.  The price was very reasonable  (about $12). Our server checked on us often, and they refilled my water 3 times.  This is definitely one of the better chains out there."
