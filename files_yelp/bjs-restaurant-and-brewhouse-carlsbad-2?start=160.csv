Carol R.,"El Cajon, CA",18,4,,1.0,5/29/2017,"My sister and I bring our families to this restaurant every Memorial Day and Labor Day weekend since they stay in condos in Oceanside.  I always reserve us a table for 24 in the outside patio.  I made Sunday's reservation 2 months in advance.  When we arrived Sunday night there was another party outside.  I asked about our reservation and they didn't have it written down.  We had 7 children under the age of 10 waiting for dinner.  After 45 minutes they finally had 2 tables of 12 in the restaurant for our party.  One of our tables got their food 20 minutes before us and were done and ready to leave before we even got dessert.  The final straw was the visit to the ladies restroom.  There was not one stall with toilet paper and it was 9:00.  I found the manager on my way out to report the disaster in the restroom and he said OK and continued to talk with 2 employees.  He never made any compensation for our ""lost"" reservation and never came to our tables to check on us.  We have come to this BJ's for years and have never been treated so poorly."
Sarah S.,"Encinitas, CA",20,63,25,1.0,7/28/2016,"We called ahead for a party of 14 to give them enough time. Got there and they sat 10 of us together and the other 4 at another table. So much for celebrating this birthday at the same table. Then come to find out each table was in a different section with a different server. So the 4 top all had drinks while we had not even seen a server. At the end it flipped flopped, we got our checks while the four top had not seen there server since their food was dropped off. They also forgot two burgers, everyone was eating and I noticed they didn't say anything about how long do I asked. She hadn't even noticed she didn't bring them. Apparently they were given to another table. They got their burgers while everyone else was done eating. In general we spent too much time just waiting for service. We would have to flag random servers for assistance. Restaurant wasn't even that busy and they couldn't of been that short if servers had time to chat it up with the host. I don't know what happened, I don't know if the host messed up communication or what but regardless the servers were not on top of their tables. Will not return based on service and the fact that the burgers were not discounted in any way.  On another note to BJ's please do not call your pizza deep dish. It only made it halfway up the pan of that and did not have layers of cheese. Chicago Deep Dish has to be eaten with a fork, this was just a thick crusted pizza you could pick up."
Jeannine C.,"Oceanside, CA",58,25,18,4.0,3/30/2016,The server Dustin is a nice person and a good host.  He comes around and ask if you need any thing. That's a great host! Dustin is fast and friendly
Jennifer B.,"Yuba City, CA",170,25,,5.0,9/25/2016,"We really, really enjoyed the chicken tortilla soup (best I've ever had!), Caesar salad and potstickers we ordered. The food was of excellent quality, well-priced and good sized portions. But the star of our night was our server, Teela. She was so awesome. Our drinks never went empty, she was willing to make suggestions, and she saw to it that we knew about and took advantage of a promotion for a free dessert - you GOTTA try the peanut butter Pizookie with chocolate ice cream! That was Teela's favorite way to eat it, and it was DELICIOUS! She totally made our night, and we can't wait to go back!"
Adriana C.,"Oceanside, CA",49,48,73,3.0,3/6/2016,"Hostess was rude. Tons of tables were opened but she was too busy making conversation with other staff and trying harder at keeping that sourpuss face, I cant smile IDK maybe she had stomach problems... Our waiter Robert was super nice totally made up for a bad start. We'll see how the food turns out."
Elizabeth L.,"Waltham, MA",0,7,,4.0,5/12/2017,"We were hungry and tired when we walked in, and left happy and satisfied. The food was solid and tasty, the service was excellent, and the white chocolate macadamia pizookie was AMAZING."
Shelby C.,"Bothell, WA",0,5,,5.0,7/22/2016,"So this is my first time ever eating and drinking at BJ's, just walking in we had the most friendly welcoming. Full of hellos and welcome to BJ's, full of genuine smiles. Took maybe 10 min to seat us even though they were a little crowded. After we got seated (on the patio, amazing spot.. you can still watch sports from out there) we got greeted by 3 of the servers.. that has never happened to me before. I loved every minute of it!!  So coming to order food, I had a hard trying to pick what I wanted.. there were so many options!! Burgers, steaks, ribs, sushi, appetizers, deserts.. I wanted it all! So I settled for the ribs, Brussels sprouts and asparagus! ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! You would think late at night the cooks would be tired and the food would be crappy but the ribs were juicy and falling off the bone. It was spectacular, my hands and face were full of juicy goodness.  The beer was fantastic, I got the berry cider or as i like to call booze juice. If I could have ordered a growler of it I totally would.  This was the best place I've ever eaten at! I will deff be back for me.. maybe even tomorrow!!!"
Tina S.,"Carlsbad, CA",7,30,2,3.0,9/11/2016,"The hostess was friendly and we sat down right away. The server was attentive. Although he did try to give us another tables order. The menus were sticky and dirty, the seasonal table tent menu was dirty with food on it. The bathrooms were dirty as well, along with the glass doors as you walk in. Sometimes you can look the other way with things, maybe thinking they had a busy rush hour. We sat and watched server after server watching the football game on TV for a very long time. The food was not very good. Not the BJ's I remember."
Lindsey M.,"Vista, CA",204,252,320,4.0,2/26/2014,"Had me at the spinning door and sizable menu! The vibe of BJs is one of class meets sports bar, after all, it's in the beautiful city of Carlsbad. The lighting is dim, the upholstery is dark, and much of the place is wooded, making for one warm environment but look up, there's flatscreens rocking football! Date-night good or group of friends/Opening Game night good!! Our hostess was a doll, friendly and personable and our server was as equally sociable: genuine, sweet, and high-energy.  Appetizer: Spinach stuffed mushrooms! Cradled in the mushroom is artichoke dip, cheese, and a lemony pesto; how your mouth will wish there were more than 6 on the plate (3 each if you HAVE to share with your date or signif. other)  Entrees: I guess I was on a lemon  and artichoke bender, because post-appetizer I had one phenomenal plate of Tuscan Chicken Limone. Chicken so soft and delectable, nestled in angel hair pasta coated in lemon butter sauce and sprinkled with dried tomatoes and artichoke. The man had a hankering for  burger, but to take the road less traveled, he asked for the Bison burger. What? No fries!? I guess the cold slaw was going to have to suffice! Drinks: I was the only one to dabble in the alcohol the evening of our visit, but wasn't feeling the heaviness of a beer or the zest of a margarita. I settled on the Island Sunset because SVEDKA makes me happy aaaaand because the small child in my brain does dances when I see pineapple juice and orange juice in the same sentence/drink. I really enjoyed this drink until half-way through when it started to taste...really flat :( Aha! Must've been the Sierra Mist and Grenadine at work! All things considered, we had fun and enjoyed our meals/experience at BJs!"
Lindsay M.,"Temecula, CA",266,8,7,5.0,11/20/2016,We went here for a wedding rehearsal dinner and the deep dish pizzas were fabulous! Very great waiters who were there the whole time not leaving our site! Thank you for making everything stress free for our bride and grooms family and friends! Defiantly will be coming back to this location
Alyssa V.,"La Jolla, CA",606,109,28,5.0,9/30/2015,"Mozzarella Sticks + Pepperoni Extreme + Pizookie = Two Happy Girls! :) I Love BJ's!!! Wait, that sounded bad, haha. Anyway, I have been to 4 different BJ's and yes they're basically all the same. We hit this place right after the lunch rush, which was great, as we were served quickly on everything from drinks to dessert. Yes, I finally shared a Pizookie! What more can I say tat you don't already know? If you haven't been to BJ's yet, go & if you have go back and go to this location, we had a great time & enjoyed some yummy food!"
Debby H.,"San Marcos, CA",0,3,,2.0,5/1/2017,"For an early night out with kids turned out to be a bad decision.  Lack of staff, slow service and sub par food. Important to check bill as daily specials are not automatically calculated."
Jimmy K.,"San Diego, CA",199,142,22,4.0,11/24/2014,"I had a great lunch with an amazing friend of mine. Our food came in a timely manner, we sat ourselves in bar seating, and the service was pretty prompt. I did notice they were abnormally busy for a Monday early noon.  Had the fried chicken and mashed potato lunch special. Was pretty good actually. I am sure I will be ordering it again. I do love me some BJ pizza too!!"
L V.,"Vista, CA",1,15,2,2.0,9/30/2016,"This was unfortunately a very poor experience and the only reason they get two stars tonight is because the food actually does taste decent as far as restaurant chains go.  We had two kids 6 and under with us and were told 15-20 minutes for a table; this was a HORRIBLE gauge of time because the restaurant was packed. We waited an hour. 30 mins into the wait my sister went up to check on our position on the wait list and ALL THREE hostesses ignored her for five minutes before acknowledging her presence at the hostess booth, which was literally one foot away from their persons.  When we FINALLY were taken to our table an hour after arrival, one of the very very tall waiters was walking through our party to cut us off and get to a table as we walked to ours, almost kicking one of our kids because he wasn't even professional enough to wait for us to pass. RUDE.  We asked for drinks while the person who seated us blindly recited the drink menu and ignored our request before telling us our waiter would be by to serve us, and then walked off. When our waiter came 15 mins after being seated, to our chagrin, it was the really really tall waiter who almost ran one of our kids over. He didn't smile; he barely seemed pleasant. We hurriedly gave him our drink order, kids food order, and our appetizer order so we could take time to discuss entree options and whether we wanted to eat there or not. We waited another 15-20 mins and I finally had to flag someone down just so we could get our drinks. It took another five minutes before he returned with the drinks (along with six other tables drinks), and by that time our kids were falling asleep, no food for them had been served yet. It was Mac n cheese and a mini pizza. This isn't a delicacy requiring more than 10-15 min of cook time and plating.  We decided we were not going to order food, no one seemed to care, our waiter barely cared that we voiced concerns over wait time for meals, which was why we were holding off on getting food for ourselves.  When our food finally came, it was two small mushroom appetizers that were lukewarm, which meant it had been sitting out waiting to be served for a while. It was good but disappointing to find it wasn't hot and fresh.  We ordered via app Chilis to Go while we waited for our check.  Terrible service tonight, we've eaten at this location many many many times and spent hundreds of dollars, it's sad to see that as of late the quality has been unimpressive."
Alex O.,"San Marcos, CA",0,13,2,1.0,4/15/2017,"The best example of providing the WORST service. I can understand when it is the dinner rush and you are expected to wait however it was an hour of wait when we were originally told 25 minutes. After speaking with the hostess twice, another party of the same size was seated before ours and we were told to have to wait longer until they were able to group two more tables. This is not an ideal customer service situation as a big party usually gets priority in table arrangement. I do not plan to come back to this establishment since the service does not reflect proper customer satisfaction."
Chris G.,"Oceanside, CA",0,9,1,1.0,6/25/2016,"You won't believe this but this is the honest truth.  Coming home from long day with kids at water park, my family and our friends took our kids for a late night (9pm) dinner and dessert here on Saturday. None of us had ever had any negative experiences here before but tonight was all-time.  There was a 30 min wait...at 9pm!  So we snatched a big booth in the bar area.   As the busser finished cleaning and wiping down table for us I noticed what I thought to be a piece of lettuce on the floor under the table. I used my shoe to brush it to the front so that the bus boy would clean it up.  To everyone's HORROR it was a used CONDOM. How does that get there??!!!  To be honest I can't believe that I must tell you that we stayed to eat after that.  We called the manager over and while he cleaned it up with broom and he apologized, he actually did not seem overly apologetic nor did he offer/comp us anything.   If I was in his shoes I would be absolutely mortified!  We never saw him again that night.   Rest of the night: Service was very slow but we were in the quasi bar/lounge area so I could understand that a bit.  Food was average at best.  Ordered a small deep dish bbq chicken pizza. It was warm at best and not that tasty. Mostly bread With very little bbq sauce or cheese .   I ordered a beer but I had to remind the waiter 5 min later that he had not brought it to me...and we were in the bar!!! Both families ordered a pizookie dessert.  It is a cookie warmed up with 3 scoops ice cream. Our ice cream was nearly fully melted by time it arrived. It was ok but way too sugary for my taste.  My daughters clam chowder bread bowl was good.  I still cannot believe that nothing more was done for us regarding the used condom. We hoped that the table before us played a joke but the reality is likely that employees got it on after hours the night before.  #Classy! I had to come back to edit after I read a few recent reviews. After 1 review from 2 weeks ago mentioned how dirty the place was the GM replied on Yelp by saying he was sorry that their ""usual gold standard"" wasn't experienced.  Wow!  I've never seen dirty used condoms in a booth before!  Is that the gold standard??  Cmon man. And maybe train your managers to be a bit more accommodating In These situations, although I pray you never have this happen again!!!  Instead of just running away!"
Danielle B.,"Vista, CA",116,6,,5.0,10/10/2016,Great food and great service from Marshall! Definitely one of our favorite places to go and have a relaxing dinner.
Jim A.,"Los Angeles, CA",524,803,7568,3.0,12/28/2013,Its a decent american style brew restaurant.  Not the best but it will do the job well especially if drinking is your thing. So many different brews! I had the pork chop dinner. my friends had 3 different pasta dinners. They are decent but nothing to write home about. Their pizza selection is pretty large! i need to try that out.
Jennifer W.,"Vista, CA",65,3,,5.0,10/10/2016,"Great food as always. We were previously not overly impressed by the level of service and attentiveness of the staff at this location, but they have really stepped it up on our last few visits. This evening, Teela was our server and she was wonderful! We love the food and brews - my favorite meal is the parmesean crusted chicken breast with Jeremiah Red and the chicken tortilla soup is to die for!"
Anna B.,"San Diego, CA",7,108,15,3.0,9/11/2015,"Eating outside. Just saw a server set down a pitcher of water and go to his car and chug a shot of alcohol....like those little bottles you can get from the gas station. Don't know his name. Just know his car is a silver/brown Kia Optima. Not going to list plate.  Anyways. We didn't get silverware or napkins. Had to use my arms and pants to wipe crumbs until we asked for napkins.  They don't serve like any sauce with the cheese sticks although the cheese sticks are the best I have ever had, sadly I had to finish the last 2 of my 5 with no sauce. I know I know. First world problems. Cream soda was not as good as I remembered. Pizza was good. Oh my god though...dat pizookie doh!!! Oh don't get me started. The peanut butter smores. Yes! Server was there for first part then kind of disappeared. She seemed very busy though. I know it can get hectic. We were the last table away from everyone else near the emergency exit. Don't think it's her fault. She was very nice though. :) my husband thinks she was just bad service but I liked her :)"
