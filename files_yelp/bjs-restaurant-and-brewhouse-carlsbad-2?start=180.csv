R F.,"San Diego, CA",14,89,30,3.0,12/2/2015,"The server was nice and attentive and the food was overall good. However, the appetizer and entrees came out at the exact same time, which was rather odd.  The 2 specialty margaritas we ordered were about $10 each, mostly ice, and if there was even a splash of alcohol in there, I'd be surprised.  I ordered the pom watermelon and it tasted like watermelon kool-aid mixed into simple syrup.  There was absolutely no trace of the bite of tequila at all.  So go for the food (the menu borders on ridiculously extensive), probably the beer, but skip the cocktails. The pretty backlit bottles on the shelves behind the bar are apparently just for looks."
James S.,"Oceanside, CA",360,26,1,1.0,9/6/2015,"My experience at BJs was subpar and not worth what I spent. I've given them a number of chances and really wanted to like them. Their food and beer is pretty good. But simply put, I'm tired of their s****y customer service and moody waiters/waitresses. I am going to make an effort to not come here again."
Patrick A.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,5,,5.0,4/4/2017,"I go here 3-4 times a month, always sit at the bar, always meet fun people. The beer that is brewed by BJ's is excellent, a typical night is 2/3 beers and dinner, always enjoy the food and beer, and the bartenders here are excellent, service at the bar is excellent and always very quick, I have had slightly slower service at a table when they are real busy, but nothing noticeably bad at all. I certainly recommend this BJ's!!!"
Kendall R.,"Murrieta, CA",0,8,,2.0,6/25/2016,"I called to follow up on an application i turned in a couple days ago and spoke to an employee then the manager. The employee was more than kind ( i wish i caught his name) so i give you props, sir. HOWEVER the manager was very rude. He told me that they look at the applications during the week, told me that lunch time was not a good time to call then hung up on me. GREAT customer service (so much sarcasm there)."
Mike T.,"Los Angeles, CA",468,366,4,4.0,12/28/2015,"I really appreciated the fact how the manager responded to my previous review. They obviously take customer service and complaints seriously at BJs which is important to me. I don't expect perfection 100% of the time so to know that this was a one time thing makes me plan on going back.  My Previous Review ""I normally rate BJ's higher. They have a great Happy Hour menu with half off all mini-pizzas including some fantastic unique flavors and I believe $2 off shared appetizers. However, the bartenders never seemed to want to take my food or eventual dessert order despite being nice people, they just rarely checked in with me when I needed them"""
Jennifer G.,"Vista, CA",0,51,1,1.0,8/16/2016,"Second time - won't be going back...service was less than OK, appetizers came(with no plates)before drinks...server asked if we wanted dessert while we were still in the middle of eating our meals which were not great, either. Unfortunately, all 6 of us did not feel so great later on. Sorry- it's a NO from me :("
Dee A.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,27,6,4.0,3/27/2016,"Didn't have to wait to long (about 10-15 mins)  My phone got a text once my table was ready for party of 3...The young man seating us named Alex was very friendly and went out of his way to find us a booth since we didn't want a regular table. Our server Kevin was quick, efficient and friendly!! He even offered his opinion to some choices on the menu. We had the root beer ribs which were so delicious the meat falls right off of the bone and the BBQ sauce is perfect. Followed by a flatbread pizza... We couldn't end our visit without an amazing Peanut Butter Pizokie!!!!! Thanks for taking care of us BJs we will be back"
Courtney H.,"Mesa, AZ",134,20,,3.0,9/24/2016,"My group of 3 decided to go on a Saturday night, we knew it was going to be a wait and it was.(30-40 minutes) when we were seated we had one waiter but after some time a women became our server with no introduction. We ordered fried artichokes and the great white deep dish and they were delicious!! I ordered a burger with a veggie patty. When our food was brought the server said ""turkey patty?"" And when I corrected her she said ""oh yes veggie!!"" Still had me worried and we realized that we still hadn't been given silverware. Service was slow and our food was cold when it got there. Wasn't terrible but probably will not be returning."
Kelli B.,"San Diego, CA",110,93,218,5.0,12/2/2015,"Came here for happy , ordered potato skins, mini deep dish pizza, and the famous pazookie! The potato skins were hot, thicker then most , and loaded with cheesy bacon goodness! It's a generous portion for an appetizer and filled me up more than excepted . The mini deep dish pizza's were 1/2 off for happy hour and were loaded with toppings. I had the chicken bacon ranch , which was delicious! The edges were crispy and the pizza itself was surprisingly not too heavy of an entree. The pazookie is always a winner, we opted for the cookies and cream option. This comes with a chocolate Oreo cookie, vanilla ice cream , and swirls of cookies and cream frosting YUM, literally every bite melted in my mouth. For an adult beverage I had the fruity cider and I really enjoyed it. It tasted like a spiked martinelles and I can't wait to return !"
Brittny K.,"Vista, San Diego, CA",1,31,17,1.0,8/24/2015,"By far the worst restaurant experience I have ever had!! I called and made a reservation for 8:30 last night, the lady said she would do a courtesy reservation for us this one time, which I appreciated. It was a little busy when we first got there, which meant waiting 15 minutes past our reservation time. Our server Dave was very personable and friendly. I told him that I had the mobile app, and we would be ordering on the app so we could get 20% off our check. We ordered our food right away, which was calamari for our appetizer a large shark pizza and a full rack of ribs with a side of clam chowder and a baked potato. After ordering we asked Dave to bring us some bread for our grandma.  15 minutes later, he came back and asked for my BJ rewards number because our order wasn't showing in their system. He leaves with my number and comes back and asks for my phone to scan the barcode, I give him my phone and remind him that we were still waiting on our bread. He comes back with my phone (no bread) and said it was too small to scan, so I gave him my sisters phone to use instead. This time, Scott, who is the general manager? comes with my sisters phone (again, no bread) and says there is an issue and my account number is showing invalid. (which I found puzzling considering I had received email confirmation for signing up, and email confirmation for the food order we had put in). He verbally took our order so we wouldn't have to wait any longer, and said he would get the issue fixed with my account, that way we would still receive our 20% off discount. Considering my step mom who is pregnant and my grandmother who is 82, waiting an hour to get something so simple resolved was annoying and a bit pathetic, so when our server finally came back, we gave him a hard time about still not receiving our bread, and jokingly (but seriously) said our food better be fresh since we had been waiting so long.  He finally comes back with 2 slices of bread and our calamari appetizer. I didn't try the bread, but the calamari wasn't crisp and fresh like I know calamari is supposed to be, however we were so hungry that we wolfed it down.  Finally he comes out with our pizza, ribs and baked potato and asked if he could grab anything else for us. We told him we were missing our clam chowder, so he apologized and went to go grab our soup. As he's in the back, my dad is looking at his ribs and notices something is missing. I'm serving the pizza to my family, and I notice that it's extremely soft. I take a bite of mine, and it's freaking raw and cold. The server comes out, and my dad asks him if he notices anything about his ribs, and the server said it looked burnt and was plated horribly. My dadagrees, but states there's still something else missing, and takes his knife and taps on the top of the rib and asks the server again if he notices what is missing, A little confused, my dad helps him out by pointing out that the meat on the bone is missing. LIterally, the $25 rack of ribs was all bone, no meat.  The server apologizes and goes to get his manager. (Mind you, the general manager never came back to give me status on my account). So LUIS the ""assistant manager"" comes out and rudely asks whats going on here. No, ""I'm sorry I heard there is an issue with your meal, how can I help solve the problem"". My dad explains to him the situation, points out the bones we received and the raw/cold pizza. The guy rudely starts making excuses for the restaurant and asked if we want another rack of ribs instead and another pizza. Frustrated, my dad told him that he was pissing him off because of the excuses he was making and the way he was talking to him. He interrupted my dad and told him not to cuss at him (sorry, I didn't catch the memo where pissed meant you were cussing at someone). My dad then asked for his title, and said he would prefer to speak to Scott, in which Luis offered to go get him. When my dad asked if he was still here, Luis said he had left already for the night (so he basically lied) My dad went on to say the chef should be fired and the guy again interrupted my dad calling him rude.  At this point, I am pissed at the way he's speaking to my father, so I tell Luis how extremely rude HE is being to my father, and how insincere he is over the sitatuation. I explained we had been there for over 90 minutes, and before I could get another word out, he starts interrupting me. I told him to not interrupt me, and what horrible customer service this was, and that we would not be coming back to their restaurant, and I will be in touch with the general manager in regards to his failed ""attempt"" to rectify the situation.  As we leave, my family is walking to the front, and the ""assistant manger"" cuts them off and walks infront without an ""excuse me"" or ""you go first"" or any sort of apology for the time wasted at the restaurant. To me, that was just past the point of disrespectful and blatantly rude."
Adnana M.,"Sacramento, CA",149,6,4,5.0,2/15/2017,"Joy! That was our AMAZING server on Valentine's Day! My boyfriend has the absolute worst luck when eating out, absolutely nothing goes right for him. And let me tell you he's a pain in the butt! So for him to walk away saying she's amazing she is! Not only was Joy VERY pregnant but she also never once missed our table with drinks (he goes through 8 drinks in like an hour!). Never once was his cup empty and she came by at the perfect times to ask if everything was going good. I've never seen someone so on top of it! And she was pregnant! I can't get over that! Most people don't work as hard on a regular day and this amazing human was about to pop. Joy; thank you so much for your amazing attitude and quickness!"
Ariana P.,"Carlsbad, CA",109,36,12,5.0,11/17/2015,"I come to BJs pretty regularly to know what is good and not good.  I don't normally sit in the dining room. Usually you can find be in the bar area.  The first time I went to a BJs was their location near La Jolla. That place always use to be packed! So when I saw this one open up, I was pretty excited! I absolutely love their pizookies and deep dish pizza. It's probably what their known for.  I am pretty guilty for coming here for their late night happy hour. I think there was one point in time that I was here every other night, but when your live near this area in Carlsbad, it's hard to find a place that's open late. Other things that are really good on their menu is All their BEER! I also really enjoy their hamburgers and their Jambalaya!  Definitely a must have or try! The staff here is always so friendly. Joy who works at the bar area treats you like friends and family. It's great! This place can get really busy too. So either come early or be prepared to wait."
Elsa M.,"Temecula, CA",0,3,1,5.0,8/15/2016,We stopped by for linner after going to Legoland. Our server Josh (the short one) was exceptional. Our food was delicious and he was extremely patient with our party of 5 which included 3 young kids. We hope to be back soon and stuff our face again.
Mari M.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,6,18,3.0,7/24/2014,"We arrived Tuesday night around 9pm, after being at Legoland, for a late dinner with the kids. Only had to wait a short amount of time to be seated. We asked for first available and was seated on the patio. Our waiter was busy so another waiter came by to take our drink and appetizer order. He returned with out drinks and checked back a few minutes later to ask if our waiter had come by to take our order. He hadn't, so this waiter took our order. A few minutes later our real waiter came by to check on us. We had already got our salad and drinks. I really liked that they worked as a team to get out order going so we didn't have to wait as long to order and to get our food.  We ordered the BBQ ranch chicken salad to start. It was good but I prefer the one at Cheesecake Factory better. This salad was mainly lettuce with small amounts of tomatoes, black beans, chicken, and topped with onion rings. The BBQ sauce was very sparse and the ranch was very light.  The salad wasn't very saucy in sections, kind of dry.  For our main dish we ordered the Deep Dish Sweet Pig.  It was delicious!  The dough was  very thick and crunchy. Great flavors. Tons of ham and pineapples.  Dessert we shared the Pizookie Trio. So sad that we could not get the Peanut butter s'mores with the trio, so we had to choose another flavor. We went with the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut, Triple Chocolate, and the Salted Caramel. The triple chocolate was by far my favorite.  I'm pretty sure they gave us a regular peanut butter instead of the salted caramel. It tasted peanut buttery and had no caramel.  The white chocolate macadamia nut is very sweet, especially compared to the Triple chocolate.  Overall, service was good except for our dessert mistake. I can't wait to come back and try the new s'mores pizookie.  I would have given them a 4 star except they made mistake on our dessert which was a bummer since we were excited to try the salted caramel."
Michael S.,"Los Gatos, CA",163,555,1234,3.0,8/11/2013,"I had never been a huge fan of BJ's - I'd just never had a great meal here. But I'd also never ordered their signature deep dish pizza. How could I judge a restaurant without ever having tried their featured dish, right?  Ok, so this time when a friend picked BJ's to meet for lunch, I ordered the mini pizza (my one topping was pepperoni) and salad lunch special.  Ok, so the pizza was great - buttery, rich, sinful, delicious. These guys aren't winning a James Beard award but the pizza was really good. But check it out - the house salad was weak weak weak. With this lunch special I could choose only the house, Caesar or wedge salads. I picked the house with ranch and received a lightly dressed medley with off the shelf iceberg lettuce, shredded carrot, croutons and tomato. Was fine but boring.  I'll go back. I did like the pizza, and the pricing on the lunch specials makes for great deals."
Levy-Karen V.,"Oceanside, CA",57,9,11,1.0,5/27/2016,"Updated review. For starters even if you call ahead to make a reservation for a party you still wait more than 45 mins . We called ahead a time and made a reservation for our party and arrived at 0830 on the dot and were seated at 0927, no service just sitting there waiting nothing else. So after the long wait tried to forget about the wait since it was for a celebration and I ordered the beer sampler, fried calamari and the chicken bacon ranch Pantai. The beer sampler was great had a good selection to choose from and honestly it was enough for the night for me so worth it. The calamari was decent but they forgot to add one of the dips and lemons. I only bring this up because someone else in our party also ordered it and got it perfect with everything I had to ask the waiter to get just the other dip. Once the chicken bacon ranch Pantai came I was excited to try it and was immediately defensive when I saw just the 2 pieces of it and no fries. Again someone else ordered it as well and got the order with their fries and when I asked the server if my fries were coming in a separate plate or something he lied saying they ran out and were making more, he delivered the other Pantai right after that statement. Poor poor service, the food is okay to say the least dried and with Ordinary flavor nothing special. The best thing is the beer which is great to enjoy with friends besides that I highly do not recommend this place. Not trying to rag on this place for petty things but honestly when everyone else but you get their orders with no issues and you repeatedly get yours screwed up it begins to dawn on you and honestly make it seem your not an important or valued costumer. Safely stating I will never return here because of this poor service, beware."
Veronika G.,"San Diego, CA",6,205,5,4.0,7/10/2016,"The food here is consistently pretty good...it's not a gourmet restaurant so I'm a little surprised at some of the negative food comments.  I've been here for brunch or lunch while shopping at the outlets and its always been a good experience. The waitstaff ate all very attentive and nice. The brunch pizza is super yummy!!  The only thing I don't care for is the hostess ""procedure"". After I ask the gal for a table she tells me to wait at the top of the stairs. Every time.  Some times there are others also just standing there waiting and it's a bit awkward. It's also a small area and waitstaff are trying  to pass. Maybe just say ""it will just be a few minutes"" and let me decide where I want to stand and wait."
M M.,"Pico Rivera, CA",0,48,28,5.0,1/2/2016,"This review will be in the service more than the food. Came in with a party of 12, six adults six kids. Our server was a young girl and she was very attentive and everyone got their fill. It was for a six-year-old's birthday on Saturday night at 8 o'clock and we were sat in 20 minutes. I'm sorry that I do not remember our waitresses name, but excellent service all around from everyone. I have been to different BJ's in different parts of California and this was one of the best ones to date. If I remember our servers name, I will edit the review and give her the credit she deserves. We all had pizza and always leave with leftovers and a full stomach."
kay S.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,14,,2.0,9/2/2016,"BJs is one of my favorite restaurant, but my family had a very disappointing experience here on Friday of Labor Day weekend. First we had to wait 55 minutes for a table when the initial estimate was 40-45 minutes. Then then table wasn't ready so they sent us back to the front to wait some more.  The food was equally disappointing. The calamari tasted off, the sirloin steak ordered medium rare was well done, the Capriese sandwich was really bad (we didn't eat it), the Octoberfest beer was boring and hoppy, and the Asian salad was bland. We sent the steak back and it took so long to bring the second steak that we had finished the other entries.  Despite the fact that we didn't eat one meal and the second steak took a very long time, we were charged full price. I feel most restaurant would have discounted the price. We won't be back."
Kayleena S.,"San Diego, CA",104,233,69,3.0,8/15/2015,"Recently had lunch here, great service and food portion is on point. Loved the flatbread pizza, the salad was huge. Always a great atmosphere and helpful staff. I come here for business meetings, family dinners, and date night depending on where you sit there is a different vibe. Always a staple, gotta love the desserts here, yum! Anything that you choose will be good guaranteed!"
