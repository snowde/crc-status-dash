Bridget J.,"San Diego, CA",11,49,52,2.0,4/23/2016,"Just paid for a watermelon basil margarita that I had to send back to be ""frozen"". Paid 9.95 wow. All I can say is that was highway robbery for being served a mediocre drink.  Second time around the bartender actually dressed it up with basil.  I've never sent back a drink ever.  I guess there's a first for everything.  My suggestion is lower your prices and get a real bartender"
Geno P.,"San Diego, CA",131,656,303,4.0,5/26/2014,"BJ's at first site is ... kinda hokey. It's a typical California cliché brewpub, complete with the garage doors and unimaginatively named menu items like ""pizookie."" You can put whatever description you want next to that dish. It won't bother me because I will never, ever, order something called a ""pizookie"" on account of the terrible name alone. I mean, man, it took some real convincing from the wife to even get me through the door of a place called BJ's in the first place. Sorry, but where I'm from, a BJ is somethin' else.  And I don't want to be around other people when they're enjoying a BJ. That said, our experience here was every bit of 4 stars. We did not wait for a table even during prime dinner hour on a Sunday. Also, the main giant TV was showing the NHL Playoffs. Huge win for BJ's on that front. Next, the corn fritter app, for a mere $3.25 (yes, you read that correctly, three frikkin dollars and one quarter) was spot on. I then ate one of the most OUTSTANDING meals I've had in this type of place for a LONG time. It's a stupid balsamic chicken with mashed potatoes, garlic strings, and a mess of salad leaves. I had zero expectations, but my god. I scraped the plate clean. And for only 880 calories! I'm still shocked over how BJ's did this.  It's not a gourmet dish. But sometimes a restaurant hits the nail so squarely on the head it wins me over. I'll be back to try more items next time we're in the vicinity. It's a huge menu, but I'm happy to get onboard."
Sarah M.,"Oceanside, CA",0,22,,4.0,1/4/2017,"We go to BJ's all the time! This is our favorite place to eat. The food is always good. My husband loves the BBQ brisket burger. The only thing is that sometimes the servers try to turn their tables over too fast, so you feel rushed when you're eating. I like to take my time and enjoy the food and the atmosphere. Once when we came here with friends, the server dropped the check off when we were still eating! There was a lot of people waiting for tables, but still. Other than that, I think it's a great place."
Wanda W.,"Los Angeles, CA",99,38,35,2.0,3/21/2015,I asked for brown sugar for my ice tea. I watched my server chat with his co workers go to the hostess and walk to the kitchen and then 15 min come back to tell us that he forgot. Every BJ restaurant I have ever been to the service has been sub par. Either server get your order wrong or forget about you until you have to correct them or chase them down. I never have a good experience here because the service is the worst which makes the food taste worst.
N T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,134,1,5.0,12/9/2016,Excellent service delicious food the drinks are delicious I will always come back here the only thing annoyimh is the wait and feb front desk is disorganized but the waiters excellent service makes up for it! Great bartenders too
W J.,"Cardiff, CA",0,12,,1.0,3/17/2016,"Worst service ever! It took the waiter 20 minutes to greet us, 9 minutes to bring us our drinks and then the service really got bad. The item I ordered ""No onions"" came smothered in onions. I had even asked the waiter to repeat it to me because he said, ""no Swiss"" so I explained that I'm allergic to onions. Then the manager offered to remove it from the bill since my friend was eating alone while I waited for the correct order. The bill came without it removed. I asked the waiter to please remove it and mentioned we were late getting back to work now. We watched him take drinks out to two other tables and start taking another order before I finally walked over and asked for our check and he pulls it out of his apron. Really?"
James W.,"Oceanside, CA",0,67,84,3.0,5/6/2016,"BJ's is a great place for lunch or dinner, lively atmosphere especially during the week when happy hour lasts till 7pm. Lots of sports on multiple TVs. Great house draft beers, burgers, pasta, & pizzas. Unfortunately tonight I ordered the fish & chips which was not one of their better prepared dishes. The overcooked, dry, dark crispy battered fish was not juicy succulent cod. The chips - thin crispy fries - were good but the fish was barely edible, below par fish sticks quality as dry as the fries. I'll stick to their excellent burgers or pizza next time. I ordered a steak for Fathers Day last year, and it too came overcooked and dry. The cooks (I won't called them chefs) must be too busy to keep a close eye on what's cooking since they seem to serve up mostly overdone fair. Two star food and the third star for atmosphere & beer."
Stephanie M.,"San Diego, CA",0,5,,2.0,12/27/2016,"It's been several years since I've been to a BJ's.....mostly because the service is sooooo SLOW!!!!!!! The experience yesterday was no different. It took 20 minutes  to get our drinks and 40 minutes for our food to come out. One of the meals was prepared wrong and took an extra 15-20 minutes to finally come out. Really? What gives? The people were super nice, but doesn't make up for the inexcusable amount of time to wait for a meal. Now I know why I waited years to go back there. Definitely won't make that mistake again!!!!"
Juan M.,"Baldwin Park, CA",29,24,143,4.0,3/28/2015,"My family and I were here visiting and they decided to eat BJ's for dinner.  I read some of the reviews, particularly regarding the service. I've been to many BJ's and I have to say the service at this location has been the best by far. The hostess was friendly. Our waiter, David, was on his ""A"" game. Although my niece's order was incorrect, he was very attentive from the beginning and constantly was coming around to check on us.  Their Santa Fe salad was delicious and raves of the avocado rolls were on point. And of course, my kids ended their dinner with a pizookie."
ZZZ N.,"Tustin, CA",9,10,10,1.0,3/11/2016,"Bj, why did you guys change the traditional wings? You had the perfect recipe!  Why change it?  It tastes like salty Hooters wings now.  And why is your pizza so salty now too? Are you so profit driven that you Drenched everything in salt so we would drink more beer?  I haven't been this sad and disappointed in a restaurant this much before.  I once eat praised and adore your restaurant chain more than any other chain but now I can't even finish a slice of pizza...the only thing that is still of quality is the Jeremiah red...I had so many fond memories here.  I'm still not grasping the drastic decline....just so damn dissapointed"
Ryan W.,"San Marcos, CA",63,109,57,4.0,4/15/2016,"Always good, always consistent.  Only been for lunch and I always get the Soup n Salad deal.  I think it's around $8 for unlimited of each.  Service can take a while sometimes, not the fault of the servers, just understaffed at times.  But all in all a regular lunch spot of ours.  Thumbs up."
Lindsey P.,"Carlsbad, CA",511,412,454,3.0,2/19/2012,"AIGHT. Nothing special going on here. Taking the craft of pub-ish style food and brewing beer and commercializing it. I haven't been unhappy with any of my visits here, but also haven't been impressed by anything in particular.  I'm glad they opened in Carlsbad, but would be cool if they had local beers on tap and local produce (ummm...the strawberry fields are literally seconds away!). That would really set them apart from all of the other touristy things to do. When I lived up in the NW there was a BJ's in Portland....it wasn't good either, so I tried really hard to forget about it after I moved away. C'mon BJ's - Tailor your locations to local faire and you will make your customers happier!"
Lana A.,"San Marcos, CA",1,24,4,1.0,4/22/2016,"I ordered the balsamic glazed chicken because I had it before and it was pretty good. I got it, the mashed potatoes and onion rings were good but I tried the chicken and it was rubbery and was chewy like if you bit into fat we told the waiter that just next time the chicken tasted a little weird and to fix it for others nicely and she just looked at it and said oh it looks over cooked or something I'll tell them and didn't really seem to care... It was expensive and wasn't good."
Claire S.,"Carlsbad, CA",6,10,10,1.0,3/7/2016,"I can't believe they got rid of the red velvet pizookie. A travesty. Honestly, nothing on the menu impresses me enough to come back here voluntarily. Its been friends and family members that always bring me here. The service is usually pretty slow, which isn't always a bad thing (great for hanging out) but don't come super hungry and expect to get your food right away. I do enjoy their ""mocktails"" and highly recommend them."
Pat S.,"Carlsbad, CA",20,1,,2.0,12/12/2016,"After a day of holiday shopping I went to BJ's in Carlsbad to relax. I've been there many times over the years and have never had a bad experience. I ordered the Margherita Fresca Flat Bread pizza. This is my go to appetizer and it's always been wonderful.  I don't know when they changed the recipe but i was so disappointed. It was not edible. Flatbread is crisp, this was soggy. The menu describes this dish with fresh mozzarella, sweet tomato sauce, fresh basil and Parmesan cheese. There wasn't any sweet tomato sauce nor fresh mozzarella - only fresh basil and Parmesan cheese on soggy bread. I doubt that I will return anytime soon."
Frankie C.,"Dana Point, CA",1,9,,4.0,2/28/2016,"I would have rated this place five stars if not for the AWFUL AND RUDE hostesses. When we came into the restaurant the hostess just looked at us and said wait over here waving her hand. No hello, no how are you etc which felt very dismissive. Furthermore, after dinner on our way out the manager whom was standing next to them said goodbye while the other hostesses simply just looked at us. Very unprofessional. However, four stars because our server Olivia T. was amazing! She even let me order something that was no longer on the menu. Very on top service and caring, refilling waters always and asking if we needed anything. Thanks Olivia T! Would recommend sitting in her section!"
Amy R.,"Kailua, HI",6,22,25,3.0,6/6/2016,"Good variety on the menu. The soup in a sourdough bread bowl was excellent. Very pleased with the taste and price of the menu items. We had 21 people in our party the first time, and 8 people the 2nd time. Both times the wait time for the food and drinks to come out was extra long, but I would come back again."
Matthew R.,"San Diego, CA",302,90,97,4.0,5/25/2015,We went outside to bypass the line. But they put us in the corner and felt like we were forgotten. But the food was nice and we got our food at a timely manner.
Jason L.,"Carlsbad, CA",1,15,6,5.0,7/27/2015,"My family and I love this place, clean welcoming. Amazing food, drinks and the desserts are to die for."
Gerry B.,"Westminster, CA",986,557,569,4.0,11/29/2015,"The restaurant is a typical BJ's and the food at this one was good as always.We stopped by for lunch yesterday and decided to split a pizza. We have eaten here several times and the calzones have always been good.The pizza on the othe other hand was not impressive.The deep dish has a very thick crust and has very little sauce making it very dry and bland.On top of that,there appears to be very little quality control going on in the kitchen.There was burnt cheese along the top edge of the crust making it visually unappealing.This can easily be remedied by the cook either by being a little more careful while making the pizza or by scraping it off with a spatula after it come out of the oven.The beers that are brewed in house are usually pretty good and go great with the food when it is prepared properly.The service here can also be inconsistent and slow,ruining what could be a pleasant lunch or dinner.Management really needs to get it together.They could do a lot better! We enjoyed the food but the meal was ruined by a couple of immature girls(they looked underage) in the booth next to ours who had a very small child that they let jump all over the booth and yelling and screaming."
