Judge D.,"Missoula, MT",0,96,,4.0,6/1/2016,I was surprised by the content offered at this restaurant. Highly recommend grabbing a pizza. Great flavors and drinks. The drinks can add up fast especially when their pricing is hidden. The staff was friendly but a little on the slow end.
Braxton J.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,14,,4.0,5/31/2016,"I frequent this location, the staff is usually super-friendly and the food is always prepared to my liking in a prompt manner. My only complaint is that I often go here with company to watch sports games. When the hostess' ask where we would like to sit, usually I ask to be seated in an area where we can see the game we would like to watch. Almost every time they sit us in an area where we cannot see the TV we would like to. Kind of frustrating because it is as if they just don't listen to our requests."
Bobbie G.,"Modesto, CA",214,96,16,3.0,12/14/2014,"Great food as usual !! But service was HORRIBLE!  Forgot to take the drink order for the little guy in our group ... Did not check on us and waited forever to drop our check. Also, waiter had a attitude when we asked about any drink specials for the evening . He replied ""it's Saturday, we wouldn't do specials today """
Richard M.,"Oceanside, San Diego, CA",4,66,6,4.0,5/7/2015,"Food is always decent here, I mostly go for the pizookies, the penutbutter smores is amazing :) I usually stick to the burger sandwich section of the menu. Beers are decent. I don't have much else to say.. Get a pizookie lol"
Scott T.,"Carlsbad, CA",100,642,2530,2.0,11/22/2013,"got dragged out on a rainy wednesday night for a MAGNOLIA ELEMENTARY fund raiser at BJ's RESTAURANT and BREWHOUSE (basically an upscale DENNY's with craft beer and a full bar). started with the AVOCADO EGG ROLLS (crispy fried wonton wraps with avocados, cream cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, red onions, cilantro, pine nuts, chipotle peppers and a sweet tamarind sauce). nice creamy texture from the warmed avocados but bland, bland, bland. really no flavor except plain avocado. we also got the AHI POKE (sashimi-grade tuna with green and yellow onions, avocado and crispy wonton chips) to share -- you know you just can't go far wrong with yellow fin even in a half-assed preparation like this. i settled on the BLACK and BLEU FLATBREAD (grilled marinated skirt steak, bleu cheese crumbles, mozzarella, caramelized onions, flame grilled portobello mushrooms, roasted red bell peppers and fresh thyme) -- well, that's what it says on the menu. check the photo. that was one nearly naked flatbread. you see any steak? any mozzarella? any caramelized onions? any flame grilled portobellos? how about some fresh thyme? don't bother straining your eyeballs -- zero. zilch. nada. the big goose egg. not sure why all those ingredients are on their menu 'cause they're sure as hell not on their flatbread. the wife ordered the CALIFORNIA CLUB FLATBREAD (grilled chicken, applewood smoked bacon, tomatoes and mozzarella cheese with roasted garlic aioli and diced avocado). not bad -- at least it had most of the listed toppings and enough that they show up in the photo. an under seasoned and very sweet ranch dressing instead of a garlic aioli but overall the flavors were not awful. JULIANA, the nine year old daughter, had the KID's KRAFT MAC & CHEESE. keep in mind that this is one of her lunch staples at home. so poorly made, she ate two bites and made it clear we didn't need to bother boxing the lefetovers to take with us. her side, the POTATO WEDGES, were worse than KFC's -- i didn't think that was possible. WYATT, the seven year old son, decided on BJ's boneless PREMIUM WINGS. the ""wings"" were chicken mcnuggets, pre-cooked, heat-em-up and eat-em-up and tossed in something that barely passed for BBQ sauce -- nasty. next fundraiser i think i'm gonna just write the school a check and spare myself the abuse."
Gabby B.,"Carlsbad, CA",61,5,,5.0,5/22/2016,Best experience I've had at a restaurant in a while! Me and my parents came here after a day in San Diego and had an amazing time because of our waitress. If you ever come here get Tila as your waitress such a happy and bubbly personality always checking in with us. Good experience.
Andrew S.,"Carlsbad, CA",1,3,,4.0,9/27/2015,"Good food, Jenna was nice,  they couldn't light the lamp hence the missing the star. Moon was eclipsed, jut like my heart"
Bria' H.,"Escondido, CA",270,4,1,2.0,10/31/2015,"Terrible service! Was seated for 10 minutes without meeting the waiter. Table next us was seated and instantly greeted by waiter. When the waiter finally greeted my party of three, he rushed us ordering and didn't let the person I was with finish ordering and just walked away. He constantly forgot the things we asked for, silverware, drinks, napkins. As we were finishing up eating our waiter was replaced, most likely due to previous waiter clocking out which explains rushed service. But our new waiter did not do much better.  Terrible food, but great beer selection!!"
Karl G.,"San Diego, CA",237,3,,1.0,10/5/2016,"Worst customer service ever what's the point of ordering online a setting a time of pick up and your food is not ready upon pick-up. I also called trying to make sure my order was all good and set I was place on hold for 15min and someone hang up the phone and never got to check up on my order. As soon a I parked my car someone called me saying they don't have the item I order anymore they took it off the menu just today. the employee who called me had an attitude over the phone when I told that the item it was online. ""SHE SAID OVER THE PHONE UNDER HER BREATH WHAT DID YOU WANT ME TO ABOUT IT ITS NOT MY FAULT"" think it's bunch of BS. I waited for another 25min for my order to come up that's very rude. The staff was very rude on the phone. I don't recommend ordering or coming her.e Apparently they don't have control of theirs menu in order for them to take the item that they don't have on there menu it's all COMMUNICATION it takes a second to do I'm sure if you all COMMUNICATE this won't happen... And also my food was under cook because they try to rush cook I ended up not eating half of it. It's a waste of my time all together. Not the only BJ's I've been to that this happened."
Ben B.,"Vista, CA",0,26,,5.0,4/3/2016,"No matter what I get from this restaurant it always ends up being amazing. The atmosphere is nice, and the food is just amazing. Don't forget about the beer, pretty refreshing as well."
Steven C.,"Carlsbad, CA",2,8,3,4.0,3/30/2016,Love coming to this place for lunch. Tried the Chicken Bacon Ranch Piadina this time and it was incredible! The piadina was crispy and the chicken was soft. The server was very prompt and constantly came by with refills.
Ali J.,"Carlsbad, CA",179,205,142,1.0,10/14/2015,"So I USED to love this place. I don't know what's happened but jeeeeez they have really fallen off the wagon. Hate giving out anything less than 3 stars, it's really gotta be a crap experience for me to not give at least three.  Went for lunch this Monday 10/12/15 around 12:45/1 pm with my parents. Was greeted by the hostess who was fine, got sat immediately- which is about THE ONLY perk of this lunch.  Our server was honestly, garbage. I used to serve; did it all through college. I say that only to serve the purpose that my harsh criticism does not come without weight and experience. He was hurried, rude, not knowledgeable of the menu, forgot things I had asked for and just generally seemed like he would've rather been anywhere else than at work. He didn't know anything about the beer selection, couldn't offer recommendations and rolled his eyes actually when my mom was ordering.  On top of the, ehm, ""stellar"" service, we got food that was beyond bland. Very unexciting. I don't know if it's because our amazing server decided to leave it under the warmer for 15 minutes or what but everything just tasted...stale. I got a half and half flat bread (California club and roasted vegetable goat cheese). The bread was lifeless. The ""goat cheese"" if you can call three tiny white balls literally the size of an eraser on my flatbread a goat cheese flatbread, then it totally lived up to its standards. It tasted like it had sat out for a week. My moms sandwich plate was loaded with shoe string fries that tasted old! Not salty, not warm, just gross. My dad was the only one who got anything worth while. The BJ's barbecue lunch platter which he enjoyed and it actually smelled like it had just been cooked so I'm sure that's why. Total meal cost around $35-40 without a tip which was way too much given the crappy service we got and the crummy food to boot. Won't be back unless I have to."
Anthony K.,"Oceanside, CA",3709,153,1151,3.0,7/19/2013,How do you rate a place only 3 stars when they sell something as monumental as a PIZOOKIE or a restaurant that has amazing beer selection!!?? Only giving this place 3 stars based on the whole dinning experience.  I live close by so I come here quite a bit.  Its known that this place has a wait and wait I will because the food and beer is great.  Usually once you actually get seated the service is topnotch and food comes out fairly quick. But last couple times its been progressively going downhill. Not sure if its because they hire less experienced servers for summer or what but I do know It shouldn't take 2 hrs for dinner for 4..  Try for yourself.. they do have a fairly large menu with a great selection of alcohol. Kids menu and great lunch specials. Also if you can find a seat at the bar service is usually faster!
Sam S.,"Dana Point, CA",64,57,52,3.0,1/1/2015,"This place wasn't bad. There was a line but with my eagle vision saw a spot in the bar area (which is huge). Once I claimed my area, the server came right away.  The service was very attentive. If I ever had a server ask me too many times if I was alright this was it. I can't complain though I would rather want that then no service at all. The environment is nice and dim like all the other BJs I have been to.  I have never had the brews bc they carry Lagunitas and Piranha on their menu. I got the pizza deep dish. I thought it tasted a lot like Pizza Hut pizza truthfully. My compadres had the vegan patty burger and clam chowder bread bowl. I don't eat vegan anything so I can't really judge. The only bread bowls and clam chowder I have had are at SF and Disney (and if you haven't had it here you haven't lived) so I wasn't impressed at all. The service like I said was very attentive. Didn't get anything wrong and was fairly quick with everything. For the service I shall give them an applaud.  All in all I wasn't disappointed. I haven't been to a BJs in awhile and we just happen to see it and I made an executive decision. Probably won't go back again unless it just happens spontaneously.  Happy eatings out there!"
Jennifer S.,"Carlsbad, CA",8,9,,1.0,1/27/2016,I love the food here but the service is horrible. We keep going back to see if the service is any better but it's not. My husband and I went there Saturday for lunch. I know it was busy but we had to ask twice for silverware. Then we didn't get any refills so we had to flag down a guy to get our waiter to get a refill. The food took FOREVER! Then tracking our waiter down for a check wasn't fun either. This had happened the last 4 times we have been there. We have finally decided to not visit this location again. Hopefully they are all not like this.
Marissa M.,"Oceanside, CA",96,6,2,5.0,4/9/2016,For the minute we sat down to the minute we got up the service was incredible ! Our server josh was wonderful ! Everything came out in such a timely manner ! Josh made sure everything we got came out perfect ! This is by far my favorite bjs to come too !!
Reid G.,"San Diego, CA",1,19,,2.0,11/14/2015,Been here a couple times and haven't been impressed at all. There is so many items on the menu it has to be impossible to perfect them.
Allan S.,"San Diego, CA",144,4,,5.0,2/4/2015,"Omg some of the best beers around are found here! my favorites include the piranha pale ale and the jeremiah red. All of their food is great, the pizza, pasta, and salads. and i absolutely love their menu because it recommends how to pair their drinks with their food. definitely a favorite place for my girlfriend and i to go catch some drinks and food."
Alejandra P.,"Gilroy, CA",7,16,,4.0,11/19/2015,Food was great first time having their deep dish vegetarian pizza and it was so delicious. Best pizza I've had by far
Carmela S.,"Ventura, CA",160,195,311,4.0,2/6/2015,"Was craving a good Chicago style deep dish so we cane here. The pizza is okay, it's a little dry and lukewarm. I gave this a rating of four stars because of our server, Frederick. What A neat guy! He has checked on us at least four times since we perceive our food and yet he was slammed with four other 6 tops within 5 mins! He has brought us everything on time and has made sure that extra requests were granted. He's super friendly, fun, and made our dining experience for a Friday night exceptional!"
