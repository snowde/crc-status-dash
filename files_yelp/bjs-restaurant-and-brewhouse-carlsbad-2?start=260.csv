Kathleen D.,"San Diego, CA",93,24,14,4.0,5/10/2015,"Going for a late lunch on  Sunday avoids crowds. I started with a pretty pink margarita. I can't recall the name but it's pink, top shelf and delicious!  The Ahi Poke is always good as a starter.  I had the Thai Mamgo salad. It was tasty with a sassy dressing but I felt like I was shorted chicken. When your dining partners have huge chicken club sandwiches filled with chicken and your salad has chicken about half the size of a hot dog, you feel slighted. Everyone else at the tabled loved their sandwiches and burgers."
Elaine D.,"San Diego, CA",0,7,,1.0,10/22/2016,"I ordered food at 9:50 to be picked up at 10:15. I took my lunch break and arrived at 10:15. i am pretty sure my food had not been started. I was assured my food was being ""finished up"", however, i declined to pay for my food before it was ready. I still had to drive back to work and ended up leaving at 10:30 with no lunch. I looked around to tell someone i could not wait any longer, but couldn't find any employees."
Josie S.,"Murrieta, CA",0,7,,1.0,10/21/2016,"I ordered salad to go for lunch. I was excited to eat it only to find out there is no utensils, no napkins. Is this something new I have to request when I order it?  How am I supposed to eat my salad? Come on BJ, a little common sense here."
Aimee A.,"San Diego, CA",360,192,343,3.0,11/28/2014,Sat at the bar and was served immediately.  Kevin was very attentive and helpful!   FOOD: - Carnitas deep dish:  Not enough meat and overly salty.   - Spinach artichoke dip:  Bland and nothing too exciting about it. It's always a hit or miss with any BJ's Restaurant that I go to so I rarely make it an option unless it is the ONLY option.
Mario V.,"Fontana, CA",0,16,,2.0,9/24/2016,"My fiancé and I started off with the appetizer sampler. The avocado eggrolls and spinach dip were good but the wings and mozzarella sticks were not that good. I've had the Cajun Jambalaya at other BJ's in the past, but this one was just bland. Very disappointing since it is my favorite dish there. Our server, Kevin, was okay. Overall, this visit was disappointing. Especially since we are big fans of the chain."
Rudi C.,"Carlsbad, CA",4,23,,3.0,9/24/2016,"I had a mini pizza and lemonade. The pizza was a bit soggy, and the lemonade was kind of sour. It was nice for a change to be here and it not be so noisy."
Martin M.,"Carlsbad, CA",1,41,8,2.0,10/1/2014,"BJs menu reads: Our delicious thin crust is lightly brushed with garlic butter and topped with the perfect combination of bold tomato sauce, our signature five cheese blend and your favorite gourmet ingredients, then baked to crispy perfection. So why did NONE of our pizzas have 'bold tomato sauce' on them?  None.  It was as dry as a pizza could be.  It was better suited to wipe up spills than to eat.  Did I mention that the pizza had NO sauce?  None.  Nice job BJs.  While you're at it, you might want to add Alfredo sauce to your Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo pasta.  I felt like we were dining in the Sahara (not tea) that night.  Epic fail. Why the extra star?  Their beers are good.  But not good enough to bring me back here."
Leslie L.,"Sandy, OR",0,1,,5.0,10/17/2016,Had a wonderful meal with great service (thanks to Robert)! All the staff was professional and courteous. We will be back soon!
Bill R.,"Carlsbad, San Diego, CA",105,31,,4.0,4/2/2015,"I usually opt to go to the smaller, non-corporate restaurants, but BJ's has never disappointed! I have dined at this location several times and the food and service has always been very good. Im writing this review after dining there with a group of 20 friends a few weeks back.  They were very accommodating for all of us crazy people trying to order lots of drinks and full dinners.   Our servers for the evening were named Austin and Chris.  Both were really friendly, fun and knew what beers to suggest to our tastes.   One of the members of our group was celebrating her birthday.  We actually brought a huge cake in; which they put in their kitchen fridge for when we were ready.  They also lit the candles and brought it out to us when we were ready to sing! SO, huge thank you to Austin and Chris for their amazing service throughout our night."
Erik G.,"San Diego, CA",877,500,1895,3.0,9/7/2014,"Decent to good name-sake Brewery offerings (I liked the Studio Session IPA) with tons of food options.  Big menu starting with their appetizers, pastas, burgers, their deep dish pizzas, and of course their famous Pizookie! It's a big location with a large high-ceiling dining room tending towards darker instead of brighter probably for sake of television clarity.  Full bar and bar-seating area up front.   Get the Pizookie.  To die for."
Kimberly C.,"Torrance, CA",310,395,2270,4.0,8/17/2013,"I'm always pretty happy with my visits to the BJ's Restaurant near my house and this time was no different, despite being a ways from home! It was relatively crowded when my boyfriend and I went (at like 7pm or so) but the quality of service did not suffer. Our waitress was quick to bring our food and drinks. The gourmet mac and cheese I ordered came out cold, but our waitress took care of it right away and brought out a fresh order of it less than five minutes later, which I was pleased with. She was very attentive and we never felt rushed to leave. Yet another good experience at BJ's Restaurant!"
Neil C.,"Fort Walton Beach, FL",124,22,19,5.0,4/25/2015,"Always a great choice. It has such a wide variety of food options that all taste great. They also have an awesome brew selection. Save room for the pazookie pie as well, they have mini sizes and large sizes that you can share with a big group."
Kerry B.,"Oceanside, CA",115,46,16,2.0,1/6/2015,Food is mediocre and the bathrooms were disgusting enough to never come back. I can find beer and pizza else where.
Rachel V.,"San Diego, CA",118,76,849,4.0,11/9/2014,"I hadn't been to this location before I usually go to the one in Chula Vista. This location is more spacious and has awesome customer service unlike their Chula Vista location. Our waiter was very attentive and got our order right and even double checked the order.  One of the things I love is that they have a great variety of quality beers on tap for your drink choices. For my dinner I ordered the Tuscan chicken limone on top of angel hair pasta with artichoke and sun dried tomato. The pasta had two filets of chicken breast on top and large artichoke pieces throughout. It had great flavor and the portion was perfect. I always like to share a plate of pasta so I can enjoy a piece of their pan pizza. For the pizza I had the BJs favorite which comes with everything sausage, mushrooms, olives, onion, bell pepper and tomato. The pizza was flaky and full of toppings and had great flavor as always. I also had the wedge salad which had just the right amount of dressing, Bleu cheese crumbles, bacon and tomato. Even my daughter loved the wedge salad and I usually struggle to try and get her to eat salad . Definitely a great place to come back to."
Mike M.,"Santa Ana, CA",1,72,,4.0,9/21/2015,"My family had a great lunch at BJ's Sunday. Food was good - shrimp tacos, calm chowder, and the chicken - spinach - quinoa combination. Not 5-star, but pretty darned good. Dustin, our server, was superb - exceptionally attentive and helpful. BJ's could use several more like him! 5 stars for service. Noise level was kind of high - likely due to the all the football games on the various screens throughout the restaurant. 3 stars for ambience, but just about everyone in there was having a lot of fun.  Overall, a good solid 4, bouyed by the excellent service we received."
Cathleen F.,"Lakewood, CA",259,235,82,4.0,7/22/2013,"Be sure to join the new rewards program, not sure how it works but you occur points. Ordered the personal pizza today along with the salad wedge ( my favorite! Also ordered a pazookie, which my niece devoured! Our waitress accidental ordered the wrong size, but adjusted our bill before we noticed!! Great service today as well.  Also really love the avocado rolls!"
Ryne O.,"Honolulu, HI",0,10,,1.0,10/8/2016,"On vacation and first time visiting here. Also my last. Food is comparable to Outback, TGIF, etc which is ok in my book. Service was awful. Our server thought it was just as important to talk to her co-workers by the POS terminal. When we asked for a soda refill, she went to the corner to talk first for a couple of minutes, then went to get the refill. Another guest at out table never got a refill and our server never bothered to ask. I wish I had paid for the bill so I could've left a $1 tip."
Le N.,"Reseda, CA",32,15,,1.0,3/14/2015,"I usually don't have anything bad to say about BJs Restaurant, but this time we received horrible service. Came here for dinner and we ordered drinks, appetizers, and entrees. Our drinks came out first... We waited and anticipated that the appetizers would come after shortly. It took at least 20-25 minutes for all the food to come out - appetizers and entrees. But before that, some waiter threw plates on the table and left. The waiter did not come by to tell us that the food was going to take a while and didn't ask us if we needed anything. The food came out and she did not apologize, but she just said, ""the food was supposed to come out at different times, but you know... Yeah"" and walked off. We then asked for ketchup, mustard and ranch. The waiter came back and practically threw it on the table and walked off.  Food and service was subpar ... I would have gotten more satisfying service at McDonalds down the street. How disappointing.  Stacey M, I hope you have a happier and better day tomorrow."
Chinky O.,"San Marcos, CA",151,26,3,5.0,4/8/2015,"Kevin! Our server, was awesome! Definitely made everything that much more awesome!!!!  The chefs kind of skimped out on our sauce by Kevin fixed everything and went the extra mile to make sure me and my girlfriend were taken care of."
Patti P.,"Carlsbad, CA",302,131,53,4.0,9/1/2014,"I am a fan of BJ's.  It's been one of our ""go to"" restaurants when you just want to grab a bite, and not go too far.  We went this evening and I tried a great new little salad called Twisted BLT.  It was fantastic!  They have a lot of choices on the menu which are ""small bites"" and this is one of them.  It is a spinach salad, with finely chopped bacon, egg, tomatoes- and the dressing is a spicy, yet light dressing which has siracha in it.  I LOVED the salad, and it was 220 calories.  It was the perfect size for a starter salad, with just enough kick to make it really good.  I then followed it up with one of my staples- the Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps.  Again, low calories, and a lot of taste.  They are under 350 calories, and I bring home at least 1 of them for lunch the next day.   We've found BJ's good for a group- as there is always something for everyone.  I love their deep dish pizza's there, although I don't indulge too often. And the Pizzoki (probably not spelling it right) are fantastic.  They are basically a cookie, freshly baked in it's own little pan, with ice cream on top.  You can get one large one, or a sampler of 3 different ones.  (What most people don't know is you can also request just 1 of the small ones, which is usually enough to give you a taste of dessert, but not too much!) For those who are beer drinkers, there are a huge assortment of beers available, and their bar there is really attractive, with the bottles arranged beautifully and backlit. All in all, I think BJ's does a good job for a ""chain"" restaurant, and enjoy the smaller and low cal dishes offered there. I can stay on my diet when I go there, and not feel that I am sacrificing."
