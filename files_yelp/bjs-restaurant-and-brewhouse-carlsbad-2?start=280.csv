Joseph M.,"Orange, CA",23,8,3,5.0,10/11/2014,"Fredrick is the man!!!!!!!! By far one of the best servers I have ever had, if you come in and you sit in his section... You'll be well taken care of. He knows all his coworkers names and compliments them as often as they cross paths.  Every Restaurant should have a Fredrick. On top of serving in his section, he is running food in other sections, talking to guests waiting to be seated, filling ice, high-5ing my kids.... He does it all! What a great experience! Thanks Fredrick!"
Mark M.,"San Diego, CA",0,3,,5.0,4/1/2016,"I placed an order through the website the night before. It was a large order, 14 items and it had to be perfect. The ordering site was easy to use and very thorough. I was concerned because often times, something could be left off an order, with an order of this size. the next day, at 11 AM, I picked up the order. Within 10 minutes, the order was checked, bagged, paid for and in my truck. They made sure it went out perfect, every dish was labeled and correct. It was a piece of cake and my department enjoyed the lunch very much. Thank you, we will be back."
Dolores O.,"Oceanside, CA",96,27,55,5.0,2/20/2015,Great experience. Arrived during dinner time and was executing a long wait but it actually only lasted 15 minutes. Our server was excellent and very attentive. We had a great experience and the food was delicious. Really liked the berry cider.
Jennifer M.,"Oceanside, CA",0,8,1,5.0,9/27/2014,"Just ate here for dinner. Our server (receipt says his name is Ryan) was wonderful. Our drinks/appetizers/entrees were perfectly spaced out, and he was very professional. We got the blt salad and stuffed mushrooms for appetizers, and the sirloin steak with asparagus and the glazed pork with red potatoes and green beans for entrees. Both were wonderful! P.s. Sit on the patio for a calmer atmosphere... Inside was packed!"
Sarah B.,"Vista, CA",4,52,3,4.0,10/14/2015,"I could eat my weight in Pizookie, seriously. Although I've never been blown away by the food quality, it's never been bad and the service has always been attentive and courteous, even when we came with large (and obnoxious) groups. I really like their 2 for $25 deal, One pizza, two salad or soup apps and one pizookie, because it's a great value. My only complaint would be that the food quality doesn't always match the price paid, but we still go every couple of months. We will continue to patronize this restaurant when we can!"
Ron A.,"Whittier, CA",105,711,214,4.0,10/20/2011,I have been at this location a few times. One time was for a party. It was packed as expected. The service at the time was good. The food also met my expectations. There are plenty of televisions to watch sports. The second time was for brunch. I never knew they served brunch food. I had the breakfast pizza. It was good! Ended the meal with a white chocolate poozkie.
Dee M.,"Vista, CA",670,814,2965,3.0,1/28/2011,"Thought I would update me review of BJ's since the service we received from SHAHAR was so phenomenal. The food was just okay, I definitely won't be ordering the Parmesan crusted chicken and cheesy mashed potatoes again, both were VERY bland. I never use salt, but when I do you know it must be pretty tasteless. That's been my overall experience with the food at BJ's, but I love going back for the cool vibe and atmosphere of course the PAZOOKIE!  5 stars for Shahar our server. You MUST request him.  4 stars for the cool vibe  3 stars for the so so food"
Jordyn S.,"Marysville, WA",14,47,16,2.0,9/27/2014,My first time at BJ's and honestly wasn't impressed. We had a group of 6 for a friends birthday and to start off the ladies at the front were in a bad mood. Granted they were crazy busy but still not an excuse to be snippy to customers. We were seated fairly fast for how busy it was. Our waiter was really nice but I'm pretty sure he's new. He messed up on almost everything we ordered. Our beer pitchers that we ordered got mixed up and the food that came to our table wasn't even mine. But I ate it anyways not realizing.  My food was good but everyone else said their food was eh. The ribs were subpar and not worth $22 and the steak was dry.  On top of that we kept getting food delivered to our table that we didn't order. I understand it happening one or two times but it happened 5+ times. No idea they could have that big of a mix up but they did.  Overall the food is eh. Not worth the price! At. All. The service staff was nice but I recommend training your staff a bit more so simple mistakes don't happen over and over. Our servicer was incredibly nice but I don't think he was fully ready to branch out and manage his own tables by himself just yet.  The beers are great and so are the drinks! Thumbs up for that I guess.
Amy P.,"San Diego, CA",50,86,229,3.0,8/29/2015,"Good food, great service. Eh beer. I like mixing the beer to make a good one. This one is the better of the 3 I've been too. Very clean, good parking, easy access. Go during happy hour."
Adrian C.,"San Diego, CA",11,3,,5.0,1/30/2016,I just dined at this BJ and the customer experience has been fantastic. The food is always good but this day was marked by a great advice from the time we walked though the door until we left. Great job.
Jeremy M.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,12,,5.0,8/18/2016,Great beer and food selection as well as awesome quality and service!  I came here last night for the first time for dinner and am back for lunch today.  Had the Ribs last night and they were the best I ever had.  Had a Brisket and bacon sandwich today and it was delicious!   Excellent craft beers as well.  I will definitely be back for another great beer and meal
Daniel T.,"San Marcos, CA",0,10,1,2.0,8/14/2016,"I want to like this place so bad, but it's hard when it takes 20 minutes for a soup to come out and not even have that soup be hot. Disappointing :/"
Farrah B.,"San Diego, CA",132,46,11,2.0,11/19/2014,"I have been going to this location for a year now. I have had only one positive experience without them screwing up something. Last night was the last straw. I ordered curbside to go.. And ordered online. After I realized I punched in the wrong date to order, I called. An employee picked up the phone and said they'll cancel in and order when I'm ready and hung up. besides the fact that the person hung up, I ordered again. Now with the right date. I drove to the restaurant, a man comes out. Sounds like the same guy on the phone- and asks for the name.. Goes back in and pulls out receipts- and says that they have nothing made for me since the orders ""merged"" He sounds like the same guy on the phone.. He seemed really apologetic, and informed us he's the manager. He asked us to wait 10-15 minutes. Which we agreed to since we already drove there and were hungry. Needless to say I was very forgiving,  and polite. He threw a burnt pazookie In for free. I was thankful for that since I ordered one and it was free. I didn't know the pazookie was burned and charred. I didn't know that the burger we ordered is the wrong one and screwed up the side on it too, how can you get it wrong when you have two identical order at your hands?  Besides the burnt cookie and a plain cheeseburger- I've just had it.  I feel like the waiters and waitresses at this place is super awkward and inexperienced. The manager can't even get things right either. I just don't think it's worth the time or money to dine here. Time after time it's the same thing the order isn't right.  Maybe work on reiterating your orders to your staff and customers before you make anything in the back. I have been working in the food industry for years and having that said- I am forgiving. But this is just ridiculous and could be avoided if you guys could make few corrections with communicating."
Alicia R.,"Vista, CA",282,117,168,4.0,10/20/2014,"Very good manager service, handled my small steak malfunction very smoothly and even picked up the check! I basically ordered a rib-eye steak rare-medium, but it was cooked well-done. Not only did they prepare a new one for me, but it was also a very well marbled cut, which was even better then the first one. The manager was very attentive and professional. Thank you"
Liz D.,"San Diego, CA",282,40,11,5.0,11/8/2014,"Our waiter was phenomenal! I didn't catch his name, but he was the large bald man with glasses. He had such a warming, welcoming attitude. And our food and drinks got to us in no time. Best service we've had in a LONG TIME.  The food was good as usual! If I could request that guy as our waiter, I'd come more often!"
Hank R.,"Apple Valley, CA",0,4,,5.0,8/1/2016,"Hard to find on Yelp. We stumbled onto B Js while going to another restaurant. Worth the effort. Good food, good brews. Try the homemade root beer."
Vicki E.,"Brawley, CA",82,201,62,4.0,11/22/2015,A bit loud on a Sunday afternoon due to all the football games blasting. Came in for a late lunch and it was packed. Chicken potstickers and the BLT salad was perfect. My daughter had the BJ's Classic combo pizza and said it was good also. We shared the pizzookie sampler. Glad we saved room for dessert.
MICHELLE C.,"Cathedral City, CA",0,158,37,5.0,11/17/2014,"We came here with some family and really enjoyed our time there! We originally called ahead for a party of 14 but ended up being a party of 6 and they were very accommodating!  We ordered the avocado rolls for appetizer which are super delicious :) Great service...Brooklynn was our waitress and loved her enthusiasm and name!!! We ordered a few salads, a burger, soup, and a French dip and everything was really good and prepared as ordered! Would definitely return and would recommend it!!!"
Kayla R.,"Norman, OK",191,124,13,5.0,9/7/2014,"If I'm not across the street working, you can most likely find me here!  They have late night happy hour that has a wide selection. Food is always consistent and servers are always friendly."
Terrance B.,"Vista, CA",42,95,,2.0,10/25/2015,"Lunch specials not so special. Overpriced and small portions. French dip maybe 3ounces of overcooked and dry. Worst fries, cold and obveously had been sitting for a while. Hamburger cooked beyond recognition and $12 bucks? Geeze go to In and Out WAY better. Nice waitress, but that's about it."
