Lisa F.,"Oceanside, CA",37,11,1,5.0,12/28/2014,"ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE! every time we come in here is a great experience! everything from the food, to the drinks, to the staff...  the pasta, pizza and desserts are amazing. I highly recommend the Parmesan Crusted Chicken entree, To Die For. Definitely one of my favorites.  I really like that they make their own custom brews. I recommend the Harvest Hef. it's delicious.  but the best part about this place is their staff. so friendly. anxious to serve.  definitely one of our favorite places to eat. come to happy hour. or just unwind."
Salil K.,"Carlsbad, CA",2,47,12,1.0,12/25/2015,I came here for the second time on Christmas eve with five people including myself.  We chose BJ's because we all wanted to watch a football game and this was one of the few places that was open around me.  I was surprised to see how crowded it was for Christmas eve.  The service was awfully slow.  I took over 5 minutes just to get the first round of drinks and over 10 minutes for the second one.  The waiter mentioned he was new however this should not be the sole cause of the slow service.  We saw our drinks sitting at the bar for over 10 minutes and our guy had not come to pick them up.  We refused to take them and requested a re pour.  The waiter was not attentive maybe he had a bunch of tables to serve that day.  It was a challenge just to flag him down to make an order.   My friend waited over 15 minutes to get a drink only to have to asked the waiter where it was and be told that they didn't have it anymore.   The food I ordered was Mediterranean chicken tacos.  Taste and everything was fine nothing out of the ordinary.  Ticket time was over 15 minutes again.  Just awful and slow service the whole night. This is not the first time I have had bad service at this restaurant and I will not be returning anytime soon.
Prncs D.,"Carlsbad, CA",35,40,,2.0,5/10/2014,"BJ,BJ,BJ!   What's happened??? Sooooo disappointing!  When BJ's first opened up In C'bad it was great! We were all tired of Claim Jumpers raising prices while shorting on amount of food. But now, BJ's has joined that club  :( We hadn't been out to eat or to a Happy Hour for awhile & decided it was time. First of all, the happy hour sliders are a TOTAL JOKE!  NOT KIDDING!!  Imagine a portion of ground beef perhaps the size of a meatball before flattened & cooked....maybe a TABLESPOON??? the patty could not have been bigger.....wish I took a pic for proof... Met friends there...total 6 of us...we were busy catching up & one person wasn't sure what she wanted/server put our orders in & promised to check in a few.... we got to talking and everyone's food was served...except the one who hadn't ordered yet of course. So she ordered her chicken wings and all 5 of us were done with food & drink/no wings for friend...waved waitress down.  When asked about her order waitress looked at us like we were stupid and replied in a condescending tone as if we were in kindergarten ""It's coming"".....I whipped out my phone 7 minutes later out came the wings... YIKES! Boneless Wings???????Okaaaaaaaaay! I think there were a total of 5 maybe 6 and they were like McDonald Nuggets! Sorry to say but if you want a SCREAMING DEAL? Karl Strauss Happy Hour Boneelss wings are more than I can eat Piled High!! NOT NUGGETS, delicious and hold your horses $5! Sorry BJ's.....you've lost our business... Next time we decide to splurge, Karl Strauss it is...I'm so disgusted with restaurants charging big bucks for mediocre food in tiny portions"
Vanessa T.,"Victorville, CA",94,94,42,5.0,6/6/2015,I was contacted and the manager gave me a gift certificate to return and when I went back everything was amazing. So that was just a flook of a night I had on my previous visit
Mike A.,"Midvale, UT",21,6,1,2.0,7/26/2014,"Thought the food was good.  The deep dish pizza reminded me of a high quality Pizza Hut.  Beer was good and restaurant atmosphere was pleasant.    The service was where they fell short.   The server was chippy, short and unfriendly.  When we sat down he threw the coasters at each of us,like we were a group of frat boys ( I was there with my mother, 2 young children and wife) I asked about happy hour specials.  He firmly replied ""happy hour is at the bar"".   Reluctantly offered us drinks.  Not surprisingly we got a new server after he put our drinks in.   I'd recommend the rock bottom in la jolla."
Izzy C.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,7,,5.0,8/8/2016,Ordered a curbside pickup order for a family of 4 while visiting the area to take it back to hotel. We got back to hotel and realized they forgot our salad and didn't add extra broccoli to our entree as we requested. Called back and the manager on duty was very nice and apologetic. He took care of most of our entire order and asked if there was anything else he could do. It was a great take out meal and he handled and took care of our issue very appropriately. We would definitely be back.
Jenna Y.,"Long Beach, CA",23,23,160,4.0,9/26/2015,Large selection. Great service. Only complaint would be the stale chips to my appetizer
Caroleann B.,"Oceanside, CA",457,576,3900,5.0,2/6/2013,"Excellent, excellent service tonight! Beginning with my phone call to reserve a table for 11. Pleasant phone service with the hospitality guy in charge. Liz and Kevin (Kevin with tall styled hair), you guys rock also.  Thank you for an all around pleasant  visit today. Please keep up the awesome job!"
Nancy L.,"Carlsbad, CA",283,400,663,4.0,2/5/2011,"Maybe I was grouchy because I contemplated knocking BJ's down a star for the dirty menu and my Berry Burst cider being $5.75 even though it was 5pm.  Yeah, I was definitely in a thinking mood - for once I stopped eating half way into my California Chicken sandwich (calories posted on the menu really help the undecided) so I could finally order this famous Pizookie. WOW!  Surprisingly rich flavors - butter, milk chocolate, a caramelization effect on the white chocolate part, and good quality ice cream raised this dessert up a notch from just a sweet thing at the end of a meal.  I was digging out the final bits stuck in the pan crevices!  This might be a more motivating ""let's go there for dessert"" item than creme brulee! So the Pizookie and consistently good food and service keep BJ's at a solid 4 stars despite its inconsistency with it's BB cider pricing!"
christopher g.,"San Diego, CA",156,23,3,5.0,10/29/2015,"Honestly, this location is the best I have ever been to. I love the service, the food and the bartender Johnny is the man. The brisket burger is out of this world and you can finish off your meal with a pizookie. A pizza pie cookie item. Must go!"
Mateo M.,"Kihei, HI",390,230,195,4.0,4/19/2014,"3.75 stars I dropped in here briefly for a beer with friends. I ordered some sliders before they told me that they found the food repulsive. Oh well. What arrived were some very tasty Kobe sliders and crispy shoestring fries. I was quite impressed with the taste - especially for $6. We ordered some beer, which too was very good and called it a day. The staff was friendly enough, but this is definitely not a ""prime"" location and I wouldn't be found here late on the weekend. That said, BJ's hit the spot this afternoon."
Jordyn P.,"Oceanside, CA",3,26,42,3.0,10/1/2015,"I have eaten here a few times and at first I really enjoyed it, but after a few bad experiences I will not give it the number of stars I once would have. I will just write about my most recent visit when my boyfriend and I ate her for dinner one night. Our waitress completely neglected us, and never checked on us. We would see her walking towards us, and it was if she would avoid us. Don't get me wrong, the food is great, not really worth what they charge, but we always leave full and satisfied. It's just really disappointing when you have great food but crappy service. It's a shame that I'm such a big tipper because if our waitress would have treated us like we were actually there, I would have tipped her like crazy! I will not be returning to this BJs, but I definitely will try out another location in hopes to find better service."
Jennifer D.,"Carlsbad, CA",93,172,69,2.0,6/23/2012,"I have been to this location a few times before but nothing stellar enough to yelp about. Our visit last night will probably be our last as it resulted in me complaining to the manager and I NEVER do that. We were seated promptly on the patio outside, it wasn't too crowded yet as it was only 5:30.  Our waiter came (I will keep his name private as to not embarrass him, but it rhymed with ""Lyle"" and started with a ""K"") and took our drink order, all nonalcoholic but one and all arriving 20 minutes later. As he took our order, he would repeat back the items we ordered and they were not correct. For example, I asked for potato skins, and he would say ""OK, and an order for fried artichokes?"". NO LYLE, that's not what I said. The potato skins were way over cooked. The calamari was OK.  The best was when our table was littered with dirty dishes and empty glasses because he hadn't come by to clear them or offer us a refill, and another server comes whipping out of the patio door with a pizza and says ""Um, can you move your stuff out of the way, this pizza is hot and heavy and I'm about to drop it.""  You know what, no, I can't.  How about you bring that pizza stand thingy and some plates before you come out here full speed with a pizza and threaten me. Lyle comes by now to check how everything is. Well, my husband hadn't been brought his dinner. Any restaurant knows you serve the entire table at the same time. This is when I call a manager over. He apologizes and offers to comp husbands dinner. When the check comes, no comp. So of course, that's another 5 minute wait and then another 10 minutes for him to run my credit card and then bring me the slip to sign...with no pen. Find a new job, Lyle. For a chain restaurant in a busy location (across from the company stores outlet), they need to make a better effort to hire competent waiters who can handle the vast menu and heavy flow of people. They line to get in was bananas when we left. Sorry to whomever got table 21 on the patio."
J F.,"Carlsbad, CA",43,70,8,4.0,7/29/2015,So we tried the bison burger and the Mediterranean pita tacos and what the hell!!!!! The coleslaw was amazing! I never in my life wanted more coleslaw and there isn't a bit left for a photo.  You red to try the bison burger and have the slaw. It has cilantro and something awesome that we couldn't detect.  I would make this for lunch. Super light and refreshing coleslaw?????????????? How did this happen? They need to get on the NON GMO RHYTHM ASAP but everything else is getting better Come on BJs Get with the non GMO and enter the future!
Kylene K.,"Port Hueneme, CA",0,36,4,2.0,11/14/2015,"Update: Emailed the person who responded to me, but they have YET to contact me back.  So not sure if that comment was all for show as an attempt to show they care, but I was never contacted further by any BJ personnel.  My original review stands."
Sam S.,"San Diego, CA",3,14,4,2.0,11/7/2015,"Horrible Service. The last few times we went there in the past year, the wait time for food or even appetizer was ridiculously long. 20+ min for just appetizer to come out, 35 min another time for food to arrive and I had to remind them incase we were forgotten, asked for ketchup and hot sauce another time and it never made it to our table until our check arrived."
Adriana M.,"San Marcos, CA",61,74,43,2.0,4/7/2014,"We love BJ's but not this location!!!!!! My server gave me an additude because my daughter changed her mind from milk to apple juice. My iced tea had one ice cube and wasn't offered a refill, then my sliders came plain without cheese or even ketchup. He offered to bring out some sliced cheese but i would've rather it be melted   My rewards card wasn't coming up and they didn't seem to know why...... just overall bad service"
Michelle C.,"San Marcos, CA",5,32,1,5.0,10/8/2015,BJs is always delicious and fast. Happy hour from 3-7 weekdays and 10-close on weekends (reading off card).   Delicious menu in general but happy hour menu is great too! Never a bad choice.
Steven B.,"San Diego, CA",295,1,,5.0,12/8/2015,"I frequently visit BJ's restaurant, and It rarely ever disappoints. This Carlsbad location has by far become my families favorite to dine at. My family was in on a busy Sunday night celebrating my father's birthday. Our server, Josh, was an absolute pleasure as he went above and beyond to make this a special occasion! I'll definitely be coming back and requesting Josh's service. I had the buffalo chicken pizza and it was fantastic, and my dad loved the root beer ribs! Never had empty waters, always a full beer on the table, thanks for making everything so special, Josh!!"
Jonathan V.,"Carlsbad, CA",211,67,133,3.0,3/28/2014,"The food is usually good but the service isn't always on point. I've only come to this location during their 10pm to close happy hour, so my review is based on the service at the bar section during this time. POSITIVE: I always order their mini deep dish pizza and they always come out nice and hot- Gourmet Five Meat & BJ's Favorite- THUMBS UP. The servers are usually happy so it helps with the ""happy"" hour. But here is my concern: Along with the beer and main course, I order the spinach and artichoke dip. There have been times where the dip could have been prepped better (luke warm temp), the ""appetizer"" came out at the same time with the pizzas, or the server completely forgets about the dip. This is not excusable. I know that this is a small dish but it really does affect the experience at the restaurant."
