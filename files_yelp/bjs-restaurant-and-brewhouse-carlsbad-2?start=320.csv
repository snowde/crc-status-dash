Maria C.,"San Diego, CA",1774,2890,8958,2.0,5/11/2010,"Came here for a going away party. We were a party of about 15 people, and we were there until about 1am.  It was truly good times with good friends. Although the waiter was nice, courteous and tried to accommodate as best as he could, the wait time for food was terrible. Apparently, they were short staffed. Our waiter mentioned that even the managers were cooking.  Christopher C. and I ordered a Hef and mozz cheese sticks. Nothing special about the cheese sticks. Total about $15. A friend of mine didn't get her order until after everyone's orders were delivered. Luckily for them, she was understanding.  I'm not sure if the floors were just waxed, but the floors were REALLY slippery. I have a prego girlfriend and was very concerned every time she had to use the ladies room. Actually I noticed about a handful of prego peeps, and if anyone were to slip, BJs would be in big trouble. My prego g/f mentioned that they witnessed one of the employees slip and fall. That is a lawsuit waiting to happen."
Barry M.,"Oceanside, CA",10,75,93,1.0,8/12/2012,"Used to go here frequently. Will never go back again. Ordered a Turkey Club Sandwich. Tomatoes were green inside and the bread was dried out. My Wife's Burger was burnt same type of tomatoes with dry bread. Instead of frys I ordered a green salad. Same type of BAD tomatoes. I can't believe they actually served this hoax to us. Sure they reimbursed us, but our meal time was ruined.  Beware everyone. Any Restaurant that has that type of quality control can't be well managed."
Ignacio F.,"Upland, CA",39,2,,2.0,1/3/2016,Two stars is all I give this place worst service and that's in any county seems to me that they just don't care about the costumer they take there time just to take your order and that's just for drinks f this place I will never come to another bjs
Angelica T.,"Encinitas, CA",481,79,15,1.0,8/4/2015,Should have people that know more about policies to answer the phone so people don't end up driving all the way over here to get turned away.
Ed S.,"Whittier, CA",2,5,55,2.0,10/5/2015,"Well here in carlsbad for work for a few days and its not often we get a chance to go sit down and eat.

Jason G.,"San Diego, CA",170,450,33,3.0,3/26/2014,"Part of being married seems to be getting dragged off to do things like shop at an outlet during March Madness.  (Single people, you've been warned.)  So, you can imagine the feeling of overwhelming joy that came over me when I spied BJ's Brewhouse while standing outside the Coach Factory Store.  I'm not normally a religious man, but this was truly a miraculous event.  Huge TV with the SDSU game on, cold beer on tap, life is good.  BJ's is a port in the storm.  But as the saying goes, any port will do really.  The beer here is good for many cities in the US and around the world, but by San Diego standards it's really sub-par.  The Hopstorm IPA was about as hoppy as a 3-legged rabbit, but boy was it cold.  And, oh look, SDSU is winning!  So the day was a big success, but BJ's is a place I may go every now and then but nothing I'll brag to my friends about doing."
Zhana B.,"San Marcos, CA",45,25,,2.0,9/30/2015,Great food but service has been a bit slow the last couple times of going here. I do not get off work until 10:30 pm and go to Bjs with my boyfriend being that they do not close till late. We waited one time 45 minutes for soup and a root beer float! A different time our waitress was so bad and never really check in on us/ did not even give us our food that my boyfriend had to flag down a different server who gladly take care of us even though he was waiting on a couple other tables.
T S.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,27,11,3.0,8/8/2015,"Exactly what you'd expect from a chain. Only gripe, my daughter was celebrating her 5th birthday and we to the hostess and waiter. Neither acknowledged it, not even when we bought dessert."
Paulino M.,"San Diego, CA",54,21,42,4.0,3/17/2014,"This is my go to spot when i need to grab dinner or weekend brunch. Food awesome, Beer awesome, service awesome! great place to hang out highly recommend it if you haven't checked it out. Parmesan crusted chicken, pizza, and flat breads are some of my favorites on the menu."
An L.,"Oceanside, CA",6,108,104,3.0,2/27/2014,"Always a good restaurant to eat at. Nothing special, but clean, up to date and good service. Good for the kids. Came here after a recent trip to Legoland. I got the fish tacos. Tasty. Decent selection of their own brewed beers as well as the popular favorites. Deep dish pizzas, salads, sandwiches, pastas, steaks, baby back ribs and a lot more. Pretty good sized menu. Almost too much. I'm not a big deserts guy but the Pizookie is pretty good. Basically a scoop of ice cream on a hot cookie.  With plenty of TV's it's a good spot for a large group to watch the game and throw back a few."
Jenna S.,"Beaumont, CA",37,21,1,5.0,9/6/2015,"It's always a pleasure eating at BJs in Carlsbad. The service is excellent and the food is always delicious! It's too bad that the only people posting reviews are the minuscule minority that happen to catch a server or cook on a bad night. I looked around the restaurant and saw nothing but smiling faces, families friends, and couples enjoying each other in a warm inviting atmosphere. Great place for a casual delicious meal!!!"
Devin R.,"Buena Park, CA",0,4,,5.0,4/19/2015,"So I drive an hour south to hopefully watch a baseball game, I asked the bartender if they had the game, she said she'd ask the mgr, but he was in a conference call. So instantly, I thought, nobody has confrence calls on a Sunday!!! But, a couple minutes later the GM Scott came out with the actual tv lineup??? Wth??? Who does that anymore??? Great CS! Then sat myself to a bar table and despite all my silly requests after not being able to watch my game, the waiter David provided me with excellent service and professionaalism! This team is outstanding, and I appreciate it, cuz great service is hard to come by these days... Thanks!!! And actually, the original bartender was very nice and helpful!!!"
Katie V.,"Phoenix, AZ",7,79,25,1.0,2/4/2014,"It's not good enough to go back. Mixed drinks are weak, waitress never around, you can't really mess up a salad and a burger ?? But some how they managed.  The really gross thing? The waiters carry the food out of the kitchen and walk by the hostess stand/waiting area.... A guy turned to cough and totally coughed all over someone's food a waiter walked by with. So gross! So on a busy weekend night just remember your food is walking by all kinds of nasty droplets! I challenge you to look up what illness and disease are transmitted just by talking, laughing, coughing, sneezing. I don't think you'd appreciate the placement of their kitchen!"
Lisa S.,"National City, CA",74,24,38,1.0,8/1/2015,"Not good service at all!  We got there at 3:00pm..ordered, did not receive our food until 4:10pm..we never heard from our waiter until we had to ask for check..restaurant was not that busy..not a good experience at all."
Amanda O.,"Carlsbad, San Diego, CA",79,63,38,4.0,6/8/2014,"I wish I could start every meal with a poozkie! Hmmm! Although I do really enjoy my meal every time I come here, in my ""foodie"" heart I cannot give them 5 stars. This place has tons of different options all of which are done well, but not great! There menu can be a little overwhelming, which can also be a good thing at times. They have a huge variety of different foods, it's a great place for a group of people as they are able to meet cravings of all food types. They have a new form of payment you can choose, we tried it today and received 5 dollars off! Love me some coupons! .. It is an app you download and pay when you are ready. If you ever receive bad service and are ready to run out of there this is the way to do it!"
Charles and Elizabeth W.,"Gilbert, AZ",36,13,1,2.0,4/6/2014,"I give it 2 and a half stars.  I went here today with my family and my in-laws. I chose this place because I really enjoy the Escondido one but this is closer. I wanted to drink a beer since this is a brew restaurant. They were out of 5 beers that I wanted. 2 of those were supposedly always on tap. What a joke. Their beers are weak but I was so disappointed with all of the beers that they were out of so I just decided on iced tea.  Their food is decent but the pizookie is amazing. Atmosphere is very nice and the restaurant is clean. Service is off and on. It was not great today. She had no knowledge of the beers that they had (or should i say didn't have). My wife is vegetarian and lactose intolerant. She got a small salad but it had parmesan on it. She returned it and got a wedge salad but it had bacon on it. Every time that we have gotten one here before, it's not had bacon on it.  However, the hospitality leader John was really nice and apologetic. He tried his best to make things right. Our sever never apologized but John salvaged the experience a little...."
Lizzy P.,"Salt Lake City, Salt Lake City, UT",192,159,18,5.0,12/29/2013,"My hubby grew up in California, going to BJs often, and has wanted to take me for a while now, but we don't have one in Utah. So, while visiting San Diego area we noticed one in the area and made it a point to finally take me there. I'm really not into chain restaurants, but I do love brew pubs, especially ones with gluten free/wheat free options.  They have a great atmosphere. The service was super friendly, and they interacted a lot with my kids too. We loved our beers, great kid menu items with options for my vegetarian/vegan kids as well. I really liked my GF pizza. They really did it well with their flat crust pizza for GF, and the cheese blend was perfect and not bland at all.  I LOVED the gluten free pazooki! I would go back over and over again for that hot cookie covered in ice cream! It didn't taste gluten free, and I didn't get a stomache ache (wheat reaction). YUM! I'm a big fan!"
Jeff L.,"San Diego, CA",158,219,69,4.0,9/3/2012,"This location is way better than the one in UTC.  It is way more spacious and there are a ton of people hanging out and having fun.  It's a terrific atmosphere.   We sat at the bar for awhile watching preseason football and Sunday night baseball all at the same time.  After about a hour or so, we got a table and had dinner with some friends.  We had a lot of fun and the food was pretty good!  Prices were reasonable also."
Anthony S.,"Temecula, CA",324,262,830,3.0,3/30/2015,"We got a deep dish pizza that was really good. Crust is amazing as well as all of the toppings. The pizza was warm and not hot at all. It must have been sitting out for a few minutes before it made it to us. The one we got had minimal pepperoni and sausage. We also ordered a chicken Thai Salad. There were only 6 small chunks of chicken in the salad. Service was good. Not the fastest order to food time, but not obnoxiously long either. There is a bar section that you can seat yourself. This section has bar tables for 4 and booths. The other de toon has lots of booths and tables. We will give this place another try. Maybe it was an off day today. Small pizza and a salad to share for $24."
Andy A.,"Oceanside, CA",134,49,1,3.0,12/27/2013,"Went for a late lunch with the fam. Service was mediocre and slow...even with the restaurant being only about half full. Food was pretty good. A couple of us had the soup & salad. My son and daughter each had a burger and said it was pretty dry. I've been to this location once before and it was way louder than it was today...so I did appreciate the fact that I could enjoy talking with my kids. For the prices, I definitely think they could do a little better with the quality of food and service."
