Peter W.,"Mesa, AZ",27,78,,3.0,3/25/2015,"I have been to a lot of BJ restaurants. My experience is usually the same at all of them. The food is great. Everything is tasty  on the menu. The menu is huge! There are so many good things to pick from. The problem I had this time was with the service. We hardly saw our waiter. Filled our soda's once maybe twice. I asked for a side of ranch and it took 20 minutes. I understand when things are busy it takes time, but it wasn't busy at all. After coming back to our table 20 minutes later with the ranch we were done with our food. Next was the bill. This as well took a considerable amount of time to get our credit cards back. Bad service this time but great food even without the ranch."
Kevin W.,"Oceanside, CA",11,59,34,2.0,4/18/2015,"Decent food, okay service. Pazzokies are the only reason BJs is still in business, due to the quality of other restaurants across the free way and nearby."
kristine f.,"Honolulu, HI",92,185,234,4.0,4/16/2012,"I usually go to the Burbank location when I am in LA for vacation.  But this time around, my bff mentioned that BJs was in the area now.  Mind you it has been way too long since my last trip to the SD area.  With that, I was totally stoked for BJs.  BFF and I always have to go a Pizookie....you know because it's simply amaze-balls. I ventured off from the normal deep dish pizza specialities and went with the California Club Flat Bread Pizza!!! OMG it was TOTES AMAZE BALLS.  Every bite was buttery and cripsy.  The bacon was cooked to perfection, the ranch dressing drizzle really added to it and the bacon was perfectly crispy.  OMG I want to order 10 for myself right this moment...IF the franchise owners are reading this, please open a BJs in Hawaii.  I think it would be a huge hit."
Ms-Independent Leo N.,"Carlsbad, San Diego, CA",8,14,18,2.0,6/4/2014,Had the boneless wings and avocado rolls and it was not as amazing as everyone leads on personal pan pizzas are over priced. And the restrooms are soooo dark the lights are do dim it's like the lights are already off... Totally disappointed
Darla D.,"San Dimas, CA",166,885,685,5.0,1/26/2015,This location is great. It is close to my timeshare and it is nice and big inside. The booths are comfy. The bar area is also very accommodating. The outside seating is also nice because not many locations have the outside patios. I had great service and the food was good. The bathrooms were very clean. No complaints ...
Sarah C.,"San Diego, CA",34,7,,5.0,4/23/2016,Great dinner today! We sat outside and the employees were very attentive to the heat lamps for us. Our server was Joshua M. and he was wonderful! Very friendly and making sure everything was done in a timely matter and correctly. I had the yummy Cobb derby chicken salad and my husband had the ribs! Both delicious along with the skinny fries and avocado egg rolls! Good experience
Justin P.,"Los Angeles, CA",27,38,68,2.0,9/12/2013,"With a name like BJ's I should of known it would kind of blow.  They have a decent selection of their own BJ's brewed beers. I tried the porter and the brown ale while my roommate tried the ""Hop-storm"" IPA and none of them were very good... they all had a very bland, watered down  finish. They weren't horrible or offensive tasting but they certainly aren't the kind of beers that will bring you back for another taste.  We also ordered a Margherita flatbread that took almost a half hour to get and it wasn't that good either. It tasted alright, it's pretty hard to make cheese covered bread taste bad, but it certainly was missing something... namely, tomatoes. It did have some tomato sauce, but hardly any at all. I don't see what would be so hard about dicing up some tomatoes to make this flatbread  acceptable of it's Margherita name... Tomatoes aren't expensive. Other than that, the bartender was friendly and the atmosphere was not far off from a TGI Fridays or Chili's."
Barbara B.,"Carlsbad, San Diego, CA",8,30,14,5.0,11/22/2013,"I LOVE this place! Service is consistently fast, efficient and polite.  I love the under 600 calorie menu.  I have had the Mahi-Mahi with pineapple rice, Morrocan Salmon, Bison burger, chicken blah,blah,blah...they are all delicious!  I am such a fan my husband has come over to my side. Now we can eat out, love it and not be bloated and sluggish. Give it a try!"
Amleht O.,"Wrightwood, CA",3,8,6,1.0,6/18/2015,Ordered an hour ago... Still no food. Hungry babies. TipOmeter goes down down down......
Andrea P.,"San Diego, CA",49,13,2,5.0,12/15/2014,"Amazing service. Thank you Amy, I will from now on take any suggestion you make. Great place to watch sports and eat some great food."
Breanna S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",52,82,4,5.0,4/19/2014,"Our experience here was very nice! We had two servers as our first lovely lady went on her break and we got another pleasant server! I believe their names were Stephanie and Fredrick??  Our pizza came out perfect, the fried artichoke and the stuffed mushrooms were amazing and the birthday pazooki topped it off for a great night!"
Wendy R.,"Encinitas, CA",4,286,,5.0,1/2/2015,"BJs has turned it around in the last year. The pizzas are back to great! We especially love the BJs Favorite. We're missing the Spinach Artichoke pizza though, wish they hadn't removed it from the menu."
M L.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,54,117,5.0,4/12/2015,Stopped by for a quick meal after the movie. Ordered two soups and an appetizer. Food was BJ's good. Service was ok. Then come paying time waitress got stuck talking to another waitress. After a while she came back and asked if there was anything I needed. Check and a manager. Check came in. Manager (Michael) walked up to the table too. We discussed a couple of things. Michael was very attentive and understanding of some of my concerns. After a really good conversation we parted our ways. Michael is definitely a guy who understands what BJ service is all about and takes a great deal of pride in delivering nothing but the best. He deserves a lot of praise and maybe a promotion.
Karen P.,"Oceanside, CA",0,9,,5.0,8/24/2015,"Went for Sunday dinner and the food was fantastic. Family of four, including 2 teens. We all loved our appetizer and entre choices. Highly recommend this spot! We had 2 new burgers, can't remember names but one included gauc and both with jalopenos (somehow not at all spicy)...they were to die for...pizza, ribs, calamari, and potato skins were also great. Can't say enough about those burgers though! Oh and service was also excellent! Note for those with small kids, pizza can be on the spicey side. We loved everything."
Tay A.,"San Diego, CA",34,135,47,3.0,4/28/2015,"Salad , lettuce was soggy, too many crutons, didn't have any cheese but the shrimp added was delicious. Nice atmosphere."
Linda S.,"Encinitas, CA",0,14,,2.0,1/13/2016,"We love this restaurant normally but the last two times we had dirty silverware and napkins.  When we brought it to the attention of the manager on duty, his response and attitude was less than professional.  The second time it happened a different manager was on duty, it was on Jan.11 for lunch. I opened up my napkin and it was disgustingly dirty.  The manager came over and said, ""that's not dirt it's lint from the dryer (which it clearly was not)"".  He didn't want to change it so we said we'd like a different one.  He was disgusted and stormed away and brought another one.  He said open it.  I did and it had at least 9 pea size balls of lint inside.  He said there, it's only lint.  We said it was unappetizing to see on a black napkin.  He left and returned and threw down a plastic bag and said here use a paper napkin and left."
Katie W.,"Escondido, CA",0,111,28,2.0,3/27/2014,"At 11:45 . . . three people at hostess station . . . no eye contact even when the ""welcome to BJs"" was uttered. Made us wait for a table even though it was before lunch crowd arrived. Had the new brussel sprouts with kale salad and I left hungry. Really confused / surprised about service. Just lack-luster. Go to Veggie Grill. Or Kings. Or Ranch Market. Or bring your own lunch!  P.S. Menu is ridiculous. Way too many items."
Michelle M.,"Vista, CA",51,13,1,1.0,7/1/2013,"I've been a fan of BJ's for years. I love their endless menu options and of course, their pizookies. I was so excited when they built one close to me here in Carlsbad. Normally, I never take the time to write a negative review. However, I have received VERY poor service the last two times I've been here and have not felt appreciated by management whatsoever when I've raised my concerns. I went here this past week to celebrate a friend's birthday and it took over 3 hours for us to receive our dinners. There was 6 of us, so not a huge group to accommodate. The drinks appetizers were brought out at different times (one by one it seemed). Half of the dinner orders were taken and the waiter did not come back for another half hour to take the rest of our orders.  The worst part of this experience was by far the treatment we received from the manager. Her attitude made us feel very unappreciated and the best she could offer us was to comp the cheapest item on every check (which came out to taking about 5 dollars off of our $40 bill). I believe some reevaluating of the management staff needs to take place at this location. This is also not the first time or incident I've heard of this happening."
Joshua G.,"Oceanside, CA",1,23,3,3.0,8/2/2015,"BJ's is a nice family restaurant but lacks in quality taste and quality flavor. BJ's takes on what I like to call a ""burnt"" feel with their flatbread pizza and burgers. I feel like it could be better but it's alright for going out for dinner."
Patrick S.,"Los Alamitos, CA",89,365,235,4.0,7/23/2013,"Needing to burn time while I waited for my Ranger to get oil/tires changed I saw BJ's next to the dealership. I went in was seated promptly, waitress was friendly and recommended Buffalo burger so I ordered it and a Pepsi. Burger was good and dessert ( cookie with vanilla ice cream) was also nice. Price was reasonable and overall good experience and usage of time."
