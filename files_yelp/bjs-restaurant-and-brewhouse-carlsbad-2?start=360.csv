Jennifer M.,"Oceanside, CA",1,6,,5.0,8/1/2014,"BJ's Restaurant is a CLASS ACT!!! Thank you for your overwhelming community support and wonderful TASK FORCE of employees, who truly understand the meaning of ""paying it forward""! BJ's food and service has always been great! On top of that, their support for our Carlsbad Relay For Life on July 26th, 2014 was over the top spectacular! Thank you! Carlsbad Relay For Life Committee"
Kate M.,"Encinitas, CA",0,40,,2.0,10/12/2015,"Very poor service. Came in for a late dinner since everything better closes so early on a monday night. Started promising enough, we sat in the bar area and were greated quickly. Everything went downhill from there. I don't expect much from BJs food. It's bar food, not much to screw up, food was totally fine as long as you don't expect much. Service was a disaster. My fiancé and I have worked in fine dining for years so I have a very high threshold for bad service. I get that everyone has an off night. The server was rude and barely acknowledged us, despite us acknowledging her every time she stopped by the table. Refilled waters quickly but waited forever for drinks, condiments, etc. Came over to ask if I wanted another glass of wine while my fiancé was still eating his meal, I did. Brought it and immediately dropped the check. She clearly wanted to sit with her friends that were off earlier and having drinks in the bar area. Felt totally rushed and just bizarre timing."
Joshua W.,"Twentynine Palms, CA",0,5,,5.0,6/9/2015,They have an awesome section on the menu. It took me a while to decide what to order. I finally went with the bison burger and it was amazing. I will definitely eat here more often. Quite a few more sections I want to try. If the rest of the food is as amazing as the bison burger I am in for a treat. The bar tender Johnny was awesome as well.
Valerie G.,"San Diego, CA",27,14,130,3.0,3/16/2014,"We had a very attentive server, Katherine R.  The hostess and person that seated us were not welcoming and did not smile when we walked in and when she seated us.  We ordered the Brewhouse burger; Jalapeño burger; BBQ Bison burger & the Classic burger.  Sadly, the burgers tasted ""just okay"",  I used to look forward to eating at this restaurant, but after tasting Umami burgers and burgers at places i.e. Eureka, etc., the burgers at this place cannot compete."
Tere J.,"Carlsbad, CA",2,6,,1.0,5/3/2015,"Thought we would give this place another try, as the other BJ's we've eaten at have been decent. The service was TERRIBLE. It took 10-15 minutes before the server even came to take our order.  After the meals arrived, the server came back once to check on us. The glass of wine I ordered wasn't served until long after our food...& only after  I flagged down another employee. When the food arrived, my burger was lukewarm & obviously had been sitting for awhile...I tend to cut servers a lot of slack, as they deal with rude & demanding people all the time. However, this server was more interested in joking with his coworkers at their station instead of working. The restaurant just opened & wasn't busy, so he had no excuse for his laziness."
Lori R.,"Oceanside, CA",1,14,1,1.0,6/4/2015,"Had the BJ burger, mediocre at best.  Service left a lot to be desired. Plenty of staff walking around, never even offered a refill on my drink. Won't be back here, although it's the only place that I know of open for food till midnight."
Brigette S.,"Oceanside, CA",0,31,,2.0,8/26/2015,"The location is good, the service is terrible. Asked for water with lemon, never got it. Asked if the salads came with bread, roll anything? ""Nope"" was the waiters response. I MIGHT be able to get you some crackers. He could have cared less. These guys need major training in service.  The salads were ok, ordered Thai chicken salad & Asian salad. Have had way better. I would recommend sitting at the bar, if you have to meet someone there, have a beer (can't screw that up) and go somewhere else for food. That was another thing, the music was so loud you could hardly hear each other talk. This is not a dance bar, yet the music is so loud it feels like one. I did not see a dance floor."
Adron B.,"San Jose, CA",13,17,,5.0,7/21/2015,"Pizza has always been great, but I never ventured out to the appetizers until now.  Good thing I did.  Good wings, ribs, ect.  Open late and great beer always on tap.  Staff was on top of things."
Guy O.,"Carlsbad, CA",23,7,6,1.0,4/19/2015,"Service sucks, you wait forever for your food and the server never checked back with us!"
Patrick H.,"Oceanside, CA",396,110,27,4.0,8/31/2013,"It's a cool, chill atmosphere to go when you need a brew and some grub, but I think you need to be brewed up to like the grub. I got BJ's Bacon Burger and I wasn't much of a fan of it. To have your name on it, it's gotta be the ""S"", but it definitely wasn't because for some reason, I was expecting succulent, mouth-watering, crave-nothing-else type of burger and what I got was a dry, burnt, dead type of burger. It's like the meat had cremated-meat for seasoning. I don't know. Late night? Maybe. Chef had a bad day? Maybe. For all I know, next time I'm going to try the Teriyaki Salmon or whatever it was called that my friend got. Now that looked delicious. So even though, I had a bad experience, doesn't make that every time has be a bad experience. The Vibe/Atmosphere, Great Friends, Great Service, Something else, I'm gonna give it a 4. It could be a 5, but not just yet. d:)"
Jay M.,"Oceanside, CA",2,20,,1.0,3/20/2015,"Lousy food unless you like Dijornals Pizza, and if you do why pay nearly 100 dollars for one.  Two drinks, 3 salads, and a Dijornals PIzza came to 95 dollars.  They got no tip because the service from the hostess and manager were bad.  Make a policy and stay with it.  Of course this is inconsequential because I will never go back.  If you like this kind of food and service you probably have never been to a good place before and you will be happy with this place.  Good luck."
Danielle B.,"San Diego, CA",150,68,38,3.0,2/8/2015,Best place to watch the football games with the happy hours deal although the food is the mass produced commercial variety if you don't mind that. The number of TVs is great in the bar area so there's never a blocked view. The service is great even if it's ridiculously busy they are very attentive but you can tell they have the indoctrinated schpeel about appetizers and special menu items of the month/season.
Apryl T.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",956,184,109,2.0,4/8/2013,I don't know what it is about this particular Bj's but service isn't up to par like most of them I have eaten at.  We came in around 4:30 on a Saturday afternoon and there was only 1 party of two ahead of us. We had just came from Legoland so we were tired with our little one. There were tons of empty tables and lots of servers walking around but the 3 hostess said it would be like 15-20 minute wait. We saw there was 1 table sitting outside and we asked if we could sit down out there any faster and they said no. So we literally waited 20 minutes to sit down and watch the hostess gossip among each other than try to seat people.  Once we sat down we waited around for a really long time. I understand if there isn't servers available but when you see a large group of them standing around computers and not working their tables that can be a little frustrating.  Our food was its usual excellence here and so were the beverages. Chocolate Chip Pizookie was outstanding and made me feel better about the slow service.
Mama D.,"Oceanside, CA",1,98,8,3.0,11/11/2014,"Wow. It's Veterans Day, so I saved seating by sitting at the bar & the service couldn't have been more slack. Congratulations that Hooters kicked your butt today for politeness,  timeliness,  efficiency,  the list goes on. Not only did bartender Johnny confirm that swapping pasta for brown rice was okay, he said a half & half (lunch dish w/salad) would be cool (smaller portion of chicken lunch & small version of a wedge salad). Okay: DONE, or so I thought.  After awaiting any attention to sampling two beers--he pitches immediately upon my sitting,  I thought, ""hey, it's Veteran's Day--kinda busy"" to myself. Whatever. After multiple delays and just being flat up ignored (the 2nd beer taster, my box later)...I was just over it. 'Peista resistance': the fact that I was not only charged for my FREE lunch (yes, I flashed my ID right away), I'd been UP-CHARGED. Seriously?  Because it's not uncomfortable enough to have to mention he screwed up, he charges me MORE?  I alerted him to this faux pas, and he makes me wait (again) a really long time & takes other orders,  and more while I'm waiting for the remedy. Okay, now you're just being a jerk & I'm seething at this treatment ON VETERANS DAY. After attempting to flag him down for a (leftover) box,  I gave up & asked the other bartender.  I hated to bug him, he had other folks to attend to, yet didn't have much choice. As it was, I had to remind him too. But at least he brought it.  By now, Johnny STILL had not come over to explain that had he adjusted the bill.  Idk, I'm thinking 15 minutes after pulling 'that',  you're just not great service staff.  I decided there's no way I can't tell a manager. I write a note on my bill (that this guy took no time whatsoever in sticking in a rock glass in front of me) stating a GM should call me ASAP bcs they're getting Yelped. Did I mention the two young,  male GIs next to me had proper bills & didn't have to ask for correction?  Yeah. And the interesting fellow drawing Batman on his digital tablet next to me--Johnny had time to look at his other drawings to where the guy offered him, ""wanna see my son?"" Lordy. Helloooo, customers waiting--aisle five. And this bartender also explained to someone who queried why it was so busy, ""it's the free meals for veterans"". Wow, jackaxx: a) you're welcome, b) sorry WE have inconvenienced you. Manager Anthony followed me out to see what happened. I told him the whole situ & how I   $$ in the rock glass & asked if he approach me based on the note passed to a waitress. I let Anthony know that if my note didn't surface,  they have a 'bigger issue'.  Anthony was great, and most the staff was on their game, yet this isn't the kind of thing you can 'gift card' away. Get your crap together. I'll go to another BJs, or none at all. With all the choices in North County, folks don't have to endure this type of behavior. You're BJs, it ain't the Ritz."
Phil M.,"Escondido, CA",0,35,46,1.0,8/31/2014,Let me start off by saying this place has horrible Service.  9:00 Saturday for dinner we were seated immediately. we witnessed a waiter arguing with a lady at the next booth we said to ourself we hope that this is not our server well it was he refuses to write anything down our order was all wrong the lady at the next booth said the same thing happened to them we did not leave BJ's in tell 12:00 at night BJ's needs to to look at all the Yelp reviews on service.   Service is 1 Star. and for the price you pay you need 4 Stars.  if you are in a rush don't come to this place.  and by the way I ordered one of their beers and the glass was dirty the bubbles in the beer stick  to the side of the glass when it is a dirty glass!!
Felicia C.,"Hillcrest, San Diego, CA",10,3,,2.0,11/16/2014,"Idk if it was just super busy tonight or what but service was lagging, our drinks kept getting mixed up, and most of my parties meals were either undercooked or overcooked and we had to change continously ask for water refills which we never got so not so good tonight bjs"
Shannon O.,"Encinitas, San Diego, CA",1,40,22,4.0,7/17/2013,"This place is someplace you can rely on for pretty good food, although they do have some stars. Their hot wings are to die for, spend the extra 5 bucks on the full, rather than happy hour so you can fill your tummy to the max with this delicious babies! Although their happy hour is a really good deal. Don't go for the poke, as they obviously don't know what it is, and only give you a scoop, and your money is worth well more than that. Their CA club pizza is pretty darn good. Joy is a sincerely wonderful server, who has topped off my nights many times, although there are others who might serve you that would much rather have you out of the restaurant and them in their own beds, which is an unfortunate way to end the evening and spend my money."
Sara S.,"San Diego, CA",6,29,1,1.0,11/1/2014,This place is awful. Bad service. Average bland food. We didn't even get water until 20 minutes after we were seated. Appetizers and main course were served at the same  time.
Danielle S.,"Oceanside, CA",27,7,,5.0,11/5/2013,Sitting at the bar with Lindsey is the perfect end to a long day! She helped me pick the perfect beer and pizza. 1 star for having their own beers 1 star for an amazing Bartender 1 star for delicious pizza 1 star for quick service 1 star for the huge Tv behind the bar
Laurie B.,"Vista, CA",216,208,4090,1.0,9/20/2015,"My in-laws arrived today from Virginia and my husband and I decided to take them here.  We went around 8ish and waited for an available table as it was busy.  We get seated, look over the menu, talk etc. 5 minutes pass by, several employees walk past our table without asking if someone's taken our drink order, or if we've been helped which was frustrating. Our waitress comes to take our order for drinks, and at that time were ready to put in our food order too. I was still giving this place the benefit of the doubt with it being busy,  and  our waitress being overwhelmed with other tables. I ordered the bacon guacamole deluxe burger, my mother in law had a tortilla soup. A guy server came by to drop her soup off. He asked if she wanted lemon in her soup before she could say no he already started adding it in the bowl. He touched her food and took it out.  I've never seen something like this. It's not sanitary or professional in my opinion.  He then dropped her spoon down in a rude manner. Once the rest of the food came out I asked the waitress for some ranch. When I finally got it i was practically done with my food and didn't need it anymore. The burger itself was good nothing special, the fries weren't even hot. My drink wasn't refilled and she didn't come and check on us or apolozie or anything. At this point were ready to leave. Presented credit card faced up in the black book so she could see it,  5 minutes later it's picked up. Night times are not their specialty, last year was the last time we were here. We thought things changed and we would have better service this time around, and gave them another try. If I could give 0 Stars I would. Don't come here."
