Jeremmmy C.,"Sahuarita, AZ",0,20,,3.0,5/1/2015,"Good food, accommodations. Lousy service. I greatly appreciate the staff catering to our child with food allergies, and the food was decent. However, the service left much to be desired. While the staff kept promising basic amenities, such as refills, plates, and condiments, they either never arrived or came after I had finished my food. It took 20 minutes to get a refill, and the restaurant was not that busy."
Mirna E.,"Oceanside, CA",214,422,4169,3.0,6/22/2011,"I've been to this BJ's a handful of times either for happy hour or for lunch/dinner.  I've also been to the Chula Vista and La Mesa locations.  This place has a fairly large menu.  The majority of the time I've ordered pizza which is really good.  However, on one occasion I decided to try something different and had their Mediterranean pasta which was a bad choice because the topping was SO salty.  I think the pizza here is really good and they have a great selection of micro-brews.  I would recommend trying their pizza and having some beer if you go here.  They have a really good happy hour where you can get personal pizza's for a good price.  You also have to try their pazookie dessert which is awesome!  It's a freshly baked cookie (different flavors) with a vanilla scoop on top.  It's incredibly good but sweet, so it's best to share.   Service here is fair, but can be expected with how busy the restaurant gets.  I would have liked to see better service, but the food makes up for it.  This place specializes in pizza, beer, and pazookies and are definitely worth a try."

Amar L.,"Encinitas, CA",0,4,,5.0,5/31/2015,"I don't remember my servers name, but we were there late at night and she has red hair and was the nicest person I think I've ever came across, just genuinely a great person. The food was spot on, it's some of the best deep dish pizza around and the pizzookies are absolutely amazing. Love this location, love the food, and shout out to our waitress, you're the real MVP!"

Crissa R.,"Big Bear Lake, CA",61,14,1,4.0,9/5/2014,Stopped in for a quick dessert and enjoyed every bite of a chocolate chip pazzokie! BJ's is my go to for a yummy cookie and ice cream.
Liz C.,"San Diego, CA",45,328,6,2.0,10/14/2013,"I went to BJ's last night after shopping at the outlets across the street. For a Sunday night, it was packed! My group of 7 adults + 1 baby waited about 15 minutes. Since we were all hungry, we perused the menu while waiting so we could order right away. Once seated, we started with calamari. Once we were done, the plates were cleared and it felt like we were forgotten about for awhile because it took forever to get our entrees. I went with a new dish, the Moroccan spiced salmon, and it was just ok. It smelled great, but I was disappointed by the portion size. For the price, I expected more food. Also, I had no spoon, but the dish was soupy because there was so much sauce, so it was hard to pick up the couscous. My bf went with the spaghetti and meatballs. The meatballs were the tastiest thing I tried all night. They had good spices and even had a bit of a kick. The noodles were bland. I would have liked hot sauce with both dishes but our server didn't come by to check on us for a long time.  My friends got pork chops, ahi tuna salad, fettuccine alfredo, hawaiian mahi mahi, and a house salad. Most of them were satisfied with their dishes, but the hawaiian mahi mahi was a disappointment because it was tiny. Hence, the side order of house salad. One neat thing about BJ's is they have a few handcrafted sodas. They weren't listed on the menu but one of my friends knew about it from a previous visit so she got a cherry coke (I think?) which I tried and it was pretty good."
Erin W.,"San Marcos, CA",197,124,27,5.0,12/7/2012,"I've been a regular at BJ's Restaurant chain for many years. I was too the moon excited when I saw this location being built a few years back. My friends and I frequent the restaurant. They have a well stocked, full bar with a massive TV for sports watching and happy hour.  I wanted to write this review because I hosted my husbands birthday party there last night. We had a party of 16 out on the patio and the servers and management were very accommodating. We called ahead for reservations and basically had the whole patio area to ourselves. I wish we had taken our servers name because he was nothing short of stellar! Drinks were always filled and food came to the table fast. He was happy and engaging with us. I highly suggest their deep dish pizza! Fantastic service, great food, clean and hip atmosphere, five star! Thank you BJ's for hosting a wonderful evening!"
Sethro M.,"Oceanside, CA",157,24,8,4.0,3/22/2015,"Always great love the alcohol selection always friendly but if you want a seat quickly call and reserve a spot ahead of time, definitely worth it. and if your having a pajama day take out has great service to"
M C.,"Bonita, CA",1,43,13,5.0,8/14/2014,"Dave M. In the bar made the whole experience fabulous! Truly. The best service we have had in a long time. Thanks, Dave! You were on top of everything!!! HH wings = perfect. HH sliders = yum. HH martini = refilled before HH was over. Ribeye steak was good and the five meat flatbread pizza was delicious!!!"
Amber N.,"Carlsbad, CA",2,15,,4.0,2/8/2015,"After being completely ignored by the hostess for 5 minutes,  we went to seat ourselves in the bar area... we split a french dip, and a pozookie, both we absolutely delicious! Our server David was great! Hostess seemed to be off in another land, she wasn't busy with other guests. Not sure about that one!"
Lisa C.,"Brookline, MA",3,95,191,4.0,8/15/2014,Great service! Good family friendly food.  Server was very careful with our meal.... So reassuring since I have a food allergic child. The restaurant was able to accommodate our allergies and food prep requests. Our server was gracious and helpful. Couldn't ask for better!
Pamela F.,"Carlsbad, CA",17,84,57,5.0,8/10/2014,Had dinner here again tonight. Consistently good food. Service was exceptional! Anthony G. was better than excellent! Will definitely be back!!
Suzy E.,"Bedford, MA",0,17,,2.0,10/7/2015,Service was pretty disappointing.  We were a party of 7 on a business account and would have ordered more stuff if we could have just got someone to come over.  Food was OK.
Doug B.,"Anderson, IN",668,211,209,5.0,7/3/2013,"The bartenders are great and there is usually room at the bar.  The menu is a good selection so there will always be something you like.  There is a decent happy hour, one at the normal happy hour times and another starting at 10:00 PM.  You know it is a late night place when they have a 10PM happy hour.  Occasionally the quality control is a bit off, so I've had a few things I've sent back.  I don't know if maybe all of the cooks are on the same level.  My biggest complaint has been pizzas that were clearly just ingredients on top of a pre-made crust and warmed up (not cooked together so you turn the pizza upside down and the stuff all falls out).  That has happened twice now, but most of the time everything was excellent.  I've also ordered spagetti and was disappointed in the less than generous amount of sauce.  For the price, they'd be better off erring on the side of generous.  I always go back, so they must be doing something right!"
Sharon V.,"Carlsbad, CA",2465,1106,473,4.0,9/13/2010,"This review has been sitting in my drafts for awhile but now I'm finally getting this baby published.  I've been here several times with a small group and in large groups and I honestly have never experienced poor service like the rest of the reviews have noted.  This last visit, we arrived to celebrate a family affair that had well over 50 peeps in their semi-private room on the side of the restaurant. Our friends had coordinated a buffet as well as a few deep dish pizzas for each table and everything was delicious.  The food has always been pretty consistent but to be honest, I've never really strayed from their appetizers, salads and pizzas and have never tried their pastas.  I'm usually not a big fan of deep dish pizzas but I am a fan of theirs. Their buttery crusts are just finger licking good and worth the calories and extra time spent at the gym.  During this last visit, I was amazed on how well they took care of this large party. Drink orders were a bit slow but the staff did a great job keeping up with the rest of our needs the best they could. Reggie was one of our servers on this joyous day and he's also been our server when we've come in here in the past. As always, he stood out from the rest and did a fantastic job.  Thanks BJ's for another great dining experience."
Patricia D.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,7,,1.0,3/31/2015,I am usually the person in my family who wants to go to BJ's because I really enjoy the food and the games that are on the TV's. I went for a late lunch by myself and decided to sit at the bar. The bar tender asked if I wanted one of the 2 BJ beers he mentioned and I asked if I could see a menu for the rest of the beers. He threw one over and didn't bother to come back for 5minutes. And I didn't mind that but when I was ready to order it was impossible for me to get his attention. He had 4 friends sitting at the bar and was more busy talking to them about sports and movies.  After 20 minutes I finally ordered and that was the last I ever talked to the waiter until I told him I wanted a to go box. This whole time he is checking in on he people around me and asking how their food and drinks are.  I usually sit in the bar but if I see this bartender there again I will not be sitting there ever again.
J D.,"Anaheim Hills, CA",4957,1982,28926,4.0,9/13/2010,"Some friends and I decided to come here on a Friday night to hang out and have a few drinks and some food.  The joint was packed and we had to wait 20 minutes for our table...not a big deal since the weather was awesome, we sat outside to wait. I ordered a Small BJ's Favorite Pizza (Oven-baked meatballs, pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, black olives, white onions and seasoned tomatoes), my friends ordered Baby Back Ribs and Chardonnay Shrimp Pasta (Plump shrimp, sautéed with garlic, basil, onions, fire-roasted red peppers, Roma and sun-dried tomatoes over rotelle noodles in a creamy Chardonnay wine sauce, topped with crisp Applewood smoked bacon, fresh Parmesan cheese and parsley).  To wash it down I ordered a Big Fish IPA. I enjoyed the IPA while waiting for the food....it was very tasty with a strong Hop flavor....big and bold, just how I like it! The food came out after a little while and I dove into the Pizza.  It is suppose to be Chicago Deep Dish Pizza....but it really isn't.  Real Chicago Deep Dish would kill you after 1 Slice...the Small had 4 Slices and I ate 2 and shared 2 with my friends.  The crust was very moist and buttery and the proportion of ingredients was perfect.....they all complimented each other without overwhelming the Pizza. I tried one of my friend's Baby Back Ribs....they were a little dry and didn't fall off the bone....I'd say they were average.  My other friend really enjoyed the Chardonnay Shrimip....I didn't sample it.  After we ate, we hung out a while longer and drank a few more beers....we were never rushed and our glasses were kept full. Overall, it was a fun experience.  Will I return?  You bet."
William B.,"Oceanside, CA",22,260,137,4.0,6/16/2013,"2nd time we've been here and like before, the menu selection is big enough that it takes a bit of looking over, which maybe the waitress forgot when she came over a scarcely a moment after we were seated.  We needed a few moments and finally I got a sampler size of the berry burst cider (yummy!) and a vanilla creme soda.  Wife got the root beer and we agreed the sodas were quite good.  Got the artichoke and spinach dip which was creamy and mild tasting. Fish & chips I had were good; the fish pieces were of a good size and the skinny fries were done just right.  Wife had the Moroccan Spiced Salmon which looked nice, but tasted rather plain, despite the 9 spices it's supposed to be flavored with. Usually when we drive by, this place seems to be really busy but on at 1pm on a Friday, there was only a 2 minute wait which is fine by me.   Menu here seems to have pretty much something for everyone.   4 stars because while the food I had this time and the black and bleu burger I had last time were good, it's not good enough to be great.   Still worth coming back for though, especially since I see they have deep dish pizza here and short of going to San Diego for it, deep dish is hard to come by."
Steph M.,"Carlsbad, CA",2,19,,4.0,12/26/2014,Really nice place with very friendly staff.  I feel at home when I eat here.  The food is very good (especially the carnitas) and the prices are reasonable.
