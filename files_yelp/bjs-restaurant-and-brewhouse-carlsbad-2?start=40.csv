Trent L.,"Twentynine Palms, CA",0,2,,1.0,12/21/2017,"The service was terrible! It was not busy and we saw our waiter a total of maybe 3 times in a span of close to two hours. Our group was sat down and did not see any service for 30 minutes, not even waters for the table. This was extremely disappointing."
Keith M.,"Orange, CA",3,26,,2.0,8/2/2017,"Unfortunately I have been to several BJs now and the food a dressed up coco's quality  sure they have ridiculous amount of options, and this is the problem. any time a place lacks focus thats what you get line cooks throwing together recipes and they don't care to much because they have 40 more to pump out... so the shrimp and asparagus pasta was 4 out of 10 the veg was over cooked and the shrimp were tough.  the pizza was lacking any flare got a sweet pig with jalapenos deep dish style it was thrown together not enough sauce and the toppings were not spread around I had to rearrange them a bit  the bar keep made the worst new york sour I have ever had the lemon juice tasted very bad like it had turned...  all in all I had similar food experience the last time with jambalaya cooked to death  to bad but cant have great places without bad ones right"
Nanette B.,"Oceanside, CA",61,6,3,5.0,10/28/2017,Just had dinner..loved it always love my food and my service.. I've always had very good service here and the bar has there mixed drinks in check....
Aria S.,"Oceanside, San Diego, CA",46,5,,5.0,8/6/2017,"I haven't been to a BJ's in years because I'm allergic to gluten. We were looking for a decent dinner that the kids would enjoy, too, after Legoland.  And it came up first on Yelp.  They told us a 45-minute wait to seat a group of 9, and the kids were starting to squirm.  The GM recognized our kids and my husband from the neighborhood (nice surprise) and bumped us up in the queue, so we were seated in about 15 minutes.  Very cool! Our server was a trainee and she did really well.  She was funny and made us feel at home.   Good food does take a while to come out, and the kids were starting to melt down after the long day.  When it did come out, everything was hot and delicious.  My sister and mom ordered wedge salads that were just the right size for starters.  I ordered a gluten free pizza with pepperoni, mushrooms and sausage. It was good for gluten free.  GF crust is usually cardboard, but it was soft and chewy.  My son got the kids deep dish cheese pizza, no tomatoes (thanks to the servers for warning us that all pizzas come with chopped tomatoes - he would not have liked that).  My daughter ordered the kids sliders with salad.  My husband ordered the hickory brisket barbecue burger, which he really liked.  The GM also hooked us up on the bill, which was much appreciated after a day at Legoland.  Thank you!!"
S m.,"Spring Valley, CA",2,36,1,1.0,9/30/2017,"A friend chose this place for dinner and I wish I had suggested somewhere else! I ordered the ahi tuna salad and it was terrible. EXTREMELY soggy, wet and mushy. I am positive the salad was pre made with dressing and then sat in the fridge for at least a day or so. I don't like sending food back in general lest someone spits or does something else to the dish so I had to grin and bear it. The salad was $15.95 plus tax and tip it came out to $20. What a waste of money!"
SD G.,"San Diego, CA",27,267,1046,4.0,3/30/2016,Love coming here!  The service is good and they have a variety of choices!  I forgot to take a photo of my quinoa with salmon!  For dessert monkey bread.
Diana H.,"Denver, CO",32,90,49,5.0,10/24/2016,"I have been eating at BJ's for years and it never disappoints me. I used to eat at a location in Boulder, CO and I was so happy when I realized there was a location close by when I moved. My husband and I frequent BJ's at this location every few months. Usually it's a week night dinner or a lunch on a weekend afternoon. We ALWAYS sit in the bar. First come first served seating. They even have booths available. The menu is huge, just like a cheesecake factory, so be prepared to be overwhelmed there. I always used to get giant baked potatoes but sadly that is no longer part of the menu. The most recent occasion they were advertising a $10 off of $35 food order. We over ordered a bit so we could make that threshold and bring some food home. We weren't drinking their delicious beers this time and had an iced tea and diet coke instead. The waitress was quick to bring a refill sometimes even before we had finished the first. Which was really nice. We ordered a mini deep dish pizza to share with the works. They were 1/2 off during happy hour. This was REALLY good. Way better than I expected. My husband ordered something new off their menu, a peanut soba noodle bowl. What was so nice is it came out with fresh veggies, big green pieces of fresh broccoli and carrots. I would have expected frozen out of a chain so it was a nice surprise.  I ordered the roast beef dip sandwich. Great au jus and horseradish sauce. LOTS of wedge fries that were perfectly cooked, crispy outside, soft inside."
Samantha O.,"San Diego, CA",3,97,27,5.0,4/15/2017,Amazing customer service! Had a big group of 14 people come for a birthday party and our service was the best! Our server's name is Chauncy thank you so much for the best customer service you were on your A game! Always checking up on drinks and making sure food arrived promptly. We will be coming back again. Thanks!
Jojo F.,"Torrance, CA",80,31,18,4.0,7/5/2017,"Very nice area of Carlsbad, across the outlets and flower fields. We had avocado egg rolls for appetizers. The Mediterranean Pizza was great and being a brewery, many beer selections.Don't forget pizcookie"
Todd S.,"San Diego, CA",1,33,1,1.0,7/5/2017,"Yesterday......July 4th....and everyone's closed...it's 9pm after the fireworks ......But this restaurant was  OPEN .....  Sure wish I could give a great review but received food from employees, waitresses, and chefs that probably didn't want to work that night.... soooo....let's begin... Drinks from bar watered down with light pouring.  With so many tables open they seated us next  to loud people. Waiter forgot us sooooo many times... Food half cooked and warm-cold.... Food literally smelled funny/bad/spoiled. Why bother people....... Will not be coming back any time soon. Sadly my Aunt payed the bill so we don't have ticket number or table... Frederick was our server last night.... ENOUGH SAID.....Happy Belated Independence Day to all my friends that read my reviews...."
Taylor M.,"Oceanside, San Diego, CA",17,53,1,2.0,4/23/2017,"Subpar would be a generous compliment when describing our to go experience tonight. My husband was ignored for a decent amount of time before heading to the bar to ask for service. We received our food about 20 minutes after the proposed time which would be fine if it wasn't completely soggy and stale by the time we got home. I get that it's to go and it's not going to be perfect but two out of three orders were prepared wrong. We had no condiments. It was just a pain in the ass. Plain and simple. After enduring WWIII in my car with my kids waiting on dad forever, the best part of my dinner was a burnt Pizookie. I even got the missing lettuce on my husband's burger in it!!!"
Monica V.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,23,3,5.0,6/4/2017,Late night Pizookies need I say more? Yes! Our server Tulee or Tuli (brown hair in side pony or braid) was so friendly and attentive!  We visited late Saturday night for some calamari bacon burger and my beloved trio of pizookies All came fast and hot My boyfriends burger was cooked perfect to his liking and I couldn't keep my hands off his crispy fries Got a nice and hot coffee to have with my sweets and couldn't have asked for a more mellow yet taken care of feeling type of visit Will return for her service and the sugar rush we can never get enough of Thank you!
Daniel M.,"Scripps Ranch, San Diego, CA",39,2,1,4.0,10/4/2017,Nice ambiance. Ok food. Very friendly staff and a great place to come with your family. The stuffed mushrooms is a must.
Rosie F.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,9,,5.0,12/4/2017,"We gave BJ's a 2nd chance and we were not disappointed!  Thank you, Thank you, Thank you to GM Jack, Mark & the staff at BJ's for an excellent outing after a long weekend helping in a move!  They won back our service indeed."
Helen R.,"Vista, San Diego, CA",63,21,5,3.0,6/18/2017,"Not a fan of the size of the place (makes it noisier place than your regular restaurants.  Waiter got our order wrong...boneless chicken wings (Parmesan rub) I don't recommend, small portion and oil saturated. The ahi salad is amazing, wine selection is definitely overpriced for the selection.  More of a ""sports bar atmosphere"" than restaurant."
Nicole J.,"San Marcos, CA",20,69,12,5.0,2/25/2017,Big fan of their pizza! My favorite pizza there is the bbq chicken pizza! I like the deep dish pizza style and it's so tasty! I like that at the bar there is purse hooks so i can hang my purse while i enjoy a drink wth my husband! I have been to a few of the beer and food pairings as well! Some of them have been good and some have ben average. Since i am not an IPA guy i like the ones that don't have any IPA's so i can enjoy all the beer! The pizookie is one of the real reasons to come here! The hardest decision is to decide which one to get! The smore pizookie is probably my favorite!
Jerm M.,"Oceanside, CA",13,63,103,5.0,3/23/2017,"We recently tried the Italian market Tavern cut pizza, Hickory brisket and bacon burger,and the pizookie trio. The trio consisted of cookies and cream, salted caramel, and chocolate chunk. Our favorite was the salted caramel. The barbecue sauce on the burger was a tad bit sweet but overall a very good burger. The tavern cut pizza was very good, the Italian market had very good toppings and we actually prefer the tavern cut to the deep dish."
Sabrina N.,"Houston, TX",419,129,61,1.0,6/29/2016,"So we come into the establishment and was told there was a five minute wait as they are going to set up a table for 4 adults, 1 child and 2 high chairs. That 5 mins turn into 18 mins. After a day at LegoLand we were ready to get out grub on. Once seated, there was only 3 menus for 4 adults so we had to ask for another menu. Our waiter comes over and didn't introduce himself, If you're  going to serve someone we would like to know your name.  Long ass story short, our order got messed up, sent two steak and ribs back, asked for the manager, waited 15 mins for manager to show up, told manager we no longer have an appetite and didn't want the food, no apology but comped our food.  We rather pay for service and our food if you just apologize and asked us what happened and an apology would suffice. Instead of our food being comped and No apology. Way to go!  We still tipped the waiter since he did bring us our drinks."
Miranda H.,"Derry, NH",28,25,,1.0,9/5/2017,"Have you ever had hot coleslaw?  I did here. We ordered a little before 8, and our food didn't show up until around 9. When it got here, everything was piping hot from the heat lamps- including the cole slaw. And several other things meant to be served cold. Not exactly appetizing. Won't be returning."
Cynthia P.,"Vista, CA",631,243,632,4.0,12/9/2015,I had the Mahi with a Parmesan crusted shrimp dish. The Mahi was a little overcooked and a bit dry. The shrimp dish was excellent!  Mom had the sushi salad and hubby had the bison burger... Everyone was happy with their meals and beverages.  Prices (yes even for lunch) not for the faint of heart... Be prepared to spend at least $100 if you are having a cocktail with lunch.  The service was good but the restaurant was a little dark for the daytime. All good though
