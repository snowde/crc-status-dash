Anthony B.,"Riverside, CA",513,690,483,3.0,7/1/2013,Your average BJ's Restaurant. We asked for the outside patio since it was such a cool evening and yet they made us wait 25 minuted even though no one was on the outside patio. Our waiter was friendly and helpful and the Goose Island beer helped take the edge off the wait time to sit outside.
Bob J.,"Oceanside, CA",109,382,34,4.0,7/10/2014,"Always a good meal here.  There are many selections available (pizzas, salads, sandwiches, pastas, steaks, baby back ribs) and every item we have ordered has been very good.  Often there is a wait, so calling ahead is a good idea.  Service is  always great.  This is another place that passes my ""food looks like the menu photo"" test.  You get exactly what you expect, no surprises."
Q T.,"Del Mar, CA",4,133,41,5.0,8/11/2013,This place is totally the lunch spot! Great Mon-Fri lunch deals! Sit at the bar! Only complaint: We ordered what we thought was chicken parm but out came parmesan crusted chicken. The similarity in names of dishes is a problem because we did not get what we wanted and had no time to wait for a remake. Please change the name of the dish or confirm which chicken dish is requested. Other than that great place! Oh and the mac n cheese was pretty great if you ask me.
Adam C.,"Covina, CA",72,9,,5.0,6/20/2014,"I've been here quite a few times since I've moved to the area and wow. A teeny bit pricey for pizza and burgers, but not out of line for the food and service you're getting. Every single time I go the service is perfect. Never a problem not even a little one. The food comes out promptly and hot! The drinks are reasonably priced and tasty. The lunch specials are all amazing. Better than the BJ's at home for sure! Enjoy!"
Milee S.,"Irvine, CA",296,1096,510,4.0,4/8/2011,"This may be so cookie-cutter but it's really a lot of fun. And so many food choices that everyone can get what they want. We came during the late afternoon and were seated immediately.  Friends ordered one of the house brews; I had the berry cider. It was really really tasty.   We weren't really hungry when we got there so we split a small deep dish veggie pizza. OMG it was great!  We polished that thing off almost immediately.  For dessert, we went for the chocolate chip pizookie and the strawberry shortcake. Everything was delicious. We ended up doing a round two because after heading to Bellefleur and trying to order something before closing at Bistro West, we came back here and had some mozzerella sticks. Also yum. Great place for just hanging out with friends. Never felt rushed to leave and service in both cases was great!"
Melissa Z.,"Escondido, CA",503,42,2,2.0,7/11/2014,"We've gone there several times. It is generally crowded. However, the last time I was there was the LAST time. The food took forever, and everyone got their meal at a different time. Everyone was done eating when the last person in my group finally got his meal. We spoke with the ""manager"" (who seemed extremely young and inexperienced) and he didn't even offer to comp the last meal,l but just basically said that you get what you get."
Jerry R.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,160,4,3.0,1/4/2015,"Fun place to dine. We waited quite a while to get seated since it was a busy Saturday night but it was worth it. Scallops meal was good but the mahi mahi was a bit dry and not much flavor. The sides were good, same with the beet salad and of course they have a great beer selection. We'll be back again."
Kris R.,"Carlsbad, CA",8,46,19,2.0,10/12/2014,"Service was bad, food was alright for the price. I bought a friend here for a birthday dinner. We waited 20 minutes for a table for two which is ok for a Friday night, but then waited another 15 minutes at the table before even being acknowledged by someone, not even our waiter. Took a long time to get water when we asked. The food was good for the price. About 15.00 per person for a full meal isn't bad. The ambiance at this place is cool and the bar service was much better than at the table."
Andrina S.,"Oceanside, CA",20,30,90,4.0,6/1/2013,"This place is fantastic! I love their open faced pot roast sandwich. Also, the creamy sauce that comes on the grilled salmon is amazing! I always ask for extra when I get it!"
Rachael S.,"Orange, CA",14,216,17,1.0,5/6/2013,"Server suggested we order the avocado egg rolls - ""they're one of our biggest sellers"".  So we did.  They're horrible!  I like eating avocado but this wasn't anything special.  No flavor, just smashed avocado in an egg roll - I could do this at home.  I will never order it again. The pizza was not good - too salty and didn't settle well.  Forgot to take the olives off our pizza so they offered to make a new one.  I thought that was nice. The server was strange, after we got our meal and were eating he introduced a new server saying he was going to head out for the day.  The replacement server came by twice and didn't help with anything.  The manager ended up getting the bill and the to-go container.  Then, the next thing I know our original server is helping two other tables - weird.  The whole vibe was strange. We've had pizza at other BJ's and it's been good but this time it was not good."
Shane H.,"Oceanside, CA",71,115,112,3.0,9/15/2012,"My friend used to work here so I had a biased attitude before I came here for a birthday celebration. It wasn't as great as he built it up to be. Even knowing the pizza crusts were frozen and reheated and a lot of things in the kitchen were premade, you'd expect a place to have good food if they choose the frozen route LOL. The only things that were worth while were the ice cold mugs of root beer and the ""Pizookie."" It's basically a large cookie with ice cream on top drizzled with syrup. I'm pretty sure this is their calling haha. Stick to desserts, BJ's! I don't wanna be embarrassed saying, ""I'm having BJ's for dinner"" anymore."
Naline D.,"Carlsbad, CA",26,32,1,2.0,4/14/2014,"Waiters could use a good attitude adjustment. We had order a pepperoni and sausage pizza. 30 minutes later when it comes out they must have been mistaken BC they come out with sausage and tomato. When we tried to tell the server thats not what we order he replied with ""That's sausage and tomato, that's what you ordered, you could talk to your waiter"" completely cutting us off. 30 min later they replace our pizza with the correct one. checks took another 15 minutes. Service was horrible, but typically they have good service so it was kind of embarrassing with a group of 10+ family and friends there with us getting told ""you could talk with your waiter"""
Greg N.,"Redondo Beach, CA",66,284,12,4.0,7/12/2012,"This is our 2nd visit to this location and like the usual BJ's we go to, good food, good service, good times.  Good service tonight from our server, Haley. I like the fact that they now part the calorie count right in the menu, so you don't have to hunt it down and yet simultaneously...it does kinda bum you out when you see how many &$*#&$ calories are in everything.   I know, I know, you can't have it both ways and overall, I like having the calorie count right there to help me decide a bit more with my brain than purely on my stomach!"
Summer S.,"San Diego, CA",0,22,2,2.0,9/28/2014,"Great beer, the blonde is super yummy...food was greasy and we had to return the avocado rolls cause they looked so gross, like baby mush bleh! I've had better artichoke dip from Costco...the side salad was $ 3.25 and about 6 bites of lettuce with very little diced tomato, super disappointing...bathrooms are dark, dingy, and dirty...don't expect to touch up your makeup cause you can't see in the dim light!  Our waitress was nice is the best thing I can close with. 1st and last visit."
Jason C.,"San Diego, CA",0,10,,4.0,11/20/2013,"I go to bj's to get a deep dish pizza (buffalo chicken) and the ""blonde"" beer and the avocado rolls as an appetizer!  The service is good, it is just super packed on the weekends because of the games! The wait can be 45 to an hour if you hit the busy time!  As soon as you get inside you can hear how loud the place is! It is like walking into a bar, and you need to yell for the person next tp you to hear you! It is like that at many bjs restaurants!  Pricewize you need to plan at least 50 bucks for 2!  The staff is good and can handle traffic when seated, i dont ever recall being forgotten when seated by the server, they keep checking frequently!"
Deanna M.,"Oceanside, CA",49,33,11,2.0,6/12/2014,"Good food, excellent drinks...they lost my vote on service. Dad ordered salad with his meal and despite several reminders it never arrived. Then waiter refilled his water glass without paying attention and overfilled it causing mess all over table and our clothes. Then the manager brings over a beer and spills it on my mother and her food. Our bill was never compensated or discounted nor did we ask for it to be. Won't be back, the food didn't make up for the poor service."
Rhondi S.,"Encinitas, CA",139,564,1282,3.0,2/17/2013,Great pizzas and salads. Great bar with lots of tv's for catching up on sports.
Robert H.,"Denver, CO",164,634,1935,4.0,10/18/2010,"Food is delicious, service was on-point (speed and quality) and the desert was a good finisher. All of my visits at BJ's have been great and I plan on making a few trips back. I never waste my time ordering a ""non-pizza"" entree because I would rather go to a place that only serves such a thing. I don't visit a Brewhouse for Italian food. I started with a Calamari appetizer and to my surprise was very meaty unlike most places that go overboard on the bread. There was not a bite without a good chunk of squid. The sauce provided with the appetizer added some good variety in flavor and even had a little kick to it. I ordered a buffalo chicken pizza that came with some expected spice but proved for an interesting combination in a pizza. This pizza comes with some hickory-smoked BBQ sauce, red onions, seasoned tomatoes, cilantro and BBQ chicken breast. It works out nice if you are trying to change it up from the standard ""meat lovers"" or ""Hawaiian"" combinations. With my pizza I tried a sample of the Magnolia's Peach brew and had to order a pint. It's the craft brew flavor you're used to with a subtle flavor infused. It was NOT the run-of-the-mill ""Kool Aid"" style that's often served elsewhere. My wife ordered the Mediterranean pizza has a very soft initial flavor and rich aftertaste. This pizza come with grilled chicken, basil pesto, roasted garlic, Kalamata olives, sun-dried tomatoes, feta cheese and sliced peperoncinis. I had to snag a bite because it looked and smelt so good. What can I say about the Pizzookie? It's always amazing. I love white chocolate macadamia nut and vanilla ice cream. I need to buy those deep dish pans and try my own."
Walter M.,"Oceanside, CA",1865,1608,606,3.0,2/17/2011,"I've seen myself grow up through BJ's. When I saw introduced some 10 years ago I came for the pizza which is very good for out here, but nowhere near Chicago's mediocre pie shops. I loved their hand crafted root beer, but wished there was unlimited refills. I didn't really notice the service because I was young and I'd always go to the Laguna locations. I came of age and started drinking beer and loved their hand crafter micro brews, still the pizza was good and so was the root beer and I really got into trying most of their menu, now I started going to the Laguna locations and I still liked it a bunch. A few years later I'm back in SD and now I've been around long enough to know the difference between good and bad service, not just in waiting times. I love BJ's and often have business consults with new and prospective clients here and every time I keep noticing the service is like a thorn in my side. It's the same set up as other locations, but I can leave Oceanside and be seated with a cold beer in La Jolla than I can if I went to Oceanside. It's not their lack of help or space, but outside of the bar the wait times are 30-40% longer than any other BJ's I've been to regardless of time and season. I love it enough to keep coming due to convenience and good food, but it'll always be a step below Laguna's, Corona, Temecula, La Jolla, Cerrito's. Get your stuff together and lower your wait times and you go from 3 star to 5 star."
Alyssa K.,"Washington, DC",291,206,75,3.0,5/22/2012,"Dear BJs, not cool of you at all. Super lame. I mean, I still can't over how you played me like that. I get it.  I should have no expectations when I lower my standards and choose a chain like you but it was still pretty ridiculous of you to wait until I was sitting in my comfy booth drinking my delicious beer (the one thing you have going for you) and ordering food to tell me happy hour can only be enjoyed in the bar.  First of all, the booth I was in was on the other side of the booths in the bar....they were physically connected.  I could literally see people drinking the same beer but  for a $1 less and enjoying a pizza for half the price of the one we got.  I mean, way to kick me while I was down. Major fail for that even being a rule in the first place, but waiting to tell me like that is just playing dirty.  I wasn't about to be ""that girl"" who made her server transfer the drinks to the bar just to save a $1.  You shouldn't have put me in that position in the first place.  I especially didn't appreciate it because Mondays are hard enough as it is and Happy Hour is supposed to be that special time of the day that helps me get through the week.    Instead, I was left feeling guilty for eating that many calories of mediocre food AND paying full price.  Not cool at all.  Thanks for getting my week started off on the wrong foot."
