Andy K.,"Fallbrook, CA",0,8,,3.0,11/1/2014,"Selection is really good, as is the quality. Good beer selection. Don't get the chicken wings, though. Completely unimpressive. Over-cooked and hardly any sauce... and the sauce isn't very good. Staff is super friendly and accommodating. Would go again, but definitely ain't ordering the wings."
Gabe H.,"San Diego, CA",677,610,811,4.0,5/20/2010,"Had lunch here yesterday with the BF... yup, he drove all the way up to my office to have lunch with me.  He is seriously the best :-D This is the first time I've been to this new location.  I haven't been to BJ's in a while, I typically have gone to the one down in La Mesa.  I like the design of this place.  The high ceilings make it feel very open and big. I had tomato bisque and a ham and cheese sandwich.  They were featuring lunch specials that all ranged around $5-7.  I was very impressed with the number of offerings.  The employees were all very friendly and service was very quick.  Drinks were refilled quickly.  We were in and out in about 30 minutes which is HUGE when you are on a lunch break.  This will definitely be a lunch option in the future!"
Bob M.,"Vista, CA",0,9,,2.0,1/18/2015,"Have been here 3 times with family and friends, large and small groups. Food is good but service and wait times are not. Today was the worst.  It is a Sunday night and just 2 of us, had to wait 1 over hour after ordering and complain, which is out of character for us. We almost walked out because we didn't have that much time and were getting so frustrated.  Needless to say we had to wolf down our food and our after dinner plans had to be eliminated! Their pazookies are great but the wait can be ridiculously long and frustrating.  The service is pretty poor too, as you have to repeatedly ask and wait for little things like water or a drink refill.    If I were to rate today's experience I would only give it one star, but  averaging with the other times I had to be fairer.  The food IS good. Still, service and ridiculous wait times makes me rate it low star-wise... So disappointed :-("
Bill B.,"Sacramento, CA",0,4,,1.0,1/18/2015,"Mediocre food, horrible service. Took over an hour to serve a couple of kids meals. Avoid, avoid, avoid, avoid."
Maria P.,"Perry Hall, MD",6,79,1,5.0,10/23/2014,"First time here, I was underwhelmed. Second time here was a home run...ordered a beet and arugula salad along with their fried chicken/corn/mashed potato lunch special. Excellent, perfectly cooked chicken...it was delicious."
Theresa B.,"Brentwood, Los Angeles, CA",437,171,369,3.0,2/28/2014,"This BJ's seems to be fairly consistent with the others in the chain.  They have a large menu and the wood and leather interior is always inviting.  The service was decent here and they did not leave me sitting long before my order was taken and food served.  The food quality was exactly what I would expect from BJ's: consistent and good, nothing out of this world spectacular.  Bj's, you are still A-Ok with me!"
Chris F.,"Vista, CA",2,54,,4.0,11/19/2014,"Went with friend to watch a game.  Sat at the bar.  Great beer selection.  Appetizers were good.  Good service.  Some stuff a bit pricey.  Ordered a small pizza, was OK needed more sauce as it was dry.  Overall good experience with beer and appetizers"
dede o.,"Cypress, CA",33,18,,2.0,10/15/2015,"Took a party of 13 here on a Sunday for brunch, 2:00. We were told that the wait was 40 min. It was busy. Because the inside area is too small for many people, we had to sit outside. Not a problem except it was 95 degrees and humid; not fun. After 45 min, we asked when the time would be, and were told ""any minute"". After 60 minutes, we all decided to just stand inside and wait. We were told that they were waiting for two people to wrap up their visit. They had already paid and were sitting chatting, which was totally their right to do. The problem after more than an hour was some of our party had to leave. They do not have sufficient seating for large parties and rely on one main area with tables to be rearranged. I would not recommend bringing a large party. Then, we had to ask twice for water (remember a 60 minute wait in the heat). and the food took forever. 2 1/2 hours later we left. It was Meh. at best."
Imran K.,"Walnut, CA",3711,725,48,4.0,3/22/2012,I was taken for a Lunch to BJ I had the chicken salad I gave 4 stars is because when I asked for Olive oil as a dressing they did not have it. The salad was delicious and to drink I had the Arnold Palmer . Parking here is tight at Lunch time as the area is full of automotive dealerships. I had ordered the sesame seed chicken but I though I just got the plain chicken salad. The portion was enough to fill you up. The server was helpful and we were seated in the Bar.
Bryce H.,"Gilbert, AZ",2,9,,2.0,10/11/2015,"I've never been disappointed with BJ's until tonight. We sat at our table for 15 minutes before I had to go up to the host station and request for our server to come acknowledge us. Even after that, it was terribly slow. Several tables around us were seated after us and were paying before we even got our food. I was also disappointed that I saw the manager floating around checking on the tables and didn't seem to stop by ours at all so I did not bring the slow service to his attention. Don't see myself going back to this BJ's in Carlsbad anytime soon."
Timothy R.,"Lumberton, TX",6,46,4,2.0,5/3/2014,"The food is good. The service is alright. The food should not take over 40 minutes to come out, and that's just the appetizers. No food is coming out, and you look over and see 4-6 waiters/waitresses playing on their cell phones...twenty minutes after requesting the check, finally it shows...management fail."
Laresa M.,"Carlsbad, CA",49,10,2,5.0,10/6/2014,"Love BJs lunch specials. Johnny at the bar is so friendly and knows us by name and order. We like taking the kids here sometimes too. All around great place. Good food, drinks and service. The man likes the $4 lunch special beer. M-F only."
Charles S.,"Oceanside, CA",31,57,2,2.0,8/30/2012,"Last Saturday, my wife's family came down to visit and requested to go somewhere very nice for dinner. My first instinct was to make reservations at Pacific 333; however, when I called at 5pm they told me that 8 pm was the earliest I could get our party of 7 in. With relatives still on the road at an ETA of around 6:30 pm, I called BJ's and made a reservation for 7 at 7pm. When someone answered the phone with ""whats up"" I should have just hung up. I asked if she could take my reservation and she said ""yes"", and then started telling me about some call ahead policy that they have. Apparently, they will take your reservation but you must call ahead 30 min early? I told her we would be there at 7, and I did not want to call ahead. She said that would be fine. I was happy that I found a place to eat on a Saturday night with such a large party and at 6:30 we all loaded up and drove down to Carlsbad. When I got there the hostess informed me that because I did not call 30 min early, we would have to wait 30 min. As I stood there holding my 5 wk old baby's car seat, I could feel my wife's family's anger. ""Why didn't we just go to Pacific 333 if we were going to have to wait?"" Finally, they all insisted that I go speak with the manager.  As I started speaking with the hostess and manager I noticed that my reservation was in fact noted.... on a napkin! The manager told me it would be less than 5 minutes and we would have the next table. And we did.  Overall, the food was decent and the beer was good. The manager handled the situation well. I know they were busy and we were a difficult goup to handle, but I just have such an angry feeling towards the whole situation that 2 stars is all I can give. Also, everyone at the table that night also agreed that it was a 2 star joint. Maybe I can give more next time. Sorry BJ's..."
Sia P.,"San Francisco, CA",217,122,,1.0,4/22/2013,"Our waiter was awesome. This review has nothing to do with food or anything but it does have to do with the LOUSY HOSTESSES who answered the phone when I called in and even when we arrived. I'm hoping a hostess gets re-trained so that Bj's doesn't have to suffer this type of ""bad representation."" I called ahead because Bj's has a ""call ahead"" concept. I understand it's not fool proof and I get that but every Bj's HAS this & even promotes it with business cards at the front... including this bus. However, this particular Bj's....is a sham. or maybe it's just the misinformed hostess.   When I called....the silly hostess told me they didn't do ""Call Ahead"" at this time because they were too busy, the wait was an hour..It defeats the purpose of promoting ""calling ahead"" when you don't accept it at certain times.. I don't know why this irritated me but maybe it's because it just didn't make sense. I go to my local Bj's (in another area) almost 1-2 times per month, never have they refused call ahead. Ok, next mistake.. I asked about the 2 for $20 deal. Bj's glorious deal that makes me love them that much more when they come back with this offer every few months. She said they don't offer this either at this particular location. Even after I asked her ""are you sure about that because I saw it on the website.."" she quickly reassured me (without even confirming with anyone around her or a manager) that they don't do that at this particular Bj's.  If your nation-wide website says you have something & you ""supposedly don't"" then you're probably not up to the Bj's standard. =( Anyways, we arrive, put our names down and given a 20 minute wait time..(I wonder if this is still ""too busy"" for call ahead... ) Then their system crashes and they go around with pen & paper to make another waiting list. Accidents happen and working in the service industry myself I understand that technology sucks sometimes... However,  there are 3-4 hostesses, it took them a while to get their act together, no sign of management....and they finally seat us 45 minutes later. Even after all this, they didn't apologize once to us... Our waiter quickly rectified all mistakes aforementioned by saying that the deal was still on til the 29th and he was VERY CONFUSED as to why we were told otherwise. He went to the hostesses desk and actually ASKED them if they knew that we were doing this deal.  Anyways, he made it better and it was all good.  But i still wouldn't revisit this location. i hope management finds this review and does some serious phone etiquette training & conveys the message to all of its employees"
Jay R.,"Big Bear Lake, CA",47,143,91,5.0,8/31/2014,"The best BJ's around! There's a separate ""Take-Out"" desk and marked spots directly in front. They will come right out to the car. Serving take-out till 9PM and inside till midnight, this spot is quick and convenient even if you don't have the time to do the whole sit down."
Tara K.,"San Diego, CA",2,15,,4.0,8/1/2013,"I'm really glad I went back after our first time. Since then, we've loved pretty much everything we've ordered & had good service. We still try to go when we know it's not going to be busy because it does take awhile to get your food when it's busy (which is totally understandable but hard with kids!) LOVE their rewards program!"
Jonathan S.,"Millville, DE",15,64,6,5.0,7/10/2014,"Never had a bad meal or experience here until a few weeks ago. We checked in online about 40 minutes before we left the house. Our seat time was listed for 7pm. We arrived and were told that the wait was 20-30 minutes. No big deal the place was super packed. But as we waited we noticed more and more people that had arrived well after us were getting seated. We told the server, she said you are next. Well about 6 people got seated ""next:. Finally I flagged the manager down and he explained they were having issues with the online checkin. He seated us himself immediately and took care of us the rest of the night. Almost our entire meal was taken off the check. Was very pleased with the way they took care of the situation. oh and get the buffalo chicken pizza its amazing!!!"
Andy C.,"Carlsbad, CA",193,1233,3341,5.0,1/24/2010,"I can finally be public about my love for BJs. A new location has finally opened in the North County San Diego area located right across the street from the Carlsbad Premium Outlet Mall and Car Country Carlsbad. This location is one of two in the North County area. The second will be in at the Escondido North County Fair Mall, but that location is still under construction. I still can't believe it....2 BJs that I can have some easy access too!! My friends and I were sitting around the house one day when, I got a craving to have a pizookie. We knew of only one place to get our pizookies served to us. We got in the car, and pulled into. Three hungry men came into the place, and we wanted our needs met. First we decided that we couldn't get our pizookie's until we had dinner first. (You can't go to BJs and not get some treats before your dessert.) So we ordered a Cobb Salad, a Medium Spinach & Artichoke Pizza, and a bowl of Chili. The Cobb Salad is made to perfection. The chefs in the back put in chopped romaine and iceberg lettuce and is tossed in a creamy garlic dressing, which is super delicious. On top of the salad is roasted turkey, Applewood smoked bacon, feta cheese, tomatoes, avocado, and croutons. The Spinach and Artichoke PIzza was baked and delicious too! This wonderful deep dish pizza serves a good 3 people. This pizza is has a rich, creamy medley of spinach, artichoke hearts, cream cheese and mozzarella topped with a fresh tomato basil blend and Parmesan cheese. A MUST GET WHEN YOU COME HERE!!! The chili here is also delicious!!! Don't be surprised when you place this into your mouth and taste beer, because it is made with some ale. It's even in the name on the menu! The chili is made with select cuts of tender pork and beef, pinto beans and Piranha Pale Ale. The chili is topped with melted jack and cheddar cheeses, sour cream and green onions. Also, this can be served in a cup, bowl or a bread bowl. Lastly, you can't leave without getting a pizookie. A warm delicious cookie served in a pizza pan and freshly baked, hot out of the oven, rich and delicious cookie topped with two scoops of vanilla bean ice cream. You can also get your choice of Chocolate Chunk, White Chocolate Macadamia Nut, Peanut Butter or Oatmeal Raisin Walnut. This location has curb side pick-up, online ordering, and weekend brunch. If you ever want to come here and get a good serving from BJs, then call me cause you are never to old to get some BJs!!"
Angela C.,"Oceanside, CA",30,27,46,4.0,8/8/2014,Usually come here with the kids for the variety and so I don't have to worry about make kids not being absolutely silent. The service has not been that great they always forget things and I've had to ask several times. This last time we went we had a great server who didn't forget a thing and refilled all of our drinks several times without having to be asked. It really made it a nice experience
Brittany L.,"North Brunswick Township, NJ",184,400,18,4.0,10/3/2012,"This was a solid family dining experience.  A great selection of Italian foods and beers.  TVs all over a buzzing atmosphere and overall interesting space.  I'm really digging factory-esque places with a chandelier thrown in here and there.  Service was standard/friendly and as attentive as possible in the crowded restaurant.  I don't know who paid for dinner... but I the prices seemed fair for good food/portions.  Everyone ate up.  Felt like a glorified UNO's.  But judging by the people all there, it's a popular place in Carlsbad!"
