Josh H.,"Kansas City, MO",0,4,,1.0,12/30/2015,A reponse from management regarding their servers stealing credit cards would be great. However they seem more concerned with responding to the poor service complaint. Credit card theft is a crime and if managent doesnt repond to the actions of thier waiters then they are just as complicit
Joe S.,"Carlsbad, CA",4,7,,5.0,5/1/2014,Great food even better beer and good place to go for happy hour
Lost B.,"New York, NY",1,468,61,3.0,8/22/2014,"Pleasantly surprised by the pizza. It also passed the important test, it was good the next morning for breakfast as well.Ordered the veggie. Also we asked if they had garlic bread and if we could order a side. They said they had ""Pasta Bread ""So we said ok. The bread was more like a long thin brushetta type bread but it was really good. Seasoned in the middle and soft but the outer edges were crusty. We liked it."
Kris C.,"Mendota, IL",0,5,1,5.0,9/23/2015,"Was there to watch Monday night football. The two bartenders were great. Very attentive! It was a full bar and they were getting drinks for the waitresses as well. Both were friendly and worked well together. I ordered and ate at the bar. The ribs, artichokes, and mozzarella salad were all very good. Would definitely recommend and visit again"
Jessica C.,"Carlsbad, CA",59,121,33,5.0,11/10/2010,"11/6 - Our server Joy was just that. An absolute joy. We are just leaving from our Anniversary lunch and it was delicious.  The server was attentive and let us know it was happy hour which got us $2 off appetizers and 50% off any mini pizza. We had no trouble flagging her down and getting anything we needed.  My husband enjoyed his cream soda. I had a wonderfully refreshing Berry Burst Hard Cider.  Our appetizer, the Ahi Poke was phenomenal. The avocado was so creamy it was like an orgasm I'm my mouth when mixed with the tuna. The won-ton chips were perfectly seasoned and the tuna was firm and yet melted in your mouth.  I then tried the Gourmet Mac n Cheese. The flavor was fantastic. The chipotle spice and garlic was great and the bacon was super crisp, a wonderful balance to the very liquid sauce. Normally I like my Mac n cheese with a thicker sauce but this still gets an A in my book. I think the cheddar cracker crumbs on top won me over.  Then, we got two mini pizzas. The Southwest Chicken and the BJ's Favorite. They were absolutely fantastic. The dough was crispy on the outside, and tasted a lot like a Pizza Hut deep dish, but it was fantastic none the less. Both are excellent.  We also couldn't decide on which Pazookie to do, so we went with the Trio. Oreo was fantastic, I just wish they had put more of the 'cream' in with it. That was bomb! Peanut butter cookie was fantastic with real peanuts in it, and my favorite was the chocolate chip. It was still soft and gooey and I'm pretty sure there is a huge party in my tummy.  All this for $40.88. Pretty sweet deal if you ask me, and our meal took just about an hour. Little less. We sat at a booth in the bar.  BJ's is a-okay in my opinion and we will totally be going back.  Yum!"
FC F.,"Salt Lake City, UT",2,5,,1.0,1/1/2014,"Horrendous.  Lazy slow service, surly disagreeable bartender and the worst food service company food imaginable.  You could taste the corn syrup in the salad dressing.  Bison burger took 90 minutes -- and this was in a half empty restaurant.  For some reason a paper thin bison burger is extraordinarily difficult to cook"
Miggy F.,"Escondido, CA",0,211,51,3.0,8/2/2012,"Great pizza & beer, but worst nachos ever! Seriously WORST NACHOS EVER! Is open late, perfect for beer munchies. Service can be hit or miss. Moderately priced."
Mia D.,"San Marcos, CA",0,16,1,1.0,8/30/2013,"As soon as we sat down I noticed the drink menu and table had food all over it. Waited over 30 mins for our food. Asked for our salads to be brought out before our entrees. They came out with our food 30 minutes later.salmon was undercooked, pizza was cold and salad was swimming in balsamic dressing. We've been going here since it opened and I always say  lets give it another chance. They always mess up our order. Using lunch and dinner peak times-stay away. Long wait times and massive communication problems from front of the house to kitchen. There are better restaurants around the corner!"
Francisco E.,"East Elmhurst, NY",1,5,,2.0,9/14/2014,Appetizer Portions are small and bland.  Do not order the calamari!  Avoid watching any sporting events.  The restaurant avoids using speakers to its fullest potential.
Erik S.,"Carlsbad, CA",551,372,236,4.0,3/31/2010,"Who doesn't love...  (OK, that was too easy...) Anyway, especially for a big-ass chain restaurant, BJ's has the pizza down, as well as the beer.  Sometimes deep-dish pizza can be a gooey, sodden, oily mess at some places -- yet at BJ's, even with various nitrate'n'pork laden toppings I like on mine, the pizza's always been awesome.   Then there's the beer here.  I haven't ventured into BJ's private label stuff, but the selection of 30+ on tap, I found a few favorites. Franziskaner ... you and the rest of your drunken-monk clan are well represented. Right now, I could use  .... oh, never mind.  Again, too easy."
Sara H.,"Oceanside, CA",13,13,5,4.0,12/25/2013,"For the gluten-free pizza lover - say yes to the BJ's pizza... as long as you order in house. I am a part-time gluten free eater and adore BJ's personal pan, thin crust gluten free pizzas. But they have to be fresh from the oven. When you order them to go, they are stuffed into the box and into an oven until you arrive, leave and eat. It works, but the pizza dough keeps cooking and dries out... it still is good pizza, but not the amazing experience of fresh pizza. The gluten free pazuki is as gooey and delicious as the regular stuff.... but again with the not-as-take-out caveat."
Jon V.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,8,,3.0,8/2/2015,"Had a birthday dinner tonight for 16 teenage girls, 3 girls turning 17 this weekend. On the good side, the restaurant has a pretty nice feel. The two waiters helping us were very friendly and helpful for a large group. The deep dish pepperoni was tasty. The baby back ribs were tasty. The not so good: all the food was pretty much just warm or cold when it arrived; it was sitting too long in staging I guess. We'd asked for salads to arrive before our pizazz and ribs; it all came together. They're not efficient at clearing away the used plates and dishes...the table just stacked up with stuff."
Brittany R.,"Carlsbad, CA",105,91,74,3.0,1/15/2012,I actually love this place.. My fiance and I love u get drinks here and split a few things and the articoke dip is amazzziinngg.. The only thing is that I did curbside takeout last night and even though she repeated the order back to me our order was wrong and living in vista we were over driving back... I now know never to do takeout :(.. She recieved a large tip from us for screwing up the order.. Not cool -2 stars
David P.,"Vista, CA",0,5,1,3.0,10/25/2015,We went for a family birthday the ahi salad was great the spinach stuffed mushrooms were good service was a little slow... Nice place
Jan M.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,9,,3.0,5/23/2012,"I've been to BJ's (probably) 100 times as it's my son's favorite place.  I do like the wide variety of offerings...can't miss with the roast beef dip sandwich!  And their beer list is fabulous. But PLEASE, PLEASE, manager...can you STOP training your hostess to say ""My Pleasure"" instead of ""you're welcome?""  And, waiter, can we STOP asking if we've made our drink orders 30 seconds after the hostess has left?  We just SAT DOWN, for crying out loud!  Finally, waiter, STOP asking if we've ""made our (dinner) selection"" within 10 seconds of asking if we've made our drink selection 30 seconds after the hostess seated us???  Please, STOP.  I feel like I'm on the Pirates of the Carribean ride at Disneyland when I'm treated like this.  I don't blame the wait staff...I blame management for making robots of them. Thanks for allowing the rant.  Food is very, very good, but I would like to be able to settle in for several minutes before I'm asked about my dinner selection.  Sheesh!  I know I'm not alone."
Scott H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",2,32,,1.0,7/16/2014,"How can a pizza restaurant not have a mozzarella cheese pizza?   It's unbelievable all BJ's offers is a five cheese blend pizza.  What if you don't like the four other choices of cheese, ""oh well"" they said sorry.  Do not recommend BJ's for pizza."
Brittany K.,"Oceanside, CA",1,33,3,4.0,7/13/2014,My husband and I go here often we love it! Definitely try a pazoockie they are great! :)
April R.,"Oceanside, CA",492,979,200,3.0,6/18/2012,"BJ's is one of those chains that is actually pretty good.  They make some good house beers and have a fun mixed drink menu.  There menu is kinda like the cheesecake factory in that it is like a little book with tons of choices.  I have never had anything I didn't like.  My favorite thing is their french dip sandwich, they have it on garlic bread, yum!  Its kinda a bummer that there almost always seems to be a wait but it goes by pretty fast.  They service has always been pretty good as well."
Sabrine M.,"Fallbrook, CA",36,89,32,4.0,2/12/2012,"I've been to this BJ's numerous times and I've always had a good time. My favorite times have been with my hubby when we go to get some drinks and share the Mediterranean pizza, which, by the way, is DELICIOSO! It has pesto, chicken, feta cheese, and pepperoncinis... Ummm to die for!!!! I also LOVE their avocado egg rolls.... Which are AMAZING.  They have a great selection of their speciality beers, as well as margaritas, mojitos, sangria.... Etc.  They also have a light menu option, where some options include chicken pizza, and fish tacos. I've had both and have not been disappointed. They usually get busy, do if you're going on the weekend I suggest calling ahead of time.  I'll be back but in the mean time, I'll be dreaming about the Mediterranean pizza :)"
Eriko P.,"Santa Monica, CA",188,424,2582,5.0,12/4/2013,"Great service! I came here with my friend who is in a motorized scooter. I called ahead and the staff said it was no problem. I arrived and sure enough, we were seated immediately to a table that was wheelchair/scooter friendly. Big Carlos was our server and he was quite attentive. We were celebrating my birthday and I specifically asked for their watermelon, feta, arugula salad. Unfortunately, they didn't have any watermelon, so at first I was disappointed. Big Carlos worked wonders and managed to get watermelon from the full bar and had the chef make my favorite salad for me! Thank you Big Carlos! Next time I am down in Carlsbad, I will definitely return to BJs! On another note, I compared Yard House to BJs, and I actually prefer BJs! Better food presentation and tastier foods."
