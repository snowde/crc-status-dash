Humberto G.,"Vista, CA",288,496,720,5.0,1/10/2010,"This place is great for so many things.  Great for a date, hanging out with friends, or grabbing a beer.  It is really loud, especially the bar area, so if you are looking for something quiet, this probably isn't the place for you.  While it is a chain, this has to be one of my favorites. While I usually get the pizza, salad and pizookie, I strayed from the usual. I had a pulled pork sandwich, and she had the chicken fettuccine.  The sandwich came with an all red coleslaw, and it was light and refreshing.  Everything was great, as usual.  Finished it off with a pizookie. This was my third time here since it opened, and it the service has always been excellent.  Even if something goes wrong, they are quick to take care of it.   My beer reviews: Blonde - Slightly hoppy, but my girl said it was her favorite.  Hefeweizen: I have had better hefs, and was my least preferred of the four. Pale Ale: This one had a bite, and it went really well with the pulled pork.  My favorite of the four. Red: It was ok, I'll stick to the ale."
Rebecca H.,"San Diego, CA",0,12,,4.0,9/13/2014,The customer service was great.  I went here to celebrate a friends Birthday and had a fantastic time.
Steve P.,"Vista, CA",0,4,,5.0,9/9/2015,I'm a regular customers of Bjs Carlsbad. I had a problem with their mobile pay this last weekend. The bar manager Mike was very helpful with the problem but could not resolve it until it cleared at the bank. I called BJs customer service and it was the best customer service ever. I got passed between 4 people to get to the person who could help and each time the phone was answered straight away with no wait. They resolved my problem and credited my account straight away. If only all customer service was this responsive
Ryan B.,"Carlsbad, CA",14,77,3,3.0,1/22/2013,"Before I ever knew what a bre-pub was, I had BJ's. The beer selection to me at the time seemed huge, the food was unique and the atmosphere was exciting. A few years and gastropubs later this place does not hold up as well. What you do get here is a solid beer selection, a few good house brews (Hopstorm is the best they make) and solid food. The menu is massive and sometimes hard to navigate, but if you stick to pizza or small bites you will do fine. Service is solid. Ambiance solid. BJ's is solid, if nothing special."
Tommy D.,"San Diego, CA",78,146,9,3.0,6/4/2012,"Stopped by for dinner, had a pretty nice time...  It was Tuesday night, so not too loud or anything, which was nice for once. The service is usually slow from my experience and last night was no exception.  While the food isn't spectacular, it's good enough to keep me coming back for more (yes, especially that pizooki thing or whatever it's called).  And the music is usually a perfect selection.  Overall, good job guys! 5/30/12"
Hakan L.,"San Diego, CA",65,68,4,4.0,10/17/2013,"Love the beer! I'm a fan of any microbrewery and BJs deliver. The food selection is huge, the building is huge. I think this place wants to be like Cheesecake Factory, they get to 80%, the dishes are good, but not excellent. My family usually picks BJs when we're at the mall, it works for all of us, picky eaters, beer drinkers (yea that's me) and veggie-eating mom."
Mr. Anderson D.,"Oceanside, CA",49,91,69,2.0,8/1/2011,"The pizza is gross, just really gross. Before you Phhf at my review and think Im some troll, look at my review record and let me just say I can enjoy frozen pizzas  from Celeste and Stouffer's so that accounts for something. Im writing this in hopes management can take note and produce an eatable pizza, maybe take some cues from Uno's or something but the pizza I had that day was really bad...super salty, hardly any cheese or sauce, and crust that was soft/chewy in a weird way.  I live only about 5 miles away so I was so excited when they were opening up but my hopes and dreams were halted with that 1st bite. The good thing I can say is that the place is fantastic, big and sprawling, nice design and layout that creates and fun environment. And the staff are all very nice and hospitable who make you feel welcomed and appreciated. Isn't odd that it's always this way, you can never get both...bad food/good service or good food/bad service.  Im pretty sure the rest of the menu can't be that bad because you can tell the place has quality written all over it but it's the pizza...oh the horror."
Ryan S.,"Carlsbad, CA",4,4,3,3.0,5/3/2014,Nice decor and fun to have a new option in Carlsbad.  Have eaten here twice and completely underwhelmed both times. The food is greasy and it's really just a bunch of bar food in the end inside a nice atmosphere.  The front desk is chaotic when you come in and I had one hostess who was beyond rude but I'll cut them slack as it's still new.  Not bad for a quick bite but you'd be better served going to Pizza Port if you're looking for bar food in Carlsbad.
Todd N.,"Camp Pendleton North, CA",0,8,,2.0,8/22/2014,"Do you have beer flights? ""I don't know be right back"" 30 minutes later return anyhow we order food is all wrong..... desert all wrong..... from start to leave 4 1/2 hours that's do to horrible service and total shit of staff!!!!!"
Jessica R.,"Oceanside, CA",49,50,6,4.0,4/8/2012,Just came here tonight with my family for my Birthday dinner and I loved it! You can't beat BJ's pizookies they are what keeps me coming back and since I was there celebrating my birthday I got a free one!! It definitely made me happy! Our waitresses were excellent and made sure we were happy and content the whole time.  I ordered the chicken club sandwich and loved every bite! BJ's always has a fun atomsphere and it was definitely a good time. Will definitely be back!
Wendy M.,"Oceanside, CA",20,50,209,2.0,3/18/2014,"Great place for drink, but it's really tough finding spot. Food is overrated & over priced (I give it a 6 out of 10)  The building is nice, though."
Quyen S.,"San Diego, CA",39,19,8,4.0,10/3/2013,"Happy Hour after 10pm.  I am in!  Try the lemon drop, YUM!"
Jose S.,"Riverview, FL",9,42,36,5.0,1/6/2014,Please eat here. Service was amazing. Food and atmosphere is great. Ask for Tyler as your server and he will take care of you very well for the time there.
Cat L.,"Kailua, HI",32,32,2,4.0,4/3/2012,"I've been here several times and I've almost always left happy.  My favorites on the menu are the Gourmet Mac  & Cheese, the Wings, and the Chicken Parmigiana.   A word of warning to one of the steaks and the Black and Bleu burger, their bleu cheese is almost disgustingly sharp and unpleasant.  I don't drink beer but I got my father to go here and he loved all the different beers they had on tap that was the restaurants own crafts.  The only down sides to this restaurant is that  1) your waiter can be a hit or miss. Sometimes they're nice and other times they're rude.  2) I've had certain food items like the ribs, be out of stock, or whatever they call it, twice before. Both times, the waiter didn't come out and tell me till after waiting for 10 minutes. 3)The parking lot is somewhat tight and can get packed very easily. 4)It gets very loud in here and although they have maybe 10 flatscreens up in there, usually it's only sports and more than once, it was the same game on every single tv.  This place often gets packed throughout the day so I would call ahead, even if they don't take a reservation, it's good to be placed on their wait list."
May L.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,3,,2.0,7/24/2014,"The pizza is just ok.  This place is pretty busy on the weekends, so the wait can be quite long at times.  For the amount of time we had to wait, the pizza was not worth it.  It is tough when you have hungry kids and you have to wait such a long time.  We should have just ordered pizza to go."
Vivianne V.,"Vista, CA",347,333,834,4.0,8/3/2011,"The happy hour is worthy of a daily visit, with specials on single and ""shared"" appetizers.  For me an argument as to why I do not need to cook on a weekday night anyways.  We had a nice bottle of La Crema Pinot Noir which is normally $40 for $20 on last night.  Most the time the damage on the check is not the food but the alcohol, so we have a real appreciation for 1/2 of a bottle on Tuesday Night.  I had the Ahi Tuna Salad last night and it was delicious.  BJ's did not get ""chin chi"" on the Tuna, with flesh in each bite."
Jill P.,"Vista, CA",37,22,,4.0,8/8/2011,"I have been frequenting BJ's since I moved to California in 1987.  Back in the olden days, my family would have to travel an hour to Laguna Beach to enjoy the tasty goodness.  I'm not sure if it was the location (directly across from the beach), the saltwater smell that had soaked into the wood furnishings or the fact that we came from a small Midwestern town, but we thought BJ's was the best thing on Earth! Fast forward to present day and BJ's are popping up all over the place.  And now there is one 15 minutes away from me.   My mom and I had been out running errands yesterday and I suggested lunch here.  Their menu is now huge, a definite change from the days of only pizza, salad and garlic bread. And they brew their own beer too. If you want a refreshing beer on a hot, summer day, try the Jerry Burst.  It's a combination of their Jeremiah Red and the Berry Burst.  Actually, it doesn't need to be a hot, summer day for one to enjoy this, it works all year 'round.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  Too bad it's only 9:00 am.   They now have flatbread pizzas on their menu so we paired the Margherita Fresca with a wedge salad and had at...The wedge is a wedge, you can't really go wrong with it...although I will have to remember to order the dressing on the side next time.  The flatbread was great, the crust was perfectly crunchy.   Our server was friendly and on top of it.  As much as I wanted to indulge in their yumminess that is a pizookie, we decided against it.  I'm not going to the gym for nothing!  If you have never had one, might I suggest the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut?  Unless of course you have nut allergies.  Then stay far away.   My only problem is recently they started to place a separate menu on the table that had the calorie content in it...I always politely handed it back and said ""no thank you""...But now, the calorie content is listed right next to the menu item.  Ugh.  I'm sure some people like that, but I don't.  I will have to train my eyes to not look at it.  Oh the music!  I was a fan of every song I heard. There was a great mix of RHCP, The Who, Green Day, Cee Lo Green and Kim Carnes wafting throughout.  A little something for everyone. I may never get the same feeling I had when walking into BJ's in 1987, but that's ok.  The pizza is still the same."
Catherine V.,"Gilbert, AZ",101,1,,4.0,6/2/2015,We came here for pazookies and they were for sure over cooked but still really good! The waiter was AMAZING. He was so fun so thanks Fredrick for making our time there amazing! Chocolate chip pazookies are the best!
Stephanie G.,"Carlsbad, CA",19,71,1,1.0,8/19/2013,1000000000000 things on the menu and all of them SUCK. Stay away... I don't know how this place still has as many people coming thru the doors as they do. I will eat ramen noodles before coming here again. My second visit was just as bad as the first.
Rebecca B.,"San Diego, CA",2,35,1,2.0,7/16/2014,Horrible service and even worse food!! Asked for double steamed broccoli and it was served raw! When I sent it back they brought it back brown like the grilled it. Just disgusting!
