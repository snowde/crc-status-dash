Maryam H.,"Encinitas, CA",7,24,,5.0,11/22/2011,"I have been here a few times and every time I come I am pleased.  They have a huge food selection, no matter what you are in the mood for.  They have some great combo options for lunch ( not sure if they are available for dinner).  The wait staff is always helpful and friendly.  The only problem is that they get really busy during lunch so service takes a little bit longer.  Other than that this place is great.  They have tons of TVs if you are there to watch a game or just hang out at the bar.  Tons of drinks and drink specials."
Susan W.,"San Diego, CA",61,94,1,3.0,1/31/2012,"I've been to many different BJ's over the years and the food, while not mind-blowing, has always been consistently tasty.  Went to this specific BJ's, after running the Carlsbad. We didn't have a reservation and our group mushroomed from 7 to 9 to 14 people!  The manager was very accommodating and was able to get us all seated together with only about a 15-20 minute wait; it was after the Carlsbad half and full marathon, and it was the AFC and NFC championship games, so it was pretty packed.   Disclaimer: I've been known to get cranky when I'm hungry so you can imagine the feeling of uber-cranky after burning several hundreds of calories running a half, so take my complaint with a grain of salt if you want!  Our food took about 40 minutes to come out, which is a long time to be waiting at this type of restaurant.  Our waiter also never once said anything acknowledging the fact that our food was taking so long either, which I find annoying.  Also, our waiter was really slow with things like water refills...though interestingly, was always keen to find out if we wanted more beers! lol."
Chad R.,"New York, NY",230,463,8,3.0,2/19/2014,Kinda a nicer looking TGIF's with a great pizza cookie dessert.  Food and service is nothing special.  But go for the pizza cookie..its delicious
Zue W.,"Cathedral City, CA",33,210,737,5.0,5/1/2012,Love it here. Highly recommended everyone is very nice and they make sure to please your needs the food is scrumptious and made to perfection. This is also a family place to come to.
Humberto A.,"Oceanside, CA",29,24,26,1.0,3/30/2013,"They took an hour to sit us down. A friend came late and ordered his food last and got it first. And hour after we ordered the food did not come all at once. I was the last one to get my dinner. But the waitress came around and asked ""anyone else missing anything"" and I said ""I am"" thats when I knew they forgot my damn meal. IT WAS MY FIRST AND LAST TIME AT THIS CRAPPY RESTAURANT.  I DONT KNOW WHY MY FRIENDS ALL SAY ""BJS IS SO GOOD"" ITS NOT!!!"
Mandy H.,"San Clemente, CA",15,116,2,5.0,10/2/2013,"I've been to a bunch of BJs around SoCal and this one has to be one of the best. Great service, very kid-friendly and the food is awesome. Great for a casual family outing!"
Jessie A.,"Carlsbad, CA",2,26,6,5.0,8/16/2011,"It's really hard to find really good food and good micro-brew in one location. BJ Pizza has it! Happy Hour: Love it! Great Happy Hour prices, friendly crowd, good looking Waitresses too.  Having a bad day? Bring a credit card, meet new friends, and order a few Jeremiah Reds, then life will be good. Hint: Get there early before 5:00pm Dinner: Highly suggests : Avocado Rolls, Deep fried artichokes, Any deep dish pizza, and a Pizookie (of course) Major Plus: Kid Friendly I think I will go to BJ tonight. See ya there!"
Tara B.,"Fallbrook, CA",25,72,12,2.0,12/8/2013,Chain restaurant food with horrible service. The only thing good about this place anymore is the beer. I'm over it. We won't be returning again. Eat at a local non-chain restaurant if you want good food & good service. Lesson learned-again! Over priced Denny's style food with worse service:(
Dan C.,"Laguna Hills, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/10/2013,"I'm really disappointed in the service we received.  The restaurant was over crowded.  It's a good thing that we had made reservations.  Nevertheless, we were packed into the restaurant so tightly that the servers couldn't walk around the table or between tables to deliver food. After ordering, our food took about 45 minutes to arrive.  When our food arrived, 3 of the orders were wrong, and some of the orders didn't arrive for another 5 minutes.  The servers worked to correct the problem, but the errors from the kitchen just created more wasted time. When we brought the service issues to the manager's attention, all she said was that they had a lot of large parties that night; so sorry! We're never going back there.  We like the BJs in other locations, but noticed that they can't handle a lot of business."
Michael W.,"Oceanside, CA",3,22,,1.0,3/11/2014,I went on Saturday at 5:30. We waited about 15 or 20 minutes to be seated.  The service was poor.  It was an hour after we'd arrived before any food came.  One of the dishes came 20 minutes late so half of us were already done eating.  The manager did apologize for that at least.  The food was bland and not hot.  I won't go back to this place unless all the other restaurants in town burn down.
Arbi G.,"Glendale, CA",333,230,81,4.0,1/19/2014,"We brought the kids to Legoland today and decided to have our dinner close by before driving back. Very friendly staff, the host manager or maybe even the restaurant manager saw the size of our party and made sure that we got taken care of quickly. Our server was very nice and helpful even we so many kids she managed just fine. Great job and great service. Thank you BJ staff."
Tammy C.,"Encinitas, CA",222,64,,4.0,1/24/2012,"This place gets pretty busy throughout the day, but I haven't had to wait too long for a table. I like going to BJ's with a big group, because it's easier to share a pizza. The best deal they have is the 2 for $20 deal. This includes 2 bowls of soup or salad, a medium pizza (upgrade to large for about $3) and a pizookie of your choice! This deal easily feeds 3-4 people. The pizza here is the best, they have many flavors and you can get two different kinds on one pizza. My favorite part of the pizza is the thick crust. The reason BJ's is famous is for their pizookies, which are delicious oven baked cookies with ice cream on top. My favorite pizookie is the cookies and cream one! I only recommend going to BJ's with the 2 for $20 deal, because it can get pretty pricey without."
Joshua G.,"Goleta, CA",2,47,1,2.0,8/24/2014,"Went here on a Sunday night, around 7:30 with my wife and 4 kids for my oldest daughters birthday dinner.  We left at 9:45.  I have never had such slow service in my life.  I am even more frustrated that I needed to go to target to get supplies for our trip to legoland in the morning, and decided to do it after dinner since we had PLENTY of time.  What a mistake, as by the time we left BJ's, Target was minutes from closing and we wouldn't have made it.  Ok, so the service was so slow its more than just ""minus 1 star for slow service"" slow, it was minus 2 stars slow.  Every single table around us was seated and left TWICE before we did.  Ok so enough about slow service.  My wife got a steak medium rare, and it was cooked properly, which is something to commend for a place like this as most places in this genre overcook them.  The kids split a chicken breast with rice and veggies and a pepperoni pizza.  The chicken and rice were fine, and I snuck a slice of their pizza, and it was pretty decent.  On to my pizza, the Mediterranean, probably my own fault for trying to be not generic, but it was a DISASTER, probably the worst pizza I have ever had.  The my fingers still smell like the kalamata olives, they overpowered the entire thing, just every ingredient was sooo salty or pungent and just way over done.  I was expecting  the olives to be lightly used as a complimentary flavor, not covering every inch of it.  On to dessert, the pizokis were all not great, the cookie was just poor, underdone in some places and over in others.  Then came the insult of a $110 bill ... One last word, overpriced! Anyways, I would seriously reconsider ever going back here again.  So wishing I had tried Blaze across the street."
Elizabeth L.,"Clackamas, OR",38,71,194,5.0,11/17/2013,"The cheeseburger pizza is by far my favorite thing to order. The staff is always friendly, the drinks are always good, the portions are more than acceptable. The few down fall consist of how loud it can get inside, how busy it is/the wait time, and the amount of smokers outside. We have never gone and not been satisfied with our experience."
Stefanie I.,"Norman, OK",240,136,45,3.0,1/24/2011,"The pizza is where it's at! The potato wedges are also BOMBTASTIC.  The first time I went here there was a mix up with my order, I order a personal pizza and the waitress brought out a small pizza. I was rather confused and asked and she said they just must of made the wrong size. Then it was time for the check and she charged me for the small pizza. Which I only ate one slice of anyway, no one was sharing the pizza with me. So I asked her about it and she kind of got attitude and said I ordered a small telling me she was right and I was wrong.  So everyone at my table heard me say personal size, so the manager came and apologized and took care of the situation.  After that I did decide to go back on other occasions and the service has been good, the food is usually always good.  So, never let you're first bad experience be your only experience. BURGER UPDATE; On my journey to find the burger that knows the way to my heart I recently tried the Crispy Jalapeno burger at BJ's. To my heart dismay the burger that I thought sounded absolutely amazing turned on to lower my expectations of Bj's and makes me think they should just stick to pizza. The burger to begin with was very dry. I ordered it Medium/well. the meat did't taste of good quality. It tasted burnt a little bit, but it was cooked the way i wanted on the inside. Just maybe cooked to fast on the outside. There was maybe one jalapeno on the burger, and there was nothing crispy about it. So, my journey continues."
Cas S.,"Yorba Linda, CA",12,85,,2.0,1/24/2013,"Way way under staffed and a disgusting restroom. It took 1 1/2 hours for us to be served our food, only kids meals and salads, totally unbelievable. The restroom had an overflowing toilet that spilled disgusting water all over the entire bathroom, is this even legal? Next call, health department"
Crystal B.,"La Quinta, CA",70,49,3,4.0,11/17/2013,"This place is always busy, especially on the weekends but the servers do a good job keeping up with the hustle and bustle, just don't go here and expect to be in and out. The pizza is the best!"
April W.,"Oceanside, CA",72,293,116,4.0,6/13/2013,"Came in with a big party. Didn't have to wait long which is amazing. Big menu hard to decide what to choose. Food came quickly and was good. I took away a star, because the floor was so slippery and I had sneakers on. I would have hated to walk in there with heels on. Also it was pretty dark. But all, in all very good experience."
Kiley L.,"Carlsbad, CA",71,113,53,5.0,9/15/2013,"This is our go to restaurant if we are hungry and don't feel like cooking. The staff is great and so is the food. They have a really large menu with a lot of options so it will cover everyone in your party if you're all feeling like eating different things. The wait to get a table can be really long so if you can find a table at the bar section (first come, first serve) I suggest it. It's the same menu and if you're lucky enough to get Joy as your server, then you're in for a fab meal!"
Perpetua H.,"Carlsbad, San Diego, CA",172,27,10,1.0,5/10/2013,"This is the 2x I have been to this location. Went here for an early Mother's Day celebration today. Of course the night was busy. We were seated after 20-25 min of waiting. My daughter asked what kind of drinks do you have and the waitress, who name starts with a V, told her all the drink are on the first 3 pages of the menu...beer, wine and mixed drinks. Mind you my daughter is 17yrs and looks  13 yrs old. The adults at the table were shocked. During the night we only saw the waitress twice. I order the scampi pasta and it was so blain and tasted like it was box pasta. I think this will be my last trip there."
