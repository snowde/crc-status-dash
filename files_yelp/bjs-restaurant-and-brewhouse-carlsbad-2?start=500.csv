Dolce V.,"Garden Grove, CA",4,77,4,5.0,9/2/2013,"Bj's have always exceeded my expectations. I literally will try everything on the menu at least twice. Very relaxing place, friendly staff and always been a pleasant experience for me and my family. With all that said cant wait to go back"

Jennifer C.,"Vista, CA",14,25,2,4.0,1/21/2014,Their fried artichokes were delicious! Margaritas were good the rest of our food was okay nothing spectacular that will have me running back anytime soon. I did give this place 4 stars for the service. Lauren was our server and she did an awesome job. Very friendly and professional.
Edward W.,"Milton, GA",218,850,246,3.0,2/17/2011,"Decent flatbread pizza, two cheeses, sauce and sausage.  Consistently the same across all BJ's.  Always a comfortable place to have a casual bite.  What Friday's wishes it could be."
Euro C.,"Carlsbad, CA",14,79,7,2.0,9/1/2013,"The last 2 times we have been here the food ha been ok but the services was SLOW! Both times our server did not acknowledge the fact that we waited for over 30 minutes for our food. We have a toddler (1 1/2 yr old) and they didn't even make an effort to get her food out in a timely manner. The last time, we even got our food before the people seated next to us who looked like they had already been there quite a while when we came. Hubby says we will not be back."
Linda S.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,3,,4.0,4/6/2015,I had my 50th birthday party of 25 people.  Great service and they accommodated for all the different meals.  Their pizza is the best.
Chris P.,"Highlands Ranch, CO",44,66,7,2.0,6/23/2011,"I've been coming to BJ's for years so I didn't see how this one could get such bad ratings. Now I know. After waiting 45 minutes for our food, I'm thinking their service needs an overhaul. I got my favorite BBQ chicken salad, and never has it been so small!  BJ's why would you do this to me!  We had our wedding rehearsal dinner at your place!  I won't hold this against the whole chain. I'll be back, but not to this one."
Marina S.,"Burbank, CA",149,228,124,4.0,4/8/2011,"BJ's is hard to review because: a) they're EVERYWHERE - and it's hard to decide if you're going to review the service etc OR b) the food, which *should* be the same at every BJ's. I'll try and do both.  We came on our lunch break and for 3 of us we went all out and got a medium BBQ Pizza, a Chocolate Chunk Pizookie, and a BBQ Chicken Salad... yeah, I know, we kind of over BBQ'd ourselves.  Funny thing - we asked for all 3 things to be brought out together to make sure we'd get back to the office on time, and the Pizookie came out first! For those of you that have never had a PIZOOKIE (my friend had her first one this visit!!): It is a gooey ooey chocolatey cookie baked into a deep-dish pizza pan, with 2 huge servings of vanilla ice cream melting in the middle.  It is the perfect dessert to share, and as my husband always likes to say, you need to ""massage your veins afterward to keep your blood pumping - it's a heart attack waiting to happen!"" It's delish. They ended up accidentally making a large pizza, and gave it to us anyways, at the price of a Medium which was great.  I never WANT to go to BJ's because I prefer not to go to chains, and I prefer more ethnic varieties of foods when I eat out, but I have to say - BJ's NEVER DISAPPOINTS!"
Quinn W.,"Carlsbad, San Diego, CA",15,22,23,3.0,10/31/2013,"The deep dish pizza here is really good slightly pricey, but good none the less. The boneless wings were subpar especially for the price. Overall a great place to go grab good pizza and drinks. There's tons of TV's with a friendly staff."
Catherine H.,"Honolulu, HI",10,76,74,4.0,7/14/2013,"This place has excellent food, a huge menu and great service! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the music is extremely loud and it can be a bit annoying if you'd like to have a conversation with the person sitting across from you. Other than that, I highly recommend you give this place a try! (We can deal with the loud music because everything else is so good!)"
Natalie M.,"Carlsbad, CA",7,4,2,3.0,6/17/2014,"We set a reservation for 7:30, got there at 7:25 and they said it would be another 25 minutes. I thought the point of a reservation was to not wait for a seat? They called us 25 minutes later only to make us wait on the stairs for 5 minutes until the girl comes to tell us the computer froze and somehow ""seated us by mistake."" So to make a long story short, service sucks at the front. Our waitress was nice though! We were gonna order food but after a bad experience we just wanted to get our free pizookie and get outta there. 3 stars cuz the pizookie was tasty, the waitress was good, but the service at the front was awful."
Angela C.,"Mesa, AZ",402,430,265,4.0,6/15/2013,"Biiiiiiig portions! Food is always fresh and never seems to disappoint. On the slightly pricier side it's always a fun date night here! If you really wanna splurge, don;t forget to get toasty on one of their yummy girly cocktails!"
Dana F.,"Garden Grove, CA",13,10,,1.0,4/13/2013,"15 minute wait equals 35 minutes. We need silverware for a party of 5 got us 3 settings. Waitress no where  to be found after food delivered, getting cold and still needing 2 sets of silverware. Food was not up to the quality expected out of a BJs"
Carl R.,"Escondido, CA",19,70,53,1.0,12/20/2012,"Ok it is a busy night but the only good thing I had was the watermelon and feta salad.  Mini pizza: all bread no sauce, ahi tuna salad: fishy tasting and bad, chicken fried steak: awful no flavor.  Even the beer was bad!  It takes a lot for me to say even the beer was bad...stay away...I normally try a place twice before I declare it off limits...there is no way in heck I'm going back.  The place was full of people inside and a ton of people outside trying to get in.  It appears many people have no taste buds.  Sorry!"
Bony K.,"Encinitas, CA",80,491,64,4.0,5/20/2011,"If you're looking for a late night dinner spot, this might be worth checking. We've been here multiple times to have appetizers, pizza, their jambalaya. Large beer selection.  During their peak hours, do expect to wait, but you can call 1/2 an hour a head to be on their wait list.  No reservations accepted. Service consistently nice."
Austin C.,"Oceanside, CA",14,11,1,4.0,9/26/2013,"I always enjoy coming to this place, the food is good no matter what I get and their micro-brews are quite good as well. Their service at this location has always been good as well."
Anna A.,"Irvine, CA",27,29,,2.0,11/11/2013,"Ordered a salmon dish that came with a side of veggies. I actually asked the waiter to tell the chef that he had done a really good job with the fish, and a really bad job with the side vegetables! If I pay  full price for a meal, I expect to be able to eat all of it, and not just the meat and throw out the rest."
Suzanne F.,"Newark, CA",29,12,,1.0,3/7/2013,"Went there with friends....they cant even make a baked potato with Alfredo Sauce taste good! The Alfredo sauce came from a JAR! No taste...come on now cant your "" COOKS"" add some garlic to this and some cheese to make it look and taste like ALFREDO SAUCE! They had terrible service here and the wait was just so long. I will never go to ANY BJ'S restaurant and have a meal...I will head to the bar for a beer because you cant screw that up!"
