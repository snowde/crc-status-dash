Desi V.,"Oceanside, CA",81,299,45,1.0,2/24/2011,Food is alright and it is  a great place to meet up with friends for a drink or two but the service at this location (and others that I have been to) SUCK! that's all!
Jo S.,"San Francisco, CA",9,212,,3.0,3/2/2013,"The pizzas and pizolis (I probably spelled that wrong, but it's the dessert pizza) are delicious and I love their Tatonka stout.  Their margaritas could use salt and their wait staff is stretched a little thin for a restaurant of this size...and we always seem to get a waiter or waitress that overshares and gives us a feeling of guilt for troubling them.  Other than that, a Carlsbad favorite for pizza."
Ryan-Sum Dum Gai- S.,"San Marcos, CA",39,335,170,4.0,6/11/2013,Good pizza and a wide variety of menu options (think Cheesecake Factory).  Beware gets very crowded on weekends and evenings.
Greg T.,"San Dimas, CA",303,13,,4.0,8/27/2013,"Bjs everywhere are great places to eat. I would give this one a 5 star, but its just a bit too small of a place. The other Bj's I go to in Covina is 4 times larger, and has a nicer ambiance. Still great food."
Tom R.,"San Diego, CA",0,45,,5.0,12/31/2014,Eat lunch here 2 times a month. The food and lunch specials are great. Soup and salad all you can eat is awesome and Lauren is the best waitress ever.
W T.,"Silver Spring, MD",2,15,,5.0,10/10/2011,"I personally thought the pizza was pretty good. And that's coming from someone from Maryland, and we've got Ledo's over here. I'm just kidding... Honestly, I'm not sure why some people are slamming the pizza. Maybe they just had a bad cook that night. If there's one thing I'd pick on it's the noise level. But it's a bar, so it's to be expected. Besides the word ""brewhouse"" is in the name, so I'm not going to take off a star. Then again they haven't opened up a BJ's on the east coast, so maybe I should take off one star..."
Dan M.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,119,2,3.0,12/12/2012,Great beer.  We shared a calzone which was good but would have Ben excellent had the sausage not Ben cold.  We have been to BJ's many times and this is the first time a portion of  our food has been cold.
Anthony W.,"Murrieta, CA",92,406,27,2.0,5/21/2013,"Came here to get some lunch and I was REALLY disappointed. I've been to other BJ's with good results. I ordered the buffalo burger with coleslaw and my girlfriend ordered a breakfast scramble. 1st, they ran out of breakfast potatoes and offered wedge cut fries (this made me realize that they don't make their potato products fresh). When they delivered my meal, the coleslaw was dry as a bone. I looked at it like....WTF am I going to do with some dry cabbage pieces. The waiter proceeds to tell me that they ran out of the sauce AFTER I had to ask him what's up with the dry coleslaw. Overall the food was bland and I doubt I'll return to this location. I'll just stick to pizza (at another location) since I'm assuming that's their specialty."
Kelly T.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,1,,3.0,2/10/2015,"I always love the atmosphere . But I had the beef sliders and they tasted exactly like the 79 cent cheeseburger at McDonalds . Definitely needs an upgrade on the meat product . Wish I had gone to Sammy""s for their Kobe beef sliders !!!! Service was good , but felt a little rushed to pay ."
Dan H.,"Carlsbad, CA",283,37,4,5.0,7/24/2012,"Ok so those of you who have read my past blogs no how critical I am about restraunts and places I visit. I have nothing bad to say about his place. we went there one night for dinner and I was shocked and blown away. I have never ever had service like what i received here. I have been to fine dining places and never have been treated as i was treated here. Jennifer was our waitress and she was on it. I thought it and without asking she delivered. I could not believe it. The food was great I had ordered ahi salad and a pizza. The ahi salad was crispy and the ahi had a great taste. The pizza had just the right amount of sauce and toppings on it. The dough was crispy but not hard and not too chewy in the middle. i would get down to 1/3 of my drink and before I could look up to find Jennifer she was already on her way over to fill my drink. I have gone places (not going to mention any names....Jays Gormet)  that i had waited 20 minutes to get a water. I was so impressed by this waitress I asked her to send her manager over. She looked at me so puzzled, didnt argue just went and got him. When they both came back, she started walking away I stopped her and asked her to come back. She looked so stressed. I started telling the manager how impressed I was and this is by far the best service I have ever received. I continued on and on (so did the rest of my party) by the time we were done she was smiling from ear to ear. We left her a 50% tip.  Here is the bad news.... Jennifer's last night was that night we visited. We have not been back since then. I think it because i had such a great experience the last visit I dont want to ruin it. I will visit again sometime later, but for right now I will just hold on to the memory LOL!!!"
Steve C.,"Encinitas, CA",114,212,44,2.0,8/6/2010,"I'm lowering my rating for BJ's in Carlsbad because the last lunch we had there had many mistakes.  It seemed clear the kitchen staff was out of control and not properly supervised.  They made just about every mistake you could make.  Portions of the ticket were delivered and other portions forgotten.  Some food items tasted like they dumped the entire salt jar into the soup and two salads were swimming in dressing.  Forks came to the table dirty.  Some items came to table cold.  Several of these mistakes were repeated. BJ's has always been a good place to go, but I think the staff has current problems.   Someone at BJ's needs to get control of this situation. Today a business associate told me he had a similar experience last week."
Rayan B.,"Escondido, CA",86,38,4,4.0,7/3/2010,"Pros: Great tasting Pizza, decent service Cons: Their way of making you wait was a turn off It's a Friday night and fairly obvious that whatever restaurant we visit will be pretty packed.  We called in at 8:20pm on a Friday night to seat a party of 3 (and definitely expected it to be busy, like usual).  The guy over the phone told me it's a 45 minute wait; however, he did mention calling in advance cuts the time down to 15 minutes.  Perfect!  We're right next door! After getting there 10 minutes later, they told me it'll be another 10 minutes.  Ok, that sounds about right... but it turns out we waited 45 minutes instead!  Not sure if that's their strategy to get us in the door... it did work, but it did irritate us just a bit.  We were talking about possibly eating some place else since we knew it would be a while til we got our pizza anyway, but we stuck with the plans and proceeded to our table. The service from then on was outstanding.  Our server was able to get our drinks quickly and take our order.  I got a little skeptical about the Bacon Cheeseburger Pizza, but take my word: you'll love it!  We didn't get our food til 40 minutes later (but time goes by when you have good buddies tagging along!) We were done and finished with our food by 10:40pm... so definitely expect your dining experience to be roughly 2 hours by the time you walk into the door.  Just grab a beer and have a good time with your pals, and you'll be fine with this place :)"
Tommy C.,"Carlsbad, CA",99,6,3,5.0,9/2/2012,Great place to go get a great beer and some deep dish pizza! Amazing happy hour! $1 off beer and half of mini deep dish pizzas! Love the atmosphere and great staff!
Kristen H.,"Lake Forest, CA",132,21,29,2.0,8/17/2013,"I love BJ's, but I was disappointed in my visit. I met my friend and her son right at 11 am when the restaurant opened. Despite and empty restaurant, the hostess walked me and my two small kids to the furthest booth. It took awhile for the waiter to come by and ask for our drink order. We had also asked for a booster seat, which also took along time."
Scott T.,"San Diego, CA",0,4,,2.0,1/18/2015,"Really BJs, you aren't a sports bar?   Why all the TVs?  Watching the NFC championship game and we can't have sound!   Food is decent and beer selection is good.  Manager totally unresponsive when multiple clients ask for sound.  Too bad.  Don't come here if you want to watch sports."
Jeff A.,"Carlsbad, CA",9,5,,1.0,10/21/2012,"Went tonight to have dinner and had a horrible experience.  Ten of us and not one person had their order correct.  Soup came after the entree, wedge salad was wilted and tasted like it was washed in hot water, kids slider was dry and tasted like cardboard (exact words from a 7 yr old!), one entree never came, the adult burger tasted like it was made last week.  I can go on and on......  Manager came to the table, when asked,  and was apologetic but the aloof server never once apologized.  I was impressed when the manager said we were not going to pay for anything and even offered dessert, but when we got up to leave the server handed us bills for the drinks.  Was is really worth comping the food to get my $11.74 for drinks?  From beginning to end the experience was not one I ever want to revisit, and the restaurant I won't."
Steve S.,"Carlsbad, CA",1,116,1,2.0,11/21/2014,The ice tea is good but other then that the food is two star at best.  been here on several occasions order a variety of items off the menu and everything is just OK.  The positive is the location.  Covenant to many places and a decent hangout.  Other than hen that I try to avoid coming here if I can
Joseph H.,"San Diego, CA",48,144,24,3.0,9/29/2013,"Good solid place to go when you have a group that all want something different. The menu is massive. I got their salmon and my wife got a deep dish pizza. Both were very good. The salmon had a good sauce, but the veggies it came with were just steamed with no seasoning, so those could have been better. My wife's pizza was good, it was deep dish, but not with an inch deep of artery clogging cheese, so mad props to doing a good, but not deathly deep dish. Over all there is nothing that makes BJ's stand out other than its massive menu. The food is good, but not great, staff was nice, and the restaurant was clean."
Kent B.,"Carlsbad, CA",345,227,435,3.0,4/22/2010,"I ordered a pot roast sandwich. It sounded very yummy and I liked the idea of a pot roast w/ all the fixings but in glorious sandwich form, who wouldn't, right??? Houston we had a problem!! Instead of getting the sandwich they served me the the dinner.  What's the difference you ask?  About 7 bucks and no bread.  So, I felt compelled to let the waitress (very nice) know I ordered the ""sandwich"" and could i just have the ""sandwich"" price. Instead of getting the discount they let me eat the dinner and served the the ""sandwich"" meal too! I was so excited to see the pot roast ""sandwich"" in all it's glory.....but seriously it's the same meal with bread next to it. Also, the replacement meal came with raw vegetables which was kinda interesting next to the piping hot roast.  OK, whatever MISSION ACCOMPLISHED the GLORIOUS BREAD!!!  Until I learned later the bread (crazy stale) took a tiny bread time machine 'from the distant past' and jumped on my plate...it was VERY unwelcomed!  Stale bread and raw veggies... Anyway, do yourself a favor, if you go there don't order the pot roast meal just get the ""sandwich"" without bread!  Other stuff-awesome 5 story HDTV, nice HUGE bar with lots of choices and it's not TGI FRIDAYS."
Deanna M.,"Carlsbad, CA",3,52,21,3.0,7/19/2013,"I really want to like this BJ's more but unfortunately, I have had better experiences at other locations versus this one. This location is so close to my home that it pains me that it disappoints a lot. The food is mediocre sometimes, whereas other times it is delicious. I think it depends on the cook that prepares your food unfortunately. I hate the inconsistency. BUT the service and drinks are decent enough to go back. You just have to know it's not going to be the best foodie experience around."
