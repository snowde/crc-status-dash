Mel B.,"San Diego, CA",64,34,24,1.0,9/18/2010,"We have been to the location in Escondido several times and have always had good experiences.  We were looking for a specific item at the premium outlet mall and decided to go to BJ's for a belated birthday dinner for my husband. We arrived at 4:30 and there was no wait to be seated.  We went inside with our two small children and sat and waited.  And waited.  And waited.  And waited.   We tried to make eye contact with several servers but they were all too absorbed with chatting or singing or whatever else they were doing to even walk by.  After over 20 minutes of waiting and waiting and waiting my husband said they had 5 minutes or we were leaving.  5 minutes passed and then we packed up the children and prepared to leave.  At that moment a server came by and asked if we had been helped.  We said no.  He apologized and asked if he could get us anything.  At this point my husband said no and explained that we had been waiting for close to 30 minutes and we were done. You need to realize that when my husband makes up his mind, he makes it up for good.  He holds his grudges near to his heart and doesn't let them go easily.  And when he says he will not be going back to an establishment, he means it.  The waiter offered to get us a manager but after 30 minutes it was just too much.  We walked out hungry and thirsty.  We didn't even have as much as a glass of water to drink.  A manager followed us to our car but after an experience that bad it's just too little too late.  I'm actually quite sad - we had great experiences in Escondido but my husband is beyond stubborn so I guess I need to cross this off my list of favorite places to eat."
Trever F.,"Hartford, CT",750,287,28,4.0,4/13/2012,"This is my wife's favorite Restaurant. I like it, I think they have some pretty good craft beers and the food is pretty slamming as well. I find it a little pricey for me, but not terrible, I'm just really cheap.  It is a nice place to just have a beer that is well made eat a pretty decent meal and hang with some friends. This place does get really busy and crowded, so if your in a hurry, I would try another place."
Lynn H.,"Carlsbad, CA",698,220,30,3.0,6/5/2012,"Good service from a rather stiff server, not well versed on the menu or cocktails, but took good care to check back often.  It's hard to be okay with the corporate choices, the bottom line seems to be SKIMPY.  My wedge had about a dime sized portion of bacon chopped up, not even a generous amount of onions, yes the manager was in agreement and fixed the problem.  Entree came with about a tablespoon of gravy, yes they were kind enough to bring more, about 3 tablespoons upon request.  Stick with the beer they have an unbelievable selection of Belgium Beers."
Paul S.,"Encinitas, CA",0,6,,4.0,2/7/2015,"Food is always excellent, great beer. Big open seating area so you don't feel like the table next to you hears all of your conversation. Pizza is phenomenal and our server (Started with an A) was very pleasant. Will come back soon for the pizza and beer! Great place to bring my family as well. The kids menu is great and has a good variety."
Arline K.,"Vista, CA",3,93,7,4.0,8/13/2010,"We've eaten there twice.  The noise is LOUD, be prepared.  The wait is always.  We'll call ahead next time, as suggested, and see if that works.  First time, the food was very disappointing.  I ordered chick. fried steak.  Came with mashed potatoes and gravy and veggies.  The portion was ridiculous, easily enough for 2-3 people and I'm a big eater.  But, the taste was terrible.  Firstly, it was SOOOO overcooked, they should be ashamed.  Overcooked by 5-6 min., in my opinion.  Came out dark brown and hard as a rock.  Extremely salty, too.  DH had shrimp over pasta (don't remember which particular one).  Tons of pasta, very little shrimp portion and greatly under-sauced.  We weren't going to go back.   But, we decided to try once more, always noticing so many cars in the parking lot.  I felt like eating the pot roast but being a large chain, I suspected it might be ""brought in"" and not made fresh.  I asked the waiter and he was very honest and admitted that yes, it WAS brought in (probably in plastic bags is my guess - MANY dishes at large chain restaurants commonly receive pre-cooked dishes from their distributor).  So, that was a definite no.  My eye caught a panko-crusted chicken breast dish seasoned with parmesan cheese and basil and sun dried tomatoes, along with cheddar mashed.  It mentioned that the breast cutlets were hand pounded and that sounded like something that would be made fresh to order.  I specifically requested that it NOT be overcooked like my previous dinner had been and that it look ""just like the picture on the menu"".  DH ordered chicken breast over fettucine alfredo.  We waited quite a while, enduring the noise. Finally the food was brought to the table and my dish looked picture perfect!  And ... it was delicious!  I was soooo pleased with this dinner; it was well prepared, everything was hot and fresh-tasting & the chicken was cooked perfectly!!!  The mashed potatoes were fabulous and the broccoli was just typical - could have used a little butter instead of being just steamed.  This is definitely a ""go to"" dinner that I will order again.  My DH liked his dish - the chicken breast was very moist, but the pasta was a little too thick &  narrow and slightly a little too undercooked - needed another 30 seconds.  He definitely would order MY dish on our next visit, he said. Yes, service is slow - the place is just too big; they probably need more servers or cooks - one or the other.  Had to wait again for the check. But food was very tasty and the pricing of around $12-something each was very fair.  I'm glad we tried it a second time.  We will return."
Bonnie G.,"Escondido, CA",977,950,2861,4.0,7/14/2010,Reasonably priced lunch options.  Good option by the outlets.  I enjoyed my pizza with pineapple and a small salad.  Service was fine.  Austin seemed REALLY happy to be a server! :)
Julia C.,"San Diego, CA",277,131,46,5.0,1/2/2013,"My go to items at BJ's are: buffalo chicken wings on the bone, sweet pig pizza and Jeremiah Red. Can't go wrong w/  those items. I think BJ's has the best chicken wings out there!"
Rebecca T.,"Oceanside, CA",40,3,,4.0,10/31/2012,"I have been coming here for a few years & have always left happy. When I am craving some comfort food I get the open faced Pot Roast sandwich....So super delicious! Open seating at the bar area makes it easy to get a table. Good beer, good food."

Mark D.,"San Diego, CA",18,50,1,4.0,3/11/2011,"I know this is a chain restaurant and you pretty much get what you expect here, however, I had a great experience here at the Carlsbad location. The building is pretty new so it's all shiny and pretty. And our server was really friendly. Turns out she's from the Pacific Northwest...I knew she couldn't be a socal girl, she was too sweet. :)  I was really impressed with the gluten-free pizza. I scarfed the WHOLE thing down.  Now if only they could make a gluten-free pazooki!!"
Zia B.,"Corona, CA",282,269,9,4.0,6/3/2012,The food here is delicious. I had the stuffed mushrooms and the pulled pork sandwich and it was super yummy. Service was good too!
Andy H.,"Vista, CA",302,431,93,3.0,3/23/2010,"I dont know about this place...  GOODS: pizookie - as a lactose-intolerant person, i enjoyed the decadence of the warm cookie with the ice-cream. deep dish pizza - the crust is yummy and pretty filling. yes on the expensive side but definitely good calamari - I did enjoy the light calamari so I would definitely recommend that appetizer. NEGATIVES:  chicken fried steak - I found the coating to be a bit on the peppery side. It was slightly overwhelming.  service - i found it not only to be slow but i hate that i kept on having to ask for water refills. And my screwdriver took forever to get to me. No bueno."
Rick D.,"Windham, NH",119,238,143,4.0,7/8/2010,"OK, so I haven't been to BJ's since I was in high school. Back then, the only one around was in La Jolla Village Square. My wife had never been, so after a day at Legoland, we decided to grab some dinner at their new Carlsbad location. It was a Wednesday night and the place was PACKED at 7:30. The menu is pretty extensive and full of lots of choices. We ended up placing our order to go. I was trying to decide between the Spinach and Artichoke pizza and the Mediterranean. I opted for the Mediterranean and it was OK. I'm not a huge feta and Kalamata olive fan I found out. Not BJ's fault at all. My wife likes to keep an eye on her empty carbs so she got the Flatbread Margherita pizza. It's a shareable appetizer and was plenty for her to share. That was a great pizza. I also got the fresh mozzarella and tomato bite size salad. It was quite good and was the perfect size for a small salad. The service was great and the food good too."
Hula R.,"San Diego, CA",1124,291,60,5.0,5/2/2010,"MMMMMM...PAZOOKIE! This is a brand new BJ's in Carlsbad and is a great one to check out!  The customer service is really top notch and the food is great!  I had the broccoli and cheddar soup is really good and you definitely need to get it in a bread bowl!!  And of course, you got to get yourself a Pazookie!  If you don't know what it is, YOU NEED to get one and experience it for yourself!   **Some words of advice, if you plan to eat much here during the week, get there before noon otherwise, you might have to wait awhile!"
Alexander K.,"Goose Creek, SC",60,53,35,4.0,11/19/2012,Came here with a party of three. No wait at all. Food was excellent. Service was to par
Sharon W.,"San Diego, CA",0,10,,5.0,12/3/2014,"We had a great lunch, food was served quickly and the service was great.  Our waiter, Carlos, had to be one of the friendliest waiters and very efficient!"
Julie S.,"Carlsbad, CA",6,29,20,2.0,7/27/2010,"The location is good and the restaurant is large, open and clean.  The problem is, and I've given them three chances, they are extremely slow even after you get a table.  It should be a great place if you have kids, but it's not because they become so antsy from the waiting.  There is not a long wait at the door; the long wait starts once you sit down.  The service is slow and the food is slow; even, getting the check is slow! The food is good.  If you have plenty of time to wait, you won't be disappointed with the food.  If you don't like waiting, then by the time you get the food you can't enjoy it."
R S.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",0,35,,1.0,7/7/2013,Salad was wilted and service was awful. I paid in cash and server must have assumed I didn't care about coins. She just pocketed the spare change. It is obvious they don't care about the customer experience as most are visitors from out of town. Won't repeat.
Taylor R.,"Carlsbad, CA",12,22,8,5.0,1/8/2013,"Bjs is one of my all time favorite restaurants. I'm so happy over the fact that they also added thin crust pizza to their menu, it is definitely worth a try. So yummy. And who could complain about the delicious pizzokie! The servers here aren't always the best(often lacking in personality and just go through the motions) but the food definitely makes up for it!"
Rachel C.,"Duarte, CA",13,51,1,1.0,1/1/2013,We stopped in after a legoland visit starved. Food did not meet our hunger - calamari appetizer was saugy. Avocado egg rolls were just ok--- a little on the greesy side cheese cakes are 100 times better. Chicken fettachini was bland and dry. Needed sauce. The buffalo wings were also dry and served cold. The only thing we liked was the bowl of clam chowder.
