Jodi G.,"Encinitas, CA",214,10,5,4.0,6/18/2011,"Delish! love it! fun atmosphere, great drinks :) I love the kids options, they get many choices and a lot of food for a good price.  They also have great tofu substitutions"
Elizabeth M.,"Vista, CA",0,14,,4.0,5/6/2014,"Chose BJ's for our company Christmas party in December 2013. I had no problem making a reservation for a group of twenty on a Friday night. On the night of the party the restaurant was completely full, but our table was ready and we were seated right away. The first round of drinks took a little longer than it should to arrive. However the staff picked up the pace and rest of the evening was great. Fun atmosphere, good food and a friendly staff."
Karen M.,"San Diego, CA",0,1,,5.0,11/11/2014,"Took my WW2-era mom to BJs for her Veteran's Day lunch.  The service was prompt & polite and my mom really enjoyed her fried chicken & gravy meal.  Thank you, BJs, for your kindness to veterans -- much appreciated!"
A L.,"Oceanside, CA",142,53,44,3.0,11/11/2010,"Driving up, I was in awe of how enormous the building is. It looks like the size of a 3 level department store. The parking lot was equally large and packed. There were very few spots available and for a Monday night, that was surprising. The restaurant was one large room broken down into a bar, and then the dining area separated by booths. It was filled to the brim with eager diners. There was even a wait. Again, this was surprising for me because we have been to so many restaurants on a Monday night and we have never had any trouble with reserving a table, parking (well, at Tomiko it was pretty bad), and finding a spot at the bar. Only time will tell if they can keep that up. We both ordered a BJ's brew. She started with the Pumpkin Ale and I started with the Jeremiah Red. I haven't had a red in years, but this brew was very enjoyable, smooth not bitter. ( Maybe in the years to come, I can become more of a beer connoisseur, but for now, please deal with my lay-mans terms of the taste and quality that I experienced. ) The Pumpkin Ale was perfect for this time of year. It had the perfect amount of flavor that instead of overpowering the light ale, complimented it nicely. One of the kind gentlemen who gave up his seat for us ordered some Calamari off of the appetizer menu. After a brief conversation about The bUZZ, he was eager to let me try a bite. He didn't know who he was messing with. I normally love Calamari. I was under the impression that you couldn't screw it up. Boy was I wrong. The one and only bite that was taken was pure oil. I saw the tiny, little squid, but there was no taste of it. . . anywhere. Yes, I made this opinion known and saw the man quickly return the plate of ""food"". After apologizing for ruining his meal, he agreed that yes, I had done that, but my comments were true. There was no denying the overpowering taste of oil. He moved onto the Chicken Wraps, which turned out to be much better. If you've been to P.F. Changs, you won't be disappointed with what BJ's offers. Surrounding the bowl of chicken was the lettuce, a thin mustard sauce, as well as sauce mainly used with soy sauce. Very neat looking and made for easy eating. We were all happy I liked it. Right around 7, my handy ""table is ready"" vibrator went off. That is when we met up with the rest of the gals. The restaurant was still pretty busy and loud, but not enough to bother us. It was lively and fun and got us all in the mood to try some of their special brews, spinach dip, salad, and a large pizza. It ended up being the perfect amount of food. One of the gals noticed the nutritional guide. Our waiter was quick to find out that it was missing a crucial piece of information: the serving size. He was kind enough to go find us that necessary tid-bit before we ordered the very creamy spinach dip. It turns out that the entire dip has 492 calories, minus the chips. It was good, just not as good as mine. While we were waiting for the rest of our meal, we ordered the beer sampler. Here are some of my quick thoughts:  The Blonde - more flavor than a corona, yet still very light. The Pitagna Pale Ale - Very smooth with a grapefruit flavor - much like a Stella The Jeremiah Red - This is the one the table gravitated to the most. Very smooth for a darker beer. The Brewnette - coffee like, strong Tatonka Stout - This is the Guiness-like beer. We all HATED it. The Pumpkin Ale - We all loved the spice and agreed it was only for the holiday season. Please forgive my notes and my memory as I left out any comment on the pizza that night. I do remember it was a deep dish and that everyone else was ""Mmmmming"" and I was like ""eh"". You would think that would pretty much round up our evening, but for 3 of us it wasn't over until 2 days later. I don't know if it was the side of the table we were sitting on or the way we looked at each other. But for us lucky 3, we woke up with severe stomach pains that couldn't let us get over the night before. It's very strange how only half of the group got sick, but it happened. I'm not going to say it was the food or the beer, but what else could it have been?"
Shawn H.,"Vista, CA",51,76,20,3.0,9/13/2012,"BJ's is a good chain restaurant if your looking for a decent beer selection, to hang with a large group, or a work lunch place. The menu is huge and can sometimes be exhausting to work through. Once you decide on a dish, the food is decent and edible. I wouldn't say that you get an extraordinary experience at BJ's - but I don't expect anyone would come here with hopes of something special."
L K.,"Redington Shores, FL",7,45,11,5.0,12/6/2012,"One of our favs.  Tomato bisque and caesar salad are yum. :-)  The spicy spaghetti is our absolute favorite entree.  We add chicken and request extra sauce.  BTW:  I can't do anything ""too"" spicy, but this sauce is just right."
Ashley B.,"Baltimore, MD",12,38,5,4.0,3/6/2011,"Great Foood! Wild berry Moitio Was AWESOME!! Service was fast, Great burgers and desert is amazing! Definitely would go again!"
Annalee S.,"Vista, CA",5,9,,3.0,4/30/2010,"I came to BJ's for my dear friend's 1st 29th Birthday Party! They have a wide array of food from deep dish pizzas, pastas, sandwiches, stuffed potatoes, salads, and burgers and who can forget my favorite part of every meal DESSERT, my biggest weakness! Plus, they offer a good selection of beer and mixed spirits.=)  Atmosphere is good but a bit on the loud side and the service was pretty good considering there were 20 people at my friend's party. Having been here before, I ordered the California Chicken Sandwich for the second time knowing it was delicious the first time around. Its basically grilled chicken breast with green chiles, pepper jack cheese, ranch dressing, chipotle mayonaise, and fresh avocados on sourdough bread with a side of wedge cut seasoned fries. The chicken was a bit overcooked and dry to the point it should've been called the California ""Blackened"" Chicken and the bread was pretty soggy. Well the bottom part of the bread anyway.   I usually order the famous Pizookie which is a baked cookie (varieties range from Peanut Butter, White Chocolate Macadamia Nut, Chocolate Chunk and the list goes on) topped with vanilla ice cream.  After my friend told me how many calories there are in one, I passed.   =(1100 calories to be exact!!!!!  Luckily, my friend had birthday cake so it somewhat made up for the lovely Pizookie I could've had but maybe next time I'll try a different entree and share the Pizookie.=) Any takers?"
Eric L.,"San Diego, CA",1,17,,4.0,3/21/2014,Great pizza. Order the p'zookie! Be sure to order when your food arrives because it takes some time to make. Great family restaurant.
Honey P.,"Vista, CA",114,140,69,3.0,6/20/2010,"Came here for late night beer and appetizers. What I had: - ""Nit Wit"" seasonal beer, light and crisp - Ahi Poke, fresh and tasty - Mini Bruschetta, cilantro sauce was good - Kettle Chips, generous portion was not bad for 3 bucks Not a bad spot to hit up after the outlets nearby have closed for the night."
Kc S.,"Carlsbad, CA",12,118,,3.0,12/30/2010,"I've been here at least 5 times since it opened last year and I know I'll be back.  The service has gotten a little better since it opened, but anytime after 6 you will be waiting for a table, and it's way worse on the weekend. Go during lunch or happy hour to save a little money.  The reasons I go back are because my kids love it, the pizza is good, and that pizooki is addicting! It is loud, it is always crowded, and it is a chain.  Some of the non pizza items are pretty marginal, so stick to what they're known for, the pizza."
June M.,"San Diego, CA",88,58,6,4.0,11/19/2009,One word: PIZOOKIE. That's all you need to know. Or eat. Ever. EVER.
Holly S.,"Cincinnati, OH",56,256,269,4.0,9/18/2012,"I have eaten at two of these restaurants in one week's time... Carlsbad and La Jolla/UTC area near the Veteran's Hospital. Great food and service and value. ""Upgrade"" their Party For Two from a medium-sized pizza to a large size pizza for a few bucks more and you'll have enough pizza leftovers for another two-person meal."
Vuitton P.,"San Diego, CA",5,132,6,5.0,11/18/2012,"I love BJ's. it's very relaxed place to be. You could enjoy food, have a good conversation with friends or family, or just watch sports on tv. Serves are very fast and they care. They would treat you like you deserve."
Devery M.,"Oceanside, CA",4,11,,2.0,2/6/2010,"It's not that the restaurant was terrible, it's just that for the price, I expect a bit more.  It was very crowded with about a thirty minute wait for an outside table on a Friday night.  Perhaps next time, we could get our silverware first, instead of after the appetizer AND entree have arrived.  It was a hard place to eat anywhere close to vegan.  For an appetizer, we split the thai shrimp lettuce wraps (husband got double shrimp).  Carnivore ordered the ribs and said they were pretty good.  I ordered the personal veggie pizza and got a crazy look from the waiter when I said no cheese.  Um, it was okay.  A few steps up from frozen pizza, but not as good as most delivery.  Aren't they a pizza place?  Beer was ok.  I also tried the cider - whoa was it sweet! Basically, if you want great pizza and really unique locally brewed beers, just go to Pizza Port."
R F.,"San Marcos, CA",3,47,,1.0,5/7/2010,"I normally love BJ's, but this last experience left it tarnished. I won't go into too much detail, but hear me on this. Beware of waitresses that take it upon themselves to ADD A TIP TO YOUR CREDIT CARD SLIP and when brought to the attention of their Management...they did not resolve the matter as smoothly as they should have."
Wallee S.,"Chula Vista, CA",408,6,5,5.0,3/16/2013,"In classic BJ's fashion, this place holds up to it's reputation as a upscale fun family pizza joint. One of the best BJ's in San Deigo."
Jeanae K.,"San Diego, CA",1,35,6,5.0,11/19/2009,"The pizookies are goodd! lol if its your ""birthday"" you get one for free! 5 stars ONLY for the pizookie....not B.J.s  the food is blahh but they have good service..."
Glenn C.,"Vista, CA",64,120,216,5.0,1/23/2012,"Five stars...lofty I know, but hear me out! BJ's has a winning combination that simply cannot be ignored.  Its lacks that home town, eclectic feel that so many, including myself cherish.  Its not super high end or dirty cruddy.  Its just right.  BJ's is the kind of place that caters well and respectfully to a family as well as making it a grown ups paradise to watch the game or other significant sporting event on the HUGE screens.  If you are looking for a frat party you need not apply, SoCal is replete with that type of establishment and this one is NOT one of them.  I do not have a family but I enjoyed watching the playoffs with my wife over their delicious spinach and artichoke dip.  The food is always hot and delicious.  I favor the specialty calzone for two just don't forget to ask for a little extra marinara.  They have a decent selection of micro brews that make for an interesting and fun evening with some friends while you watch the game.  The Ahi poke is also great and they do not skimp on the ahi so wifee loves to get the poke... Happy hours that are worth the time and effort are not as common as they used to be but this is one of them.  Worth the time to check out the happy hour hour specials.  I enjoyed 1/2 off select bottles of wine on one evening and some shared appetizers as well!  Bottom line is if you are a mature adult that still enjoys a good time and doesn't mind a few little ones around then this place is awesome for its atmosphere, decor, food, service and BEER!!!"
Bryson B.,"San Diego County, CA",64,32,,5.0,12/3/2012,"What can I say I love me some BJS...well that sounded wrong but What everrrrr. So Lemme say that I am a huge beer conisur especially IPA's and stouts. AND BJ'S HAS AN AMAZING CONCEPT, they pair there 9% Tankea stout with their Hop Storm 7% IPA.....amazing amazing take on a traditiional Black and Tan. All their beers however are quite tasty. Now on to the food first their house dressing (garlic) is a big favorite with my girlfriend, I however am huge bleu cheese fan...that is the only place BJ's fails me...however its all good because their Caesar Dressing is out of this world. Next my favorite dish the buffalo chicken pizza AMAZING soo good. And of course you cant go to BJ's without indulging in a Pazookie, they were indeed created by Jesus christ him self."
