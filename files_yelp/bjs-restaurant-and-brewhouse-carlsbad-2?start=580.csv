Christi P.,"Carlsbad, CA",19,219,,5.0,12/15/2009,"We had reservations for 5pm on a Friday.  We were seated immediately.  Our waitress was new, but had someone shadowing her, who answered all questions.  Service was fast and attentive.  The food was all great.  It's been awhile so I am trying to remember what all was ordered- LOL!  Mediteranean Pizza- Yum-O! BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich-D-Lish! The BEST part of BJ's is...hold for drumroll.....THE BEER!! WOOHOO! All four of us ordered a 7 taste sampler.  The waitress looked at us with large eyes and said FOUR??!!!  We were all sure we would each like our own.  When she returned with the first 2 of 4 samplers we understood her look of confusion when we ordered FOUR.  I don't think ""sampler or taste"" is a proper description. I think a more honest approach is you will be getting 7 HALF BEERS HOLY COW.   Beer ""tasting"" was fun.   This place filled up really fast, I would not recommend going without a reservation.  When we left there were tons of people outside.  We will definitely go back.  I think our next visit will be a weekend lunch.  Welcome to Carlsbad BJ's!"
Anna D.,"Chicago, IL",78,147,24,4.0,12/26/2009,"First and foremost, I usually don't review chain restaurants.  I always feel there are enough reviews of them and I feel I can add more value reviewing the small businesses.  However, every now and then, I'll encounter an establishment that is deserving of a few comments.   I was debating whether to give this place 4 or 5 stars.  I have no complaints about this place and the food/beer were good, but I'm a tough grader and even tougher on chains, so here you go...I am in deed, a fan.     They brew their own beer at this place and I'm sure you'll find a favorite in one of them.  They have a 4 taste sampler under $6 and a 7 sampler for $10.  We tried the four taste sampler: - Bavarian Hefeweizen (fruity, spicy and refreshing), it was my favorite.  - American Piranha Pale Ale  - Irish Strong Ale - Imperial Stout (sweet, bitter roasted, and complex taste), goes well with Ribs. Food: The calamari appetizer was delicious!!!  It was one of my favorite calamaris I've had and I ALWAYS get the calamari everywhere I go.  They have great batter, making the skin crispy while the calamari had a soft, crunch to it.  For our main meal, we had the cajun pasta ($1.00 off  if you get the lunch special, plus they throw in a soup or salad for you).  The California burger was delicious but wished they would have cooked to order (they didn't ask).  Their menu is as large as a Cheesecake Factory menu.  Their drinks menu alone runs at least 4-5 pages.  Enjoy reading!    Overall, we had great customer service.  We went on a Saturday afternoon and decided to sit in the bar area (which also has booths) and did not need to wait long.  We give it an A on every level.  Next time you need some grub while shopping at the Carlsbad outlet, be sure to make a stop here."
Gavin M.,"Carlsbad, CA",50,26,2,3.0,9/17/2012,Last night I had the chicken tortilla soup and it was pretty good but it also was very salty
Tracy H.,"Fallbrook, CA",657,360,225,3.0,2/27/2010,"They seriously need to figure out the long a$$ wait situation. There's plenty of tables available, yet the waits are always at least an hour. Food is typical BJs... not bad, not great. But the pizookies are awesome. The waitresses havent gotten any better since they opened... more trainng maybe?"
Helen W.,"Murrieta, CA",1,375,4,4.0,8/27/2012,"Came here for dinner.  The jambalaya was excellent, loaded with shrimp, sausages and chicken and not overly saucy with just enough spice.  The sirloin steak was cooked close to well and had a nice char flavor.  The beers were excellent, we both got one of the lighter beers.   The mozzerella stick appetizer was plenty and the batter was crispy.  The fried portobello mushrooms were overcooked and dry.  It would have been better if the slices were thicker so more of the juice is retained inside the mushroom.  Overall, a nice place to come and not overly expensive."
Corey W.,"Carlsbad, CA",19,80,2,5.0,10/5/2012,The bbq chicken pizza alone makes this place worth 5 stars.  I also like the bbq chicken salad.  These are my two go to's.  Nobody else can do bbq chicken pizza like they can.
Allison P.,"Newport Beach, CA",164,221,59,4.0,4/11/2012,"My BF and I enjoyed an evening here with his family to celebrate his sisters birthday (Jessica R., check out her review also). Jessica and I were excited to eat here, specifically for the pizookie, Yum! The pizookie isa freshly baked cookie, topped with ice cream and served in its own deep dish.  The cookies they have are Chocolate Chunk, White Chocolate Macadamia Nut, Peanut Butter or Oatmeal Raisin Walnut, Red Velvet, Cookies 'N Cream or Triple Chocolate. The ice creams are vanilla and chocolate. I am absolutely positutely sure that any combination of cookie and ice cream is ridiculously good! In case you're wondering, yes I did eat my dinner first.  I had the grilled chicken club sandwich with wedgie fries.  The sandwich was good, great value with fresh ingredients.  I did only eat half of the sandwich, in hopes of having dessert.  The other half was still good when I toasted and ate it the next day for lunch. Service from our two waiters was ok. I say just ok because I had asked the female waitress for more hot water, she forgot so I asked the guy for more hot water and a take-out box. He brought the hot water but forgot the box. I then asked the lady for a box and she brought it. Other than that, everything was good."
Alissa K.,"Carlsbad, CA",18,119,15,3.0,11/15/2011,"Only really worth coming here during Happy Hour, when the prices are within a reasonable range. Usually very busy - often have to wait, even for the bar. Wait staff is hit or miss."
Rachel S.,"Brisbane, Australia",305,192,253,2.0,3/22/2012,"I feel like the concept of this place is more appreciated than the food and service. Yes, the bar is trendy and open til 1am on some nights and the building is huge with high ceilings and decorated walls, but the food is just average and the service is nothing special. I went to BJ's to celebrate Valentines day with my boyfriend, I ordered a pasta dish which was supposed to come in a creamy marinara/alfredo sauce, sounds good but I can't have dairy so I asked for just plain marinara and even explained that I really can't have dairy and the waitress seemed confident that they could help me out with that.  Of course, my pasta comes out, in a creamy orange sauce. I didn't eat until the waitress came back and I showed her my pasta, she first said ""Are you sure this is creamy?"" and then she was like ""Oh yea it is, sorry about that"" and took it back for me which was nice.  Honestly the wait wasn't worth it, the pasta was average and I could make it at home, overcooked noodles are my specialty. My boyfriend did love the Jumbalaya he ordered though! Also, we ordered the Chicken Lettuce Wraps as an appetizer, which were VERY good, but we paid about $10 for a TINY bowl of the chicken which barely fed just the two of us. More recently, my family and I came to BJ's to show our relatives from out-of-town what this place was like (they love Cheesecake factory so this was the closest thing to it). The service was HORRIBLE. There were 8 of us and each couple ordered an appetizer, so we had about 6 appetizers ordered, the appetizers came out right when the main courses did which left us with literally no room and confusion on what to eat. We let the waiter know that we were not happy with that, so the manager came to our table and told us we didn't have to pay for the appetizers, which was really nice! One of the main courses, didn't come out at all, so my poor grandma had to sit and wait for her fish and chips to make their way to the table. When the bill came, we were charged automatically for the gratuity because we had 8 people, which they didn't deserve. My brother-in-law wanted to pay for his meal seperately which was fine, but when they brought him his reciept, they over-charged him by $6 AND charged him the automatic gratuity! Which made no sense because he was paying for only his meal and my sisters, which equals 2 people BJ's! TWO!!  We left pretty unhappy, my dad swears he'll never go there again. I will, because I LOVE the Pizookie's, but that's about it :)"
Danny S.,"Oceanside, CA",16,12,11,3.0,6/17/2012,"The food is good. The beer is good. The appetizers are good. The service can sometimes be a drag. Stay on top of your waiters or you're likely to get pissed. If tht happens, you better get yourself a Pizzookie. That will bring you back."
Christie R.,"San Diego, CA",83,144,18,4.0,1/4/2010,"EVERYBODY LOVES A BJ ! Especially-My Little Cousin. He decided he wanted to go to BJ's for his Birthday dinner. Our waitress was totally cute/nerdy & knew about her beer. We had a table of 12 & she worked it. I ordered 1 Pomegranate Margarita, Avocado rolls, & a Pizza. I was buzzin' & in the mood. The only part that bummed me out... The floors are so slippery. Otherwise, My night was fantastic. Let's just say the BJ party didn't stop."
Codey L.,"Oceanside, CA",0,4,,1.0,3/10/2011,"Couldn't tell you how the food is we never made it that far! We called ahead and were told it would be 35 minutes for outside seating.. Arrived 20 minutes later and were told it would be an additional 30 minutes... Okay, 15 minutes more than the call ahead time frame.. No biggie.. An hour passed (with call ahead - total wait time - 1 hr 20 minutes) and we went to check on our table and were told it would be another 30 minutes... The whole time we waited we counted 5 tables outside, that would have accommodated us easily that sat empty the entire time! So, we left - and found Gregorios in Carlsbad! That place is beyond AWESOME!"
Jenny H.,"Oceanside, CA",3,31,2,5.0,6/11/2012,"Pizza is really good here. I've had the BBQ Chicken, Ham and Pineapple, and the Mediterranean Pizza.  (All soooo good) I've also been here during lunch, and they have awesome specials; You get a lot of food for a good price.  Love the Pazookies too. Oh! They also make their own root beer, and it rocks!"
Parris B.,"Carlsbad, CA",15,115,11,3.0,3/16/2010,"I love their deep dish pizza.  Floor could've been swept and the tables could be slightly cleaner in this pizza palace. I ordered the Mac 'n Cheese Snack and the Classic Deep Dish.  The mac and cheese had a sophisticated taste and was topped with bread crumbs for a good texture lift.  Bacon bits were dispersed throughout the dish and it only cost 3 or 4 bucks. The pie crust was slightly flaky, with buttery overtones.  It was topped with pepperoni, sausage, mushroom, and chunks of tomato, and I was in heaven. The kids menu is very reasonably priced, my little boy loved the pizza as well and my older son enjoyed his grilled cheese.  Kid's desserts were priced at .95 for a sundae and 1.95 for a pizookie. The missus ordered the flatbread pizza.  The thin crusted pie (prosciutto and artichoke?) was a bit rich for her and she could only eat 2 small pieces. We ordered the apple crisp and root beer float for dessert.  The apple crisp wasn't too crisp, I usually like a nice butter and brown sugar crust, but it seemed to be dominated by oats.  The root beer float was delicious, as all root beer floats are.  BJ's has a custom brewed root beer. The wait was 10 minutes at 5 pm on Sunday evening, and it only got worse as the hours passed.  This restaurant gets a lot of traffic and I would avoid it at peak hours.  My beer took about 12 minutes to be served because they ran out of glasses. I expected the restaurant to be cleaner.  Underneath our table were remnants from the day: pepperoni, corners of sugar packets, crumbs.  The lamp shade at our table was covered with dust.  I'm not O.C.D., but it did detract from my dining experience. The decor is upscale and I was impressed by the number of tv's in this sports bar type place."
Jennifer P.,"Oceanside, CA",14,16,,4.0,10/30/2012,"This is one of my new favorite places!! I LOVED the Watermelon and Feta Salad!  Also, the Roast Beef Sandwich was heaven!!"
Todd W.,"San Diego, CA",3,248,4,4.0,3/13/2012,Not bad at all for a chain. I have been here quite a few times for happy hour and would recommend it. They have the reverse happy hour that starts at 9 and you can get one of there deep dish mini pizza for 5$. I don't care for the beer that they brew however the guest beer is quite extensive.
Trishia S.,"Vista, CA",58,25,21,2.0,3/29/2012,"Food is on the same par as TGIF, although menu items are more interesting, quality is sub par. The only great thing is their huge TVs that show 4 different channels at the same time so you can cover a lot of games without missing anything."
Bob K.,"San Diego, CA",1,114,1,2.0,6/15/2010,"Here for a business lunch it was my first time at a BJ's Brewhouse. It was quite busy at noon time but we were quickly seated. The menus had a good selection tasty sounding selections at a acceptable price. The interior brick decor was reminiscent of an old brewery and well laid out with plenty of space between tables. There were large screen televisions strategically spaced throughout the dining area and there was classic rock playing, at a reasonable level, in the background.  I feel obligated to comment on the linen(?) napkins... they provided these, quite nice looking, blue cloth napkins. Though I can't say for sure what they are made from, but my guess is tent canvas. Those suckers were rough and stiff! I've used mechanic rags that were MUCH more pliable then those provided. Regrettably, they didn't have any paper napkins as back-ups. Our group ordered two large deep-dish pizzas, the Great White, and a made-to-order sausage & pepperoni. About 10 minutes after ordering the waitress came back and told us that they were all out of the Alfredo sauce used in the Great White and we would have to reorder. Out at 12:30 in the afternoon during a prime meal time? Not good.  With regret we reordered the Southwestern pizza. Because of the time gap in our order/re-order we didn't get both pizzas at the same time. We had the first pizza gone well before the second one arrived. The sausage & pepperoni was pretty good and I found the Southwestern boring. The waitress came back pretty regular to refill the glasses of those drinking ice tea (we all had to go back to work) but she didn't once ask if I'd like my water refilled. The restroom was large and cleaner than most restaurant bathrooms. Overall, the pizza was acceptable but nothing to get excited about and the unavailability of menu items sure didn't help. I would not have to be dragged back, but then again, I could think of many other places I would recommend first should anyone ask."
Mellani M.,"San Diego, CA",60,28,14,4.0,3/28/2010,"Place was great. Beside the waitress messing up on our appetizer but she was honest and upfront and got the order I'm real quick and we had it before our lunch in no time. She was polite and her service performance was top notch. The food was great , husband ANSI had the shrimp lettuce wrap as a starter. He had chilli cheese burger and i had chicken pasta. Made well to our likings!! Definitly going to bake"
Byron B.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,19,,1.0,1/17/2011,"Not a fan of waiting in line anywhere, let alone a Tuesday at lunch.  But the place was relatively new. Not a fan of corporate restaurants.  The servers are trained to greet you with the same spiel about their appetizers and beers (upselling).  It goes something like this ""Hi, my name is (blank) and welcome to (BJ's, Chili's, Applebees, etc etc.)  Can I interest you in a (blank) or a freshly (blank).""  You know the routine.  It's so forced and just not very genuine.  Then there is the food, which obviously is better than anything I can make at home, but still very similar to any other corporate restaurant.  They all buy their food from the same food distributors (U.S. Foods or Cisco) so everything ends up tasting relatively similar.  By the time you get the bill, you'll wish you had just gone to Jack in the Box (better burgers and fries for half the price) Do yourself a favor, stay away from corporate restaurants.  Chains are fine, but these large corporations are just so monotonous and trite."
