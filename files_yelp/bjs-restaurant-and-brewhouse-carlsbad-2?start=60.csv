Cynthia T.,"Murrieta, CA",73,342,101,4.0,12/31/2015,"Love this location. It's clean and the food and service is always on point. My recommended dishes are: Parmesan Crusted Chicken, Atlantic Salmon, Deep dishes pizzas, wedge salad, southwestern egg rolls, pazookies, and if you're craving a budget friendly steak, the ribeye.  So tonight I had the ribeye. Not bad for a non steakhouse place. Nice thick cut and not too chewy. Not marbled, but still had a good taste. I added a dash of salt, but didn't mind because I rather it be under seasoned and not over seasoned and salty. Asked for medium rare and got medium, which is ok too. I always order more on the rare side because it can always get cooked more if too rare. Can't undo over cooked steak.  I highly recommend signing up for their rewards programs. The points add up the conversion rate is excellent! Example 100 points is a free pazookie or $5 off! Easily done in 2 visits!"
Junior M.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,31,12,1.0,11/6/2017,11/6/17 after a long shift at work wanted to take some pizza for my kids. Tried plaCing an order on the phone for about 20-25 minutes. Kept getting plaCed on hold and transferred baCk and forth. So i decided to walk in. There's 2 girls standing in the take out booth ones on the phone an the other is on the Computer (brown hair with glasses). The one that was on the Computer finishes up so i tell her that i been trying to place an order for the last 20 minutes. Right away shes got an attidue body language and tone of voice. I asked her about the specials and shes just bitChy looks like she doesnt want to be there! She's rude all around. Hello the Customers pay youre bills lady! Been going to that bjs probably longer then shes been working there. If you dont like youre job QUITTTTTTT its that simple if you are having issues leave them at the door at the end of the day the Customers are the ones that provide for you! If it were my employee id fire her on the spot!
Audrianna H.,"Casa Grande, AZ",0,9,3,2.0,4/15/2017,"We ordered To-Go to bring back to our hotel room last night, and it was not a great experience. We placed our order online - no hiccups there. The real fun started when we arrived at the restaurant to pick up. Upon arrival, the young woman behind the counter was putting completed boxes of food in the warmer and completely ignoring the line of people behind her. When she finally addressed us, she was disinterested. I paid for our food and then proceeded to wait 30 minutes for them to pull it together. Once the food was ""ready"", I went through it on the counter and it was missing three things. Informed them of two (I forgot to mention the third, so we didn't get our side salad) and received them a few minutes later. Arriving back at the hotel, I realized that we were also missing the toppings for our baked potatoes that we had paid for.  The food was okay. Steak was good and cooked correctly. Baked potatoes were dry without the toppings. Tomato mozzarella salad was bland and tomatoes under ripe.  I did feel sympathy for the guy behind the counter that assisted to be training the young woman. On a busy Friday night, he was up to his eyeballs in orders and ornery stuff, and also having to train. He was extremely apologetic for the wait and very kind.  Probably won't be back to BJ's."
Magz K.,"San Diego, CA",231,598,2477,4.0,6/30/2016,Pretty good! Would suggest going for happy hour!! Half off of mini pizza which is amazing! The food is very good and the one thing I wouldn't get again would be the avocado egg rolls.
Mikayla G.,"Oceanside, CA",4,24,22,1.0,1/13/2017,"I am really disappointed with my last 2 visits. Last Monday we came and got a trio pizookie to go but when we got our order the ice cream was on the hot cookie (so obviously melting), so when I brought it to the waiters attention they took it back. Instead of providing pizookies that hadn't been topped with ice cream all they did was take the ice cream off and put it in a to go container. Not a huge deal but it's frustrating. Then last Sunday, we ordered a medium BJ's classic without mushrooms. When it was delivered (not by our waiter) we noticed the mushrooms and asked that they be taken off. Our waiter then delivered it again, announcing no mushrooms. We started eating it and found that it still had mushrooms. Apparently it was taken back and the mushrooms were just picked off. So they only caught what they could see. When we complained, he offered to take it back and get a new pizza. The new one came out and he was apologetic and said we will ""take it off"" so when I got the bill, I was very surprised that what they were taking off was the pizza that they got wrong twice not the new one. To me I shouldn't have to pay for something I didn't order. I was just really put off by the lack of customer service (no offer for a discount off the price of the pizza we ate because we had to wait even longer)."
Dan R.,"San Diego, CA",78,17,,1.0,12/11/2016,"I went there yesterday with my fiance and future mother-in-law. We ordered some beers a flatbread, deep dish pizza and a salad. The side salad was perfectly acceptable however when the pizza came out it went downhill. The deep dish pizza was lukewarm at best and if you rang it out im pretty sure you would wind up with a gallon of oil. Pizza regardless of type does not need to be prepared this way. The flatbread came out cold. When my mother in law asked the waitress to fix it, she brought it back, heated it up for a few seconds and it was back on the table. Now I am well aware that with chain restaurants like this, heating up frozen food, as this flatbread clearly was is common practice. However I do not want to have the food taste like it was frozen. It was rubbery, impossible to cut and tasted horrible. Then the waitress brought us the check. As we were putting in our credit cards she rushed back out saying she had forgotten to add two five oz tasters to the check. I get mistakes and have no qualms paying an extra five bucks but on principle if you make a mistake at a restaurant then you should own it considering the horrible food and novice service.  It is highly unlikely I will come back to any BJ's. If companies read reviews please take this as a chance to fix your issues because I rarely if ever feel the need to write a negative review unless the experience was THAT horrible."
Desmond F.,"San Diego, CA",130,1169,924,3.0,12/20/2016,"Came here a little before the lunch rush and our party of 7 was seated pretty quickly. Our server was reasonably quick and everything came without any problems. It's been a while since I've been to BJ's but it's kinda pops in the background as an option as a place for your typical American fare....pizza, burgers, sandwiches, pasta. The bonus is that it happens to be a more successful microbrewery. I no connoisseur but its nice to have some less than mainstream brews to try. This location in particular is very open with high ceilings for those of you with claustrophobia perhaps. I don't know about you but  I need the room to expand after eating a pizzookie."
Kenia F.,"Carlsbad, CA",63,47,4,5.0,8/27/2017,Ok we are back to 5 stars. Went back and had a great experience. Customer service was perfect. Definitely coming back
Ginny B.,"Vista, CA",0,16,,5.0,8/26/2017,We went to your restaurant yesterday and Justine was our waitress she was fantastic keep our drinks filled very courteous very polite and kept everything just perfect for us we really enjoyed it we sat outside on the patio was beautiful and we couldn't of asked for better service from Justine hope. The food was great she recommended things for us which turned out to be just perfect I hope the next time we come she can be our waitress we will definitely be back.
Gina R.,"San Jacinto, CA",2,36,27,1.0,7/29/2017,Were told the wait would only be 10min but it ended up being 45min. Other guests were getting seated than my party. When we were finally called up and walked to the table. The waiter said oh sorry looks like someone already took your table. So we had to wait again. Terrible service...
Rob P.,"Jacksonville, NC",70,289,239,3.0,4/29/2016,"I love the amount of variety this place has!  However, every time we have visited, its always been either half full or maybe 10 other couples/families there, and always find ourselves waiting an average of 10 minutes for a table.  Its like the waiters/waitress are playing paper, rock, scissors in the back for who is going to take the table. I like variety and sometimes in the mood for different things, but more than not, when I find something I really really like, I go to that place specifically for that.  BJ's is my place for deep dish Mediterranean pizza.  However they do have an amazing baked ziti dish, that is super greasy, but so good (that's my 3 stars).  It has been the ONLY meal that comes out hot and seems somewhat fresh.  The pizza is always luke warm, but by the time it comes out (because with like 4 other couples in there, they must be slammed in the kitchen) I'm so hungry I just eat it, instead of making the family sit there and wait for my food to come out after they are already done. Would love to go back, but everytime I think about the service and quality, I just rather go to a chili's or applebees and receive bad food and service for a cheaper price."
Elsa L.,"Carlsbad, CA",3,24,10,4.0,2/8/2017,We had a great meal experience here. My husband had peanut chicken soba noodle and he was feeling amazing to have it. I got avocado egg rolls and beer. fantastic taste. Really good staff. Romantic experience.
Lori R.,"Oceanside, CA",153,346,443,4.0,6/17/2016,"As a chain I like BJ's. It's consistent with food and cleanliness of the restaurants. The prices are in line with other chains but the food is exponentially better than Applebee's.  They have a food allergy menu to make it even easier than researching in advance. I like the grilled chicken stuff baked potato with sour cream instead of Alfredo. The server was very knowledgeable about food allergies too.  Good place, something for everyone!"
Angela A.,"Fallbrook, CA",63,14,23,1.0,7/14/2017,"Honestly this restaurant is in a great location, BUT THE SERVICE IS HORRIBLE. Our server wasn't friendly or on top of her job. I kept giving her the benefit of the doubt just because I figured it was Friday night and it was busy. But after waiting an hour just to sit down and 30 mins just for drinks plus kids food I was getting a little frustrated. Our server was taking her sweet time with everything and it seemed like we were a burden for her. It wasn't just the wait but they messed up on our meals, we had to hunt her down for refills on drinks. To tell the truth there was so many errors I even had to talk to management just because it was a mess today. I will not be returning to this location. I would rather take my service elsewhere. Good luck if you decided to go to this location."
Saleen D.,"San Diego, CA",705,1120,1464,2.0,7/21/2015,"Man, what a let down! My girlfriends & I came here for dinner & 2/4 of us were disappointed with our meals.  Customer service was bad.  We had several servers & they were kind but extremely disorganized & forgetful!  I ordered: Angel Hair Classico - Way, way too bland.  It has absolutely no flavor although the menu states garlic oil.  It was just pasta with vegetables.   One of my girlfriends is very lactose-intolerant & she said no cheese in her soup.  Then repeated it again to make sure the server understood how serious she was.  Unfortunately, she found cheese in her soup...  Also, when the soup was brought out, the server did not give her a spoon. It was difficult to talk to our server because when someone asked him for something, he would run off to get it instead of waiting to hear what we all needed.  So then, he kept on running & coming back  & running & coming back because one needed a spoon, one needed ground pepper, & I needed parmesan cheese."
Thomas C.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,26,1,1.0,7/15/2017,Bjs is usually really good but I got massive food poisoning from this one. Hopefully it was bad food and not disgusting kitchens.
Alissa N.,"Boulder Creek, CA",0,5,1,1.0,8/4/2017,"Second visit will be our last. On the last visit we received a cold burger. Tonight we signed up online for the preferred waitlist. Upon arrival we were told it would be about 15 min more. After 25 min I went to check and was told there were 6 parties ahead of us. After 35 min more we were finally seated. It was about 10 min before a waiter came to take our order. 20 min later one meal came out. After 15 min we still did not have our other 3 meals. When they finally arrived there was almost no sauce on the pizza, the well done burger was still red inside, and the salad looked dried out and withered. We did not even complain at that point but just tried to eat and leave. We will not give this restaurant business again."
Gabriel D.,"Middlesex, NJ",1,69,112,5.0,6/28/2017,"Three apps and four entrees for the family. All awesome. The lettuce wraps were out of this world. I had the chicken soba with spicy peanut sauce. It was great. Not quite as spicy as I like it, but awesome."
Yazzie J.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,5,,2.0,8/1/2017,"I've been to few different bjs around town and I am a big fan of this restaurant overall however this particular location is not as good as the others. I usually sit at the bar... I was there last night (my first time at this location) and the bartender, a female with long brown hair was absolutely inattentive and barely acknowledged me. She acted like I was a bother to her. Had to flag her down for everything and she had very unwelcoming vibe to her. Barely said 2 words to me the entire time... she was busy doing her closing cleaning up for the night and that was 10:05pm... almost 2hrs before closing.  Didn't ask if I needed another beer, didn't ID me either and forgot to give me plate and didn't give me water either. Had to flag her down to order food, beer..for everything and every time she acted like I was wasting her time. I usually tip between 25% to 40% and last night was the first time I left Bjs without tipping.... that speaks for itself.  I suggest you try different location - highly recommend the La Jolla/UTC or Mission Valley locations...they're happy to serve you there.  The food and drink was also mediocre here... seriously thought that all the pizza were made the same in all locations but nope , I couldn't even finish my pizza here. Just a disappointing experience really... will probably take a long break for this chain for awhile."
Linda W.,"Oceanside, CA",0,10,,2.0,8/1/2017,"We used to love eating at BJ's - it was one of our favorites. We noticed in the last 2yrs that the quality of food has really gone down - in taste, appearance and presentation. We thought we'd just try something different for our next visits - sorry, but quality and taste have seem to have suffered across the board. We no longer even consider this place anymore. It was great but after it was sold  we began to see the changes and they have continued to deteriorate. ."
