Jeff W.,"Carlsbad, CA",69,9,1,2.0,10/5/2011,"I really WANT to like this place.  The ambience, layout, bar, etc. is really cool, but every food item I have ever tried here has been only one notch above horrible.  (*disclaimer - except the pizookie, which is incredible!)  To call this ""Deep Dish"" pizza is a outright lie.  Sure they serve it in a pan but its nothing more than thick crust with very few toppings.  Think Pizza Hut in a pan.  Despicable.  If you just want a cool place to have happy hour in a great atmosphere with nice tvs for sports, then you'll be fine.  Just plan on going to Kings Seafood next door if you get hungry."
Kaleb M.,"Austin, TX",274,111,23,3.0,3/4/2012,"I am torn, when I go with a small party during regular hours the service and food is amazing. During peak hours, or with a larger party the service crumbles. Food is forgotten, and not always the best quality. I love the happy hour offered but I would recommend going with a table of 4 or smaller."
Greg S.,"Carlsbad, CA",19,17,10,3.0,5/22/2010,"BJ's is a local chain that primarily specializes in pizza's and microbrew beers.  This location also has a full bar and wine selection. Overall the food is fairly decent.  Fish and Chips portion is adequate, but not as large as you'd get at Cheesecake factory for the same price.  Their pesto flatbread is a nice appetizer to share.  Chicken pasta was fine - nothing to exciting.  Their pizza is pretty awesome though. Chicago style, deep dish, lots of cheese.  Order extra sauce and request to remove the tomatoes from the top if you want a more traditional pizza. Biggest problem: parking!  It's already super crowded and they are building more restaurants next to the current location.  Bit of a pain in the butt."
Carol V.,"El Sobrante, CA",1,15,,1.0,7/7/2014,"Came here in mid-June on a Thursday evening for my son's birthday. Was told the wait was a half hour, but we ended up waiting 45 minutes to be seated. We got a patio table on a very chilly night and our heat lamp was the only one that didn't work so we were pretty cold. The waiter took our drink orders pretty quickly then it took 10 minutes ( no joke ) to get out 3 drinks. The drinks were not even brought out by our waiter so still no one took our order. After about another 10 minutes and a large party being brought out on the patio and given their drink orders quickly we did what we have never done- left. To have people wait for about 20 minutes just to get their order taken is ridiculous. Never going back."
Jim N.,"Escondido, CA",0,3,,5.0,12/5/2013,"My kids love the good there!  We always go there every Friday.   The pasta is awesome.  Service is great.  The only dislike I have is the wait, but overall its wonderful!"
Greg M.,"Oceanside, CA",0,9,1,4.0,6/28/2014,Good Service. Consistent food. Great Beer.
Mary E.,"Encinitas, CA",83,58,3,2.0,4/9/2011,"Oh BJ's.  I'm so sad to say this.  But you really, really let us down.  The first time we were here we liked it.  The second time, we loved it.  Then it all came crashing down around our ears.  I know places can have bad nights.  But to have SO many things go wrong in one night?  C'moooonnnn... So we arrive with my in-laws who are fresh off a plane.  We've called ahead for our table.  We show up with our two kids (5 and an 8 month old) and are told it will be about ten minutes for our table.  Then we wait.  And wait.  And wait.  Almost 40 minutes later, we start off to our table (""HOORAY!"" shouts my starving son...) only to find that...it's not ready.  It's really, really dirty still.  Not even close to ready.  They walk us back to the lobby, then back to the table, then back too...stand around while people whiz around us because we've been left in the way of just about everything and everyone in the restaurant.  Finally, after another ten minutes we're seated.  Feet crunching in all the crud still on the floor because they didn't REALLY clean too well.  Then we wait and wait and wait for our waitress.  We order.  We find out they're out of what my husband ordered.  Then they're out of the next thing he ordered.  Then we finally figure out and explain to the waitress that maybe they're out of shrimp entirely and not just the things he keeps ordering.  And then we wait and wait and wait for our food.   The pulled pork sliders are the reason I'm not giving a one star review.  They're seriously good.  Even though they were a little off that night.  Everything else?  Meh.  My mother-in-law's avocado rolls were soggy.  Her caprese was embarrassing.  Our bignet was marginal even.  Ugh.  It just was NOT a good night at BJ's.  I could keep complaining.  There's a lot more I could say.  But I won't.  You get my point.  We'll give it one more try I'm sure and if it's not great, we're done for good."
Hong G.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,27,,1.0,8/17/2013,"if i could give this place negative stars, i would. i've been here multiple times after work, i've only had one decent experience and that's because i was at the bar instead of the restaurant. food is bland, lowered to the base denominator of having 32084304823x things on the menu w/o mastering anything service is the big one. it will take them forever; a work lunch literally took us 2.5 hours. ordering alone was a 30 minute affair somehow. sometimes the serving staff gives you attitude. for example, once i asked for a gluten-free item on the menu. end of discussion right? nope, not to this waitress. she asked me if i had celiac's disease (no, but that's really none of her business). told me gluten didnt matter (debatable point in and of itself, but who cares?). and that i should order the non-gluten-free version. wtf never again will i let friends go here again (or work)"
Anna M.,"Las Vegas, NV",46,53,,4.0,1/6/2012,I have been to a few BJ's Breweries in various areas and they all seem to be consistent with their food. Their Great White Pizza is delicious. I came here for a late lunch and sat in the bar. Their beer was discounted (happy hour???) and the Avocado Egg Rolls are flippin' fantastic. I am giving it a 4 star because I am not entirely blown away by their beer.
Marie P.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,23,2,1.0,6/8/2014,"So bummed...we took our son out to BJs to celebrate his birthday.  Even though we told the server that it was our son's birthday, that important info was forgotten and no ""Happy Birthday"" from the staff.  For the money this restaurant charges, they better improve the quality of their food.  I cannot imagine that anyone would return for a second time.  The fish n chips was over cooked and just bleh.  I hope that the manager reads these comments and makes changes.  But at least the beer was tasty.   My son wanted to stay home and eat leftover Costco pizza and we should have listened to his suggestion!"
Chris B.,"Oceanside, CA",0,10,,2.0,6/4/2014,"So I've given BJ's a few shots over the past two years and every time I'm disappointed. Something always seems to go wrong, whether it's the food or service. Tonight it was both. The pricing is fair and the food is decent but a problem always seems to pop up. Last time I head to BJ's or recommend."
Robert L.,"San Diego, CA",0,17,5,4.0,1/22/2012,Great food and awsome lunch specials.  Service is usually GREAT but they can get a bit overwhelmed.  We go for luch at least twice a month.  Great burgers and their Ahi salad is to die for.
Mellissa W.,"Vista, CA",18,17,3,2.0,6/13/2011,"This place frustrates me.  I think the food is going to be good (pics, discriptions etc) but the place fails me everytime.  Its my ouw fault, my husband and I went their one day waiting for my car.  Food sucked.  A few weeks later we were waiting for his car, after last time we said we would not go back, we relented and tried again.  Food still sucked.  A year later we tried again, food still sucks.  Cool place, nice staff, but thats all its got going for itself.  Sad"
C T.,"San Diego, CA",1,8,1,1.0,10/5/2010,"This location SCREAMS inexperienced/poor/pushy service.   First, I got a bbq pizza instead of the one i ordered (for all you bbq pizza lovers, Ew?) While I'm scraping bbq sauce off my FIRST slice of pizza, the server brings out my pizookie which turns to melted mush. Next thing I know the waitress proceeds to ask if I need a box for my pizza... while slapping the check on the table.  Mind you, I'm still on my first slice of pizza. =/ For a calm, cool, collected customer, I thought she was completely out of line for rushing us out after I kindly mentioned the pizza mistake.  For now on, I will only come here to satisfy my pizookie cravings & I'm perfectly ok with that."
Hanna T.,"Vista, CA",51,59,22,2.0,8/1/2011,"Pizza was not good at all, I think I mustered up 2 agonizing slices but that was it. I could not believe after all this time waiting to try their pizza it was so bad in many ways. There was hardly any sauce or cheese, very salty. Everything else was 5 stars: service, cleanliness, selection, beer. What a shame."
Erica N.,"San Diego, CA",49,53,22,2.0,4/8/2010,"I've been to the BJ's in La Jolla more times then I can count and it's delicious with good service. I was excited to try the new one in Carlsbad now that I live in North County.  I was really disappointed! I ordered my standard...mini cheese and tomato pizza. Simple...easy....pizza staple. It was dry..too much sauce, not enough cheese...not gooey or yummy at all. Are they cooking the food at this new location differently? Also maybe because it was new, the service was not good. Our server was being trained, so we basically has two waiters and neither of them could remember to bring my water with no ice even though we asked (nicely) three times. I think I'd rather drive to La Jolla!"
Don S.,"Carlsbad, San Diego, CA",14,1,,4.0,9/16/2012,"Went here for lunch with my Wife and Son after going to the outlets. The service was awesome and the food/beer was great. I would recommend this place to anyone and we will certainly be back again. Also, the prices for lunch are great for the area!"
Stacey B.,"Carlsbad, San Diego, CA",227,27,1,4.0,3/30/2012,"Lot's of variety in the menu - so lots of options no matter what you are in the mood for ... Kids always have fun, and love the place.  Generous portions.  Can get a little crowded at lunch and dinner time, and the lot is tight (small parking spots).   Very nice decor - dark wood, granite, and TVs with sporting events are skattered throughout to make sure the sports lover doesn't miss a thing.   Fun place for a young crowd or family to go and absolutely fabulous desert - the Pazookie - do not go without!"
L O.,"Oceanside, CA",0,13,,5.0,3/10/2014,"Good food. Awesome beers. Great service from Carlos! I have been a couple of times and the service was okay but Carlos was amazing, great knowledge of beers and food which is nice when you are indecisive as I am."
Edward H.,"San Diego, CA",25,59,6,1.0,1/20/2013,"This review is primarily for customer service and not for the food.  Following a movie outing in Oceanside, we decided to call in to BJ's to order a medium pizza.  Bear in mind, this is a Sunday evening after 10pm.  Since they're open til midnight, it was one of the few places still open serving relatively good food.  My wife called the take out number, the hostess answered and put us on hold.  While this is going on, take into account that we're driving from Oceanside to Carlsbad...  End result: We drove all the way from Mission Road, Oceanside to BJ's on Paseo Del Norte and NO ONE picked up the phone to take our order.  We were left on hold for 5-10 minutes.  Poor customer service. As we walk in, we're finally greeted by an employee and we explain our situation that we were put on hold and no one ever picked up.  No apology.  This individual went ahead and took our order (Ryan - from the receipt).  While waiting for our order (10-12 minutes), I noticed the restaurant wasn't busy, so I found it odd for the lack of attention.  Also during our wait, someone called the take out line and the hostess answered again, putting whomever on hold.  The same individual (Ryan) picked up the phone and based on what I could hear (i.e. loud enough for anyone to hear), it was a personal call.  So if someone else had been trying to place an order, would they have gotten through?  Made me wonder if this was why we were on hold for so long.  Extremely poor customer service.  Don't think I'll bother calling in an order here....as my wife mentioned she had to wait an extremely long time in the past also.  It might be better to drive up a bit and give Bistro West or Hensley's our business...."
