Mary H.,"Oceanside, CA",1,28,,1.0,1/26/2013,"After reading some of these reviews, I have to think if we are talking about the same restaurant. I know that sometimes it is just a bad day etc. and sometimes it should be brought up with management so they can make it right that same day. So with that being said I was just there today sat 1/23/13. So maybe management will address what they can if they see this and they should. My husband will not let me send any food back and hates if I complain.  We started out there today early got there around 11:45 am and it was not busy and got seated right away. Our server was ok, I ordered a glass of chardonnay and got interrupted by my granddaughter and forgot to mention was type. Server brought me the Barefoot house wine and I sent it back, I told him in a nice way it is always better to ask than to assume and of course to up sell :) He was nice about it and we joked that I may have looked like a Barefoot wine girl, but I like Kendall Jackson.   Anyways on to the food....the reason why we are there right???? Our food was so bad that my husband finally admitted it when we got home later today and we will never, ever go back.  I got sick from my food and missed most of Disney on Ice and my husband also got tummy ache, but not as bad as mine if you know what I mean.  I had a quarter of his burger and it was cold and just not good. It tasted like they did not clean the grill in a while and was kind of a rancid taste, which in my opinion what caused the stomach issues.  We also ordered the avocado rolls and they were also cold and just not good, no flavor!!!! French fries were also cold and horrible skinny tasteless things.  The manager of this restaurants needs to address the old food on the grill issue because that is the same as leaving food out and that is what causes food borne illnesses.  The kitchen staff should be talked to and opening management needs to check on this and make sure they don't have a case of the lazy's and getting people sick.   This may seem harsh and one should not rush to judge, but I have worked in restaurants long enough to know that if the entire order is cold and two people get sick then there is probably more people having the same issue with this establishment and management needs to address this right away."
Ethan S.,"Cardiff-by-the-Sea, CA",167,24,,4.0,5/2/2010,"Great menu selection, amazing beer selection, overall good service,  including for my last birthday with about 15 of us. My co-workers and I have been going there lately for happy hour and their appetizer list is pretty good as well. Try the mozzarella sticks, lettuce wraps, or avo egg rolls. The pizza is excellent (deep dish), and if you want to be spoiled get a pazookie for dessert, although another yelper did say that the calories are way up on it.  When I first went there the service was ok, but that was when it was a new restaurant, and more recently the service has gotten better. I am a big fan of BJ's overall as you can tell! Negatives: HUGE WAIT almost every night, so get there early. It's also pretty loud in there. Parking can be pretty tough too, but I think they are building a parking garage right now. Bartenders are very friendly and will help you out with beer selections; it's pretty overwhelming, and I'm a consistent and long-term beer drinker :) Good amount of TV's too. Go and enjoy!"
Tom H.,"Carlsbad, CA",27,25,12,3.0,2/15/2012,"Server was OK, food no so much. We both had a New York strip and they were properly cooked and tasty, but a poor cut with lots of gristle"
Tim R.,"Oceanside, CA",134,64,1,4.0,10/9/2010,BJ's has the best chicken wings in the North County. If you know some place better...let me know. I will check it out. The Pizza is pretty good too! Go for Happy Hour. Good Discounts.
rachel w.,"Oceanside, CA",29,104,7,4.0,4/7/2011,"This place has great food and pretty good service.  The parking can be a nightmare as can the wait time.  I suggest making a reservation or coming during off hours.  All that being said, I'm a fan :)"
Aaron O.,"Carlsbad, CA",8,14,,2.0,7/12/2012,"Got 2 stars, which is better than I rate most chains....but still nothing better than decent chain food.  The reason for 2 stars is that they butter and grease everything to the point where it doesn't add any additional flavor - just more grease.  At least they are upfront with the calorie count on the menu, but there is no need or point to cake the bun of a fried chicken sandwich in butter....I guess that is how you get a chicken sandwich up to 1300 calories. The beer is good, the food is OK - nothing special, but not horrible.  After today, I am over them and will likely do my best to not return any time soon."
Stephanie D.,"Oceanside, CA",0,16,,5.0,4/1/2012,"Great dining experience, even with a waitress training on her first day! Kudos! High Class food that is very affordable and an all around great time out! Highly recommend young to Elder!"
Baxter C.,"Solana Beach, CA",14,102,3,2.0,4/9/2013,Extremely slow lunch service.  I have been there several times in the last two months and the food and drinks take extremely long to arrive.  Good beers though.  I won't be back.
Anshel S.,"San Diego, CA",472,160,13,2.0,7/26/2011,"This place is no different from the BJs ive been to in the past...in Escondido. Nevertheless, we came here for a birthday of my friends and figured why not. Well, there were about 8 or 9 of us and it literally took a grand total of 3 hours for us to get our food ordered, get it and eat it, and then pay. I've never spent so much time at a restaurant that i really didn't want to stay at. The Pizookies are good and so is the actual food, its not amazing by all means, but its not bad either. The slow service was really what got me this time and I really didn't enjoy paying 17% gratuity when I wasn't quite satisfied with the service. I don't even think it was the server's fault, she had to service like 1/4 of the whole restaurant."
M B.,"San Diego, CA",11,3,2,1.0,11/24/2013,"Terrible service.  We went on Friday last week so I waited a few days to calm down and see if I still felt this way, but this was an awful experience all around and I feel I have to warn others.  Waited over 1 hour for my husbands meal because the waitress forgot to put it in, we had to go get the menus ourselves while the staff was trying to apologize, they gave my daughters food to a kid at the table next to us who had ordered the same thing even though they seated about half an hour after us and then took another 15 minutes for her food.  By the way she got a kids spaghetti, which takes almost no time to throw in a bowl.  The food was ok, not good not bad but the service will keep me from ever visiting a BJs again.  There were so many servers yet watching them, it was apparent to both my family and the table next to us whom we started chatting with that no one knew what was going on.  I feel robbed and want my 50 bucks back.  Did I mention overpriced?  Never, ever again go somewhere else."
Chaz C.,"Encinitas, CA",0,4,,3.0,7/5/2012,"I ordered the pizza and it reminded me of a less greasy Pizaria Uno pizza.  I thought it was fine, but nothing to write home about.   The beer they brew was good, but it didn't blow me away.   For beer, I much prefer Pizza Port.   However, the Pizza at Pizza Port is horrible.   Honestly, I am not a huge fan of deep dish pizza and much prefer NYC/Philly style.  Unfortunately, I haven't found a good NYC/Phily style pizza place in San Diego.   In short, this place was OK, so I gave it 3 stars.   (PS - The waiter we had was great)."
T B.,"Carlsbad, San Diego, CA",0,14,,4.0,6/27/2012,"The $20 holiday meal deal (two salads, a medium pizza, and dessert) was perfect for dinner. Even though the place was PACKED, the service was good."
Tammra T.,"San Marcos, CA",29,7,,2.0,1/3/2014,"Horrible service tonight on patio. Extremely incompetent server. She did not take our appetizer order correctly then dinner ticket was ""lost"".  When food arrived it was cold. She couldn't even bring us our bill and containers for leftovers in a timely manner. Manager did apologize and comped our meal."
Caroline M.,"Honolulu, HI",111,297,46,2.0,7/18/2011,Chains are boring. That's just my opinion. Generic American chain food. Decent atmosphere and service. Popular and blah.
Brandie N.,"Vista, CA",67,71,22,4.0,7/2/2011,"Bj's is a great place to go for if your not quite sure what you want...they have an awesome selection of beers and their deep dish pizza is to die for.  Sometimes getting a table takes awhile, especially if you have a party bigger than two.  I think their service is great and the food is never disappointing.  They don't take reservations which sucks but you can call 30 minutes ahead of your arrival to get your name on the waiting to be seated list.  I do that every time so I don't have to wait as long."
Chris G.,"Encinitas, CA",27,141,39,4.0,5/12/2011,"Went here initially just to try their beer, but left here wanting to return to try more things off their huge menu. So the beer was great, I really liked the Hef and the Pale Ale, excellent pairing with the flat bread pizzas. The food was good, quickly brought out, and what we expected. Good pricing, especially at happy hour. They have these great things called small bites which is a great collection of very small snacks; street tacos, fried artichoke hearts, seared tuna and so on. Very cheap and very tasty. Would recommend this place for someone looking for variety, good beer, and a sports bar like atmosphere. No complaints, we'll be returning soon."
Megan V.,"Carlsbad, CA",5,29,8,5.0,7/30/2011,"Me and my family have been here several times, everytime has been so much fun! Amazing pizza and salad. Rootbeer is awesome, homemade, amazing! We recently had our daughters bday party here with 30 people they set up an area for us set up an all u can eat pizza and salad buffet for a very reasonable price which includes non alcoholic drinks. Customer service was amazing, so on top of it, patient with a table full of children and always kept everything supplied and full. Great great great! Manager personally over saw the whole night and went above and beyond. Everyone at the party was raving about the food and how grear the staff was...great job bjs we love you!!"
Sara T.,"Escondido, CA",20,56,10,5.0,5/8/2011,"I loved that when I made a reservation for 25 people and that they called me to confirm it, and they got us a big table. We waited maybe 2 minutes for that, and after that, we were ready to go. Nothing to complain about time-wise because we had plenty of it! The waiters and waitresses there are fantastic and they really made us feel good. It was prom night, and they were totally making us feel it! The drinks, appetizers, and food came out pretty quick! And it was delicious. I love the Sesame Chicken Salad! Thanks BJ's you rock!"
Sara L.,"San Diego, CA",81,56,,2.0,3/13/2011,"Overall this place is kind of a giant corporate snoozefest.  It would serve as a good place for a large group, because there's ample parking, a huge menu of blandish food and its spacious inside.  Our service was just fine.  For me, the beers are lacking.  I've had most of them, today I had the Pale Ale, and its just not that hoppy or flavorful.  I can't imagine I'll be back here anytime soon."
Natalie H.,"Oceanside, CA",19,20,1,4.0,1/3/2011,"I have been to several BJ's and loved the idea of one being so close to my home now and I had been dying to go.  Its excellent traditional americana fare and you can expect everything from pizzas to burgers to salads and more.  My favorite thing on the menu (other than dessert which I will get to) is the Parmesan Crusted chicken which comes with super creamy and delicious mashed potatoes.  Always save room for dessert and order their famous Pizooki.  Its a warm, doughy cookie that was pulled fresh from the oven and topped with ice cream.  Bring a big appetite or a friend who likes to share and you will be set!"
