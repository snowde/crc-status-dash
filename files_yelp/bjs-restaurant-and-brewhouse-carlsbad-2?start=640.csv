Heather N.,"New York, NY",2,11,3,2.0,1/28/2014,"Came here the other night, and thankfully it wasn't busy at all, in fact, we were one of maybe 8 or 10 other tables.  Our server took our beverage order quickly, and we asked for a couple minutes to look over the menu.  He was back in like, 30 seconds to see if we knew what we wanted to order.  The food came out quickly, I got mahi mahi tacos which were mediocre and the salsa tasted like it was from a Costco jar. My bf got Jambalaya and said it was pretty good.  The server was back before I had even finished my first taco to ask if we needed to go boxes and drop off our check.  We felt super rushed, i'd say we weren't even there for 25 minutes by the time we had paid our bill and left.   Customer service was OK.  Definitely wasn't good, but it wasn't terrible."
Anthony C.,"Oceanside, CA",3,29,4,3.0,5/21/2011,"Great atmosphere! Very busy on weekends. Unfortunately the pasta and caesar salad I ordered were not very good at all! I tried some other peoples food at the table and while some dishes were great, others were marginal at best. I think I'd give it another shot and try the pizza but honestly rather go to pizza port if I'm in the mood for great pizza and micro brew beer. Very busy though so people must like it, maybe the cooks were having a bad night? I would give it a 2.5 if I could but I'll be nice and push it up to 3 stars."
Brian K.,"San Diego, CA",1,14,,1.0,8/13/2013,"Zero stars are not available, so yay one star. The deep dish combination pizza was truly horrible. It lacked sauce, cheese, and flavor. It was the worst pizza I can ever remember tasting. A loaf of white bread dipped into a jar of pasta sauce would have been better, and considerably less than their $25+ rape the cutsomer prices.  It was excellent if you like to poop because it gave us the runs. This restaurant is theeeee bottom feeder of chain restaurants. No wonder they expanded their menu to an encyclopedia of choices, because they obviously could not make it as the pizza place they once were long ago."
Christina H.,"Minneapolis, MN",25,33,9,5.0,5/7/2011,"My husband and I decided to try this place the other night, and was it ever delicious! I give this place 5 stars because every part of our experience was pleasant. Our waiter was very attentive to our needs the entire time, our food was delicious, and the atmosphere was nice. To start off we had one of their flatbread pizza appetizers, it was crispy cheesy, and of course delicious! For the meal I kept it simple with their BJ's burger which had garlic bread for the bun (YUM) and it came with a side of fries, also YUM! My husband had the french dip with fries (also comes with a garlic bread bun) and he was over-joyed with the juicy-ness of this stacked french dip :) I would also recommend their homemade root beer, amazin'!"
Sarah O.,"Richmond, VA",60,69,4,1.0,10/29/2010,"I've eaten at BJ's a couple of times.  The food is so-so (about what you would expect from this kind of place), the atmosphere is pretty nice, it's clean (at least appears to be) and there are a fair number of tv's to watch.   The one star rating comes from my second (and last) visit to BJ's.  The waitress took our drink order and delivered the alcohol pretty quickly (no water like we asked for but that seems to happen pretty much everywhere).  A few minutes later, she came back to tell us that another waitress was taking over because she was going on her break.  I thought that was a little odd (I waitressed for years and never took a break when I had tables that had just been sat) but not a big deal.  The new waitress was training another girl.   Well, we got our food - average.  I ordered a second margarita and the trainee brought it to the table and spilled it all over the table, the booth, my lap and my food.  Again, I was a waitress for years so, while this was uncomfortable, I wasn't mad.  I let her know it was fine and I would just eat the food I had and avoid the margarita laced potatoes.   The problem....no manager ever came to the table to apologize and NOTHING was taken off of our bill.  Not even the margarita that was spilled all over my lap!  As a former waitress, I find that to be HORRIBLE customer service.  If I made a mistake, I was always quick to go to the manager and let them know so we could take care of something for the customer.  That's how you get people to come back if there is a problem.  This wasn't the trainee's responsibility (although I doubt she'll make it long if she doesn't figure this out quickly).  It was the responsibility of the tall brunette waitress that was training her (this was Monday 10/25/10) in case anyone from the restaurant happens to read this.  There were also several other employees that helped clean up that obviously didn't mention anything to management either. That was enough for me.  I won't be back.  I recommend Karl Strauss or West Bistro in Carlsbad.  Better service and MUCH better food."
Meggan W.,"Oceanside, CA",75,4,,1.0,1/9/2014,"My boyfriend and I went on Sunday evening (1/5/14) after we agreed on a place for dinner. I had been here before a handful of times with little to no complaints. But it was TERRIBLE! We waited at our table 10-15 minutes before even being ASKED if we had been helped, and the woman who asked us then had to go get our waiter. Our drinks weren't the sizes we had asked for when we got them another 15 minutes later, we were never given water even though we both ordered alcoholic beverages which, having worked at a restaurant before, is necessary. You don't want your guests getting too intoxicated and have them cause issues. Luckily we aren't those type of customers. When we got our food almost an hour after we ordered  we still had to pick off ingredients we asked to be excluded from our order, and it was luke warm like it had just been sitting around waiting for our waitress to get the time in her oh so busy schedule to SERVE HER CUSTOMERS. I don't remember her name but she was a shorter young woman with black hair and looked of maybe asian heritage? Think her name started with a K. Anyway, there were waiters RUNNING across the floor with customers food, saw other staff texting on their cell phones while holding a customers food or waiting to enter something in on the computer. I understand being busy but the staff was drastically  unequipped. My boyfriend lives in LA and we will only be visiting the BJs branches in his area after this embarrassment. We gladly left zero tip."
Richard N.,"Oceanside, CA",0,14,,2.0,1/6/2014,"GOOD beer, great bar tenders. Wait staff is PUSHY. I thought it was just the few I have had at first..but it is ALL of them I have had. Food is ok. Go for the beer."
Nina B.,"Murrieta, CA",0,10,,1.0,1/5/2014,"I love BJs but have had issues with the food at this location.   What ever cook was on last night did not know how to cook BJs dishes.  I had a chicken club sandwich described with chicken,  avocado,  bacon,  mayo, etc.  My sandwich had no mayo no avocado and included tomato.  I immediately sent it back and had the correct sandwich a few minutes later.   My friend ordered the fish and chips.  Fish says lightly fried, but was all coating,  she felt sick eating it.  Everyone in our party sent something back bc it wasn't correct.   Felt bad for the server who had to keep requesting correct dishes.  Not coming to this location again."
David M.,"Vista, CA",0,3,1,1.0,1/2/2014,"Sat down to eat on New Years eve around 630pm. Ordered an appetizer shortly after that, did not get them until 720pm. Also we only got one of the two we ordered. Our main course came out about 5 minutes later. Our server was not paying attention to detail. though the foot was good, service was very slow and bad, may not go back for a while."
Beth R.,"Oceanside, CA",0,6,1,3.0,12/29/2013,Outside of the hostess screwing up and not putting my name on the list and having to wait 40 min everything was great
Dale E.,"Encinitas, CA",4,12,,5.0,7/6/2011,"So it's like this.  If you go there expecting anything but a big popular chain restaurant you will be disappointed.  It's a big corporate chain.  If that is a problem stop reading now.  However, it is, by far, the best big corporate chain ever.  I love BJs.  Because every single food item I have had there has been good or better.  Literally nothing has disappointed me at all and many things have be surprisingly amazing.  But also because their beer selection is fanfuckingtastic.  Every one of their house brews is at least on par with Stone and they stock some really amazing imports, domestic crafts, and local brews as well.  Eh.  Maybe I'm just a sucker for good food and good beer.  Wait.  Hold on.  Who _isn't_ a sucker for good food and good beer?"
Gail S.,"Worcester, MA",27,11,,4.0,4/28/2011,"Really liked it here, nice atmosphere; tvs on with games so husband happy and coloring for the kids. Had a great salad; don't remember the name and hubby had an awesome burger."
M R.,"Carlsbad, CA",166,35,15,4.0,3/14/2011,I like this place and it has a HUGE menu so their are options for everyone. I've sat in the bar and the restaurant and like both. I think their pizzas are my favorite. I have the buffalo chicken pizza (with no celery) and it was amazing. I especially like the crust. Good beer selection and their service is good.
Kevin D.,"Cardiff-by-the-Sea, CA",39,36,,3.0,12/5/2011,"I had lunch here today and I would give it more than three stars, but the calamari was so inferior, they should not have had it on the menu. I didn't expect fresh, but either the product was inferior or it had been mis-handled. The rest of our food was four star, the beer was five and so was the wait staff. Not just my guy, but everyone seemed educated and instructed. I recommend the place."
Jasmine H.,"Oceanside, CA",5,15,,5.0,12/3/2013,This place is awesome!  I really enjoy their deep dish pizza and their great selection of beer.  Might want to make a reservation though because the place is always packed for dinner.  Highly recommend trying if you have not already.
Ash N.,"San Diego, CA",16,61,,3.0,7/21/2010,"I came here with some friends to try the famous Pazookie! The Pazookie is basically just a huge cookie, it was pretty good.  Not the best dessert I've ever had but it was ok.  Their pizza was really good and you get pretty big portions.  This is a great place to go right after you go shopping at the outlet mall which is right across the street."
Sara M.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,11,,3.0,10/19/2013,"I love their blond beer and their fried artichokes. I'm a vegetarian, and their veggie burger is just alright, not the best.  The atmosphere is always busy and happenin'.  However, what really makes me hesitate to go there every time is the service --  sometimes they take so very long to bring the food at the bar. Its also disruptive when they change shifts in the middle of the service -- it seems to be every time. If they improve their service, it would be great place to eat."
Sean D.,"Carlsbad, CA",10,17,,2.0,8/24/2010,"I love the food here.  Good selection of great comfort food and something for everybody.  However, I have been to this particular restaurant about 10 times now, and the service is reliably sub-par.  At first I just figured the staff was new (because the restaurant was new) and they needed some time to get organized.  But I can't just give them a pass anymore.   After waiting to sit down (not their fault, it's a popular place) you wait forever for anyone to come up to you.  4 out of 10 times, I actually had to walk back up to the front to request a server come by.  After waiting a good 10-15min for someone to come by, you naturally start looking around for someone.  It's then you notice that the wait staff will not make eye contact.  That leads me to believe they know there's a problem and it's a consistent one.  My order is only occasionally right.  It's gotten to a point where I just keep things simple because I know they can't handle complicated requests like ""no tomato please"". Service is slow and disconnected.  Food is slow and usually wrong.  And getting the check requires firing a flare in the restaurant to let them know you're ready to leave.  Most places with bad service at least get the money part right. It's good food, especially the pizza and Pizookie.  But manage your expectations if you go (at any time of day).  My suggestion is- get it to go, or sit at the bar.  I have had marginally better success at the bar tables. Oh, one last thing.  I completely agree with Julie S.  I won't be taking my daughter there again.  Or at least, not until she has the patience required for bad service."
Doug T.,"La Habra, CA",0,44,7,4.0,4/15/2013,"Food is generally good.  Service is a bit slow, even though it was later and the rush was over."
Cindy L.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,23,,4.0,6/23/2011,"I don't drink beer, but I do enjoy everything else they offer here.  I've enjoyed everything on their menu so far with the exception of the Mediterranean pizza. Oh boy! It was really salty, like they poured the pickle juice into the pizza. The last time we were there, our friends ordered it even though we warned them about our experience initially.  Well, they took the olives off and it was okay.  I guess the olives were the over kill. You've got try the new Ahi Salad, and their ahi poke appetizer....mmmm!"
