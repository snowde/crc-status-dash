Danica K.,"Fallbrook, CA",37,14,,4.0,2/14/2011,Their beer selection is Great! love the hefen weisen my favorite. And their deep dish pizza is bomb too. it's always I mean always packed when I'm in there which sucks sometimes but I guess that means it's good!
Lorna L.,"San Marcos, CA",0,5,,5.0,6/15/2011,"Went here two days in a row,once for lunch and once for dinner. Lost my wallet and a staff member handed it in, return it with all the money, cards, store gift cards and license still in it.  Great to know there are still some honest people.   Food was great, had fantasitc shrimp letttuce wrap, followed by Californian club flat bread & salad, it was so tasty and delicious and just over 500 cal.  Next night had the chicken with spinach over rice with tarragon.  My kids loved their food too, always a challenge. My husband loved their selection of beers.  Love the food, light, flavorful and filling, and LOVE the Staff!!!!  Thank you so very much, will definitely be back!!"
Alison R.,"Carlsbad, CA",58,6,3,4.0,4/2/2011,The food here is delicious! My favorite item on the menu is the meatloaf and the chicken lettuce wraps. The wedge salad is very good as well. The service has never been that great. The servers and bussers are very polite and nice but some of them are very slow! I recommend sitting at the bar cause that's where i received the best service!
Rebecca N.,"Encinitas, CA",41,106,64,4.0,9/20/2010,I like their clam chowder in the sourdough bowl on cold nights with whatever special beer they have on tap at the time.
Harmony D.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,89,1,2.0,4/22/2010,"BJ's Blows... I have given this place a few tries and they just can't get it together!  For this particular visit, let's start with, why, at lunch time do they only have one person behind the bar trying to handle all the server's drink orders and take customer food/drink orders?  So, tick tock go 10 minutes of my lunch HOUR before my order gets taken. Skip forward another 25 minutes and my lukewarm, not how I asked for it, order comes out.  I ask for the necessary items and wait patiently for it to arrive and finally say screw it and eat my almost cold food so I can get back to work. This is not the first time I have experienced a similar situation so I am left wondering...is it a problem with the servers, the kitchen, the management or, the worst possible scenario, a combination of all the above?  Regardless, we will not be back to this location-purely LJ for us if we need a BJ (fix)."
Randy W.,"Newport Beach, CA",37,84,35,4.0,7/16/2010,"We arrived for a family dinner and were seated within 5 minutes, on a fairly busy night.  The kitchen took slightly longer than expected to prepare the food, but Janae, our server, kept us apprised of the status, and when the food came, it was actually quite good.  I had a wedge salad and fish tacos, and my wife had a caesar salad and baby back ribs.  Kids had standard fare, and loved the root beer.  I had a tasty pear cider, but the wedge salad was delicious, and I wasn't expecting much from the fish tacos, but it was obvious that they were nicely presented and made.  My wife enjoyed her food as well.  The place was packed, but service was good."
Jaime T.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,2,,2.0,6/8/2013,We waited over 45 min for our food and we ordered as soon as we sat down. Waited 20 min to get a seated seated.
Natalee B.,"Oceanside, CA",84,80,59,4.0,7/9/2010,"Yuuuuummy!! This place has some amazing pizza! I tried the Mediterranean, and it was muy buenos!!! I've had other dishes here too, but nothing compares to this pizza. I also recommend any of their beers. I had the beer sampler, and they were all delicious. :) It's a hoppin place, so plan on waiting most of the time, but it is definitely worth it!!! Four ****'s for BJ's!"
Martin L.,"San Diego, CA",177,183,239,4.0,6/7/2010,Food was good.  Similar to other BJ Pizza places.  What sets this one apart is their selection of beer.  Seems this one has a much wider selection of beer.  They even have 10 Belgium Beers.  One of my favorites.  Will have to some again for more.
Patricia D.,"San Diego, CA",6,8,,1.0,10/6/2010,"I will never come to this place again!!! Service was horrible.. waited half hour till our party was recognized by a waiter. It took at least 45 mins for our food to come out and it wasn't even that great. Now the MOST irritating part was that it took the waitress damn near an hour to get our checks and pay it. My party was so pissed we was about to just get up and leave. The manager or whatever he is (the one in the white shirt) was a straight A-hole and I wanted to punch his ass in the throat! you are better going off going to PF Changs, a few steps away. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. and yes I write that on the reciept!"
Marcel B.,"Vista, CA",0,13,1,1.0,5/16/2013,"Bad service tonight from the start.  First of all there is a guy cleaning windows on the door and he looks at us like ugh go around. Then there is a guy on the phone at the front counter and its like he;s taking a personal phone call chilling. We eventually get seated. Then we get seated and it starts. Takes awhile for our server to greet us. Then I and my fiance's aunt ordered a side salad with ranch. First it takes like 15min. Then they bring out a side salad and a ceaser salad. ugh. Then the waiter walks by and she like what? you still haven't gotten you salad sir? Nope, she went back and finally the guy brings out the right salad. To make a long story short it was a lot of WAITING tonight! and there was only 3 of us and on a thursday night around 8:10pm. I feel bad for the waitress kinda it looks like whoever was helping her tonight was dropping the ball or trying to black male her. All of our stuff was just wrong or really late. While waiting for our pazookie finally enough was enough around 9:48 we decide to get up from our seat and go to the front to talk to the manager. The same guy who was on the phone in the begenning ugh. He looked like he was in a bad mood. Anyways, he tried to give us a $20 gift card. But, ugh really? Not about the money bro... we just wanted some good service. On our rewards account in special instructions it evens says. ""Great Service."" Well I think it will be awhile before my family and even friends go there for awhile for some company Happy Hours or something. This service thing has just happen way to many times. The young waiters & waitress just seem like none of them like their jobs and careless about anything. But yet expect a good tip? Wow. Honestly, I think managment seriously needs to have a meeting with all of their staff. Looks like they're a lot of poor service comments on yelp."
Doug S.,"Coronado, CA",0,6,,4.0,4/19/2011,"Coming here is like Disney Land with beer and lots of TV. My favorite food is the deep dish pizza. I get it everytime and usually try a new beer. There is nothing that beats the pizookie at the end though. I would give it 5 stars, but it is just too unhealthy. My trips here definitely are limited for that reason."
Kent G.,"Eden Prairie, MN",46,14,,4.0,8/31/2010,"Nice atmosphere, great home crafted beer and good food."
Richard A.,"Los Angeles, CA",125,139,705,4.0,5/6/2010,This is a good place to eat with the fam... but the freakin wait for a table and food!!! Really!!! it's like come on!!! hire people with A meaning to work!!!
Landa S.,"Vista, CA",15,42,41,4.0,5/30/2010,"My family and I went here for a belated Mother's Day lunch. Our lunch was awesome and dessert even more amazing! We had mini cheese pizza (yum), fish and chips (yum and good portion size), parmesan chicken (yum) and stuffed potato (yum)! For dessert, we, of course, had a pizookie. I really like BJ's food and for the most part it is always a good experience. If I gave one criticism, it would be that the service was a bit slow. We still had a great experience."
Sara D.,"Carlsbad, CA",17,96,13,4.0,4/10/2010,"We need more new restaurants in Carlsbad!  BJs is a great addition.  Decor is super nice (usually, we get jipped in the North County on the decor - see Changs, P.F.).  Service is great.  Lunch specials are a great deal.  Wide variety of food choices. I just took my in-laws who are visiting from out of state and everyone enjoyed what they ate.  We tried the greek deep dish pizza which was very flavorful.  We also tried the uber cheap bruschetta appetizer.  That was just okay.  We finished with a Pazookie which was delicious.   My only complaint of the evening was that we called and put our names down ahead of time.  When we arrived they told us it would another 20 minutes (it ended up being another 45 minutes).  Ordinarily, I would just go to the bar and have a drink, but we had our 2 year old with us.  Had we known it would be 45 minutes instead of 20, we would've just taken him across the street to the mall to keep him occupied.  It's not easy keeping a 2 year old occupied for 45 minutes and then sitting down to eat with him for another hour or so, so that was a bit annoying."
Katherine P.,"Vista, CA",26,11,16,4.0,10/29/2010,Great atmosphere and delicious food! I highly recommend the deep dish pizza! Was a little pricey and skimpy on the beer though
Eric H.,"Oceanside, CA",119,17,3,2.0,8/3/2010,"Slow unprofessional service.  The food was good, but I've had way better experiences else ware."
Scott H.,"Carlsbad, CA",4,132,1,5.0,11/2/2009,"Just opened this location October 26, 2009 and it is a great place to hang out. They have typical bar food, but the beers they brew are simply amazing. Surprisingly busy, but never had to wait long. Great TV setup for watching sports. Friendly staff. They not only have 7 of their own brews but also have about 20 others on draft. Cannot ask for more."
Leanne M.,"San Diego, CA",11,90,,4.0,4/14/2010,"I went to this location after the Carlsbad 5000 this past Sunday.  I've been to the BJ's in UTC and La Mesa, but never really had the great experience I had at this one.  Our waiter was awesome and the food was really good. The menu is very similar to the Cheescake Factory, so ya can't go wrong -- there's something for everyone.  I was impressed with the beverage selection, as well."
