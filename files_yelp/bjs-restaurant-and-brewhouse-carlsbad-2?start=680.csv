Kim P.,"Carlsbad, CA",2,27,,4.0,11/9/2009,"We ate at BJ's last Wednesday evening late (hoping to avoid the long waits).  We didn't!  Turned out well as we only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table on the heated patio.  I have eaten at BJ's La Mesa and I am a huge fan.  Huge, varied menu.  Everything I have tried has been delicious.  Particular fan of their fish and chips.  Don't get your panties in a bind because the wait is so ridiculous - as soon as they have been there a while you will know when to go and when not.  It's new to Carlsbad, it's good and everyone wants to eat there now.  Don't expect to get there at the dinner hour and get right in.  They do have call ahead service so you can get on the waiting list while you are driving over.  Take out is awesome too."
Scott M.,"Sand Springs, OK",1,16,3,3.0,9/15/2010,"I always eat at the bar during the week. Johnny takes great care of us. Beer is really good and the lunch specials are a good deal. Occasionally the kitchen is slow, but the food is always good. Don't forget the frequent lunch card."
Shannon T.,"Cardiff by the Sea, CA",4,50,1,2.0,2/20/2010,"Wait was 30 minutes Saturday night at 5:15, not too bad. The food was mediocre, took a little longer than average, REALLY loud atmosphere. The killer here is that we ordered a pazookie while we were still eating dinner and twenty minutes AFTER our dinner was over, still no Pazookie. We ended up just paying the bill and leaving with our two yr old still asking where her ice cream was. It seems clear that the extremely long waits are dependent on the dysfunction of the kitchen staff to get meals out in time. Not worth the wait or the drive."
Ed M.,"Oceanside, CA",2,3,,1.0,11/8/2009,"I was really excited to see a new restaurant in Carlsbad. But with all the mishap from calling ahead, host vs. waiters, managers and services it needs a lot of improvements.  I had called a head at 5:45 for 6:30 reservation and my friends ended up waiting for additional 45 minutes. While waiting for our table, I noticed my family was eating at the same place and  were waiting for their foods. While I was chatting with my family, they waited for their foods for about 30 minutes. They received their food prior to the appetizers. They ended up canceling the appetizers.  While I was returning to my group of friends waiting for our table. We were buzzed to be seated; however, while the host was walking us to our booth, another host grab our booth and gave it to another party. We ended waiting for an additional 25 minutes for a table.  We ordered calamari (highly recommend not ordering) and pizzas. Again, they brought the main food (pizzas) without the appetizer. Our waitress was very apologetic and explained that other waitress were grabbing other people orders. Our orders of drinks were screwed up. It took awhile to have a refill of water. The booth that we were sitting on had left over scraps on the floor and on the seats.  As much as I like the location and building, this place is very unorganized and lack-training with the hostess/waitresses."
Jenny S.,"Woodland Hills, CA",29,2,,3.0,8/26/2010,Food good. Overprized mini pizza.  Customer service could be better.
Cryetti C.,"San Diego, CA",14,235,11,2.0,2/27/2010,"i went here once and it was for a birthday with about 16 people. we had reservations at 7:00PM (got there around 6:30 and hung out in the bar area) and were not seated until 7:45 PM. LAME.  they provided us with 2 appetizer platters on the house, and while this was nice (and necessary), still placed a damper on my impressions of this place.  i will admit, that our waiter was very friendly and helpful, so he did a great job.  the food, however, left much to be desired. im not expecting fancy gourmet here.. but the food was hardly appetizing.  i have since forgotten what i ordered.. yes it was that forgettable.  i don't know if will ever return.  if im ever in the area again, i may give bj's another chance."
Aaron R.,"Encinitas, CA",0,19,1,4.0,5/28/2010,First time here and we were amazed at the large menu of food and beers. The staff was on it the whole way. Beers came quick. Avocado rolls for starters were gooood. Deep dish pizza was very tasty. The place was packed on a Friday lunch hour and we couldnt believe how QUICK and friendly the service was. We'll be coming back.
Malia C.,"Oceanside, CA",0,10,,2.0,10/16/2010,"I like going here for the French Dip sandwich. Unfortunately most of my visits have me leaving upset over service. My most recent service was good.  However, I have had some serious issues that a manager never resolved.  I even called their office to report my complaint and they did not return my call!  Do they really care???"
Chris T.,"San Marcos, CA",9,38,,4.0,7/6/2010,"Food is always good at BJs and service is usually very nice.  Usually go here for lunch. Have had many of the sandwiches, salads and a lunch pizza and all were very tasty and fresh. The BBQ chicken salad is my favorite for lunch. Have had a few of the house beers and they were good (not great). Not many places to watch sports on a big screen in North County so we'll be back. Waits are long on weekends so call in advance to get your name on the list."
Tom S.,"San Diego, CA",0,75,,1.0,12/16/2012,"The food and service is good when it's good and horrible when it's bad. Late night service and food sucks. If you can't maintain quality through your service hours, don't stay open till midnight or 1 am; period. Sorry to be harsh, but customers have an expectation of quality at the prices BJ's charges. Done."
Jeremy C.,"Denton, TX",0,28,,5.0,4/18/2010,"BJ's is a great addition to all of North County!  I am so glad that they have opened after visiting them three times in the past three months.  The avocado rolls are great.  We have had good service each of the three times.  The Tomato Bisque is really good, better than Karl Strauss's.   The buffalo chicken pizza is awesome as well.  They have a huge menu.  The Giant Bake Potato's are O.K. for me, we had the Chicken Alfredo ones and it was kind of short on chicken and extras, and nothing compares to a Giant Potato from Mcallister's Deli in Knoxville TN, yet we aren't there now are we?  I will make this one of my regular spots!"
Victor B.,"San Diego, CA",17,70,1,3.0,1/3/2010,"Hello God? It's me and I can't believe what I'm about to say but...the food at BJ's was pretty good, you should try it sometime - - you know, after a long day of work. For you avocado lovers out there, get the Avocado Eggrolls AND the California Club as your appetizers (notice I didn't give you a choice there, go for both!). For the main entree ""Specialty Pizza"" the angels sang. I enjoyed my Buffalo Chicken pizza here more than the deep dish I had in Chicago...I'm putting you on blast Giordano's! Final phrase: Happy Hour!"
candace m.,"Vista, CA",17,151,1,1.0,3/8/2011,"i love BJ's however their customer service is horrible. about 6 mos ago i called ahead to put my name in and to my surprise the wait was only 20 mins! that was great news considering the fact that i was 9 mos preggers and craving their delicious pizza. my husband and i arrived about 10 mins later, we check in and the hostess says ""oh it's gonna be about a 40 min wait"". my response "" i called ahead and the hostess told me it would be 20 mins, why would it be another 40mins if i took the time to call ahead"". snappy hostess then says ""well now its an additional 40mins that you have to wait"". yea no thank you! i understand they are popular and busy but don't offer call ahead if you are inconsistent with times when customers arrive. thankfully pf changs was right around the corner! haven't been back since that incident and quite frankly i don't think i ever will eat their again."
shane s.,"Oceanside, CA",57,22,4,2.0,6/29/2010,"Unfortunately this restaurant is still going through growing pains.  The music is so loud that it hinders the wait staff.  Our food was good, would have been great if not for the fact we got it forty five minutes into our adventure.   The food was luke warm and my beer was not cold.   But my overall complaint is we came in for a birthday party and were there for an hour and forty minutes.  Mostly because we had to wait for food and then wait for our check.   Our poor waitress seemed over whelmed and frazzled, I spoke with the manager who was very nice, he gave me a $20.00 gift card to try them again, but unfortunately I just gave it away, I can't see paying the prices for the lack of service.  I won't try again.  Sorry."
Lola L.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,3,,5.0,6/13/2012,"Seriously, love this place! Jason was our waiter and he was absolutely amazing. I hope you and your boss read this because you deserve some serious praise! Everything was perfect, so perfect, we went back again the next night and it was totally a highlight. Loved the service, food, drinks, atmosphere and Jason! Thank you, keep up the good work and who ever the manager is there needs to give you a raise or paid vacation! Or at least a gift card, you were amazing. Was very attentive, social, polite, a total gentlemen. If i wasnt on a date.. haha teasing. But really, Loved everything about this place. What a great place for a meal."
gordon h.,"Carlsbad, CA",5,172,1,4.0,3/4/2010,"i have been there 2x, and enjoyed it both times.  the food was very good, nice size portions, and of good quality.  yes its loud (high celings) duhh,  yes its busy (new) duhh and might be a little pricey but great selection of craft beers.  theres are good too.  service for me is just fine and never had a problem. i will return. gh"
Susan B.,"Alexandria, VA",93,66,9,3.0,8/22/2011,"ok so if the ratings were based on food alone, i would give it a 4, but it's not, so i had to give them 3 stars.  The food is great.  I love their sandwiches and their deep dish pizza.  I have never been disappointed when I go here.  It's also kid friendly.  BUT the few times I've gone, it's crazy busy and always a line.  i've had bad experiences twice with their bar seating.  One time someone stole a table from us as we were about to sit down and another table as we were waiting for a family to leave they made some nasty remark when I was trying to be polite about it.  so i hate going to this place during busy hrs - weekends and evenings - b/c you only get attitude from the customers in the bar seating area.  not worth it to me.  IF BJ's did a better job of managing their seating arrangements, i feel like this wouldn't happen.  It totally made me not enjoy my meal b/c I just wanted to punch someone.  If you don't like busy-ness and alot of noise, than I recommend you go during the week and during the day.  It's much more pleasant.  I have no complaints about the waitstaff.  They have generally always been good to us.  Especially when one time it took 30 min. for our pizza to come out b/c the kitchen messed up."
Mike D.,"Sydney, Australia",21,16,,2.0,12/21/2009,"Horrible service. I have been here twice now. Once with my gf for dinner and once for a chargers game. Both times the waitresses were clueless and rude. I tried ordering their special drink but they ran out of root-beer, really? Only thing they place has going for it is their large plasma over the bar."
M C.,"Oceanside, CA",0,7,,4.0,3/25/2012,"Great food, great beer. Highly recommend their Ahi Poke appetizer!!!"
D. P.,"San Diego, CA",0,3,,1.0,2/25/2012,"Horrible customer service! Apparently when you call to make a reservation they take your information but fail to tell you that the reservation only lasts for 30 minutes....so, when you show up at the designated time to celebrate your Mother's birthday, they don't have the table waiting....and the idiot hostesses don't bother to apologize or make it right. Don't waste your time here. Easy to forget food and easy to remember crappy service!"
