Lizardfish J.,"San Diego, CA",0,31,,1.0,5/9/2010,"0 stars!!! Aweful food, aweful service, just terrible! How do you make pizza inedible? Go to BJ's and find out. Shakeys pizza buffet has better pizza, and theres is gross! Save your money and your stomach, try someplace else."
Daniel G.,"San Diego, CA",0,5,,5.0,10/6/2011,"Had dinner w/ some friends and sat outside on the patio. The waitress was on top of her game. We ordered pizza and several appetizers all was great. We had several pitchers of beer, no complaints there. Overall great time great food great atmosphere!!!"
Seth G.,"Encinitas, CA",2,14,,2.0,11/20/2011,"Not the best pizza, beer is ok, but far from good.  never had a good waiter/waitress here, always slow and lagging.  Even takeout is horrendous to fight through people and grab a beer at the bar? ughh.  I'd rather go to Oggi's and that's not the best either.  Fries are too salty and really oily.  Salad's are 1000 calories...really?"
Rick D.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,31,,3.0,7/16/2011,"Good food.  Fairly good prices.  We hadn't had their pizza since the early 80s at La Jolla Village Square.  It was surprising how much we enjoyed it, certainly a lot more than when we had it regularly back then.  Want a place that's busy?  Try this place.  Even at 10 on a Wednesday evening the place was packed.  That's good, and that's bad, especially if you'd like a drink at their bar in the late afternoon.  Forget it, unless they start allowing you to drink outside on the sidewalk."

Briana S.,"Oceanside, CA",0,6,4,4.0,2/1/2011,"My man & I have been wanting to try this place out for a whiLe ; just never reaLLy got the chance or had the time . The menu is a little expensive , but there were some good lunch specials . I had the 1 choice pasta (chicken alfredo) & 1 choice soup or salad (caesar salad) . This was one of the lunch specials , and I was expecting it to be such a small proportion that I would finish the whole thing , but I was wrong . The salad was decent , a good size , but you could tell it had been mixed ahead of time . It was a little on the soggy side . Now the chicken alfredo was on point . It was supposed to come with either grilled or blackened chicken , but being the picky person that I am , I asked if they could give me breaded chicken . Let me just say that the size of my chicken was GINORMOUS ! I would definitely order this dish again & I wouldn't be disappointed if the chicken proportion was smaller the next time either . Our waiter ryan let us know that he was still a little new to working at BJ's , but we really couldn't tell . He was very patient (we took a few minutes to decide because it was our first time) , made sure our drinks were always filled , & even offered us dessert options . The cream soda was REALLY good . It was strong & you could taste the quality , just the way my boyfriend & I like it . The dessert was a HOME RUN ! The only thing I had heard about BJ's before going there was how good the pazookies were & lets just say that the people who told me about it didn't give it any justice . We ordered the original pazookie with the white chocolate macadamia nut cookie . As soon as I had my first bite , my life felt complete ! Haha .. you really don't know what's missing in your life until you try a PAZOOKIE !"
AK C.,"San Marcos, CA",1,116,,2.0,9/9/2010,"First I should say that BJ's is one of my favorite restaurants, and my husband and I have been to the Carlsbad location many times since they opened last year. Normally the food is excellent and the service pretty good, but this review is about our visit on 9/5/2010 which was horrible. We have noticed the service getting progressively worse since early in the year. There were 6 of us and we sat outside because there wasn't a wait. It was a Sunday night and pretty cool out, so we asked first if there were heaters and they said Yes. They proceeded to sit us next to a broken heater. Naturally, we asked to move to one of the other open tables that had a working heater and the waitress moved us, although not too happily. We placed our order for an appetizer, 2 salads, and meals for everyone, then waited. The first salad appeared and we asked for utensils. She brought one place setting. The next salad appeared and again we asked for utensils and again she brought 1. Wouldn't it make sense to bring everyone silverware at this point? 30 minutes later the waitress returned to tell us they were out of our appetizer. Um, ok fine, you could have told us sooner but our food almost had to be done by then so we were ok. Nope. We waited another 20 minutes, then my husband went to see what was up. He requested to talk to a manager. The manager stopped by and said they were short on kitchen staff but our food would be done soon. He repeated our order and it was completely wrong. He corrected it and said it would be out shortly. The first meal arrived - a Great White Pizza. Except it was missing tomatoes and garlic. They said they were out of tomatoes. It's a pizza place!! After 10 minutes, 3 other meals arrived. Still nothing for my mother so we told them it was missing, and again it wasn't on the order form - the second time we had told them! About 10 minutes more and her food arrived with a bowl of tomatoes for the pizza! My sister ordered pasta and they forgot sun-dried tomatoes, olive oil and cheese in it. Wow. In the end, they comped our food and only charged us for drinks. It was a complete mess and we were so embarrassed about taking our family there and saying what a great place it was. Too bad, but we will definitely go to La Jolla or Escondido before we try the Carlsbad location again."
Andrew W.,"Oceanside, CA",0,8,,2.0,7/24/2010,"Went with a few friends tonight... After waiting an hour to get seated, we had to wait another 20 minutes for the food to come. My pizza was okay but definitely not worth the wait. Service wasn't great. Probably won't be going back anytime soon."
ryan s.,"San Diego, CA",0,120,,2.0,7/21/2010,We had 1/2 dozen apps and two pizzas. The presentation of the food looked good but the taste was not. The pizza's were undercooked and the spinach dip was some of the worst I have had. The service was friendly and prices seemed fair. Claim jumper/cheesecake factory food MUCH better
Winegirl M.,"San Diego, CA",1,22,,4.0,1/7/2010,"finally a kid and adult friendly restaurant,   food is soo yuumeeee ...  and lots of choices..  we will have to keep going back so we can eventually try everything on the menu.."
Jim P.,"San Marcos, CA",0,18,,2.0,2/13/2010,"Beer is good, service was fine and food is a joke. Ordered wings and a Santa Fe salad as the waiter highly recommended it. Pal ordered a vegi pizza. Wings were 90% those gross vein ridden things that are attached to the drumett part and the entire order only had 2 drumetts in a pile of 12 pieces. The ranch and wing sauce tasted right out of a bottle and are not homemade. The salad that our waitress highly recommended was ok but there was not enough SALAD, it was 50% tortilla strips; seriously. I had a pile of tortilla strips 4 inches high that took up an entire side plate; that left me with what amounted to a side salad with some cold chicken pieces. The dressing was good but not enough on the salad. the vegi pizza was also disappointing; all bread; the toppings and cheese on the entire pizza was what typically goes on 1 slice anywhere else. what a joke, 14 bucks for some frozen bread with maybe 5 ounces of toppings. it seems this is another case of a business growing to fast for it's own good. Go to pizza port and save the money and the agony. WILL NOT BE BACK UNLESS FOR A BEER."
Jennifer G.,"San Diego, CA",0,9,,1.0,12/30/2009,"I must be a glutton for punishment...tried to give this place another chance.  Called ahead to be placed on the waitlist -- was told it would be 20 minutes.  Arrived exactly 20 minute later and was told it would be 25 minutes.  I said that there must be some mistake -- we called 20 minutes prior, asked to be placed on the call ahead seating list, and were told there was a 20 minute wait.  The girl (I'm betting it's Kelly, I wish I would have asked for her name) at the front then told us that we should be happy that we are in the middle of the list and that it would only be 25 minutes --  that they just had a few big parties come in between when I called and arrived...I considered asking to talk with a manager at this point, but my husband found a seat at the bar so we decided just to sit at the bar for dinner.  My husband ordered a beer, we ordered an appetizer (pot stickers) and our meals (one of the jumbo baked potatoes and a beef dip sandwich).  An hour and 20 minutes later we still didn't have any food.  We watched many others who arrived after us get their food. After about 40 minutes of waiting our server (unsolicited) apologized and told us it would be just a few more minutes and that my husband's drinks were on the house (I was drinking water).  At an hour and 20 minutes we asked to talk with the manager and told him we were leaving...he was very apologetic, asked us to wait that our food would be out in just a minute and that dinner was on the house.  We declined.  He gave us a $25 gift card to use the next time we come in ... I think if we use this I'll use it while traveling at a location other than the Carlsbad location."
