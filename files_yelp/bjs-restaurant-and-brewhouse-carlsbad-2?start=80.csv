Courtney K.,"Annapolis, MD",357,1747,2174,4.0,9/20/2015,"Bottom Line:  A big menu, a large selection of drinks but suffering service. What I like about BJ's is that they have a huge menu so there is something for everyone.  Even their signature deep dish pizza isn't appealing to you, you'll have a book of other options from which to choose including appetizers, hearty entrees, small plates and desserts. I'm not a deep dish pizza person but i do really enjoy the parmesan encrusted chicken here and the entree size is large enough to enjoy as a second meal.  Overall, all of the food here is good which is impressive which such a large selection.  The kitchen must be bustling! As implied by the name, BJ's also has a long beer list.  BJ's brews a wide variety of beer which are good but nothing that I crave.  They also have a full bar for those wanting a non-BJ's beer, cocktail or glass of wine. When this location first opened I found the service to be good but on recent visits its been dismal.  The worst service is if you sit on the patio because they seem to forget you are out there."
Ryan M.,"Flagstaff, AZ",158,27,4,1.0,3/26/2017,"The management at this place is a joke!!  I just moved back to San Diego from Hawaii.. Naturally, I'm searching for jobs. I had it pretty good in Hawaii, in terms of work. I owned and operated my own dive company. I have been very successful at selling myself throughout my life, in part due to the 18 years of sales and customer service experience I have obtained through hard work and an unparalleled work ethic instilled in me by my late father.  Last week I came across a job posting from the above company, it was 3 days old, and had several position attached to it. I applied for everything except the bar. With the 8 years of experience in the food industry I have done damn near everything in a restaurant except work the bar.  Immediately following completion of the online app I called the establishment and spoke to Jack. He informed me of what position were still available and asked me to come down and speak to Phong the following morning at 11am. I arrived 10 minute early, waited till they opened and was told right away that Phong wasn't working this day. So I spoke to the Kitchen manager, who didn't give his name and didn't really care to speak with me. He brushed me off and pretty much told me to come back another time.  First off.. my time is just as valuable as yours Mr. Kitchen Manager.. At this point I was discouraged, because I have never sat through a proper interview and not been offered a job. I wasn't about to just waste my morning by going home without talking to someone. So I asked to speak to the opening manager. Who is a complete tool by the way. His name was either Ruiz or Luis idk I didn't really care to record his name in my memory banks because I waited an hour for him to come and talk to me. He didn't come and talk to me out of professionalism that much is for sure. It was out of courtesy because I sat there as long as I did. This guy couldn't even tell me what positions were available.. he also said that he didn't think I had enough experience without even looking at my resume. I think he assumed I was some fresh 20 year old with no work experience (judging from the way he was talking to me) not a 32 year old who has been working since he was 15. Granted I look a lot younger then I am because I live a healthy life style. He made it seem working at BJ's is the peak of a career in the industry. I didn't even bother following up with these clowns. Before I left I took a look at some of the kids they have working there and chuckled because I know I can run circles around them. Rest assured the very next place I went to hired me on the spot. uhhh, because he looked at my resume!! I use to frequent BJ's in grossmont and always favored it as one of my favorite places to eat. I'll never go to a BJ's again because of a complete lack of professionalism. Not surprised your yelp rating is so garbage."
Rebeca A.,"Oceanside, CA",1,39,11,2.0,7/1/2017,"This is the last time I will eat at this location. This Carlsbad location has messed up my phone order for the third time and I'm over it. Our burgers were cooked incorrectly and I had to wait another 30 minutes just to pick up my order. Love the food and atmosphere of the restaurant, but only in Escondido."
Brittany W.,"Cottleville, Saint Louis, MO",0,11,8,3.0,7/15/2017,Bring back the lettuce and honey for the egg rolls   Kinda pricey.  And drinks are weak.
Denise C.,"Beaumont, CA",0,4,2,5.0,2/5/2017,falcons are in the house baby!!!!! The atmosphere here is the best...service is awesome!!!!
Mario M.,"San Diego County, CA",19,16,8,5.0,12/7/2016,For my first time here at this location WOWed me and my date tonight! We loved how they cooked their Ribs and Salmon & the Strawberry Margarita which was very good! Both A Margarita & Slushee Together! To Top it Off was the Bday Dessert was the Cookie's N' Creme Pizookie which was the Best Dessert my Date and I Had !!!
Melissa C.,"South Gate, CA",0,9,,1.0,7/23/2017,No wait time we're seated right away but we ordered our food it came out wrong they sent it back to be remade and came back wrong again! After waiting forever I finally said just forget it the manager couldn't even be bothered to come to our table I would not recommend this BJ's location the server didn't seem to be too bothered about the situation either with her oh well to bad for you attitude horrible customer service!
Benton H.,"Murfreesboro, TN",110,4,3,2.0,7/19/2017,"Not completely terrible but it was definitely not the BJ's that I know, service was extremely slow, our server kept forgetting everything we asked for and it was not even that busy during the time we were there. I love this place and I love this location but tonight was definitely not a night to remember."
Mary E.,"Grand Terrace, CA",40,25,12,1.0,7/14/2017,"Worst experience ever at BJ's! So disappointing bc it was my sister's birthday! The food was not up to par (my moms soup was room temp, salad was wayyyy smaller than other BJ's restaurants and the pizza was blah). The waiter forgot it was my sister's birthday even through I told him as soon as we sat down and had a FULL convo about our day, he never came back to check on us after we were given our food until we were practically done eating (reason why we didn't complain about the food quality, we were so hungry and just kept eating), and refills? Whats that? Didn't get refills even though we were there for TWO hours. Horrible. So disappointed. We should have gone to the Mcdonalds across the street. Yup."
Vince N.,"Quartzsite, AZ",97,48,3,3.0,5/27/2017,Mixed feelings.. Service was awesome and my steak and green beans were really good but the crispy calamari wasn't cooked long enough along with my Brussels sprouts. But all in all I was happy!! My wife said her baked ziti was amazing and my brother in law's ahi tuna salad was amazing!! Great experience as usual overall.. Wish I personally could give it 4 stars but the two items I mentioned above were disappointing..
Tami L.,"Carlsbad, CA",57,245,1530,4.0,3/6/2015,"Been eating here forever.  If you can't find something to eat here, there's something wrong with you! Plain and simple. HUGE menu, tons and tons of choices. Pizza, salads, burgers you name it.  They change the menu often and have specials all the time so you can expect different items from time to time and not the same old boring menu month after month.  Inside and outside dining plus a nice bar area with monitors.  Great place for lunch or dinner."
Erich C.,"Oceanside, CA",542,487,1432,4.0,1/29/2015,"I've come to BJ's in this and various cities for years.  I've always been a fan.  Sure sometimes it's hit or miss depending on how busy the place is but generally I always have a good time and the food is generally consistent. My favs:    *  Bone-in buffalo wings    *  Any burger with wedge-cut fries.  Mmmm...    *  Any BJs beer especially the Grand Cru (Nov-Dec only)    *  Any pizza Today I had the Honey Glazed Scallops.  For having only 360 calories, this dish packs a ton of scallops.  It's good but you can barely taste any honey...which might be a good thing considering the calorie count.  Their ""light"" menu is an easy favorite for most watching their figure. We'll continue to keep coming back to BJ's time and time again.  Join their VIP rewards program to accrue points for that free Pizookie once in a while ;)"
Paul W.,"Oceanside, CA",125,8,4,5.0,5/6/2017,Great service. Kitchen was a little slow. Kept my drink full at all times. Used the perk from Yelp for free dessert! My wife and I sat in the bar and had great service from Vuk! The servers in the bar had great teamwork. With so many items on the menu we'll be back for sure!
F G.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,2,3,2.0,7/1/2017,"We haven't been back to this location for quite awhile as our previous orders were often missing items. The last time we went in we weren't even acknowledged when coming to place a to go order. Today we gave curbside one more try and again got home with an item missing. We also got home to realize our bacon cheeseburgers had no bacon. The staff is typically polite, but I would rather they check their orders thoroughly. I know how busy servers get and sometimes they are doing the best they can, but we have had to drive back or miss out on items we have paid for too many times to not say something."
Marie R.,"Vista, CA",0,17,19,2.0,6/1/2017,I placed an order online today for takeout and was not satisfied with the amount of soup for a chowder bowl that came out to $7.49. I'm not sure if this was a cup of soup or a bowl? Not worth my money.
Mark S.,"Ontario, CA",21,50,52,5.0,5/13/2017,"The best place to get grub and a great beer. Got pizza, and burgers damn good. Plus their 6pack is only $10 buck can't go wrong with that especially for being a restaurant. Will definitely be back!"
Heather B.,"Oceanside, CA",193,18,1,5.0,8/15/2017,"I usually end up coming here about once a week to eat dinner because it's one of the few places open when I get off work.  The menu is huge which means there is something for everyone on there, I usually get the chicken club sandwich which comes with fries and is one of my favorite things but I also love the mahi mahi tacos, flatbread pizza, burgers and of course the pizookie's!!! You can get the pizookie trio which is a good choice if you can't decide which one you want! I have yet to try something that I don't like! As for the service, the hostess' are always friendly which makes a great first impression when you walk in and I usually end up having the same server (Mark) who I have no complaints with!  Mark is definitely one of their best employees, his service is always quick and he always anticipates what I'll need next without me having to ask for it, he's also very knowledgeable about the menu. I also came into contact with a new employee named Connor who was a busser if I remember correctly! I flagged him down to ask him a question and although he mentioned he was new, he was very friendly and he had an answer for me which made it seemed like he had worked there for some time already! They also have a loyalty program you can sign up for special deals and discounts. Overall great restaurant and always a great experience."
Chrystle B.,"Bonsall, CA",70,4,,1.0,2/24/2017,Wow!  I really didnt even want to give one star but I could not procede if i didnt give at least one.  So here goes.... We arrive on a busy Friday night and were told if we wanted to sit on the heated patio its not as busy....so we said sure as long as its warm!  Haha warm is a joke and not as busy was even a bigger joke.   We waited 15 min for a server to even come out to take drinks and we placed an appetizer order of potato skins and a few drinks and our kids order.....she brought the drinks and then took our meal order. About 10 min later the kids meal....still waiting for appetizers.  30 min later still waiting for appetizers and food.  Oh yay finally our cold burgers and fries came to the table but no potato skins....the server says do u still want them?  Umm no we now have our meal....its cold but we are now eating kinda pointless to get the appetizer now.   Not even half way done with our meal and she brings the check and boxes and kindly says i had the manager take the potato skins off since u never got them....oh how nice of you REALLY....thats a given im not about to pay for food that I didnt eat.  Sorry should not have even paid for the cold ass burger but i did.....so PISSED....we will skip BJs Carlsbad the next time we are in the area!!!
B L.,"Oceanside, CA",15,7,1,2.0,6/18/2017,"Went here yesterday for dinner. Horrible it took 2 1/2 hours. The girl that served us was rude. 2 of us got salad that was wilted. Looked like it was under a heat lamp. Then returned it and we got hamburgers instead that the buns were so greasy gross. Friend had steak that was all fat and raw. The ribs were great and mac n cheese and guacamole. You go out to be waited on. We had to ask for refills, napkins everything. It was a birthday celebration and she didnt make him feel special. This girl should have 2 tables bad, bad bad she was horrible. Where are the food runners? You need more people to fill drinks etc. We spent all together close to 350.00 better to go fast food place. Not a good experiance. Used to be my fav place"
N S.,"Oceanside, CA",0,53,125,1.0,7/23/2016,"This is just a review for the take out.. We had 3 orders of pizookies to go. The wait For a table was a little too long and we all just wanted pizookies so we ordered it to go instead. For one, it took them over 30 minutes to get out orders out. We get home 10 minutes later and saw 2 sad looking regular size chocolate chunk pizookies. They didn't even bother to put enough cookie dough to cover the entire small tray. (picture posted).  The mini peanut butter pizookie looked fine.  Came time for us to finally eat these pizookies... Both cookies were way too undercooked. If I wanted cookie dough in a tray, I could have made that myself for less than $8 each! Such a disappointment. How can you mess up cookies??? And having a really busy night is not an excuse!!! It's a damn cookie baked in its own pan!!  Any other time we've ordered these, they have always been delicious. Never again.. And may not go back due to the lack of quality. Of they don't bother to check the quality of a small order, how much do they pay attention to the bigger orders? In my case, the little things DO matter!!!"
