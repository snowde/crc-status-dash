Evan B.,"Raleigh, NC",247,4,1,4.0,8/17/2017,"Tonight, I went to BJ's with two friends.  We had all had negative prior experiences with BJ's with errors made with our orders.  We decided to give BJ's one more chance before writing it off permanently. The customer service tonight definitely won us over, and we will be back!  We alerted the server about our concerns from previous experiences, and she was very understanding and sympathetic to our situation.  Also, she alerted the manager about these concerns.  Later, the manager personally came over to our table and sat with us for several minutes, listening to our concerns and questions.  He made sure that our food came out just how we ordered, and checked on us periodically to ensure that we were doing well.  Our server was polite and helpful throughout the evening, too.   You can't beat BJ's extensive menu!  It is a little overwhelming, but there are all sorts of options, from healthy to sumptuous.  The food we ordered was satisfying, and the Pizookies (spelling?) we ate for dessert were out of this world!  My only complaint about tonight was the length of time for our food to come out.  We waited 25+ minutes for our order.  I even saw at least one table that ordered after us get served first.  Despite this issue, everything else about tonight was spot-on.  We will definitely be back."
Kristen K.,"Cary, NC",107,181,28,3.0,12/1/2017,"Came here for a friend's birthday dinner so it was a table of around 8. The menu is overwhelming. I swear it was 20 pages, so there is a lot to wade through. Was a little hard to find exactly what you're looking for and took awhile to even decide because of all the choices. Service was great. Our waitress was kind, answered questions well, and was very prompt. I got the Barbeque Bison Burger which is part of the ""enlightened"" section. It was pretty good. Not the best burger I've ever had, but it was cooked perfectly and was pretty yummy.  Portion size was very generous. Everyone at the table was very pleased with their meals. My favorite part? Dessert. The Salted Caramel Pazookie was delicious. I absolutely want to come back and try more."
Valerie Z.,"Raleigh, NC",56,36,55,3.0,10/16/2017,"I recommended bj's to my visitor. Been to other ones before and love this place.  But last night we were all really disappointed. Half the menu items were not available. Ex: no mash potatoes for the chicken dinner or green beans, several pazzokies (the only ones I would have ordered), prime rib...which js my favorite. But it wasn't even busy.  I do like that the proceeds of the pazzokies was going towards hurricane relief but that wasn't told to us until we asked why they were discounted. Just a little disappointed.  Our server was great though. He recommended the pumpkin ale with a shot of fireball...omg...a must try! Loved it.  The parm crusted chicken...unbelievably delicious (would've been better with mashed potatoes and green beans but...). I would love to try this with mashed potatoes I bet it will be my new favorite. The chicken tacos...meh, they lacked a lot of flavor and the tziki sauce didn't help. Wouldn't order it again.  Hickory brisket burger...delish. ordered sweet potatoe fries yum! Not a lot on the dish so for the money maybe not. The other people in my party ordered regular fries and they were very generous."
Pj C.,"Cary, NC",0,11,,2.0,9/19/2017,"One of the worst places I've eaten at since moving to NC. I was so excited to try it and heard great things about it. The drinks (alcoholic) cake out super fast, which in our experience never happens it always takes them a little while to get you your drinks from the bar. When we ordered our drinks we put in an appetizer order, the waiter came back about 5 minutes later (we asked for time to look over them menu) and then placed our entree order. About 15 minutes later still no appetizer, the waiter then says he is going to go check on it. Out comes the appetizer *cold as ice* and not even 2 minutes later come our entrees. Which explained why the appetizer was cold, cause it had been sitting there waiting to be brought out for a while. However both entrees were ""warm"" at best, the ""pulled pork"" on the sandwich I ordered wasn't even pulled pork it was chunks of pork on a stale bun.  We wanted to order the churro dessert they had but decided it would be better to leave."
LeAnne W.,"Wake Forest, NC",48,78,63,2.0,8/25/2017,"I was in Cary and thought I would try some place new. Well I should have checked the yelp reviews before I stopped for lunch. It was disappointing. I was greeted quickly and seated quickly. My server was also prompt. I ordered the Prime Rib Dip. It was disappointing. There were large chunks of fat on each and every piece of meat. So much so that I had to go through the entire sandwich before I could eat. After picking all of the fat, I had enough meat for 1/2 the sandwich. Not good. I did tallboy my server who called in the manager. They offered me more food , but I declined. I'd that meal came out of the kitchen, I am not quite ready to try again.  Everyone was kind and polite which is why I am willing to give two stars. I will try this place again because everyone can have an off day."
Nicole F.,"Raleigh, NC",157,59,71,2.0,8/4/2017,"I really wanted to love this place due to the extensive menu options. Not happening. Tonight's dinner came with dirty Napkins. Not just one rolled napkin, but both of our Napkins bosted of different stain varieties. The staff is enjoyable, but the food is just O...K... Two visits within two weeks and so underwhelmed. The multi paged menu boasts of sumptuous dishes of a varied sorts such as deep dish pizzas, lighter calorie menu options, superfood options, Cajun varieties and more. The unfortunate part is that the food comes out of the kitchen looking nothing like the pictures or the way the menu describes. Kitchen staff on each occasion manages to omit or add something different that what was ordered.  If I return, (which will only be because the manager was kind enough to take care of our disappointing meal tonight) it will be to order an appetizer and enjoy the extensive tap beer selection. No more sad plated meals here for me."
Julie C.,"Washington, DC",26,140,116,4.0,7/10/2017,"One of my only complaints about BJ's is that the menu is way too extensive! It was very difficult to choose what I wanted - sometimes too much variety is not a good thing!  I ended up splitting the appetizer platter with a friend and it was good. The stuffed mushrooms (ordered separately) were amazing and I wholeheartedly recommend. The wings were fine - not standout, and I did not like the avocado egg rolls. Even for someone who loves avocados, what a weird concept. The burger was cooked well and tasty, and I heard the cocktails were nice. The handcrafted sodas are great and the beer menu is extensive and also great. Good specials and pricing on all items."
Ron W.,"Raleigh, NC",791,913,5920,3.0,12/26/2016,"If you're looking for beer and bar food near Cary Crossings, you can do far worse than the new BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse. Located near the old Golden Corral, BJ's offers up a huge selection of sandwiches, burgers, plates and pan pizza for Caryites! I've stopped in twice and had a good BBQ brisket burger along with an excellent pizza.  Decor at BJ's is modern and open, there's one large dining room with an enclosed ""patio"" area for more sunlight. It can work for a date, small group or family meal but not as well for large groups. Service is the achilles heel here at BJ's. The servers are a bit inexperienced and they deliver a mixed experience for your meal. But they are trying! So 3 stars for BJ's right now but I may change my mind after trying their signature Pizookie dessert some day...."
Heidi B.,"Cary, NC",0,8,,2.0,12/28/2017,"I really want to like BJ's brewhouse, as it's super close to my home. It's a nice building and interior. However, the food and service are very uneven. I've had a couple of decent meals, but most of the time - despite the really huge menu - the food is not very good. Also, the servers can either be fast and efficient or excruciatingly slow... even when the place is half empty. I recommend culling down the menu and really specializing in some things you guys can actually cook really well, and to the management: please train your wait staff better and make sure you have adequate staffing on busy nights."
Will M.,"Cary, NC",15,101,68,5.0,12/10/2017,"First check in but have been here a few times already.  Great bartenders with Rhonda and Megan. Unfortunately one of them is a Patriots fan but she's very attentive and makes the guests feel extra cared for and comfortable.  She even put the sound of the game for me before.  Today, Megan was at the bar and also extended me the upmost courtesy. She even made me a mojito with vodka instead and it was delicious.  Most importantly my team won, Hala Madrid"
Olivia P.,"Raleigh, NC",16,128,284,2.0,10/27/2016,"Friday night dinner. Wait time of 50 minutes for party of 2. The place was absolutely packed but we did squeeze into two spots at the bar after a few minutes. Had drinks at the bar while we waited for our table.  DÉCOR-A Cool industrial brew house décor and lots of tables. BARTENDERS-A Bartenders were nice and did a great job with a packed bar. FOOD-D Bf had a barbecue bison burger and he said it was good. I did like his fries. I ordered Parmesan crusted chicken breast served with pasta alfredo. It had all the flavor of eating invisible food. Harsh but true, there was zero flavor. They do serve huge portions but I didn't eat much and didn't take the leftovers. It was reminiscent of high school cafeteria food when the lunch ladies tried to get fancy.   *In their defense, I basically came to a sports bar and ordered Italian food which is a bad idea on my part but if it's on the menu it should at least be decent* SERVICE-F Service took a looooooong time. We came in around 5:45pm and left exhausted and unfulfilled around 9:00 or slightly thereafter. We actually sat at the table discussing how long it took to order, get the food, get drinks, get the check, etc. Server made some mistakes with the food and refilling drinks but he was new so I'll give him a break. I would stop here for a drink at the bar on a weekday but would NOT return for a meal."
Stephanie H.,"Holly Springs, NC",398,909,3016,3.0,10/8/2016,"BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse is a restaurant that has opened in Cary (near Crossroads) in the space formerly occupied by Golden Corral.  For drinks.. Mom went with a mimosa, I would not recommend since it was almost $9 (there are too many brunch spots around with mimosa deals) I decided to try the beers that they brew so I ordered two flights. The beers were okay, if I had to pick a favorite it would be the Harvest Hefeweizen.       -Flight 1: Blonde, Harvest Hefeweizen, Jeremiah Red Ale and a Bourbon Barrel Stout       -Flight 2: IPA, Piranha Pale Ale, PM Porter and Tatonka Stout    For food.. We decided to split the Ahi Poke, Chicken Pot Stickers and Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms. All of the food was good but nothing was great. The Ahi Poke did not have enough avocado in it and the dumpling was too thick on the pot stickers. And, the food took forever to come out but I thought that our server did a great job taking care of us.  The space itself is huge and a good spot if you want to check out a game. The issue I have with some chains is that their beer and food are usually overpriced and this was the case for BJ's."
Tammy M.,"Cary, NC",27,181,264,5.0,9/22/2016,"Couldn't wait for their opening !!  We were immediately seated on a Wed evening.  After glancing at the menu we decided we wanted to try the specials that were only available in the bar seating area.  We switched over to the bar. Our waitress was fabulous !!  She explained all of their ""brewery"" beers and mentioned that they were all $4. (NOT the Octobefest).   The beer was very good.  We tried the boneless wings (buffalo style) and the California Flatbread.  Both were delicious. If you are going to go here and eat/drink be sure and download their APP.  I downloaded while we were there and we got a FREE Pizookie (it was a small one).  This dessert is like ""what"" !!!!!!!  It's so good !!!!  The small one looks like it was baked in an easy bake oven but once you take a bite......""who cares where it was baked"".  This dessert rocks !!!!!   Be sure and give it a try. I believe your YELP App will give you $10 off $35 now.  Give this place a try.  We can't wait to come back."
Abby W.,"Fuquay Varina, NC",56,2,2,5.0,10/30/2017,"Bj's is by far my favorite restaurant! There's something for everyone on the menu. Food is INSANELY good! I get a new thing every time I go and I'm never disappointed. Takes a while to for food to reach the table, but you've got to consider how big their menu is. SAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT! The Pazookies are to die for!"
Chad M.,"Raleigh, NC",67,77,20,3.0,4/30/2017,"We went in as the first guests on a Thursday. They seated our party of four at a tiny booth, I came later in the party and told them we would be moving to a larger booth. They seemed a little peeved that I did this, but I really would rather be comfortable. Our waiter was a little creepy, I felt like he was lurching over us. It seems like it could be a decent place if they were super busy, but at this time it was okay. The prices were about what I expected. The food was okay, it reminded of a decent bar food, but not restaurant quality food. I had a club, and it was okay, but nothing special. I ordered a peach tea which was also, nothing special.  The people in my party were okay with their food, but it was truly nothing special."
Bobbi R.,"Holly Springs, NC",0,9,,3.0,12/28/2017,"Our first time here and it was a disappointment. Our bad experience started with the hostess, she was rude, mean, didn't even look up to acknowledge us and just told us our large party reservation was ""table 6 in the back"". - like we would know. This was at 5pm before it was busy. The wings were good, the ribs were good, but the shrimp arugula tacos were so over priced, $ 11.25 for 3 baby shrimp and done arugula- no guacamole, no pico de halo, plain and only 2.  We'll give it another try when we are not with a big party, I hope the tiny, braided hostess will have been trained to be courteous."
David S.,"Raleigh, NC",2,120,89,4.0,9/18/2016,"I've been here multiple times now and service is now much better. Food has always been great and the staff helpful.  Pro tip: use the app to check in, order, and pay for fastest service."
Kat G.,"Raleigh, NC",1,54,158,5.0,4/12/2017,"Great service, food and ambiance! Daily specials are great! I have had various plates and haven't been disappointment! Wings are the best!"
Cindy G.,"Apex, NC",144,518,2696,4.0,4/8/2017,Came here for lunch and good thing since prices are a little higher than average. Lunch is until 3 pm. I ordered unlimited soup and salad. Server was very nice and attentive. I was able to order a couple of different soups. The lentil soup was hearty and flavorful and the tomato bisque had good texture. The tomato and mozzarella salad was tasty with nice presentation. Hubby's fries came out hot and crispy and he enjoyed the chicken fingers. Amazing selection of beers including hard ciders. Lots of beer on tap. TVs throughout restaurant but not noisy. Seats were extremely comfy if you choose a booth. Very clean place.
Carol T.,"Swansboro, NC",18,8,,5.0,9/19/2017,Excellent. Food was great. Service was great top shelf ! Menu was extensive. Talk about choices !  My so. Recommended this place to us and we were not disappointed. It was amazing! A bit pricey for us but delicious and again the service was excellent   I would def recommend! If you like beer don't miss this spot -- too many choices ! Is that possible ?  Enjoy!
Kimberly H.,"Garner, NC",30,136,44,2.0,2/11/2017,"Your typical chain restaurant that is a bit pricey for what you get.  The good.. +: They brew their own beer, it was neat being able to try some of their beers. I really enjoyed the Berry Burst Cider.  +: Service at the bar has always been fantastic, no complaints there.  +: The Chicken Pot Stickers, Stuffed Mushrooms and Root Beer Glazed Ribs were good The bad.. -: The menu feels like a 5 lb weight, it is way too large and overwhelming -: Food is SLOW to arrive -: Ordered the Ahi Poke appetizer, the picture shows it with an even mix of tuna and avocado; however, when it arrived it was topped with TWO tiny pieces of avocado (perhaps they were running low in the kitchen? The people sitting next to us complained about this as well) -: The Sriracha Queso was NOT good, it was too gritty tasting For the overall experience and price, you can definitely find a better restaurant for a lot cheaper."
Bill L.,"Apex, NC",0,13,4,2.0,7/27/2017,"Have wanted to stop here for quite a while, as it has a classy look that at least presents as an ""upper-end"" sports bar / gastropub. The first time I had tried to eat here they were just opening up and had a private party that night.  Unfortunately, my first experience was not up to par with what I had hoped it would be. The recent comments about having to wait a long time were not the case for me, as I was seated upon arrival and it was 7:45 pm - prime time for dinner and after work drinks for most, so that was certainly a plus. I got a table in the bar area and the noise level is fairly high, as one would expect in a sports bar type setting.  Unfortunately, speed of service at a restaurant has some potential negative consequences as the food staff tries to ""rush"" orders out. I had ordered a healthy salad with Cajun shrimp on top (fairly simple request and dish to make). When it arrived you could very easily see that about half of the shrimp were still raw, as they were gray like when you first remove them from the freezer raw.  Since my grandfather was a chef, I eat at restaurants all over the country, and I owned and ran my own food & environmental testing wcompany for many years that did ""mock"" health inspections for restaurants - I spotted the issue right away and called the waitress over. She was very apologetic & commented that it did not look right to her when she brought it out either. Since the largest section of the shrimp is what was still under cooked and grey, it is likely that they had pulled the shrimp right out of the freezer and threw it onto the grill, and thus the thickest part failed to cook as well as the tail section while it thawed on the grill. She returned it to the kitchen to get it corrected. Shortly thereafter the manager also came over to apologize and said that he would have it fixed as well (all good and appropriate actions). The new salad came out and was done correctly, with the shrimp pink but not rubbery from being over-cooked either. The manager said he would swing by to check when the new salad came out - but that never happened.  Since I was curious to see what, if anything, they may do for sending me undercooked shrimp (a good restaurant will offer discount, free drink or dessert, or coupon with request to ""please"" return) - I ordered strawberry beignet for dessert. Though it was certainly tasty, and probably not worth all the added calories, the center of it was raw dough as well and needed a few more minutes of baking time - again, a negative result of trying to rush the food out - likely because of prior negative comments on Yelp about waiting time. Fortunately, a piece of slightly raw dough generally won't cause a food sickness, unlike the havoc that some raw seafood can cause for a visitor. All said and done, the waitress did once again apologize and even removed the desert from my bill, as she felt bad about the raw shrimp. I always feel bad when a waitress does that as clearly the issue is the cooking staff at this restaurant. However, since she had noticed that it did not look right it may have saved her some trouble to toss it back at the kitchen staff before it came out to the table. Not sure if they have someone running the kitchen area or not but that would be a recommendation to hold the cooking staff accountable for the quality of what they're sending out - before it reaches the table. Running a successful restaurant in today's economy is quite a challenge, thus I try to weigh that reality when doing my reviews. Unfortunately, something like a foodborne illness can destroy the hard work and effort that an owner and their employees have put into building a new restaurant - so I felt that 3 stars would understate the importance of not sacrificing food quality and safety in the interest of appeasing some people who are not patient enough to wait for their food to be prepared properly. There is a lot of great food on the menu, but if someone gets sick from it all of the effort is for nothing. Far better to make someone wait and to give them a dish that has them telling their friends how great it is then to cut corners and risk of foodborne illness. It should also be noted that the staff was very friendly. However, with the Carolina Ale House being right next door I had really hoped that this would take it to another level especially when considering the prices. With tip I spent $20 for a salad. Unfortunately, the Ale House has them beat in terms of overall quality of food as I've eaten there many times and have yet to have a bad experience. A little more focus in the kitchen on the quality of the food would allow them to quickly raise the bar."
Gina B.,"Raleigh, NC",234,334,,4.0,2/20/2017,"I was over the moon when BJ's opened in the space where Golden C used to be. Finally, somewhere a little nicer than Carolina Ale House to dine. I've been at least a half dozen times now.  Pros: Happy house appetizer and pizza specials. Large menu (think Cheesecake factory), gluten free options - including delicious pizzas, LARGE portions and good food.  Cons:Service is inconsistent. eg... one day the staff will tell you this is how they make a drink or what's in a dish or how they charge the next it's the opposite? Very frustrating for a regular customer. And it's often slow. The food is also pretty pricey for brewhouse fare. Don't be surprised when you get a salad and one drink and the tab is $30+. ouch. No outdoor seating. What? You guys couldn't wrangle that from the City of Cary? Pity.  That all said, this will not stop me from coming back. The service can only get better."
Lindsay R.,"Raleigh, NC",173,6,17,5.0,9/7/2017,"BJ's almost always has a wait around dinner time, which can be frustrating, but I understand why. It is completely worth it! They have great drink specials (and awesome beer), delicious appetizers, and something on the menu for everyone! I haven't had a dish here that I didn't like, which is pretty incredible considering how big their menu is. If you go, you HAVE to try their brussel sprouts. I've brought friends here that hate brussel sprouts and these completely changed that for them."
Becky D.,"Knightdale, NC",0,28,14,1.0,10/28/2017,"Awful, awful, awful. The ""Chicago-style"" pizza is the equivalent of a Pizza Hut pan...except Pizza Hut tastes better. The sauce was disgusting. We couldn't even eat it! The waiter took it upon himself to make changes to our requested toppings without asking or notifying us. We called him out on it. The steak was incredibly tiny. The only positive aspect of the meal was the tender calamari. Huge disappointment."
Lindy P.,"Raleigh, NC",242,342,535,2.0,11/22/2016,"Yeah, no. More like 1.5 stars. I came here for a work dinner a couple weeks ago & was sorely unimpressed.  Located in the Cary Crossroads area near Petsmart, BJ's has a great idea & concept, but it's the epitome of an American chain restaurant. With a 19 page menu, what could you possibly perfect when your kitchen has 19 pages of meals to make?!  At least they brew decent beer...  The service was interesting, at best. We had a guy taking drink orders but deferred all food questions to a female server. With 15 guys & 2 girls at the table, the server made it a point to say ""Ladies it's 1/2 price wine night!"" (assuming guys don't drink wine?! or that ladies only drink wine?). Anyway, no thanks- I like bourbon neat. The drink guy didn't know what Basil Hayden bourbon was (& it was at the top of their bourbon list). A plus is that you get 2 free tastes of their drafts, which I enjoyed the stout (though on nitro, not my fave). With the crazy service going on, it took 30+ minutes for everyone to fully order a drink. Maybe you need 30mins to read the novel of a menu? After our drinks all arrived, we slowly got appetizers & the food runners would just come to the dining area & holler out what they had - not even to the right table or anything. WTF? To boot, the apps were just like an Applebee's samplers- nothing special... in fact, some things were really weird (i.e. parmesan cream coated boneless wings). For my entree, I ordered a ribeye cooked rare with a side of mashed potatoes & a caesar salad. The salad came out at the exact time of my entree, and I think it was warmer than the steak & potatoes combined. The plating was awful (an ice cream scoop of potatoes & a dry ass ribeye). All in all, this was just terrible. I'd say the service was some of the most horrendous I've had in a while, but man, that steak was atrocious too. It wasn't Applebee's priced either (think $25 for the ribeye). We were there for 2.5hours & not by choice, so I can't say I'd willingly make it back to this place.  Noooope."
David P.,"Cary, NC",23,142,11,4.0,1/10/2017,"Braved the Winter Weather on Saturday going to BJ'S for the first time. (Located in the Old Golden Corral) Kudos to BJ's for being open during the ice storm. Had a large party, 6, and our Customer Service bar was set low due to the extenuating circumstances. Fairly large restaurant offering tons of food items and beer. Server was fairly attentive and our wait for our meals was not inordinate. I ordered Jambalaya which was cajun goodness. My friend had Soba Chicken and a Piranha IPA, and she was very satisfied with both. We will return, hopefully we will not need a Bobsled to get there next time."
Robin O.,"Penn Yan, NY",7,1,,1.0,9/9/2017,First time for lunch Food was not prepared as indicated in menu.   Had the Roasted Portabella  salad and the Mushrooms were never roasted.   Chunks of uncooked mushrooms.  Was not very tasty.    Chopped salad came without the onions on top asked the server to bring them 20 mins later she brought them.    We didn't complain but for me I wouldn't try again especially after reading other reviews which we wished we read first so that we were on alert !!!!
Katharine B.,"Cary, NC",228,635,5674,4.0,12/7/2016,"I met some friends after work for drinks and dinner and I was really impressed with BJ's. I was fond of Golden Corral as well and the transformation of the space was night and day. The new BJ's building is very modern and is situated in the same parking area as Panera and Aveda  at Crossroads. The glass edifice is very noticeable and a friend pointed out this chain of restaurants is from Texas.  We went on a Tuesday night and went during prime time. We were seated in a booth near the bar and had a view of the restaurant and TVs by the bar. The bar as well as the dining area were busy and I was surprised how quiet it was. Most bars and restaurants are so loud that it is difficult to talk amidst the noise. We also went on a Tuesday so all wines were half-price (score!) I had a very generous pour of La Crema Pinot noir for under $8. For my entree I had the tuna salad and it was a healthy and fresh choice. My friends had the flatbread pizza and it was thin crust with toppings. I liked the boards showing the beer offerings and believe BJ's has its own beer from Texas? I also noticed local taps like Fortnight from Cary. The food menu is very extensive with burger choices, steaks and plenty of options. I admit I am sometimes leery of chain restaurants and really enjoyed my meal. I am definitely coming back on a Tuesday!"
Sam Z.,"Raleigh, NC",167,142,,4.0,12/6/2016,"Been to BJ's Brewhouse twice now and am very impressed. For a typical ""bar-food"" restaurant, it has blown me away. The food is very good - some of my favorites have been the guacamole and flatbreads. Even better than the food have been the drinks and specials. If you like local brews, this place has lots of options that they feature, are happy to give samples, and even do 4 flights for only $6! The wine options were pretty good as well. What I like most about this place is the atmosphere. It's busy but not too loud. Also, unlike several other bar-type, casual restaurants, it's nice inside and you feel like there's good natural lighting, it's well-maintained and has nicer furniture. Definitely a great spot for casual dinner and drinks in Cary."
Kristen D.,"Lillington, NC",83,46,9,5.0,6/29/2017,I ate here tonight with one of my really good friends. I was really impressed. Our waitress was great and very helpful since it was my first time. I decided on a flight of their house brewed beers and I really enjoyed them. Their new Nit Wit beer is really good! We started off with avocado egg rolls which were to die for. The sauce was amazing. Then I got the bacon cheeseburger with fries and substituted a turkey patty. The patty was obviously house made and so juicy. I would definitely go back!
Vanessa D.,"Washington, DC",49,221,529,3.0,12/23/2016,"Disclaimer: this rating is for the slow service more than anything. Still very much enjoy eating here. The main difference in my rating this time was the service. Though our waiter was very nice whenever we got his attention, having him come by our table was a tough one. They were very busy and clearly under staffed. So I just reached out to the manager who was glad to step in and take our drink orders after we had sat for 10min with no one coming up to us. It was about 20 min (since sitting down) when our waiter came with our drinks and asked us what we wanted to eat. I just know, had I not gone and gotten someone to take our orders, we'd had sat there much longer without seeing a single waiter. At the end, he, for whatever reason, had issues with my bj's rewards cards so now I'll have to call up the restaurant to make sure I get my points. Either way I still enjoyed coming by. I had the stout again, still delicious. I ordered garlic parmesan chicken wings. Those were disappointing. The chicken was delicious, but being a garlic parmesan fiend, the barely-drizzle-of-the-sauce on top was rather disappointing. Ate them all anyway. My friend had the open faced burger. That was delicious as well. Overall will still come by. Just be alert about very slow service at peak hours"
Peter I.,"Cary, NC",20,3,6,1.0,1/20/2017,"The good.. Our server, Sara, was great, attentive, trying really hard.  Beer was good. The bad.. The food.  Don't bother.  Awful food.  $11.95 for very small portion way overcooked calamari.  Hamburger was like a child portion.  French fries were like potato sticks.  The worst part was waiting for a $14.95 pizza that took 45 minutes.  Reason..?  They said they dropped it on the floor.  No comp for the wait.  When the pizza was served it looked like a  $5 pizza.  Terrible food service.  We will NEVER NEVER EVER return.  Did I say it was terrible..??"
Matthew L.,"Clayton, NC",7,92,35,4.0,9/18/2017,"Unlike your typical brewhouse/pub, this has a great menu selection.  I had the ahi tuna salad.  Can't remember something so healthy on a brewhouse menu.  Great selection of beers, including their own.  Would go back if I was in the area."
Julie T.,"Morrisville, NC",14,10,,2.0,5/26/2017,"I've visited BJs twice now with a small group of ladies on a Friday after the lunch rush. This restaurant is now off our list of choices. Both times we waited about 40 minutes for our food. Both times someone's order was wrong, and the others in the group were done or almost done with their meals before the issue was corrected.  The food is tasty once you get it, but pricey.  Also, they went from very good skinny french fries to a slightly thicker version. Our waiter told us its because the skinny fries got cold too quickly. The new fries aren't nearly as good, one of our group said they tasted like fries mashed potatoes. I only gave it 2 stars because the sandwich I ordered was tasty."
Stephanie H.,"Fuquay Varina, NC",60,272,322,2.0,10/9/2016,"I wanted to love BJs because I have great memories eating with my husband here (we went to the location in Columbus).  Things started out well. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. We had the Brussels sprouts appetizer and it was really flavorful. I ordered a small BBQ chicken pizza, my husband ordered tacos, my mom ordered a burger. The wait was excessive. Our waitress brought my mom and husbands enterees and told me that someone else took my pizza. Welllll then. She offered something else but I declined thinking it wouldn't take long at all to make my pizza. I was wrong. Finally a manager came over and said the pizza was on him and I took him up on his offer of something else. I asked for tortilla soup and said we'd need to take the pizza to go...our son's bedtime was creeping up.  The tortilla soup was soooo salty that I didn't eat it - I couldn't. Didn't bother to say anything because this was turning into kind of a train wreck. Waited more for the pizza and asked for the check. An hour an a half total spent here and I can't say I would go back. My pizza ended up not tasting great, the soup wasn't good, and overall it left a bad taste in my mouth (no pun). My husband liked his and our waitress was so sweet and apologetic which is why I'm giving 2 stars."
Martin S.,"Raleigh, NC",57,164,58,4.0,3/18/2017,"Definitely a fan. I was happy to try this location as I've enjoyed the Ohio location quite a few times. If you LOVE beer, hell, even like beer, come here. I really enjoy the Oasis Amber. The menu is filled with something to please any palette and emotional need. When I'm traveling I look forward to a decent meal in a relaxing setting. For me, that's the North Beach Mahi-Mahi and Shrimp. I substitute Quinoa for the Couscous, which they don't charge extra and they've never made a mistake."
Jeff S.,"Cary, NC",146,301,105,4.0,10/19/2016,"Very much like this chain. The beer and food are both way above average for your run of the mill sports bar. They brought out a kids appetizer gratis, which was a life saver - big time kudos! This location feels smaller than others I've been to? The place was packed on a football Sunday, but they were able to seat us in less than 20 minutes. They have their beer, but also a very respectable draft list from other breweries. I definitely recommend you try their beers though - they should all be on Untappd. One last thing - love that they had some lower calorie meal options."
Jeana H.,"Cary, NC",18,17,102,3.0,3/16/2017,"The food is decent, I ordered a bacon cheese burger. The best part of it was the fries, love them so tasty had a nice crunch to it. The service need more improvement. Took so long for us to get the food or get the attention from the server, other then that this restaurant is great."
Taylor M.,"Cary, NC",0,137,1,2.0,4/9/2017,"I've now tried a couple of these chain restaurants and the service and food have proven to be spotty at best.  The local Cary version is OK for what it is, but I guess I'm not into what that is anymore.   Any time a restaurant boasts about the breadth of their menu, run the other way.  They proudly pointed out to our party the voluminous menu.  As I have stated before, I'd rather eat at a place that crafts six dishes very well than a place with a monster menu. There is no kitchen in a chain restaurant yet designed that can make that many diverse meals consistently good.  Just like Cheesecake Factory, BJ's is another case in point.  Their beers are just OK, and there's nothing spectacular or really interesting about them. The trend in modern taverns and pubs is to have a variety of beers from a variety of brewers. At BJ's, it's just not fun to have their house brews foisted on you.  They make a lot of styles, but like their food, the quantity works against quality.   The food we had was bland bar food.  I've made the mistake of ordering food like jambalaya in places like this, because I knew it was guaranteed disappointment.  They can barely whip up a burger.   The waitstaff was indifferent if not totally inefficient. I assume there is lots of turnover in the waitstaff ranks and likely the kitchen as well.  It just comes off as one of ""those"" places.  It looks like the type of place you can convince your elderly, teetotaler aunt to go on Sunday afternoon, so at least you can grab a couple beers.  Atmosphere is basically a glorified Applebees.  Who though this was a great idea for a chain?"
