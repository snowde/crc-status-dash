Rob R.,"Cary, NC",0,21,,5.0,12/31/2016,We had the best server in RDU area. She new the menu and was helpful on food selection for our visit. What a fresh idea. Have been visiting this location and will go back again.
LA J.,"Cary, NC",0,48,,2.0,12/2/2016,"Hate to say it but, food was just average and the drinks were so watered down I almost sent it back. On a good note, fast and friendly service. But, will not return."
Matt G.,"Tallahassee, FL",0,11,,1.0,11/26/2016,"Awful - I've had better food at counter service restaurants - or from the freezer section at Whole Foods. We came on a Saturday afternoon - the place was practically empty and the service was still slower than slow. The food itself was horrid. We split a couple of their flatbread pizzas, both of which were comparable to Tombstones.  Even though the place was almost empty, we heard others complain as well... Not much else to say. Another worthless chain restaurant in Cary."
Todd E.,"Fuquay Varina, NC",0,17,1,2.0,1/28/2017,We are there in Friday night and the atmosphere was very nice. Our food was the equivalent of Applebee's and the service was average.. not sure I will rush back soon. It was on the pricey side as well.
Daisy B.,"Durham, NC",21,19,1,4.0,9/15/2016,"My friend and I dined at BJ's yesterday- one day after they opened. I had received a promo invitation to dine for free off of a specific menu to check the place out. We were not disappointed. The place is huge, clean, and open. They have a huge listing of beer (and some cider, too) on their board, along with a full drink menu (drinks aren't cheap, but they are creative). Their staff were great and you would not know that they had only opened ONE DAY earlier! Although there was a lot of staff on hand, things appeared to run smoothly and I am impressed at how well they were doing. My friend had the Bacon/Avocado/Cheese sandwich and said it was greasy goodness. I had the buttermilk fried chicken and mashed potatoes. All was very good. Comfort food, not so much bar food, but their entire menu includes burgers, pizza, etc. and everything that people ordered looked great and plentiful. I had a skinny margarita, which was tasty, and my friend had a Bloody Mary that she said was awesome. I hope this place does well and I look forward to returning."
David H.,"Patterson, CA",34,12,1,3.0,10/1/2016,"Good food. Service was awful. Half the entrees arrived  10 minutes after the first ones.  No chicken on the chicken salad. No pizzokie after ordering it. Talked to manager, who took 25% off bill, and promised free pizzokie and another dessert. Waited twenty minutes for that. Welcome to the neighbourhood, you have a long way to go!"
B C.,"Cary, NC",0,29,1,2.0,12/4/2016,"Following a late movie we decided to try BJ's for a few drinks and to snack.  Nice space with good decor.  Thinking they were actually brewing something special (it is called a ""brewhouse"") I was disappointed to learn nothing is brewed there, but they have some specialty beers from a place in Colorado and usual tap offerings.  The in-house brews were really cold and not bad.  The menu is WAY too big and all over the place - burgers, tacos, pasta, ribs, steak, etc.  We ordered some appetizers to share - nothing special and obviously went from the freezer to the fryer.  Service was OK Tame the menu, more focus on fresh and you will have a contender"
Allie G.,"Cary, NC",181,5,,5.0,1/9/2017,"Place is off the chain lol, but no really with its massive beer list, to its amazing funky food gotta check it out please"
Paul S.,"Rocky Mount, VA",96,5,2,4.0,11/6/2016,"Jambalaya not something I normally order in NC, but I have to say they got skillzz.  Light Pilsner was surprisingly good. I shall return."
Jenny J.,"Cary, NC",1,9,,3.0,12/29/2016,"Excited for a new restaurant in this area. It has a large menu with so many delicious-sounding options. However, our service was ridiculously SLOW. Our waiter never came to check on us after our food came out, so we never received certain items missing from our order. The place has been open for a few months, so it seems to late to blame it on being new. I would try it again based  on the food and hope it was just a busy night."
Cinthia L.,"Cary, NC",233,3,,1.0,11/16/2016,"First time here , employees are nice and welcoming not very surprised by they're menu to what the prices are . Got a salmon which was prob one of the most expensive things on the menu , to get a salmon that was pretty much burnt , nice place but wouldn't come again . Or recommend to anyone ."
Tee C.,"Franklin Township, NJ",5,38,40,4.0,10/8/2016,Our waiters were awesome! The food was pretty decent but I think it was overpriced. You are basically paying for the atmosphere and it's not worth it.
Richard D.,"Durham, NC",17,7,,2.0,11/10/2016,"Very much a mixed experience. The wait was relatively short and the ambient noise wasn't too loud. However, the main course came out before our appetizer did, and my order was incorrect. When I told the waiter this, he tried to explain to me that this was in fact what I had ordered. (It was not.) And, nobody came by to check if we needed drink refills until after our plates were cleared. On the positive side, the food was quite good and my nephew enjoyed the freshly made soda. And when they did move to correct my order, they did so very quickly."
Travis W.,"Cary, NC",28,1,,4.0,1/2/2017,The food is really good here. They did screw up a couple of the orders but they made sure that they took care of us and made sure we had everything we needed.
Ally J.,"Knightdale, NC",1,6,,1.0,12/2/2016,"Avoid using the app to preorder your food. Our order was ""lost"" and we weren't informed until we had waited for 30+ minutes.  Also, wait staff is horribly understaffed."
Ashley M.,"Cary, NC",82,25,7,4.0,9/25/2016,"I'm a California native and I frequented BJ's before moving to NC. Needless to say, I was very excited about one coming to the Triangle! My fiancé and I went last night for dinner. There was a wait for a traditional table so we opted to sit in the bar area. We had our order taken promptly and received our food and beer much faster than expected, so that was a plus. Unfortunately, the wait staff in the bar area were wandering around lost, offering us everybody else's food because they were unsure of the correct tables, which was unprofessional at best. There were also some minor flaws with our order (I ordered no tomatoes on my sandwich and got them anyway, etc.) and it took over 20 minutes for us to get our Pizookie. I understand that they just opened and still need to work out the kinks, but the food quality was good enough to balance out the minor flaws. :)"
Donna M.,"Apex, NC",0,13,,1.0,3/16/2017,"Pretty disappointed. Had the Brussel sprouts for an app, undercooked. We waited a long time for our dinner, but they forgot my husbands soup. 5 minutes later they came back and said they were ""temporarily"" out of chowder. I had an entree salad. It was OK. We ordered the salted caramel dessert, but they brought us a peanut butter one instead. It was OK, not what we ordered though. They did take it off the check. Our waitress seemed overwhelmed. The restaurant was clean & they had a nice beer selection. We like the Other Ale House in the same parking lot a lot better."
Jerry V.,"Cary, NC",0,2,,2.0,10/11/2016,"My wife and I have been here twice for lunch since they opened, and took our daughter there for lunch today.  Although we find the wait staff very good, and the food good, today it was ridiculously cold in their  building and even worse in the restrooms. Customers who had heavy jackets or sweaters might have been okay although were noticeably wringing their hands at times. The waiter tried to get the temperature adjusted and we finally asked to speak with the Manager.  He did come and apologize, saying he had reset the temperature - but nothing ever changed We were cold on our first visit, but today was absurd, not sure we will try again, which is a shame. Would rate a 4 if we could be comfortable eating there."
Emma P.,"Durham, NC",0,5,,2.0,10/11/2016,"It was Monday lunch. Eight of my colleagues and I went there. Everything started off great, then the wait for our food started...and continued...and continued. About twenty minutes after ordering, the soups and salad came for those who ordered them as their meal. We thought everyone else's food would be brought out at the same time. Not to be. So while our two colleagues politely sat and waited with us for our food, as their soups got cold, even though we pleaded for them to start eating, our food finally came out about 10-15 minutes later. Our waiter explained, the soups and salads always come out first. Even when we wanted it as our meal? The entire lunch took about 1 hour and 40 minutes, way over our normal 1 hour lunch break. We were hungry, frustrated, and the food was just so so.  Disappointed. I really wanted to like this place. Hope they can get it together and at least provide faster service. They are fairly new, so hopefully they can work out the kinks."
Neil M.,"Cary, NC",3,32,,3.0,2/1/2017,"Got the stuffed mushrooms, tavern pizza, fish tacos and dark chocolate pizzuki. Everything was pretty ok. Service was pretty good. Place seemed packed and the wait was about 45 minutes on a Saturday evening. The bar area sitting is big and we got a table there much more quickly."
