Sarah W.,"Havelock, NC",0,12,6,2.0,4/2/2017,Not a good one. Ordered to go and a 20 min wait I was quoted turned into 40 minutes. My burger was rare (I ordered med-well). I purchased the house beer they offer in the 6-pk. Didn't notice until I got home that they expired over a year ago. I  was very disappointed with my take-out experience.
Christine M.,"Cary, NC",5,51,14,4.0,9/27/2016,"Beers were delicious. Staff had good knowledge of their beers. Only problem was that the place is so new that the staff was extremely confused! We had 4 waitresses in the seating time of an hour because no one knew we already had someone helping us. Waiters were bumping and tripping into and over one another. Other than that, place was great."
Kelli S.,"Raleigh, NC",3,8,26,5.0,1/5/2017,"We have been eyeing this place since it opened a while back, and finally stopped in today.  I tried their house beer, brunutty brown ale, which was actually pretty good.  Think like somewhere between New Castle and Samuel Smith Nut Brown Ale taste wise.  We also got the potato skins for an appetizer, which took a bit to come out, but one of the managers came out and explained that the original ones they made had burned so they made us a new batch.  Nice sized sharing portion, complete with ranch and sour cream on the side for dipping.  My boyfriend got the root beer soda to drink, which might have been my favorite thing there. (We really love good root beer!) They also served it up in a frosty mug so it had those tiny little ice crystals at the top of the drink--perfect!  For my main dish, I got the southern fried chicken with white gravy, cheddar mashed potatoes, and succotash.  Nice warm, home style type food, and the chicken was very tasty.  There was a slight misunderstanding in the kitchen so I got the lunch portion instead of the dinner portion that I had requested, but they realized the issue without me having to say a word, and fixed it immediately.  The customer service and attentiveness we received was top-notch, between our waiter and the management staff.  Atmosphere wise, the place would be great for a group outing, or watching a game with the good sized booths and big tv's spread out on the walls.   Overall, great visit, and we'll be back!"
Chaz S.,"Apex, NC",1,64,1,3.0,9/27/2016,They still need to work out the kinks. My wife ordered the Santa.Fe salad with shrimp menu price $15.25 on the bill $18.20. Ordered a chocolate chunk dessert got a mini version we didn't order so the waitress left it and went to fix the correct one. Got bill the mini was on there that we didn't order. We saw another table have problems to. We will give it another shot. The brisket burger was good my wife salad she has had better. Fries are good daughter chicken fingers like most places.
Jacob P.,"Cary, NC",0,1,,1.0,10/26/2016,"Horrible, order was placed wrong and nothing done about it, staff is not knowledgeable but is unfriendly and rude. Food and beer way over priced. Obseen conversation between staff, managers and other customers."
Brittni P.,"Biddeford, ME",20,15,13,5.0,12/8/2016,"Let me start by saying that if you don't eat here, you are doing yourself a great diservice. The food is spectacular! We came in for lunch with two children, my husband and myself and the place was PACKED. We were given a 15 minute wait time, seated in 10. We ordered our food, I brought my daughter to the bathroom and by the time we came back her MASSIVE kid's plate that fed her and her sister lunch, with enough left over for dinner was already there. My husband and I waited no more than 10 minutes more for ours. We ordered a chicken bacon ranch deep dish and the fish and chips. The pizza is mouth waterering, covered in cheese and toppings and baked to perfection. The fish and chips were the best I have ever had. Crispy outside layer with amazing flavor and flakey, delicious fish inside. It was so enjoyable I forgot to take a picture before most of the food was gone! Will be eating here as frequently as possible."
Amanda O.,"Cary, NC",0,2,,2.0,12/26/2016,The food was good. The service was awful. Forgot half the drinks. Messed up my order. The food came out after everyone else was finished eating. Paid with $100 bill on a $40 check and was asked if we needed change. If the service was better I would be back...but won't be back anytime soon.
Linda G.,"Cary, NC",0,4,,2.0,10/2/2016,"Went on a Thursday evening and was seated right away.  Friendly staff bordering on overly friendly.  Ordered the flatbread nachos which were a disappointment - a sprinkling of black beans, a couple of dabs of avocado, not much cheese - nothing like pictured on the menu.  We complained and the server brought some quacamole and extra black beans.  Doesn't seem like it would take much skill to make a decent plate of nachos.  Then when we each paid our bill in cash, we were both shortchanged by a couple of cents, i.e. mine was 12.69, I paid with a $20, and got back $7.  It's not much, but they shouldn't have decided my change was part of the tip.  We wanted to bring it to the server's attention, but she was nowhere in sight.  Pretty lame all around.  Not likely we'll be going back."
David V.,"Spring, TX",0,8,3,1.0,12/21/2016,Ribs were overcooked and chewy. Deep dish pizza not 100%baked. Beer little warm. Not standing up to its standards.
Love C.,"Cary, NC",0,23,,3.0,1/13/2017,Typical big chain food like TGIF and Ale house but a bit classier.  My friend and I both enjoyed out lunches and the fries are amazing. We really liked our waitress.
Rob M.,"Raleigh, NC",0,1,,3.0,9/24/2016,Nice place. Server didn't know the difference between traditional or bone in wings but who does. Menu was over bearing. Pricing is way to high for the area. Take 15 percent off. Other than that I will go back. Beer is awesome. Just need to pick and choose what food i order. It's really easy to stack up 75.00 bill here with just two people.
Melissa C.,"Raleigh, NC",41,4,,4.0,12/31/2016,"Food was delicious! We had one their pizza specials. Service was good, took awhile to get seated and it was a little loud in restaurant, but will visit again!"
Jeffrey L.,"Cary, NC",0,8,,1.0,11/12/2016,"Waited 15 minutes. No waitress came. We left. This place is new, but that is no excuse for poor training and organization. Manager needs to step it up or they won't last long."
Justin M.,"Cary, NC",0,13,,3.0,10/16/2016,"They have good pizza,  but their hamburgers are terrible (I had the black and blue). Small and over cooked. Their beer is ok.  Much of it tastes watered down,  but there are a couple of decent ones. The service leaves a lot to be desired as well.  Both times I've been here, they forgot part of the order."
Suz S.,"Apex, NC",0,18,,3.0,11/6/2016,"Wanted to check out this new place in town on a Friday night. Place is really cool looking inside with an impressive bar. Place was jammed. Lots of families. We were on a wait list for a table, however, we snagged a table at the bar. Server was very nice even though she was crazy busy. Beer was good. Service decent. Food is good....nothing bad but nothing really spectacular. Ordered a small pizza because the bartender said that's what they are known for. I was underimpressed with their pizza. Will bring the kids back sometime. Menu has lots of options for everyone"
Jacqui M.,"Cary, NC",31,48,,3.0,12/8/2016,The food is adequate. Decent but nothing specific stands out. Pretty good beer and alcohol selection which is nice. I guess which keeps this review from being better is that we just got done eating at the bar and should have left almost 40 minutes before we did because the Three bartenders essentially ignored us the almost 25 minutes after we were done eating even though they weren't that busy. Eventually we were able to ask someone to get us a box and the check.
Christine H.,"Cary, NC",0,8,,1.0,6/9/2017,"My family and I dined here last Monday, we had a party of ten.  It took our server fifteen minutes to even come over and the restaurant was not yet busy.  When our server returned with our drinks he was one short even though he counted the number or people at the table.  My mom had to flag someone else down to get her a water.  Our food came, my mom and I split a deep dish pizza.  The pizza came out with no sauce and no cheese.  Another guest at the table ordered another pizza, same problem.  Someone at the table waited ten minutes for ketchup for their burger.  Pizzas were remade but the server really didn't seem to care that our food was wrong, drinks remained empty throughout the course of the meal as well.  People sat with dirty plates in front of them after dessert was brought out etc.  With so many good options in the Cary area, I don't see this restaurant staying in business very long."
Rachel C.,"Apex, NC",0,3,,1.0,12/5/2016,"Terrible service, waited an hour and a half for a burger and ended up leaving without it. First and last time we will be dining at this place."
Meredith B.,"Raleigh, NC",0,24,1,5.0,10/12/2016,My husband and I went there last night and had a really good experience.  We tried a flight of some of their own beer and were really impressed.  The food portions were huge.  We will definitely be back!!
Melissa M.,"Cary, NC",0,2,1,1.0,11/18/2016,First time we came we love it and had great service and loved the food. Just went and the burger was burnt to a crisp. And I ordered a chicken bacon ranch pizza and it had artichokes throughout. I was extremely disappointed that nothing was done to compensate the poor quality.
