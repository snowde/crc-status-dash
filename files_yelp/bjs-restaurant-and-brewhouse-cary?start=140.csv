Thomas J.,"Fuquay Varina, NC",0,3,,2.0,11/9/2016,"Went for the first time with my bride and we were not impressed with either the food or certainly the price. The atmosphere is on par with Carolina Ale House, perhaps a bit cozier. Menu is like a duplicate of all other chains with the exception of perhaps ahi tuna. We had calamari which was over cooked and way over priced at 12. for the portion. My wife had the flatbread which she liked. I then had chicken wings (I use a s a gauge for all chains) and it was nothing special but over priced.  It seemed that they tacked on 3-4 for every item thinking no one would notice. I've had much better food at cheaper prices. Dinner for two should not cost almost $50 at a chain without drinks."
Shannon H.,"Raleigh, NC",62,6,,1.0,10/14/2016,"One of the worst experiences I've ever had which is sad because the food is pretty good. Admittedly, we were a party of 8 but when we got there we were told the wait would be 10-15 minutes.  45 minutes later we were squeezed at a table.  The Host Staff did a terrible job communicating the delay.  Once we sat it went down hill.  Several times we told our waitress that we were in a hurry and that did not seem to matter to her.  We waited for drinks (all but one of which was water), we waited to order, we waited for food.  We finally asked how much longer only to be informed the kitchen was backed up (something that should have been communicated earlier) and that it would be another 15 mins at least.  This was after waiting for 30+ minutes after ordering.  We asked to have some of the meals go because people needed to get back to work and only 2 of the 3 we needed came out.  Some one needed to leave with no food in hand after being there for almost two hours.  Our waitress did not seem to understand why this was an issue and the manager never bothered to come over and see how we were doing.  He stopped by other tables in the area but avoided us.  When the orders did finally come there were issues with them.  You would think after it taking that long it would all be correct.  The food is pretty good here when you can actually get it.  This is the second time I've been to this location and it seems to be getting worse not better.  Avoid if you are in a hurry, on a time line or just don't like to wait for long periods of time to get your food."
Donna P.,"Fuquay Varina, NC",0,1,,3.0,10/9/2016,"Have been twice.  First visit was at lunch time, just two of us.  Excellent waiter, excellent service, great food.  Second visit on a Wed evening with family and an out of town guest.  Greeted by a waitress who said hello and asked how we were doing, we replied and asked how she was.....surprised to hear ""you know, I'm at work.  I'm exhausted"".  But that might explain why one of our appetizers came out 20 min after the others and why my son's cream soda took 25 minutes to appear.  Never mind the refill that never appeared at all.  Wanted to ask for ketchup for a burger but we couldn't make eye contact with any of the 6-8 staff members who passed our table.  Ultimately, another diner passed the ketchup from his table.  Food was good but it was hard to enjoy after sitting there for an hour.  Hoping the kinks get worked out quickly, it's a nice place with great atmosphere."
Dubeda B.,"Cary, NC",0,3,,3.0,10/2/2016,"Tried BJ's Brewhouse for the first time as we live around the corner from the place and saw that a new restaurant/bar was opening.  The atmosphere was a little different from your typical bar or restaurant, but it did not seem to work for us.  I ordered the garlic, shrimp, and asparagus penne and my girlfriend ordered a burger.  I found the shrimp to be tasteless and the penne sauce unappealing.  The asparagus was about the only thing I enjoyed in the dish.  The burger was good however the bun was much too greasy and seemed as if it were soaked in butter.  I could see how some people may like that though.  The french fries got a thumbs up and the beers were very tasty.  Overall I give the place a meh.  I felt the pasta was overpriced for what was served and I just didn't have that comfortable dining/bar experience I was hoping for.  I don't see us becoming regulars there, but since the place is new we may be willing to give it another shot down the road."
