Brendan B.,"Apex, NC",2,20,8,2.0,5/16/2017,"My family visited BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse for the first time this past weekend.  We were excited since the Cary/Apex area needs more nicer, professionally-run restaurants. The building and interior are beautiful, so expectations were high.  We sat at a high table in the bar area since the dining room was full.  The bar is probably the best-looking and well-designed bar I've seen in a long time.  Our waitress came and presented us with the large menu. I cannot believe they have a menu this large.  It goes on for pages and pages.  There were so many things I wanted to try.  When our waitress took our drink order, my wife asked if the sweet tea was really sweet.  The waitress replied ""It's sweet."" Okay.  Not sure that helped much.  We all ordered sweet tea and it must have been sugared twice because it was way too sweet.  When we told her, she brought a glass of unsweet tea for us to mix.  This was all a hassle, made a mess and never was really corrected throughout the meal.  The waitress never really did fix the situation. The manager did stop by and said he had made new tea and brought some, but it was under-sweetened.   I got the Prime Rib Dip, which looked good, but at $14+, it had better be great.  It was on par, if not slightly below, the Beefeater sandwich at Jason's Deli, which is only $8.99.  The fries were good. My daughter got Chicken Alfredo, which wasn't very good.  The pasta was bland with no seasoning, but the sauce and marinated tasted odd. How do you mess up a simple pasta dish?   Overall, the food was disappointing based on the price and expectations."
Lauren P.,"San Diego, CA",2,4,,1.0,11/11/2017,"Absolutely awful experience! There is zero communication between the entire staff. We called ahead to be put on the waiting list. When we got there she said when we called it was an hour wait but that we'd been waiting 20 minutes by that time but that we'd probably be seated soon. Fast forward 40 minutes later where I watched 2 people who walked in and hadn't called ahead be seated before us. We complained and they said oh we called you, party of 6? We said no, there are 3 of us. She sat us, had the manager come apologize and offer a free app. The manager failed to tell the server that so he said he had to check with the manager first to see if we could have a free app. Then I asked about what the Veteran special as they were offering a free meal for Veterans Day and ensured I showed him my id then. We had two servers try and bring us other peoples orders. The calamari came out and was terrible! It was essentially fried breading with no calamari but hey it was free. The rest of the food was subpar, we also asked for ketchup and ended up getting up ourselves to ask another table if we could have theirs since it was taking so long. The check came and he took off the appetizer, but not my meal. My father asked and he said ""oh I didn't know she was a vet"", and my dad said ""she showed you her military id"". Oh and a different server passed by our table and used it to fix his menus by hitting them on the table. Overall I wouldn't recommend this place and I will never go back."
j m.,"Wake, NC",1,56,,4.0,2/2/2017,"Made our first stop in here on New Year's Eve and came away happy.  The mission was a light meal and drinks before our scheduled movie at Crossroads; there was a wait for tables but we were able to snag the last two seats at the bar.  Watching bartenders work, and interact with the servers, can tell you a lot, and the bartenders here are experienced and smart (which they need to be since it's both a ""brewhouse""* and a full-service liquor bar including many specialty drinks), and were able to guide the less-savvy servers (and in one case, the manager) on in what was in various drinks.   Tried a flight of their house beers which ranged from OK to very good.   Yes, the menu is big but not completely illogical.  We had a flatbread and the Ahi tuna salad, both of which were a notch above standard bar food both in quality and asking price.  I'm looking forward to working through other parts of the menu.   The environment is quieter than the Ale House (where isn't it), less goofy than Red Robin and a bit more upscale all around.   I see the mixed reviews on table service and you can't always judge this properly from the bar (nor on NYE) but our experience so far was definitely good enough to come back."
Gina W.,"Holly Springs, NC",0,12,2,4.0,3/27/2017,"We came to this restaurant after 9 on in a Sunday. To our surprise food service was still available and were greeted with kindness. (Some places you come this late they act put out but not here). The menu I must say was expansive so many choices and this worried me that the meal would taste like right out of the microwave.  I had a veggie burger with side salad. My daughter had tomato bisque with side salad.  Both of our meals were hot, fresh and tasty. The salads were very fresh and very good. We had great service and everyone was professional. As I stated before sometimes when you go late you get bad attitude but not this place. We plan to go back and bring rest of the family!"
Allison A.,"Cary, NC",74,7,,2.0,8/27/2017,Extremely overpriced for average food. Nothing you can't get somewhere else nearby for a more reasonable price.
Lisa M.,"Cary, NC",2,90,58,5.0,1/30/2017,"I'm so excited that this restaurant I love from when I lived in California is now in Cary, NC! I stopped to there and had dinner right away when I discovered the new location. Their pizza and beer are every bit as good as I remembered. They have a menu with options for everyone (from snacks to entrees, and healthy to hearty), and everything is tasty. They serve a good variety of beers, the atmosphere is fun, and the service is excellent."
Susan B.,"Cary, NC",5,21,,3.0,1/10/2017,"Nice open restaurant with tons of seating, but even so during busy times there might be a wait.  Good beer selection although I have to say I am not a fan of their own beers.  Service is friendly and very willing to introduce you to both their beer menu and their food menu. Extensive menu of apps, salads, sandwiches and entrees with a few whole pages devoted to healthier options. The food is presented well, but I've been twice now and just found the flavors to be somewhat lacking. Everything I've had has been ""ok"" but nothing to get excited about. I'd go again if someone in my party wanted to try it but I doubt I would go back on my own."
JamariNelijah P.,"Pine Forest, Spring Lake, NC",27,8,3,5.0,4/17/2017,Our first time at BJ's here in NC since moving from Texas. We are in love all over again!! Deep dish pizza .. on point!! Wings.. on point!! Burger.. on point!! Pizookie.. on point!! Service (server: Zach).. on point!! We can't wait to be back!!!
Cara F.,"Cary, NC",1,11,,4.0,4/16/2017,"**UPDATE** After speaking with the manager, I decided to give the restaurant another try. I greatly appreciate the fact that the manager took the time to listen to my thoughts on my previous experience and also apologize for any shortcomings. Our second visit was better than the first - our waiter was much more attentive than the last, our food was satisfactory, and our overall experience was fairly pleasant. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - I'm usually very patient & understanding when it comes to service, so it's saying something for me to be so frustrated at an experience to write a negative review. Our server rarely visited our table - we sat with empty water glasses for more than 20 minutes. When our order arrived the sliced avocados on my sandwich still had the thick outer skin on them - how does that even happen? Super disappointed with the whole experience. Probably won't bother to visit again."
Robert R.,"Fuquay-Varina, NC",2,38,16,5.0,11/19/2016,"I have always been a fan of this restaurant chain. My fiancé is from California and they have a lot over there. I was very happy to see them come to Cary. This place is more elegant and upscale than Ale House. Ale House is geared more towards large groups and younger people who just want to hang out and drink while the game is on. This place is geared more towards people who want to enjoy a game or a drink and not deal with rowdy people.   I will say that their beer selection isn't as diverse as the Ale House's. Roughly 70% of their beer is their own specialty beer. Which I don't mind. I like trying new things. It's a great place to go on a date or to meet family or friends. The food is fantastic and the service was great. If you're looking for a place to go and enjoy a good meal and catch a game and don't want to deal with large groups and rowdy people, this is the spot."
LaNae M.,"Apex, NC",0,15,8,3.0,11/22/2016,"Finally something new in town....well I was hoping.  The parking lot was packed but thankfully we were sat immediately.  I ordered the lunch spaghetti and my husband ordered a grilled cheese meal (avocado, bacon, tomato, cheese) fries and a cream soda.  The spaghetti was so spicy it was almost chili! The overwhelming flavor was chili flake. I, too, put chili flake in my spaghetti but this amount is way too much. The portion was huge. I would like to pay a little less and get a little less. No one wants a to go bag at lunch.  My husband said his sandwich was great except his bread was somewhat greasy, it had been over buttered or left to sit. In addition, the cream soda tasted fake. He likened it to a dum dum lollipop!  However, we both agreed the fries were some of the best we both had ever eaten.  Overall, I would say this place reminds me of an overpriced Chilis/Applebee's."
Timothy C.,"Raleigh, NC",8,33,9,5.0,11/23/2016,"This place is awesome.  You will notice every negative review is predisposed to hate all chain restaurants.  Sorry foody snobs that it's not artisan or whatever, it's just really good food. I first went to a BJ's in Florida and have been wanting one in the triangle area for some time.  Thank goodness this place opened.  The menu is large (cheesecake factory large) so there is something for everyone.  To me the real shining stars are the deep dish pizzas and pastas.  The burgers, sandwiches, steaks, and the rest are all good, but the deep dish is on my top five list up there with the great ones in Chicago.  It's less greasy, but full of flavor and has the perfect buttery crisp crust.  So ignore the haters.  This is a wonderful place to eat and drink while watching a game on one of their numerous TVs, or sit away from the TVs and just visit with friends over amazing food."
Erica H.,"Cary, NC",30,233,414,5.0,10/30/2016,"WOW this joint is packed! Being from California we have had BJ's for years. Maybe it isn't an over-the-top experience but I was so happy to have another ""big bar"" in this neck of the woods other than alehouse. (Anyone else sick of frickles and short shorts?). BJ's brings the cool Cali vibe and low key atmosphere that us west coast folks adore. The price tag is higher than other places in the area but you can order everything from ""fancy chicken entrees"" and beer samplers to pizookies (cookies with icecream) and deep dish pizza. Heck yeah. That's a win in my book."
Octavia S.,"Willow Spring, NC",20,5,5,5.0,3/16/2017,"This was me and my boyfriends first time going to BJ's and the food the great! I ordered the Deep Dish Baked Ziti, and it was fantastic! It had a lot of flavor and meaty!"
Rod D.,"Shallotte, NC",0,37,,4.0,10/24/2016,"Ok, first off I'm not usually a fan at all of chain restaurants that try to do something for everyone.  I was meeting a small group here to watch football, saw they had a good TV setup and solid draft beer selection so that sold me for one visit at least.  I did a bit of quick reading about the chain and glanced over their menu online beforehand, got to admit I was thinking new generation TGIF's? So maybe I was wrong; one kitchen can possibly turn out really good Asian Fusion, Handcrafted Burgers, two kinds of Pizza (very thin or signature deep dish), Seafood, Steaks, top notch Apps and killer Desserts (baked in their own pan cookie creations or Monkey Bread topped with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream). Our table ordered a little bit of everything and shared it all.  The Avocado Egg Rolls were delicious, a tasty combination of ingredients fried quickly to perfection and served with sweet tamarind sauce.  Crisp Potato Skins had excellent texture, I think they must bake then flash fry right before topping with the hickory smoked bacon / cheese and then a last minute quick trip into a Salamander.  Not greasy at all, an old favorite brought back to new standards!  Several varieties of wings were ordered, I liked the regular with Sriracha Dry Rub the best, did not care for the boneless too much.   To finish up our table tried the thin crust Pizza.  All toppings were top quality, the Italian Sausage for instance was in nice sized pieces and had a very good flavor, spiced just right.  I saw several people enjoying the Deep Dish Pizza and it looked filling but great.  That would be on my list to try on a future visit for sure.  Beer selection was more than adequate, not sure total # of taps but plenty.  Some guys with me had flights and were not disappointed with anything they tried before picking favorites.  I saw they had a limited release Green Flash collaboration (a favorite West Coast Brewery of mine) - Hop Pact Rye IPA and went straight for that and stuck with it. Service was great, Jessica J. knew her beers and took care of us during a very busy Saturday afternoon.  A manager stopped by and comped an order of wings that took a bit too long without us asking which was nice.  I'll definitely add BJ's to my list of places to return to when in this area."
Lori L.,"Buies Creek, NC",19,8,,1.0,7/22/2017,"Pretty terrible experience. Food came out wrong or not at all, my son didn't get to eat. I sat with an empty beer glass at a place with brewhouse in the name. No one asked how the food we did get was, not very good. Then were charged full price, even for my son's food that came as we were paying and had to be boxed up. $97.00 including a 18% tip, I wasn't going to stiff our young server. Stay away!"
Brandon A.,"Raleigh, NC",0,13,3,5.0,7/20/2017,"So I've been here three times and had great food, drinks and dessert each time.  Downloading the app and getting out on the waitlist makes things so easy. Heck, you can even pre-order. The cocktails are good and I've had a burger, pizza then recently one of their ""enlightened"" options (Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos) which were excellent. Will definitely be back again."
Scott V.,"Cary, NC",4,40,121,4.0,5/23/2017,"Great food...lots of choices including a great selection of health conscious dishes.  Discovered these guys in PHX, glad there here!  Enjoyed the wings and new tapas like hot side dishes on last trips with their tasty stouts.  Need to work on improving their service in Cary or this would. E rated even higher!"
Erica B.,"Raleigh, NC",2,48,20,1.0,12/14/2016,"Our second visit was a huge disaster. Since there are limited late night dine in options around the Triangle area, we decided on BJ's last saturday night. They were open until 1am, but there were only one other table when we arrived around 11:45pm. The host didn't seem to be happy to see us. Then he reluctantly proceeded to seat us.  We quickly ordered some appetizers and four Top Sirloins. When the sirloins came out after 30 mins of waiting, we disappointedly found out that NONE of their temperature was cooked right. The medium was cooked Medium well, and Medium well was cooked well done. We brought it to our server's attention, and without telling us what she was going to do, she just turned around and left. We had to yell to get someone's attention to find out where our server was. We realized from that someone that our server went to order us another sirloin. That someone happened to be the manager, and seems to know exactly what was going on. However, it was a shame that he didn't make the initiative to make things right before we had asked him to come over. He discounted our checks, but did not to take the returned sirloins off our check. We had to point out him that we were charged for the orders that we had returned. He later took the returned sirloins off the check, but removed the discount. He seemed a little annoyed, and seriously we feel apologetic to cause such a scene late Saturday night. However, as a customer, we didn't feel like we were treated well, not to mention friendliness service. We left on a hungry stomach because we barely had anything to eat.  We are full of the mediocre food and service. This location offers great Grand Opening deals, but sorry, we will most definitely not return again."
Edwina H.,"Raleigh, NC",0,2,2,5.0,2/26/2017,"This was my first visit will not be my last. Sat at the bar. Drink was Great, food was great too. Had the monkey bread ice cream dessert. Soooo good. And the bartender, was attentive."
