Scott H.,"Bethlehem, PA",15,176,133,2.0,9/25/2016,"Five of us had a really lousy experience. It was a Sunday night and the wait was surprisingly long for our drinks. Four salad entrées and one burger were all just OK. Chicken tortilla soup was way too salty. The manager came over and offered his apologies but It really couldn't help much. It was actually kind of laughable as the waitress explained that the soups should have come out with the salad despite the fact that we ordered them as appetizers. We are all from out of town so don't know anything about this chain, at least it looks like a chain. It sure feels like the food is made someplace else and put together by an amateur staff on site."
Greg O.,"Morrisville, NC",95,310,198,3.0,11/21/2016,"Better than average sports bar food, but not cheap.  They have good desserts and burgers."
J T.,"Oak Island, NC",0,17,,2.0,10/20/2017,Went tonight for the first and last time. Our waitress was delightful and attentive and the place is impressive to look at. The food.....not so much. We got burgers and fries that were tasteless and dry. Screwing up a burgers takes practice. Sorry. Won't do that again.
Omar A.,"Holly Springs, NC",1,11,16,5.0,12/4/2016,"Ton of menu options and good service. Didn't have a huge appetite that night, so just had a lite mahi-mahi mahi tacos. Good flavor and will cause me to go back for sure to see other options! Was a busy Saturday night but we were still able to be seated within a reasonable time too!!"
Kayla G.,"Wilmington, NC",206,7,,3.0,6/12/2017,"Food was great, everyone was nice. The only issue I had is that I placed an order for pick up at 11am, it said I was able to pick up then. However, that was not the case.. I had to wait about 35 minutes for my food. Which kind of sucked because it was on my lunch break. So I feel that if they can't have it ready by 11 (because that's when they open) they shouldn't have that as an option and if they KNOW it's going to take that long, they should've called! Other than that everything was great :)"
Chilon A.,"Cary, NC",19,26,20,2.0,5/12/2017,"I think i must have hit this place on an ""off day"" - service was slow and i was not real impressed with the food. Great location and will try again just to test my theory."
Charlotte R.,"Apex, NC",0,49,,3.0,6/4/2017,"I went on a Sunday afternoon and the place wasn't too busy. The menu was extensive and unique - it had many items I rarely or never see in other restaurants. Prices were reasonable and most of the food my table ordered tasted good. Environment was nicely decorated and comfortable. Waiters were friendly and attentive. Food did take a bit longer to arrive than most other restaurants, but that's the downside of having a monstrously large menu. It slows down the kitchen significantly. The only things wrong were unfortunately really big things to get wrong - cleanliness and food safety. The booth I was seated at had food on it when I sat down. Both mine and my husband's cloth napkins had bits of someone else's food in them when they were unrolled, and my utensils came dirty. My husband's drink came with a greasy straw that also had chunks of food on it - maybe the server who placed the straw had dirty hands? The artichoke dip we ordered came cold as if it had been scooped out of a pot that had been sitting in the back kitchen for far too long and the cheese sticks and avocado rolls were lukewarm. Given that their sanitation score is just 92, I worry what goes on back there. My husband had come here a couple weeks ago and had a similar experience with severely undercooked food that had to be sent back to the kitchen. I do give the manager a lot of credit for trying to make it right and taking some stuff off of our bill. But as long as cleanliness and food safety remains something of an issue here, I am very hesitant to return. My husband wants to give them a third chance but I will personally wait until the sanitation score rises."
Jason W.,"Raleigh, NC",45,3,3,2.0,10/24/2016,"I took my wife and kids to BJs in Cary for Lunch.  The food was... ok, the beer (IPA) was... pretty good and the service, the service... what service?  Lunch service, from the time we sat down took almost 90 minutes. for LUNCH.  It took forever, they got our order wrong twice!  Do not recommend BJs in Cary. BJs in Cary, I hope, if you read this, that you will take the opportunity to improve your service.  We may try again, but only if a friend goes first and tells us that the service was AMAZING."
Daylily F.,"Climax, NC",0,106,62,3.0,2/25/2017,"First Visit. Excellent Bar Service. Excellent Beer Selection although prices were higher than others close by. Excellent Food. Sadly, Dining Service was very disconnected between Waitress taking food/drink orders and Kitchen Staff delivering food order. E.G: Food arriving before Drinks. When asked, those delivering food acted like they did not know anything about the drink order. It appeared staff were blaming each other for the disconnect.  At the end after not receiving our coffee until we finished our dessert, Management did not charge us for the coffee. The 3 Stars are for the 30 minutes Excellent Service at the Bar and Excellent Food; however, the 1.5 hours Disconnected Service in the Dining Area needs attention.  It appeared Geneva, our Waitress was spending more time trying to get 6 male customers to apply for BJ'S App than ensuring we or other Customers received our  Drinks or Food in a timely manner. If you eat here, I recommend you eat at the Bar.  Based on this experience and other Yelp Comments, I recommend Carolina Ale House whose Selection of Beer and Food is also Excellent and Daily Beer Specials are offered at a much lower price.

Samantha P.,"Holly Springs, NC",10,59,12,4.0,4/16/2017,"So far I've visited this restaurant twice. The first experience was very disappointing due to poor quality control of the food coming out of the kitchen even though the service was otherwise great. My friend is a member of their rewards program and wrote a review through the app. She was soon contacted by the manager who was genuinely concerned about our poor experience and asked that we give them another shot, offering a gift card as incentive. The management definitely seems to care about the success of the business and values feedback.  We went back today to give them another shot and the food was much better. We didn't let the manager know we were there as a kind of 'blind' test and we were pleased with how it all went.  The food is all typical American fare burgers, pizza, pasta and such. Between the four of us we've tried the grilled cheese, California club, a tavern pizza, burgers, and the Parmesan chicken. So far nothing has struck us as amazing, but the beer selection is good draw. I think we'll be giving this place a few more chances and hopefully find some dishes they excel at.  So far the berry cider is my favorite and the cookies n' cream pizookie is divine! The blond beer is the favorite for my boyfriend."
Chris C.,"Cary, NC",0,128,27,5.0,10/6/2016,Great new place. The menu is amazing and has plenty of different items for everyone. Wings with the root beer gaze are the best. Plenty of different beers to try they brew their own blends and have five brewer's. You can sample up to 2 different beers every time you visit!
Latrice B.,"San Antonio, TX",2,56,11,3.0,3/31/2017,"I used to be a huge fan of BJ's when I first discovered the chain back in 2007. Maybe my palate has just changed, but it's just another chain restaurant with craft beer and decent food. Nothing memorable in my opinion. I must say that the server was pretty friendly, though. Decent food but I probably wouldn't go back anytime soon."
Aspen R.,"Boise, ID",27,32,31,3.0,1/27/2017,"I have been to this location several times. It opened late 2016. Service has been both good and not so good. I can say every time I've been, almost every seat in the place is occupied.  I like the huge slate board on the wall that shows what beers are on tap and is nearly visible from anywhere in the restaurant.  The deep dish pizza is very good with that buttery, crispy crust. The sweet pig is my fave. You can order online using the app and choose take out or curbside. On the way to a friend's house, I decided to order a few pies and try the curbside pickup. The pickup process was a little clunky as once you park, there is a number on a sign to call. The number was busy for several minutes. Once they answered, they asked for my order number, confirmed what the order was then asked for my name. I paid with a card so they took the card back inside after they brought the food then brought me a receipt to sign. Total, the pickup process took about 15 minutes.  Would be nice with the curbside option, if there was a way to pay when you order to streamline the process."
Rob M.,"Angier, NC",0,14,3,2.0,11/4/2016,"Ugh.  I guess their sales objectives are based on beer and booze.  They only sell their own craft brews, which is irritating because I've come back to the old faithful Budweiser after tiring of the expensive fad beer. The food was quite mediocre.  I had a Hickory Brisket and Bacon Burger which seemed to be on a Merita-brand grocery store bun, straight out of the bag.  The brisket crumbles were tender but the BBQ sauce tasted like the corn syrup food distributor house brand.  By the time my mustard and mayo showed up, the burger and bacon got cold.  The cookie sheet that it was served on was irritating so I dumped the burger on a spare salad plate, threw away the bun and just choked down the beef (after adding salt for flavor).  On the positive side, the fries were crispy and good! Sorry to be crabby about a burger but it's more like an $8 burger, definitely not $13..."
Paul H.,"Raleigh, NC",0,1,,1.0,9/25/2017,"Sat at a high top in the bar area at 7:00 on a Monday night. Not too crowded but finally walked out after waiting for 11 minutes without anyone acknowledging I was there. Watched numerous servers, runners, and the manager walk by without even glancing my way. Terrible service."
Danny M.,"Raleigh, NC",2,27,,2.0,6/5/2017,"Meh, service was good as far as our waitress, but that was about it. Food was bland and menu is uninventive. Way too many options and they're all the same old bar food options. If you do that much then you're bound to not do anything well. Simple margarita had to be sent back (I never do that).  It was undrinkable. Put a straw in a bottle of sour mix and that's what it was. The beer list is good. The atmosphere is nice. Food took forever."
George D.,"Cary, NC",11,7,,3.0,4/8/2017,Friday 4/7/17. Need more staff. Waited 50 min to be seated. 15 min to have our order taken. 45 min to get food. Good food but terrible service.
Tom M.,"Apex, NC",1,15,,2.0,5/17/2017,"I don't think I will be back anytime soon.  The place looks amazing, and the staff are super friendly and attentive.  But the food, while it looks attractive is just 'eh'!  We ordered burgers and fries for one and pan pizza for the other. The burger was just okay (the fries were amazing) but the pizza was super bland.  I really wanted to like it but there was zero flavor.  I wrote to the manager just to give some feedback but we never got a response. I went back there alone for lunch and figured I'd give the pizza one more shot.  Instead of a special, I just ordered extra cheese and meatball.  Again, BLAND!  No taste at all, and dry!  If there was extra cheese, I could not tell.  About two inches from the crust, there was nothing.  As far as meatballs go, and this is not an exaggeration, it was as if they scooped out a teaspoon of meatball and sprinkled it on a large pie.   I questioned my super friendly waitress if this was really an extra cheese with meatball.  She said that's what she ordered for me.  The manager came over an offered to make another but I passed.  It was just a waste of calories.  I had tiny slice and left it.  I can enjoy a bad pizza, and even a cheap pizza as well as a good NY style (Try Ricci's Trattoria-the best!!!), but this was just dry and tasteless dough.   I'm afraid to waste my money on anything else there based on these items."
Brad P.,"Garner, NC",245,2,,5.0,4/6/2017,"The manager, Chris, gave me excellent customer service yesterday. On my online order the pizza did not come over correctly. Chris was quick to make-it-right with a smile. Thank you, Chris. And the pizza was delicious!"
Shannon W.,"Cary, NC",0,13,,3.0,3/20/2017,"We have been here three or four times now. At lunch it was super busy. Other times, we came when it was off hours - late lunch or dinner. We have been there with just my husband and I, all five of us, and even with seven of us. The food is fine. Nothing special. Large menu. The issue is that the service is always lacking. Drink refills never come quickly and they put tons of ice in the glasses. We have given them several tries, but there are better options."
