Michelle W.,"Cary, NC",0,11,,4.0,4/27/2017,"You know, I was skeptical. It's a chain in the parking lot of Kohl's, and the ambience is definitely lacking -- the place is big and loud and distinctly suburban. I was pleasantly surprised at how good the beer is: I got a sampler and tried the Blonde, the Porter, the Brewnette and the Stout. All of them very drinkable at a good price. I've had worse beers at fancier brewpubs. The food was also decent and a good value. The menu was big -- too big -- but with a number of delicious-looking options. We both got tacos and enjoyed the soft pita shell that had a nice brown crust. The side was a slightly sweet grain-based salad with corn and black beans. Nothing fancy, but it was satisfying and a good weeknight meal. The service from Geneva was awesome -- she was friendly and had a great sense of humor, and was very efficient.  I'll gladly return, but based on the massive menu size, the other reviews, and the general feel of the place, I'll hedge my bets a little."
Stephanie G.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,22,10,4.0,2/19/2017,"So happy to have a BJ's restaurant in NC! Love the beer and and pizza. My favorite are the Avocado rolls for an appetizer, buffalo pizza with a blonde beer and a piezookie for dessert.Overall everything was good. Only thing is that the server looked rush all the time. More staff was needed to give a better experience for new customers."
Ann D.,"Apex, NC",8,25,,4.0,4/23/2017,"This was our first time visiting a BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse.  We arrived about 12:30 on  Sunday and were seated promptly.  The menu has so much variety.  I was particularly happy to see the EnLightend menu which has many options for lighter as well as gluten free fare.  Calories counts are included.  I do wish they included calorie counts for their standard fare, but I guess they figure those who order off the EnLightened menu don't care!  They also have gluten free options for pizza and their famous dessert Pizookie.  We did not try the Pizookie, but we plan to in the future. it looks divine. As far as prices, they are a bit on the high side.  I ordered the New Roasted Shrimp Peruvian Qunioa Bowl.  My husband ordered their half rack of ribs and some fries. The half rack came with a cole slaw that looked more like a salad.  My husband didn't want that so instead ordered the fries which was an upcharge.  They would not substitute the slaw for the fries which I found a little annoying since many restaurants do this with no problem whatsoever. And frankly, most restaurants would probably include slaw and fries for the price. Our food overall was actually very good. The only real downside to our visit was the slowness of the wait staff.  Our waitress seemed overwhelmed and it took about an hour to get our food.  We had a hard time flagging anyone to get ketchup for our fries and then it took another 20 minutes just to get our check.  Our waitress was very apologetic and even went into detail about how she had a mishap with a large party which slowed her down. Whatever the reason, we felt it wasn't something as a customer we need to be concerned with.  Management should be out there working themselves when there is a backlog!  I've seen it in many other establishments!   So if you like a menu with variety, give it a shot. Hopefully this slow service will improve.  We can't comment on their beer or handcrafted beverages, but they all looked very good."
Ray L.,"Fort Mill, SC",0,2,,2.0,8/28/2017,Been to BJ'S  3 times now and tonight will be the last.  Possibly the worst deep dish pizza I have ever had.  Kids chicken fingers looked like bojangles.  If you want very average chain bar food this is your place.
Jessica P.,"Raleigh, NC",74,51,26,5.0,10/14/2016,"Love the drink options here; hubby got the seasonal beer which he enjoyed and I got the Tickled Pink cocktail and it was delicious. Our food was very good and the atmosphere was nice too. The staff is all very friendly and attentive. We overheard the FOH manager speaking to some other customers and I was impressed with his kindness and demeanor. He is well suited for the position. Overall great experience. Only complaint is it did take a long while for the good, but it's s brand new restaurant so I wasn't surprised. They were on a wait the entire time we were there. I'm sure it will improve.  Their desserts look amazing too!"
Joe P.,"Sanford, NC",0,2,1,1.0,8/27/2017,I was highly disappointed with the pizza. I love Chicago style pizza and this is not even close to authentic. It tasted like a Pizza Hut deep dish pizza. That is not a bad thing just not what I was looking for. Based on the price and what it actually was I will just order from Pizza Hut. Still looking for the real deal Chicago style.
Michael N.,"Raleigh, NC",77,7,1,4.0,10/2/2016,New to the scene is BJ's in Cary. A friend and I have went their twice so far. It's a very open area with good seating and flow. We dabbled in their beer selection and had some appetizers. We had no complaints with either. The beer had some ups and downs but that's not to knock the establishment as everyone has different flavor pallets. The appetizers were really tasty though.  Overall this place is in a great location for me and has everything a Brewhouse needs... beer and food. The one flaw I find is there isn't any outdoor seating. That is the only thing I wish it had.  The end.
Scott P.,"Fuquay Varina, NC",53,5,,1.0,3/30/2017,Worst meal in a really long time.  Atmosphere is really nice.  Service was outstanding.  Beer was sludge had to get another brand.  Food was just disgusting.  Very expensive and just not worth it.  Don't make the same mistake we made.
Stephanie R.,"Raleigh, NC",1,67,,2.0,11/26/2016,Great server meh food.  Went for lunch the other day decided to try it.  We ordered their signature dish their deep dish pizza.  Don't be fooled this is NOT a deep dish pizza this is a thick crusted pizza nothing more.   Now for money it is so not worth it minimal topping and cheese the sauce I guess was ok we needed to ask for more there was almost none on the pie.  Very disappointing.  We also order the sliders as our app as we expected it to take a while it didn't in fact the pie was out before our appetizer.  The sliders sigh were to start? Well meat - it didn't even cover the bun and was about 1/8 of an inch thick it was all bun not worth the 10.00 it costs.  This was a not do again.  We wanted to like it.  The floors are horrible dang near slipped down the ramp and fell on my rear.  A deep dish place would have been great for the area pizza huts is better
Kathy B.,"Cary, NC",0,11,,2.0,3/18/2017,"Service:  Not intuitive in the least, did not know how to properly handle food or drink issues. We had so many things go bad that he should have sent a mgr over for damage control. Corp chains have pretty standard SOP's for this type of thing.  Food:  pizza under cooked, ribeye had so much fat that 25% was left on plate after cutting around all of it.  Broccoli was 95% RAW with no seasoning whatsoever - like what you'd get on a veggie tray/ranch dressing. Told the waiter - ""sorry"" was all we got.  Sirloin was about 1/2 the size of the picture on menu. Wedge salad was good, brussel sprouts too salty. Drink:  Beer good, but margarita was so sweet it was like drinking syrup water. Told the waiter and he waffled and stammered, and we finally said, ""please take it back, we don't want this"".   #reactandtakactionplease Prices:  too steep on many items.  $16.25 for a personal pan size pizza.  Thought my $16.25 sirloin was properly priced until I saw the size of it.  Atmosphere:  nice, fun and well designed. As we walked out the door, we saw a sheet that stated prime rib special all weekend - looked awesome, but sadly our waiter never bothered to tell us about it.  Two ppl in our group said that's what they would have ordered #hadtheyknown  :/ Hope mgt regroups with their servers and perhaps reassesses their skills.  Need to alert servers to bring in the mgr when a table has multiple issues. Maybe we'll go back for lunch and try some other menu items and hopefully get a better server."
Brandy P.,"Knoxville, TN",71,4,1,3.0,3/17/2017,"Atmosphere was good, brew selection was good, menu was impressive, yet we didn't really enjoy our visit. We never received our appetizer, and half the meals arrived several minutes before the rest. I ordered the bowl of soup in a bread bowl. It had a great flavor, but the soup portion was tiny. My daughter's macaroni and cheese was cold. The server was alright. He was knowledgeable with suggestions."
Kim S.,"Apex, NC",56,42,38,5.0,11/18/2016,"Ok so first time here on a Friday night. They said 30 min wait.. so decided to eat at the bar. The beer choices are endless and staff so helpful. I chose the beat arugula salad and a side of Brussel sprouts. Amazing!! My hubby had the Parmesan crusted chicken and he said equally awesome! Great new place in Cary, close to home and fantastic menu... we will be back!"
Anna K.,"Holly Springs, NC",0,9,,2.0,7/23/2017,"Extremely slow, unfriendly service, bad food & overpriced drinks. It took almost 15 minutes for our drinks to arrive after ordering from the waitress. The restaurant was not even half full. I had a basic hamburger, which left much to be desired. My husband ordered the jumbolaya, which included dry overcooked chicken, and came with an $18 price tag. Save your money & go elsewhere. I've been to other BJ's locations in other states and had great food & service."
Tim H.,"Raleigh, NC",13,6,1,1.0,3/11/2017,"Great food, poor customer service. Waited 40 minutes to receive our mini pizza and boneless wings. Was told the manager was going to stop by and talk to us and give us something for the long wait... Needless to say he was completely worthless. Not sure I'll ever return to this location."
Joanne F.,"Holly Springs, NC",2,5,,1.0,6/29/2017,"Disappointing dinner, again. This place has such potential but does not live up to it. They got my order wrong again. Then we have the server blaming the kitchen while the kitchen blames the server. I don't care really who did it, just fix it. When I finally got the meal I ordered, my dinner partner was done with his meal. The shrimp in the shrimp taco pitas was so overcooked you could hardly chew it. I've been to the bjs in TX many times so I know that it's possible for them to do a good job. Someone needs to turn this place around. I'm obviously not the only one who feels this way. When it first opened you couldn't get in the door on a Friday at 6pm. Last Friday it was wide open in the lobby at 6pm."
Amanda D.,"Raleigh, NC",40,82,5,4.0,12/7/2016,Visited BJ's last night for dinner with friends.  We ate at the bar.  Bartender was extremely amenable and a pleasure.  He was attentive and interested in making sure our visit was smooth.  I ordered the grilled chicken with roasted brussel sprouts and brown rice.  Dish was cooked perfectly and full of flavor.  I'd definitely go back again and order the same thing.  Those with me had the chicken club sandwich and a noodle bowl.  Both seemed happy with their entrees.
Jean H.,"Apex, NC",5,15,3,2.0,11/2/2016,"Our first time here. It's a Wednesday night and the place was slammed. We didn't have to wait that long for a table. That was the best part of the meal. Our waiter was very lack luster and uninformed on the food. My friend ordered Salmon and asked how it would be cooked. He fumbled through his answer. When she finally asked for it to be medium, he said he would make sure the Chef knew. It came out well done. Over done. The entrees came right after the appetizer was served. I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken. It was ok. Mashed potatoes were very dry.  Our waiter never came back to check on us or see if we needed anything else to drink or even how the food was. When he finally returned for us to order dessert, he immediately came back with the check before the dessert arrived. Still not asking if we wanted anything else to drink. We were not impressed and will give them a chance to learn the ropes before trying again."
Aleshia D.,"Raleigh, NC",2,22,6,4.0,10/9/2016,"Service was great! 4 stars because prices are a little high. $17.50 for jumbalaya.. Made me not get it which is sad because it's my favorite food. That being said they have a huge menu and a great drink menu. It's like Carolina Ale house but so much better because 1- they aren't charging 17$ for a shot of patron, 2- they're menu is much bigger and 3- the service is much better. Their margaritas were awesome and their dessert pizza cookies are bomb! Get the salted caramel!"
Jessica R.,"Raleigh, NC",0,8,,1.0,9/25/2016,"On 09/25/16 at 4pm, my husband and I were really looking forward to trying this place! As we walked up to the door, we noticed two kitchen employees in their uniform smoking outside on the black bench to the left of the restaurant. We approached the host stand anyway. The host was busy doing something to the computer and did not acknowledge us for 45 seconds (they were not busy and we were standing literally 2 feet from him). Finally, he looked up and seemed genuinely surprised we were there...or maybe we interrupted his game of Candy Crush, we will never really know.  We were sat and given menus. The menu looked delicious and the beer list is to die for (I was gonna try the roasted kale and brussel sprout salad)...But you know what? We never were given the chance to order anything. We waited 9 minutes. Six waitstaff passed us and not a single one said ""hey I'll be right there"". The table behind us was arguing with the waiter that he incorrectly charged items on their check. Huge red flags everywhere so we decided to leave. As we left, the host WHO JUST SAT US 10 minutes ago says 'have a nice night'...Really? So I told him we waited for 10 minutes and no one even came over to greet us. He rolled his eyes and just said 'sorry'...Apparently this must happen quite often. Anyway, if you got PLENTY of time, try this place out. But if time is of the essence to you, do what we did...go down the road to Waverly Place and try out T. Mac Restaurant. Equivalent menu and equal OR BETTER beer list than BJ's. And they acknowledge you and appreciate your time. I know BJ's is new, and I was ready for some bumps, but not a freggin' cigarette stinking giant road block you can't get around. Best of luck to you BJ's, may you have many returning customers, but I won't give myself the opportunity to be one of them.  #badfeeling  #yourloss  #cashdroppingcustomers"
Marilyn L.,"Cary, NC",1,6,,5.0,12/13/2016,"So excited to have BJ's so close by! This was a staple in Cali, the menu has options for everyone. The service at this location was great, food was yummy, great casual and cool atmosphere. Also, tons of gluten free options that don't sacrifice taste!!"
