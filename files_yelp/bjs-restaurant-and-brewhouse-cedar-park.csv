Tammy O.,"Cedar Park, TX",175,242,959,4.0,10/16/2017,"It's that time of year for the pumpkin ale. This was the first time for us to try it.  I was excited cuz other years we have missed out and we have heard such great things about it. Well, It was delicious. All there beers are great we really enjoy them.  We love there apps. We usually start out with the flatbread pizza. Great sauce and love the crispy crust. This trip we tried the wings. Yum yum. They are fried great. We got the Nashville hot sauce. It was great. Kinda sweet and hot. Perfect combo. Next we ordered the chips with salsa and guacamole. Oh yum. The salsa is fire roasted. Goes really great with there beers. The guacamole was excellent. Kinda chunky and had great flavor.   Well we were still hungry so we tried the sliders with fries. Really good.  Meat and bun were done great. Some of the best sliders I've had."
Amanda J.,"Austin, TX",1,38,8,2.0,1/9/2018,"This is specifically for curbside takeout. We have ordered curbside takeout twice now, and been disappointed both times. The first time, we ordered 2 Pizookies on Tuesday night when they are $3 off. They told us it would be 15 minutes. I arrived at curbside right on time and called the number posted. The phone just rang for 3 minutes. I hung up and went inside. They told me it wasn't ready yet and they would bring it out. It took another 10 minutes to come. When I got home, both pizookies were very thin and not hot. Not as good as pizookies usually are. Disappointed. This was 6 weeks ago or so. Yesterday we ordered a large pizza that is half off on Monday and a Pizookie. The pizza was half Mediterranean and half cheese/tomato. I arrived exactly when they told me it would be ready. Again I called, didn't take 3 minutes to answer this time, but they said it wasn't ready yet. A few minutes later a server came out and told me they made the pizza wrong and it was going to be a while longer. Another 15 minutes goes by and the bring the food out. I asked for the server to wait to make sure the pizza was correct. It had no tomatoes on the cheese and tomato half. He offered to go get me some tomatoes but I declined; I like the tomatoes on the pizza cooked, I don't want to eat them on the side."
H H.,"Austin, TX",0,2,,1.0,11/30/2017,"Take Out: Ordered lunch special for take out today.  Have never ordered food to go from them and probably wont be in the future.   When I went to pick up my order it was not ready and had to wait. When I was told it was ready there were no fries.  They went back in the kitchen and returned with my sweet potato fries which were ice cold, makes me wonder if they were left over from yesterday.  The avocado on my club sandwich was brown with green around the edges. Wish I would have taken a photo before i throw it away.  Words of advice:  Check your order and make sure it is all there and that it is fresh."
Lamanda B.,"Cedar Park, TX",203,111,64,2.0,12/14/2017,"First time coming here and it was quite disappointing. A great staff would make up for the food not being good, but that's not the case with BJ's. The best thing I had was the queso for an appetizer and pizookie for dessert. Our waiter stopped by the table all of 3 times unless we called on her. The sweet potato fries were dry and cold. The wing sauce was good but the wings were not crispy. They were extremely soft and I left them on the table when we left. This place looks like a great place to catch a game with friends but the food isn't good. It's just another food chain."
Joe P.,"Austin, TX",51,223,309,4.0,9/14/2017,My 1st time here in Austin my wife and along with her cousin stopped for Drinks. They have a wide selection of beer but was disappointed in that they didn't carry a good Stout. The BJ brand on tap was nitro brewed.. the taste  and experience is similar to  ordering a coke and it's flat....my wife had a great sour apple martini(s). The food is pretty good here and parking is plenty.
Heather T.,"Cedar Park, TX",0,7,11,5.0,12/19/2017,"Hey whatsup you guys! It's me, heather tolsin!!!!!! Prescription down above!!

John G.,"Providence, RI",1042,63,24,5.0,11/30/2017,Enjoyed a chicken dish here. Great service at the bar from.a new bartender. Will return.
Bhavan S.,"Austin, TX",0,1,,5.0,1/10/2018,I had ordered food for a corporate lunch in my office from BJ's Arbor Walk office. Edgard and his team provided awesome service right from booking the order to delivering and setting up food and billing. All of us loved the food and we would go to them again for catering.
Alyssa G.,"Cedar Park, TX",16,41,62,1.0,8/5/2017,Been coming here for years and have spent a ton of money at this establishment.  But this time coming here I was highly disappointed in the food presentation and mainly quality.  Let's start with water and lemons sounds easy but no I was give rotten lemons that were visibly brown and slimy.  Then I Ordered soup and salad Caesar salad and clam chowder was my choice.  Clam chowder comes out like warm and the potato wash mushy and clams very hard. Definitely not fresh at all.  And my salad was browning on the romaine lettuce. Such a disappointment.  As for my partner he asked for his wings well done then did not cook to order.  And his burger was over cooked.  Either management is not doing a good job at training or the cooks just truly do not care about there jobs.  Not sure if I will be returning.
Paul R.,"Cedar Park, TX",76,548,60,3.0,6/23/2017,"I've had lunch here a few times so it is about time I write a review. Yupper it's a chain and they have a menu that goes on for ever. I really wish these restaurants would just slim down their ginourmus (sic) menus. So we sat in the bar area for a late lunch and as you would imagine the lunch rush was over. I'm pretty sure there was only one server as service was pretty slow. Our server, Nick, did a good job but we should not be sitting for 10 minutes before our menus are provided. Plus it took quite a bit of time to get our beers and when they arrived it was sans mine, keg problem. I was ready to throw in the towel and just head over to In-N-Out but plus 1 overruled me. While we are on the topic of beer BJ's has a pretty extensive tap selection. Hopefully next time my Ballast Point IPA will be servable.  Lunch: I opted for a new menu item a Peruvian salad with shrimp. This salad is served warm with Quinoa and was excellent. Plus 1 had a chopped chicken salad and said it hit the spot. So in spite to the slow start it's alls well that ends well. I can see myself stopping by again for lunch and a few of their tap beers.... or maybe just for a beery beery good happy hour."
Doug W.,"Austin, TX",28,16,60,4.0,8/20/2017,"Had a seat at the bar this time and brought a date. The bartender was attentive and receptive. Thanks to her I was able to sample two beers on tap and settled on one of two amber beers called ""Oasis"". That went down quickly. Smooth and refreshing. We then ordered a new dessert, the ""Churro pizzookie"". Fantastic dessert. If they don't permanently add it to the menu, I'm gonna cry. Try it. It's amazing."
Scott K.,"Leander, TX",12,167,41,4.0,8/1/2017,"Celebrated my daughters 22nd birthday with family - mainly because of the Pazookies.  We had an amazing waitress (I wish I had written her name down) who made experience great.   My wife and I both had the Caesar Salad.  I usually like a lot more ""tang"" in my Caesar dressing so I felt it was missing some flavor.  Probably go with the ranch next time. It was rib night so I had the whole rack - honestly thought they were a little over done but flavor was still good.  They were average at best.   Daughter 1 had a Quinoa Bowl of some sorts - looked like it had some shrimp in it - she loved it.   Daughter 2 had Spaghetti & meatballs - she thought it tasted a little like Marie Calendars.   Wife had a sirloin which was perfect. Topped off with Pazookies which are always worth the trip.   Overall - Food is probably 3 stars / Service was 4 stars / Pazookie 5 star"
Madi M.,"Austin, TX",71,202,400,3.0,5/28/2017,"I went to get to go order from lunch menu, grilled chicken alfredo and mozzarella salad. Already at home I noticed that pasta was missing chicken and broccoli was yellow and old, not supposed to use those for cooking. Called to establishment and asked if I can just get replacement next day, give them another shot. Instead manager said he will make a refund right away. Which is fine with me. Does not matter. Point is if you want to make customer come back then refund is not an option. Offer to come back. I also took one star for service. Person on the phone was not aware of promotion coupon and a young man who took my order was not professional while interaction. Food is good, fried avocado rolls must try. But I will skip for a while."
Jenny L.,"Leander, TX",0,6,1,2.0,12/10/2017,We came here and had to wait 45 minutes just for the food.we got stuffed mushrooms but they weren't stuffed. The manger came over and we told her what happened she made it right. And the service was really bad till we said something.
Deborah M.,"Leander, TX",135,164,77,2.0,2/10/2017,"Arrived at 8:50 on a Friday night to find Bjs busy but not packed. We were seated immediately, then had twenty minutes to thoroughly read the entire menu and resort to staring at every server that passed us until we were finally greeted and our drink order was taken.  At 9:30 the food arrived and was hot and delicious. No complaints whatsoever with the pizza. However, our waitress didn't check on us, nor did she refill our empty drinks until we were done eating and we finally saw her and flagged her down. She brought the refill with the check.  Overall, good food and very poor service. I have worked in food service and I do understand the rush and what to expect. For the amount of customers, it could've been much better just if we had been checked on."
Sabina C.,"Austin, TX",58,6,,5.0,11/30/2017,Here tonight with my family and had the greatest experience with our server Hailey. She went above and beyond and provided such great service we will be coming back here regularly. This is a server every restaurant should fight over she's amazing!
Cooper T.,"Cedar Park, TX",0,2,,5.0,12/5/2017,"I had a great server. The food was good, service was quick, the environment was clean and not too loud. BJ'S is a chain that offers a wide selection of american cuisine. Their salads are great as are their burgers, sandwiches and pasta dishes."
Tom R.,"East Point, GA",0,5,,5.0,11/1/2017,"Great to welcome BJ's to Cedar Park.  I have already joined the BJ's Rewards Club.  My favorite lunch items include tomato caprese salad, spaghetti and meatballs with a garlic knot, tavern cut pizza, and an excellent Peruvian Quinoa.  All the soups were delicious-- although the tortilla soup was a bit too salty.  My two favorites are tomato bisque and broccoli cheddar."
Josh R.,"Leander, TX",2,63,13,3.0,1/31/2017,"Food, beverages, and service are great. The place is loud and if you get chips, the salsa is terrible. Definitely NOT a Texas born restaurant. The price is good and BJs brew master does attempt to surprise us from time to time. The Grande Crew killed it however the Brew Master once again just teased the crowd w a great beer and got lazy to add it to the menu. So the gang had to go back to Austin Beer Works for the brewskies."
Katie R.,"Cedar Park, TX",81,9,8,1.0,7/19/2017,"As a frequent BJs visitor, I crave the Peruvian dish most days. Today I came in to order just that and sadly I was beyond disappointed. Once my dish arrived the onions were still raw and crunchy, the shrimp no longer were the big ones but the small pasta style kind and the entire dish was dry and bland. Needless to say, I took 2-3 bites and pushed it away. As much as I enjoyed conversation with our server, he never once asked how our food was and simply just asked if I needed a box which I denied (almost an untouched dish)  A server and bartender of almost 10 years, I would NEVER not ask a customer how their food was ESPECIALLY if the food was untouched  I think it's safe to say I won't be craving that dish any longer  ($15 dish down the drain)"
Jessica D.,"Kempner, TX",0,10,2,3.0,8/12/2017,"The food is always good and the beer selection is excellent. However, this location needs to improve their service. This is the second time that I've had issues at this particular location. The appetizers came out lukewarm because they were in such a rush to serve them. The waitress tried to take my appetizer plate while I was still working on the appetizer to make room for my entree that came out before the appetizers were half eaten. Oh by the way my salad came out approximately 2 minutes after the appetizers. So we has appetizers, salad, and entrees all on the table at once. She dis keep checking to see if the food was good (just as the first bite was going in). She failed to take away actual empty dishes or glasses. It took 3 trips to get a second set of beverages....... She was rushing us to order dessert when we about half way through the entrees. As I said this is the second time that we have been rushed through our meal at this location. I contacted management last time and was assured that they would work on this, it looked like the manager was the one who brought my salad out.  Ohhh but now that we have our check there ""is no rush"". We love BJ's but will just drive the 20 minutes to another location next time."
Cassee A.,"Lakeway, TX",2,86,79,5.0,6/30/2017,"Pretty decent happy hour choices.  I really enjoy their flatbread pizzas even though IMO they are way overpriced so I rarely order that.  The mini deep dish during happy hour suits me along with $4 BJ's drafts.   Always friendly bar staff, thank you Liz!!! Good for groups, couples, singles, anything goes."
Justin O.,"Cedar Park, TX",187,462,1812,4.0,1/31/2017,"We enjoy coming here for their beer and their flat bread pizza. Occasionally we will order something more, but this is a fun place to grab a pint and an appetizer after a movie or just because you want a quick bite. Our favorite is the pepperoni extreme flatbread with pepperoni sliced, diced and julienned. It comes with a five cheese blend and their zesty sauce. We like to sit in the bar area too, no wait no fuss. There are also tv's for sports if you're interested. Their beers are really good too. Their beer separates them from other chains that offer similar food. Our favorites are their light switch lager and the brew house blonde. I've tried them all, and they're all good in their own way. The menu is massive, so anyone should be able to find something that suits their appetite. They also offer a gluten free crust pizza. The place packs out sometimes so be aware if you want to go on a weekend night."
Jackie S.,"Plainfield, IN",83,1,3,5.0,5/27/2017,"This place is AMAZING to eat and drink at!! The drinks like the Strawberry Splash and Mad Crazy Mango IPA are wonderful, the BBQ chicken chopped salad and Hickory Brisket and Bacon burger are some of my favorite things to eat!! The prices are good for the amount of food you get and the service is ALWAYS GREAT!! Definitely will go back!!"
Jay G.,"San Antonio, TX",0,1,,1.0,12/2/2017,Do not come here on college football championship Saturday or during a Arsenal Man U match because apparently you aren't allowed to cheer at this sports bar.
Bonnie T.,"Cedar Park, TX",61,55,43,5.0,7/7/2016,"This was my third time eating here. We came out for dinner with my sister and niece before they head back to Massachusetts. Rainy was our server and she was amazing! The food was excellent, the service was great, and desert was awesome!!  The restaurant is always clean. The atmosphere is fun. Can't wait to come back."
Brian H.,"Leander, TX",1,6,2,3.0,9/3/2017,Every time I've ordered here via online the food is either not ready when I arrive at the promised time or I get home to find the order is incorrect. Most recently I ordered online and I'm still sitting here 20 minutes after the promised time - keeping in mind I've already paid for the meal!
Jason L.,"Leander, TX",88,81,64,5.0,2/19/2017,"My Fiance and I went to BJ's for the first time at this location and was my first time ever. I will say It's a very clean establishment and inviting atmosphere. Spaced well, not cramped and that matters to us. We enjoyed the night with drinks, dinner and dessert.  I had the Bacon and Guac cheddar Burger and my finance had the Roast Beef Dip sandwich. She thoroughly enjoyed her sandwich, my burger was well cooked and presented, and plenty of food for the price, but I will say the beef was a little bland, could have used a little more salt/pepper/flavor, but overall was a delicious plate. The service was exceptional, our waiter was very kind and attentive, fun conversation as well. We were served by Todd E (tipped him around 45%, he was that good), a young lad and very professional. The environment was friendly and the dessert was more than we expected, as well as delicious (you must try the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Pizookie! Melissa has the salted caramel, ummm). I will say their Tatonka Stout was absolutely delicious (never had a better authentic beer), not to mention 9% alcohol, but you wouldn't know it, as it was so smooth and refreshing with a hint of coffee/chocolate flavor, exceptional dark beer, and I love that. Go to BJ's Steakhouse on Whitestone Cedar Park, TX when you get a chance, well managed, well served, great food! We weren't going for the signature Entrees, that's for another night, but I'm sure they win all the same. Thank you for a great Valentine's date, we will be back!"
Eric D.,"Austin, TX",35,63,11,5.0,7/14/2016,"Rainy was everything you could ask for in a bartender, cordial, knowledgeable, and attentive. She guided me through a couple of brew choices that didn't disappoint, offering tastes of each to make sure I would like them.  Avocado egg rolls were very nice, crispy and hot on the outside with the avocado still cool in the center. Tamarind sauce accompanying was just the right complement.  Ahi tuna salad was fresh and good quality. In all my first trip to BJ's would be hard to improve upon."
Eben L.,"Leander, TX",0,1,,3.0,8/10/2017,"My first time walking into this restaurant i thought ""Wow! this looks like a nice place!"". It definitely stands out compared to what's around it. However, as time went on, that charm slowly faded away. I have been to this restaurant 5 times in total.  4 out of 5 times i have recieved cold/ lukewarm food. Ive ordered (In order of visits), Vegetable penne, Clam chowder, Baked Ziti, Lentil soup and Couscous mac and cheese.  First I was given the shrimp penne instead of the vegetable one which normally would would be fine except I'm allergic to shrimp. when I did recieve the correct order it was lukewarm. The Clam chowder I had suffered the same issue, as did the Baked ziti and the Couscous. Even the garlic knot was cold in the middle! I also had the Peruvian quinoa bowl which I found to be bland.  Service was kind of hit or miss for me . I did enjoy some of the appetizers I tried like the Stuffed mushrooms and the Pita nachos they were pretty good. The Orange cream soda I have to admit is a favorite of mine there.  Also, they do seem to have a wide selection of alcoholic beverages which I myself weren't interested in but I'm sure for those who are will enjoy that aspect.  Overall, this place is pretty average in my opinon. It's hard for me to say that because I REALLY wanted to like this place! With the abundance of mexican food around here I was looking for something different.  I just couldn't believe how consistantly I was recieving cold food. Not to mention this place isn't the cheapest! Leaving tonight with two Irish root beers, three entrées, an appetizer and dessert  for 70$ hardly felt worth it. This will most likely be my last visit. Disappointing."
Sean A.,"Austin, TX",61,10,,5.0,1/19/2017,"I've been coming here for awhile now. They have never let me down so far! Their own brews are incredible and worth sampling them all. The wait staff and bartenders are always friendly and prompt.  The food is really good. I'll admit, it cost more than what it's worth, but you're also paying for the environment that you're in. It's big and open. If you're ever wanting to go watch a football game, hands down this is the best place. You won't find tvs anywhere else hat are bigger than these! Combine that with great food and drinks and you have a winner! Great place all around. I would definitely recommend them!"
Malie P.,"Copperas Cove, TX",90,66,108,4.0,4/14/2016,"The food was delicious but service was a tiny bit slow! Our server was very nice and polite! Being from Hawaii, any place that has Poke, I'll get the dish! The ahi poke was good, I've had better. It was served with avocado and wonton chips.  I also ordered the fire roasted Barbacoa chicken with black beans and brown rice! IT WAS DELICIOUS! I wiped my plate clean. It was the just the right around of spicy and the rice and beans complimented it.  The cream soda here was delicious as well!"
Diddy D.,"Austin, TX",0,24,3,1.0,3/5/2017,"I was about to write my own review and then saw Deborah M from 2/10/17. why bother, I'll just cut/paste because it was the same damn experience! (with a variation) Sat night, 7pm, 30 min wait. get shown to a table up against the wall, big enough for 2 but 3 people? when I pointed that out (and there were other 4-place tables right next to it), the hostess unfolded the 6"" extension from underneath and walked off without saying a word. Naturally, it was filthy from not being cleaned in awhile and when the waitress FINALLY showed up I pointed it out. She was polite enough to check on other table availability and moved us right next to it. The NEW waitress FINALLY showed up, and from there it was the same....until halfway through my good tasting salad. Then I was like, wait a second, doesn't my Asian Chopped Salad come with chicken breast? Dug through the rest of the salad, nothing, not even chopped up chicken. Already annoyed by the restaurant we finished and left. Check the menu online later...yep, comes with a missing chicken breast.  Jesus, how does a place like this stay in business with the apathetic wait help? The food was fine, but WTF? Are the Cedar Park/Leander residents so desperate for mid-level w/high-prices dining options they'll put up with this crap?"
Grace L.,"Cedar Park, TX",0,9,15,5.0,7/15/2017,"Great restaurant, has all sorts of beer. The stakes are awesome. And the desert are fabulous"
Cindy C.,"Leander, TX",0,8,,5.0,7/2/2017,"My family loves BJs brewhouse because we can all find something we love. This time, our server brought out a kids starter for my two children with a bread roll and fruit bowl for each which kept my children happy until their mac and cheese arrived. We ordered the honey Sriracha Brussels sprouts appetizer which was beyond delicious. If you think you don't like Brussels sprouts, you must order this dish! The blood orange pomegranate sangria was also very good. My husband ordered the deep dish classic combo pizza, and he loved it. I ordered the lentil and ancient grain soup which was an impressive vegetarian dish for a restaurant that is known for its meat based offerings. All in all we were very happy with our visit, and we will be sure to come again."
Eddie F.,"Miami Beach, FL",46,116,206,4.0,11/13/2016,"Good atmosphere, decent foods and very cheerful friendly bartender. Nice time to spend in Sunday afternoon Austin!"
Jae R.,"Austin, TX",0,27,,1.0,10/4/2017,I'd rate them a minus zero... seriously nothing was good about my visit here to this location... very poor customer service and extra junk in the dirty utensils like a long strand of hair and the food in one of the plates had some unknown item in it too... I just don't understand how such an expensive building in a nice shopping center environment can be so horribly disgusting.  Maybe it was the worst crew working the shift (it was lunchtime).  Good luck if you eat here.
Christina D.,"Leander, TX",4,25,34,5.0,3/22/2016,"Great place to relax and enjoy meals with friends and family. Although, yesterday we decided to get curbside service to take advantage of their amazing 50% all Large Deep Dish and tavern pizzas.  The chicken, bacon, ranch pizza was the best! Our order was ready on time and still hot when I got it home 15 mins later.  We will definitely be coming back when we want to dine out or eat on the go."
Judy L.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",5,7,,1.0,5/19/2017,"I was so excited and looking forward to get a deep dish pizza, but when the pizza came, it had absolutely no cheese and the crust was extremely thin!!! Nowhere like how a deep dish pizza should be!!! The flavor was terrible as well, and the mushroom was so thin that they look like tree barks!!! Absolutely terrible pizza experience!!! So disappointed! Will never come back ever again!!"
Karin N.,"78704 (South Austin), Austin, TX",5,97,6,1.0,1/29/2017,"Service was slow, my burger was medium rare when it should have been medium, and the silverware I was given was dirty. Really disappointed as this was our first time to ever eat here."
