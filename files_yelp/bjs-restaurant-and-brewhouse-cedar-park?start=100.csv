Brian W.,"Austin, TX",6,6,1,1.0,4/5/2016,"Staff is trying, kitchen is not and management must be absent.  2 out 3 visits equal bad experience.  Good elsewhere but not this location."
Mae D.,"Cedar Park, TX",0,24,,2.0,9/4/2016,"Restaurant was clean w/waiting time despite not being busy. I ordered a kale & brussel sprout salad. When my salad arrived there was neither kale or brussel sprouts and instead, general salad greens. I mentioned this to my waitress, but accepted the delivered salad (to avoid another long wait time for food), and w/the understanding that I expected a price adjustment on my bill. I did get the bill adjusted. My mother's salad ingredients were under seasoned (even for a salad/it was the Santa Fe salad) and my husband's burger (jalapeño) was bland. While our waitstaff was nice, the overall staff seemed hurried (it was not busy), irritated by questions or in the case of the manager on duty, comment-less regarding the dish error. There was nothing spectacular noted about this place. Our family would not return."
Joe H.,"Cedar Park, TX",2,8,,3.0,4/25/2015,"First time at a BJs. I ordered a double Jameson's, neat, and got a chilled glass of WATER with a *splash* of whiskey in. Seriously the thing was at least %70 water. What an insult to Ireland and to whiskey. We might give them a shot again because my wife really liked her flatbread pizza, and our waitress was fantastic. In general though, any place that cash grabs so horrendously on already extremely high-margin sales like whiskey should be avoided."
Kelley S.,"Austin, TX",53,38,6,4.0,4/15/2016,Pretty decent lunch special. I got the half sandwich and salad and the portion sizes were good.
Mike W.,"Leander, TX",32,27,,1.0,10/10/2014,"This must the place that all parents bring all of their screaming brats.  Was sandwiched between two tables of parents who thought it was cute and funny when their kids screamed at the too of their lungs, ran across the and kicked the back of their booth.  Chuck E Cheez has less noisy brats than this place.  The food wasn't much better than the atmosphere. bland flat bread pizza.   The service and beer selection was good."
Chris M.,"Leander, TX",1,5,,4.0,10/23/2014,"My wife and I tried BJ's today for lunch and we were pleasantly suprised. I guess our impression was that it was a bar/sports pub. We were wrong. The staff is almost over dressed and the layout of the interior is very pleasant. They still had about 4 TVs on every wall, but that was ok. Bar was impressive and so was the house brewed beers. We will be coming back in the evening for a date night. Might keep the kids away from this one so it can be just ours....and also avoid any major sporting events that are on TV. I bet the vibe changes. Food was tasty and presented very well. Lots of choices to pick from too. We will be going back for sure."
Erin G.,"Pflugerville, TX",9,49,11,5.0,9/6/2015,"Mica behind the bar is amazing! Very personable, service was fast and the food was delicious. Have been to this location many times, and KC and Catalina and Andrea are also amazing. Especially for a chain, this place is the bomb!"
Vidonni G.,"San Antonio, TX",28,16,6,4.0,4/17/2016,The wait is average 15-20 minutes for lunch. I always get the Parmesan crusted chicken. Amazing dish. They have a great black cherry made from BJs.
Matt B.,"Leander, TX",12,2,13,4.0,12/12/2014,"Great beer selection, the deep dish pizza is good and the food has been consistent. Being able to get on the wait list ahead and pay with the app is icing on the cake. Great spot after hockey."
Robert B.,"Leander, TX",115,37,17,3.0,10/23/2015,"Evening started well. Food was great, drinks were good however, both the kitchen and the bar got caught in the weeds.  It took 30 minutes to get pizzookie delivered not to mention the lost drink order.  Other tables around us had issues too.  3 stars for the good food and drinks.  Hope it gets better."
Ashlie J.,"Cedar Park, TX",0,8,2,3.0,9/23/2016,"I'm giving 3 stars because every server Ive ever had at this place has been amazing. My boyfriend and I used to be regulars here (probably twice a week) for a few months but things just kept getting worse and worse. The food used to be good, but it's turned very inconsistent. Ingredients missing from dishes, sloppy presentation, cold. The greeters at the front are NEVER friendly. Not once. Very mean glares when we walk in since day one. There was a day where I even almost had to ask our waiter if we could be moved because the one who is always there in the afternoon would not stop glaring at me. She's always there when we like to eat (around 2-4pm) so we started trying to come later in the day to avoid her. We never leave less than $20 tips, we clean up after ourselves, we laugh with the rest of the staff, so I'm not sure what's eating the dolls at the front. I really do miss going here. Maybe when my boyfriend gets back from visiting family in Australia they will have re hired new staff for the front. It's been over a month since I've returned and I'm dying for an avocado roll and pink Cadillac martini. I can handle inconsistent food, but mean girls make EVERYONE uncomfortable."
nick g.,"Austin, TX",2,6,,1.0,8/30/2015,"This BJ'suuuucks. Come for lunch, stay for dinner b/c it takes at least an hour to cook your order under the heat lamps. I'll go to Denny's for a better salad, or ... Faster service. Or drink refills... Since my whole family sat with empty glasses during the entire meal (I'm not a camel or a cactus so... Yeah, having a little water with my meal might have earned an extra star.  Good luck to you and the hostess who cannot count to five and tried to sit us at a booth for 4. Brilliant!"
Lacey P.,"Austin, TX",34,306,95,2.0,10/13/2014,"I agree with the other reviewers... Terrible Service - we were seated quickly and brought drinks in average time.  After we ordered fish tacos & half sandwich/soup combo it took 35 minutes to get our food.  Our server seated 2 cops (and others) after us and they all got their food before us.  I would understand if it was a well done steak/burger order but our entree items were easy.  Also took a long time to get a drink refill.  Will never come back at lunch time again.  There was a good crowd there but it was definitely not packed by any means.  Waiter's only excuse was he had a big table before us.  Weird since the 2 cops got their food easily enough. FREEZING - it was so cold I could not wait to leave.  I was wearing jeans, boots, & long sleeve sweater and I was still so cold my nose was starting to run.  Not exaggerating at all it had to be at least 67 degrees if not colder.  Even my husband was cold who is NEVER cold. Two Stars because the food was tasty.  If we finally do venture back it will be at dinner time so we are prepared for a 2 hour meal with a winter coat on to survive the frosty cold atmosphere. Other BJ's have the same great food, highly recommend pizookie and avocado egg rolls. Notes:  has TVs so good for game watching, good beer selections, full bar, take out available.  We called the manager to let him know the issues and he recommended the take out option if you are in a hurry (sounds like being slow is a common issue) also he did apologize for the bad service and said it would be addressed ASAP."
Tom F.,"Leander, TX",0,9,4,1.0,6/19/2015,"Ridiculous wait time for seating, and food order, and delivered to table. You're busy? Hire more servers! $12.95 for an HEB pre-made quality Caesar salad with 'grilled' chicken. Oh, I think that's too hard on the HEB pre-made salad!  The entree portion salad was quite small, the 'grilled' chicken was scant, and 'hardly' resembled any 'grilled' qualities. And by the way, news flash. You put Parmesan cheese in a Caesar salad.  Would not recommend this cookie cutter 'sports bar'."
Shannon J.,"Cedar Park, TX",6,45,,2.0,10/3/2014,"It's a new place, so it takes time to work the kinks out, I suppose. The service was very good, but the place is *so*freaking*cold*!  My son and I were shivering and it was so unpleasant that I requested that our meals be ""to go.""  My kids waited in the warmth of the front while I paid and waited for the meals. (Not at the table, but off to the side where I wouldn't freeze.) $40 with tip (not the waitstaff' fault that the place is cold), so I could take the meals home to eat.  It had been a very long week and I wanted to relax.  I should have just stopped at Costco - $40 there would have bought a lot of their pre-prepared food. Not very happy at all for blowing $40.  The food tasted decent - it's not exactly haute cuisine there, just predictable decent quality - but how the trip ended up, again, a stop into Costco would have been a better value."
N. H.,"Austin, TX",0,19,3,1.0,9/2/2016,"The service wasn't good at all tonight.  Neither was the food.  Got the chicken fried steak, it was ok, but the mixed veggies where half raw and no seasoning what so ever.  It is like they took a package from HEB and threw it in the microwave for 30 seconds and dumped it on the plate.  The entire staff seemed not to care about their jobs.  Wait staff had to be reminded multiple time of drink orders and condiments.  The front end staff, all 5 of them, was silent as we walked out the door, no thank you no have a good night.  The place screams bad management.  Wait staff don't care and the kitchen doesn't care if their food tastes good.  Will never go back to this location ever."
Tammy B.,"Austin, TX",0,5,,5.0,3/2/2016,"My family loves this restaurant and the location is great. We received great service from Andrew M. He's friendly, very knowledgeable of the menu, and promptly served us while checking in for refills/check etc.  Excellent service! Another perk about this chain restaurant is I signed up for FREE for Reward Points and earn free menu items...LOVE THIS!"
D M.,"Theater District, Manhattan, NY",0,8,,4.0,8/25/2016,Service was a little blah..never refilled water and the chicken was kinda dry this time but the beer was good
David L.,"Cedar Park, TX",0,38,5,5.0,11/7/2014,"Great food and awesome service!  Our waitress ""Brittany"" was GREAT! The Pizookies are amazing!"
Anthony R.,"Leander, TX",76,26,10,5.0,8/3/2015,"First off, this is a chain restaurant. Just like when you eat at chili's, don't expect high-quality ingredients or farm fresh produce. Now, if you can get over that and not be a total hippie, this place is great! I love it for the convenience. They have a giant menu with practically any food you would be in the mood for. They also have healthy options as well as gluten-free stuff. Their house beers are also good! And you can get them for a good price during their many happy hour times. Deserts here are fantastic, their pazookie dishes are too good. And the also offer a unique rewards system that could even give you vip access to make reservations there."
