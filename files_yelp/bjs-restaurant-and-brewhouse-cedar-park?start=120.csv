Jeremy A.,"Pflugerville, TX",3,156,46,5.0,11/3/2014,What a wonderful experience.    I went there with co-workers for lunch today and our server Amber was excellent.     She was attentive and pleasant.   The food was perfect.    We will definitely go back.
Rachael W.,"Hutto, TX",0,9,1,4.0,3/15/2015,"This was my first visit to a BJ's and my first impression overall was a good one. The wait staff and hostesses were friendly and attentive. The menu has a good deal of variety, so finding something for everyone in a group is practically guaranteed. Looking around our table, everything looked really good, which makes me want to go back and try some of those dishes.  I had the Asian Chopped Salad and was completely delighted. It was the perfect meal portion - plenty to fill me up and not waste uneaten salad, which often happens when most restaurants serve ridiculously large salads that must be eaten or thrown out, since salads do not make good leftovers.  This salad was a beautifully crafted medley of veggies, mandarin oranges, sesame seeds and cilantro and a generous serving of grilled chicken, all tossed in a delicate honey ginger dressing and topped with crispy wonton strips. What I loved about the dressing is that it was the perfect blend of sweet and tangy and did not coat everything, so the fresh flavor of the other ingredients came shining through.  The only downside I would mention is that it took a while for the meal to arrive once we had ordered. I attribute this to the kitchen and not the wait staff, who did a great job. Slow service is something I am willing to overlook the first time, and I will be back to try some of the other dishes. That said, if this proves to be a pattern, I may not be so quick to return again after that.  For now, 1 thumb up and the other at about a 70-degree angle. :)"
Amanda L.,"Leander, TX",1,15,24,2.0,12/4/2015,"Meh. just Meh. order a deep dish pizza, a salad and the fried artichokes, they were all a disappointment. I've had better experiences at other BJ's locations."
Kim P.,"Cedar Park, TX",0,45,1,2.0,7/10/2016,It's a sports bar with Bennigan's type foods and menu (not much fresh about it). The only reason I am not giving it one star is because my family liked the pizza and the waitress (although slow) made an effort to make things right.
John D.,"Cedar Park, TX",0,28,1,4.0,1/2/2015,"I 1st went to Cedar Park BJ's a few weeks back for a late lunch. Ate off the reasonably priced lunch menu and got the Southern Fried Chicken which is a breaded and fried chicken breast fillet. It sat on top of a pile of mashed potatoes surrounded by cut corn kernels. Gravy was spooned over the top. Long story short: it transported me back to the 1960's to fond memories of my mom's very similar dinners (except she didn't serve me a top notch pint of beer). Chicken breast fillets are easily dried out but this one was on-the-mark moist. The seasoning and flavors were also aligned with my tastes. Portion size was a good fit for lunch. A thumbs up. I invited my wife to BJ's for lunch today and we had an equally pleasant experience. This time we started with a calamari appetizer and found it and the two dipping sauces delicious. My wife ordered the same chicken dish I had before and said she also was happily pulled back to memories of her mom's cooking. I had the lunch special BBQ platter with a pulled pork slider, a BBQ chicken breast fillet, skinny fries, a dab of coleslaw and BBQ sauce. It was all good. The breast fillet was just as moist as the fried version had been previously. Good job! That was the food and now for the service. The shortest way to say it is that the greeting hostesses, bartenders, waitpersons, buspersons and ""managerial"" staff all came across as warm blooded humans with developed personalities. The only con is that the wait for the food/drinks seemed a bit long. I am more than willing to trade that for the quality of the food and friendliness of the staff. Completely recommend you give it a try."
C C.,"Cedar Park, TX",3,51,51,4.0,11/8/2015,"In spite of all the bad reviews of this place, I and my family like it....for lunch.  They have a decent lunch menu with fairly good prices.  Prices for the same items (with sometimes larger portions) are more expensive on the weekends. Why do restaurants continue to do this?!  I usually get a salad. Kids get burger and/or pizza.  Spouse gets a chicken dish.  Salads are large with a solid amount of meat.  Pizzas are generous and the fries are thin and tasty.  It can get a bit loud in this place, but we expect that.  It's a sports bar.  Sure do wish they'd create some outdoor seating and maybe be able to open it up when the weather is nice.  Otherwise, we like this place.  It's a good selection of the usual American foods.  We like it."
Michael S.,"Liberty Hill, TX",32,92,22,5.0,3/26/2015,"Great food and service, Spencer was a great waiter..service with a smile the chicken Mediterranean tacos are the bomb.looking at some of the negative reviews and must say been here 3times and always had great service and food !"
Greg M.,"Cedar Park, TX",2,24,,1.0,6/12/2015,"Lunch Today, ordered my burger medium. It came out well done and took 18 minutes to get it. I didn't have time to send it back on my lunch hour.  Scratch this place off as a place to go for lunch.  Greg"
Katie R.,"Leander, TX",5,156,1,4.0,10/8/2014,"I like this chain quite a bit.  I think the food is a little pricey for what it is but the atmosphere and service is definitely worthwhile and the new location definitely provided the experience I am used to having here. Think ""upscale Cheddar's with a bigger menu.""  I always get the Ahi Tuna salad-  it feels like an indulgence yet is definitely on the healthy side of their menu."
Earl M.,"Austin, TX",0,33,,2.0,6/13/2016,They serve something that resembles food and drink.  That's about all you can say.  Lots of better places to go.
Katy L.,"Austin, TX",0,11,6,1.0,7/11/2016,The food was good but we've been to this location twice and had terrible service both times. We are both in the service industry and are mostly forgiving but they forgot our order the first time and didn't discount our order the second time. Never got an opportunity to order second drinks and never got checked on till it was time to bring the check. One star for the good food but none for the service. Will not be returning to this location.
Brent P.,"Cedar Park, TX",1,38,,1.0,12/22/2015,"Don't waste your time or money.  Bad start with the menu being dirty to the point I needed to wash my hands after looking through it.  I ordered Chips and Salsa for a starter, but that never made it to our table despite me placing the initial order and then reminding our server two more times.  Once our main dish arrived he asked if we still wanted the chips and salsa.  Really?   Got chicken fried steak for main dish for $14.50. The side veggies (mix of broccoli, cauliflower, carrots) looked like they were poured right out of the frozen bag, obviously not fresh.  The chicken fried steak looked good.  It had two nice sized steaks separated by mash potatoes in the middle.  The steak on the right was tasty and really good.  The steak on the left was bland and not seasoned.  Kinda weird I thought considering they were both cooked at the same time. I won't be back and would not recommend to anyone based on extremely poor service and below average food."
John K.,"Austin, TX",7,74,1,2.0,4/6/2015,"Upon entering the hostess were nice.  A little unseasoned and raw but trying.  Then we got sat and it took the server 5 minutes just to greet us and when he did he was talking and moving very slowly like he had all the time in the world.  I took over and started increasing the pace.   We ordered the corn fritters which were nicely done and arrived in a respectable timeframe.  We ordered the jambalaya, the scampi pasta and a burger.   We informed him the burger MUST be cooked medium or i would send it back.  Guess what?  Well done.  Geez.    The jambalaya was good but waaay too heavy on the cajun spice.  If you put too much cajun spice it becomes too spicy and salty, like mine was.  I ate all of it because i knew if i complained of it being too spicy and salty they would roll their eyes thinking i didnt know what i was talking about.  Too much of anything is not good people.   When leaving the manager just stared at me without thanking me or saying goodbye.  Odd."
Mark R.,"Cedar Park, TX",10,29,50,3.0,8/7/2015,"The menu is huge and the food is as described.  No issues with the food or the service at any BJs.  The one thing that drives me crazy is the system of assigning a table then being escorted to it.  It always seems cumbersome and confusing to one of the three people involved.  The last time I went to BJs, they asked if we were members of their rewards program (don't get me started), then assigned a table number.  A little fumbling around, three people looking at each other like something is wrong, then one says, I will assign to a different table then move them.  I don't really care.  Assign the table and take me there.  This system of confusion happens all the time, but it's not enough to keep me from coming back.  Just gets my blood pressure up before a meal ;-)"
Dori D.,"Austin, TX",11,83,50,2.0,4/4/2015,While they have a good beer selection the food is just average. The service had always been bad even when they aren't busy. It's very loud so bit a good place to go if you want to chat and the tables at the bar ate horrible.
Michelle M.,"Cedar Park, TX",6,38,64,4.0,12/22/2014,"We sat in a booth in the bar area and service was kind of slow. My soup was okay, but my son really didn't like his salad. The manager walked by and noticed and immediately offered to bring him something else.  When my son said he was fine, he just didn't read the menu good enough, the manager insisted on removing the salad from the bill. That's good customer service!  We'll be back!"
Steven B.,"Austin, TX",40,43,,4.0,1/31/2015,"Deep dish pizza, microbrew beer and a pizzookie!? Yes please. Or at least if I am forgetting to count calories that day. Overall the quality is consistent and most of the food selections are good. It's the same BJs that you'll find all over the country."
Ron O.,"Cedar Park, TX",0,1,,5.0,5/3/2016,"The wait staff and bartender were excellent! The deep dish, chicken-bacon-ranch pizza was awesome!"
Suraj M.,"Austin, TX",42,126,31,4.0,1/1/2015,My first visit to a BJs Brewery and it was s perfectly fine visit. The service was superb. The drink (I got a margarita) was average and the burger was above average. It was a pleasant experience and I'll be back!
Chelsea M.,"Great Hills, Austin, TX",9,15,7,2.0,11/4/2014,"Went on a Sunday afternoon with a group of 6. Including my elderly grandmother and two small children. We expected a wait to get a table and were fine with the 20 minute wait. But after we actually sat down we were practically ignored. It took a total of 2 hours after sitting to finally leave. I could not believe it- we put in our order as soon as the waitress came and it took over and hour to get to us. All the other servers and managers seemed to not notice how long it was taking for everyone- including other tables around us- to get served. I live in the town center and was very excited about this restaurant opening- I am very disappointed and will not be spending any more of my money there, even though my burger was very good- hence the 2 stars."
