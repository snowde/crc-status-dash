Natalie N.,"Burnet, TX",5,6,,4.0,1/1/2015,"This was the first time we had gone to this location and I was impressed, as expected. The service was great, the drinks were great, and the food was great. I love going to BJ's because I know we'll always have a good experience."
N S.,"Austin, TX",0,7,5,5.0,1/22/2016,"Two adults dining on a Friday night around 9pm...we were seated right away. Our waitress Catalina greeted us with a smile and bubbly personality. She engaged in small chat without over-doing it and got right to our drink orders. The appetizers we got were $2 off so we ordered the NEW Root Beer Glazed Ribs and the Crisp Potato Skins Platter. The mini pizzas were half off - we picked up the Great White and the Pepperoni Extreme. The ribs came out first and were awesome...Catalina recommend the ribs over the wings...good call. But honestly that glaze would have tasted good on a piece of bark...its THAT good. The potato skins were brought out quick too but they were over fried...very crispy. The mini pizzas were awesome and we definitely had enough to take home. We got FREE Pizookies for signing up for the BJ's Premier Rewards...fine with us! As we were waiting for one salted caramel and one peanut butter dessert Natalie, the manager, stopped by the table to see how our meal was. She offered to remove the plates (nice) but noticed the potato skins were picked over. I mentioned them being a bit over done and with a super genuine smile she said she'd remove them off of our order. Thought it wasn't fair to pay for food that didn't meet our expectations...and that, folks, is why THIS BJ's gets 5 stars....service with a smile wins every time!"
Callie R.,"Austin, TX",0,14,,1.0,10/5/2014,We just ordered a take out house salad with onion and grilled chicken. The girl told us everything that was on a house salad we asked to add onion and chicken. My husband picked it up and got home I opened it and we got a pile of chopped lettuce onion and grilled chicken only.  It's really annoying that after talking to the girl and then a manager when ordering asking for a specific house salad WITH onion and chicken they still got our order wrong...  We like bjs but I wish it wasn't so hard to take an order.
Travis W.,"Leander, TX",0,6,,2.0,3/23/2015,"BJ's Brewhouse is one of my favorite places to eat and grab an Amber Oasis. One of many beers they brew themselves. The menu is great and has tons of options. The Cedar Park location, however, is no good. Both my wife and brother-in-law got food poisoning from an appetizer they ordered. The service is slow and unattentive. My wife will never go back so now I'm forced to eat BJs when I happen to be in the Round Rock area or close to the domain."
John W.,"Leander, TX",0,4,,1.0,12/8/2014,"First let me clarify that I typically enjoy this chain...That being said when they were planning on opening in Cedar Park I was quite excited. We waited until it had been open a few weeks before stopping in. Our first experience was on a Friday and we just wanted apps and drinks so we chose to sit at the bar. The service from the bar staff is awful. Not focused on guests and just worried about the side-work or each other. Two of the bartenders came across so arrogant towards us as well as a couple next to us. There were young children sitting at the bar with their mom so we were not impressed by that either. We received cold calamari and after a few bites we just asked for the check and left- NOT HAPPY Well we blew off the first visit and decided to give it another try. This was last Saturday 12-6-14 around 4-5pm. We could beat the crowds and enjoy some apps and drinks. We sat ourselves in the bar table area as instructed by the hostess. We sat their for 5 minutes without anyone greeting us even though the waitress served the table right next to us and certainly glanced at our empty table top. We finally were greeted by a spastic female server who seemed extremely overwhelmed with a two table section. Our drinks came out fine and then we waited for her to come back to get our food order....never happened so we just got our tab and walked out.  The icing on the cake took place as we were leaving. I walked up to the hostess stand where a young male manager was standing and requested a comment card...he looked at me very puzzled  (as if he did not understand what a comment card was), he looked around and said they did not really have any cards...I continued to look at him and told him I would find away to leave a comment.....his reply; ""Oh OK, "" Really??? ...The cool thing about restaurants is that customers ""vote"" with their feet!! I will not be going back to CP BJ's again. So disappointed in the service, the hospitality, and the carelessness of the inexperienced management team. GET IT TOGETHER"
Lachelle S.,"Cedar Park, TX",78,16,,5.0,6/30/2015,"I had a fantastic experience when I went to BJs in Cedar Park. In California, I frequented a BJs that was across the street from where I worked and it was always great. My expectations were high but the BJs Pizza in Cedar Park did not disappoint. I was seated promptly and my food came quickly. I ordered the Stuffed Mushrooms and a Fresh Watermelon and Feta salad that was wonderful. I definitely recommend this place for dinner with the family or a night out with friends."
G K.,"Austin, TX",25,95,80,3.0,1/6/2015,Nice place. Decent service. Your Average american food. For a much better burger i could have headed to hopdoddy or even in and out next door. Good selection of beers though. Will definitely come back for some good beer!!!
Tammy G.,"Cedar Park, TX",0,4,,2.0,10/10/2015,This BJ's can't seem to get it right. Every time I go there is a problem with my food. I love their beer selection but I'll go to the one in Round Rock or the one off Mopac from now on.
Chris L.,"Cedar Park, TX",0,3,,1.0,9/28/2015,Horrible overpriced food. My plates and silverware were dirty and had to be sent back. But server was very attentive.
Charles S.,"Leander, TX",1,75,,4.0,12/3/2015,"Have eaten at BJ's a few more times in the last year. They have gotten better, usually no problems now with wrong order or slow service. Not sure they still have enough high chairs. Still wish they served the wedge fries the other BJ's serve. I am still a fan though."
V. K.,"Cedar Park, TX",3,4,,1.0,6/7/2015,"My family and I have been regulars here since they opened. The food has been good however they have a recurring issue with having dirty dishes/silverware being brought to the table. I have spoken to a manager each time this has happened and they assure me that it will be taken care of.  We went in again last night and ordered pizza. The waitress brought us plates, all of which had red sauce all over them. Clearly they had not been washed from the previous person that used them. Again we asked for clean dishes. I wonder what their kitchen looks like.  And this morning 2 of my family members woke up with food poisoning. We will NEVER eat at this place again."
Summer W.,"Cedar Park, TX",0,9,,5.0,12/20/2015,"We have been to this BJs at least a dozen times since it opened and have never had a negative experience! The waitstaff is energetic and engaged with their customers and the food is just delicious! We bring all out of town guests here, with a ton of success!"
Diana C.,"Cedar Park, TX",0,10,11,2.0,10/15/2015,The only reason I keep coming here is because my husband makes me as they have Guinness on draught. Each time the food I've ordered is under whelming. I got the BJ's Special deep dish pizza...nothing special there. Hubs got the garlic parm wings which he said were good but then got a stomach ache later bc they were so greasy. Today's visit is probably the last time I'll go there. I'll just have to buy the hubs a kegerator with Guinness on tap.
Pam S.,"Lynn Haven, FL",3,6,1,4.0,10/8/2014,We were greeted with friendly faces. We were seated immediately even though it was extremely crowded. The service was great and the food was delicious. The best stuffed mushrooms. The flat bread pizzas were really yummy. They make their own root beer and it is the best!
Chelcey D.,"Leander, TX",30,2,,5.0,10/20/2014,My husband and I ate here the other day it was really good food and friendly staff we will definitely be going back!
Stephen G.,"Cedar Park, TX",51,2,,5.0,10/17/2015,Always great food and love the drink variety. Staff is very courteous. Been to this location at least 10 times and will continue to keep coming.
Mrs. M.,"Austin, TX",0,82,4,5.0,5/9/2015,"Everything about our experience today was 5-star.  We came here to celebrate Mother's Day with my mom and 3 girls and received nothing short of excellent service.  Upon arriving, we were seated immediately and our drink orders taken promptly.  I wish I knew the name of our server--he was very friendly and on top of his game the whole time.  When asked about substitutions, he was very accommodating, and not only did he not make it seem like a hassle to swap out sides, but he was more than happy to do it for us.  Both my mom and I had the Mediterranean pita tacos with tomato mozzarella salads, and everything was fresh, flavorful and filling.  The kids all enjoyed their meals as well.  Prices were really great for the food quality.  I love their premier rewards program and the free pizookie we got for Mother's Day.  Four of us could easily share it, and it was delicious!  Overall, I am very happy we chose to come here."
Mary S.,"Cedar Park, TX",182,53,5,2.0,2/28/2015,"Today my hubby and I visited for lunch and it was quite busy (typical for Saturday lunch) but there was a booth available and when we asked the lady taking us to the table if we could have the booth versus a tiny table for 2 sandwiched up against another table (with a 1/2 wall dividing us from the people next to us) and people in front of us and behind us like sardines.  She said no, I think she (hostess) is planning to give it to the party that came in behind you.  Did I hear that right?  We came in ten minutes before those people and they get the booth with plenty of room?  It didn't sit well with either of us and we almost walked out... but we proceeded to order.  The service was mediocre and it took three people to get us the following:  (waitress) 1 beer, 1 water (server) our order of chili fries and shrimp tacos (manager) our check.  The food was pretty average, so I would maybe give it three stars.  I did like the fact that the chips that came out with my tacos were actually warmed up and not served cold but to be honest, my own shrimp tacos actually murder theirs and I was really disappointed when I asked for guacamole and was told they don't have any??? Seriously, you are doing business in Texas, you need to act like it."
Alicia B.,"Cedar Park, TX",0,29,,2.0,11/19/2014,Extremely slow service ob both visits. Went in for lunch. We all ordered soup and salad it took almost 2 hours for our lunch! The food was good if you have all day to sit and wait otherwise go somewhere else.
Lacey W.,"Austin, TX",0,25,,5.0,5/26/2015,"The past few times I've gone here their food has been amazing! (The pizza is delicious). The service was awesome too, even on a busy Friday night!"
