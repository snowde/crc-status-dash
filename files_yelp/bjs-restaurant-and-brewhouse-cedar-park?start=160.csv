Roy G.,"Cedar Park, TX",0,9,8,1.0,10/31/2014,"I'll keep this simple. The service sucks. I would give them - stars if I could. The store at Arbor Walk is much better. I tried this location 3 times. Always poor service. Adios, I tried."
Andy M.,"Leander, TX",229,3,,2.0,2/13/2015,"Walked in tonight and had the New York Steak. The waiter was very good, very on top of things and very enthusiastic. So far so good! Got my side salad, very good! I then receive my main course, the steak with fries. The steak however, was absolutely AWFUL. The meat had tons of ligaments/ veins which made it almost impossible to cut and let alone chew. On top of this, it was severely undercooked and to top it all off, the meat tasted like it wasn't seasoned at all! It the surface was charred as well. It was like eating squishy, bland  charcoal. My friend who was accompanying me also had the same problem. Just awful steaks. We let the manager know and he was very professional about it and got the situation handled. I'm not sure if they're usually like this, but I think they need to invest in some higher quality meat cuts. The fries that came with the steak were delicious, of course it's hard to screw that up. Overall, I may come back, I may not. Still undecided."
Shea H.,"Round Rock, TX",2,5,,1.0,1/15/2015,"Horrible! Horrible! Horrible! We had our managers meeting here last night. We were seated very quickly, however, that was the only good experience about this place. We ordered our drinks and 2 apps. We all received our drinks fairly quickly, minus one beer that we waited 15 mins for and got told about 3 times that it was on it's way out. We ordered our food, took over 45 to get, all while the other tables around us were receiving and eating their food and had been seated after us. We all got our food, minus one taco that was supposed to be shrimp and they brought out fish, Very plain...In the meantime, our waters are empty and have been for about 20 mins and nobody stopped to ask if we needed any. Missing taco comes out about 10 mins later and it's the SAME fish taco they brought out before. Ridiculous. They finally bring out the shrimp taco when we are done with our food and it's raw!! Awful...we complain to our waitress, who is as ditzy as they come and doesn't know why the wrong taco keeps coming out (while we overhear another waitress tell her she input it wrong (TWICE). ) We ask for complimentary dessert for the awful service and she tells us the manager will comp 2 desserts because of our experience. We wait another 20 mins and get 1 of the 2 desserts that was to be comped. Again, she doesn't know why the other dessert wasn't put in or brought out. At this point we don't even want to wait for the other one so we ask for our bill that includes BOTH desserts on it and have them credited. Couldn't get out of here fast enough!! Seriously hope they work on the service, food and management of this place. LOVE the RR location and will stick to that one!"
Bill S.,"Austin, TX",0,3,,1.0,10/29/2014,"The service is terrible.  The meal consumed two hours of our time that we can never get back.  This was for plain old simple hamburgers.  Our experience was agonizing.  I won't belabor you with all the gory details and maybe time and experience will improve the service.  The hamburgers were ok, but just average, and certainly not worth suffering the miserable service.  Probably the worst service I have ever experienced and to add insult to injury, the checks were all wrong and had extensive errors.  All for four hamburgers."
Holly L.,"Round Rock, TX",28,14,,2.0,11/15/2014,"Have visited this location twice now.  First time was right after they opened.  I went with my two children.  We ordered two kids meals and a house salad.  1 hour and 20 minutes later we left.  I chalked up the terribly slow service to them being relatively new and still needing to work out the kinks.  Gave them a second chance tonight.  Arrived at 4:45 and asked to a table for 7.  They said it would take just a couple minutes to set up a table.  The restaurant wasn't even busy yet.  30 minutes later we were seated.  Given my last experience here, I explained to the waiter we needed to be done by 6:30.  One hour later, we were finally served our food minus one meal.  They completely forgot one of the dinners.  We ended up leaving shortly after 6:30 without finishing our meals.  If you're in the mood for BJs, go to the Round Rock or Arbor Walk locations. Service at both locations is miles ahead of the Cedar Park location. There are plenty of other choices in the area unless you're in the mood for a 2 hour dinner at a chain restaurant."
Larry S.,"Dallas, TX",0,3,,3.0,11/11/2014,Food is great. The only way to get through lunch in an hour is to order your drink and food at the same time and then ask for the check as soon as your food is brought to the table. This is a failing of every BJ's we've been to. The kitchen must be around the block somewhere that takes a long time to get to and back again.
Dawn H.,"Cedar Park, TX",0,9,,4.0,11/9/2014,After reading the reviews we were  leery to try it. We went for lunch and were surprised on how fast the service was and the food was very good. Our waiter was James and he was awesome . He gave us good information about the beers. We will go back for sure.
Rob C.,"Georgetown, TX",0,7,,1.0,3/26/2015,"New location opened less than 6 months ago. Good atmosphere and food (salad is supreme), and this was our first time visiting not only this location but BJ's overall. My son was in town from Colorado and we went out for a late dinner. Unfortunately he left his sunglasses on the table. When we realized the error, the store was closed. Returned the next morning and was told the sunglasses were not turned in. This was an $80 pair of Oakley's that were taken- presumably by staff. Unlikely to be another customer since (1) staff cleans the table during and after the meal, and (2) more than likely there were no more customers arriving when we left since it was nearing close of business. Honesty is a virtue. Loyalty is earned and when trust is broken, it doesn't matter how good a business product is; you only have one chance to prove your business virtue. Unfortunately, employees may not have the same values, but there is a responsibility element involved. Unfortunately, I will not be patronizing BJ's Whitestone Cedar Park, nor any other location including Colorado, as a result of this experience."
Richard E.,"Cedar Park, TX",0,184,,2.0,9/7/2015,"Very disappointed with the blonde waitress in the bar area.  My wife and I went last week, dropped about $80 on beers and my wife had the shrimp w/ pasta dinner.  Get to that in a minute.   The blonde serving us, I think her name was Jessie - she spent more time hanging out with her table of friends than serving drinks to the customers in her area.   The kicker is is that another gal, who was more on top of her game, had to take up the slack and picked up half her tables.  Again, the little blonde was to busy acting cool and hip than servicing her tables.   I tipped the other gal who took over as she did the job.  As far as dinner?   You talk about water in the bottom of the pasta / shrimp dish?  You knew it was frozen from the onset and should have been drained.  The positive, the Dunkel is good beer.  Probably the best on tap.  For what we paid and the lack of service -not sure if we go back.  My wife did like the atmosphere though."
Jason B.,"Austin, TX",1,3,3,4.0,12/5/2014,"Ate dinner here tonight. Though it was busy, we took a quick seat at a table in the bar area. No wait at all. Was greeted by our server quickly. She was friendly though odd. She liked to linger at our table and over exaggerate everything. But, she was very attentive and responsive. We ordered a deep dish pizza although it's not really deep dish. Just really thick crust. A true deep dish has the toppings baked inside of the pizza so that was a bit misleading. The food was delicious none the less. At our waitress's recommendation, we had the new Pepperoni pizza dip. It was delicious. My girlfriend and I both had one drink. I had a strawberry sangria, which wasn't very tasty, and my girlfriend had the frozen strawberry margarita. Her drink tasted much better and had lots of tequila in it. My sangria appeared to be watered down. We shared a large pazookie which was delicious. All in all it was a pleasant experience. The bill came out to 56 dollars, which we expected."
Ray W.,"Austin, TX",0,1,,4.0,11/14/2014,"My wife and I came here tonight and had a great dinner. Yes it was pretty crowded, but that's to be expected on a Friday night. I ordered the gluten free pizza and my wife had a salad. The salad was a little on the small side yet she loved it. We shared the pizza and we both thought it was great especially for gluten free. Micaela was our waiter and she did a fantastic job! We definitely recommend this BJ'S here in Cedar Park."
Steven H.,"Austin, TX",0,12,2,3.0,1/26/2015,"Ok, so I'm not the guy that normally writes a review. I feel I need to, to help people not get ripped off. I know that prices are set based on demographics. That's understood. But as consumers,  we like to get what we pay for. I visited Bjs last night. Service was great, food was great, food prices ok, alcohol prices, holy crap. Thought I was at Ruth Cris. I ordered a shot of Gran Mariner. $8.50 for a 1 OUNCE SHOT! really? $6.25 for a pint of Fat tire? I'm not a yuppie,  but you don't serve cordials in a false shot glass, maybe a snifter,  or high ball you think? I currently work in the service industry,  and I know what the whole sale price is on that bottle, as well as keg price for Tire. Bjs, you need to re-think your prices. It's a little ridiculous. I know all businesses are in business to make money, I won't be back, at least not for drinks. Sad, my wife and I really like this place."
