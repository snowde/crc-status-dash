George K.,"Pflugerville, TX",44,7,,2.0,2/24/2017,First time going to a BJ's establishment. Cedar Park TX.  Friday night at 7:45 pm.  Ordered a beer $6.25 for a 12oz. Shiner.  Really?  I ordered a medium pepperoni pizza for $20.50.  I struggled to find any cheese on top.  I asked for jalapenos on top also and they put about 10 pieces; about 1 jalapeno for each piece.  Crust was good.  I had good service by our waitress.  I will most likely not go back.  They are way to overpriced for the quality of food. I give it two stars.  One for service and the other for cleanliness.  #badfirstimpression
Shannon B.,"Leander, TX",16,18,4,4.0,6/2/2017,"This is a fun place to get a drink in the Leander/Cedar Park area. My husband and I popped in one Sunday afternoon and had watermelon mojitos, calamari, and stuffed mushrooms. The mushrooms seemed overpriced, but everything else was good. The waiter was nice, and the drinks were great. The atmosphere was better than I expected."
Rachel B.,"Austin, TX",611,473,960,3.0,12/7/2015,"I really enjoy BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse.  I had actually never been to one until I met my hubby a few years back and boy was I missing out!  I'm glad he showed me the light! The menu for BJ's is quite extensive and has something for everyone in your group.  Their pizzas are fabulous and come in so many different varieties or you can design your own.  My fave would be the White Pizza.  Anything with Alfredo sauce and I am in love.  My husband disagrees and always goes for the Classic Combo pizza.  It is good too, but not as pretty as the White Pizza.  Looks aren't everything, I know, but it is true in this case! They also have a ton of other things from burgers, sandwiches, steaks, brunch (on the weekends), lunch specials Monday-Friday, and even low cal choices.  I don't know anything about those because I am a full fat kinda girl, which is probably why I'm not a size 2.  They even have  french fry options!  Now that is just awesome because sometimes you want skinny fries and sometimes you want wedge ones.  GENIUS! And of course, they have a ton of beer!  They make about a dozen different beers and even switch it up throughout the year in the different seasons.  For you non-boozers, they also make their own root beer, cream soda, orange cream soda, and black cherry cream soda.  I always go for the cream soda and I am always happy. The service is usually ok, but it does waver, which is why I gave this location 3 stars.  Food alone is easily 4+ stars, but the service knocks it down.  Sometimes you go in and your server is on it, but sometimes, like my last visit, was a diaster.  Our food took 40 minutes to come out.  Some of it was hot, some lukewarm, and one had been under a heat lamp for way too long.  We were all so hungry (Warning, do not mess with my family when we are hungry because you WILL get hurt!), we didn't send it back because we were afraid it would take another 40 minutes and we had plans afterwards.  We were not the only ones with this problem either, as I heard the tables around us all complaining about the same things we were talking about.   I would say 90% of the time you will have a great experience, so definitely try it out.  And get some cream soda too!"
Alexandria P.,"Houston, TX",21,7,,2.0,1/31/2017,"We sat down and no one greeted us... we watched as people who sat down at the exact same time as us got drinks and appetizers, meanwhile our waiter had not even greeted us to let us know he was running behind. Finally our waiter came and gave us a head nod and ""I'll be right with you"" with no apology for having been MIA... we felt like no one had even noticed that we had sat down. Not to mention we had two children with us, one under 2 yrs. and anyone with kids knows time is of the essence with restaurant service... we left because our waiter showed no remorse and we were not sure the service would get any better through out the meal... disappointing"
Ashley H.,"Austin, TX",18,66,9,3.0,7/31/2016,"Some of the apps are rally good. Some of the main meals are just ""Ehhh"". Service we've had here is either hit or miss. We did have an amazing waitress here, I forgot her name. She recently moved to the area and was so just nice and attentive. Another time we ate here i think we saw the waiter twice. I had to get someone else to give us our check.  They have a large menu so it's hard to think that most of the food that they have is fresh and not frozen. They do however have a great beer selection, large bar, with multiple TVs. It's worth a try for some apps and beer if you're in the area to catch a game."
Cindy A.,"San Antonio, TX",40,13,11,4.0,3/18/2017,"BJ's is one of my favorite restaurants. I love their Jeremiah Red beer and the food is always good. I'm not a fan of the pizookie, so I can't say much about that. The service is always on point and you don't feel rushed to get up and leave even during rush hour."
Beth W.,"Round Rock, TX",92,29,11,5.0,9/9/2016,Pookie provided by far the best service I have ever received.  I took my daughter and four of her friends to dinner...they are 10 and 11 year old and of course are giggly!  Pookie was so sweet to them and the girls had a blast!  They all said they can't wait for their parents to bring them back so they can ask for her as their waitress!
Nancy P.,"Cedar Park, TX",110,400,631,3.0,10/28/2014,"Three times I attempted to go here for dinner, only to find the parking lot so packed. Finally gave them a shot for a Saturday lunch. Geez, parking still crowd but found a space. It is definitely a sports bar atmosphere, large screen TV's mounted on the wall. I was seated in a small booth between the Bar and dining areas. My server takes my drink order of raspberry iced tea. I peruse the menu to find something light. The watermelon Feta salad catches my eye, so does the corn fritters with bacon aioli.  Server comes back with my drink, and I check the booth for a sweetener. Nope, none to be found so I sip the tea. It is pre-sweetened already. I place my order and wait. The TV's are playing a local football game, now I know why the parking is crowded. The corn fritter arrives first. Five golf ball sized fritters laid on the bacon aioli sprinkled with corn and bacon. I cut one in half and dip in the aioli and taste.  Such disappointment, the fritters were mostly batter with a few kennels of corn, so not a fritter. The bacon aioli was spicy and no hint of bacon flavor. They weren't bad but not what was expected from the description. The watermelon and Feta salad was a different story. So cool and refreshing, will order this again. The server was competent and friendly. Too friendly, by the end of my lunch I knew a lot of their personal life. Yes, I know they do this so we feel a connection and give a bigger tip. Not with me. Feeling indulgent, I asked what they have for dessert. The server only told me about the Pizookies. So I order the chocolate chip pizookies. It is basically a 4 inch round hot cookie in a mini pizza pan with a scoop of ice cream on top. Was it good, YES. Was it worth $6.50, Hell No. One thing I noticed, lots were ordering their pizza. So I will come back for a pizza and beer."
Jeremy W.,"Leander, TX",5,21,2,2.0,7/24/2016,"I'm not sure where to start with this.  I have tried this location of BJs Brewhouse 3 times and it has gotten progressively worse every time.  Today was the proverbial ""last straw"". We will not be going back. I have always thought this place is overpriced for both the quantity and quality of food.   We had some friends in from out of town and decided to go here because it was close and several in they party could not decide on exactly what they wanted.  It was busy, as one would expect on a Sunday at lunch, but we were seated fairly quickly and the place seemed adequately staffed for the volume.   Our waiter got to us quickly, took our drink orders, and got our drinks out pretty quickly.  He then came back and got our food orders.  Everything went fairly smooth up to this point.   As I looked around the restaurant after ordering, it became apparent that things were in a state of chaos.  There was a woman who I assume was the manager constantly moving back and forth handling problems at different tables, bringing food from the kitchen, etc.  There seemed to be no rhyme or reason as to how orders were coming out of the kitchen.  On two separate occasions, servers delivered food to our table that was not ours.  Refills were very hard to come by.  Our glasses sat empty for long periods of time.  I did not keep track of how long it took to get our food after we ordered, but it had to be close to an hour. When the food did start to come, it was delivered one or two plates at a time (there were eight of us) by several different servers. One of the orders came out wrong.  It was sent back and corrected.  One of the plates was cold, so we sent it back.  The manager did comp that meal for us, so that is one of the only good marks I can give.  The food was mediocre, but not worth the money.  Refills continued to be extremely slow.  We finally got the check and paid.  It took an extremely long time for the waiter to bring back the change.  Grand total from the time we walked in until the time we left.......2 hours.  About 1 hour too long.   Postscript: My son did not want his burger after filling up on fries, so we boxed it up and brought it home.  We got it out this evening to warm it up for him and noticed that it was overdone to the extreme.  The buns were black on the inside and the meat patty was hard, black, and dry.  My son opted to let the dogs have the burger, so we cut it in half to start feeding it to the dogs and noticed there was some sort of blue/green material ground up in the meat.  I have no idea what it was, but decided it was not even fit for the dogs. Too bad we were not able to get the burger comped too.  So, in summary, a disastrous experience that we will not take a chance on repeating.  Not sure why I am giving 2 stars.  I guess the friendly staff and the fact that the manager looked like she was trying to make the best of a bad situation gets them 2 stars."
MelandMike R.,"Austin, TX",11,14,1,5.0,7/4/2016,"Our waitress Alysha (I think her last initial was W) was AMAZING. The best waitress we've had yet! She made our dining experience absolutely wonderful. She gave us excellent feedback about the dishes when we had questions and our food was incredible. I asked her to keep watch on my drink and bring out the next selection when my glass was 1/4 full, which she did right on queue. She made the dining experience exemplary. We really hope we get lucky enough to get seated in her section for our next visit!!!  Thank you again Alysha!!!  And thank you BJ's for another excellent meal!"
Elyse L.,"Euless, TX",599,677,1990,4.0,9/30/2014,"I'm so glad we have a BJ's near us now instead of having to drive all the way to Round Rock. They were giving reward members double points until the end of September so today was our last day to take them up on the offer. It was squeaky clean inside, you can tell from seeing virtually zero smudges on their menus, and most of the servers were still in training. Ours was great and very knowledgeable. She had our food out quickly sans error and gave us just the right amount of space while still being close the second we needed something. My husband tried the bacon cheeseburger he rated as ""good"" along with the blonde brew which is both of our favorites. I got my normal Thai chicken salad, and we split the bacon corn fritters as an appetizer. I don't always order dessert, but when I do it's because it has pumpkin in it! There is a seasonal pumpkin pzookie right now which I have to say wasn't the best pzookie I've had, but it wasn't bad. Its a big pumpkin skillet cookie studded with cream cheese chips and topped with vanilla bean ice cream. When you first bite in it almost tastes like gingerbread from the spices, but then the pumpkin hits. Its in the same shopping center as Costco which will make it a great weekend lunch destination when we have to shop there. Overall I'm excited to see Cedar Park expanding to include my favorite spots. Even Chipotle! Be still my chain restaurant loving heart"
Tim C.,"Williamson County, TX",855,1036,10976,5.0,9/3/2015,We ate lunch at this location today. We both ordered the lunch soup/salad combo. Wifey got broccoli cheese soup in a sourdough bread bowl. Her salad was just cut up tomatoes w/small mozzarella balls. She loved it. Said her soup & salad were excellent. I ordered chili in a regular bowl w/house salad. My chili was not warm & the salad had a small problem. They immediately and cheerfully corrected both of these issues. I then enjoyed my chili and salad. The manager even stopped by to make sure all okay. The price of my meal was deducted from the bill. We will definately eat here again and recommend that you check them out soon.
Daniel G.,"Cedar Park, TX",32,24,44,4.0,9/5/2016,The ambiance of the restaurant is awesome and looks great. Downloaded the BJ app and it registers you by your phone number so after 5 attempts to Make an account using my phone number and it not recognizing me cause someone already had the phone and they use this nationally so some else Upstate may have the phone number so you can't make an account Unfortunately I was so aggravated about not being able to sign up I started having some what  of a bad experience.  The saving grace is I had a great waiter who was very knowledge about everything on the large menu and could explain everything in detail  ROB BUCKALLEW WAS GREAT WAITER !!!!! Just like the reviews I read it's kinda a hit and miss on the experience I guess LUCKY THE WAITER SAVED THE SERVICE !!!  Food was Ok
Craig R.,"Cedar Park, TX",0,2,,2.0,3/18/2017,"A restaurant with the word ""brewery"" in it should be an awesome place to enjoy good food and great drinks. As a local, I've tried this place several times hoping it would live up to the ""brewery"" name. It doesn't, not even close. It has a good sized bar, and their home brew is okay, but the food is just piss poor. I've tried burgers, salads, pizzas, you would think they could do something right, but they can't.  My last meal was blackened shrimp that came out lightly peppered, cold and under cooked. After it was sent back it came back with more of the same. Their home-brew porter was too light and sweet for me, but it was okay.  My dinner date had a salad and water they were happy with, but didn't order the wine they got last time because the price they charge per glass is obscene.  We also kept trying this place because they have a good selection of healthy meals. But when they keep coming out so bad, there's really no point.  There are just too many good, and even mediocre places to eat in the area, making this a place you should definitely not waste time with. I've given it all chances I can, I'm done with it."
Arnulfo S.,"Cedar Park, TX",8,5,5,5.0,1/7/2017,"Cold beer, hot chicks, good food, awesome atmosphere, games on TV, more cold beer. Man! I'm coming back tomorrow."
Eric S.,"Cedar Park, TX",6,58,,2.0,6/11/2016,"Compared to other BJ's in the area, this one just can't seem to get it right. First, it's a smaller footprint than some other locations, so there are some things on the menu available elsewhere you can't get here.   Why?  Who knows. Got here in the evening, not busy,  but despite having made reservations via the BJs app (which said ten minutes from when we made them, we got there ten minutes later) we had to wait 15 minutes to be seated.    Server was pleasant but man was the service slow.   Took nearly half an hour to get our food, and when it finally came, my steak (ordered medium) was cooked to shoe leather.  Sent it back.   More than a half hour after that. they finally got a properly cooked steak to me.   It was so bad the server came by at one point and asked me if they wanted them to box up the steak so I could take it home, since my wife had long since finished her food. We've come to the beer dinner's BJ's is known for and they manage to screw that up too.   The only reason for a two-star review rather than one is that the beer is good and the servers, totally at the mercy of the worthless cook, did as much as they could to make up for the delay. The BJs in Round Rock and Arbor Walk consistently do a better job than this one, so if you have a craving for BJs, go there instead.   We will."
Jeff S.,"Leander, TX",3,42,3,4.0,1/7/2017,"Been here 2x for sit down dinner, and once for thier curb side pick up. All three times excellent ood, service. This restaurant has become a staple for my family as a casual eat out spot."
Eve B.,"Fort Hood, TX",184,376,101,4.0,10/26/2015,"On a rainy day was a good place for lunch.. Ordered the ahi poke and it was fresh and tasted good. Also got a burger and then food took a little time to cook and it was not too busy. Food was good.  Now for the service., took us a while to get the check. I guess there was a problem with the system as we were told but others paid their bill and left while I waited for ours.  Waitress was friendly and nice. Place was clean and inviting. .."
Sara R.,"Austin, TX",143,81,1499,5.0,3/20/2016,"My go to place to eat when I'm not sure what I want, they have everything and it's all good. My favorite is the Santa Fe salad, it's huge & it fills me up! The draft beer here is the best, I love their nutty brunette beer. We are all sure to find something amazing to eat here for the whole family."
Eric M.,"Austin, TX",0,4,,5.0,1/14/2017,"The selection is amazing! Great parings, and flavors abound. Whether you want a burger, pizza , pasta, salad, or soup you'll find what you're looking for. From Appetizer to entree, to dessert the presentation, and flavor is great. I always leave full and very satisfied."
