Eldano R.,"Leander, TX",0,4,,3.0,7/25/2017,"The Hostess had the personality of tube of toothpaste, not the first look I would want at my restaurant, but from there it got better. Waiter was better and the food was good, so after a bad start we had a good finish. We were there 7-23-17"
T K.,"Cedar Park, TX",0,59,28,3.0,6/28/2016,"I would give this place a solid 3-stars.  It's a trendy sports bar atmosphere with more whisky bottles behind the bar than the local liquor store.  Definitely a bar before a restaurant.  The food is good; nothing special, but no complaints either.  It's a little pricey for what you get so you're paying for the chain-store-sports-bar atmosphere; lots of 60' flat screens around the wall..  I had the fish and chips (a pub standard) and the batter on the fish was heavy and rather oily.  They served a ""special hand made"" tartar sauce that didn't taste like tarter sauce at all.  That was a let down for me as I really like tartar sauce with my fish.  If they want to offer something different along with tarter sauce, that's fine.  But calling that stuff they had tarter sauce was a letdown.    The noise level was uncomfortable for me, and I'm kind of hard of hearing so I imagine it's really loud for most people.  There are about 16 Bose speakers (you know: No highs, no lows, it must be Bose) in the ceiling that are turned up louder than necessary, so everyone has to speak very loudly to their dinner partner & that just added to the noisy atmosphere.  All it lacked was the thick cloud of cigarette smoke hanging in the air of days gone by."
Suman E.,"Cedar Park, TX",0,2,5,1.0,6/23/2017,"I have been to BJ's couple of times now. Typically we order same dishes every time we go there. As always i ordered the same three dishes to go but this time food tasted awful. Something is wrong with this restaurant, what a waste of money. Never going back here."
Courtney H.,"Cedar Park, TX",138,9,3,1.0,2/19/2016,"Disappointed.  I recently moved to Cedar Park and was happy to see a BJs Brewhouse nearby. The New Braunfels location has been a favorite of mine for years. However, my first visit to the CP location was a huge let-down.  We were seated quickly but waited 10 minutes for someone to greet our table and take a drink order.  The drinks were delivered another 10 minutes later. My glass of wine was covered in finger prints and hot pink lipstick; neither of which were mine. When the waiter returned, I asked for another glass. He commented that it was indeed gross and he'd be right back. Cool.  He brought an empty glass, placed it in front of me and left the table without a word. Now, if the glass is dirty, so is the wine inside. Pouring dirty wine into another glass does not make it clean.  When he finally returned notepad in hand, the kitchen was out of everything we requested. Alright... We settled on some other choices for an appetizer and dinner.  I still hadn't even taken a sip of my wine and the two glasses remained in the table as he had left them. After I mentioned it again, the waiter proceeded to pick up the small carafe of wine that accompanied the first glass and poured it into the empty glass. What?!?! That's your solution?!?! What about the rest of the pour still residing in the nasty glass? Our food was delivered and it was again 10 minutes or so until we saw our waiter. What if we needed something? Water refills? Silverware? (I walked to the hostess stand myself to get us some silverware.) I have to point out that my boyfriend and I both worked our way through college by waiting tables. After college, I worked as a corporate trainer for a national restaurant chain similar to BJs. We get it. My problem: countless servers and the manager passed us by several times throughout our visit; none offering assistance or checking on is. It was Saturday evening but not busy by normal standards. There were several open tables all over the restaurant. The waiter was full of excuses and lack-luster solutions. I don't want free wine; just clean wine. In my experience, dirty plates and/or glasses warrant an immediate replacement while removing the offensive dish or drink. Servers and managers help one another and take care of the patrons together if need be in order to provide a good experience. This was clearly not the practice at the CP BJs when we visited.  We paid our bill (wine included) and still tipped the waiter. I hope he was new; there may still be hope for him to learn. I doubt we will visit BJs again with far better service and products offered elsewhere."
Pamela B.,"Georgetown, TX",0,2,,1.0,10/6/2017,"The man who was the daytime manager today, October 6, 2017, needs to find another line of work. It took 25 minutes for our party of five to be seated, even though the restaurant was half empty. They claimed that there was no server available in the area where all the tables were open, yet I see the manager standing around, drinking a smoothie, talking to several servers and hostesses (who were also using their cell phones). He was not expediting or helping with anything, not directing his employees to seat people more quickly during lunch, just chatting away and standing around like a lazy lump. It's so sad for me to see the way these millennials have no work ethic, and to have a manager (who was probably around 45 years old) just stand around with them, setting a terrible example, is infuriating. I will never eat here again, and I truly expect this restaurant to be closed within the next year, because this is the third not-so-great experience I've had at the same location, and they're obviously not changing anything. If you value your time and want good service, don't eat here."
Stephen H.,"Cedar Park, TX",23,3,,5.0,3/23/2016,Rainey is the greatest waitress ever!!! Overtime I go she knows I love to try new things. I lover her recommendations and have never been let down by them. We ask for her overtime we go. Thank you so much Rainey for everything you do!!!
Vikki S.,"Lincoln City, OR",1,49,3,4.0,3/25/2016,"Typically, I don't eat at a chain restaurant, especially in a town like Austin with so many amazing and unique spots to try, but we had just gotten into town, were starving, and knew we'd have a wide variety to choose from on the menu.  The selections and the meal did not disappoint.   Our server was Rain (or Rainey?) and she was great - quick, courteous, and very attentive throughout the meal without being obsequious.  We started with the fried brussel sprouts which were delicious.  After that, all I wanted was a cup of tomato soup, which was very good and tasted very fresh.  My husband had a California chicken club and loved it. When you're looking for a great and diverse menu selection, good service, and quality food at a reasonable price, this place fits the bill nicely."
Name L.,"San Antonio, TX",10,27,21,2.0,9/2/2016,some days its fantastic!!  other days the food i order has to be sent back. i still go for the beer and the chicken club sandwich.
Amanda A.,"Llano, TX",60,240,160,2.0,11/2/2014,"****Warning**** This location isn't the same menu as the one in Round Rock, Mopac or near Bucees San Marcos.  So my family was really disappointed that they didn't offer the sampler platter.  We asked the waiter and where told since they are smaller, it's a smaller menu.   We brought the in laws and they were really put off by the menu prices for lunch on a Sunday.  $10.95 burgers I believe, maybe it was $9.95. I settled for fish & chips.  They were stingy with the chips (fries).  Good but pricey and not a huge portion. They forgot my son's side of fruit and had to be reminded a few times to bring it.   The service was super slow overall and we sat with empty glasses.  I realize they are new- but surely they understand the importance of a good first impression?  My in laws will never go back more then likely. I'll only go to the ones with the sampler platter.  They do have great appetizers but I don't want to commit to just one.   This is one of the few times I give a low review.   And I will say, the waiter caught on to our discontent, apologized & kept a positive attitude."
Amy D.,"Austin, TX",829,1051,4364,4.0,9/29/2014,"Most of us have our guilty pleasure big chains and this one happens to be one of mine. While I would love to eat sushi everyday or enjoy dinners with multiple fancy meticulously plated cuisine there are some days I just want to keep it simple. BJ's fits that bill.  There is wine for me and lots of beer options for Jesse. They brew their own beers and they also serve a nice selection of taps from other breweries. The best day stop in for wine is Tuesdays when bottles and wines by the glass are 1/2 off. They don't have a huge selection of high end wines but you can get drinkable glasses starting at $5 during happy hour. At the other locations I have been to I usually get my carb fix with either the mini veggie deep dish or flat bread pizza discounted during happy hour. Tonight we dined at this newly opened Cedar Park location and were happy to find lots of parking behind the restaurant. We were promptly greeted and taken care of well at the bar by Kelly and Michael. I had a glass of wine and tried their kale salad with roasted Brussels sprouts. I was impressed how flavorful this salad is! The large green salad was tossed in a strawberry vinaigrette and had fresh blueberries, dried cranberries, a little bit of goat cheese, red grapes, candied pecans and toasted pepitas. The salad is off the ""EnLIGHTENed"" menu, is 410 calories and you have the option to add a protein.  This will be a great place to watch sports games or to happy hour in this area of Cedar Park. Happy hour is Monday-Friday 3pm-7pm and Sunday-Thursday"
Brad F.,"Austin, TX",69,131,62,3.0,5/13/2016,"Awesome service and food! Family time in a casual environment.  Deserts are a real game changer.  SO GOOD! The problem was this particular one was not in any way that awesome service that we get from all the other.  We actually had to ask the waitress to take our empty plates and when she looked at us sideways my wife asked ""do you mind"". She responded with no I don't mind....  Still the food was delicious as usual."
Sandi D.,"Leander, TX",0,4,5,5.0,4/16/2017,Love Love this place.  Servers are always pleasant.  Rarely get a bad meal but the couple times in 2+ years of going there - they always made it right.  The menu is HUGE and the food is great.  Our once a week eat our place for sure.
Henry G.,"Austin, TX",29,2,1,2.0,3/14/2016,Not a good experience. I usually like the grilled Brussels sprouts but not today. They were burnt and inedible. Don't get me wrong I like them with a little char but these were so burnt they left a bad aftertaste. The manager actually made it right but really someone should have noticed before they got to my table.  The reason I couldn't let it slip was the waitress went out of her way to say they only charged me for one order of Brussel sprouts! What! They should have comped them both instead of implying it was a matter of my taste that was the problem. You judge for yourself.
Kimberly B.,"Austin, TX",39,10,,1.0,11/7/2015,"Today we gave the Cedar Park location a second chance.  On our first visit a month or so ago, I had to ask for at least 6 different sets of silverware because they were dirty. I was told that there was a problem with their water softener or something so it was just hard water making the silverware look dirty.  When I pointed out the food stuck to the fork the hostess wasn't even phased. The service was slow and the food was just disappointing.   Today's visit started with the hostess being a bit snarky, the server being clueless, and the food being just terrible.  I mean seriously, for the prices this place charges management really needs to get their act together!! To start with, I ordered a sweet tea to drink. When the server returned with my drink I was notified that they were out of sweet tea, so he brought me a glass of unsweetened tea that was so weak you could barely tell it was tea.  I guess nobody in the building knew how to make sweet tea because in the hour or so we were there none was ever made, and when I got a refill, it was the same disgusting watered down weak unsweetened tea.  I always get the balsamic chicken breast that comes with assorted green leaf lettuce, mashed potatoes, fried onion straws and carmelized onions.   When I ordered my food, I asked for no carmelized onions on my meal, but stated the fried onion straws were ok; the waiter just wrote down ""no onions"", so it wasn't a big surprise when my food came out sans fried onion straws.  What was a surprise was the fact that the green leaf lettuce on my plate was replaced with a crappy romaine mix that was nothing but a bunch of wilted romaine and spines that I hate.  The chicken breasts tasted like frozen, pressed chicken that had been microwaved, slapped on the grill and drowned in balsamic glaze to cover it up. I've been to both the Round Rock and North Austin locations and the service was incredible, the food consistently good, and the experience overall pleasant.  This Cedar Park location has some serious work to do.  The staff just seem like they couldn't really care less.  I will not waste my time or money going back to this location. I wish negative stars were an option!!!"
Carol M.,"Austin, TX",0,44,,3.0,8/31/2016,"The Joke is on US!!!  There is NO sauce on any of their pizzas !!!  We've tried them all...the managers have made a 2nd when we complained that we asked for EXTRA SAUCE while ordering......and even then there is no sauce.   This past weekend we had family in, ALL of us wanted good deep dish pizza, so we vowed to each try a different one......love having lots of left overs for snacking later.   Great service, good beers, salads were good, and pizza was great....except we each scraped away the cheese, whether barbecue, or any other feature...on our ordered pizza......the only tomato we saw were chopped pieces on top of the mushrooms, etc.   To be honest, when we called the waitstaff/managers over.....we refused seconds, showed them our pizzas, reminded them of the previous free 2nds they made for us.....and then asked, ""What do we have to do to get tomato sauce on our deep dish pizza??"" They all looked as surprised as we have been.......each and every time. We'll be back, but we now know......forget the sauce."
Amanda M.,"Leander, TX",54,35,6,2.0,11/9/2015,"We've been to this location several times, and we've noticed quite a few things with consistency. This is a restaurant you must go into with a sense of humor, a willingness to have a sort of adventure, and a lot of time. Service is friendly and accommodating, but slow. I must reiterate - this is not the restaurant to try when you are in a hurry. We have never been in the restaurant when they have had everything we ordered in stock. We have always had a problem with our order. Whether it was getting the sides wrong (even when NOT ordering substitutions, twice - on two different menu items-  I did not get the side the dish was listed as coming with), ordering the jambalaya and then discovering that someone forgot (?) to add the shrimp, or last night: the waiter forgot to put in half of our table's dessert order, and then it had to be made twice, because it came incorrect the first time. Back to being friendly - they are very quick to attempt a solution to whatever the problem with our meal is. We like the atmosphere of the place. We just can't ever go there with picky eaters, or people who are impatient, or groups. Basically, my husband and I enjoy it if it's just ourselves, but we can't go if we expect to take more than a party of two, and attempting it with our kids again is right out."
Laura A.,"Pasadena, TX",255,540,14,4.0,9/26/2015,"Pretty good.  Vast menu, hard to decide.  Beer is ok.  I got the thin crust pizza, it was pretty good.  Hubs really enjoyed his burger."
Paula B.,"Leander, TX",27,7,,5.0,8/6/2016,"BJ's Brewhouse is a go to spot for my family. We are there once or twice a week. Our servers Pukie and Catalina have us spoiled with their outstanding service. On our most recent visit we met MS Jess, part of the management team. She was delightful and so sincere. Our food was a little slow coming out. Jess, was on it without a complaint from us. She had it covered and we knew she had it handheld. Thank you Jess your what BJ'S is about."
Kennan T.,"Austin, TX",0,18,3,3.0,7/2/2016,"I'm updating my review because the manager did reach out and we have it another shot. Well, it was better, but not great. My gf's fries had little /black/burnt pieces of something all over them and gave them a burnt flavor. Looked like burnt seasoning or something. I ordered the sirloin, and for $16 sirloin that was pretty weak. Maybe 6oz. The Brussels sprouts were gross and looked like they had been cooked for WAYYY to long. Zero color and completely mushy. My baked pot came out with nothing on it. I asked if it was supposed to be completely plain(who eats a plain baked pot?) and she said no, came back with the butter, sc, and cheese. But by that point it wasn't hot enough to melt the cheese or butter. But didn't taste bad. We felt very rushed. Like our server was about to be cut and wanted to go home. She dropped off our check before our dessert even hit the table..and it was the wrong dessert when it did hit the table. No biggie, we got the right one pretty quick after. But once we finished our entrées, our drinks were never refilled. I even asked for more water at one point and she never came back. So we ate our dessert, and washed it down with ice. Just felt rushed. Wasn't the worst service but it was pretty bad. She was still serving tables around us, just not us anymore. We will be back, but probably just sit at the bar and have dessert and a beer."
Elaina R.,"Cedar Park, TX",4,20,20,4.0,8/13/2016,"Yesterday my family and I came here for dinner. We had a coupon for a free appetizer and we decided on mozzarella sticks. They were absolutely delicious and served with a pizza type of sauce with shredded cheese on top. It was very good.  For the meals, I had the pulled pork sandwich. The BBQ sauce was very tasty, but I did encounter a small piece of bone in one of my bites. The sandwich was served with a ""coleslaw,"" but it was dry and wilted. Kinda gross, but I had enough food as it was.  My mom had the road beef dip that she enjoyed. I have personally had it before and the beef has a very good flavor. The meal is simple and not too heavy. It is served with au jus which is great for dipping the sandwich or even the fries. My sister ordered the boneless wings appetizer in the bbq flavor with a side of fries. She liked them.  My dad ordered a ribeye steak that was average. BJ's isn't a steakhouse, so it was about what you'd expect, but not bad.  I think all of us could agree that their French fries are absolutely delicious. They are shoestrings, but very crispy and crunchy. They have good flavor. One of my favorites around here. On this occasion the waitress was friendly and did get everything we asked for, but she would disappear for a while at a time. This was kind of annoying when we would be looking to flag her down for something, but she did do a pretty good job. Our drinks were kept refilled and such, so there want much to complain about there. In past experiences, about 2 weeks ago from this past visit, we were brought to the bar for seating. I am a minor, as well as my sister and my parents highly dislike when we are brought toward the bar. It isn't appropriate for children. But overall, the experiences I have had here have been pretty good. I recommend coming here. They have really stepped up their game since they first opened the location."
