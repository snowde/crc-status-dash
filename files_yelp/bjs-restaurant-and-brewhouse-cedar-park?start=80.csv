Melissa C.,"Austin, TX",100,51,37,4.0,10/13/2014,"As everyone else mentioned, it's still early and there are kinks to work out. The key here is to visit the restaurant with the expectation that you will wait a little longer. Maybe this isn't the best time to bring your screaming, starving kids. Oh, did I say that out loud? Drinks: We enjoyed several of BJ's beers: Hopstorm IPA, Nutty Brewnette, Field Day IPA - all get the thumbs up. I'd recommend skipping the Jeremiah Red and Pumpkin Ale. Both were underwhelming.  Food: We played it safe since it was opening week and went with a couple apps [Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms, Watermelon + Feta Salad], the Crispy Jalapeno Burger, and Thai Chicken Mango Salad. The latter was actually pretty boring and I wished I had gone with a burger instead. So much for trying to keep the dinner calories low to save room for a Pizookie. Ah, the infamous Pizookie. Since we figured we'd be back again to try one of the menu staples, we went with one of the current specials: Salted Caramel. Hello, heaven. I slipped into a sweet, sweet dessert coma after that. It was a little smaller than expected and my boyfriend seemed upset that we were sharing versus him having his own. Poor thing. I generally shy away from chain restaurants, but it's nice to have another option in the Cedar Park / Leander-area that isn't a drive-thru fast food restaurant. We'll be back!"
Tim V.,"Cedar Park, TX",19,257,133,4.0,11/16/2014,"So this place is getting better.  The first time in was a hot mess! Food took forever, was under cooked and wasn't very good.  The manger made things right so we gave it a second chance just a few days ago. Service was ok, but food was great on time and correct.   Hope they keep improving so I keep enjoying they great beer"
Dawn A.,"Cedar Park, TX",74,21,,3.0,7/7/2016,"The food was decent and the drinks weren't bad. But $10.50 for a simple glass of long island was not even worth it. I had two, and of course they don't list prices and I feel tacky asking. $65 for two people for a burger and two drinks each.. Not at this place. Not worth it. Next time I'll skip the drinks."
Steven P.,"Cedar Park, TX",96,20,4,5.0,1/6/2016,"I've been to BJ's a few times now and have had a great experience every time! The food is always delicious, especially their burgers, the atmosphere is always comfortable and relaxing, even when it's busy, and the service is always outstanding. I went to BJ's for my birthday today and my waitress, Jessica, made it especially enjoyable. I will say that this is not a place to go when you're in a hurry. I believe they intentionally give you plenty of time to spend time with friends and enjoy your meal. It's something I genuinely appreciate because I hate feeling like I'm being rushed out of a restaurant. However, if you're the type of person that likes to get in and out fast, you may not appreciate that aspect of the BJ's experience as much. On the other hand, if you enjoy a having a great time with a great meal and great friends this is the place for you."
Anks D.,"Austin, TX",0,22,1,1.0,7/8/2016,Please tell your customers that there are additional charges for substitutuons.... the server subsititued all toppings but never informed that it willl be charged. The pizzas were bland and simply slow and atrocious service. Head to domain or round rock BJs. Or avoid BJs if you want to just have pizzas.
John F.,"Leander, TX",16,8,13,2.0,6/2/2015,"I've went to 4 different BJ's in CA & TX w/in first month of each opening.  Bad idea.   Consistently poor experiences with long waits, food not coming out the way ordered, WAY too much time in between waiter/waitress visits (app/entree/dessert orders, drink refills, extra napkins, straws, whatever... ""service"") & an overall sense of ""chicken with head cut off"" going on.  In addition to that, just too crowded and chaotic to enjoy the experience (Whether on a date night or w/our kids). Against my judgement, we went to the Cedar Park BJ's about 3-weeks after opening (too long of wait times on prior attempts) and I'd hoped that things would have settled down enough and the newness worn off for a decent experience.  One word: Disappointed (for all the common reasons given from previous first-visit experiences above).  Consistent, but not in a good way. So, I have not been back here since.  I will try them out again this summer after they (hopefully) have their act together better. My family loves those Pazookies!"
Rosanne W.,"Cedar Park, TX",14,11,,1.0,5/30/2015,"I really tried the like this place.  I have been to the one by the Domain and that one is a bit better.  The first time at the Cedar Park location I went with my son.  It was busy but not slammed.  We ordered an tomato/mozzarella/basil app.  It was good.  We ordered sodas and if you believe they didn't have straws.  What eating facility runs out of straws?  I am handicapped and the glasses are a little to heavy for me so I asked if I could have a plastic kids cup for my drink.  She gave me a weird look even after explaining my situation.  Should have known it would go all down hill from there.  By the way never got the plastic cup. Ordered dinner.  My son ordered fish and chips and I ordered a hamburger.  I asked them to please make sure to have them to cook it to medium and plain/condiments on the side.  My son received his dinner followed by mine 5 minutes later.  Of course the burger came out almost burnt with it loaded with things.  I called her back when I found her about another 5 minutes later and told her I couldn't eat my dinner the way I received it.  She then asked me ""so does that mean you want me to have them redo the order.  I asked her to please do that.  Meanwhile my son is felling terrible and doesn't want to eat without me.  I told him to eat his while it was warm.   Ten to fifteen minutes later the food came out to me.  If you can believe it my fries were stone cold.  By then I have had enough.  I asked for the manager.  He came over and asked me what was wrong.  I explained all the things that went wrong and he said that he will go get me some fresh fries.  This is about 25-30 minutes after my son has received his meal. By then my son was finished with his meal.  They never asked if we would like a refill (remember I asked for a plastic cup). Well a couple of minutes later someone brought out the fries.  By that time you would think the manager/owner would bring them out himself and ask if he could do anything for us.   Nope - just dropped full pay check on table and ran in the back. My advice people.  Don't waste your time or money on this place.  Cedar Park now has a few more options so don't waste them here. If you do good luck.   I will fill you in on what happened the next time when I have a few more minutes. Yes I tried to give them a second chance."
Vera G.,"Leander, TX",2,5,,2.0,3/18/2015,"I have been there two times, the first time service and food were terrible. This second time service was much better but food was terrible again. We ordered pizza and I could not believe how bad it was, the sauce tasted bitter!  Totally not going back."
K R.,"Austin, TX",7,41,,2.0,2/6/2016,Great service and manager (that's why there are any stars at all here)! Absolutely mediocre food.
John M.,"Austin, TX",25,16,1,1.0,10/16/2016,"If there were an option for no stars, that's what this place would get. We've been to other locations and really enjoyed ourselves. If it weren't for our waiter (bless him, the poor guy,) there would have been nearly nothing positive about our experience. The manager who seated us offered a children's menu for our 19 month old, and then never brought one. We needed to order something on the fly for her so she wouldn't get upset, but no dice, thanks to him. The restaurant was mostly empty, but our food took forever to get out. I  ordered the late night burger, which was mostly ok, besides it clearly being cooked medium well, as opposed to the medium rare temp I ordered. Also, the bacon was undercooked. My wife's meal was the biggest disappointment. She ordered the barbacoa chicken (which, seriously? Barbacoa is beef cheek, but whatever...) Half of her rice was overcooked and mushy, and the other half was crunchy. It also had some kind of super salty cheese like feta on it, which tasted really unpleasant with the rest of the dish. The same manager came over and asked, ""Everything's great, right?"" Umm, no. We told him what was wrong and he seemed to not care. He first asked my wife if she'd ever actually had barbacoa before, and then he offered us something else, because, ""We actually do have good food in our kitchen, you know."" He then claimed he was going to talk to the kitchen about the rice, disappeared, and never came back. Our waiter told us it had been comped, which was appreciated. With multiple other locations in the area, there's really no reason to go back here. The table right next to us also got their food wrong, and from the reviews on here, this is a regular problem. How hard is it to put out a product consistently??"
Alexis V.,"Austin, TX",41,30,8,4.0,3/7/2016,"Been here with my husband several times for dinner and the large menu doesn't disappoint. If you've never been to BJ's, it's one step up from a Chili's. It's a good American food place for a weeknight dinner when you don't want to cook and are looking for something around $9-$15/plate."
Krystal J.,"El Paso, TX",1,11,12,1.0,3/27/2016,"We will NEVER return to this location. Came into town to visit family, we decided to go have a few drinks at the bar. After we paid and we were all leaving the restaurant one of the bartenders Jeremy, came outside behind us and gave us back out 10$ tip that we left, and said ""We don't need your 10$"".  Jeremy the (bald bartender that doesn't know how to smile)  all we did was have drinks at the bar. I feel like 10$ was more then enough to tip for the less than mediocre service that we received. I plan on calling corporate and the store manager. Not only were we humiliated by this, but my family is outrage and said they also will never return to this restaurant."
Rey S.,"Cedar Park, TX",0,5,,5.0,6/3/2016,Just had a FANTASTIC experience!!! We really enjoy coming to this location in Cedar Park  Lots of great people here and our wait person Rob was AWESOME!!! Ask for him for great service and fun!! He's really cool!! Thanks!!  Great service!!!
Anilina C.,"Cedar Park, TX",8,4,,2.0,5/30/2016,"Stay away from here. The service will ruin your day. The food came first than the appetizers and beer. A bigger group, that arrived 20 minutes later than us, received their order quicker. The waitress forgot to place our order, and forgot the pen with the check. || BJ's, I appreciate your response. I am OK; I did not write the review hoping for a discount or a gift card."
Megan M.,"Leander, TX",78,14,1,2.0,3/21/2015,Service sucks and the prices are a bit high. The drinks are expensive and so are the appetizers. Food is either hit or miss.
Jillian M.,"Cedar Park, TX",0,2,,1.0,4/28/2016,"Will not return to this location. Food is good, but service experiences have been terrible. Our last visit was the final straw. Went for a family dinner, at a decent time, they were not overly crowded or understaffed. We all placed our orders. My husband ordered a simple hamburger entree, no special requests. While most of our entrees came out in a timely manner, he didn't receive his until almost an hour and a half after we initially ordered, and most of us were already finished with our meals. He waited as he was very hungry and we kept being told by the server it would come out ""soon"" more than once.  The server assured us the kitchen had received his order when all of ours were submitted. After my husband finally got his meal, our server offered to have the manager come to our table to see if they could ""do something"". The manager came to the table, but offered no explanations, absolutely refused to take any action to rectify or make the situation right, and just seemed to shrug it off instead of offering any real apology.  My husband worked for many years in restaurants when he was younger. He knows how customer service SHOULD be in a restaurant. The other adult family members with us were appalled. We've all had experiences in restaurants where something wasn't right, and none of us could recount a time where a server or management didn't offer some way to compensate, such as taking something off the bill, a free beverage or desert, a voucher for a free appetizer in the future. This visit became the that first time. While the particular server we had that night was sincerely trying to help, overall, the service there isn't worth it to any of us to return."
Sarah T.,"Leander, TX",38,175,,3.0,5/18/2015,The food was just okay and a little overpriced. The service was SLOWWWWW even though we were suprisingly immediately seated. Likely will not make it into regular rotation for dinner our family dinner spots.
Bryan B.,"Round Rock, TX",7,8,,1.0,12/1/2014,"This weekend we gave the new BJ's a try. This location is close to home but I seriously doubt we will be going back.  The service is extremely slow and the food is substandard compared to the other 3 locations I have visited.  The short, don't waist your time or your money here. Go to the round rock location instead. The long... The appetizer we ordered never showed up. When or food finally showed up it was cold and improperly cooked. Half of the food showed up 5 minutes after the first 2 meals arrived. My steak was over done and the veggies I don't think they were cooked. It was like I ordered a veggie tray from the grocery store.  My son's fries were ice cold. I know this because I was eating them waiting on my food.  I thought it may have been just us but I noticed the table next to us still hadn't gotten there food when we were leaving. They were seated about the same time we were. All in all it was nearly 2 hours for a shitty meal. Now I just need to figure out how to rate this place a minus 3 stars."
Paige P.,"Austin, TX",1,10,,5.0,12/17/2015,Love this place! The manager even walked by to see how we were doing. I'm surprised to see some bad reviews because they were really great here! Great food as always and great staff. We had Murphy as our waiter and he was great!!! He was super nice and attentive! If you go here choose him for your waiter
Shonel G.,"Austin, TX",192,236,2529,2.0,11/18/2014,"Tucked in the middle of Cedar Park Texas you will find BJ's. This is a great location yet the parking leaves much to be desired. This place in a new building attractively decorated and the seating is comfortable. We were warmly greeted and quickly seated.  While looking at the menu we notice they have many options. Almost to many options, so it took us a while to decide what to get. We settled on calamari for the appetizer, one mountain and a hot tea to drink. The calamari was beautifully played and look way better then it tasted. The problem was that the dish seemed to not be seasoned. I took a drink of my hot tea and quickly picked up on a Tim flavor that I could not get out of my mouth. It was so bad I sent my hot tea back and ordered a soft drink. After a small wait our main dishes arrived. Both meals looked great so we could not wait to try them. Yet again we were disappointed. My dish the parmesan crusted chicken with veggies seemed very under seasoned. My teenaged daughter told me she found her shrimp tacos to be way to salty. We were so warn out by our long day that we just dealt with the meal and quickly left.  The service here is a little hit or miss. They wait staff didn't seem to realize I might need a spoon for my tea and later had a hard time keeping our glasses refilled. To say the least we were very underwhelmed. The food here is bland. Maybe I tried the wrong thing so I will try to visit again and order something more main stream like pizza or a hamburger......,,"
