Alonzo V.,"Tempe, AZ",0,20,1,4.0,7/11/2014,"First time here after looking at it for years. Was a great experience, will def be back"
Kimo K.,"Phoenix, AZ",22,241,45,4.0,4/22/2015,"I have been here two times now.  The first time was over a year ago when my GF took me there for lunch.  We enjoyed it but I do not remember what we ate.  Today, we went for lunch again since BJ's sent my GF a birthday coupon for one free meal.  So we went and she had two chicken tacos in pita bread with chips and salsa.  The chicken tacos, especially in pita bread was super delicious or so she said.  The chips were fast food quality but the avocado dip and the salsa were very good.  I ordered their double brewmaster deluxe burger -- that is two 5 oz. patties with two slices of cheese, bacon, onions, tomato slices, and lettuce -- it comes with a boatload of fries.  It was very good.  A side note --- the have a half pound bacon cheese burger that has essentially the same ingredients but with only one slice of cheese and an 8 oz. patty.  Why would anyone order that for the same price as my double brewmaster deluxe burger???  We ordered two soft drinks too.  They gave her a birthday cookie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream for her birthday.  We were stuffed and the food was good.  I was impressed, especially with the birthday coupon."
Michael T.,"Phoenix, AZ",6,51,,5.0,8/6/2015,"My wife and I ate there last weekend.  We were seated immediately.  The food variety is quite large and everything we ordered was really good.  They make about 9 different beers and the one I ordered was quite good.  Service was prompt and attentive despite the restaurant being quite full.  I would definitely go back and recommend this restaurant to other people.  The one down side is that they do not offer any coffee other than just plain old brewed - no lattes, etc.  They should raise their game on this score.  Prices are reasonable.  Lots of families eating there, but no rowdy children."
Lara E.,"Chandler, AZ",40,29,67,5.0,11/3/2011,"We had the best service ever!!!!!!!!  We sat on the patio and our waitress was Taylor.  She was so attentive, we got our food right away and of course it was delicious!! One thing that was very odd was that we wanted to speak to her manager to tell her what great service we had, then the manager came out and acted like we were wasting her time.  It was the strangiest thing?????  Just not sure if she wasen't interested in what we were saying, or she had other things that she was doing. So I would give Taylor 5 STARS, and the manger 1 STAR!!!!"
Crystal Z.,"Tempe, AZ",284,72,8,4.0,9/19/2011,"Since I am so anti dives and pubs, this place is a good middle ground for me and my guy friends. It's a great place for happy hour - I love the nice ambiance and cleanliness, they love the huge beer list. And since it's right at Chandler Mall, I love that we can grab a drink, and I can hit up the sales. Perfect!"
Dana N.,"Mesa, AZ",240,15,1,4.0,6/30/2011,"After hearing so much about BJ's, my brother and I went last night along with our pastor friend who lives just down the street.  We got the fried artichoke as an app, which was very good.  I had a baked potato with chicken and broccoli which was smothered in cheese and my brother had a chili cheese burger (those skinny fries are sooo good!).  Our friend had one of their BJ's deep dish pizza and I had a slice.  Not too greasy and with just the right about of crunch from the dough.  Then we topped it off with the red velvet pazooki, which was amazing!  But it's hard to go wrong with a pazooki.   The guys tried out a couple beers which they all thought were decent, but non of us are any sort of beer experts.   Overall the food was great and atmosphere was comfortable, but just a little loud.  Not the kinda place you want to go for peace and quiet, but not overbearing either.  Our server came to check up on us frequently and she was very polite.   Will come again!"
Venchenzo M.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,3,3,1.0,7/4/2014,Very sad service.. took 45mins too receive water and no help too order food. The waitress excuse was that she was the only working tables. No team help 3 guys was just talking with no care too help out.. the menu is like a book with very sticky pages way over price and I would never go back..
Kiersten M.,"Fort Rucker, AL",32,5,3,4.0,12/29/2013,"After being gone for two years, I was extremely excited about coming back to this restaurant and extremely disappointed to find the most hateful hostess waiting to seat me. There was not a welcoming smile or even look when she asked number of party. She then explained how to find our table and told us to go sit and she would bring the menus along. First impression of one of my favorite past times was horrible, however, the server was amazing and the food was delicious. Must try the honey-crisp  chicken salad!"
Stephen H.,"Somerville, MA",82,88,,4.0,8/14/2012,"Was taken here by client. Chips and salsa were a decent standard appetizer. Hopstorm IPA was a pretty solid IPA, not overly hoppy. Had the grilled pork chops, very well cooked, decent portion size, sides (salad, green beans, mashed tatos) were relatively uninteresting but no real negatives. The individual pizzas looked really good, prices seemed very fair. Good choice for solid food + beer."
David H.,"Queen Creek, AZ",0,74,,4.0,5/14/2014,"Really good brewhouse and quality food. It is a wide spread chain but they have it down well. They have above average beers (Tatonka Stout) and their seasonal are usually awesome (especial the Belgian based ones). All the food seems to be really good, sides, pizzas, deserts (pazookie)"
Courtney C.,"Saint Clair Shores, MI",263,39,3,4.0,6/25/2013,"I usually order from the small plate menu but decided to go with a shrimp pasta dish the last time I was there. Unfortunately it wasn't great, or good, only blah. Too little shrimp and way too much pasta. The flavor was bland, so bland that I had to constantly pepper each bite. I'm going to stick with what I enjoy best, the small plates."
Josh K.,"Scottsdale, AZ",273,106,4,3.0,1/4/2012,"BJs is hit and miss...I've had good food there, and I've had mediocre food there. I've never had a ""great"" meal, but that's not really what you're paying for or should expect.  Everything is pretty ordinary, salads and appetizers are alright, entrees are alright. Service and environment is good typically, and they have some really good beers and good specialty items. Their draft root beer is amazing, and I would end every meal with a BJs pazookie if doing so meant I wouldn't drop dead from heart failure at 35. I like their burgers pretty well, but they took their classic burger off the menu, which was a bummer. It was really good, so that's too bad.  It's a good place to watch a game or to grab a bite if you're in Chandler, but it's never going to wow you. I'm sure I'll be back soon enough, because it's a solid, reliable place to get a pretty good meal."
Bill V.,"Phoenix, AZ",246,121,218,3.0,5/20/2013,"I had to go for a work function. I feel obligated to write something since it's a restaurant and this is Yelp, and I ate food. As I get older, I get less tolerant of chain food. BJ's is so prototypical, that I couldn't stay for very long. The service was agitating at best... food was sub-par. I truly hope I dont have to go back anytime soon. I gave 3 stars because some people like chain food, and this was only below average, not horrible."
Kay G.,"Goodyear, AZ",19,39,,4.0,12/9/2010,"Good quality food & nice staff, our server SAM, rocks! She was attentive, kind, and full of knowledge about the food and refreshments.  Try the Oktoberfest beer! Then make sure to have dessert--they can make the desserts in a smaller portion size. Mall parking, nice location and comfy and cozy atmosphere."
David D.,"Chandler, AZ",52,178,123,3.0,10/23/2013,The atmosphere here is pretty nice for a weekend dinner. The massive TVs always have a good game on to watch. The food is pretty good but not amazing. The pasta was decent. The pizza is there area they shine.
Julie Y.,"Chandler, AZ",9,25,1,2.0,8/18/2013,"We had a mixed experience here today.  I'll start with the positive:  The appetizer platter we got was very good and the kids LOVED the mozzarella sticks.  The adults enjoyed the avocado spring rolls, the other kind of spring rolls (not sure what they were called), and the artichoke dip with chips. The beers we selected were also good.  I loved mine, but once again I can't remember the name (it was the one our waitress said was the closest to a blue moon beer).  Lastly their thin and crispy fries were wonderful!   Ok, so now for the bad:  The men in our group ordered some kind of chicken tacos and the other ordered a personal size pizza...both were TINY portions.  I was not thrilled with the so called sourdough bread that my California chicken sandwich was on...the bread tasted a little burnt.  The worst thing about this meal was that the waitress announced that they were out of the chocolate chip pazookie dessert for the rest of the evening....WHAT?!  When you have little kids that look forward to this dessert, it is not a good thing when you are told that!  This was a late Saturday afternoon...how do you not have plenty of those desserts on hand for a SATURDAY NIGHT????  I still enjoyed the white chocolate and macadamian nut mini pazooki that I got and the kids liked the cookies and cream one they tried.  The pazookies at Oreganos are still better in my opinion.... Anyway, not sure if we will be going here again, but maybe we'll try the deep dish pizza next time."
Kevin C.,"Hereford, AZ",86,281,80,3.0,7/14/2011,"Brak likes BJ's. For a ""brew house"" kind of joint, the food is WAY above average.  Some of the servers have been here for years and are great.  Others are horrendous - we've had service ranging from outstanding to unacceptable here.  But the food has been consistently good.  Brak likes the chicken parm lunch special.  The marinara sauce has an extra spicy kick that's both unusual and very tasty.  Would have granted 4 stars if not for the spotty service.  But the food has been consistently good, and is a regular spot on our office lunch rotation."
Ceci G.,"Tempe, AZ",113,421,45,3.0,3/22/2011,"I've tried to go to this place many times, but the days and times where always  a mistake as it can get really crowded.  Spoiled for so long with 4 peaks, I had to give it a try no matter what. They have a long list of their own beers and that was the best. I had the Grand Cru seasonal and it was just fine.  Food is ok too, but they seem to fill your taste with the presentation of massive dishes. I had a BBQ sandwich that was ok but nothing I would order again. French fries are good, but sorry I'm far too adapted now to the ones at 4peaks.  Friday night or Saturday are the best days to go and frustrate yourself looking a spot to sit. Sunday for lunch worked much better."
Laryssa S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",41,20,3,4.0,9/19/2013,I was pleasantly suprised at how good my steak was! Love their beer too.. definitely a fan of their house hefe
Pete C.,"Mesa, AZ",1,4,,1.0,2/11/2015,Food and beer were good but the atmosphere sucked. I was there watching the NFC Championship game and we were cheering (not obnoxiously mind you) during the game and kept being asked to keep it down. Are you kidding me? Needless to say they were a bit full of themselves there. I won't be going back to that hoidy toidy place again. Went across the walkway to Buffalo Wild Wings and had a much better time there.
