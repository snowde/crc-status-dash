Courtney S.,"Miami, FL",1,1,,1.0,12/31/2015,I have been to BJs numerous times and had great experiences - but I will say if you have a special meal or a football game you really want to watch - DO NOT do so at BJs! I made a reservation with the only request being to watch a playoff football game - so they sat us outside with a table of 10 where there was only 1 TV and no game sound. The only sound was music. We were told the manager said that they couldn't turn the game sound on that night. I was so frustrated that they messed up our plans so badly!
Emily G.,"Tempe, AZ",534,431,591,2.0,12/2/2013,"It pains me to be here at HH when Kona is a few feet away offering the tastiest treats for next to nothing. Instead i'm at BJ's for a company HH, trying to make the best of it. The only great thing about their HH is the $4 you-call its. They're not you-call-it-wells, they're you-call-it-anything, so my smart-ass self ordered top shelf gin with ginger beer. Unfortunately, they didn't have my favorite (Hendricks) OR ginger beer, so I caved with Tanqueray on ginger-ale. Sad, but still a damn good deal for $4. We ordered the lettuce wraps and egg rolls at $6 each as a HH special price. Funny thing about HH pricing, you sorta expect it to be the same regular menu item at a discount price (which is why you're so ""happy"" to attend). Well, a little investigation lead me to realize that the appetizers on the HH menu are SMALLER than their regular-priced counterparts.  The lettuce wrap on HH comes with 3 individual leaves of lettuce with a miniature sample of the meaty sauce while the menu displays the lettuce wraps as 4-6 leaves surrounded  by multiple bowls of filling. How fishy. Then the egg rolls appeared. 4 tiny little nubs of fried dough with avocado that tastes like its drowning in mayo. Did I really just pay $6 for this? Is this really a ""deal"". I think i'll just have a liquid-gin dinner for HH and call it a day. No thank you."
Kendall B.,"Chandler, AZ",9,34,51,5.0,7/9/2015,AMAZING PAZOOKIES. The best is the original chocolate chunk. The small bites and snacks are great for a late night great. All the food is spectacular. My go to treat to celebrate birthdays or just to celebrate the love for chocolate chip cookies with ice cream!
Jonathan C.,"Chandler, AZ",29,92,273,4.0,1/2/2015,Love this place it's always fun times.  Make sure you come early or you can be waiting for a seat but it's well worth it.  The food is amazing can't wait till my bison burger gets here.  The pizza is fantastic and the pizzoki for dessert is the best. If your looking for a good craft beer tap list it's pretty well done.
Rich S.,"Chandler, AZ",0,11,,2.0,5/8/2016,"Went to Bj.s with my family for mother's day and it was a disaster, the fish and chips I got were burnt they bought me another but the fries were dry and the fish batter was thick and lousy not to mention the pieces were very small. They gave us free desert because of the fish problem and they gave gave me a pizookie with a burnt chocolate chip cookie. My wife had pizza and she said it was lousy and my son who loves pizza did not eat the piece she gave him. This used to be such a great place to eat but the last few times the quality has gone to crap and it seems everytime we go here it gets worse. I will not be going back for a very long time."
Aubrey L.,"Mesa, AZ",4,5,,5.0,12/21/2015,"We always have a great experience when we come to BJ'S but I'd like to applaud our server tonight, Mike C. He took phenomenal care of us, he was attentive and genuine. Highly recommended him, and BJ'S in general. Thanks for the awesome date night, and for telling us about the rewards card."
Rob M.,"Tempe, AZ",0,10,,5.0,5/1/2016,"AWESOME selection of beer!!!!.. Check it out....  In addition, I had the turkey burger with sweet potato fries and it was BOMB!!"
Gigi-kitty K.,"Chandler, AZ",0,1,,3.0,10/29/2016,"We LOVE this place BUT  we came in specifically for the pumpkin ale,and were told they'd run out the week before.  We've missed it two years in a row now because not enough was made.  Make more!!! We'll drink it!!"
Kimberly G.,"Seattle, WA",150,238,49,3.0,6/16/2013,"I have eaten at BJ's a few times when in the area and it has always just been okay. Last night was no different. The beer selection on tap is great and the cocktail menu is pretty good. Service last night was not the best. Our waiter forgot about us a few times throughout the night, and I watched another waiter tell him to check on us before he was once again going to go into the kitchen without checking on us. We ordered two side salads before our entrees and I must say they were a sad excuse for a salad. Iceberg lettuce, a few carrots and watery ranch. Yuck. I ate a little and decided to wait it out for my entrée. I ordered a mini bacon cheeseburger pizza and my fiancé had the jalapeno pepper jack burger. The first few bites of my pizza were pretty tasty, it had a combination of cheddar cheese, dill pickles, ground beef, bacon and a special sauce. I had eaten it before on a previous visit and really liked it. After the first few bites the pizza seemed very doughy and not cooked all the way through. I might have sent it back but service was quite slow and I did not feel like waiting another thirty minutes. My fiancé's jalapeno burger was okay. It was not bad but not great. The fries were very tasty. We did finish off our meal with a chocolate chip pizookie. That is the saving grace to the whole meal. Warm cookie with ice cream mmmmm.....  I might be back if it is a late night and I am coming out of a movie. I don't think that I would get to adventurous with the menu. I would stick to beer, apps and a pizookie."
Johnny N.,"Queen Creek, AZ",1,25,17,1.0,6/19/2016,Thought it would be a good fathers day to grab some food and a cold beer.  I'm familiar with bj's just not this location.  We say 1st the bar sheet I kept hearing this very loud thumping noise.. at first I thought it was just a quick kitchen anomaly and would stop.. no such luck it's the server for from they kitchen do you are stuck hearing this annoying thumping every 5-10 seconds.. not a relaxing atmosphere at all.  If I do bj's it will not be this location..
Coco K.,"Chandler, AZ",0,9,,1.0,9/9/2015,"The service I received on 4 Sept last Friday at this location (Chandler) was unimpressive. I was even more disappointed in their management.  My wife and I made a reservation the morning (11:00 AM) of 4 Sept (Friday) for 16+ people for dinner later that night at 7:00 PM.  The host (male) confirmed the reservation (via phone) but when my family along with our friends arrived there later that night, they told us to take a pager and would seat us as soon as possible.  When I inquired as to what had happened, the hostess simply stated that somehow our reservation had gotten deleted in the system and when it was put back into the system, the morning shift entered it incorrectly (6:00 PM).  The server then stated that the current wait was 50 minutes.  I asked to speak to a manager to resolve the issue (as I had 16 individuals w/ their families waiting) and when the manager spoke to us he was less than empathetic in what had happened.  His demeanor was less than encouraging, no apology was given, and he stated he was working the issue but we would have to wait.  There was no sense of urgency to remedy the situation from management and I got the perception that there was very little interest in correcting the error.  Looking around the restaurant, I could easily see that there were vacant tables on the patio (which the manager could have easily offered) regardless if the service would be slow. But no offer was made.  Instead, he stated that we would have to wait the current wait time (50 minutes).   Having a wife who has been in the hospitality management industry for 10+ years, there could have been multiple ways of recovering the situation: Offered patio seating, or at least somewhere to sit, offered some seating at the bar, maybe a few complimentary appetizers to calm the hungry children, or even some waters at least while waiting in the Arizona heat, vouchers or anything to come back another time... at the VERY least, a sincere apology (especially with a party as large as 16+ individuals).  My true disappointment was not that a mistake had happened, but rather how the situation was poorly handled.  We can understand there can sometimes be a miscommunication during a shift change, but poor management and recovery should not be accepted. After talking to the less than empathetic manager, my family and party left BJs and went to the Keg where they were glad to have our business. Sadly, that's $700 in sales BJ's lost out on and also grat that their servers missed out on and more importantly, a loss in some loyal patrons. The great thing about all this is- we have found a new meeting place as our regular dinner location, thanks to the Keg. We will look forward to returning there for our regular dinner outings and will look back and laugh at myself and think what a fortunate mistake this was.  I would suggest a bit more training for the staff, not just for the hostess stand employees, but for leadership/management more importantly. Staff is only as good as their leader.

Heather H.,"Murrieta, CA",14,22,,2.0,8/30/2015,"Honestly, I've been here many times and this was one of the worst experiences I've had here. It took the server a good five minutes to acknowledge me and then another five minutes just to bring me my iced tea. During the course of my meal, my glass was empty several times and she had to walk right by my table to get to the kitchen, so I'm not sure why she couldn't refill my glass on one of her many trips or while she was just standing around. Also, she never stopped to check on how my meal was or if the food was alright. Then when I went to pay, I gave her my rewards card and she didn't even bother to give me the points from today's visit. Also, the manager was too busy watching the baseball game on TV to pay any attention to his servers or guests. I'm just very disappointed with this visit."
Diana G.,"Chandler, AZ",29,10,3,5.0,3/11/2016,Every time I have been here I have received great service and the food is always amazing no matter what I order! This is definitely my go to spot for a great meal at a decent price!
Lauren T.,"Tucson, AZ",160,274,24,4.0,7/21/2013,"Finally tried BJ's. It is one of those menus like The Cheesecake Factory. Not as bad though, but slightly long and overwhelming.  Best part was that I was finally let in on the secret of the Pizookie! YUM!!! I went with the traditional chocolate chip and was not in the least bit disappointed! I could eat those all day.... This location: busy, but service was good especially for how busy they were.  Food I tried: Avocado Egg Rolls--my favorite! So yummy! Mac and Cheese--my least favorite. Dry and tasteless. Roasted Vegetable and Goat Cheese Flatbread--I love anything with goat cheese! Great White Pizza--not bad, not good, did the trick. Pizookie-SEE ABOVE AMAZINGNESSSSSSS"
Jack K.,"Chandler, AZ",0,2,,1.0,3/22/2016,"They have nice drafts, decent food, really horrible service.  On our last visit the check was on the table while I still had the plate half full and a full glass of beer.  I thought it was a restaurant not a fast food joint. There is a continuous pressure on selling more even while you're still eating, yet never enough time to bring water or even refill glasses. I don't remember a time I was able to relax and enjoy a meal here. On several occasions our server made us feel like we should have been grateful she was serving us.  Most of them have some sort of off-putting attitude as if they'd rather not be there serving guests. Used to come frequently, even had the app but can't be bothered any more.  Restrooms can get really gross looks like no one cares. Luckily the area has no shortage of better places that make sure customers have time to enjoy their meals and drinks."
David L.,"Lynnwood, WA",25,119,3,4.0,11/19/2014,"First, it's a really nice bar.  The bartenders and staff are just great!  If you love beer, get the sampler and try them out, but the red ale is the best in my opinion!. Having very fond memories of the amazing tuna poke at Lulu's in Lahaina on Maui, BJ's was in for some steep competition.  They succeeded in a wonderful take on the dish.  The avocado egg rolls made my belly happy as well, and were NOT at all greasy. Very very good. Lots of TVs to watch various sporting events.  Lots of fun!"
Vanessa G.,"Scottsdale, AZ",92,184,205,4.0,10/3/2014,"This place is a chain. The atmosphere is well constructed, even though it is a bar it can feel very intimate. You are separated into small clusters through out and it doesnt seem as big as the venue is. As for service, they got our order wrong and forgot to put in the appetizers.. before we even had a chance to get upset, the waiter said it would be compted, apologized several times. The manager came by, apologized several times.. wow. I felt really appreciated and the service was great. They do really value their customers! As for food: - I got the Scallops - OH MY GOODNNEESS. So good, these are perfection, and in their EnLIGHTened menu. So one of the healthier choices and very filling. - Like always my eyes are too big for my stomach so I also got the chili. This was alright, nothing out of this world.. and it has a lot of sour cream, so if you hate it as much as i do you will spend several minutes just scooping all of it out.  -Appetizer: Stuffed Mushrooms. So good! And fancy.. so great! -My bf got the Hamburger - Now... this is where it all went south. The hamburger was underwhelming, not juicy, not spiced, not anything. It just was a hamburger. Not memorable at all. Solid 4 stars. And dont get a hamburger!"
Mike H.,"Chandler, AZ",0,63,10,5.0,2/14/2016,Dropped in for early dinner. We had the Asian chicken  and a santafe salad. Both were very good. Each a full meal. Service was good. Wasn't too noisy. Enjoyed the experience. Really appreciated the waitress offering us each an ice tea to go. Even joined their rewards club while there.
Puja C.,"Queen Creek, AZ",111,28,15,4.0,7/17/2014,"Main Points: -Variety of beer and food -Good portions on dinner menu -Great for groups Review: If you're looking to grab some food outside of the mall's food court, consider stopping into BJ's. They've got a very extensive menu with various types of cuisines, so it's sure to suit everyone in your group or the individual who just can't decide on one food type that sounds good.  I've tried several things on the menu in the past, and I've thoroughly enjoyed their signature gynormous potatoes, tasty beer, and melt-in-your-mouth pizzookies.  If you're looking for something with a little bit of spice, try their jambalaya - not sure how it fares with authentic cajun cooking, but it hits the spot. I may have to give the lunch menu another try, but I was a bit disappointed with the things I tried today: Chicken quesadilla- hardly any cheese and not enough food for a lunch, Margherita Flatbread - too small and sauce tasted like the diy luncheable pizzas from elementary school, Turkey bacon ham sandwich - just your regular sandwich nothing special, and their Pale Ale chili - no spice and not a very good overall flavor. Despite my lunch experience, I'm giving them a 4 because my past meals have been consistently good. I like the variety of food and beer, good service, my fav dishes,and the convenience of the location, and their ability to accommodate groups."
Jenna N.,"San Antonio, TX",7,200,14,4.0,12/15/2014,Food was great. We had the avocado egg rolls and pizza! So delicious. Service is a bit slow but it's a huge place. Felt bad for our server because he was running around all over the place. Although you could tell he was exhausted he was always very friendly.
