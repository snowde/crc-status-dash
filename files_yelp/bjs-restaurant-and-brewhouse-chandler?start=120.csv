Anthony F.,"Mesa, AZ",0,6,1,5.0,3/18/2016,This is one of my favorite restaurants. Great atmosphere and food. The parmesana crusted chicken is the best! I like that i can see all the sports games.
Alexandria D.,"Chandler, AZ",64,99,38,5.0,1/7/2016,"OH MY GOSH I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE! We came here for the first time a couple of weeks ago & have been back like two or three times already! The first time we were there we had great service & the second time we had a very strange composing older lady as our server & that made it kind of awkward for us at times. Definitely recommend pretty much everything there! I love there pazookie original cookie dessert! You also can't go wrong with their burgers, salads, ribs, or appetizers! & THERE PORK IS TO DIE FOR! I can't wait to bring my coupon and go back! Also don't forget to sign up for there rewards system, it's awesome!!! Yay!"
Brooke E.,"Gilbert, AZ",21,71,17,5.0,1/2/2016,"I have always loved the pizza here. McGregor hears about my less than satisfactory experience at another location, and took it upon himself to take care of us completely. I was overwhelmed with gratitude to his willingness to make our experience over the top awesome! Thanks McGregor!"
John B.,"Provo, UT",69,100,44,4.0,12/27/2014,"I got the clam chowder, which was good. Others in our trio got the Cajun pasta dish and a cheeseburger, which they apparently enjoyed. We had to sit outside because the restaurant was so packed, but BJs has nice heaters, so it really wasn't a problem.  Our server (Jeff) gave us lots of attention and was quite friendly and courteous. BJs was very accommodating."
Tina M.,"Phoenix, AZ",124,291,111,5.0,4/17/2013,"This is not your usual sports bar fare.  The Thai Chicken salad is amazing! Juicy chicken, fresh avocado & a delicious dressing on fresh greens. I'm embarrassed to say I ate every bite! You can get the usual items on a sports bar menu but the difference is they take the care to make sure everything is top quality.  I haven't had anything here that wasn't fresh and well prepared. The servers are friendly and attentive.  I don't give 5 stars easily but this establishment takes the time and puts in the effort to deserve it."
Chris K.,"Nottingham, MD",10,96,15,5.0,12/20/2015,Decided to grab a late night dinner. Their steak was surprisingly good and fair priced unlike another steakhouse I visited in Downtown Chandler. Food was spot on. Service was even better. And it's so close to everything I loved it.
Morgan E.,"Scottsdale, AZ",69,155,23,4.0,6/30/2013,"Holy crap, the mac n cheese. My friend Syd had the Club which she gave me a bite of and it was amazing. We each had a different kind of beer, I had the blonde which I hadn't tried before. Delicious. Also- I love the atmosphere, it's open space and seating makes it so you aren't IN someone else's conversation.  We sat in the bar area at a table before we saw a movie, and the only negative was how long everything took. They were really packed and only had one server on, so it wasn't surprising but we were really hungry."
Paige C.,"Chandler, AZ",0,4,1,5.0,8/7/2016,"I love this restaurant! Love the food and desserts! I have had great and fast service every time I've been here, from group events to family dinners. It can be a little bit pricey though. But still a great place to go."
Danielle P.,"Stamford, CT",170,302,120,3.0,6/2/2013,"I really like going to BJs when I am in town visiting my family. They have a HUGE menu so everyone can get exactly what they want. But much like the Cheesecake Factory, everything on the menu is not great. In my opinion, the pizzas and pasta dishes leave much to be desired. The sandwiches, soups, burgers, salads, and appetizers are very yummy. My favorite is the clam chowder in a bread bowl. So. Good. This appears to be a great place for groups.The staff is very accommodating, and attentive, and the restaurant is very big. Friday and Saturday nights are generally packed with people, understandably so with the good food, relaxed atmosphere, and the beer/drink menu. If possible, I would call ahead or be prepared for wait a bit. As I mentioned before, this place has an extensive beer and alcohol menu. My dad and uncle love this place for the beers, and I love this place for the cocktails. I have not been for happy hour, but I hear it is great.  Definitely A-OK place for lunch/dinner in Chandler. I think as far as places go in the area, this is top notch."
Alex D.,"The Islands, Gilbert, AZ",133,181,123,4.0,6/25/2014,"Good Beer, Good food; not much more I can ask for.   Have yet to have a bad experience here. I'm a rewards member so it pays off since I visit often.  Can't review much on wait staff as I always sit at the bar top and have great service.  Would recommend."
Liane G.,"Tempe, AZ",72,10,9,5.0,3/14/2014,"Let me start of by saying that BJs is absolutely fantastic.  The roast beef au jous dip is orgasmic. It is literally an explosion of endorphins in your mouth. The meat is tender, med rare, and the au jous is overflowing with herbs and spices. Ladies, bring a towel with you, because the chair WILL be wet. I hope your men aren't jealous, because believe me, THIS meat will be the best meat you have ever put in your mouth. Each bite of this mouth-pleaser will go straight to your pants area.  Seriously. Roast beef dip. Do it"
Shannie M.,"Chandler, AZ",0,4,,1.0,3/19/2016,"WAITED! 40mins for a simple mini deep dish & a bacon cheeseburger. The server that brought our food WAS NOT gracious or hospitable, she was so abrupt & discourteous that I felt like a dog or farm animal receiving slops. She never asked if there was anything else that we needed or wanted, she just clanked my plate down w/ what seemed like a pizza from PIZZAHUT & my husbands cold burger w/ fries & quickly turned away. By then, my appetite quickly disappeared & we left. So, if you want to be treated poorly & pay for it w/ your time & money, then I strongly recommend this place for you."
Mark W.,"Goodyear, AZ",125,41,9,5.0,1/17/2016,"Date night with the wife started great. Only had a 3-5 minute wait (rewards program is awesome & has its privileges) to be seated. We were put in front of an entry/exit door on a cooler evening. Asked to be moved, management tried but to no avail as they were pretty busy. He did, however, turn it into an exit only door to cut down on the amount of times it would be opened, (it only leads to the patio) since there was another enclosed door patrons could use. Server was very attentive and usually appeared out of nowhere to fill water and check on us. She was simply amazing. If you like clam chowder, pay a little bit more and get it in the sourdough bowl.....so worth it! An absolutely wonderful time with great food, good drinks and a wonderful wife!"
Amy B.,"Rochester, MI",547,1180,306,4.0,5/6/2012,"After a full day of shopping and going out, my mom and my friend Austin were starving! We were down in the Awatukee/Chandler area doing some shopping at Ikea, and decided we needed something to eat stat.  We didn't feel like driving very far, so we circled through the mall to see what we could find. We decided on BJ's as none of us had been there before and the menu looked really good from the outside. Its a beer brewery, but seems to have a really good menu of food items when eating here.  We got seated right away and our server was a real nice gal who answered all our questions. I went with the roast beef sandwich Au jus.  It came with white horseradish and was delicious!  My mom went with the tomato bisque soup and ceaser salad, and my friend Austin ate the bacon cheeseburger with some fries.  OMG food was so good! Water and beverages were filled quickly without being asked, and everyone here was happy.  I would love to come here and drink, as they have an awesome drink menu, but since I was driving everyone all over town AND we were with my mom, I guess I'm going to have to come back another time and get my adult beverage on here! I will say, the only negative thing I have to say about this place was that it was freezing inside! It was so cold that my mom had to go outside to warm up.  It was quite cold, but I was able to stick it out, but when my mom was outside warming up, so befriended another customer who was outside trying to warm up too!"
Bridget L.,"Phoenix, AZ",168,25,19,3.0,3/20/2014,"The service sucked. But the fish tacos and Mac & Cheese did not.  Our server never smiled, checked on us once, I had to ask twice for water, and never got a refill.  Usually, I would avoid us too, but my kids were even behaving today!!   I love BJs. I hope this is a one time bad time."
Adam F.,"Arizona City, AZ",1,17,,5.0,12/13/2015,Great spot! Took my wife here on a date night. They have a great selection of beers. Their dark beers are amazing
Kara L.,"Chandler, AZ",33,20,9,3.0,6/20/2015,If you want beer and/or dessert come here. The food is mediocre. Nothing special there. The only reason we really come is for the beer and pizookie. My husband loves the many types of beer they have. I love the warm cookie and sweet ice cream.
Chad W.,"Phoenix, AZ",519,119,174,4.0,6/30/2014,"This mall restaurant had a wide and well thought out selection of beers on tap and a menu that would accommodate any meal, whether you were just wanting a small lunch or a hearty dinner. We sat at the bar so we could have a prime view of the large screen to watch the game, and were met with excellent bar tending service and quick eats. Great spot that I'll be visiting again."
Jazzmine R.,"Chandler, AZ",0,14,3,2.0,4/27/2015,I've had two negative experiences here all due to service. Food is decent but not good enough to make me want to come back. Mediocre at best.
Chris M.,"Gilbert, AZ",15,31,8,5.0,9/25/2015,"First of please note, I'm a sucker for any place that has brewhouse in their name.  That being said I do dine here at least once a month.  The beer selection is very good with both house selections and guest brewers available.  The food alone would probably only rate 4 stars but the entire experience lifts them to a 5.  Service has always been good and there are a couple servers that are exceptional.  Even when dining in the bar, i have no complaints.  Their menu may be a little too big for me, but I'm pretty much a burger guy any way.  I will say their thin french fries are the bomb."
