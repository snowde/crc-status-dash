Tabbatha C.,"Commerce, TX",104,7,,3.0,10/15/2015,"The menu is massive.   Great atmosphere and very clean restaurant.  I ordered the unlimited soup and salad and my boyfriend got the chicken Parmesan.   The chicken Parmesan was very tasty but just not enough of the sauce on the plate.    The chicken tortilla soup was fantastic!   However, I did not care for the house Italian dressing.  It was too vinegary for my taste.    The ranch dressing was much better!   A little pricy."
Mar L.,"Tempe, AZ",389,262,10,3.0,2/17/2014,"I don't know what I was thinking BJ's was, but not what it is. I thought it was a run-of-the-mill steakhouse, and it's more of a run-of-the-mill brewery. Does this make a difference, you might ask - and yes it does.  So, as this will not become a stable of mine, my visit did make me want to come back in the right mindset and the right company. Plowing through brews and sliders - yeah, I can see that happen. OK, so the service is standard, and the food seems very basic and the brews are a bit interesting.. but I did notice that besides having quite a few Pale Ale's and IPA's, every other ale is pronounced to be 'hoppy'. What if I don't want a hoppy beer, nor want the token lager that is the stand-in for the go-to Bud/Miller/Corrs/30for$20 kinds of beer. I guess my options are limited, but I will need to plow through them all before I conclude that BJ's might oversell their product just a bit. I started with the Jeremiah Red, and wasn't blown away. I'd ask more of a Red Ale, and this was way middle of the road. Also very hoppy, even if it suggests being 'Not too hoppy in order to emphasize the complex malt flavor and fruity aroma'. I do not concur - I think its was too hoppy for a Red Ale. I will have to go hard next time to evaluate their brews. I have a feeling that I will not be all too impressed - but then again I will try to remain unbiased.  So where does this leave me? Nah, it's all right I guess.. and I will come back when the time is right."

Evan B.,"Tempe, AZ",262,546,1811,4.0,1/28/2010,"Great beer made on site, and some unique deep dish pizzas make for a great happy hour and reverse happy hour.  Despite the recent rise in the price of the mini pizzas the half off deal at happy hour is hard to beat. The deals on the beer are not the best, but they quality makes up for it.  I really like the spinach artichoke pizza, Imagine taking a pizza and using a creamy artichoke spinach dip in lieu of tomato sauce. That is one rich deep dish pizza. Couple with a tatonka stout and it is one great meal to indulge in.  Some of their other great beers are the Jeremiah red. As the name implies it is a red Irish beer. Usually there is a Belgium seasonal high gravity beer whose flavor and alcoholic punch is are to beat. For happy hour beers are $1 off mini pizzas are 1/2 off and most appetizers are $2 off. There is some deal on well drinks, but then why come to a brewery to drink anything other than beer?   If you find your self feeling the effects of the beer too quickly the potato wedge fires make for a great sponge to soak up some of the happy juice in the beer. Don't forget you can get a growler (1/2 gallon) of beer to go!"
Joe K.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,27,,2.0,3/1/2014,"My family and I tried this place last night and I was disappointed. First, the menu reads like Chili's or an Appleebee's, in which this place offers everything under the sun. Experience tells me this is not a good sign. Second, as suggested, the food was sub par. I tried their specialty deep dish pizza and it just tasted like a pizza from Pizza Hut. My daughter ordered the Mac and Cheese and it just average.  As for the beer, it was actually good. I wouldn't mind hitting up this place for Happy Hour, but if you are looking for a quality brewery to eat at, try Four Peaks or San Tan."
David S.,"Phoenix, AZ",52,186,45,4.0,1/5/2014,"BJ's is a pretty great place.  It's a chain, but don't let that turn you off.  They have a large, delicious menu, and a selection of both on-site brewed, locally-brewed, and general beers.  It's got a nice atmosphere, so would be suitable for a business lunch, date, or just a trip with friends. This location is in a plaza with a large mall, theater, and a ton of other places, so it's a great place to go, have a couple brews, and then do some shopping or see a movie!"
Kent B.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,2,,4.0,10/25/2015,"Ok, so when we first went, we did not have a good experience, but the Manager reached out to us and went out of her way to invite us back, and we had a really good time.  I would now recommend this place!"
Cris N.,"Phoenix, AZ",58,535,382,2.0,1/23/2014,"Service, especially after normal dinner hours is INCREDIBLY bad/slow/non-existent. Sadly the happy hour food is 'happy hour sized' which means it's not a deal at all. No TV sound. No TVs on patio. Should have many more TVs behind the bar instead of the stylish but not-functional/useful towers/back-lit shelves of extra liquor bottles. The architect got away with something not in bar-goer's best interests."
Brandon H.,"Chandler, AZ",14,24,,5.0,2/6/2014,"There are a lot of bar and grill restaurants, so what makes BJ's stand out? Service: The hostesses and servers are always friendly and willing to answer questions about the extensive menu. They always make me feel like a welcome guest. Beer: They brew their own beer, and each type I have tried has been pretty good. They also have a respectable selection of other beers, as well as wines and cocktails. Food: I am always impressed at how consistently good the menu items are. They serve lots of different types of food, and I have yet to find a weak link. The jambalaya I had yesterday was extremely delicious. It had meat or vegetable in every bite, and it was large enough for me to spread over lunch and dinner. Other hits include the calzones, pizza, burgers, pasta, and sandwiches. They seem to be everywhere nowadays, but don't miss BJ's assortment of Pizookies. Get the original, or indulge yourself with the triple chocolate. Ambiance: It is a large dining room with a high ceiling, so it's never that loud. The decor is modern and classy, making it a suitable place for just about any occasion. Value: The portion sizes range from large to huge. Lunch specials start at $6, and regular prices are very fair. This location is right next to the Harkins movie theater, and it makes a great place to stop after seeing a flick."
Christine V.,"Chandler, AZ",0,21,3,4.0,9/4/2015,"BJ's is my Go-To restaurant for ALL occasions!  They have great food, great ambiance, great service and cater to the night owls!"
Ellen P.,"Tempe, AZ",2,1,,1.0,5/20/2016,"Terrible, no, no attention or service after 10:30. Servers walk by you and ignore you, it's happened numerous times. We will not go back!"
Cindy C.,"Phoenix, AZ",119,144,,5.0,3/21/2014,"So I met up with a buddy today for a leisurely lunch and had a great time!  This is important because I had low expectations based on the Yelp feedback I've read.  We got seated outside to take advantage of the great weather and I was pleasantly surprised by attentive and prompt service.  We chatted for a while before ordering and got some great suggestions from our server. I've been craving a burger in the worst way.  I only have a couple a year and expect a lot from them.  BJ's burger came with parmesan toasted buns, tomato, pickles, lettuce, bacon, cheese, and a really delicious homemade.1000-Island dressing!  The meat was hi-quality and perfectly cooked..  It came with some yummy wedge fries.....I cleaned my plate! My friend had a wedge salad and a bread bowl with clam chowder.  She loved every bite!  I was pretty stuffed but she talked me into sharing a trio of pizzookies with ice cream.  They were delicious too, especially the peanut butter with vanilla. I was impressed overall and will be back.  I think the folks who have rated this place negatively should try it again.  It's worth it!"
Preston S.,"Oklahoma City, OK",162,178,32,4.0,8/14/2013,"Came here of my Birthday dinner with my girlfriend. I haven't been here since probably they opened way back in the day. It is one of my girlfriends favorite places and after the first place we were going to go to was full of obnoxious drunk people I decided we should come over here after hearing her talk about it. It turned out to be a great decision. There was a 20 minute wait when we arrived but that was not a big deal and not to bad for a Saturday night at a place at a mall. We put in our name and we were given a buzzer so we waited. The hostess even used my name when we came back in when the buzzer went off. Not a big deal but a nice touch. Most places ask for a name and never use it. The place was pretty busy but still not too loud. We got a nice booth and started to look over the menu. They had a lot of stuff that looked good. My girlfriend advised against any pasta dishes as she felt they didn't measure up. Of course she is part Italian so she is going to be a touch critic on Italian dishes. I saw the double cheese burger and my eyes lit up. Can't pass that up. Well it turned out to be a good and bad thing. That burger was HUGE but so good. Big patties, bacon, cheese and everything else. Cooked just how I wanted it. Very good. As got the spicy potato wedges, another tip from the girlfriend, they were delicious. Good thing I was hungry from swimming most of the day but I still couldn't quite finish it. Also I was saving some room for a Pizookie. Which I had never had and my girlfriend never goes to BJs without getting one. I ordered the triple chocolate one and even though there was a little bit of a wait for it, they don't make it until you order it, it was so worth the wait. So ooey and gooey and good. I will definitely be having one too every time we come back here. Overall, I really liked this place. Maybe won't get such a huge burger next time but I will be back. I also really like their in house beer. I had the Scottish ale and it was really good. I would like to try more of their different beers next time. There will definitely be a next time. This was a great Birthday dinner capping off a great day."
Stephanie V.,"York, ME",41,326,132,3.0,4/14/2015,"Very, very convenient for large parties. Very accommodating. The staff was fantastic. Food was....ok. Mixed drinks were below expectations. Horrible, horrible parking! The restaurant is a little difficult to find if you're not familiar with this extremely large area of stores and restaurants. Apparently, this area is very popular. The closest lot is for many popular businesses."
Tim Y.,"Chandler, AZ",35,1,,1.0,1/9/2016,"We were seated as soon as possible, services started out great and she was quick to serve us our drinks. I ordered a rare burger, I rarely eat burgers but I like rare, she took all of our orders and left. We received our food and I was given a mid well burger. I asked her to remake my burger, she was very courteous and said she asked them if it was a rare. I get the second burger, again mid well. At this point I don't want anything else and send it back, to which she says there's a policy of cooking as close to rare, despite being mid well and the second time I've asked. The manager comes to talk to me and I explain her response and he says she was wasn't clear, and FLAT OUT tells me and my friends the kitchen crew isn't good enough to cook a rare burger. Like, blatantly says he has an incompetent staff. I work in food service and have never heard of any manager ever saying basically his staff isn't up to snuff to cook a 5 oz patty rare. He comped the burger and as soon as we got our checks, I paid cash. The waitress gives me change and shorts me 5 dollars. I ask for the manager and he comes by and is somewhat rude about his approach. I work in this industry, I know sometimes you have an off day, but I received bad food, bad service, and bad response. I will not be returning to this company, I had high hopes but left with a sour feeling of BJ's."
Devashree C.,"Tempe, AZ",0,6,5,4.0,7/31/2015,"Gr8 place for drinks and food. Open till mid- night so if u r hungry n looking for a decent place to eat with less crowd, this is the place. Chicken wings r very light and not too much sauce. Must try - Pizookie"
Tiffani G.,"Scottsdale, AZ",425,138,134,3.0,1/17/2014,"BJ's is your typical chain brewery I think.  It's not quite as good as a 4 Peaks because well, everyone likes a one of a kind over a chain...the good ones any way.   I feel like one of the downsides is that their menu is like a novel.  I mean my gosh, make a decision here...what kind of food do we want to serve?  I don't want to read through a Cheesecake Factory sized menu when I just want to get a beer and good eats. It's not bad food, it's pretty good - nothing above and beyond but also nothing to write home about.  I have tried the Grilled Chicken Pasta which was just okay.  The second time I went I had the Balsamic Glazed Chicken which was actually pretty delicious.  I haven't gone too much into the beer menu as I'm not a huge beer drinker, but the list is actually pretty big.  Service was great both times, servers were always very friendly and the place was clean.   I'm sure I'll be back here at some point, occasionally it's comforting to know exactly what you're getting in to rather than the unknown. :)"
Andrew L.,"Chandler, AZ",0,3,,1.0,7/18/2015,BEWARE of your take out orders. Double checking is a MUST. Ordered a French Dip sandwich for take out and the staff decided to hold the Au jus sauce. Nothing quite like a dip sandwich with no Dip. Careless staff.
Emilie F.,"Chandler, AZ",34,13,26,5.0,1/5/2014,"I absolutely love this place! Beers are amazing there, the Piranha Pale Ale is definitively my favorite.  Food is also great, I tried several things on the menu and I never was disappointed. Their lunch specials are very good deals. Refill soups and salads."
Marci A.,"Chandler, AZ",0,17,1,2.0,7/11/2015,So disappointed. I used to love this place and have always had good service. Today we sat about 10-15 min w/ out drinks 2 times our drink order was wrong and we waited over 35 min for food. Was busy but not crazy crowded. Waitress was not attentive.
