Eric S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",1,33,17,1.0,4/30/2015,Stay away. Had to send back to kitchen 3 times a very simple order. Fully discontinued diet root beer. Not impressed.
Katie S.,"Chandler, AZ",13,69,19,3.0,3/4/2014,"I love the food here! I can't complain about any of it. My son, who may be the world's pickiest eater, loves the kids chicken fingers and smiley face fries. He even asked to go to dinner here... that is HUGE! Again everything we have eaten has been so good! However..... Slooooooooooow service. A couple of times coming here it has been slow, even the San Diego location has super slow service too. Ugh! When you dine with little kids, like us, slow service is the worst. Will we keep going back? Yes... but if we keep experiencing the slow service we will bring it to a managers attention."
Sopheak S.,"San Jose, CA",467,149,149,3.0,7/12/2011,"I was pretty disappointed with our visit here, we were expected so much more. The food was actually pretty good. We got the appetizer sampler combo and there was plenty of food on it. The avocado eggrolls are the best! I was not a fan of the california club flatbread appetizer pizza. I like the texture of the crust, but not a big fan of the toppings. I did not think the aioli that was drizzled on it went well with the pizza. But, you may like it because my girlfriend loved it. The big disappointment was actually the beer surprisingly. i actually enjoyed my hefeweizen very much. Light, full-bodied and flavorful. The red I tried wasn't very good however. My girlfriend's stout was a huge disappointment. It was actually one of the worst stout we have ever had. Not a lot of flavor and had a weird aftertaste.  I actually had better experiences with the BJs in California more, I don't know why. Each chain is a little different I guess."
Dia B.,"Plymouth, MI",413,103,135,4.0,4/22/2013,"Great place for good food during HH! I invited my picky friends here and they loved the food! Yes yes yes, they have an ""enlighted"" delish menu. BIG thumbs up for that. Menu is similar to that of Cheesecake Factory? super long w/so many choices. We had the shrimp lettuce wraps on the patio and Chicken ala fresca with veggies (minus rice).  It was prepared exactly as asked. One friend had the burger grill which looked super yummy...They even have a ""light"" version of the draft for you beer consumers ;) Overall? Dont let the name fool you, this place is good for a really nice, clean, healthy, fun and chilaxin time. Enjoy!"
Claudine F.,"Chandler, AZ",15,102,212,4.0,3/21/2013,"Great beer! If it was the beer by itself I were rating, bj's would get 5 stars.The blond and piranha pale ale are my favorites. Food is good, but service is hit or miss(never actually had terrible service, however only once had fantastic service). I go for the beer! And you should too!"
J M.,"Avondale, AZ",0,5,,1.0,6/24/2014,"I have visited this Bj's location twice in the last two weeks.  But each time I have visited there was no host at the door to greet me and or my campanion.  The employees seem to busy to say hello or even acknowledge it's customers.  It takes far to long to be greeted and or seated.  During my last visit I ordered a drink, deep dish pizza and asked for water.  However, in my hour and half visit the water never arrived and I was not offered a refill even though it was included.  The taste of the pizza was fair but seem to lack sauce.  So, I asked my hard to track down waiter about the sauce and he offered to bring a side of it to the table.  That was a nice gester, but it would have been nicer to dip my warm pizza into warm sauce instead of sauce that was very cold seeming to have come straight from the refrigerator.  I would not recommend this Bj's is you are looking for attentive service and hospitality.  They continue to fail in both of those areas. Sincerely,"
Khoa N.,"Chandler, AZ",133,72,2,3.0,9/28/2014,Beer was good.  Service wasn't horrible but it was slow. Maybe cause there wasn't many customers in the restaurant. Food was alright. Burger was really dry.  I actually had to use a ton of katchup.  Maybe cause my waitress didn't ask how I wanted my burger and they just make it well done. But pazookie was good.
Xi L.,"New York, NY",174,478,176,5.0,2/14/2013,"This is my fav Chandler, AZ restaurant for good reason. Amazing pizza and amazing cali chicken sandwich and AMAZINGGGG PIZOOKIES, too bad my north east friends have no idea what the hell a pizookie is but this is the shit. The best thing to grace the designation of dessert is the white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie. Great prices too this place really knows how to get you to come back. Relatively quick service on balance, lots of TVs for watching games. I haven't had the beer yet but its a brewery so I'm sure its good."
Mitch G.,"Maricopa, AZ",112,263,419,4.0,9/8/2011,"Started with a wedge just to pick something simple. Theirs is really good because their blue cheese is savory blue. Their root beer is smoothe too. I believe that I may  need to re-visit the place soon so that I can really say more about this that does not just sound stereotypical. What I recall is that I loved the food and that there were some service faux pas.  So, I want to give it another go.  Yelp lovers...bear with me.  I usually do not wait so long to follow up on my reviews that I start.  But I can confirm a really good wedge."
David C.,"Oakland, CA",0,11,1,2.0,3/2/2015,Ended up at BJ's based on a recommendation that their pizzas are really great. Not sure I agree... :)
Melissa F.,"Gilbert, AZ",20,26,20,5.0,1/4/2015,"I love BJ's Brewhouse! They have it all; great service, a wide variety of beer selection, excellent food in appetizers and entrees, and a beautiful restauran. I have rarely ever waited to be seated and their service is fast. I like to order the Harvest Hefeweizen, it had great flavor and is spicy enough for my taste. We always order their chicken wings - I like the hot and spicy sauce. My favorite entree that I always get without fail are the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos, they're delicious, light and refreshing. I have loved everything I've eaten here and will definitely return."
Cole L.,"Mission, KS",2,20,,1.0,8/30/2014,"Although I was contacted by customer service and offered a gift card to return in hopes of a better experience - which of course I accepted - they never actually sent the gift card. It would have been better for them to never even offer, if they had no follow through plans. Now I not only had a less than impressive experience at the restaurant, but now I also have a poor impression of their corporate office as well."
Anna S.,"Phoenix, AZ",125,58,53,4.0,11/12/2014,"Good food!! Prices are pretty good, I also enjoy the atmosphere it's a pretty restaurant. They have a lot of choices on the menu, good amount of beer on tap and TVs to watch the game in a not obnoxious environment."
Clinton P.,"Chandler, AZ",414,105,48,4.0,9/10/2014,Our favorite Friday date night spot before our movie..The Happy Hour specials are and selections are vast and the atmosphere is great surrounded by tv's.  The service has always been top notched and the wait time is never over 20 minutes.
Andy G.,"Ithaca, NY",245,445,10,4.0,1/29/2013,"This is a nice place to relax and have a drink or a meal while you're in the Chandler mall area. It's actually on the mall property, so it's easy walking distance from the mall itself and the nearby Harkins theater. I recommend hitting them for happy hour between 3-7 weekdays and then taking in some shopping or a movie. The menu is rather extensive and most of the offerings are quite tasty. The avocado egg rolls in particular stand out, and they usually have interesting offerings like bratwurst sliders and other bar food.  Some of the beers really stand out, and this is why you'd want to visit BJ's in the first place. If they have the seasonal Grand Cru, definitely give it a try, but don't plan on driving anywhere any time soon, as it's a very strong brew (10% abv). The porter and stout are very good. The hefeweizen is a bit watery and underwhelming."
LT S.,"Columbia, SC",13,55,120,4.0,9/2/2014,Great staff.  Well taken care of.  Food was good.  I'd come to this location again.
T A.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,90,,2.0,11/11/2013,"I ordered the avocado roll as usual but this time it was complete mush and have the worst a flavor ever this has always been my favorite dish and I always order it... as a main dish I ordered the barbecue beef sandwich .....the bread was hard ,as a rock the cheese wasn't melted and the beef was overcooked and crunchy this was terrible food at this restaurant this time I won't be back.    this BJ Brewhouse was the most disappointing I have ever been to."
Boom Y.,"Mesa, AZ",17,154,20,4.0,12/6/2014,"The food was good not great. I had the black and blue Burger which was good but smaller than expected. Bloody Mary was good not great. Coffee was good too. The reason why it went from a standard 3 stars to 4 stars was our server Cassie. She was great. Fast, prompt, professional, and just made us feel at home. BJs needs to hire more of her kind."
Shayna J.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,33,,4.0,1/17/2016,Menu has a good selection. Love the chicken and tortilla soup. Ahi salad good but could use a little more ahi for $15. Would definitely be back.
Lisa C.,"Scottsdale, AZ",105,40,1,5.0,8/29/2013,"My 2nd time at BJ's was last week. This is a busy business, but has adequate seating between the bar, the huge and beautiful restaurant and outside patio seating. We waited around 15-20 minutes on a busy night, but definitely worth it. Sometimes you go places and the menu is so small that it's either really easy or really hard to make a decision. Not the case with BJs! The menu is practically a bedtime storybook, which is awesome because you get to decide from a huge array of dishes, but also a pain because you want to eat everything, as in the case of myself! Boyfriend got the buffalo chicken wonton tacos for an app and he enjoyed them. He had the lighter option pork chops and enjoyed those as well. I had a burger and fries and it was very good. Service was good, too!  Another great thing is the dessert menu, which has a lot of good options, especially more than the average restaurant. (I'm not lying! See here:  ). Opted for the Baked Beignet, but they were out of it, so 2nd choice was the Oreo Cookies N Cream Pizookie! It was suuuuper delicious. I joined their rewards club and always get e-mails for deals, so I suggest signing up, it's worth it! Cannot wait to go back, just wish it was closer to my place!"
