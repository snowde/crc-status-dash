Claudia B.,"Phoenix, AZ",23,29,10,4.0,12/11/2014,Loved it ! appetizers were great tried the sampler. Also I ordered the shrimp scampi primeria (I know that is not the right spelling) But I had so much  had to get a to go box. It was great I will be going back
Phoebe M.,"Gilbert, AZ",56,101,13,4.0,10/4/2014,I tried their Pumpkin Ale Beer last night it was really good! Pizza was good!
Holly C.,"New York, NY",405,1256,5,3.0,4/10/2013,"3.5 stars Nice ambiance, okay food, good beer on tap. We went for reverse happy hour ($2 off of shareable apps, half off pizza). We tried the avocado egg rolls, ahi poke, and nachos. The egg rolls were pretty good but everything else was okay."
Michelle L.,"Garden Grove, CA",291,132,124,3.0,5/7/2013,"Food was good. But I don't feel like our server paid much attention to us until we had to call out excuse me a few times. I came with my niece and I myself look pretty young so I felt like she didn't care much about us cause she thought we were just kids or something. Lol. But nonetheless I'll probably be coming back to try other items, hopefully I won't have that server again!"
Christine L.,"Chandler, AZ",52,157,17,5.0,6/24/2014,"Love this place. Awesome food and a lot of different drinks to choose from. You can order pricey wine, or a good local beer. Their is also very good and always well done every time. Good place to hang out with friends, not such a family place, but definitely friends. Love the atmosphere as well, they display their drinks in a very cool way."
Andrea R.,"Chandler, AZ",129,9,3,1.0,5/23/2014,"Stopped in around 4:30 today and sat in the bar area to get the HH deals.  After waiting at our high top table for about 15 minutes, a manager stopped over to see if we had been waited on.  We told him ""no"" and he ran off to grab some menus.  When he came back, he assured us one of his servers would be over right away to take our order.  Since it wasn't busy, we figured this would be true.  About another 10 minutes went by without being acknowledged by a single staff member, so we decided to leave.  We headed over to Firebirds, where we had exceptional service and excellent HH drinks."
Paul R.,"Clarksville, TN",9,12,4,4.0,12/7/2014,Only eaten here a few times but really enjoy it. Great drink selection and good service. Nice clean restaurant. Try the jambalaya!
Mizz jazzi ladi L.,"Chandler, AZ",12,13,2,5.0,7/21/2012,"I do my ratings and reviews based off of Customer Service, Quality, Taste, and portion size of the food and drinks, and the cleanliness and style of the restaurant..... This is by far a new favorite place for me and my husband..... Me, my mother, husband and 5 month old son went to the restaurant on a weekday night around 10:00pm after leaving the movies..... ( We Saw ""Brave"" Great Movie)  Anyhow, lets get right to the important stuff when we entered the restaurant it was very clean, the setting was very romantic, it is a very smooth relaxing place for grown mature adults and families....  We received Friendly customer service immediately as soon as we walked through the door.... Since it was a pretty late  Monday nite  it wasn't too busy so, our waitress informed us that we could sit wherever we pleased.... We took a seat in a nice big round booth that was pretty comfy....  The waitress was very nice and pleasant..... Their menu is huge they have everything from Lobsters to burgers, salads, pizza and everything in between except for breakfast.... They specialize in freshly brewed beer and drinks.... Me and my husband don't drink so unfortunately I can't give a review on the alcohol.... Once seated the waitress took our drink order and me and my mom ordered they're Strawberry-Lemonade...... It was cool and refreshing, very tasty, the drink had plenty of strawberries the lemonade was not tart or too sweet, it was just right..... The waitress told us that they make it fresh every morning.... They actually charge per glass for the strawberry-lemonade..... But, our waitress gave us free re-fills...... (So in return she received a huge tip)  So on to the best part.... (I did taste everyone's dish)The food was Hot, freshly made, and very flavorful....  My mother ordered grilled pork chops with mashed potatoes and veggies.... Her meal also came with this awesome sauce which I will get into in a moment....  The grilled pork chops were so tender and juicy the seasonings and flavors were just right..... I will most definitely be ordering that next time I go again..... They also gave my mom this great vinaigrette, red wine, mustardy, type of sauce for the pork chops.... The sauce was amazing.... The mashed potatoes where fresh and hand mashed or blended (either way it wasn't instant mashed potatoes) They were red potatoes and they were seasoned just right and they were delicious.... (my 5month old son loved them) The mixed veggies were steamed and seasoned lightly.... They still had a nice crisp to them and great bright color.....  Now my husband he ordered the salmon with veggies and white rice.... His salmon was very moist and  tasty......  The rice was lite and fluffy..... The veggies were crispy and very refreshing.... My husband had water with his meal.... Last but not least, I ordered the steak salad... The salad was green, fresh, crispy and cool it had romaine lettuce and a lot of other great healthy greens.... the salad came with a very flavorful vinaigrette dressing.... they placed the steak on the side of the plate.... I think that they were a little stingy with the steak.... but other than that the steak was juicy cooked med-well and had a great taste..... The salad was very fulfilling and tasty..... it also came with a piece of bread and it was good nothing to brag about.....  Overall this is one of my favorite restaurants.... Me and my husband usually go here for our date nites and when we want to be romantic..... Its a great atmosphere and the food is amazing....."
Nicole G.,"Phoenix, AZ",318,143,529,4.0,11/6/2012,"BJ's might not be a Mom and Mom/local establishment, but when you've found yourself at a ubiquitous Shopping Center/Movie Theater and you're hungry...it's more of an oasis than say, Sbarros? But, I digress... The menu is crazy varied- You want something with an Asian flair, Mexican, or Italian? They've got it all --- Plus nicely crafted brews. Oh, and the notorious pizzookie. Ask the servers what they would recommend. They're more familiar with menu...and I have yet to be steered wrong direction."
A K.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",44,309,18,4.0,1/15/2013,"Wanted to have a nice ambiance and good food while on the a business trip here. Found BJ location quite nearby and it didn't disappoint. I hadn't try there sandwich before so gave a shot for the chicken club sandwich with thin fries. I have to say the bread and chicken used is perfect combo with just the correct seasoning.  I also tried the italian soda - orange flavor, it was yummy and free refills :)"
Chris O.,"Chandler, AZ",43,19,,3.0,11/20/2011,5 stars = The environment was great. There is a good view of a television from every table. That is often a problem with sports bars with large dining areas. 4 stars = The food was above average. I had the New Orleans Jambalaya. It was very good. Well seasoned and the food was cooked just right. Only complaint is there was too much meat and not enough rice. Wasn't mixed perfectly but still good. 3 stars = The menu is too random. Like they haven't decided what type of food they are going to master. Because of this the food is different every time I come here. The food depends on which cook  is cooking which meal.  2 stars = The server was awful. The only reason I am giving the server a 2 is because the server delivering the appetizers and food was very pleasant. Our server tried to remember the order but forgot and had to come back and ask. She did not refill drinks at all. She actually came by several times and looked at the empty glasses and ignored it.  She was too busy talking with other servers to pay attention to her tables.  3 stars = Total Review  I will try this restaurant again.
Matt K.,"Gilbert, AZ",62,33,2,5.0,3/14/2014,"We were at a fund raiser and they were handing out this amazing chicken salad with all kinds of fresh and delicious ingredients.  We asked where the salad was from and we were told BJ's.  So, after the fundraiser, we head over to BJ's.  We were told that there was a 15 minute wait so we sat out on a bench right outside of the restaurant.  The dancing water show is really cool to watch and helps quickly pass the time.  After a few minutes of waiting, a waiter came out and offered us a sample slice of pizza.  Wow!  That was the best, melt-in-your-mouth pizza my taste buds have ever been introduced to!  Now, I had a serious dilemma!  I was there for their yummy salad but the pizza was so awesome that I wanted the pizza too.  But, I didn't want to leave 20 lbs heavier.  When we sat down, my wife and I ordered a beer...the root kind.  Amazing!  If you like root beer, this place has a very smooth and great tasting ""homemade"" root beer.  I ordered the Chicken Barbecue Salad (I think that what it's called) and sure enough, it was just as good as it was at the fundraiser.  The atmosphere was great too!  My wife and I were hypnotized by the brightly lite bottles on display at the bar.  When we were finished with the meal, we were really bummed that we were full.  We wanted to get Pazookie!  So, our waiter went the extra mile and made it portable.  Yes, Pazookie to go was awesomely delicious even if you eat it for dessert at home.   If you're in the Chandler area and you need some excellent food.  Try out BJ's!"
D J.,"Chandler, AZ",1,91,38,1.0,3/23/2015,I now know what the B in BJ's stands for...Bland. Calamari had no taste even with the salt and pepper I added. Sent that back. My bacon cheese burger was dry and bland too. Didn't send it back just got a box and brought it home. 1 star because my pink lemonade was good
Shontel E.,"Chandler, AZ",1,5,,4.0,10/12/2014,They have the best lunch specials.  There unlimited soup and salad is the best. Can't beat the price.  There  pazookie is yummy.
Gary C.,"Chandler, AZ",0,17,,5.0,10/7/2014,Cool atmosphere.  I like sitting at bar with huge TV during sports.  Their pizza is one of the best I have had.  Salads are good .  Jumbalaya is awesome.  Menu is huge and I haven't had a bad thing yet.
Deanna K.,"Chandler, AZ",10,19,7,4.0,7/2/2014,"My dad loves coming to BJ's restaurant when he visits from Michigan. Today I decided to try something new, garlic Parmesan wings... And I am very happy I did. They were delicious and I got 10 of them! My father had the mahi mahi and was very pleased with it as well. I love that no matter what I eat, it's always amazing!"
Jake B.,"Chandler, AZ",11,18,,5.0,11/24/2012,"The family and I love this place, as does anyone I've taken there.  First time I went I had a cheeseburger pizza - huge and delicious.  Their beer is great too - brewed right on the spot.  The fish tacos are fantastic-- it says a lot about a place that every time you go, everything you try, is just great.  You'll pay a little bit, but it's worth it."
Brian B.,"Chandler, AZ",0,6,,2.0,12/8/2014,"After a day of shopping at Chandler Fashion we decided to stop in, watch the Cardinals game and relax with good food and exceptional beer. Just prior to arriving at BJ's our 7 y.o. daughter wanted some pretzel bites from Wetzels and we also decided to get some pigs in a blank for my mother-in-law. We walked into the restaurant where the manager very rudely and loud enough for other patrons to hear tell us we could not bring food from other ""restaurants"" into ""her"" restaurant. Her overreaction was completely unnecessary and very embarrassing to my family and me. Undeterred, we did stay even though we were forced to sit outside, not our first choice of seating arrangements. The wait staff was embarrassed by the actions the manager and they did a great job taking care of us. Perhaps a better way for the manager to handle the situation would have been to offer us a doggie bag or some way to conceal our ""contraband"" so we might have enjoyed indoor seating along with the other paying customers. On an up note the food and libations were excellent; the service was fantastic and I can only hope that the manager gets a scholarship to charm school prior to our next visit."
Adrienne K.,"Phoenix, AZ",111,16,1,4.0,12/6/2012,"My man had a wild hair to go here tonight and so we went. We both ordered top sirloin, but his came with a bleu cheese butter sauce on top. Mine came with no toppings, and the waitress didn't offer steak sauce. Hmm. Since I like my steak well done, one would surmise that I would probably want something to dip it in or pour over it, n'est-ce pas? But no. We waited for her to come back, he asked her for steak sauce and she comes back and puts it on HIS side of the table. You know, the side with the steak that already has a topping. Uhduh?  Also, I ordered my steak well done and it was perfect, albeit DRY as there was no sauce and I almost choked on it. But he ordered his medium, and it came out with no pink. Huh? All in all, a good deal for the dinners which were around $16 each. Good calamari app. Nom nom. The wine I chose was delicious - a blend, they're usually better. The garlic mashed potatoes were yummy too. This is the 2nd time we've dined here since moving to Phoenix and I still give it a thumbs up. The first time I enjoyed the ""Enlightened Thai Chicken Mango Salad"" and highly recommend it if you're into that kind of dish. But if you order steak, be careful to order it less done than you really want it. I probably could've played hockey or maybe football with mine. Good gracious. No other snafu's tonight, except that the tables outside were a bit too close and as the large party next to us was being seated, my boyfriend had a bunch of butts in his face. Back that ass up, ladies....actually, WE had to push our table away twice. And later a waiter was trying to carry like a million plates away from a table and of course he dropped them and scared us, giving us a few more grey hairs (thanks a lot). This stuff happens and it's like eh, whatever, who cares. But these details do kind of dampen the ambiance.  Really love the large selection of everything! Iron out the deets, BJ's Brewhouse!"
J P.,"Mesa, AZ",1,390,,2.0,4/13/2013,"Beer is ok. Food...meh. After watching more restaurant rescue shows than are healthy I should have learned a long time ago that any place with a menu the size of a phone book does mediocre food at best.  BJs is no exception to this rule. The menu appeared to be heavy on pizza like products so I figured going that direction was the best bet...so I ordered a flat bread.  It was supposed to have tomatoes, cheese and sausage.  Tomatoes, yes.  Cheese, yes.  Sausage...not so much.  There were a few (and I mean a few, sausage piece like substance on the flat bread, but I wouldn't say it was enough to qualify as saying the flat bread had sausage. As for the bread part of the flat bread it was crispy in parts and soggy in parts.  Overall not a good effort. So assuming you can't make the most prominent thing on your menu (pizza like products) well it is fair to assume that the products on the other 90 pages of the menu (yes an exaggeration...its probably only 12 pages long) are, in all likelihood, mediocre also."
