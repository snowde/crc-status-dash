Eric F.,"Los Angeles, CA",158,13,,3.0,11/27/2013,Honestly this is the worst BJ's I've ever been to. Service was slow. Root Beer tap was broken. Spinach and artichoke dip was cold when we got it. Pizookie was not fresh. Just not the best. My sandwich was still great which is why this is a 3. Could have been worse.
Abhishek N.,"Phoenix, AZ",12,36,2,3.0,10/12/2013,"Options for vegetarians are few but good. We ate the California club flatbread pizza as appetizer which was nice and crispy. For entree we ordered the toscana with no meat, fish or eggs. Along with spinach filled mushroom.  Will give a 1 out of 5 for spinach filled mushroom.  2/5 for toscana and 5/5 for pizza. Over all we are happy about the decision to try this restaurant."
Jeff N.,"Chandler, AZ",0,5,,2.0,3/18/2015,"I rarely write reviews but after this current scenario I just had to. I visit this location very often. I rarely have a bad experience. About 1 year ago, I was there and ordered an appetizer, salad and dinner. The appetizer was stuffed mushrooms that were served ice cold. We told the waiter (bartender) and they took care of removing it from the bill and brought a new ""hot"" one. When my salad was served, I had requested creamy garlic dressing (which they no longer offer) and instead, it came mixed with some type of vinaigrette along with creamy garlic. The manager now had to come over for the second time and agreed something was wrong and again replaced the item. My main course (pasta and chicken) was excellent. The manager removed all the defective items from our bill along with a discount and I was happy with that. Now about 6 weeks ago, I returned and ordered a new item that the waitress recommended. It was the deep dish lasagna. It was disgusting and below the first layers the food was ice cold. I called the waitress over and told her the issue. She sent the manager over and he agreed something was wrong. He left the table and the waitress brought the tab which had no adjustment for the lasagna that was inedible. I was so pissed that I paid the tab along with a 20% tip as she did a good job. I wrote to the company the following day about my dining experience and was immediately contacted by the store manager who apologized. He stated that he meant to take the lasagna off the bill but got busy talking to some people and forgot. He told me to provide my address which I did so he could mail me a gift card to try an entree on them next time. That was 6 weeks ago !!! I'm guessing he may no longer be managing there anymore....."
Lynn W.,"Chandler, AZ",355,399,,4.0,7/10/2010,"I went to BJ's when I lived in California.  The one in Cupertino is nice and big.  I had some time to kill before I went to a movie and it was July 4th so some of the other places had closed early.  BJ's was pretty empty.  I bellied up to the bar and the bar tender was there instantly.  She was great!  She gave me a menu and gave me a minute to look over a wine list because, silly me, I thought I would have a glass of wine....what was I thinking?  The bartender told me they had a great seasonal brew so I said I would give it a try.  It was a heif...er.....hief....dang, I can't spell it...but you know what I mean and it was good!!  It has a nice cardomon finish but not overpowering at all.   I ordered a Santa Fe Salad and it was delish!  Nicely cooked chicken breast and cruncy tortilla strips.  The dressing was good but a little too much of it.  Still I would order it again but maybe ask for dressing on the side.   The service was stellar.  The bartender, which I could remember her name, was knowledgeable and she was pleasant.  We chatted a bit and she was the same with the other patrons at the bar too.  When you eat on your own it's nice to go somewhere where the service is friendly and welcoming.  They brew the beer here too.  All in all it's a great place with a pretty varied menu and good beer."
Emmy M.,"Silverthorne, CO",112,109,,4.0,7/8/2011,"Oh BJ's... your manager saved you from getting a 2 star review. We came here to watch the Sharks during the NHL playoffs which was also during the NBA playoffs. Not even exaggerating, EVERY single TV had basketball on... so we asked our server if they could turn ONE TV to the sharks game. So they did and some douche bag at the bar gets upset because the TV in front of him was changed even when there were tons of seats at the bar right in front of the other TVs. Anyways, long story short guy complains, bartender agrees it was stupid to change it, and they change it back to basketball. We were pissed but thankfully, the manager did his rounds to make sure everything was okay and ended up changing another TV for us where we had a good view. Thank you! We come here very often during football and hockey season. Happy Hour is great, but make sure you sit in the bar area to get HH prices. The great white pizza is amazing, and so is the pizookie! I like it here because it's a great place to come with the family and have a beer!"
Carmelo W.,"Glendale, AZ",196,457,60,4.0,6/14/2013,I had a parmesan chicken sandwich there and it was really good. my bill was average too. service was nice and relatively quick. I'd definitely go again for lunch.
Jeff P.,"Phoenix, AZ",11,166,,3.0,3/17/2013,"Bottom Line: Food is mediocre despite nice ambience and service Food lacks flavor. It's as simple as that. There is nothing about the food that makes you want to come back...even for bar food. All of the dishes lack flavor. They look pretty on the plate but the flavors are not there. The calamari is dry and flavorless. The wings come dry without sauce; you have to ask them to ""toss the wings in sauce"" to  get what is normal wings(wet wings drizzling in sauce) anywhere else. If you don't ask that, they serve fried chicken with dipping sauces, sorry I can get that at KFC not at a supposed premium bar. The salads taste wilted and the dressings seem to lack flavor. The beer was mediocre. The menu is entirely too large. This place is a hit because of it's location and it's  atmosphere. It's an upscale sports bar resembling the Yard House  so a lot of people like to come here to have comfortable seating, nice service and nice tv's. But the food was very disappointing and if you care about what you eat, look elsewhere."
Michael C.,"Scottsdale, AZ",3,10,,4.0,10/27/2012,We are a regular at this particular location.  It is a great place to hang out.   The portions are large and we frequently share a dish.  The atmosphere is enjoyable.  It is a sports bar that actually feels like a nice restaurant. Great value.  We go there once a week.
Shy A.,"Portland, OR",262,1024,147,3.0,5/8/2011,"I remember coming to this location after a long day at work for HH. Not much has changed. The food choices are still extensive....lots of good beer on hand and the service is still as solid as ever. This is probably my favorite location out of this chain just because over the years, they have been consistent and that's a difficult thing to find nowadays.   I've always liked their fish tacos and calzones. You really can't go wrong here."
Jerod M.,"Maricopa, AZ",3,112,129,5.0,7/14/2011,"Service is always great, and the waiters are plesant and nice to have serve you.  This is one of my favorite breweries to come too.  They have a good selection of beer that is made in house, and you can also get a growler of any type to take home (or home made root beer, which is also amazing)  I have never had anything less than a great meal in the around 60 times I have ate here."
Joe P.,"Avondale, AZ",105,170,11,4.0,1/30/2013,"The stout is my favorite here... great place for happy hour. Cheap beer and the mini pizzas are half off. The pizookie alone should get 5 stars. My only complaint? Too many choices. You would think that is a good thing... well its not. I get so overwhelmed with choices I end up getting the same thing every time. Food prices are a bit high. They could certainly tone down the portions a bit, nobody should ever finish an entire serving here... its always way too much food."
T B.,"Anchorage, AK",21,295,24,3.0,5/21/2013,"Decided it was time for a half-pound burger, had their bacon burger which was very good.  Not a real fan of the ambience and might stop by here on occasion."
Yanira S.,"Chandler, AZ",71,259,445,5.0,4/22/2011,I've just come back from my second visit to BJ's and I'm STUFFED! I love the food and drink here-you just can't go wrong with this menu. The deep dish crust on the pizza is still amazing and this time we tried their chocolate chunk pazookie-nom nom nom!!!!
Josh P.,"Berkley, MI",45,139,,1.0,7/12/2010,"Man did this place suck.  Sunday night, dead as dead can be.  The only time we saw our waitress was to take our order and pick up my credit card.  We had to flag someone down in the middle of our meal to get some waters (which we never got) Food was sub par.  Avocado egg rolls were just deep fried guacamole.  It felt like I ate 2 avocados as an appetizer.  One minute after my first bite, we got our salads (now I'm feeling rushed) My wedge salad should have been called ""Sliver Salad"" or ""Molehill Salad""  Not good.  Wife and I shared a pizza which was decent but nothing like the picture in the menu looked like. Truthfully, I would have returned all my dishes but there was no one to talk to.  I felt horrible for the table next to us.  They had triplets who couldn't have been older than 3.  They waited at least 15 minutes for the server to come up to them and another 15 minutes to get their drinks. My wife went to the bathroom and saw our waitress in there on the phone complaining to her friend about rent money.  She'd make that money if she focused on her tables.  We left her 10%.  I walked in planning on leaving her 50%. We'll never go back again.  What a shitty corporate establishment. My amber ale was good."
Marty F.,"Scottsdale, AZ",265,314,13,3.0,10/15/2010,"Ive been here a couple times.  The service is not too bad, but if you have somewhere to go, let them know in advance you're in a hurry... they like to take their time. Ive ordered their sandwiches a few times and have been somewhat satisfied with them.  Nothing incredible, but not horrible.   However I did order their nachos one time.  They bring out this mound of red, green, plain nachos with tons of cheese, chili, peppers, etc all over it.  I was thinking this is gonna be good.  After eating the top half of the nachos (the best part), I find myself tasting nothing  but salt salt and more salt.  in the end, im thinking ""Would you like some nachos with your salt?""   Ive been here at least three times, and probably wont be rushing back anytime soon."
Richard R.,"Phoenix, AZ",187,452,,2.0,7/19/2010,"The Beer is good, most of the food is ok, but I have a big issue with BJ's.  They advertise their pizza as Chicago style deep dish.  When you order one, you'll know right away why there isn't a single location of this chain in Illinois.  The Pizza is more like something I'd expect to have ordered at Pizza Hut than anything I've had growing up in Chicago. Have a beer here before seeing a movie next door.  Other than that, there's way better places to eat in and around Chandler Fashion Center Mall."
Ari S.,"Chandler, AZ",0,13,,4.0,8/22/2011,"For a brewery type restaurant they do a pretty good job, in fact mabe the best one in town for me. Most of these type of places do a very mediocre jobs with a very extensive menu.  BJ's has a great gluten free options. the pizza is very good, probably the best I've had in town. good selection of beers. service is always pretty good."
Renata P.,"Hoover, AL",184,277,9,2.0,11/6/2010,"I guess I shouldn't have high expectations for a chain, but I was quite disappointed in this place. Went for happy hour with some friends who apparently like coming here (not sure why though).  Although I will say that the service was awesome, the ""good"" ends there.  The food, meh. We had some apps including calamari (kinda tough), spinach dip (I've had better), and the avocado rolls (the best out of the 3). Not super impressed with any of it.  The drinks, they were made well, but at $4.75 for WELL on HAPPY HOUR - it really didn't make me very happy at all.  Next time I will go somewhere else for happy hour where the food and drink prices really do make me happy."
Julie S.,"Tempe, AZ",3,26,,1.0,2/26/2012,"I'm not quite sure exactly how I feel about this place. I took my family (6 ppl) there for my adult sons birthday. The atosphere was great, the decor was very nice, but the service and the food, not so much. First we had been waiting so long for a table that my family started getting upset that there were families coming after us who were being seated before us and they were just coming in not waiting like we were. It was painfully obvious that the girl running the seating, was very inexperienced and they need someone with more experience.  We were finally seated after about 45 minutes and were really looking forward to having a positive experience. Well, there is always hope.  First the waitress was a bit sloppy and we felt rushed. I use to waitress, you never ever ever rush the people you're waiting on. Then it took about 10 minutes to get our drinks and the only people who recieved water were the people drinking alcohol. There use to be a time that they put in on your table the minute that you sat down. To make it short and sweet, the food. Waaaay over priced for what you get. The appetizers were just ok. Nothing to get thrilled over. My daughters fish was over cooked, the hawiian rice that it came with was too sweet, there was nothing balancing it out. My sons huge Black & Blue Burger had this little tiny bit of blue cheese on it. My giant baked patato cost over $8 and the toppings were hardly enough for a mini potato. About 5 minutes after I ordered it, I told the waitress that I had changed my mind and she told me that it was too late. Really too late to change my mind on a baked potato? You have got to be kidding me.   I spent almost $200 and left disappointed, that should never happen."
