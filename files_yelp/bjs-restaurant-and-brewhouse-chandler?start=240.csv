Matt S.,"Queen Creek, AZ",183,426,1031,4.0,3/11/2010,"Excellent.  Can't say enough about the sampler plate & pulled pork sliders.  YUM!  Very fun place, lots of TVs and of course SPORTS always on!  Love going here."
K P.,"Chandler, AZ",5,84,,4.0,2/25/2012,"I've been going to BJ's for lunch since they opened.  The food is 5/6 on a scale of 10, but what brings me back is the atmosphere.  It's very comfortable and inviting whether a party of two or twelve.  It's a ""must lunch"" for out of town guests due to the handcrafted beer selection.  Always a hit and now a ""tradition.""  First BJ's - then bowling.  After a few Ales, Blondes, Stouts, and Reds, no one cares how many pins they knock down (hee, hee, hee)!  If you haven't been, you should go!  I prefer lunch.  Dinner is crowded."
Michael L.,"Chandler, AZ",8,18,,5.0,4/8/2011,"What can I say, this place has it all. Great service, a hugh variety of food to choose from. I really like their pesto chicken grilled pizza, but I could go on forever with all my favorites. Check out there craft beers too. Simply delicious."
Gehan K.,"Chandler, AZ",49,182,15,4.0,9/25/2012,So this is actually one of my best places to go for happy hour. Good drink selection and a nice ambiance. Second time around did not disappoint me. Calamari was great and do try to Mediterranean veggie pasta dish....very healthy.
Jennifer O.,"Phoenix, AZ",367,1822,73,3.0,12/30/2011,"This place was surprisingly better than I thought it would be. I went here for lunch with my grandma yesterday and it was alright. The one thing I really didn't like was that their menu had too many different types of food and the lunch specials, although plentiful, didn't look all that good to me. So we decided to share a few apps. We got the spring rolls, lettuce wraps, and the mozz and tomato salad. The salad was pretty good, the balsamic on it was tangy and it was a decent deal at 3$. The spring rolls were also just alright....they were like a tex mex spring roll....the plate has a lot of rolls, but the sauces they serve with it weren't very spicy or flavorful. The lettuce wraps were kind of the same way.... they were a bit bland, not bad, but not good. We ended the meal with the triple chocolate pizookie. This was the best part....super chocolatey and delicious. I'd go back if I were in the area, but for the price, it isn't anything special."
Erisa F.,"Chandler, AZ",10,1,,1.0,9/26/2013,"I dont think I will go back there for food anymore. This is my second time to get overcooked food with poor service waitress,"
Ross A.,"Gilbert, AZ",1,81,,4.0,5/11/2013,This place has one of the largest menus I've seen in a while. To top it all off the food is pretty frickin' good. The burgers are better than many other chain restaurants I've tried. The pizza is surprisingly great. And the appetizers are good enough to make it a main meal.
Jill T.,"Chandler, AZ",23,65,1,4.0,2/11/2010,I've been here many many times and have never had a bad time. Everything has always been up to par. I literally have no complaints. AND - I recently dropped a personal check made out to me while getting cash out to pay my bill. The manager found it and mailed it back to my client. Talk about honest service.  BJ's is our go to place for an easy weekend lunch. Their home brewed root beer is super good.
Lauren J.,"Gilbert, AZ",155,315,10,4.0,11/25/2012,"I've gone here a few times and have always liked the food and service. I like coming for their happy hour (and reverse happy hour). Their menu is huge (think Cheesecake Factory) but everything I have had is good. The ambience of the restaurant is nice, not a big place but it's cool to see the brewery through the glass next to the restaurant. I would recommend the pizza!! They also do a pizza cookie but I LOVE the fact they have a brownie...mmm! They also do a trio of cookies, which is amazing. The only con's would be price and their chips & salsa. Both can be improved :)"
Michael L.,"Chandler, AZ",111,8,,5.0,8/25/2013,Great pizza!   I ate here tonight and thoroughly loved their signature deep dish pizza - absolutely fantastic.   BJ's has a great atmosphere too.
Jennifer R.,"West Deptford, NJ",9,7,,4.0,7/2/2012,"Went here the first night in Surprise, AZ with my sister, her boyfriend, and my husband. We were visiting them for a few days and they highly recommended this place.  We got the pot stickers and mozzarella sticks and both were very delicious. My husband had the porkchop and said it was very good. I got the small bite meatballs and they were very good. My sister got the small bite mac and cheese and we all tried a bite of it and it was very good. Her boyfriend got a hamburger and said it was ok.  This place was reasonably priced and it was worth going to."
Jason L.,"Chandler, AZ",6,18,28,4.0,6/24/2012,"We really love the food, atmosphere and beer!  Watched the NBA finals the other night and it was perfect."
Jarratt W.,"Monterey, CA",46,88,5,3.0,8/24/2012,"Please turn up the AC!!! The food was ok, just not very excited about this place. Best thing about it is the Light switch beer."
Becky A.,"Chandler, AZ",66,172,63,3.0,5/14/2012,"This place is good.  I have nothing bad to say...it's your standard brewery type place...although the menu is the like the size of Cheesecake Factory's.  Depending on how busy it is, service can be really good, to fair.  We don't go out of our way to go here, but if we're in the area, we'll drop in occasionally."
John C.,"Scottsdale, AZ",10,247,228,3.0,2/6/2013,"Big, chain restaurant with a huge TV in the bar. Happy hour prices are good and the bartender was nice while we waited for a table. We were there for a birthday party and the server did a good job handling a big party. The food was average for this type of restaurant and the prices were reasonable."
Jaswant A. S.,"San Diego, CA",37,577,427,3.0,4/26/2012,"Ok. So one of the lunch companions in our ""foodie club"" is actually THE Duke at this  very establishment. Yup. THAT many check-ins. I'm not really sure exactly what benefits a  title like ""Duke Of BJ's"" would get you.  Perhaps it might get you out of a speeding  ticket or get you backstage at a classic rock  dinosaur reunion show but you might end up having to ""prove"" your credentials. So anyway this place is never my first choice but it gets voted in our rotation so I'm a regular  here. The lunch special tacos are light and make for a decent lunch. The miso salmon is also good although a bit pricey. And I must say the Chicken Parmigiana is also quite  doable. Came here once for a happy hour and appetizers were meh. Also, you never know what level of service you'll get. We've got some very professional and courteous waitresses and we also have had our share of either totally clueless or just plain rude waitresses. We never have seen the latter a second time so  that's a good thing."
A J.,"Tempe, AZ",0,13,,4.0,2/9/2014,"We've only been here once but we really liked the booth setup.  Shoestring fries were very delicious, the fish was ok, the Asian salad was also very good.  Seems like typical college co-ed sports bar and the wait staff were very fast."
Jeff K.,"Chandler, AZ",76,103,89,5.0,3/26/2012,I've been to BJ's a lot through the years mainly for lunch and sometimes for dinner. Their beers are excellent. My favorite is the pirahna ale. Everything that I have ordered is always excellent brewery food. My favorite lunch is the California Club flatbread pizza but you can't go wrong with the soup and salad or the sliders. They have a huge menu too. C'mon it's a brewery so you just know that it awesome.
Jose T.,"Chandler, AZ",48,198,282,4.0,8/29/2010,"The wings here are excellent.  I rate them at the top now that VooDoo Daddy's is no longer in business.   Their other food items are good as well.  Nothing too special, but very above average. The wait staff has always performed to my expectations. If you are a fan of rootbeer, this is the place for you.  They brew their own, and it is magnificent.  It's got a good bite to it. This place is able to accommodate different types of customers.  They have an outdoor seating area, they have a large bar equipped with flat screen TV's and surrounding bar tables, bar stools, & booths, they have their general dining area wrapped around the middle of those two areas.   I'd come here for the wings alone."
Julie H.,"Gilbert, AZ",1,6,1,2.0,9/30/2014,"My coworkers and I order from this BJ's often, mainly because it's one of the few places around us that delivers. The food isn't terrible, but the service usually is. Just about EVERY time we order, one or more of the following is inevitable; there is food missing, we are over charged, the person taking the order doesn't have a clue what they have on their menu, it takes an unreasonable time to get delivered (usually because the driver gets lost) and the ""delivery charge"" amount is excessive. The past few times have just been ridiculous. In fact, the last time we ordered, we had every one of the aforementioned go wrong. We were charged separately for every single thing that should've been included in our meals, (fries, salads, soups, etc.), the delivery gal headed the opposite direction of our location and took over an hour and a half to get here. The food was nasty, cold, rubbery and some things were missing. I don't know how the dine-in service and food is around lunchtime, but I can assure you that they need to do some serious adjustments to their take out/delivery! Just because we are eating take out, doesn't make our order, service or food less important. GET IT TOGETHER, FOLKS!!"
