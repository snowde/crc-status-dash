Shanna K.,"Ypsilanti, MI",159,435,21,4.0,3/7/2010,"I was actually really impressed, even though I didn't think I would be.  I headed here for lunch last week when Chipotle was super busy. They have a great and fairly affordable lunch menu with lots of options, including lots of vegetarian options.  I also really appreciated that my waitress went back and checked with a vegetarian staff member to see if the tomato soup had meat stock (it didn't, but minestrone did). I got the pasta with the soup or salad combo with this delicious Mediterranean pasta - olive oil, feta, pine nuts, tomatoes and red peppers.  The pasta itself was surprisingly bland, but with a hint of salt and pepper, it was pretty tasty.  The bread that it came with was also delicious, all on its own.  I got the tomato soup, and man, it was definitely one of the better tomato soups I've been lucky enough to have. My server was great about the food coming out quickly, and was on top of my refills.  Very friendly, not over-crowding. I'll be back in the future with my partner to get a better feel for the beer (which I don't drink) and meat dishes (which I don't eat), but I'm happy with my first visit and will be back!"
Cj L.,"Chandler, AZ",1,11,15,2.0,10/24/2014,"Good food and great place to eat with family, friends, and coworkers. I did go there a few months back and in took 45 minutes to get my drink order taken."
Tom D.,"Charlotte, NC",22,13,,5.0,4/3/2012,"The best steak salad I've ever had! Love the fresh brewed beers too! Excellent menu with choices for everyone including gluten free. Every time I go to Chandler for business, I have to stop in at BJ's at least twice!!"
Deb S.,"Tempe, AZ",67,784,26,2.0,7/3/2012,"I think that BJ's is a hit-and-miss kind of place. Today was just meh. We three gals were out to lunch before a movie at the Chandler Mall location. The menu is huge, the TV's are on with sports action, the drinks were cold, service is adequate, and the food is too. We all had salads - three different salads actually. I had the ahi tuna and though the tuna was plentiful throughout, the tuna was way too peppery and the salad was soggy. One of my friends had the Thai chicken mango salad with the dressing on the side, which made it a lot less goopy. My other friend had the honey crisp chicken salad but the chicken was missing-in-action. It sure didn't look like the picture. Our server was unfamiliar with the menu and couldn't answer our questions. Maybe she was new? I know that it's tough to be a waiter/waitress and they sure do work hard. But hey, a smile and some friendly service goes a long way with me."
Brandon M.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,12,,2.0,7/27/2014,"Normally love this restaurant but last two times my wife and I have come to this location it has been sub par. The table that they placed us at was completely covered with the previous occupants remains. After we had to run down a waiter to have the table wiped down he did it very quickly which left us with the food gone but a sticky table. We just used our napkins to lay over the table so we didn't have to deal with the stickiness. After we finished it took us 15 plus minutes to flag down our waitress for our check (which she did not even ask to refill our waters once the entire time we were there) and the place was not even busy. Needless to say probably be the last time we attend this brewery, the extra 10 minutes it takes to drive to San Tan Brewery is worth it."
Daniel B.,"Phoenix, AZ",407,148,36,3.0,11/8/2011,"BJ's has a very large menu, too large I think. When you have large chain restaurants with huge menu's you already know that they are trying to cater to the masses rather than producing a really quality specialty item. For the most part I was pleased with my order. I went with the Creole Tilapia, which is on their under 575 calorie menu. I considered the Chicken A La Fresca but the waiter advised me that it wasn't that great. I was very appreciative of his insight and honesty. The beer they serve was pretty good as well. On tap they have everything from a light beer to a nutty oatmeal stout. If you aren't sure what you're in the mood for then BJ's is a good place to go as they have descent food and tons of it."
Adam D.,"Chandler, AZ",0,8,,2.0,3/7/2013,"Slow service and cold nachos. I did like the seasonal Red Beer but the food and service were disappointing. My family has been conning here for years and while the food was never amazing, it was consistent and what I expected. This time food and service was both poor. We waited for ever the check and finally had to grab someone after ten minutes of not seeing our server again. Next time I'll just have the beer."
Kerri B.,"Mesa, AZ",0,23,3,4.0,1/22/2013,"Good place to drop by for happy hour. Great selection of beer, and love their flatbread pizza."
Carmen M.,"Mesa, AZ",3,13,,3.0,6/2/2009,"I've been on a quest for a flavorful, texture-rich, full-bodied salad. The last one I really enjoyed was the Santa Fe Chicken Salad at the BJ's in Mesa. So, today I went to the Chandler restaurant for a work lunch in hopes of  satisfying the craving. Work hours meant no beer...maybe that's why I didn't inhale this one as fast. It was still good. I'd order it again. I'd also order the Pizookie made with  peanut butter cookie. That devilish little treat (that I shared, btw) got me on a new PB craving. Ugh. The salad was $10.95, and came with well-seasoned chicken (minor kick), corn, avocado, tomatoes, red onions, tortilla strips and a good dressing."
Stacy C.,"Aurora, CO",202,261,416,4.0,1/31/2010,"I love BJ's. The menu is a little too big, but everything I have tried is great! The beers are good, if you like good beer, i.e. something other than Coors or Bud. The wings are awesome, they just drizzle a bit of sauce and then give you more on the side so they don't get soggy. The bruschetta is delicious. The thin crust pizzas look great, but I haven't had one yet. The avocado egg rolls are yummy and the grilled shrimp tacos are one of my favorite dishes. Perfect end to a day of shopping at Chandler Mall."
Francesca R.,"Thornliebank, United Kingdom",109,563,64,3.0,10/28/2009,"Everyone loves BJs.  Well, men particularly. That's right--I went there. Thanks!  I'll be here all week.  So, the restaurant--solid three stars.  Good pub grub, good beer, great happy hour, friendly service.  Nothing out of this world but a reliable place for a night out."
Nicole C.,"Chandler, AZ",36,58,22,3.0,3/5/2012,"I'm kind of in the middle with BJs Brewery I like to go here for lunch every once in a while. Overall the atmosphere is what tends to bring me back its very inviting and relaxing. The food is good I really enjoy their Santa Fe spring rolls as an appetizer, the pizzas are always up to par and lets not forget their skookie they have for dessert yumm!!!  I also love that they have pear cider on tap here where many other places I'm lucky if they serve it at all. Overall its worth stopping in and giving it a try."
Philip T.,"Gilbert, AZ",14,139,79,4.0,1/28/2012,Way above average corporate food. Beer selection is excellent. Food is good and service is way above average. My only complaint with the place is the menu. Do I really need to read through a 20 page book to figure out what I want? If you're looking for someplace to kickback and relaxed with a good brew and good food; BJ's is hard to beat
Lindsay M.,"San Francisco, CA",322,279,114,3.0,7/6/2011,"We frequent BJ's on girl's nights. They have good food, a casual atmosphere and great beer. I would give it a higher rating if their prices were a little lower for the type of cuisine you get. Can't go wrong with the crispy artichoke hearts, the pizzas or a baked potato."
Violeta H.,"Phoenix, AZ",212,366,141,4.0,12/22/2010,"visited BJ's for the first time while attending a company holiday party. they had a great buffet style setup for the entire group-appetizers, pizza, and cold drinks.  we were all in the patio and it was chilly but still comfortable. the restaurant is nice and open. we went back and the pizza was just as good as when it was not on our dime.. I like that. Chicago style pizza awesomeness! OMG.. one slice fills you up. the pizza is on the rich side so not the kind of pizza you eat often but a great place to treat yourself. looking forward to trying the beer and thin crust pizza...btw, they brew their own beer."
Brendan W.,"Strawberry, AZ",6,321,348,5.0,2/18/2012,"5 star deep dish pizza.  Great sandwiches, good service.  Call ahead to see how long the wait is.  They turn tables quick and staff up so wait time isn't bad.   Located in front near Chandler mall fountains.  You can walk around with pager."
Max Y.,"Guadalupe, AZ",1,7,,5.0,7/13/2010,"This review is going to be a bit lopsided because I only come in on Tuesdays for their drink specials. The food I've had has been really good: flat bread pizzas, spring rolls, lettuce wraps, burgers, and best of all, their pizookie. All of it is great every time. Tuesdays are definitely the days to go; $2 BJ's pints from 10 to close. You'd think the selection of brews to have on special is too narrow, but they've got a beer for anyone. My favorites so far have been the Jeremiah Red (pretty strong Irish red ale), the Nit Wit (Belgian spiced ale), Big Fish (a pale ale stronger than the Piranha pale ale), and the Grand Cru (10% Beligian!). The servers we've had over the past couple years have all been great and really friendly. Totally worth it, if only for the Tuesdays."
Jennifer G.,"Pinal, AZ",73,208,,4.0,4/9/2011,"First time visiting BJs last night and I thoroughly enjoyed what I ordered: BBQ Ranch chicken salad with avocado added. The salad was fricken huge and I loved the crispy onions on top. It was cold and refreshing and divine! Hubby got the California burger and said it was ok. All in all, a decent place but was a bit pricey. 12.00 for my salad and 10.00 for his burger that wasn't very big. Strawberry lemonade was ok but Chili's has better. Pizookie was good but they are easy to make at home, not worth it to pay for one here. Service was good although my avocado was initially left off my salad. Would I go back? Yes I would but not often since its kinda pricey for what it is. Would get the salad again, maybe try their pizza, and some of their brews."
Katarina H.,"Chandler, AZ",53,64,,4.0,6/22/2011,I eat here at least once a week. The food is great and I also love how they've expanded their menu as of late to include dishes. I am a huge fan of their blackened salmon.
Devon A.,"Chandler, AZ",337,273,107,4.0,7/31/2009,"BJ's is fun if you're with a buddy and need a quick bite before a movie over at Harkin's. The beer is made on the premises and is really good, they got a ton of huge tvs, sitting at the bar is a good idea if you're not there with kids, and the baked potatoes rock. Pizza is just so so, salads are good, and burgers are just average."
