Jason N.,"Gilbert, AZ",188,150,192,5.0,8/30/2009,The root beer that they make is should be considered CRACK! I go there just for the root beer. Everything in this place is good they have a few floor managers whom walk around asking you if your food is ok. If its not they will take it back and then something else is back to you in 10 mins.  And its right next to a comic book store to boot. Its a good area to go and eat. I would visit again and again.
Danny D.,"Lexington, KY",773,365,47,5.0,10/11/2011,Brook at the bar was nice. This place had great air conditioner. Nice selection of beers.
Christopher G.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,72,,4.0,3/18/2014,"A great place to hang out and have an awesome meal with friends. Great food and beer. fast, friendly service."
Deiniol M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",252,73,44,2.0,9/22/2008,"A note to the owners of BJ's Restaurant & Brewery regarding the style of pizza you serve: I don't know what it IS, but I can tell you what its NOT, and its most definitely NOT 'Chicago-Style'. How do I know this?  Because up until about a month ago, I called Chicago home for the last 20 or so years. Pizza has three main ingredients- a crust, a sauce (typically a tomato-based sauce), and cheese (typically mozzarella).  Serving two out of the three does not mean you can still call it a pizza.  This is pass/fail, all or nothing, an you are not graded on a curve; there is no 'E' for effort. Now some will argue, but typically, 'Chicago-style' pizza has a thick crust and, in at least a couple of restaurants, the sauce and cheese layers are inverted, but the pizza HAS sauce (am I making my point here, or am I being too subtle?). Do yourself a favor, BJ.  Go to Chicago, and go to Gino's East, Pizzeria Uno, Due's, and Lou Malnotti's for a crash course in what 'Chicago-Style' pizza is, then come back here and fix this trainwreck of bread and cheese before you do any permament damage to the phrase 'Chicago-Style Pizza'; well, no more than you've already done. Your one saving grace is the beer you brew right on premises, otherwise this two-star review would be a one-star review, and I'd never have a reason to darken your doorstep, or subject anyone else to your bread with melted cheese on top. Keep up the good work on the beer, but fire the guy that came up with your pizza recipe and start over.  Then I may try another one of your pies; until then, I'll just stick to the beer. Viewing it from that angle, then, BJ's has a nice bar.  Its a bit loud inside for a restaurant, but for a bar, its just fine, and they do have lots of TVs tuned to just about anything you could want to watch. Come for the beer, stay for the... beer.  But if I've been too subtle, and you missed the point- don't bother with their 'pizza'."
Katie F.,"Chandler, AZ",136,14,2,5.0,11/15/2010,"Probably my favorite spot in this city to get Gluten Free pizza! They also take into account cross-contamination for us Celiac's, which means I can go out to eat without stressing or worrying over whether I will have a migraine with the hour. Anybody out there with similar dietary constraints can appreciate the significance of that. Besides the pizza, though, they have a pretty wide variety of GF dishes, and my non-Celiac friends and family always seem to find a dish they love, (my mom always gets one of their pastas). I go here once every few weeks, typically. Love it!"
Emily H.,"Sandy, UT",99,127,13,4.0,11/28/2010,Had a wonderful meal with friends at BJ's. They loved the avocado rolls as much as we did (BEST avocado spring rolls ever!) and we all ordered the California chicken sandwich. It did not disappoint! Service was fabulous--those Diet Cokes with vanilla just kept coming. And the Pizookie was a hit as well.
Tracy M.,"Chandler, AZ",1,9,4,5.0,5/19/2011,I love this place!  The staff is super friendly and the food is always good. I especially enjoy the bar area with all of the TVs for enjoying the games. I don't know the Manager's name but he was super helpful when we wanted to celebrate a friend's birthday.
Emily T.,"Saint Louis, MO",36,233,7,3.0,9/14/2008,"BJ's is OK on occasion. My husband loves the mostly sauceless, tomato-strewn pan pizza. Me, not so much. However, the atmosphere seems fun (kind of loud, but that drowns out our usual loud talking). There are flatscreen TVs throughout the restaurant, in case a game or a major weather event (hurricane season) is on. The booth seating is comfy, and we see a lot of families, so it looks pretty kid-friendly as well. I've tried various dishes here, such as sliders washed down with BJ's Hefeweizen. The sliders and thin fries were pretty darned yummy, and the 5 oz. taster-sized Hefeweizen was the perfect size (and price!) for a lightweight and/or someone who has to drive soon thereafter... I am not a beer connoisseur, so YMMV! On separate occasions, I've tried the Angel Hair Toscana dish, which was just OK and came with a side of garlic bread. I've had the French dip on a couple occasions, and that is highly recommended; I love a good au jus... The other night I tried the Field of Greens salad with candied pecans, feta, red peppers, and a balsamic vinaigrette; that was quite yummy. I coupled that with a taster-sized Berry Burst Cider, which is really sweet and hit the spot. For dessert, the Cookies N' Cream Pizookie is quite good, so you might want to save room for that (be sure to share it with 1 or 2 more people ~ it's rich and should feed at least 2)! The Apple version pales in comparison ~ don't bother with that... Finally, I'm a caffeine fiend, so I was pleasantly surprised that their coffee does not taste like old socks. I recommend BJ's for a casual night out."
James D.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,24,,5.0,1/29/2012,If you want a big and tasty burger get the black and blu burger its so goood! Very juicy
Kelly C.,"Mesa, AZ",52,153,27,2.0,8/24/2011,"The food was probably a 3 star, but the service and the price were definitely a one star deal.  I think if the server had deigned to crack a smile (Adam I think) his face would have broke.  And it was so overpriced it wasn't funny.  $9 for a mediocre margarita, are you kidding me?     We ended up spending like $50 for lunch, what a bunch of bs.  Would never go back unless unless someone else was paying."
Kevin G.,"Tempe, AZ",109,254,43,4.0,5/20/2011,"Another restaurant Kevin and I frequent when we are out and about in Chandler. Good prices, and the food is consistently good. I love the vegetarian pizza. In fact, their pizzas are all pretty good. Kevin got the nachos last time, which he enjoyed. I am no beer critic, since I pretty much hate it, but since it is a brewery, I can only assume the beer is up to par. The service is also good, and I love how lively it always is, even at ten on a Monday night. I always walk away satisfied and with the confidence that I have not just wasted my money on mediocre food and drinks. Thanks for being a friend, BJ's!"
Jessica F.,"Saint Paul, MN",3,86,,3.0,10/3/2013,"Came here with some friends after work. Our waitress was pretty good, friendly. I really only care about food. I ordered the wings. They tasted fine - not great by any means. Not nearly as good as BWWs, which is pretty much next door, or Applebees. I think what I didn't like about them was that they were a little more expensive than getting wings elsewhere ($9.50 for 10 wings) but they were TINY! One of my friends had a pizza, which looked delicious. If I went back I'd probably try something else. If you're craving wings, head elsewhere."
Tk G.,"Chandler, AZ",10,79,9,4.0,7/4/2009,"Went here, after we got a housewarming gift card from our realtor. Foor was surprisingly delish! We ordered, again, bruschetta and a deep dish pizza.  Had the beer sampler, since I'm not big on hops, this wasn't my thing, but they do make their own root beer, which is just as yummy! For desert we had oreo deep dish cookie, served w/ 3 scoops of vanilla ice cream and whipped cream (YUM). Only thing is, the waitress seem to ""forget"" something you asked for...1st time we went, they ""forgot"" my drink, 2nd time, I asked for ranch dressing and she ""forgot"", I had to ask another waiter... Go online to find a $5 coupon...its well worth it!"
Matt F.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,10,,4.0,10/14/2009,"This place has some great food. I haven't yet found anything on the menu that I don't like instantly. The pizza, the sandwiches, the appetizers, the desserts... all good. Despite this, my favorite item on the menu is definitely the Berry Burst Cider. I haven't yet found any other decent cider in the valley. Atmosphere: good Service: good My only beef: I did once have the jambalaya and that simply left me wanting authentic Cajun."
Jeff K.,"San Francisco, CA",25,108,8,4.0,5/9/2011,The Pizza rocks. I like the crust.
Jasmine C.,"Phoenix, AZ",175,853,,3.0,5/1/2008,Just not all that.  If I am eating at the Chandler Mall then there are 4 restaurants I would rather eat at.
Brian T.,"Phoenix, AZ",72,173,8,4.0,10/16/2008,Chandler Chamber of Commerce Event hosted by BJ's ... Food was really good!  There were probably over 100 of us at the event and the service was surprisingly good as well.
Lauren C.,"Tempe, AZ",144,2,,5.0,8/13/2011,"Enjoyed a night out with an old friend! Had some beer and potato skins and they were fantastic. I love the atmosphere, its warm-themed and and dimmed. Service was great :)"
Carina M.,"Seattle, WA",273,982,176,2.0,5/12/2008,"I am no stranger to BJs - I grew up in California, which is where this chain originated from. I'm not a fan of this BJs. We live about 10 minutes away from it, but I find we go to the one on Superstition Springs more often. We go to BJ's for the food, never the drinks. Hubby's a huge beer lover. When we lived in San Francisco, we used to do pub crawls with our friends in search of the perfect pint of Guinness. Anyway, we went to this BJs because he had heard good things about the beer here, more specificially, their brewmaster. He'd read rave reviews and thought, ""why not?  we're practically around the corner!"" Off we trotted and he ordered the beer and I ordered a salad...and he was angry.  Angry at beer. What?! Not again. It's ok.  I was angry at my salad and the slower service. He finally learned his lesson - never get the beer at BJs. The first BJs experience was back in California at the BJs in Cupertino, across the street from the Apple campus (yes, as in iPod). He and his best drinking mate, Matt, went for beer...one they ordered tasted like Juniper. The second one he ordered ""tasted like how sweaty gym socks smelled"". His exact words.  *gags a little* He thought it would be different at this BJs...but was sadly mistaken BJs on the whole will never have imported beer. If you want a decent selection of imported beer, I suggest going to Whole Foods -- you can pick up Belhaven! My salad pissed me off.  There was more dressing than salad. I wanted some lettuce with my dressing. Our server kept sneaking off - don't want to know what he was doing outside for long periods of time and come back smelling of smoke. My suggestion?  Seriously? Skip this BJs and go eat at one of the other restaurants. This one won't do it for beer...or food."
Jonathan S.,"Laveen, AZ",0,110,2,4.0,7/24/2011,All you California peeps out there stop in for a little taste of home. Great casual dining and microbrews.
