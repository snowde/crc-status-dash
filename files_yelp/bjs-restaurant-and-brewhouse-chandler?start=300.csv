joe i.,"Phoenix, AZ",32,93,,4.0,7/17/2007,"BJ's has some great beer, and the food is not bad either. I know it's a chain, but it does exceedingly well for a chain. Probably one of the best out there. The Jerimiah Red beer is excellent, as well as the Piranah something or other. If you go, try their thin crust appetizer pizza. But try it as a meal. It should be more than enough. If not, you can then fill up on beer."
Pam M.,"Gilbert, AZ",45,11,,4.0,10/23/2011,"I went to BJs for the first time for a dinner with some old co-workers.  I read the reviews before I went so I had an idea of some of the areas where I might have problems.  I am happy to say that my experience was a good  one.  It was a Sunday evening so that might have helped since it was not very crowded.  The weather was nice so our group of 5 sat on the  patio.  The service we received was very good.  He was attentive and funny.  Also was helpful deciding what to order from the enormous menu.  I had their Pumpkin Ale.  It was decent.  I liked it better than Blue Moon's Pumpkin Ale since I could actually taste hints of spices.  I will definitely try other varieties of their own brews when I return.  Two of the other girls in my group went for the root beer.  I tasted it and it was good but I'm not enough of an expert to say it was any different than A&W in a can.  The other two had mixed drinks and found them to be a bit pricey - $9 for a frozen mixed drink?  The table started with chips and salsa.  Nothing special there at all.  I would pass on that in the future.  I ended up having the steak salad and it was very good.  I liked the touch of the roasted potatoes.   All in all a good visit but the food is on the high side so I can't see myself going there often.  If they had a reverse happy hour like Gordon Biersch I could see myself going more, but due to the price I will save trips here for special treats or during their happy hour in the day."
Jessica L.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,2,,4.0,4/18/2013,"I've eaten at BJ's a few times before but when I went there for lunch a few days ago I was surprised at how much I enjoyed on of their lunch specials.  I ordered their parmesan crusted chicken sandwich and LOVED it.  This is not something that I would typically order and I was so pleasantly surprised.  Although the food was awesome, our server was less than average.  She seemed as though she would rather be anywhere besides waiting on our table and I really didn't appreciate it.  She didn't bring out any of our food and never checked up on us until we were done with our meal.  The restaurant was not busy at all so that wasn't an excuse.  Besides her poor attitude, I would totally recommend this place, especially that sandwich."
Beth F.,"Tempe, AZ",115,23,1,4.0,7/18/2010,"I went to BJ's for a group birthday celebration and overall had a good time. The grilled chicken potato was good as usual, as was the berry cider. Our service was a bit slow but the waitress was friendly and trying her best."
Tony N.,"Gilbert, AZ",30,29,,4.0,11/17/2010,"I eat here today. The service was good but not that I complain but we ask for four water and the waitress bring only three. Guess she is distracted. The food is good. I like it when my salad come with thousand island. Yes score! The nachos is okay with sauce but not with eating alone. I like mine salty. Otherwise, I don't have much complained."
Michael M.,"Farmingdale, NY",14,53,,5.0,10/1/2007,"This was my first BJ's experience and I fell in love. I have since been to many others and I love their beer.  But back to this one, the location is super sweet! Its a big reason I love this Brewery being next to the mall made it perfect. Let me explain... Ok so it was Christmas time and I went out to visit my sister and I still need to get some presents. So my sisters boyfriend took me to this mall and he said we need to stop here first. I was like well ok I guess, and man oh man am I glad we did. It made shopping so amazing (I hate to go shopping during this time period as should anyone) it quickly became my favorite way to shop... slightly drunk! :) So as amazing as the shopping experience was I was very glad to have had a chance to discover one of my favorite beers Tatonka Stout."
Ryanne F.,"Tempe, AZ",16,16,1,4.0,9/5/2010,"Very good food.  Good service, even when busy.  Their own microbrews.  What's not to like?"
derrick k.,"Chandler, AZ",1,35,,1.0,8/2/2010,"I know it's a chain restaurant. I know it's in a mall. I know i shouldn't expect more but, I do. I have gone to BJ's many times in California and had consistently good results. Last friday I took a friend and my nephew to eat here and were very disappointed. The service was bad, the food mediocre at best and the prices were no value. I can understand if it was busy and the wait staff was swamped. But when people are standing around and you still have to flag them down for everything from water to the check, inexcusable. Also I am not opposed to paying for food that worth it but, this BJ's I could not justify anything."
Greg L.,"Gilbert, AZ",51,35,3,4.0,3/19/2010,"This was my first time here, a fellow yelper recommended it.  We went during lunch time and I must say it was delicious.  I just followed my friends lead and we went with the huge sampler platter which was all full of goodies.  I don't remember the names of everything but the guacamole filled mini burrito things were so freakin good.  I then had the mini pulled pork sliders and loved em in fact my mouth is watering as I think about them right now.  Anyway great place for a lunch meeting."
Lilly W.,"Chandler, AZ",0,13,,1.0,6/10/2012,"We had guests visiting from California, so we decided to take them out to BJ's for dessert for their famous pizookie! What a horrible idea. Each one of us had it, and each one of us got sick. I mean sick like vomiting and diarrhea! Will never go back there again."
Keriann E.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,52,5,5.0,1/2/2012,"The food and beer here is the same as at any other BJ's location--consistently solid. The customer service at this location is excellent, however. My friend spilled her beer while trying to maneuver into the booth, and the manager not only replaced the beer, but found her a BJ's t-shirt in the back to wear home.  Totally above and beyond the call of duty."
Art R.,"Tempe, AZ",4,333,1,4.0,12/28/2011,"While I am not usually a fan of corporate restaurants and brewpubs, BJ's in Chandler is an exception to the rule. The beer is fresh as it is brewed on site and they usually have a couple of offerings that set them apart from the main street amber ale brewpub crowd. The best deal is the all you can eat soup and salad at lunch for around $8.00. Food is above average pub food and the pizzas are a ok. They also make root beer for the kids."
Cassandra R.,"Chandler, AZ",53,61,2,4.0,6/25/2008,The mini burgers here will be the death of me.
Logie Z.,"Tempe, AZ",377,439,145,3.0,10/2/2010,"I'm not a beer drinker...but my husband is!  So this review is for their food.  I know that this is a chain and it's the kind of food that you'd expect from a chain.  At least they are consistent with the quality.  They do have the best Cobb Salad that I've ever had.  It must have been the combination of the greens, bleu cheese, turkey, avocado, tomatoes and bacon.  Last night, my son wanted Pizza (A Friday night staple for the kid), so we ordered the Margherita Thin Crust Pizza.  I like an almost cracker crust, but this was way too thin and too crackery.  He ate two small slices.  I know he wants the more flaky bread kind of dough.  They do have a deep dish, but we're not into that either.    I ordered a Wedge Salad.  My brother-in-law asked what the hell it was and why I have half the iceberg on my plate.  I don't like iceberge lettuce, but this is almost embarrasing to admit that I do like this salad!   I know it doesn't have any nutritional value.  Heck, it has negative nutritional value.  My BIL and DH both had the Sourdough Burgers and they both truly enjoyed it.  It's this kinds of Pub food that you come in to this place for....and the beer, I guess."
Stephanie H.,"Surprise, AZ",23,26,19,4.0,2/15/2011,"My husband and I were looking for somewhere to eat around Chandler fashion center that gave a mall employee discount, and really no place does. But when we asked at BJ's the manager said he'd give us 10% just because we asked. Can't promise they'll do that everytime, but it was pretty cool and we decided to eat there. We got the fried artichokes and stuffed mushrooms as appetizers, which were very good. Then we split the calzone for two and promised ourselves we'd pace ourselves and take some home. But it was too good and we ended up finishing it. Our server was pleasant and attentive.  I have gone back roughly once a month and sit in the bar area killing time until my husband gets off work. The staff never minds and I usually have fun chatting with them on their slower nights. I prefer this location to the one at Park West in Peoria. The staff is much more friendly and apparently the location in Peoria does not have the same deals on Tuesdays."
erica k.,"Phoenix, AZ",66,2,,4.0,2/12/2008,"I like the beer, love their mixed drinks, and the food and location are great as well.  Try their roast beef dip w/ fries!"
Molly S.,"Mesa, AZ",6,44,,3.0,12/24/2010,good beer selection...tried them all!  food menu is a wide as can be...a couple great salads I always get like the italian chopped (which the just changed...bummer) and the french fries are awesome.  the soup and salad endless combo at lunch is a winner
Holly T.,"Philadelphia, PA",388,698,1217,4.0,7/9/2006,"I've been to about 5 different BJs and this is by far my favorite. The food is the same as at most other BJs, although this one has honey breadsticks that I haven't seen anywhere else. What distinguishes this BJs is the brewer. In addition to the usual BJs brews, this brewer concocts new original brews all the time, found only here, and brewed on premises. One time I had a BJs Belgian style Grand Cru here that rocked my world. The only problem is that it's super crowded and there is usually a wait. Plus it's at the Chandler mall, so it's...mall-ish."
Joe M.,"Chandler, AZ",0,11,,2.0,12/12/2008,"The brew is ok I have had better, and the pizza is ok, nothing crazy good and the atmosphere is alright, I'd rather go somewhere else any day."
dave s.,"Chandler, AZ",82,44,9,5.0,4/20/2007,"One of my favorite places to go for a nice meal and a beer.  I usually order their Chicken Salad and Jeremiah Red beer.  After a couple beers, the restaurant is within stumbling distance of the Chandler 24 Movie theater."
