Stacy L.,"Palo Alto, CA",29,171,,4.0,1/5/2007,"Good selection of beers, really nice assortment of menu items, and big group friendly.  I had a few too many beers to recall much other than a happy feeling about the place, especially since my jambalaya dish was tasty.  And they had avocado egg rolls that I really liked, that was while I was still on my first beer."
Amanda T.,"Tempe, AZ",0,5,,4.0,12/8/2011,I give this place 3.5 stars. The decor and space was amazing..very spacious  and very nice design.  The staff was friendly- but our server was a little flighty- I don't think she had been working there very long as she wasn't very familiar with the menu and had to ask us what the menu said. I am a restaurant manager and I would never put someone on the floor who wasn't familiar with the menu- it looks bad on the serve and on management. We ordered 2 ribeye dinners and 1 chili cheeseburger. My brother requested his steak to be rare and when it came to our table it was more on the well side and when he asked  to have it sent back and cooked the way he wanted the man- who I am assuming was the manager- acted like it was a hassle. My steak was slightly overdone but still edible and tasty. My husbands chili cheeseburger was amazing! The chili was very tasty and it was a huge meal! He left very satisfied! One thing I absolutely loved was the horseradish mashed potatoes- they were amazing! I had never had horseradish m.potatoes but I am glad I tried them- I even started making some at home.  The  mixed drinks were amazing too!  My brother ordered a glass of their dark beer and he loved it- he has always loved dark beers and this beer was right up his alley. Oh! Almost forgot- we also ordered the mini bruschetta for our appetizer- and WOW! I could have eaten 5 plates of that stuff - the best bruschetta I have ever had! Overall this place was really good! The food tasted amazing- I am glad because they are kind of pricey but no complaints on the price because it was worth it :)
