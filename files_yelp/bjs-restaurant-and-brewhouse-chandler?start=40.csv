Leslie B.,"Chandler, AZ",50,156,355,5.0,3/16/2015,"We came here on a Saturday around 5 pm . This was our first time here , and it was a very happy find ! We were seated immediately , and had drinks served right away. I tried the very berry cider (very refreshing) for dinner I had the fried fish and wedge cut seasoned fries . It was served steaming hot & fresh . My bf ordered the turkey club and wedge cut seasoned fries . He was thrilled with his dinner as well. We will  Definitely be back"
Grant C.,"Tempe, AZ",39,71,61,4.0,10/4/2016,This was the first time here that was not a 5 star review.  Came here with my family and my sister does not eat chicken.  It was my fathers birthday.  All started well.  But we orders drinks and I orders a AMF it came out looked amazing. Normally I love amf's. but this one tasted like well tequila. It was horrible.  Only had about 3/8ths.  Enjoyed some wine and our food came.  It was amazing tell my sisters order came out.   She told the waitress clearly no no chicken.  She only eats seafood.  So she orders a shrimp salad. And got a chicken salad.    We had to complain 2 times. Normally love eating here.  They have us 2 free deserts for our large table.  That's what saved the rating.  It would have been a 2 star.    We will be back again
Andy B.,"Cypress, TX",0,21,,2.0,4/17/2017,"Monday at 8:30 pm.....why is service terrible? Place isn't crowded, yet I gotta get up from the table to chase down the waiter for another beer.  Not being total hater, food was pretty good.  Really liked the thin crust pizza."
Bruno S.,"Maricopa, AZ",111,85,118,5.0,3/12/2016,"My wife and I went for the first time with a couple friends. Our friends raved the food at B.J.s. My wife had the pulled pork and I had the Jumbalaya. Both were absolutely amazing! We also shared a bowl of some of the best broccoli cheese soup around. The service was great. The wait was quick. The most overwhelming part of the visit was choosing what to eat with an array of options. I am definitely looking forward to taking my children or any family that might visit from out of state. UPDATE: Went here for a second time. The service was great. Most of the food was good. AVOID the boneless wings. Unfortunately they are not that great..for as much good food they have here,boneless wings are a no go."
Enriqueta Q.,"Chandler, AZ",0,4,,5.0,10/2/2016,Manager Shilo and server Dominic you guys are amazing. Last night was our first time ever there and you took care of us. Shilo thank you for taking the time to congratulate my son on his accomplishments. You will see the Quintero's soon! Muchas gracias
Beth L.,"Mesa, AZ",45,91,388,4.0,8/17/2015,"I dined here after work today, Monday. Not crowded but still a good number of people in here. This place is huge. Open and clean. Large out door seating.  We were seated promptly and our waiter took our drink order right away.  While our waiter got our food and drinks timely,  he just didn't give the welcoming feeling.  I ordered the Parmesan chicken, mash potatoes and broccoli.  I thought the side salad came with the dinner but it doesn't. Charged $3.50 for it. I'm used to getting a dinner salad with my entre at other places, so I was surprised this wasn't included.  Daughter ordered the chicken and avocado flat bread pizza.  She said the sauce was a little spicy and she picked off the avocados.  The food was cooked well and had plenty of flavor. BJ's had a large menu. From tacos,  burgers, pizza to steaks and pasta.  Something for everyone."
Emily G.,"Lordsburg, NM",2,6,,5.0,5/8/2016,"If you ever want to have your tits blown clean off because of excellent food and even better service, look no further than this BJ's.  I came in with 12 people about two hours till closing time and expected the staff to be a bit salty, but they were anything but. Our waitress came in clutch and scored us a nice spot that accommodated everyone - she was super friendly.  Next, David (who I assume is the manager) came in and swept us away. He greeted us in a warm manner and made us feel very welcome. Our appetizers came out quickly and were fuckin' excellent. I swear those mozzarella sticks multiply when you're not looking. The potato skins were amazing, too. We never had to ask for our drinks to be refilled, never had to check if our order was put in correctly, never had to complain - everything was wonderful. When it came time to split the check, things got kind of hairy because we wanted to split one giant ass pizzookie twelve ways - but David was like ""I got you, fam,"" and split that shit up like it was no one's damn business. He was such a sweetheart. The guy taking our cards at the end was hilarious and had a wonderful sense of humor.  Squad will definitely be coming here again. 10/10 would recommend"
Margo L.,"Tempe, AZ",121,28,1,2.0,7/29/2017,"This was my third visit to this location and my boyfriend and I were dissatisfied to say the least. This time around my deep dish pizza came out on a plate, not in the pan, and the bottom was completely mutilated. Once again I was brought nothing to separate the pizza so my fork and butter knife had to suffice. We ordered a pizookie trio, and they brought out the wrong flavor. I told our waiter, (who was awesome by the way) and he brought out another one right away. Which yet again was the incorrect flavor. The manager on duty came by our table to ask about our experience and I told her what happened. She proceeded to attempt to argue with me about what flavor the second pizookie was then quickly walked away and came back with our check. They ended up comping our meal because they goofed up. The first time we came to this location we had a similar experience. Awesome server yet again, but the kitchen staff just couldn't get it right. The food runners brought our food to the wrong table both times, and failed to bring anything to but the pizza with. The first time around we waited an extremely long time for our food to arrive and the restaurant was completely dead. On all three occasions we came it seemed like our servers were the only ones doing anything. The food runners and bus boys stood around gossiping and twiddling their thumbs. Not impressed at all."
Mary W.,"Mesa, AZ",0,13,,5.0,8/10/2017,"My sister and her husband asked us to meet them at BJ's. We had never been there,so, we didn't know what to expect.What a pleasant surprise!Our server was wonderful.She was very attentive without being intrusive.The food was fantastic and the portions were huge.We all had a cocktail and they were mixed to perfection.We had such a great time and We look forward to visiting BJ's again soon."
James L.,"Chandler, AZ",2,53,80,5.0,11/7/2015,"August gave us a great experience here. Really superb  person, asked us a lot of questions and after a few samples we made some great beer choices. Very friendly and great BJ's staff.  The food is wonderful here and really a slick efficient place. We highly recommend , Tracy is serving us tonight, I think we're going on 14 years of her serving us, first class bartender!"
Lyn P.,"Chandler, AZ",52,42,10,3.0,12/27/2016,The food was just okay. Service was good. Meals were overpriced and the quality wasn't that great. I'm glad I tried it but I wouldn't go back and probably would not recommend coming here to anyone. Upscale Applebee's type place. I would only go for drinks.
Keith J.,"Gilbert, AZ",59,68,12,5.0,4/30/2016,"I was craving the chicken parmigiana, which evidently had been taken off of the menu for some unknown reason. I asked the waiter about it and they made it anyway. It was awesome. We also had the gluten free pizza which is evidently one of the best around. Even a gluten free pizookie, which was amazing! Very busy, but they do take call a heads with parties of six or less. Conveniently placed sports so that you can converse and not miss the action. A great experience. Thanks, BJ's!"
Mike C.,"El Paso, TX",9,399,118,4.0,4/19/2016,"I really enjoyed my visit and meal at BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse.  Service was definitely excellent, and the food tasted great.  I tried one of their blonde beers, and was delighted with the taste.  I did notice my mouth was really dry about an hour after eating, so I kinda think they must use flavor enhancers like MSG.  MSG doesn't sit well with me - makes me tired and thirsty.  I also had a glass of tea which was very strong and nice to drink.  They offer various flavors of tea, but I just had mine ""plain"".  Definitely worth a visit!"
Jamie A.,"Reno, NV",27,24,25,3.0,5/28/2017,"Bjs.. well where do I begin. Food has always been so so.. nothing amazing. I come here because its convenient but truly nothin to brag about. One thing I dislike is the fact that all customers expect to wait at Bjs.. its different if you wait and you get 5 star service and food is amazing... but all it you get is Okay. You wait to get seated and you wait a long time to get food, even just appetizers.. when its busy youre lucky if you get your glass refilled with water without having to ask couple of times. This could be a good place... could be."
Shazz S.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,26,1,5.0,11/25/2016,This is a favorite place for my wife and I. The service and food are always very good. The desert is very good also. We have been here quite a few times and have never been disappointed. Make sure to try the lemon pepper wings and the thin crust pizza.
Nancy M.,"Chandler, AZ",22,463,730,3.0,3/18/2016,"Let me start by saying that Jeff, our server, is what saved this review from being a 1.  I was sorely disappointed by the hostess that greeted us. She was flippant and unprofessional- not a great representation of what I'm sure BJ's would expect your experience to be upon entering their restaurant.   Fast forward to being seated (after a 10-minute wait that the hostess said would be a 25-minute wait).  Jeff promptly arrived, introduced himself and took awesome care of us from beginning to end.  So he gets 5-stars, hands down!"
Danielle L.,"Phoenix, AZ",153,69,41,2.0,1/14/2015,"S'more Pizzokie, Nuff Said!  I mean.. I wish that was all there was to say. I'm lucky to have friends that love dessert, so we met there late night with a purpose. And that was to devour these delicious cookies we'd heard so many delightful things about. Delightful they were (albeit a bit smaller compared to others) but they were indeed delicious. The problem, however, had everything to do with our experience outside of dessert.  The service was slow, and minimal at best. We waited quite a while to get seated in a nearly empty restaurant, only to eventually seat ourselves. We then waited some more before somebody finally took notice to help us. And then waited some more (a ton more) for them to take our order and eventually bring our food. We realized that during the wait happy hour had kicked in, so we ordered a few more things. BIG mistake. Big wait for a big let down. Just an underwhelming experience all around, and our server was grumpy to boot. Not happy that I recommended this place, and it's highly unlikely that I ever would again."
Vanessa G.,"Phoenix, AZ",60,33,,5.0,10/18/2016,"UPDATE: Not even 24 hours after my previous review, the manager for this particular BJ's eached out to me via phone and asked me about my experience. As a courtesy, they provided me with a gift card for my next visit in lieu of the not-so-great previous experience.  I honestly did not expect them to even care enough to read through their reviews and make contact either. This is a clear sign of business that knows what it is doing and knows how to handle themselves. I have always loved BJ's and will continue to visit in the future! Great food and even better staff!"
Jayde L.,"Chandler, AZ",27,30,3,3.0,10/20/2016,"I love the Nutty Brewnette, it's a great beer. The food is pretty decent, but not always amazing. I have good food and I've had OK food. If you're in the area it's worth a try."
Erin L.,"Chandler, AZ",138,45,66,3.0,3/5/2016,Came in on a Wednesday night with my boyfriend not busy at all in the place. Service was okay nothing spectacular server seemed like he had better places to be than serving us. We shared the baked ziti because we were catching a movie after. The dish was very yummy we were quite impressed. Then ordered the pizza cookie with the chocolate chip and peanut butter it was okay much much better at oreganos and you get a lot more of it. The dish is very shallow and he amount of ice cream outweighs how much cookie you actually get. I might come back for happy hour sometime to try that out.
