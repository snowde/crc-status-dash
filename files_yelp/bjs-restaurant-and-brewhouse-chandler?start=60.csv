Sandie I.,"Fontana, CA",93,3,,1.0,8/3/2016,"So we went in the other day for lunch, we waited 10-15 minutes before our waitress came to the table for our drink order so we ordered our drinks and avocado egg rolls, then about 10 min later we ordered our food, 45 minutes later she stopped by to bring refills and brought the wrong drinks and said our food should be here soon. She went to the register and looks like she put in our order then 20 more minutes then our food came but was wrong. Then she took $5 off our bill really I don't need a discount maybe you should pay attention to your customers, I mean there weren't that may people in the restaurant and most of the servers were just standing around."
Kathy M.,"Chandler, AZ",17,5,,5.0,10/3/2016,Something for everyone. Great staff. Awesome environment to watch sports. Have held a few large gatherings for family here and wouldn't go anywhere else.  Always a go to place for out of town visors. Been a coming here for 7 yrs and never get tired of it. Continuously updating the menu with new cuisine. They offer gluten free and vegan fare. Microbews are amazing. Have been to BJ in other states but love this one the best.
Becky H.,"Chandler, AZ",0,3,,1.0,5/29/2017,"We went there on a Sunday afternoon, it was not busy, the hostess immediately sat us. Despite the restaurant having numerous open tables she sat us directly next to another couple. And then we sat there and after 10 minutes without even waters or a server stopping by to say they would be with us soon we left. Completely unacceptable"
Daniel B.,"Gilbert, AZ",39,7,,5.0,10/21/2016,"It's slightly upscale, but not enough for it to be a turn off if you're just out an about."
Dan F.,"Chandler, AZ",0,5,,5.0,10/8/2016,"Our family went to BJ's restaurant recently,  It was a great experience.  The food was very tasty.  The kid meals food and portion size was also great.  They have a new expanded menu with new offerings and now offer gluten-free buns for their hamburgers.  The waitress was great, but the highlight was when the manager, David, came over to help us with the new BJ's app.  We had trouble logging in  and the manager took the time to help us and then when we still could not log-in, he offered to give our contact information to his tech guru at headquarters.  David was very personable and you could tell by talking to him that he took a lot of pride in his restaurant and was very loyal to the company. We finished off our meal with a delicious gluten-free pizzookie, which the whole family enjoyed."
Valerie W.,"Phoenix, AZ",212,23,1,5.0,9/21/2016,"Our server, Kevin, was great! Christy, although not our server, was super attentive and friendly! Highly recommend them as waiters"
TJ H.,"Chandler, AZ",652,242,348,3.0,8/29/2015,"C's school was having a family dinner night fundraiser. Since BJ's is just outside of the mall near the theater, parking can be a pain. Luckily C & I found parking within a few passes. BJ's is a large restaurant with a menu that offers something for everyone. We had a short wait to be seated, maybe 10 minutes.  Our server didn't introduce himself. He brought drink refills when needed but was absent most of the meal. C ordered the kids 6"" deep dish pizza. Fruit salad as a side. Our server informed us that the pizza did not come with a side like the other kid's meals. C likes fruit so I said fine, add on the side of fruit. C liked his pizza but not the chunks of tomatoes that were all over it. I ate them. C said the crust was a bit sweet, like Old Chicago's, but it was an ok mini pie. The fruit bowl was a joke. Cubed watermelon with 3 grapes. Pathetic. I ordered the Bacon-Guacamole Deluxe; Guacamole, Smoked Bacon, Pepper Jack Cheese, Chipotle Mayo, Red Onions, Jalapenos & Tomatoes. The burger was cooked right. The chipotle mayo was pretty lame. Not a whole lot of flavor. Overall, it was a decent burger and the side of fries were quite tasty. OK service, lousy fruit side, decent burger & fries, not a very attentive server. 3 Stars"
Mike M.,"Tempe, AZ",55,39,7,4.0,5/24/2015,"It's a good place. The food was pretty decent but the soup my wife got was luke warm and pretty boring. I had the spicy pig flatbread which was really good but even the waiter admitted the jalapeños were out of a can and lacked some heat. Their beer was excellent. I had their IPA and their Double IPA which were stronger IPAs that are the best local IPAs I've had.  So yes, I'd say go and try this place out. The menu is extensive and there is something for everyone."
Loving Life A.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,15,,5.0,10/16/2016,"Big fan of the food and service. I frequent about every month or so over the years. Have never had any problems. These days I attend with the family - 2 kids, 2 parents and 2 grandparents."
Han L.,"Chandler, AZ",15,57,225,3.0,10/26/2015,"I think BJ's is a Cheese Cake Factory wanna be but the food (quality & portion) is just no comparison to Cheese Cake Factory which is also by Chandler Fashion mall. So I say unless you are there for the happy hours or 9 dollars specialty drink. For the best of both world, go to Cheese Cake factory!"
Bill B.,"Chandler, AZ",577,20,11,5.0,9/19/2016,"I cant say enough good things about the BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse in Chandler, our favorite restaurant!! We are on a first name basis with David the manager who is always friendly and visible. The man works hard as we see him during practically every visit. During our most recent visit we met server Crystal and had a marvelous experience with her. She was attentive, engaging and very funny. She completed yet another wonderful dining experience! The food is consistently delicious no matter what you order from their extensive menu. They also offer different/new in-house micro-brews throughout the year. Its always a treat trying their latest concoction! Last, if you have not attended one of BJ's ""Beer Dinners"" you really need to make it a point to do so. During the beer dinners you are served a variety of BJ's delicious foods, usually 4 courses, accompanied by a beer selected to compliment the chosen food and of course, your palate. Again, BJ's in Chandler is by far our favorite go-to place to eat where we visit monthly!"
Miss R.,"Scottsdale, AZ",78,48,1,2.0,7/31/2015,"I shy away from negative reviews as much as possible but this place has been a disappointment on more than 1 occasion. I'm giving 2 stars and if the service wasn't so terrible I'd give more because the food is good.  1st time I went I was greeted and sat by hostess (on the patio). A server never came out for at least 10 minutes. This is unacceptable in the middle of summer in AZ. Water should have been brought by a server or hostess. The service from there continued to be so. Un-attentive to say the least. I mentioned to what I thought was management and a mere apology was given.  Gave another chance yesterday. Server took order without writing anything down. Of course when we got our food, the order was wrong. When we addressed her, she attempted to blame my sister. We were never checked on the entire time. Our waters continued to stay empty. I was at least smart enough to sit inside this time. She seemed very attentive to her to other tables and it was mid day on a Thursday, so not a busy time at all. When she finally did check on us, I just said we were ready for our check. She handed it right over. It was the only one in her apron. What if we were going to order more. Just seemed like she was in a hurry to get us out of there. I'm huge on customer service, as much as I like good food, I pay a premium when going out to have good service and this place just doesn't fit the mold...unfortunately."
Omari D.,"Tempe, AZ",76,181,258,4.0,8/30/2015,"Undecided as usual for lunch so when in doubt, a chain restaurant with lots of variety helps me. Like Cheesecake Factory, a lot of menu items which can be overwhelming. Had a great server to help me navigate and provided some good conversation as I was solo! Location and menu items suited for a large or small group and accommodating."
Jackie B.,"Gilbert, AZ",60,11,7,4.0,9/4/2016,"This has got to be our favorite restaurant, bar none. The food is always top notch, we have never ordered something that we did not like here and that is the truth! The choice of micro brews is outstanding and the service is beyond compare. Crystal was our waitress tonight and she is one of the best! She was quick, efficient and extremely personable. She joked with us, made us laugh and was very non intrusive throughout the meal. She truly made the meal even better! You are so lucky to have her as part of your staff!! Thank you Crystal for your incredible personality! You are a jewel!! Good luck with your fantasy football!! We had the full rack of ribs with the root beer glaze with white cheddar mashed potatoes....perfection!! However, the only downside to our wonderful dining experience was your hostess staff. We entered the restaurant and waited for almost a minute before Tyler even looked up and acknowledged us. Really? You don't even make eye contact with someone who comes in the door 6 feet away from you? I find that totally unacceptable. We were seated near the entrance and I had a perfect view of Bailey and Tyler as they seated people and dealt with those patrons who were leaving. Not once did they say goodbye to departing guests. They were too busy chatting with one another. Being in the customer service industry, I find this behavior and actions completely unacceptable. Those two, Bailey and Tyler, certainly make it easy to decide not to come back. Watch who you place as ambassadors to your fine establishment....."
Chuck T.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,12,8,1.0,4/30/2016,"Walked in got a quick soup and salad before a movie. After about 25 minutes server told us "" food should be out soon. We are down a cook"".  Really?! It takes a cook to get a house salad and soup? We decided to walk out. 25 minutes just seems like a long time for a soup and salad."
Jamie B.,"Chandler, AZ",296,404,726,4.0,8/30/2015,I love this place but don't come here enough.  There are lots of options that everyone can find something that they like on the menu.  Next time I will have to remember to use their app to get on the list to avoid the wait.
Ellen B.,"Denver, CO",111,24,33,4.0,10/7/2015,Came here the other night for the first time for dinner and loved it! The menu is very extensive- there's something for everyone. We shared the Mediterranean Tacos as an appetizer and loved them! My boyfriend had the Hawaiian Mahi Mahi and it was great. Perfect dinner spot if you're heading to Chandler Fashion Center. We will be back!
Diane B.,"Hartland, WI",0,8,,5.0,3/14/2017,"Our waitress helped make it a 5. We've always liked the food and friendly service, however Melani took it to the next level! Her smile and perkiness, attention to her customers needs and personality can't be beat. As I stated, the food has always been good."
Tristan M.,"Casa Grande, AZ",14,3,,4.0,9/6/2016,"My wife and I were looking for something different than the usual food court fare and we found it here. My first impression was that the place was clean and well kept. It had a nice atmosphere too. The wait staff was professional, friendly and quick to refill empty beverages and waters. The food was good, not out of this world but good. To put it another way I wouldn't tell someone they had to go out of their way to try it but if they're in the area and were looking for a decent place to eat I would definitely recommend it. My wife had the avocado bacon and cheese sandwich. She enjoyed it I tried a bite myself and thought it was good too. I ordered the black and blue burger. The flavor was good and the portions were exactly what you'd expect at a place like that. All in all a great experience and a great place to check out if you're in the area."
Jim N.,"Gilbert, AZ",170,11,1,1.0,4/13/2016,"Very good food but very poor service. Not the first time we have had poor service here. This time, it was the worst service we have ever had. We had a table of 5 people starting around 5 PM for a birthday celebration and the restaurant was not busy.  I'm assuming that the server Alysha P, was having a bad day. She was very short and almost rude to each in the group. We had to ask her multiple time for more cocktails, water and such. We even waited for a couple of minutes to get silverware napkins and condiments after our food was brought to the table. Nothing was a priority to her. Four of us are self-employed business owners and the 5th person is a restaurant manager. None of us could believe that management has re-trained her or let her on her way out the door.  Hopefully better luck nex time."
