Sage E.,"Tempe, AZ",97,7,1,1.0,5/18/2016,"I went here last night and my experience was awful. My server was inattentive my pizza did not have the items I requested and upon request my server just laughed it off and said ""oops this was my fault I'll throw artichokes on the side"" I said no thanks. Then he never refilled my beverage I was without a beerage through my entire main course. The balsamic chicken said it was a chicken breast and it was not the breast also the potatoes honestly taste like they were box mashed potatoes with cheese on them. My server honestly ruined the experience he brushed off every concern I had and it was annoying. We got our  check 15 minutes a free we finished. We were waiting on him, not vice versa. Will never ever go again."
Bobbe H.,"Chandler, AZ",16,50,27,4.0,12/23/2015,Fun place to have lunch or dinner. Great for sports watching. Lots of food choices and great choice of beers.
Jeannie C.,"Phoenix, AZ",189,14,30,1.0,5/6/2015,"One of the WORST EXPERIENCES EVER.  1. Ordered the cajun pasta but the flavor did not taste Cajun. I had it once before and it was very good. It took a while but I was finally able to wave down the waitress and asked her if there was any way to make it more ""Cajuny"". It came back smelling like dirty sink water & it tasted like straight up salt along with a hint of the dirty sink water, making it completely inedible.  2. My boyfriend asked for extra toasted buns on his crispy jalapeño burger and it came out very soft and un-toasted.. Their excuse for that was that they toasted the underside of the buns more than usual.. what kind of logic is that? The underside of the bun just gets soggy anyway because of the sauce so isn't it obvious if someone stresses the fact that they need the buns extra toasted they would do both sides of the buns? 3. We were unable to get even one refill due to the extremely long absences of the waitress and my boyfriend even yelled for her when she was 3 feet away and she still wouldn't turn around... and the restaurant wasn't even loud, the table next to where our waitress was standing even looked at my boyfriend because he was calling for her. The experience was more of a hassle than anything. For the hour we spent at here, 30 minutes was spent looking around waiting for the waitress to bring us the check and togo boxes. After the 15 minutes past of waiting for the check my boyfriend kept urging me to walk out on the check with him because he felt like they didn't deserve our money but I waited another 15 minutes to pay for this horrible experience... Since when did it take 30 minutes to get a check and togo boxes?  Worst of all, it was an extremely slow night, slow enough to see plenty of waiters sitting around and talking for 20 mins. Luckily our waitress took the pasta off of our check so we didn't have to pay for the extremely salty, dirty, sink water flavored pasta. Now that I think about it, I should've listened to my boyfriend. This experience, along with 1 burger and 2 appetizers was not at all worth $27. No wonder they call themselves BJ's cuz this place BLOWS!"
Toryanni E.,"Hoofddorp, The Netherlands",88,340,392,4.0,6/29/2013,"I tried 2 of the new bbq menu items this time around and I was not disappointed.  The Corn Fritters with the bacon aioli (which I posted a picture of) were super delicious and only $2.95, I was sad that I had to share...The Jallejulah fries (also pictured) where good too, not as spicy as I would have liked but it was definitely a unique taste. I had the grilled Mahi Mahi Mahi tacos (guess what? there's also a picture of these!) off the lunch menu and they were quite good.  The tacos came with chips and a small dish of salsa and guacamole.  Not a big fan of the guacamole, it was too soupy for my taste. My friend had chicken tenders they looked good but I didn't try them. The lunch and happy hour prices are really good.  I love going for happy hour and having the mini pizzas.  Plus I'm a rewards member, so I get points for eating there."
Chris P.,"Gilbert, AZ",131,358,51,4.0,7/24/2015,"I dig their pizza and root beer. I do the pepperoni and mushroom with basil tomatoes on top. The root beer is good and House made. Always a good choice even late at night. The staff is not as friendly later, but still a good choice. Give this place a shot."
Emily M.,"Chandler, AZ",0,6,,2.0,11/4/2016,"Had a large party celebrating two birthdays and made a reservation a few days ahead of time with a manager. Called in again to extend my party number and a different manager said I wasn't even put down for a reservation. I'm glad I called or else my party and I would've shown up with no table. When we arrived, we had to wait 25 min even though it was late night on a weekday (it was not busy). During our meal, we were checked on once which is unfortunate because I drink a lot of water and need refills semi-frequently. None of this bothered me until two of my guests had to leave early so they got their check, left cash on the table, and left. Our waitress Laura threw a little fit about how much they did or did not tip. Even though the rest of us tipped normally, her attitude made us all reflect on whether we wanted to tip well or not. She proceeded to drop our cards down on the table for us to go through since she was annoyed. We wanted to put in an additional desert order to make her some more money and she was annoyed because she had already taken an order for us. She forgot to grab my card I was holding up so she was annoyed that she had to come back for it but I mean I don't have to pay if you don't want me to right? In the end, we had to talk to a manager about what is appropriate behavior and conversation to be having in front of customers."
Chris W.,"Chandler, AZ",0,5,,1.0,2/27/2016,The food was good (even though my order was wrong) but the waitress got a group of employees and started looking at my party and started laughing at all of us. she didn't even say she was sorry to any of us tonight. not eating here again because I don't like being laughed at.
Robert L.,"Omaha, NE",102,138,961,3.0,7/15/2015,"I've been here before. It's clean, the prices are decent. Great beer and liquor selection- lots of cocktails. Pretty diverse menu but stick with the pub grub. Service was great last night and we had a big group. Downside, beers a little warm and I tired a steak for the first time. Don't bother. Yes, dear, I ate the asparagus and it was quite good- but the fries looked better. All in all, ik place to go but don't stray too far from the traditional menu."
Shigeru Y.,"Phoenix, AZ",3,260,55,1.0,2/21/2016,"There were a massive number of empty tables both inside and on the patio, yet we were told there would be an hour wait.  The hostess claimed that she didn't have enough servers to seat anyone.  We took our business elsewhere."
K C.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,32,37,4.0,6/19/2016,"Our server was great  Our food was super slow.  Appetizers took an hour but we are a big party we were patiently waiting  We had a problem with one of the plates and the manager came out to spoon out plate to make sure what we said was missing wasn't on the plate  He mentioned how weird it was when he had just had it and didn't have a problem.  I have neverrrrr seen anyone do anything like that. That was so disrespectful, rude, tasteless and no customer service at ALL!  Were we treated this way because we are minorities?  Not sure but felt so disrespected.  We will make sure not to ever come back to another BJ's again.   UPDATE BJS IN LAS VEGAS May 2016 We received a gift card from bjs and decided to give it another try.  It was great. The waitress was super nice. This time around it was inly two of us vs 15.   Our food dis take for ever to come but it wasnt bad. My pizza was not very hot but it wasnt bad.  My husbands food was good along with the dessert he got."
Kendra K.,"Chandler, AZ",49,10,,5.0,7/18/2016,Food is always great- got my first free pizookie from the new membership- and if you play Pokemon go- they got stops- great service as always.
Jason D.,"Gilbert, AZ",37,47,7,5.0,9/13/2015,"My fiance and I met a friend for a birthday party a few days ago, along with 16 other people.  It was my first time visiting this location, or any other one for that matter.  The one thing I was impressed by is that with the amount of people that were there, it wasn't as noisy as I thought it going to be.  Yes, you did have to raise your voice a bit, but it wasn't to the level of shouting, which is a definite plus.  Perhaps it's the high ceilings.  Anyway, my fiance and I opted for the appetizer (mozzarella sticks - you really can't go wrong with those) - they were good, but it's the marinara sauce they give you that make them even better!  My fiance ordered the bison burger, which I had a bite of and thought it was delicious.  My dish, the parmesan crusted chicken, was also quite tasty.  I love the sauce they put on it with the sun-dried tomatoes.   The reason I'm giving this location five stars is simple:   the service.  Our server, Joanna, was amazing.  She was very attentive, but not overly annoying.  After everyone got their food, my dish still hadn't arrived.  She went back to check on it, and apparently, my dish went to another table by mistake, so she had the kitchen rush my dish out and even had the meal compensated without hesitation (I didn't even ask for it).  She was very apologetic and sincere about it, which is rare these days.  There should be more servers like her.  We will definitely be coming back here again."
Keisha T.,"Phoenix, AZ",17,7,5,4.0,3/23/2016,"This is one of the few places open til midnight in Chandler. We love that. The food was really good and the blood orange sangria is to die for. The service could be better, but it just seemed like they didn't ha e enough staff."
Sed F.,"Phoenix, AZ",3,78,47,5.0,8/8/2015,"Very prompt service during happy hour on a busy Friday. My waitress Alysha was super attentive and polite even though she was working a party of over 15 next to me. I went especially for the seasonal Summer ""Watermelon Mojito"" and I ordered a Jalapeño turkey burger. Everything was delicious!"
Kyle H.,"Casa Grande, AZ",57,30,63,5.0,5/16/2016,"I really enjoy coming here  after walking  around  the  mall and having a beer and a bison  burger this place is really  done right good food and the beer is really  good, The ale is better  than pretty much all beer place's  around here."
Doug T.,"Scottsdale, AZ",724,324,1083,4.0,12/4/2013,"I came here with my co-workers for a team lunch. We do this every quarter and decided come here cause they can handle large parties and they have a big variety menu.  When we got here our table was already setup and once we sat down our server was really quick to provide us with our drinks. I ordered the California Burger. I thought that this was really good. Bursting with flavor. The burger was on a grilled sourdough bread with avocado, green chilies, pepper jack cheese, chipotle mayo, and ranch. Burger was very moist and perfect. It came with shoestring fries. Half the plate was filled with fries. It was a huge lunch meal but really worth it.  As for the service, our server was always checking on us. Refilling our drinks and clearing the empty plates. We even had the manager come by to make sure everything was okay. It seemed like they really cared for us.  So overall, I would say that we had a really enjoyable time. We had a table over 10 people and the service and food came out in a reasonable time. The only regret was that I didn't order their Pizookie. Those are so good. Enjoy..."
Chris E.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,8,,1.0,6/18/2016,I have been to BJ's about five times....I have ordered the ceaser salad each time with the dressing on the side....EACH AND EVERY TIME THESE IDIOTS DROWN MY SALAD IN DRESSING!!!!!!!!!  I am done!!!!! I will never go back to BJ's!!!!!!! Obviously the waiters can't listen to simple requests!!!!!!!!
Tammi L.,"Cortez, CO",0,6,,5.0,5/9/2016,"This place has phenomenol service! The beer and food is pretty darn good too (we had the new Orleans jambalaya & the cherry Chipotle smoked salmon). But I am leaving this review mostly because I was so blown away by the customer service.... from the hostess, the server, the manager and even the bus boy! Everyone was incredibly kind and went out of their way to accommodate us in having a pleasant experience. Well done guys, THANK YOU!!!"
B P.,"Peoria, AZ",0,13,,5.0,11/7/2015,"So it's been a long time since my wife and I were blown away with a restaurant.  First, there was a 20 minute wait for a 2-top in an almost empty place. Our hostess said there were ""a few... problems with staffing."" Her pause, not mine. Our waitress Madeline looked frazzled but she took good care of us and the rest of the section as it filled up around us.  The food was great. The service was great. And we couldn't have asked for a better time. If the management reads these posts, I urge you not to whip the horses that work..."
Bill G.,"Chandler, AZ",12,16,,3.0,4/1/2015,"This will likely be our last visit. While we've been generally pleased to this point with both the food and the service (which can often be hit or miss), I simply cannot understand the constant and unnecessary meddling with items on the menu that have long been staples. You removed the Italian chop salad for an Asian one? Why?  The only redeeming thing about BJ's is their craft brewed beers and they're not all too special. So very, very disapponting, guys... but I guess it's to be expected when you're a corporate chain that has little interest in what's good in YOUR location versus what's good in an entirely different state."
