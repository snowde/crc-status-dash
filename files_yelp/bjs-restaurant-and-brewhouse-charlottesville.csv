Howard S.,"Chicago, IL",1,107,,3.0,12/27/2017,"Every review here is absolutely true.  In general the food is good, the staff is friendly but lazy and inattentive, the place is clean, the drinks are good and the prices run from a little high but reasonable to kind of outrageous. First the outstanding: The sriracha brussel sprouts appetizer is fantastic and at $6.50 it is an outstanding deal. Next the good: The weekend prime rib deal is a DEAL Then the bad: The staff tries but is totally discombobulated, ill trained and generally missing in action. But they are SUPER friendly. The worst: They are 86 on a lot of items on a regular basis. Don't advertise a beer if it's out of stock, take the plaque of the wall. If custom sodas are your specialty don't run out of black cherry soda.  And don't expect to get a bargain. We usually get one appetizer for 4 people, 4 entrees, 2 beers and 2 sodas, and it consistently comes out to between $35 and $40 per person with tax and tip. But a BIG part of that is the high taxes in Charlottesville."
Samuel C.,"Austin, TX",93,666,,4.0,12/15/2017,"My experience with BJ's Charlottesville is much more positive than that of some of the other Yelpers. In general, BJ's is an absolutely reliable chain. The room is good. The food is good. There are a ton of good-for-you items that also taste good.  So your mouth and your cardiologist are both happy. I ate here with another experienced BJ's veteran.  Both us got normal BJ's food - which means first rate.  Both of us felt the C'ville was more or less the same as other national BJ's. Service was a little slow - but nothing out of the ordinary. But basically we ate well. So I am writing a four star review - and my dining partner would have done the same. If you read other Yelper's reviews, You get some people who like the place - and some people who moan and groan about terrible service and miscooked food. In the bad reviews, the horrible-terrible stories occurred not so long ago. It could be that there has been a recent management change - and things have been repaired in the last few weeks. It could be that we got lucky and the C'Ville BJ's under normal conditions is a much worse place. It could be that BJ's Charlottesville got unlucky and drew a pack of unfair Yelp reviewers. (Hey, those things happen.) My best guess is that this particular BJ's had some difficulties during the start-up period - but it is pulling out of the slump. If you want, you can wait for more Yelpers to write reviews, and then go in only when there seems to be a run of good reviews. Or you could take your chances now. BJ's was absolutely fine when we were there. My guess is that your experience will be much the same."
Lewis W.,"Ruckersville, VA",1,65,37,4.0,10/30/2017,"We had relatives come from out of town and one is sensitive to gluten. Looking online we found BJ's had an extensive gluten-free menu, so we thought we'd try it.  Everyone seemed happy with what they ordered, I got a half rack of ribs, baked potato, & mozzarella and tomato salad, a ""special"" at $18.95. The salad had a nice strong balsamic sauce, but I think the potato was microwaved (or it may have just been reheated in the microwave) and the ribs were just average but not terrible. The service was okay, they definitely tried, but it could've been better. We'd go back to try other things on the menu but I thought it was a little pricey."
Alyssa A.,"San Francisco, CA",468,229,728,4.0,4/18/2017,"I came here tonight with some friends for half priced Pizookies and half off bottles of wine. It was a great way to relax during the week and with two deals on the same night --- it was hard to pass up.  We ordered the chips and guac, some wine, and a bunch of pizookies for the table. They were a little slow with the food but Kendal was awesome on making sure that we were in the loop on when things were going on. He also made up for the fact that things were coming out slower -- with his awesome service and communication.  Cookies and cream pizookie = 4 stars White chocolate pizookie = 5 stars Chips and guac = 4 stars  Kitchen food time = 3 stars Kenda's awesome service = 5 stars If you're thinking about coming here, definitely try it out. They have different specials every night of the week and Tuesday $3 pizookies are soooooo worth it. They also have happy hour specials."
Victoria H.,"Sterling, VA",232,90,116,2.0,1/24/2017,"I came here with my family for an early dinner on a Sunday. We were seated fairly quickly and had our orders taken. However, it took a very long time for our food to come out. Once it got to the table, I was a little disappointed. I ordered the lemon thyme chicken and was excited for the dish of chicken, brussels sprouts, and brown rice. However, the dish was so filled with a lemony broth that it resembled soup. The chicken was tender and flavorful and the sprouts were well cooked, but the excess of broth ruined the dish for me. My sisters both ordered the parmesan crusted chicken and thought it was good, as did my dad with his burger. My mom ordered a deep dish cheese pizza and said it had lots of tomatoes, but was really nothing special. On top of all this, it also took forever for our check to come out, and 2 out of 3 stalls in the women's restroom were out of toilet paper. I think this restaurant has potential; it has a great menu with a wide variety of options and lots of different beers to try. However, it needs to be better managed in my opinion."
Gayle A.,"Front Royal, VA",4,2,,1.0,11/26/2017,"Had the Santa Fe salad. Good flavors but the majority of the lettuce was the rib part of the romaine instead of the leafy part. I tried to ignore it, cut it up into smaller parts, etc. but was left with very little content.  I've had and made enough salads in my life to know this should not have been served that way. I did eat what I could b/c I was hungry, but when the server came to remove our plates, I showed her what I wasn't able to eat, which was size able.   She whisked it away and I heard her telling a manager about it as I went to the restroom. No compensation was offered and because of that we won't be returning."
Whitney H.,"Charlottesville, VA",345,54,13,4.0,10/1/2017,Enjoyed the atmosphere here 2x in 1 week! The wait staff was kind and attentive both visits and we were seated quickly. On my first visit I enjoyed the calamari and flatbread. The calamari was lightly covered and well cooked. On my second visit I enjoyed the Thai type pasta which was delicious but a tad too spicy. I also had the pleasure of enjoying multiple desserts. I don't even think I could begin to pick a favorite.
Tiffany L.,"New York, NY",121,1062,2,4.0,9/24/2017,"I've always had a soft spot for this restaurant since tasting their pizookie back in college in CA. It tastes even better when you get a free one on your birthday! This new location has a ton of parking and space inside for large groups. Their weekday specials are terrific, especially Monday nights where it's 1/2 price pizzas and $5 margaritas. Good service, drinks, and food. Wish they didn't keep the restaurant so frigid, though!!"
KT A.,"Ashburn, VA",0,32,1,4.0,9/9/2017,"Service was outstanding here!  I didn't like the ham and the extensive amount of sauce put on the Southern comfort chicken sandwich. However, when i removed those items the sandwich was real good. I ordered a apple cyder drink and it just tasted like a light beer, i am not a beer drinker so it was not something I liked and had waiter take it away and opted for a peach tea.  The tea was SUPER sweet but when you added water and steered it more it tasted great instead of like sugar diabetes. What i ,my mom and niece did enjoy immensely was the spinach artichoke dip and the fries!!This was my first time so I am figuring i am just navigating the waters with what i like here or maybe i am just a picky eater and drinker i guess but the service is top notch and i will return to try other items and hope to get the same GREAT FRIENDLY service."
Robin B.,"Charlottesville, VA",0,9,,5.0,10/6/2017,"Really love the building. The food is comparable to a chain, like an Outback Steakhouse, so if you're looking for a meal of that range, they're right on point. My GF enjoyed her meal, as did I. We did several flights of their house-made craft beers and even my least favourite was still pretty decent. Very surprised and pleased. Our waitress, Ashley was very pleasant and very informative. She seemed very into the place and was on point. Definitely coming back!"
Steven H.,"Charlottesville, VA",168,2,1,5.0,11/8/2017,"Bartender gave me the wrong beer but fixed it. She is also my girlfriend, so I'll let it slide"
Erin J.,"Charlottesville, VA",0,1,,1.0,1/8/2018,"This place is absolutely terrible. Went here with a group and never coming back. Ordered a glass of wine, and all I got was the decanter and no glass, so I'm awkwardly sitting there while my friends are all having their drinks. Servers looked like they clearly didn't want to be there, which showed in the terrible service and unprofessionalism. We also got their ""craft beer,"" which was nothing but watered down tasteless garbage. One of the other Yelpers here wrote that their beer isn't fit to serve as detergent at any of the actual breweries in Cville - absolutely true. What's even worse than the beer is the food itself. Overpriced and gross. You can stay at home and have your TV dinner for a fraction of the price. Our server couldn't even get our orders right, and was totally inattentive. Saw the general manager, who looked to be about the size of Jupiter, waddling about. Did nothing to remedy our bad experience. Honestly the worst restaurant I've ever been to. With so many better options in Cville, save your money and don't come here."
Amy A.,"Charlottesville, VA",72,40,46,4.0,3/5/2017,"Service this time, second visit after a call from the General Manager asking for a second chance...MUCH improved. Megan was our server and Kaitlyn, the Manager, was making rounds. Only complaint, seems understaffed during prime lunch time hours. Food was terrific and hubby got customized choice. No delays. Very pleased. But sad when server has to apologize because she's running her butt off. Also pricey for what you get."
James A.,"Raleigh, NC",0,7,1,5.0,11/14/2017,Tahlia is the only reason we go there. She is the greatest Bartender in all of Virginia. Not only is the selection amazing but because of she is so friendly and so wonderful to all of us every time we come we keep coming back. Please never ever let her go. We love your Restaurant but we really love your bartender.
Mike J.,"Greenbrier West, Chesapeake, VA",0,2,3,5.0,10/24/2017,The beer hit the spot. We each had a flight of four beers and we were happy with all of them. The seared I he salad was wonderful. The tuna was not overcooked.
David M.,"Tirol, Austria",1,21,1,2.0,6/9/2017,"2nd time a the relatively new BJ Brewhouse in Charlottesville. Not especially busy on a Friday night. Hostesses & Servers were quite new and helpful. The beers which came 1st were quite good. The food however leaves much to be desired. Kids burgers were 2 sliders that looked like they were made yesterday. 2 people had tacos which they thought were just OK. Our son had a mushroom burger, also OK. My ""Jumbo Spaghetti and Meatball was endorsed by the waiter who did not return until we were well into the meal. I told told him that the meatballs were overcooked, hard and not good. He apologized but didn't offer a remedy. Needless to say, I have no interest in returning to BJs unless it were only for a beer.  Addendum: to BJs corporate credit, when I sent them my review, they gave me an apology & a $25 credit to use on my next visit to their establishment."
Ashley H.,"Richmond, VA",0,3,2,2.0,10/26/2017,"We had high hopes when we went here. We were seated immediately and they were not all that busy. After being seated we sat for almost 30 minutes without being greeted, I had to go to the host to tell them we needed to be served and we still we not helped right away. They did take care of a free appetizer but nothing including the food was better than average. We had high hopes and it was a huge let down"
Vinecat O.,"Charlottesville, VA",0,23,1,1.0,2/8/2017,It is the middle of the afternoon on a Wednesday. I have been here 40 minutes waiting for a DRAFT BEER and still do not have it.
Sandra P.,"Downtown, Houston, TX",81,17,32,3.0,7/5/2017,The service was incredibly slow and they were not busy. The food was good and hot from the ahi tuna salad to the chicken wings.  The shrimp tacos were ok. The steak was good however the baked potato had long peaked hours before. The broccoli soup in the bread bowl was delicious as was the chicken alfredo.  Probably wouldn't go 1 hour before close.
Abbey R.,"Ashburn, VA",0,40,5,1.0,9/2/2017,Came here with a group of people because we all like different things and they had a good variety. The menu consists of like 100 different options so you can really tell what's really going to be good here. I ordered a noodle dish that was awful and my mom ordered a calzone type thing that looked like something you would heat in a toaster from the frozen section of the grocery store. Our server clearly didn't enjoy her job and only stopped by to take order and collect bill. We ordered chips and cheese dip which arrived at our table after we finished our entrees.....
Tracy M.,"Kents Store, VA",21,9,,1.0,8/19/2017,"First off I'd like to point out that there is no wow factor to this place. The only positive here was the spinach artichoke dip, everything else was severely lacking. I ordered the burger medium. Twice the burger came put well done and burnt. No bueno. My friend orders the turkey dip sandwich and it wasn't anything special and bland. The manager was lacking in her words on how to fix the issue and our server was lacking in experience. I am not impressed with this establishment and will not be back."
Claire K.,"Charlottesville, VA",0,11,,1.0,1/8/2017,"When B.J's first opened the service was wonderful food was AMAZING. Well, since then, the food is always cold and poorly served. When you come be prepared to spend over a hour for even a party of two. Such a shame Charlottesville needed more verity and B.J's was that go to spot and now it's the spot to simply avoid. Please please please get it together"
Amaka O.,"Charlottesville, VA",0,2,1,1.0,5/31/2017,"HORRIBLE!! Doesn't even deserve 1 star, horrible service horrible food. My nachos tasted like a brick with mexican blend kroger brand cheese sprinkled on top. No flavor, my 6 year old nephew could put this together. It took an hour to get a freaking disgusting over priced appetizer. My waitress was lovely though."
Prateek G.,"San Jose, CA",0,4,,1.0,7/6/2017,"Serves me right, I suppose... Yelp reviewers really should feel no pity for me on this one. BJ's is rated poorly on this site, and yet, here I am thinking: ""Surely not. Surely, they deserve a chance. How bad can they possibly be?"" The answer to that is that they single-handedly do as much damage to the awesome reputation of Charlottesville brewhouses as Olive Garden does to Italian cuisine. I mean, they suck so bad that it is staggering they are viable as a business. The IPAs they brew aren't good enough to use as detergents at South Street, Three Notch'd or Sedona. I mean to say, ewww.  How badly can you screw up a salad? A salad! Ask them, they know how. Request: ""No red onions in my salad please""; Response: Extra red onions for you cut up so small that you won't even be able to fish them out. My salad had so much lemon juice on it that I think I may have lost 90% of the enamel from my teeth. Other small gripes? When you put down the order on the table, maybe look to make sure that they poor guy has silverware to eat with? (Unless BJ's is actually a Moroccan restaurant and salad is meant to be eaten with fingers, in which case I apologize).  Simply not good enough for the foodie heaven that Charlottesville has rapidly become."
Rebecca S.,"Stuarts Draft, VA",0,4,,3.0,11/17/2017,Food was good. Service was very very slow. Took forever to get water refills. !!! And this was at 11 am. I can't imagine when it's actually busy . I may give it one more shot. But .....
Ashten G.,"Oak Island, NC",0,4,,5.0,3/21/2017,"My mother and I have been here plenty of times since they opened. Normally we always get terrible service but the food and drink selection & quality tend to make up for it.  Tonight we had the greatest service we have ever had there. Kendal (I lost my receipt so I am so sorry if I misspelled your name) was attentive, kind, understanding of my messy 1 year old, helpful, and very handsome.  Thank you again for everything.  If you go to BJ's, you'll want to ask for this amazing server.  *inhaled food before thinking about getting pictures*  *very highly recommend the spinach stuffed mushrooms & the honey siracha Brussels sprouts."
Jenene R.,"Keswick, VA",0,4,,2.0,12/19/2016,"Although we did not have a reservation for our large party, BJ's got us seated rather quickly.  We had two wait staff and they were very good.  My sister ordered a steak (medium) which turned out to be a disaster.  The first one was overcooked, dry and tough.  After waiting for quite a bit of time (we had all finished eating), the second was under cooked and when served, had a plate full of blood.  The manager came over with the second plate and proceeded to give a very condescending and patronizing lecture on his expertise on the proper cooking techniques of steaks.  Not something a hungry person wants to hear!!  He offered to take it off the bill but had to be reminded. I ordered the sliders which turned out to be one hamburger patty cut in quarters so you had this triangle sitting in the middle of a slider bun. The dessert was good but not what I ordered."
Ariel B.,"Charlottesville, VA",0,2,,1.0,10/10/2017,"There are three things that provide the backbone to a restaurant: food, service, and ambiance. To be brutally honest, BJ's fails in all these major categories. I would be confident in stating that it's one of the WORST restaurants in this town. I mean it's embarrassing that a ""restaurant"" (more like a chain food feeding trough) like this is allowed to inhabit space in a town like Charlottesville, a foodie paradise.  Now, onto the food. The food is overpriced and awful. It's clearly microwaved and cooked in convection ovens, and is either incredibly bland or over spiced. If you want to eat microwave oven pizza and broccoli cooked in steamer packs, then this is the place for you. Also be sure that it's cooked how you originally asked for it, as it's usually made incorrectly. The service is so horrendously bad as the servers are poorly trained, inexperienced, or clearly just don't care. Whatever the day, something always gets messed up, or they've run out of something, or it takes forever to get your order of whatever. The only semi-decent thing to be salvaged is the beer and cocktail menu - but one can find just as good at another restaurant. The servers are clearly stressed out all the time and the management seems poor, as the bad service seems to be a direct result of bad management. Just sitting there is depressing because the atmosphere feels affected by the frustration of both the staff and other customers.  Overall, there are actual good chain restaurants to visit like Travinia and Sedona. Hell, even Mission BBQ right next door is a tremendously better option. Never again will I waste my time and money coming here."
Mike O.,"Greensboro, NC",3,10,1,1.0,6/7/2017,This place is crap. Came in town on business and decided that we would take a group of us up to watch the NBA finals and have something to eat.  We ordered and after an hour and a half we still haven't even received our appetizer. We complained about the slow service. Was told that they had a couple of people walk out on them back in the kitchen. We understood but the place wasn't even 25% full. Felt like they could've got our food out quicker. A gentleman that was with us had 1 beer in that hour and a half and then the manager came out and said that he couldn't serve him. What? One beer and he's cut off...I don't care if he 3 or 4. No food for that length of time will affect people differently. That's on them. Food never showed and we decided to walk... Long story short...DO NOT GO HERE!!
Alex R.,"Fredericksburg, VA",5,20,24,3.0,12/17/2016,"Stopped by for a late lunch during a road trip. Little bit of confusion during the hand-off from the hostess to the server, but it eventually worked out. Our server seemed to be pretty hurried, but she was nice and tried to be as helpful as she could. Started with the brussels sprouts for an appetizer, and they were amazing. Perfectly roasted and not oversauced. Dining companion ordered a Santa Fe Salad, which was massive. Unfortunately, the avocados mentioned in the menu somehow didn't make their way into the salad. Same for the roasted red peppers. And the kitchen went a little heavy on the dusting for ""presentation."" I ordered the California Chicken Club, which was pretty good. It was kind of light on the avocado as well, so maybe the kitchen was running low on stock when we were there. We finished things off with a Salted Caramel Mini Pizookie, which, as a grown-up, is a word I feel weird saying out loud. That was pretty delicious."
K T.,"Charlottesville, VA",0,5,,2.0,11/6/2017,"We really want this place to improve, but after several visits, it still suffers from service issues.  The staff is friendly, but service is GLACIAL.  There will appear to be plenty of servers on staff, so perhaps the problem is lack of good management.  Food is decent, and places in this category are desperately lacking in Charlottesville, so we want them to succeed- but this is not the place to go if you're in a hurry, whether it's a weekday or a weekend, even if sitting in the bar.     Updating 2 months and at least 3 repeat visits later - wow.  Every time we go here, it's a different waitstaff and manager crew, and yet somehow - still no improvement.  Tonight we waited 40 minutes for our bar drinks, and our appetizers arrived well before those drinks. Our son ordered a bacon cheeseburger and somehow ended up with a plain burger, no toppings whatsoever.  Our waitress was not to blame- she even said she would (and did) stand at the bar until our drinks were ready to bring our.  This restaurant always staffs the bar (that serves the entire restaurant) with only one bartender, so the bar is always behind- whether it's a slow night or a busy one.  Who knows what's going on in the kitchen that we had that burger breakdown.  Manager was apologetic but ineffective, and c'mon folks, how many chances should we give you??  I think this Cville family - who eats out often and is always willing to give the benefit of the doubt-  is done trying.  The two stars are generous."
B B.,"North Brunswick, NJ",4,57,11,3.0,7/31/2017,"We had the deep dish Mediterranean pizza.  It was ok at best.  Rather dry and toppings were sparse.  On the other hand, my wife had the gluten free cheeseburger which she said was excellent.  The fries were way too salty.  The ambience was nice and service was good, but there are better choices close by."
Mark R.,"Sterling, VA",4,4,,1.0,9/29/2017,I'm still sitting here at the bar on Friday night being totally ignored by two bartenders. Pathetic service
Troy B.,"Covington, VA",13,107,104,4.0,7/2/2017,"After a full day in Charlottesville area and striking out at various local breweries, we decided to go with a chain that we had eaten at before when we were in Arizona.   This place had local beers as well as their normal tap options.   THe restaurant is easy to find and had lots of parking.   We went about 530 pm and got a table no problem.  The host seemed a little clueless, but we got a table quickly. Our waitress was fine and did a good job.   I got a water and a Jeremiah Red beer, which i had out in Arizona.  My wife had a strawberry daquiri.  Both were good.  We were ready for a reliable beverage after so many failures at various breweries.  I had a burger with fries and she had Mahi Mahi tacos.  Both were very good.   We will go back again especially when we are in need of a reliable location for food and beverage.  One a side note... this bar had a large bourbon selection!  I was surprised.  It had the normal Jim Beam stuff, but it had Four Roses, Woodford, Bullit, Elijah Craig, Angel Envy and a few I was not familiar with.  I may go back just to sample some of the bourbon!"
Lois F.,"Palmyra, VA",2,4,,3.0,8/2/2017,"I'm afraid the shine is disappearing from my favorite restaurant.   Went for a late lunch today - around 2 PM.   Ordered 2 orders of the Root Beer short ribs, did not want the spicy slaw that came with them so ordered just plain slaw.   The ribs came out with the spicy slaw on the plates so we had to wait for another order.  Two of the ribs had fallen in the kitchen so we received our order, minus the two which did arrive later, but the plain slaw had no dressing on it.   Upon mentioning this to our waiter, he said that's the way it comes.  We got no extra plate for the bones of the ribs we had eaten, no moist wipes for our hands, no extra napkins until we requested some. One other thing I might mention,  when the hostess greeted us, she immediately went to the menus and I asked her if she didn't want me to enter my phone number so I would get points for this meal and she said don't worry about it, the waiter will get that done.  That was a first in all the times I had been there previously.  And when I mentioned it to the waiter, he was surprised as well. I will definitely give this place another chance because of all the great meals I've enjoyed previously.  Hopefully, this was an anomaly."
Raj D.,"Chantilly, VA",0,9,,2.0,7/1/2017,"I am here on a Sunday afternoon at 430 sitting on the tables across from the bar. It took about 5 minutes before a waitress even acknowledge me. Not to mention she said Rachel will be with you shortly. The minute she walks into the back she yells out Rachel. And I knew from that point that this will be another crappy experience at BJ's. I decided to get up and get my own beer from the bar tender instead of waiting for Rachel or who ever will be taking my drink or food order.  Let's hope the rest of the time here changes.  I would have given them a 1 star, but the bar tender actually apologized because she knew what I was doing.  Also I never figure out why this place has 3 to 4 people just standing behind the counter at the pick up or take out area. Makes me wonder about the manager.  Back again with a few people for drinks at 11pm on a Saturday night. The bar is the only place 6 people are sitting. With the 3 of us The first bartender was great since then the blond  in glasses has not turned away from the computer when we are trying to get her attention for paying our tab or possibly ordering something  to go for someone else.  This place needs to be better trained.  Corporate please and I do mean please bring someone here to train the managers and the servers or else this will be another Ruby Tuesday's and will close down."
Michele D.,"Ruckersville, VA",100,88,82,5.0,4/15/2017,I've only been here once and my experience was definitely worth 5 stars. From the wait to friendly service to quality of the dinner we ordered...it was exactly what I'd expect from an American fare chain. I was impressed with the Gluten Free options (especially when it came to their signature dessert!) they really have something for everyone unlike some other chains in its same category. This location stays busy so use their app for call ahead seating or know that on any given evening around dinner you'll have to wait! We were a party of 2 and got seated immediately on a pretty busy Friday night.
Brandi G.,"Floyd, VA",7,2,,5.0,4/20/2017,Great food and great service. Went in late (9ish) with 8 people and we never felt rushed and the service was fantastic. It was much appreciated because we were all in town for my 3-month-old son's open-heart surgery the next day and we just wanted to spend some time together and not feel the stress for a little while. It was much appreciated and our bellies were fat and happy.
Fonda S.,"Palmyra, VA",0,7,,2.0,4/10/2017,"I have just had the most unsatisfactory lunch at this place, and the chicken encrusted breast was hard as a rock, broccoli dry, mashed potatoes tasted  like  wallpaper paste. My husband had the shrimp cajun style with rice and the whole lunch had absolutely NO flavor. This was my first time and maybe my last. I did not want to speak to the manager just leave quietly and not return, however, he did come over and spoke to me and apologized for the meal."
Malcolm R.,"Charlottesville, VA",1,14,,5.0,4/8/2017,"Went to this place last week for dinner. I ordered the ribs, which tasted excellent. The Orange creme soda was OK. Also tried their ""pizookies"". The chocolate chunk tasted a little burnt but I did love the cookies and creme one. Went there again today and ordered the grilled chicken Alfredo. It was good but I thought it came with bread. I would definitely recommend this place though."
