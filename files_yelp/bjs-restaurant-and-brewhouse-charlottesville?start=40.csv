J D.,"Riverhead, NY",0,1,,2.0,2/20/2017,"The waitress was HORRIBLE! Every order was wrong from the mac and cheese to the chicken wings. Had to ask another waitress for drink, as she disappeared and never brought wine. Then we were charged for the mistakes. Food wasn't bad but service was terrible!"
Christine A.,"Atlanta, GA",1,4,3,2.0,12/26/2016,"Food was just okay. Service was terrible. They were completely understaffed and our poor waitress could barely keep up with our drinks refills. The manager came by to ask how everything was and we answered that it was a bit slow considering we waited over an hour for our food. He replied ""um okay..."" and walked away. Very interesting customer service style. We won't be back."
Kim C.,"Charlottesville, VA",43,5,1,1.0,1/6/2017,"We live close by and have given this place many chance based on the convince of their location, but continue to be disappointed. To start, their call ahead seating doesn't work, and they almost always tell you 15 minutes but it could range from 20-60 minutes. We alway give them a heads up that we have a toddler and it never fails (4 out of 6x) they sit us at a high top, which a high chair doesn't work. Don't order steak if you like it cooked a certain way, their rare steak is not the industry norm. Management did speak to us and apologize, unfortunately it wasn't authentic and we could see his irritation with us.  They do have Moscato! Our waitress told us they didn't but then heard another table order it. She apologized but still brought me the same drink as she did before. I didn't bother to let her know because at this point I need the alcohol!  Our most recent visit the fish tacos were still frozen! They comped those 2 meals but our friends ended up leaving hungry. During this same meal I asked our waitress for extra sauce, which she forgot. When the manager was at our table about the frozen fish I asked him for the extra sauce. He quickly defended the waitress and said he heard (sure) her order it and should be out any minute and said he'd be by shortly to make sure I got it. 15 minutes later I finally got it when I didn't need it. Management never came by to check on us during the 15 minutes. I will say we are going back, not that we are choosing to, but because everyone we are friends with seems to wanna try this place. And honestly, we keep hoping each time they will have made some drastic changes, I'll let ya know if they do!  One last thing, regardless if they are busy or slow, their service is always slow!"
Mike S.,"Charlottesville, VA",114,19,,3.0,5/9/2017,"Big space with expansive food and beer menu. BJ's brews were not quite ready for prime time but food was good and reasonably priced.  Overall, staff was pleasant but our server could use some coaching."
Jamie K.,"Charlottesville, VA",1,20,18,2.0,11/20/2016,"Food was all around ""meh"". My salmon was super salty, my daughter had Easy Mac, our friends thought the pizza was good, ribs needed a knife and fork to pry them off the bone, aka not good, and the burger was ""ok"". Server had NO CLUE about the menu- I asked him if a salad came with my salmon dish, he said ""I'm not sure"". He came back to ask which sides we wanted  with the ribs (he didn't know any sides came with when we placed the order) so we asked him what the choices were, to which he said ""I'm pretty sure there's a potato or some soups or a vegetable""... gee, helpful. He was very nice, but very uneducated about the products he was selling. I won't even mention his lack of beer knowledge in a brew house. Bottom line, there are 200+ other much better restaurants in Charlottesville, and at least 4 much better local breweries. Save your money, and go somewhere else."
Hapi L.,"Washington, DC",0,17,3,3.0,7/15/2017,"Not as good as I remembered. The first time, I went to the BJ's in Lancaster and thought I had the most amazing clam chowder bread bowl. The bowl was crispy and warm when it arrived, the clam chowder creamy with big chunks of clams. I was dying to have that again so when I saw this BJ's driving through Charlottesville I eagerly stopped to relive that experience of the heavenly clam chowder bread bowel even in the middle of a hot July day.  The bread bowel seemed smaller than the one I had in lancaster and more doughy not that crispy or crusty outside with the soft inside that I had loved in Lancaster.  Inside was soft but the whole thing was just ok. I also ordered the Fish tacos which was pricey for what you get - two small tacos, that left me wishing there was more mahi; it was served with a handful of chips for $10.50. Decent food. But I won't be so eager to stop here again."
Patrick T.,"Yigo, Guam",0,11,1,2.0,7/29/2017,Service was subpar. Our waitress was very nice but forgetful. Waited to order for some time and then waited over 40minutes for our food. The food was just ok
Jennifer W.,"Greenville, VA",0,2,,1.0,7/29/2017,We have been here numerous times and have had a good experience. Unfortunately this time was not one of them. We waited for 10 min to be seated in a 1/2 empty restaurant and then when we were finally seated no one came to our table for 20 min. We finally decided to leave. We won't be back anytime soon.
Sarah Y.,"Charlottesville, VA",78,67,20,5.0,1/4/2017,"This place is really good!  We started with the spinach and artichoke dip with house made tortilla chips and is was delicious. I had the deep dish Chicago style pizza and it was AMAZING. My Moms club sandwich looked good too and the fries that came with it were on point. We also had the home brewed sodas root beer and black cherry. They were yummy as well. The service was amazing and our waitress Tiffany was the sweetest and very attentive. She even cut and served my pizza for me, each slice of it. Definitely give this place a try!!"
C. R.,"Palmyra, VA",0,8,2,4.0,3/16/2017,"Our experience at BJ's Brewhouse this evening was amazing.  Arrived at 6pm-no wait, the host was welcoming and friendly, our waitress Kathleen was kind, funny and paced our meal perfectly-we did not feel rushed, Kathleen made sure we had everything we needed.  Their menu is huge, something for everyone.  The triple chocolate pizookie is a must have.  Can't wait for our next meal there, so nice to have a new dining option in Charlottesville!"
S N.,"Charlottesville, VA",0,4,,2.0,3/7/2017,"We visited for the first time this evening.  Had the pizza and the chicken parmesan.  The chicken was dry and didn't look at all like the picture.  The potatoes were a bit dry as was the chicken.  Not enough sauce.  The pizza toppings were overcooked and the crust was undercooked.  The wine glass had lipstick stains.   The service was very good.  The wine and beer were fine, though.  May go back and order just the sliders at the bar or something; that may work out better.  The price was o.k."
Darrell F.,"Gordonsville, VA",0,4,,2.0,11/23/2016,"This restaurant offers a very good menu that has various items for everyone. Unfortunately the service and timing are terrible because it took us over an hour to eat do to slow service. This is the second time I've eaten there because I wanted to give it a second chance , the first time I left without eating and the second time like I said it took over  an hour."
Shannon B.,"Charlottesville, VA",0,9,,5.0,2/17/2017,"Had dinner here last night for the first time and it was great! The entire staff is friendly and knowledgeable, and make you feel welcome from the second you walk in the door. Our waiter Kendel was awesome and made sure we had everything we needed! The menu is huge and has something for everyone--I was impressed by the selection and variety, especially the gluten free and lighter options. Will definitely be going back! 2/17--Add Tae to the list of awesome waiters and waitresses!"
Karin M.,"Charlottesville, VA",72,23,7,2.0,12/15/2016,"Just another chain restaurant, equivalent to an Applebee's but twice as expensive. I sent back the Lemon Thyme Chicken because it was off the sodium content charts, so bad that my lips began to pucker after three bites. Save your money."
Jamy L.,"Palmyra, VA",73,8,1,1.0,2/7/2017,"Let me start by saying the food was very good. The problem was the horrendous service we received. We were seated quickly and started going over the menu. After 15 minutes we had not been greeted by a server so I went to let the hostess to let her know. She rudely looked at me and with an attitude said, ""oh, let me find someone."" And walked away. About five minutes later a server finally walked over and said, "" I'm not your sever but I'll take your drink order"". He ended up being our server.  After taking our order, it took about 25 minutes the get our salad and the wrong appetizer. The manager apologized for the app. but she didn't seem genuine or like she was worried about the servers not doing their jobs.  I enjoyed the food but I would never go back."
Austin S.,"Charlottesville, VA",0,1,1,2.0,2/3/2017,The Brussels salad was ok. I got it for take out and was less than happy with the size. Cost close to $11 and I would have expected a little more. Taste wise I would rate it a 3 ish/5. Brussels could be cooked a little more and might be really good served warm. Might go try it in the restaurant just to compare but I have to admit it's not a great first impression for such a new chain. Husband got a guacamole burger. He thought it was ok but not as good as other burgers that are available in the area.
Cherry F.,"Toano, VA",0,13,,5.0,11/13/2016,"Saturday night we called ahead for seating. Got there and found out they actually text you once it's ready but that was unclear during the phone conversation. They were packed and customers were angry at the wait and apparent confusion that followed. We waited 45 minutes in addition to the 15 minutes call ahead but the staff was nothing but charming and emphatic.  Once seated serving staff was amazing and instantly brought our starving children individual bread and fruit. Lifesaver. Ordered appetizer nachos (good), ahi tuna salad (good), baked ziti (excellent), jalapeño burger (excellent), boneless wings (pretty good) and baked cookies (yummy). Yes, getting seating is disorderly but they will figure that out. Servers were great. Food was pretty darn good for a new restaurant."
Carrie B.,"Charlottesville, VA",5,1,,1.0,1/24/2017,"Probably my worst experience of service. Our waitress took forever to bring us waters first off. Then she took thirty minutes to bring our initial drink orders. Our simple request to change the game multiple times was either ignored or apparently too difficult because it never got changed until we had to ask multiple servers to ask for a manager. We finally got the game on after a whole half and halftime had passed. After our food, our dishes were left on the table for the remainder of the night even though the server came back to the table a few times after they had been finished. A beer order was never filled. She never brought checks until we again had to ask the manager. One member of our party had to leave, so she asked for her check, and left her card out for a good thirty plus minutes. It was never taken.  The service was inexcusable. The food was fine for a chain 100 plus item menu, but fine won't cut it with service like this.  This was a slow Tuesday night with way too many staff sitting around so I really don't understand why."
Carlie T.,"Charlottesville, VA",0,1,,1.0,1/24/2017,The worst service I have ever experienced. I would chew on razor blades that have been soaked in tabasco sauce before I'd ever eat here again. Service was terrible and the food was mediocre.
Amaya L.,"Marina, San Diego, CA",123,2,,5.0,6/4/2017,One of the best burger places in Cville. They have great deals -- unlimited fries and drinks. The service was fantastic too! And it's new so the place is clean and new looking. Definitely recommend!
