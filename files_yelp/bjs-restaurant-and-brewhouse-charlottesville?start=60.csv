Ella S.,"Charlottesville, VA",0,1,,2.0,4/17/2017,"I came here with my friends for a dinner on Sunday. We were seated in 5 minutes, which was OK. they had a lot of empty tables at the time we arrived, but didn't have enough servers. However the main issue was our server who was very rude. I couldn't figure out if she's too tired or mad of us for being there and making her work. It took a very long time for our food to come out and our server didn't even check with us once if we need more water or anything until we called her. I had burger which was fine, but the server didn't ask me how I wanted the meat to be cooked and it was too pink for me. My friends ordered fish&chips, Jambalaya, and parmesan-crusted chicken and said it was OK. However, the parmesan-crusted chicken didn't look like the website picture at all. The crust was burned and the chicken was overcooked. I didn't find anything special in this restaurant specially with their poor services. It's very disappointing for a newly opened restaurant!"
Ross T.,"Charlottesville, VA",0,7,,3.0,11/10/2016,"The beer was good and the bison burger mediocre. I was offered a choice of sides and selected a salad, not knowing it was a $3.95 up charge. My friend got a very over dressed chopped salad. The best thing we had was the brussel sprout appetizer - very good! Still needs some work - but I understand they are newly opened. Lots of potential and the service was good."
Marylouise C.,"Boston, MA",0,13,,1.0,1/24/2017,"Just another big food factory. BIG menu which makes me think ""how can it all be fresh?"" Food was boring and rather flavorless. Service no better. No reason to go back. The tipoff is they cook burgers ""medium well"" even if you request medium rare. Food stand in Costco better choice."
Deniese L.,"Denver, CO",150,124,72,3.0,1/9/2017,"i went on a thur night so it wouldn't be busy.  definitely wasn't.  we were a table of 6, a couple tables full around us, but nothing crowded -no wait time.  our server was quick w/our drinks, and we got our food at a reasonable time, but the food was nothing out of the ordinary.  it was normal american food, just a little over priced.  the reason i gave is only 3 stars was b/c of the service once we got our food.  our server was never to be seen -we had to ask other servers walking by for condiments.  and when we asked for the check from another server, we had waited 45min until we asked another server for our check again.  still our original server hadn't been seen, and the table next to us were quite upset that they were waiting around for a long time too.  once our server showed up w/the check, it took about 15 more minutes until she showed up to pick up our cards.  and then she didn't come back for another 10 min or more (we were done waiting).  once she showed up, there wasn't much tip, especially b/c she wouldn't even explain where she's been, not even an apology.  the table next to us asked one of the server's if they can see the manager (to complain), but the manager never showed up either.  maybe i'll wait a couple months to come back to the restaurant just so they can get their service act together."
Amy H.,"Lyndhurst, VA",28,9,,4.0,3/17/2017,"Our first time at this restaurant. My husband is a home brewer and knew more about beer than our server. Murphys Law the one beer he decided to try was out. He enjoyed the alternate he selected.  I had a skinny margarita. A little sweet for my taste. He got the bison burger. He asked for medium rare. He also got the golden beet salad. Very good. Got a very rare burger but it was delicious. I got the ahi tuna salad. ( hold the wonton strips) Tuna had no seasoning but there was wasabi on the side of the plate which helped. Salad and dressing were delicious but a bit overdressed. Next time will ask for dressing on the side.  We both got mini pizzookis ( molten cookie dough in a pizza pan with Ice cream on top) for dessert, mine gluten free. OMG. Cookie was the perfect combination of crunchy and gooey. Restaurant was very noisy with March Madness game on, music playing, and boisterous customers but fun. Our server was very sweet. Overall experience was good but could use a few tweaks. Lots of vegetarian and gluten free and low cal options as well as pizza, burgers and apps something for everybody."
Chris F.,"Charlottesville, VA",0,6,,2.0,1/15/2017,"TERRIBLE SERVICE. After 30 minutes, we still didn't receive our drinks. We received our entree first, then our appetizer, then our drinks. The waitress could have cared less, she only came by the table twice in an hour and never apologized. The food was really good but it's just not worth it for the terrible service. There are lots of good places to eat on Cville that provide much better service."
Savee I.,"Charlottesville, VA",60,2,1,2.0,11/29/2016,"We went because I've heard a few good things about them. We ordered a bottle of wine. A lady brought it out with two very dirty glasses with lipstick stains and dirty finger prints on them and set the bottle down on the table without ever opening it. Everyone seemed super confuse of what to do with that bottle of wine at the table. Finally, she was getting trained on how to open it and serve it at the table while we all watched. I ordered a pasta dish with chicken and no cheese (I'm allergic to dairy). The dish came out much later than everyone else's at the table, covered in cheese and no chicken. Our waitress took it back to fix it. It came out the second time with no cheese AND NO CHICKEN. At this point I didn't even want to eat anymore. I just asked for my chicken on the side. One of us order mozzarella sticks and said they tasted like they were made an hour ago. Very disappointed. With all of the mistakes made, we never saw the manager about the matter. I'm going to let them figure out their ways of doing things before I go back. IF I go back."
Samantha J.,"Charlottesville, VA",43,6,,2.0,11/11/2016,"First, let me state that my experience was not terrible, it did leave much room for improvement.  I understood it was Veteran's Day and there was an abnormally large crowd that came in at one time.  But that was the issue, we waited 5 minutes looking at an utterly confused hostess trying to figure out how to seat everyone.  At first, I pondered - if they just opened, why wasn't the manager in the front helping this poor overwhelmed staff member nervously figuring out who to address first then who to sit first.  Well, we were sat and waited for almost 15 minutes before anyone came to take our drink orders.  Several staff members wandered in a lost daze, as I'm positive that servers were trying to figure out that groups were all sat down at once.  Our server was nice, apologetic, and explained the situation that nobody told her that her section was seated.  Of course, we weren't too bothered and proceeded to give our order.  Her section seemed to be filling up quickly and she went to attend those tables, but we understood.  We got our drinks but we also requested water as well because it was slightly warm in the building.  We requested water twice with our server and though we chalked it up to her forgetting our requests since she had a number of new tables seating in her section - after waiting for so long, the manager came by and we insisted on getting some water since our drinks that we did have were empty.  He immediately got it and then finally our server (freed from her other tables) came up with the waters we requested when we gave our order initially.  I talked with the manager and let him know our criticisms and though apologetic as well, speaking to the manager - we were only given an excuse to why things seemed so disorganized and we shouldn't blame the server or hostess for that.  I wasn't mad at all with them, I knew that this was a managerial fault and while he admitted that, a simple ""sorry that we've inconvenience you.  we hope to do better"" would have been sufficient, not the assumption that we were blaming the staff that were doing their best to work around the failures of management.  Other than that, the food was delicious and filling.  The staff were friendly, but there is definitely room for improvement.  Being sympathetic to new business awkwardness with having new staff and trying to figure out the flow of the general public on busy holidays, I hope that this review is a learning opportunity rather than a harsh criticism."
Tara M.,"Charlottesville, VA",0,3,,1.0,7/30/2017,"The food was alright, a bit on the oily side even the sandwich. However, the service though friendly was incredibly slow. The manager compensated our appetizer as it took until after we received our food. The reason they stated because the dip was frozen. There were so many staff and so few customers. I continued to find myself wondering why it took so long for everything. A long time to be greeted by our waitress and despite her friendly demeanor we were unimpressed with the average time it took to get her attention when we did need something. After we were done eating with dirty plates stacked we thought about staying to try the dessert yet it took so long for everything else we decided to void that venture. I continued to see tons of wait staff..doing absolutely nothing but sit or stand around chatting, one on her cell. We decided we would not be back as the food was average, prices high for the quality and service mediocre at best. Disappointed."
Kristina M.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,36,2,3.0,12/9/2016,Dessert is my favorite food group.  I normally have this chosen even before I've figured out my entree.  BJ's peanut butter s'more did not disappoint.  So good it brought tears to my eyes.  Would come here for that alone!  The deep dish pizza was ok; I prefer Uno's.
S A.,"Grottoes, VA",0,10,,1.0,7/8/2017,"Stopped in for lunch on a weekday, restaurant was not very busy. After being seated we waited for quite awhile just to see our server and even then she left without taking our drink order. When we finally got to order the waitress walked away as we were talking to her, and ignored us while she was at the table because she was to engrossed in her tablet to pay attention. When she finally took our food order it took incredibly long to get our food considering the restaurant wasn't busy at all.  After waiting so long, the food was marginal at best. Pizza was mostly bread and so little topping that it was bland. Side of fries wasn't even warm and tasted left over. We waited even longer to receive our check and our server was nowhere to be found. When she finally gave us the check she disappeared again and we had to wait to pay. Eventually we got tired of waiting for her to come back and get the bill that we just went up to another server and paid with them. At this point, it took awhile just to pay because they had trouble getting the computer system to process our payment. Overall, for a bill of over $90, it was not worth it at all whatsoever. You could get better food from a fast food restaurant than this."
Food L.,"Charlottesville, VA",0,2,,4.0,12/2/2016,Service was outstanding. All servers and managers were very attentive to all tables at all times. There was great interactions not only with my server but other servers and managers also. I'm a business owner in the food industry and I know that customer service is key to a successful business. I have it 4 stars based on the service however the food is another story. It is your typical box/frozen food that big box restaurants use. Being in Charlottesville which is known for local fresh farm to table food at most restaurants I was disappointed. That's what I expect when I sit down for a meal. Other than the box/frozen food it was a great experience and atmosphere. I will return but mainly for cocktails at the bar which was amazing!
Eric N.,"BURNLEYS, VA",0,17,,3.0,11/22/2016,The first few times we went were great. Last time we went it was down to Applebee's or TGIFriday's standards. I am very dissapointed to see it drop off so fast. Pizza and beer are still good at least. Guess we will stick to that from now on.
William M.,"Scottsville, VA",0,19,,5.0,11/12/2016,The food was excellent.  The service was great for such a busy night.  Our server was particularly good.  Took much time with our table.
Kevin T.,"Charlottesville, VA",0,4,,5.0,10/28/2016,Best service at a restaurant in/around Charlottesville! Deep dish pizza is incredible and great beer selection. Huge TVs great for watching the games too. My new favorite place in town!
Carolyn B.,"Charlottesville, VA",0,2,,4.0,1/11/2017,My first visit was today. Arrived around 1:30 PM. Nice welcome. Hostess assigned a gentleman to seat my party of three. Our server came to the table right away. Took orders for drinks and gave us time to examine a rather large menu. I ordered the calamari as an appetizer and was glad to see the tentacles were included.  Most other restaurants in town serve it without and I always wondered why...the best part. I had the spicy peanut chicken w/soba noodles. It was delicious.  Server kept checking to see if all was okay. My sister-in law had the baby back ribs w/ fries. She said they were good and mozzarella sticks. I tried one and thought it was pretty good. Our friend had the bacon cheeseburger.  It looked good but she ended up taking it home and ordered the same for her husband. So I assumed she liked it. My sister -in law ordered the same cheeseburger to go for her hubby. The restaurant was probably a little over half full. Our server got kind of busy but still had plenty time for us. The food presentation was nice as I looked around at what others were having. I thought it was a nice addition to our town with easy access. Prices were reasonable for the type of food. Plenty  TV monitors for sports lovers.
