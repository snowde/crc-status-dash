Alex K.,"West Hollywood, CA",201,256,257,4.0,11/29/2017,"Mission: Get some beers and wings after an exciting shooting day! A couple of miles away was the best shooting range we have ever been to and it's almost a tradition to get some BJ's after an exciting shooting trip.  We arrived at BJ just a bit past 1 pm and they were clearly in their rush lunch mode. We were, however, seated right away, given menus and given some time to make a selection. I always order their Red beer, I don't know what ts called its one of the famous ones. It's red something.  I had the BBQ brisket burger and thought it could use some seasoning. The bbq sauce was also so so, I'm paying $15 for a tiny burger, the least you can do is make it special. We order several orders of wings and they were awesome appetizers. They came with ranch and not that weird other white sauce, blue cheese, eeewwww.  The waitress was nice and gave us good service and made the overall experience more enjoyable."
Michael T.,"Beverly Hills, CA",304,48,20,1.0,11/11/2017,"Worst experience ever. Only good things were the waiter and manager they were polite and sweet, but there is something wrong in the kitchen. Food was not prepared correctly and definitely bland. I first ordered the chicken parm.. no seasoning at all. None. The vegetables even were not steamed properly, and kind of tasted burnt. Than I ordered double bone pork chop. Anyone who knows about pork chops knows it should be fully cooked, however mine was cooked on the outside just perfect but somewhat raw in the inside. Even had my stomach acting up and made me nauseous after eating a bite. We had the chicken lettuce wraps, they should call it the celery lettuce wraps. The chicken where in huge chunks and it was so much celery.  They really should Fire the chef I will probably never be going back to any BJ restaurant it was such in the bad experience. I don't recommend this BJ for anybody."
Tim C.,"Chino, CA",1,21,5,1.0,10/8/2017,"1 star for the Irish Root Beer because that is the only part of this visit that I enjoyed.  We had a party of 10 and weren't greeted  by anyone for over 15 minutes. We had to go ask the hostess if she knew who our server was. Turned out our server was one of the girls we saw arguing with another server when we first arrived.  After getting our drinks and order, she came back by to tell us this other gentleman would be taking over our table for her. We never got either of their names.  My mom ordered a side of chili and fries which they brought out her chili with everyone else's salads for some reason, and then her fries came out with everyone else's entrees.  All of our entrees came out room temperature or cold. A few of us just put up with it because we were starving, but some others sent their food back. One of our guests had a salad that was so drenched and soggy that she couldn't eat it. It seemed like it was made and sat around until all the other food was ready.  The manager came over and comped the 2 cold meals we returned and offered free pizookies. However, the server came and dropped the check and never asked us what pizookie we wanted. So we decided to pay and leave.  Overall awful experience."
Adriana G.,"Eastvale, CA",64,123,222,4.0,9/9/2017,"I see that BJ's has an average of three stars, and I'll admit that we've have some rougher days here.  However, this is a go-to restaurant for family meals, and overall we tend to have a pleasant experience.  One thing that we like is the app, which my husband uses every time we visit.  This allows us to reserve a place in line (I think it's ""call-ahead seating""), and we also collect points that become coupons. Foodwise, BJ's offers a ridiculous variety.  This is not fine dining, but if you're with a group with diverse tastes, you  can be pretty certain each person will find something suitable on the menu.  They do have a selection of lighter fare for the calorie-conscious, as well, and those items are not lacking in flavor and are also very filling.  Most salads and bowls can also be ordered in a half portion. Kids have a variety of choices here.  Our two typically order buttered noodles with fries, but there is a kids menu available.  They even offer a kid-sized pizookie, which you will feel less guilty about eating. This is a great place for those who enjoy adult beverages, as they have their own brews and also offer signature cocktails.  When it comes to drinks, their berry cider is my favorite.  I also really like their sodas; their homestyle vanilla cream soda is the best I have ever tasted. Yes, sometimes service can be slower than you want, and occasionally there are mistakes with the order, but generally this is a good place to eat.  Stop by if you haven't yet!"
Kathy T.,"Irvine, CA",320,246,582,3.0,6/26/2017,"I came here for their BOGO offer (purchase 1 entree and 2 drinks, get a free entree). Plenty of parking and there was no wait for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. Food was okay..  - Deep-Dish Ziti - Super oily from the cheese. My friend said it was good though and very filling. Size is comparable to their personal sized deep dish containers. It's enough food to make you stuffed, but not quite enough to split into two satisfying meals. - North Beach Mahi Mahi & Shrimp - This is a soupy dish with cous cous, grilled mahi mahi, shrimp and veggies (tomatoes, onions). Flavor was alright. I wanted to try something new and this was the lucky pick. I thought the fish was a little overcooked. Can't say I'd order it again... Overall, BJ's is a nice place for a meal, as they have great portions, but I must say that I only come here when there's a coupon deal!"
Randolph K.,"Chino, CA",57,105,90,3.0,6/29/2017,"Good consistent restaurant with good house brews at a fair price. I like their deep dish pizza, jambalaya, and recently tried their deep dish ziti. The ziti was pretty good and filling, though there was a lot of oil at the bottom of the pan equivalent to 1.5-2 shot glasses of grease. I'm guessing it's from all the cheese and tomatoes in the dish. Despite the pool of grease, the taste was good but not mind-blowing. The happy hour here is good though you won't find happy hour on the weekend. I haven't been disappointed by the appetizers and selection of beers. Pricing is fair and service has always been good."
Johnny P.,"San Jose, CA",2,14,20,3.0,9/27/2017,"I came to BJ's on a Wednesday night with a couple of friends when they had their special for a $10 Loaded Burger and Unlimited Fries.  Service Our server Ashley was very nice and quick with getting our orders out and drinks/sides etc. She also asked us about ordering a pizookie midway through our dinner, with the notion that it normally takes about 10-15mins for it to be done and can be out right when we finish eating. I really appreciate that she took the wait-time into consideration for us to have a much smoother dining experience.  Food My party ordered the Best Beginnings Appetizer Combo which comes with a variety of different items (chicken, mozzarella sticks, avocado eggrolls, chip, and dip). Even though the plate came out at one time, most of the items weren't hot anymore and was slowly heading towards being lukewarm. =( For the main meal I ordered the Hickory Brisket and Bacon Loaded Burger with a regular order of fries. To be honest, the best item out of the entire night were the fries. The burger and appetizers weren't up to expectation unfortunately.   Overall I came on a normal weekday without too much wait, perhaps it was an off day at the kitchen but the best thing was the fries and that's about it."
Bruce A.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,87,,4.0,12/29/2017,"We came for a family get together. The service was great and very friendly.  Some of us got there early so we waited in the lobby and the waiter offered us drinks while we were waiting, this was excellent. The food was good but a little little on the pricey side but still good."
Cornelious A.,"Los Angeles, CA",26,174,121,1.0,9/2/2017,"BJ sucks! I took my two son's here for lunch and we were all disappointed. Do not let their atmosphere fool you! They have a huge menu but a small way of delivering what they advertise on it. Although, the service was not bad, the food was disgusting, and a $75 tab is not worth it! I have been to plenty of place for $75 and BJ's is not one of them.  My plate came with brown rice and black beans and it was horrible. The brown rice was sticky and the black beans were dry. As a matter of fact, my whole meal was dry! We also ordered some root beer chicken wings, but got robbed on the root beer sauce, so I just ate the celery.  Both of my boys were not to happy on their meals either, so we decided to push our plates to the side, and leave. I think the only thing BJ's has going for themselves, is their bar. I will continue to drive past BJ's as I did before, and never look back! Great service but terrible food!"
Tisha C.,"Cerritos, CA",5,2,2,2.0,12/28/2017,"I usually love eating at BJ's but tonite wasn't so pleasant. I ordered the fish and chips but substituted the fries for asparagus, however, the fish didn't taste so good. You can tell the oil they used to fry the fish was old. My asparagus were not fresh, but wrinkly. My husband ordered the full rack of ribs, which tasted really good, with a wedged salad that was bitter and Brussels sprouts that were old and wilted. I think the chef needs to pay attention in the kitchen. Our waitress was wonderful,  she even swapped out the Brussels sprouts and came back and apologized and said let me know if you still don't like them,  cause unfortunately, they looked the same. The only reason, I'm giving 2 stars is because we had a really good server. I'm not sure I would come back.  Very disappointed!"
Earl B.,"Los Angeles, CA",41,32,108,3.0,8/13/2017,"Decided to stop by for a late lunch. I ordered chicken fettuccini with Cajon shrimp added. It took about a good 20 min for my food to arrive. Nonetheless, my waitress was attentive the entire time. My food finally arrive, hot and looking delicious. After a few bites, I noticed no chicken. Back to the kitchen it goes. Another 15min wait and I was not as hungry. Not too much to say about the adult beverages.  Overall, I was okay with the experience."
Debi V.,"Chino Hills, CA",79,64,42,2.0,4/11/2017,"We've been going to BJs for over 10 years, husband and I went on many a dates pre marriage at the Burbank location and post marriage continued making family memories at this Chino Hills location, even had our baby shower here and MANY Birthdays have been spent over a pizookie. The service and management are superior, they set the industry standard, I've NEVER had anything but excellent service and management addresses issues with food immediately.  Therefore the 2 stars. However, the quality of food has slowly gone from excellent to now unacceptable.  We go out to eat for the food first then the experience second so when the food is not good, the whole experience is disappointing.  I will only speak of last nights food, husband sent back his sandwich first time because the fries and grilled sandwich were cold.  When it came back the bacon was raw and fatty.  Sent it back again and he left hungry.  My daughters cheeseburger was good but bacon again, raw and fatty.  I ordered a salad because SADLY they've gotten rid of my beloved pot roast sandwich then the balsamic chicken, but I had my salad to go as our toddler was acting up. When I later ate my salad, I picked out two large romaine lettuce stems, see pic, the stems are supposed to be cut off and trashed.  For a $14 salad, this was the final straw.  We realized after last night that we continue to go to BJs for nostalgic reasons, so sadly now after so many poor food experiences lately, we have to say goodbye old friend."
Sophia L.,"Chino, CA",223,259,124,4.0,11/1/2017,Can't really go wrong at any BJ's. This one is never as busy as the one in Rancho Cucamonga which is a plus and the bar is bigger. Happy hour is something that should always be checked out because the prices are good and they have a pretty big selection. I have never had a bad experience here.
Greg F.,"Chino, CA",3216,370,3524,5.0,2/19/2017,"GREAT APPETIZERS AND INCREDIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE: THANK YOU DAVID M.!  What do two middle aged married adventurers do after tax preparation? We go to BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse of course! BJ's has been a great partner in the communities to military and first responders for years, and they even have a parking space reserved for combat wounded veterans...very cool!   Now to the drinks: We started with a four taster custom brew-set with the Blonde (light and sweet), Hefeweizen (malty deliciousness), Red Ale (smooth but strong), and the Goliath Imperial (9.0 ABV). I must mention that our server, David M., created this sample, and his assistance with the selections was spot on.  I ended up ordering a pint of the Red Ale afterward because it was perfect and less ABV than the Goliath Imperial.  Now the food: We ordered the Sriracha Brussel Spouts, the 10 Piece Bone-In Wings, and the California Club Flatbread Pizza. OMGoodness, the sprouts were tangy, earthly, and the fried corners were delicious. If you have not tried the sprouts, please do yourself a favor and experience greatness.  The wings were great, and the flatbread was good. We finished most it and took the rest home. Now to the service: This was the BEST service we have experienced in a long time; anywhere. David M. was spot on at ever moment.  From his drink suggestions, to his approach and delivery, it was refreshing to see that someone else took pride in their job.  Our drinks were full at all times, and David knew the perfect time to stop by to check on us. David's professionalism is a reflection of site management and Bj's organizational goals.  Thanks David M. for making our impromptu response to Bj's extremely satisfying and enjoyable!"
Yvonne M.,"La Verne, CA",292,45,81,5.0,11/6/2017,Came here for dessert while the $3 pazookie deal was going on. Got seated quick since the bar was self seating. The service was nice even after we made our pazookie orders so complicated. Party of 4 had different orders and we made them halves of something else and our server was nice thru it all! The pazookies were so warms and very good! A must try if you have never had a warm baked cookie with ice cream on top! Good dessert!
Linda P.,"Mira Loma, CA",3,28,8,1.0,12/26/2017,"Worst service ever and I come have visited other BJ locations often. Ordered the root beer ribs and they barely had sauce. Half the platter had little to no meat on the bones. When I asked my server about the meatless ribs, her response was ""well, my manager said that's what we got"". Then I asked for a wet wipe and got a cold wet towel because they are out of wet wipes too."
Ivonne S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",1382,75,1440,5.0,10/16/2017,"Whether it is just me and my boyfriend or the whole family, we cannot go wrong with Bj's Deep Dishes. I've tried a few pastas, but nothing beats their pizza. For appetizers their avocado rolls are so yummy, their calamari is not full of batter so it's perfect and let me tell you about their Peppered BBQ wings, they're delicious I couldn't stop licking my fingers (I know it's gross, but the sauce was so yummy.) Service is always great, no matter how busy it is. There's T.V.'s throughout the restaurant so a lot of sport games are on. Not a big drinker, but their Blonde Beer is good. Last but not least save room for dessert!! Their freshly baked cookie with ice cream, also known as Pazookie is amazing!!"
Elaine X.,"Chino Hills, CA",145,55,47,5.0,10/8/2017,"BJ's is a go to for a classic family dinner in my household. You can't go wrong, and there is something for everyone on the menu. Came here recently for my birthday dinner and was not disappointed! Wednesday night and the wait for a party of 5 was 20 minutes, pretty packed! Here's what we ordered: MUST TRY: Tomato and Mozzarella Salad California Chicken Flatbread (good to share) Deep Dish Pizza Chicken Alfredo Pizookie!!! Standard: Shrimp and Asparagus Penne (a little sour) California Chicken Club (really smoky flavor) The pastas are pretty big portions, definitely good to share! They also have a great happy hour ($4 for BJ's House Brew Beer) and weekly deals (50% off Deep Dish Pizza Monday's and $3 Pizookie Tuesday's) BJ's is definitely on the top of my list for a weekday dinner spot.  Our server John was wonderful, but we have always received good service at this location! One time, my pizookie came out too early and they provided another one for me on the house! They truly go out of their way for you here. Definitely a happy regular!"
Steve C.,"Walnut, CA",1,80,47,1.0,10/4/2017,"So you walk into a BJs and see their beautiful bar with their bottles of alcohol proudly displayed. You ask to order the Grey Goose Mandarin that is front and center on their mantle. And what do they say?  ""No!""  Display only. Whiskey Tango Foxtrot. What bar displays a bottle of booze and doesn't let you order it. Makes no sense."
Lifes S.,"Oceanside, CA",12,17,4,1.0,9/20/2017,"Coming back from a long work week I decided to hit up the usual BJ's restaurant. Looking to grab some good food, late. Sat at the bar. Approached by William. Very nice and pleasant. He mentioned happy hour so I ordered from the specials on the menu. Asked if I can get the avocado rolls no onions (allergy) he said they were already made. So I opted for the ribs with salad - description says Siracha salad with green onions. I ordered and said no onions. Server brought the plate - I noticed the green onions on top. I immediately asked if I could get a salad with no onions and the server said sure, no problem. William said sorry I forgot. No big deal. Then William cane over and said sorry I cannot replace the salad. Apparently, on happy hour you can't get a replacement salad -  I felt this was an easy fix. Very disappointed with my experience. I can't eat onions so I was stuck with a giant salad that they couldn't replace with one I could eat. Too bad. Once I mentioned I was disappointed and was planning to leave a review William said I could get you a different salad. Really?! Why now? I said no thank you and here we are..."
Christina D.,"Chino Hills, CA",72,21,12,2.0,9/29/2017,"This is for their take out. Don't order soup, salad, or even pizza for take out. The quality is poor and the quantity is little. Below was their take on a ""bowl"" of soup. More like a super mini bowl. The pizza we got was all over the place and have the cheese was literally off to one side. So very disappointed"
Heather W.,"Chino, CA",143,3,1,2.0,10/10/2017,"I was just here tonight with my daughter. We were sitting for 20 minutes before our drink order was taken. When our food came out (I ordered the Mediterranean chicken tacos) there was no vinaigrette and the quinoa was hard and dry. I ordered a pizookie ""to go"" to bring home from my husband...when I got home it was not fresh and looked like half a pizookie! I'll attach a pic. It was definitely disappointing, we spent over $30 for the two of us and we were we're here for over an hour and a half."
Joe G.,"Eastvale, CA",407,550,5221,5.0,5/9/2017,"I had to update review after last visit. Stopped in with the family on a busy Saturday eve, including a house full of prom goers made the place much smaller. On this night my wife and I claimed our hero brews (Thanks for the donation). We also were able to claim a BOGO.  The last few visits were less than spectacular with messed up orders and kids meals taking longer than our entrees. On this night the stars aligned and Daniel our wonderful server and the team at BJs were on their A game. Drinks, appetizer and food was out in a timely manner. BJs has once again gained my confidence. Service was great. Food was great. Try the 2 bone in pork chop. Also, try the Pook Pilsner it's new to the menu. Make sure to sit in Daniel's section. Happy eating!"
Doug G.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,7,,2.0,12/3/2017,Santa Fe salad has gotten really weak. Yet another dish at corporate restaurant where they skimp on decent dish then it turns to crap. Don''t bother with any food here except maybe the pizza..Service is still ok although lapses here too.
Ashley L.,"Seattle, WA",0,4,,4.0,12/2/2017,Clint provided exceptional service. I felt like I was having dinner with my family. He made sure we always had what we needed and provided great suggestions when it came to the menu. Not all servers are like Clint. Thank you.
Piz Z.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,10,4,5.0,10/26/2017,I honestly was amazed when I visited this place the other day (for dinner) the food is delicious! It has a very fancy and elegant feel to it very comfortable environment and the waiter was so kind. I had a really good experience. Will be visiting more often.
Delilah L.,"West Covina, CA",253,138,905,5.0,3/29/2017,"Food quality, lunch specials, regular menu, kids menu and customer service are amazing! Its my second time eating at BJs and I will definitely come back! I ordered spicy brussel sprouts which is an appetizer but its quite a big portion, and three kids meal which is very generous portion for the price!"
Mai T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,33,54,3.0,10/9/2017,"Came here for bunch. Our server was very pleasant with nice smiles. We ordered breakfast. Wasn't too thrill. It took along time for us to get our food. The pancake doesn't taste good, not fluffy at all and the ham is dry.  But the breakfast pizza, was yummy."
Jay Z.,"Chino, CA",13,232,343,3.0,9/25/2016,"I've been to this location several times, about 3-4 times a year.  Last year (March 2015), I set up a surprise birthday lunch (party of 30?) for my hubby and the customer service (Chris, John, and Matt) I received was great!   A group of us went today to watch some games on a Sunday afternoon.  Just a few things to note from today's visit: - Service was ok, just average - I just noticed they serve breakfast and brunch items - The beef dip wasn't great - The chicken blt was slightly better - Lots of TVs to watch on Sunday for football Recommendations: stick to their deep dish pizzas, salads, and pizookies!"
Joe H.,"Chino Hills, CA",8,51,55,3.0,8/12/2017,"THREE stars for this local BJ's in Chino Hills. This was my first visit to this location after being a regular at the Brea location where the service is better. First off I have to say our Server was very nice and came by often to ask how we were doing once we received our food.  Here are my pros and cons about this place which I visited last night Friday 08/11 Pros:  Friendly Server Friendly Bartenders Decent parking for a Friday evening Air conditioning temp was very cool Cons: Hostess girls in front not to friendly, seem to pre occupied Hostess (s) informed us 25-30 minute wait, it took 45 minutes to be seated Once seated and ordered drinks for party of three it took TEN minutes to get our beverages Tortilla soup was barely warm, almost room temp. I've had much better. Food when brought out by another girl took long, no steak sauce or bbq sauce for ribs I can go on but I won't.... To the Manager...HIRE more Kitchen Staff especially on a busy Friday evening which is a very busy day for eating establishments. Don't pinch pennies, think of the Customers time and happiness while having the Server apologize for LONG waits. I'll be returning to BJ's sometime in the future but not this location where my three star rating is very generous!"
Yesenia L.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,4,,5.0,10/22/2017,I was here last night and I wanted to write a quick review for our waitress Rachelle!  Her service was great! I felt super welcomed and comfortable the entire time. I had a nice experience.
Rou M.,"Irvine, CA",131,340,216,4.0,11/21/2016,Parking can be tough around lunch.  Avocado egg rolls was not that great to be honest. It was soggy. The super salad was really great. Although no blueberry as listed on the menu.  Others liked their Quinoa bowls and sandwiches.  Our server was nice and attending.  I'm not a fan of big chain restaurants but this place was OK.
Chris C.,"Canyon Country, CA",18,44,13,3.0,11/26/2017,"Haven't been to BJ's in awhile, now I remember why. While the service was good and the one reason for the star rating. The steak I ordered tasted like an ashtray, I can only guess that they didn't clean the grill surface off between multiple orders. But what looked like grill marks was burnt ashes on my steak. They will need to do better."
Mrs C.,"San Diego, CA",5,4,,5.0,11/24/2017,"Compared to many BJ's restaurants we have been to, this one is a favorite when traveling on the 71. Great service and food. Nicholas F is an outstanding server."
Yemima D.,"Montclair, CA",57,31,24,4.0,4/12/2017,Yay to $3 pizookie Tuesday. I made a special trip just to get my pizookie fix. I got the traditional chocolate chip with vanilla ice cream pizookie. It was amazing.  Will definitely visit BJ every Tuesday now.
Crystal G.,"El Monte, CA",287,31,476,1.0,10/28/2017,LITERALLY THE WORST SERVICE EVER!! I got here and ordered my appetizer and my friend got Mac & cheese for her son and it came out so cold and she complained saying they'll have it out in 10 minutes and she said never mind her son was so hungry so she said I rather get fries. They still took forever for that and the waiter kept passing by us and never asked us if we wanted refills.
Brian S.,"Santa Rosa, CA",3,3,,4.0,11/25/2017,"The food, service, and the awesome beers are always the best. The wait staff are always around and ready to serve."
Glo V.,"Riverside, CA",0,10,10,1.0,11/19/2017,"We've had several bad experiences with BJs on different locations. But after trying out the location in Temecula we decided to keep giving them a try. Temecula location is always busy, however customer service is always good.  Today we decided to try the location in Chino Hills and it was by far the worst experience ever. We were a party of three, my husband, my daughter, and myself. Pretty simple order I thought, kids pizza, Bbq salad for my husband and chicken tortilla soup for myself. Well after 30 minutes our waitress finally took our order, my soup came first... so my husband told me to start eating so it wouldn't get cold. Well I finished my meal and his soup or my daughters pizza were still not here. Finally it came out, the salad was disappointing the crust onion rings were raw, literally the batter was still soggy and the onions cold! It looked like a big ball of batter just piled on the top. So we call our waitress... and she has the nerve to say ""you didn't like the texture?"" Lol!!  Umm no! I usually don't eat raw batter! So she takes it back... wait another 10 minutes. Finally it comes back looking like it should but my husband said it was very bland. We got our check and waitress still says ""oh we took off the first one you sent back"" are you serious? Omg thank you for not charging me for the mistake YOU made!  Umm yeah no more, I'll go another block and eat somewhere else next time. Poor customer service, we had to flag our waitress down several times, horrible food, and ridiculous long wait. Thanks but no thanks!"
C G.,"Corona, CA",0,12,,2.0,10/28/2017,"Bjs has gone downhill I remember it used to be my favorite restaurant now I'd like to put it on the same Level as Denny's. I went today and my server was nice but seemed in a rush. I ordered chips and dip and it came out cold. Like wow, I told her I liked my food very piping out and it still came out wrong. My silver ware were very filthy by the way (big health hazard) I end up getting food poisoning later that night. I'll never goto bjs again. They only thing they make well is the pizookie. The pizza is always bland and soggy. I'm very disappointed please don't waste your time coming to this location if you must goto bjs try another area."
Dominique B.,"Pomona, CA",132,5,,1.0,11/19/2017,"I would give zero stars if we could, the server was slow and forgot things, and the food all came out at different times. Half of us were done eating before the rest of the food came out. No manager in sight.  Thumbs down"
