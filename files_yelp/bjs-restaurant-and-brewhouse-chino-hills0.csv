Pam A.,"Seattle, WA",333,466,5654,4.0,3/4/2012,"Watch your step when being seated! BJs has great pizzas, ciders, sliders and pizookie! Make sure you ask them to bake the pizzas a little bit longer so there's a nice crisp crust and for the cheese to be completely melted. There's usually not a long wait for this location and plenty of parking."
Cynthia Q.,"Orange, CA",0,3,,5.0,4/14/2016,"If you want good food with great service you have to go to this BJ's! Make sure you go see Patrick, he will make sure your drink is always filled and will come by to make sure you're having a good dinner!"
Jaydee K.,"Pomona, CA",5,11,,1.0,1/13/2016,"Came here with my wife and son on a Tuesday nite around 9pm walk in and stood at the front desk to be seated or even greeted but no one even cared that we there stood there for 10 min I felt so dumb cause the ppl dining kept looking at us just standing there,dude really no one even cared we were there....so I just said screw this and left. Went to the Bjs in West Covina were we were seated right when we got there!"
Christina W.,"Chino Hills, CA",175,278,5231,4.0,7/13/2011,"My kids & I walked here to and from our house 1.5 mile way... I pushed our bugaboo stroller through unpaved road & farmland to get here, lol...  I'v been to BJ's in Huntington Beach and Moreno Valley and never enjoyed the food much before until today. I saw an ad over the weekend that had these entrees in the 500 calorie range that i wanted to try since I'm dieting... I ordered the Maui Glazed pork chop (547 calories) and it was awesome! Initially looking @ a entree that said Maui Glaze was a turnoff since this place is known for deep dish pizza. But the glaze was sticky & yummy & the grilled pork chop was thinly cut w. bone (perfect lunch size).  It came w grilled red onion, lil roasted red potatos and a handful of steamed string beans... The ice tea was also really good!  My daughter had a beautifully plated Chicken Parmigian  w spaghetti & a long piece of garlic bread. She really enjoyed it! ( it had about 1200 calories, though). * I'm also loving how restaurants are including nutrition info ... Can't wait to come back and share a small pizookie next time :)"
roger l.,"Diamond Bar, CA",115,238,222,4.0,1/14/2015,"I love their ahi tuna salad and the seared scallop, pizza is also great, if you are a beer lover this is the place to be!"
Karl N.,"Chino Hills, CA",30,5,,2.0,3/15/2016,The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because the drink I had was good.... That's it...  Me and my friend came her for dinner and both ordered burgers. My turkey burger was missing the mayo and the sauce. My friend asked for for no onions on her burger and it was packed with them.   The waitress did take it off the tab. My suggestion would be more so for kitchen to pay more attention I know  things can be crazy in the back but if she had been allergic to onions there would have been a major law suite against your company.  Like I said this isn't towards the waitress but the kitchen.
Brooke R.,"Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, CA",448,102,71,2.0,2/23/2014,The food never comes out hot enough and they keep it to cold in the restaurant. With all the servers that are always working you would think that they would be pretty fast. Wrong. It tajes fiercer to get your food and by the time you do it's cold. Thankfully I really only like their salads. So I'll be back
Isaac H.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",1,10,,1.0,9/5/2016,I tried ordering a keg for a future date. The staff did not know where the forms to reserve one were. This wouldn't be an issue since it is not possible for one person to know everything but the disorganization was prominent.
Jeanette L.,"Chino Hills, CA",643,46,54,5.0,9/13/2014,"Great service, quick food and fun environment.  We came as a family of 5 on a Saturday night and were seated immediately at 6pm. We all ordered something different and received our food correctly from how we ordered it. The menu also had a light section to choose from and as a Health Coach this makes me very happy with the restaurant.  :)"
Jackson N.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,3,,2.0,4/3/2016,"Generally I would give bjs a 4 star but today's experience left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Not even half full and it still took ten minutes to place drink orders. Meals came out 35 minutes after we sat down and while the two burgers were hot, the pasta dish was cold. Sent it back for a quick ""nuke"" and it came back cold again a full ten minutes later. Managers solution was ...sorry, you don't have to pay for it...which I wouldn't anyway because I had to leave. Waitress was nice."
Rollence P.,"Pasadena, CA",18,47,4,1.0,7/28/2014,"This review is for the service and not for the food. Our waiter was ""Don"" (Donald was the server name on the bill). I will refer to him as Mr. Smug.  When Mr. Smug approached us to take our drink orders, I asked him if there were any shareable salads.  ""You can share anything on the menu,"" was Mr. Smug's reply. Really? I did not know that. Thank you for enlightening me.  For those of you who don't know, BJ's menu is as thick as a user manual for an electronic device. I figured that the waiter would be more knowledgeable and would save us time with a recommendation since I only saw small side salads while there were ""shareable appetizers."" He finally directed me to an area in the menu that served salads as an entree which would be bigger than the other salads that I was looking at. See, it wasn't that difficult.  Right, Mr. Smug?  When he brought our drinks over, he proceeded to throw the coasters on the table like he was dealing a deck of cards minus the accuracy and finesse. When one person from my party started to move her coaster closer toward herself, Mr. Smug started ""Hey, hey why are you moving the coaster farther away from me? I have to reach over now!"" I thought he was joking because we were a party of four in a booth (Yeah, I know. LARGE party). And Mr. Smug appeared to be at least as tall, if not taller than me at 6'2"". Long reach. If he was trying to be a comedian, then he needs to keep his day job. Wait, this IS his day job. Hmmm... After we finished our mains, the table was clear and we were ready for dessert. Mr. Smug comes by and places the check at our table. I didn't ask for the check. And the dessert did not come with him. I then mentioned to him that we still have dessert on the way.  ""I know."" He said. Awkward pause.  I then mentioned that I didn't ask for the check and since he ""knew"" we weren't finished eating, then why bring the check?  ""So you don't feel comfortable with the check at your table right now?"" Mr. Smug asked.  Another awkward pause as I am still holding the check up in the air for him to take it, ""Ah, I would like the check when we are finished eating. Thanks."" He then proceeded to mention that during lunch, they tend to bring the check earlier because some people are in a rush because it is their business lunch hour etc. We were wearing shorts, t-shirts and flip-flops. I guess that screamed ""We are in a rush to get back to work!""  ""Do you bring the check even before all courses have been served?"" I asked.  ""Yeah, for lunch it's policy."" Mr. Smug replied. ""Wait, so during lunch, bringing the check before are all courses are served is policy?"" I verified. ""Yeah."" Mr. Smug said.  That seemed strange.  After our meal and our check, I spoke to the manager asked about this ""policy."" To credit her management skills, she was lovely and not defensive at all and somewhat apologetic. She mentioned that the wait staff can opt to bring the check earlier if they ""read"" the customers might be in a rush.  ""The check can be brought either with or after the last course."" (paraphrasing what she said).  I asked, is it ""policy"" to bring the check before all courses are served?"" ""No. It is not policy. There is no policy for that. The servers need to 'read' their customers."" She replied.  I told her that Mr. Smug's tone towards me and my family was somewhat disprespectful. And he could have answered all of my questions in a different way, but he chose the snarky path instead. She wanted to offer me coupons, but I don't see how that could correct the situation, so I kindly declined. What she failed to do was to mention what she would do about my concerns with Mr. Smug's service. I don't want him out of a job. That's not my goal especially in this economy. Just treat people with decency. That's all. After reading some of the other reviews regarding customer service, I guess I am not an anomaly. Fortunately, Chino Hills has a lot of restaurants to choose from."
Cat R.,"Ontario, CA",67,106,544,4.0,11/15/2014,"I always come here for their lunch specials. Tonight however came for dinner. First review on the service: My service tonight was incredible  And considering its a busy Saturday night! I was given attention to- with water, clearing my plates and also because I signed up for the rewards  received a free pazookie dessert. Food quality- Clam chowder was perfect temperature and so was calamari, pizza was also yummy and tried their Fritos nachos which was pretty delicious. I was a bit disappointed with their ahi poke-  Sad to say I think something changed and find the yard house version a little bit more to my liking  Will return just won't order the ahi"
Carolyn C.,"San Diego, CA",46,106,66,3.0,2/23/2015,Was able to bring in a girls softball team and a bunch of parents and they were able to seat all 30 of us at once.   Parking is tough as there are other busy places right around the same area. Food was good and came out relatively quickly for a large group.  We did want to split the check and that part was the only negative and the reason for my three stars versus four.  They had us do one large check then try to denote who's was who's and then split it out - it took over 35 minutes to get that to happen.  I recommend not trying this here and some how dividing your large party differently when you have the orders taken as it was a mess.  Not the servers fault as he was helpful but it just honestly took way too long All the kids were happy with their kids meals and the portions and flavors of the adult meals really hit the spot after a long day of softball.
Schel H.,"Greater Los Angeles, CA",658,1756,1544,3.0,12/27/2012,"I came here to meet up with a bunch of friends to talk football and hang out. We got a large table and ended up having a great time.  The best part of the night was when the waitress came around asking for drink orders. Without looking up at her since she was behind me I asked for a blonde and all of my friends started to laugh their asses off. I then turned and looked to find a young 20 something blonde waitress blushing like crazy. Great laughs ensued and she was definitely caught off guard... but ended up laughing as well.  Pro Tip: This location is very loud without any segregation or walled off areas making it very loud. The drinks were tasty as the beer always is at BJs. The food was average, nothing special to note. we were all satisfied but nothing was great. Very fair to middelin shall we say. The facility was clean as you would expect for a restaurant like this. There is a ton of parking surrounding this restaurant as well."
Brandon S.,"Chino Hills, CA",590,223,187,4.0,11/5/2014,"I come here to hang with friends sometimes. Perfect if a game is on since the bar is right there in front of a few huge big screens. Haven't really indulged into their happy hour menu yet, but they do have a good selection of house beers on tap. The Red is pretty amazing, and if you want something syrupy around 10%, go for the Tatonka stout. Their spaghetti here is pretty damn good and so are the nachos. The few things I would change with this place (which probably isn't possible with the current layout) - their bar area needs to be a lot bigger. It takes a good 20 minutes of waiting sometimes to be able to snag a seat up on that level. I would also suggest they do what Yardhouse does and rotate some local micro brews through their selection of beers on tap. This place doesn't tend to get as crowded as the local Yardhouse, so maybe a good alternative on Friday and Saturday night."
Preeti M.,"Atlanta, GA",178,380,158,3.0,12/29/2014,"Super fun spot, as always.  Chose this place due to kids in our party.  The pizza is always on point as is the pizookie dessert (highly recommend the peanut butter!).   The 3 stars is due to the service/bad wine: The only turn off was the wine...we got the Estancia wine and for some reason the waiter already corked it before arriving at the table (first he messed up by brining us two individual glasses of wine instead of the bottle and two glasses like I asked).  A bit odd if the wine is already corked and the waiter does not let you taste it first.  The wine sucked, just FYI...pay a bit more and get the La Crema Pinot if you are in the red mood.  The waiter claimed the wine was the most popular red BUT again, it arrived corked, he didn't pour for a taste as he should have and it tasted funky.  We had kids with us and it was hectic so I did not send it back."
Mindie P.,"Chino, CA",54,1,,5.0,10/11/2015,Came in for drinks with my girl friends after work and the service was great and the manager Ryan was great as well. We were well taken care of for a busy Friday night during football season.
Tutu N.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,33,2,4.0,11/21/2014,Update:  Tiffany from BJ's reached out to me privately to better understand the horrible experience we had.  I appreciate her taking the the time to address our concerns and ensuring us with a better dining service during our next visit.
Jose D.,"Chino, CA",33,43,1,4.0,3/7/2016,"Food is amazing, if you have the money it's great, if you don't be prepared to pay a hefty price."
Lena K.,"Chino Hills, CA",116,123,152,4.0,10/22/2014,"I love BJ's!!  No matter what location BJ's is just fun & delicious.  Of course the Chino Hills location is one of the best!  I love it because there's ample parking, it's a decent size & it's in a plaza where you can go grab a frozen yogurt if you decide not to indulge in the most amazing pizooki in the world!  Hint: try the pizooki!!! My recommendations are: 1) Jambalaya 2) Pizza w/ chicken (side of ranch) 3) flatbread pizzas 4) samosas 5) pizooki!  6) beer Great for birthday dinners too!"
