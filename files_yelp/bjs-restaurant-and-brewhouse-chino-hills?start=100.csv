L E.,"Chino Hills, CA",59,133,524,4.0,10/29/2016,"Celebrated a friend's birthday here. Food was good, nice ambience, clean place and friendly servers. Can't go wrong with their pizzas and pasta. Always a hit with my family."
Thuc L.,"Pomona, CA",93,6,5,5.0,1/28/2017,David was hella cool and made the experience here fun. Second time having him and he was great. Try getting him with a big party and he'll make it tight.
Al P.,"Rochester, NY",200,134,134,5.0,6/16/2016,Deep dish pizzas were spot on and the service was nice. Quick seating but it was a week day. Pizzooki was great. It'd be nice to see more variety in their deep dish pizza for the futurr
Rho L.,"Chino Hills, CA",4015,1071,1568,3.0,6/11/2014,"My cousin had made a reservation for a large group last night (for his birthday) and somehow, BJ's didn't take the correct info down and essentially didn't book the reso. Mind you, It was also graduation night. That basically entailed they would need to wait an hour and a half for a reservation they thought was booked, and BJ's offered him a free a dessert. Fortunately, myself, my daughter and my hubbs2b decided to come earlier because we wanted to eat earlier and would join the larger party later on.  We were seated within 10 minutes and our server was quick and accommodating.  We ordered a small meat lovers pizza, mozarella sticks, corn fritters, mahi mahi, mac and cheese, mini burgers, yes for three of us.   With exception to the mac and cheese which is usually spot on and the fitters which were interesting in a positive way, the rest of our food was meh at best -- even the pizza!!  Given my slight disappointment in the meal itself, that was somewhat rectified by the new addition to their pizookie line up -- the salted caramel version. We got one of those and a chocolate chip pizookie which my beau loves.  Our pizookies were sinfully delicious as always. Love the salty sweet in that salted caramel tin of heaven.  So really at the end of the day, I still would only come for pizookies."
Asseret B.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,12,1,5.0,2/16/2017,"So me and my family had some late night cravings, and it was my mom's birthday so I decided to take the family to BJs. It was busy and my mom really didn't want to wait and we were debating sitting at the bar. A server came up to us and said we would give us the best service if we sat in in his section at the bar so we decided why not. Usually when you sit in a restaurants bar section, the service isnt the best but David M kept to his word and gave us amazing service. He went over and beyond. I will definitely be back and i suggest to anyone who comes to ask for him."
Kathy L.,"Chino Hills, CA",108,9,1,4.0,4/4/2016,"Food is great. I don't really stick to just one item menu when I come here, but I do recommend the flat bread pizza or the ribs. Their BBQ sauce is really good, it's on the sweet side which I love. I'm not one to drink soda, but my bf always gets the root beer and I have a few sips, it's really good. It's nice and cold and has just the right amount of sweetness and carbonation. Desserts are where it's at here, their pizookies are the main reason I love coming here. Love getting a chocolate chip pizookie with vanilla ice cream on top :) Sometimes service is a bit slow, but the servers are friendly for the most part."
Charles B.,"Pomona, CA",93,33,9,4.0,1/15/2017,"There was a bit of a wait for our food, but everything tasted great. Our waiter was very attentive."
Raelene T.,"Rialto, CA",109,3,,1.0,10/30/2016,"I had a terrible experience at this location......... our server's name was MEGAN. she RARELY stopped by our table, we only got ONE refill, and when we asked her something she made it seem like a problem. it took us almost an hour to get our check..."
Joey P.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",2,7,,4.0,2/17/2017,"Okay so first off, when I got here everything was perfect, they seated us, took our order and brought us our food. Everything was great! They even would refill our waters every time we needed it. Then I kindly asked our waiter for some lemons to go with my fish and chips, he seemed fine. After three times of him revisiting and me reminding him, he never brought me the lemons. I just have to say that it almost ruined my meal. Really took me off guard"
Hugo M.,"Chino, CA",204,116,95,1.0,3/8/2016,"Worst service.  Came in to celebrate my brother's birthday with a party of 10. Our server was GRACE M. From the start, she had an attitude. Barely smiled. Just didn't seem like she wanted to serve us. She would drop off our waters, like literally drop it on the table.  We waited for 25-30 minutes for our food. Then the food came. My cousin ordered a Medium Pizza, they came out with a mini. He ordered a small to make up for the medium, that took another 20-30 mins to come out. I ordered a Black and Blue Burger, medium rare. Presentation for this burger was terrible. My burger came out well done without bacon. I had to find out myself that it had no bacon. Then the GRACE M. came up to me, telling there is no bacon, they will bring out later. It never came.  I decided to send the burger back. GRACE M. never offered me something else to eat. It took a manager to come up to me and offer me something else. But I was not going to wait another 20-30 minutes. Overall, the experience was terrible because of our waitress, GRACE M. Her attitude just showed she did not want to be there. Either you stay home or you put a smile on your face and provide the service you are suppose to give."
Dillon G.,"Chino, CA",65,69,101,4.0,10/12/2015,I would say I get good service 75% of the time. Always get sat quickly and never wait very long. Unless it's a Friday or Saturday night because it's always a wait.  The chicken Parmasan is my go to meal because it's always on point!  Also recommend the bread bowls with soup and salad. Tomatoe and mozzarella salad is great. Pizza is very good and the pazooki!
Elizabeth P.,"Monrovia, CA",201,214,160,4.0,9/8/2015,"Friendly staff, yummy food. Nice ambience inside. Would come again"
Michaela B.,"Chino Hills, CA",598,56,101,3.0,6/22/2015,"BJ's would always be a go-to place to celebrate birthday dinners. We actually haven't been to a BJ's in a while, but decided to celebrate a birthday here tonight. I'm not sure what time they close, but service was slow tonight. I can tell the server is kinda in a rush, but 20 minutes pass... And he hasn't been back to the table.  Food is still good. The pizza we got was the Great White. Crust isn't crispy like it usually was back then.  Overall, still a good place to go. & beer is a 5 star as always!"
Tracy M.,"Whittier, CA",77,29,17,2.0,3/10/2016,"I've been getting takeout from here once a week for the last 5 months... I was pregnant craving a specific dish everytime... The take out people there are horrible. I've complained so many times. They leave things out, gave my husband someone else's order, and don't get the orders correct. Today I received a burnt cookie! I can't believe they would give this to someone!"
Jake M.,"Layton, UT",75,20,1,5.0,1/13/2017,"We have been here so many times, we were kinda obsessed. I wish they had these in Utah! This location was the best we went to by far. Great service and chefs. Amazing variety for the whole gang! Definitely recommend!"
Diana k.,"Chino Hills, CA",31,49,44,4.0,5/5/2016,"We celebrated my father's birthday over lunch. Our server was awesome! Food is served in really large portions, so come hungry. I had the black and blue burger, requested medium, arrived extra well done. Looked insurmountable, until I took off the top bun - much more manageable without it. I also requested avocado, which really made this burger the bomb.  No wait time, super friendly servers, overall a really great experience. Parking, on the other hand, is a pain."
Michele G.,"Chino Hills, CA",156,20,2,1.0,10/1/2017,"Came here tonight hoping to end the weekend on a good note, but was let down (to put it nicely). Patrick, our waiter, started off the evening nice by taking our order almost immediately. My boyfriend and I ordered avocado egg rolls, the 5 piece ribs, and fish and chips. The first sign of a problem with our order was when they brought out an extra appetizer of avocado egg rolls. We thought they just brought the extra ones to the wrong table and didn't think much else of the situation. (Patrick put in 2 orders of egg rolls instead of egg rolls and my ribs). My boyfriend's food came out, he finished eating, and I still hadn't gotten my food (an hour after he got his food). We aren't the kind of people to make a fuss about something not going our way, but were pretty upset when we told Patrick that I still hadn't gotten my ribs and he nonchalantly replied, ""Oh, I might have forgotten to put those in. Let me check on that. If they're in the back do you want me just to box them for you?"" Umm....what?! He comes back and said, ""Yeah, sorry. That was my fault. I forgot to put those in. Do you want me to put those in now?"" My boyfriend cut in and said we'd just be going. Patrick asked if we'd like to get a dessert. Thanks for the offer? But no! At that point, my boyfriend and I were pretty irritated by the lack of remorse. He didn't even offer to talk to his manager about it. Long(er) story short, we spoke to the manager who probably cared less than Patrick, and we left to get me fast food since it was already almost 9pm and I was, as you can imagine, extremely hungry by this point."
Karen M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",2,9,,5.0,12/22/2016,"I am seriously loving this place so much, I could eat here every night! Everything we have ordered has been delicious and the service has been awesome! I recommend the California Chicken Club sandwich with a side of fruit and with a bowl of clam chowder, it's incredible! I also recommend signing up for their VIP app. It's free and comes with many perks. Keep up the great work!"
Amanda N.,"Chino Hills, CA",154,8,,1.0,3/28/2017,"I came in with a couple of friends for a drink and some appetizers an hour before closing. I understand it was late but the waitress was so incredibly rude! We were polite and asked her how her day was, she quickly said fine and asked for our order, we ordered. She never came back to check on us or ask if we wanted refills-not even when our food came out. Finally she came back told us we missed last call (maybe we wouldn't have if she was taking care of us) and dropped off the check. Mind you the entire time we were there, it was clear a fellow employee was celebrating their birthday also in the bar because that's where she was the whole time! We paid and left. It didn't sit well with me so I called and spoke with a manager a day or two later, he said he would address the issue and call me back, he never called! It was a very disappointing experience."
Kristi E.,"Chino, CA",0,9,1,5.0,5/7/2016,"My husband and I wanted to take his parents for dinner. We were celebrating my father-in-laws birthday and Mother's Day. We knew it would be a busy day. There were a lot of people waiting for a table and thought we'd have to wait a long time, but we sat within 10-15 mins. Our server, DJ, was on it. He had many big tables to take care of, but I never felt neglected. I drink about 5 glasses of water when I eat, and he never failed to refill. The food arrived within 10 mins and everything came perfect. Ryan the manager came by to see how we were doing and I noticed him checking on other tables too. It always nice to see a manger involved and even willing to help the servers. We had no leftovers and no complaints other then being too stuffed for dessert....Well my father-in-law had his birthday poozokie and that was amazing! Bjs is a nice place to celebrate and we will be back again!"
