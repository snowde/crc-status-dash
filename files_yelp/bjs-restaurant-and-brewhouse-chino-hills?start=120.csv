Rosita D.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,15,2,3.0,5/7/2016,"Enjoying dinner  with family,  so we  thought. We waited for at least 45 minutes  to be seated. Then more than 15 minutes  for our drink order  to be taken . We placed our order and although our server was very nice he  had too tables. Prople seatwd after us were serve at least 10 minutes before us. . Our dinner took over 35 minutes after we ordered. Feeling irritated. On a positive  note the Manager Ryan must have noticed our long faces and came by our table and asked what he could dovto inprove oyr service.  Feeling  grateful, thank you Ryan."
Oscar C.,"Orlando, FL",90,36,149,1.0,3/7/2016,"This is the worst bjs I've ever been. We came to celebrate my cousins birthday and our server Grace had the worst attitude ever. Food was late, over cooked and the manager wasn't helpful at all. Hey guys if you don't wanna take large parties just tell us and we will go to another BJs."
M F.,"Chino Hills, CA",328,17,5,2.0,4/10/2016,"Contrary to popular belief, BJ's pizza is not all that appetizing. Went here for dinner and was less than pleased. Ordered the New California Deep Dish Pizza and was not satisfied. The pizza was very dry and they were far from generous with the toppings.  Good service, but the food is less than great. Definitely will recommend the pizookie and their homemade cream soda & root beer though. :)"
Paulina G.,"Rowland Heights, CA",217,29,13,2.0,2/19/2016,"We usually come here every now and then but today's visit was okay. I found out that they don't offer the $5.50 Bacon Mac & Cheese and no more red velvet pazookie.  Here's what we ordered: Quinoa with salmon: looked like something that could be made anywhere else Parmesan crusted chicken: they really skipped out on the portions tonight... The chicken was good but it tasted like it had been sitting there because it was no longer crispy or hot.  Kids cheeseburgers: they forgot to put the cheese.. So we had to ask for cheese but when they brought it my siblings couldn't eat it because it was basically cold cheese. Strawberry lemonade: I couldn't taste any fruit, it was basically expensive red water.  Pazookie: -Oreo: tasted good it had no hints of Oreo but it was essentially chocolate pazookie with vanilla ice cream -white chocolate macadamia nut: first of all, it wasn't cooked all the way; they messed up and put caramel and dark chocolate on top -triple chocolate: don't even order this one, it's disgustingly chocolately that you can't even eat it  *dont order pazookies from here: we didn't complain because we knew they won't do anything to make it right  Service was alright. The waitress wasn't friendly or anything. When we told her it was my sister's birthday, she just said oh. The boys waiter are super nice and apologetic for the mishaps."
Steve R.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,25,,1.0,9/10/2016,"The best menu of anywhere we eat but the worst drinks ever,  Shame on them. If you don;t drink, it's a great place.  If you drink when you go out, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!!!!!!' We ordered Mai Tai's.  Usually a strong drink and NOTHING.  The manager must be proud of their useless bartender.  I will never go back.  If you drink, go somewhere else!  Do you know how much it costs to make a drink!  Less than $1 and they charge $8.You should not go here."
Jessi S.,"Chino, CA",60,3,,5.0,12/18/2016,"So I just went to this BJ's tonight with my parents and long story but 6 days ago our house caught on fire and it started in my room and I lost everything, not only is it almost Christmas but my birthday is also tomorrow so we went their to eat dinner and my mom went up to the waitress Lindsey to ask if they did anything for birthdays and explained what happened and let her know that my birthday is actually tomorrow but I needed a pick me up and she had so much compassion and explained everything to the manager, I believe her name is Elizabeth, and they offered to pay for our meals and gave us desert and everything. It really made our night and we were so thankful for their kindness. At the end of the night Lindsey even gave all of us a hug. All in all the workers were so kind to us and I would recommend this place to anyone."
Garland J.,"Chino, CA",65,3,6,1.0,2/15/2017,"just had the worst steak in my life people, first it was cold , looked like chicken omg , oh your sorry dam right your sorry cook,waiter an all , i'm out,,   ^%$#@*"
Nijole T.,"Los Angeles, CA",3080,6372,5149,3.0,12/17/2014,"Not really a fan of BJ's, we met some friends here and wound up having a descent time. It gets pretty full, also pretty loud inside, not meant for a romantic date, that's for sure. We kept it simple and shared a deep dish pizza, the meats and it was pretty good. I think pizza is the way to go here, had a few hits or misses, but I really enjoyed the crust, though it's pretty pricey ($25) Service was fine, they were busy so we didn't see her much, wouldn't go out of my way to come back, but it was fine."
Melissa V.,"Newport Beach, CA",229,116,45,3.0,3/11/2016,I will update this review only because the manager Matt reached out to me to apologize for the lack of service. I really appreciate when a location wants to right their lack of service.  Original: Wow absolutely terrible! We sat for 20 minutes without even someone coming to offer us water! Normally I love this chain but this location has gone downhill. We went around 1 on a Sunday and it was full but had lots of open tables. Three servers in our section and not one of them even looked at us.
Kat H.,"Pomona, CA",23,218,431,4.0,2/22/2016,Bjs is a go anytime anywhere kinda place but really it's a decently nice place.  Open til midnight and maybe even later on the weekends.  Half off small pizzas at the bar late on Mondays.... That's why I'm here. They have just about everything and have a very nice lighter calorie menu.
Maya S.,"Pomona, CA",8,7,3,1.0,7/31/2016,I have been sitting here with my good friend waiting to be greeted by a server for about 18min now. We have watched 3 separate groups come in & even get drinks & other assistance. Multiple waitresses have walked by us and no one has said a thing. This is UNACCEPTABLE.  I have often frequented this location & have never been treated in such a way. I will NOT be coming back & I will make sure that everyone in this area that I know from corona to chino hills and more know about our terrible experience. This is not okay.
Yadira D.,"Chino, CA",0,10,,5.0,5/12/2017,"This is one of my favorite restaurants! I love how I can come and have a good time with my friends and family. Their pizzas are amazing specially their pepperoni one. I also love how they have a bar, and if you want to go out to a nice place to drink Bjs is good"
Mike F.,"Twin Lakes, WI",43,51,245,5.0,2/29/2016,"Good service, actually it was awesome service! Kayti was walking by every few minutes checking,  and making sure I had everything. She didn't ""bother"" me when I was eating, she only asked when she knew I was able to talk (when not stuffing my face with food). The food was good, the Beer was better. Try the new roasted barbacoa chicken! It healthy and good tasting!!!"
Christa K.,"Tustin, CA",179,86,45,1.0,7/18/2016,"Went there for dinner to celebrate but from start to finish it was horrible! Waited 10 minutes to wave down a hostess to get a server to come get drink orders, then asked 3 different servers to get mothers salad Bc it was forgotten. Drinks were all empty and the food didn't taste that great. The jambalaya was full of sauce and oil!!!"
Jessica L.,"Chino, CA",762,199,98,3.0,10/21/2014,"BJ's...Your Pazooki is fire in my mouth.  I just love hot cookie and ice cream, who doesn't?! It's gets busy, I mean really busy to the point your server disappears for a long while.  The ground underneath the tables will have old black napkins, straws, silverware...just a bunch of garbage.  I guess it's hard to keep clean when everyone is packed into the restaurant.  They try to fit you anywhere they can fit you. The food is good but I come for the beer selection and other drinks.  The pumpkin ale, I wish had a little more spice to it!  The big kids menu is more than enough food for your little one for $6!    Thank you BJ's for making it fun to watch my Vikings lose every damn game while sipping on a tall blonde.  Ha."
Steve P.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,19,,2.0,1/16/2017,"This place was really average. The menu is huge so there is something for everyone, unfortunately the food just isn't that good, maybe it's a situation where if you focus on everything you're not so good at anything. I ordered a chicken salad and it was blah, I also ordered an appetizer nachos and again, BLAH. Nothing special food wise or service wise. There is a BBQ joint next door or wood ranch down the road that I would recommend over BJs."
Jay K.,"Fullerton, CA",23,24,31,1.0,6/14/2015,Not satisfied Bad service and poor quality cook Need more training every staff. More thinking about come back again or not...
Justin W.,"Chino, CA",0,4,,5.0,10/30/2016,Great service and great food our waiter was amazing  good job. David M was very polite and courteous.
Christian R.,"Chino, CA",32,1,,5.0,10/30/2016,Best service from David M. Such a good employee 10/10. The food was amazing. All together it was good. Im coming back for sure.
Lina S.,"Diamond Bar, CA",169,16,,1.0,12/6/2016,"Restaurants get busy. I understand. I've worked in a fast paced restaurant, but this place is ridiculous.  Took the server 7 minutes JUST TO COME TAKE OUR DRINK ORDER. The restaurant is pretty full but this dining quality is just disappointing. My whole table of six has dirty silverware (my NAPKIN had crusted on food on it) with someone else's food still stuck on them. Took them LITERALLY 20 mins(I timed them) to bus the table behind us. 28 mins for food to come out. Deep dish pizza isn't   should be piping hot and the one we got was just warm. Its like they left it out on a counter for 10 mins. Not even the pan it came in was hot. california supreme pizza is supposed to have pineapples in it...haven't found a single pineapple in this pizza yet.....wings are dry too.. we had 2 rice dishes and the rice was chewy and hard..honestly disappointed in their food and service tonight. This is sad. It's like they weren't expecting to have customers today lol"
