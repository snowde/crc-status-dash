Deena I.,"Chino Hills, CA",112,6,2,2.0,5/21/2016,"My family and I had a dinner tonight at BJs in Chino Hills it was for a party of 8. This all happened on 21st of May on a Saturday night. First the hostess at the front stated the wait will be half hour and this was 7:38pm and we got seated at 8:42om.  Our waitress is Kristen T.  When we ordered appetizer ""calamari"" the portions were much smaller.  Our waitress Kristen said the portions are made smaller because the customers don't finish the calamari.  Then we got our Dinner we ordered the cherry chipotle glazed Salmon.  Now this dish I usually order all the time.  My cousin tried this dish as well.  When the other server gave us our dish,  I noticed and was also surprised that it was half the portion.  So I got the menu and compared our meals to the picture from the menu, and it was truly less than half the size.  I also explained to my family I usually always order this and that this is the first time I had it like this and so small.  So when Kristen our waitress came by I had asked her did they also make this dinner smaller too?  Kristen said that the portions are the same but used a different dish.  So I let Kristen know I usually order this and no never had it served like tonight.  She replied I will let my manager know about your meal.  So minutes after Roxy introduced herself, and she asked about our meals so I had  explained to her about the portions of our salmon.  Roxy responded and said I wish I saw your meal and what can she do?  I replied to her that she should let her cooks know that they're not making the right portions for this dinner.  So she apologized and walked away.  Than Kristen came with the bill and let us know they charged us half for the two salmon dishes.  I started writing this review and another manger Ryan approached us, and he said he sees I'm doing a review and he asked how many people follow me, and I said many.  I explained again everything again and he asked me what can he do to make it up to us?  I replied to him that the bill has been paid and that my family member paid it already, & that I felt we shouldn't of been charged for   the salmon dishes. he took off both the salmon dishes. Overall BJs made up for their mistakes but let's hope they don't cheat other customers the portions of their meal, and the managers should of address this situation correctly and right away.  Why should anyone have to write a review to get things corrected, or base on how many followers.  I will go back to BJ's and hope this cook, or cooks don't make the same mistakes, and that the portions of the appetizer are made less because customers don't finish the appetizer dishes.  Based on waitress Kristen T excuse for the portions of their appetizers."
Devin J.,"Fontana, CA",12,22,26,3.0,5/1/2015,"Decided to come here with a group of friends after having an amazing dinner because we wanted dessert. When we walked in we weren't greeted because there was no one at the hostess station (odd). Stood there for a good 3 minutes before being approached, and we're finally seated.  A waitress finally came to our table and we all knew what we wanted; pizookies. While talking to the waitress we learned very quickly that she had a sarcastic attitude. (sidenote: we're a cool group of ppl we can take a joke and all have a sense of humor.) But for whatever reason she kept coming at my friend, a female, for no reason. It was to the point where my friend asked us, 3 guys 1 girl, did she come at the waitress a certain way or was every statement/question that was made valid, and if she (my friend) had an attitude? Needless to say we reassured her that she did nothing wrong and that it was the waitress... Finally our pizookies came. These were great! I had the trio: salted caramel, chocolate chunk, and triple chocolate! PERFECTION. To be honest this was an overload and probably could have put me in a diabetic coma lol.  All in all the food was great which is what we came for, but me working in the customer service industry I usually expect a lot when it comes to service. I feel that you have to feel a group of ppl out before you can do/say certain things to them."
Watchman K.,"Corona, CA",82,94,566,4.0,2/6/2015,"Due to parking!  If you can navigate through the parking lot with out an accident and actually find parking your off to a good time.   This place is always jammed packed, so pack some patients because it's going to be a while. Food and drinks are great so that makes up it all worth it."
Ignacio E.,"El Monte, CA",9,21,13,5.0,2/3/2016,"First time at this location. Service was awesome, food was great. Will definitely come here again. I highly recommend it to all my friends and family. I had called ahead to reserve a table for my guest and I, Tanner the manager picked up the phone and was very helpful and courteous. All staff is on point with the customer service they give. Thanks again Tanner for the help. -Iggy"
Minnie B.,"Orange, CA",325,27,23,4.0,2/2/2016,This is our late night go to place. Service is good so far sometimes the service is mediocre. Anyhow ordered some lemon peppered wings and Brussel sprouts. The food is always good regardless of the service.
Stephanie G.,"Chino, CA",20,36,7,5.0,5/16/2016,"Ryan goes above and beyond to make your BJ's experience a quality meal.  He takes pride in his store, personnel and the food.  BJ's does all they can to give back to the community; partnering with local elementary schools for donations and fundraising opportunities.  BJ's even acknowledges academic success by providing awards/kid's meal certificates to schools for students.  I am so grateful to have this amazing business in our Chino/Chino Hills community."
Paul A.,"Walnut, CA",27,20,7,1.0,12/13/2016,"I'm so disappointed in this place. I come to this particular location all the time. I bring people here, I tell people to come here, and I was let down big time. I tried to make a reservation a week before the actual day. I called on a Sunday for the following Friday, and was told to call back Wednesday at the earliest. I didn't wait because this was a large reservation for a really important meeting with lots of people coming from all over town. I called on Tuesday. To my surprise when I call I'm told the restaurant is fully booked for the whole weekend. When I explain what happened, I'm told that my story couldn't be possible. I'm redirected to a manager who then tells me that she was at the restaurant on Sunday and wasn't told of any phone call and she can't really do anything about it.  I understand her dilemma but now have learned that this location is unreliable and lacks proper communication. Hope this helps sometime trying to book for a party any larger than 8."
Jessie K.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,6,,5.0,3/30/2017,Pizza is excellent. They have great service there. I always love to eat pizzuki. Wish could give it more than 5 stars.
Amanda H.,"Bozeman, MT",0,5,,1.0,12/13/2016,"Such disappointment. It's been years since I have been to a BJs...cause I moved and they don't have them where I live...but, I couldn't wait to relive the deep dish, sizzling, crunchy crust pizza. Person I was with didn't want pizza, so I ordered a personal size one and it was half off cause of happy hour.  But, it was only semi warm and delivered on a plate, worse, the dough wasn't good and soggy.  We ate it cause we were hungry and it was the best tasting dish on the table...so not saying much for the rest of the dishes....Management came to the table when we told our waiter it wasn't so good, when he asked us how it was. She told us that they changed the recipe of the dough , but are still baked in the molds, just taken out to be placed on the plates...I would like to know if this is really the case. It really tasted more like a frozen, thawed out bread that had been placed on a conveyor system and top got heated, but not the center or bottom... She didn't offer anything after visiting the table. Some things that are done well shouldn't be changed, concerning food or service...Won't ever go back to BJs...."
Zaneen T.,"Chino, CA",0,13,,1.0,11/22/2016,"Have been coming to the  Bj's in chino hills parkway for over 5 years. Hve never had a bad experience until tonight.  The waitress was attentive and apologetic for the horrible food.  I ordered the shrimp asparagus penne pasta and I was brought penne pasta with diced green bell peppers.  Lol. I don't even think they hve that on the menu.  Also, my little ones food was cold. ..the manager came put and apologized and I was given my correct order, however, the pasta was bland and very soggy.  I usually order this dish and the jambalaya and have not once had a problem with it.  I don't know if the cook is having a bad day or just doesn't care or what it is.   Am extremely disappointed with tonight's food.  If it wasn't for the fact that I come here often, then  I wouldn't ever come here again."
Maria D.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,17,2,3.0,8/13/2016,"Kitchen forgot part of the order.  Meal, appetizer and salad came all at once.  Server was frustrated and we felt bad for her.  Food was just ok.  Manager comp'd our appetizer, but we sent it back anyway. Calamari should never be soft out of the fryer, lol. It's a shame, we like the bar area, but disappointing table experience."
Wendy O.,"Chino Hills, CA",5,13,6,5.0,1/10/2016,"We love this place. Service is wonderful, food and the device is great. I have been a regular for over 4 years and have never had a bad experience here. The only food item I did not like was the ribeye, but just because the cut of meat was a bit fatty for my taste. The management keeps thing running smooth and if you ever have a problem, they come right over.  Overall great food and friendly service is why I come back."
OldSchool IE ..,"Chino Hills, CA",1,23,48,3.0,11/30/2014,"If this was a few years or so back, BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse would have been 5*.   Today at most 3* and this why: 1.  Although the Chino Hills location is newer compared to Covina, Covina used to have brew operations.  If correct, many BJ locations a few years back brewed on site.  This is no longer the case.  Now, all beer is shipped in from a single location. Understanding this was a business decision, it thwarted the local brewers ability to make many great ""one-off"" offerings.  I remember getting a beer that may only be brewed in Covina for example.   Local brewers would experiment with different concoctions which is no longer the case.   Chino Hills (which did not brew) may be the closest location to me, but it was the unique offerings that led me to go out to Covina and other locations.  I actually enjoyed visiting multiple BJ's within the region.   2.  BJ's KILLED their happy hour menu about a year ago.    One thing that my family enjoyed about Happy Hour was they had a solid happy hour menu with great offerings, portions, and price.   This is not longer the case with a menu change last year with many items we've enjoyed scratched!  Also portions were cut down to size with price increases. 3.  About a year ago, BJ's took away my NUMBER ONE ITEM I LOVED ON THE MAIN MENU; the Open Face Chili Burger with wedge cut fries! If not visiting BJ's for Happy Hour and resorting to the main menu, I always got the open face Chili Burger.  The Piranha Ale made Chili was ""BOMB.COM!""  The only time I can get chili now is during lunch with the Giant Stuffed Potato or in a Sourdough bowl.  Both very good, but it's not the same as having that open faced chili burger I loved so much. All these changed happened right when the Chino Hills location got up and running.  I recall the server in Chino Hills stating that Chino Hills was a test place for the so called ""CRAPPY"" new and more healthier menu.  BJ's wanted to change their image ... personally I don't know why?   Maybe they wanted more of a wine crowd. Ok, on to today... my family and I frequent BJ's at least once a month (used to be 5-6/month) mainly for a change up from other now better gastropubs and the seasonal beer offerings which two of my favorites are the Pumpkin Ale and Grand Cru.   I can drink their Grand Cru daily; it's that good if into Belgian style of beers.  Their pumpkin is always solid, but since going to consolidated brewing I recall one year they had it forever while another another they ran out fast and we missed it. Consolidated brew operations don't bother me as much the menu change last year.   It's really the menu change; especially happy hour menu, that caused my family not to frequent BJ's as much as we used to.   As I write this, I still can't believe they killed what was an awesome happy hour as well taking the open chili face burger off the menu to make way for more healthier items.   When drinking a good beer, I want hearty good beer food.  With that menu change they should be making wine instead of beer; seriously! Bring back the OLD BJs!   Bring back the Open Face Chili Burger at least!   How can you scratch something that was made with your own beer product.   If I want something more healthier, I'll go a few buildings down to Souplantation!"
Mario G.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,7,,3.0,9/18/2016,Food was delicious but service was far below par. Took too long to get beverages and way too long to get refills. Waitress had a personality that was better suited for Walmart. We will not be returning to this location again.
Pedro F.,"Ontario, CA",40,297,176,4.0,7/19/2015,"Definitely a fan, gets busy on weekends so use the call ahead service for parties of 6 or more. There is still a small wait even with the call ahead but it helps.  Pretty good selection of beers to choose from, try using the new menu to help you decide. There is a picture of the beers on a scale from light to dark.  So choose a beer, get the avocado egg rolls to start and I personally like the brisket and bacon burger, it's mouth watering.  Great place to have food and drinks with friends, service can be hit and miss. However this experience was pleasant, service was on point.  Also, can't go wrong with the pizookie."
Nancy T.,"Santa Ana, CA",331,132,42,5.0,11/22/2015,"It's been awhile since I got a little break, thought I would stay locally and check out what Chino hills has to offer. I wasn't quite sure where to go as I am usually out in the OC. I thought I would try out this establishment at this location, but been to several of their other locations. BJ have never disappoint at the other locations I been in. I was shocked to see one of my favorite bartender from another location was now working in this one. Ryan (bartender) always makes your experience at BJ 3x as fun with his superior customer service and always so detail oriented. Never forgets a name, a story and lastly always watching over the ladies. Making sure we have fun and always safe. Ryan is truly a great asset to the team at this location and so glad to see a friendly face. Another great night, thank you Ryan!!!"
Ashley M.,"Los Angeles, CA",780,148,386,5.0,7/18/2015,"Service: The manager, Karen's customer service is on point!!! She was such a delight to work with when I made a reservation for a surprise dinner. The whole staff was aware that this was a surprise dinner and were just so cooperative and helpful throughout the process and night. I could not have asked for a better staff to work with! They really care about their customers and that goes a long way.  Food: Grilled Salmon and Quinoa: This was delicious. The portions were plenty. The salmon was cooked perfectly, slightly crispy on the edges, yet still moist throughout the inside. And the quinoa with green beans were a perfect pair with my salmon. I would definitely get this again.  Overall, I had a great experience. Our food did take a while to get, but I knew this coming in since we had such a big party. I would highly recommend this location if you ever need to make reservations for a party!"
Russ H.,"Corona, CA",107,124,117,3.0,8/4/2015,Stopped by BJs this evening after a meeting in the area.  We went to the bar to have a few adult beverages and distress from the meeting.   We ordered their version of the smaller appetizer and it had good presentation and tasted fresh.  We also ordered the pizzookie platter with salted caramel chocolate chip and peanut butter.  I still prefer the chocolate chip! The service was adequate could have been better -could have been worse.  Overall it was a decent experience much better than other BJs that I have been too.
Dave H.,"Chino Hills, CA",3,43,28,5.0,10/18/2015,"Today we were served by Camille and I must say she was awesome! We had a party of 9 and she made sure we were all taken care of.  Absolutely the best waitress we've ever had,  thank you Camille and whom ever hired her.  We'll be back for sure!"
Stacy T.,"Reseda, Los Angeles, CA",259,50,13,2.0,10/4/2015,Food was delicious but we froze our butts off the whole time. After asking them to adjust the AC three times we still SAT there shaking well finishing our food.
