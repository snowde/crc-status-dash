Anonymom Y.,"Chino, CA",0,47,21,4.0,6/26/2015,"Ive been to BJ's a bunch of times--even when there were only the original Huntington Beach locations.  I was craving a burger today and wanted to eat out for dinner.  Arrived at about 6:00 pm on a Friday night and was seated in less than quoted 20 minutes.  Much to my husband's dismay, I ordered the brewhouse burger with cheese and bacon (and for extra charge subbed grilled onions for onion straws).  The burger was actually REALLY good.  They didn't ask how I wanted it cooked but it was perfectly medium.  The onion straws were the perfect addition (and I was never up charged for them anyway).   Service was a B+.  I had to ask for sugar for my iced tea.  When she brought it, there was no sugar, just all the colored fake sugar varieties.  We also waited a bit after we were done to order a customary pizzookie.  (I flagged her down). Waitress could have been a bit more attentive.   So besides my standard BJ's special pizza, and French dip sandwich, I would recommend the brewhouse burger."
E G.,"Chino Hills, CA",6,48,17,1.0,4/8/2016,"Congratulations BJ's, well at least this one. You are the first ever restaurant to get a 1 star..... whaaat! A BJ's, just keep reading and I'll explain.  First of all I like this franchise as a whole, pizza is good and I've had good times with friends at other locations.... but this one just plain out sucks. If you follow me I review pretty fairly, I give credit where credit is due, and owning a restaurant I know can be difficult. So I don't like giving negative reviews cause it brings the hard work of the owner down... but this was just plain out sad. We didn't even eat. Ok so here's what happened, my parents had to catch a flight so any restaurant with a 20+ minute wait we couldn't go to. So when we came here, we actually got seated immediately, so plus on them.... sadly that only plus isn't enough to even give it a 2 star. When we got seated, which this part was a minor gripe, my jacket got dirty from some sauce left on the table. Ok so I get it, if a waiter/waitress misses a spot on a table. For a place like this, it happens, I'll let that slide. If it were a higher end place then it's a bigger deal, but here it's not.  So we waited....and waited...and waited. Remember that whole ""cause my parents had a flight thing"" so anything past 20 minutes we couldn't go too! We waited for over 25 minutes. To our frustration, we asked a waiter if someone could help us. He looked confused so he said he'll get someone.... 10 minutes later still no one. So that was a 35 minute wait and still no one, not even to ask how we're doing. So we left. We were gonna be late.  I can see someone in the comment saying ""if you were in a hurry you shouldn't have gone there in the first place."" Well yeah you are right.... that's why we ask the hostess in the front how long the wait is. If we get seated immediately, then that means all is good and you shouldn't have to wait an additional 35 minutes for someone to come and assist you. Even if we weren't in a hurry, that's just sad. So we didn't eat and had to get something quick instead somewhere else. We just stormed out, they didn't try to stop us, which shows they didn't give a damn. So why should I? Epic fail, I'm never coming back to this BJ'S ever, and I live practically next door to it. I'd rather order pizza delivery than come back here again cause of how sh!tty the service was... if you even want to count not attending to your customer service... look I'm even cussing, that's how pissed I am.  It takes a lot to piss me off, and this place did it with flying colors. 1 star."
Erica E.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,2,,5.0,5/28/2016,"If you want good service, ask for Patrick. He is the best waiter there. Super nice, super accommodating and overall a wonderful guy. You will not be disappointed. Food is pretty good too!"
James M.,"Corona, CA",103,6,,5.0,8/4/2015,This is more about customer service then anything else. So we sit down to eat lunch for Connor's (My 4 year old)  birthday and while we were waiting a gentleman worker and lady worker ( my fault for not getting names) comes over and says do you know the code to this.  We look up and it's my 5 year olds iPad that we thought he lost close to 8 or 9 months ago. The workers charged the batteries in hopes of finding us one day. They knew who to look for because our family picture is the screen saver. We are crazy grateful and still can't believe it. Restores my faith in humanity.
Lance H.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,1,,5.0,2/2/2017,"Deep Dish Specialty pizzas are delicious. We like the Mediterranean, Five Meats, and BJ's favorite. At the Chino Hills BJ at the Commons, they have been having a special on Mondays: half off any large deep dish pizza. It's a great deal. Call ahead to make sure the deal is still on."
Janine A.,"Corona, CA",2,27,5,5.0,1/1/2017,"I have had a few large parties (over 25) before and the staff here has always gone above and beyond in service. Today we had another get together with friends and even with a rocky start (some did not show and I thought we needed more seats than we actually did) again, the wonderful staff here delivered tremendously! We left VERY happy, and would always recommend large parties to this BJ's in particular. Their employees really do bend over backwards to do the best that they can, and it really showed today! Thank you!"
Chris V.,"Chino Hills, CA",4,15,13,1.0,3/15/2016,"Placed a curb side pick order today at 12:55, to be ready at 1:45. Pulled up at 1:40, all 4 spots taken in the reserved parking. Saw some guys in a Benz (figures) walk out of restaurant without a to go order and drive away. Gotta love that. Around 1:55 we called to say we are here ready for pickup and are outside waiting. To go person comes out to collect money without the food. Manager comes out a few minutes later to do the same thing. We walk in the store to pay and pickup food (what happened to curbside pickup?), pay the bill and walked out with food. Get home, order is wrong. Called BJs back and informed  them the order is wrong (and the food looked like it had been sitting for an hour) and we would like to return the order and get a refund. Manager was nice but not helpful. Not happy.  Service is always good we we dine in, but the to go order system is horrible. Never will order to go again."
Andrea C.,"Pomona, CA",5,38,24,4.0,5/8/2016,Love this place! But BJ's why don't moms get a glass like the father's do on dad's day.  Breakfast sandwich is great! Love love the salsa. One of the best ones I've tasted!
Alex S.,"Chino Hills, CA",293,2,,1.0,4/24/2016,Awful!  Was with a small party and it took almost 2 hours to get our food.  Manager was rude as well!
Bruce C.,"Chino Hills, CA",20,66,5,5.0,8/27/2015,"Had another good time at BJs. To quote a Robin Williams in ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" ""HOT Jambalaya"". Great service, cold beer."
Rylee H.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",246,3,,1.0,7/26/2016,"Sorry but anyone that works customer service should know that when you walk in the door and you are not greeted properly it just ruins your whole experience. Hostess Amanda? (Asked our waitress what her name was, blonde girl with a black head band) was very rude. No sense of humor no smiles no nothing. Chick needs an attitude check."
Korren B.,"Long Beach, CA",15,14,11,5.0,8/27/2015,Service was great and food was just as great! I had the tomato mozzarella salad and the cherry chipotle glazed salmon with couscous. It was so delicious I already crave another! Husband and daughter (3yrs old) loved their food the same! Can't wait to come back
Edward B.,"Pomona, CA",48,11,,5.0,8/28/2015,"Went in for the first time ever to BJ' s for my wife's birthday lunch and all I can say is ""we will definitely be back."" Our server Lindsey S.  was a breath of fresh air, very patient and recommended great choices. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.  Thank You all for a wonderful dinning experience."
Stephen P.,"Los Angeles, CA",154,1103,2803,2.0,6/13/2014,"BJs Chino Hills - you try so hard to create an attractive entertaining place to eat, drink and watch sports. Yet, your kitchen royalty messed up our happy hour meal. BJs in Irvine is much better in comparison. I didn't expect an extra order of salt with my Mediterrenean (chicken) pizza...and who stole the chicken go? There was some leftover bits! We tried to finish it and even picked out the salty olives, but there was no saving this pizza! :(   The boneless chicken wings weren't much better....luke warm and soggy. At least we managed to eat these. The advocado egg rolls can't be faulted...highly edible. The evening shift might be the trainees. It might be the salt-happy chef. Whatever it was...it was very memorable. In a bad way. Best stick to BJs Irvine."
Alfred O.,"Corona, CA",2,2,,1.0,3/5/2016,"I placed an order through the app but I would not allow me to make payment through the app. I called the store and spoke to a manager, he said there's nothing he can do. This will be last time I visit this location.  Every time I order from this location there's always some items missing. Bad management running this location.  I'd rather drive a little farther Away to corona which I never have had any issues there."
Kerri K.,"Chino, CA",16,34,171,4.0,4/17/2015,They are testing a new happy hour menu which doesn't seem to be going over too well. Their beer has even increased in price from 4$ to $4.50 only $2 off shareable appetizers & flatbread pizza.1/2 off mini deep dish pizzas. No more mention of well drinks but a 1$ off cocktails and draft beer as well as glass of wine. If you were to compare the old & new happy hour menu it is a little vague & will keep the servers busy answering questions. I preferred the old one because you didn't need an actual menu to see the shareable appetizers it listed them on the table and under each price range. Service is good at the restaurant and food is good. Bar is great as well. Lunch menu is worth it or sharing pizzas during dinner. Hopefully testing will be over soon.
Kelly M.,"Sacramento, CA",919,586,816,4.0,7/29/2012,"Really great service and delicious food! I had a bloody mary made with absolut vodka here and it was really great. I had the bartender make it spicy and it was super tasty.  I also ordered their spinach artichoke dip and we mixed a side of jalapenos inside which gave it the right amount of zest.  Since I was already drinking, I didnt want too much food.  Their small bites are a nice alternative then getting an entire large meal.  I tried their chicken wonton with buffalo sauce and their macaroni and cheese.  Highlight of the evening.. their mac and cheese is simply delicious! They top the mac and cheese with baked breadcrumbs and drumroll... goldfish crackers.  So tasty.  A definite must try! Overall, their ambiance is great, they've perfect their food (and expanded their menu) and the service is impeccable. I will be back for more!"
Arthur P.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,17,8,1.0,9/2/2016,"One star because thank goodness beer comes pre-prepared and is stored on a cooler because the only way they could mess it up is to drop the glass and bring you the beer soaked towel to your table. As for a Date Night  dinner, here's how it went- ordered appetizer and personnel pizzas at the same time-after watching new arrivals occupy their tables and enjoying their appetizers (30min.)Our (6"")pizzas came  with our barely cooked Luke warm root beer soaked wings. The misses pizza was ordered with the sun dried tomatoes and peppers on the side-of course it arrived with sun dried tomatoes baked into the cheese the crust had a hit of heat and some tan color on the bottom but represented a Pizza cooked in a hot oven in No Way Shape or Form-my original (6"" of note) was soggy top to bottom with no sign of color or heat on the crust we couldn't even tell where the cut marks were on the edges the Dough molded  itself back into its Krispy Creme fresh donut form-luckily I was able to watch the management in action at the rail while we waited for our food to come out the issues became evident. The waitress and bartender did do well as one mistake is absolutely tolerable on their side of this experience in my humble opinion But as a Date Night seeking Customer  if I was in the pizza business I would make sure that my main focus as a manager would be not to be a "" social butterfly at the rail by the wall""  and focus less on damage control and more on food preparation to ensure the we served HOT,Properly prepared Wings and Pizza ( which I am Positive BJ's corporate folks pride themselves on) so our customers can leave with food in the belly and a thought that we would return to this spot again on the next search for "" A good Meal"". Positively spoken Honestly by a disappointed local customer who's was happy to return home hungry but took this time to share our experience with you, by the way this was our 2nd try at this BJ's that ended with good table staff but bad food-Why bother eating out-for all sake turn the oven up,slow down and serve Cooked food. Peace"
Wendy B.,"Corona, CA",1657,2025,7082,4.0,1/9/2014,"One of our fun traditions after going to the theater (tonight was the Pantages) is getting a late night sweet treat.  I might have found some place in the area, but after battling the crazies who were all leaving at the same time, and since we found ourselves on the road at around 11:00 at night, it was a challenge.  Very little is open at that hour, and we didn't want to hang out in downtown LA anyway.   So, as Mr. B sped down the freeway, I gave my phone a work out until I found some place open. At last, BJ's. They stay open until midnight, definitely no nightlife crowds, no parking impossibilities, nor creepy neighborhoods. Just right for old fogies like us. It was a bit disappointing to see the very limited dessert menu: mostly Pazookies, a monster sized, freshly baked cookie with ice cream topping.  They sound awesome, but I find them super cloyingly sweet.  Three other choices included a mixed berry cobbler, beignets, and/or three flavors of ice cream.  I opted for trying the beignet. Still hot from being freshly fried, with a light sprinkling of cinnamon sugar that had crystalized into a thin crust, then topped with a little ice cream, whipped cream, slices of fresh strawberries, and strawberry sauce. Yes, still sweet, but far better for what I was looking for. Glad I tried it.  Yes, I would get it again. Too bad they don't do hot fudge sundaes for my inner chocoholic."
SheiryllAnne T.,"Sacramento, CA",36,25,15,1.0,3/16/2016,If I could do zero stars I would.  We came 2x now and both times took forever I mean forever for a family of 6 to get our food!  Service and cooks are just so slow! Servers didn't even fill our drinks and it takes even longer to get your bill.  Ontario location is much better.
