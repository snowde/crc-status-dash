Chilli M.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",28,20,6,4.0,10/4/2015,"I always enjoy the food at BUs. I'm not a huge beer drinker so their extensive list of beers on tap is lost on me. If I drink beer, it's always a lite beer. They also have a good selection of cocktails and my wife and I take advantage of those. Good martinis, margaritas and some island style drinks. We there last night. It was crowded so we sat at the bar. I had the shrimp scampi pasta and my wife has salmon. Both meals were great.  The bartenders were very busy but still attentive to us.  It's a fun place to go with friends and sit in the bar area. Lots of good bar food."
Jay S.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,17,,2.0,4/4/2015,"Food is okay... I believe they are perpetually out of any beer I may want. ""Sorry, we are out of that"" Meh. For a brew house this is unacceptable when it happens 99% of the time. I can count on ""sorry, we are out of that"" every time. Chino hills can make it without them."
Genesis A.,"Suisun City, CA",139,189,703,4.0,1/10/2015,This place hasn't let our team down. We are here for a work project and have a team of 12 to feed. When all the other restaurants are pack and can take us in they do. Not only do they take us in they also have good service and the food is good.  On a Friday night if you don't want to wait you can always order to go. In our case we ordered to go for 12 ppl. The food was done quickly and when we got back to the hotel everything we ordered was there. Usually when ordering for a large group something always gets misplaced but not here we had everything we needed.  I have it 4 Instead of 5 because although they have good service and stuff the food could get boring quick. There isn't much variety. Other than that this place is a good place to go eat.
Vicki D.,"Chino Hills, CA",9,110,324,4.0,5/12/2016,"Went there for lunch today.  They have pretty good lunch combos.  I had a half-sandwich the California Club with wedge cut fries and a bowl of clam chowder soup.  I was completely satisfied with my meal, everything was cooked perfectly and taste was good.  My hubby had the Bison burger because he's on a diet and it's actually pretty good.  It comes with salad on the plate.   Overall our server was pretty good but not extraordinary.  BJs has a great rewards program to get free deserts and gift cards and we like that."
Jacqueline C.,"Los Angeles, CA",245,19,21,2.0,4/2/2014,"Came in on a Tuesday night around 10pm to grab a quick salad & I must say I was extremely disappointed... Walked in to a nearly empty BJ's with a party of 3! THREE PEOPLE NOT THIRTY... Why did it take the serves over 5 mins to seat us or say anything? Wish I knew! Two of the waitresses were busy chit chatting in the togo order section... Like seriously? A male waiter walked by us, did not say a word yet looked us dead in the eye and kept walking... One of the waitresses in the togo area walked passed, glanced at us and helped another table... Third waiter walks by us twice, excuse me what?! After being ignored by three different people, the other girl at the toof order area comes out and finally decides okay maybe someone should seat them.  One star for the decent kale salad, and another for our waiter who didn't ignore us and tried his best. I really don't know if I would go back though. I can understand if you're busy but if you're going to look at us you can at least say: ""Hi, welcome to BJ's""!"
Lorna S.,"Chino Hills, CA",59,54,68,5.0,5/22/2016,"I dined here for lunch on Friday, with a friend. Theirs food is always delicious! I got the BJ's special pizza and my friend got some kind of bacon bbq burger, both super yummmmm! xD and we saved room for their famous pizookie! We got the white chocolate chip macadamia cookie with chocolate ice cream, the best! I love this place, will be returning soon. :)"
Randy O.,"Chino Hills, CA",467,91,201,2.0,3/28/2016,"Tonight started out ok great service, decent pizza and a gas leak! Yes we were told they were evacuating the building because of a gas leak, I was getting up ready to walk outside then they handed everybody their bills. After we had paid our bills we were nicely asked to leave the building. So much for dessert but hey it must have been an actual emergency as every customer exited the building. I wasn't looking for a free meal so Quickly gulping down my drink and packing up our pizza we left. A good 5-10 minutes went by and still no emergency services? So was there a gas leak, 20 minutes later the gas company arrives and 10 minutes after that both fire and sheriff departments arrive. Not sure what the priority was tonight evacuating the building safely and in a timely manner or making sure all the customers paid first and then evacuating the building? Come on BJ's I'm sure you have procedures to follow for these type of incidents or do you?"
Mary V.,"Chino Hills, CA",11,97,22,4.0,2/18/2016,"I came with my family for soup and salads, there was a 30min wait and that wasn't a problem at all. The food was delicious and it came quick. The reason for the 4 stars is that although our waitress got our orders correct and was on point she wasn't at all interactive or vocal with us at all. She basically took our order and left, asked if we needed anything and left. There was no ""hi how are you guys"" there was no conversation at all with her which seemed a little unfriendly but other than that the food was awesome."
Eli M.,"Fullerton, CA",0,44,25,1.0,5/7/2015,"No. I will never use this place for a larger party. I ordered a mix and match appetizer (where you choose 2 appetizers ) and in the end I got charged for 2 separate mix and match plates.  Their reasoning was because ""didn't you notice that you got 16 sliders instead of 8?"" Ummmm. Because I apparently  work here I'm supposed to know the quantity?  And besides OUR server who was a super nice Asian guy, everyone else was a bug old NO. They literally had scowls on their face and told my husband to move because ""it's my table"". Wtf??? I'll be going to the Brea location!"
Tyler T.,"Chino Hills, CA",194,15,11,4.0,11/7/2015,"BJ's is a great place to get pizza and this location is typically pretty full. Especially if you come on a Friday or Saturday night, expect a short wait despite the fact that the restaurant is huge. Additionally, the bar gets very crowded, but I think that's all a testament to the quality of food and the atmosphere. We generally order ahead and I pick food up on the way home from work. This location has a separate counter for take out orders, so you can avoid the hectic-ness up front. They also have curbside delivery - you park, call them, and they'll bring the food to your car - if you're lucky enough to get one of the 3 curbside spaces.  BJ's has a very extensive menu and though the sandwiches and fries are good, we generally stick with the pizza. You really can't go wrong. The Mediterranean and the White pizzas are our go-to's. You can add chicken to them as well if you're feeling frisky. I've never had a bad pizza from this location, the food is consistently good. The staff at the to-go counter is always very friendly and helpful as well."
Lisa M.,"El Segundo, CA",128,5,1,5.0,5/12/2016,"They did an awesome job catering our school luncheon! Thank you so much to the team that put it together! The salads were fresh and tasty, they provided plenty of dressings and bread for the group as well! Thanks again!"
Jeffrey R.,"Chino Hills, CA",3,159,7,1.0,12/18/2015,"What a disaster. My wife, and child went to BJ's and saw they were pretty crowded. Typical for a Friday night. Wait was 30-40 mins but we saw a family leaving from the bar area. We went over and were able to grab their booth as they left.   Waitress was super friendly, came over, cleaned the table and took our drink orders.  3 waters, 1 beer and a Sprite.  The drinks came quickly and the waitress said she would be right bak to take our orders.  That was the longest, ""right back"" ever. Our waitress never did come back. In fact, we never saw her again. After 10 mins of waiting for her to return, I got up and asked the bartender where our waitress was. He shrugged, so I asked if I could order our dinners through him. He said he couldn't, we would have to wait for our waitress.  Makes sense, right?  So I went back and sat for another 10 minutes when a waitress went and helped the booth behind us. I stopped her and told her we needed to place our food order.  She told us she wasn't our waitress, but she would find ours.  5 mins goes by and the waitress who went looking for ours returned, with an attitude and said, ""I guess I'll be taking your order.""  Oh, sorry.... we are the one's waiting nearly 40 mins to place our order and you are the one being annoyed??  We placed our order which was a childs mac n cheese, one of those cookie pies, a chicken balsamic plate and a ribeye steak.  Another 10 mins go by, no water re-fills, no asking for another drink, nothing.  We saw our waitress but it was obvious she was intentionally avoiding 1/2 the tables...  I finally walk up to the bartender and ask if he could check on our food.  After our waitress saw me talk to the bartender, she came over and asked if everything was alright. I told her we have been at the restaurant for almost an hr. and we needed more water and our dinners.  She left and came back asking, ""I'm sorry, what did you order again?""  Really??  We repeated our order and I asked what the problem was.  She walked away, cam back and said she was sorry but the kitchen lost our ticket.... I couldn't believe it. So, we ordered again. Within 5 mins we got what was supposed to be our dinners, except my daughters mac and cheese was ice cold, my chicken looked ok from the top, but for some reason I couldn't cut it. When I flipped the chicken over, I saw why. The bottom wasn't overcooked, it was char burnt. The knife wouldn't even cut through it.   My wife's steak looked perfect, but since her family couldn't eat, she said, ""Lets go.""  I couldn't agree more.  We told the waitress we were too annoyed and frustrated and wanted to leave.  She left and brought me the bill.... LOL.. oh my gosh... I told my wife I would meet her in the car and she took my daughter and left.  I told the waitress she was crazy if she felt the need to give me the bill.  She said she would get the manager. I waited for 5 mins and no one came. I got up and left....  Whats happened to this place? We used to really enjoy coming here.  Oh well, Im sure they don't need our business seeing how busy they are."
Lawannishia B.,"Eastvale, CA",152,9,3,1.0,12/21/2015,The service at this BJ'S is below subpar.  We had to clear our own table in between courses. Request things multiple times and then wait for extended period of time
Victoria R.,"Ontario, CA",0,3,,5.0,11/20/2016,Our server David M was awesome!!! Made our dining experience fun and enjoyable. Very pleasant personality and overall fantastic experience. If you come here you have to get him.
Edwin R.,"Chino, CA",4,102,131,1.0,12/23/2014,"Overly greasy undercooked pizza Ordered a large hand tossed pizza. Half pepperoni lovers half combo. $26 asked for extra sauce on my pie as there pizzas tend to be very dry. Took pizza home noticed it was very dry. Called restaurant back they said come get another we are 4 miles out. Drove back this time they smothered the entire pizza in sauce very messy as if they were making a point. The toppings were not cooked through. Last time I order from here, should've ordered from SAMs club close by cheaper and 10 times better."
Erick R.,"Pomona, CA",26,55,12,1.0,5/16/2015,"Although BJ'S is usually very good with their service and food quality, I can't say that about last night at all. As soon as we came in, the hostess was not at her station and we were waiting around for about 10 minutes before being seated. There were a large amount of vacant tables available since it was later in the night so that wait time was not expected. Turns out that the POS system was down for about 10 minutes and that is why it took a little bit to be seated. We placed our orders and hung out for a bit. Our server, Jamie (he has blonde hair, long at the top and short on the sides) was mediocre at best, and was very rude and disrespectful. He was very reluctant and not once did he stop by to refill drinks and follow up. As we were getting ready to leave a member of our party thanked him and he acknowledged it and then when around the corner to where a POS system was located and mocked my cousin by repeating and whining the given gratitude as if he were making fun of him. We heard him loud and clear and it left us irritated and surprised that he would do that. BJ'S, get your act together, we love your food and atmosphere but that waiter Jamie killed it."
Katrina S.,"Chino, CA",167,8,,4.0,1/7/2015,"We decided to come here on christmas eve instead of Lucilles bbq (which is our normal and is located right next door but because of our horrible experience with them last christmas we wont be going back.) So we came here and in short: SERVICE: excellent, waitress was on it! I used to serve so I know great serving skills when I see them, she handled our party of 13 with ease and was very very friendly and informative about our drink selections. ATMOSPHERE: cool, it wasnt too crowded, the lighting was nice and intimate and the music wasnt blarring loud. FOOD: was mediocre at best and thats the reason for only 4 *'s"
Jose G.,"San Bernardino, CA",0,2,,5.0,11/22/2016,Great food the Pizookie is the best white macadamia nut got great service thank you for the good times
Brian H.,"Irvine, CA",296,47,31,2.0,11/24/2015,"Came here for lunch with the office staff. Ended up waiting an hour for our food which came out cold only after adding to speak with the manager. He came out and did not introduce himself and just listened, had nothing to say regarding the cold pizza and pottery dishes. They reduced the bill by $10 but overall very disappointing."
Ali H.,"Corona, CA",11,44,6,1.0,8/31/2016,"Unfortunately during our most recent visit it took an extremely long time for us to receive our food order which is the primary reason for the sub par review.  This delay did not seem to be the fault of our server, she was very polite and apologetic for the extended wait time.  For some reason it seems that whenever we have dined at this location, my fiance and I don't always receive the best service.  For example, during our prior experience with dining at this location the waitress that was initially assigned to our table came by after she introduced herself and informed us that she was leaving for the evening and that a different server would be by to assist us.  Well, this server did not leave for the evening, she was actually waiting on tables around us the entire time that we were there, but seemingly elected not to wait on us for some reason. I have never in my life had something like that happen to me.  At that time my fiance suggested that this be the last time that we dined at this location, but I wanted to give it another try, and this recent time we once again did not receive the best service. We will continue driving further to go to a B.J.'s that offers better customer service."
