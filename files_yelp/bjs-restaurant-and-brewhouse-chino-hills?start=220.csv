Kristin T.,"Fontana, CA",0,6,,1.0,8/8/2016,"I came here about a week ago and got AMAZING service from one waiter (really wish I got his name) so I decided to come back today, and now I will never be coming back due to the service I got today. My waitress (Grace M) acted like we were a burden on her life from the second we were seated. I gave her the benefit of the doubt, maybe she was having a bad day, I work customer service as well so I know Monday's aren't always the best but Jesus. Not one smile, not one you're welcome or no problem, nothing. I spilt a drink (accidents happen to the best of us) and I told her about the incident hoping she would bring extra napkins considering I used our only two cloth napkins to attempt to clean the mess, nope, no such luck. We sat at a sticky table, our food, napkins, phones soaked from the mess. Her response was ""would you like another beer?"" Like um no I would like a napkin but yeah the only thing she came back with was our check. At that point we noticed her and another waitress standing around and talking and looking directly at us. Okay so now we want to talk about customers to other waiters? I asked to speak to a manager and his only resolution was to discount our items to happy hour price WHICH THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO ALREADY HAVE BEEN DISCOUNTED TO THAT PRICE. Awful experience, awful service, and I will never come back. So be weary if you come during happy hour or have this woman as your waitress. So disappointed!!!!"
Robert G.,"Los Angeles, CA",159,264,24,3.0,7/2/2014,"We drove ALL the way to Chino hills for my friends Birthday.  I don't know if it's BJ's world-wide, but there is something seriously wrong with BJ's customer service. The staff was friendly, but HIGHLY unobservant of 4 grown ass people sitting in a section of an un-busy restaurant. I seriously got up to pour my own water 3 different times.   The food is decent... I mean, it's a chain, so it's scientifically made to be tasty, but its seriously the service that gets me EVERYTIME, no matter which one I go to.... what the hell...."
Hayley D.,"Chino Hills, CA",322,13,6,1.0,10/2/2015,"I'm giving the kitchen a one star. Tonight was the worst I've seen. We ordered our food and not only did it take an HOUR to get our food but it was also not the right order. So they sent it back to fix it and we waited another 30min. By the time we got the food we decided to take it to go. When we got home the food was cold, we live less than 5min away, and still not what we ordered. I'm very disappointed and wish I could give this store a better review but this hasn't been the first time and I've been hoping it would get better but it clearly hasn't. The servers are great and when the food is correct, its delicious. But I'm just sick of the long waits for my food and the constant mistakes with the kitchen."
Ryan J.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,3,,1.0,5/21/2016,"Terrible management. I took my family to BJ's last night for dinner. My wife and 3 girls. They gave us a booth near a side door in a room with a large party set up. As the party started to arrive they opened a back door for the guests to come in. This allowed cold air to flood into the room. I wouldn't normally care but we had our infant daughter with us and the cold air was blowing right on to her. I got up and asked the manger, who I later found out was named Ryan, if he would close the door. He rudely and arrogantly told me they would close it when all the party was there. This was a large party. The guy was a jerk. Apparently my family and I aren't as important as the large party. Having worked in restaurant for a long time I would like to give Ryan, the short manager with glasses at the chino hills BJ's some advice on how to handle this next time. When your guest comes up and asks for the door to be closed because he and his family are uncomfortable you can do these things. 1. Politely explain the situation, that the party has many older guests who have trouble with the stairs and that he will do his best to close it ASAP. 2. Offer to move us to another table. 3. Have one of your employees stand at the door and open it for the part as they come, this way the door doesn't have to be open for 20 minutes. 4. When your guests come up to you ask for anything, Try not to be such a smug jerk, remember that we are spending money at your restaurant also. You are in the service industry, try and remember that.  I would love to say that we don't go to BJ's again, but we probably will. I will say that their service isn't good. If this is man that leads the employees there it is not a surprise."
Alexis T.,"Anaheim, CA",1,9,,1.0,7/20/2016,"All of the food took forever to come out, and when it did, the food was not hot. It was obviously left out for some time before being brought out. Two dishes were forgotten about and when we told them, they told us that the food was made, but no one brought it out. It was left at the window and was too cold to serve so they offered to make us fresh new dishes. The dishes were chicken Alfredo and steak. When the chicken Alfredo came out, it was obviously put into the microwave. The cheese was crusty, and the pasta was absolutely dried out. We had to give it back to give us a new batch because it obviously was not fresh the first time. Worst BJ's I have ever been to."
Cynthia C.,"Chino, CA",111,3,10,5.0,5/31/2016,"Came here in the late afternoon to celebrate our little smarty pants as she has made silver honor roll all three semesters. Her school gives them a certificate to eat at Bj's as an award for their accomplishments. Thank you, BRE!! Our server Cameron was awesome!! He was working his butt off. He was speedy, attentive and ver accommodating! Especially to my daughter. He was kind enough to give her a complimentary, celebratory mini pazookie. Thank you, Cameron for being so kind to our daughter and for making her feel special! We will definitely be back!"
Jamie I.,"Chino Hills, CA",175,18,24,3.0,6/21/2015,"Earlier this week I dined with some coworkers at this bjs location. I ordered the soup and salad lunch combo. I got the tomato bisque soup and a wedge salad. Both were so good that I was craving them all week. Our server seemed overwhelmed, possibly due to the number of tables she had. Another person in my party ordered the soup and salad combo and neither of us received our food until ten minutes after the rest of the tables food had arrived. The server apologized and sent the manager over, who discounted our check for the inconvenience without us saying anything. As I mentioned, I was craving the soup all week so I decided to order the same combo for take out. I called the store and was placed on hold. After about five minutes of waiting, someone picked up the phone and hung it up. I called back and was placed on hold again for another five minutes so I decided to just go inside. I ordered and waited another 15 minutes for my soup and salad. The take out host was very friendly but also seemed overwhelmed. She was helping another customer and seemed panicked because the kitchen did not have his dressing prepared for his salads. In the midst of this craziness, she gave me my order. As I was walking to my car I realized she forgot my dressing so I had to go back inside. When I got home I realized that the wedge salad was really small. Much smaller than when I had ordered earlier in the week. Overall, the taste quality was good but the servers always seem stressed and overwhelmed. I'll give them another chance but I think this is an issue management should address."
Brandon S.,"San Bernardino, CA",22,38,6,5.0,8/17/2015,"Delicious food and top notch service. Our server Chad W was on top of things, my drinks never ran dry. Food came out fast!"
kalani b.,"Paris, France",1,35,7,4.0,1/19/2014,"The service makes all the difference! Our past experience here has been less than stellar, so we boycotted for over a year!  Last nights service was awesome! Drinks on- time and refills plentiful... It even made the food taste better!  I hope BJs cleaned house from the old staff and manager! And hope they keep it consistent this time; have to admit, I had one foot out the door looking towards Lucille's, but glad I stayed!  Keen up the great work BJs."
Wonder W.,"West Covina, CA",0,24,,1.0,5/6/2016,"If you like BJ's as I do, don't come to this location. The whole experience was bad. Seated immediately but waited 20 minutes to get a drink/app  order in. When we finally received the drinks,  NO apps...we ordered dinner. Good 15 minutes and our food (well 2 entries out of 3) came out...still no apps. 5 min later we got the 3rd entree and appetizer. Son enjoyed his Jalapeño  burger, hubby liked his chowder bowl, but they gave him the wrong salad, he let it go. My entree I ordered a Santa Fe chicken salad. Just wow on the mess that came out. (Should have snapped a pic) I tried to eat it but it was wilted and just plain unappetizing. Sent it back and just ate the Flatbread app. Waiter came around apologized asked if I wanted anything, I said I was fine with the flatbread  and ordered a beer.  15 minutes passed we were about done, he put down our check. No beer.  Looked at the check, he did remove that Santa Fe mess, BUT charged for that beer I never received AND 2 additional entrees from the table behind us.  Bad experience! Should have stayed in."
James N.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,15,1,1.0,5/7/2016,Well the initial food was ok we paid the bill tipped over 20 percent. We decided to sit and talk so ordered another round of drinks that's when it went bad. We waited for more than 40 minutes no one paid any attention to us but we when we got up to leave you would have thought we had robbed a bank. We did not hesitate to take care of the bill but the server throw the statement back my credit card hit the floor - we paid no tip on this and then told the manager who was just patronizing. I would not come back due to the total dis regard for the customer. Good luck.
Hanna D.,"Anaheim, CA",0,19,4,1.0,5/7/2016,"I don't know what servers they've been hiring lately but they really need to step up there game! I've been here twice this past month and all my servers were horrible!!!!! Long waits just for even a drink. I got my waitresses names so I would never have to have them as servers again: Julie and Karen, both of them take forever and are RUDE. I heard one of them complaining about how many tables they were given however, that is no excuse for horrible service and rude attitude to your customers. Lose your job if you can't handle the heat. Horrible service = horrible review."
Humbelina C.,"Chino Hills, CA",14,3,5,5.0,7/9/2016,Weekend brunch is the best I always come here for that after playing tennis and hiking
Pierce N.,"Pomona, CA",0,6,,1.0,10/14/2016,"I am literally sitting at my table as I write this. We came here for a family dinner on a Friday night, everything was going smoothly we got our drinks and put our orders in on time. Everything was fine until our entrees came out and they got my mothers dinner incorrect, fine mistakes happen. When they brought out the ""corrected"" order, it was wrong again. By the time her 3rd order came out, 20/25 min had passed and the whole family had finished their meals. When we asked to speak to the manager Karen, she again took about 10 min to even acknowledge us. When she came by to speak to us she was very defensive, and a bit rude. A simple acknowledgment of mistake and a bit of sincerity would have went a long way, but this was probably the most appalling bit of restaurant management I have ever seen. For this I seriously doubt I will return here let alone recommend it to anyone one. Karen did the BJs franchise a very big disservice this evening."
Blenthony M.,"Chino, CA",175,43,10,5.0,11/11/2014,Love this BJs location. We always get seated right away. If you go to the bar area be sure to arrive early if there is a popular sports game on.  Service is always excellent. Very attentive staff. Great customer service.  Go during happy hour and sit at the bar. Can't beat half off on mini pizzas!
Kyle Z.,"Chino Hills, CA",6,74,4,1.0,9/27/2014,"The food is very good and I love their ribeye steak but I dread coming here a lot! Huge waits on Friday and Saturday nights which is understandable. GOOD:  -Good food & nice employees.  -Free pizooki on your birthday. BAD:  -Food takes forever no matter what you order.  -Pizza is disgusting.  -2 Hour+ waits sometimes.  -Super loud inside, you can't even hear the person right next to you!"
Tania J.,"Los Angeles, CA",1772,311,195,4.0,3/31/2014,I like the beer....I like pizza...I like ice cream atop of a warm cookie. I also really love a good cheap happy hour. I currently frequent Bj's for the Nutty Brewnette.  Service here is what you'd expect from a chain restaurant...when it's good it's really good...when it's not so good...well...it's not so good.  The pizza is pretty good for a chain restaurant....do I crave it...nah...do I refuse to eat it...nah... I have no complaints....but if it wasn't for happy hour and that Nutty Brewnette I don't think I'd frequent BJ's....
Darci G.,"Chino, CA",623,12,7,1.0,4/24/2016,"Beyond upset! Came on a Sunday evening @ 7:15pm with 7 adults 6 children total. We got sat around 8:25. Once we got sat, we immediately ordered drinks & our food. @ 8:30ish the restaurant was about half full. It took over 25 minutes to get our waters, another 10 mins to receive our beers. All our appetizers didn't come out ""early"". After waiting over an HOUR now 9:40ish with 6 kids, we were stilling missing food. Raw ahi salad, over an HOUR!?!? Spaghetti, soup bowl, chili, ceaser salad, rolls....all over an hour wait. Spoke with manager, after speaking with server. Let him know how dissatisfied we were with their service. Not everyone had place setting or napkins. 2 friends asked for water 3 separate occasions. My sons child spaghetti was the last item brought out. We spoke to manager 3 times up to this point reguarding, time, quality of food (burger was not warm) and missing items. I asked for everones bill considering now it was 10pm on a school night. No gesture from the manager for the awful experience. Manager came to the table but was rude. Once manager walked away, a few minutes later my husband went to share his business management thoughts with him. He let him know things could have been handled differently. After sharing with the manager, we know some BJ VPs (not our original intentions)  by name he changed his tune. He ended up helping with the bill but asked us to leave. Gladly. Will not be visiting BJs Chino Hills again."
Betty C.,"Chino Hills, CA",300,371,133,5.0,6/27/2013,"Lots of restrooms, dark decor. This is one of the few chain restaurants that I will eat at. The food is good quality, fresh and well-presented. Salads tasty, pizza's yummy, and I really enjoy the sodas here. They taste well-crafted instead of something out of a can (they have a soda fountain).  The bar area has lots of screens to be able to watch sports and it's always packed. Love the lunch specials."
Lauren R.,"South Pasadena, CA",12,2,1,1.0,11/9/2015,Brian is the worst bartender I've ever had. I waited about 5 minutes to be acknowledged while he talked with some other guys at the bartop. Once I got my beer I waited another 10 minutes to get a menu. Not sure if Brian forgot I existed or if he didn't want to serve women. The whole time he just talked with the guys at the bar. If you are going to work in the service industry you should provide service for your guests.  This used to be one of my favorite bars but the new bar staff isn't keeping the standard. Maybe they need more training or you should give them a personality test before being hired. Brian was TERRIBLE. I ended up leaving because I didn't want to wait another 15 minutes to order food.
