Renee F.,"Ontario, CA",1,11,2,3.0,6/19/2016,"As much as I like Bjs food, today was just not good.  Used the ""VIP app"" , put us on the wait list and we get there , our name isn't found.  Ok cool, the hostess still tried to get us seated.  As we waited for our table, the family next to me heard me talking and said they made a reservation and it's no where to be found.  I know it's Father's Day but people will wait, trust me.  Sometimes slowing down helps.  No biggie , we were hungry and understood.  My server was absolutely wonderful.  But the food??? No Bueno I'm sorry to say!  They threw my deep dish ravioli together.  I don't like cheese but went to the W. Covina BJs last week and it was wonderful so I said I'll try it again.  Sad face..... My sister had deep dish pizza.....again - thrown together!!!  I don't care how many people were waiting for food or tables, everyone deserves the same quality.  Rushing won't get it.  Maybe today was a bad day; there were other complaints at other tables, which I won't name here to be fair.  I asked if my Premier rewards were added..... You already know the answer.  I'm sure I'll be back but not soon.  I'd rather go down the 10 to Eastland and double back for a minute."
Rachel S.,"Seattle, WA",0,3,1,5.0,8/24/2015,"By far my family's favorite place to eat! Not only is there something for everyone on the menu, but the service is fantastic.   Personal favorites are the tuna appetizer, egg rolls and of course any of the pizookies.  Always are go to place in Chino Hills!"
Joyce A.,"Cerritos, CA",360,683,420,3.0,8/28/2014,"As far as chains go, this location met expectations.  Endured the 35 minute long drive from near the OC to meet up with a friend coming in FROM Victorville, so this was our half-way point. Not much else going on in this large commercial area except for several more restaurants, so not sure if this is THE restaurant row. Got three appetizers to share -  nothing terrible nor outstanding, just good food. Ahi Poke: wish there was a way to get this as a meal sized portion - maybe double the ahi? It was very good, chunks of ahi and avocado, dressed lightly and served with a few (like 5 or 6) tortilla chip triangles. Sliders: 4 mini burgers to a serving, with cheddar cheese, a two to three bite per person appetizer.  Bread was grilled and toasted and was nicely crisped. They could not accommodate a request for blue cheese on one of them. Burgers were a tad too well done for my taste, but it was going to be shared so did not request medium rare.  Served with your choice of potato strings or wedges, dill pickles and a pile of shredded lettuce.  Calamari: slightly less crispy than I desired, but still tender calamari rings and tentacles, served with a white dressing and  marinara on the side. Not sure if the white dressing was tartar, ranch  or blue cheese ( not detectably different in taste).  Lots of parking if you don't mind the 2 or 3 minute brisk walk - way easier parking afar than circling around to get one nearby. Good service from our server Josh."
Marlene H.,"Ontario, CA",0,28,2,3.0,6/11/2016,"Food was good but its the typical chain restaurant ""herd mentality"". Get them in and get them out quickly. Probably won't be back. I prefer Chili's."
Alexis C.,"Westlake, Los Angeles, CA",53,45,10,5.0,6/6/2015,"So my husband and I use to dine with the bjs in cerritos maybe 3 times a week... (love them)... today Michael the bartender was great, very attentive  and had a good attitude obviously that's why he has the ""special"" apron! Our food was delcious and our drinks stayed full... will be back!"
Jim F.,"Riverside, CA",22,83,25,3.0,8/8/2014,"First visit to this location on a Thursday around 5:30pm.  Atmosphere, food quality and preparation time was consistent with other BJ's locations. Three star rating is based solely upon our server.  Angela was attentive with the basics although she offered the bare minimum in hospitality, was unfriendly and rushed myself and family through our meal. I was halfway through my pizza, my girlfriend and another family member had a ways to go with their food as well, when Angela approached our table, blurted out a few dessert options, offered to box our meals and bring the check.  I made a point to pause awkwardly, then ask for another drink and a few moments to finish our meal. For perspective, whenever the last person in my party is finished with their meal, I'm quick to ask for the check -- I am conscientious about making the table available for others who are waiting.  So, when a restaurant is only around 60% filled, I don't expect or appreciate being hurried through a half-eaten meal."
Andy C.,"Chino, CA",4,85,31,2.0,6/25/2014,Returned back to this location since we had been shopping at lowes . Must say the new menu sucks! Call me crazy but I believe the quality has gone down since they have opened up ! will no be returning
Danny M.,"Beverly Hills, CA",11,30,27,5.0,7/29/2014,What a great lunch we had. Cold beer fast service. We sat at the bar party of 3 and Kacey took care to get our orders right and out on time. Big smile and happy to be of service. We will be back. Thanks you Kacey!
Thomas P.,"Chino Hills, CA",20,1,,5.0,11/18/2015,Fun social place to be. Great people and a fantastic day time bartender Kc. Place makes you feel welcomed and comfortable. Food is great served always hot and well prepared.  I will be a regular here.
Emma L.,"Eureka, CA",99,1,2,3.0,10/15/2015,"Mediocre at best. Black and blue burger was mushy and it wasn't rare like I ordered, it also was not a thick juicy burger as advertised. The roll was big and greasy; but I really enjoyed the side salad with blue cheese dressing. The calamari was not very good; it left a bad grease flavor in my mouth afterward. The music was loud and horrible but our waitress was lovely, kind and attentive. The writing on the menu text was too small and the lighting was too dim to actually read it."
Nathan A.,"Glendora, CA",4,8,3,5.0,10/15/2015,"I come here atleast twice a week for lunch. Kacey at the bar is excellent and always remembers our regular order.  Good beers, good food and bar personality keep me coming back week after week."
Doug L.,"Corona, CA",74,8,,5.0,9/11/2015,Went here for our 4th wedding anniversary. Our waiter Neeko was amazing. He got to Know us and was excellent at what he does. Excellent food and great service. Highly recommend.
Claudia L.,"Irvine, CA",281,109,90,2.0,2/12/2014,"Umm is this bj's or is this some low quality  crappy pub ....  Honestly, this bjs sucks corporate honestly needs to  quality control control place ... Things that SUCK about this bj's: Beers: un carbonated beers .. waitress: unattentive and plan horrible customer service (she messed up our pizza order and did not even bother apologizing, she just told the manager to come over to tell us that she will give us a new pizza) Overall,  i love BJ's but this one plain SUCKS."
Matt B.,"Corona, CA",0,9,6,5.0,6/5/2015,I typically think the service here is terrible. Tonight we had Nichole she was the best waitress we have ever had here. Nichole spread your spirit in that restaurant and help improve the service!!
Carlos F.,"Chino, CA",47,7,23,4.0,8/2/2014,Great tv s  nice atmosphere with good appetizers.   We like and the rewards do pay off. I got $25 off today
Lyllyka M.,"La Habra, CA",36,23,11,5.0,4/9/2014,The food is bomb and the service is great. Even the music is decent. Great for the family and for drinks with yr buddy. Their beers are pretty tasty as well. The lunch specials are really priced well and are super filling. I'll definitely be returning!
ivan m.,"Chino, CA",72,8,,2.0,10/21/2015,"Waited 43 minutes. Was just told ""I don't know why the thing went off but we will put you back on the list"" if it wasn't for a school function I would never wait to eat at this place."
Tina B.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,23,,2.0,1/28/2016,"My friend and I went in last Tuesday for their half off wine special which was great. We then ordered a side of fries to munch on. When they came out, they weren't on the plate they usually come in. They came in a small side salad plate. They looked oily so I was a excited to eat hot fries. Instead they were cold and super oily. I would have said something, but I didn't want to embarrass my friend who doesn't like to stir up issues. We received lousy service from the beginning. I really wished I could have brought the fries to the managers attention. Unfortunately, lousy service happens. But the cold, oily, fries they brought out on a side salad plate was just too intentional."
Koi Ling S.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",18,254,37,4.0,7/15/2015,"good food, plenty of selection. The service was not exactly great, but we were treated nicely. The interior of the restaurant is so nice, comfortable and relaxing. prices seem fine too."
Kaitlyn M.,"Chino, CA",277,1,,5.0,10/11/2015,"I frequent multiple BJ'S often and I've never had a manager make me feel more welcome than Ryan. Thanks to him I will definitely return to the BJ'S in chino hills. Thank you, Ryan!"
