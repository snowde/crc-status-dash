Michelle H.,"San Diego, CA",157,628,1316,4.0,5/21/2012,"BJ's is BJ's. They're all going to taste relatively the same, but this one stands a little bit above some of the other's I've been to. Service is definitely ON POINT at this location, which makes dining here much more enjoyable. Food is also done well, even on a busy friday night. Come by if you're with a group of people who all want something a little different. The menu is pretty massive."
Iris C.,"Diamond Bar, CA",2,22,3,1.0,10/3/2013,"This place is the worst place to go to.  Too bad yelp doesn't allow negative stars!  Don't even bother trying to complain to management, since they care even less for their customers!  Bad management calls for bad employees!!! How can you say every single person you sat had reservations???  Obviously your lying since they have pagers just like everyone else! How can you sit everyone that wasn't Asian!? Yet you make all the Asian wait before all the other non Asians to be seated first!!! Management is has an issue with Asians!!!!"
Stephanie S.,"Los Angeles, CA",571,246,208,3.0,9/21/2012,"I can always count on BJ's to be around for a decent meal.  Their menu is huge, but I usually end up getting the pizza. Great White and Balsamic Mushroom are my current favorites. Get half & half! I always get the white chocolate macadamia pizookie...too good to pass up! Service is pretty good! Most of the time, the service is forgettable, but I've had a couple of really exceptional servers."
Daisy F.,"Corona, CA",0,6,4,1.0,1/1/2016,"Bad food quality and horrible service!!!  First of all, no greeting at the entrance at all. Was not acknowledge when we approached the front to give our party number.  Second, when my family and I got seated no communication just a simple "" here is your table."" We remained seated for about 20-30 minutes before the waiter assigned to our area arrived to take out drink order. After that it took an additional 15 minutes to get our drinks. We ordered simple fountain drinks.  Third, our appetizer arrived (spinach dip) and the staff who sat it down drop most of the chips on the table. Did not offer to clean it up or get us new ones.  Our food arrived and it looked good. I ordered the pull pork bacon BBQ burger. The pulled pork was cold and the burger meet was way over done. My husband ordered a small deep dish pizza and it too was cold. It took them about 30-40 minutes to get our meal. My sons Mac n cheese was decent, well Mac n cheese is not that complicated. Hence the one star.  We had to keeping asking for refills on our drinks because it was not being offered. Especially when it was obvious our glasses were empty. My ice tea was refilled but no ice was offered. It's called ice tea for a reason. It's suppose to be cold and not warm.  To sum up, very disappointed and dissatisfied with the service. No names could be written in the review because no name tags were worn nor the staff did not introduce themselves. Horrible service."
Marcos U.,"Loganville, GA",48,12,7,1.0,8/19/2015,It took to long to get our food service suck really bad I did not like it at all but althBrian b is the coolest
Joan T.,"Chino, CA",340,116,318,3.0,12/7/2013,"I just like coming here for the pizza, beer, the pizookies, and the ambiance. It's a great place to have dinner with your family, date, or party. It's always clean and has pretty good service, so I won't get into that.  The food is why I'm docking 2 stars. I believe they really count on their beers and pizookies to carry their business. Now since they have so many customers everyday, I feel like they don't put a lot of effort into their food too much. Like it's good, but it has never been a place for me where I can say ""Oh my gosh I'm crazing BJs.""  Get your mind out of the gutter ;p Lol but anyways, at my latest visit, we ordered their jalapeño  burger with thin fries, a club sandwich with thin fries, and calamari. It was filling, but I just walked out of there feeling the same way I always feel when I leave BJs....whatevs. I feel ""whatevs"" after eating there.  I get tired of eating their pizza every time, so I try to switch it up once in a whole. I tried their healthier menu once and hated it. I've tried their macaroni...was not impressed. And then I'll have to resort to their burgers.  The burger I had was good, but I HATE their lettuce. They dress the burger with so much lettuce strips. WHY!!!! Maybe if they put more pizazz into their foods than they did lettuce, id give them a better review.  Next time, maybe."
Trevor N.,"Chino Hills, CA",13,21,14,5.0,6/21/2015,Had the best service last night with my wife and daughter.  No wait the waiter was on point.  The staff was very polite.  The food came out super fast.  I tried there brussel sprouts for the first time ever trying brussel sprouts and they were amazing.  Definately something you should try. Over all great experience.
M V.,"Chino Hills, CA",8,6,1,2.0,2/9/2014,"Had lunch with the family today and the service was horrible!  We waited for an hour and a half.  Almost felt like leaving.  We had to ask for silverware, red pepper flakes, and cheese when the server should have asked us first.  Not once did they come back and refill our beverages.   The food, however, was delicious."
Matthew H.,"Corona, CA",0,12,,5.0,9/10/2015,"This BJ'S is awesome. Only waited a few minutes with my family of four, including kiddies. The service was a little longer wait than I wanted. However, the place was packed and when our food did come to our table.. everything we ordered was cooked and brought perfectly to our table. Portions were right on for price. But our server was amazing.. she was attentive to our table but more importantly any time our kiddies needed something she was right on it. Download the BJ'S app and save 20%... that was easy and simple and dad got a deal! We will be back definitely and for sure."
Jennifer S.,"Escondido, CA",416,873,603,3.0,7/25/2012,"Surprise, surprise!  Last night was one of my better visits tot he BJ's in Chino Hills.  My past experiences at this location weren't so good, with weak service and long waits, but last night I thought our service was great.  I went with the parents and really, my only complaint is WHY OH WHY did I not just start the meal with a Pizookie?!?!   I have to stop ordering FOOD at BJ's and go straight to the Pizookie.   Instead, I had the mac and cheese and the small caprese salad.  They were good, nothing spectacular.  I didn't recall that onions came on the caprese, so that was kind of a bummer - just not the flavor profile I want on it, but other than that it was delish and hooray, the balsamic was still gooey enough to eat.  Sometimes it is so thick and sticky it won't come off the plate! Mom had the new mango salad and dad had the jambalaya.  Both really liked their dishes.  We shared some fried artichokes which were good, but well, fried artichokes.  Nothing exciting.  We kept it simple, just drinking water, so overall it was a quick and simple meal with good service.  Best part was that dad paid with gift cards from his birthday so it was FREEEEEE! Good job BJ's - an A-OK visit!  I'll come back soon for that Pizookie."
Jazzlynn S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",10,12,1,1.0,7/3/2015,The worst bj experience I have ever had!!! I will never go back there again! It took an hour to get our food and then it wasn't even the correct order. Then it took another 10 mins to get our to go drinks and ranch. How hard is it pour some drinks and get some ranch. Don't ever go there!
Vanessa G.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,6,1,1.0,8/28/2015,"Horrible service! Never coming back! It took over an hour to get our food and on top of that the entire order was completely messed up! They said the manager would ""fix"" the order and that probably took another 1/2 hr and when the manager brought out the food he took it to the wrong table! He was clueless. We were there for about 2 hrs and still waiting for our food. That's just ridiculous.."
Jacqueline H.,"Coarsegold, CA",87,101,16,3.0,5/4/2015,I came in becuase I got a coupon in my email for buy one entree get one free. They didn't even ask for it lol. Overall everything was great ..happy hour prices were great and service was very attentive. My only complaint is that I was served obviously bad seared tuna....the server promptly brought new stuff but the fact that it was served to me in the first place makes me wonder. I will return but might opt for the pizzas (which have always been amazing). That and the pazookies are worth any wait :) I would recommend this one just not entrusting the serving of quality under cooked food ...... pizza and cookies all the way!
Kari K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,22,,1.0,4/23/2016,We had a big party and was told the wait was approximately one hour. We had no problem waiting. After an hour and fifth teen minute we asked how munch longer. We were told another fifth teen to twenty minutes. After kids began to complain that they were tired and hungry a half hour later we asked and was told that there was a limit that the other party had and they past their limits. After two and a half  hours later we were told we still had to wait. We decided to leave after speaking with manager which had nothing to say or did nothing to try to accommodate us. I've never had such a bad experience. I will never return.
Daniel C.,"Chino, CA",0,2,,1.0,4/23/2016,Went to BJ's in Chino Hills. I was told waiting time was an hour. I waited 2 and a half hours until I couldnt wait to be seated anymore. I had my kids with me. I had to leave and eat at Denny's. Wow incredibly horrible service. Managers said nothing they could do. Those managers need more training. There is always something that can be done.
Cecily A. S.,"Pomona, CA",1,28,1,3.0,6/8/2015,"Bjs pizza is delicious. I usually get the chicken alfredo. I know it's frozen food but it's yummy. Last time, I had the ahi tuna salad. It was good but not better than the Yardhouse. The Nutty Brunette beer is my favorite. And of course we can't forget the avocado egg rolls. This is usually the location I come to when I visit my parents. The service is mediocre but the hosts are the worst. They really start you off on the wrong foot. I'm a host at a restaurant and I've seen my share of hosts. These ones are some of the worst I've seen. Haha. It wouldn't kill you to smile, girls. And if I said I called ahead for seating, don't tell me I didnt. Haha. I also had a server ask me to taste my beer before he took drinks on his tray over to another table because he was afraid of giving my beer to a kid who ordered a root beer. Good job, guy."
Bethany S.,"Walnut, CA",276,122,73,5.0,12/9/2013,"Disclaimer: this review pertains only to BJs curbside service.  Today me and the bf decided to order over the phone for takeout. The girl who took our order on the phone was efficient and friendly. After I placed my order she asked if I was familiar with the curbside service and after I said no, she explained that there were designated parking spots in front of the store, and to call the number on the sign and someone would bring my food out to my car! Waow.  We arrive about 15 mins later and call the number. Within 5 min the worker brought out the food and took the credit card for payment, and she even asked if she could get us some drinks on the house while she was inside!! My boyfriend and I were a bit confused as to why we got free drinks... And sure enough she came back with two strawberry lemonades. The receipt was correct and had no extra charges on it. 5 stars for superb service!!"
Jerid N.,"Chino, CA",0,38,6,5.0,5/30/2015,"One of my favorite places to go for a good dining experience. I will keep my review short sweet and to the point.  One of the best places to me to come when you first turn 21 to have a first time drink. They offer great classic cocktails and of course there own brewed beer. I enjoyed my first time coming her and ordering a flight of beer tastings and discovering very good examples of different styles of beers. The waiters have a good knowledge of these and other beers that are not there own at the bar and are good and making great suggestions. My absolute favorite is beer is the Nutty Brewnette always have that every time I come in. Along with this they have a great variety of different styles of food from a traditional burger to freshly baked pizza.  I always recommend people going during there happy hour since they offer many discounted items including special on there house beers. Overall, I enjoy my experiences and will always come here for the overall experience. Cant wait to visit Bjs again soon."
Dana L.,"Menifee, CA",0,16,1,4.0,5/10/2015,"Went back again after the manager sent us a couple of coupons to make up for a bad experience. Management was very sweet. Food and service was great this time!  We've been back about 5 times since and this BJ's has gotten pretty consistent. New management??? Place is packed as usual. We sat in the bar area, so we didn't have to wait for a table. They had our food out in about 10 minutes. Food was good. Fun, fast and cheap meal. We'll go back again. The pooozokies or whatever they are called- are just OK. They taste like cheap pre-made cookie dough. Kind of over rated. LOL"
Sunnysideup P.,"La Verne, CA",0,9,,1.0,7/7/2015,Horrible customer service first off we had asked the waitress five times to bring several things that she kept forgetting then they got our order wrong then to make it up she try to give us cookies she never checked in on us are filled our cups I'm not sure who she was because she never told  us.
