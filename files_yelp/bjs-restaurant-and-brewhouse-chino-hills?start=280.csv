Constance C.,"Cerritos, CA",9,9,,1.0,5/5/2015,"Usually when I go to a place for food I expect to be talked to... No one even looked at me or came up to me. Expect to be ignored   The place was practically empty and no one was at the front desk. We waited for a while to be seated and when they noticed us standing there waiting to be seated but would not approach us, we just turned around and left to go to a different restaurant."
Kuppy K.,"Corona, CA",0,11,,1.0,5/16/2015,"The person who is responsible for their loyalty program should be fired! You can't sign up, tried 3 different ways mentioned on the flyer but nothing worked! Poor management period!"
Roxy A.,"Chicago, IL",690,369,396,4.0,7/5/2011,"I chose BJs for a big family get together since me & my bf were visiting from chicago. I was able to call the same day and make a reservation for my ginormous family. I thought we would have to wait a long time for a table but was really glad that since we made a reservation they saved a table for a party of 20.  My bf makes fun of me that I like BJs more than ""the real"" Chicago deep dish pizza, but I love the pizza here! The great white pizza is my fav pizza hands down. I like getting a side of ranch w/ the pizza too. BJs also has a great selection of beer, including my favorite lindeman's framboise.  Ooh and don't forget to order pizookies!!!! They even have a red velvet pizookies! We also ordered half chocolate chip half Oreo pizookies & it was soo good!!"
Connie P.,"Chino, CA",46,74,26,5.0,3/13/2015,"Had a great dinner last night with my family. Ordered chicken wings, pizza, New York steak, bison burger, kale salad, Cajun pasta and kids spaghetti. It was all amazing and so was our waiter . Can't wait to go back !"
Ivan C.,"Ontario, CA",0,8,,5.0,6/6/2014,"The environment in here is very pleasant, the food is good & the staff are courteous.  I was satisfied with the outcome!"
mike e.,"Glendora, CA",12,49,159,4.0,3/2/2014,Love the Parmesan crusted chicken and the Tatonka Stout.   Remember the word Tatonka from 'Dances With Wolvess'...
Maria M.,"Chino, CA",0,9,12,5.0,5/29/2014,"Great  place to eat, I love there salad. I went with my boyfriend. Because of there excellent service I usually leave a good tip."
Daniel T.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,6,,3.0,6/9/2015,The food here is ok some items on the menu are not as good. But over all if u want to have a good time w/ friends or family this is the place to go. I don't recommend coming to B'js on Sat. and Sun. day evenings because its to crowded and there are long waits.
Leon M.,"Eastvale, CA",46,19,7,2.0,1/24/2013,"If you like tomatoes and agree on the international description on ""Marinara"" then DO NOT EAT HERE UNLESS YOU WANT: Alfredo-esq bland sauce when you order ""spicy marinara"".   If you find yourself thinking about going to BJ's try Yard House instead.  I think they are both going for the same segment but IMO Yard House is a way better bet."
Terry G.,"Chino Hills, CA",20,14,24,2.0,1/17/2014,Bjs brew house burger. I ordered this last time I was here and it was GREAT! This time- soggy sourdough and replaced with Parmesan mushy bun. Server and manager were nice but still a big disappointment when you have your taste buds ready for what you had last time.
Chi N.,"West Covina, CA",41,15,4,1.0,7/24/2016,WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!! I get better service at the dmv. If you like feeling uncomfortable and like you can't ask for anything extra cause some one might spit in your food this is the place for you. Our waitress hated her life and wanted us to pay. She never once smiled at us not once. When she asked if we wanted an alcoholic beverage and we just ordered waters that started it off. After that we ordered two appetizers and she never came back till she had to take our orders again. We were so scared to ask her for anything cause she would give us mean looks or repeat what we said like it was so preposterous that we would ask her for anything. Also they sat us by the cash register so we could hear her and a blond girl talking about how horrible their customers were. One of the worst experiences of my life. Ruined a date night with me and my boyfriend. Better off making Cup of noodles at home. It'll be better food and you would have to endure rude mean girls
John V.,"Anaheim, CA",616,8,,2.0,4/1/2015,"Today was a REALLY bad day there. The order was wrong twice the waiter was slow and not attentive, ie drinks went dry and he was not around. ;-(  I think the waiter was named Donald. I have went there a lot of times so it was a bummer to see such poor service at this BJ's. One of the best lunch waitress is Monica. Next time I will make sure that I am in her area or section."
Leanne D.,"Chino Hills, CA",149,145,371,4.0,3/28/2011,"Usually go during happy hour after 10PM. I like it better than yard house. It's good for a quick bite, drink, & dessert! Drinks: - strawberry splash: good tropical drink, not strong - raspberry lemon drop martini: A little stronger but love the sugar rim =) - non alcoholic: orange cream soda is another yummy option. Free refills! Usuals - Gourmet mac and cheese: its from the small bite section, but portion is actually decent & filling - Bruschetta: nice and fresh - Spinach dip: my fav spinah dip! - Pizza: Great white or spinach& artichoke. Not authentic deep dish pizza but still tastey. Dessert - White chocolate macadamia nut pizookie!! - The oreo is pretty good too.  Place is chill. Couple TVs-no sound though. Service is okay. Better than some other BJs I've been to."
Melissa H.,"Chino, CA",623,358,220,4.0,9/22/2011,"I had the 2 for $20 special, it consisted of medium pizza, 2 salads and pazooki. I shared a vegetable pizza w/artichoke (simply delicious) and a peanut butter pazooki w/chocolate ice cream on it.  Their baked potatoes are huge w/plenty of toppings. There menu has bit of everything on it.  You can bring a large group and everyone should be able to find something on the menu they'd like.   Service was a little slow but our waitress seem to be a little impatient.  She kept leaving and coming back, she did not smile even when my group was joking with her about information on the menu or the special."
Melissa D.,"Chino, CA",8,31,100,5.0,1/5/2015,I dont normally go to any BJ's restaurants but tonight my boyfriend took me here so I could get some soup since I've had a cold. We sat in the bar area and our waitress Holly was beyond amazing I could barley talk because I lost my voice and she was just very nice about asking me yes or no questions so I could answer for myself and I really appreciated that. The food we had was really good as well but the service was the best part of my experience at BJ's
Summer S.,"Los Angeles, CA",54,681,3,3.0,7/20/2013,"I brought my parents here earlier this week for [lunch] and they LOVED the food. The only drawback was the price of lunch. It wasn't even dinner but for the three of us, it came out to $63, not including tip. That's a bit steep for lunch, no? This is what we ordered: - A medium Great White pizza - Avocado Eggrolls - and a Shrimp Scampi Pasta.  We shared it, family style. Service was just so-so. The guy who served us didn't even crack a smile. Sometimes I wondered if he was sleep walking? Lol."
Lizzie D.,"Fontana, CA",0,68,14,4.0,12/20/2014,Chad was our waiter tonight and he was such a doll! The food was good and the staff are always so friendly
Sarah A.,"Chino, CA",2,15,2,1.0,10/21/2014,"Don't bother coming into this BJ's, my family and I walked in and no one was there to greet us and we only saw one sad looking bartender working in the whole place.  Customer service is totally lacking and they just lost our business. You are better off going someplace else..."
Brooke B.,"Orange County, CA",93,33,7,5.0,10/28/2013,"Hands down, I experienced one of the BEST customer services ever. I tried out the ""Curb Side Service"" for the first time last week. They were quick and friendly with delivering my order and making sure that I had everything I needed. The waitress (who I unfortunately forgot her name :( ) was an absolute sweet heart and took the time to getting to know me. This was my second time ever coming to a BJ's and she definitely made me love it even more. Reading all the negative reviews, I was hesitant on coming here, but after my experience , I won't second guess myself! You will see me here more often for lunch! :)"
Tyffani R.,"West Covina, CA",1,16,2,4.0,4/17/2014,"To: the blonde waitress that waited on our party of 6 adults and 2 children (in the area facing Chino Hills Parkway) I'm guessing you were having a tough night or you were just tired. Either way you can't let personal issues interfere with your work. As an example, last night you had this look on your face, our entire visit, as if you hated your job. The service you provided last night was complete crap. I mean garbage! You let drinks go unfilled, once we even got them, our food took 45+ minutes to get to our table (let's not blame the kitchen entirely because some of our food was cold), and were the least attentive server on duty that took little interest in serving us period. You practically held us hostage considering the amount of time we spent at this establishment.. but you know what? None the less you're awesome! My partner works as a waiter for another big, demanding restaurant chain and we understand some nights are better than others. Otherwise we wouldn't have tipped you 20% on a $145 bill. We noticed after you received your tip you cheered up. Now if you could keep that pep in your step through the entirety of you shift, you'd be making a whole lot more tips! Don't let the personal stuff get in the way of you making your money. Sound advice. Apply it."
