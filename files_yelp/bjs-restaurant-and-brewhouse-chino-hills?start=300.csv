Tyler T.,"Eastvale, CA",264,48,10,5.0,7/6/2014,"I just had a curbside to-go order so I can't really review the restaurant justice... but the presentation of all the food was perfect and the taste was beyond expectations even when it was to go. Definitely not as busy as most other BJ'S but that's what you expect in a more secluded location like this one. Only 5 miles from my home in Eastvale, and would go here over any other location. Service from the waitress was above average and prompt."
Gracie M.,"Chino, CA",3,72,17,4.0,3/5/2015,"I love this place. The drinks are awesome. The food is always amazing. It is a bit pricey though, and portions can be a bit smaller than expected for price. I will still come back for more though."
Marie F.,"Chino, CA",14,15,1,5.0,12/22/2014,We've been here at least 10 times. The food is always very good and the service is usually good too. Especially because they are ALWAYS busy. There's always lots of servers on the floor. Avocado rolls are to die for.
Erica M.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,103,39,1.0,11/8/2014,"We stopped by BJs at midnight because we were craving avocado egg rolls and deep dish pizza. The avocado egg rolls were decent, but when they brought out our pizza, we realized it was extremely doughy as we cut through the slices. The middle of the slices were uncooked, so we asked them to cook the pizza awhile longer. They brought it back and it was basically warmed. The pizza was still doughy. The server did her best, but the pizza was awful. The rest of the night included terrible stomach aches."
Megan R.,"Riverside, CA",69,83,7,5.0,10/13/2014,Kenneth made our night! He was so friendly and helpful! Super fast and awesome to talk to! We loved the food and drinks at BJs! Best night ever! Thanks Kenneth!!!! :)
Alex S.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,1,1,4.0,11/25/2015,"jacks is a great host as well as courtney, and the avacado rolls are amazing, especially combined with buffalo wings in my perspective. Didnt get any real meals because of happy hour, when all shareable appetizers are $2 off. HOW GREAT IS THAT!"
Rhea C.,"Chino Hills, CA",91,14,4,3.0,11/24/2014,Love this place but disappointed the last few visits. Always order the avocado egg rolls but the last three times they came out undercooked. They should have at least a slight crunch but they don't. Tortillas often have raw spots. Same thing with chicken parmesan. They don't let it crisp at all. Industry location seems to have better food in comparison now. I order the same dishes there. Live in chino hills but have been driving to Industry when I can. Their California Chicken sandwich is great. Brewed sodas and Pizzoki are awesome! Hope that Chino Hills works on improving their dishes.
Daisy M.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,13,,5.0,12/1/2015,Dined in with dad. Had the spaghetti and meatballs which were a little to spicy for dad to enjoy. Our server Christina E. Made dad feel extra comfortable when offering to exchange his pasta for something to enjoy. Christina was really nice and made sure our night out was a great experience.
Jay M.,"West Covina, CA",2,21,1,4.0,10/20/2014,Wasn't to loud where you couldn't hear the the people you are with.  Fast service and food was great.
Florence S.,"Chino Hills, CA",28,35,8,2.0,6/9/2012,"We come here every-so-often because it is close by but I think yesterday may be the last time we consciously choose this place. We got there around 7pm and found a table in the bar area, so seating was fast. Our order took longer than it should have which resulted in the spinach and artichoke dip to be cold when it was finally delivered. My husband's Chicken Parmesan was not hot either and you can tell it was sitting out under those heat lamps too long. When the food is brought out when it should be, it's pretty decent.  We talked to the Manager and he seemed disinterested. In fact, he had the nerve to state that no one has complained. That comment was not solicited and is not something you should tell a customer when they are having a bad experience.  The reason for the 2 stars is that the waitress was nice and very apologetic (despite her management) and the wine was good."
Mona T.,"Chino Hills, CA",54,106,44,1.0,3/8/2012,Went in at around 10:30pm on weekday because it was either here or yardhouse that was open til midnight.  We ordered avocado eggroll appetizer and chicken alfredo pasta it was SOOOO gross..tasted like pasta from a box...seriously! and i ordered the avocado egg roll thikning it might taste like the ones they have at cheesecake factory BOY was i WRONG!! man..i duno if it was just because it was late or what...but seriously next time i come to bjs ill stick to the pizza =/ oh and the orange cream soda DID NOT taste like an orange creamsicle like the waitress said it would BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!
Daniel W.,"Corona, CA",0,7,,1.0,12/9/2014,Just had lunch there and the salad was served with a huge beatle crawling around under the leaves.  Now bugs can happen at any restaurant but it's in how you handle it IMO .  Manage came out and recognized that indeed they just served a disgusting plate of food and asked if we wanted another salad.  We declined.  Then he tried to play let's make a deal to comp the least amount possible.  Finally I just told him I don't want anything out of the kitchen so he just charged us for drinks and we walked away from our meals.  Sad when a huge company takes the stance that they would rather collect $10 instead of saving a repeat client.  I would not eat here ever again because of the management mostly but also the lack of quality control on the food preparation.
Ilye S.,"Laveen Village, AZ",105,8,1,4.0,9/11/2014,Great customer service and always prompt. My fiance and I always sit at the bar and the bartenders are always friendly and a pleasure to conversation with. They always give us the best recommendations.
Emily C.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,3,,1.0,10/2/2015,"Extremely unprofessional. Made a reservation a week ahead of time for 9 people for Homecoming, then called about 4 days later to add a couple more people to my party & they told me that they had no reservation under my name. This was so frustrating for my whole group-wish BJ's wouldn't have messed up in the first place and knocked us off the list just because they got busy. Good thing I called and asked to enlarge our party, or else we would've walked in Saturday night expecting to have our table and then having to try to get a large group of us in somewhere else."
Elizabeth S.,"Las Vegas, NV",544,191,532,4.0,4/16/2012,"Just like any other BJs. Good food, pizza, beer, and pizookies.  Good thing about this location is that I've never seen it super crowded. I've always been seated right away. They also have a lot of TVs everywhere to watch games."
Ella M.,"Corona, CA",95,185,271,3.0,2/12/2013,"I wanted to give this place two stars, but the third star is our server Michael G. I got their strawberry margarita. It was literally a Slurpee. I think I got sick from it. I order the Shrimp Scampi. It was okay too. But our server was amazing. We went on a Saturday night. It was very busy. But Michael G. was great."
Norma G.,"Chino Hills, CA",25,1,52,4.0,5/25/2014,The food is great and  the service is wonderful the only flaw I found was that the place needs a little cleaning done to the floors and some dusting.
Ayami H.,"Orange County, CA",658,546,745,4.0,1/8/2013,Remember to sign up for the points program.  I'm one dish away from a free pazookie.... a FREE PAZOOKIE... common!  :)
Aerial A.,"Los Angeles, CA",19,604,67,4.0,8/8/2014,"BJ's is a great place to eat. The 2 for $22 is really good! The Salted Caramel Pizookie is so good. The Bacon Ranch Pizza is pretty good, but its also a bit salty. The Tomato Bisque and Clam Chowder are both delicious as well."
Steven H.,"El Monte, CA",72,19,6,5.0,8/7/2014,"This BJ's has great service! Our waiter, Chris, took good care of us. Our main food came out before the salads did and Chris apologized for not bringing them out before the main food. He offered us a free desert for the inconvenience. We felt like he really cared for our opinion. Highly recommend BJs at the bar side to be waited by Chris."
