Victoria B.,"Corona, CA",14,65,14,1.0,4/30/2014,"Went tonight and husband found metal in his spaghetti. Manager was only going to offer free desert and keep metal meal on bill, I think not. Won't be back soon. This is a second chance."
Mary Ann V.,"Rowland Heights, CA",36,108,8,3.0,6/14/2014,"Came for a friend's graduation dinner. 4 stars for food.  3 stars for service. We were a party of 11. Waitress forgot our utensils, and when she came with utensils she did not count correctly. Food came in a timely manner. But waitress didn't really come back to check up on us. I also ordered a pizookie and we were waiting for it - only to find out it was never ordered."
Eddie V.,"Upland, CA",1,20,,1.0,1/26/2014,"Went to BJ's for my birthday on January 26th. Only went here as my first choice Lucille's was jammed. Huge mistake. Should have went home. We placed our name and were given a pager. On a Sunday busy as usual. We were seated in the designated time frame of 15 minutes. This is all that went right. Our hostess a young girl very flighty in her 20's sat us at a 4 person table. There were 6 of us. We asked her why and she said nothing. My wife went back and said that the table was too small. She replied to her co-worker that they shouldn't have been sat there. She did it and blamed him. We were directed to the main lobby to wait again. After 15 minutes I asked about our wait time as they took our pager from the previous round. The man at the desk asked my name and didn't know we were waiting. I asked the hostess when she returned and she said ""oh they are still here"". Should have left then. Orders were taken relatively efficiently. 4 of my family members said their food was ""ok"". They ordered chicken, a burger, pasta, and a pizza respectively. I ordered a three meat deep dish pizza. One of the worst I have ever had. $14 for a small. It had no sauce. Meat, cheese and tons of dough. No sauce! Extremely dry to place it mildly. I tried but sent it back after a few bites. Drink refills were non existent without major prompting. My wife ordered angel hair pasta that was bland and the shrimp with it were so spicy it was not tolerable. I tried one shrimp and it was very spicy. I downed my drink and was told over 4 times that another tea would be brought. They removed my wife's glass and said they would return. Never did. She had to physically leave our table to get his attention. I returned my pizza (if that was pizza, I'm not sure). My waiter asked if there was anything else I wanted and I said another tea would be nice. He never returned until I asked for the check. The manager came and spoke to me directly and asked the same. After the previous debacles all I wanted was to go. The gave me a free dessert which was appreciated. My kids ate it as I'm diabetic but it was a good touch. Manager- attentive and thoughtful. Waiter- less than mediocre  Hostess(es)- recommend termination Experience- $117 for this. Never again. Bye BJ's. No more business from this family. Eddie in Upland."
Robin K.,"Prescott Valley, AZ",0,4,,5.0,10/11/2015,"We usually go here every Sunday and the service is usually excellent and food is very good, but today  the service was just so so. But one of the managers Ryan came over and asked us about our experience today and we told him what happened and he said that he would make things right. He ended up giving us a gift card for our next visit. Which we were not expecting! Thank you Ryan"
Gary P.,"Chino Hills, CA",1,2,2,5.0,6/14/2013,"My girlfriend and I frequent BJs often and have tried about everything on the menu, including the many options of craft beers BJs provides. Every experience is a good one. The food is always great and the service at the bar is great. Mike is the best bartender in town. He is exceptionally good at costumer service and making us feel special. Our favorites are the mini pizzas, any BJs beer, avocado rolls, spinach dip and pazookies are a must have. We love this place!"
Dave S.,"Diamond Bar, CA",64,7,1,4.0,7/25/2014,Thank you to the manger Travis! For making a bad night into something special! We appreciate that you listened to our concerns!!
Aria F.,"Royal Oak, MI",28,285,21,3.0,8/30/2012,Quick and Dirty review: Good is good.  Service is lacking mainly because they are understaffed
Risha C.,"Corona, CA",64,36,66,4.0,10/19/2012,My boyfriend and I arrived to this location for dinner at 7 and didn't have to wait long. it was pretty busy with many big group parties but luckily there was no wait. we got sitted and greeted by two waitresses. service was quick and good. The cook accidentally messed up our pizza (which wasn't a big deal) but they were so kind and remade the entire pizza and even the manager came to apologize. Really treat customers so kindly.  Food was delicious. Service was good. Def recommend to go here and will def go back :)
J O.,"Corona, CA",0,16,1,3.0,8/11/2015,"The BJ's restaurant customer service is always great,but when I ordered a lemon thyme chicken here,it was very very salty.For this reason,I talked to a waiter and politely offered me another dish and I accepted it.When the dish came it was still salty for me,but it was much better,but I did leave with a stomach ache because of all the salt.My friends steak was also uncooked,but they fixed it for her right away.Overall a good place,but chefs should be more attentive."
L.M H.,"Chino, CA",0,5,,1.0,8/7/2015,"Came here last nigth horrible dinning experience,came in order avocado appetizers they were ehh ok, Order a bj irish beer it was pretty good, I order the cheese ravioli, tasted like something you would get at stater bros frozen section,girlfreind order the rosted chicken barbacoa, we EXPECIFICALY told our server make shure the chicken is extra well done,so her plate comes out, she cuts into it ofcourse RAW JUICY chicken :) we tell Our server we would like another one, i TOLD HIM MAKE SHURE THE COOKS BUTTERFLY THE CHIKEN AND COOK IT WELL DONE. after waiting i was already gross out with with the ravioli, her plate took forever to come out till we decided to cancel it. manger never came to the table, so we ask for our bill, after waiting server comes and brings out a bill for a different table, so we had to wait again, no manager still. My point is for $40 i would of like Mcds instead.and better service"
Jennifer T.,"Riverside, CA",154,73,21,1.0,7/19/2011,"My company works down the street and we frequently eat out for lunch. On multiple separate occasions our order was incorrect. It varied from no salad dressings in the bag, to the wrong ingredients in a dish, to something not cooked how we requested - all of which wasn't discovered until we got all of the way back to the office.  The first time I called to complain the manager offered us free dessert, which was nothing good for us because what are we going to do, drive back over there to prove a point?? And the second time it happened, the manager said this and I quote, ""I told you to look in the bag and make sure we had everything in there."" Um, last time I checked, I shouldn't have to check that you are doing your job. And I thought it was safe to assume that since we all ordered SALADS, your waiters and waitresses were capable of packing SALAD DRESSINGS.  After the next failed attempt at customer service we decided to never go there again. Yardhouse is right down the street and they give impeccable lunch service.  I was wrong. I would not recommend this place to anyone. Not worth the hassle and disappointment."
Louie A.,"Menifee, CA",134,147,1388,4.0,8/3/2012,"Great food at great prices. I ilke this location, not to busy on a Saturday evening at 9:00 pm.  Customer service was a good and wait service was friendly.  We just wanted a quick bite to eat so we just ordered the very popular Sampler Platter.  It had everything on there from greasy to spicy foods, it was on there."
Vanessa S.,"Fort Worth, TX",1,19,16,5.0,2/22/2015,"This BJ's is awesome! We celebrated my Dad's retirement party here and we were very impressed. We booked the back room for 80 people. We did the pizza pairings and got to choose 4 different kinds of pizzas, salad and pasta. We added chicken to the pasta. The cost was 15.95 per person, great deal! All the non alcoholic drinks were included. The food was served buffet style and was ready when the party started. Everything was delicious. We never ran out of anything. The manager Karen was wonderful. She was always around making sure we had everything we needed. Our Servers; Holly, Steven and two others(can't remember names) did a great job. Seriously the best service I've ever had. So glad we chose this BJs for my Dads party. I only wish it was closer to my house so I could go more often."
Chuck A.,"Long Beach, CA",341,347,80,4.0,9/9/2011,".., good ol' BJ's right? Haha, that sounds great just sayin' it.  Pretty consistent food & service wise. Usually always happening, BJ's is perfect for groups, dates, or a late night w/ friends.  Craving a late night dinner, my gf Diane & I came out for a cheap date & some laughs. She went w/ her favorite order of buffalo wings, while I had their fish tacos.  Our server Julian did a great job & was very attentive. Food came out shortly & everything was great. Wings were tasty as usual, & I loved my fish tacos. They were slightly bigger than your average fish taco that you can get anywhere else, cabbage was fresh, tasty sauce, & great batter. The white flaky fish inside was really good, really great texture.  I will be back for those soon! Check it out!"
J P.,"Ontario, CA",0,26,3,1.0,9/11/2013,"I have never experienced such bad service at BJs. My sister and I arrived on a Sunday afternoon, were seated immediately...AND then waited 20 minutes for a server to meet & greet! I looked around and it was not busy at all didn't know why it was taking forever but other tables were being helped. Nonetheless, my sister and I ordered appetizer and meals and waited another 30 minutes for it to arrive. Most likely not returning."
Brett R.,"Victorville, CA",1199,703,19,4.0,2/27/2014,"If 2 dudes want to get BJ's at lunch time, they should come here."
Ramon R.,"Temple City, CA",119,40,25,4.0,4/5/2014,"Good restaurants, great good and the waiter we had was spectacular! Always constantly checked on us to see of we needed anything! Although the wait time is a little long the wait was well worth it."
Chris B.,"Corona, CA",21,394,1140,2.0,5/6/2012,Waiting for food took 40 mins.. Ordered deigg'n mahi-mahi tacos and 2 kids peperonni pizza.. R u kidding me.. How long does that really take
Yuni O.,"Nampa, ID",0,11,,1.0,1/1/2014,"This place was good when it first opened. Since then it has steadily gone down hill. The last time we were in there the pizza was cold when it was served! And good luck trying to get a drink refill! So, we tried take out...even worse... the Cobb Salad was horrible and the pizza was just so, so. I just can't justify spending that kind of money and getting crappy food and service. I wish I could give it negative stars!"
Laura L.,"Ontario, CA",71,94,17,4.0,2/6/2014,"Went here with my family after Christmas to have lunch. Apparently the lunch time is a better time to come for a great deal. Loved the options on the lunch menu, they weren't going to break the bank and the size was pretty decent. Split a pazookie with my fiancee and we were good to go! Plus we had amazing service....Our waitress was so nice and on top of it. I won't return for dinner again but you can bet that I will be back for lunch!"
