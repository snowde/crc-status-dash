Angela W.,"Los Angeles, CA",111,180,27,3.0,12/2/2013,"I used to LOVE their bread bowl and pazookie. We had the 2 for $35 special this time, which was ok. Clam chowder was definitely overloaded on sodium. I just feel like a lot of the good stuff was taken out on the appetizer too, one of the flatbread pizzas. I come back occasionally for the beer."
Lia K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,7/2/2015,Worst Bjs ever. First Kabwe to wait 30+ extra for my food after everyone got there's and then I ask for a simple regular sized pizookie and I get s mini! Seriously! I wait an extra 30 minutes the least they could've done was give me what I asked for. DO NOT GO HERE
Eric W.,"Downingtown, PA",8,96,,3.0,3/22/2014,"Ate here while traveling on business recently.  Yes, the 13 year old that still lives in my head chuckles, but I found my meal to be pretty good.  I went with the jalapeño burger.  Burger was cooked to my request, jalapeños were slightly crispy as is described on the menu.  Overall a good burger.  Feedback from around the table was pretty good also.  Nothing to write home about but for a good bar/grill type meal, this is a pretty place to be."
Amina K.,"Chino, CA",58,136,105,4.0,10/11/2013,"I am surprised to see that some reviewers had issues with the servers.  My family and I have been there several times and other than the wait time taking an average of 15-30 minutes, I have nothing to complain about.  If anything, we have always had wonderful service and the food has always been hot and tasty."
James S.,"Chino, CA",39,187,43,3.0,3/22/2011,"I love BJ's but their Happy Hour is crappy. -$2 for shareable appetizers, -$1 for draft beers, and 50% off personal pizzas. Not the greatest discounts and the portions seemed tiny.  I'm on a mission to try all happy hours in Chino Hills. So far, RA Sushi and Lucielle's is much better. Too bad they don't hav BJ's honey blonde or pale ale."
Kitty H.,"Chino, CA",6,6,12,3.0,5/15/2012,"Nice clean place, food is ok. A fun place to hang out with love one and friends."
Leslie D.,"San Diego, CA",100,107,46,4.0,2/21/2011,"Great Americanized food with one really super dessert. Yes there is some hit and miss in this place but when you order right you will be a definite fan.  Decor: Standard but their TVs is not my taste. I wish they were bigger and more spread out especially for game day or Laker day. The one in the middle ( of the bar) splits the game in 6 screens showing different things (usually sports related) but I only like that for football not basketball. We are socal people, im pretty sure most people watch Lakers than regular sportscenter or nascar. The bar is pretty spacious and to get into happy hour, you have to eat there. Happy hour is 3-7 on weekdays, sun to thurs 10pm to close. 1/2 off mini pizzas; 2$ off sharable appetizers & classic sliders & $2 off flatbread appetizer pizza. Pretty good but i like half off appetizers like the other happy hours i been to (ie Yardhouse)  Busyness: Went on a holiday monday around 330pm. Very fast to get in or out. Gone here on weekends, pretty crazy. That's why i usually avoid this place unless i'm really willing to wait around.  Food:  LOVE the scampi pasta! I usually order this and you can request a side of panko bread crumbs if you like. I love putting extra panko bread crumbs. They give you a lot of shrimp and their portions are great for their food but you will usually need a box unless you're sharing.  Some good choices:  avocado egg rolls ( heard the cpk one is better but haven't tried it)  gourmet mac and cheese  spinach dip  great white pizza  Strawberry splash drink  DID not like the chicken marsala. So bland. BJ's favorite (pizza) was pretty good but I don't know if I call it favorite. Pizza gets kinda generic sometimes.  BUT last but not least do order the pizookie. I enjoy this so much everytime i go. it's a must and I feel like i die and go to heaven i eat here. I prefer though when they kept the pizookie in one tin and not splitting it into two smaller tins though when you want to split the flavor. You have to dig and everything gets crusty at the bottom of the smaller tin and it becomes harder to get the rest of the cookie =(. They give a lot of ice cream with the cookie which is awesome. I hate when they don't give enough. I like the white chocolate macadamia nut and the classic chocolate chip.  For someone's bday they will give a small pizookie but boo no more singing. Service was really great and they check on us multiple times. However it wasn't busy so i dont think they are always like this."
Patty And Sergio R.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,364,5,5.0,6/27/2014,"Great service, Alina was our waiter very nice and helpful, the good was delicious I really enjoyed my evening after a long day of work. I will be coming Back to this location"
Chris S.,"Chino Hills, CA",12,9,,1.0,4/22/2013,"Bj's food and beer is good; however, I want to comment on the poor service. My fiancé and I sat down in the bar area on a Sunday afternoon. Not many people in the restaurant. It took forever to get menus and a drink order. So long that we almost walked out right then. When our food came out, it was the wrong pizza, to which our server admitted he wrote down the wrong pizza order. Could not get a refill to save our life. When we complained to the manager, he said sorry and turned back to flirting with the hostesses without trying to rectify the situation. What a loser!"
Yoli L.,"Glendora, CA",0,17,,3.0,5/5/2015,Had lunch here today. I was shocked at how good the deep dish pizza was. The service was not great but my sausage pizza was really really good. And I never order that kind of pizza. One of the things BJ's always has going for it is that it is always clean. To bad the service is never good.
Nellie G.,"Chino Hills, CA",147,10,5,1.0,1/21/2013,"Went here with a large group of classmates. TERRIBLE service, our waitress was incredibly rude and had an attitude, she wouldn't give us happy hour prices because we didn't sit in the bar area even though the waitress that seated us before said we could because we had such a large group, she refilled our waters one time, food came out late and cold like it had been sitting out and when we confronted her about it all she said was ""we're really backed up"" (it was a Monday night), the waitress wouldn't split the check for us and on top of all that, two of us got food poisoning from the spinach!! NEVER again. Next time we'll stick with Yard House. They always have great service and great food."
Simone V.,"West Covina, CA",157,137,190,4.0,12/6/2011,"Been here for a birthday dinner last Friday and I have to say, service was great, food was good and the drinks were well made.  It was my niece's bday and she had a large group of high school friends come out to celebrate with her.  The group was a good 15 plus.  There were adults too, but we took over the 2 booths next to them.  The hostess was really good at saving the booths for our group, since more came than expected orginally.   Since everyone was paying for their own meal, there was no problem splitting the check here.  The waitress, I think her name was Courtney, was great.  She was really on top of things and very attentive.      BJ's Chino Hills is a good spot for groups and price is reasonable.  They have a mini appetizer menu with prices ranging form $3-$6 bucks.  They're good with late happy hour too, from 10pm to close.  Too bad it's not available for the weekends."
Roger M.,"Mission Hills, San Diego, CA",3523,527,12341,4.0,10/28/2008,"This BJ's ambiance and seating is quite nice.  Very spacious in here and plenty of room and not all crammed up like the other ones I've been to.  You won't feel like your squeezed in at this BJ's. Service was very good and attentive, so thats a huge plus.  They were super busy and still managed to make us feel like guests here. It was just two of us so we ordered a medium-sized BJ's favorite pizza and a plate of the avocado egg-rolls.  The pizza came out and our server sliced it up and served it up for us.  I'd have to say that the pizza wasn't really so great that night as I've had better before but it was still decent.  Just lacked a bit of some pizza sauce.   The avocado egg-rolls were on point though,  it was nice and crunchy and the avocados were super fresh. Overall, I will give this place a 4 star based on their quick service, the food came out in fast and the food tasted decent, but mostly for the awesome customer service we got here."
Marian F.,"Diamond Bar, CA",52,21,3,3.0,3/17/2014,"Went on a pretty busy night, we arrived at 8:50 pm, took half an hr for me and my group to be seated. We had a waiter that was taking care of 4 or 5 other big tables, but I saw 2 or 3 other waiters standing doing nothing. You would figure the place would distribute their waiters evenly among the tables. Our orders were taken at 9:45, all meals were served by 10:30, food was fine and filling, dessert was pretty good. Our waiter was nice though, apologizing for the wait. I would come again, maybe at lunch."
Solymar G.,"West Covina, CA",36,10,,1.0,1/11/2014,One good thing was that they let me call in my name as we drive there.  But they said it was going to be a 45 min wait. It took us 25 mins to drive there and we still waited over an hour. At one point one of my kids went to go ask how much longer and they said it would be five mins as they were cleaning off our table. Well after another 15 mins the manger came to talk to us. She said there was not much she could do because the people were still sitting at the table! Why give us false information! Then she came back to get us after waiting an hour and twenty mins and said our table was ready. As we got to the table it was still a mess! The plates and drinks were all still there. Food was good but there service sucked!!! The waiter also rarely came by!
Kevin Z.,"Riverside, CA",4,56,69,4.0,10/9/2011,"I have a review of the BJ's in Brea. This BJ's is almost a polar opposite. I think the main difference is that this location isn't as busy as the Brea location. Service here has always been good. I've been to this location about three, maybe four times. Most times it has been with a group of people from 6-12 people. Splitting the check for the different couples was never an issue or hassle.  Again, BJ's beer is awesome."
Sherilyn F.,"Chino Hills, CA",7,8,,3.0,2/26/2014,"Hey, I would've given four and a half stars, but my recent visit revealed that the restaurant has recently gotten rid of their delicious and yummy brownie pizookie. Sometimes my kids and I would come here just for that. Bring back the brownie!!!"
Janet W.,"Chino, CA",0,1,,1.0,10/21/2014,"Horrible! I ordered curbside last night, ordering online, and called the number as told to when I arrived.  I waited 20 minutes (also called twice to see what was taking so long) the girls response was oh I'm sorry I was told you were in a black car. Really?because when I ordered online I stated silver and when I called I said silver.. so after that mix up I get my pizza and it is completely burnt and full blown soggy underneath.  I know it wasn't the girls fault but I hold management fully responsible.  They set the tone for an establishment and this particular BJS is not up to par by far!! This is not the first time having an issue with this location. Boycotting"
Nick M.,"Chino, CA",1,5,,1.0,2/13/2014,Terrible service! Half my party got their food then I didn't get mine and they got it wrong. Terrible place to spend for my 21st birthday. Hopefully someday parents outgrow this shitty food and learn to go other places. I'm only here because I got dragged here. Never coming here again!
Penny C.,"Chino, CA",40,65,4,1.0,6/14/2014,This specific location sucks!  Go to another BJ's. The manager there is terrible.  It was some lady that does not know how to take care of customers.  We had to complain to corporate who was very attentive and great.  BJ's in general is a good place to hang out with friends and eat but this location sucks!
