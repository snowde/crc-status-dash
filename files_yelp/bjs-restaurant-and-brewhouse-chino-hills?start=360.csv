Jessica H.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,8,1,1.0,3/19/2015,"Horrible service. Got seated quickly but waited for 15 minutes for a waiter to approach us after we had already told another waiter. Only saw the waiter three times; when she took our order, gave us our food, and gave us the check. Pizza and wings were horrible the pizza was very bland and had no cheese on it the wings were over cooked and burnt. To top it off the waiter tried to over charge us for something we didn't even order. Never coming here again!"
Dan L.,"Chino, CA",716,186,94,3.0,8/22/2010,"Pretty good food, amazing beer selection. Went there on Friday and had fish and chips. Decent portions, but the star of the show was the beer. It's a tough call because there are so many good beers a on the menu ... best bet is to get the sampler. I gave it 3 stars because it was just okay ... didn't change my life, but was just okay."
Julie H.,"Moreno Valley, CA",221,37,16,3.0,8/21/2013,"Went for late night happy hour. The food was decent, the drinks were good, and the service was great. As a group we ordered boneless buffalo wings(kind of a small serving and the chicken pieces were small) mini deep dish pizzas(always good from BJ's)and potstickers(kind of soggy) Lemon drop martini tasted like cleaning solution, Irish Root Beer was delicious and the strawberry mojito was tasty. For dessert we shared a Beignet(tasted super doughy and nothing like what it usually tastes like) and an oreo pizookie(always good). Our total came out to $75, not a real good happy hour price- we could've gone to Yard House and gotten all that plus more for half the price. Our server Jamie was very attentive and did a great job."
Asmita J.,"New York, NY",218,555,2,3.0,1/23/2011,"in high school, i absolutely loved BJ's. it was the perfect spot to hang out w friends on a fri or sat night..... now, not so much. their food is mediocre, at best. even their pizookies aren't as delicious as they used to be. in fact, i literally went to Yardhouse for their mini choc souffle dessert after I had dinner at BJ's. (yupp, its that good). needless to say, BJs always brings back fond memories so i can never stop going. before i end, here are 2 great things about the place: -service: the waiters are always happy to serve you! and are attentive as well. -home-brewed root beer: seriously, some of the best root beer i have had. this alone will prob keep me coming back!"
Ted T.,"Chino Hills, CA",8,205,415,5.0,6/16/2013,"My son and I went for a Fathers Day lunch.  Had the avocado egg rolls to start, with the BBQ Buffalo Burger, followed up by a red velvet pizzokie.  Quite tasty.  Service was surprizingly good considering it was a holiday. Plus, I got a commemerative pint glass for free..."
Robin L.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,51,2,1.0,10/15/2013,"I will never go back to this place again. I've been to this chain a few times and each time the staff was unfriendly. Food was mediocre at best. Service is bad except when it comes time to bring your check so you get the hint to leave. Just teens that don't care about helping customers. If you want to sit and talk with friends go elsewhere. Not only is this place so loud you cannot have a conversation but they are very pushey about turning over tables so don't expect to stay past your last bite even if you're drinking. Just another over priced, low quality chain restaurant."
Kat L.,"Monterey Park, CA",176,31,6,4.0,10/12/2013,"Not too shabby, the waiters were very attentive and nice. This would be one of the best bj's I have ever been to!"
Alis M.,"Yorba Linda, CA",103,93,,4.0,5/24/2011,"This place is great to go watch the Laker game or any sporting event. They have a bunch of TVs at the bar and then random TVs all over the restaurant. Happy hour is from 3-7 p.m. Monday thru Friday and after 10 p.m. I think on all nights except for Friday and Saturday. Their beers are a $1 off and their appetizers are cheaper too. I usually come here for the beer, the Jeremiah Red is the best one.  There's a ton of these all over, but I usually prefer the Chino Hills location because i think the server's are great here."
Roehl A.,"Chino Hills, CA",282,315,1353,1.0,5/13/2012,"After an hour and a half wait for a party of seven, it was hard to enjoy our food. And when it finally arrived, there was no silverware or napkins. Not a good night tonight."
Julezery P.,"Rosemead, CA",1,12,2,3.0,2/12/2013,"I love all the BJ's Restaurants I've been too.  I've been to this particular location quite a few times, I have even considered it my location of choice.  However, I gave them 3 stars due to their customer service for the most recent times I've been there (probably about a year ago).  I used go to BJ's on weekend nights so it is usually always busy.  For this reason, the last times i've been there I felt rushed to finish my food, pay, and leave.  There was one particular night that I will never forget. I was enjoying dinner with my fiance and as we were having a conversation (and as i was finishing up my meal), our waitress takes his empty plate and stacks it on top of mine (which i was still working on).  She didn't bother asking if i was finished with it or anything! After that night, I have not been and do not plan on going to this BJ's location again."
t n.,"Irvine, CA",171,164,2,1.0,1/12/2010,"HORRIBLE service! We had reservations for 20 people for our X-mas party. Called days in advance but still had to wait 30 minutes for our table. What's the point of making reservations??? The jackass of the manager told us that we were only allowed to eat for 1.5 hours. After that, we had to leave. WTF????!!!! What kind of shitty rule is that?! I've never eaten at a restaurant where I am given a limit on how long I am allowed to stay. The service was extremely slow and poor. We stayed for 4 hours and refused to budge from our seats, screaming kids and all. Screw the manager.  We'll never be back."
Brigette W.,"Chino, CA",54,51,46,4.0,2/23/2011,"HatersGonHate? hahah, this place gets weak ratings. But i must admit, service is is... blahhh. Sometimes you get the good waiter, but it takes forever to get the food, sometimes its the other way around.  Whenever I come here i always have the inconvenience of having a big group, so its an automatic long wait for food :/ But nonetheless, the foods always good. i love me the deep dish pizzas here. :) order the GREAT WHITE PIZZA. its sooooo gooooood. and if you come here with friends try to order a medium pizza (for 2 people) or large pizza (for 3 people)and share amongst youselves instead of the personal pizza, that way you get more bang for your buck. cause the personal pizzas here are so small.  the chicken wings here are effing delish too, i could eat like 23094727 of those. they drizzle the ranch and buffalo sauce on top, but they give you extra sauce. theyre perfect though! not too spicy or greasy. shoestring fries are good, im just not into tiny/thin fries, i like em thick.  Pizza's always great here, so.. on to dessert.  CHOCOLATE CHIP PAZOOKIE. i know you can easily make this at home, but since youre here, why not spend $5 on this piece of heaven?? texure and taste= spot on. 9.7/10"
Alberto E.,"Chino, CA",543,473,1759,4.0,8/8/2010,"I enjoy this BJ's because the service is great and they do the best they can with the staff they have.  The beer selection is pretty good but I have had better.  You can't beat the customer service at this place.  Our server, Kayla, did a great job this Sunday morning.  I was pleasantly surprised they have a good Sunday brunch, the breakfast was delicious.  I usually order to go from here because this place gets crazy busy."
Melissa S.,"Murrieta, CA",72,58,7,4.0,1/31/2013,"I love that they have such a large menu with tons of options. It's great when your group can't decide on where to go, there is something for everyone. I like the appetizer options and the small plate options. I also love that they have wedge fries.  The service was very prompt and attentive. I just have a few gripes. The drinks are pricy, especially the wine. If you plan on ordering food and drinks plan on a hefty bill. I am just not sure if its worth the price."
Brandy B.,"Eastvale, CA",199,53,64,5.0,10/11/2012,"What can I say..... It's BJ's , if you like god food full of flavor and a full bar plus tasty deserts your golden"
Ann C.,"Chino Hills, CA",715,545,480,4.0,11/23/2009,"Gorgeous...the restaurant decor and ambiance is stunningly beautiful!  I felt like I was in a set of a movie...like The Great Gatsby vibe...remember that scene in Batman Dark Knight where they were in a restaurant?  Like that!  Llighting was woodsy and the room was spacious...lovely =) Of yea forgot this was a ""food review""....hehe.....ok the food was typical BJ's ... can't go wrong with a pizza right? Great White Pizza:  4 stars.  It's alfredo sauce, mushrooms and chunky tomatoes.  I like it because it's simple clean yet packed with oomph. Mediterranean Pizza:  2 stars.  Too many toppings = salty overdone on flavor.  Olives, pepperchini (?) all these damn veggies...uggh just too much going on. Avocado egg rolls:  5 stars.  Delicious =) ask for extra sauce because there's never enough.  Crispy fried wonton skin with chunks of avocado cilantro yum The service sucked.  Unfortunately, our waitress looked like she didn't want to be there.  She acted annoyed when we asked for things!  Hey Mr. Manager, she's the older white lady with brown hair in case you wanna cut your staff she should be the first to go. But yea, this BJ's is by far the nicest one I've been to so far =)  The one in Brea is cramped and a bit ghetto.   BJ's in Chino Hills is a go =P"
Jefferson F.,"Simi Valley, CA",16,81,2,3.0,1/20/2011,"Pizza review: BJ's is ""ok"" when it comes to pizza. They're about the only place in Chino Hills that serves a deep-dish pizza, but they don't make it right. The crust is way too fluffy and there's too little sauce to classify it as a real deep-dish. A true deep dish has a regular or flat crust, with toppings piled in the middle, coated with cheese and sauce. Not here... it's like a regular pizza, but with a fluffy crust and limited sauce. Atmosphere is nice and dark, usually playing 80's music. Lots of TV monitors showing the various sports games. Staff is usually excellent and friendly. They have a special happy-hour appetizer/drink special in the bar, Sun-Thu, after 10pm."
Kat S.,"Norco, CA",3,4,,2.0,6/27/2012,"We came here last night and from the time we sat down it took 5 minutes for our sarver to come say hello. He took our drink orders and we got our drinks (2 margaritas and a root beer) 30 minutes, yes 30 minutes later!!! After 10 minutes of waiting he came over and apologized and got us some waters. I am a server and I've been there myself when restaurants get really busy. They were not busy at all. The food was good though (I'll give it 4 stars)."
Grace H.,"Los Angeles, CA",102,36,37,2.0,6/5/2012,"came here last night with a couple of friends, and i was so disgusted by the service. it shouldn't take 15 minutes for us to get water, and 30 minutes to get our food. my friend ordered an irish root beer and he got that when he was almost done with his food. our drinks were never refilled, and getting the check took longer than it was supposed to. i ordered the new orleans jambalaya and it was better than time i had it at BJ's in huntington beach so props for that. and what's up with the management turning up the AC, when it was in the 60's outside at night? i got a cold."
John L.,"Mission Viejo, CA",50,44,11,4.0,7/12/2013,The food was great and the price and size were perfect.
