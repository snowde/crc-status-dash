christopher r.,"Irvine, CA",2,28,16,2.0,10/5/2009,"Easy does it on the over-the-top in-your-face service. I mean, nice people, but I can't imagine the meetings this staff must have re: service (go get 'em, make the customer your friend, keep asking them what else they need, keep up the energy). I was exhausted by the end of the meal. First, you get a book that they call a menu, and while you read it they repeatedly ask if you know what you want. I had to explain that, due to the size of the menu, it was going to take time.  Tomato bisque was fine: not sweet, as is so common elsewhere. The alfredo chicken pizza was good, but not $20/med. good. Good place, but definitely a express conveyor-belt of pump-it-out product and service. Take a nap before entering."
Ralph O.,"Chino Hills, CA",253,620,67,4.0,6/19/2012,"We've been here several times and the last time we were here it was to treat a couple from out of town. We ended sharing several items, BJ favorite Pizza, spinach stuffed mushrooms, calamari, ahi poke and triple chocolate pizookie.  I have to say everything was delicious. The out of town guest enjoyed their food.  The best dish was the pizookie. Everything was seasoned perfectly. Service was fast and friendly."
Brad K.,"Diamond Bar, CA",24,116,25,3.0,9/5/2010,"This BJ's is the closest to my house so that's why I've been here. It's a standard BJ's with the usual offerings, which are all OK and do the job when you want to fill the stomach with various greasy things and get out of the house while not spending a ton. They like to call themselves a microbrewery, which I find interesting, but this one serves the macrobrews too (Coors, MIller, Bud). I went back and forth once about this with a bartender at the one in Brea and said they don't serve the macros because they're a microbrewery, so I don't know if the company policy has changed or if it's from store to store."
J K.,"Los Angeles, CA",112,12,,4.0,5/30/2011,"Friendly service and great food. I've been to a couple of BJ's in my life, but the staff here seems to be pretty well trained for customer's satisfaction. Great atmosphere and great food. Try the pizza and their home made beer. Prob be back again."
Merilou T.,"Hillsboro, OR",187,94,13,5.0,7/8/2012,"The customer service was excellent at this location.  It was a Tuesday night and I was with a group of 6 in the bar area.  We pretty much closed down the place.  The restaurant closed at midnight but the employees did not rush us out, they advised us that we did not need to rush.  I  was really happy with the service it was the best."
Jonathan K.,"Pomona, CA",79,142,2,3.0,8/18/2010,The service is ok and then food is good It just tooks us forever to get are food so that's wh ythe 3 star They do have a pretty good selection of beer thou and bring out a sampler plate of them(pretty sure we paid for it thou) Overall it was ok and maybe i'll go again
Bonnie Y.,"Chino, CA",125,741,3648,3.0,9/2/2009,been to this location twice - had pizza both times with other appetizers... i don't know... my stomach hurts both times the next day & i think it's cus of the pizza.....  the food is really average... (except the desert of course)... the only reason i continue to go back is because of their... BEER! what else! but don't get their new 120 calories beer.... no taste at all! service was OK - first time get a real perky waitress that comes over and asks us if everything is OK and if she can take anything away EVERY 10 MINUTES... 2nd time the waitress has NO smile on her face.... oh well. totally would choose yard house over this place ANYTIME!
Lea T.,"Fullerton, CA",0,17,1,3.0,3/29/2011,"Atmosphere:   I think this restaurant probably used to have the brewery inside and then they made it into additional seating.  It was about 2:30 PM on a Saturday afternoon, and the place was pretty busy.  Our party of three was seated right away in a booth.  The restaurant is fairly new - it always seems so different from the original BJ's that I remember in Santa Ana.  I'm an old BJ's fan from the 1980's, when the pizza place was kind of a dive.  Service: Despite the fact that they seemed to be out of the first three beers that my husband ordered, she was so apologetic that I couldn't help but like her.  The service was prompt, but when the server asked the manager to come over to our table, the manager didn't really know what to say to us.  Either do something for us or don't do anything for us, but don't stand there and try to figure out what the minimum you can get away with doing for us without having us yelp about it later!  Nothing was done, but I wasn't really that upset.    Food: I was disappointed in the food here.   I think the pizza was better back in the day, but the menu is still one that I really like.  We ordered a Large Great White Pizza with sundried tomatoes instead of the roma tomatoes.  When we got the pizza, there was little, if any, alfredo on the pizza, and a lot of marinara sauce.  So much for Great White!  Also, ordering sundried tomatoes seemed to be an excuse to put no tomatoes on the pizza at all.  My husband was content with his beer and I had some wine which was also all right.  However, we didn't get dessert.  All in all, if I didn't really like BJs, I'd probably go with two stars."
Daniel V.,"Chino, CA",171,68,,3.0,5/10/2012,There's nothing over-exciting about this location. U usually go for happy hour now that Ive known they don't actually brew their meet onsite anymore. Mini pizzas are good value at hh but overpriced during regular times. Service has been hit or miss with more misses at might since they seem to cut servers before happy hour.
Eliza R.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,3,,2.0,7/11/2015,"I have been to BJ's before and received great service and the food was delicious but this time was way different. So I arrive at the location with my friend at 6:30 we waited for a couple other friends to get there and we asked for a table and they said they would put our name down. We walked outside to wait and when one of my friends went to go check to see how much longer it would be the people at the front desk told us they hadn't even put our name down? (We had already been waiting 20 mins) so we were cool with it and put our names down again and they handed us a buzzer. After 30 minutes had gone by we went back in and asked again, they said another 25 minutes. None of us had eaten anything so we were starving but we accepted the fact that we had to wait and walked back outside. Long story short, at 9:30 AT NIGHT we were finally seated. We were out of BJ's by 11 at night. Thanks for making us wait 2 and a half hours BJ's!! YOU ROCK!!! And note that people who came in AFTER us, are BEFORE us."
Eric Y.,"San Francisco, CA",3,87,,3.0,2/7/2012,"Pretty good and cheap lunch options.  My quesadilla was average tasting.  Friendly services, easy parking, clean restaurant. C+/B-"
Erik S.,"Glendora, CA",1,32,,2.0,4/4/2014,"Went there for dinner tonight, big mistake. Food was meh...scallops weren't evenly cooked, fries were cold, kids meals were cold."
Kristine C.,"Temple City, CA",359,248,138,4.0,1/10/2012,"Best thing about BJ's ... HAPPY HOUR. Most HH in Chino Hills end at 6pm, BJ's ends at 7pm. The down part is HH is only in the bar area and if you don't get there early or are not aggressive, you won't be able to get a table."
Larry B.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,63,,2.0,5/12/2014,"Walked in at 5:30 to a half filled restaurant,  hostess was very polite and up-beat and our server was very nice ..... When we saw him.  The food was great good pizza, excellent wings and the pizzokie is worth the wait, and wait you will.  We waited for the server to bring out drinks, we waited for him to come back and take our order, we waited and waited for our food to come out and the place was half empty.  We waited some more for him to come back and refill drinks and we waited for red pepper flakes and the for him to come back so we could order dessert.  The theme of the night was waiting.  If you don't mind waiting the food is pretty good especially for a chain restaurant, but you better have lots of time because the service or lack of service can take awhile ..."
Steve M.,"Costa Mesa, CA",144,220,126,5.0,2/11/2012,Amanda was the coolest server we had such a great night. The food was really good and we all got our orders and drinks fast.
Roselle E.,"Chino, CA",91,238,7,2.0,12/16/2008,"I've been a devoted customer of BJ's, but this particular location gave me a bad taste.  The entire family was starving after hours of waiting for our family portrait session to end.  We came here at around 3:00 for a late lunch.  It took a while for our server to come and about 15 minutes after being seated she came to take our drink orders.  At this time, we all knew what we wanted to eat but she said she'd be back to take our lunch orders when she comes back with our drinks.  Another server came with our drinks about 10 minutes later.  Where was our server?  She was nowhere to be found!  Another 10 minutes went by and then we saw her walking around and she finally looked our way and noticed that the entire family was giving her the ""eye"".  She completely forgot about us, it was so obvious.   Another 15 minutes then our food came.  The pizza was cold but whatever, we were like starving soldiers at war and we tore that pizza up anyway.  Our glasses were always empty and even when she noticed it, we still had to ask for refills.  Service was just all over the place - they need more attentive and experienced employees.   I'd so much rather make my way to Brea and drive the additional 10 miles or so.... at least I'll be eating my pizza fresh from the oven."
Yvonne Y.,"Ontario, CA",0,11,,5.0,4/22/2014,"I asked my friend Wanda to take care of setting up a 65th birthday party here for my husband while I was out of town.  What a great choice!!!  Everything was done professionally and ran very smoothly thanks to manager(s) Howard and Elin and their staff!  We had more people than we expected and they handled everything with ease.  The food was excellent; people are still calling to say how good everything was.  I am a regular and BJ's and have visited several of their restaurants.  But I must say, this is by far the best!  Again, thank you Howard and Elin for making our night special."
Mario R.,"Chino, CA",2,3,1,2.0,10/2/2011,The food here is great but don't come with a large group. All of are orders were not rite. We ordered an appetizer which they never brought out and tried to charge us Hell No. Not saying all BJ'S r like this but this one is.
Aaron G.,"Ontario, CA",3,26,3,4.0,5/27/2012,Great beer's good pizza. the only thing is bill can be a little high after all the beers
Mike S.,"Chino Hills, CA",4,51,2,4.0,2/26/2012,"I usually hit BJs on Friday afternoons for lunch and a beer or two.  Tiffany, our regular bartender is awesome.  She really knows her stuff and her pours are spot on.  As for weekday afternoon lunch visits the place is great.  Where I have a problem is going there with my wife forr drinks and appetizers in the bar and there are kids sitting in there!  I realize BJs is a family restaurant, I get that.  A family bar?  No.  The bar should be for the adults.  In the dining area the food is good, and service is always very attentive.  That's my issue with BJs...kids in the bar."
