Nina T.,"West Covina, CA",96,118,510,1.0,7/8/2017,"Bad experience today. Waitress was not attentive, not just to us but to her section. I've seen anoyher waitress go to her tables 3-4 times in the hour that we were there, and ours only came by once after taking our orders. Food took so long that we had to request it to be boxed right away because we were out of time (had to go back to work). Her response was that the kitchen was busy because there was a party of 50. Now, that was true, because there was a baby shower going on near us. But when we looked, they were all done eating! I even heard the host thanking her guests for coming and they were passing around the dessert....excuses excuses And i doubt that those people walked in with a party of 50. They prob booked the place well in advance. So that means the restaurant should have made sure there was enough staff on a SATURDAY to accommodate for the regular Sat business and the party of 50. The food in boxes finally came. When we checked, the fries were soggy already...so...the food had been sitting there, just that nobody brought it to us...ahem. My friend ordered no onions for her brisket burger, waitress repeated it back twice. When she got her burger...full of onions, the patty looked like someone took a bite cuz it was small and didn't even fill the burger, brisket off to one side, bacon on the other side....not appetizing. My Santa Fe salad with salmon...salmon tasted great...but where's the avocado? For an $18 salad that listed avocado in the description....I expect avocado. Definitely an off day for BJs...the waitress and the cooking staff.  The restaurant was moderately full, but there were still few empty tables and no wait....so they should be able to do better than that. We did see the manager go to the table next to ours and apologized for something, and offered a free salad or drinks or something. So again...bad day Chino Hills BJs? Or do u need better staff training?"
GlutenFree R.,"Los Angeles, CA",22,50,15,5.0,7/13/2017,Cameron is the best waiter ever! Can I take him to all the restaurants I go to? My family loves him. He hooked us up big time and was very nice. The food was delish and I like the new healthy and gluten free options. ( You need more gluten free and dairy options.) Good customer service overall.
Ryan C.,"Diamond Bar, CA",783,16,15,2.0,6/12/2017,"Went here last night to celebrate my niece's graduation. I was very disappointed at the service and food, with the server messing up my brother's order (the steak was still very raw when he said he wanted it well-done). My sweet potato fries were also cold by the time I got my dish, but the server was nice enough to get me new fresh warm ones. When we started eating, we've forgotten about the mishaps. I ordered the bbq burger, my niece also got a bacon burger. The pizooki was amazing, I love every single one of the trio we tried.  Okay so the worst part - I didn't feel well after dinner and started throwing up everything I ate. I asked my family the next morning and my niece got indigestion too from her burger. My brother also got indigestion from his steak. My other nieces that didn't have indigestion were the ones that didn't order any meaty items. They got pasta and salad, and they were fine. Moral of the story: DON'T ORDER the burger or steak here unless you want to puke out in the bathroom later. I was about to give one star but the pizooki is so good that I will only go back there for pizooki and not order anything else."
Lloyd P.,"Ontario, CA",6,51,9,1.0,6/2/2017,So I am having a rehearsal dinner and they bring the food and when it runs out of the endless buffet we wait 20 minutes for pizza or salad. This is fucked.  So it finally came with a salad yeah.  I guess chewing out the manager is a must.  I guess the concept of put 4 on the table put two more in the oven.  Something they should know.  We even have to order an extra pazooki so we did not run out.  I guess we had to think for them after all.   Luckily we pulled this off
Giselle V.,"Irvine, CA",213,282,1594,5.0,5/23/2016,Love this location!  Haven't really been to BJ's in a while because I was only going to the one in Rancho Cucamonga which had something wrong with it every single time I went.  This location is great though. The staff is friendly. The service is quick and they don't make you wait all day to get your drinks or food. I've been here twice so far and all of our orders have come out right both times with no complaints. We'll definitely be coming back to this location in the future since I feel confident that something won't go wrong every time I come.
debbiet t.,"Pomona, CA",147,39,45,5.0,7/16/2017,First time to bj's. Impressed w/ the variety of veggie selections. At lunch w/ my brother. Clean environment. Excellent service. Attentive service. Large and different selection of appetizers. I tried the veggie penne and my brother tried the boneless wings and fries. Fries were a bit too salty. Buffalo wings are good. Penne is awesome. Tried the peach tea. Excellent. Not sweet. My brother tried the draft Cream soda. He didn't like it. But loves the strawberry lemonade. The avocado egg rolls are awesome. Good place to come to for a variety of different food. Lots of pizza and burger selections. Definitely will return.
Lan K.,"Baldwin Park, CA",85,10,,4.0,7/19/2017,"Happy Hour at the bar is great! Prices are decent; $1 off house beers, $2 off appetizers and half off mini deep dish pizzas.  Service is good and fast! They also have daily specials which is great for regular dining with the family."
Brian H.,"Chino, CA",0,164,185,1.0,10/23/2017,"1 star because of the delicious pumpkin beer and that NFL games were on the tv's. Server took our order. Food came out in 3 waves. Kept having to ask for everything. Sister-in-laws pizza, salad, nephews milk, ketchup, our second beers, refills on ice tea, etc. My fish tacos were cold and not flavorful. Disappointed. Service was slow and we felt ignored. Server was not friendly either. Never apologized. I've always been a fan of BJ's, but this visit was below par. Sad."
Sky G.,"Ontario, CA",203,40,47,4.0,9/5/2017,Good service although I specially said that I wanted my pizookie with my food and the waitress told me she put it a little after so that I could eat my food ..... I SPECIFICALLY SAID I WANTED IT RIGHT NOW ..... anyways really good food
Dennise S.,"Apopka, FL",53,10,1,5.0,9/4/2017,"I got the ""carne asada"" pizza, I was hesitant to order it (sounds pretty weird) but it was AMAZING! Al the staff was very friendly and overall great service, even the manager check up on us, we got a free dessert for pur check in, the seasonal ""Strawberry shortcake "" was delicious!!"
Tyler L.,"Upland, CA",0,3,6,1.0,12/7/2017,"I visited BJs recently because I love this place but also because I had a gift card with a balance of $40 I had our waitress check the balance before we ordered to make sure there was money on the card. After we have finished our meal and we were ready to pay, I gave the waitress the gift card and she came back a few minutes later and informed me that their gift card machine wasn't working and there was nothing they could do for me so I just paid the bill and left. The manger didn't even have the decency to come and explain the situation to me. Wanting to give BJ's another try with the gift card so I called the number to check the balance and it now has a zero balance... I got ripped off."
Jorge L.,"Pomona, CA",0,5,,5.0,12/1/2017,Susan is awesome! She's a phenomenal server. Very friendly and kind. She's on top of her stuff!!!! Give this girl a raise!
Jessica P.,"San Dimas, CA",12,23,2,1.0,9/29/2017,"I hate writing bad reviews but it was my lunch hour and I don't want anyone to waste their whole lunch break waiting because the service here is sub par.  I placed a to go order 4:24 to be ready for 5:00.  I arrived at 5:24 to give them plenty of time as I only have a 35 minute lunch.  And it wasn't ready.  I just ordered a tomato and mozzarella salad, stuffed mushrooms and a pizookie. Come on guys?  Over an hour for all that?  When I walked in the poor girl at take out was by herself and so slammed she didn't even look up at me for at least 5 minutes."
Gunzal G.,"Los Angeles, CA",22,23,2,1.0,2/19/2017,"Wtf BJs?! How is this pizza half sweet pig and half great white? It looks like a hot mess. I usually love your pizzas but you'll messed up this time and on my cheat day!!! Not cool BJs, not cool!"
Ashley C.,"Riverside, CA",110,31,12,4.0,9/22/2017,"Great weekly deals, we have a favorite server, Stephen, place is always packed at dinner time with a wait to sit. Loud environment. Clean area. I hate that the walkways are so small. Always choose to sit in a booth so You don't get caught in the walkway. The middle section of the restaurant is the worst. But going for an amazing server makes the trip worth it every time"
Dinora R.,"Glendora, CA",1,36,4,5.0,9/21/2017,Great Sunday Football Happy Hour all day.. I got the honey Sriracha Brussels sprouts and root beer ribs for about $6 each and my fave very burst cider for $4 happy hour price.....our waiter was the best we have ever had.. we was very attentive and specially with soda refills for my fiancé (which is normally an issue since she has to sometimes ask for a refill twice before getting one). We will def be back
Y M A.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,4,,1.0,7/27/2017,"OK. So we got 2 Sam Adams & ordered a Thin Crust Medium Veggie Pizza.  they brought a Flat Bread Veggie Pizza. By far, the worst pizza ever. I mean I would rather have Chuck E Cheese or Little Caesars Pizza than this Flat Bread piece of crap. I would have never touched if   I wasn't starving. They should at least either states on the Menu, or Clearly tell customers they don't have a Thin Crust Pizza. Awful Pizza, not fit for Human Consumption at all...But, I really enjoyed That Boston Lager though..."
Ralph R.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,5,2,2.0,3/1/2017,Our waiter if you can call him that was oblivious to us.... We waited over 30 minutes for our food on a Wednesday night which I might add was a very slow night also my food came out look warm! Also waiter didn't know how to split half cash half card????his excuse was he didn't see the cash so he just ran the card.... Very disappointed in service will not be coming back  Here's some advice don't order flatbread nachos sorry excuse if you can call them that
Ashley K.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,12,1,5.0,9/21/2017,"Love it here! We were lucky enough to have Cameron as our waiter! He made great suggestions, he was friendly, bubbly and without a doubt the hardest working waiter we have ever had!! Looking forward to coming back!"
Laycee B.,"San Bernardino, CA",26,34,17,1.0,7/16/2017,"This location repeatedly serves food over 30-45 minutes after your order. Their structure in the kitchen needs to be revisited, or they are simply short handed. Either way, I won't be returning."
