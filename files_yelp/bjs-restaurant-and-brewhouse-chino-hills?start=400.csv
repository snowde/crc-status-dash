Xiaoyu Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",516,57,26,2.0,1/7/2011,I am a big fan of Bj's Restaurant and Brewhouse but I would avoid this one at all costs because the service always sucks here and the food never tastes like it was just prepared.  I would say if I were to base my opinion of Bj's on this one alone I would probably never visit any of them.  This location's size is also very small there are separate rooms and it seems like they have less televisions than other locations.  I wouldn't come here for a sports outing with my friends I would hit up the one in West Covina instead.
Ian M.,"Chino, CA",3,12,,4.0,4/2/2014,Get great service unless it's a Friday or Saturday than you are screwed. The manager was suppose to come out and talk to us like the server said she would 4 times but it never happen
Martin P.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,18,1,4.0,5/7/2012,"I have always thought of BJ's as a bar with food.  My wife had met her friends there many times for drinks and something called a pazookie.  I was not in a particular mood for anything, so when she suggested BJ's I agreed.  I ordered the New York Strip steak without any great expectations; after all, it's a bar.  The steak, with the white cheddar mashed potatoes was fantastic.  Now I can hardly wait to go back!!"
Valerie H.,"Eastvale, CA",54,167,1,2.0,11/30/2008,"Went back 11/30 - a full 2 months after opening. The staff is still lagging behind - if not worse than on the opening week.  Today I was at a table with 3 people.  Behind me was a party of 8 or so.  The other two people at my table were served their meal well before me because another server - who had nothing to do with either one of the tables - hijacked my plate to give to the cute guy with the party of 8.  So I sat there - without a dinner and 7 people at the other table sat there without their dinners for atleast 10 minutes (which was silly because it was a salad) while my waiter and the waitresss assigned to the other table tried to figure out what happened. The server who gave my meal to the other table had nothing to do with either one of our tables - she was just one of those 'floaters' that pass out food to help the wait staff.   The manager came over as soon as our waiter alterted her to the problem - which was actually excellent.  She deducted my entire meal off the bill.  She also compensated the party of 8's table - but I dont know what she offfered. So, Im still hoping to rate this pladce higher..... someday...."
Gina V.,"Pasadena, CA",158,50,8,3.0,12/22/2008,"So this review is just for the Chino Hills BJ's.   First thought... ""wow, when did they build this"".   Second thought ""this is it?"".  Smallish.   The bar area leaves something to be desired.   So the saving grace (and the additional star) is the FREAKIN PUMPKIN ALE...... YUUUUUUUUUMMMMMMMYYYY!!! for reals, no joke.. it ROCKED!  Also, I am in love with the appitzer sampler plate- Minus the chicken roll thing-y.. since I dont eat meat... but it is perfect to share, and is perfect with that freakin yummy pumpkin ale. :)  My friend said his salmon was cooked perfectly.   Service was a bit slow, but not slow enough to get all huffy about.   I would definetly dine again. .. too bad that rockin pumpkin ale is seasonal.  (did I mention I LOVED the pumkin ale?).. yee!"
M. D.,"Claremont, CA",28,176,149,3.0,8/16/2011,"We came here to celebrate a friend's birthday, this is not a regular stop for us and sad to say that it will continue to be that way.  The servers here are young and seem to only care about how much you order.  Not only that but we were handed off 3 times!  We had 4 different servers that night!  And of course there was a mistake on the bill that I'm guessing they were hoping we wouldn't catch. Look, we had drinks, we had appetizers, we had entrees, AND we had dessert!  How much more did they want us to order?  The drinks we had were good but extremely expensive especially with very little alcohol in the mixed drinks. The beer selection was decent. All of the food was decent though nothing spectacular but the pizookie thing was ridiculously good. With the service, I just hate being hounded to order something else even if it is 'with a smile'"
Veronica P.,"Chino Hills, CA",447,409,1771,3.0,9/27/2008,"BJ's is slated to open on September 29, 2008, however, they are currently in training.  I was fortunate enough to get invited to their ""soft opening"". The restaurant is very nicely decorated.  Unlike many of the BJ's that I've been to, this one is nice and open.  There is actually space to move around in the bar area, with plenty of bar seating, table tops, booths and standing room.  The rest of the dining room is also spacious and has a big open, airy feel. The menu was rather limited for the soft opening, with a choice of an appetizer or dessert in addition to an entree. The appetizer was a set of four sliders in conventional White Castle size and style.  Grilled patty with onions.  Lettuce, tomato and pickles were also provided. The blackened NY Strip steak was great.  Perfectly cooked to a nice medium rare, it had a lot of flavor and was nice and juicy.  Although blackened, it wasn't really all that spicy.  I would definitely come back for the steak. The pot roast was somewhat of a dissapointment.  Although the meat was nice and tender with a lot of flavor, there were huge chunks of fat that could have been mistaken for potatoes in the dish. The Caesar Salad was nice and crisp, however, it was way over dressed which caused the lettuce to start to wilt.  Freshly grated Parmesan cheese, crunchy croutons and a zingy dressing made up for things. The famous Pizookie ended things.  We were given a half Chocolate Chip/ half White Chocolate Mac Nut Pizookie which was slightly undercooked to give a more chewy texture.  Paired with ice cream, this was a winner. As expected for a soft opening, there are some bugs that need to be worked out.  Our appetizer, soup and salad order were apparently not put in, and had to remind the wait staff.  They came out after the entrees were presented. I have a feeling things will improve and BJ's will certainly be a nice addition to the neighborhood."
Janice T.,"Walnut, CA",25,27,,3.0,12/19/2011,"This BJ's is like most BJ's however the difference is that their servive is quite slow, and I went in the middle of the afternoon, more than half the resturant was empty but our waiter still took a long time to bring out our food and drinks. BJ's is usually pricy but their Monday through Friday lunch specials that make their meals more worth it."
Logan H.,"San Clemente, CA",7,113,21,3.0,8/4/2013,"bjs is good but their pastas have fallen of the map, and  their food has been lacking. they are trying heavy for their bar scene. and it shows by the pallet of their menu. which is why you can see they are constantly trying to come out with new items on their menu"
Greg C.,"Rumson, NJ",7,8,,4.0,3/10/2012,"One of my favorite places to go while traveling.  The apricot ale is one of my favorite beers I have ever had and look forward to it every time I come back.  Prices are very reasonable and the food always tastes great no matter what I get.  The pizza, salads and sandwiches have all been good every time.   We even had a little too much fun one evening and our group spilled a tequila shot on the table.  Our waitress quickly brought another and we were not charged.  My only beef is that there are no BJ's on the east coast."
Kay M.,"Henderson, NV",0,15,,1.0,5/31/2012,"Apparently 'BJ's' means this place really blows!!  We arrived before the lunch crowd, only to wait 15 minutes before the waitress got around to asking us what we would like to drink (2 diet cokes).  As the restaurant filled up, people who came in AFTER us began to get their meals and the waitress had NOT even taken our food order.  Eventualy the order was placed, but we had to ask the waitress twice where our food was, both times she disappeared for 5-10 minutes.   Upon returning the second time, she said the manager would be over to speak with us.  The manager did show up and apologized profusely, then gave us some b.s. story about having an 'influx of customers all at once' (hello, it's lunch time-isn't that what happens???).  I was quick to point out that we arrived before the crowd, but the manager continued with her nonsense: 'we didn't plan on a graduation party coming in'.  Again, I told her we arrived before all those folks she was referring to.  After 40 minutes of waiting, only my friend's order was served and I had to wait another 10 minutes for my food.  By the time my food arrived, my friend was done eating. It was only AFTER telling the waitress that we would never return, that the manager took care of our check.   I wish I could give zero stars, but I will have to be satified with the one star and say that ""I will NEVER return to this restaurant"". Here's a little hint:  Next time an order gets misplaced or not submitted, fess up and offer a free appetizer-honesty goes a long way."
Andrew M.,"Los Angeles, CA",146,295,176,4.0,6/27/2009,"I seriously hate all these cookie cutter restaurants that serve bad food in nice atmosphere. I have been at this location 3 times and the first two times, had the pizza and such here. As usual, the food sucks. This time, tried the bacon ranch club and it was actually pretty freaking good. The skinny fries went well with the sandwich and they have gotten some points with me but I will never come here unless it is forced."
Danielle P.,"Chino Hills, CA",39,27,5,5.0,8/29/2010,"We had our color guard banquet here, and they let us play our slideshow on the flatscreen, which was really cool. The pizzas are delicious! They're overflowing with toppings, which adds so many calories, but it tastes so good! We ordered several party pazookies for our banquet, and they were devoured in about five minutes! The cookie's still warm, and the chocolate chips are melted, which is to die for with the ice cream on top! They also are the only place around chino hills that has gluten free meals! Can't wait to go back, I love this place."
Vanilli H.,"Pomona, CA",24,33,3,3.0,6/17/2011,"This is probably the friendliest bj's I've ever gone to. The one in west covina is way too loud, and the one in ontario gave me food poisoning, so this one is my happy medium. The food is mediocre, go for the pizzas and salads, their pizookie and brownie however can't be beat! Their signature beers are not that great IMHO, but the best seasonal they have is their June beer, the Nitwit. They are usually out of my beloved Boddington's, so I usually settle for a Smithwick's. I wish they would serve Fransiskaner or Murphy's stout here. But what can I expect? It's a chain eatery. For all the reasons given above, this place gets a solid 3 stars."
Kristen H.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,4,,5.0,12/29/2013,Absolutely love BJ's! The pazookies are a must... I love that you can get half and half for the cookie. The atmosphere is friendly and is great for groups. Had Jaclyn W. as our server and she is the best! Would recommend this location to anyone!
Stacy V.,"Simi Valley, CA",5,42,,4.0,8/29/2009,"When BJ's in Chino Hills first opened, the service was horrible.  Since BJ's is a chain, you expect that the opening of a new location will go smoothly, but in this case it was pretty disastrous.  That was a couple of years ago, however, and the management seems to have all their ducks in a row. The food is very good.  I don't think I've ever had something here that I didn't love.  The portions are large enough to eat half and take half home.  I highly recommend that you use this strategy so that you can have dessert.  If you go to BJ's, you must, must, MUST have a PAZOOKIE!!!  Best dessert, EVER.  The beer selection is awesome, too.   I would not recommend getting take out from BJ's.  It's not that the restaurant does something wrong, it's just that the food here is better when it's fresh. Another note: beware of homecoming and prom season when you go to BJ's.  It's a popular place for groups of high school students to go before the big dances, and they are always obnoxious (you know, kids these days!!!)  You'll have to take your kids home before your food comes because the girls are literally popping out of their dresses (parents, please pay attention to what your teenage daughters are wearing!!!)  This is completely not the restaurant's fault, but you may want to be aware of it!"
Steb M.,"Chino, CA",1,50,,5.0,10/24/2011,Came here for a group party. They reserved the back room for us. The waitress was constant making sure everyone was taken care of. The Pasta and pizza were excellent.  Atmosphere and decor of the place is nice. Excactly like the one in Industry
Joel K.,"Chino Hills, CA",2,27,,5.0,3/17/2011,"Can I just tell you that these folks are great! They are very good at making sure you are taken care of. I eat out 95% of my meals and this is one of my favorite places to hit for lunch during the week. I must say I only have hit the one in Vegas for evening dining. The one near my office is amazing for lunch. Again they slow with service from the kitchen when they opened, but they have their groove now. So Please check em out if you haven't already!"
CJ Q.,"Chino, CA",19,69,4,3.0,12/9/2008,"The gf and I decided to hit this spot up (last Sun night) - the first time at this location for both of us.  There was quite a bit of wait.  When we first walked in, my gf looked at me and said, ""Is this IT?!""  The restaurant is small - much smaller than the others.  We were told 20 mins tops for the wait and were given a 'pager'.  We hung out at the bar, had some drinks and laughed up a storm.   She got a Hef and I, on the other hand, had a rough week so I went strong and hard. LOL.  I got the classic martini, grey goose vodka, extra dirty, extra olives.  YUM-O!  After 30-40 mins, we realized that our pager hadn't gone off yet (booze was to blame).  Turns out, they never entered our name or the pager # onto their list!  GRRR  We got seated right away and were served promptly though.  Food was good, service was great.  We had the stuffed potato (whoa, huge!), chicken sandwich and pizookies - that's all I really wanted.  Really. Con:  You forgot us at the bar, BJ.  Lucky for you, we were in a giddy mood, thanks to the yummy drinks.  Minus 1 star for you."
I S.,"Irvine, CA",7,58,39,1.0,12/7/2009,"Go to the BJ's in brea...I was really happy when they opened this one since it's close to home, but they mess up almost every single time i go there...if you want anything after you get your food, wait about 20 to maybe 30 min, and you'll get it...also, the pizza or pasta or anything you really order here is very likely not going to come out the way you want it...maybe i'm being too harsh, but it's like that for me almost every time..I've completely stopped going here, its just like, if you're going to spend a decent amount of money on eating out, you have to get good service and good food, or at least one of the two, here, you will not get either"
