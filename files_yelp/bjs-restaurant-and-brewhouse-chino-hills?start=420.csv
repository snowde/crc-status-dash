John H.,"Chino, CA",0,2,,1.0,2/15/2012,"My Wife and I went to the B J's in Chino Hills because of their add that they now have a Gluten Free menu. My Wife has Celiac Disease which is an allergy to most grains. After waiting for about 20 minutes for a seat in the bar we were seated and placed drink orders. In the next 10 minutes we were asked if we wanted to order drinks by three more servers. We finally told one of the servers that we were still waiting for a Beer and a Margarita, We finally got them. My Wife ordered the Gluten Free Pizza and a salad. The salad was served with croutons on it (dried bread) which had to be remade, I was finished with my salad by the time they brought one without croutons for my Wife. Her salad was delivered at the same time as her pizza and my gumbo came after she had finished he salad and two pieces of pizza. After we were finished we couldn't find our server to get the check, found out that her shift had ended and she went home. The manager had to find the bill and we were finally out of there fifteen minutes after we were done eating. I have eaten at B J's all over the country but won't go to the one that is three minutes from my front door. This was the second time I had very poor service at this B J's. To top it off I sent an e-mail complaining via their website and never got a response."
Amanda R.,"Murrieta, CA",350,108,57,3.0,10/4/2010,So I have come to the conclusion that all BJ's are the same regardless of which location you dine at. On my recent visit to this location on my way back from a taping of the Let's Make a Deal game show I discovered the common trait to all BJ's restaurants....bad service. We sat in the bar with hopes of getting served quickly and our waiter took our drink and food order. We expressed that we were really starving and he told us he would get our appetizer out asap. Needless to say our ap was not brought. Instead our food arrived and I had to ask where it was. I was told it would be out soon and I said to just cancel it as our food had already arrived. They ended up giving it to us anyway. Is it really that hard to bring out an appetizer before the meal? I think not....
Mike F.,"Chino Hills, CA",46,46,7,4.0,2/7/2011,Had the biggest piece of salmon I've ever seen and it was great. A nice (albeit overpriced) glass of wine and a bowl of soup to go with it and I'm a happy camper. Wife and kids enjoyed theirs too. Service was great.
Savanna E.,"Arcadia, CA",0,12,,3.0,5/2/2013,"HAve been here a few times. The first time wasn't very memorable so it wasn't the best and not the worst. I remember one time we visited my hot wings were cold..and we were missing wings on our plate. So we told the server she took it back and I think they just reheated cause the wings were  not crispy, I think it was a busy night so the service was slow..I went recently with my husband and Mother in law and everything was good. I guess it depends on the server you get and the cook...service is not consistent.."
Dawn K.,"Diamond Bar, CA",3,170,80,2.0,8/23/2010,"I like BJs food, but the service at the Brea location was always so terrible that we never went. So far, so-so for BJs Chino Hills. Consistant food quality but the servers were rude. I think the location is not the greatest though, I always forget it is there!"
Brian D.,"Corona, CA",0,8,1,5.0,11/29/2012,"This is my favorite BJ's, it's large and has a full menu. Great place to watch football and have beers."
Melissa S.,"Riverside, CA",423,139,99,1.0,1/14/2010,"only came here for a pazookie. we sat in the bar area. the waitress was nice, took about 15mins to hand us menus. we already knew what we wanted and ordered it. got our waters-sipped on it right away, after about another 15mins the pazookie came. i was handed a sticky spoon with chocolate on it - seemed like it was sitting there for a while. waved down our waitress to get a new spoon. she came with a new spoon that was just as dirty as the chocolate spoon. i said F this.. used the water i was drinking and poured some on the spoon, wiped it with the napkin. ""THERE! that's how clean it should be!"" the bf looking at me all crazy.. im not about to get sick from someone else's dirty spoon! sheesh.  after we devoured the pazookie -which never fails, i looked at my water- theres brown sh!t floating in it! ugh!!! so took a sip of the bf's water. waiting for our check i noticed something sticking inside of the cup of my bf's water. i scraped with it the straw and it was some kind of white sh!t. UGH!! NEVER COMING BACK TO THAT BJS AGAIN! not even for water!"
L L.,"Corona, CA",196,25,,1.0,8/14/2014,"One time I came to this location and had the ABSOLUTE worst service that I have ever experienced before. My mom and I came here and asked for a booth one weekday night. The hostess told us that we had to wait extra, which we replied that we didn't mind. Another group came in and asked for a booth as well, and they were seated right away at a booth. So we went to ask about our table, it had been 20 minutes since we put our name down. They said our table was ready and sat us at a table top, not a booth. We had waited 20 minutes for a regular table... We politely reminded them that we had asked for a booth, so we stood in the restaurant while they cleaned a booth for us. Then the waiter came and dropped off the menus, but did not acknowledge us or ask for our drink order. He went over to another table to go talk with some girls who were just seated right after us. It took another 10 minutes for him to come over and FINALLY acknowledge us, and get our drink order. Another 10 minutes and our drinks didn't come yet, but the girls' table already got their appetizers and drinks (because it had been 20 min since we were all seated). Finally, after 50 minutes of coming into the restaurant, we were upset. We asked the hostess at the front to speak to the manager. She got the manager (shift manager) and proceeded to tell him (while we could hear her) that we were rude and impatient. So we went and talked with the new shift manager, told him our story and that we were leaving but that we wanted to let him know that we would never come back. He apologized and gave us a complimentary gift card, and spoke with the rude hostess and waiter. My mom and I went to the Corner Bakery instead, and were able to eat within 10 minutes instead of 50."
Allison J.,"San Diego, CA",561,858,2572,3.0,10/6/2009,"If you've had BJs at one place, it's the same at any other chain.  So as far as service, this place was pretty great.  Lively and fun atmosphere, especially during happy hour and because it's football season the bar area had plenty of tv action...  And beer... phenomenal... i'm not a beer drinker at all... so waitress gave us 5 different beers to sample for free before ordering.  Their fruity beers were the ones that appealed to me.  So the seller for this place is great service and free beer (samples)!"
Joe R.,"Chino Hills, CA",39,137,1,3.0,6/4/2012,"Shitty... all food came out cold, manager cut off customer as they were addressing the complaint (speech).  Took a hour before we ate.  But they did give us the meal for free, after talking to the 2nd manager.  You guys need to step it up, this would be 1 star if that meal wasn't free.  I even told the manager, I didn't want anything, this was a heads up/fyi."
Kerry W.,"Chino Hills, CA",141,253,130,4.0,11/10/2009,"Generally pretty good food. Its a chain restaurant so dont get to excited, but I will say the pizzas are very good. The salads are good and the pizzookie YUM!!  The beer is fantastic. They are not very creative in styles or make anything that would win a national competition, but the Pirana Pale Ale is very very good. Nice hop on a perfectly balanced malt.. Go for the Beer/Pizza and pizzookie, thats the core that makes this place a good stop."
Kaye M.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",335,185,4,4.0,10/23/2008,"ALSO smaller in size than the average BJ's, and no brewery here.  I see a trend...from the outside, that Lucille's that is opening also looks mighty tiny compared to other Lucille's.  I really think that Chino Hills city planning may have something to do with this.  Anyhow, I will now move on.  I promise: This BJ's is really pretty, and I love the setup.  Apparently, lots of people do, because it is always packed.  The ENTIRE section of the parking lot is ALWAYS full.  Sometimes I feel like every single person in this BJ's decided they's drive themselves and there is literally one car per person in the restaurant.  The bar area is tiny; barstools, one row of hightop tables, a row of small booths and like, 2 group booths.  Then there are 2 dining areas.  One that can potentially be roped off for groups and parties and such.  There is also a completely different window and waiting area for takeout orders- they get their own little nook. The wait on the Friday night we went was bearable, since I'd already reached and passed my point of starvation and was now in the hunger-denial portion of my night.  We were seated and proceeded to order drinks.  I gave my extremely choosy drink order to the extremely friendly waitress and when it was gross the first time around, she made sure to get me another so it would be right.  I do appreciate this, because for me, drinking a pint glass full of overly sweet liquid is not an option.  My boyfriend had already eaten, and so I just got the Balsamic Glazed Chicken.  It was SO good!  I loved it.  I asked for no mashed potatoes, I just wanted some sliced tomato on the side, and girl, it was the best quasi-salad I have had.  Chicken was so tender and juicy for breast meat, and the onion straws over top were perfect.  So good, I can't believe I'm still talking about BJ's, land of dishwater mashed potatoes and soggy banquet vegetable mix. I like BJ's, especially during Happy Hour with Long Islands in pint glasses.  So, I am happy about this opening so close to the bf's house.  We'll surely treat it as we do any BJ's- - it's there when you need it."
Harry W.,"Walnut, CA",3,6,7,2.0,7/17/2010,I rarely go to BJ's... but to begin with the service is not very good... the help is not very helpful... and the food is subpar... last time I went I order a Chicken Salad and I got it served without Chicken... when he finally brought me the chicken I was done with my salad... And a few times before I really didnt think to highly about BJ's
Vinny S.,"Los Angeles, CA",113,157,44,5.0,1/21/2012,"super nice and clean not too crowded. friendly bartenders. try the $3.99 ahi bites, with extra wasabi...AWESOME"
B A.,"Alhambra, CA",8,49,29,4.0,6/27/2011,"The only time I ever go to this location is for their weekend brunch. I always get the breakfast pizza and it's so amazingly good. Service is always good and I recently had a good experience getting my Fatherd Day 2011 pint glass for free! I highly recommend this location for the weekend brunch. Not sure about their dinner/pizzas, but I'm sure it's as good as the other locations."
rox z.,"Chino, CA",112,43,28,4.0,2/27/2009,"i liked it. the first time i went, we just went for dessert and drinks and our server was super awesome!! she was so friendly and checked back on us frequently but not annoyingly so. the entire staff was great and the manager even asked us how everything was and on the way out like 4 people wished us a good night and thanked us for dining. the second time our server was tired...i think. she forgot our silverware and the pizza we ordered was missing the cilantro. oh well, overall it was pretty cool."
Lori B.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,2,,2.0,8/5/2011,"Horrible customer service!! I called and still had to wait an hour before we were seated. The host and hostess had horrible personalities. It was like they were doing us a favor. The server was great and the food was good, not great. We were celebrating a birthday and finishing our drinks when the host came to our table and asked to leave because they had another reservation waiting.....what? Never have we been sitting and having conversation and asked to leave. It was already 9:30 and the restraurant was emptying out. WE LEFT, and will never return!!!"
JD M.,"Chino Hills, CA",42,13,,1.0,7/29/2011,"I have been here at least 10 times since they open.  I only came back after the first two times because of birthdays etc.  Anyway, the service was always slow.  And when I was in here last week for a business lunch, the kitchen manager set my plate down on my glasses and scratched them.  Did he see them and put them down on them anyway?  Did he not look?  And he didn't apologize.  Then a lady came out after I had told my server to get the manager, and I asked the lady,""Why do I always have a problem when I come here?""  The woman at the business lunch also got a wrong order, and we had to wait 10 minutes to get her tacos out to her.  The lady said she was sorry about it and hopefully I would give them another try.  Why?  100$ pair of glasses are trash for a 8.95 plate.  Which I still had to pay for.  unacceptable."
marcus c.,"Ontario, CA",1,28,1,4.0,6/21/2009,"I have had a few had experience with BJ's, but at a different location (Ontario/Rancho). I swore to myself that i would NEVER put myself back in that situation where i would experience their horrible service. However, I was forced to attend a 21st birthday dinner and surprisingly my experience at the Chino Hills BJ's was amazing. We had a party of 25 and were offered excellent service on a Friday night. O yeah, and their pizzas are simply DELICIOUS!!"
Jamie F.,"Chino, CA",43,90,25,4.0,12/13/2010,"Our family is a big fan of BJ's in general.  We were so excited to see that this one was built a couple of years ago.  We to this one because it's close to home.  Most BJ's Restaurants are pretty much the same.  I have to say that this particular one is like the others.  We get great food and good service.  I did have an incident at this BJ's earlier this year, but after the incident the VP of BJ's called me personally and apologized for the situation and wanted to make sure that would would continue to be patrons of BJ's.  I appreciate them going out of their way to make sure that we were happy and they did everything they could do to rectify the problem. The only reason why it's missing the 5th star is because there are times when we've had to wait quite a while even though we already had a prearranged party scheduled."
