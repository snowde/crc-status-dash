Ken K.,"San Dimas, CA",0,17,,2.0,9/8/2009,"I specifically Yelped to review comments and found my experience was the same as everyone else. The service was so bad it made everything else bad.  A went with a group of business owners from Chino and we will not be back. Unless I have a need to be insulted and treated with an attitude. We even spoke to the manager, which seems to fully support this treatment by his staff.  Chino Hills is over built with restaurants so  find us at one of the other great dining experiences."
