Sarah M.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,10,4,5.0,7/20/2017,"Went here last night for free pizookie day. Great food as usual, and incredible service. Martin M. and Rafael were fantastic servers. Can't wait to come back!!"
Ashley K.,"Chino Hills, CA",83,2,,5.0,9/25/2017,"I had a great experience tonight at BJs! I had ordered a deep dish ziti and what was brought out to me was basically penne noodles in cheese and oil. We were disappointed at first but our waiter, Alex, came to the rescue. I was able to order another dish and he was so patient and understanding about the issue. He then offered to bring my boyfriend new soup as well since it had gone cold during our wait. Alex was an all around great waiter and he went out of his way to make sure we were happy with our meals :) We wanted to do a survey for him to show management how much we appreciated what he did for us but we didn't know exactly how so Yelp it is! If you go to this location and have him as your waiter, you won't be let down!"
Becca D.,"Los Angeles, CA",38,143,59,1.0,6/30/2017,"Came in on a Monday at around 6 pm and it was a nightmare. We waited over 30 minutes for our table of 7. When we were seated, we were put in a corner of the restaurant where there were tons of open tables (we were wondering why we couldn't have been seated there earlier?).  The waiter took our drink orders, most of us got water with lemon. He brought waters without lemons, and when my aunt tried to ask him about the lemons he answered quickly ""I'm going to bring you guys a bowl of lemons."" Okay, sure. He takes our food order. And then time passes... It took atleast another 35 minutes for us to get our food. Meanwhile, we were absolutely freezing. Its summer and hot so no one brought sweaters, but it was FREEZING to the point where it was super uncomfortable and my cousin and I were trying to use our napkins as blankets. We tailed our waiter down(wasn't the easiest) and asked to turn the air down and he said he would tell a manager. Not sure if it happened. When the food finally arrived, I asked again about the lemons, and the waiter says ""oh I didn't see any back there but I'll double check.""  Next time he comes back is maybe 10-15 minutes later and says ""don't want you guys to think I forgot about you but there's no lemons."" Lol I don't know how a full bar + restaurant would be out of lemons...  When he came to pick up our plates we put in an order for a pizookie + a bday pizookie.  Then we waited some more... Another 20+ minutes... And he walks by and is like ""you guys haven't gotten your pizookies yet?"" And then our pizookies came out maybe 5-10 minutes later.  Overall I felt our server was not being genuine and was being really careless. We were at the restaurant over 2 hours because each step took over 30 minutes. Never returning to this location. Epic nightmare."
Mary Anna M.,"Long Beach, CA",781,398,140,4.0,6/24/2016,The chicken parmesan is SO good. Seriously. And get extra sauce.  There was a long wait but it was a busy Friday night and we had a big group. Our waiter was nice and very accommodating. Good location.
Stephanie M.,"Chino, CA",0,13,7,5.0,9/1/2017,"I wish they were a little cheaper but I'm a regular for a reason. Love the seared ahi salad, the herbs they season the ahi with are awesome. And their avocado toast at brunch on the weekends is amazing."
Hoover A.,"Chino Hills, CA",95,11,,1.0,8/30/2017,"I'm very disappointed with this restaurant, I always came here to eat and was hoping to go here for my birthday but with how my girlfriend was treated I'll probably never come back. She asked some questions about a dish and was laughed at and she felt humiliated. They thought because they were behind a door she couldn't hear but she did. No help with management or even an apology."
Chris B.,"Riverside, CA",113,5,,5.0,8/26/2017,"We came in for brunch and our server Shaun did an excellent job he kept good conversation, kept smiles on our faces and kept our drinks full all while serving 5-10 other tables! Keep up the good work Shaun."
Brookie C.,"Diamond Bar, CA",9,34,,1.0,10/31/2017,"I came in with my daughter and grandson yesterday.  We are at the hostess desk and several people/employees are going about their business.  Not a single ""we will be with you,"" nothing.   A young lady, very polite, seats us after a while.  Our server takes our order pretty quickly, but it takes quite a while to get our order.  We ordered ahi salads -- which took a long time to get -- and a mini pizza that looked and tasted more like bread with cheese on it; it was lukewarm.  I had to ask for napkins.  A very RUDE girl brought out our order to us.  We kept saying thank you and she just stood quiet and was awkward.   If you hate your job, you should quit. Then I notice we did not have forks.  Our server did not bother asking how everything was.  I got his attention to get ""forks, please.""  SERVER:  ""Oh, you need forks?  Okay.  No problem.""  Really?  Of course we need forks. How else would you eat a salad?  I hope it's not a problem either to bring forks.  While we are waiting, we see the rude girl again and ask her if she can check on the forks and told her our server said he would bring them, and her attitude was he will do it.    The salads did not taste like the ones I had before because they were missing cilantro, green onions, red peppers and few other ingredients.  I looked at the menu to verify this, and I was correct.  I told our server, who offered to have new ones made, I said no thank you because we needed to get going soon.  THEY HAD ALREADY TAKEN LONG ENOUGH, but I did not want to be rude.  Our server never asked me if we needed refills.  Oh, wait, he did when he gave us the bill.    He took one of the salads off the bill, but that is not what we were looking for.  We came here to eat and expected what we ordered to taste good and to be prepared correctly.  How hard is it to make a salad and the pizza you are known for?  What really got to me was the overall rudeness of the staff.  Our server was polite, but not very good at all.  We had to ask for napkins, silver, and never got a refill or a ""how is everything?""  I am surprised because I have been here when it is busy in the evening and the food is better and servers are way more polite.  Perhaps you need to brush up your daytime crew.  If people take the time to come in to your restaurant and spend their money, you really should not behave like a bunch of rude people who do not want to be bothered.  Without customers, you would not have a job."
Jennifer B.,"Upland, CA",1,3,,1.0,6/14/2017,"Not sure why I never posted this, but better late than never.  I will never eat at this particular location ever again.  I emailed the following letter to the general manager of the restaurant twice with no response.  I also sent the same letter to corporate without any response. Dear Mr. Smith, I am writing to air my complaints about the very poor managerial service that I received at your restaurant in Chino Hills on the 15th of October which have spoiled our high expectations of your restaurant and eventually spoiled the evening for my family. We were a party of 12 arriving at approximately 10 pm.  Kassandra, our server took very good care of us the entire time.  Karen Keys, manager on duty, however, did not.   After completing our late dinner, we ordered 1 pizookie for all to share.  My niece took a bite and unfortunately spit out a large piece of glass.  Mind you, we all took bites that may have had small pieces of glass as well.  We informed our server who immediately reported it to Karen.  Perhaps the worse part is when Karen approached our table with an unnecessary comment/question, ""Who's the lucky person?"". My husband expressed his disappointment and we all wished that she had been more apologetic rather than sarcastic.  After stating that she wanted to take care of half of our bill, she gave my niece a $25 BJ's gift card and took off 2 appetizers from our total.  Not quite half, as our  total was $192 including tip. Instead of having to speak with Karen again, we opted to just fill out the incident report and leave the establishment.    We dine at this particular restaurant quite often, but sadly, I don't think we'll ever return.  A good number of our party have either worked at a restaurant or are currently working in the restaurant industry.  We believe in giving and receiving great customer service.  We were appalled at the way in which this incident was handled.  Working in health care myself, I know that this incident has the potential of causing great harm.  Having said this, we do not take this incident lightly.  We are upset and hope you can rectify this situation.  Thank you for taking time to read this and I hope to hear from you or your corporate manager soon."
Prince M.,"Chino, CA",4,84,143,3.0,5/27/2017,Food was good and dessert!  Just way too busy and under staff.  I do enjoy the bar and it's amenities!
Cindy B.,"Bell, CA",434,289,243,4.0,12/6/2016,"Came here this past Sunday, doesn't surprise me that the restaurant was extremely busy. We waited about 45 minutes to be seated, which I didn't mind since I was looking forward to having my favorite dish, the balsamic glazed chicken.  We got seated and decided to looked over the drink menu since I already knew what I wanted for dinner. When it was time to place my order, I asked for the balsamic glazed chicken and the waiter said that it was removed from the menu because they weren't ordering some of the ingredients the plate requires. I am really hoping that it was only at this location and not the one I usually go to. Anyhow, I decided to go with the shrimp asparagus penne pasta, it was delicious! The shrimp was nicely cooked, the asparagus was nice a crunchy and the pasta wasn't soggy. I think I found my new favorite plate."
Sean Y.,"Chino Hills, CA",63,3,,2.0,5/13/2017,"5 star service, 2 star for food quality. Our waiter was attentive and friendly and couldn't have been more helpful. Unfortunately both my girlfriend and I thought something tasted a little off in our soups before our main dishes. I even mentioned to her I bit into something strangely chewy that wasn't the normal consistency of the soup. We didn't give it much thought at dinner but a few hours after and all through the night we were both sick to our stomachs. It's unfortunate because we actually love BJs restaurant but will not be returning to this location."
Jo J.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,6,1,3.0,5/28/2017,"We always love BJs food and service. Not so much tonight. Waited 30 minutes for our orders to arrive..and they are all appetizers. Our waiter, David B, for those 30 minutes while we were waiting, did not even once came up to us. We had to look for him and told him that we are still waiting for our food ."
Bernard B.,"Chino Hills, CA",30,20,1,3.0,5/1/2017,"5 stars for service -2 stars for waiting/checkin experience. We entered the front door on a Friday evening right at 6 pm. Upon checkin was informed our party of 6 would be seated in 30-40 minutes. Followed up at 40 minutes and was told we'd be seated in a couple of minutes. Followed up again 10 minutes and 5 minutes later to be told the same thing. Once we hit the 1 hour mark I approached the hostess saying we'd been waiting for an hour (younger kids were complaining for last 10 minutes saying they were hungry. Staff had offered samples to those waiting but that wouldn't be enough to satisfy their hunger). I was told that we would next table to be seated. Had we known the wait was going to exceed an hour we would've evaluated our options. A couple minutes later we were seated only to find that there were SEVERAL open tables that could have seated 6. We were ushered to a table that we would have had to crowd around (small) we asked for one of the open booths. This was accommodated quickly. Since we were waiting so long we had already decided what we were going to order. I requested a server come right away. Thankfully, the gentleman was there right away and completed our order. He was very fast and attentive. Made up for the initial wait. Had no problem with the food although TK once we were done it took a while for the server's backup to bring/process our bill.  We were out the door around 8:30.  I don't mind the wait if wait time is realistic. Hostess made it seem we would be seated in a reasonable amount of time but didn't deliver. Please improve the wait/seating process and I will have no problems with coming back."
Celine C.,"Alhambra, CA",410,292,464,3.0,3/28/2016,"I usually go to Yard House or Wood Ranch, so I haven't been back to BJ's in a while and was pleasantly surprised by my experience. The restaurant is spacious and service was delightful with our drinks and food pushed out of the kitchen in a timely manner. We were also able to use our Yelp coupon ($10 off for order over $35) for the bill.  My boyfriend ordered a medium-sized BJ's Special Deep-Dish Pizza, but we got a large-sized instead and wasn't charged extra. Yay, we made our buck. I ordered the Ahi-Tuna Salad and didn't like it as much. Although the tuna was seared, I am unsure why it tasted so fishy... I had to literally cover it with a coat of wasabi to mask the flavor. Pizookie took a while and was overly sweet... I had one bite and physically felt like my blood glucose rose dramatically lol."
Allan F.,"Chula Vista, San Diego, CA",0,4,,5.0,7/14/2017,The manager Elizabeth is great.  A restaurant that supports the military.  They have a designated parking spot for Purple Heart recipients.  Kudos for that!  Much respect and will be coming back.  This location never disappoints.
Tanvir H.,"Chino Hills, CA",29,22,7,5.0,6/24/2017,"I always prefer coming to BJ's because the quality is much better than other fast food pizza outlets. The overall ambience and the atmosphere is nice. As far as the service, its fast and friendly."
Rudy B.,"Arcadia, CA",103,16,2,1.0,4/9/2017,"Today was a bad day. Our server was sent on break and  we were neglected the remainder of our stay  like step kids in a bad home.  No refills on water, no service whatsoever. Will not come back to this BJ'S in Chino"
Tish M.,"Santa Ana, CA",11,20,14,2.0,9/22/2017,"If I had to judge this BJ's by their TAKE OUT, I would NEVER come back here again. This is said after giving them at least 3 or 4 tries. They seriously let me down every single time. I'll speak on my most recent visit which was 10 mins ago. My pizzas are cold, fries are cold. The only thing somewhat warm are the green beans. Not one napkin, utensil or plate that I asked for. I could tell the guy was nervous who brought my food out (after I had to wait at least 15 mins curbside), he went to hand me my food as I was handing him my card, and apologized & told me it was his first day, I totally understood, so to give himself a free hand to take my card, he put my pizza boxes and bag on the ground& took my card . Then he proceeded to take my food back inside the restaurant to swipe my card........ So I just waited, he brought my stuff out& handed me the receipt to sign, at this point I had been waiting so long, I just wanted to sign& leave. I felt bad not giving him a tip because I know ""Take Out"" ppl still deserve a tip, but after he put my food on the ground& once I got home to my cold food without napkins& other things. I was happy I didn't give him one. They should never send a new guy out on his own or allow him to pack an order by himself. I won't ever order Take Out again. (I'm giving them two stars because I hope someone from management takes notice of this review, I've never had any issues with Dining In this restaurant)"
Leanne D.,"Chino Hills, CA",3,106,4,4.0,4/21/2017,"BJs is our ""go to"" place after a long hard work week. We love the ambience and the service is always good.   We tend to always sit in the bar area especially during football season. Our favorite BJs bar food is their dry rub siracha wings with extra siracha and their siracha honey Brussel sprouts. Their brewhouse burgers are pretty tasty too!  While they used to have a much better happy hour with more discounted options my husband and I still enjoy BJs. Definitely a great Place for TGIF but you have to get there early !!!!"
