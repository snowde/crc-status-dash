Mrs. A.,"Ontario, CA",0,114,25,2.0,4/9/2016,"First time visiting.  Came in on a Friday night at 7pm.  Waited 30 minutes for a table.  Server was great.  Ordered the pepperoni extreme.  Im not sure what their procedure is making the pizzas but the sauce under the cheese was burnt.  As if the dough and sauce were cooked seperately,  and the cheese and toppings are added ata later time.  Anyhow, after 1 slice was done.  All I had was a burnt taste in my mouth.  I could not taste the cheese or pepperoni. Just burn. No noticable sauce, except what was burnt.    The cheese was very skimpy.  The pizza was really disgusting. This was the worst pizza.  Ever."
Drea I.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,5,,1.0,4/9/2017,"Sat at the bar around 11pm.  As soon as I sat the bartender Ashely G asked what I'd like to drink. I asked to give me a second to look over the menu. She walked away with no response. Had to get her attention to order my beer, mind there was only one other couple sitting at the bar next to me. Around 1140 I asked when the kitchen closed she said 1, I ordered calamari which took about 25 minutes to come out. When I ordered it she gave no acknowledgement of my order or even speaking to her. I didn't mind the wait because I also work in the kitchen for a brewery, but she failed to check on my food or communicate with me when it be out. Once my food finally did come out I asked the female runner if I could have some lemons/lines waited about ten minutes for those. What upset me was when the runner got me my lemons I saw her grab them from the side of the bar grab them with her hands and place them on a NAPKIN and served them to me. A small plate would have been more appropriate. I tried to order another beer for my girlfriend took about  15 minutes to due so when I ordered and said what my girl would like Ashley G gave no response. I wasn't even sure she heard me and was getting my drink. Really disappointing when I get excellent service from the rest of the bartenders. Overall lack of work ethic, lack of motivation, but certainly no lack of attitude."
Kathy P.,"Corona, CA",5,8,,5.0,7/1/2017,The best customer service I have ever had! We had the pleasure of having Martin as our server and he was amazing. He went above and beyond to make sure we had the best dining experience. He was so informative on the specials and was patient with any questions I had on the menu items. Thank you so much Martin for the excellent service. I will definitely be back because of him.
Roxanne R.,"West Hills, CA",0,16,,1.0,2/28/2017,"Tried to go here tonight with a party of 7. We called to try to make reservations, but were told they only take same day reservations for 6 or less (seriously?) and that the wait time for a table would be about 30 min. I asked if we could get on the call ahead list since it would take about 20 min to get there and they flat out refused, so I hung up. Then one of is decided to go home so we called back to make a reservation for 6, but they still refused. I mean, cmon guys, it's 8pm on a Tuesday night and you don't want a guaranteed party? Are you kidding me? If you guys really didn't want to take a large party, you really should have just said it wasn't going to happen at all and not wasted our time, because all I heard through that whole exchange, and reinforced with every single ""yeah, we can't do that,"" is that you don't want any of our business ever again."
Elizabeth D.,"Chino, CA",3,7,2,1.0,7/25/2016,"We recently went for a buffet family baptism celebration and paid about $15 per person to receive unlimited pizza and salad. I called on five occasions, the first two just trying to set up a contract. The other two trying to finalize the contract (they kept telling me to call back but the fourth time I just told them I wasn't going to call back again). The day of the event, they called to make sure I was going in and I said yes to our reservation at 12:30.  Well we arrived at 12:30 and were not served until 1:30 (everyone asked where was the food?) when it came out, some pizzas weren't fully cooked and some people didn't get drinks until much later. The waiters miscounted how many people and were going to charge us an extra person and charge for my four month old who doesn't even eat pizza or salad even though I told them on each of the five calls that we'd have this many people and an infant.  We brought a cake and the waitress wanted me to cut it and kept saying that she didn't know if I loved cutting the cake...seriously this was the worst service ever and was really disappointed. We had gone to the same exact place for another event two years prior, but that time they actually had the food ready at the time of our reservation. I mean what's the point of a reservation with a planned meal if it's not ready on time? DO NOT come here for big parties."
Jackson B.,"Chino, CA",11,2,,5.0,6/28/2017,The lady was so kind and cheerful to have her costumes she even gave me eye contact great service
Kaila S.,"Azusa, CA",0,6,1,2.0,3/1/2017,"Came here with my boyfriend today and wasn't too happy with the service.  Our waiter came & took our order quick but 30 minutes went by and he didn't acknowledge us or even say ""your food will be out shortly.""  My salad came after about 45 minutes. My boyfriend ordered the flatbread nachos appetizer & that came about 10 minutes after my salad came.  For our check we wanted to pay half cash & half card. He came back after a couple minutes asking if we wanted to do cash first then the rest on the card & we said yes. A couple more minutes came by and he came back and said ""oh I didn't see the $20 so it was all charged on the card. My manager will take care of that.""  How did you not see the $20 when it was right in front of the receipt? Did you not even open it and just pull the card out?  We won't be coming back to this location."
Amanda G.,"Alhambra, Los Angeles, CA",21,48,27,5.0,7/23/2016,The service is always top notch! The alcohol drinks are amazing! I love the wings! I love the poozokies! It it's seriously like our go to spot for some snack wings & a cocktail or dessert & a cocktail!
Eric N.,"Ontario, CA",0,3,,5.0,5/26/2017,Martin was the  He was super helpful and energetic. His charisma made me and my buddies feel at home and comfortable with ordering although it was our first time. Definitely coming back here!! He also has really cool glasses!!!
Matt T.,"Diamond Bar, CA",100,8,,5.0,1/28/2017,"David. Just ask for David. Especially if you have a big party, he is worth the wait. He'll make your experience at BJ's extremely fun."
Anita W.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",463,140,94,1.0,6/27/2016,"My friends and I came here for dinner about a month ago and had a really bad experience.  Let me start by saying that I have been a little dissatisfied with BJ's recently.  They took my favorite salad off the menu, they changed some other items on the menu and their service standards seem to be slipping.  Hence the reason why I had not been to BJ's in a while until the fateful night in May.   My two best friends from high school and I had a little impromptu get together one night.  We decided to run out to get something to eat.  We got to BJ's at about 8pm and were told that we would have to wait for a table.  No problem...but hurry it up, we are starving and by the looks of us we haven't missed many meals and I'm not about to start now.  We got to our table and the server came to take our drink orders.  We had our orders ready for him because we were starving (did I already say I haven't missed many meals in this life?).   The drinks were delivered and we settled in to wait for our meals...and wait....and wait...and wait.  At about the 30 minute mark we asked our server to please check on our meals.  He goes into the back and the manager, Karen, comes to our table a little while later to tell us that our pizza was dropped on the floor.  We explain that we are hangry and she says she will bring out an appetizer to our table.  She gave us a few ""quick"" options and we chose a spinach artichoke dip.  She told us that it would be right out.  Okay!  Bring it on!  Fifteen minutes later and the dip is delivered to the table.  We all take big dollops and put them on our plates.  We dip a chip and take a bite.  NO!  The dip is stone cold.  Literally had been dumped in the bowl from the refrigerator and brought out to us.  No attempt to heat it at all.  We ask our server to please get Karen, and she comes to the table and apologizes.  Then she asks us if she can bring us more.  Um, no thanks.  We then asked her where our pizza was because she last came to our table over 20 minutes ago to tell us that our pizza had been dropped on the floor.  Off she goes to check on the pizza. Another 10 minutes go by and our server brings our pizza out.  We all take a slice and note to each other that, while the pizza is hot...it is not steaming hot.  It has obviously been sitting in the pass for at least five minutes.  We fell on that pizza and ate like we had just been held prisoner somewhere and only given water and bread for a week.  Karen checks in on us and we tell her that we don't think we should have to pay for the pizza.  She tells us that she will ""do something for us.""  At this point we are beyond angry and we mention to our server that they need to take the pizza off the bill.  He is unimpressed with us and tells us he can't do anything about it.   My friend then gets up from the table and goes over to speak with Karen.  She tells her that we have been at BJ's for over an hour and a half, and this meal was mediocre at best.  She explains that she was a server for a long time and her dad was in the restaurant business her whole life.  Karen finally capitulates and comps our pizza.  We paid for the drinks we had and left the server a nice tip (even though he had a bit of an attitude).  Bottom line, this further solidifies to me that a restaurant I used to frequent will no longer get my business.  I don't know what has been going on with the menu and service except that BJ's has probably grown too fast for corporate to keep up their standards.   I won't be back."
Rajiv K.,"Rowland Heights, CA",67,22,1,5.0,1/26/2017,"OK..This is not something I would normally do, but I've been coming here for the past 3 years and decided today that my review needs an update. Kacey is the best bartender with her sassy personality and in the sense that I can come back and feel like this is my ""Cheers."" There is no other bar that I feel more welcome at that than here. Food is fine, drinks are great, but it's the comraderie that makes this a place I will always go to. Can't say enough good things about this place, just come here, ask when I'm here, and I'll buy you a beer."
Lauren M.,"Chino Hills, CA",37,101,4,5.0,1/26/2017,"Nico and David are the best servers!!! We come in frequently and I feel like the service is just as good as 5 star restaurant service. Always quick, attentive and friendly."
Wonder Boy B.,"Buena Park, CA",4,91,5,4.0,8/14/2017,They've got a pretty good new happy hour here. Example is there Brew house burger and fries $6
Susie Y.,"Walnut, CA",10,5,,1.0,12/18/2016,"I just had my to go dinner and I was so disappointed that I have to write this review to vent out my frustrations. What is going on here?  I usually order from Eastland mall in West Covina and I don't recall having any bad experiences.  This time, my son offered to pick up the food on his way home and this location was close by so I went ahead and ordered the veggie pizza and a meat ball spaghetti without any hesitations. When the food arrived, both were inedible!!  It only took 15 minutes to bring the food from the restaurant but pizza was cold and the dough was tough, chewy, it was like a stale bread at it's best.   The spaghetti was dry with barely any sauce, the meatballs were dry and the garlic bread was rock hard.  Although I was famished, I could'nt eat more than few bites.  How can they taste so different from the other BJ locations?    I really hate paying for terrible food and this one tops it all.  Congratulations to BJ @ Chino Hills!  You have the honor of receiving my very first one star bad review.  Actually, the one star was by a default.  I'd give 0."
Car T.,"Diamond Bar, CA",0,8,1,2.0,6/21/2017,"Just not good, Over cooked chicken, undercoooked vegetables, dirty.  The positives nice people, cold beer, an pszookies.  No rice with entree, ask for no wasabi, got it anyway.  Sent a dish back and little improvement on the returned meal.  They have a good menu, unable to execute.  Bummer."
Tammy P.,"Fullerton, CA",2,2,,4.0,3/11/2017,Went on a Saturday about 7 so of course a long wait. Once seated we had great service from David M. He entertained us with his trivia ( that we won by the way) and  brought all our food just the way we wanted it. Great night!
Lindsay F.,"Rialto, CA",67,7,2,1.0,8/23/2017,"Wanted something different for lunch. Was referred my a colleague of mine to this restaurant. The trouble started in the beginning just trying to order online. I wanted to get the order by 12 the website wouldn't let me order it said I needed to give them at least 45 min ahead of time, mind you it was 11:11 which is 49 min before. Plus they say they charge 1.99 for delivery but they also charge $1+ service fee which is stupid. Just say $4.00 for delivery. So I had to go pick it up. I placed my order and received an email telling me to park in a designated parking for curb side delivery and call the number on the sign so I attempted to do just that. When I got there, there where 3 parking for curb side which were all take with no one in the vehicles. I parked next to those parking spots and tried to call the number, the number said all circuits where busy so i called again, same thing. I got out of my car and walked inside thinking there was something wrong with the phones and that was why the people in the curbside delivery spots where not in their cars; no one was in line at the pick up register or on the phone. I picked up my order and they didn't even give me utensils or napkins for my soup and salad. Safe to say I will not be coming here again or referring anybody."
Mrs. S.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",0,19,1,5.0,10/4/2016,"We went to this restaurant several times during our stay at Ayres hotel in Chino Hills. Every visit we were lucky enough to have David as our server. He is polite, hard-working, and made sure our orders were delivered swiftly to the table. He never failed to recognize our events...a wedding one day, a birthday the next...he brought a special treat and went out of his way to accomodate our entire party... every visit! :) You can't go wrong with great food and great service like the kind you receive from David at this Bj's location in Chino Hills. I would go out of my way to return here because it is worth it."
Joseph G.,"Los Angeles, CA",90,5,,3.0,12/2/2016,"Exactly three stars.  Pizza so dry we requested extra alfredo sauce.  Beer was on point though.  Shoot, forgot to mention that the atmosphere was dry as well."
