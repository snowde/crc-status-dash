Nicole F.,"San Diego, CA",336,851,1978,4.0,11/11/2017,"This is my 1st time dining at a BJ's. Spouse dined several times at the one in Culver City. He didn't like the salads but said the burgers are pretty good. Since they were offering Veterans a free meal up to $13 from their entire menu I just decided to go with the jalapeno bacon guacamole burger. This beef patty is prepared your way and even though we both ordered ours medium rare, only mine came that way while his was more medium well. Still, at a burger-bar-kind-of-place like this I never expect to get it how I ask. I was pleased that mine was medium rare. This was a healthy sized burger on a great tasting bun and they did not skimp on guacamole. It also had a ton of jalapenos and two strips of bacon. Definitely a decent burger for the price and their fries were piping hot and seasoned perfectly.  I'm not sure why the reviews on service are bad. We only had a five minute wait on a day where they were giving out free food. Our server was friendly and our food came out expeditiously and hot. I think it's a solid chain and I bumped them to that 4th star for opening up the entire menu on Veteran's day and giving great service and quality food. I would go back if in the area and craving a burger or maybe to try something else from the extensive menu."
Danielle G.,"San Diego, CA",333,11,5,1.0,12/15/2017,Never order delivery from here.  I got a pizookie trio. The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie was very hard and burnt.  I ordered the chicken club flatbread. I got the sandwich with fries. The bread was soggy and the fries were old and cold.  I've been here several times before and it's always been decent. But this was by far the worst experience I've had.
Henry J.,"San Diego, CA",189,38,93,5.0,10/31/2017,"Came to burn a gift card. I was really surprised with the friendly server (Ruben) and his shadow (Jafer) showed us. Superior service, from offering dessert first, to bringing the appetizers out hot and fast, ahead of our entrees. Appetizers were hot and tasty (we ordered meatballs, and the spinach and artichoke dip with chips). Chips were freshly made with just the right amount of salt for flavor. Meatballs came hot, on a bed of mashed potatoes, and lightly drizzled with gravy. I ordered the Seared Ahi Salad and, wow, it was on point! The light use of dressing, the crisp assorted lettuce and greens, nicely diced avocados, definitely enhanced and brought out the flavor of the seared Ahi. The Seared Ahi salad was proportioned nicely, not too big or too small. There was a generous amount of seared Ahi to balance the salad. Since we were celebrating her birthday, she took advantage of the dessert prior to her meal (and appetizers). Jafer comped her the dessert. I had also just signed up under their BJ app and received a free pizookie. And, although full, I did enjoy the very hot chocolate chip cookie with a nice serving of Vanilla ice cream after my meal. Lately most restaurants are slow to refill my water glass, fortunately for me,  they must have been observing me and kept my water glass full. Kudos to them. That's a huge plus. I commend both Jafer and Ruben for their outstanding service and to the restaurant staff for the hot, fresh, and timely food preparation.  Thanks BJs for a wonderful dining experience."
Andrea V.,"San Diego, CA",234,107,1657,2.0,10/8/2017,"I have eaten here a few times and I like the food, however it seems this location is going downhill. From the service, the food, and overall dining experience, I have not been impressed. I keep returning in hope that things improve, because I love their pizookies, beer, and deep dish pizzas. But yet again, I've been let down, and left disappointed.  Even when there isn't a long wait time, and the restaurant is slow, the food takes forever. I'm talking 45 minutes to an hour, on a busy and slow day. Maybe it's been my luck here, but I have come for lunch, dinner, on weekends and weekdays, and kinda figured out good times to avoid crowds. Yet, the last 3 times have been awful experiences. From the long wait, poor table service, cold food. However If you get lucky the pizzas are good, their avocado egg rolls are awesome, and their pizookies are delicious. They do have a wide variety of menu items with appetizers, pizzas, pastas, chicken, steaks, salads, sandwiches, burgers, soup, beer/wine, desserts, and pretty much everything for everyone. Other than the poor customer service, lacking kitchen staff and long wait times, the food is pretty good. If it's not cold."
Jasmine C.,"San Diego, CA",481,190,734,2.0,9/15/2017,"Decided to come here at 10:30pm because most places were closed. Closes at 12am on the weekdays btw!  I got the Cajun jambalaya, but instead of rice I substituted with fettuccine pasta. The plate was flavorful with all the spices. It wasn't too bad.   My friend ordered the shrimp asparagus penne. I thought it was bland. I definitely could of made this marinara pasta at home.  The calamari was also okay. It wasn't crispy.  The strawberry mojito was good. I really liked the fresh strawberry bites and mint.  The server last night was really helpful. We didn't know exactly what to order so he was able to help us. I thought the service was better than the food. Would I come here again? Probably not."
B B.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,5,,5.0,1/8/2018,"y wife and I came in on our lunch break and was very impressed with the speedy service. We let our Server Corey know that we were kind of in a hurry and he totally accommodated our requests. He had our order in and cashed us out within half an hour which was what we wanted. If anything, you just made a repeat customer. We will definitely be back just to sit in his section. Outstanding service. Your soup and salad combo is well worth the price. My wife loved the Lentil. Great service and great atmosphere"
Sherry F.,"San Diego, CA",225,146,123,4.0,7/14/2017,"They were having a buy one get one free entree special, so how could we turn that offer down? Had the appetizer sampler which included mozzarella sticks, buffalo boneless wings (or another choice of sauce), avocado egg rolls, and spinach artichoke dip--good value for the quantity. Ordered a half/half medium pizza (don't remember the names but one was the Hawaiian and the other was the CA Supreme). Plenty of toppings, but lacked sauce. The crust was nice and fluffy. Also ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken. Came out super fresh, crispy, flavorful; delicious dish overall. And lastly had the churro pizookie--tasted freshly made and good amount of crunch, chewy, and sweetness.  Wanted to give a shoutout to our server, George, who was super friendly, attentive, and obviously a hard worker. Thumbs up for his service!"
Jamie V.,"San Diego, CA",0,8,2,5.0,1/2/2018,I love BJ's! The food is always amazing!  .  I am a reward member and ever time I go i have amazing svc. I would recommend this place to anyone.
Rigo S.,"Holtville, CA",2,52,54,5.0,9/14/2017,Decided to come here after shopping at the Las Americas Outlets. Best decision I've ever made! Pizza was super good and dessert was even better! Looks like they've added more pizookies to their menu. Ordered the Monkey Bread Pizookie and Churro Pizookie. Both were extremely good.  Shoutout to Jyssica for tending to our needs and for giving us the tip of getting our ice cream separate from the churro she to prevent them from getting soggy.
Andy M.,"Chula Vista, CA",411,211,739,4.0,7/5/2017,"I'm a fan of BJ's, (I like saying that) who wouldn't be. Tortilla Soup, Avocado Egg Rolls & the Pizookie desert are the main reasons I come here! All 3 on point! Of course there is other good things in here to eat but those 3 are my favorite. My wife is a big fan of this place she comes here a lot with her amigas to eat & drink & I'm ok with that because a drunk or buzzing wife is a fun wife when she gets home. So thank you BJ's for keeping my wife fun, she goes to BJ's drinks gets home & I get a..... there's a dirty joke there but I'll leave it alone & keep this review PG-13. :)~ First to start with I love the inside & customer service. Very spacious & a lot of TV's so if your a sport guy like me you'll love it! Right when you come in you get greeted & seated as soon as possible, every time we have came we have gotten good customer service & good quality of food at a good amount of time. Never had a issue with customer service. Bartenders are fast & accurate. Like I said my wife is a big fan & it took me awhile but now I'm a fan as well. It took awhile for me to find enough items to want to come & eat. At first I got fish tacos they were ok, wings were also ok, I wouldn't recommend the chips & salsa & I had a couple pasta items that were also ok. At first I couldn't find items I really loved, but now I have. Avocado Egg Rolls, they are ORGASMIC! I blush when I eat them! You have to start with that as a appetizer & a tortilla soup you'll love them both! My kids, wife & me enjoy their big baked potato with grill chicken in it, it's amazing! Ribs are on point! And if you come here you have to get a pizza, my fav Chicken Bacon Ranch! Make sure to get fries their pretty good here. And don't leave until you eat desert I don't care how full you are, get the pizookie you'll thank me later!  Over all I have really grown to like this place & look forward to coming here with the family. I hear the steak is very good & they got great happy hour prices & good specials on their burgers on certain days, gonna have to try it. So thank you BJ's for the good food & customer service & sending my wife home buzzing & happy this husband appreciates it & salute you! Keep up the good work & I'll see you soon! I am a fan of BJ's!"
Ali B.,"Valencia Park, San Diego, CA",1746,526,4594,4.0,6/22/2017,"For Father's Day we started the celebration with a late lunch at BJ's.  When we first arrived there was a 35 minute wait for a table so we decided to eat in the bar area because they had open tables.  The waitress was friendly, she took our drink orders and shortly after they arrived she took our food orders.  My husband, stepson and stepdaughter ordered pizzas.  I ordered the rib eye steak.   The pizzas were good the steak was a little dry and chewy so most of it was thrown in the trash.  We also ordered the artichoke dip with chips and fried calamari they were both delicious.  Overall, service was quick, and for the most part the food was good.  For Father's Day my husband received a free beer glass and a 20% off card towards a future meal."
J K.,"National City, CA",70,5,2,1.0,11/10/2017,"not worth the money, i know someone who can cook the sirloin better than over here. I told them i wanted it well done (the last bjs i went to is in florida and their sirloin is wayyyyyy better, it is well done with a little bit juice its perfect just the way i wanted it but here its not) the one i got is burnt its not well done and its very dry, wont be coming back on this bjs."
Mikey B.,"El Cajon, CA",1,7,,1.0,12/20/2017,I'm a chef at a restaurant and I know its not my department to say something about this place but the service sucks ass big time compare to other dine in restaurants this place is the worst service we had reserve a birthday dinner for my nephew we were sat on time but it took like 30mins for us to get a server this place sucks
Jesenia R.,"Spring Valley, San Diego, CA",130,55,898,2.0,5/13/2017,"I've been to Bjs a handful of times and they just keep disappointing. The avocado egg rolls used to be yummy and basically the only thing I would enjoy from there, but now they aren't even tasty. Happy hour isn't even happy hour. They have $1 off drinks and $2 off appetizers that's it, noting special. I have absolutely no complaints about the staff. They are all very friendly, helpful and patient. However the food is blah. Not worth coming back."
Monica C.,"Chula Vista, CA",6,111,130,5.0,6/16/2017,Came here to celebrate my mother's birthday 61 year's old Happy birthday MOM!! I'm so blessed to have you in my life! Thank you for all you have done for me! This place has great customer service! Food was hot and fresh.
Rock J.,"Chula Vista, CA",74,4,24,5.0,12/10/2017,"I don't usually write reviews, I just enjoy the food. But when the food is delicious and your server is on point, one can't help but to give praise. Our server, Ernesto, was both polite and humble. When you have someone coming to check up on you and making sure everything is to your satisfaction, you think that's just their job, but Ernesto anticipated our needs. We placed our dessert order at the same time we ordered dinner. When you do that, dessert tends to come out at the same time as your food. With that in mind, Ernesto advised us that he won't place the dessert order just yet. Cool beans!! Mid way through our meal, Ernesto comes back to tell us that he'll place our dessert order and that by the time we've finished eating, dessert should be on its way out. No sooner than I swallowed my last bite of steak, Ernesto is bringing out dessert. I know this might not seem like much to praise about, but for me, this type of service is golden. Thank you so much Ernesto!!! You are the reason I will be coming back to BJ's"
Don B.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,133,44,2.0,11/22/2017,"The kitchen takes so long to prepare your meal that you begin to wonder if the food is coming soon or do you need to return another time for it. The food comes to the table hot, but not always flavorful. Servers seem well intentioned, but end up being fairly ineffective. Stuffed baked potatoes come actually lacking in toppings. The chicken fried steak burger was so lacking in taste that the bright spot on the plate was the mashed potatoes we subbed for French fries. What is really interesting is that THIS particular BJ's does not meet the standards for food or service you normally experience at other local BJ's. Go to a different BJ's for a better meal."
Avonlea D.,"San Diego, CA",230,11,1,5.0,11/2/2017,"Our server Joshua was the sh*t! Keep doing what you! Give him a promotion, making him a bartender! Give him the company! He needs to be in charge of something! He's spectacular!"
Krystal L.,"San Diego, CA",4,21,5,1.0,12/3/2017,We called ahead and reserved a table from 6pm. We got seated and after 20 minutes of not receiving any service I said something to a server walking by. Turns out they sat us at a table with no server. Let me add they were not even that busy. A server who was already super busy with her tables took on our as well so I was not expecting great service. The kitchen did not bring out the appetizer we ordered so I asked that it be removed from the tab. I ordered a steak medium well and it was burned. I ate it anyway because I was starving. Only to go home and get diarrhea from the food. Will never be back here again. Save your money and go some where else for good service and food.
miguel l.,"Chula Vista, CA",1,15,4,1.0,11/21/2017,"The food is actually decent. But I've been here 3 times in the last few weeks and the servers and workers are horrible. They take forever, forget your food, don't clean up the table, Don't take dirty plates away from the table and overall it's not a welcoming environment. Today we had the waiter Mario and he apparently got insulted cause I had to remind him that he forgot to give me a refill twice early on the dinner, so a new waitress came over and told us she'd be taking over and he continued to wait the tables around us except us....... The new waitress was a bit better but still super slow and would forget..."
Daniel L.,"National City, CA",21,59,377,3.0,5/5/2017,Pretty good spot for a beer and a quick bite the food is good but the service sucks the waitress was rude and never seen if we were ok. But overall good place just depends on what waitress you get I guess. It took 20 minutes to get I'll drinks after our food arrived
James B.,"San Diego, CA",10,43,9,3.0,9/6/2017,"I usually order food to go so this review is based on this. If I call in and the person on the to-go line takes my order it is usually 99.9% correct. Happy days! If you go to the bar and then decide to order food to go, you should call the TO GO person over to take your order. A few times I have sat at the bar and ordered through the bartenders. Sorry guys/girls - not good for you.   1st time the bartender was busy and wrote my order down. Then she never put it in the computer because she got distracted by someone in the service well (yes, I was in the industry  so I give leniency where it is due but come on! ). :( 2nd time the bartender wasn't busy. I gave the bartender my order and I asked, ""Aren't you going to write this down?"". He tapped his finger to the side of his head and smiled, as if he was going to remember my order. Well, I sat there, had a few beers while I waited for my food and made some new friends. The order came, I didn't check it (stupid me as it is all the way across town to get here). I got home and they put chicken in the derby salad, I told him my wife was allergic to chicken and he forgot to order my button mushrooms.  Lesson learned. If you are going to order food to go, do yourself a favor and order from the person at the TO GO station.  On a side note, I have eaten in the restaurant and AT the bar and my order has always been perfect so take this for what it is. A little tip for the tipsy.  I encounter this at a lot of places that I get food to go so it is ultimately up to me to get it right but it would be nice not to have to bother. Happy Wednesday."
Elizabeth T.,"Chula Vista, CA",368,5,4,2.0,12/27/2017,"Wasn't too impressed. It's was a busy night, but didn't look too crazy. When we got there we were told it would be a 20 minute wait, ended up being 40 minutes. We were finally sat and our server Mario was rather nice. We ordered our drinks and food. Our drinks came in plastic to go cups with lids and when our food finally came out, it didn't come out together. One persons soup and salad came out first and it was about another 10-15 minutes before the rest of the parties food came out. It was about another 5 minutes before the pizza came out. A different server brought out of pizza, and when it came we asked for cheese, plates to share the pizza, and refills on our drinks, he mumbled something and never came back. Mario returned and we placed our refill order with him. This time half the refills came out in plastic cups while the other half came out in regular glasses. When we finally finished our meal we waited a good while before our check appeared. While our server was very friendly and the food was decent. The wait times were outrageous."
Manuel S.,"San Diego, CA",7,19,19,5.0,10/12/2017,"This place has amazing food, I love being able to seat in the booth with the family and able to watch the tv playing live sports. I ordered the pizza with the wings are more then what you pay for. Great value on the food and they have their own custom beer listing. You can pick from a variety of food as well as for drinks. If you want to be able to pick form a large menu come to Bj."
Edd C.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,11,5,1.0,12/26/2017,Horrible service . Felt very Unwelcome . Slow service . Started with hostess ignoring us
Elizabeth R.,"Chula Vista, CA",6,9,2,5.0,10/12/2017,"I went to BJs to celebrate my birthday last night with my family party of 30...yes 30! Our server Joshua M. did an amazing job waiting and serving us. He was prompt and readily available to provide us service from filling up on our drinks to bringing us things we needed! He was very patience and professional. BJs has some of the best burger, I highly recommend giving them a try!"
Riley S.,"Chula Vista, San Diego, CA",133,343,1438,5.0,7/1/2016,"Always been having my husband comment on lets go to bjs lets go to bjs. Yesterday we decided to finally go. Why did i wait to long!!!??? As we walk in the door we wait for a few minutes and we are greeted by a manager. He was very friendly and his customer service skills were great. He sat us in a big booth which was nice bcuz we all had our personal arm space cuz my son and husband take up all the arm space when it comes to eating.  As we sit we have our server ernest help us out. Omg he was perfect!!! Nice patient and very knowledgeable about the menu. The menu is huge! There are two menus, the regular food menu & drinks. We started with raspberry iced tea for baby girl ( which was a bit strong for her ). Angelito... Apple juice and baes got 2 of theyre in house crafted beers i don't know the names lol i had a white peach margarita& later a strawberry splash margarita. Both were great.!! We had the fried asparagus to start as an appetizers while we drank and the kids shared an off menu spaghetti plate. Which was perfect for them due to my son eats alot & my daughter eats very little lol. Them asparagus tho...wow!! Had a great flavor to them and came with a dipping sauce that i found licking off my fingers when the asparagus were all finished lol. Baes ordered a chili bowl... Was delicious and warm. And a plate with half rack ribs and steak... The ribs were  ! Flavoring was amazing and they came right off the bone! That's what i call perfect cooked ribs fo sho! I had ordered the cheddar broccoli soup inside of a sourdough bread bowl...fffuucckk!! This soup was awesome very thick cheddar taste and the bread wasn't too soft or too hard. It was on the crispy side which was perfect to dip with my soup. I also had the baked zitti i believe. It was great had tons of cheese, sasuage and pepperoni throughout the whole pasta.  I will MOST DEF come back here. EVERYTHING was on point. Enrest was great, drinks were flavorful and the food... Tasted unique. Shoutout to Ernest for making my first time experience at Bj's an exciting one!!"
Mona L.,"Oakland, CA",640,60,2924,5.0,1/1/2017,"I guess you can't go wrong with any BJ'S because they all have the best service,  friendliest waitress and the set up is exactly the same as Northern California.  Loads of Tv's showing all the games so you can keep track of them all. Portion size of food is very satisfied. Not to mention the dessert will have you taking a nap at the table you be so full. Now the real reason for my review is most places I go to get a drink I have to buy like 3 to even get a buzz because it's so watered down.  I'm a lite way drinker and when one is all I need I know they put alcohol in it.  BJ'S make sure they hook you up"
Royal R.,"San Diego, CA",6,26,113,3.0,9/1/2017,"Manny (5 star service!) catered to our large group w/separate cks & was professional, quick, friendly, & had a wonderful attitude. Prices high for food that neighboring restaurants had better prices for. You pay for the sit-down restaurant atmosphere. Tuesday night had $3 mini churros & ice cream special. So good, we forgot to take pic, cuz so busy devouring. This dessert was 5 star for that price & amount, that could be shared between 2 ppl. The higher stars for Manny & churro special!"
Lizbeth F.,"Chula Vista, CA",62,175,240,2.0,1/30/2017,This place is cool but not the best!!!! I have been here a couple of times maybe like 4 times and from those 4 only one time I got good customer service! The other 3 times were a disaster!!!!  Starting with the hostesses!!! Omg I seriously don't understand how they got hired. Talking just to each other and ignoring customers! I literally seated myself.  The pasta is not even good!!! Chicken was blah!!!!!  What I did like was the mozzarella sticks & the pisscookies!!! Those are bomb!!!!!  Everything else is a disaster!!! They need to train their employees better! How can a server don't know their own menu like wth!!!! Really!!!!  Anyways I might give it another chance since I haven't been there for a while.  Hopefully this time customer service is way better!
Chris N.,"San Diego, CA",179,9,9,3.0,7/20/2017,"I don't think the garlic knots was worth $5. You get two pieces, but one of them was burnt.  Our order didn't come out as desired, and they forgot to bring our appetizer out.  The steak was good, though."
Carlos F.,"Chula Vista, CA",1,15,21,5.0,3/31/2017,"So we had a 20 min. wait (which was really like 10 minutes). We were seated in a nice area and Martrice was our server. Her service was nothing short of spectacular!!! She was handling a lot of different tables, yet never lost touch with us. Even before she officially served us, she advised us that she had 1 table ahead of us and then she would gladly get our orders started. Her product knowledge was second to none! She recommended some very good food and drinks. The wife and I shared the stuffed mushrooms (excellent choice). I had the full rack of ribs with the root beer glaze (Martrice's recommendation) and it did not disappoint!!! Such good flavor and those ribs were perfectly cooked. The wife had fish h chips which were equally delicious. I had a whiskey sour and the wife had an alabama sunset. Great drinks!!! We topped the meal off with a beignet. All in all a great experience. We will definitely be back, especially when Martrice is working."
James H.,"Chula Vista, CA",853,185,304,5.0,5/13/2016,"The last time I had visited a BJ's Brewery was their location near UCSD.  I have to say that I do not have much recollection of my experience from that time since it was many years back.  My dining experience in May 2016 at the Chula Vista Center location left me fairly pleased.  I came in at happy hour time and only wanted a quick beer and burger before I headed home.  I was recognized not long after I sat down and placed my order. My burger and fries came out in a reasonable amount of time.  The first thing I noticed was the delicious bun, which may have been due to butter.  You are given the option of steak fries or thin and since I am thin I chose thin.  They were fine.  I would have preferred to have sweet potato but oh well.   Marlon (the bartender) checked on me enough to not be annoying and I was able to pay out in prompt manner.   Aesthetically speaking the establishment is very attractive and clean.  I will definitely return."
Angelica H.,"El Cajon, CA",337,23,10,1.0,6/19/2017,I placed an order over the phone The manager placed my order and said it's going to be 10-15 minutes I walked in in 15 minutes my order was not placed on top of that there was no order under my name so they had to make an order I waited 15 minutes my order comes The bread feels like a week old the soup looks like a week or old it's a broccoli soup it's supposed to look like yellow wish and green it looks brown and black.... I walked inside and I told him I situation the manager talk to me and he said I'm going to fix it my second order that I had to wait another 15 minutes for is also wrong and this time it taste like it's not cooked enough  On top of all of that the manager did not even say I'm sorry what so ever ... so disappointment
Elize A.,"San Diego, CA",446,128,222,3.0,5/20/2016,"It was slow service, however it wasn't that busy around 10 pm during happy hour.  Happy hour: 10pm-close $2 off shareable appetizers, $1 off beers, cocktails, wine, etc. 1/2 mini deep dish pizzas We probably waited about 40 minutes for our food and I ordered the chicken bacon club mini deep dish pizza that was TINY. Good thing it was half off of $11 because I would never pay the full price for it. The thing with deep dish pizzas is that they have so much excess dough, that that's all I tasted while eating my mini pizza. It also had more tomatoes than anything... My boyfriend ordered the chicken bacon club sandwich (don't remember the exact name) he said it was simply ok. It was like a chicken bacon club wrapped in a tortilla. It lacked flavor, and he had to a lot more ranch and hot sauce to intensify it. But he was still hungry after he ate so we had to order some pizookies. (Cookies n cream is our favorite out of all!!!!!) the pizookie was the only menu item that was worth it, in my opinion.  I ordered the ""Alabama Sunset"" wasn't strong, but since we waited a long while for our food on an empty stomach, I felt it way more than I should've."
L B.,"Imperial Beach, CA",0,24,27,1.0,3/3/2017,"UPDATE: Oct. 2017 - My original review below is no longer true. Please just do yourself a favor & DON'T go here! If you're going to BJ's, It's worth the extra 20 minutes to drive to the La Mesa location.  Good food & beer. The reward program is solid. Always a great place to grab lunch or dinner (& beer of course). Service at the bar is always great, however, you take your chances with the service if you sit elsewhere."
Vida W.,"San Diego, CA",0,11,1,5.0,10/25/2017,"My husband Mark, my son Kevin, my daughter in love Tiffanee and I love to come here for All You Can Eat Soup and Salad.   Not to forget the rest of our family. They love coming here too.  Great salads,  awesome soups.  I can't even go to soup plantation any more cause BJ's soups are so much better.  Tomato Bisque, chicken tortilla, clam chowder,  broccoli and cheese and chili.   Yummy salads, The house, mozzarella and tomato, wedge and specialty salads.  So many great servers.  Cory,  Josh,  Carrie,  Michael,  JR, Jose, Andre, and the managers Josh and Jen. Plus other awesome servers.  Sorry Vida Moment.  We get treated so special when we come here.  Other great dishes are ribs so yummy,  chicken with a buttery sauce,  fish tacos with a super sauce,  meatballs with mash potatoes, juicy hamburgers, oh so yummy spicy wings. and the list goes on.  They also make their own sodas. Black cherry,  root beer,  orange - each great with ice cream. Then the dessert,  the Pazookies, the one that looks like a cinnamon rolls with ice cream.  Mark & my favorite.  They have a great happy hour food list. Have to sit in the bar area for that. But it's worth it.  They do have some really good beers.  If your interested, a Beer Dinner about every 2 months. You get to taste the food that's on their menu.  4 course meal plus drinks.

Nina E.,"Temecula, CA",2,60,93,5.0,12/9/2016,Okay my experience at BJ's today on my son's birthday was a very pleasant one A friend of mine and I decided to have lunch here and have a cocktail our server's name was Matthew. I would advise that any time you come to the Chula Vista BJ's Restaurant that you asked for Matthew he's very courteous friendly and personable. I think Matthew will go very far in BJ's knows maybe one day he'll be a manager here. The food was also very good he suggested that we get the Southern Fried Chicken which was very good he also served our drinks and in a courteous manner and he waited on us hand and foot. I have provided a picture of Matthew however I did forget to take a picture of my food but it was very delicious highly recommended

Shannon P.,"Glenrock, WY",81,133,451,4.0,6/6/2017,Bjs has a great variety in their menu  Our waitress was friendly and  helpful suggesting menu items our food was served hot and was great my only complaint would be the potato skins  looks like they were rushed to be made as only 3 of them had bacon and cheese on them while the others had 0   Cheese and bacon they were just fried potatoes they should of never left the kitchen and that has happened both times we have ordered the potatoes skins
