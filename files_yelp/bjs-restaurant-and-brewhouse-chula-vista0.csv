Laura L.,"San Diego, CA",110,56,51,2.0,1/12/2016,"Not sure what's going on with the food at this place. I remember their food was good. The pizza and beer still are but I have ordered other menu items 3 times and they tasted like cafeteria food. Today I had the pulled pork sandwich, last time it was a burger. The only thing I enjoyed was the avocado spring rolls. It's too bad because they have an extensive menu but the food quality and flavor has went downhill."
Alexis P.,"Chula Vista, San Diego, CA",24,14,,2.0,1/22/2015,"I'm not sure what happen tonight but service we received was  poor. I took my boyfriend out for dinner for his birthday & this was possibly the worst service we have had . I feel like I need to take him out to dinner again to make up for tonight. Defiantly not the way I wanted him to enjoy his birthday.  Our appetizer came out  quickly but after that it was a complete train wreck. We waited 45 mins to receive our food. We discussed walking out & going to project pie to eat.  it was getting out of control at this point.  Our waiter said he was going to ""check on our food"" but yet I see him to go other tables & refill their drinks , take orders & he never ""checked on our food"" 10 mins later he came by & said our food is ""done"" & will be out right now at this point I was getting annoyed. 6 mins later our food finally comes out. We asked for a side or ranch & that literally took 10 more mins!  A party of 6 sat down next to us & within 20 mins they had their food. I don't understand how it takes 45 mins to make food for 2 but the party of 6 gets their food in half the amount of time!  Sincerely - annoyed guest."
Linda H.,"Chula Vista, CA",3,69,40,2.0,8/1/2015,We first walked in and a male waiter slammed the glass door on his way out. Had to wait 11 minutes for someone to take our drink order.  Another waiter came by and said that he would be helping us. We just got introduced to another waiter that he would take over our table. Wow!  Third waiter in 10 minutes.   JB was awesome!
Joshua B.,"San Diego, CA",35,5,,1.0,2/15/2015,"Before I get started let me make this clear. We've eaten at BJs several times for lunch & dinner with no problems.  We wanted to try brunch at bjs for the first time since we enjoy their other items. So we headed there around 11:30 on a Sunday. We got greeted and noticed we can probably get seated quickly due to the emptiness. We were seated within 2 minutes of being there. We sat down and no one came to greet our table or offer us water within the first few mins. We figured that someone was going to come around. We have our orders now ready and are just waiting for the servers. Nothing....I go to the bathroom to wash my hands....nothing. We waited about 20 mins before we decided to walk out. This was our first time walking out EVER and thought it was warranted. I don't know if they were training new staff or undermanned. But wow, not even a drink order after 10 mins. This is my 2nd review ever. The end."
Fanny R.,"San Diego, CA",0,6,,4.0,5/11/2016,"I love this place! However, I give it a 4 star because their customer service has been lacking. If you want a tip work for it. That's my theory, tips are not mandatory and I am not picky at all, I am real easy to please as a customer."
Katlyn H.,"San Diego, CA",0,2,,1.0,11/9/2016,"Overall it was just terrible lmao .. The lady who seated us had a horrible attitude & we weren't given any silverware but the couple next to us & everyone else who was seated did. We were a party of 6 , & were given this tiny little booth to where we had basically no room to even look at our menus and eat comfortably. Our waiter did not notice that we didn't have silverware either until I said something.... Food definitely wasn't worth how expensive it was. It was my families first time going there & we definitely won't be returning"
Joanna L.,"Hawaiian Gardens, CA",36,7,1,1.0,12/11/2015,"Waited an extremely long time. Our waitress was Jafer? Something like that. We had to remind her of the appetizers/sides we ordered , almost an hour after ordering and it still took 20 minutes after that. She then brought us our checks without ever getting us our entrées.  I've worked in food service before so I know how it goes but she totally forgot our order or never even turned it in, and this was on a regular lunch time on a Friday. So we just cancelled the order, shoot I was not waiting another hour just so she could forget again. The place isn't even half full. Never coming back again."
Mylena D.,"Everett, MA",103,12,1,1.0,6/13/2015,"Came here with a party of 8, waiter was very disorganized from the start. Slight mess ups with drink orders but nothing too bad until our food came out. He put the wrong entree in, so we all got our food besides one person. Came back to reassure her that what she ordered is what she got and we had to read the ingredients for him so he could finally see it was the wrong entree. He did not refill beverages and took over 20 minutes to bring the check. P.S. The party next to us left after too long of a wait. Get your restaurant staff together."
Juan F.,"Chula Vista, CA",30,78,24,5.0,4/26/2015,"Huge menu. Great variety. Great for a large family with varied tastes.  Hate that the calorie count is on the menu. . . . Stuff I'd want to try just over the top calorie wise. . . . If I didn't know,  I'd eat it!  Ignorance is bliss. That said,  they have some tasty low calorie dishes. Worth giving them a try.  My kids love the desserts. I do too."
Beran Y.,"San Antonio, TX",1,16,,1.0,11/1/2015,"This is the WORST BJ's location in San Diego.  Every time, I mean every time my wife go to this location we receive crappy service.  We have tried and tried again to see if service would improve but on each visit it seems to get worse.  The food is great, it is the staff that needs a reboot.  Choose any other BJ's location and you will be very satisfied."
Nessa P.,"Spring Valley, CA",19,42,22,2.0,3/11/2015,"This was our first time at BJ's. Decided to bring my husband out here for his birthday dinner; I wish I hadn't. We had done an ""online reservation"" where we were able to preorder our meals and have seats reserved.   This was a fantastic feature considering I take FOREVER figuring out what I want. Saved my husband from having to wait around on me ;)  Once arrival, we were promptly seated. Shortly after, my husband received his clam chowder (part of entrée) even before our waiter greeted us. It was REALLY GOOD. We got out drinks, then our appetizers came out VERY fast. Good? Not much..we ordered loaded potato skin..DRY DRY DRY. Carnitas verde fries..DRY DRY DRY...we ate it because we were starving but had to down it with water.. Time for entrée..my husband ordered a full rack of bbq ribs. Just by the looks of it, it looked incredibly DRYYYY. My husbands facial expression confirmed it..I ordered the mahi-mahi with the rice..the fish was DRYYYYYY, no flavor, the rice was way too sweet, I couldn't take more than a bite :( we ordered our 3 year old daughter chicken, rice and veggies off the kids meal. My daughter is NOT a picky eater, she eats nearly everything..the chicken was DRY veggies tasted old, rice was too hard.. Needless to say, the quality of food was poor, overpriced and service was OK. My husband and I both agreed, we would not return..might as well get some steak and throw it on the grill at home lol"
Mykael M.,"San Diego, CA",249,8,1,5.0,4/23/2016,"Now I love Chicago deep dish and there really is no comparison but the extreme pepperoni deep dish there is pretty good.  A little fluffy but the taste is excellent.   The Service was great, always around when we need something and the ambience has a relaxed feel to it."
Steve R.,"San Diego, CA",0,26,,2.0,7/13/2016,"20 minutes for a server followed by 35 minutes for service. Had the bison burger but it had no seasoning. Tasted like cardboard. Brought folks here because I liked it last year but not tonight. No charm-- bad food , slow service and a lot of noise."
Germain L.,"San Diego, CA",17,45,32,4.0,4/7/2015,"Food was really good, good vibration all around.  Waiter was really courteous and helpful, desert took a while to arrive ( 25 Minutes )  we ended up canceling it....but our waiter was really nice to keep us happy and to try to make it up to us he gave us our desert on the house! I was please with the service and food.  I will go again soon!"
Priscilla W.,"Chula Vista, CA",10,16,1,2.0,2/20/2016,"I'm only giving two stars because of my waitress who tried her best. Once I ordered our food the appetizer comes out by some girl that's not my waitress, she drops out food hard on the table, brings no plates for three people, I then ask if she can bring plates and I get the dirtiest look, she doesn't say sure or thank you she  just walks off, she comes back and slams our plates down like it was a real problem. We were sitting for a while with no drinks and we ask another waitress (ours was busy) if she could bring a refill and she tells us well I'm not your waitress but I will tell yours (bad attitude) she ends up bringing our 1 refill and again slams it on the table. I'm not trying to be bitchy but I have worked in customer service, the one way to bring a customer back is having a great attitude. I will not be coming back sadly and I live around the corner."
Mo O.,"El Cajon, CA",211,63,36,3.0,1/28/2016,"Went here for lunch. Easy to get in and sit, but table was set and dirty. Not a great start to a lunch date! Table behind us was dirty too. after getting cleaned up the food was great. We shared the Chicken Quinoa and they split the portions into two plates. I cant tell you how impressed I was with the quality and taste of this dish. I'm going back for this dish, but maybe a different place or time."
Katina R.,"Chula Vista, CA",81,8,,1.0,4/1/2016,"The food is good but not worth the extended wait. Once seated, there seems to always be a long wait to get served.  Our waitress was nice and helpful.  We were there on a sunday just right after they opened. No hostess was available so the bartender sat us at a table.  Couldn't decipher why there were two hostesses so early with no traffic. It seems they could have lended a hand to help the 6 total tables being waited on. I mean the bartender helped the hostess out in their absence. We arrived and there was no hostess."
Gestalt G.,"San Diego, CA",1,84,,2.0,8/5/2016,"Decent food, and they are good when you first get there.  I've been there twice for lunch this week.  Once you have your food, you are pretty much on your own.  The first time, it took 20 minutes to get my check, and I had to go to the manager to run my payment - or who knows how long I'd be there.  The second time, it was ten minutes, with a 5 minute wait for process. Guess they are getting better, but really - they gotta get themselves together."
Cindy M.,"Chula Vista, CA",56,3,,1.0,11/9/2015,"Horrible customer service. I used to come here often and it was great. I went recently and it was very disappointing. The server was very inattentive and kept sending us the wrong order. When I asked to be moved, it got better but the food wasn't very good at all. To top it off, they tried to charge me for food I didn't even order, because the first server put it on my tab. Not going back anytime soon."
Matthew K.,"Coronado, CA",0,4,,5.0,11/15/2014,Food here is decent I wouldn't come so often were it not for Pricilla's  awesome  service! Had an average 3 course meal last night and wow she made me feel like I was at a fine dining establishment as always! Pizzookies are to die for plus excellent service = Winning!! Keep it up I highly recommend you request sitting in Pricilla's section do yourself the favor!
