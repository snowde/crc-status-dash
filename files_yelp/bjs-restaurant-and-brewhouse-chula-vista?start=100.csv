Norah A.,"San Diego, CA",26,24,18,5.0,8/7/2016,"The food is delicious, the atmosphere is just simply perfect. Ernest was the best waiter I've had so far everrrrr! If you get him, you are so lucky!"
Raul C.,"Chula Vista, CA",1,7,7,5.0,6/24/2016,Good fast service always a plus. Our server was Gennezys. Very nice and attentive. We got the chicken tortilla soup and wedge salad both very fresh. spaghetti and meatballs and the Parmesan crusted chicken. Very delicious. Very generous portions. To drink we had the white peach margarita and they're in house root of evil ginger iPa. Very good drinks. Always Enjoy this place and keep me coming back.
Jaime R.,"Chula Vista, CA",32,84,18,1.0,11/11/2016,"Very sad and utterly disappointed. BJ's left us hanging or should I say starving like second class citizens! Me and fellow veterans went on Veteran's day to enjoy a complimentary meal on BJ's thanking us for our service! We went to BJ's over other restaurants hoping to satiate our hunger. Well, BJ's made sure too keep us starving after we waited and waited in our booth for an hour for our sandwiches. We finally tapped out and called it quits after seeing other veterans leave with disappointed faces. Other patrons appeared to be happy with their service. I began to think that maybe just maybe we were not their top priority. I am also gonna mention Kerry, our server, she abandoned us! She did her shift change and failed to do a proper turn-over with incoming server. This experience made us feel unappreciated and really hungry! It was just plain sad how they treated us on our day we were supposed to feel honored for serving and defending our country!  To Jennifer Brady the General Manager please fix this disaster."
Brittany R.,"San Diego, CA",40,3,7,5.0,10/9/2015,"For a Thursday night, BJ'S was very busy. Even to catch a seat for 1 was quite a wait. However the spinach stuffed mushrooms were quite tasty, not overly fatty. The pesto garlic aioli sauce paired very well with it. The chicken pot stickers tasted delectable. Each bite was better than the last!  Their strawberry lemonade was super refreshing. Not too sweet, with the right amount of sour too! :)"
Vanessa C.,"Chula Vista, CA",14,12,1,1.0,8/13/2016,"Sat for quite some time waiting for the staff to acknowledge my sister and I. Then after waiting a ridiculous amount of time for our food to arrive, the salad I ordered had old spinach in it that was dark and slimy. My sisters order was wrong, and when the server came over to correct the food runner, she not only didn't make eye contact with either of us, but she actually seemed annoyed.  Not once did anyone ask how our food was, until the server came over to bring us the bill. Finally she asked if I was finished with my salad, or if something was wrong. Wow. Talk about amazing customer service.  This is now my second visit in a row that shows the food here lacks flavor, but now the service is terrible as well. We definitely won't be coming back to BJ's again."
Shannon B.,"Chula Vista, CA",42,22,28,1.0,1/28/2017,"Wow; kitchen it definitely having an off night. Food was way over spiced and came out cold. Weird bc it came out very fast. Service was Ok, nothing to write home about but definitely heart breaking on the bill when food was so bad. Prob won't eat here again."
Jennifer A.,"Mission Valley, San Diego, CA",10,32,1,2.0,6/7/2016,"Ate at this location once before. I don't remember the details only that I had a mediocre experience. Anyway, it was a while ago (and maybe a fluke) so I thought maybe I'd give it another try. Besides, I was meeting a friend in the area and there are few places here with decent happy hour.  We came in ~5pm and it was near empty. The hostess motioned that we could seat ourselves at the designated bar area for happy hour. This was fine as from the door, we could see some booths available. Or so we thought. There were 4-5 of them, but they were all yet to be busted. So awkwardly, we walked about before we seated ourselves at the ""cleanest"" table. They busted it right in front of us.  The waitress then came to get our order. She was ok and on point. She brought out our drinks and food before going on her break and giving us the courtesy of introducing her relief while she was gone.  We ordered 3 appetizers along with our drinks.  The California Club flatbread was good. The calamari was just fair. (But I am a fried squid fiend so naturally, I've had better.) My friend was looking forward to the boneless wings. It was a disappointment, more so because not sure if it was what we ordered. She wanted the spicier sauce. We questioned the waiter on it and not being certain himself decided to bring the sauce plate up to his nose to sniff it. My friend was disgusted by this, and left that sauce to the side under quarantine.   I really wanted dessert, but decided Starbucks, a couple doors down would suffice as a better option. Our bill was not cheap. Our regular waitress returned and my friend opted to let her know about the ""sauce incident"" as we were signing the check, not to complain but to give them the constructive criticism to better their service (so she reasoned). Does it matter anyway? Needless to say, we won't be returning, and will have to continue our search for better happy hour elsewhere. [Two stars for ambiance and potential.]"
Lilibeth L.,"Chula Vista, CA",248,124,2793,4.0,7/16/2015,"BJ's in Chula Vista open mall is a big restaurant with a sports bar.  I remember my first time here, the immediate impression was, I'm inside a theater with dimmed lighting just before the movie starts. The sports bar is brighter than the dining area because of the light emitted by the big screen tv. The host seated us and left and then the wait staff came with the menu. Asked us what to drink and left. Several minutes later came back and took our order. We ordered the jambalaya, shrimp scampi (my favorite) and calamari. We didn't see the wait staff for quite a while. I guess there's a lot of walking to cover since the place is bigger than normal size restaurant. So, if you need something just stop one of the wait staff passing by."
Evelyn A.,"San Diego, CA",104,337,241,5.0,7/2/2016,"I love the staff , I went for my birthday and they were so helpful and were on time in seating us. The food is amazing and the alcoholic drink are on point ."
Amara G.,"Chula Vista, CA",259,2,2,1.0,8/8/2015,This calamari is Disgusting and soggy and smells like poop. I've never been so grossed out by a dish before DO NOT ORDER THIS CALAMARI TO GO! I'm about to barf at work
Jay G.,"San Diego, CA",2,38,1,4.0,1/23/2017,"This is one of two BJ's locations that I visit when I'm looking for a big, delicious ""cheat meal"" and dessert!  I went last night with someone else and we had a terrific dinner with terrific service from George. I had never had BJ's deep dish pizza before and it was so incredibly yummy!  We each ordered the smallest size and ended up taking half home. It reheated well tonight, too.  As always, the Pizookie dessert is top notch! My personal favorite is the salted caramel."
Joseph R.,"Chula Vista, CA",284,10,,1.0,3/18/2017,American your lady was serving us. We come here alot and was going to use our points. She was really rude with us and we sat at a table near a bar. Someone needs to talk to her
Bob P.,"Santee, CA",13,33,10,5.0,6/23/2016,"Some where the first review I wrote got lost on its way to posting, so here I go again.  I stopped in for a sandwich and beer.  Only time here before was an old employer/employee beer bust in the patio, and quite honestly I don't remember much about it. It was crowded and those waiting at reception were backed up so I seated my self in front of the draft bank at the bar.  I was promptly greeted by Mathew, whom inquired as to my drink preference and offered a menu.  I was directly in front of a Brewhouse Brand tap called Jeremiah Red.  It looked appealing so I asked for it.  Mathew asked if I had ever had it before and my negative response prompted him to pour a good sized taste.  It was like something familiar I had before but couldn't place at that instance.  My comment to the bartender was, ""this is very drinkable."" Almost as quick as I mentioned this my salad appeared, and in a few more brief moments my triple decker sandwich was in front of me.  Both were excellent, and I sipped some, but didn't pay too much attention to my ale.  After the heavy duty chow down was finished, I had time to pay attention to the beer.  It dawned on me that it is nearly identical to one of my favorite pub beers in England.  It was either McCaffery's or Caffery's Irish Cream Ale.  Then I noticed the tap had in small letters Irish style ale.   Food was really good service was quick and friendly price was fair.   As I paid and tipped, I told my new bartender friend that the beer alone will bring me in again whenever I'm in the area."
Lisa G.,"La Jolla, La Jolla, CA",2,57,3,2.0,1/9/2017,"Tried the Lunch takeout today although the food was average, the service was no good. You would think they would be prepared to provide utensils and condiments when you order take-out for lunch. Make sure you check the bag before leaving. With so many options around I don't think I will order from here again."
Martina M.,"San Diego, CA",1,43,36,2.0,3/11/2017,I use to love going here and had an awesome waiter. I fell in love with their mix drink called the California redwood mojito. We went  tonight and the waitress we got said that they don't have it. They also didn't clean our table. I feel like this was the worst service because we waited for a whole hour before getting in and the waitress gave me an attitude too. I asked her for ice tea with sweeteners but she just gave me the tea. I'm mostly irritated the drink isn't served anymore even though I got it before when it wasn't on the menu
Susanne R.,"San Diego, CA",450,542,888,4.0,11/2/2015,Their Pizzookies are crazy good. Start with dessert and work your way backwards.  I have been here several times and the food and service is uniformly good. Parking is plentiful and if you want to grab a cup of coffee afterwards you have both Panera and Starbucks within walking distance.
Frank Y.,"San Diego, CA",0,6,6,2.0,3/3/2017,I went to this place to a going away lunch for one of my Sailors and ordered a bacon burger.  Well let me tell you...the meat was absolutely the worst tasting meat I have ever had.  It was so bad and tasteless that the bun was the only thing I tasted aside from the bacon.  Made me wonder what kind of meat I was eating.  Even Kangaroo burgers in Austraila had more flavor cold than this place.  When I got the $11 dollar bill with fries included I almost raised hell.  I kept my cool because we were in uniform and I let it go.  Beware!
AJ S.,"Poway, CA",0,6,,1.0,7/29/2017,Finally got good service too bad the food was awful.  The lemon thyme chicken was an anemic little piece of chicken grilled on one side then cut in half and set on tip a bowl of ride with some tomatoes and unseasoned Brussels sprouts. There was no lemon or thyme flavor whatsoever and I left the restaurant hungrier then when I arrived.  That dish need to come off the menu it truly tasted like the cook boiled the chicken rice and Brussels sprouts before dumping them in a bowl.
George P.,"San Diego, CA",111,44,16,5.0,12/15/2016,"Angelica, working the register, was awesome. She handled a rush hour with customers and phone calls at the same time in a professional manner and was still able to be friendly. Great customer service at this location."
Tom ..,"Chula Vista, CA",0,2,,5.0,2/13/2017,"Incredibly friendly staff every time i have gone in, who have never failed to remember my face, and quick to remember what i like!"
