M T.,"San Diego, CA",0,10,1,1.0,7/2/2017,Waiting for a looooooong time to be seated when there are so many tables available.  Management is not around to control the flow of people
Stormy G.,"San Diego, CA",43,14,8,5.0,5/16/2015,"My boyfriend and I go here frequently for lunch on the weekends or dinner during the week. He loves craft beer and when I want to drink, they offer cider on tap or mimosas for me. The food is always awesome and the service is usually pretty good, depending on how busy they are.  We have tried and recommend the shrimp scampi and parmesan crusted chicken. Also, the chicken tortilla soup is the best around and we ALWAYS get the carnitas chile verde fries appetizer, but honestly it could be a full meal in itself! We will continue to frequent this spot :)"
S S.,"San Diego, CA",0,77,1,2.0,12/27/2016,Good service but the food is way too oily and the meats are tough. It's not worth the money for people that actually enjoy dining in restaurants this is more like a sports bar
M. C.,"National City, CA",0,2,,3.0,1/29/2017,Three stars at the most. Don't order the Santa Fe Salad. The dressing was so bitter I couldn't eat it. The rest of the food was so so. That waitress kept disappearing for long stretches at a time. Update - they took the salad off the bill since it was inedible.
Stephi A.,"Chula Vista, CA",98,5,1,1.0,7/22/2017,"As a former service industry member, I was completely appalled today going to BJ,s for lunch, not only did the hostess not greet us , they were all busy in their personal conversations but she leaned then POINTED us in the direction of where we should be seated, I am a preferred member and requested my check in at my table, it was not transfered. So clearly she wasnt doing her job in that area, As soon as we turned to walk to the table we were directed to the group of employees continued their loud and personal conversation. This went on the entire time we were inside the restaurant,as a hostess you're the face of that restaurant, these faces showed laziness and disconcern  about general the duties as a host. This is a pretty crappy experience just to walk in to. Walking out was the same, while we were sitting we noticed they did the same with other customers, it's really just disappointing,  as we walked out I saw one of the host just sitting at the couch and again they were busy talking to say goodbye. Get it together guys. You're getting paid for saying hi and WALKING guest to the table and saying Bye , it's not anyone else's responsibility."
Brandon R.,"Mount Vernon, WA",69,17,3,1.0,10/15/2016,"Foods decent, pricing is a little high and would be worth it if the service was equally rated. Been here twice, not had an attentive server throughout the duration of the meal. Usually turnover mid_meal with less attentive personnel. Very disappointing."
Maridel A.,"Hillcrest, San Diego, CA",1777,928,1852,5.0,3/27/2015,"I love their pizza & chicken wings. If youre not a rewards member... sign up now!  Great happy hour specials. used to come here often since it was across the street from my previous employer. In one week i came here 4 times for my farewell with different co-workers --- and i still didnt get tired of their menu. Their mini dish pizza for 1 meal is soooooo good! Comes with a side salad. The tomato sauce has chunks of tomatos and the crust is so thick and soft. I never share my mini pizza with anyone... sometimes ill offer just to be nice but hoping my friend will say ""no thank you"" then im like YAASSSS all mine! ha!"
Joseph M.,"Long Beach, CA",59,128,12,2.0,5/8/2016,"I've been here's few times before and my experience was amazing. Today (Mothers day) 5:28pm I walked in to put my family on the waiting listed. I wasn't greeted by the host that was at the counter I believe she was pregnant, that kind of through off my mood. She was a bit rude. I'm standing here now, watching her pick things out of her teeth with her tongue. I asked for a menu and she handed it to me over her should facing the opposite direction, she didn't even look at me. I would put someone else in the host stand since that is the first impression and greeting. Anyway I'm looking forward to having dinner with my family."
Jennie S.,"Oceanside, CA",2,2,1,1.0,1/21/2017,Heard from many people this place was good and it was awful!!! The server told me they didn't have any steak sauce maybe just 2 bottles that were almost empty and it would take her a while to track it down. How can you sell steak and not have any steak sauce. We had to steal a bottle from a table and that bottle was almost empty. The food was not good. Fancy place but that's pretty much it.  Ps the servers kept taking food to the wrong tables. Never ever coming back. Maybe for the chocolate chuck plizookie or whatever it's called
Ian D.,"Brooklyn, NY",92,13,1,1.0,4/4/2016,"This review is not for the food or the service. Which both were fantastic. Our server Ernesto was excellent and I can't get enough of the avocado egg rolls.  This is for the two women at the front counter who took our names down around 5pm on Saturday 4/2/16. When my wife and I walked in, we were pleasantly greeted and we waited until our pager beeped. When it did, we walked back to the front counter and gave the pager to one of these two women. One of them asked who it was for, and the other woman replied ""It's for Ian"" The other girl started mocking my name right in front of me and my wife. She softly repeated ""EEEE-ooonn"" ""EEEEE-ooonnn"" like a donkey. It took me a while to realize what was going on then another person escorted us to our table. It bothered me for the rest of our dinner. I would have never thought that I'd be treated this way by restaurant staff."
Nicki O.,"San Diego, CA",106,7,9,4.0,12/28/2016,It is cold! Other than freezing and sort under the AC service was good and the food was good too
Jennifer W.,"San Diego, CA",98,173,131,1.0,10/30/2016,"Wow been here a handful of times and every time, no matter what, dismal service! My group ordered drinks which we didn't get, so we went to the bar and ordered the drinks again ourselves. We gave our server the benefit of the doubt and ordered food, then once our food arrived we waited 10 minutes for cutlery.This was my favorite point because I was in the bar earlier and offered to take the silverware I already had at the bar to our freshly available table and the bar waitstaff told me no, you have silverware and menus at your table so you don't need to bring those things. WRONG. Then our food took forever and arrived cold, while the one who ordered salad had a salad that arrived warm. Amazing. At this point we figured we were being deliberately shafted so we quickly ate what we could and grabbed to go boxes. Now here's the kicker: The manager did speak to us once to apologize but before we left we tried to tell him we were leaving and he WOULDN'T COME TO YOUR TALK TO US. Wow you scared of three middle-aged people who just want to drink and eat? Nice. We're out."
Rose M.,"San Diego, CA",0,5,,2.0,7/16/2017,"Went this past Sunday sat at the bar area took a minute for someone to help us..ordered appetizers took awhile to get them out to us..wings,spinach artichoke dip,stuffed mushrooms and wedge salad..well everything came out except for salad I asked the girl who brought it out to us if she can check on salad 10-15 minutes passed and then I asked the waitress what happened to the salad she apologized and said she'll check by then I didn't want it anymore because I wanted to have it before appetizers came out, not only that the stuffed mushrooms were smaller than actual picture and the waitress had an excuse for everything. Said she was gonna get the manager but never came. Overall bad experience booo!"
Zack F.,"La Mesa, CA",242,132,143,5.0,7/11/2016,Marlon is the man of bj hands down fast service and Great customer service you could ever get thank you again
Amy E.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,4,1,1.0,1/7/2017,"Terrible food. Ordered 3 kids meals ,a wedge salad, calamari,  a couple of beers, and a spicy Hawaiian pizza. Beers came after salad and calamari. Pizza was delivered not even hot. You could tell they par-bake the dough and then throw a bunch of toppings on and warm it. Kind of like a boboli you can get at the grocery store. Pizza doesn't take 4 minutes to cook, especially deep dish. Pizza Hut is better than this crap. Calamari was salty and cold. Kids meals were meh. Service was extremely slow and forgetful. No one checked on us. Managers on duty were glorified servers and I'm sure happened into their positions. Congrats on running a crap show. I have been in the restaurant business my whole working career and know when it can be done and should be done better. Never again."
Jaime J.,"Ooltewah, TN",15,147,25,3.0,7/19/2015,"You know what you're going to get when you come to this place. Food is solid, drinks are good, and so is the service. I had the barbecue bison burger, and it was excellent. The Mojito was very refreshing. I wish it wouldn't have had so much ice in it. There was one dessert that has less than 1000 cal. Watch out for that!"
Edwin A.,"San Diego, CA",134,84,103,1.0,3/30/2016,"I came here for happy hour, but was tricked and realized it was SAD HOUR. Let me start off with saying this place is sad never come here at all. This place is as sorry as the mall. The service was as slow as a snail. The servers didn't check up on us, and the food arrived slower them slow. When your at the restaurant you just wanna yell because you waited so long for an appetizer. Worse place ever. DO NOT ENTER!!!!"
Nathaly A.,"San Diego, CA",0,10,20,5.0,3/18/2016,"I love Bj's. At first I would just go for the Pizookie because I had never tried it before; the food never really called my attention. First, I tried their fettuccine Alfredo and it was kind of dry, it was okay but I had tasted better. Then, I tried their sandwich and I became obsessed. I am not a sandwich person but their California Chicken Club is delicious  I order that every time I go now, must try!"
Taniah S.,"Los Angeles, CA",31,26,9,2.0,11/14/2015,Okay so I was originally going to give this place 4  but now it's 2 stars.  Pros: Food was amazingly delicious  Only took 25-30 minutes to come out Bust boy noticed we were impatient so he came over to ask if we needed anything  Cons:  Waitress was overwhelmed  Forgot our appetizer  Forgot to not add onions to our burger Bathroom was trashed Toilet sprayed water at me when I pushed the flush lever  No refills unless asked.
Dan A.,"San Diego, CA",1,6,,1.0,10/4/2016,"Food was average. Service was very bad. Took awhile to get our food; it wasn't until we saw the manager walk by and asked when can we expect to receive our food that it finally came out. The manager went to the kitchen and within minutes came out with the food. Unfortunately, some of the dishes were not fully warm. We also didn't get our appetizer in time, and the manager had to bring it out with our entrees; luckily, he comp'd the appetizer and we didn't have to pay for it. The experience at this restaurant similar to other BJ locations in SD have been poor. If you plan on coming here to eat, plan on being here for awhile. Or, consider picking up some food at the Rubios next door who would probably get you food faster than the service you would receive at BJs."
