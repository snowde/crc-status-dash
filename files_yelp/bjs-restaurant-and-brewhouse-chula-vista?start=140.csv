Lesa R.,"San Diego, CA",20,6,,5.0,7/1/2017,"My husband and I went into BJ's in Chula Vista yesterday around 2:30,  we  sat in the bar because that was the only available booth, I am glad that we Did! We had the best service! I can't remember the server's name, it began with an E, but she was super attentive and friendly and our food was so fresh and delicious! I hadn't been to BJ's in awhile but after yesterday we will be back more often! Best rib eye and ribs ever! We usually go to Olive Garden but lately they always have a wait at 2 in the afternoon, and since I work in a restaurant I know that 2 is down time and their excuse is always not enough servers on, well BJs is well managed because we didn't have that problem there, and the food was a lot better too!"
Sergio V.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,11,,5.0,12/28/2016,"Absolutely love this place. Attended today with a party of 3 and  was seated in less then 10 mins. Really love the vibe of the place and the way it was decorated. The waitress was the best! Made sure I always had something to drink and if my food was lagging she would come to let me know. I ordered the chicken alfredo pasta, I was actually pretty suprised by how good it was. It wasn't dry or to filled with sauce. Overall experience was perfect."
Yadira T.,"Chula Vista, CA",93,12,,2.0,9/10/2016,"I used to love BJ's! So sad to see the servers running around with their heads cut off. Every single one of them looks super stressed and unhappy to be there. Poor service, dirty floors, and their food is just ok."
Johana T.,"San Diego, CA",477,556,1264,3.0,1/7/2014,"Service at the bar area is very slow.. servers are always forgetting about their tables and the food comes out late.  Last night I went in during happy hour (because the college game was on it was extended) and I had no problem getting a table, there were about 6 tables open and plenty of bar stools. My friend and I sat down, ordered, then got our drinks within minutes. But the appetizers, those took a good 20 mins. Then we ordered our food: 2 individual pizzas... another 20 mins later, only ONE pizza came out. After I flagged down the waiter who had been no where in site, he said ""ohhhhh sorry I'll go check"" then came back 5 mins later and said ""the kitchen is making it right now"" then walked away.. MEANING that he forgot to put it in. He didn't even apologize again and 2nd pizza was brought out 5 mins later. Soooooo as I said before, kind of bad service but the actual food is good :)"
Jojo V.,"San Diego, CA",2,70,5,1.0,7/16/2016,"Just left this lousy place and went next door to buffalo wild wings instead.  We came (only 2 of us) and the young Latina hostess attitude was so terrible we left.  She never said hello, never smiled looked pregnant and depressed to be there.  Did not even ask our names to wait to be seated.  Restaurant was at half capacity and still have to wait? No thanks . This place is ghetto as hell. Go to mission valley location instead much better. .."
Johnna G.,"El Cajon, CA",42,28,6,2.0,10/13/2016,"The wait here is horrendous every time. Not to get a seat, but for everything else (drinks, order, food, check). I feel half the staff isn't familiar with the menu and look at you stupid when you ask for what's offered. Anyways. Im pretty much sure I'll never eat here again."
Kevin G.,"Chula Vista, CA",1,5,,3.0,5/25/2017,"We love going to BJ's, but the avocado egg rolls aren't what they used to be. Service is o.k. The food is pretty good, and we keep coming for the pizookie! The wait even in busy days is reasonable. I suggest calling ahead."
Jenn B.,"San Diego, CA",8,22,21,1.0,11/8/2015,"I am actually still here and ready to just walk out... The service is terrible and I know I shouldn't let that over shadow the taste of the food, but it is.. The calamari isn't crispy, the lemon wedges are dry.. My husband asked for a Vanilla Cream Float but didn't get the ice cream until he flagged down the waitress... And instead of making it for him she just brought out ice cream. To top it off they hand is our pizza without any plates! ANNNNDDDD our waitress is no where to be found.. The other wait staff walk by extremely fast so it's hard to even ask any one for plates...  This place is ridiculous!"
Joseph Y.,"La Mesa, CA",376,1059,4604,4.0,10/24/2014,"Another workday lunch time and between all the choices we had at Chula Vista Center, BJ's Brewhouse always sticks in my mind as a great place to grab a good lunch. This location was quite dead for the lunch crowd at the time, very quiet. Atmosphere was great and the place was really top notch clean. Service was outstanding, our waiter was great about offering the lunch specials and really catered to keeping our ice tea's full. I went with my usual lunch special of the chicken tacos with a side of black beans. You really can't beat the price of $5.95 for a good sized lunch. My coworker ordered the ham sandwich lunch special, but also wanted to try the Twisted BLT salad on the side which peaked my interest to try one also. The twisted BLT salad was a really good salad which came with spinach, boiled egg, bacon, cheese and bits of corn. Definitely better than getting a plain ole house salad. This location of BJ""s Brewhouse was a great place to stop in for lunch and their prices definitely beat their competition out in the area."
Joseph V.,"San Diego, CA",1,73,382,3.0,8/11/2015,Stop by to have anniversary lunch with my wife... Been here before and had a great experience... 12:53 Tuesday and it seems like it's starting to pickup! Staff is very friendly and we were seated quickly... Great environment and clean! Cons: -A/C is High! - Our appetizer came out pretty quick but our main orders still haven't came out yet! Over 45 mins!  And it's just my wife and I.... Was seated at 12:50 now it's 1:55.... Food finally came out and it was delicious. It sucked cause we only had 10mins to eat
Ashley S.,"San Diego, CA",0,14,17,1.0,9/25/2016,"So disappointed! My family and I usually come in once a month or so but the last few times have been mediocre. Tonight was the final straw. Came in with a party of 7 on a Sunday (9/25) around 6:30. Was told it would be about 20-25 minutes to be seated. 45 minutes later and we were still waiting. I asked the hostess at the door how much longer it would take and she tells us another 15-20 minutes. At this point my family was hungry and not willing to wait so I asked to sit at one of the tables that were clearly open. And the hostess gives me THE WORST attitude staying ""well you guys won't fit there but you can try"". I'm a nice person and I've worked service jobs so I've dealt with rude people - so I didn't give attitude back but I made it clear that this was not okay. Dude, at this point we're just trying to eat and go - we could have left and let you guys lose $200 (which is what we spend on average when dining at BJs). They finally get us seated at a table but not without attitude from the hostess and whomever the manager on duty was (he was wearing a blue colored shirt). Our waiter was extremely nice and attentive. But our food took close to another hour to come out which I don't understand because at this point, half of the restaurant was empty (it was 8:40 at this point). And to top it off, most of our food was cold. Def not cool. It tasted as if our food sat there for 20 minutes. I'm not sure if they were understaffed or what but this was the worst service I've had ever at this BJs. Probably won't be back for a while."
Nienke W.,"Leidsche Rijn, The Netherlands",33,87,297,4.0,4/14/2015,"We had a great experience here. We were waited on by an enthousiastic serving girl who wasn't intimidated by our group of 13 nerds. Ambiance was nice, felt hip! I still don't like to see tv screens in restaurants, but thats seems to be an American thing.  My love and I had the Seares Ahi Salad, and it was great! Tuna was tender and full of flavour, wasabi was heavenly spicey and the salad retained a great taste untill the last bite. You know how salads sometimes start of great and suddenly you are left with only lettuce!? Not this one! Yum!"
Cel P.,"Chula Vista, CA",86,179,442,3.0,1/2/2015,My go to place for weekend brunch. Who wants to stand around waiting for a table at Ihop or Denny's when I can be seated in seconds!  Quick Tip: Kids pancake plate is less than $3.00
Dejohn K.,"Fullerton, CA",353,19,5,1.0,5/7/2016,"Today I was served by Jafer V, and i had the worst service ever! I normally dont write reviews but i felt that i should let others know. I sat down and wasn't seen for 10-15 mins. When my server did show up he asked us if we were ready to order drinks. By this time i had looked over the entire menu 300 times( exaggerating). So i ordered. Food came out fast, but i was given no condiments. Everyone wants ketchup with their fries! So u had ti wait another 5 mins before my waiter came back to ask for that. After eating i had to wait another 15 mins before i could ask for my tab. Even the table next to me complained because of the bad service. I don't know what the deal was today. I've been to this restaurant multiple times and the service has always been great. Today was very unpleasant!"
Alex D.,"San Diego, CA",31,58,29,4.0,10/16/2015,"Nice atmosphere, OK food. Pizza was ok, just a bit salty for me. The calamari was really salty and really, really greasey they should of drained it more. Beer, however, off the chain!!!"
Jaaon D.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,2,,5.0,4/7/2017,"Came in today for Happy Hour, my wife and I got the half off pizzas and avocado egg rolls. Delish! Our server Paige was lovely and attentive to our needs even with a pretty busy bar area. We will definitely be coming back with our friends for Happy Hour, and will definitely be asking for Paige!!"
H.E. G.,"Chula Vista, CA",19,5,,1.0,4/6/2017,"The crust was odd, over cooked in the bottom, dry in the middle. Plus, no tomatoes!!! When did red sauce become the norm? So disappointed."
Maritess C.,"Imperial Beach, CA",651,1121,4657,4.0,12/6/2014,Went here for dinner tonight. I had the brocolli cheddar soup in a bread bowl & a tropical tea to drink. The soup with the toasted bread bowl was delicious. Service was a little slow with the drinks but overall a good experience. We will be back.
Catherine B.,"San Diego, CA",128,66,656,3.0,10/6/2014,"I've been here a few times before and the food has been okay. I went more recently for dinner with my family and we were all very displeased with the quality of the entrees/main dishes. My husband ordered a tri-tip stroganoff (some new seasonal dish) and had to send it back because it had absolutely no taste. My sister ordered the scallops plate and the scallops tasted as if they were previously frozen and then boiled. The veggies on her plate were over-cooked and shriveled. I ordered a chicken alfredo pasta plate and also felt that the pasta was very bland hand had no taste. I've had sandwiches and burgers from here before, and have always felt satisfied. For some reason their main dishes seem to fall flat. The reason this recent visit was so disappointing was because the drinks and appetizers we had ordered were amazing! The avocado egg rolls were delicious & crispy, the deep fried artichoke was savory, and the carnitas fries were incredibly flavorful.  I would recommend coming to BJ's for drinks and appetizers, but you'd be better off staying away from the main dishes, because they're basic and tasteless."
Jorge L.,"Chula Vista, San Diego, CA",855,2,1,1.0,3/30/2016,Worst place ever.   Waited 7 minutes before anybody acknowledged us. Michael (server) and Jesse ( Manager ) said it was not their fault.   I left and went to Panera Bread.   This was the third time.   No more BJ's Chula Vista
