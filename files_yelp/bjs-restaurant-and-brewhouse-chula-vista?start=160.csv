Dalia S.,"Kihei, HI",68,4,7,5.0,4/17/2016,Must dine here for lunch dinner or happy hour!!  Jennifer the manager was wonderful to our family. My compliments to whoever hired such a caring loving manager.  She accommodated our table close to our little puppy who was sitting outside by a window. Thank y Jennifer we will be visiting this bjs more often!!!
Jack M.,"San Diego, CA",5000,4064,27983,3.0,8/17/2014,"I came to BJ's for a quick lunch and I notified my server that I was on a lunch hour. I ordered the original baked potato with added bacon and I side wedge salad with blue cheese dressing.  The wedge salad was good and the blue cheese dressing creamy with just the right amount of thickness, that it adhered to the salad well. The dressing tasted good and the chopped bacon strips on top were very good with a nice bacon flavor and texture ( ). The baked potato was good. It came well dressed with melted cheddar and a lot of bacon which tasted great ( ), but I did not like the way they put the whipped butter and sour cream in the same container where it intermixed. I only wanted sour cream and I kept getting butter mixed in, so I t kinda annoyed me. So, the Godfather says, ""please serve the sour cream and butter in separate containers the way it should be.""  Other than the that, it was a good lunch under $10 and I got out of their well under and hours. Please don't mix your sour cream with butter..."
Israel R.,"Chula Vista, CA",90,4,,5.0,4/12/2016,"Great service provided by Jafer V. He was on top of everything. His manager Sean was also amazing by supervising our salad's portions and service. I used to go to Bj's in Grossmont center but now, this will be my new favorite Bj's!!! Thank you guys!!"
Laila F.,"Chula Vista, San Diego, CA",7,28,2,1.0,9/7/2016,Two Word Awful & Poor service! We order pizza & salad. Salad was prepared a day or two!!!! We waited for drinks for 45mins. We live in Eastlake & try to dine in South Bay but with service like this is hard. I rather drive to La Mesa BJ'S for better food & service.
Chely B.,"San Diego, CA",0,9,,2.0,4/6/2017,Good food bad services during happy hour . They absolutely need to hire more waiters atleast for that time of day . The lady is nice but took like 20 minutes to even give us water and 40 min for drinks . Still waiting on food .
Rebeca R.,"San Ysidro, CA",362,26,93,5.0,6/9/2016,Had a great dinner 2 for 25 w dessert we had pizza and soup w a great bazookie dessert
Danielle L.,"San Diego, CA",61,58,15,4.0,7/20/2016,Just had the best grilled cheese of my life! The bacon avocado & tomato grilled cheese but be sure to ask for the Parmesan crusted sourdough instead on the regular. It tastes just like goldfish crackers!
Jose S.,"San Diego, CA",57,128,144,5.0,8/30/2015,"Food was very good. Good selection. Staff was helpful. I recommend the triple Decker sandwich. Was the bomb dizzie.. Great kids meals selection as well such as chicken tenders, macaroni and cheese, mini hot dogs and sides such as mashed potatoes, fries, fruit, etc.. Bar and nice family environment.. Not too pricy."
Steven A.,"Corona, CA",6,1,,1.0,7/30/2016,"Came here for dinner before going to a concert and the waitress we got took forever to get our drinks, put in our order and to refill our drinks, even though the restaurant wasn't busy at all. The potato skins were lacking any flavor and had barely any toppings on it. We just had lack luster service with mediocre food. As a fan of BJ's, I was really disappointed with this location."
Nicole C.,"San Diego, CA",3,14,28,1.0,5/27/2016,DON'T GO TO THIS LOCATION I love BJ's Brewery and unfortunately this location just lacks in EVERY aspect. My friends and I gave it an honest try and have been to the Chula Vista mall location 4 separate times this year and every single time it was not worth it. The food was either wrong or cooked very poorly. We would be sat at a table and 20 min passes before anyone even asks us if we want water. One time our check was wrong and we had to send it back 4 times until finally we just had to request the manager to fix our bill because we had plans and had no more time to spare. I'm a patient person so I can wait BUT to make me wait then give me crappy food and bad service just to over charge me for all of it is NOT OK. I will NEVER return to this location and I will happily spread the word to even strangers on the street to not waste their time and hard earned money. I'd rather drive 40 min out of my way and go to a different one than waste my money on crap service one more time. Really makes me sad to have experienced this at an establishment I've always truly enjoyed.
Joe T.,"San Diego, CA",62,1693,13708,4.0,11/17/2014,I love the beer selection here.  It is pretty extensive with a lot of foreign choices.  I like you can make your own sampler set of any of the tap beers.  The burgers are pretty good.  The sliders are simple and make a great late night snack.  You get two sliders and some fries so you not completely filled up.  They come with lettuce and some pickles.  The pizookies are ok.  I am not a big fan of them.  They tasted pretty good but are really heavy on the stomach for a late night snack.  Service has been pretty good every time I have been.  They are open semi late which is nice.
Priscilla G.,"Chula Vista, CA",207,120,33,5.0,12/4/2014,"Every time I come here I leave happy, stuffed and satisfied! The employees are great, here. Very polite, respectful, and helpful. The food never takes long to come out, and the drinks are pretty damn good.  They have lunch specials, so definitely stop by here if you're looking for some lunch during the week. The appetizers are well sized. I recommend ordering the avocado egg rolls (I think that was the name, might be a bit off). They come with this sauce to dip them in and oh my, you'll not want to share any!  Enjoy :)"
Josephine C.,"San Diego, CA",62,76,68,2.0,5/8/2016,"I don't understand. This place offers what seems to look like great food and a very nice atmosphere. But for the quality of the food and service, it's just overpriced food with a lack in customer service. My $13 burger was so dry. I expected this to be a moist, mouth watering plate. But so so so overcooked. Our waiter didn't even understand the difference between adding on a salad for $3.50 and upgrading to a different side. Cmon. This places needs new management. Hostess at the front are not very welcoming at the end of a Saturday night. Look more annoyed to see you having a good time, unlike themselves."
Allie M.,"Chula Vista, CA",45,41,6,2.0,7/26/2015,"My friends and I visited this BJs on Saturday night.  We were greeted by two very nice hostesses and decided to sit in the bar. There were plenty of empty tables, however none of them were clean. We stood around for a few minutes waiting for someone to offer to clean a table for us. Servers kept walking by, but nobody offered to help us, so I went back to the hostess to ask her instead. She was very nice about it and told me she would send someone over, but nobody came. After standing in the bar for another five minutes or so without being helped, we decided to bus our own table and grab menus from other empty tables. Nobody ever apologized or offered to wipe the table that we ended up bussing ourselves. Once we sat down, everything seemed to happen in slow motion --the service definitely wasn't fast. My strawberry margarita tasted like it didn't have any alcohol in it, but the carnitas fries were SO good. They came in a mini pizza pan with fries on the bottom and all the toppings on top. The only negative experience with the food is that we didn't get silverware. I had to track down my server, and when she finally came with silverware, she only brought one set which didn't make sense because there were clearly three of us.  All in all, the carnitas fries made the experience decent, but I don't know if they are worth coming back for considering the fact that we had to bus our own table."
Mark D.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,9,,1.0,2/1/2017,"Go in with low expectations and they will still disappoint. Do yourself a favor and just hit up your local taco shop. Seriously, there are better ways to make a turd. Also, pray that anyone that rhymes *aitlyn isn't your server."
John M.,"Temecula, CA",293,451,234,2.0,5/6/2015,"I came here with my family last Saturday.  We were here late afternoon around 4pm and the place was not too busy at the time.  The young African-American woman working the hostess counter was kinda rude and sporting a nonchalant attitude as well.  None of us cared for it. We were made to feel unwelcome and if she could care less if we stayed or walked out the door.  That said, we stayed. After that encounter, we had a waitress who was unpleasant and got my drink order wrong twice.  Meanwhile, I saw her chatting it up with a fellow employee at their register work station rather then bringing me my correct drink from the bar.  About 15 minutes into our dining experience, our waitress told us that she would be leaving and a new waiter would be taking care of us from that moment forward.  We were all fine with that, no loss there whatsoever.   Our new waiter seemed to be preoccupied about something else other than his customers as well.  It was at that time that I began to notice that most ALL of the employee's were walking around the dining room area looking as if they just got their butts chewed by the Boss or they all just simply did not want to be at work that day? It was kind of a bummer because my wife and I had been at this same restaurant about a month prior and all was very good on that day. I do not know what happened or why, but what I do know is that I will not be coming back to this place.  Too many other restaurants that will least pretend to be glad that I am there while getting my cocktail order correct. I DO NOT recommend this establishment."
Jenn P.,"San Diego, CA",87,28,235,5.0,5/24/2015,"Quick bar service. Super accommodating, considerate, attentive staff. Pros Beer selection Staff Cons Sticky bar tops"
Japheth C.,"San Diego, CA",4,6,2,5.0,7/16/2015,"Came here on a Monday night, the server was very attentive. Ordered an appetizer, two drinks, two entrees, and a dessert. All of them came out at appropriate times. Server refilled the drinks without us asking and was very courteous. He even helped us bag out leftovers.  I got the quinoa chicken and spinach bowl, it was delicious. I asked for it without mushrooms, it came out perfectly and tasted amazing."
adda w.,"Los Angeles, CA",738,244,562,1.0,3/29/2014,"Great food, crappy service!!!!  When you see a empty glass of water you should refill it not serve us our appetizers and go off about your business. Sorry but if I have to ask for refills numerous time, there's a problem. Food was on point--"
Richard P.,"San Diego, CA",13,20,43,1.0,6/10/2015,"The spaghetti was overcooked so it was somewhat mushy. It had no firmness at all. As far as the marinara sauce it tasted very good but the chef did not put enough sauce so it tasted bland. Fortunately, I brought it up to my bartender who was more than happy to bring an extra side of marinara sauce which I was thankful to her for.  Afterward, I ordered the brussels sprouts. It was my first time ordering that dish. It tasted burned. However, I assumed that that was the smoky flavoring mentioned in the description. After a while though I could no longer tolerate the strong taste and I pointed it out to my bartender and I asked her if it was me or was the Brussels sprouts burned? She looked at it and thought it looked burned as well. She tested the aroma and said that it did smell burned. She brought it up to the other bartender who confirmed that it was in fact burned.  Although I was not charged for the dish, I was quite disappointed as I really like brussels sprouts. I really enjoy coming to the bar at this restaurant but this is the first time that the quality of the food was really bad. Perhaps it was because it was late, but overcooked and mushy spaghetti and burned Brussels sprouts on the same day is a bit overboard. The one star rating is for the chefs in the kitchen only and is not a reflection of the the female bartending staff who are awesome as always!"
