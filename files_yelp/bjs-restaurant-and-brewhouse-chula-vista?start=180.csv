Brian B.,"San Diego, CA",0,21,1,1.0,12/26/2015,"It's a shame. Ordered a medium burger, got well done with lettuce stems. Also ordered a cheese burger that offered BJ's personal awesome sauce, came out dry as a bone with not a lick of awesome. Manager wants to make it right and brings me a fresh new burger and witnesses an epic fail from the moment I saw the second burger hit the table, well done. Free burger but it still kinda leaves a bad taste..."
Cindy W.,"San Diego, CA",10,12,4,1.0,12/26/2015,"Terrible place. This was my second visit. We came 1 week after it opened, service and food was horrible. Had high hopes this time because they've been operating for a while, was terribly disappointed. Ordered a alcoholic root beer drink and the kale and roasted Brussels sprout salad. I was with a rather large crowd so it took awhile for the drinks to come. After everyone was served they Informed me they ran out of my drink. Then they brought the food. No kale, no Brussels sprouts, burnt chicken. They ""ran out"" of Brussels sprouts. Then they brought some to our table in order to placate us. Guess they hadn't really run out! Which means ""they lied!!!"" As a post note, they did write off the salad and I  received a seemingly heartfelt apology from the manager so maybe, just maybe there will be a third time but 3 strikes your out so we'll see."
Jordan S.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",10,114,13,4.0,8/22/2015,"Pretty good, I guess. I mean it's BJ's. The pizza is super good yes, and the pazookies will hit anyone's sweet tooth, but it's not like incredible food. Comfort food for sure. You don't need a Yelp review to hit up a BJ's."
Nick H.,"San Diego, CA",243,3,,1.0,7/14/2016,This has got to be the most worst experience I've ever had eating out I came here to enjoy dinner  and everything was terrible but great customer service
Perla C.,"Las Vegas, NV",140,112,60,5.0,3/21/2015,You have to get a pizza or a chick sand which with potato wedges. I used to live in La Mesa and I would drive here to eat(even though there was one close to my house. Service is always great!
Paul S.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,18,,5.0,6/20/2017,"ok,  this was my first time going to a bj's, and it was with my wife and coworkers for happy hour.  so, i didn't really eat that much, just their special 1/2 price mini pizza, which is not why i am giving 5 stars (it was o.k.), and i am not giving them 5 stars for their happy hour prices (to high for short pours), but i am giving bj's 5 stars, cause heather our server, was outstanding! sometimes the service can make everything seem alot better.  thanks heather."
Siyra L.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,3,2,3.0,7/8/2016,I really love Bj's for their  pan pizzas and theur amazing  pizookies but this Bj's  has terrible service. The server seemed a bit rushed and didnt seem to care about our table.
Andrea P.,"Imperial Beach, CA",79,9,64,3.0,3/14/2016,Haven't been here for years. Went with my sissy in law for dinner. Food was alright nothing special. The stuffed mushrooms were delicious tho. Looked thru the menu and realized we def have to go back for the beer. Seems like its be a good brew and appetizer kinda spot. Hope to go back and re-rate this place.
Meshell B.,"San Diego, CA",194,25,5,3.0,3/29/2015,I used to go all the time before they opened other restaurants nearby. Last time we went we sat in the bar and got a new waitress. He messed up our order 4 times.. from the alcohol beer to appetizers to the pizza. It was okay because every time he brought something out wrong he corrected it with the right thing. By time our pizza came out we were soo full and couldn't eat it.. I will be back but not anytime soon.
Emily R.,"Chula Vista, CA",14,10,12,2.0,7/1/2016,Service was to slow food was not what i expexted for what they charge i would not teconmend this place to anyone
Julissa P.,"Chula Vista, CA",45,4,,4.0,12/26/2016,"My boyfriend and I have been to this restaurant quite a few times when it's slow and everything has been awesome! No waiting time and the service is great as well. However, today I came in with my mom and sister in celebration of my mom's birthday. The restaurant was packed and looked busy. It was a 30-45 minute wait which was fine. However, we noticed that multiple people that came in after us started getting seated before us, so I went to ask when was our turn. Turns out the hostess forgot about us and did not  write my name down for a table... I didn't make a big deal about it because I understand people forget. Also, I felt bad for the hostess because one of the servers was being really rude to her. Demanding her to do her bill? Or do something for her. She was talking down on her. And I think that's not right for a co-worker to try to intimate another co-worker. So, other than that the food was great! There was a wait for the appetizer and food but once again not a big deal for me. It wasn't until there was a 30 minute wait for the dessert? Kind of made me not want it anymore. But I brought up the issue to my server and he offered to speak to the manager. It's not what I wanted of course but he did it anyways. All I wanted was an explanation. But the manager ended up taking off the dessert! Which was really nice of them to do.  To sum it up, I recommend coming during the week between 1-4pm. Seems slow during those times."
Mai W.,"San Diego, CA",33,100,74,4.0,5/19/2015,"5 stars to our server, forgot your name, sorry and the manager on duty, Drew. Docked a star because my ribeye was cold and my best friend's salad didn't come out.  Yes, there was mishaps with service/food tonight.  But most importantly, the manager was around to help the issues.  We appreciate and respect that the most from any restaurant establishment. Thanks Drew for taking care us and making sure our food got out to us."
Jojo T.,"San Diego, CA",387,108,146,2.0,1/5/2014,"Never come here during a football game or any game. I love bjs that's why I'm giving this place 2 stars but the reason why I'm not going to give it a better review is because of the service.   I know it is busy.  I know their is a lot to do. But how many times do I have to ask for a straw? I asked 4 different workers here and they would say ""yeah,  I'll be right back with it"" bit never came back with it. I had to go to the front and grab some. Really? I didn't even left a tip because they neglected my simple task."
monica m.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,30,3,2.0,5/29/2016,"Our waiter was great, unfortunately the food was bad. It  Felt like it was not a BJ's the food did not compare to the others."
Desiree H.,"Garden Grove, CA",6,29,37,4.0,5/16/2015,Food was awesome!!!! Ordered the Chicken Club. Babe ordered the Bison Burger & they exceeded my expectations. Will definitely return. Waiting on the Peanut Butter Smores Pazookie.
Marina O.,"San Diego, CA",33,24,13,1.0,2/19/2016,"I just had the the worst service I've experienced here. This had always been our go to place after work for happy hour because they had great prices on appetizers, drafts, and cocktails. That's changed, unfortunately, along with the quality of drinks and service. All I got I was sugary syrup and ice, and charged for items that were never ordered! Also, our waiter didn't really check up on us and at least 20 mins or more would go by between our drink order and delivery. We were here for about five hours! That's ridiculous when we are only a few feet from the bar. I'm very disappointed mostly because my friends and I kind of had an emotional attachment to this place. We've bonded here and have enjoyed really delicious food, but all that's gone down the drain after tonight. I've also been to the BJs at Grossmont Center with my family and the service isn't that much better. What's going on?! Food is delicious, service is ""eh"", and service recovery (when something goes wrong, it needs to be corrected) definitely needs improvement.  Story time: My mom and I came to have lunch here a while ago: There were crayons on the floor in the middle of the walkway and my mom slipped, fell, and hit her head on the floor as we were being walked to our table. She was hurt, so embarrassed and so upset that hostess didn't offer any sort of compensation. I was the one who picked up the crayons off the floor and no other staff or manager came to check up on her. We didn't even place our drink order before my mom walked out of there and she's never been back since."
Ula L.,"San Diego, CA",1,50,44,1.0,2/20/2016,"Service: SLOW AF.  For my sister and I, it took an hour and 30 minutes for our meal. We both had water to drink and two simple dinner entrees. Nothing crazy or out of the ordinary. We could never find our server, we even had to ask another server to find him.  We will never go back to this location. Even the Mission Valley location is faster than this place during lunch rush! Never again!!"
Robert F.,"San Diego, CA",0,5,,4.0,5/6/2016,Love Danielle! She's a wonderful employee and a total gem. She makes the experience even better along with great food and dessert!
Maria Jose P.,"Boston, MA",55,31,23,2.0,4/19/2015,"I took my cousin to try Pazookie and the mojito. Our server brought us our mojito all was great, until we waiting about an hour for the dessert. We caught his attention so we could cancel it because we were over it and before we could speak he says, ""do you guys want to cancel your order?"" He never put in our order! So of course we left.  Usually I have better experiences here, but then I went again last night and our server didn't come to check on us at all, never got refills. In summary service sucks here, but it tastes like every other BJ's!"
