Mel T.,"Orange, CA",1,12,23,1.0,2/21/2016,"Bad service! Food was served without silverware, napkins. No refills of drinks without having to ask, burned baked potatoe, saggy vegies, dried babyback ribs, etc, etc...what a shame! Bad all the way around!!"
Nicholas S.,"Chula Vista, CA",2,16,8,3.0,9/6/2016,"I've been to this spot numerous times but I went last Friday and it was a pretty bad experience.  First off we were seated with no silverware or napkins. We ordered our food and I got something different from what I ordered and her excuse was that both of the items were next to eachother on the menu, which they weren't.  Anywho, simple mistake I guess, she gave me the option of returning my food(which I hate doing) or eating what she brought me, in the end I had her take it back.  Then she brings the same plate back and because it was salmon and they didn't want to cook another piece of fish, gave me the plate also and said that what I had originally ordered will be made shortly.  I ended up finishing that plate before the other plate ever made it to the table...all in all I will be back but this last time I was there I was pretty bummed at the service, and then to top it all off she told me she was going to take it off the bill and then switched servers on me so she could take her break and both items were on my bill and it had to be fixed...great food, just don't order the Roasted Salmon Quinoa bowl, cuz it might be to close to the Roasted salmon dish(which it's not)"
Wana L.,"San Diego, CA",680,393,592,4.0,1/24/2011,"Customer service was four thumbs up!! Dangit, I totally forgot our server's name. I wanted to compliment her because she was sooo nice even though they were about to close.  It was the night before my bday. I wanted to  celebrate right as the hand struck midnight! There weren't many other restaurants open, so I decided to head here.  I also got a free mini chocolate chip pizzoki! It was really good. If you've never had a PiZZOKi, you're really missing out. Really! It's pretty much this huge cookie w/ice cream on top. The cookie is always moist and mouthwatering!  My bf's chicken wings were really good too. Crispy and hot off the plate! It was a great start to my bday..."
Chris H.,"San Diego, CA",214,194,93,4.0,11/15/2014,"Pretty solid after work dining option. It can get pretty crowded here, but the staff seems to keep up with it. The steaks are actually quite good- I recommend the rib eye, along with a good Hefeweizen to wash it down. The service can be disjointed at times, hence the four and not five stars, but hey- It's a themed restaurant,  not Donovans. The appetizers are quite good, and of course the beers are all tasty. This is a really good option for groups of 8 or more- They do well here with a multi - server approach, and generally get food out pretty quickly. One drawback can be limited parking at the CV Center, but it's not too bad. I recommend asking for seating in the elevated areas and not down below; it can get loud and you'll have a ton of people weaving by you to use the restrooms.  Overall, this is a great dining option post work or Christmas shopping.  Tasty!"
Bianca F.,"Lancaster, CA",20,7,2,2.0,8/2/2014,"Food was ok, pizza was kind of under cooked and way to much cheese. We had to hunt our waitress down a few times. She seemed to hair vanish when we wanted something. It took her 20 minutes to get us a refill on our drinks and another 30 min to bring us ketchup. It wasn't even busy. The girls who are supposed to get you a table ignored us for a good 15 minutes before we started to bug them about getting us a table.  Service here sucks! Kind of rude and I'll mannered.  Wont be back to this location again."
Catalina T.,"San Diego, CA",175,7,6,3.0,2/22/2015,"Swung by on a Friday night with my mom, the restaurant was pretty packed but we didn't wait long at all. After we got seated our server showed up promptly but he never introduced himself, something we believed was very critical for the customer service experience. We got the shrimp lettuce wraps for appetizers and they were just alright. Nothing special really, the shrimp was a little dry for our liking so we left more than half of the dish. I got the Moroccan spiced salmon that did not impress me at all. The salmon was actually well cooked and flavorful, it was just the sauce that threw me off. I always order the same thing when I go to BJ's, I think I'll just stick with that. My mom got the jalapeño burger but with a veggie pattie instead and I think I ate more of her food than mine. That was a damn good burger! Despite the fact of not introducing himself, our server was good. He was attentive and treated us nicely. I just give three starts because the food did not satisfy us."
Reynaldo R.,"Spring Valley, CA",19,61,19,2.0,12/20/2015,The service was so slow. When we arrived it took 13 minutes for someone to even bring us menus. There was about 6 people sitting at the bar and 7 people sitting in the bar area. Once we were acknowledged menus and drinks came quickly. The second round of drinks was again slow they seem to be zig zagging and it just turned out that I was on the other side of the zig zag. The food was ok. Ended up with a 90 dollar bill I definitely would go somewhere else for this amount of money.
Dina M.,"San Diego, CA",9,12,10,2.0,11/1/2015,"If you're prepared to wait awhile come here. I've given this place many chances since I live here in CV, but dang if they don't burn me every time. If the food was amazing it might be worth it, but it's only mediocre, and like TI says, I don't want no mediocre."
Lili K.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",0,14,2,4.0,3/20/2015,I you are looking for a place to have a good time. This is the place.  You can have some nice drinks and good food. you can ask for Joe and he will make you feel like a $1000000 super star. I always go on Fridays.  Best of luck
Ryan B.,"San Diego, CA",190,4,,5.0,3/2/2016,"Great food, great service. If you're in need of a satisfying beer or a sweet treat, this is the place to eat. A Tatonka Stout and Monkey Bread Pizookie will definitely quench your cravings."
Kara P.,"San Diego, CA",320,400,1579,3.0,4/11/2013,"Pyramid apricot if your feeling girly. Kinda like a peachy Blue Moon. $4.95 Kids Captain Crunch French Toast is the must order for the little ones.  Opens at 10am on Sunday.  They have an excellent Sunday Brunch.  We come here to escape the over 1 hour wait in Eastlake at Broken Yolk, Cheesecake factory, and IHOP after church Sunday rush brunch.  It is empty on a Sunday morning and it's perfect for a large group.   I highly recommend the Breakfast Pizza, something unique & filling.  It's enough to share with 3 adults.  HUGE portion.  It's unique and  so heavy that the thin crust will bend over since it can't support the toppings of bacon, sausage, cheese, ham, tomato, & mozzarella.  Bust out the knife and fork for that slice."
Adnan F.,"Chula Vista, CA",117,184,177,5.0,12/15/2015,Andre one of their servers really great at what he does their I usually go once to twice a month and this was my best visit . They have a great variety of food and real good .
Mollie N.,"Chula Vista, CA",212,77,357,1.0,5/28/2015,"I come to this BJ's location fairly frequently, and yesterday's service is the WORST I have received here. Arrived at 2:40 PM.  Light customer load, enough waitstaff and hostesses present. Placed order for a party of 2 in the dining area. Order = stuffed baked potato (potatoes are already baked, only need warmed and toppings put on) and soup with salad.  Very easy order to prepare and serve, wouldn't you agree? Waited 25 minutes for our pre baked potato, pre made soup and lettuce.   Our waitress was more concerned with walking around as slow as a snail, talking with other staff, cashing out previous checks, taking new orders at other tables but only delivering drinks No napkin/silverware delivered, at all.  My friend had to go to the hostess to get it. I saw our waitress watching this happen, but she made no attempt to approach our table.  A DIFFERENT waiter brought out the soup and salad, but no baked potato.   I asked him to please bring it as it was missing from the order, and to place the potato in a carryout container. He agreed and brought it to the table immediately.  Not sure why he could bring that out so quickly in a to-go container versus a plate with the rest of the order so I could eat it, but whatever. Waitress never checked on us, but walked past our table several times. Stopped the waitress and asked for our check.  That was the only thing she brought promptly. My friend asked for another bowl of salad (since it is of course, all-you-can-eat soup and salad).  Waitress agreed but was perturbed. No salad came out.  Ever.  I watched her the entire time from my friend's request for more.  Instead, she did other things. My friend asked for a to-go container.  Though we were within 20 feet of a server's station with to-go containers in the cabinet, our waitress went to other areas of the restaurant (but not other customers, just other areas).  Never to return again...until my friend went to the hostess to ask for a to-go container and the hostess went straight to the server's station near us and gave one to my friend.  ONLY then, did our waitress come out from wherever, but NOT to our table...oh no...but to the hostess stand to loudly complain to the hostess how we were bad customers, wanting too many things. (Ahem..not too much to ask for when we ask for silverware, the missing part of our order, our check, another helping of all-you-can-eat salad and a to-go container.  I didn't know that was beyond what a customer should request?  And we never even asked for our food while waiting 25 minutes...thought we were pretty patient about that.) Still no second helping of salad anywhere to be found.   Our waitress never walked to the kitchen once.  I kept my eyes on her the entire time since my friend's order. So we got up to leave (yes, we paid our promptly-brought bill) and our waitress saw us, and still made no attempt to move toward us from the server station at the back of the restaurant.  But, she DID manage to give us the stink-eye as we were leaving. So gracious of her. At least the cold soup and the room temperature salad still had some taste to it."
Dean D.,"Chula Vista, CA",1,17,,1.0,8/3/2015,"(6) of us had dinner there Monday 6:00 p.m. 8/3/15.  Not crowded.  Ordered salads/sandwiches.  Food came in (3) waves.  (4, then 1, then the last one).  So we waited.  I finally flagged down a waitress serving another section and asked that my wives meal be canceled.  Her meal was finally (flatbread) served when several of our party had finished, and others had almost finished.  They did not charge us, but I believe a restaurant should know that the whole table will wait for the last meal, so why can't they execute a simple task of all food prepped and delivered???  My salad was below average.  Not quite fresh, but not spoiled.  I have 100's of choices, so sorry I chose this place.  Obvious very poor management.  Save yourself the aggravation and go to any nearby restaurant where they can execute basic service and place a decent meal in front of you and your family."
Ana Maria B.,"San Diego, CA",6,16,5,1.0,10/5/2014,"My first time at this place and what a disappointment. The appetizers and drinks were fine, but the main courses were a disaster. We ordered two pastas, which were so bland, no salt no nothing. One we sent it back, the other was hardly touched. My daughter ordered the Scallops,  there did not smell fresh, they were like boiled, bland and awful. The dish came with asparagus,  which, not only were super skinny and limp but also came with the tuff uncut hard stocks. Never again!"
Blayne P.,"Chula Vista, CA",3,13,,3.0,1/3/2015,"The cool thing about BJ's is that for some reason no one comes for there ""weekend Brunch"". And its pretty good and really fair pricing. Good for kids too. The breakfast basics are executed skillfully and the ingredients seem to be of decent quality.  Coming here sure beats waiting at IHOP for an hour or going to Broken Yolk and getting bad food or bad service! * I wish they had more of a local craft beer selection..."
Kassi S.,"Issaquah, WA",133,129,78,3.0,5/9/2014,"I came here on the suggestion of a friend the first time and have been back again since then. I have only tried their deep dish pizzas, but my husband had their top sirloin as well. The deep dish pizzas are DIVINE; that's the truth! On the other hand, their prices and the attitudes of the waitresses are the exact opposite. THE GOOD: Yes, the deep dish pizzas are to die for. They are baked to perfection with large amounts of toppings and the crust gets to the perfect crispy goodness. THE BAD: Expect to pay $14 for a personal pizza and upwards of $20+ for a small, mediocre piece of steak. THE OTHER BAD: The service and attitudes of the waitresses were crummy both times that I've been here. I understand that you're busy and don't really care about me, but if I ask you what's your favorite dish between my two picks or I ask you how your day has been going, please don't roll your eyes or huff and puff because I'm asking your opinion or just making small talk. I also understand that people have off days and some days just plain suck, but until the person who waits us is not in a standoff mood, I'm leaving my review as three stars. Chances are, I'll continue to come back to BJ's regardless of the wait staff and the price... Those deep dish pizzas are worth it. **TIP: Last time we came in, they offered us a rewards card. Kind of like Red Robin's reward program, each dollar you spend at BJ's you earn 1 point. They culminate until you have a certain amount and you can get a % off your ticket, free dessert, etc, etc, etc. Worth it if you go here more than two times probably. **"
Alyssa M.,"San Diego, CA",2,17,26,5.0,7/2/2014,Love coming here to celebrate events with a large group of people! They're really good at accommodating large parties. I never had any problems with their service. The food is always on point. The place is always packed so make sure to have a reservation before dining here.
Ashley O.,"San Diego, CA",0,8,,5.0,1/26/2016,Service was extremely friendly and accommodating! Thank junior!!  Definitely coming back!
Alex S.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,10,5,1.0,8/19/2015,"Before I continue, I want to let everyone reading this know that my review is strictly for the BJ's in Chula Vista. I have visited many BJ's and I love the food. However, this one was completely off. First of all, when I walked in, I was not greeted was not asked How many people. When I approached and reception table the lady completely ignored me and I don't know if she wrote anything down or even know we even existed. Once seated at the table. It was 20 mins before any waiter came and greeted our table. (I was about to walk out). Our waiter was completely rude and unprofessional. We had to ask 3 maybe 4 times just to get our drinks and silverware. Now for the food. Like I have said before, BJ's food is awesome. But we had orders two soups and I asked For mine in a bread bowl. My boyfriend and I got the same soup and and there was a night and day difference between ours soups. Mine was warm, steamy and good. His was luke warm and you can tell it had been siting out. We asked to get a new one and they took it back and when brought a ""new one"" it was probably the same one. Lastly, when we were paying we put our gift card of $30 and then a $20 bill to finish it off. For a person that works in food industry one should know to take the money from the gift card and then the cash. NOoope. They took the cash first then the card. We got $7 back on the card... We asked the waiter why he did the transaction that way. And he couldn't give us a reason. When we asked to re do the transaction. He said he couldn't. Sooo we were very upset and will not be returning to this BJ's"
