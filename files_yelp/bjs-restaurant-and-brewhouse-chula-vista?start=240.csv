Cesar v.,"Chula Vista, CA",44,47,23,3.0,7/21/2014,Long waiting period. Besides that cool waitress.  The food is too pricey for the quality
Catherine C.,"San Diego, CA",73,49,55,1.0,8/30/2014,"This has to be the worst BJ's in Southern California at the very least. We have never come here and had an incident free meal. Each time something is wrong. The pizza is always under cooked. The staff are not knowledgable. Last time we asked what beers were on tap and the waiter said to order the BJ brews because they were cheaper and never told us the other options. When we asked a second time, a different waiter came by and said the same thing. We eventually just walked to the bar ourselves. Same time, I order pizza with black olives and mushrooms and I get a pizza with kalamata olives and red onion. He asked if I wanted it and I said no thank you. When the bill came they charged us for BOTH PIZZAs the mistake and the corrected one."
Jaime K.,"Chula Vista, CA",8,1,,1.0,8/1/2014,"I'm not sure what was worse , our server or the pizza.  I have never had a bad experience at BJS ......but this was bad enough for me to create a Yelp just to review."
Mary Ann C.,"San Diego, CA",452,260,1776,4.0,6/14/2012,"Hm..  Come to think of it, I have never actually chosen to come eat here.  It's always been at the request of whomever I'm hanging out with.   Definitely a step above any 2 for $20 establishments.  BJ's offers a casual ambiance and a great affordable variety of appetizers, entrees and desserts. I have had a few dishes here and haven't been disappointed yet.  Great place to hang out and have a few drinks and watch some sports (not sure about fights or UFC), or an intimate celebration.   Customer service isn't the best that's for sure.  But with that being said, isn't the worst either. :)"
Amy G.,"San Diego, CA",1,14,27,4.0,11/23/2015,Food is always good service sometimes a little slow but overall a decent place. I give it 4 stars for the food-not the service.
Sebastian R.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,26,2,2.0,3/22/2014,"This place went downhill.  Its fine for sitting at the bar and having a beer, but we will never sit down to eat again.  I got the jalapeno burger and requested medium cook, it came out beyond done and was cold and basically lacking flavor.  For 12 bucks this was a disgrace! My wife got a brussel sprout and kale salad, that arrived with absolutely no brussel sprouts or kale...we had to send it back.  It was nice that the manager came out and delivered the salad and apologized, but by this point we were not very impressed."
Shayna R.,"San Diego, CA",20,116,24,3.0,9/1/2014,"I've been back a few times and it has been decent. Like I don't even have anything to expand on really -- not horrible, not amazing. Specific to my very last visit, however (last night), I got the little stem nubbin in my avocado eggroll AGAIN. This happens pretty regularly. Who prepares those things? They realize the stem nubbin is hard and unpleasant to accidentally chew, right?"
Samantha T.,"Chula Vista, CA",142,14,4,5.0,10/2/2015,"So grateful for a local business who is willing to invest in the community. CYT thanks you, BJs. They took such good care of us tonight. Thanks Jennifer & George. #iceontheside"
Garlic D.,"Chula Vista, CA",70,7,1,5.0,12/15/2015,"Thank you Demi for serving myself and my coworkers today. You did a phenomenal job. Everyones food was picture perfect. We did not have to wait for any refills, condiments or drinks. I really enjoyed the bacon brisket burger. The nice beginnings were a great way to keep us entertained until our food arrived. You and Jen really exceeded our expectations and it made one of our Marines going away event a good time for us all. Thank you."
Amanda C.,"San Diego, CA",4,28,9,5.0,1/10/2016,"I come here once every few months and am never disappointed in their service or food. I always get seated right away and the hostesses at the front are always friendly. Last night was no exception. Our server was awesome and gave us good recommendations. We always get the avocado egg rolls to start. Last night I also tried the cherry chipotle salmon with couscous and brussel sprouts, which exceeded my expectations. I'll definitely be coming back just to have that dish, hopefully they keep it on the menu for good!  Family friendly place, but also good for date nights or meeting up with friends."
Elizabeth A.,"Chula Vista, CA",50,132,109,1.0,3/23/2014,"I went back to BJ's despite my hit or miss experiences there before. I started with a side salad. The salad looked good at first glance, but as I ate, it was clear the lettuce was going bad and the edges were browning. Next up I had a mini Great White deep dish pizza. I have had this pizza on several occasions and at the La Jolla location, and this was the worst I've ever had. The pizza was luke warm, the crust was still doughy, and the chicken tasted as if it were over cooked in a microwave. I've had frozen meals better than that.  My mother had the new lobster tacos. Somehow they managed to miss the mark with that as well. The lobster tasted rubbery, among the lack of fresh ingredients on the taco, the store bought flour tortillas, and the runny ""guacamole."" She said it was bland and salty. She would have rather had tacos at Rubio's for a third of the price and made correctly. I used to like going to BJ's, but it seems they have really gone downhill. What a shame."
Mel B.,"San Diego, CA",372,414,773,4.0,11/7/2012,"Came by last Thursday because BWW was packed!  My family and I wanted to watch the Chargers game but the wait at Buffalo Wild Wings was re-donky-lous!  We ended up here by default.   Wait wasn't too bad.  It was about 15 mins prior to arrival.  We asked if they were serving Happy Hour menu and the waiter told us since the bar area was packed, we would be able to order from the HH menu.  Normally you can only order HH at the bar.  That was a bonus! We ordered a mini BJ's favorite pizza, avocado rolls, calamari, buffalo wings, some kind of salad, cheeseburger.  Even ordered a pizookie w/vanilla ice cream for dessert.  The calamari was a bit too greasy and the buffalo wings were just okay.  Everything was about average.  Service was also up to par.  The waiter was pretty attentive. The food here is better than the La Mesa branch.  Is that possible?  Only thing that sucks about this place is they don't play the sound of the TV.  But, we did get to watch the Chargers!"
Rachelle B.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,26,4,1.0,5/16/2015,"Went here with a group of friends (8 people total) for dinner because typically BJ's in general has not disappointed.  That is, until this visit.  We waited so long for the waitress to come back to our table after bringing our water that we ordered appetizers, entrees and dessert in case she again didn't come back.  The appetizers came out nearly thirty minutes later and the avocado in the Avocado Egg Rolls had been sitting under the heat lamp for so long it was actually completely brown, rather than the fresh green.  Needless to say, the service was far below any type of standard of acceptable and the food sitting in the back, including our entrees reflected the waiting we experienced at our table.  I will be sure to warn my friend and family to avoid this establishment!"
John V.,"Houston, TX",140,157,130,4.0,7/16/2014,"BJ's lunch is one of the best deals out there.  They offer 3 buck drafts of a good beer selection and plenty of lunch specials. On this trip I had the BJs Barbecue Plate which comes with a pull pork slider and a barbecue chicken breast with a side of wedges and cole slaw.  Now the food wasn't the best, but the serving size and cheap beer made up for it.  You can be out the door for under 10 bucks with a meal that make you think twice about needing to eat dinner. Stay sexy fellow Yelpers!"
Stephanie O.,"Chula Vista, CA",1,66,49,2.0,8/24/2015,"Horrible service. Okay food. Delicious pizookie. Hostess seated us soon after we arrived and left us with menus. We sat and waited for our server for nearly 15 minutes. She came once to get the drinks, take the order, give us the check, total of three times. She'd ask if we were doing okay, wouldn't even let us answer when she'd be walking away."
Dorothy P.,"Chula Vista, CA",43,16,,3.0,12/8/2015,"We had been to BJ's twice before and thought it was outstanding. We were disappointed this time. We had steak and shrimp in sauce. The steak was okay, the sauce was good, but it had 5 of the smallest shrimp I've ever seen. I will say the pizookie desert was excellent. We'll go back again."
Joanna M.,"Pico Rivera, CA",45,23,4,5.0,6/6/2015,"Never disappoints me, always great food, good service. My boyfriend and i had a great time, its always the spot to come for dinner while visiting family here in chula vista. Plus great location!"
Maria B.,"National City, CA",0,2,1,4.0,12/2/2015,Loved the salmon. Great waiters and the manager was super nice. I think fernando the manager was super nice. Loved the mojitos!!!
Whitney A.,"Chula Vista, CA",3,38,74,3.0,8/30/2015,"This Bjs seems to always be short staffed when I come in. They definitely need more help at this location! But on to positive reviews Bjs is a great restaurant whether your looking for pasta, pizza, chicken, ribs, salads or just looking to have drinks they have got you covered. Great portion sizes and it's very affordable! I love this place!"
Doug D.,"San Diego, CA",3,30,7,5.0,8/26/2015,"In simple capsule form...WOW! This is turning into one of my favorite spots. The service staff is spot on and the food consistently very good. What sets it apart is Jennifer, the General Manager who is as professional as they come. She was kind enough to sit down today with my son and me. We talked about food a little bit and she showed me some phone applications that makes BJ's stand out. I appreciated her time. She's precious. I'm a former Food & Beverage Director in San Diego and Las Vegas and if I was still in the business Jennifer would be working with me. I guarantee that.  :)  We will be back soon."
