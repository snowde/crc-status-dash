Malia H.,"Imperial Beach, CA",134,96,57,2.0,12/10/2013,"These motherfuc#&@$! Now, if I have to start off a review like this then you know its all bad.  Our waiter is Marlon, hes cool, a brotha from anotha motha so hes more laid back not the hustle type (hustle as in fast not hustler), But hes not the reason for the bad review. He should probably work at a smoke shop or somewhere that a little hustle is not a job requirement.  The poor review is for the effing bs ""policy"" on not telling customers about a special. If I sit here and order a pizza and two salads you'd think the waiter would say oh thats a special we have and includes a desert for $20.00 (I read the special here on yelp after already placing my order). I asked Marlon about it and he smiled and said, ""yeah we have that special"" I said , "" its not on your menu and you didnt mention it"" he said im not supposed to. WTF marlon get outta my face with that bs! So im gonna pay full price cuz you cant tell me about a special? Now good thing i dont do drugs cuz if this was a drug deal it wouldve went down and went down bad. Smh.  In addition to that bs when the hostess sat us down she tried to sit us at a booth that was full of dirty dishes. I said to her ""youre not blind, are you?"" No, im not she said. Good so sit us where the table is clean, please :: :eyeroll::: If It was ok to just go around smacking people who work in retaurants that are idiots instead of yelping them, shed get the pimp slap! Black and blue flatbread pizza was yummy, friends country fried chicken lacked flavor. Stupid people can ruin good food."
Marisol M.,"San Diego, CA",1,27,3,1.0,2/27/2016,I didn't like the food here I ordered the chicken alfredo it was still undercooked no flavor. I wouldn't come here again or recommend this place to anyone.
Fred P.,"San Diego, CA",16,27,18,1.0,11/7/2013,"I have been trying to give this place a chance for a few years.  Used to always go here with friends and family.  If they can get their management and service right, the food is actually pretty good. However, service and management is HORRIBLE!!  The last time we were there, (Thursday Night after 9pm) we had a group of 7.  We had to ask 3 people to find out who our waiter was going to be after sitting there for 20 minutes without anyone acknowledging us.  Then, we get a young waiter with an attitude.  When he was told to come to our table, we watched him take his time and chat with Coworkers and come to our table when he was good and ready. After that, it was just all downhill.  I'll never come to this place again and I'll make sure to tell all my friends and family not to. Management or Ownership needs to get a clue.  You have a Buffalo Wild Wings that just moved in right next to you and if BJ's is not careful, this place is gonna hand them their packing papers."
Gina R.,"Chula Vista, CA",1,30,,5.0,9/14/2015,"My favorite local sports bar, cold beer, delicious food. Great staff"
Claudia C.,"La Jolla, CA",22,388,427,3.0,9/4/2012,"There is nothing wrong with the food or the restaurant itself, but there is no wow factor either. You can go and stop going for five years and the menu will still be the same. As far as choices, they are broad. I personally do not like their pizzas at all, I always have the chopped salad-pretty big portion and decent flavor. Of course, the redemming fact about this place is their pizzokie.....I loove the white chocolate macadamia!!! Love it! I wish I didnt have to share , but it is like a billion calories, so you must. lol.  BJs is a safe bet for a quite family dinner-nothing more Ahh they are also good managing large groups"
Japen G.,"Anaheim, CA",182,402,559,1.0,9/16/2013,"When the Address of this location is wrong on Yelp, you know it's a precursor to all things wrong! First is first... I don't think its too much to ask for when our orders are being taken, that the server would take their time and not rush.  Rush in way that they completely disregarding taking the drink order of someone and when we tried to call him back he couldn't hear.  STRIKE ONE! One thing I was craving for going to eat at BJs, a deep dish cheeseburger pizza.  Mind you, this was at 7pm on a Sunday evening.  The first blow was that they tell us that they ran out of deep dish pizza!!!  Umm... really, you ran out of something that you are quite known for.  So they try to make us feel better by telling us that they will give us 2 large regular pizzas since we ordered a large deep dish that was half and half.  Fine, it felt like a good enough compensation but that was STRIKE TWO! Then came the shift change.  I am never a fan of shift change.  Service would always drop 50% during a shift change.  No strike here, just dislike that one fact. So when it came time for dessert, another thing that we were craving for.  We ordered a pizookie that was split half and half chocolate chip cookie and their new flavor oreo.  Well, guess what, the ""temporary"" server came back after about 5 minutes to tell us that they ran out of chocolate chip cookie.  Are you serious... was the look on our faces when our ""temporary"" server told us.  What can we do, we went with another flavor.  Red Velvet cookie.  STRIKE THREE!  They should be out by now, but wait..... So here is the icing on top of the already Three Strike cake.  I don't know, but in every restaurant that I've pretty much been to, when you order dessert, its a given assumption that everyone in the Table would share.  Well our table had 5 people but we got 4 spoons.  So we waved our server to ask for another spoon.  Would you believe that his response to us was ""we ran out of small spoons and they had to put a load in the wash"".  So we looked at the spoons that he gave us, 2 small dessert spoons and 2 soup spoons.  Did they go to San Diego zoo to borrow the monkeys that's running / managing this location??? That's 4 STRIKES for this place. To Management:  Please tell me if you were sitting in our booth and was given the excuses and service we were given, would YOU like it??!?!  If you tell me yes, I will shake your hand because I would like to congratulate you for being an idiot. I rarely give 1 stars.  But this was just ridiculous!"
Lindsey B.,"Chula Vista, CA",12,119,109,2.0,6/2/2015,"Our server was very friendly, but the beer glasses were warm which is a bummer and we sat for ose to 10 months before being greeted. I ordered the soup and salad combo for my meal and was kind of disappointed that they brought it our right away. My food sat for at least 15 minutes while waiting for the rest of my family to get their food. By the time they received their food my soup wasn't hot anymore. Overall not a great experience."
Lisa D.,"Chula Vista, CA",129,138,44,4.0,3/28/2015,Sometimes this place I think is great and other times not so much. Its really a hit and miss. The first time was amazing. The second was alright and the third was great. Now just experiencing the 4th time I'm on the fence. I think it really depends on the day that you go and who is in the kitchen. We always get the corn fritters however this time there was very little garnish with the sauce and it wasn't as great. I'm always trying out different things on the menu and we love the atmosphere more than anything.
Howard R.,"San Diego, CA",22,5,,1.0,10/26/2013,"I love BJ's. Unfortunately, I have bad news to report about this particular location. First off, while eating our appetizer's, the server spilled a drink all over my wife's lap. He apologized profusely so I didn't give it a second thought at the time.  We moved over two tables because a couple had just departed from the table next to us and it hadn't been cleaned off yet.  After the staff cleaned up the mess that the drink made, they left the wet towels along with the dishes of the departed guest on that table the entire time we were there eating. My wife had the Cajun chicken pasta and I had the chili stuffed potato.  The food was good, but again here we are looking at the wet towels and dirty dishes while we are eating. When the check came, I was amazed that they didn't give us a discount for the problems we had to deal with.  The result of all of it was a $0.00 tip.  We won't be going back to this location."
Tangerine R.,"Spring Valley, CA",1,26,14,5.0,7/2/2015,"I love the value they offer on the lunch menu. The service here is amazing! Well managed and fast, efficient and friendly. Cory was our server today and he was quick and anticipated our needs during the entire visit. I love this place!"
Lashay W.,"San Diego, CA",1,24,15,1.0,8/23/2015,"BJ's is my favorite restaurant, however this location is not my favorite. Customer service needs work, their pazookie never disappoints but their food at this location can be a hit or miss. We come here because it's closer to our house but we seem to receive better service and the quality of food is a huge difference at the La Mesa location. I asked for a fork, the first waitress who wasn't our original waitress (she was serving our food) told me their weren't any and all they had were plastic forks. Our waitress (who has been serving us all night) came to our table with a fork and butter knife wrapped inside the napkin. Once I opened it I was in total disgust and in disbelief of what I saw! There was food on the fork as if it's never been cleaned! Whoever is reading this, please take the time to look at your silverware and not just BJ's but any restaurant! We were so grossed out we asked to use plastic forks. The manager came to our table and said ""I heard there was a dirty utensil, can I see it? I'll talk to my bus boy"" and that was it! Will definitely be contacting corporate TOMORROW!"
Lisa P.,"San Diego, CA",57,3,,1.0,5/19/2016,"My first time eating at this location, and will DEFINITELY be my last! A few friends and myself went to have a nice dinner. We ordered an appetizer and also our dinner. 25 minutes later we are served our food, which is typical wait time in a good restraunt for your dinner, and this is why you order appetizers...which arrived after our food was served. I ordered a med rare top sirlion, and I received a med well-well. I asked if they could please remake my steak, med well was not what I ordered. When our food was first brought out, I asked for steak sauce which was never brought until after my remade steak was brought out, which took an additional 20. My friends had all finished their meals by this this, and our waiter apologized and said my steak would be taken off our ticket. I asked for more silverware as the first set went back with the first steak, and the waitress again, never brought silverware, I had to use my friends. At the end of this horindous ordeal, I was still charged for my steak. I was actually charged for 2 steaks and one was taken off and when I asked the waiter why, she had told me I wouldn't be charged for it...her reply was yes, they took off the one I sent back...did they really expect me to pay for one they had to remake for their mistake??? I could understand if the service was so poor because they were busy or short staffed but definitely not the case!!! As I patiently waited for my meal the second time, I watched 5 employees, including the manager,work together at 1 table doing closing work, (which was 3 hours before they close) as in rolling the dinnerware setups, etc., while ignoring their customers, which should be #1. REALLY!!! GET IT TOGETHER PEOPLE!!!"
Kay B.,"Imperial Beach, CA",135,19,3,2.0,5/31/2015,"I've eaten here three times. Today we had the pleasure of being served by Junior. He took so long getting our drink orders that most of us went to the bar. at which point he then he preceded to ignore or be rude to the people who didn't order alcohol through him. He also took forever long getting each portion of our meal competed: currently we've been waiting to pay for 45 minutes. Good news, the food is always reliably tasty. Bad news, you can count on running the risk of having the worst server in the house every time you dine"
Capitain M.,"Chula Vista, CA",10,26,3,2.0,9/13/2015,Way to expensive for what the provide. Service is good food is crap!! Food is way to expensive and so are the drinks. The bartenders need to take some classes on making drinks and maybe chefs need to take classes on making food. Waiters are cool though
Frankie M.,"Chula Vista, CA",6,319,133,3.0,4/20/2015,"Give them 3-stars for the salads and the pizzas.  They are really good tasting.  Atmosphere is pretty cool, but can get loud during game times."
Heidi N.,"San Diego, CA",32,30,24,4.0,4/16/2015,Great place for grabbing lunch or dinner with friends or coworkers. The menu has a nice selection and the waiters are all friendly and theservice and food is really good.
Jermaine C.,"San Diego, CA",0,2,1,1.0,7/29/2015,Worst service ever. Waited 30min before service came to our attention. Ppl were rude. If I had not been with family I would have cussed ppl out. Fuck this place. Smh... Waiters and waitress suck
Dave M.,"San Diego, CA",286,83,203,3.0,6/22/2011,"WARNING: The most unoriginal Yelp review. As many BJs there are here near me, I've never been to one. (Chel R) It was my first time here (Brian B) Connected to one of the crapiest malls in San Diego, still manages to gather a crowd.  (Adel O) Not a bad place to come with a group of people (Anya D) Surely not the location for a quiet, romantic dinner, but fantastic for dining out with buddies. (Jason C) I had dinner here (Joanne A) It's a nice atmosphere with good food... I love how their menu has printed calories for the health conscious. The ""light"" menu options are the best I've seen in any restaurant (Joyce M) Oh the menu! Over twelve pages of items to choose from.  (Angela C) When looking for a variety - BJ's is the place. (Chris G) the food choice is satisfying... ordered the jambalaya which was delicious... our server Fernando definitely earned his tip (eLaine f) Jambalaya was bomb... is spicy (Marc L) This place is pretty good. (Joanna A) I love the layout (and there's a Jamba Juice, Panera, and Starbucks right next door!)... Boo for no patio sitting tho! (Alyssa G) Big and spacious! Overall good experience, service was good. (Jojo B) Great place to go for decent prices and decent meals. (Kyxie D) Despite negative reviews (Ryan B) Hopefully you will get good service... Beer! They have beers from all around the world. (Jason W) I will come back here again for Happy Hour (Juje J) I would love to rate them a 5 star, but  (Ace D) I give 3 stars (Edwin O) That is all. (Chris P) Yup pretty much what everybody else said!"
becca s.,"Chula Vista, CA",126,80,87,1.0,9/7/2013,"2nd time coming to this place & I will not be back!  Service- although the waitresses are sweet, they don't know the menus, therefore, can't make recommendations. Food lacks flavor, slow...sloooooow service. Just all around messy. Bummer! Chula Vista, we need some amazing restaurants!"
Chad T.,"Key West, FL",78,16,36,4.0,5/18/2015,"Definitely a good spot to come to for their happy hour, good craft beers and happy hour food selection! Good ambience and a nice bar!"
