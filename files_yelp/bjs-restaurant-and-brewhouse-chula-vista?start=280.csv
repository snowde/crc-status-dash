Jon M.,"Aiea, HI",0,15,8,1.0,8/9/2013,"OHH Holly crap this place is freaking slow!!!  Me and 3 friends showed up at 5:45pm for dinner.  We planned on catching a 730pm movie.  We thought this would be enough time to have dinner and be at the theater just after 7pm.  Good lord we should have arrived at 5pm. Freakin thing about it, the place wasn't that busy!!  Especially for the amount of staff working!!  Absolutely ridiculous! I've been to a BJ's in Norcal and experienced similar service.  I'll pass BJ's up regardless of where it is.  The food was good once i got it, however, It's not worth the wait.  Go somewhere else"
Nydia F.,"Costa Mesa, CA",6,5,,1.0,6/24/2013,"Extremely long wait! Wait for a table, wait for drinks n wait for food. For a family friendly restaurant, that's a no no! We had to wait 25minutes to receive a table when there were many empty tables. I asked if they were short staffed and they said yes, but waiters are clocking in as they had to wai a few hours before clocking in. The management of this BJs was clearly unorganized throughout. Never go there if you want to leave in under 1.5 hours. One positive is that the food was great as always, but not worth the wait."
Carolyn S.,"Chula Vista, CA",65,25,67,3.0,4/6/2015,"Love the 3 to 7 Happy Hour here. Different selection, food and drink for $3,4,5 & 6 dollars. We had four plates and two drinks for $35! Only place to get 6.00 drinks!! The food is good, love the avocado rolls!"
Carlene R.,"San Diego, CA",107,384,565,3.0,7/2/2011,"I have been to BJ's numerous of times and I am surprised I have not wrote a review about this place.   Appetizers   3/5 My favorite appetizer is their avocado egg rolls.  These appetizers are a bit sinful because their main ingredient is avocado and it is fried.  It's kind of like biting into deep fried avocados in the Del Mar Fair, but with more flavor. Pizza   3/5 I know the deep dish pizza is mediocre compared to the ones in Chicago, but these pizzas are all right.  My favorite is the Mediterranean and the Sweet Pig. Pizookie   5/5 I usually get the white macadamia nut or the double chocolate, but I guess all of the pizookies are all worth it.   Beer  4/5 My personal favorite is the Nutty Brewnette and the Harvest Hef because I like nutty and wheat tasting beer.  I have yet to try the Jeremiah Red.  I don't like the Nit Wit.  It has an unusual after taste.  However, if you do like a citrus taste with a weird after taste, then get this beer.   Service   3/5 Service is a hit or a miss.  Sometimes the waiter or waitress will be attentive to your needs.  Other times they will only visit you four or five times (get drinks, take your order; say, ""How is everything?"" and give the bill) or ignore you for the whole night.  I like going to BJ's on the weekdays late at night because it is open seating near the bar and the service is better."
Dana M.,"San Diego, CA",1,15,,1.0,5/30/2013,"Honestly, I've never had a worse restaurant experience. Tonight was my birthday dinner with my family- my fiancé's parents met my grandparents for the first time- I wasn't expecting excellence being a party of 9, but this dis-service was extraordinary.  Thus, prompting me to create a yelp account.  Our server was, Corina. She struggled with a thick accent, but that was the least of her pitfalls. When our order started to arrive on the table she was MIA,  for 20 minutes thereafter, MIA. When the food arrived by unpleasant food runners, our meals were shlepped in front of us. Side dishes almost sliding off our plates- Such a turn off.    Finally, a manager came over and settled our outstanding requests for missing meals, steak sauce, and drink refills. He was very helpful. But when our dinner had been sitting 20 minutes already, it was too little, too late. I was really embarrassed.  Thankfully, my family just laughed it off and didn't make a public scene. The manager comp'ed our dessert, but I felt the punishment outweighed the reward in this instance. We won't be coming back."
Anne M.,"San Diego, CA",22,175,11,3.0,1/12/2014,"I grew up in a part of the country where there are no BJ's.  I've known about BJ's for about 10 years but never patronized it because based on the name and logo, I thought it was a divey diner type of place (seriously, they need a new logo.) My husband suggested BJ's as we were looking for a place to eat before going to a movie and there was a 40 minute wait at Chili's and Buffalo Wild Wings looked crowded.  Once inside I realized it was neither diner nor divey.  This place is almost like the cheesecake factory, but less elaborate.  It's a ""Nicer"" chain with massive menu. We got a seat at a booth and got great service.  Our appetizer/fried food was pretty tasty, although the portions could have been a bit larger for the price.  On our second visit we sat in the bar area and had horrible service.  On the second visit I got an entree which was really bland and disappointing. Not impressive enough to return. The BJ's beers were okay, but nothing to write home about.  Overall an average experience."
Andria S.,"San Diego, CA",109,64,37,2.0,11/23/2014,"First time here. Only place local showing the football game I wanted to see. The place was not busy at 10:30am and service was slow. Ordered the French Toast combo, was good except for our eggs were not done right. I guess a small price to pay to watch football? Reasonable pricing but way too much for the service and quality of food that was luke warm at best. Seemed to be a bother to the waitress when we told her about our eggs. Walked off to another table. Oh well. Lesson learned. May just keep it strictly water next time. Thanks for having the game on though."
Kate K.,"Costa Mesa, CA",185,428,62,4.0,5/20/2013,"I like BJs because there's always something for everyone (like Cheesecake Factory), and the food ranges from good to great. This time I tried their new spicy meatball, deep dish pizza and it was AWESOME! Their deepdish isn't like Chi-town style where it's like a pizza pie with toppings on top of the upper crust, no this is more like a very fluffy crust. Also I had the wedge salad, so delicious! And their crafted Root Beer is AWESOME if you're a rootbeer fan! Better than any out-of-the-can RB I've ever had. Parking is in the mall parking lot, so finding a spot can be difficult, but we showed up at 9pm on a Saturday night and were seated immediately. They have a full bar too, which is AWESOME."
Liz K.,"San Diego, CA",78,347,93,4.0,2/11/2012,First time to BJ's and I can't wait to come back.  It reminded me of Seau's in Mission Valley.  They brew their own beer too which was awesome. I had the Nutty Brewnette and fell in love.  Can't wait to go back and try their other offerings. We tried their flatbread pizzas which were nice and thin crust and heavy on the toppings!  So delicious.  Also tried theCreole Tilapia was so good too.   Was too full to try their famous Pizookie but I will be back for more beer and bites!
Rizalyne E.,"Nestor, San Diego, CA",166,28,8,4.0,2/11/2014,"So many drinks and appetizers to choose from it can easily become a satisfying meal. Love how you can split the pizookie 2 ways and the selections are chocolate chip, Oreo, red velvet, peanut butter and white macadamia any combo will please your taste buds. Definitely coming back for another happy hour! ;)"
Isbel Z.,"Chula Vista, CA",9,39,2,4.0,4/30/2015,"The ambience is good. I like to sit at the bar and order from there, the food is ok. But the service is great! If you go on the weekends be prepare to wait to be seated, or just look for a spot at the bar :)"
Tana C.,"Downey, CA",3,33,37,1.0,10/24/2014,it took over 20 minutes for a server to finally realize we weren't helped ; I don't feel the need to flag someone down if your establishment is not busy and has more then 4 servers walking the floor.I'm DISAPPOINTED because I could have drove to Chula Vista and been helped right away rather then waiting for almost 30 mins to get some damn water.I usually praise businesses especially when their hospitality is great ! I am not impressed at all . . . hopefully our food comes out great because if I wasn't craving dessert I would have left to go somewhere else.Thank you to our server who tried to bring the service up to par but everybody should know the first 5 minutes after being seated lays the foundation for the service and mmmm it took you guys more then 20 no thanks !
Lore R.,"San Diego, CA",13,29,27,4.0,3/31/2014,Great service great food. They have a Pesto Chicken Flatbread Pizza. Amazingggggg!! They took it off the menu but you can still ask for. They have great happy hour and appetizer. You can't go wrong here!
Malachi M.,"San Diego, CA",719,97,156,4.0,12/11/2013,"First time at this BJ's and it was a great experience. I was snatched out the house by my wife to go shopping... ok, I volunteered to hang out with her this time LOL. Men you have to do that from time to time get stay in good graces. At least for those in a pretty good relationship. We just so happen to be having some issues. But you know, ""Happy wife, happy life"" then you'll be able to stay home and watch football next time without getting a penalty flag! Our server was great and suggested some great appetizers to try. We sat up in the bar area for a more cozier atmosphere (it was closer to the TV' shhhhhh). Now I do have to say that we were a bit disappointed in my wife's dessert. Another server other than the one we had brought it out to the table and it was nothing like the description when we looked it over, plus our server even noticed it when he came by the table because he immediately stopped and said, ""excuse me that's not right there's something missing"" he took it back and had them hook it up the way it's supposed to be hooked. Good looking out! They were no longer putting candied pecans on it and that was one of the things that prompted my wife to get it. Or at least tell people that before it's ordered. It was supposed to be a cobbler but it looked like a flat blueberry muffin. Now I know cobblers because I make a peach cobbler you can't eat with your shoes on it's so good... you have to eat it bare footed so you can wiggle your toes @,@ LOL It first came out with two scoops of ice cream sitting one on top of the other and noting else, looking like a cookie with ice cream... when our server brought it back it had three scoops of ice cream in a row, sprinkled nuts and caramel syrup drizzled on it! Now that's a good replay. But it still looked like a blueberry muffin instead of a berry cobbler..."
Sonia O.,"Imperial Beach, CA",98,81,1,4.0,2/17/2015,Had clam chowder it was amazing...next time I will try it in the bread bowl. Our server was amazingly great super attentive and very nice. Has a good day with my family. Thank you.
Giselle C.,"San Diego, CA",134,16,21,1.0,9/16/2014,"Took my mother to celebrate our birthdays and had one of the worse birthday dinners ever. We love to come to this BJS location because of the great staff, service and food, but were severely disappointed during this visit. We waited about 10 minutes to have our drink order taken, and about 30 more to receive our food. We ordered a couple of appetizers along with an entree and expected to have the items brought out in waves like they usually are, but that wasn't the case. After waiting for minutes without the waters we had ordered we were ambushed with every single thing we had ordered, with some of the items being cold. When the food was brought out, we did not have napkins, utensils or plates and were left stranded with no way to eat our food for an additional 10 minutes. Several waiters walked by and say they would bring utensils and plates but never did. Needless to say, our food is cold and dull, and we were left with no desire to buy a birthday cake at the end :( #worsebirthdayever I really do not understand why I keep coming back."
Bianca E.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,3,,1.0,6/24/2015,We usually love BJs. Food was horrible at this one and it was freezing. Manger wouldn't turn up the AC :(
Sharon K.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,6,,1.0,6/23/2015,I think that the perception is not good at the bar when waiters/waitresses and bartender all standing there shooting the shit bad for business
Paul C.,"San Diego, CA",2,5,7,1.0,9/12/2013,"Visited on 9/7/13. Very bad service and long waiting time. Lots of empty tables but long wait time for food. The flat bread pizza was good, ribs very dry. This my first review   I don't like to write reviews but I had for this one. manager needs training. Told her about the bad reviews on Yelp she says I don't listen to yelp does are unhappy people. I guest I am in that category. She took about $15 off our bill, she though that would fix everything. My time with my family was more important I don't mind paying more to have a better experience. My wife nephew wanted to  go there for the flat bread pizza...."
Chelsea S.,"Orange, CA",45,287,,2.0,12/15/2013,"The food is good, don't get me wrong. My friend and I shared an appetizer, and each ordered an entrée. The appetizer (potstickers) was really good and came out right away. But the wait for our entrees starting getting long, and that's when we noticed that the people next to us who probably got seated half an hour after we ordered already had their meals. I flagged down our waiter and he brought the food out shortly after, but it was just much too long a wait. And no discount/comp for the slow service. Oh, and on a Friday/Saturday night parking is a pain and a half."
