Dominique C.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/6/2015,"Horrible service! I ordered the stuffed mushrooms... Word to the wise; if you are expecting the food to at least look edible, eat elsewhere. They served me ""stuffed"" mushroom that were way too small to even stuff. The mushrooms looked empty! Apparently their version of drizzle means drown... Because they drowned the empty mushrooms in lemon pesto sauce. It took way to long to even get my waiters attention. By the time anyone even acknowledged my existence I was just ready to go! This was my first and last time eating at this establishment... Good luck to anyone who does."

Theresa And Anthony E.,"Chula Vista, CA",28,133,141,3.0,2/6/2013,"I LOVE GRAND CRU!!! That is the best beer on the planet but it's only served in season once a year I heard.  Service here is great. Food is alright not the best. My favorite thing, believe it or not is the gluten free pizza. My friend turned me on to it and it's like a thin crust version of their mini pizza (which is on sale during their happy hour) at a reasonable price. I wouldn't go there otherwise if it weren't happy hour. But I LOVE the ambience there. Nice place, cool staff."
Stephanie W.,"Bastrop, TX",21,8,2,1.0,9/20/2014,My friend and I took our husbands here for their first experience. My friend is gluten free and ordered the pork chops those were delicious. Unfortunately her sides were so out of proportion it was ridiculous. (4 tiny cinnamon apples & 6 green beans) the rest of us ordered red meat (2 steaks and a burger) and I will hands down say WORST experience ever. Each of our plates tasted like we were chewing on pieces of charcoal. The meat was over cooked tasted burnt and had absolutely zero seasoning. We were VERY disappointed and will not be back to this location.
David H.,"Carmel Valley, San Diego, CA",290,667,900,4.0,11/13/2011,"I've been here a few times. It's located in the Chula Vista mall off H Street. Service is pretty good. They made sure my iced tea was refilled. The burgers here are good sized and tasty. Lots of choices, plus they have lots of beers on tap if you're a beer drinker. Lots of choices for non alcohol drinkers like me. Cream Soda was mmm! Only bad thing is that they serve Pepsi products instead of Coke. Love the Pizookie dessert. A nice warm cookie type dessert with ice cream. It's a nice sweet treat.  Also in the past when they were running their $20 special. You had a choice of two small pizzas a salad and the pizookie dessert. That was a great deal. Don't know if they're still offering that. I didn't ask the on 11/12/11 because I wanted to get a burger. But that deal is the bomb!  Also they have big screen monitors everywhere so if you want to watch an athletic event you can enjoy while eating. Kind of a sports lovers paradise."
Edgar M.,"San Diego, CA",4,7,3,1.0,10/24/2014,I been in bj's many times and the last two times service been horrible wait times for drinks was 10 min appetizers were brought in after the main course no good !!!!
Cheryl M.,"Chula Vista, San Diego, CA",90,14,2,1.0,9/12/2014,"Hate this place!  Came because the hubby wanted to eat here.  Called two days before to make a reservation for a party of 19, but they said they don't do reservations on Friday's.  So we came anyways prepared to wait, however the hostess was an idiot and so was the manager.  They don't know how to manage their space.  After an hour and a half we finally got seated and it took 15 minutes to get our drinks.  If there was an option for no stars that's what I would put.  If it wasn't for my husband I would have never waited this long."
Christiane D.,"San Diego, CA",303,287,92,3.0,11/14/2011,"I haven't been to a BJ's in a really long time, and definitely not one in the San Diego area for an extremely long time.  A few coworkers and myself went to the Chula Vista location on Friday and I wasn't overly wow'd to say the least.  I'm not sure if it's because I didn't order the right thing or if it was paired with the fact that our service wasn't phenomenal.  I can't put my finger on it. We sat down and was greeted by the bus boy filling our waters, but we waited for what felt like 15 mins or so for our waitress.  They weren't overly busy either, it was about 2pm.  After she finally brought us our drinks, we still had to wait another 10 mins or so to order our appetizers.  I'm not really sure what the hold up was, but it didn't seem to phase our girl.  Good thing I wasn't in a hurry or anything, I wouldn't have been pleased at all. We got the sampler platter to share among us and it had a good selection as well the bites were tasty.  We also got the deep fried artichokes and those were amazing.  For our entree, we each got the salad/pizza lunch special and I didn't think it was that great.  When you think a half and half combo, you would think you would get more than 2 leaves for your salad and your flatbread pizza wouldn't be so pathetic looking, but not here. Afterward, we were waiting more for our bill and even longer to pay.  I'm not sure what was going on, but I wasn't overly impressed and it seems to be a common thing at this location."
Marie D.,"San Diego, CA",0,35,3,2.0,11/12/2014,"Customer service is terrible. Half the restaurant is empty and the bartender is watching tv. I sat at the bar and ordered a wedge salad and a mini pizza for lunch. The bartender was quick and attentive, that's the 2 stars. The wedge salad took 25 minutes. Then a guy sat down next to me at the bar and ordered a wedge salad. As I was finishing my salad, the server brought out the guys wedge salad in 2 minutes. WTF? The mini pizza came out 5 min later and the server brought it to the guy... I said that's mine and she sighed and said oh...rolled her eyes and walked off. The pizza is cold... I will not be returning."
Andrew S.,"Spring Valley, CA",2,10,,1.0,7/21/2014,I've been there multiple times and the service has been virtually nonexistent. I even ordered a meal that came with a salad that I didn't want and the waitress asked if she could eat it. The beer seems watered down also. I keep giving this place a chance because the pizza is good but its just not worth the trouble.
Cecilia L.,"San Diego, CA",19,5,8,1.0,11/9/2014,"Just left here, we had a large party and it was handled very poorly. We waited about 30 minutes just to get our order taken, our waiter did not seem like he knew what he was doing. a side of ranch I had initially asked for along with my order was brought 15 minutes after my plate was brought out. Another 25 minutes to get our check and when we finally did get our check they charged us for and extra plate. The food is decent but the service is always disappointing."
Beatriz A.,"San Diego, CA",0,7,,1.0,11/12/2014,"Poor customer service, bland food, pricey, too loud. I thinks this was my last visit to BJ's. Had to wait to be seated on a Thursday evening.  My son's hamburger was undercooked. We had to return fries as they were cold. They came back and no change. We had to call our server to get refills. Overall unhappy with the service, food quality and ambiance. I would not recommend to anyone."
Michelle C.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",172,117,396,3.0,10/17/2013,"The last couple times I've been here, was mainly for the pizookies, after dinner a few doors down at BWW. We usually order the pizookie trio. The most recent time, last Thursday, we ordered the trio of chocolate chunk, peanut butter, and triple chocolate. I mostly enjoyed the original chocolate chunk pizookie, but I can only have so much! It's always so sweet, and I hate when the cookie starts getting hard. Could be from the ice cream on top, or just from getting cold, Idk. Anyway, our waitress was really nice. I'll probably end up coming back for more pizookies if I'm in the area and crave dessert, lol."
Lucia O.,"Chula Vista, CA",128,152,89,1.0,1/18/2015,"I can't deal with the wait. I got here at 1:20, was seated right away, ordered 5 min later, yet it's 2:00 & still no entree. Finished our appetizer 10 min ago. Not that busy either. WTF"
Kristin A.,"Lafayette, CA",86,110,564,4.0,1/21/2013,"I love coming to this restaurant late at night, especially because it is one of the few restaurants open late at night in Chula Vista. The food always meets my expectations. I regularly order Bloody Marys and Dirty Martinis with every meal. When it comes to my drinks it is really a hit or miss. But other than that, this is one of my favorite go to late night restaurants."
Joe A.,"San Diego, CA",87,74,28,5.0,1/6/2014,"I had an amazing time there. I had good company and we only came to the restaurant for their famous pizookies. But to complement our dessert only meal, we had an amazing waiter named Sarah ( I think) @ 01/03/14 around the afternoon. She gave us various descriptions of the pizookie and at the end gave her recommendations which I followed. The pizookies were amazing, and the waiter made the environment so much sweeter. Thank you for that & I will 100% be back for either dessert or to try out more menu items for lunch/dinner.  This gets a 5 star for customer service and quality desserts."
Naomi G.,"Newport, RI",19,69,5,1.0,10/9/2014,I was here a while ago. Stuffed mushrooms were not fresh. They had been frozen and were watery. The service was sooo horrible. We'll never go back.
Kimberly N.,"Chula Vista, CA",142,64,62,4.0,11/2/2014,Deep dish white pizza = life changing! Bummed they discontinued the red velvet pazookie!!!!  ...the beignets came to the rescue though!
K P.,"San Diego, CA",38,489,60,3.0,11/18/2012,"Cool spacious restaurant. The atmosphere is fun and a great for big groups.  The menu is big and has a good selection. However, when the food arrived, the sampler platter was a bit small compared to other restaurants. The food was ok. The description and pictures on the menu were more impressive than the actual meals. I ordered the Hawaiian Mahi Mahi and it was bland. The pineapple was watered down and from the can. The fish was over cooked and dried out. My husband had the ribeye and he ordered it medium, but it came out super well done.  The service was also ok. Our server was super friendly and accommodating, but she was very slow! We had our appetizers, but still did not receive our waters. Our whole table of 7 had to ask our server a couple of times for our water. Then when our appetizer sampler came out we were missing the artichoke dip. Eventually the manager brought it out.  The only thing that we all loved about our meal was the pizookie dessert.  It's an ok place. Good beer selection, good bar, but service was eh."
Lauren Marie M.,"San Diego, CA",145,16,,4.0,3/22/2013,I love the pizooki! Their drinks are really good as well! And they have a great selection of beer!  I didn't have disappointing service and the bartender was really nice. I approve!
