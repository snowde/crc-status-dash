David B.,"Chula Vista, San Diego, CA",1,10,,4.0,2/8/2015,"Great beer selection and top notch bartenders!! Michelle, Nastassia and Carlos are always on there game and ensure everyone has a good experience!"
Felicia G.,"San Diego, CA",38,25,30,4.0,10/13/2012,"This place has its ups and downs.  Pros:  -Love the abundance of televisions and the huge screen at the bar. -The house beer is great and they add seasonal ones throughout the year.  -They have a decent beer selection in addition to the house brews. -Their food is really good and they can make a decent breakfast also. I love their French toast.  -Huge dining area and the layout works really well and is very inviting. Cons: -Though they seem to have a lot of employees walking around, when it gets busy the wait at the table for someone to come over can be lengthy at times.  -During football or happy hour it is difficult to find someone to clear a dirty table in the bar section.  -When the restaurant gets busier, the quality of the food seems to suffer.  If you view my check-ins, you will see that I come here pretty often. I usually go just before the rush starts so i can be seated and have my food by the time the football starts, or I get there just as happy hour is starting. The employees are always nice."
Karl M.,"Chula Vista, San Diego, CA",6,5,7,4.0,5/27/2013,"BJ's is great. We went there for lunch yesterday and I had the Chicken Fried Steak. It was great! My wife and daughter had the Tuscan Chicken Limone and Teriyaki Shrimp and both were very happy. BJ's has coupons all the time, so be sure to look for them to save a few bucks. The only scary thing is that calories are printed right on the menu, and almost everything has a lot more than you'd think."
Alex G.,"Lakewood, CA",1,7,,1.0,12/28/2014,"**Worst Experience at BJs Ever** I just got out of BJs with no food eaten after a total of 30 minutes waiting without being acknowledged. This is ridiculous!! A soon as I arrived the person signing us in acted as if she did not want to be there. There was no organization as to who went next. I had a couple tell the hostess that they arrived first and skipped us. Once we were seated about 15 minutes had passed and nobody came to ask for drinks or anything. Then there was a table of people next to us that were asked by a waiter what they wanted and still we did not get acknowledged. The level of service this location was horrid. Had this been a fast food chain, I would not mind but when you have an average ticket of $40-$65 for a couple you would expect a higher sense of urgency from the people serving you. After half hour I decided to leave and really ruined my Sunday afternoon. If you value your time I would stay away from this place."
Liza B.,"Virginia Beach, VA",56,84,15,1.0,7/9/2014,"The drinks were great and they have an array of beers.  Downfall is the amount of time you wait for either service or your food.  2 simple entrees that consisted of tacos and a lettuce wrap took over an hour. I flagged someone down to ask and it turned out they were delivered to another table.  You would think our server would have noticed but nope.  He contacted his manager and said we would get ""fresh food"" ....were you not planning to?  Like fresh food is compensation for bad service or something.  I will not be returning to this establishment."
Olga D.,"San Diego, CA",2,38,110,3.0,12/21/2014,"Service was slow today, even though the place was pretty empty for a Sunday afternoon."
Meriah P.,"Hemet, CA",1,38,9,4.0,12/20/2014,"My boyfriend and i came here. It was kind of an awkward visit. Our hostess sat us. Waiter came and took our order. Then a man in a button up and tie (whom i assume is the manager) came and asked us if our waiter had come to greet us and take our order yet. Then different waiters brought us our appetizer, drinks, and entrees. I think the manager checked on us more than our waiter... Whatever the issue was, it was weird. Not bad because we weren't being neglected at all. Just weird. The food was very good. Everything was brought out to us HOT and FRESH, which is very important to me. Drinks were kind of weak, but i think that has more to do with who was bartending than the restaurant itself.  Overall, we liked it here. And we'll be back."
sofia r.,"Chula Vista, CA",2,69,9,3.0,7/22/2014,"manager- not sure if it was Jack the manager but he was very helpful since the hostess was not as helpful.  We walked in because we saw the lunch special 5.95 and up sign outside.  When we walked in the hostess asked if party of 2, I said it was to go and wanted to see the lunch specials.  She just gave me a menu and turned around and kept on talking to another coworker. I asked where was the specials and she didnt hear me so I was looking over the menu trying to find specials, was ready to walk out when manager came up and pointed to specials and gave us information about the menu.  So we place order and food was good-  had the chicken quesadillas with black beans."
Travis S.,"Chula Vista, CA",23,56,17,2.0,11/12/2013,Food is good the drinks are ok the service sucks. I hate when you sit down and your there 20 min and no one even stops by to take a drink order but then the table next to you is seated and they have drinks and appetizers before your getting your first drink. And where do they find these wait persons? I couldn't tell if I had a waiter or waitress come  On bjs get your shit together or next time I go to wild wings!
Djdjt V.,"National City, CA",11,13,8,3.0,11/15/2014,Pizookies! What my friend and I came for and of course dinner. Our waiter was great. Though we were seated right behind the kitchen so we heard every single order coming out! but it was okay as our waiter made up for it by his service.
Sarah W.,"San Diego, CA",29,87,19,5.0,7/10/2012,"On July 3rd I made a last minute reservation for my husband's birthday, in all there were 30 of us. I had been to a BJ's before and the service and food and service wasn't the greatest so I wasn't too excited to return, however it was my husband who chose BJ""s. The menu was extensive and diverse, I liked the option of ordering from the small plates menu as well as the gluten free pizzas. I tried the mozzerella salad and the the watermelon feta, both were very fresh and refreshing, I also ordered the mushroom pizza with carmelized onions on flat bread, again, delicious. Kudos to the manager who was gracious enough to extend happy hour to us at out table, instead of having us go back and forth to the bar to enjoy the HH menu. SERVICE  FIVE stars for ""D"" (Deshon?). D was our only server for 30 of us, I assume because of the last minute reservation. I must say he had such a great attitude, we were a rowdy group, pretty needy, and he was gracious, clam and accommodating throughout the evening and you could tell he was genuine,he was even nice enough to give us separate checks. Everyone commented that he did an amazing job, other severs also came around and made sure everything was ok, they also were very friendly and even chatted with us a bit. BJ""s thank you for making my husbands birthday a great one, you have changed my opinion of your restaurant as a whole, from menu to service, and I can't wait to go back and try new items!"
Camille J.,"Chula Vista, CA",12,79,,5.0,10/31/2015,"Went again Friday Night because this is where my grandkids wanted to eat.  Well, at first, was a little put off by the front desk because they were preoccupied with the computer (restaurant was not busy at the time).  However, our server, Andre, made up for it all.  He was personable, intelligent, knowledgeable, and professional.  Customer service is extremely important in this economy, and it can make or break any establishment.  The food and drinks were good, but the customer service will bring us back.  Thanks."
Pj B.,"Imperial Beach, CA",141,277,1,3.0,3/7/2013,I've only been to the BJ's at Grossmont center once or twice.  Now that i work in Chula Vista this place is right across the street. AND who doesn't love BJ's. (ZING see what i did there?) Stopped by for lunch with the GF. Ordered up a lunch special with half a sandwich and soup (Chili). I do believe it was grilled chicken sandwich. The whole dang mean was good and the service was good for a lunch special. I totally forget what the GF ordered but I'm pretty sure she didn't complain too much. As always the inside is nice.
Alyssa G.,"San Diego, CA",148,174,483,4.0,4/20/2010,"This has to be my favorite location just because I love the layout (and there's a Jamba Juice, Panera, and Starbucks right next door!).  Great open space so it doesn't look too crowded.  LARGE split screen TV behind the bar and additional sets located at all corners of the restaurant so it doesn't matter where you're sitting, you'll still have a great view.  EXTRA POINTS for switching from telemundo to ESPN on request :) Bad service??  Really?  The hostess greeted and seated us right away, and our [1st] waitress was very patient with my sister, cousin, and me.. we were too busy talking to look at our menu that it wasn't till the 3rd time she came that we were ready to order.  We didn't feel rushed and she didn't seem one bit annoyed.  Kudos for the great beer recommendation too.   I'm not much of a [beer] drinker (I know, AND I'm Yelp elite.  whaaat?!), but I really liked their new Oasis amber beer.  It was smooth and not bitter whatsoever.  Where I'm usually the one babysitting her drink, I killed it long before my 30-yr old veteran beer drinker cousin.. and I thought boys could hang.  *tsk tsk, bringing shame to the family name! Half-way thru our dinner, our 1st waitress went on break and was replaced by an equally kind and helpful one.  When ordering my fish tacos (that came in two), she recommended getting one fish and one shrimp so that I could sample both.  DUH!  Why didn't I think of that?!   For our dessert, we wanted to get the large pizookie party platter but that was too much for the 3 of us, and the individual pizookie wasn't enough, so our 2nd waitress recommended the trio and told us they each came with a pretty generous scoop of ice cream.  We weren't disappointed.   In addition, both waitresses came around plenty of times to refill our drinks.  So in my opinion, service was EXCELLENT!  But maybe we were just lucky :) Extra points for the revolving door.  I don't care how old you are, they're still cool. ;)  Boo for no patio sitting tho!"
Manny R.,"San Diego, CA",7,72,34,4.0,3/17/2013,"I came here by default because I was trying to go Buffalo Wild Wings next door, but they had a huge line outside because they were showing the UFC fight that night. I would have loved to go in but my girl and I were kind of on a time limit. So we said hey BJ's looks good and hardly any wait. We waited about 15 min to be seated. Everyone was really nice. I tried the beer sampler. 4- 5oz. Samples of quality beer for under $7 is not bad. We had wings and their new deep dish pizza(spicy meatball). Food was great and so was the service. I will be coming back."
Roxana L.,"Chollas Creek, San Diego, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/12/2015,Got seated and waited for 30 minutes for the waiter to come to the table and take our order. Worse experience ever. I saw two tables get there after us and the waiter took their order and even got their food before a waiter came to our table. So rude. Worst customer service.
Angela H.,"Los Angeles, CA",514,292,55,2.0,3/31/2012,"Not a big BJ's fan to begin with, but even less of a fan now. My friend decided to co-host his birthday dinner here for a group of twenty people. He had made reservations for 7:30 PM. My bf and I arrived 15 mins late, assuming we would simply join our friends at the table. Instead, we found the group split- each half clustered around each end of the bar. There wasn't very much room and we were in the waiters' way. We were constantly dodging waiters who were trying to ring up their tables at the register in the corner just behind us. So we wait for the table to clear up ""in ten minutes"". Ten minutes later, we waited for it to clear in ""fifteen minutes"". It was getting really warm in the restaurant- it definitely needed some ventilation. Just over an hour after the reservation, the group was finally seated. The only pro to the night was three drinks and one beer later, our bill was only $20 at the bar."
Chel R.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",14,706,4505,5.0,6/21/2010,"As many BJs there are here near me, I've never been to one. I was in SD Sunday.  After shopping at the Outlets in Chula Vista, we needed a bite to eat and ofcourse something to drink. The atmosphere was welcoming and relaxing.  There were alot of tv screens at the bar area-as we sat there. Appetizers were good portion, filling, and delicious.  We ordered calamari and chicken lettuce wrap.  Between the three of us, we were stuffed with those along with our drinks. Parking is convenient.  Alot of shopping nearby. Drinks were stiff.  Server was pleasant and sweet."
Allan O.,"San Diego, CA",135,36,402,2.0,2/11/2014,"Let me first say that the reason this restaurant has two stars at all is because of the tasty pizookie that they offer. Food is half of what makes a restaurant truly great, the other half is how it is all presented. For this BJ's fails terribly. Each time I have come here with my youth group on a Sunday evening after church, we wait on average for 45 minutes to receive an appetizer. Add on another 30 minute wait and you'll finally receive your main dish. The waiter had not once came back to check on us or reassure us that our food was on the way and instead we were left at our table for the full 45 minutes. I am usually not as adamant about this kind of thing but BJ's truly does not know how to treat their customers and I say this about ALL BJ's because this has happened at several other BJ restaurants. All-in-all, I am rather disappointed."
Monica L.,"La Mesa, San Diego, CA",100,46,25,4.0,2/4/2013,"I'm here with sis and nieces and I guess we beat the dinner crowd. However, the Tuscan tomato soup and calamari is delicious!"
