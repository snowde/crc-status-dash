Amanda D.,"San Diego, CA",211,255,127,4.0,5/26/2012,"AWESOME DEEP DISH PIZZA AND DRINK SELECTION!!!!! The only thing that sucked was the waiter. Took his sweet ass time for everything. I could see him chatting his mouth off with other employees. Took him FOREVER to get our drinks and ranch. Never mind, scratch that, he was lazy!!!!"
Nancy B.,"San Diego, CA",70,130,1,1.0,3/6/2014,I didn't even get to get a glass of water. Sat down at the bar at about 11pm on a Fri night and the bartenders were already cleaning up. We waited. And waited.  And waited. Until finally one bartender said he'd be with us in a min and left some menus.  Then we waited. And waited. And then left. I get you want to go home but every client that walks in is money in your pocket and you should take care of them better.
JR S.,"Vista, CA",1,43,,1.0,11/17/2015,Worst BJ'S I've been to. Seems like it's typical in Chula Vista to recieve crappy service. Bjs is another place to Stay away from in CV. My waiter was unpleasant my food was cold and my sampler was supposed to be a variety but because they were out of some of the things on the variety deep fried appetizer I was brought out cheese sticks. I didn't ask for cheese sticks. I asked for the sampler. Not paying for this meal. You can't just substitute things without asking a customer and then expect it to be ok. Horrible all the way around. Avoid this BJs.
Jeremiah B.,"Chula Vista, CA",158,4,,1.0,11/15/2014,I should start off by saying I love BJ'S but this experience was absolutely horrible...there was four of us and we waited 55 minutes for our food which was cooked horribly and my daughter had to wait longer due to the waiter writing her order down incorrectly...this is the second time we have visited this location and the second time we have had completely horrible service..this place needs new management....it's unfortunate that this happens to be the closest BJ's to our house...it will probably be the last time we go here
Alexis D.,"Santa Cruz, CA",419,310,1198,3.0,5/30/2010,"Having been to BJ's in La Mesa, this place is alright.  This place is smaller for sure and doesn't have a patio.  I remember when football season was on, my friends and I were trying to watch a game and none of the TVs had audio. It was wack! And, they told us we had to be quite because it was family a restaurant. Booo! Your showing the football playoffs and you serve alcohol! What do you expect? Dumb-asses!  Other than that, I've only had the pizookie from here before and it was excellent, of course.  This place is OK."
Robert B.,"San Diego, CA",0,15,,2.0,6/16/2012,"Went to BJ's the other evening with my wife and youngest daughter.  It wasn't my first choice.  I had been there some time ago and wasn't particularly impressed with the place but my daughter wanted to go, so I gave in.  The menu is pretty extensive, so I figured I'd find something good. The best thing about BJ's (in my opinion) is their extensive selection of beers.  If you are a beer drinker, then you will surely find something tasty here.  Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for the food. The waiter showed up quickly and took our order.  I don't know what's going on, whether there is a new trend in the food service industry or what but servers used to write down the orders.  Its really impressive when someone can actually remember all of the stuff that we order without writing it down, but not so cool when they don't.  Our waiter wasn't as cool as he thought he was. I ordered a medium gourmet five meat deep dish pizza.  The picture looked delicious, and I'm a sucker for deep dish pizza.  I really wanted to love this pizza, but what I actually got did not even come close to meeting my expectations.  It was deep dish all right, about 2 inches thick.  There was also plenty of meat, and the meat tasted pretty good.  My problem was that there was very little else between the meat and bread.  There was a little bit of cheese, but not even close the bubbling pile of deliciousness that BJ's depicts in their photo.  And sauce?  Apparently BJ's don't need no stinkin' sauce.  What I got (for 20 bucks mind you) was basically a piece of bread with meat sprinkled around on top.  Very dry and not at all satisfying. My wedge salad was good, but let's face it - it's hard to mess up a quarter head of lettuce with dressing on top of it.  My wife enjoyed her tomato and whatever salad too.  The hot wings were pretty decent too, once the order was sorted out and we actually got them.  We also ordered some sort of fried artichoke thing that never did arrive... Some of the food arriving at other tables looked pretty good.  My pizza sucked.  Its a good thing I didn't order the large.  Should have skipped the pizza and just drank beer..."
Michelle C.,"Seattle, WA",174,153,33,1.0,7/23/2012,"This review is for the staff:  hands down the worst service I've ever received. Food - standard.  Nothing amazing, nothing too bad."
Jonathan P.,"San Diego, CA",38,105,20,1.0,2/4/2014,"Is is fare to give a restaurant a 1 star rating when you haven't eaten there? Yes, and I'll tell you why... The wife and I walk in on a Friday around 3:45 pm to a hostess who had her back to us because she was doodling on a note pad. It wasn't until I cleared my thought and said hello she turned around. Then the following conversation happened... Hostess ""Table or booth?"" Me ""Booth please"" Hostess ""Oh all the booths are dirty"" Wife ""We can wait, we prefer a booth"" Hostess, ""Well, don't know how long before they are clean, will be a while. Go check up at the bar area and come back to let me know if there are any open"" She said all this with an attitude, like we were bothering her for making her do her job. As we walked up to the bar area you could see the main floor where 5+ tables were dirty with messy dishes. By the time we got up to the bar I was ticked off and decided to leave. My wife stayed behind to speak with a manager because we don't like to leave a bad review with out making the manager aware of the situation. The manager was just as bad as the hostess. He only looked at my wife with a blank stare and asked if we wanted the table wiped down. A simple apology would have gone a long way, then I would have tried a different location."
Ryan S.,"Imperial Beach, CA",6,132,17,4.0,5/16/2012,"I was here Monday after mothers day for lunch. Food was good and service was good. Nothing major good or bad.  The menu is kind of clustered, they should split it into drinks and food. I'll be back!!"
Michael C.,"Imperial Beach, CA",3,3,1,3.0,9/5/2014,Service was good however I ordered my burger to be cooked well done but arrived only seared on the surface and pink throughout.
Brianna S.,"Maui, HI",425,379,670,3.0,12/6/2010,"Your typical BJ's. If you've been to one, this one is no different.  I was not a huge fan, the first time I went to the Bj's in Sacremento. Service was really slow, food was just ok.  What brought me back was that someone gave me a gift certificate, so I HAD to. After all I can't pass up free food. We got the calamari as a starter, and soup and salad combo's for dinner. Not bad, but not great. I probably wouldn't go again unless someone was having their birthday there, or a similar situation.  The atmosphere was nice, our server was on point, and the drinks were stiff enough. If you've been to one BJ's, you've been to this one."
Marcela W.,"San Diego, CA",72,21,,2.0,10/18/2014,"Appetizers were good, but the entrees are hit or miss. Tonight was a total miss! Shrimp scampi pasta sauce so bland, the water they cooked the pasta in probably had more flavor. My hubby ordered a personal deep dish pizza. It looked very unappealing. Little to no sauce, and it was cold. Where I draw the line was that my little boy's meal came after all the entrees, when we ordered with the appetizers."
Brian M.,"Chula Vista, CA",93,81,7,5.0,2/18/2014,I love BJ's! The beer is great and the food rocks. The bar and ambient is always good. I have not had a bad experience here and I've been here quite a bit. Their pizza is the bomb!
Andy T.,"Encinitas, San Diego, CA",104,44,5,2.0,6/23/2015,"Well first off the waiter was really nice, but the only thing is that the service is really slow.  So my mom and i shared an order which was the spaghetti with meetballs with an extra plate and meetballs also two waters. So by the time we got our food it was good but the only problem was that we were missing an extra plate and the meetballs. So the waiter was sorry and went back to go get it. About, half way done the manager came with the meetballs. Again, i asked the manager for water and he said ""I'll be back for the water!"" But no, he goes out and desides to do something else than having to come back for the water. But, at least the waiter was genres and sorry for keeping us waiting. I think he should become manager instead of the manager who brought the meetballs. Their's a higher chance i probably  wouldn't be back at all. I'm  only giving two stars because the waiter was super friendly"
Roger T.,"Chula Vista, CA",1,15,6,5.0,11/8/2014,"The staff is always on point, the food is always tasty, and The beer... Speaks for itself  I think the pricing is good as well, I tend to eat alone and enjoy a great meal and beer for under or around 20 bucks, the lunch special is a steal though $7.50 for endless soup and salad and the soup is   ;) I sit at the bar for faster service there is even a 102 inch tv which is always showing relevant sporting events, we are lucky to have a chain like this in our mall. I like to support small business as much as possible but when I'm looking for that's extra touch I come to BJ's"
Marianna C.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,7,3,1.0,10/14/2015,This was THE WORST place I've eaten at! The service was bad never got my food and when they did bring it....it was burnt! Will NEVER waste my time or $$ here.
Sarahi A.,"National City, CA",0,9,,4.0,9/7/2014,First time there with my husband and I must say the food was delicious (he ordered steak and I ordered shrimp scampi) . The drinks were amazingly good. I ordered a Margarita.  Our server was nice and attentive... I like how the manager walked around and asked for our opinion on the food drinks and servers. ..  We will be back. ..
Vivian P.,"Laguna Hills, CA",1,12,2,1.0,9/4/2015,Service was slow at best. Took 25 mins for my pizookie no joke and was served food without utensils
Bianca V.,"San Diego, CA",71,295,266,5.0,5/16/2014,I love there hand crafted beers. There avacodo rolls are yummy. And the pizza is good too. There a bit pricey but what can I say it's at the mall and tAx is high. But the food is good they just need to work on there service. But every server is different some are new some have been there or some just having a bad day but other then that I love comming to eat here. They have so many Tvs to. And it's not far from home either :)
Daniel N.,"Kennebunkport, ME",7,40,9,4.0,8/21/2014,"Good varied menu, try the tomato mozzarella salad... and definitely leave room for dessert,  pizzookies, and begnets are awesome"
