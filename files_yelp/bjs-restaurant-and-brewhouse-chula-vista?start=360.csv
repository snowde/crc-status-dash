Ciara M.,"National City, CA",205,165,110,3.0,7/5/2012,"It was my first time trying a deep dish pizza and after my experience here, I really look forward to try more deep dish pizzas in other restaurants! However, the ambiance was nice. Nothing too particular with the taste of their deep dish pizza (it reminded me of Pizza Hut). It is still a great place to be in and have a few drinks in. Their pizookie was pretty good. :)"

Florence P.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,75,7,2.0,2/8/2015,"Just went for lunch. The service was terrible from the second we walked in to the time we left. Everything was extremely slow including the seating process and the restaurant was not very busy at all. In places like this, I feel like the problem stems from management be non existent on the floor. Even the food was inconsistent with other BJ's I have eaten at. This restaurant should be re evaluated. It seemed very disorganized."
Erika Marlenne R.,"Chula Vista, CA",1,2,,5.0,10/12/2015,"Superstar happy hour, fancy and very comfortable,  great specials and very tasty!!!!!"
Jomar E.,"Irvine, CA",420,124,368,2.0,9/2/2013,"WOW, the waitress I had sucked so bad. Her name was Ilssia or something like that, she had curly hair, tied in a bun. She didn't know the menu and took forever to get us the food. Also, she never refilled our water- knowing its like 90 degrees outside. The sad part is she didn't even 3 tables. She cared more about socializing with other servers than helping her customers. I am just really shocked by this BJs lack of customer service skills. Also, if you check my reviews, I rarely give out bad reviews, but this place.... Don't come here if you expect a long wait, rude customer service, and expect to be thirsty."
Jacqueline G.,"Bell Gardens, CA",5,39,11,4.0,5/9/2015,I loved the Customer service here. The ladies at the bar did an excellent job taking care of us and everyone at the bar. Very attentive polite and fast ! Can't complain! The only reason I can't give 5 stars is because none of the restrooms had toilet paper lol. Aside from that excellent !
Cynthia G.,"Fresno, CA",0,14,5,4.0,8/6/2014,"Not bad. Sitting at the bar. Got here at 240 so I got a good deal on a pint. Then happy hour started at 3 and got a good deal on food. Nice place to chill if you have time, I like to dine so I don't mind a slow pace..food comes out at an average time frame. Service is good."
Shane H.,"Chula Vista, CA",7,3,1,4.0,8/2/2014,"Atmosphere is nice, tv's everywhere.  Brewery has nice assortment.  I had the jambalaya and it was fantastic.  The wife and child both had a pizza and were mildly satisfied.  I'd eat there again."
Nitsuj B.,"San Diego, CA",2,7,24,2.0,9/5/2013,"Worst experience ever!!! I don't remember the waitresses name but she was the pregnant one that usually does happy hour I think!! Slowest service ever!!! SLLLLLLOOOOOOWWWWWEEEEESSSSSTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!! If it wasn't for the other girl that came in, this would have been a 1 star. It took like 45 minutes to get me food, and she still got the order wrong!! Yard House is still number one!!!!!"
Areisha M.,"San Diego, CA",1,10,,2.0,7/24/2015,"Came here on Tuesday night with my husband and couple of our good friends. Our waiter was very friendly and chatty, but it took him a long time to get us our drinks from the bar (he was quick to blame the bartenders) and as the evening progressed he seemed to get more and more flustered. One of the appetizers we ordered came out wrong, we wanted the brussel sprouts with the cream sauce on the side, and again he was quick to blame the kitchen staff. My friend had to ask twice to have her water refilled. He brought out two entrees and then said  the kitchen messed up on my entree so they were working on redoing it. When he finally did bring out my dinner and the other missing dinner, they were both wrong. I understand that everyone has off nights but we were really disappointed. The waiter did tell us that his manager was going to discount our bill but that did not happen, and instead of making a big deal about it we just paid the full price and left. The only reason I am giving 2 stars is even though our waiter was quick to shift blame, he was friendly. However, we will not be coming back."
Jennifer M.,"National City, CA",38,21,1,1.0,7/13/2013,"The food is tasty but every single time I come here it is BAD service.   I keep going back because the food is pretty tasty but no more!  The service has been horrible one too many times... NO MORE !  I will not put myself through this again there are far too many tasty restaurants in SD...  BJ's  is on my ""don't spend another penny on them"" list."
Brian F.,"Spring Valley, CA",180,71,30,4.0,6/16/2015,"very good brewery!  good selction of beers on tap.  i havent eaten there yet, just go to the bar for drinks, full bar!"
vero M.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,11,,5.0,8/20/2013,"Last night my husband surprised me with a surprise birthday party at BJs in Chula Vista. My husband was able to reserve same day and they were very accommodating. We pretty much had the second level,  to ourselves, the servers were very attentive and provided us with great service. We were a group of about 17. My husband was very pleased with what he had planned for us. I needed to make room for my newborns stroller and they moved some chairs for me to help me put it out of the way. The waiter also took some pictures for us. I would absolutely recommend BJs in Chula Vista. Ryan J. was our server, hope he enjoys the generous tip my husband left. I had the best 40th birthday dinner with friends and family."
Jamie F.,"Las Vegas, NV",41,12,,1.0,8/15/2015,We had the worst service at this restaurant. We were seated for 15 minutes and not even offered anything to drink and this was after 9pm at night. We told the host and he didnt care either.
Luther V.,"San Diego, CA",38,25,6,2.0,8/7/2012,"Came here with my family for my uncle's bday and did not have the best experience. I walked in to a not so friendly host that did not greet us when we walked in.  This is a much larger Bj's restaurant than the one in La Jolla, which is the one I'd prefer to go to if I ever go back to another Bj's.  I ended up ordering the Texas style country fried steak.  It was TERRIBLE!  The meat was dry and the gravy was way too salty.  I ended up just eating the mashed potatoes, without the gravy, and the veggies.  I didn't get to taste anyone elses, but from sauce on my nephew's face it seemed that the ribs weren't too shabby.  I think the best dishes were the Apps. The service was pretty bad.  Our waitress seemed to be pretty flustered when taking our orders and probably smiled 2 times.  When it came time to bring our food, they brought out 2-3 dishes that we didn't order, which one of the dishes was charged on our bill! Overall, if you want to eat at Bj's go to the one in La Jolla.  If you come to the one in Chula Vista, you're going to have a bad time."
Carla N.,"San Diego, CA",111,12,,1.0,6/2/2013,2 hours!  It took 2 hours for brunch on a Sunday for 4 people. No wait when we got here. They didn't come to get drink orders for a good 15 mins. Took our whole order at once and came back with appetizers. Then a new waiter came to our table to tell us that out original waitress forgot to put on our order and had to wait even longer for it to come out.  Idk why we even decided to stay for dessert. Took another 30 mins for pizookie. Never came to refill our drinks and didnt comp anything for forgetting our orders or our wait!!  Not one manager even came to the table to see if we were ok.  Horrible service.
Renee N.,"San Diego, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/1/2014,We have been here several times. Family friendly and as usual the food was great!   But our waiter Joshua was the worst.  He Never brought out plates for appetizers.  Only refilled drinks once ....we needed another refill that we never got.  Even took forever to pick up the check.   :(
Cynthia M.,"San Diego, CA",1,12,,1.0,6/28/2013,"So disappointed.  Yesterday, middle of the afternoon, I wanted to take my mom for lunch.  So we walk in the front door, go to check in, and we wait, and wait.  I look around its not like it is crowded at all. So we wait, still no one ever acknowledged that we were standing there. Not good for service. So after standing there and no one bothering to acknowledge us we walked out.  Now I have been  here many times, mind you. This was simply unacceptable. Bad reflection on your management. This was after the lunch crowd and before dinner, like I said, so it certainly wasn't busy. Management pay attention!!"
Jen R.,"Chula Vista, CA",17,16,3,3.0,9/3/2013,"Damnit BJ's! You are a sinking ship. You'll not find a more loyal fan than me,but you continue to disappoint. I wish I could say it is the humidity causing the beer to be served room temp, but this is the 3rd time (props to BJs in Carlsbad for their frosty goodness)! Their handcrafted IPA was flat, however now I know the Bear Republic Racer IPA is rad!! Food rating is a 10- saved yourself yet again but I'm a beer gal!! We ordered the small bites: spinach stuffed mushrooms, Thai & Buffalo wontons, and california club flatbread!!  So good i wanted to throw it through a window :) ----There were three tables occupied yet, bless his heart, our waiter was overwhelmed. Anyways, ill be back regardless!!"
Alex P.,"San Diego, CA",0,6,,4.0,6/22/2015,One of the best places to go and have dinner and beer with friends or family. Culminating service and food. Not expensive at all. Definitely going back soon.
