Ritche A.,"San Diego, CA",39,10,1,5.0,8/31/2013,"Really good tasting food, and is usually busy during dinner. Always tastebud satisfying when I eat here! Pizzas and pastas never fail here!"
Jesse B.,"National City, CA",23,30,22,3.0,5/20/2014,"I really enjoyed our service from Amanda, she was very courteous and friendly.  The wings were awesome and the burger was good, kids menu chicken pasta was ok, what I did not like was the Buffalo chicken pizza, they used a hickory smoked bbq sauce that had no business being there next time I will go with the usual peperoni and play it safe other than that everything including our service was good"
Elvina A.,"San Diego, CA",57,19,7,2.0,10/29/2013,Updating this bjs has gone downhill...NOOO WHHYYY :( the staff is still friendly but the quality of the food has gone down the last couple of times I've gone ...I thought it was a fluke but alas I am not sure what happened.
Dorothy T.,"San Diego, CA",39,5,,1.0,5/30/2013,Did BJs in Chula Vista change Mgmt or what? This place has always been my favorite but after tonight I won't be coming back! I brushed off a few times when they forgot our salad or the one time they brought our appetizer the same time as our meal but today tops it all..we waited a half hour noticing they were calling customers who came after us only to find out our pager wasn't even registered!! They need someone at the front (and there was 4 of them) who knows what they're doing instead of standing there yawning the whole time we were there!! Very disappointed!!! and all the girl could do in the front was put her head down and say i'm sorry!!! I'm sorry too cause you just lost our business coming in there once a week!!!
Cruise L.,"Pearland, TX",0,73,84,5.0,5/12/2011,"Beer! They have beers from all around the world. They also have about a dozen BJ's-brewed beers: 8 regulars and a few seasonals. I recommend for first timers (and beer connoisseurs): TRY THE 9 BEER SAMPLER. They come out arranged from lightest to darkest, so you can get a feel for what fits you. Or you can look here: ( ) My personal favorite: Jeremiah Red. I have been around the world and have tried hundreds of beers and this one beer here at BJ's is my favorite beer of all time (understandably, your tastes may vary). I've been a regular here for the past two years and the thing that keeps bringing me back (besides their BJ's-brewed beers) are the pizzas! Deep dish, fresh ingredients. My personal favorite: The Mediterranean. It comes with grilled chicken, basil pesto, roasted garlic, Kalamata olives, sun-dried tomatoes, feta cheese and sliced peperoncinis. So fresh and so goood. QUICK TIPS: Go during happy hour (3pm - 7pm).  Sit in the bar area. $1 off draft beers & cocktails.  $2 off appetizers. (Chips & Salsa are awesome) HALF of mini-pizzas. Hopefully you will get good service - that seems to be the primary complaint on Yelp here.The only bad service I've had is from the bartenders, who seem to be really slow at placing orders. My server generally has to go ask at least twice. What gives? Also, a guy named Branden is probably the best waiter I've ever had there. That dude is #1 when it comes to service! Sadly, I am moving to Japan for 3 years (Navy) and will not get to enjoy BJ's anymore. So, if anything else, please go have a beer for me, and raise your glass to those serving to protect freedom! Thank you!"
Jesse P.,"Chula Vista, CA",1,1,,2.0,11/9/2014,Not the level of service I expected! Food was great but waiters were very unattentive. Once i asked someone for more drinks they responded by asking who's our waiter and took there time in bringing them after we were practically done with our meal. Hesitant to come back to this restaurant.
Adam H.,"Norfolk, VA",101,5,1,5.0,5/8/2014,Great service great food!!! Avocado Eggroll was awesome. Plus I had the buffalo bison burger. Only 560 calls and I devoured it haha. Great craft beers too. Awesome.
Danelih G.,"Chula Vista, CA",272,15,6,5.0,9/30/2014,"I love it here. Family friendly environment, great food and i love how they have a variety of food to chose from. From pastas to cheeseburgers to steak and fresh salads. Their food is always cooked to perfection. I recommend the stuffed mushroom appetizer, its delicious."
Ashley D.,"Imperial Beach, San Diego, CA",11,8,2,1.0,5/13/2013,"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE SERVICE!!! I have been to the other Bj's restaurant in San Diego, and it is one of my favorites. However, this location had the worst staff I have ever seen. I came with a friend to celebrate Mothers Day, we were seated quickly because it was an afternoon, so it was not busy at all. But when we ordered our food with an appetizer to come before our meal, we had to wait 40 MINUTES to get it! Another 20 MINUTES for our entrees. I had somewhere to be afterward so this was truly an inconvenience, but I wish that were the worst part. When they brought out the food, it was cold. Not lukewarm, cold. They brought my friends pizza out WITH A SLICE OF PIZZA MISSING. Who does that!??? The waiter, Lindsey (a male) told me one slice fell off, and shrugged ""I don't know what you want me to do, I can get a manager if you want"". So after waiting for a manager, all he can tell me is ""I just got here...I just walked through the door"" over and over. But contradicted himself after admitting the pizza fell on the floor, than quickly correcting himself, saying it was just the slice that fell. So was he there, or did he just ""walk through the door""?? He was totally inconsiderate. I wish I had got his name. They comped my meals, but I had to pay for my appetizer and alcoholic beverage. The staff at that location are so unprofessional, they seem to have no experience in the food industry, or customer service for that matter. A bunch of kids out of high school. I left feeling totally unsatisfied, and nobody, not even the manager, could care less."
Joanne B.,"San Diego, CA",1010,663,2397,2.0,2/26/2009,"I had dinner here tonight with some friends and throughout the night while we were there, I kept thinking how half-ass their service was!  Really, it was pretty sad that a nice new restaurant in the mall had terrible service. We arrived and there's already a wait for a table in the very full main dining area on a Thursday night.  That's fantastic for our economy, but screw the wait, we found an open booth in the bar area where seating is open, so that was a good start. Things went south quick though.  Our server reminded me of Drew Barrymore's character in 50 First Dates because homie couldn't remember anything the minute he would walk away from our table.  We had to flag him down several times to take our order, bring us water, bring out the soup my friend ordered before dinner, you get the picture. I only ordered an appetizer and one of their girly beers, my friends had some beer and entrees.  My one friend ordered a French dip sandwich, but he got served a BBQ sandwich of some sort instead.  It already took close to 45 minutes for our food to come out, so he just said f-it and ate it anyway, none of us wanted to wait much longer and they were both hungry boys. I'd go back if they worked out their kinks.  I know they opened less than three months ago, but c'mon, help me help you!  Speed up your service and train your servers to put on their happy faces and I'll give it another shot.   You didn't quite have me at hello, but we'll get there."
Evelyn M.,"National City, CA",1,27,1,4.0,4/24/2014,"I love this place! It can get a little busy at times, but I believe it's worth the wait. I personally love the customised pizza and the hot wings are absolutely my favorite. I would definitely recommended this place."
Toni S.,"National City, CA",0,12,,1.0,10/17/2013,"This BJ is by far the worse restaurant. The food is lousy and over priced. You don't get what you pay for.  Service is terrible.  The last three times I was there, they got my order wrong everytime.  I will not be back ever, even if my food is free. I would save my myself the trouble."
Andrew A.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,11,,1.0,6/20/2014,"Save your money, food was very poor and served cold. You would get better quality food at Taco Bell."
Emily P.,"Chula Vista, CA",5,91,7,2.0,10/5/2014,"I'm sorry I have to say it but the service here is awful. The restaurant wasn't even busy! I could easily forgive them if it was during the lunch or dinner rush but it was 2pm and there were servers and empty tables everywhere. Still, the service was ridiculously slow and my actual server was not very friendly. He never smiled...not once! Also puzzling to me is why he would serve my 2-year old daughter orange juice in a lowball glass??? Seriously? How odd and thoughtless is that? I had to taste the damn thing just to make sure it wasn't a screwdriver or something. Not to mention the fact that she's not exactly nimble enough to hold a heavy glass like that all by herself. So every time she tried to drink her juice, I had to drop everything and hold it steady for her. Geez! Also, we didn't even get any utensils. I had to ask for them AFTER our food came out. As for our food, my salad came out with no dressing. Really? At least put it on the side if you're not going to add it to the salad before serving it. I can only assume that perhaps something was going on in the kitchen that led to the slow service or maybe our server was just new. Either way, I know we weren't the only ones being affected. I spent so much of my meal time sitting and waiting that I observed other tables around me getting apologies about the wait from their own servers, as well as a man who I can only assume was the manager on duty. For that, I didn't withhold leaving my server my normal 25% tip for our meal because I'm sure he was doing his best (or at least I hoped he was). But, this experience did leave me with a bad taste in my mouth and for that, I know I will not be returning here anytime soon."
Kimberly H.,"San Diego, CA",12,6,,2.0,5/11/2014,Service I give a 3 from our server. He spilled a drinkon the floor and a customer and just left it there. The manager who spoke with us was more friendly than the server. He was a constant bonus to out experience. The food was dry even with the mountain of mayo the manager brought me. Based on this experience I won't come back here. But I would tryout another location.
Monica B.,"Spring Valley, CA",2,2,,1.0,2/5/2013,"Hands down worst customer service ever! You walk in and the hostess looks at you like she doesn't speak English when you ask for a booth seat. Then when you get seated it takes 5 minutes for someone to ask what you would like to drink and when she ""Rosemary"" shows up she rushes you to tell her what you would like to drink as she is impatiently looking around..then as you attempt to order she takes one persons order and assumes its for the both of you and turns and walks away..as she brings the food Rosemary decides she's just going to put it down and walk away, not even ask if we need ketchup or if everything else was okay..so we wait for her to FINALLY come back and when she does it takes another 5 min to bring back the items..all in the meanwhile of them talking very loudly about some other customers sitting 2 booths behind us. Very bad customer service!"
Linda S.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,5,,5.0,6/15/2015,"We've been here several times over the past couple of years, and the food has always been very good.  Today we had the soup and salad lunch, and both my husband and I really enjoyed it. The broccoli cheddar soup is delicious, as is the Mexican tortilla soup. Cesar salad was a little boring, but my husband enjoyed the wedge salad with bacon, tomatoes and bleu cheese. We've always had very nice servers here, and Blanca was very good today. Last week I ate there with a large group when their computers were down, but Junior took good care of us. Good selection of their own and other local craft beers. Burgers are good, as are the thin fries. Probably a good thing this is on the other side of town from where we live!"
Jen L.,"San Diego, CA",3,114,40,1.0,4/6/2015,No service... My dad is handicapped and has a hard time walking. I asked for a closer table and were moved. No one came to help us. Not even drinks. 3 tables that were seated after us were helped and orders taken. Before we walked out we asked for the manager. And all he could say is he could move us to a different table. We won't be going there again. This is how they treat retired handicapped veterans.
Colleen C.,"San Diego, CA",0,292,8,4.0,5/22/2013,"Lots of 5 star experiences.  Our server, Josh, was charming. Tortilla soup was plentiful and the skinny fries were perfect.  Friends loved mahi mahi tacos in both grilled and fried versions.  Chicken sandwich was not so good.  Been before and we were pleased with burgers.  Plenty of choices on menu!"
Jairo C.,"San Diego, CA",0,4,,1.0,11/23/2014,"Just got back from this restaurant and I must say this has been the worst experience I have had here... My gf and I came in around 10:15 am for breakfast on Sunday 23rd... As soon as the young hostess set us down we notice the lack of costumer service, she just set us down with a straight face and put 2 menus on the table and left, it's fine I thought, maybe she is just having a bad day or hates her job, whatever... Everything was fine but we noticed the waiter was EXTREMELY stressed, I get that maybe he was busy but his lack of professionalism was evident, every time the host would sit more people on his side of the restaurant he would just flat out stare at her and shake his head and just looked annoyed, he couldn't mask his discomfort at all. At one point when my gf asked him for the check, he frantically turned and look super stressed and said ""oh thank you for yelling at me... Umm... Ugg... (Shaking his head)"" I suppose he was stressed but I think this restaurant need to focus on keeping their employees happy and not so stressed."
