Mikela D.,"San Diego, CA",16,160,1,1.0,2/16/2017,"Worst bj's in San Diego. It can be completely dead and we will still have the worst service. Servers are never attentive. It's so unfortunate.  Food has come out cold and incorrect the past 3 times of going.  The most recent time we ordered online for a half white pizza and half barbecue. I would say about one fourth of the pizza was white pizza and the rest was barbecue. Which wasn't even the correct white pizza, they didn't put the white sauce that should be on there which is Alfredo. Once we got home we realized it and of course did not want to go back. Just a waste of money .I love the food at bj's so I always go back !but I suggest to everyone to Make the extra long drive to la Mesa and enjoy your dining experience."
Kristie B.,"Chula Vista, CA",86,259,1174,3.0,10/9/2016,"While I don't frequent chains (I love giving business to small biz), this place isn't half bad. I dig the bar area for sports watching, for sure. They've also got a great beer selection and a pretty good, diverse menu. The staff is also very friendly. The deep dish buffalo chicken pizza is a go-to for me (SO good!) and the hubs, as are the sriracha brussels sprouts (though this last visit, they could've been cooked longer). I recently learned that their burgers aren't so great, but the menu is HUGE, so there are plenty of other options. And, if you get a pizookie, it doesn't really matter that the burger was a letdown... because a pizookie NEVER IS!!!"
Allyn D.,"Chula Vista, CA",60,20,29,4.0,12/6/2016,"Went recently for lunch,  the place was not that busy but it took a long time to get our order. If you are not press for time it's a good place to have lunch they have some good food and awesome dessert . I love the Brussel sprout with honey and Sriracha.  The BJ's PB  smore  Pizzokie was awesome!!! you need somebody to share it with though it was too much even for 2 people:).  all in all a good place I just wish it doesn't take a long time to get our meal done"
Breanna R.,"Chula Vista, CA",363,73,220,3.0,1/5/2016,"The martinis here are DELICIOUS! I ordered a cosmo first because our waiter let us know that the cadillac is pretty weak. I loved them both but the cadillac is just so tasty. Will definitely be back for the martinis!  The food not so much! I ordered the seared ahi salad and there was only a few small pieces of ahi sliced up. WARNING: They put two little dollops of wasabi on the sides of the plate and I didn't realize because it was in a more creamy consistency and I confused it with avocado.. well i ate it by accident and it kept getting mixed up in the salad. Not a good time. The pizza wasn't very good either when I tried it at my work party that was held here. There are some menu items that I do enjoy & you can't go wrong with the pizookies!  Service was extremely slow and it was a Wednesday night. Service was slow at our work party as well! Definitely some areas that need improvement, but I'll be back (:"
Nicole W.,"San Diego, CA",1,4,,5.0,11/28/2017,"My review is based on service and it really was great. Cory, our service made the experience excellent! I could tell he was busy but the service was still fantastic. We said we were in a rush so he thought about what he could do to make that easier for us. He brought a box and check without us even asking. Now a days this is rare at any restaurant. Someone who actually thinks about how to make your experience better, how they would like to be served. Nothing went unnoticed, from ranch on our pizza to apologizes about a mistake, everything was great!"
robbie f.,"Chula Vista, CA",52,1,,5.0,7/27/2017,I am in Chula Vista resident and we went to BJ's brewhouse today and let me tell you BJ's has the best beer selection in Chula Vista!!! They have one of the best beers I've had Resident's Walk of shame you have to try this!! As far as food I recommend the California chicken club and you have to end your dinner with a Pizookie. I will be heading to BJ's in Chula Vista Mall when I feel like a beer for now on you can't get a better variety of beers on tap.
Mark C.,"Buffalo, NY",25,5,,4.0,9/29/2017,We were looking for a good place for pizza and a beer - being from out of town - so we stopped here.  Enjoyed their own beers - also had great selection of others.  Flat bread pizza was great - good to share for two - liked their buffalo bites.  Liked our servers - a nice time for sure.  Thanks!
Jennifer B.,"Chula Vista, CA",22,25,2,1.0,11/22/2017,Terrible food quality.  It took a long time to get our undercooked turkey burger (still raw in the middle) under cooked beef burger and cold french dip sandwich. We had to send everything back except for one burger. We told them not to bring back the two burgers and to remove them from the check and waited a really long time for a luke warm french dip replacement.
Mayra M.,"Potrero, CA",1,7,1,5.0,8/12/2017,"So I think this place is good and all but the reason it has 5 stars, and the reason I would go back was because of our wonderful server Danielle K. Me and my friends went in last night around 10:30ish scrictly for pazookies (which are amazing by the way), and Danielle was so happy and bubbly and made us feel so welcome! My friends and I are all servers and we know that working this buisness is not easy, but Danielle was happy and infectiously enthusiastic, and made our night so much better! BJ's is so lucky to have her!"
Jeff S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",121,7,,2.0,6/6/2017,"The only reason for 2 stars is because of the bartender, Junior. He's way too professional and accommodating to have to constantly apologize for an incompetent kitchen staff. He even had to dismiss one of the other servers complaining about other customers while they were in front of me at one point. I've been to many BJ's before and the food was far below what I'm accustomed to from their franchise. One of the worst steaks and side items I've ever had at a restaurant. Also overheard another customer complain about his buffalo wings.  Last small item was that I ordered a pizookie to-go and it didn't come with to-go silverware like one would assume."
Jessica S.,"San Diego, CA",235,920,2051,2.0,1/2/2016,"Not my favorite BJ's location.  They were pretty empty when we arrived, right around noon on a Saturday. And when I say ""empty"", I mean it. Not even the hostess stand was occupied at that time. There was one waiter wandering around, but we ended up waiting for about five minutes for someone to show. And when she walked around the corner, she looked surprised to see us.  Our waitress was friendly, I'll give her that. She was patient with me taking my time going through the menu, and then with my snap decision to change my order after I'd already placed it. I NEVER do that!  We both decided on the Unlimited Soup and Salad combo (to be fair, I wanted something else to start). I got the Tuscan Tomato soup with the Caesar salad, he got the Chicken Tortilla soup with the Tomato Basil salad.  Here's the thing. The place was mostly empty. Our orders weren't particularly complicated. And yet, it took almost twenty minutes for our food to get to us. I was almost beyond my hunger by the time we got our meals.  My soup was okay, though a bit oily. It could have done with a dollop of cream or a smattering of cheese, though. The salad was terrible. I love Caesar salads, and before today wouldn't have thought that one could be messed up... The Chicken Tortilla soup was the star by far. It was spicy and flavorful and hearty. I contemplated getting a bowl for myself for a second serving, but ended up stopping after the first round.  At least lunch wasn't very expensive."
Chloe Ysabelle S.,"San Diego, CA",23,14,18,1.0,7/15/2017,"The worst BJ's I have EVER been to. This place is a mess. Whoever hired the staff there needs to be fired, asap.  After watching a movie, my friends and I decided to come here to eat dinner. Ladies at the front are completely unprofessional. Always chatting it up, ignoring customers. We got seated after 10 minutes. all was well.  It took 20 minutes for our waiter named Mario to even come by and greet us. He walked past our table SEVERAL times. He asked us what we wanted to drink, and we waited another 15 minutes for our drinks to come. Waited another 15 minutes for him to come back to our table and ask us what we wanted to order. Mind you, he kept passing by our table.  He finally asked us what we were going to eat, and after we said the main entrees, I SAID SPECIFICALLY, ""FOR DESSERT, WE WOULD LIKE THREE PIZOOKIS."" He said ""okay, your order should be coming soon.""  30 minutes later, a pizooki came. BEFORE OUR MEAL. I said politely, "" Sorry but I said this was supposed to come out after we're done eating?"" The lady that brought it to us said, ""Alright let me find out what's going on with your server. You can just keep that."" Our waiter then comes and says, ""You guys ordered the pizooki right? Now you guys are saying you don't want it anymore?"" I said, ""No. I told you specifically that the pizookis were for dessert. It doesn't make any sense for us to eat the dessert before our meal."" The nerve of this guy to then all of a sudden reply with ""well you should've ordered it afterwards, whatever."" My blood was beginning to BOIL at this point.  After another 30 minutes, our food finally came. All except my friend's chicken alfredo. We thought it would arrive 5-6 minutes after we had all gotten our food, but NOPE. It never did!!!!!! I called someone else over and I said, ""You guys have the worst costumer service ever. We've been waiting for about an hour now and we still don't have my friend's food. We're all pretty much done eating. Our waitor was extremely rude and threw a fit about us complaining about the pizooki coming BEFORE our meal. I would like to speak to your manager. ASAP!!!""  Not to mention I also has to ask 4 DIFFERENT PEOPLE FOR HONEY MUSTARD AND RANCH!! THE LAST PERSON FINALLY BROUGHT IT TO ME AFTER I WAS DONE WITH MY SANDWICH!!  The next thing you know, our waiter stands by our table talking to another waiter. He then proceeds to state, and I quote, ""I GOT SOMETHING GOING ON WITH THESE DAMN KIDS OVER HERE."" That's when I completely LOST it. I told the girl that I talked to and asked to bring the manager over to come to our table once more. I told her what he just said and she said that she apologized and that the manager would be coming to our table soon.  The manager came, I told him our dilemma. Gave the whole speech about how sorry he was, etc. And we got a new waiter, as if that was really going to help at all at this point because she was just as shitty as the other one.  Alfredo came, and the pizookis came afterwards. We ended up getting the drinks for free, pizookis for free, and alfredo for free. 40 bucks for 7 people. Lol that was the only good thing that came out from that night. We didn't bother leaving a tip. I don't really care. They treated us like shit, pretty much expecting us to somehow compensate for their actions. Mario, if you're reading this, a big FUCK you. If you hate your job so much, quit! Stop ruining your customer's day just because you've got a stick up your ass. He was also frustrating the other people behind us. Kept messing up their order and everything.  Anyway, never coming back here. Would rate -1000 stars if I could.  Oh, and i'm not exaggerating these time frames.  It literally took us nearly 3 hours to get out of that hell hole because they were so slow. Save your money and go somewhere else! :)"
Maddi Jo N.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,1,,5.0,12/27/2017,Checked in at BJ's at 7:00 pm so that we could walk the mall and get a spot by 8. This gave them an hour for a table. We came back at 7:50 and they told us that the table would be ready in another 25 minutes. We proceeded to come back at 8:15 for them to tell us they gave our table away. I got pretty upset at this. But of course we stayed for the pazookie. I hope next time that the service will be better because I truly love the franchise but i am disappointed that It took over an hour and a half to get a spot to sit at. Next time I won't be doing the same thing. And I hope that the service will work out. Hopefully the person taking the table count next time will be a tad bit more approachable and that she won't be so abrupt with me telling me how I should have heard them call for my name when she did not call any name for me. I just think that waiting for an hour and a half is absurd for a restaurant that is usually so prompt at seating their guests.
Elizabeth O.,"San Diego, CA",266,189,1744,4.0,10/8/2015,"I came in with family to celebrate my 25th birthday. Our server was Ernesto. Ernesto was very friendly and smiley. The ambiance of the restaurant was very nice. It was like a combination of elegant restaurant and sports bar. There were several TVs throughout the restaurant with sports playing. The tables were nice and big and very comfortable. There was plenty of space in between tables and it didn't feel crowded although it was a little busy. It was however a bit dark and I had to use the flashlight on my phone to read the menu.  Oh boy, the menu was intense. There were probably about 20 pages and there was so much to choose from. There wasn't a lot of pictures and the font was very small. I felt a bit overwhelmed on the selections and being an indecisive person it took me a while to finally figure out what I wanted.  We started off with the potato skins appetizer. It was alright. It was lacking several toppings on a few of the skins. Overall it was O.K.  I ordered a sweet tea with lemon and the tea was actually very good. I ordered the Fish N Chips with wedge fries. The fish was nice and crispy and the fries were excellent. They had the perfect flavor and perfect amount of crispiness and softness. My mom enjoyed her pulled pork sandwich.  My mom said the BBQ sauce on her sandwich was nice but was pretty spicy, but she did enjoy it and finished the whole thing. My brother ordered the double decker and he thought it was going to be hot but it was cold but he said he liked it. My family told them it was my birthday and after we got our to-go boxes our server brought me out a small Pizookie with a candle and said Happy Birthday. They didnt do a birthday cheer or song. Thats ok. The pizookie was very doughy. It was tasty but i could only eat one bite! My brother loved it and ended up eating the whole thing."
Nathaniel C.,"San Bernardino, CA",0,2,4,5.0,10/4/2017,"To be brutally honest, the service usually is not the best. However, I was there on October 1 around 9 PM and we had the best waitress I have ever had....ANYWHERE!! Huge shoutout to Gennezys!!!!! Please make her a manager! She waited our table with first class effort!"
Michael V.,"Rolando, San Diego, CA",5,9,5,2.0,8/16/2017,Made a reservation for nine people. Got here and they didn't have the table ready because they thought it was for seven. We waited while they arranged two tables for us. Even though we were here to celebrate my moms birthday we didn't mind. The hostess was not warm and welcoming to the point and infant even mentioned her rolling her eyes at us. Our server (Eli) Elizabeth made the experience better with her warm and friendly personality.  Been here several times and this is the first time I'm not happy with the service and I actually have to write about it. The first impression of the place is the hostess and it was not welcoming. If it wasn't for our waiter who I would rate five stars and the food that actually was good then I wouldn't have enjoyed myself with my family.
Larisa C.,"Chula Vista, CA",23,7,3,5.0,6/24/2017,Hey! Went with good  friend  and Ryan was the awesomeness! Best server in a long time anywhere! He made it happen.  Thanks BJ's.
Calvin R.,"Chula Vista, CA",1,2,1,1.0,7/22/2017,"I've been coming to this BJs for years now and have never really had any issues. Today was a different story. Aside from our waitress Stephanie and the bartender, the service was horrendous and ridiculously unprofessional. My family came in for lunch around 12:30 and was met by 4-5 employees doing absolutely nothing but having very loud personal conversations at the hostess stand. The ""hostess"" took just enough time to turn to us and point at a table and said "" You can sit up there in that round booth the waiter will get you menus"" im no expert but im pretty sure thats the hostess job to TAKE YOU to your seat and SEAT YOU with menus. NOT TODAY! After we sat ourselves the really important conversations and revolving group of disrespectful annoyingly loud employees using the hostess stand as a hang out continued. At one point i asked the waitress if this was a regular thing and she went to tell them to quiet down........ which didnt work. I used to come to this restaurant fairly often but thats probably gonna change now."
Manuel A.,"Chula Vista, CA",1,6,,5.0,8/25/2017,"AUTUMN!!!! Thank you SO MUCH for the fantastic service and attention! Thank you, thank you, thank you!"
Kheyla-Thiana H.,"Chula Vista, CA",133,17,12,3.0,1/5/2017,"For a well-known restaurant I was highly disappointed. While it looks nice and is very clean inside and out, I had terrible experiences both times.  My first visit was with a group of 4 before a movie. We were seated right away and everything was great at first. However, we ordered our drinks and it took quite a while to get those, but we figured that everyone was busy serving others. We ordered our food and were excited. Myself and one of the others in our party ordered a steak -this is where it all went downhill. The steak was still very pink even though both of us ordered medium. Not only that but our mashed potatoes were cold. We still ate, not wanting to cause a scene. However no one checked up on us, even though we told them that we wanted the check plenty of times.  The second time, I went with a group of 6. This time, the food was better, HOWEVER, it took about an hour for them to ask our order, about another hour to get the food, and about another hour to get the check AFTER we asked for the check.  Now, I only give three stars because the staff was kind and patient, they had tables big enough for big groups, the restaurant and bathrooms were clean, and they did well on presentation. Honestly, I don't really recommend coming here unless you have a lot of time to pass."
