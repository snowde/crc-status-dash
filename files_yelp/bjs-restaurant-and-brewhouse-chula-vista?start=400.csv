Melissa M.,"San Diego, CA",598,426,173,2.0,5/4/2009,Will only come back for a pazookie! The pizza was gross! We ordered a deep dish pizza and first off the dough rose too much where there was nothing deep about it and it was under cooked! Gag! No sauce and hardly any cheese on the pizza! On the better side our salads were okay and we did have a really good server.
Frank R.,"Imperial Beach, CA",67,104,8,2.0,1/3/2012,This is a chain restaurant and it is just OK. The food is good and the beer selection is okay. There is nothing about this place that is special. I do like doing the beer tasting sampler with a cuban sandwich though.
Luis M.,"Chula Vista, CA",76,3,,1.0,11/11/2014,"Bad service and food. It took full half hour from the moment we got our seats until we actually got our drinks and appetizers then once they brought us our main courses, the food tasted stale or like it was thrown in the microwave."
Gerardo G.,"San Diego, CA",124,150,31,2.0,2/26/2015,"every raves about this place including my family, i can't say it's bad. i just didn't see it. it was like a chilis nothing more, i would have givin it a 3 star but the price was on the high side for what it was."
S K.,"Anaheim, CA",4,59,12,1.0,6/29/2013,Horrible service! We usually go to the one in Carlsbad and always get excellent service there. We went to the Chula Vista one and our server kept ignoring us his name was Fernando. He sucked!!!! Don't come here!!
Chris G.,"Imperial Beach, CA",3,2,3,1.0,11/30/2014,1 star is being generous. I came to this bjs restaurant on a sunday afternoon thinking.. yes service may be slow cause of football sunday. When I arrived it was slow and got seated right away. After being seated. . A big group was seated next to me within 5 minutes of waiting. I waited 15 minutes before walking up to a hostess to request a waiter to at least take a drink order. (I was ready to order as well). A few minutes after the hostess went to get the waiter. He arrived but went to the larger group completely ignoring me. Wow. I dont know if its just this restaurant or the chula vista mall but service is always horrendous here and at buffalo wild wings. I have nothing against the quality of the food.. hence coming here after a previous bad experience.. although is it too much for better service? A friendly tip for those thinking of coming here.. I'd call and order take out.. that way you wouldnt have to worry about being ignored.
Megan H.,"San Diego, CA",1,10,,1.0,11/21/2014,Worst experience ever. Server was so slow we had to go to the bar to get our own drinks. I was really disapointed with the overall demeaner of our server. Not even a little apologetic about how long it took for everything including how long it took us to even be greeted.  The 1 star is for Amanda the bartender and also the food runner that brought me some ranch. It would have taken 20 min to get ranch had I ordered it from my server.
Adam b.,"El Cajon, CA",0,5,,1.0,5/15/2015,Stood at the bar for almost 10 minutes before being acknowledged. The female bartender who appeared to be a manager asked if I had been helped. I told her I had not. She said she would send Daniel right over. 10 minutes later still no help. Gave up and left. Very poor customer service.
Nicolette P.,"Chula Vista, CA",52,9,2,4.0,4/8/2013,"Very nice staff, and fast service. Our waiter was very helpful and even helped me figure out what to get, he suggested a salad and I was thinking he probably never even tried  the salad himself, but he insisted he has it every time he works the lunch shift, so I got it and it was just as good as he said it would be. Clean , nice service, and great food!"
Dena C.,"Chula Vista, CA",18,9,1,1.0,3/6/2014,This place sucks save your money go to Taco Bell you will be more impressed . Came for late night happy hour bad move first we were served the wrong beers. Then they deliver my appetizers to the wrong table twice. I ordered avocado egg rolls they were okay and that's saying a lot . My husband ordered angus sliders umm please even at 5 dollars for that is too much I was cracking up looking at the picture of the sliders on the menu and what was before me . A 99cent McDouble has more meat then. These two sliders combined you can't even see the meat outside the bun it's a joke . I will never return here not even if someone else offered to pay that's a true story .
Mike R.,"San Diego, CA",210,54,230,2.0,10/18/2012,"I excepted so much more was very disappointed my waitress Tai was awesome tho and that's the only reason for the 2 stars well and the abundance the TVs and huge screen at the bar was nice but the ""FOOD"" was very average at best i had  Appetizers Buffalo Style Chicken Wontons - They were pretty good no complains. Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms-  Was very good they give you 6 for like 3 dollars. Mini-Bruschetta - Was good no complains. The Great thing about BJs Snacks and Small Bites are there they very inexpensive. Dinner Chicken Marsala- Everything was fine except the chicken it was all chewy ""WHAT THE HECK"" This ain't gum baby lol. Had to send it back to replace the chicken with shrimp. The shrimps were a better choice. Texas-Style Chicken Fried Steak- It was good not great the mashed potatoes were cold and the pepper cream gravy was suppose to be a cream color it was grayish  All in all i would go again but will just stick to the pizzas,burgers and beers from now on."
Car L.,"San Diego, CA",0,10,2,1.0,3/31/2015,Just got done eating here ... Leave the restaurant not even for 2'minutes... And remember I left 3/4 of my pizza in the to go box . And they tell me they threw it away!? Not even 2 minutes cmon BJs staff. Have some type of lee way before you throw away your customers food. Especially almost a whole freakin pizza. Horrible experience .Food was decent . Horrible server that's why we left . Stacking cups on the side of our table like it was a dish washer rack... Won't be back here
K R.,"La Mesa, CA",12,18,,2.0,5/27/2013,"I love BJ's, I just hate going to the one in Chula Vista!  Why do I go, because it is always empty, now I know why.  Two stars because the food is always consistent and pretty good for the price. Today's experience took the cake though; they were DEAD!  Maybe three tables with over 7 servers available.  Our waiter started out ok, but then it just went down hill.  We order, before any other table and when does our food come out?  LAST!  My husbands order was wrong, and the lovely man (sarcastic tone) who served it to us, tells us ""ya, that's what he wanted . . ."" and continues to walk away.  Very classy. You could tell our server was embarrassed and overworked (they did start to pick up).    However, say something, don't avoid us like the plague!  The manager stopped by the table behind us to apologize and comp half of their meal.  (So funny because we knew the people in the booth!) Next time, we will go to the one in La Mesa . . .you may have to wait but at least you get the attention of the server and feel well taken care of.  The Chula Vista store needs to get their act together . . ."
Valerie E.,"San Diego, CA",4,19,7,4.0,3/23/2014,The service was quick and friendly.  The BJ Brewhouse Blonde was light and crisp.  Can't wait to try some more beers and food.
Mari P.,"Lemon Grove, CA",0,5,,1.0,2/4/2013,"People are criticizing my former review of a particular bartender that works here. I understand that you may be friends with this particular bartender, but I saw what I saw, and I thought Yelp was an open and free place for us to give our honest reviews. With that being said, I will edit my review for you guys just to avoid all your feelings to get hurt.  For customers, please be aware that there are some unprofessional people working at BJ's. Other than this particular bartender, I had a wonderful experience at BJ's. The waitress was very kind and the food was excellent. But what I saw the bartender do was disgusting, and extremely unprofessional. So for those of you who want to write me back and say ""your a retard"" (when really, it is *you're)  and also call me uneducated and ridiculous, that's fine. I get that you are friends with this bartender and want to stick up for her. You're entitled to your own opinion, but I saw what I saw. Thanks."
Lizette G.,"Chula Vista, CA",23,23,10,1.0,11/15/2013,Horrible service ever! My girls and I went to have a birthday/ going away dinner and we had just the most horrible experience ever. Waiters were not attentive to us at all. Took forever to even check on us while we had empty cups and no more food. We ordered more appitizers but she got our order wrong and it was so upsetting. I love eating here but never again will I go and spend money on shitty service.
Nohemi W.,"San Diego, CA",15,17,1,3.0,3/11/2014,I would usually give it 5 stars but today was the first time I got slow service. It took about an hour to get my food. It was not that busy.
margaret g.,"Bonita, CA",9,44,3,2.0,8/11/2014,"Stopped in for a Cobb Salad at lunch. The server offered the lunch portion at $9.95 or Full portion at $11.95. I ordered the full portion saying I'd take the rest home for dinner. Wow - that wasn't going to happen. My salad was smaller than 1/2 salads I've had anywhere else. In fact I asked the server if I had been given the lunch portion accidentally, but she assured me that wasn't the case, stating ""it's just a new dish that makes it look smaller"". Uh huh, real small. There was maybe 1/2 tablespoon of bacon, and 3 thin slices of avocado. I was still hungry when I finished my $12 salad. That's a first. I'll definitely go to the Brig for the 1/2 crab & shrimp Louie next time."
Eva A.,"National City, CA",23,132,40,2.0,10/12/2010,"So disappointed with this location considering my meal was a solid 4-star worthy. My boyfriend and I walked into this location on a Monday night looking for a meal with the occasional alcoholic beverage. After waiting around for a hostess to appear we were seated and had a good view of various flat screen tvs with the Monday Night Football game on (always a plus).  After looking at the menus the hostess had given us and wondering why we had been sitting there for 10-15 minutes without our sever even coming to our table yet to introduce himself or ask for drinks it finally occurred to the other severs we were staring down that hey, we haven't had any service. Finally our server who shall remain nameless made his way over and asked for our drink order. By that time we were already fully aware of what we wanted to eat so we placed our order and our alcoholic drinks came shortly after.  I ordered the Mango Tango with a Turkey Burger (which came with my choice of thin-cut fries) and my boyfriend ordered an Oktoberfest beer with the Scampi Pasta (which came with garlic bread). My mixed drink didn't taste the greatest with the basil leafs it included but as soon as I took those out the taste improved. The Turkey Burger however was on point, very delicious and the thin-cut fries with ranch dressing is always a winner in my book. My boyfriend enjoyed the brew however his Pasta which I had a bite of was dry and lacked flavor. About this time we were waiting around again for our sever to appear as I was getting thirsty and wanted to order a Diet Soda. However after another 15 minutes of waiting around I finally decided to get up and asked another sever with blonde hair for my drink and apologized for having to ask her but that I had no idea where my sever had went. She gladly brought out my drink and 5 minutes later our sever decided to show up and ask us if we needed anythng which we asked for the check before he could take off again. He informed us his shift was ending and that another waiter would be taking over for him and handling our check. I'm usually a very generous tipper however the service we received from our waiter was terrible that I felt like I shouldn't have left any gratuity (but I did leave a small amount for the drink and quality of the meal). Thank you to the blonde waitress who showed us your courtesy and actually came to our table a few times just to check on us. Next time however we'll get our meals to go or visit another location to dine in."
Joyce M.,"San Diego, CA",26,12,,4.0,4/9/2011,"This was my second time for lunch at this BJ's. It's not as crowded and loud like the others I've been to. It's a nice atmosphere with good food for business lunches! The service was good. We were seated right away.Our server took the time to answer our questions and gave his honest opinion on certain dishes. We got our food quickly as well. I love how their menu has printed calories for the health conscious. The ""light"" menu options are the best I've seen in any restaurant. I chose the flatbread pizza from this menu with a small house salad. The pizza was a good long size. It was also delicious. I couldn't even eat it all! Overall, great place for a power lunch!"
