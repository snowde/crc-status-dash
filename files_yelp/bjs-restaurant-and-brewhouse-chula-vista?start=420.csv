Ryan S.,"Chula Vista, CA",15,21,5,3.0,1/22/2014,"Tasty calamari. Too much residual oil and become greasy and soggy on the plate. Good flavored aoli, marinara was pointless"
Stevo P.,"Winter Gardens, San Diego, CA",9,7,1,5.0,1/16/2014,This place is the best sit at the bar and ask for Michelle. She's the coolest bartender always helping me and my girl when we go in there. Order a Jeremiah red with a BBQ chicken pizza.
Suzie M.,"Chula Vista, CA",5,51,1,4.0,10/21/2013,"We like it!  They have gluten free options for the hubster, yummy apps, unique beers.  We are fans!"
Marica A.,"San Diego, CA",44,20,22,4.0,12/9/2012,I came here a couple of weeks back & I was pretty satisfied with this place. Got seats right away. I had this Hawaiian Mahi with rice thing & it was really good. Service was great. I'd definitely come back here.
Lynn M.,"San Diego, CA",25,3,,1.0,10/28/2012,Had the worst service today. I believe our servers name was Tim. He did a great job at refilling our drink but the time waiting to order was too long.
Joanna S.,"San Diego, CA",6,70,17,4.0,2/12/2011,"I've been to other BJ's and this one was just the same. I love consistency when going to a chain restaurant. Service was great. Food came quick. The server came back to see if we needed anything a couple times which is perfect. I can't stand when they don't come back at all and you need refills, napkins, ect. or when they come up to your table again and again nagging you so you can't enjoy your meal and company. Well this was the perfect amount :) I like how they put how many calories in each dish right on the menu. Most of the dishes are my entire daily allowance though! But it does help make a healthier decision. Fish tacos were great and not too high in the caloric value! This place is pretty good."
Mia M.,"Bonita, CA",1,15,,1.0,8/31/2014,"Came to dinner tonight with my boyfriend (after he was craving pizookie). The hostess told us we could sit in the bar area where it was open seating. We ended up sitting at a booth near the bar. Absolute worst customer service I have ever had!! Her name was Candice B. Don't get me wrong.. She was very attentive and nice to my boyfriend, but was very rude to me. She never asked me if I wanted another glass of wine, never asked how my food was and when I asked her for ranch, she looked at me and said ""what's up"" with a rude look. I felt extremely uncomfortable and my boyfriend noticed how rude she was being. He instantly asked  for the check after he saw how uncomfortable I was and how rude she was. (He never got to eat his pizookie he was craving) I honestly felt like she knew me and just hates my guts. After working the restaurant industry for over 8 years and serving.. I know how to treat customers. This was such a horrible experience. . I will not be returning to this location."
Aya G.,"Lemon Grove, CA",9,69,25,2.0,7/8/2013,"I usually go to La mesa BJ's but I was in the area and decided to stop by since we had a Facebook deal. We were seated fairly quickly however, once we were seated it was about 6-7 minutes before anyone even came by to greet us. Several servers passed us and I was not able to get anyone's attention. Once the server came by (no personality or apology) she took our order. we waited a long wait for our drinks  and  food. I don't know what happened to BJ's or if its just this location but I have never been disappointed with the food. THe dressing tasted watered down. The Shrimp tacos were zero taste and the worst hard no flavor tortillas served with a few measly chips on the side. They overcharged us for something and forgot to bring out one of our sides. Our original server left and was taken over by Chantil, who was a sweetheart and did her best to make up for the few things she could help."
Amber A.,"Pasadena, CA",92,25,14,3.0,8/25/2011,"Celebrated a friend's birthday here. They gave her a little candle-lit bazookie (cookie+ice cream) in celebration :] I ate their chicken bbq deep dish pizza, and it was pretty good. Their mango mojito was good too, tasted like juice! Overall good modernized atmosphere, a-ok service. It's located at the end of the Chula Vista Mall so parking is a-plenty! Tips for big groups: 1. They only allow up to 2 credit card charges when splitting the bill. 2. They 'supposedly' had a 2 hour limit, but I swear we stayed longer."
Erwin G.,"Chula Vista, CA",57,98,31,3.0,6/27/2013,"Piranha Pale Ale was good, ribs were good, and try the tortilla soup."
Gail C.,"Chula Vista, CA",14,31,6,2.0,3/10/2013,"As Chula Vista resident, I often return to BJ's for a relaxing and consistent dinner.  However, my experience tonight changed all of my feelings towards this.    When we arrived, there was a 10-15 minute wait, but there were plenty of open tables.   I don't understand why you wouldn't seat people if you have open tables at 6:00 pm. on a Saturday night.                                                                                           I ordered the steak salad with the roasted vegetables, and my husband had the jalapeno burger.   My salad arrived with no roasted vegetables and the portion was the size of a side salad not a salad entree.   After waiting several minutes, I was able to flag down our waitress and point this out to her.  She grabbed my salad to take it back, but I requested that she just bring a side of roasted vegetable.  5 minutes later she comes out a small portion of steamed vegetables and throws them on the table and leaves.   I went ahead and ate.   My husband's burger was ""OK"", but a jalapeno burger is supposed to be spicy.    He said it was not spicy and not a whole lot of flavor   Truthfully the one at Carl's Jr. was better.   Back to my salad.  When the waitress returned, I told her how disappointed I was with the salad and the vegetables not being roasted, but we were on a time crunch, so I ate it.  She had the manager ""Spencer"" comes over, and he apologized.   I fully expected it to be taken off the bill, but the waitress comes back and tells us ""Spencer is buying you desert!'   No thanks, we need to get somewhere, so she gives me a coupon for a free dessert for the next time we come in.   Big deal, I doubt if there will be a next time."
Kassandra R.,"Bend, OR",99,67,67,2.0,12/26/2012,Food's ok. Not the most amazing thing in the world. Waitress sucked. We had a party of 6 not big at all. It wasn't a busy day either. She just had this attitude with us. It's your job as a waiter/waitress to keep customers happy. Complete disaster with the steak. Its was over cooked. Took forever just to get water.
Michelle V.,"San Diego, CA",66,41,8,1.0,5/23/2014,"I went here for lunch with my son. We were seated right away. Plenty of staff, no common sense. We asked for water, the waitress said, ""OK."" She went over to the register while she chatted with her co-worker for a long time. I made it obvious we were ready to order, she said, ""Yeah, just a sec,"" and kept on chatting. I was so disappointed. I went back cause my husband and I went here on date night when it was busy and the food was good, but they lost my business when the many people who were on duty kept walking past me and my 8 year old ignoring us with snooty attitudes. It wasn't busy; they should've at least brought us our water. Just in case you're wondering; my son is very quiet and shy, so it's not like maybe they were annoyed by a screaming child. We wound up leaving after sitting for 25 (yeah that's right) 25 minutes of being ignored... Still angry, my son was starving!!!!"
Will M.,"Imperial Beach, CA",0,51,1,4.0,2/22/2015,I like this place . I go there on my lunch break . Their lunch menu is great . Try out the bbq platter . Great price with big portion . Service is friendly and fast
Roxy D.,"La Mesa, San Diego, CA",0,37,79,3.0,11/24/2013,"Our waiter was really nice and you can tell he was trying but the service was just too slow. Only ordered a round of drinks and some wings... Everything took a few minutes longer than it should. Just seemed like our waiter was in training or something. And not much team effort here, not one other person stopped by at our table to check on us or anything?! I had to ask for napkins too, which usually is a given with buffalo wings!"
Angie A.,"San Diego, CA",111,62,188,5.0,10/2/2012,"Happy hour specials are served only at the bar. My favorites are the mac & cheese, chicken wraps, calamari & stuffed mushrooms. The beer selection is exceptional. The burgers are delicious and the special finale, the original pazooki is the best dessert ever!"
Jaygee G.,"Bonita, CA",76,25,2,1.0,1/2/2014,I have tried to give this place a chance plenty of times but it always ends up the same.  HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE and cold food.
Maria T.,"Anaheim, CA",451,509,526,5.0,4/19/2011,"I think I just noticed this the last time I came in - their portions are really big! I'm pretty sure you get your money's worth eating at any BJ's restaurant (or maybe it's just this specific one). I order a cesear salad as a side and it was still too much AND I ordered it to go with my pot roast! Too much fooooooooood, but it's soooo goooood!!"
Jocelyn C.,"Chula Vista, CA",68,88,1,2.0,11/24/2012,"I wish I had better things to say about this place!  Who doesn't love the Pizookie?  That is probably their saving grace.  Service-wise our server was pleasant and nice enough, but it just seemed like that was about it.  Not very engaging, but maybe it was because we were a big party on a Friday night?  He forgot to put in our order for the flatbread pizza.   We ordered small bites; spinach stuffed mushrooms, bruschetta, and meatballs...I have had better.  One of the people we were with was not feeling well, tried to order hot tea but apparently they ran out of tea.  Offered her hot water, lemon, and honey, which she accepted but then charged her for tea anyway.  What was that about?  She did get that taken off the bill, but it shouldn't have been there in the first place.  Don't think I'll be back here for a while..."
Juje J.,"San Diego, CA",97,563,290,2.0,5/19/2011,"Not the best place in the world to watch Sporting Events.  Don't get me wrong, because I love the beer they serve over here. And some of the dishes that I've eaten here are pretty decent. I can rave on and on about their flatbread pizza's because they are extremely delicious. Unfortunately, what I can't deal with at this restaurant is the DISCO/TECHNO Music they play while these sporting events are on the tube...and trust me, I've seen scenario played over and over again. I will come back here again for Happy Hour cause it's fun to hang out with friends...I will not however, come here whenever there's an NBA Playoff Game, NFL Season Game or a College Football Game.  Unless ofcourse BJ's decides to become a REAL SPORTS BAR and Turn off the DISCO."
