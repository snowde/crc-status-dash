Melissa H.,"Chula Vista, CA",217,188,36,1.0,10/18/2012,"Ok, so this was my first time here and it will be my last! The service and food are terrible. I called ahead for a pick up order. I should have known better and hung up after being on hold for 5 minutes. But hey my dad really wanted to try this place. The lady said it'll be ready in 15 minutes. Ok I get there 30 minutes later and it takes 10 minutes to get a greeting let alone some one to tell me that pick orders are around the corner, to my surprise no one is at the counter and the phone is ringing off the hook. A nice lady finally ask if I need help. I tell her I have a pick up order, she checks on the order and its not ready yet even after 40 minutes from placing it originally. I was surprised. Finally I get my order and go home. The pizza was lack of toppings and the crust was hard, not to mention cold! Very small for a large as well. NEVER AGAIN."
Jessica C.,"Chula Vista, CA",44,139,92,3.0,1/19/2011,"My experiences here have been just okay. Service was okay - not great, but not terrible. I absolutely LOVE their oreo pizookie.  I ALWAYS have to order it every time I come here.  It's the main reason I ever come here. Their pizzas are decent, but nothing that special. Big baked potatoes are good. Honestly, the best thing about this place is the pizookie. hands down!  If you go here & don't try a pizookie, any flavor, you'll regret it."
david s.,"San Diego, CA",64,189,34,5.0,6/14/2013,good food and decent quality beers on tap. The service is exceptional and the place doesnt seem pretentious. Definitely return here to get that pizookie dessert thingie.
Marc L.,"San Diego, CA",56,7,5,4.0,6/19/2011,Jambalaya was bomb n so was the bacon cheeseburger pizza . Nice lookin place a little pricy gotta get the oreo pizzookie !! Not that crowded for fathers day !!! Pizza taste like a cheeseburger n jambalaua is spicy very good
Keith H.,"San Diego, CA",10,92,,2.0,4/9/2013,Been to many different BJ's restaurants and frequent the one in Thousand Oaks and this one is not a good one.  The service is horrible.  Food is similar to the others but the service really makes the difference. I don't know if I will continue going to this one. It is so poor.
Alexa G.,"Chula Vista, CA",5,51,57,2.0,3/24/2013,I love BJ's!!! But this location sucks! Me and my friend went on a Thursday night and it was super busy. We were seated within 20 minutes and ordered drinks shortly after. We waited about another 20 minutes for our drinks and by that time we were ready to order so we ordered our food. Both of our dishes came with salads so we expected to receive them shortly. We waited a good 30 minutes before we finally got our salads. After that it took ANOTHER 30 minutes to get our entrees. When we were finished and ready to go it took forever to get checked out. We waited 20 minutes to get the actual check and another 20 minutes to pay and get our receipts back. It felt like we were in there for HOURS!!!! We left as soon as we could. I will never go to this location again..
aremy b.,"El Cajon, CA",0,11,,3.0,9/30/2012,Came here for a friends birtday on august 28th. I must admit we got excellent service but our food wasnt that great.  This location is still my favorite over the la mesa location.  so our waiter was Armando. He was very friendly and was ontop of everything specially refills!  so i ordered the fettuccini alfredo and the house salad. my croutons tasted like a piece of tofu extemely stale. my friends croutons as well! half of the croutons were good half were like soake in water and chewy. my pasta was decent we also ordered chips and salsa. after the croutons being old i felt like the salsa looked recycled but im pretty sure i was just being paranoid lol  5stars for service but 3 stars on their food.  parking is always good & i'll definitely be back
Claudia G.,"San Francisco, CA",13,19,,4.0,8/20/2010,"BJ's is always a good time...the hostess and the waitress were all genuinely friendly (this is always a plus because you can't find it everywhere)   Food is always pretty good here too...I ordered the strawberry lemonade and it was ok.. I've had better (no strawberries but other than that it was good) I also ordered the grilled chicken club and it was delish, wedge cut fries were also pretty darn good.  My friends ordered the southwestern deep dish pizza and OMG it was pretty amazing...I'm plain and I usually only like pepperoni pizza but this new one is very very yum..an ounce of spiciness and the chicken make it a favorite for me....next time I go i'm ordering it! We were to full for dessert since their portions are pretty big but i've had the pizookie and its yummy."
ruby w.,"Los Angeles, CA",20,325,688,4.0,12/18/2009,"Friday night and this place was packed with a small crowd waiting to be seated. Our wait was about 15 - 20 minutes, which is not a problem if I had not walked to the bathroom (about 10 minutes in) and notice that there were at least 2-3 empty tables ready to be seated and the hostesses were just holding everyone up.  Our server was nice and courteous and the food is actually decent, but overpriced in my opinion. Good thing we took advantage of the ""Holiday Special"" -- they have a coupon on their front page ( ) Dinner for two which includes soup or salad, one medium deep dish pizza and a choice of pizzokie to share. Not a bad deal considering one medium pizza alone usually runs for about $20.00. So, basically you are getting two soup and a pizzokie on the house.  Clam Chowder -- surprisingly good. Nice and creamy with lots of clams. Overly salty towards the end. Big bowl.   Tomato Bisque -- tasted a lot like spaghetti sauce. Creamy and sweet. Manage to eat about half and I was good.  Great White Deep-Dish (medium) -- like with most deep dish pizzas, it was really bready. I love the toppings -- mushroom, cheese, tomato, with chicken breast. Excellent flavor and filing. Did not look very oily, but I know looks can be deceiving. The pizza had a nice soft and bouncy texture -- like fresh bread. We were each comfortably full with 1 slice each so plenty of leftovers. Chocolate Chunk Pizzokie -- Basically an under-cooked chocolate chip cookie with vanilla bean ice cream. I remember having it once and thought it tasted much better before. Warm cookie dough complemented with vanilla ice cream well. A few bites and you feel that it becomes too sweet. The outer rim is crustier than the middle part. I am officially OVER pizzokies.  Coupon expires 01/08/2010 so hurry in and catch the deal if you love their deep dish pizzas. DM me with your e-mail address if you have trouble accessing  the coupon (they might take it off before it expires)."
Jessica D.,"San Diego, CA",16,64,,1.0,6/19/2014,horrible service. knew i shouldve listened to yelp when i saw all the reviews. and our waiter was highhhh! he kept forgetting everything... its true it takes liek 20-30 mins for your food even if its not busy. it made me not ever wanna go back!.. smh-________-
Joel G.,"San Diego, CA",48,102,17,1.0,12/30/2009,"I just got back from BJ's in Chula Vista and wanted to rant about the lack of food, horrible service, and awful food.  First the lack of food. We ordered the pumpkin ale beer... The told us that the beer was all sold out. Then we tried ordering a ""medium"" white pizza. And guess what? That pizza crust is sold out! So i'm assuming the pizza isn't made fresh. Very disappointing.  The service was horrible as well. They didn't have silverware set up for us. Our food took forever to get and it wasn't really worth the wait. My calzone was gross. It didn't even look like a calzone. It looked more like a pot pie. And the ""small"" white pizza my brothers ordered wasn't great. The chicken wasn't even grill more like microwave. The menu mentioned of alfredo sauce in the white pizza. But there was no sign of it. Really Really Awful.  Lastly, it took several reminders to get our check from the waitress. I've gone to several BJ's and this one is awful! Here's the kicker, it wasn't even that busy.  I would not recommend this BJ's at all. The food is awful and the service is beyond poor! I hope the Shaky's that they just opened in the mall is better."
J N.,"San Diego, CA",0,5,,1.0,11/7/2014,"First of all, our server Kary was great, 5 *'s for her, the rest of the experience was not so great. I had 4 drinks, no consistency in any of the drinks. 1 skinny Cosmo, ooh, al 6 ozs of it.  3 skinny Margs, one tasted good, second too much sour, third, too much sweet..  Food....if you like it salty, you'll love this place.  Ordered two apps, 1 spring rolls, 1 chk lettuce wraps.  Spring rolls came to the table room temperature and no taste.  Lettuce wraps came w/ 4 pcs of lettuce and an 8 oz ramadan of chicken/filler, good for about 1 tablespoon of filling for each wrap.  Again tasteless and barely warm.  Sent both back, Kary and mgr were both gracious and accommodating.  To replace the poor food, we ordered potato skins and garlic parmesan boneless wings (at $1/ea), barely a taste of parmesan, no taste of garlic...but plenty of salt for taste.  The skins were crunchy outside, but mushy inside...like the oil they were fried in wasn't hot enough, so they just absorbed the oil. Again, Kary our server was great.  She knew the menu well, very nice and was always there with a smile.  I thank her, but unfortunately, we won't be back to BJ's."
Oz T.,"Chula Vista, CA",1,132,6,2.0,4/13/2011,"Are they trying to be the cheesecake factory...? The place to go if you do not want to feel important I made my first trip to BJ's on Saturday night. 5 staff members were waiting at the hostess table none of them were willing to talk to us..  Great start.  Based on their specials board I ordered the two of their specials... I am happy to say that I only ate half because the fish was still frozen and the shrimp was just Blah.  My wife liked her sandwich i guess however we agreed that nothing was outstanding..  The servers took forever to get anything, drink refills took longer than Hayley's comet..  On the whole very forgettable place.. Food was a C, atmosphere probably a B service .. ha ha what service I could not even get my credit card back in less than 5 minutes.. I wonder why the place was only half full on Saturday night.. The Cheese cake factory, without good food and great service.. (just go to the cheese cake factory)"
Kendrick S.,"Chula Vista, CA",333,21,3,4.0,2/15/2013,"Love this place, love the happy hour. Hate the wait."
Mr. E.,"Chula Vista, CA",6,9,,5.0,2/1/2012,"Delirium tremens and crispy jalapeno burger, awesome!"
Mark G.,"Chula Vista, CA",104,135,4,1.0,11/29/2009,"F THIS PLACE! I've given this place too many chances to redeem themselves for their: -bad service -bad managment Does it really take 1 hour to tell us that they ran out of big potatoes? Does it really take 30 minutes to give us our pizookies?  Cmon seriously... This place is a joke. Food is good, but service is as bad as it can get."
Brandon B.,"Norfolk, VA",5,43,6,4.0,12/31/2012,First time eating here i was impressed with the Cheesecake Factory like menu (ton of options and items) the beers were good and food was out fast and everything was great. Also you have to get the cookie dessert!
Vanessa W.,"San Diego, CA",10,19,9,2.0,12/12/2012,Im writing this on behalf of my hubby....He stopped by BJs yesterday evening.  The wait was extremely long and the restaurant wasn't that busy.  After the order was placed it took way too long for the food to arrive.  By the time the food came it was cold.  So basically he waited a long time for cold food.  Not good.
Alex R.,"San Diego, CA",80,90,5,3.0,11/25/2012,"Good for a chain... Service is alright, but it's expected..."
Ryan B.,"West Covina, CA",34,172,,3.0,9/5/2010,"First off, Ive also been to the Carlsbad and Escondido locations and the experiences are all the same. BJ's is always a fun place to go.  Good atmosphere, nice beers for a large chain brewery.  I'll always come back for those elements.  Food is usually quite good and Ive never ever had problems. The serivce, while always friendly, has been SLOOOOWWWW.  It took 10 minutes for our drinks to come out, and we were sitting at the bar tables.  Wait for tables was also long, so be aware if you are coming on a weekend or Friday night.  Despite negative reviews, lots of people do show up. So if you want to take your time, get drunk, catch up with someone, or watch a game, this is the place.  If you are on a time crunch, BJ's won't work."
