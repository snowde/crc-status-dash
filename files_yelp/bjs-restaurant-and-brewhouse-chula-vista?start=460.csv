Joshua P.,"San Diego, CA",0,3,,1.0,5/18/2012,"So if you find your heading over to BJ's in chula vista mall, make sure your not in FERNANDO'S section. Really bad waiter, lazy and forgetful and has to many excuses. His favorite one is ""I ordered it"""
Pablo P.,"National City, San Diego, CA",283,12,,2.0,2/11/2013,The only reason I have this place two stars is for the pazookie And the decor since its a nice looking restaurant. Everything is terrible and expensive.
Zeke T.,"Chula Vista, CA",179,15,2,1.0,1/18/2010,"This was our second time there and I just waited for the review. The first time the place was OK buy we had a little incident. The waitress dropped a wine glass and the bits of glass splattered everywhere making a small cut to one of us. The manager came and never apologized or anything. He just said accidents happen and went on. We do understand that but it was an employee error. A little customer service would've been nice. The second time we went for a Chargers game. Firs, for a bar with huge screens all around, you consider this a sports bar. Well, they never raised the volume because they were a ""Family"" restaurant and they couldn't. Then we ordered a pitcher of beer that took 1 hour exactly to get to our table. When I asked the waiter why he gave attitude saying the bar had problems and they were busy. Again, customer service is no where to be found in this place. Needless to say we will NEVER go back and do not recommend the place at all"
Berenice D.,"Chula Vista, CA",399,215,64,3.0,6/1/2010,BJ's is just a typical brewery. It is cool. I haven't had much of their food but I can say I've had the thin pizzas and those were so yummy. I love their beer selection and the happy hour.  I normally sit at the bar with my friend. I love how they have hooks to hang your purse. Check it out if you have not seen that yet. Others than having old men sit next to you at the bar trying to listen to your conversation...and knowing me my conversations can sometimes be inappropriate....having strangers creep up is not cool.  I've had the nachos before and those are just NEVER ENDING. TOO MUCH. I also tried the shrimp tacos and those are def not that good. Only like one shrimp per taco.  I will be back since its so close to my house. Not too bad.
Mary W.,"Las Vegas, NV",160,69,260,3.0,10/4/2009,My co-workers decided to take me out for a late BDAY celebration last saturday to BJ's. It was a very nice place. The hostess there looked so much like Uma Thurman I almost asked for an autograph!!! The waitress who served us seemed to want to get rid of us as soon as possible...(Maybe because some of us were louder than others)...but still she kinda sucked! I don't like beer whatsoever so I just opted to get a cosmo...typical but they don't have the greatest mixed drink menu because it is a brewhouse. We had some sort of avocado egg roll or something like that....that was pretty good with a little bit of spice to it...for the main course I ordered the balsamic chicken which was very VERY YUMMY!!! And the PIZOOKIE was so fricken GOOD! It made me forget about the waitress for a little while! Overall...I give food a 5 star and service 2. I would go there again for the food...but not anytime soon because of the service...I probably would have enjoyed the place a little more if we had a different wait-person and had I increased my blood-alcohol level.
Jarvis G.,"San Diego, CA",8,24,8,1.0,12/30/2009,"I gave this particular BJs restaurant many chances to redeem themselves, but alas I have come to the conclusion that this place sucks.   I just recently discovered that they do not make their pizza crusts fresh.  My bros ordered a medium pizza and our waitress told us that they ran out of medium pizza crusts!   Apparently, they use frozen pizza crusts and their chefs dont know how to make pizza at all.  Our pizza we ordered was the Mediterrean pizza which tasted like it was microwaved.  It was really soggy in the middle and ingredients used were sub-par.  In addition, my brothers ordered the Great White pizza which claims to have alfredo sauce -- but no alfredo sauce was found in the pizza.  It had a marinara sauce that was disappointing.      The beers we ordered were decent, but they didn't have the pumpkin ale available.  For a place that claims to be a brewery/restaurant, not having a seasonal beer is disappointing. The service was another disappointment.  We split our party in two since we arrived early.  The other party had 15+ people that arrived 15-20 minutes later than we did.  Although, we had a head start in our food and drinks we noticed that we were ignored and the other group was catered and served more than us.  We didn't receive our appetizer plates until after we received our appetizers and our waitress took her sweet time in giving us our check after many requests. After this horrible experience, I wondered what I did to deserve such a punishment.  Avoid this place like its the black plague -- dont be tempted by its bright lights and fancy spinning entrance door.  I really miss the Unos that used to be in Chula Vista Center."
Ryan L.,"San Diego, CA",3,12,,2.0,11/18/2010,"After enjoying our BJ's experience at the La Mesa restaurant, we decided to try it again in Chula Vista.  I can't say that we were very impressed the second time around. Long waits and substandard food was what we got.  I decided to go with the California Burger since I enjoyed the Bacon Cheeseburger Pizza so much the first time.  What I got was more of a sandwich than a burger.  Bread instead of bun, no lettuce or tomatoes, and the size was pretty pathetic.  The fries were the better part of my meal.  My wife went with the flavorless Cajun Pasta with shrimp & chicken.  They forgot to include the chicken, but didn't forget to charge us for it. I think it's safe to say we won't be eating at this BJ's again."
Jeannette C.,"Chula Vista, CA",3,13,1,1.0,5/29/2013,"I generally ALWAYS tip. Even if the service is horrible, I'll at least round out to the nearest whole dollar. However if the service is great I usually tip over 20% This Sunday, May 26th, 2013, I took my little cousin and nephew to BJ's for some ice cream after the movies at the Chula Vista Mall. Personally I dislike this BJ's because they always have TERRIBLE service. Of the 4 times I've been there I think I only had good service once. Still I went in with an open mind cuz we weren't ""hungry"" and it was the closest place to go for some ice cream and I figured 3 desserts wouldn't take long... After sitting there for 7 minutes without a greeting (yes I kept track of the time from the minute we were seated! This ain't my first time at the rodeo. I know their service sucks, I wanted to compare THIS trip to others I've had there) a server who was walking past and noticed the ANNOYED look on my face greeted us and said he'd find our server. I let him know we were just there for dessert and HE graciously took our order (I wish I'd gotten his name so I could at least put ONE positive thing on here!) Another 5 minutes passed before our server appeared and brought us out the water I'd asked for. She then said she'd put in our dessert order and it would be out shortly. So here is the point where I need to clarify a few things.... Number one, the section we were seated in was clearly marked because I saw the server who took our order bouncing between his tables and not crossing the imaginary line until he greeted us. The table behind us was leaving and the only other seated table in our section was already eating. So unless our server was also cooking in the kitchen, our section didn't appear busy, so I have no idea where the heck OUR server was or what on earth she was doing! Number two, I was a server many moons ago. I ordered a warm dessert so it might have needed to be heated up for a few minutes. But the kids literally had 2 scoops of ice cream with whipped cream and chocolate sauce. So from having done it myself in the past I persoanlly know that desserts do not take long to prepare. Which brings me to 25 minutes after we were sat and our server said she'd put in the order for our desserts, they were brought out. The kids loved theirs and mine was disgusting. $6.50 for a bunch of warm berries in a tin with ice cream melting on top of it. I literally had to get up to go look at a menu because I SWORE the description of my dessert included some sort of ""crumble"" in with the berries. Plus I'd had that dessert before. There is usually more to it than just warm berries! At that point I just wanted to leave and not touch anything and not pay but the kids were excited about their sundaes. So I made the decision that I just wouldn't tip. A decision I never make lightly because as I said, I was a server before and remember what that feels like. Since I've been screwed over before where a disgruntled, horrible server over charged my card, I distinctly WROTE out the word ZERO where it says tip on the receipt to avoid any confusion or over charge to my card. This morning, I checked my bank statement and SURE ENOUGH where I had only authorized BJ's to charge $9.45 to my card, they decided it would be ok to round up to $10. I know that's only a 55 cent difference, but I don't care. I didn't authorize that charge and am APPALLED that they had the audacity to feel they can charge me whatever they want even though I SPECIFICALLY signed a statement saying I would authorize a lesser charge. So not only will I be calling my bank and filing complaint of a FRAUDULENT charge to my card. I am going to personally walk in to BJ's this afternoon and speak to the manager in the hopes that at the very least our server ""Jessica"" will be reprimanded for her theft, if not Fired!  I can't believe someone would jeopardize their job over 55 cents!"
Alee B.,"Carlsbad, CA",603,32,315,3.0,8/26/2009,"Two stars for the pizookie and one star for their beer selection with about 20 on tap even though we drink everything BUT the BJ beers. So I think we can all agree upon that the service sucks.  There were like 4 cocktailers on with about 8 tables and it took me and my boyfriend 2 hours to get through our meal (and it wasn't because we're slow eaters).   Let me tell you a funny story.  Last time we were there, we saw these two young girls at the bar getting hit on by for the most obnoxious middle-aged, overweight men we've seen in Chula Vista.  One dorky guy with glasses was basically sprawled on the bar so that he could get in on the conversation.  One of the other middle-aged men had his hands down one of the girls pants.  Her friend told the guy to smell his finger... and by golly he did!  It was a pretty sad and desperate , but hey, it gave my boyfriend and I some laughs and we're sharing it with all of you."
Jenny B.,"San Diego, CA",58,102,25,1.0,4/6/2009,"One star ONLY for the yummy pizookies. Only reason why I come back. Been here a few times and every time the service was terrible. Even when the place is slow, they suck. C'mon now. Perhaps the staff needs a lot more training before they are put out there to provide, what should be, excellent customer service. Even a little above average would be okay! Ugghhh. Some unfortunate experiences - waiter forgot my friend's order of root beer float and fries, waiter waited half an hour to tell a group of us that they had run out of what we ordered and then got my second order wrong. WTF. And then they just take too damn long to refill waters, serve food, and give the bill. This place is not worth it."
Andrew A.,"North Bay Terraces, San Diego, CA",1,6,2,1.0,11/9/2013,"This is the worst experience I have ever had at a restraunt. First the host . Then I order my food the waiter comes back saying they no longer serve that. Wtf then why is it on the menu, then the food takes forever to come out and it's not really busy when it finally gets here my order is wrong. Instead of leaving it and apologizing he takes it and it takes 15 more min for the girl waiter to bring the right food. Never did they apologize or try in any way to make up. I will never eat here again."
Ed M.,"San Diego, CA",334,978,840,2.0,2/13/2012,"Where to begin.  My trip here started off nice enough.  Went to the bar, got a drink, and waited a bit for some friends to show.  Wait was about 30 minutes.  The hostess was nice and let me know in a timely manner when the table would clear out.  Everything after that...well...let's see.  Appetizers took about another half hour to show up...the food took another half hour to forty five minutes to come out.  By that time I was pretty annoyed as I was ready to eat.  There was a decent crowd but seriously...not enough to warrant that kind of waiting for food.  I ordered a chicken fettucine dish.  When it finally came out it was the blandest pasta I've ever eaten...EVER.  The only taste to it was the burnt chicken pieces that came with the pasta.  I never came close to finishing that dish.  The only highlights were that the beer was fresh (I got a hef) and the dessert a friend ordered was good...the pizzookie which is a giant pizza sized cookie with vanilla ice cream on top.  We had two servers through out the night as our original server left for her break. The second server copped an attitude when we informed her we wanted separate checks and said ""You should've told me before I got the final check for your table.""  We informed her we told the first server that and she said she never got that message.  Wow.  Slow ass service with an attitude to boot.  Too bad I'm most likely never coming back here.  That rude server at the end pretty much killed any points this restaurant had left."
Dexter T.,"Chula Vista, CA",41,58,83,4.0,5/24/2009,"After a movie, my best friends and I wanted a late night snack, so we headed over to BJ's which was still open at 11PM. This was my second occasion eating at BJ's and my first visit to the Chula Vista location. I had such an awesome time here(mostly due to wacky friends and outrageous jokes), but the food was quite good and the drinks were amazing. I ordered a sourdough burger with fries and a root beer. The burger was good, but I have to point out that the root beer was quite possibly the best root beer I've ever had. It was amazing and almost... creamy. The waitress did point out that it was also brewed on site. The service was good and fast. The host seated us in a nice booth right away. Our waitress was attentive and friendly. She would return on occasion to ask if there was anything else we would like. The only minus worth mentioning was the wait for the food. We did keep asking ourselves when our food was going to get there, but the root beer and beer kept us happy. Oh, and I don't remember seeing any silverware or napkins on the table. We really didn't need any for our food (hand-food), so we didn't ask, but it's a given that you need silverware and napkins at any restaurant. I do remember having to wipe my mouth with the bar napkin. The ambiance, decor and entertainment was very pleasing. Very, very nice looking restaurant. I dig. I'm looking forward to returning here with my good friends for good times and good eats. Despite all of the surprising negative feedback about this place, my own personal first impression was great and I am a fan."
Carlos M.,"San Diego, CA",28,178,1,4.0,3/18/2012,i been to this plae about 4 times over the past two years. Overall menu is like franchise type kinda remembered me of the cheesecake factory. Food is always good not great. but that cookie ice cream deal they have is really good. been here once where the service was really slow but it was on valentines day but overall i like this place and will be back. there beers are always really good
Geesal P.,"San Diego, CA",4,42,2,5.0,10/10/2011,"We frequent this establishment with the kids, its usually great depending on the server you get, we have been forgotten (once) the server must have been having a rough one, he and the bus boy engaged in a screaming match next to our table.  Other than that we've had positive experiences."
Christopher N.,"Chula Vista, CA",1,46,7,2.0,11/25/2013,The food here isn't all that great. The pizza is overrated and not good. I usually come here to only get the poozookies. Their service isn't great either. They make you wait a long time and sometimes they forget about your order.
J. O. Z.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,18,,3.0,6/13/2014,its and OK place to go for a casual diner! the bjs favorite pizza is the BEST! and during happy hour the beer becomes better! they do have a great beer selection! not a an expensive place!
Christina B.,"San Ysidro, CA",10,8,,3.0,4/30/2010,I've been here a couple times and they always take forever to bring our food.Its ok priced but id just be here for happy hour. Blonde ale was good. Food is good.  Its just average place... ...It is in Chula Vista.
Jenny L.,"New York, NY",83,167,,4.0,10/5/2011,"Had my going away dinner here with about 15 people. Very accommodating staff, and friendly service. Great selection of drinks, and food. I ordered the ahi tuna salad which was really good and fresh. We ordered the stuffed mushrooms, which were soooooo tiny, but pretty good. Everyone seemed to enjoy their food, and the calzone that my uncle ordered was supposedly really delicious. Walking by other tables, the pizza looked really good too...so might give that a try if I ever find myself in that restaurant again!"
TT P.,"Ellicott City, MD",0,25,,1.0,4/22/2012,"You're better off going to AM/PM for their food (I'm being serious).  DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT EAT HERE!  You will thank me later.  Not sure if they changed management but holy crap, they certainly went downhill.  Not only does their food taste like Hometown Buffet (greasy, no flavor), their service is downright atrocious.  The kicker to all this was that IT WAS NOT EVEN BUSY!  We had to scavenge our own silverware!  So yea, do not waste your time coming here."
