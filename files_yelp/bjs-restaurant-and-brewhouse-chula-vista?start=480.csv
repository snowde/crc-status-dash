Rob Z.,"Chula Vista, CA",1,4,,3.0,4/11/2009,"Upon reading all of the derogatory remarks/reviews on the local BJs I thought I would add some insight of my own, having been there a few times I feel that I can now give an honest review. The food can be hit or miss dependant on who is in the kitchen I suppose but overall the food alone would get 3 stars. Pizzas are decent , and the hh can offer some tasty and filling choices that won't deplete wallet. Atmosphere is cool and definately welcome for good ol Chula Juana. Bjs atmosphere/decor is above the other chain restaurants within the same price range ala Chilis,Applebees and such. One can come here hang out and not see roaches or other disgusting things in plain view. Service like most say is  sub-par for the most part. Some waiters/waitresses seem like they are all coked out and sweating which can ruin your appetite. The managers, for that matter, seem inexperienced and can be heard talking about their subordinates at times which is completely unprofessional. There are acceptions to the manager/servers situation because not all of them are totally unproffesional and incompetent. On one of my first visits I had a server(I think her name was Laura or something) that was super cool and personable. Things seemed super hectic but she handled business and we never had to waive her down or ask for constant refills (which can sometimes be problematic). Other times have not been so easy going, some people should just not be in the business. Overall I will probably go back to BJs if I'm in that part of Chula and have not eaten in a day or two. The service and food can be hit or miss,its kind of a crapshoot but they do play lots of 80s songs (the cool 1s) over the speakers which constitutes for 1 whole star entirely on its own."
Jessica D.,"San Diego, CA",231,56,21,2.0,1/24/2009,The food was good but the service sucked. My friend came down to visit and my girlfriends and I decided to have lunch there. We were left with empty glasses to drink and we had to ask our waitress every time. Didn't know if she was new but it stunk. She only passed  our table once. Was very disappointed with the service=(
Elsie B.,"Chula Vista, CA",47,28,2,4.0,5/21/2014,Me and my husband always come here since it is exactly what we like in a restaurant : great food and even greater beer!! We always get great service from the bar waiters and we have gotten a wide range of different plates and the majority are really good. I love the healthy options they have because they taste amazing compared to other places . The root beer is a must ! believe me is one of the best root beers i ever tasted
Lindsey M.,"San Diego, CA",128,84,20,4.0,1/24/2009,"Oh how I love BJ's BBQ Pizza. I mean that is one good pizza. About 10 times better then CPK's. My friends and I were in Chula Vista when we noticed they had just opened a BJ's there. We decided that we didn't want to sit down and eat so we went to their take-out desk and ordered food. The lady at the counter, I believe her name was Courtney, was super nice. I had gone to BJ's twice prior to this visit and will only get the BBQ pizza but I have never had a pizookie. I asked my friends and the lady at the counter if they were worth getting at the take out and she told me they were. Lets just say the PIzookie was AMAZING. I asked if I could get it while I was waiting for the rest of the food, so that the cookie could be hot and the ice cream cold, and they were nice enough to do that. I probably won't be driving down to Chula Vista to go to BJ's but the food was delicious, as always, and the service was great. I don't know about the rest of the restaurant but the take-out/curbside was fantastic!"
Josh C.,"San Diego, CA",10,26,11,2.0,4/21/2009,"Not what I expected on a Friday night.     The Good: Pizza kept this review from a 1star.  Great size and flavor of dough, quality toppings, BUT I needed to ask for more sauce, very dry.     The Bad:  The waitress placed our order wrong but quickly got our o.g pizza in great time.  She said one of the ovens was down and the pie makers were boycotting for the night.  She also brought our appetizer we ordered while waiting for the pizza...after the pizza.  It was a capacity night so I don't blame her entirely.       The Ugly:  WARM BEER!!!!.....I took one sip out of the tall blonde and asked to return to the bar.  This was so bad there was no sweat on the glass.  So my table ordered the beer sampler instead and to my surprise, they were all still not as cold as they should have been.  I swallowed my pride and went down the line.     First impressions are very important, and aside of the cool colored walls, Marylin Monroe decorated bathrooms, and classy looking waiters this place is one that I will not be returning to."
Joelyn P.,"San Diego, CA",6,12,,3.0,3/15/2012,"I loved our waiter! He looked like LT from the Chargers ! Anyways, service was great!  He always came back asking if we needed anything.  He brought all the condiments out in a timely matter and was overall a nice funny person. I gave it a 3 because our food was just okay. We had the pizza with artichoke and spinach. It was really dry and hard to eat.  The fish and chips were just okay too. However, our pazookie was amazing!  I would rec this place but stay away from the pizza!"
Tony M.,"San Diego, CA",198,209,6,2.0,5/28/2011,The service was so slow and horrible plus they were out of some many beers we kept asking for we called it early and bounced out of here before having anything else go wrong. Not sure if they'll get another try from me.
Miriam T.,"Las Vegas, NV",388,133,361,3.0,8/7/2009,"The very first time I went to BJ's was to meet up with some friends in Las Vegas, NV (located in West Charleston) and I was not hungry but a friend and I shared a ""pizookie"" recommended by everyone and yes! it was delicious. And that's all I've remembered.  Until recently, my bf took me to the BJ's for dinner in Chula Vista, CA and as we went in, the restaurant did not have that much people - I don't know if its because its during a weekday or just a slow day. I thought it was kind of nice and relaxing because it wasn't so busy therefore the service on on top of there game. We ordered the glazed chicken with mashed potatoes, spinach, and grilled string onions and that was OMG! DELICIOUS!!! The mashed potatoes was soft and buttery!! I could taste it now...*salivating* And I ordered red wine and it complimented the taste with the chicken. So I felt relaxed and full at the same time. hehe. It was an wonderful treat for the both of us :)"
Fox E.,"Chula Vista, CA",1,23,,2.0,1/17/2012,use to love coming here for happy hour. Now id rather not! these folks take for ever to serve or recognize you. My family and I walked out after sitting there for almost 25mins no one even acknowledged us not even the damn bus boy. Only if someone gave me a gift certificate for this damn place maybe ill consider going other than that. NO THANK YOU!!! CUSTOMER SERVICE SHOULD ALWAYS COME FIRST!!!
Kevin Thanh T.,"Chollas Creek, San Diego, CA",4,3,,1.0,4/16/2012,"Deep dish yeah right, barely any topping, and sooooooo much bread. Never again will I go to this place"
Fred S.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,2,1,4.0,7/8/2013,"If you go before 6 pm on weekends the service and food is really good, after that it gets a little busy and the quality drops off. The pizookie is a favorite of my kids and I like the pizza. The wings are the best I have ever had."
richie e.,"San Diego, CA",1492,148,31,4.0,11/24/2008,"Had pizza and artichoke chip which was of course bomb. What I'm unsure about is if I should drop this a star or not.  I'll be giving the benefit of the doubt because some people enjoy this type of customer service. (The whole reason why Dick's last resort makes ton of cash.) The server pretty much dissed my experience with dark beers.  I can understand questioning me once or maybe even twice about ordering the Tatonka Stout but 4 or 5 times? WTF?! I had to retort by saying ""You see how dark I am? I drink beers as dark as I am!"" Ugh Ok, so 4 stars because Tatonka was rich and creamy.  Deliciously sweet, multi layered in flavors, and rolls over your tongue in a very satisfying manner. Update: Sliders were good, cajun pasta was super creamy and I felt 10 pounds heavier after my meal. So I'm looking at everyone's complaints about the inexperienced and bad service.  Maybe I'm just lucky? Even though there was a shift change in the middle of our meal we were well looked after.  At point a server accidentally broke an empty plate and the drunk table next to us got the entire place to whoop n holler but she seemed unfazed by the rude customers.   The place was packed with 4 birthdays on the floor and all the bar stools taken but I didn't notice any of the things everyone else complained about. so yeah... maybe I just went on a night where all the good staff was on duty?"
Jen R.,"San Diego, CA",218,308,38,5.0,11/16/2008,"I was quite surprised to find out that this place had just recently opened up in the mall.  Came to this joint last night and I was actually delighted with the whole experience!  Our host greeted and promptly seated us right away which was nice.  The place was definitely bigger in space compared to the other BJ's I've visited.  Our server was very nice to us and had excellent communication skills as she always made sure we had everything we needed.  At one point she came to drop off some plates at our table, but chose to take those plates back herself numerous times after seeing that the plates she was grabbing weren't quite fully cleaned.  To be honest, I'm glad she caught that rather than myself because I really take little details like that to the next level so kudos to her for being attentive and for keeping our drinks filled ;).  If it is one thing I can't stand, that would be not being given a refill or even being asked for one.  She definitely made sure we weren't being ignored and I was quite surprised to see everyone working closely as a team.  My server had people helping her bring our orders and even boxed our pizza up for us which at another location was never done before so hopefully they keep up this kind of service.   Their root beer was so good! It was smooth and didn't have much of a crazy fizz like all the other root beers out there. I decided to skip out on the bar as I wanted to take a break from that and just enjoy the good food they had.  After having a sampler, I was pretty stuffed.  The pizza was super good as well! Ended up taking that home to eat for later :). I'm glad BJ's is now in Chula Vista! It sure beats having to drive anywhere else for their good food!"
Elaine D.,"San Diego, CA",21,34,,2.0,12/26/2008,"I'm only giving them two stars because:  1. The yummy selection of beer. 2. Pizookies. But my last visit here was so frustrating!  My friends and I came here for dinner and the service was so slow. Our waitress took our drink orders, came back 20 minutes later with our waters and our beers. She took our orders, only to come back 30 minutes later to let us know that they were out of what we ordered. ?!?! So we ordered pizookies instead, and my friend ordered soup in a bread bowl. Waitress comes back with soup, sans bread bowl, so we had to flag down another waitress to get what we needed. Not to mention our glasses were not once refilled the whole time we were there.  I spoke to the manager about everything, and he was kind enough to take care of our bill, except for the beers. It still didn't compensate for the time wasted and the bad mood we left with that night. So disappointing.  I'd recommend going to the one in La Mesa, but I had an even WORSE experience there...  ugh don't get me started..."
J. ..,"Chula Vista, CA",0,1,,4.0,7/1/2013,Busy friday night but great service and amazing new bbq menu
Adrian D.,"San Diego, CA",245,19,3,2.0,3/19/2011,It was just okay.  Appetizers were good.  I had the flat bread margarita pizza which I liked. My entree was the Parmesan crusted chicken which was mediocre at best.  It was dry and lacked sauce.  When I asked the waitress for more sauce she said they always short the sauce on this dish.  Excellent beer menu and the bar is nice.
Fritzi Ann P.,"San Diego, CA",77,43,1,1.0,9/30/2009,"Oh geez. I've given this place plenty of chances and a lot of my money. I usually get that articoke pizza with my lover boy and we do love it but it's the service here that did it for us. The horrible service at BJs is enough reason to never come back.  The last time we went, the bartender fucked up my white russian. I would understand if the place was packed but no, it was completely empty on a weekday early in the afternoon. If I wanted vodka and milk, I would have asked for it. I went up to the bar and asked if he could fix my drink that he made and add more kalua to it. He refused and said that he could but he would have to charge me. I wouldn't have to ask him to fix my drink if he made it right."
Elena V.,"San Diego, CA",374,164,,4.0,12/16/2012,"I guess it's time I review BJ's. Hahaha I just made my self laugh. On to the review. I have had two four experiences here and one three star experience here. We tend to go on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon so it's not too packed. I dog the sampler beers so that you can try small portions to get a feel what you kind of beer you want to commit to. The four star experiences involved a great sampler platter that tasted amazing and every item was hot and tasted fresh. The 3 star night it was a little crowded and my sampler platter tasted like maybe it was gasp...all frozen foods. I'm not sure if it is frozen food but it was just mediocre. And the sauces tasted different and not so appetizing. Our service was great all of the times we visited but it does get busy and they tend to get a little slow. Over all a great place to grab a drink and a bite, catch a game on the big screen. I'll be back to BJ's im sure."
Andrea R.,"San Diego, CA",60,39,9,3.0,8/10/2012,"Went with my husband for the 2 for $20 deal.  First problem was the wait.  We got there about dinner time and it was just me, him and our one year old daughter.  We waited about 15 minutes for a table.  The restaurant wasn't even packed.  I saw about 6 tables open.  The lack of seating at the front was bad too.  My husband has a broken foot and had to stand while waiting for a table. When we finally sat down, it took a bit to get drink orders taken.  We had also asked about the 2 for $20 deal and the waitress told us it wasn't happening then.  We asked if she could check on it which she did and yes, it was going.  We finally ordered and the salad was just eh but the tortilla soup my husband got was AMAZING!!!  The pizza was alright.  I think when the person brought it to us they must have held it at an angle cause most the cheese had slid to one side.  The Oreo Pizookie was AWESOME!!   If we go back, I am definitely getting the Tortilla Soup.  Thats IF we go back though."
eLaine f.,"San Diego, CA",5,38,,4.0,6/21/2011,"06/20/11 - been here multiple times before - the food choice is always satisfying - but the stars come from the service. yesterday our server Fernando definitely earned his tip. One of the kiddos ordered the jambalaya which she said was delicious but was wayyy to spicy. so spicy that the orange creme soda, mashed potatoes her sister gave her, the chicken dish her mom passed her, and the glass of milk did not help her. so our server was able to get her a new dish that she would be able to eat. i always love servers that take initiative to refill your drinks. first time trying the orange creme soda which BJ's brews themselves - delicious - just like a 50/50 bar. i was being good & ordered off the ""healthy menu"" - the maui pork chop - how sad my face was when it came out considering it looked like half of whatever one's plate was - but the pork chop wasn't dry at all & had enough sweetness i was expecting. i also took a bite of the parmesan crusted chicken which i'm definitely going to order on my own next trip. of course we began w/spinach artichoke dip & ended w/a pizoooooookie - the choice this trip cookies 'n cream."
