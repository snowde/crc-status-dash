Lakeisha G.,"Frisco, TX",7,88,3,3.0,9/6/2011,Food is just ok in my opinion.  I am not a big fan of beer but my fiance loves it here! I do enjoy theirafter work happy hour or mid-day happy hour :-)
Desi N.,"San Diego, CA",64,351,10,4.0,8/13/2012,"My first trip to B.Js was long over due! I was almost convinced that it was another simple franchise like AppleBees or T.J.I Friday serving bland food for low prices. When I came in, I was quite impressed at how nice and clean the restaurant was. It reminded me of being in a replica of a more updated Cheesecake Factory minus the wide selection of Cheesecake and the optional outdoor seating area. The employees were all busy and kept up well with hosting and serving everyone which really made my lunch more enjoyable! I had an awesome server whose name I did not get but everytime I drank my water down to the ice, he was right next to me filling my glass up. I never once needed to call for him or go through numerous failed attempts to get his attention. He was right where I could see him and frequently asked was everything fine. It sure was - from the seating, the atmosphere, the service, to the great company and delicious food! Restaurants' wide ranged menus always make ordering difficult for me but not at B.Js. I did not waste much time trying to figure out what I wanted because nothing stood out more to me than the Salads and the under 450 calories menu. Eating healthy has become a trend and it's definitely one I can't complain about! Right away I knew I wanted the Ahi Seared Salad. I had no idea what to expect but my judgment was on point for once! My taste buds and I were extremely satisfied after lunch here! The salad looked like something from a well known and appreciated recipe book. There's nothing I enjoy more than detail and almost perfect decor on my plate. The chef must have been in a great mood. I was content that I was served very fresh leafy greens as opposed to the usual non nutritional valued iceberg lettce. The avocado balanced well with the freshness of the greens, sauce and the lightly seared ahi. I enjoyed it to the last bite and remember thinking how I couldn't wait for my next lunch at B.Js. What took me so long to try it out? I have no idea. It's now my new favorite lunch spot until I'm proven otherwise. The drinks mounted on the walls made me want to stay for a Happy Hour but I'm not much of a drinker and wouldn't want to be tipsy in the mall. By the way, I recall saying outloud to my friend who ordered delicious avocado rolls how the music choice was great! Two of my favorite songs played back to back. Billy Idol - ""Rebel Yell, and Red Hot Chili Pepper's ""Give It Away Now"" ... Who doesn't like those two songs??? Experience was excellent! Reason for 4 stars is because it's not exactly a 5 star restaurant but very close in my opinion! Look forward to coming back! :)"
Nessa N.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,12,,3.0,3/27/2014,"I like this place! Open till super late, food is good, service is slow though, and if you're thirsty then be prepared to wait! But the servers are always nice."
Karina F.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,3,,5.0,2/5/2013,"I recently went to bj's for happy hour with a couple of friends. I have never sat at the bar because I assumed the service wouldn't be the best. However, I was definitely mistaken. Our bartender, I believe her name was Erika, was as friendly and attentive as any other server in that restaurant. It was a very busy night yet she found the time to not only inform us of specials but also engage in conversation making us feel comfortable in that setting. The drinks and food were great I would definitely enjoy another happy hour at bj's. :)"
Vanessa M.,"El Cajon, CA",1,6,4,1.0,3/25/2014,"My Girl friend loves this place, me not so much, the very first time we had lunch at BJ's the waiter came out with our food and my girl friends sandwich was completely wrong, it's a sandwich for crying out loud I'm pretty sure it almost the easiest thing to make on the menu and my pasta was warm as if it was just sitting under a light in the kitchen, when we confronted the waiter he was completely rude about it. Our second trip to BJ's praying that it would be a better experience then the first, was if not way worst then the first visit this time we sit in the booths by the bar for happy hour we order chips and salsa and wings as an appetizer and for entrees I order a caesar salad and a tortilla soup, and my girl friend orders Sliders. 35 minutes go by still no appetizer, I mean come on how hard is it to bring chips and salsa out?? Now 40 mins go by I finally tell the waiter and he says oh yeah I forgot  finally after 45 mins have gone by we get the appetizer and the entrees all at once. My girlfriend is never the one to complain about anything, it's always me, but this day she was furious, the manager was the only one who seemed to be doing his job right he ended up comp the bill. So thumbs up to him"
Sam C.,"San Diego, CA",3,329,1574,4.0,9/22/2009,"Came to this area for dinner at Uno's to find them closed permanantely, but saw that a new BJs had opened nearby.  Went in for dinner and was suprised by the nice and spacious sportsbar themed restaurant. The only other BJs I'd had ever been to was the tiny one in La Jolla which is always packed with students from UCSD. Service this night was normal. The place was only about 15-20% full, so it wasn't too busy nor loud.  Ordered the buffalo wings for appetizer, since there wasn't any other appetizer on the menu I wanted to try.  I ended up being plesantly suprised. The wings were fried to a crispy perfection and drizzled lightly with ranch and sour/spicy sauce. It was served with celery and side servings of the ranch and sour/spicy sauce, unlike many other restaurants who drench the wings in the sour/spicy sauce when served. It's easier for each person to control how spicy the wings are for each person this way. For the main entree, had the great white, which was a cheese based deep dish pizza with tomatoes and spices.  This is a popular pizza here.  I liked it's soft and fluffy texture, unlike the oily and hard deep dish pizza Unos serves. I'm not a fan of beer so I can't comment on that."
Johanna S.,"Imperial Beach, CA",24,22,,2.0,10/25/2009,"The service sucks. The food is alright. I guess the pizza is pretty filling because its thick and worth 2,900 calories. It really wasn't all that great... and to top it off its way pricey.."
Claudia B.,"Lake Forest, CA",20,167,26,3.0,9/19/2011,"The service varies, sometimes it will be great, others it can be horrible. Overall it is a good place, the food is good for the price and their happy hour special are awesome. The Chicken Parmesan is by far my favorite BJ's dish."
Heidi A.,"Bonita, CA",0,25,5,5.0,12/3/2013,"Yum!!! Great deep dish pizza!!! They also had a great deal going on...$20 gets you any medium pizza, 2 side salads or soups AND a dessert!!! Awesome!! Our server Kary was wonderful too!! Friendly, attentive and knowledgable!!"
lori a.,"San Diego, CA",26,65,38,4.0,9/1/2011,"The beer selection is good. The AC is always blasting in here, bring a jacket."
Mark O.,"Valley View, TX",7,11,,2.0,2/23/2012,"Service was bad.  Took too long for our food to come out.  The Sweet Pig pizza was good, but the Avocado Eggrolls were different here than the BJ's in Dallas.  They were spicy and I tasted no pinenuts. The waiter had to be asked repeatedly for drinks.  Not worth the $$$ unless you are looking to kill time...lots of time."
Kyxie D.,"Chula Vista, CA",2,39,1,4.0,9/27/2009,"Great place to go for decent prices and decent meals. I had the Chardonnay Shrimp Pasta, it was yummy and fulfilling. Although the description said their would be sun dried tomatoes (which I'm completely in love with), the food came out with just regular diced up tomatoe. Service wasn't too bad. I made sure I saved room for a White Chocolate Macademia Nut PIZOOOKIE. Oh my goodness those pizookie's hit the sweet spot, I'm in love with them and currently craving for one. It was my first time there when all my other friends have been to this place. Good stuff, I'd recommend for a casual outting."
Frisco G.,"Chula Vista, CA",5,11,,5.0,1/25/2014,"BJ's is turning into one of my favorite restaurants.  A plate of Angus Beef sliders with wedge cut fries and a Jeremiah Red beer...I am a happy dude.  I've been here several times and its now my go to place when I can't decide what to eat.  The menu us extensive, I love that.  The wings and deep dish pizza is good and the craft beer ever better.  I go back and forth between the Jeremiah Red and the Nutty Brewnette beers but usually go with the Red.  I like their beers so much I tried to get some to go.  FYI..only the La Mesa location would sell me the beers in a 6 pack.  Been here for lunch and happy hour and left happy each time.  The service has always been consistently good.  I workout so I need to feel satisfied when I eat, and the portions here are plenty.   The prices are great.  Example:  the Angus Beef sliders are $8.99 for four slider and only $1 more for fries.  Whereas a lot of places would charge the same for three sliders and charge you three or four dollars more to add fries.  Their draft beers are like $5.50 for a pint and like $3.50 during happy hour.  So much to try with so little time.  I'm going back...I'm starting to miss the Red."
Yakumo Y.,"San Diego, CA",0,5,,4.0,10/25/2013,"Came here for some lunch with my friends, and we all ordered the salmon and it was definitely delicious. However, towards the end of the visit, the customer service certainly went downhill. We kept calling for our server to bring our check, but, she took almost what felt like eternity. We were able to have another server find our server and he was kind enough to find her for us and give us our check. Hope this will be fixed over wait time. Thanks."
Adrienne G.,"National City, CA",34,64,14,5.0,7/25/2011,Mmmmmm had the California chicken sandwich. So good! I also parried that up with a hefeweizen and some lettuce wraps to start. Service was excellent:) our waiter was super nice and very efficient with the refills. Can't wait to go back!!
Michelle P.,"San Diego, CA",55,121,4,2.0,6/9/2009,"After a training at a nearby hospital, We decided to try this BJ's for the lunch specials. We should have just walked out in the beginning. I knew my customer service was going to be sub par. We walked in and there was no hostess. There was a group of 5 servers standing in the back and no one even acknowledged that we were there. After about four minutes of standing there a server (that was actually working) walked by with a plate and said that someone was going to be right with us.  We were seated and ordered from a less than friendly waitress. I had the soup, half sandwich, and thin cut fries with a side of ranch. I didn't get the kind of soup I ordered, but I let it go because they brought out my second choice.  The food was okay. My main complaint was with my waitress, I understand that you have to turn your tables over, but two people at a booth don't need their plates cleared every five minutes. And my ranch didn't even come out until my meal was 1/2 way consumed. I had actually had food in my hand when my waitress grabbed my plate and asked me if I was done.  Luckily, this place has to-go service. That would be the only reason to come back. They should send this staff to train with the La Mesa BJ's staff. They know whats up."
Anna-Michelle M.,"Los Angeles, CA",52,53,11,4.0,7/5/2011,My hubby and I stopped by for lunch after a little bit of shopping.  We ordered off of the low calorie menu and it was great.  I had the creole tilapia and it was so yummy (and HEALTHY).  Didn't really enjoy the house Heff but it was ok.  Good place to stop in while at the mall.
Neil P.,"San Diego, CA",427,146,2,4.0,7/5/2011,Most the time when I go here I order the BJ's Cobb Salad. I love the dressing being that it is a garlic ranch dressing. BEST!!!!
Jennifer S.,"San Diego, CA",22,79,4,4.0,6/14/2011,"My sisters and I like to come here for the broccoli cheddar soup in a sourdough bread bowl. It is delicious, VERY cheesy, and toasty. I also like to order the chicken lettuce wraps because its such a great appetizer. Tangy and light, its definitely a favorite. They always have great specials for lunch or dinner too. My sisters and I are hooked on the strawberry lemonade!! It is the perfect balance of lemon and strawberry and comes with free refills!! Awesome decor, ambience, and service. Pazookies are what makes this place extraordinary. I'll take one to go please!!"
Jackie S.,"Chula Vista, CA",7,72,,3.0,6/26/2009,Been here twice already and it's okay.  The deep dish pizzas were good but how do you run out of large pizzas when that's your primary menu item? Weird but whatever. The drinks are okay but I've definately had better. Our server last night was a little cold and unfriendly but everyone has an off night so it was cool. Not my first choice but if you're looking for a contemporary resturant that's kid friendly then you've found your place.
