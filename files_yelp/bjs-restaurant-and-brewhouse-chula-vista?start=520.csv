Chris P.,"San Diego, CA",441,202,26,3.0,3/24/2010,"service BLOWS. I've had better. The pizzookies though, are worth putting in your mouth. That is all."
Sarah H.,"Orlando, FL",124,215,5,2.0,4/2/2011,"I've been here once for new years and had a horrible server. We were sat next to the bathroom and never saw our server...half the time we spent tracking her down. Today was a similar story. Terrible, slow, unfriendly service. The bartender seemed annoyed by us and kept interrupting while I was ordering. 2 stars is being generous."
Joseph B.,"Twentynine Palms, CA",92,3,,2.0,1/3/2014,"If you want slow service that gets your order wrong after waiting forever then go to this place. I went to CV BJ when they first opened and service was awful. Went for my girlfriends nephews B-day dinner a couple weeks ago and guess what??   No, its actually worse then 5 years ago.   Its ashame because the menu and food are not half bad, but poor management and service...worse ive ever see......never again"
Pablo C.,"Key West, FL",14,40,3,3.0,7/8/2011,"Menu has plenty of choices, Pizza good, drinks a little on the pricey side, good appetizers, OK for football season,  very good looking restaurant...here's a addendum...they are not allowed by corporate policy to play the sound for sporting events....kinda of a bummer if you wanna watch the game with a cold one in your hand"
Alex C.,"San Diego, CA",0,6,,1.0,10/25/2012,"I had one of the WORST restaurant experiences here. Our server was terrible! The drinks took about 20 minutes to arrive. I never got a refill and we sat there for about 2 whole hours. By the time our food got there we had been waiting about 40 minutes. At one point my brother ordered a second drink and the server took 20 minutes again to bring that one, and we happened to see him across the room with the drink and he stopped to chat up with another server and give her change for her tip money, that was the longest 5 minutes ever being that he was thirsty and had already waited 20 minutes for his drink. His priorities were way off!! We asked for a pazooki being it was my dads birthday....never got it! we asked for our check about 3 different times before we got fed up of waiting and just went to the front counter and demanded the check. When our server had a hard time getting the check the manager was hardly any help and kept leaving, instead of staying to make sure everything was done correctly. He made a couple mistakes untill finally a different waitress came and rang us up. Knowing that we were upset, the manager did nothing to try and make our experience less terrible. She seemed to not really care. I will never put myself through that frustration again, that was my last time at this place!"
Leilanie M.,"Chula Vista, CA",1,4,,1.0,10/24/2012,"horrible, horrible, horrible! i was there FOR LUNCH and it took them 40 minutes to bring out a cold flatbread pizza and a salad. seriously?! when i asked what happened, they actually had the nerve to make excuses! ""oh, we were short staffed"", ""oh, 15-20 minutes its our REGULAR turnaround time"". seriously?! for a piece of COLD pizza? when i asked about why the pizza was cold, their response? (shrugs shoulders) ""i dont know why"" this is LUNCH people, LUNCH on a WEEKDAY which means people have to go back to work! how do you expect to have an efficient lunch time when you barely see your waiter/waitress and EVERYTHING is slow? you would think that with the prices being so low, they would want a faster turnaround time. which means, SERVE YOUR FOOD FASTER. but nope! i guess tips dont matter to them. NEVER again."
Cami M.,"Chula Vista, CA",14,35,,4.0,12/15/2010,Let's just say I understand why some people have felt the need to score this location with two or three stars because of one visit. I have gone to this location several times and I can say they have progressively gotten better with their service. When I first went to this location the food service was super slow. Now however I have found that the service is faster. The upside is that the servers or hosts that I have encountered are absolutely happy and perfect with their customer service. Yes the food can be faster but hell as long as my food is hot and my food is amazing I don't care. Love their pzookies!!!! If anything I would go there for just the Pzookie alone and maybe an alcoholic drink.
Adam L.,"San Diego, CA",38,63,1,2.0,4/23/2010,"I really have nothing good to say about this place. I've been to several BJs before, and one word can sum this location up: TERRIBAD.  I've been to this location twice. Each time the service was slow, and the food was mediocre at best.  There is a definite need of a management change. I know it's brand new, but judging by how quickly the turnover rate for new restaurants are in Chula Vista, it's needed and pronto.  Will I come here again? Probably not. Benefit of the doubt; two stars. At least the waitresses are nice."
Corey A.,"Imperial Beach, CA",19,3,,1.0,11/11/2013,Did not have the top 2 choices I wanted for dinner. Apparently they are making a new menu... So I couldn't have the chicken fried chicken or the pot roast. There's no point in removing things if people still ask for them right.... Never going back and will make sure my friends don't go either.
Mayra D.,"San Diego, CA",1,12,2,3.0,12/5/2011,Bj's use to be a weekly spot for me and my girlfriends to get together after work. Love the appetizers and happy hour specials. on game day get here early or you will have to wait a good while before being seated. I gave them 3 stars because the service isnt that great.
Neshea H.,"San Diego, CA",3,9,,5.0,8/7/2011,The Pomegranate Martini was AMAZING! Came on a Saturday night with the family and we had a great experience. The hostess and the waitress was really nice. The appetizer Best Beginnings Appetizer Combo was so good. The avocado rolls were great. The atmophere was also good. We managed to find parking in the mall so that was a plus.
Anya D.,"San Diego, CA",2,29,,3.0,5/30/2010,"I have been to a BJ's before.  The decor of the BJ's in Chula Vista seems a lot different.  It's more modern and fancy.  I liked the atmosphere.  Not a bad place to come with a group of people--plenty of seating room. I went on a Saturday night and we didn't have to wait for a table.  The place was pretty empty compared to other places on a Saturday night. The service was good.  Our waiter was very nice and friendly.  We got our food within 15 minutes of ordering. The food itself is pretty standard restaurant chain food.  I got a pasta dish that was good, but there was way too much food and they don't offer half sizes at dinner time (just lunch)."
George S.,"Chula Vista, CA",4,11,,5.0,10/10/2010,"BJ's never disappoints. Today... They treated my freinds and I like valued customers. We were seated right away... Gr8 view of the jumbo tv for charger game. My belgium beer order got mixed up "" duvel instaed of westmale Dubel""..not a big deal b/c both are gr8...comped!. Food was excellent... Beer selection phenominal and the service top notch. It's no wonder they are opening up all  over.... These guys get it. They do simple food great!!! And offer a gr8 selection of meals as well. Thanks for providing us with an excellent experience! Please open a BJ's in eastlake!"
Alexis T.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,1,,1.0,9/12/2014,"The worst restaurant experience my family and I have ever had. Honestly, if I could give no stars at all, I would. The staff is not very accommodating. We were a party of 19 on a Friday night, and they do not take reservations, so we were expecting quite a wait. The hostesses told us an hour and a half to two hours. Which was fine, my brother in law really wanted to eat here for his birthday. However, what I don't understand is that there was an entire row of tables left open. My sister asked why we could not be seated there, the hostess told her that they had a waiting list. We absolutely understood that, however, no one was there longer than we were. So, my sister tried to ask if we could be seated there but the hostess said ""no, that's for people on the waiting list. We are waiting on one more table to open up in the middle so we can seat you."" Just a thought, the tables are not stuck together are they? Because as far as we could see, the tables in the middle were separated as well, therefore I don't see why we couldn't be accommodated first seeing as how we had waited for the longest time. There were not many people waiting any how and tables were available. Do you see the problem? The manager did not even wear a name tag. Horrible service. Then, we asked for another menu as the hostess walked by with arms full of menus, and she said ""oh my hands are full, let me just go put these down then I can bring you one."" What, twenty minutes later? Do not waste your time here. Terrible service, faulty tables, and OK food."
Adel O.,"San Diego, CA",71,231,445,4.0,9/27/2010,"Connected to one of the crapiest malls in San Diego, still manages to gather a crowd.  Love this place.  Basic default dish for me is the Fettucini Grilled Chicken Alfredo.  Best Clam Chowder bowl I've ever tasted.  Avocado Egg Rolls are a must to get if you are going to sit down.  Finish you off with a Pizookie, hot baked cookie with a scoop of ice cream slaped on top.  Recently tried their signature root beer, not bad.  Whatever root beer they put in not heavy at all and icecream is always a good thing.  Not big on beer but yeah there is a grip of selection, has a full bar if you're not into beer so no worries.   Open late at night so nice chill spot.  Real clean inside with good service.  Highly recommended if you're in the area."
Kayla P.,"San Diego, CA",7,42,3,5.0,10/21/2010,I love this BJs!!!!!!!! The waiters are incredibaly nice and the food is DELICIOUS!!! I've only been to this location 2 times but both of the times have been incredible! Their pizza to the crust is thick and soft also REALLY fresh!
Cool G.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,27,,4.0,7/1/2013,"I really enjoy their lunch specials and the curb side take out! Their food is always soo fresh, filling and good : ) Definitely LOVE this place!! Everyone I've taken is always impressed with the food they get!"
Drea L.,"Chula Vista, CA",130,4,,4.0,4/16/2009,Talk about generous food portions at a reasonable price. Yum yum yum! If and when you go here you have to try the avacado appetizers & lettuce wraps. Not to mention the pizookies yummy!  Service was about an 6 or 7.
Lui B.,"San Diego, CA",304,29,26,5.0,10/13/2012,"i love this place! i was served by this lovely server named Monica, the one with the poneytail, and the cute smile, and shes from Bonita ( dont ask me how i know this). definetely get the avocado eggrolls as an app and the parm crusted chicken. and dont forget a pizzokie to go along with monica's sweet smile."
Chris G.,"Chula Vista, CA",4,18,,3.0,12/18/2010,"When looking for a variety - BJ's is the place.  Great Burgers.  I had the California Burger and my wife had the Turkey Burger last Wednesday and both were exceptional.  I didn't understand serving fries with a turkey burger on a whole wheat bun.  Really?  Can't you come up with anything more healthy.  That lowered my score by one, as well as another point for the price for a burger and fries -  $10.95.  Com'on!  They aren't that good."
