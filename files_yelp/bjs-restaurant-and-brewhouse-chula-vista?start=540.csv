Vanessa C.,"San Diego, CA",70,124,189,1.0,5/27/2010,"Yuck....the food was cold when it came out, and the pizza was horrible!  I really have a hard time eating a wanna-be Chicago style pie that has terrible canned pizza sauce, seemingly government style cheese and canned toppings.  Horrible!  Please stay away if you like real food!"
April B.,"Chula Vista, CA",13,19,,4.0,10/18/2010,Pretty good place to go I love the happy hour and the lunch specials. This place is really affordable and a great place if you don't want to spend much.
Catherine R.,"San Diego, CA",60,56,8,3.0,9/5/2010,My experience here was okay. I set up a reservation for 10 people on a Saturday night. We got there on time but ended up waiting am extra 20 minutes before we were seated. Our waiter was good but the bartender making our drinks took forever. My pizza was okay too. I've had better. But my favorite part of course was the pizzokie. Everyone raves about it cause it's truly really good. I wish everything else were up to pizzokie standards too.
Jojo B.,"San Diego, CA",170,66,119,4.0,5/15/2010,"Big and spacious!  Wifey had the cesar salad, it was good, I had the Turkey burger.  Overall good experience, service was good."
Martha J.,"San Diego, CA",18,47,1,5.0,11/28/2010,"Jeremiah red, pizookies, happy hour, mini pizzas. Delicious!"
Mike F.,"Oakland, CA",5,8,,5.0,1/20/2011,"Stopped in for happy hour. Had a mini deep dish and a few of their craft beers, the nutty brewnette and the berry burst cider. The pizza was small but delicious and their beers are excellent. Would recommend it to anybody who loves beer. Good atmosphere and friendly bar staff."
Susie C.,"San Diego, CA",0,7,,4.0,3/4/2013,"I've been to this Bjs several times. The food was great, we sat down in the bar area. The server did not mention his name, but he was very polite and he brought our food on a timely matter. I had a strawberry mojito, it was delicious. I had a pulled bbq pork sandwich. It was big so I only ate half of it. I would definitely come back."
Armando A.,"Chula Vista, CA",57,25,19,1.0,6/2/2009,"""Man, I'm telling you. I've never been to a brewery that serves hotter beers on tap than this place!!! "" I decided to go to Happy Hour with a friend of mine to check this place out. The first time we went, I returned my beer. I told the Bartender it was warm, and she said that they were fixing the temperature for the kegs......so I let it slide. A couple of weeks later, we went back and the beers on tap were still hot. Unless you like hot beers, this place is for you. What  I do recommend the Sample Platter they have there for $14.99. It did take us about 30 minutes to get it (Bad Customer Service). Other than that, I will never ever go back to this place again for Happy Hour. 2 Thumbs down."
L. P.,"San Diego, CA",1,15,1,3.0,1/16/2013,"If you're gonna go to dinner in a mall, then BJ's is a good choice.  It's got a nice brewery vibe and there are a ton of tables so it wasn't hard to get seated.  The beer is good and the burgers are too.  Noisy, so OK to take the kids.  All in all, I would rather not dine in a mall, but I had a good time here with a group of friends."
Brian B.,"San Diego, CA",0,16,,4.0,1/1/2011,"It was my first time here so I may not be as harsh as the other reviewers were. I thought the place was small compared to the large entrance they had outside. The atmosphere is nice and is great for sports since they have TVs all over the place. The food was great, I ordered the Roast Beef Sandwich which came with some amazingly good fries. The waitress we got was nice and the food didn't take long to get to our table. This place might be good for you if it was your first time ever going to a BJ's."
Robert L.,"Escondido, CA",52,14,16,2.0,9/17/2009,"I went here some time ago hoping to eat some good Deep Dish pIzza...but ""the thing"" I got was not even deep dish at all, it had very little sauce (very dry), and almost no cheese. I know I'm not going back there again."
alexandria m.,"Seattle, WA",2,27,,1.0,6/19/2009,I would like to thank everyone for reading this.  Furthermore because of this Godawful restaurant I have decided to attend graduate school and get my Masters in RD (reg Dietican) I am now attending my requirements of bio-science classes before my program.  I will write a thesis about the death of america regarding obesity and restaurants  such as this allowing to this happen to man kind.  Do your health a favor don't eat there.
archie a.,"Chula Vista, CA",17,15,7,3.0,7/24/2009,Idve been on this place thrice and it was ok. The beer was good like the jeremiah red but ya it does need to be colder lols. The food was great though and the people were really nice.
Dani D.,"San Diego, CA",47,31,6,3.0,4/6/2009,These place is really good to go on lunch time. we order chicken tenders 2 pink lemonades and a half sandwich and salad and only 20.00 Dlls pretty good. is a good resturant but not the best
Ryan E.,"San Diego, CA",12,11,1,2.0,3/2/2010,"We visited around lunch time and arrived well before the lunch rush.  The service was fine up until the wait for the food.  It must have been 30 minutes and a reminder to the waitress before the food came out.  I had the tomato soup and ham sandwich, which was good enough.  My friend had a personal pizza which not only arrived 15 minutes after the rest of our food, but came out cold and soggy.  The cheese wasn't even melted.  The only thing saving BJs from a one star review is that my friends and I found the rest of the food, once it arrived, to be decent.  I don't think I'll be returning.  The restaurant is located in a very busy shopping area, so I suggest trying one of the many restaurants within walking distance."
Caitlin W.,"Chula Vista, CA",26,15,1,4.0,3/20/2011,I always love the food here.  This is a great place to sit down and have a nice long dinner  - it's a comfortable casual place that won't rush you when you're there to catch up with friends.
Katrina G.,"San Diego, CA",9,11,12,4.0,1/21/2010,Their Pizookie is good! Got me hella full!
Angela I.,"Spring Valley, CA",135,104,88,2.0,3/20/2009,"Seriously - WHAT IS UP WITH THE SERVICE AT THIS LOCATION? We got immediate seating in the bar area, waited around for awhile to order drinks. When our server finally returned I gave her my order and she took off like a bat out of hell before my friend could tell her what he wanted. My drink was tasty but tiny (especially for that price) and the food was good but the service was almost non-existent."
Mark 'n Bern M.,"Chula Vista, CA",28,11,,2.0,11/17/2008,"MARK: Attention ALL Chargers fans... If you are looking for a place to watch the Chargers game while eating out with some of your friends or family, this is NOT the place to go!!!! Since this is a brand new spot, 10 of my friends and I figured we should go watch the game over at BJ's especially since we love their food and it's close to home. We were seated in the dining area of the restaurant and there was no sound to the game. I asked the management if they could turn on the sound to the game but they said that it was their decision to leave it off in the dining room area. So we were forced to listen to crappy ass music from artists like Ashley Simpson while the bar area of the restaurant had it playing. It was obvious that everyone in the place was there for the game. Needless to say, we left by halftime. Stick to a place like Oggi's if you're looking to hang out and watch/listen to the game with some fellow Chargers fans!!        BERN: Most of the wait staff were newbies so it did take a lil longer to receive our food and beverages. But they were very friendly and accommodating. I don't have any doubt that in a month or two that problem will be solved. But BJ's is a freakin brew house for goodness sakes. Let the people knock back a few brews and watch the damn game with sound!"
D S.,"Chula Vista, CA",1,63,,2.0,1/27/2009,"The first time, I went there for happy hour, I had such high hopes. The menu looked great, the beer list was long and it seemed to be such a wonderful addition to drab Chula Vista. Alas, I was sadly disappointed. As several have already pointed out, the service is terrible. Hello. When I sit in the bar, I want to have a drink. Not tomorrow, not the next day but today and the sooner the better. While the English believe in warm beer, I don't. Why does my beer have to sit at the bar waiting by it's lonesome? (The second time, I was there I almost got up to get my own beer but my darling wife whacked me in the shin).  Does beer get better with age? Afraid not.  Been there twice so the terrible service is not an anomaly. Sorry, I really wanted to like this place. Maybe the next time, I'll just do the restaurant side. If I go back..."
