Laci D.,"El Cajon, CA",1,14,,5.0,6/9/2010,"I Love BJ's! Their pizza, pizookie and tropical mojitos are very good!!! I've been to this location a few times and it's always very empty. It's nice not having to wait for seating and having our food come quickly."
Lina L.,"Chula Vista, CA",2,97,3,5.0,6/12/2009,"The last time I went here was back in the beginning of March and I was very disappointed and wrote a bad review.  We went here today for lunch, it was myself, my husband and daughter.  My daughter chose the place to celebrate a good school year. Well, I don't know if we just chose to go on a good day or got a good waitress or if they just improved from all the bad reviews from when they first opened...but our experience this time was extremely good. We went around lunch time.  It was actually pretty packed inside.  We were seated immediately.  Greeted by our waitress within minutes.  Drinks given right away.  We ordered and food was out within maybe 15 minutes or so.  Not too long of  wait at all.  She even came to check on us several times.  During weekdays up until 2p I believe, they have a small lunch menu.  I didn't order off of it, I just decided to order what I usually order which was the pot roast, I kinda wish I just ordered something off the lunch menu for cheaper because the pot roast was SO full of fat and the gravy was salty, but I didn't complain.  My husband ordered off of the lunch menu though and got the half sandwich with salad.  The salad was pretty big for a side salad.  His sandwich, which you get to choose from 4 or 5, was a half sandwich, but pretty large.  He got the chicken club.  It was really tasty and it came with a side of fries.  His meal was only $6.95.  Thats really a good deal.  My daughter ordered her usual off the kids menu...chicken tenders with happy face potatoes, which she loves!  Plus her birthday is in 3 days, but I just told the waitress she was celebrating her bday too and she brought her a free pizookie, which is the reason my daughter even chose BJ's is because of the pizookie!  And there was candle on top, which made her feel even more special.  But as our waitress said when I asked if they sing too, ""she said, no and thank goodness we don't""  Haha.  I thought it was funny.  My daughter was fine with a free pizookie in which she chose chocolate chip.  If anyone goes to BJ's...you cannot leave without trying a pizookie! Our visit this time was definitely A LOT better than the last.  Service was great and speedy plus the food was great.  We are thinking of coming back for fathers day because we saw a sign that says all dads get a free BJ's pint glass and my husband liked it! (haha)"
iliana l.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,4,,2.0,10/10/2009,"Although the food was awesome the service SUCKED!!!! I guess the waitress wasnt used to a big group of people because she was lacking a lot it took her 30 Min's to get our drinks and another to take our orders not to mention she had an attitude problem. I was so fed up with it and asked for the manager, he was even worse very impatient and rude didnt care that we were waiting an hour for our food for an hour  (I know we were a big group but it doesnt not take an hour to cook our food(mostly pizzas)) and didnt even bother to apologize I didnt get his name but avoid a BALD manager you better off dealing with the service people there. The only helpful person was a guy that was picking up dishes. Now that is sad. I dont know how they are going to say in business. I say stay away from here its just not worth it. Give your money to someone that wants it..."
Edwin O.,"San Ysidro, CA",213,177,32,5.0,4/6/2011,"I came here for Lunch and let me tell you the Food was amazing, I give 3 stars. We had the sliders, Pasta Chicken Alfredo, Chili (was SUPERB) and the best tasting Bacon and MAc N cheese I ever had. Another Star because their specialty drinks were at a GREAT price. Minus one star because of the unfun Bartender we had.  SOOO, We ate the bar, I expected a fun upbeat bartender, but no, we got the one who wasn't. She didn't even clean an area for us to sit at when we arrived. I kind of hinted like ""Do I sit here?""even though there was a mess.. On the Other hand, She was super nice to the lady's, she was even friendly with my friend. I Definateley would come back, A Great resteraunt down here for Chula Vista and San Ysidro, why go Seau's.chilis, or Fridays. I'm coming here! Oh did I mention at the bar they had a JUMBO Tron and put on the Real MAdrid game for me! OK, Ok, 5 stars just because This place is awesome, But Bartender you need to step up your service!"
Marcia R.,"Chula Vista, San Diego, CA",0,8,,1.0,1/12/2014,"Horrible service from our waiter Adrian. First of all, I could barely understand him and when I asked him to repeat himself he sounded irritated with ME! He didn't know the drink menu and when he came back with our drinks he gave us the wrong drinks. When we repeated our drinks he basically was like ""well that's what I have"" and didn't bother asking us if we wanted the correct drinks. Then he didn't bring us all of our order. He didn't ask not one time if we were satisfied or wanted anything else. The other waiter dropping off our food did. He didn't give us the time of day and kept leaving even before we were done ordering. I never ever complain about service but it was so horrible I had to. He even was rude dropping off our check. I was more upset because my bf was home from military training and we chose to go to Bj's to have a disrespectful waiter. To top it all off after talking to the General manager who seemed very apologetic, he ended up giving is a courtesy card with NOTHING on there. So really I'm like done. After coming here so much I've never had such horrible service and the GM topped it all off for me."
Julio M.,"San Diego, CA",31,138,10,5.0,4/25/2011,han an awesome time sitting at the bar and eating appetizers and trying appetizzers.. super awesome selection of beers and high end restaurant . thanks michelle ( bartender)  for such great service!
gary p.,"San Diego, CA",23,17,6,4.0,6/26/2011,good experience! we went for my son's 26th birthday and service was good and friendly.With a Vegan and vegetarian in our group its important to get the order correct and our server did a great job.The food was tasty and flavorful.
Mike G.,"Chula Vista, CA",41,14,2,3.0,3/19/2009,"THE SERVICE HERE IS THE WORST. But man their food is delicious. It's also a plus that you can call in your party ahead of the time to be seated. Regardless of the service I will continue to go... BUT first... In the numerous times I've been there the service has always been average or below it. If you want to order their awesome cream soda do so before 10am because they always seem to have ""ran-out."" around dinner time. But even if they do have the awesome cream soda available... it takes 20 minutes to get it. Once that's received you have to be really good at waving your hand or politely yelling ""Excuse me."" to get any waiter or waitress' attention. Then you can order... and wait another 40 minutes to get your food. Make sure you you bring some playing cards or have full cell phone battery to entertain yourself during the wait.  A bottled water or can of Coke is also necessary 'cause the waiter won't come by at all during the wait. Oh and God forbid you have to split the check... one of my waitresses said, ""Oh? Split check? Yeah.... we can.... well.... it takes 45 minutes to split it up."" Seriously, Terrible Waitress?! 45 minutes? Liar. Just stop being lazy. Recommend the Turkey Club, Spicy Tomato Spaghetti, Sante Fe Salad and the Tuscan Tomato Bisque soup. Note to BJ's staff: I will continue to go back because the food's good and it's one of the finer establishments in west Chula Vista... but that's no excuse to suck at service. And I still give you guys a tip above the minimum 15% because I'm a good guy. I also understand that Uno's is no longer your competitor but still... just be cool and tad more prompt."
Georgie A.,"San Diego, CA",23,45,11,5.0,11/8/2008,so i had the privilage of having dinner at this new location this week. its official opening is monday i believe. BJ's has the bomb pizza. enough said. try the medditeranian(or however you spell it) its great. this place is nice and warm looking inside. the bar is stocked. great beers on tap! all employees were in training the past week so i will prolly update my review(as far as service) after i visit next week.
Colleen S.,"San Diego, CA",1,2,,1.0,2/5/2010,"I was so excited to learn there was a BJs in Chula Vista once I moved down here! I have been to the Grossmont location countless times and have never been disappointed. The Chula Vista location sucks! I always order the giant baked potato and they seem to be regular sized potatoes here. I mentioned it once and they said they would get me a new one, but then returned to let me know that they were out of potatoes and offered a dessert instead. Most recently I went there on a Monday evening when it was not crowded at all, but the service was definitely lacking. We had a party of 6 and 3 people ordered the 7 beer taster sampler and the waiter made some snide remark about making his job difficult. I asked if I could order the onion string appetizer that is no longer on the menu and he assured me I could. He came back a bit later and I put in my order for a potato in hopes of receiving a giant one that I could share with the hubby. The waiter hung out by the bathroom chatting with some other waiters never checking on us and finally they bring out two entrees. Where on earth is my gd appetizer?! So they bring out my not giant potato and the waiter then tells me it is taking a bit longer for the appetizer since it is not on the menu and it is a ""process"". Hey buddy thanks for letting me know it was going to take almost an hour to get my appetizer which I would have gladly canceled had you given me any sort of warning.... If you want to go to BJ's don't go to this location."
Angela M.,"San Diego, CA",32,19,,4.0,1/7/2011,"Hit up BJ's, lol, (""that's what she said"") and it was pretty good. The service was great! Staff were available and friendly. The food was good, the atmosphere is really nice, and it wasn't busy. My least favorite aspect was the menu. Oh the menu! Over twelve pages of items to choose from. Granted most of it is beer (duh, it's a brewery) but it seems overloaded with unnecessary choices, or repeats of the same thing just packaged differently. Our server came to our table THREE times before I had actually finished reading through the whole thing and chose what I wanted for dinner. Some people may think that's a good thing, ""so much variety"" but for me, it was a waste of time. I'd prefer a simpler menu, with a few awesome items, than a zillion items packaged differently with different names. Anywho, all in all a nice place to eat, with friends, on a date, or with family. My husband and I went on a Thursday night, with our five year old daughter, and we all enjoyed ourselves. We will go back again."
Loli R.,"Bonita, CA",939,11,14,5.0,1/4/2011,"food was good, Service was better .. yumm ! Avocado rolls !"
david s.,"San Diego, CA",2,5,5,1.0,8/27/2010,"I went to this BJ's last night. Went with 5 other friends for dinner at around 10. There was maybe a total of 6 parties all together in the restaurant which isnt that many compared to the size of the place. We got our drinks rather quickly and the waitress took our order right away. Time goes by, too much time. 45 minutes later I ask one of the guys if he could check up on our food. Not one time did our waitress come to check up on us. Needless to say we all needed after 45 mins of conversing!! And just like magic, as soon as we asked him about our food, here comes the waitress with our food. I do not understand why it took so long to make our food with the restaurant being almost empty. My friend ordered a steak which didn't come out the way he wanted. Another friend ordered some pasta which she said tasted a little cold and her breadstick was stale as well. And to top it off, she found a hair in her pasta. Of course our waitress didn't know this because she never checked up on us untill the very end. Which is also when everyone finally got refills. The only good thing about the experince there is that she was able to split the bill according to how we wanted to pay and the bar we went to afterwards. And no, we didn't not leave a tip. Will never go back there again."
Barbara S.,"San Diego, CA",156,81,40,2.0,3/10/2009,"I've been meaning to write about this place. i was excited to see a brewhouse in the South Bay. Unfortunately, this place was way below average. The service was Terrible. The waiter was very very rude and ignored all our requests. He actually sighed at me when I flagged him down to ask for sugar for my iced tea. WTF? Then the food arrived, and my husband got his and I did not get mine... Oh and did I mention our appetizer came AFTER our food. What is that. My husband was almost done with his dinner when mine finally came and it was COLD, not just tepid but super cold. I couldnt find the guy to ask him to warm it up so I ended up taking it home (ate the appetizer). So sad, I like the decor of this place and I'd like to give it another shot but i am seeing that the other reviews echo my complaints about service. I hope thier management reads this stuff and gets the place in gear. Until then, if you are in a hurry or getting dinner, go somewhere else, this place seems better for drinks although those took an eternity too... Lets hope it gets better. in this economy, people need to try harder."
Cary M.,"Chula Vista, CA",3,51,,1.0,1/21/2010,"The prior reviews say it all..................EXTREMELY POOR SERVICE!! I thought I would give it another try after my last bad experience with poor service.  Even e-mailed management through their website and told them of the experience and they made it right and sent me a gift card to give them another try.  I did but I happened to use it in their Huntington Beach location.  Well things haven't changed much in the Chula Vista location.  It went downhill from the beginning when the waitress was taking our order she literally, without saying a word, walked to the next table to help them with something......came back to us like nothing had happened!  Service sucks bad here and the food is nothing to write home about.  Plus it is not like they are giving the crap away, it is way overpriced.  We will never return to this location.   Evidentally this place didn't get the memo on ""customer service""!"
Edward A.,"San Diego, CA",0,1,,2.0,11/12/2008,"Overall I had a great experience at the Bjs in East County. So i decided to give the Chula Vista Location a try. We were happily greeted by the hostess, sat at a table. Drink orders were taken and so on and so fourth.  About 20 minutes after we ordered the waitress told us they ran out of an item, but was unclear of item they ran out of. She informed us that the manager was going to talk to us and offer something else.  First of all you just opened how are you going to run out of something. Secondly why did it take 20 minutes before they informed the guest.  The manger was very blunt and offered random menu items to accommodate me. But nothing else sounded enticing. Dinner came. It was mediocre at best, I know it being Bj standards have to be set and i feel like it was not.  Pizookies are suppose to be their well known dessert. It is a freshly baked cookie with ice cream. So I would have to guess that they would have this technique down and set in stone. unfortunately my cookie was over cooked and hard, and the other Pizookies at my table were well baked. Soft, chewy and moist.  Overall service was decent. But the food is Horrible. Next time I go there I am just going to go for the drinks and hopefully then, they don't mess that up."
Vincent L.,"Chula Vista, CA",36,31,137,3.0,3/10/2010,Really nice place with great atmosphere. The only things I've tried there are the Pizza and beer. Both are great no major complaints.  Service was a little slow and trying to grab the waitress was a little bit of a hassle. A little on the pricey side but it's good quality deep dish pizza and beer. If you like Uno's you'll like this place. I actually think this place is better than Uno's
tammy n.,"Chula Vista, CA",95,58,,1.0,3/30/2009,"i ate at BJ'S in san jose so i figured we would go here for dinner... the wair took 5-10 minutes. seriosuly there were hella seats open.  we finally get seated. the server some white chick forgot her name.asks us for our drinks n see if we want appetizers helal rushing us. we just sat down forreals. anyways after we ordered waiting hella long cuz we got a pizza the bjs favorite. its alright. and i got the chardony(spelling?) shrimp pasta. THE PASTA WAS WATERY. NO SAUCE AT ALL. THE SHRIMP WASNT PLUMP LIKE THE MENU SAID. so i asked for more sauce on the side. fuck it must have been some special sauce cuz when i got it, it was a different color from my orginal pasta sauce. NASTY! im nto racists or anything but let me tell you our server SUCKED!!!!! so we sat next to a middleclass looking family with one daughter. (they were a white family so was our server) and damn our server gave them the best fucking service ever. she served them their pizza.like put that shit on a plate for them and everything. she didnt even give us out pizza some other dude did. ohh and when i wanted to take food home she just handed us boxes and dipped. but when the table next to us took food home. the server packed their shit for them. seriously i was annoyed. its probably she thought she wasnt gonna get a good tip from us!?( im asian and i was with 3 military guys)  whatever. i was annoyed. i didnt want to tip ther server but we still did. but forreals i felt like she didnt want to help the minorites. lols. im over it. i wont eat here again! OHHH and their beer sucks!!!!!! the BJ'S in san jose is way better!"
Jimmy G.,"Chula Vista, CA",4,20,,1.0,9/21/2009,"I've been to this place maybe 7 times total with 3 of them being at the Chula Vista location.  First of all, never had a problem with the La Mesa location other than the food was ok, nothing to really go back for.  I've been here three times once after I found out Uno's was closed and a couple with friends just because they really wanted to go.  First the food...it's just bland.  Had the deep dish pizza and it's nothing to write home about.  Uno's was a much better restaurant than this place just didn't have the beer or decor to back it up.  Second and worst of all, is the service.  Everytime I've been there I've either experienced lazy servers, messed up orders, long waits for food.  Also waitresses with attitude.  This isn't Dick's Last Resort.  The service is terrible.  I actually came to write this review after another friend mentioned the terrible service at this location.  I know management or whoever has to read the reviews here.  Do something about your staff."
khristian c.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,3,,5.0,12/22/2008,I had never tried Bj's before and i was  suprised that i was able to go with my family. The employee that served us was so nice she gave us an idea on what is good on the menu and i gotta say try the barbecue beef sandwhich is the bomb! ans since we were newbies to the place they let us sample a drink for free at no extra charge!
