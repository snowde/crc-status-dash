Maria E.,"San Diego, CA",58,59,166,2.0,11/28/2016,"The atmosphere and decor are nice enough, but I don't recommend coming to this particular BJ's. The food is really hit-or-miss. Do not order the wedge salad. Hopefully they stopped serving that because it was terrible. The beers are good, but not good enough to make up for the horrible service. The service is super slow (it can take an hour to get your food!) and they forget to bring out things you order, even after you remind them multiple times. If there is a problem with your order, they are super reluctant to correct the issue. The staff also just shoves past you as you are walking through the restaurant."
Ana B.,"Chula Vista, CA",331,73,29,3.0,5/27/2016,"I like BJ's! I love their club sandwiches and flatbread, but I also like that they have a pretty good selection of alcohol here. I usually don't care for dessert at restaurants and don't normally order it on a regular basis, but I always make sure to order a Pizookie. They also have a smaller size available in case you're trying to diet or don't feel like eating as much of it. Of the multiple times I've visited this location, I've only had quick and amazing service once, but I usually don't care about how slow my service is if the food is awesome. Which it is. The cool thing is that there are a lot of people who come here, but I've never seen it SO busy, where I have to wait real long for a seat. I am always seated almost immediately. Anyway, this place has good food...for good service, maybe go elsewhere. Also, try to check in here as much as possible as Yelp does sometimes offer pretty good discounts here!"
Fabian L.,"San Diego, CA",3,7,,2.0,5/8/2017,"Food was good but service was so slow. They weren't even busy or short staffed. Just a bunch of workers there chit chatting with each other instead of doing there job. Other tables that got there after we had already ordered, got there drinks first because they had a more attentive server. Then my salad and wife's soup arrived after our entrees. It took so long that I  thought they just forgot about them or didn't put in the order. We sent them back and won't be going back to this location agai"
German S.,"San Diego, CA",25,2,,5.0,3/24/2017,"This is a great place for dinner, had a great experince with the hostes and waiter(George ). Food was excelent and serve fast, great tasting beer. Will defenetly go back. Thankss for having quality employees."
Erendira M.,"Chula Vista, CA",23,16,7,5.0,3/24/2017,My son received a free meal from his school ... The Manager came out and presented him with a pin and congratulated him ... It was very sweet .. The food was awesome .. I have lots of dietary restrictions and there menu had good options .. the waiter was very understanding as well ..we will be back for sure :)
Deena N.,"Canoga Park, CA",103,33,29,5.0,2/6/2017,"First of all we come here often and haven't had one complaint. This time though our pizza was off, and of course we didn't want to complain, but our server George knew we were that happy so he grabbed the manager Josh and he literally went into the kitchen and RE- MADE THE PIZZA HIMSELF!! Long story short the pizza cane out perfect, and the service was so amazing. Definitely fixed it and we left super full and happy!  Thank you Josh and George!"
Tash G.,"Chula Vista, CA",1,66,17,3.0,5/7/2017,The service sucked but the food was good. Table wasnt clean they took forever to clean it. Server forgot my fries and ketchup. They were just bad. But I would go to the other bjs. Food was delicious and there coupons are awesome.
Chris H.,"San Diego, CA",0,4,,5.0,8/10/2017,"Since when did BJ's become the newest hotspot to get local beer? Well apparently they have been working hard on getting the best tasting beers of San Diego County for us to try! Our server Ryan offered us what he dubbed as the Taste of San Diego, included Resident: Walk of Shame, .396 Alesmith, Fall: Magical & Delicious and Mangoveza made by Lattitude 33. A 4 set taster for under $7. This was just a visit to grab a quick bite before going to catch a movie and it turned into an fun experience, we will be coming back all the beers were full of flavor, they had so many more selections we will be back to try! I had to write the names down so we can try them again. Thank you Ryan or as he said people call him the Big Kahuna!"
Ellie B.,"San Diego, CA",279,350,24,5.0,11/7/2016,"I came to Bj's for the first time on Thursday with my co-worker. I had the Seared Ahi salad, it was amazing, and my worker had the salmon with quinoa. We shared our entree's and we agreed that both items were amazing. We plan on coming back soon during our lunch break."
Denise M.,"Chula Vista, CA",4,30,58,1.0,5/23/2017,"Do not eat here at night. Service is very slow, they do not have a sufficient amount of staff working. Only one person was waiting tables at the bar section. A salad took 30 minutes to come out and after the food came out it, it took another 40 minutes to ask us if we wanted anything else and we got dessert which of course took another 30+ minutes to make. The salad was plain I could make it at home and the clam chowder was nothing special better off buying some from vons. Save your time and money. The star is for the pizookie. Just come for that. But that's still not that special"
Joy M.,"San Diego, CA",428,426,9110,4.0,3/5/2016,"We always love BJ's. One of our fave spot to eat drink and be merry ! They have a good rewards program the more you come and visit the more you get discounts and free stuff. All time Favorites are always the arugula beet salad and calamari appetizers. Love the quinoa salmon and Pizzaz too. Decent price. Overall good CS, delish food and booze, nice bar, ambience and great vibes! But very loud and noisy. Overall highly recommend bring the whole family and friends. Don't forget to sign up their rewards program. Parking is easy and free they're located in the Chula Vista mall. Peace!"
Nicole W.,"San Diego, CA",2,15,7,2.0,10/23/2016,"My family and I come here often to eat (it's one of our favorite places) and I ordered the French dip for the first time ever, the first sandwich was amazing and as I was about to eat the second sandwich, I turn it over and the bottom was molded.  When we brought it up, the server said ""any idea of what you would like so I can tell my manager?"" And I said, ""yeah I'd like a new half a sandwich and removal of the order off of the bill. 5 minutes later he comes back and explains that it was just blue cheese that was stuck to the bottom of the bread and that their bread comes in daily because they run out every day.  They bring me a whole plate and they never removed it off of my bill. While I appreciate the explanation, I know what mold looks like and I just feel like the customer service was handled poorly by management. Safe to say I won't be returning to this location any time soon."
Brenda H.,"Chula Vista, CA",91,54,26,1.0,4/8/2016,This place sucks!  Food was good. Service was HORRIBLE! They never checked on us. Took half an hour to get service. Left no tip. we asked for the check and it took forever to get it. Nice place though! Just wish they customer service was as lovely as the place.
Jay D.,"San Diego, CA",33,23,10,2.0,1/14/2017,"The wait time at the door was fine yet the wait time after being seated to get appetizers and drinks took a while. For the most part the main entrées were good, though I couldn't say the same thing for the appetizers. I don't recommend any. The appetizers got me sick and couldn't even finish my food and beer. It'll be a loooooong time before coming back."
Katrina A.,"San Diego, CA",261,77,241,3.0,11/13/2016,"My boyf suggests this place every time he has a chance on our outings. Either w my family or his or even if it's just us on our own. This usually is never my first choice or an option. The food isn't horrible it's just not great either though. Or maybe just isn't something I crave. This time around, we came because we needed somewhere close by the AMC at the Chula Vista mall which is what landed us here. We got seated right away because they offer to reserve a table or check in through their mobile app so we did that prior to arriving here.  Our server started us with our drinks and by the time he brought the drinks back we were ready to place our order.   1) clam chowder in a bread bowl 2) guacamole burger  3) jalapeño burger  4 gluten free flatbread Pizza w pepperoni & jalapeños  A food runner came back with the first 3 items and I thought mine would just be coming out shortly? A few seconds after the runner dropped the food off the server approached our table and said ""were missing something aren't we?"" Hum yeah JUST my food....   (How did he forget my order? It was literally the last thing and we had a conversation about the pizza as well.) Anyway- by the time I got my food everyone was pretty much done eating but that's fine. Cool thing is he gave me a free salad to eat while I wait so at least I still ""was eating with my boyf and his family"" The manager came to the table and offered to remove it off the bill and emphasized and said those pizzas cook fast. Well, I'm sure everyone has their days or maybe the server was having something on his mind but every time he asked if we needed something at that time if we needed, ranch, a refill on our drinks he ALWAYS forgot we literally had to be like ""hey man still waiting on the ____"" at least 3-4 different times. Seemed like everyone at the table enjoyed their food. I was the only one who had some slices left over to ask for a box."
Andrea C.,"Fayetteville, NC",27,8,5,1.0,1/2/2017,ive been to this location twice and ive had a horrible experience both  but today was completely ridiculous  we got seated at 8:07  we were a  group of 11 and all of the people got their food 40 minutes after my friend and i ordered a clam chowder soup we didnt get our soup until 9:50 and there was no help from the waitress who didnt refill  our drink  until we asked and only my cup. after  she brought my soup she said the manager was going to come and apologize and 15 min. he came and said the soup was on  the house and offred 2 desserts for free that took 15 minutes to get to our table ....NEVER AGAIN  THE WORST COSTUMER SERVICE  IVE RECIEVED  IN MY LIFE ..next time ill probably  go to rubios to grab a taco than wait an hour for a salty soup.... the manager messaged me on yelp but when i reaponded she didnt respond .. so i think they all are just unprofessional
Matthew G.,"San Diego, CA",20,14,3,2.0,1/2/2017,"This review is specifically for service on January 2nd, 2017. We've eaten here several times with great food and great service, but for some reason, on this day, the food was subpar and the service was to blame for that. We were seated and ordered our appetizers shortly after drinks arrived. The appetizers would have been excellent if served on time, but it was evident that they sat under the heat lamp for too long. The spinach stuffed mushrooms were starting the shrivel and the avocados in the egg rolls had browned. While the flavors were mostly there, much of the texture was lost and made the food barely palatable.  Once the entrees arrived after a long wait it was also evident that the same problem occurred with the main course as well; the food had been prepared in a timely manner, but service left it under the lamps too long. The top layer of our food was dry. The vegetables had no vibrancy, the top side of the chicken and the sausage and shrimp were dry.  From a culinary standpoint the marinara in the shrimp and asparagus pene was bland as if no seasoning was used at all and the Cajun Jumbolia was over seasoned.  This isn't usually a problem. Again - we've eaten here many times before. Today was just a bad experience. We hope next time that heat lamps won't ruin the experience."
Destany S.,"Spring Valley, CA",17,123,74,2.0,6/7/2017,"Usually I would give BJs a thumbs up, however I've been to this location twice now and it's been complete chaos each time. I am not sure if the communication between server and kitchen is completely lacking or what the issue is. I came last week with a party of three and we all had issues with our food. Uncooked asparagus and calamari, cold food all around, burger over cooked, etc. above all these issues, once our food was fixed and we finished eating, they came out with a second round of all of our food thinking we hadn't been served yet. What a waste of food! Luckily we had a great server who was well equipt with great customer service. I can't remember his name but he was serving us in the bar area."
Anjelica M.,"Chula Vista, CA",10,11,1,1.0,5/29/2017,"Where do I start???? This establishment has gone down hill since I last came here a few years ago. Starting from the service to the poor quality food. It took over 45 min to get our order. The food was luke warm down to my raw broccoli. Additionally, my Goddaughters order was put in wrong and she had to wait for that. I must say...the only good thing was the Pizookie. I might consider coming back for that...maybe...NOPE!"
Leanna S.,"San Diego, CA",159,52,49,3.0,11/13/2016,"This place was decent. Nothing too extreme and nothing too trashy. It's a decent restaurant with lots of choices. I didn't really like what I ordered though - a deep dish pepperoni pizza. It was just not something that excited my taste buds. However, the clam chowder I ordered was great! A litttle salty but not too shabby. The main pizza dish took a while to come out to be honest. But what stood out to me about this visit was the amazing customer service. My waitress was extremely knowledgeable about what was in the menu, any sides that I had questions about, etc. she was great. With these places it's a hit or miss with the service and my friend and I tipped her well because she did great. Wish I caught her name. overall, short wait to be seated, long wait for food, basic tasting food, but great service."
