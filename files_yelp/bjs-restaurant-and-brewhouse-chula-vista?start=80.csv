Bruce H.,"LAKE VIEW TER, CA",1,107,345,3.0,4/26/2017,"Typical BJ's,  they all look pretty much the same.  I always sit in the bar area to eat and have cocktails.   When I was here on a Wednesday night ( came in for the 10pm happy hour)  business was light but service was slow.   I had the mini chicken bbq  pizza, not bad.  I will probably be returning."
Elyse R.,"San Diego, CA",170,102,102,1.0,10/15/2016,"It's so unfortunate that I have to write this review but I feel like if nothing is said, nothing will change. We come here a few times a month. We always sit at the bar, have a couple glasses of wine, and order food. Every time we come here the bar tender/servers are awesome! Hence, why we keep coming back. I'm in customer service myself and I am a flight attendant for a reputable airline who is ranked #1 by JD Powers every year in customer service. I'm very big on customer service and making our customers feel welcomed, always have a smile on my face, and I do all I can to make sure they are enjoying themselves.  Today, once we sat at the bar. The bar tender Solimar never said hello to us. When he gave us the menus he was not pleasant, and still no greeting. It was awkward. It took a while for us to get our drinks and there were only 4 others sitting at the bar. He kept walking passed us and never once checked in with us. We finally had to ask him if we could order food... who does that?! We should never have to ask, he should be on top of it. Again, we felt so awkward. The food that was brought out to us was the wrong order and this happened TWICE. We gave up because we never got the right appetizers we ordered. Plus, those wrong items were on our bill. Horrible customer service. He never refilled our cocktails and never asked us how our food was. The other customers at the bar were complaining too. One gentleman only ordered a beer and poor guy waited so long for a refill and he was so frustrated. We did nothing nothing wrong to deserve service like this. Solimar didn't care to make the situation right. We shouldn't have to go out and pay for horrible customer service. We had to ask him for everything and we don't understand why he kept avoiding his customers at the bar. We were in a hurry to leave because this ruined our evening. All we wanted to do was get out of this place. I wanted to write this review in hopes that BJ's management will address this issue. Maybe Solimar was having a bad day but when you come to work, you come prepared and ready to work. I'm pretty easy going and I understand things can get pretty hectic but all the customers at the bar seemed upset. I hope that this issue is addressed.  I really enjoy coming to this BJ's and the hospitality but today something seemed to be way off."
Leona R.,"Spring Valley, CA",403,126,109,1.0,12/20/2015,"I ordered a pizza and when it came out (without me adding it because IT DID NOT HAVE IT ON THE MENU) there were pepperoncini peppers on it. i didn't think there would be peppers to look for mixed in with my artichoke hearts and under the cheese and when i started eating it my throat starts to get VERY itchy VERY fast...IM ALLERGIC TO PEPPERS -_____-  waitress comes over and i tell her so she tells the manager and he comes over and says, ""I'm so sorry let me get you another pizza, what else do you want? what can i get you?"" blah blah blah. i tell him nothing i already ordered a margarita and i just want a new pizza so that i can go home (in case my reaction gets worse) fast forward to the time for my bill to come, (a new pizza came out without peppers) and my bill is the full amount!! like what the hell?!?! uhhhh you just almost killed me and you want me to pay for that pizza??? how is the manager going to ask what can he get me, what i want, like you should have just said, ""what else can i get you for you to pay for later."" i had to call the manager over to tell him i refused to pay for the pizza because i didn't think i should have to pay for something that just made my damn throat half close up. he said he guessed he could take it off but i still had to pay for my margarita?? -____- even my waitress said the manager was wrong and should have comped everything from the beginning.  Like i could have died and i had to explain why i should get my pizza for free and you even had to sit there and think about it and you guess i dont have to pay for it?? people get free meals for some cold food, death by peppers constitutes a comped meal. horrible, i'll never eat here again."
Angeli G.,"La Mesa, CA",117,160,278,5.0,3/23/2016,Came to this location of BJ's! Came here for drinks & pizookies!  My friends & I did the trio since there was only three of us. They both got the cookies & cream and I got the white chocolate macadamia nut! So delicious and wonderful aroma! I got the Alabama Sunset drink which was really good and not to sweet!  Our server was so nice & always checked up on us.  Great customer service!
Maya P.,"San Diego, CA",37,17,10,5.0,4/9/2017,"Nice, relaxing Sunday Funday with my family. Michael was so awesome!!!!! Best customer service I have had in a while."
Sarah P.,"San Diego, CA",10,34,3,2.0,4/29/2017,Went to BJ'S for lunch to celebrate my son's birthday. There was a reservation  for 20 people but over 30 people showed up. We were assigned 1 server by the name of Dante G. We should have had a least 1-2 more servers. It took an hour just to get our drinks.  Couple more friends showed up and order through another server and got their food before ours. GO Figure. Drink refills were slow too. The manager and I spoke after my review and was very apologetic and interested in how it could have been a better experience. She also did not want to lose our patronage and provided some gift cards which are much appreciated.
Eye C.,"San Diego, CA",0,31,,2.0,2/17/2017,"I'm planning to BOYCOTT this restaurant for constantly running FOX, government-run t.v. And yes, the food is mediocre."
Missy F.,"San Diego, CA",71,120,173,5.0,9/4/2016,"Can't go wrong with BJ's :-) Met up with a friend for lunch. We we were craving steak, but had to start off with a few appetizers. We ordered the Calamari...and got greedy and ordered the Root Beer glazed ribs.The Calamari was very good, nothing special, but good. Now them ribs...OMG very very good. Flavorful sticky and falling off the bone. we couldn't finish them because... well steak was coming. We both ordered the BJ's classic Rib Eye (14oz).. 1 Rare and 1 Medium Rare. These steaks were by far some of the best steaks I had. The steak was juicy and had just the right amount fat on it. No A1 needed.. don't do that to a good steak, there's no need for it. Oh and one more thing.. The service was on point too! I will return again"
Noemi G.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,3,,1.0,5/15/2017,This is not the first time I come to this restaurant but the servers are super slow with service bringing food to the table takes too long not the best place to come I hate it
XRoderick XJr X.,"Spring Valley, CA",16,13,1,2.0,6/18/2016,Server Name BRADLEY M. 2 stars because the dish I ordered was GREAT. (Ahi Tuna Salad) Customer service was terrible. *Spilled water multiple times on table and myself while refilling my glass above my plate. Who refills water over someone's plate?!?! *I requested for a to go box and plastic bag. 5 minutes later I over hear the table behind me ask for the same thing and they got theirs within 3 minutes and I got mines after 7 minutes LATER. *my desert took 25 minutes to come. (ONE Pazookie) I asked for the bill. Came in within 1 minute. Literally!  WTF?!?! I like coming here and their service is Great..USUALLY. But the last 2x was terrible so I had to review this.
Jennifer P.,"San Diego, CA",0,26,,1.0,5/8/2017,"Awful. We came in a few nights ago for dinner. Waiter was terrible; didn't acknowledge us, didn't even bother looking up from his pad ""drinks? ready to order?"" Um ok, we order no big deal. Food took forever to arrive and when it did EVERYTHING was cold. Pizza, chicken tenders (that were breaded beyond belief) fries (cold!), steamed veggies (cold!) and shrimp tacos that looked like they were sloppily thrown together. Everything was disappointing. We had to flag down another waiter to get tabasco and more napkins since our original waiter couldn't be bothered by the three of us. This isn't the first time we've had such a bad experience due to the service and food which is why I felt compelled to leave a review. This place used to be great years ago but the staff and food quality have seriously tanked. The family and I will avoid going forward."
Rachel D.,"National City, CA",115,95,241,1.0,1/29/2017,"I've come to this BJs before with no problems. But I don't know what's going on recently. The last two times we've eaten here which was probably within two weeks of eachother. The service was really bad.  First time I was understanding because the waitress told us she was new. (Why they would give a new waitress a party of 11 people is beyond me.) The food seriously took over an hour to come out. I'm not even exaggerating!  The second time which was last night was just as bad. My sister called ahead to put 11 people on the list for a table, the lady said it wasn't that busy so it shouldnt take too long. When my aunt got there they said my sister told them 5. So they changed it to 11 so we had to wait a bit. Then when we sat down. We put our drinks in and it took forever for our waiter to comeback with our drinks and to take our orders. Twice random staff came to our table with food looking like they were lost. Not sure if the food belong to us. Which it didnt. I can't even count how many times someone in our table had to say...""Where's our waiter?"" That was the theme for the night. My sister asked a lady who brought food to the table if she can get a refill and the lady said ""Oh yea, you're waiter will get that for you."" Like damn! That would be fine if we can find that fool. Is touching the drink machine not in your job title? You can't even say I'll get your waiter. COME ON! Then I heard my uncle from the end of the table ask another lady if a packet of sugar was regular sugar and she said I kid you not she said ""I don't know"" and when my uncle said but you work here she says ""I'm just a hostess"". I saw all he was trying to figure out was which one was regular sugar from the white, pink, and yellow packets. So I had to explain it to him myself. I don't know why someone in food service doesn't know that answer. Fyi hostess lady, the white packet is regular. Seriously I don't know who the manager is at this location but your staff is a hot mess. You guys need to have a meeting or something. Sit them down and read them all these bad service reviews, because you know you have alot of them. & Get it together."
Luis Guillermo L.,"Flagstaff, AZ",35,6,2,4.0,4/17/2017,This review is just for the BAR. Carlos the bartender prepared excellent drinks and provided a great service. The diversity of beers was amazing. I'll definitely visit them again.
John louie L.,"San Diego, CA",251,36,30,4.0,3/9/2017,"First time at eating here, great atmosphere. We sat at the bar area, noticed there was only one waiter but he was totally cool. Full room bit he was on top of it and made sure we were taken care of. Food came out quick and tasted great. Had the dry rub wings and chips."
Dennis H.,"Chula Vista, CA",2,56,131,4.0,9/6/2016,"BJ's is always good eats. Now they have a new lunch menu...looks a little different but new items. If you like grilled cheese sandwiches you'll be happy, happy, happy.  I went for lunch with co-workers and enjoyed the Hot Ham & Cheese: Parmesan crusted sourdough with ham, Havarti cheese and alfredo sauce. With Dijon mustard for dipping. Served with either crispy fries or potato wedges. $8-9 bucks"
SJ K.,"Spring Valley, CA",26,87,46,4.0,3/3/2017,"This past Wednesday night we decided to try BJ's for our family dinner night out. It wasn't very busy, so we were seated right away. Our server (sorry...so bad with names) was a very friendly young man. He did seem like he may have been a bit nervous or shy maybe, either way though he was still friendly & pretty quick. There was a couple moments where we wondered where he was as we needed some refills, but we spotted him ""busting his butt"" around the restaurant, so it was not big deal. Not like some places where the servers just stand around talking..etc. Anyway, that's besides the point. We didn't wait unusually long, so it didn't bother us too much. Appetizers came out pretty quick, we got the spinach & artichoke dip and mozzarella sticks. Both so delicious. Wednesday night special was loaded burgers & unlimited fries for $10 so my husband and I opted for one of the loaded burger options. I wanted to get the guacamole one like he got...but sadly the onions in the guacamole mix prevent that. Oh well, my bacon cheeseburger one was still so juicy & tasty. My daughter decided to go with the spaghetti dish, which she seemed to really enjoy. I got my strawberry margarita and my husband got one of the craft brew beers. I was a little bummed to find that this place salts the glass of the strawberry margarita, so it was a little hard to enjoy the taste whenever some of the salt crept up in the straw. Other than than not really liking the margarita as much, no complaints about the food or the service. I'm sure we'll be back."
Kevin S.,"Chula Vista, CA",1203,71,,5.0,12/5/2016,Awesome restaurant. Top notch service even on an extremely busy night. Food is very good and they have the best selection of beer. We will definitely be back soon and highly recommend! 4-5 star place but can get busy in the bar.
Asm A.,"San Diego, CA",8,33,24,1.0,2/9/2017,"I've gotten take out/curbside at least 4 times from this location and this will be the LAST time. Every time takeout has been extremely slow and I've had to wait and be directed from person to person to find the takeout person. This time for curbside I called and told them exactly where I was, 2 spots from their door. I wait 10 minutes and see no one come out. I call back and am told someone came out and I was not there and this person has the audacity to give me attitude when I tell them again exactly where I am. On top of that my daughter was napping in the car hence curbside to be my choice but by the time they came out she had woken and was screaming. All in all, no apology from staff, horrible service every time. Trust me I will not be coming back nor recommending this location!!"
Ahna K.,"Irvine, CA",134,4,,1.0,3/8/2017,Service was horrible. When we first got to the restraunt we were seated very fast but after the initial seating everything went downhill. The waiter (which was a nice person) but was manning over half the tables and working like that didn't have time to come to our table. After our appetizer and drinks( which once again too were given to us after around 10 or so min) we didn't see our waiter again even for refills of our drinks. After about 20-30 min the waiter who was haphazardly running around trying to get all the tables he was manning he finally came back to our table and took our orders. Which once again we waited 20-30 min for and when we finally recieved the food everything was cold. I am honestly going to say this was 1 of the worst experiences I have had at BJ's and unfortunately will never come back to this location.
Angelita V.,"San Diego, CA",39,19,31,4.0,6/30/2016,"Great service, good food. I'm glad I brought my husband here for Father's Day dinner. We waited over 30 minutes but that's what we expected and that's what it would be anywhere on this special day.It was busy but yet we were served right away. The waiter was fast and courteous. We orders the chicken pesto flatbread pizza as the appetizer and omg it was amazing! The place is nice, clean and it has a great atmosphere.  I had an excellent salad and my husband ordered a Salmon dish both very good. We will definitely dine here again!"
