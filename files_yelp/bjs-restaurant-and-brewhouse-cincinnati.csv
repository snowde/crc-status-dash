Stephanie W.,"Cincinnati, OH",32,90,213,4.0,12/9/2017,Went to BJ's Tri-County for a Christmas Party.  We made reservations a month in advance.  We were told the entire party had to arrive to be seated together. So we told the group the arrival time was fifteen minutes prior to the actual time.  This alleged great.  We were seated in a section towards the back of the restaurant.  Another large party was leaving upon our arrival.  The wait staff worked quickly to clean the area.  We had two servers for our party of 20.   The drinks were great.  I have been here several times and consistently is the key with their food and beverages. I had the Alabama Sunset and it did not disappoint in taste.  It had a few pieces of raspberries in it.  I would highly recommend this drink.   The food was very good.  I ordered Parmesan crusted chicken with cheesey mashed potatoes and seasoned broccoli. My friend order potato skins and boneless wings both were tasty.  My salad never came so I canceled it once the entree arrived. Overall we had a great time the servers were nice and accommodating for our large party and the food eas
Christopher M.,"Pisgah, OH",17,96,232,4.0,8/20/2017,"I'll start by saying I wanted to give BJs a 3/5 as i'm not a huge fan of chains but in the end I had to give it a 4 because I really do always enjoy going there.   Atmosphere: lots of table areas with a large bar and plenty of TV screens so when I meet my family for sunday lunch I can still make sure I get the bengals game.  Its what you expect from a chain brewery I will say though since I am the primary beer drinker in my family it's nice that I still get beers on tap while my family gets a normal restaurant feel. Service: hit or miss, today our server was actually fantastic - they use a point of sale ipad type input device at table side so they can readily deal with all the adjustments to meals that my and my family make.  However, I have certainly had times with mediocre service. Food: watermelon and feta salad is perfect in the summer, burgers are fine however my burger i ordered at medium today was definitely under.  Pizza's are fine however in comparison I think dewey's / pies and pints do a better job of the pizza and beer combo and mad tree does a far better job.  Pizookie cookie desserts are delicious but also approx 8 billion calories per.  The jambalaya is undoubtedly my favorite and a winner Beer: for commercial brewery/chain brewery actually pretty solid - I'll admit I tend to stick to the ambers and wheats - not a big IPA fan.  Overall pretty nice selection  Price is reasonable, and it serves the purpose for me - a nice sunday spot where my family can feel like they are getting a decent post church lunch while I mindlessly say yes to whatever conversation is going on so I can watch the bengals game"
Zaria D.,"Cincinnati, OH",56,103,95,4.0,12/22/2017,Went to this location after having a horrible experience at another restaurant. When we initially arrived are hostess took us to a table that was not cleaned off. We had to request at the table be wiped down. We decided to sit in the bar area and had Desiree as a server. She was open honest and was willing to share about menu items that we might be interested in. I ordered the country fried chicken along with two appetizers the potato skins as well as the spinach and artichoke dip. Spinach and artichoke dip came out as ordered however the potato skins did not know he had to remake them. The food happen to actually come out right after the appetizers. Overall the taste of the food was great. The service by Desiree was good as well. The only thing that I had the issue with is our initial seating as well as my rewards may have not been applied to the bill. I will be back at this location as I really like the food
Avery M.,"Fairfield, OH",0,1,,5.0,1/6/2018,"Great experience tonight 1/6/18. Our server was Kevin and he was very attentive throughout our meal. At the end of our meal we attempted to pay with a gift card we received through email. As it turns out, the email had been scammed and used at a location in California. The manager on duty (pink/red checkered shirt I apologize we did not catch his name) was extremely accommodating and understanding. We cannot thank Kevin and his manager enough for their patience, we will absolutely be back!!  P.S. DO NOT PURCHASE GIFT CARDS THROUGH THIRD PARTY WEBSITES"
Brandi W.,"Loveland, OH",0,46,129,3.0,12/30/2017,First let me say I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants but a friend of ours wanted to go so we thought we would give it a try. Our server was very nice and helpful. The place had a cozy feel even though it was large and open inside. The others in my party enjoyed their food and I would have been able to say the same thing up until I found a piece of plastic cellophane the size of a half dollar in my mashed potatoes ( I got the southern fried chicken) once I found that I had to wonder if I had already eaten some and not noticed. So I lost my appetite and didn't eat the rest of my meal. I didn't complain because my server didn't make it and I figured it wouldn't help. We paid our bill and left quietly. Can't say I will ever go back again. Having said this I gave  it 3 stars because had this not happened I would have enjoyed my meal.
Casey S.,"Cincinnati, OH",113,1,1,2.0,1/6/2018,"The only reason I'm giving this two stars is because the server was decent. Not great, but decent. Other than that, the experience was not good at all. When we walked in, we stood there while 4 employees walked by and didn't even acknowledge we were there. We made our way to the bar area finally because we realized we'd be waiting all night otherwise. My sons veggies were ice cold and hadn't been cooked at all. When we told them about the veggies, the reaction was so dismissive and rude. The calamari was mushy and the food runners were rude. I wouldn't come back. Don't waste your money."
Consuelo R.,"Peoria, AZ",4,8,2,1.0,10/1/2017,"Don't order Togo food. I got a simple boneless Buffalo wings with side of sweet potato fries with extra ranch. The wings barely had any sauce could not taste any buffalo flavor, fries over cooked and only gave me 1 small cup of ranch. I was disappointed to say the least. Ordered with door dash so couldn't do anything about this. I"
Peter A.,"Springboro, OH",0,6,,4.0,1/3/2018,"Great beer, great menu and good atmosphere although it is a bit loud due to open design .  If an error occurs, Management does a good job addressing any issues/concerns.  Highly recommend."
Edmond D.,"Glade Spring, VA",22,2,4,5.0,10/22/2017,"Definitely the BEST meal and brewed beer I've had at any restaurant.  The service was outstanding,  the steak was perfection,  and the atmosphere was so relaxed.  I will definitely look for these restaurants wherever I travel to from now on.  Great place"
Kourtney P.,"Cincinnati, OH",132,3,,1.0,12/7/2017,"Normally BJ's delivers excellent food sms customer service.  Tonight makes me want to walk out!!! The waiter was slow in greeting us,  taking our drink and food orders.  He forgot drinks.  We got our appetizers and they were nasty.  Finally got our food and it was cold!!! The manager did come over but his overall demeaner was not pleasant.  Very unpleasant experience this evening."
Todd T.,"Cincinnati, OH",1,31,,2.0,11/19/2017,Not very good if it's fried is over cooked and full of grease.If it's grilled it's over cooked and burnt.This place is over rated and overpriced.3 out of 8 entree's were sent back
Joe L.,"Cincinnati, OH",68,50,53,4.0,1/24/2017,"I have been waiting to check this place out for a while! My Uncle works near it and raves about it once in a while. Unfortunately, I was there for a work related event and was not able to check out what seemed to be a promising beer menu. Which they brew themselves.  The first thing I would like to mention is that the service was amazing, we were seated in a timely fashion and had our waters very very shortly after. The waitress never let my water reach below half empty, I was impressed. It was busy but not crazy. We had our food within 15 minutes.  The menu is extensive, maybe even almost to big. They offer a wide variety of cuisine. Everything from Mexican to Italian. I decided to go with the Maui Maui tacos off of the lunch menu. They were great! Very filling and light, so I didn't feel awful afterwords.  All in all I would recommend this restaurant for a work related lunch or a date night dinner. The inside is impressive, I am a fan of the decor. It is very welcoming and classy. I plan to check out the dinner menu and the alcoholic beverages in the near future. I also plan to check out the lunch menu as often as I can. You can look forward to my review being altered after I try the beer and dinner!"
Paul K.,"Cincinnati, OH",3,42,27,4.0,2/4/2017,"We got here around noon on a Saturday and was seated promptly. I had the potstickers as an appetizer, very tasty! Then came the awesome tomato bisque! What a great way to start a meal. I ordered the ribeye with the white cheddar mashed potatoes. The steak came out perfectly cooked and very tender. I was not crazy over the seasoning they use though. For my taste there was way too much black pepper. But that doesn't make it bad, the steak was still tasty! Loved the cheddar mashed potatoes. My wife had the Parmesan crusted chicken, absolutely delicious and not at all dry! Service was great, they even brought out samples of fried shrimp which were new menu items being added. The shrimp and cocktail sauce was perfect. Overall a good place, they brew their own beers as well, many selections and styles. Unfortunately this time I was unable to try any...We will be going back for sure!"
Andrew B.,"Mt Lookout, Cincinnati, OH",236,436,1200,4.0,6/22/2016,"BJ's is a really cool restaurant and it seems almost too good to be connected to the almost dead Tri County Mall.  I've been going here for a couple years now but on the last visit I feel I finally found the hidden gem on the menu..four words: Buffallo Chicken Grilled Cheese. So simple sounding yet so amazing..they give you a side of ranch or blue cheese to dip it in too..my mouth is watering just thinking about it. Also on our last visit it was free ""pazookie"" day..it's their signature dessert that consists basically of a chocolate chip cookie and ice cream..simple concept yet tastes amazing. In my opinion it was a brilliant marketing move having free pazookie day because I can't imagine not ordering one every time we go there from here on out. Staff was friendly and efficient as well."
Nicole Z.,"Columbus, OH",77,7,46,2.0,10/12/2017,"The house made root beer is really good but it isn't anything super special. If you want a restaurant where everyone can pick something on the menu, this is the place. Decent chain."
Doug D.,"Hamilton, OH",7,15,3,1.0,9/23/2017,"15 minutes to get seated and when we did I saw at least 6 open tables. The service was extremely slow. It took 10 minutes before I was told my beer selection was sold out and another 5 to get my second choice and take our order. The pizza looked as good as the pictures they use to advertise. Except on my pie 2 of the slices we're laying on top of other slices and while it wasn't cold it was far from hot. It tasted good but the edge of the crust had black soot on it. The best part of my meal was my wife's French fries. The menu is so extensive I don't see how any kitchen staff could focus on quality. Like so many other things in the Tri-County Mall area, BJ's has gone down the tubes."
Taryn L.,"Hamilton, OH",302,25,23,3.0,7/29/2017,"The wood was okay, service wasnt terrible but considering there were only about 6-8 other tables in the entire place it was very slow service."
Jason B.,"San Jose, CA",0,11,,2.0,5/28/2017,"We stopped in on a Sunday evening for dinner. Wait time was over 30 minutes after being told 20-25. Basically, every aspect of dining here was slow! The waitress was slow in eventually coming over to us to the point that we ordered everything all at once. Then the food (2 burgers, doesn't take that long) took forever to come out. At some point the waitress notices and says that a manager is working to get the food ready (We saw him walking around instead, actually). My burger came out lukewarm. We definitely got the vibe that they forgot an order. The manager brings out the food and doesn't mention anything about the wait or about why he was supposedly preparing the food. Just asks about ketchup and bails. Getting the check took a while as well. In total, we were stuck there for over 2 hours from putting in our table request to leaving. The only bright spot was the beer was very solid. We will not be back."
Irwin F.,"Warren, MI",0,278,5,3.0,5/28/2017,As an update - the General Manager called me the next day (on a Saturday to be noted) and apologized. That should reflect possible change in what happened when we went.
Aaron P.,"Marietta, GA",1,15,3,4.0,6/23/2017,Food was good. Wish there was more cheese on the pizza and less pepperoni. The potato skins app was good but a little over good. I really like this restaurant. The pizookie dessert is always a must!
Adam A.,"Cincinnati, OH",61,2,2,4.0,2/20/2017,"One of the best spots to grab lunch or dinner in the tri county area, mostly chain fast food around. I like their lunch deals from 11-3, a good amount of food for under $10 with a nice variety of choices and combos. I usually get the ceasar salad with the half California chicken sandwich with fries, great deal with above average taste. Nice hang out atmosphere with only friendly staff encounters so far. Not fine dining but good sit down food. Specifically like the bar area seating."
Carolyn S.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,13,,1.0,10/9/2017,"Went to this restaurant with my husband for lunch.  Not what it use to be!  They have changed their menu only for the worst.  No longer do they have the Texas Fried Steak (being from there it was always my favorite). The waitress said they removed it because the cooks didn't know how to cook it and it always came out hard so it was sent back.  Instead of teaching someone how to cook one they just remove it from the menu.  My husband ordered the Zita Bake it came out very dry and it was like eating something out of the frozen food section of your local grocery.  In fact, had better ones from Kroger's.  They have also changed their French Fries, much low quality and they were cold, you could tell they had been sitting for some time.  Like everything else at Tri-County Mall this place is on it's way out.  Bet it will not be there in 6 months!"
M L.,"College Corner, OH",2,37,6,1.0,1/2/2017,"Walked into the place and at best it might have been half full. Half the tables were dirty and not cleared. They gave us a 25 minute wait and it took that long. We order our meal and as if this entry it still hasn't made it. I'm Looking around at people seated at the same time we were and they haven't been served yet either, and don't look happy.  Where is management? Why aren't they working on this?! Our friends pizza arrived and it was half cooked and had to be sent back and asked for it to be removed from the bill. All and all, it sucked."
Chantelle A.,"Hamilton, OH",1,15,12,3.0,9/24/2017,"First annnddddd last time being here.  They say first impressions is everything and they're right. Came with a friend and my niece. Waitress was nice,  service was nice,  food was HORRIBLE. We got the appetizer platter and man oh man.  My spinach dip bowl was hot and the middle frozen, my cheese sticks were not hot a stringy, my avocade egg roll was hot outside cold inside. The chicken was warm inside and the sauce outside was cold.  It was like they heat the outter parts and the middle was not done. But they gave us a new meal to go which was hotter at that point I was like whatever.  I  gave it a three for service at least. Food would have gotten 1 star from me."
Shawn W.,"Corryville, Cincinnati, OH",0,3,,2.0,4/22/2017,"Dry, sauceless pizza. Ordered the pizza based on reviews,took a couple of bites and thought they forgot the sauce.  There was just crust,cheese and toppings. I couldn't find any sauce on the pizza.  When we told our waitress that they forgot the sauce, she said that only 2 - 3 tablespoons are put on each pizza and she always orders ""extra, extra sauce.""  She brought us some marinara to dip our very dry pizza in.  The only thing I did enjoy about BJs was the pazookie - it was incredible!"
Patty C.,"Cincinnati, OH",73,132,803,4.0,1/17/2016,"I wish I could rate BJ's a 3.5 - it's not a 4 star rating but I'd rather be generous ;) We've been here a few times before. I'm always amazed at how crowded it is. It's an average restaurant and like my husband says ""nothing special"". Maybe because it's in the mall? I know they're known for beer (obviously) but food wise it's kind of a mish mash free for all.  Ambience is very chaotic and noisy. Since the husband and I wanted to watch the game, we sat in the bar area. In that experience,  I was good with the noise. If I was there for a typical dinner, the noise level would have stressed me out. Along with the 2 kids that were running around (nice parenting). Our server was awesome - he was always on top of things! We got chips and queso  (with the pale ale chili) - it was really frackin' good. Super cheesy and the chili swirled in nicely. My husband got the pig Flatbread (something like that!). He really enjoyed it. I got fish'n'chips - the fish was awesome. Light but crunchy breading. Loved the smaller pieces too. Fries weren't very good but my husband had no issues finishing them off. And because we starved ourselves all day, we got the Pizookie trio - peanut butter, cookies and cream and chocolate chunk. Loved the cookies and cream! Seriously,  can't go wrong with warm cookies and ice cream. It really was a positive experience, food and service wise. But, I hate dining in chaos. If we didn't have a GC, we wouldn't have picked this restaurant."
Bill K.,"Columbiana, OH",0,8,1,1.0,10/19/2016,"Showed up at 530 on Wednesday night to watch MLB playoff game and eat dinner.  Bar TV broke so we had to wait for table.  Requested one by TV and waited 20 minutes to be seated when 50% of tables empty.   Hostess finally called us to be seated and proceed to sit us behind column without a view of the TVs.  We asked for a different table and she said this is ""all I got"".   She said if we wanted a different table we'd need to go back on the waiting list. We said goodbye and you loose $200 dinner check."
Kim N.,"Cridersville, OH",10,91,74,5.0,8/30/2016,"Absolutely hands down the best restaurant to eat! Oh my... the food is amazing! Today I had soup and salad. The mozzarella and tomato salad is unbeatable! I could live on it! :-) The broccoli cheese soup in amazing! Hubby liked the steak! The shared Pazookie (peanut butter) dessert was amazing! This is our third visit to this location and it is clean, the food is amazing, staff excellent, restrooms nice, and not a bad value!"
Tee J.,"Hamilton, OH",3,18,1,3.0,1/27/2017,"I ordered the root beer wings and the fish and chips. In general, I'm very particular and critical about fish and chips. The portion size was great. They were somewhat on the crispy side but the Cajun tarter sauce that came with it was a great mix and overall I think they were great! The root beer wings were also crispier than I like personally but the flavor was an interesting taste. 3 stars because of these price it was a little too fancy for me for a regular night out. But great service everyone was friendly!"
Allen B.,"Granger, IN",17,31,3,5.0,11/15/2016,"I was told by my coworkers (I live in northern Indiana) that I must go here to drink the PM Porter and order the jambalaya and the white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie. I followed my instructions carefully and enjoyed all the recommendations very much. A special shout out to Lindsey, my new favorite bartender. I asked her if she could find me a PM Porter coaster. Since there were none at the bar she went on a mission and brought me a few. She is the best!!!! I will definitely be back. What a great experience!"
Mary C.,"Springboro, OH",0,7,,4.0,8/7/2017,"We ate here on a Wednesday night and chose to sit at the bar. Our server, Priscilla gave us prompt and excellent service. We started with the spinach artichoke dip which was served hot. Most places don't have this step mastered. It was tasty but some of the artichokes had that chewy outer layer which is not a good texture in a dip. I had a chicken entree that was low calorie but high in flavor. It included brussell sprouts which I love but can't find very often at restaurants. My husband had ribs that were tender and well seasoned. The macaroni and cheese was made with quinoa and was delicious and creamy. Priscilla inquired about drinks when our glasses were low which meant we didn't have to interrupt our meal to flag her down.  Dessert was a Carmel sea salt cookie covered in ice cream...also yummy. I love the diversified menu here with lots of healthy choices if you want to avoid the usual bar fare. Will return soon and highly recommend."
Michael M.,"Lexington Park, MD",27,49,22,4.0,11/14/2016,"Really good lunch special: a mini half pizza with a salad for around $8. The pizza and salad were fresh and delicious. The atmosphere was comfortable, and the waiter was friendly."
Eric W.,"Cincinnati, OH",24,10,8,3.0,9/29/2016,"I had never heard of BJ's Brewhouse until a friend suggested we try it out. It an anchor spot at the old tri county mall that I believe was previously an Elder Bearman. I was impressed with the interior upon entering. A huge place, but nicely decorated. I waited for Ben and Lindsay at the bar as they were caught in traffic. A friendly bar tender recommended a pint of their Pirhanna pale ale. Delicious and a bargain at $4 (happy hour?).     My friends arrived and we were promptly seated. The well versed waiter handed us menus that were the thickness of a Harry Potter book. I'm always suspicious of a 12 page menu. Keep it basic I thought. Ben and I had burgers , Lindsay had deep dish pizza. My burger was ok. I found the meat oddly seasoned. The deep dish pizza looked very doughy and crust heavy, sauce and toppings on the light side. We concurred the food was serviceable, but overpriced for sure. I could have eaten a burger at Gordo's, TTC, or Arthur's and for the price of the personal pizza, could have gotten a similar topped large at a specialty pizzeria for the same price.       Service was very good, we all enjoyed our drinks, the food, ehh. Check them out for a game. Get a drink and some apps; skip dinner"
Grzegorz L.,"Warsaw, Poland",3,11,1,5.0,3/6/2016,I only tried beers in this place and I really liked it. You may want to try wheat beer styled on Polish/German beers - as a Polish I may say that it tasted very good and similar to European standards :) A must have in this place is a Kentucky Bourbon Barrel beer but be careful with amount you drink because it quickly kicks in :) 5 stars from me.
Brandon C.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,21,1,5.0,10/30/2016,"Went during lunch and it was significantly less crowded than dinner. The staff was excellent and brought everything out extremely fast. My girlfriend and I had the chicken tacos, brewhouse burger, and pizookie trio. All of it was fantastic! I highly recommend the pizookie trio if you're curious about a few flavors. We got chocolate chunk, oreo, and salted caramel. The chocolate chunk and oreo were our favorites. Highly recommend this place!"
Dana N.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,18,8,5.0,11/13/2016,"I'm giving bjs 5 stars tonight because of our waiter Christopher J.  He was very attentive and timely.  Our food was good except my daughter's spaghetti off the kids menu was bland.  Other than that, the prime rib sandwich, chicken dish and blt flatbread were all great.  Very pleased with the service tonight and had a great experience.  thanks Chris."
Rob X.,"Aurora, IN",27,243,167,5.0,1/7/2016,"This place was very good. I really enjoyed the fact they have an Great selection. German wheat beer is hard to find. This place makes it.  I was allowed to try several samples of the beer. The beer tasted great. I like how they make their own. Food selection was very diverse. The pizza I had was tasty. The noise level was not too bad the wait time for two was quick that day. The staff was friendly and very courteous. This place I would come back to. Great selection of beer,food and pizza. What is not to like about this place."
Macy M.,"Franklin, TN",32,59,231,4.0,4/12/2015,"Stopped in here on the way to Ikea. We were greeted and seated promptly. Our waiter was very attentive and accommodating. This is a great place for groups, as there is plenty of space. The menu is extensive (appetizers, salads, speciality pizzas, burgers, entrees, light menu, etc). They also have a separate lunch menu (M-F) with great prices. They also brew their own beer and have many unique cocktail choices. My boyfriend tried the new Committed IPA and really enjoyed it!  We started off with the corn fritters. Great appetizer and only $3.50! It's a nice starter and enough to share without being too filing. They are soft on the inside and nice and crisp on the outside. They have a good amount of heat from jalapeños and are served with a creamy sauce and corn, bacon and green onions on the plate.  I had the honey crisp chicken salad with blackened chicken instead of chicken tenders. Nice light salad! The salad dressings are good, and they have a good variety. The blackened chicken has a nice spice.  My boyfriend had the crispy jalapeño burger.  It was served on a grilled bun, which is always a plus! The jalapeños were nicely fried and topped with a creamy sauce with a nice kick. Overall, good burger. The fries and wedges are great too! (He did 1/2 and 1/2.)  For dessert, they're known for their pizookies (deep dish cookies). We didn't try one here, but I've had them at another location, and they're amazing! You can even do a sampler trio. This is a bit out of the way for us, but we will be back sometime!"
Jared T.,"Cincinnati, OH",95,89,6,5.0,2/28/2015,"Always a safe bet for lunch or dinner. For lunch: the Turkey Burger or endless soup & salad are solid choices along with any of their burgers or deep dish pizzas. Great lunch atmosphere and they're fairly quick. For dinner: any salad can be filling and their jambalaya is also amazing. In addition, their Irish root beer (BJs homemade root beer with Jameson whiskey) is simply delicious and goes great with any meal. If you ever have room left for dessert than a p'zookie is a must. One suggestion would be to join their rewards program so you get all the perks of earning points, preferred wait list, order ahead, etc. They have a great system here I wish there were more opened up around the country"
Brandee B.,"Cincinnati, OH",172,128,99,2.0,10/20/2015,"I like to go to BJ's Brewhouse because they have a really good happy hour and the best deep dish pizza ever! Its called the great white. It has white sauce with white cheese, mushrooms, grilled chicken, tomatoes, and garlic. It is scrumptious! Unfortunately, I  decided to venture out and try their new starter menu which was the gourmet mac n cheese. I consider myself to be a mac n  cheese connoisseur , and this was just noodles.  It barely had any sauce but lots of breading unfortunately it made my dining experience so so. The only thing that saved it was my good ol standby.  BJ's please up your game next time!"
