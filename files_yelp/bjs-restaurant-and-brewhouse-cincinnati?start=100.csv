Denver L.,"Cincinnati, OH",44,98,13,4.0,2/20/2012,"Craft Beer, Craft Soda's, Deep Dish Pizza, and a piece of heaven called a Pizzokie. Hold on just a second, I'm drooling again. Sunday Beth and I took her nephews to BJ's for there first time. When i lived in OK this was my go to for Tuesday night. Glad to see that this chain doesn't lack in flavor based on locations.  Craft Beer The craft beer selection is very unique, they have a variety from a porter, to a nut brown, traditional wheat, a rye, etc. My favorite is the Nut Brown, a smooth malty beer with a slight roasted grain flavor. Not to hoppy, not to malty, and after a few gives you a case of the grins! I also enjoy the berry cider with desert, a nice sweet cider that compliments very well. Craft Soda's For those of you aren't in the know this place also makes 3 soda's. A root beer, black cherry, and orange creme. The root beer is by far my favorite, this is one of my top 5 places to get a craft root beer in the US. The black cherry is ok, i would wish for a more cola flavor. This could be a competitor for Dr Pepper if they would just listen to me, LOL! The orange creme is not quite a cream siscle flavor but close. This is very nice as a float, HINT HINT. Deep Dish Pizza Let me start off by saying this is not traditional Chicago deep dish pizza. This no way take the place over my beloved Gino's Pizza in Chicago, but its right next to it. I have had every pizza on the menu and so far all i dislike is the sun dried tomatoes on top. After the second pizza I started to remember to ask them to remove them. My favorite is a tie between pepperoni, sausage, and mushroom, Or the denver classic pepperoni, pinapple, and jalapeno. Other entree's The appetizers are always nice and fresh, my mom LOVE the seared ahi. they have many choices on the lunch menu that are very reasonable priced. The salad and pizza for under 500 calories is by far a great way to not overfill on lunch. They have have a light menu. The chicken fresca is very nice and light, my favorite is the Tilipia which comes with rice pilaf and salad. Being allergic to olives i leave the tapenade off. Kid's meals One had spaghetti with rice and rootbeer, while the other went for hamburgers with fries and orange juice. Not sure if they were starving, but they have heard me talk about this pizzokie long enough that they devoured there meals fast. The waiter was also very nice and brought there meals out earlier then ours.  Pizzokie So by now if you dont know what this is take a moment to find a seat. Imagine if you will a 4"" or 6"" thin crust pizza pan. Imagine that pan being filled with your choice of cookie dough, chocolate chunk, peanut butter, oreo, red velvet, oatmeal raisin, triple chocolate, or sugar cookie. Imagine that going into a 410 degree oven and cooking till it was just done enough, but still nice and gooey. Imagine 2 scoops of french vanilla being place on top. I guess i now know why the boys ate there meals so fast! My favorite is the oreo, but the both love the chocolate chunk. They have other deserts like an apple berry crumble and a beneight with strawberry topping. But my heart belongs to my oreo or red velvet pizzokie.  Happy Hour they do have a happy hour menu and pricing at the bar. Its generally $1 off beers, but on tuesday its 50% off wine night. Now you know why this was my tuesday :) Parking was easy enough with this location being in a mall, service was fast and friendly. The bartenders are always chatty kathy when you want them to be. Its just a great place to get to hang out and enjoy. And since cincy doesn't have alot of craft brewhouses, this is a go to me for even though its a chain."
Bill E.,"Delaware, OH",140,428,662,2.0,2/28/2012,"An old friend of mine called and suggested we meet for lunch and since this was close for both of us we agreed on the restaurant. We arrived around 120 and the restaurant was semi full with some business lunches and just casual lunches between friends or relatives.   We both decided on a burger and I had the Jalapeno burger with shoestring fries and a nutty brown ale and my friend ordered the BBQ bacon burger with shoestring fries and a seasonal beer. We each requested our burgers medium rare and they came out medium well and the fries were not seasoned.  Service was good, but kind of in a rush as she stated ""My shift is ending now, I have to leave"", but offered us more water before she left.   I had been here before with my dad for lunch and I have ordered a pizza before and it was OK.  It would be awesome if this BJ's location would brew on site instead of ordering it in from the BJ's in Columbus or Cleveland."
Kelly S.,"Pisgah, OH",1,24,7,4.0,10/31/2014,Pizza flavors are wonderful if you are looking for seriously intense flavors. The menu has something for everyone. Craft beers are nice too.
Olivia M.,"Cincinnati, OH",106,200,423,4.0,6/21/2012,"This is a very good restaurant with a lot of variety on the menu. Its a bit pricey, but the large portions balance it out. Try the dessert pizookie! sooo good"
Christine P.,"San Francisco, CA",70,233,42,3.0,12/30/2011,"An extra star for the beer selection. With the exception of the Brother-In-Law, none of the rest of the family enjoyed our dinner selections.  We started off with two of the eight tasters and had fun going through all the pale and dark beers. We also shared the appetizer platter (avocado rolls were bland, mozzarella sticks were decent, spinach dip was ok and the egg roll-like stuff wasn't that great).  Then the dinner came out and we were not as happy. Spaghetti with meat sauce: bland and they didn't give enough sauce Jambalaya: typical jambalaya but not enough kick Angel hair toscana: bland and they didn't give enough sauce Piranha burger: overwhelming in size but full of flavor (probably the best thing we had) Jalapeno burger: juicy and a little kick The drinks here are good and the portions are generous. Don't come here for the food, though!"
Sarah F.,"Columbus, OH",125,512,202,3.0,12/3/2013,"Meh. I got the pizza, it was ok. I wasn't too impressed with anything and I wasn't too upset about anything. I think I get overwhelmed by places like this with those huge menus, I'd rather have a few really great options than a ton of stuff. I don't drink beer but maybe that is where its at."
Matthew W.,"Dayton, OH",13,10,,5.0,7/18/2011,Imagine if the Cheesecake Factory and Applebee's had a love child who grew up to be a cook that specialized home-brew craft beer and deep dish pizza. The food is excellent and tastes almost homemade.  You don't feel like they just opened up package of mozzarella sticks or avocado egg rolls stuck them in the microwave. The menu is huge.  It is spiral bound similar to the Cheesecake Factory.  The portions are large. They have a massive craft beer collection if you have an appreciation for craft beer.   Tips... 1.  They have a very reasonable lunch menu. 2.  They will bring out beer samples if you are interested in trying a beer out that you are interested in.   3.  All the deserts are  baked to order.  It may take a bit longer to prepare but it is worth it.
Chris G.,"Mason, OH",10,178,19,4.0,10/22/2013,"I travel out to CA quite a bit and had been to at least eight different CA locations of BJs before they opened up here.   We don't come here a lot, due to its mall location.  We have had good service and food on the majority of our visits.  It does get crowded and loud on the weekends and service can suffer.  Their pizzas are good thick crust with chunks of tomatoes.  They have a big menu with lots of different items.   Their beers and root beer are delicious, too; however, our main reason for visiting is their Pizookie dessert.   Yum!  It is a cookie baked in a mini pizza pan served warm with ice cream.  It is big enough to share. They also have a kid sized-Pizookie.   BJs donates money to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation for each Pizookie sold, which is pretty cool."
Toree C.,"Aurora, IN",23,144,36,4.0,8/9/2013,"I have been to this location twice, both times to celebrate an anniversary. The menu has something for everyone, which makes it an easy choice for large groups. If only they had something other than cookies and ice cream for dessert! They boast their house brewed beers and a few sodas, but I haven't had the pleasure of trying either. The food and service are good, the latter being more memorable than the first. The price is right for what they offer, so we'll be there again."
Andrew N.,"Loveland, OH",74,19,1,4.0,4/17/2014,Love this place. Perfect for a date. Not to pricey. The spring rolls are ridiculous! Pizza is very good and so is the southren fried chicken. And make sure you don't miss the triplet chocolate pizzokie. Pow pow!
Amy H.,"Monroe, OH",5,7,,4.0,4/17/2014,"Ate here last night with my husband and our baby, and it was awesome. Our server was really nice, I think his name was Shane. He was really considerate of our needs provided we had a baby with us instead of being annoyed like servers at other restaurants. Their food is awesome, as well as their drink selection. We've never been disappointed."
Dave D.,"Mason, OH",30,89,49,4.0,12/18/2011,Had the Grand Cru. Get a cab. Burgers and pizza always excellent.  Cannot beat the beer selection.
Brieanne S.,"Cincinnati, OH",19,99,,4.0,4/17/2011,Alright once again i hate chains but this place is close to my work so we go here once every 2 weeks or so.  The staff is awesome. We have a favorite waiter who we always visit and sit in his section.  I always order the Teriyaki chicken bowl. its cheaper at lunch but they recently raised the price so now I can barely justify spending that much money on lunch no matter how much i like it. I am on a budget though so you might think differently.
Souky S.,"Sidney, OH",0,6,,5.0,5/6/2015,Great restraunt and the staff was very kind!! Food was simply delicious. We tried chicken and shrimp menu n i'm a big fan of BJ's.
Will B.,"Middletown, OH",0,28,6,5.0,4/6/2015,"I had a great experience here Saturday evening with my girlfriend and mother.  It was rather late, we got there around 10pm, and the place was not busy by any means.  We were seated immediately and our waiter, David was there just as quick.  I had notb tried the New York Strip yet, so I decided on that, and even went with a suggestion from the waiter, which I wouldn't normally have considered.  The steak came out and was incredibly over-cooked, as soon as I pointed it out to the woman who brought it out, she took it away and the head chef was out within 2 minutes and apologized, saying that he would never have sent it out, but he had been cleaning up and wasn't the one who made it.  He made everything right, took the steak off the bill and took care of desserts for all three of us.  He also came out after the steak was sent back out and inquired as to it's taste,  I have to say that I was incredibly impressed with the customer service from both David, our waiter and Dan(?) the head chef.  The steak was probably the best I've had in a long time and I will definitely go back and ask for David as a waiter, he was extremely knowledgeable about the menu, ingredients and the different handcrafted beers.  I have loved this place since my first visit and this visit impressed me even further.  I recommend this restaurant to all my friends and family, as there is so much on the menu that it's difficult for even the pickiest person to not find something they like.  The prices might seem a bit steep to some, but the quality of the service and food more than makes up for it.  Will definitely return!"
Arik M.,"West Chester, OH",11,1,,1.0,10/30/2013,Worst service that I've ever experienced.  The star is only there because yelp makes you put one. The food. Mediocre at best.
Jack R.,"Cincinnati, OH",49,251,,4.0,1/20/2013,This place was better than I thought.  When I think of places in a mall I normally think of food court.  It was way busier then I thought it would be.  The place was packed.  So we had about a 30 to 45 min wait.  But it was nice because you could go do some shopping.  The service was nice and fast once we got a table so no complaints with that.  I got the seasonal beer that was on tap.  It was a winter wheat that was very good.  I had been told that the deep dish pizza was really good here.  Me and a friend split one.  It was better then most chain pizza places.  This is a nice casual place for just a night out.
Zach Z.,"Oswego, IL",150,168,5,4.0,1/10/2013,"TONS of beer choices, a mix of micro brew and big name beers.  Pretty standard American restaurant menu.  It is a bit expensive but the food is actually pretty darn good.  I would describe the inside as fine dining meets sports bar.  It is a bit confusing.  I was there around 4 and the place was dead, the atmosphere may be totally different late at night.  A good overall experience for watching a game or taking the family out for a night."
Jonathan E.,"Cincinnati, OH",97,381,92,3.0,10/19/2010,"meh, it's alright. closest place to grab decent beer nearby.  nothing extraordinary.  nothing to call home about. +0 for a-ok beer. +1 for having happy hour -1 for no happy hour after 7pm +1 for a great waitress. +0 for decent food. +1 for good presentation. +0 for atmosphere.  kinda classy, but too bright, too many TVs. the late tuesday evening crowd has lots of gray hair.  a bit surprising. i will likely return, but only for convenience of location."
Joe K.,"Geneva, NY",2,50,8,5.0,3/13/2013,Awesome beer selection- both their brews and the guest brews. Menu is very good. Drew and Michele treated me as family. Definitely a place to bookmark !!  The special tap- Imperial Red is a 5 Star.
