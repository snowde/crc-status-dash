Ryan B.,"Oakland, CA",18,126,,3.0,11/18/2010,"With a decent beer selection, not counting the microbrews, and really yummy pizza, this place is good enough for the travel north from the city. The atmosphere isn't anything special, especially since the restaurant is attached to a mall, but I don't come here for the sights. Greek pizza and a Jeremiah Red or Hopstorm beer=yum."
Pete P.,"Middletown, OH",130,150,23,2.0,10/10/2012,The kitchen is a little too fast for the wait staff. Food arrives cold and unpalatable. One extra star for the draft beer selection. Far too pricy for the service snafu. No excuse.
Amy A.,"Eaton Rapids, MI",78,53,3,5.0,4/4/2012,"There isnt much that I have had here that I havent liked. I really love their salads and their soups. They have very tasty pizzas as well. I dont drink beer, but I find that people who enjoy beer like this place for the variety of beers they have. I am going to miss their wedge salad terribly! Their cobb is HUGE and the best I have ever eaten. Some times it can get a bit noisy though."
Paul S.,"Burlington, KY",0,6,,2.0,9/17/2013,"Great brewhouse. Forget the food. Too pricey! Caesar salad, Cobb salad, 2 water on Sunday lunch = $26 with 15% tip. I guess if you get buzzed on the brew you won't care that the food is a rip off."
Steve D.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,117,,4.0,6/21/2012,"Generally I have a very dim view of chains, but this one has earned the right to spawn. The name (whether sophomoric or just ill-advised), mall location and novella size of the menu all scored no points with me. But the beer options are terrific, not just the house brands (the kolsch was very impressive; the porter more like a cream stout which is not my thing) but also a great selection of other craft brews and imports on draft. And the menu doesn't just offer greasy bar chow or rehash tired, mediocre dishes as so many mid-priced chains do. It also offers a lot of variety, including a very large section of healthy fare, and everything we had was well executed. Worthy."
Jennifer R.,"OH, OH",2,29,,3.0,7/18/2009,"Went to Bj's last night for a birthday dinner. We had 13 in our party. This wasn't the server's fault--but it took eons for anything to come from the bar or kitchen. Our server was nice and kept apologizing for the delay. Normally big groups do take longer but we were there almost 2 1/2 hours not because we were lingering, but because that's how long it took for everything to come out. It seemed like all of the smaller parties around us had their food come out quicker, so it may be that the restaurant isn't quite used to big parties (we did have reservations, made two weeks prior, so they knew we were coming). This place is L-O-U-D. There was such a din that we couldn't talk to someone at the other end of the table without getting up and sitting next to them. The beer is pretty good, but they were out of the blonde. The berry cider was really, really good--it would be easy to drink way too much of that stuff. Our food was pretty good. I had the shrimp tacos, two people had pizzas, one person had ribs, another chicken and everyone else got sandwiches. Everyone seemed to like their entrees and the portions were huge. It's a little expensive for casual dining, but all in all it was an ok experience and we had fun. I'd like to give them another chance with a much smaller group because I think it would be different."
Kristin J.,"Aurora, IL",28,102,23,5.0,4/29/2012,"Our server Dave was absolutely incredible. We had the distinct misfortune of staying at the crappiest hotel in the area (The Atrium, in case you were wondering) during our first trip to Cininnati and Dave turned our view of the city right around with his positive attitude and willingness to tell us about all of the great things in his hometown. We also traded tips on beer and experienced some great local flavor. The food was delicious too, but Dave really made the experience. Being that I love great beer, great food and great service, I would definitely go back if I were in the area again."
Ray L.,"Cincinnati, OH",29,4,,1.0,12/1/2012,The food had no taste! The staff was overwhelmed and the food was horrible. Real waste of time and money.
Andrea C.,"Maineville, OH",22,19,,5.0,4/29/2014,"The hilariously named BJ's (in my immature opinion), is one of my favorite places in Cincinnati. Though I kind of hate Tri-County mall, the cozy atmosphere and stylish-without-being-pretentious decor make you forget that there's a Forever 21 in the near vicinity. The food is great, with the Santa Fe Spring Rolls, Fish Tacos, Southern Fried Chicken and Triple Chocolate Pizookie being particularly awesome. The service ranges from good to outstanding, with a couple of servers starting out super-attentive and sort of fizzling out at the end when it came to refills and the check. That being said, I am frequently the chick being a total pain in the ass with special diet and substitution requests and I chug diet Coke like I've been doing calisthenics in the Sahara, so it's not entirely their fault. Last Sunday our server Salvador was way above par, never letting our drinks dip below 3/4 full and handling the aforementioned ass-pain with friendliness, efficiency and accuracy.  Definitely one of the best servers the beau and I have ever had. BJ's also makes a great date night spot, especially if, like me, you're consistently low on funds because you don't budget well. For about 50 bucks you can get an appetizer, two huge entrees and a dessert to giggle over romantically. If you haven't been to BJ's, my child, go. Go now."
Heather S.,"Cincinnati, OH",2,7,1,4.0,7/4/2012,"Service is always great. I am not sure if they still do this but on 2 occassions we had to wait an hour to be seated and both times waiters brought out sliced pizza for everyone waiting until we were all seated. Their Ahi tuna appetizer  is small but worth the cost. The fish is raw and , s excellant quality. I always get pizza deep dish pizza as my meal. The pizookies are great however I would not recommend the red velvet one at all."
Brandon P.,"Lawrenceville, GA",7,7,,5.0,6/25/2011,"This place has a menu that reads like a novel, but you can just about flip any page and pick something that is great. Usually a place with a thousand things on the menu will only get a few things right and the rest are thrown in to fill space, but not here. Everything I have had here made it worth a return visit. I've also been to some California locations and they carry the greatness over to the Midwest very well."
Carmen G.,"Cincinnati, OH",35,12,2,4.0,10/10/2013,"I have found, after several visits, that service speed time varies.  It also seems that the larger the party, the slower the service.  I have never gotten bad food.  Their menu selection is rather large and their prices are 'okay'.  Personally, I think they're a little over-priced but they are on par with any other restaurant in their market.  I love the wedged fries, they were awesome.  Here's the problem, good luck on getting caloric content on ANY of their foods.  They do have an 'enLIGHTened' menu, that has about 6-8 menu items for less than 600 calories.  Other than that, yeah, you're not going to get it without calls to corporate office.  Even searching online was very difficult to find anything. After finding some things and piecing together some basic numbers, the caloric content of their BJ Bacon Burger ended up being around 1300 calories.  *ouch* Also, they do not list protein amounts on anything.  The wedge fries had about 400 calories.  I don't drink alcohol, so I can't talk about their beer selection.  I'm assuming its rather large (the pictures on the walls are beer) it IS called a Brewhouse."
Stephanie R.,"Cincinnati, OH",2,4,,4.0,9/17/2011,"This place is pretty good.  I've gotten quite a bit of take out from the Springdale location.  The pot roast is good,; both the sandwich and the meal.  My hubby liked the the creole pasta dish, and the Jambalaya dish.  Most of the sandwiches are pretty good.  Only sandwich that I didn't care for was the pulled barbque sandwich....the sauce was pretty bad.  The pizza is just ""OK""......but I wouldn't say its bad.   This location is only a few years old so its very nice inside.  I would recommend it to friends. Not sure what's up with the bad reviews because the food is on par with most national chains....its not suppose to be swanky.   If I was looking for 5 star dishes, I wouldn't go to a joint  labeled as a  ""Brewhouse"".  Come on people."
Katie O.,"Cincinnati, OH",187,24,1,2.0,9/11/2011,Didn't try the beer but unimpressive food wont bring me back
Johnny A.,"West Harrison, IN",2,114,1,1.0,8/5/2013,"Slow service, mediocre food, and it sure isn't cheap. So why bother?  ""Well they do brew their own beer."" I was told. OK great so I'm thinking they brew their own REALLY GOOD fresh beer like Fatheads. LOL NOPE it might be brewed in house (maybe) but it sure wasn't fresh or ""good"" as far as beers go in general. They have a decent selection of other better beer on tap but it honestly isn't anything to write home about. Not as varied as Cellar House and nowhere even near approaching the godly beer selection of Fatheads or World of Beer. So yeah... don't expect that kind of selection if you go. Essentially it's their mediocre beer OR the same beer you get in any bar around the neighborhood. Meh... that would be OK if the food made up for it but honestly TGI Fridays would give this place a run for it's money in terms of food quality. I'll be throwing down the veto card next time someone mentions this place though I doubt they will. No one in our group left raving about it. Hell no one was even drunk which is a sad state to leave a ""brewery"" in. They should just call it ""BJ's""."
Doug K.,"Byron, IL",1,138,1,4.0,6/26/2013,Great food and atmosphere!  Never had a bad meal here and the bar selection is incredible.  Service slow tonight which is not usually the case.
Geyl S.,"Cincinnati, OH",1,1,,4.0,8/3/2011,Excellent beer......I believe they brew their own beer...... Atmosphere is pretty good along with the food. Try the BBQ Chicken pizza.....superb. Definitely recommend this place....
Warren T.,"Cincinnati, OH",2,12,,3.0,6/5/2012,I really want to like this place but after a few visits; I am still on the fence.  The 'craft beers' are OK...the food is OK...the service is OK.  Everything is OK.  I guess I just expect a bit more from a 'boutique' restaurant like BJ's...
Dan M.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,21,,4.0,6/20/2010,"Great casual food. Good beers. Generally takes a while to get food. But, its worth it."
Joel J.,"San Mateo, CA",21,95,,2.0,4/30/2008,"The food is pretty oily and unhealthy, but if you're down for really extra tasty american fusion food, head on over to BJ's.  Their menu is HUGE...like cheesecake factory huge.  If you're a big sports fan, come watch multiple games on their huge screen.  they have 6 ginormous projection screens put together behind the bar.  one good experience (celebrated a work event with 20 people), one bad experience (appetizer took 35 minutes)"
