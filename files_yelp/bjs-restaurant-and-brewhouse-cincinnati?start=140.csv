Kolbos C.,"Boca Raton, FL",1,50,2,2.0,2/20/2009,"If you are a beer person, you are going to like this place. They have a huge selection of beer and i guess they brew their own beers too. I had a hefeweizen and it was really good although it had a banana taste to it. The menu is similar to Cheesecake factory where you have to go through pages to decide on a selection of sandwiches, pizzas, subs, ribs, steaks and more. I have eaten here twice and to be honest the food is nothing extra ordinary compared to the price they are charging. I wish they had a more Bahama Breeze sort of menu where the food would be more flavorful and tropical!!! What we had was just too bland!! We sat at the bar the last time we were there and i must say service was just not good. I guess my friend and me were talking about the Octomum and the bartender dint like the topic because she kind of gave us a few glares. She did not come back to ask us if we needed more beer and dint even ask us how the food was.  Bottomline if you get poor service and mediocre food, I dont think i would spend my money over there."

I have visited BJ's Brewhouse in the Tri-County mall twice since it's opening in February 2008.  To begin this review on a positive note, I was extremely pleased with the attentive and quick service I received during both visits and I was impressed with the variety of food offered on the menu (Burgers, sandwiches, and tacos to roast chicken and ribs).  The atmosphere at BJ's is a lot of fun too, I'd classify it as an upscale sports bar due to the number of plasma screen televisions and the sheer size of it's gorgeously lit bar.   Unfortunately for BJ's, the restaurant's atmosphere, service, and selection can't really make up for the fact that the food served there is pretty mediocre. On my first visit I ordered the roasted chicken dinner.  The chicken was exceptionally moist but dull; it lacked any kind of seasoning.  BJ's advertises their ""huge"" baked potatoes and on this front they don't exaggerate, the large potato that came next to my chicken easily trumped any starch I've ever been served.  I was happy enough with the Wedge Salad I ordered to preface my meal, though as far as Wedges go it was on the (very) small side.  My dining partner that evening ordered a pizza that he was not thrilled by (if you aren't a huge fan of piles of Parmesan, make sure to specify while ordering) but he thoroughly enjoyed his pint of BJ's Brewhouse Blonde.  The restaurant does brew its own beer and diners can sample all seven varieties in a ""beer flight.""   I visited BJ's a second time for lunch this past week.  The meal started out well, we ordered the sweet onion straw appetizer and we had almost polished off the whole (mammoth) plate before our entrees were placed in front of us.  I ordered the Fish Tacos for lunch and was disappointed to find what appeared to be (and tasted like) two frozen fish sticks covered in cabbage and wrapped in tortillas on my plate.  My dining partner ordered a combination lunch of Cesar salad and loaded baked potato but found she could hardly unearth potato from the obscene amount of cheddar baked over her dish.    Moral of the story:  Visit BJ's to watch the big game and fill up on appetizers and beers, not entrees!"
