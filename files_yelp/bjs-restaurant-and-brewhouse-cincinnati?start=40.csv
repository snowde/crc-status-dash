Tavie M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",26,43,108,4.0,8/2/2016,My Caesar salad  had zombie  lettuce in it.  But toleratable. I got the Mahi Mahi and shrimp.  It was amazing.  Service a tad bit on the slow side.
Scott H.,"Englewood, OH",35,3,,1.0,7/16/2016,Aweful aweful from the get go!  Horrible customer service getting seated. Ordered 2 handcrafted beers. Yuk. They tasted liked vinegar!  Sent them back!  Deep dish pizza was soggy with no flavor. Awful service!  Would have had a better meal at Speedway:(
Tabitha W.,"Cincinnati, OH",73,401,960,3.0,8/27/2013,"This meal started out pleasantly enough - we had Crispy Fried Artichokes and Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms from their Snacks & Small Bites Menu. For our entree we decided to go with a Signature Deep Dish Pizza. When the pizza arrived, we seriously asked the waitress if this was the deep dish - we thought maybe they'd given us hand-tossed by mistake?  When I hear 'deep dish', I think Chicago-style, a la Giordanos. I'm talkin' serious cheese, flavorful sauce, and a hefty pie that's just brimming with toppings. The cheese here was sparse, the overall pizza was flat and disappointing, and there was hardly any sauce.  I ended up asking for a cup of sauce on the side so it wasn't like I was just eating bread.   To be fair, this is how BJ's describes their Signature Deep Dish, ""A culinary masterpiece - pairing our flavorful, lightly sauced bakery crust pizza with BJ's signature blend of five cheeses and unique combinations of toppings and flavors to inspire all of your senses."" I don't know - the lightly-sauced part was accurate, but I still was expecting more. So, it's not meant to be Chicago-style, but it was just way too bread-y for my tastes and I needed more sauce, more cheese, more flavor.      Despite the overall disappointing pizza experience, I very much enjoyed the small bites. I thought the food was tastefully presented. I think I would return - I just wouldn't intend to get a deep dish again."
Paulina T.,"Columbus, OH",515,126,236,2.0,11/14/2015,"I reallllly want to love this place. But the wait was excruciatingly painful. Granted it was a big table but for it to take 40mins to get water or drinks is a little much. Another hour and 20 to get food, and another 40mins for the check!  I think their management needs to be better or they are severely under staff for their busy nights. Or server(s?) --because we didn't know who was taking orders drinks it was everywhere and they asked us to repeat our order like three times. The food was good, but not memorable. The only thing i would ever go back for is their Pazookis, which is like a warm cookie with ice cream on top. Such a yummy ooey gooey delectable dessert. Their beers were pretty good as well. Berry cider was definitely sweet, and most of their IPAs were given a thumbs up from my boyfriend. I don't think I'll ever come back to this location unless I have to."
Tom Z.,"West Chester Township, OH",16,37,1,3.0,7/30/2017,"First time going to this joint. All I expected was some good craft beer and I have to admit, their beer is Damn good. Had a sampler of their stout, porter, red and lager and all were very very good. My grandma has the mahi mahi and shrimp in a creole sauce. She loved it, and I thought it was tasty. I had the southern comfort crispy chicken sandwich with ham. I have to say I was disappointed. The chicken was small on an oversized bun which means most of your bites are a lot of bread. Is was advertised to have creamy Alfredo sauce and Dijon mayonnaise with bacon. Bacon was under cooked. Barely any Alfredo sauce. I thought it would be dripping off the sides similar to a good barbecue sauce sandwich. Nope. I think it was wiped on the bun like a condiment. Not impressed. Didn't eat it. Mgr took it off the bill. Other issues that kept me from giving more than a 3 star include my first menu has some nasty spaghetti sauce inside the 3rd-4th page. Gross! Had to ask for another menu and go wash my hands. It's a little noisy with the high warehouse like ceilings. I know that's trendy but the noise is an issue for me. I'll be back for another try."
Ben S.,"Lexington, KY",115,180,,4.0,8/8/2014,"I don't usually review chains, but this place is close to Glendale and they have an awesome club sandwich. The beer ain't bad either.  Also I'm 12 so naming it BJs makes me give it an extra star.  It's like Gordon Beirsch or Rock Bottom. I can't differentiate between the three, but its always good to go."
Amy K.,"Fairfield, OH",49,63,78,5.0,6/2/2015,I always enjoy myself here. It's a little on the noisy side. This is ok for us because we have kids. They always have a huge selection of dishes to chose from. Hard for me to decide everything looks so good. They also have a big selection of beer and cocktails. Several flat screen tvs. I got the cherry chipotle glazed salmon . Mmm very yummy.  For dessert we shared a BJ's Peanut Butter S'mores Pizookie. Let me just say holy crap this is good. I don't think I have ever had to wait for a table here during the week. On the weekend I don't think we have waited more than 30 minutes.
Nick K.,"Cincinnati, OH",20,10,3,3.0,7/24/2016,"When you walk through BJ's doors the first thing you see is the awesome bar area. Sadly, I'm not of age to drink so I couldn't take part, but it was still pretty to look at. The host when I came in ( 8:30 on a Friday) was super nice and told us our wait would be 15 minutes. It ended up only being 10. When we were escorted to our seat we sat there for about 8 minutes until we had a server approach us. I could tell our waitress was busy so it wasn't anything to complain about. The sad thing was that she was very inattentive. She checked in with us about 3 times. Once to get our drinks, once to get our order, and once to bring out our checks. When I go out I expect to have polite conversation, and have a connection with my waitress. We were there for an hour and fifteen minutes, I expected to be checked on 4 or 5 times.  Now for my thoughts of the food: We got the mozzarella sticks for the app, and it was average. The marinara sauce was bland but when you order mozzarella sticks you can't expect a 5 star experience. My entree was the Bacon Guacamole burger. First off the guac was pretty good. And I know good guac ( I work at a chipotle ;)). The burger wasn't anything exceptional. It tasted like a Jack Daniels burger but with a lot less flavor. Also? It wasn't hot. Like it was kinda luke-warm but not hot.  For dessert we got the Pazooki and it was by far the best thing we are all night. It's a cookie in a cake tin covered in Ice Cream. The cookie was the perfect consistency between baked and unbaked.  Overall my experience was average. Nothing too special. I could only see myself going back if I had my date paying for me."
Desiree K.,"Wilmington, OH",23,23,6,5.0,5/6/2016,This place is amazing. Definitely one of our family favorites. Food is always excellent and is my favorite place for desert!
Scott N.,"Hayward, CA",151,435,681,2.0,4/6/2012,"I was excited. My sister and brother-in-law were in from Houston. BJ's is a chain. My brother-in-law has eaten at BJ's in Houston, Daytona and Jacksonville, multiple times in each city. They recommending eating at BJ's and I had very high hopes. The beer was good. I like a restaurant that brews their own beer. I don't know that I can say anything better than it was good. It wasn't really memorable. The artichoke spinach dip tasted a bit like paste. It was seriously lacking in flavor. My sister's clam chowder was cold. Stone cold. The waitress said something like, ""I wondered about that"" as if she wasn't surprised it was cold. Hmm.. then why bring it to the table? My brother-in-law loves the original roast beef dip sandwich, so four of them were ordered around the table. Two were sent back because they were.... you guessed it, cold! Sandwiches and fries... cold. Really?  I was asked if my sandwich had caramelized onions on it. All I could say was if it did, I didn't taste them. I hadn't read the menu close enough to remember the sandwich was supposed to have onions. Oh well, by that time it was already gone while two other members of the group waited for theirs to be heated up. So maybe it was an off night... a VERY off night. My sister and brother-in-law have never had a bad experience at a BJ's in other cities Last night was a first. Finally, considering we had to send three items back to be reheated, no mention was made when the bill came. No compensation or acknowledgement. No coupons to come back and try again. No discounts. Sorry, when food needs to be sent back, something should be done to make amends.  The menu is HUGE, so I'd say it's worth another try, but it's not at the top of my list."
Opal B.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,2,,2.0,11/21/2015,"We were seated quickly even though the hostess seemed almost reluctant to do so. Loved the big U shaped booth. My husband and I could sit side by side, and actually have a conversation over all of the noise.  The server (I don't know her name because she didn't offer it, older short heavier set woman with long blonde hair) was friendly enough until I ordered an iced tea and my husband decided on a soda instead of a beer. We places our food order and never saw her again until after our meal had been served. Then it was very brief...I don't even think she stopped walking as she checked on us. My husband was never offered a refill even though his drink was empty before he finished his meal. She seemed a bit more personable with the tables around is. Not sure if something about us offended her, if it was because I suggested my husband have his burger cooked to medium instead of mid rare or because we didn't order alcohol. Whatever the case, we bother agreed that she was pretty terrible. The only thing that saved her bacon was the promptness of the food runners and the quality of the food.  The food was great! My husband had this burger with bbq brisket on it and he literally made nom nom noises while eating it! It looked fantastic, cooked to a perfect medium temperature. I ordered from their lighter menu. Chicken pita tacos with a seasonal grain salad. Excellent!  What a great combination of flavors! Plus it was very filling while still leaving room for dessert! Of course we ordered the pizookie trio. Salted caramel was our fave, but the peanut butter and triple chocolate were really good as well.  We will definitely return and hope for a better server. The food is too good!"
Steve W.,"Tampa, FL",3,4,,2.0,4/5/2016,Seared ahi tuna salad was delicious!  Service as sub par.  Out of town on business and bar tenders basically ignored me to talk to their regulars.  Disappointing to say the least.
Tina G.,"Cincinnati, OH",67,157,46,4.0,12/3/2014,"The freshest and perfect combinations of ingredients makes BJ's the go-to spot whenever the craving for pizza is at large!  I usually request garlic butter for the crust, which never seems to be a bother.   We're also racking up points to earn discounts and free meals as a Premier Rewards Club member, so why not choose BJ's when the urge calls for a meal on the fly.  A fresh, warm pizookie with ice cream on top satisfies the sweet tooth after any meal here.  Do I need to mention the great team-spirited atmosphere near the bar whenever a good game is broadcasting?   :)"
P S.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,26,,1.0,12/16/2014,"used them today for office xmas party.  Took 20 mins for all food to be brought out.  By then the dishes in the first bag were cold.  Then found note from one of their staff calling me an a-hole for parking in the take out spots...this little coward is lucky I didn't catch them in the act.. This place is over priced, staffed with incompetents and employs little weasels who don't have the sense or backbone to speak to their customers before doing something stupid like this.    they also left two items out of our order...after note wasn't going to bother going back up there.. Will likely send copy of it and receipt to their corporate office to see if they give a damn.."
Claude S.,"Lake Mary, FL",13,200,87,3.0,1/21/2015,"For a chain restaurant the food was pretty good, I had the Moroccan spiced Salmon served over couscous which had really good flavor and the piece of fish was quite large. We began with the Calamari appetizer, the flavor was delicate and it was not over battered for fried. If there was a negative for the evening it was the slow service, our waitress seemed overwhelmed with the amount of customers she had or the service she was getting from the kitchen. We'll be returning and hopefully the service will have improved."
Alyssa F.,"Cincinnati, OH",238,447,273,4.0,6/7/2013,"I was pleasantly surprised with this mall restaurant. I got a beer sampler that was really good, and we got a bunch of appetizers to share. Everything was freshly made and just surpassed my flavor expectations, while still keeping a price point and professionalism of a chain restaurant.  I took one star off because the service was slow all-around, and our food took a long time to come out."
Steve L.,"Alpharetta, GA",0,3,,2.0,10/1/2016,"Service great. Beer good. However...WORST DEEP DISH PIZZA PERIOD.  ""Pizza"" is nothing more than a fresh baked pan of bread with scant amounts of sauce, cheese, and toppings."
Melinda S.,"Cincinnati, OH",44,10,,4.0,3/31/2016,"They actually got rid of some of the items we used to order. Really miss the bruschetta. The house dressing is pretty good. The flatbreads are good. I love their spicy burger with fried jalapenos on top (they will take it off the menu since I like it). Get the potato skins they are especially good. It can get kinda pricey depending on if you want appetizers, full meals, dessert and drinks. The piezookies (not sure that's spelled right) are also very good and very shareable. The decor is beautiful inside. Plenty of tvs for watching any sports. A fun time for sure."
Brian H.,"Cincinnati, OH",52,146,86,4.0,5/2/2015,So while I've been to several different BJ Brewhouses around the U.S. like the others this one didn't disappoint. I love their selection of handcrafted beers even though I feel the prices are a tad steep. I tried the lasagna which was very good. It came with garlic bread which was seasoned perfect. The service and atmosphere was good. The menu selection is endless. If you can't find something to eat here there's something wrong with you.
Chris H.,"Cincinnati, OH",138,63,167,3.0,8/8/2014,"If you are at Tri-County mall shopping and food-court cuisine isn't cutting it, eat at BJ's.   They have one of those 45 page menus, so if you're like me, ask your server, or look at pictures or advice. Plenty of beers on tap, including home brews. Full bar as well.  I usually frequent this location for lunch given it's proximity to my office. If you are in a time crunch... Don't eat here. Their portions are huge, but their service is slow as molasses.  Stop by for happy hour, lunch with friends, or to grab an appetizer, but avoid it if your boss will notice a 1.5 hour lunch."
