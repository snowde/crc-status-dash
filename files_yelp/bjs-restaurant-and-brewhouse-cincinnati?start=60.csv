David C.,"Cincinnati, OH",42,302,21,4.0,3/1/2013,"We first visited a BJ's in San Rafael CA with some friends a few months back, and we were impressed with the vibrancy and the beers.  We chanced upon the one in Tri-County and came away equally impressed.  The interior design is drop-dead beautiful and is comfortable, far beyond what is the norm for a brewpub/brewhouse.   We had a couple beers, both their own house-brewed variety and we liked both of them(they can't brew onsite at the mall due to inherent safety issues; they truck it in fresh-brewed barrels from another location).  In addition to the 8 or so they brew themselves, they also carry 15-20 other microbrews. We chatted about the food with the bartender, who said she's been there since the day it opened (5 years) and that virtually all food from the kitchen is homemade and fantastic.  The menu is huge and we will go back soon to sample the food at length. I'll update this review only after we have a couple meals there with my wife and friends.  Based on what we saw on the menu and what the server had to say about the food, we're looking forward to going back soon."
Cindy W.,"Loveland, OH",0,5,,5.0,1/18/2016,"Always love BJs. First visit was Tucson.  Have been to them all over California.  So happy they are in Cincinnati! Great menu, great beer choices, festive, fun, perfect place to watch the big games..."
Stephen E.,"Maineville, OH",0,15,1,3.0,1/2/2016,"Tons of options. And while those options are nice when you have a big group that can't decide on what they want to eat, it limits how good you'll every be in any one dish."
David C.,"Covington, KY",251,150,89,4.0,8/27/2014,"I tend to hit BJ's for lunch meetings.  So, I'll say this right off the bat: BJ's is a safe bet for lunch meetings if you want to get some business done/talk. The servers are very aware of their customers and avoid interrupting much when you're in conversation. Their professionalism sticks out to me every time I visit.  They're very accommodating, and continue to fill beverages as they run out (yes, this is a mark of a good waiting staff! IMO). What to get: I always get the lunch soup/salad combo, unlimited.  Root beer is a treat when I get it; I think they make it in-house as well...it's at least in a keg from what I know. It was hard to give stars, as the last couple times I've visited, the chili I always get (which is my fav of the lunch soups) was a bit tepid/lukewarm.  No thanks.  Even on a hot day, I prefer to let my soup cool off.  Maybe I'm alone in that world. I'll be back, BJ's.  Thanks for being a professional place to grab lunch."
Anjelica N.,"Cincinnati, OH",229,271,27,3.0,8/1/2014,"Not the best location but bar none, this place has the best all-you-can-eat soup and salad combo for lunch. Everything else was pretty ordinary."
Jessie T.,"Cincinnati, OH",283,256,229,3.0,7/23/2014,"The food is ok, but the beer is good! I came in here randomly one night for dinner and I ordered the grilled scallops. They have an extensive menu with probably too much to choose from, but I did appreciate that they included a ""light"" menu for fewer calories. Since it is a brewhouse, I was more excited to try their beer, and it was pretty darn good. I had their hefeweisen, which had a nice banana note and it wasn't too heavy to have with dinner. Overall, I probably won't be coming here too often, but I would not be opposed to going again."
Rachel R.,"Oregon, OH",48,26,16,4.0,9/14/2014,"Pizza looked great, wish I had ordered it...got chicken fried steak, that the breading came off as you cut it...good house brewed pops, and delicious dessert, white chocolate chip macadamia nut fizookie Also, good portion  of salad for $3, and tomato mozzarella salad was great"
Scott M.,"Cincinnati, OH",81,490,18,4.0,8/24/2012,"I want to be in the room EVERY TIME a place comes up with a name.  BJ's?  Really?  You could have named it anything in the world and you went with BJ's?  This place is going up on the wall with the others under the ALL-NAME team.  Right next to ""Scene"". Chain or no, this place has a huge menu with some fabulous items.  Avocado Rolls, I'm there.  Southwest Chicken Salad, count me in.  Fabulous selection of house beers, very Rock Bottom-esque.   I enjoyed a steak from BJ's --insert pithy joke here--- just last night.  Top Sirloin, it was a little tough for my liking.  I think they could stand to add a fillet to the menu, why not, the menu is thirteen pages long.  No joke.  It's a novella. My date enjoyed Black Cherry Soda.  Where else can you get Black Cherry Soda. All told, this is a decent place, if you can stand the chain atmosphere."
Joel L.,"Cincinnati, OH",66,509,1058,4.0,3/9/2015,I'm a fan.  We had lunch on a Monday and it was 60% filled with customers.  The service was quick and attentive.  The menu was extensive and the dishes tasted good.  I like the interior of BJs because it works for lunch and dinner times.
Ralph H.,"Cincinnati, OH",1,47,,3.0,9/21/2015,"I wish I could give like two and a half or such. This place is overpriced for the level of service you get.  It's totally corporate and caters to the drinky sportsball crowd.  Our server completely acted like she wasn't paying attention.  Refills suddenly stopped halfway through the meal.  The chicken on the salad was undercooked, not blackened, watery.  Greens were OK.  Several of the other folks at my table had problems with incorrect checks.  The beer is sold by the pint, but the glass looks totally 12 oz instead of 16 oz. It ain't nuttin' to write your momma back home about.  Just another corporate mall-anchored sports oriented restaurant with the volume turned up too loud."
Bob M.,"Burlington, CO",0,94,19,4.0,11/3/2015,"Service good, appeared to be a little busy so my beer order took awhile to get. Kind of loud in the restaurant, I had to ask my wife to repeat a few things if she talked to softly. Our food was good, so overall good experience dinning at BJ's. Would certainly come back, enjoy their craft beers specially the blond ale. Thanks !"
Alex S.,"Chicago, IL",4842,2396,6837,3.0,7/29/2010,"There's a joke in this restaurant's name, but I'm not going to make it. That's beneath me, good sir! ... All I will say is that I really like BJ's.  I really like BJ's with all my heart. *smirk* Yes, this is an evil, soulless, everything's-the-same-everywhere chain restaurant, but there's something about this place enjoy. I can't help it! They're food is quality and cheap and delicious. They even have these single-serving things like quesadilla and shrimp for when you're not really hungry but still just want to mindlessly munch for like $3. Can't be beat. What I really come for, though, it's the beer. They're not called a brew house for nothing. They've got selection upon selection of drinks. And if you can't make up your mind, they'll bring you a sampler of things to taste - six little glasses filled with beer. It's fun and awesome. Ok, but now comes the not so good stuff - and it's everything you'd think it would be. This place is monstrous with TVs blaring throughout the place (nice when there's a game you want to see, not great when you want to just enjoy your meal). Thee are always people celebrating something or other, so it's loud. So very loud. And it always feels like the waiters are trying to rush you in and rush you out. In and out. Ugh. Plus, they're always trying to sell you on something else. NO I DON'T WANT A STUPID OREA CREAM FUDGE CAKE! GO AWAY! I'm giving this three stars, which is actually much higher than I'd normally give a bland chain restaurant. This is not my favorite stop. This isn't even my every time I'm in Springdale stop. However, it is my comfort, mindless, let's get a drink spot - and there's something to a spot like that."
James B.,"Cincinnati, OH",1,23,,4.0,12/7/2015,"Great food and atmosphere.  To be honest, I haven't found anything on the menu that isn't good.  Even the salads are tasty.  Large selection of microbrews, brewed on site.  Also good for kids because they brew there own root beer, orange, & black cherry soda.  Add this location to your must try list!"
Regis E.,"Weston, FL",0,63,40,4.0,6/4/2014,"I ordered a medium Rare and they brought me a medium well NY steak, they quickly fix it and brought me the best piece of stake I gotten in a while, the manager was all over it to make sure I was satisfied, this is an example of how a restaurant should operate."
Sean B.,"Cincinnati, OH",75,74,93,4.0,5/10/2014,I've been to BJ's on several occasions.  This time I decided to stop in on a Friday night after work with some friends.   We all ordered off the happy hour menu for the food.  I went with the chicken lettuce wraps and the chicken won tons.  Both were half orders and I enjoyed both dishes.  The lettuce wraps were fresh and a little spicy.  There were 4 won tons and were typical of what I expected to get when I ordered.   The beer selection is very good here. I went with a stout and an IPA.  My friends ordered a red ale and a blonde ale.  Both my beers were great and strong too.  The service was good for a busy Friday night.  I'll be back again for another round soon enough.
Megan K.,"Las Vegas, NV",573,328,86,3.0,12/4/2013,"I came to BJs the day after thanksgiving. Given the mall location, I assumed it would be overly packed. Thankfully, i was wrong! My party of four didn't have to wait for a table and we were promptly greeted by our server.  Ordering was painless and our drinks came quickly. The server was patient will an older woman who has a hard time hearing in our party. The food: Very good. I enjoyed my salad.  Wait time for food: Not very good. It took about 45 minutes for out entrees and the server forgot my soup. :(  Refills: My cup was always full :) Check: Affordable and the service didn't mind splitting the check 4 ways.  Overall, I would give this place another shot."
Chris H.,"Hamilton, OH",41,212,134,3.0,4/30/2014,"Decided to stop back here after we had a good experience a few months back. Previously we enjoyed  their pizza and a pasta dish. The pizza was really good,  even better the next day heated in the oven and the pasta my wife had was A OK.  This visit though we decided to try something different. My wife chose the flame broiled salmon and I chose the maui maui. I also added a tomato and mozzarella salad. The salad was quite good, no complaints there. The issue was with the fish. Both the salmon and maui maui were overcooked and dry. A real disappointment. The rice and vegetables which came with each for OK but forgettable.  Overall service was OK, neither good or bad. Acceptable. Overall though I'm not sure we will be back. Too many other choices that are priced similarly and have better food to offer."
Ray R.,"Canton, MI",0,4,,4.0,10/14/2015,"Food and beer were pretty good for a 'chain', even though I try to avoid them while traveling . Meal was made more enjoyable being served by Priscillia at the bar; very nice & efficient!"
Matthew C.,"Lebanon, OH",15,99,102,5.0,4/11/2015,"Very good food! I went there after church on Sunday with some friends and it was first visit to a BJ's. The waitress was really friendly, and let me just say I got a jalapeno burger that was almost to die for! I don't know if I will ever try anything else. Other than the amazing burger I noticed the restaurant was very clean and well taken care of, every staff person I was in contact with was very pleasant, the the atmosphere seemed very pleasant. I'll be back."
Beth F.,"Cincinnati, OH",288,474,157,5.0,9/23/2013,"B.J's is one of those places that you snicker every time you tell your friends where you're going.. until you all get there and enjoy their food.  I've been there several times and am always a bit overwhelmed by their giant menu. I want to try more stuff every time I go, but it seems I stick to my tried and true. I love their giant stuffed potatoes, their pizza, the amazing OMG cookies and ice cream.. and well, just everything.  I have never had a bad experience here, and the atmosphere is just, fun. I wish I had more things to say, but this place just speaks for itself. Good food, good times, go check it out!"
