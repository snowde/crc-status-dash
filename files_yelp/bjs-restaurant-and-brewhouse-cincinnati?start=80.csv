Stephen V.,"Clifton, Cincinnati, OH",1,4,38,5.0,6/21/2014,"This is definitely a place you want to be, wether it's to watch the game or to hang with friends! BJ's is nice"
Mike K.,"Burlington, KY",34,177,17,3.0,9/2/2013,"This is a nice chain by the movie theater. It has regular chain food that isn't going to rock your world. I got the ""black & bleu burger"" and was actually disappointed because they didn't put nearly enough bleu cheese on it. It was like a dallop of bleu cheese. When I get a bleu cheese burger, I want it smothered with bleu cheese. Anyway, you don't go here for the food, you go here for the beer! So I sampled all of BJ's own beer styles except the light beer. Because you gives a shit about the taste of light beer anyway, am I right? What I found is this. All of their styles are good but aren't as good as other breweries versions of the style. Except for 1 case. The ""BJ Brewhouse PM Porter"" was fantastic. I give that beer alone 5 stars. Its an exceptional porter. So, in conclusion, go there and its fine. Especially after a movie. But if you don't know what beer to get, I recommend a million times over, the PM Porter. Its great."
Kevin W.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,22,6,3.0,7/26/2015,"I'd give 3.5 stars if I could, but I just can't get to 4 stars.  They have a lot of menu options ranging from typical bar food to more interesting entrees.  My meal was fine, but a bit slow (though it did seem pretty busy when I was there).  I definitely enjoyed the beer options."
Jarvis G.,"Henderson, NV",213,5,2,5.0,4/19/2015,I frequently go to BJs and the food is always good. I had Cherry Chipotle Glazed Salmon. It is my favorite dish. We called ahead and waited just a few minutes before being seated! The skinny-Rita is always my go to drink under 130 calories!
Jim F.,"Blanchester, OH",6,27,,2.0,3/21/2016,"Me and my family were visiting the near empty tri-county mall and decided to eat here.  The chicken wrap I got was not as good as the one I get from McDonalds and McDonalds is a helava lot cheaper and the fries are better.  Me and my son had beer and that was delicious but the spaghetti my wife had was dry and not too tasty.  My Granddaughter had the 1/2 rack of ribs and that was ok but my 5 year old grandson had only fruit and happy face potatoes.  Now here is the issue.  Today, the grandson is puking his guts out.  All of us have the shits and our stomachs are all messed up to where I am afraid to fart.  So, there was something bad in that food and the food was no big deal for the enormous price we paid.  I could have gone to Texas roadhouse and gotten a steak and, at least, it would have tasted better and no one would have had stomach complications.  We are not going back to that ever again."
Holly C.,"Hamilton, OH",32,1,,5.0,7/10/2015,"Always an excellent experience! Service is always good, every item I've tried on the menu has been delicious, and the selections of beer or root beer are great. You will not be disappointed at BJ's. The atmosphere is a little loud but the food and drinks are worth it. You must try the Pazookie!!!!"
Jason B.,"Cincinnati, OH",30,45,2,4.0,1/27/2014,"This was probably my 4th time eating here and have never been disappointed. The service is good as well as the food. Be prepared to be a little overwhelmed by the menu, but that's not such a bad thing. The beer selection is good and the menu prices cover a broad pricing selection.  My only complaint is that it's part of a shopping mall in decline, however don't let that discourage you.  It's worth the stop."
Steve A.,"Cincinnati, OH",46,85,17,3.0,5/15/2013,"This could've gone 3 or 4 stars, but since I'm thinking 3.4 I had to round down.  The biggest pro for this place is the portion size.  The prices are decent, but each time I have been and tried different entrees, I've always had enough to take home for just about another full meal.  Especially the open face Piranha Pale Ale Chili Cheeseburger... tons of food.  Plus the menu itself has a fairly large selection to appease just about any appetite. The beer is pretty good as well.  I think the price of a pint can be on the higher side, so I was happy to see a happy hour special mentioned online.  However when we sat in the restaurant section, they informed us that the happy hour typically only applies when sitting in the bar area, but they would be willing to give us the discount this time.  Oh thank you so very much, I can't believe how gracious you are to give me the happy hour that is advertised for your restaurant, especially when I'm going to be giving you more money by ordering full meals rather than just drinking at the bar.  I've been to a few places that pull this stunt and it irritates me every time. Also, they recently introduced their new ""Premier Rewards"" program.  I was intrigued and signed up to get the points for that visit.  In yet another move to defy logic, BJ's Restaurant & BREWHOUSE only provides you with reward points on food purchases, NOT for beer (even if you order both).  For a restaurant that sets itself apart for brewing its own beer, you'd think they'd include that in their rewards program.  Not the end of the world, but again, irritating.   Overall, I'll be back, though it isn't top on my list.  But I do like the beer and food.  And should the ""restaurant"" refuse the happy hour price next time, I'll just walk the few paces over to a bar table."
Stephanie D.,"Fairfield, OH",0,13,,2.0,3/14/2015,If you visit stick to the pizza and beer selection.  This is their speciality and the other selections are average or awful.  The service is not great and they need to improve the cleanliness.  I will eat here if someone in my group insists but never suggest it in my own. It really could be a go to spot if the issues I noted were addressed. Great TVs for viewing games.
Becky S.,"Cincinnati, OH",96,145,32,5.0,12/1/2010,"Best Feature: LOVE the beer! And the food is fantastic! Worst Feature: A bit pricey I had no idea this was here until a few weeks ago, when my boyfriend suggested the restaurant. I got a confused look on my face and went, ""Where? What?"" ... but was soon enlightened to what B.J.'s was. Upon driving up, you can tell this is not the usual restaurant. It looks pretty big even from the outside. They brew their own beer and they are proud of it - as well they should be! I entered and couldn't believe my eyes. The interior is fantastically decorated and you feel like you're walking into an extravagant establishment. Luckily the prices are not extravagant to match the ambiance. We were seated at a booth where the waiter came up to take our drink order. Since I am always up for trying local beers, I decided to partake of their sampler. We ordered pumpkin beer (seasonal), porter, and two kinds of ale. They have great list of beers they have, and I was excited to try a few. The beers were AMAZING - it was the first time I'd ever had a pumpkin beverage, and the taste was smooth but flavorful. The other beers were amazing as well, although my favorites definitely were the pumpkin and the porter. We ordered an appetizer and a large pizza for our entree, and both were fantastic! The prices are a bit higher than usual, but they definitely give you food worth your penny. The nacho portion was insane and the pizza, a buffalo chicken-style deep dish entree, was amazing and filling. We had to box some and take it home! Our service was excellent as well. Nothing spectacular, to be honest, but it was exactly what I'd want out of any restaurant experience. Attentive, friendly, and made sure we were satisfied with our experience. This restaurant was a surprisingly fantastic find and hit all the major key elements that make up a great experience for me! Therefore I'm rating this one 5 stars and hope to be back soon!"
Jim W.,"Novi, MI",0,13,,4.0,4/12/2015,"We stopped on a Friday for happy hour and dinner before a planned engagement later that evening.  The past reviews about poor service gave me concern about getting out on time.  We sat at the bar and the service was excellent!  Both our server and the other staff behind the bar were great.  We tried the BJ's drafts and I really enjoyed the Jeremiah Red.  I liked the wide variety of food selections on the menu.  My jambalaya was very good and as were the Mediterranean tacos for my wife.  I had previously been to the Polaris, OH location with a similar positive experience.   Took one star off for this:  we asked for a taste of a draft beer which we got, but  we're told by our server it was against their policy.  Really.......a brewery themed establishment not offering taste samples?k"
Sheila G.,"Cincinnati, OH",32,41,,5.0,12/28/2013,"My second review of this place is even better.  A group of 3 came at a very busy time.  The wait was the same as the hostess said and we were given a handheld device to alert us for when we were to be seated.  The waiter was exceptional -answered all of our questions and continually checked in on us.  The food was great and cookie/ ice cream desert very yummy!  I will definitley recommend this place to all. Burgers are definitely a plus, but no sweet potato fries are available.  Flatbread pizza is great with combo salad for lunch."
Nate S.,"Cincinnati, OH",140,163,60,5.0,12/11/2012,"This place has some great food selection & great in-house brewed beer.  I've only been out there once or twice because it's so far away!!!! But it's worth it to check it out especially if you're up that way to see a movie. For appetizers, I highly recommend the avocado egg rolls.  They are so delicious - however, do not order it as an appetizer for dinner - you will get tired and overpowered by all the avocado, but it's great to order and share.  The other great appetizer they have is the Ahi Poke - that is also very tasty.  Entrees....well, to be honest, I don't remember my entrees all that much because the avocado egg rolls were so good!  But I did try a flatbread pizza one time, and was pretty pleased with it.  I think I may have had a burger too, and since I don't remember it being terrible, I'll say it was pretty good. Beer: They have 12 or so brewed-in-house beers and I've tried at least half of them, and enjoyed all of them - I think the best would probably be the Jeremiah Red."
Michael J.,"Trenton, OH",2,12,,4.0,3/28/2015,Another pleasant time last night. Beer is always top notch and food was great. Thanks Sam the bartender for great service
Marie F.,"Hamilton, OH",0,4,,5.0,2/22/2016,"We ate here last week and it was delicious! I had the portabella mushroom burger and fries - excellent. My husband had chicken fried steak - loved it! Our server was attentive, courteous, friendly and knowledgeable. We will definitely be back!"
Courtney L.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,3,,2.0,12/30/2015,"The food was not bad but the service by the manager and one hostess was terrible. We reserved ONE large table for my friends birthday two weeks in advance and only came here because they promised we would get one large table. We got here and were given tables broken up from one another. When we mentioned this to the manager he didn't even apologize and said that we would have to wait 30-40 minutes to have all of the tables together. What's the point of a reservation if it isn't going to be held. I'm not saying the food was bad, but the customer service could be improved and the organization of the company needs to be re-evaluated."
Natalie Y.,"Cincinnati, OH",10,99,59,5.0,6/25/2013,I've visited the location for the first time on Saturday evening.BJ's even impress my8 year old and that very hard to do.I'll server name was Jeff and he was very nice and attentive to the table.
Mr. And Mrs. H.,"Mount Juliet, TN",46,254,1149,1.0,11/24/2012,"Very disappointing.  Cold food!  How can a place with this much staff do that?  They must have everything just sitting in the back, pre-made in bins, getting cold.  Makes me wonder why it took so long for our food to be served?  I'm sure if you go and drink enough beer, you might not care what you put in your mouth. Once again, this is a case of location, location, location.  Other BJs around the U.S. aren't this bad."
Jamie A.,"Hamilton, OH",22,147,23,5.0,2/10/2013,"I first ate at a BJ's about 10 years ago out in California - it was always a go-to place for me whenever I was on the west coast.  I was really excited when they put a BJ's in the tri-county mall (it's basically the only redeeming quality about that mall these days).  They have a huge menu with just about anything you could want.  Their pizzas are delicious.  I've never had a burger here I didn't enjoy.  Their salads and giant baked potatoes are amazing.  Their beer selection is phenomenal.   I love their strawberry lemonade.  I went again recently with my fiance and my parents.  Our food was fantastic and our waitress was really awesome.   Great food, service, and atmosphere.   Oh, and if you want dessert - try a pizookie."
Matthew T.,"Akron, OH",0,11,,3.0,11/8/2014,I love the restaurant at all the other locations i have been. My sister goes to school down there so we have gone for food a couple times. The service at this one is slow as could be. The food has been cold. The have lost our call ahead seating. I might try it again cause again the chain i love.
