Nico O.,"Burr Ridge, IL",0,4,2,4.0,12/27/2017,"BJ's is the best if you're lazy and looking for junk food. They provide you so many different choices of foods to eat. This place is primarily known in my area for their big menu pizookie's and crispy fries! The menu consists of 25 Pages of food to choose from. I don't know how it's financially possible to have a 25-page menu with those entree's, appetizers and such, but it somehow worked for them. The food came out at least 10 minutes after it was made, which was utterly impressive. The pizookie was like a baked cookie in a pan with lots of ice cream stacked on top. I ate it so swiftly, it took about two minutes for me to finish. However the speed of service was slightly tedious as I was barely finished with my appetizer as soon as the entree came. And the metal taste that came from the pan for the cookie ruined the taste of the cookie by a little bit.  Overall, the speed of the service, and the food was really great. -- I just hope they would slow down before the distribute the food to customers."
Mudd M.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",0,9,15,3.0,12/13/2017,"We were a table of 6 on Monday evening, 12/11 at 7pm.  We were seated immediately and our server was Amanda S.  She greeted us quickly, got our drinks, and returned to take our order as expected.  We had separate checks and it wasn't a problem at all.  Our food arrived in an acceptable amount of time and it had the quality you'd expect from BJ's.  It's always good. Our food was delivered by 3 food runners that, guess what, auctioned off our food!!!  Which of course created some confusion because 2 people weren't exactly sure what they ordered.  So the runners tried harder to auction off the food.  Seriously?  I'm baffled a restaurant of this caliber still auctions off food.  Is this what BJ's expects?  It's disheartening.  We completed our meal, Amanda refilled our drinks as expected, but she left our dirty plates sitting in front of us until she picked up our checks.  She checked on us 3 times after we finished and she left empty handed each time.  When she dropped off our 6 separate checks, of which she didn't auction off and knew exactly where they went, she again left empty handed.  We still had 6 dirty plates we had now pushed towards the center of the table.  When she returned to pick up the checks she took 3 plates with her.  Finally.  But we were done so it was for naught. I suggest you work on not auctioning food and pre-bussing tables.  Had she done this I'd give 4.5 stars.  I'll be back but I'll either sit at the bar or be vocal to the server and request they take the dirty dishes.  I'll probably be upset with more food auctioning so I'll meet the manager that night as well."
Don K.,"Citrus Park, Tampa Bay, FL",0,160,128,4.0,11/19/2017,"This was the third time here without a review.  Stopped in tired and hungry on a Friday evening and place was packed with mostly teenagers and some younger couples.  Plenty of staff though and they were hustling which was nice to see.  It is a noisy place with a casual feel, but a bit too chainy. Tried the Apothic Red special glass of wine which was a surprising treat albeit I found it a Publix the next day for $2 less for the bottle versus just a glass. Enjoyed the double pork chop with rice and tomato and moz salad.   Wife's shrimp pasta came with only 4 shrimp, but the manager was summoned who quickly brought 8 more shrimp.  Very flavorful otherwise.   It was an enjoyable experience but a bit too hectic."
D.j. L.,"Orlando, FL",193,7,,1.0,1/8/2018,"***Writing about a past experience*** Terrible experience at BJs and this wasn't the first time. Orders came out completely wrong, the manager tried to fix things but actually made it worse. We ordered pizookies after and those got messed up as well. Overall the service was so terrible I didn't even get brought a bill! My friends have had similar experiences at other BJs in other cities as well, seems to be just an overall bad company. Overall time in the restaurant was 2.5 close to 3 hours... should have been much shorter. Save your time don't come here, it's over priced anyway."
Bre F.,"Tampa, FL",4,62,93,5.0,12/4/2017,Been here various times over the years and it's always great service and good food. Their menu is huge... basically a book that you have to sift through but there is something for everyone. The soups are amazing and the flat bread is my absolute favorite. Pastas are always super tasty and the appetizers are very filling. If you still have room for dessert definitely get a pizooki (it's like a fresh baked cookie topped with ice cream) and they even have mini pizookis in case you're too full from your meal but still have a sweet tooth!
Rob W.,"Tampa, FL",25,12,8,2.0,12/6/2017,"The pic on the menu of the tuna salad shows a 5-6 oz serving, what a huge difference, mine was literally 2oz! Flavor was good. The ranch dressing my wife got was the worst from any restaurant ever"
Ebony W.,"Tampa, FL",54,9,2,3.0,12/10/2017,Me and my family enjoyed bjs food had the fried artichokes the lemon aioli was disgusting so I got ranch instead we all the bbq brisket cheeseburger  mine had extra toppings of course fried jalapeños crispy onion strings soo good...
Vivian N.,"Tampa, FL",75,136,1373,3.0,9/8/2017,So far I've been here twice. The first time was with friends for drinks & appetizers. The second time was last night with family for dinner. Dessert & drinks are delicious but I'm not impressed with dinner. Overall everything was just ok so 3 stars would be proper. I really really like the Chicken Parmesan dinner! Otherwise the kids meal & other dinner is just ok. Staff are friendly and bathroom is always CLEAN.
Alyssa M.,"Bridgeton, NJ",63,145,122,5.0,2/21/2017,Got to check out BJs Brewhouse the other day and I wish I would have known more about this place sooner. It was delicious. The menu is huge and so many options! I started off we the honey Brussels sprouts as an appetizer. They were absolutely delicious. It was just enough to hold me us over until our main course. They have speciality drinks-cream soda! That was ok so good and free refills which is always a plus because that can add up!  Our meal was amazing. The salmon was cooked perfect crisp but not over cooked. The chicken thyme was great. The food was healthy and just enough where you feel full but not stuffed where you fill sick.  Because it was our first time there we could download the BJs app! We got a free dessert for doing this! A pookalooza (forget what it's called lol) but it was an amazing dessert and it was free. We had the salted caramel with ice cream.  I was able to pay our bill through the app on mobile pay. This was awesome as we didn't have to wait for the waitress.  The wait staff was great. I will definitely be back as there was a ton of things on the menu I wanted to try.  Check out my photos.
Andrew B.,"Tampa, FL",38,2,,5.0,12/28/2017,Decided to stop in and grab a bite to eat with the wife after doing some Christmas shopping.  The waitress was slow to come to our table so I flagged someone down to take our order. The manager(David) quickly came by and took our orders and apologized for the wait.  He went out his way to make sure our order was brought out promptly.  The food was brought out almost immediately and was very good as well. David later came by to ask how everything was and advised us that he was taking care of the check.  He even offered some dessert at his expense.  All and all this place was very good and the friendliness and customer service was above any place I've ever dined at.  I will definitely be returning in the future.
Ria K.,"Tampa, FL",0,3,7,5.0,11/25/2017,"This is one our favorite places to eat. Great food! Our last visit we did experience a wrong order, which had to be remade. But the manager came by our table afterwards & offered all 3 of us free s'more pizookies! Best dessert ever!"
Cassandra S.,"Tampa, FL",139,486,15,4.0,10/13/2017,"This BJs has a great happy hour.  $2 domestics, $3 house wine and half price apps.  The service is great and the atmosphere is upbeat.  Love coming here after work w my colleagues."
Julie F.,"Pompano Beach, FL",1600,475,1683,3.0,11/22/2016,"This is 3 to 4 stars. Depending on what you ordered. This place was packed on a Tuesday night. And freezing inside. It was so noisy it was hard to hear (we were a party of 6 people at a long table.) They have call ahead seating which you may want to take advantage of if you are a larger group... The menu is like a bible -- barely got through half of it. A little daunting... The kids had several choices of meals. Seemed to like their pizza and spaghetti. One couple shared their special dinner for two for $25. Each had a soup (said the broccoli cheese was outstanding and the chili very good); then shared a pizza; and the pizzoli (pictured dessert). The pizza was a flat bread which they adjusted toppings to taste. The s'mores (sorry :0 spell check keep changing that to snores...) was warm toasted real melted marshmallows on top of peanut butter and chocolate. It was gooey and rich and sweet -- a real sugar rush -- that definitely should be shared. It would overwhelm one person.  I had a tomato soup that was quite good -- a rich bisque that had the taste and texture of real tomatoes. It was served very hot as asked. The first part of my ""soup and salad"" was a wedge salad. A nice chunk of iceberg covered with bacon bits on top of blue cheese dressing. The standard wedge not outstanding but quite satisfying. No surprises here but would order it again. Hey, what can I say I like iceberg... So overall it's a good place to go when you're not sure what you want to eat -- potstickers to sliders to pizza to... and good for a group cause everyone can get something different. Prices aren't bad, either. Just be prepared for noise... Service btw was wonderful. Our gal really hustled. Getting extra drinks and being patient..."
Tammy S.,"Tampa, FL",2,27,143,4.0,7/1/2017,"We stopped in for a veggie pizza and it was surprisingly very good. Crispy on the edges and chewy in the middle but not undercooked and ""doughy"" and not burnt. Perfect.  Less than a 10 min wait on a Friday night at 9 pm. Lots of TVs."
waseem m.,"Orlando, FL",0,43,,3.0,10/20/2017,"Dine here if you are ok with drinking Booze and watching American football on 15 large screens simultaneously , Awesome ! But some of us want to watch the premier league and perhaps AGT . The food was okay I guess and price wise not going to break the bank . Very busy and noisy with moms ,kids etc at lunch times"
April F.,"Tampa, FL",56,113,121,4.0,11/11/2017,"I ate here on Veterans Day for lunch.  My husband is a Veteran. Veterans eat free.  My husband eats breakfast, lunch and dinner for free. I ate soup. Wasn't hungry after breakfast.  It was good. My husband had an Asian salad. He enjoyed it.  We had a nice time talking to other Veterans.  My husband lingered for three hours.  Talking to Veterans.  My husband called the manager over to thank him he talked to us. Then gave us free movie tickets.  The manager was very kind.  He told us a story of a woman whose husband is deployed( and she's alone) and he treated her to dinner."
Abbi L.,"Tampa, FL",0,7,,1.0,10/27/2017,"Ordered takeout,  Got a chicken Caesar salad got just a bowl of lettuce and cheese. Filled half the cup with dressing. Not worth 13$ at all never ordering here again."
Denise M.,"Charleston, SC",7,6,1,5.0,5/17/2017,"We come once a month for a work-group ""meeting. "". Jessica F is our favorite! She is an amazing server! Half-price appetizers are such a deal. Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale is my favorite. Eat in the bar area and ask for Jessica!"
Sheila H.,"Palm Harbor, FL",92,17,6,1.0,3/20/2017,Ordered the salmon pita.  Found two bones (over an inch long) in my salmon. Also asked for no slaw. And that was the only thing it had on it. They didn't have the greek yogurt sauce. It only had two pecans on it. Will not be back.
Steven C.,"Brandon, FL",0,3,,3.0,7/8/2017,"My wife loves this brewhouse and I am a fan of brewhouses so we decided to stop in after a long afternoon of shopping.  I went in with high expectations because of previous experiences at other BJs in the southern states.   So,  our wait to be seated was longer than what was told to us. When we got seated I was looking forward to the calamari but when it came out it was cold.  Then it was about 40 minutes for us to receive our entrees.  The server apologized and so did the manager but it wasn't their fault.  You would think that for all of the time spent preparing the food that it would be exception but my burger was below average.  My wife liked her salad which is why the rating is as high as it is.  I can honestly say that quality of the food casted a dark shadow on the great service."
Jennifer G.,"Tampa, FL",0,41,7,5.0,7/3/2017,"My husband and I came here for dinner last night. We ordered our entrees and then we waited. We saw tables coming after us and getting their food before us. We took note of it, but we didn't complain. Our attentive waitress told us several times our food was on the way but we continued to wait. Finally a manager came to our table and told us there was a problem in the kitchen. She accepted the fault and then told us our meal was on them for the long wait we experienced. I felt like that was very classy of them to do. They definitely did not have to, but they recognized the problem and made it right. I got the pepperoni pizza flatbread, while my husband got the Parmesan crusted chicken. Both were delicious. I also recommend the peanut butter s'mores pizooki for dessert. You won't be disappointed.  We will definitely be back!"
Richard N.,"Tampa, FL",0,11,,1.0,11/19/2017,If you're looking to be ignored this is the place for you.  We waited over 30 minutes for a for three even though there were 5-6 empty tables and booths.   The staff seemed more concerned with their chitchat than taking care of their customers.   Avoid at all costs.
Ren C.,"Tampa, FL",170,245,152,3.0,9/12/2015,"i'm a fan of this chain restaurant. The reason why is that of the Pizookie. They were amazing.  But anyways I wanted to say that when i visited this placed again (coz i've haven't been back to this placed for almost a year.) I was kinda disappointed. I came here with friends for bday dinner but with all the great experience that I had at this place before they just went down. At first we decided to wait for one of our friend to arrive so we did not order yet. But when we figured that he is running late I decided to try there peach Margarita. And so the server checked my ID and did not even mention that it was my bday. no greeting or anything. at that point i got disappointed. if you are really checking DOB you should have noticed that the individual DOB is that day.  Then we got hungry and our friend haven't arrived yet and so we ordered appetizers. The appetizers were great no doubt. so we told our server that we are doing the 2 for 25 dollars (comes with salad or soup, pizza and pizookie). I ordered the clam chowder soup, which is a lil bit salty, then we decided to order the Deep dish spicy hawaiian pizza, my friend notice that the pizza did not with chicken and so they have to make another one with the correct order and we ended up having 2 deep dish pizza, and then the pizookie (as always there were to die for).  while we were eating my friend notice a lil friend on the floor (roach) and he took a picture of it. he tried to say something to the server but we can't get his attention. i have the photo of the lil friend if you want to see it. haha.  all in all i was disappointed at the service. i was expecting better service especially coz it's my special day.  3 star because of the pizookie that i always love. message me if you have some question."
Sarah W.,"Lutz, FL",146,44,21,1.0,12/4/2016,"We have been here numerous times and loved it. Today we had the worst meal I have ever been served. Sirloin 1st try was black burned out side and raw inside, we wanted mediuim. Fries were fine. Sent back. 2nd attempt steak was better, but not rested. The fries were from the bottom of the basket with fish batter, brown burnt fries. Yes we complained and yes they too it off the bill but not sure we will come.back."
Todd W.,"Tampa, FL",1405,702,282,2.0,8/7/2015,"Just like I said in my previous post from last September, I made my once/twice a year visit to this BJ's at the suggestion of the same great friends who like to meet there. While the service here remains extremely good (We all love Annie behind the bar), the food that I took home was a major disappointment. My ravioli was just sloppy and did not include the garlic bread that is clearly listed with this item on the menu. Also, the Santa Fe salad was also disappointing and did not come with the dressing on the side which is almost always the case when I order salads for take-out virtually anywhere else. Considering both entrees run near $15 a piece, the kitchen could at least make them worthwhile and not create that ""Oh, no"" moment when opening the bags at home and preparing for what was supposed to be a nice dinner. In my opinion, BJ's continues to waste great employees like Annie and others as well as a nice TV wall with their refusal to air audio of sporting events in the bar area. That's why I'm only in here once/twice a year and usually go to Show Me's or Smokey Bones when drinking or dining in this area."
Lucy L.,"Odessa, FL",0,7,10,2.0,7/30/2017,"I used to love dining at BJs, but how the times have changed. They need to rehire a new kitchen staff that will follow the directions on the order. I ordered to go, and paid for extra avocado on my salad, which didn't come with but two pieces of avocado. I also received avocado egg rolls, that were brown (the avocado). They were also not crispy at all. If I'm going to pay over $25 for lunch, I expect the avocado to be ripe and actually on the entree. Never going back."
Tammy L.,"Lutz, FL",0,13,2,5.0,8/13/2016,"Nice place, very family friendly.  Atmosphere is casual, the have several beers on tap. A pretty big bar area too. Plenty of seating for large parties and they have a patio up front that's inside the mall.  The menu is huge, really offering something for everyone. The also have a delicious gluten free pizza which is hard to find. The mozzarella sticks are amazing and they have great salads too! This restaurant has been in the mall for several years and always consistent. Clean and staff is friendly. They also have a to-go counter, do you could run into the mall order from to-go, shop a little bit and then head home.  I'll definitely be back!"
Charles U.,"Tampa, FL",5,11,,5.0,7/28/2017,"Jessica at bj's in Tampa is excellent she is the best waitress we have had in years. We always sit at her tables.We went to bj's yesterday and sat at the bar area where are favorite waitress Jessica works. As always she was friendly and she provide outstanding service. A great asset to BJ's.   I would love like to thank the manager David, Anna and Markus and his helper.we had a party of18 people. They had our table set up prior to our arrival. They took our order the food was great. We enjoyed the golf group dinner night thank to these great people. I would recommend BJ'S for your dinning pleasure. Again thanks. 7/28/17.  Had another great experience eating at BJ'S today. Jessica was outstanding as usual and David the manager is outstanding, he is very good talking to customer sets a friendly atmosphere."
Dolores C.,"Land O Lakes, FL",454,58,,1.0,6/14/2017,Went here a few times with friends and none of us thought the food was great. A BJ's just opened by me and I have no desire to try that one out.
Lyl P.,"Tampa, FL",0,14,1,5.0,7/3/2017,"What a wonderful unplanned happy hour. 1/2 off appetizers Mon through Th! My husband and I tried the California Flatbread and the very crispy buffalo wings. Both were a 10. And the Bj IPA beer (first one on the list) was delicious and $1 off because of the happy hour. And our server, Amanda, did such a great job at recommending and serving food and drinks at the right time, not pushy, we loved her. We recommend."
Joey D.,"Tampa, FL",150,336,29,3.0,3/8/2016,"I've been to BJ's for dinner probably a half dozen times and never have had anything I didn't like. The food is good, the portions are huge and the prices are pretty good.  I decided to go there for lunch the other day and ordered off of their lunch menu. I was between the ham and cheese sandwich and the chicken bacon ranch piadina. I ordered the chicken bacon ranch piadina with fries and when it finally came out about 20 minutes later (a little long for lunch) I was shocked on the portion. Not in a good way. It looked liked something that taco bell would serve. Six bites and the entire piadina was gone. I know a piadina isn't the biggest item out there but for $9.99 I wasn't impressed. It doesn't take much to fill me up but I could of eaten at least 1 more of the piadina to get full. It tasted good but it went by really quick.  Our server was very nice and its always a good atmosphere."
Stephen J.,"Ridgeland, MS",0,25,15,1.0,4/3/2017,"Had the Great White pizza, the crust was good, but overall did not enjoy it.  We started with the spinach artichoke dip, also disappointing.  The beer was the only redeemable quality, besides our wonderful server Cassandra.  My girlfriend's margarita tasted like a glass of mixer."
Daniel P.,"Carrollwood, Tampa Bay, FL",261,64,189,3.0,1/10/2016,"Bj's is just another chain restaurant where nothing is horrible but not amazing either. The food was okay but I found the wait to be a bit much. Their specialty drinks definitely didn't make me say wow I'd like another. The menu is pretty nice with a wide selection of food ranging from pizza,burgers,wings,and seafood. I'd say this place is great for groups of any kind and kids as well.  There's tv's on every wall so no matter where you sit you can still watch the game. The bar I found to be really nice with plenty of room.  I'd say for sure if your interested give these guys a chance. I couldn't really find anything wrong with bj's like I said just not amazing. I'll return in the future because I feel if I'm in the mall their one of the better places to eat."
Carol C.,"Orlando, FL",81,201,368,4.0,1/3/2015,"LOVE LOVE LOVE the HH Specials!!! We sat out in the indoor patio area w/our kids and enjoyed some people watching. Area was big enough to accommodate our double stroller. Food - Got the calamari - delicious. Look over cooked but was good. Better overcooked than under, right? Also got potato skins which were crispy and full of filling. Guinness was good - a bit pricey but hey at the mall. I am IN!"
Meredith B.,"Fort Worth, TX",2,33,129,2.0,8/6/2016,"Really disappointed in this location. We used to go all the time at our Texas location,  but we're so unimpressed at Citrus Park,  we won't be back.  The calamari we ordered was soggy,  fish and chips were way over cooked and I had the chicken pita Tacos with a few small crumbs of feta I had to ask for a side of it. Plus,  the pitas are usually slightly warm and this time,  cold and bread was hard. So sad,  because we used to love this restaurant!"
Brian M.,"Tampa, FL",1609,504,7664,2.0,12/1/2015,"At the suggestion of a coworker, we visited BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse located at Citrus Park Mall off Gunn Highway and the Veterans Expressway, not too far from our office for lunch. I got the Parmesan Crusted Chicken topped with lemon Chardonnay butter sauce, sun-dried tomatoes, fresh basil, Parmesan cheese, with white cheddar mashed potatoes, and steamed broccoli. Unfortunately, it was really missing flavoring and left me craving for something more. My coworker got the New Orleans Jambalaya with blackened chicken breast, shrimp, chicken andouille sausage, bell peppers, white onions, tomatoes, in a spicy sauce, served over rice pilaf and he was a little dissapointed that it was too dry. My other coworker got the Garlic Chicken Pesto Flatbread Pizza with grilled chicken breast, basil pesto, fire-roasted red bell peppers, artichoke hearts, tomatoes, parmesan, and goat cheese. He really liked it and ate the whole thing. You can't screw pizza up ever lol. The decor is pretty average and unmemorable. Cons: Over the phone, BJ's Brewhouse told us they had plenty of lunch specials but when we got there their lunch menu had only 4 items. I didn't want pizza or salad so were forced to order off the dinner menu for $15-$18 per plate which is higher than average for lunch. Service was terribly slow for a place advertising come here for work lunch. I had to ask the waiter 3 times to put my order in and we had to wait over 15 minutes to get our checks and then another 5 minutes to pass the pen around. Considering we had over 15 people and over 3 tables of people, you think we would've got more than 1 server. People kept asking where the heck did the server go?  One of my coworker's $12 burgers came without tomatoes and onions which is a basic burger topic every burger should have. He ended up eating the whole burger before the server showed up again so he didn't bother asking. Due to the slow service, it ended up being a longer than expected lunch."
Kathy B.,"Dade City, FL",5,13,,3.0,5/22/2017,Food  was  ok  service  slow  it  was not  to  busy.  Not to sure if we  will go  back.
Lisa K.,"Tampa, FL",33,61,44,2.0,8/9/2016,"We've been here a few times since it's in the neighborhood and I wanted to give them a couple of chances. Each time we've been, the food has not been up to par for the type of restaurant this is. The service has always been slow and not very friendly. The last trip was the clincher though, when the booth they sat us in was absolutely filthy. Sorry to say, we won't be returning!"
Scott W.,"Town N Country, Tampa Bay, FL",43,22,53,5.0,10/9/2016,Brace yourself.  Pumpkin everything season is here and that goes for BJ's Brewhouse as well.  I look forward to their own brewed pumpkin ale every year and it's here now in October.   Chicken lettuce wraps for an appetizer never disappoint and come with a pair of dipping sauces.   Also got the monkey bread pizookie.  Sweet and delish.  Mobile pay on the BJs app and / or at your table is very convenient too.
Mikey C.,"Tampa, FL",310,45,175,5.0,6/25/2016,"I've been here many times before. Mainly for pizookies (so heavenly). But tonight was different, my two friends and I came in tonight for a late bite. 1030pm on a kinda busy Friday night. Our server was phenomenal, and that doesn't seem like a fitting word. Shawn took great care of us. He was very attentive, fun to talk to and had a ton in common with us. We will definitely come back to see him. The calamari app was delicious. My ribeye (medium rare) was cooked to perfection as well as the asparagus. The tomato and mozzarella was probably the best I've had in my life. Fallen in complete love with the food and hospitality. Haven't had service this good... Ever. 5/5 stars every day of the week as long as Shawn is on the clock. :)"
