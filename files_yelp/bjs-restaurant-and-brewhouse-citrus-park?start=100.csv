Steve E.,"Tampa, FL",201,1582,5019,4.0,10/1/2012,"My business partner and I had lunch here today, and it was a nice place to sit and chat while watching all of the football highlights from the weekend. BJ's is located inside Citrus Park Mall, right near the front entrance and opposite Red Robin (Yummmm!). We had some client reports to finish, otherwise we would have likely enjoyed a sampler of their craft beer. Instead I went with an iced tea, but made a note to come back next time for a beer. The menu is loaded with the standard mall pub grub, but I did see some nice lower calorie selections, and a lot of soup & salad options. There's the usual flatbreads, pizzas, salads, soups, appetizers, sammies, burgers, wraps, and so on. I had the lunch-portion teriyaki shrimp stir fry over rice and it was quite good, and only 245 calories. The stir fry was made with grilled shrimp, sautéed with onions, red peppers, cabbage, green onions and baby carrots tossed with teriyaki sauce and served over sticky white rice topped with sesame seeds. Lots of interesting options for another visit."
Mark T.,"Tampa, FL",0,2,2,5.0,3/21/2015,"Let me start off by saying I signed up to yelp just to write this review and looking forward to leaving more in the future. I went after a Yankees spring training game around 10pm on a Thursday night, not many choices at this time so my girlfriend suggested bjs (mind out of the gutter please lol) I got one of the new tavern pizzas,  and asked for the beer on the advertisement card. Luckily my waiter knew his beers and warned me about the strong flavor that one had and asked if I was into that kind of beer. I had no idea and just wanted to try something new. He brought a few samples and let me say, that probably saved the meal. Wish I knew his name to post here, but awesome guy!  Both pizzas were great, drinks were great and the chocolate chip cookie with ice cream was amazing and I'm not even a desert person. Highly recommended!"
Nichole M.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",4,35,6,1.0,8/23/2015,"Terrible service. Anne the manager is as rude as they come! We ordered a steak and it came out 45 minutes late. Over cooked and Disgusting! Don't waste your money or your time, this place has HORRIBLE customer service and BAD MANAGEMENT. Do yourself a favor and GO ELSEWHERE for  your next meal!!!"
Jonathan S.,"Tampa, FL",177,157,123,5.0,10/2/2014,Yum yum pizookies!!! They've got some inventive drinks and their house made beers on drafts are good and not too pricey. Their bar specials are very good.
Jaime R.,"Tampa, FL",0,11,1,3.0,12/11/2014,"Generally a solid choice for a beer and quick bite when shopping. Service however can be hit or miss.  Sitting at the bar, is the best chance of getting great service, seems to be less turnover of bartenders than waitstaff. Burgers are always good and the medium is always still juicy."
Andi H.,"Lutz, FL",0,28,,2.0,7/16/2016,Roasted Brussels sprout salad. Too lazy to take The stems off the kale and leaves. Couldn't eat it lazy cooks.
Erica G.,"Tampa, FL",152,168,72,5.0,9/28/2015,"BJ's is a great go-to restaurant when you can't decide on what to eat lol. The menu is huge and has a nice variety of entrees to choose from. It's also conveniently located inside the mall, so it's great to catch a quick bite at when the food court isn't an option."
Eric B.,"Fayetteville, NC",2,12,,4.0,8/9/2015,Food was excellent. I ordered the portobello Swiss burger and it was amazing. One of the best burgers I've ever had. Drinks were also very good. One of the best Long Islands I've had as well. Only bad part was it took nearly 10 minutes after being seated for or server to come over and the hostess never brought us appetizer plates or silverware. Overall was a great dining experience. I highly recommend the burger and long islands.
Jorge G.,"Tampa, FL",0,5,,4.0,1/30/2016,"My server was Mike Kelly and he was excellent. He has great people skills, connected with my 10 & 15 yr old daughters. Had the root beer rib appetizers which were OK. They give you 5/order and they were on the anemic side On the flip side, had the Bison Burger which was very tasty and filling, only 700 cal-bonus We also tried several of their chicken wings which were good and my daughter's spaghetti and meatballs was a good portion and the meatballs had a nice flavor. Overall experience was excellent thanks to having a great server like Mike!"
Rob B.,"Odessa, FL",51,69,213,3.0,6/13/2014,Was not impressed with my food at all. We went for some appetizers and I ordered the avocado wraps and corn fritters. The waitress recommended the corn fritters so decided id give it a try. They were horrible. Very bland no taste. Figured you cant go wrong with avocado but I was def wrong lol. Once again very bland. Ive been here b4 and ordered pizza which was good but bad experience with these appetizers. The beer saved it from 2 to 3 stars. Great selection!
Michael A.,"Amarillo, TX",2,66,113,4.0,7/10/2013,Parmesan crusted chicken is excellent; thinly sliced breast meat with both melted Parmesan and grated Parmesan.  Thai wontons are also very good. Would definitely come here again. I found the service much above average.
Megan K.,"Tampa, FL",0,10,,3.0,7/7/2016,"Atmosphere is fun, the food and service used to be AMAZING, but slowly it's becoming very hit or miss when it comes to the food and the service. Main reason we go there now is to watch multiple sports games going on simultaneously."
Lauren C.,"Dunedin, FL",124,740,216,3.0,3/15/2015,"This was my first visit to the citrus park BJs location. The experience had a few ups and a few downs so I'll settle at an average of 3 overall. I called in to reserve a table when I was on my way as I figured they'd be busy on a Friday night at 7 pm. But when we arrived there was only a 5 minute wait since we called ahead. Our server greeted us right away and provided excellent service throughout the whole meal. For drinks, I started off with the orange twist mocktail.  I really like that they have a nice section of alcohol free drinks (4 different mocktail flavors in total) in addition to their full bar and impressive beer choices. My friend and I took our sweet time deciding what to get as we were chatting a bit and the menu is quite extensive, which doesn't make for an easy decision. Since I couldn't decide on ""just"" one thing I opted for the tomato and mozzarella small salad to start followed by the corn fritters and gourmet mac n cheese. The salad was 2 thumbs up, fresh, excellent flavor and nice presentation. The mac and the corn fritters came out next. I've had the mac before but it seems as if they've changed it now. It was decent overall but nothing out of this world or ""gourmet"". The description of the corn fritters on the menu ""served with jalapeño, bacon bits and spicy aioli sauce"" makes it sound better than it actually was. They were overly fried and not all that flavorful. The guilt of eating a fried starch was not worth it In this case. Finished off the evening with a mini white chocolate macadamia pzookie.  OMG. Perhaps I'm the only one who had never experienced that deliciousness before, but wow was It good! And the mini was just the right size. Overall Overall I enjoyed it enough that I would return again but perhaps try something else like a pizza or entrée."
Tonya K.,"Clearwater, FL",2,5,,4.0,6/2/2016,"If you have never tried the Pink Cadillac martini, you should go there and check it out!  I always have two, and they are amazing!  I love the spinach dip and flatbreads.  The menu is very extensive and the service is always pretty good.  the best part, of course, is the pazookie cookie dessert.  My favorite is the triple chocolate!"
Jessica M.,"Tampa, FL",34,19,20,3.0,4/4/2014,"I'll say this first: I'm a beer snob. BJ's beers are just plain not very good. They're one step above your mass produced varieties, but nowhere near as good as a true craft brewery. BUT, they typically have at least one or two good guest taps.  On this particular day, the bartender, nor another employee, could tell me what the 7venth Sun beer was on tap. Just 'it's an IPA'. OK. The brewery makes lots of varieties of those. And they seemed non-plussed that they didn't know. You are a beer bar. If you're going to have guest taps, maybe your bartenders should know what they are. Then my receipt had a completely different beer on it. Maybe I shouldn't have expected more at a chain restaurant/brewhouse in a mall. They have great food. That's why I gave three stars, else it would be less. Their beers are mediocre at best (IMHO), and I guess they can't even be bothered to care what else they're serving on draft. Again... You're a 'brewhouse'...that might be important."
Sam Q.,"Tampa, FL",223,350,2362,4.0,8/13/2012,"Although I frequent the Citrus Park Mall, my culinary choices are mostly restricted to food court fast food as I usually need to get in and out quick.  Once in a while I'll stop in at  BJ's, especially if I'm in the mood to be naughty.   First off, it has the word ""brewhouse"" in the name, so if you're not into beer, you should maybe go elsewhere.  Just sayin.  The beer sampler is AWESOME.  A little bit of everything. Some beers are good, others yucky.  Nice to try them all and try to nail down the differences. Skip the avocado egg rolls.  A bit band and noneventful.  The nachos are meh.  But the bacon cheeseburger pizza is TO DIE FOR!   Literally and figuratively.  It even comes with tiny pieces of pickels.   I don't recall having such a sinful delicious pizza since the Pizzeria Uno days. Ambiance is busy but clean, service was competent.  If you are at the mall and want a sit down dinner, BJs is good.   Order the bacon cheeseburger pizza.  Your arteries will hate you."
Joseph A.,"Tampa, FL",2,132,32,2.0,6/20/2015,"I ate here about a year ago and it was pretty good, but today I was very disappointed. Service was slow, it took a long time to get the food out. We had the jambalaya, it was horrible! The plate was hog but the food was cold. It didn't matter that it was cold, as it was not edible. The rice was dry, no sauce, tasteless shrimp, chicken and sausage. We just left it. The other dish was the flatbread that was just ok. I will go back in the near future and give it another chance."
Jill S.,"Lutz, FL",52,13,,5.0,11/21/2015,"Our favorite go-to place when we want to watch a game (especially multiple at the same time)!  No, the menu isn't gourmet, it is typical American fare, but we have never had a bad meal here.  Appetizers and desserts are fantastic too.  Wide variety of beers.  Service has always been prompt and we are always well taken care of.   Great atmosphere for families, couples or singles (nice bar area!)."
Ron M.,"Tampa, FL",3,41,1,3.0,9/19/2015,"Started with Jean, Came in 2nd time to give them another try from last visit, was given complementary discount. They didn't have the beer I really wanted and was looking forward to so had to get a tea, very disappointed, the burger came out was real good. Just not having beer ruined my enthusiasm to come back. Service was mediocre with Jean. Then got switched to new waitress she was much better very noticing and quick. One more thing to note there was constant flies around our table throughout dinner. My friend meal was totally different than she got it the other time. Overall good burger"
Ty L.,"Dallas, TX",692,324,23,4.0,6/10/2015,"I visited last month while in town for vacation. We had come from seeing a movie in the same mall. Pretty big menu which makes it a little hard to decide. The food was really good.  I had a steak. I remember my strawberry mojitos were excellent. It took a while for the food to come, but steaks take awhile to cook. Definitely a place I would come back to."
