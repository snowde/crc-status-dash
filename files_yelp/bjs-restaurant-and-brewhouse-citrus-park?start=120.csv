M K.,"Tampa, FL",0,28,5,5.0,8/3/2015,"Did a to-go order. Had the pulled pork sandwich with bbq ranch sauce, onion strings and skinny fries. The portions were generous, and overall, the food was tasty and satisfying. Ironically, though, I did not care for their ""world famous"" coleslaw."
D D.,"Tampa, FL",9,84,60,2.0,5/26/2015,"The food was good but the absolutely HORRIBLE service that we got ruined the whole experience. Heed the advice of the post before mine (of the bad service) & don't even waste your time. The restaurant wasn't even busy & the service sucked.  As we sat and sat and sat and sat until we were finally approached by a waiter; however, while we waited, we  observed approximately 10-15 waiters and waitresses standing around doing nothing but gossiping and talking. It honestly felt like we were in a high school cafeteria. Our waiter didn't know anything about the menu, nor did the server who brought out our food. When we asked him a simple question in his reply to ""is there anything else I can do for you?"" He looked at me as if I grew a third eyeball. If you say that to a customer, expect a response or question! I assume he didn't, so when I actually had a question about the menu  & when he couldn't answer my question (bc I guess he doesn't know the menu well enough), he answered it with an ""I don't know."" When he should have asked a manager,asked another waiter, looked at a menu...something!!!!! The service just sucked period. From start to finish. Pizza and apps were good, so you can chance it if you want but we won't be back."
Alicia N.,"Stuart, FL",94,3,1,5.0,5/21/2016,Mmmm! Best restaurant ever!! Love the pizza! And the beer! Oh ... And did I mention the pazookies!?!?? You got to come here if you have not! Satisfaction guaranteed!
Tiffany B.,"Tampa, FL",1,8,13,3.0,1/12/2015,"I like the mall patio. Sitting outside of the restaurant but still inside the mall. The food is pretty good. Great option for mall dining.  I like stopping by for lunch because the meals are priced lower. This visit there was no wait, food came out quickly and we got to enjoy and nice quiet lunch.  I am very happy that they serve cream soda!"
Melanie M.,"Clearwater, FL",382,95,124,4.0,4/8/2015,"Like many people, I came in for a quick drink and appetizer with a friend.  I wanted my usual avocado egg rolls, but found that they were included in a new appetizer combo with other yummy sounding things like egg rolls and mozzarella sticks and such, so we went for that.  It's now become my newest calorie laden go-to at BJ's.  On the second visit, we got that plus a pizza that was pretty good on its own, and upon reheating the leftovers the next day, the crust was even better than before."
Peggy F.,"St. Petersburg, FL",38,4,1,5.0,6/17/2015,"We just left this location. Service and food PHENOMENAL! Our server was Shawn L. If there was a cloning machine available I would insist they clone him. He went above and beyond, made sure we had everything we needed. We had our small autistic son with us and he kept repeating over and over that he wanted to watch soccer on Fox Sports. Shawn quickly had the TV in our view changed to that channel and had our son's pizza out first so he could start eating and would be content. Our son spilled his milk all over the floor and Shawn was back in a flash with towels. We enjoyed our experience very much!"
Amy D.,"Tampa, FL",240,148,30,4.0,9/29/2013,"Make sure to stop by during football - half off appetizers. Win/Win!  A large menu for the whole family with tons of TV's to watch the game for about every team. Whatever you decide on for your entree, the tortilla soup is a must-try. The presentation itself will wow  you.  What else goes well with football? Beer. Half of the menu is beer to choose from. But make sure you save room for dessert....you'll need it after your team loses if you stay until the end of the game."
Amy W.,"Tampa, FL",193,18,,5.0,3/14/2015,Love BJ's!  If I lived closer I'd probably be here all the time!  Always amazing and attentive service at the bar.  The beers on tap are of a wide variety and not one o have tried is bad.  The pizza is TO DIE for!!!  My favorite is the hand tossed or deep dish BJ's Favorite.  The mini size is by far not mini and more than enough for one person.
Michael G.,"Tampa, FL",181,45,38,3.0,7/31/2013,"Been here a few times so this review is a compilation of all my experiences.  I recently went back this past Friday with a few friends.  Despite the fact that BJ's has an enormous menu, I generally order the same entree every time I go: the calzone for two with meatball and pepperoni.  It is really fantastic and I usually finish the whole thing.  BJ's also sports a large selection of their own brews and as I've heard most people say, their seasonal beers really standout.  I do also have to give a thumbs up to there signature sodas, they offer a root beer, cream, orange cream, and black cherry soda that are leagues above store bought varieties.   At this point you may be asking why I'm giving them three stars.  Well, of the times I have been to this location, the service has been hit or miss.  This past Friday night the service was great however there have been times in the past where my party waited for long periods of time for drink refills or for the waiter/waitress to return to the table to take orders, bring food etc.  So it doesn't feel exactly right to rate them higher at this point."
Nichole C.,"Tampa, FL",117,125,124,4.0,1/21/2014,"I actually try and avoid most chains, and reviews of chains, but BJ's Brewhouse, I like! The menu has your typical bar grub, but also a bit nicer dishes, as well. I love that there are TVs all around, but not in an annoying manner, if that makes sense. Their pizzas are good, as are their specialty entrees, and for whatever reason I love their turkey burger. I love the Berry Burst Cider. While I can't say the same for other BJ's locations I have been to, I can say at the Citrus Park spot, I find the service to always be great."
Bill G.,"Lutz, FL",25,55,97,2.0,4/3/2013,"I hope BJ's Owners read Yelp!!! I have been a regular at BJ's for a while (at least once per week).  The food is great and the service use to be.  Over the last 2-3 months service has declined a lot.  We pretty much order the same meals every time we are there.  The last few time we have been there we have had to tell the server the price is wrong.  The services has slowed and the servers act as though they hate their jobs.   We now will only sit in Jackie, Josh, or Dara's section, otherwise you don't know what you will get.  I hope to see improvement soon, because we really enjoy the food and ""Some"" of the servers."
Steve G.,"Seffner, FL",1,12,,5.0,4/11/2015,"Just had ribeye steak. Cooked perfectly and ask by server to cut steak when served to check if steak was cooked to my liking. Was perfect, house made rub is one of the best seasoning I ever tasted. Had the Tuscany tomato soup - also delicious. And this is coming from someone who makes their own from scratch. Servers we're very knowledgable of menu. Over all,  you get the chance to eat here - do !!"
Camaron A.,"Clearwater Beach, FL",375,248,67,4.0,1/23/2013,"I visited this place on NYE 2012, a good friend flew in late from JFK ( late of course typical JFK bs)  She was starved and it was her first time in Tampa and on top of it our options were dwindling as the clock ticked towards midnight.  We figured we would just go to Red Robin , something simple and quick and satisfying after a long and drawn out day. As we got there we noticed BJs next door and they were open , looked alot nicer so we figured we would try them out. It was quite busy for NYE  but ,fortunately we were seated right away. My good friend ordered a BJs Blondie beer and I ordered some tropical fruity cider beverage.  The place is huge but also very cozy in a upscale atmosphere. Our server was extremely friendly and helpful throughout the entire dinner. We started with the typical Spinach and Artichoke dip which was not typical at all , it arrived with a multitude of colorful fresh tasting chips and very fresh spin on a app that has become so overplayed in recent years. My friend ordered the Roast Beef French Dip sandwich a favorite of her's. Her choice was good but nothing great. I ordered the Black and Bleu burger which was good and ample but below par compared to Burger 21 or Square 1.  We opted out of dessert but the dinner was over all was good I would give it a B-, given the circumstances , the time and date it was a better alternative to our original choice and the beverages made the experience even better."
Josiah G.,"Tampa, FL",405,405,29,4.0,10/4/2013,"I had lunch here today and I was pleasantly surprised. I thought this place was just another faux brewery house with bar food, but I was totally wrong. The beers have very cheesy and corny names which didn't make me feel like trying anything, but it was lunch on a weekday, so I really couldn't anyway.  After reading the Cheesecake Factory sized menu, I decided on one of my goto's which is Chicken Parm. I ordered the lunch special which was $12 I think and it comes with a soup or salad. I chose the chicken tortilla soup and was surprised to get a whole bowl of it. I also ordered thai chicken wontons because they were only $3. Those were also delicious like the soup. The entree was big for a lunch special and the chicken parm was crispy and juicy. The marinara was spicy and the spaghetti was cooked perfectly. The service was excellent and my drink never got less than half full. You get a lot of bang for your buck here and low prices are not indicative of low quality as they are in other places. This is great food at a great value."
Mitch L.,"Spring Hill, FL",348,689,1917,4.0,12/21/2012,"I went here with friends after Christmas Shopping. I like the decor. Lots of Televisions so nice place to see sports. I am not a big beer drinker but they have a lot of craft beers to try so that was interesting. All I care about is that a beer taste good so this might be a place to try a new beer next time. We were here for the FOOD!!! I had the New England clam chowder in a bread bowl and the ultimate mac n cheese I think was the name. Both were delicious but like Abby said for us non-readers, I forgot to note it said something like CHIPOLTE which means it would be HOT!!! It was still great but it really did not need the chipolte!! I sample a little of Donna's tomato and mozzarella salad. It was delectable but small. However her stuffed baked potato looked like it was grown in a field next to a nuclear power plant. I am not kidding when i say it had to be 3 or 4 pounds!!! My eyes popped out of my head. Overall I think everyone was satisfied. A couple of times during dinner nobody was chatting which is a sign we were enjoying our food :)"
Thea H.,"Tampa, FL",27,91,3,4.0,9/15/2013,"There are very few places that I would want to be a regular. This is my place. My fiance and I started going to the one in Pinellas Park when we were first going out and I took him there for his birthday. When we moved in together, we started going to this location all the time. We just love this place. The service at this location is hit or miss but only once has it been terrible. The atmosphere is sports and beer with fully clothed male and female waitstaff. In other words, you can take the kids here and have a cold one. The huge screens are for ESPN, ESPN Classic, ESPN 8 ""the ocho"", etc... Beer is also a highlight of this place. It's a ""brewhouse"" after all. The drink menu is extensive but so far I have fallen in love with the Berry Burst Cider and the Double Berry. My fiance enjoys the Black Velvet most of the time. We have tried a few other drinks but those seem to be what we like the best. After so many visits, it's hard to be objective about the food because I've had so many things on the menu. Appetizers we enjoy are the calamari, crispy wantons (buffalo and thai), and the potato skins. The potato skins are double fried so they aren't my favorite. Hands down my favorite entree is the jambalaya. Finally it's a dish with sausage I can eat! It's so perfect with the spices they use. It is a hot dish so if you hate spicy, this is not for you. Another great dish is the balsamic glazed chicken. There have been times the chicken was too dry but when the chicken is just right, it's perfect. I also love the crispy onion strings. So tasty! Desserts are the best here. You can't go wrong with a pizzoki but a real hidden gem is the baked beignet. It's perfection- crisp beignet with ice cream, strawberry syrup, and whipped cream. It's so light and delicious you'll want more than one. It's a great place and it's highly recommended."
Francesca L.,"Tampa, FL",45,172,8,5.0,3/7/2013,"I go to Citrus Park once a week but have never tried BJ's. My mom was in town and we did some shopping and decided to sit down and have a drink and walked into BJs right when they opened around 11am on a Monday. We sat at the bar and the bartender was very friendly.  Mom got a pinot grigio and I got the house brewed hefeweizen draft.  It was really good-but $5.25 for a beer always chaps my @$$...guess that's pretty standard. For lunch, mom ordered the veggie burger (would never eat that so I didn't taste it) and I ordered the Caesar salad with the shrimp tacos. I will dream about those shrimp tacos! There are 2, they are stuffed full but not so full you get all messy.  Comes with chips, salsa and 'avocado cream' on the side which is basically a less thick version of guacamole.  Very delicious and not too filling so you don't feel like a cow trying on clothes afterwards. Will definitely go back again for a draft and those shrimp tacos!"
Rebecca V.,"Tampa, FL",157,226,75,5.0,6/24/2013,"Food is always consistent and good, my favorite is the balsamic chicken but I have tried many other dishes and all are very tasty! great selection of beers and other drinks, large screen tvs which is great for those games you don't wanna miss."
JuanG R.,"Westchase, FL",48,26,9,5.0,10/18/2014,We came on a Friday night and didn't have to wait long which was awesome; is a great place for both kids and adults. Food was delicious and atmosphere was great! Definitely recommend and will definitely be back!
Lori H.,"Oldsmar, Tampa Bay, FL",2,6,,2.0,11/12/2015,"Food was good, but service was horrible!  Took 10 minutes to come to the table to greet us.  She brought the wrong drink to me when she refilled.  All parts of service were extremely slow.  Very disappointed.  My kids ordered the salad as a side and they were given shredded lettuce (which I had to pick through to get rid of the slimy pieces) with a couple of slices of tomato.  The waitress never came back to check on us during the meal."
