Mike W.,"Linden, NJ",119,247,643,4.0,2/14/2013,"Wow. What can I say? A restaurant that brings together great drinks, good atmosphere, and an impressive menu. Let me first say that this restaurant, at least on Friday and Saturday evenings, usually has a 30-45 minute wait, but they do offer call-ahead seating - take advantage of it! The first think you will be introduced to when you get seated (or approach the bar if you're waiting for a table) is the well thought out menu of beers crafted especially for this restaurant. There's a little of something for everyone- lighter beers, heavier beers- and even a seasonal beer fitting the appropriate time of year. The menu at BJ's has EVERYTHING. Literally. Pizza (wonderful), pasta dishes (excellent), chicken dishes (you gotta try the Parmesan crusted chicken), and more. Honestly, I have no idea how the kitchen keeps up with everything that folks order, but they do. I've been to this restaurant twice and have been very impressed with the skill our meals were prepared with. The only thing I'd like to see changed is the dessert menu - it's very heavy on baked good (ie. cookies) where I'd like to see some more creative items on the menu to match the rest of the offerings. There's gotta be a beer recipe or two that they could use. Overall, a very good choice for dinner, especially if you have a beer lover in the family. Just be sure to call ahead and put your name on the list in case they have a wait."
Joe N.,"Palm Harbor, FL",17,22,,1.0,4/6/2014,"My fiance and I went here for the crispy jalapeno burger. We got seated reasonably quick despite it being a Friday night. All was good until our server, four minutes after our food was brought out, and while I was literally holding and eating my burger, starts handling my plate suggesting that we get a to go box. Excuse me?! I was under the impression that holding my food and consuming it would be a pretty solid indicator that I am in no way finished and needing to get out. Manager: is this something you encourage to flip tables quicker?  If so, this practice sucks and is rude. If not, your staff needs to stop rushing your paying patrons out so they can get another tip. Four thumbs down.  We will not be returning."
Haley D.,"Tampa, FL",273,94,7,3.0,2/7/2014,"We typically don't do sit down dinners with the kids, but we were wanting something other than our usual food court take-out, so we stopped for a quick bite on our way out of the mall.   The staff was extremely  helpful in seating us in a semi-private area so we would not bother patrons with our rambunctious child.   I was in the mood for a salad so I ordered the BBQ Chicken Salad.  This salad is jam packed with ingredients -which I love.  It makes me feel like I'm eating more than just a ""salad.""  The dressing was plentiful and the lettuce and vegetables were fresh and crisp.  The chicken was hot and diced into small bite size pieces.  Thanks to my husband holding our daughter, I was actually able to clear my plate (it's not easy juggling a child and eating a salad with lots of little pieces)   The staff is always friendly and very helpful and the ambiance is loud and fun like a Brewhouse should be.  This would definitely be a perfect place for a couple pals watching a game or catching up with the girlfriends.  I haven't tried the beer, but I've heard remarkable things about the samplers."
Mateo H.,"Tampa, FL",0,31,,4.0,11/29/2015,"Eaten here many times. Always a very relaxing meal with a friendly staff. Tasty beers and good, healthy food."
Natalie Y.,"Tampa, FL",3,8,,4.0,6/7/2013,"I really enjoy coming to this restaurant. It's nice enough to have a birthday dinner here, yet casual enough to have a simple lunch as well. The service here though can go both ways. They have amazing waiters, yet they also have not so nice ones. If you do have a problem with their staff, don't be afraid to ask for the manager. Their managers are very nice and will help in any way. BJ's has their own crafted beers. They also have a wide selection of their own drinks. I have had a few and haven't been disappointed in any. Their menu is huge, offering selections of pizzas, sandwiches, pastas, etc. The food is very yummy and cooked well. I haven't had a dish I didn't like. I highly recommend to save room for dessert. Their signature dessert is the pizookie. It''s a huge cookie that comes in a pie dish with ice cream and whipped cream. It is to die for! You can get different types of the cookie and most come with their homemade vanilla ice cream. I love it!"
Eric S.,"Murphy, NC",0,9,1,2.0,2/23/2013,"First I will state we are big fans of BJ's and have dined in many of their restaurants across the country....We were so happy when the one came to Citrus Park. One of the draws for us is the handcrafted beer, we especially like the Jeremiah Red. We stopped by Saturday around 4:30 for an appetizer and a beer after shopping. The restaurant was slow preparing for  the dinner crowd as there were a lot of servers standing around doing nothing. The beer and food was as usual and expected...what was disappointing for us was the service and cleanliness of the restaurant...It started when  I used the brass hand rail and my hand stuck to the rail, then we were seated at a booth that my wife hand to wipe the seat.....I put my elbows on the table (bad manners) and the table was so sticky they stuck....wait...then I open the menu and there is food smeared all over it....makes me really wonder what the kitchen looks like these days. There were two male managers working the floor and they obviously had some type of disagreement happening which created a stressful vibe in the place. It seems the current management is not up to BJ's standards as this is the worst we have seen it in years. Hopefully corporate will show up and clean the place up."
Da Vman V.,"Mahwah, NJ",1,109,113,2.0,1/16/2014,I specifically told the hostess that the table she was trying to sit us at was still dirty. She had to check if it was ok to give me the next table over?? After all that they never went back to clean the other table & sat 2 women. I mentioned something to the 2 patrons & they had to ask to have it cleaned. Jaclyn AKA Jackie was very nice!
Alex A.,"Orlando, FL",0,11,,4.0,9/13/2015,"Pretty consistent, avocado eggrolls are great so are the brussel sprouts for appetizers, for food the flatbreads are good. sometimes you just gotta know what to order. also we rarely have to wait long to be seated even on busy days so I like that too service is good. What can I say, for a franchise its a good place."
Joe K.,"New Port Richey, FL",0,2,,4.0,8/19/2014,Love it cold beer  Great food  Good staff place is clean go there a lot. If you like good food at a good price them check this place out. It's at citrus park mall
Shauna L.,"Tampa, FL",11,16,1,4.0,5/10/2014,"This is a great restaurant with something for everyone! I've been here several times over the last few years, sometimes with a group (it's a great place for a group) and never heard anyone complain. The drink menu is amazing too with a great beer and wine menu. I wouldn't suggest BJs for a date night, the big TVs by the bar can easily be a distraction for most men :-)."
Mike V.,"Tampa, FL",57,133,19,4.0,2/22/2014,"Mmmm.  The 'enlightened' bison burger is excellent!  Under 575 calories & you leave satisfied like after a regular burger, but with no grease seeping out of your pores!"
Amanda C.,"Odessa, FL",36,141,196,4.0,7/12/2013,I have never had a bad experience at BJ's.  Although a bit pricey they have good food with lots of different options on the menu.  Of course their beer selection is the best part!
Doc B.,"Freehold, NJ",22,201,,3.0,3/18/2012,"Been here a couple of times. The food is decent.  A burger was nothing special.  Pulled pork was reasonably good. I had a glass of good stout, probably better than anything else at my table. The service was good and the manager was circulating, keeping his eye on things, asking patrons how they were doing. It's in a mall, so don't look for artisinal food.  Be happy they have something better than Bud Lite to drink."
Richard A.,"Odessa, FL",0,44,,2.0,2/25/2012,Last night my wife and I went to BJ's to try their new Asian menu.  We've been to BJ's many times before.  This time it was not very good. We ordered two glasses of wine.  I thought that the wine was a dollar or two more than any other local restaurant for the same brands. My wife ordered the Kung Pao Chicken and I ordered the Terriyaki Shrimp. My wife said that her meal was OK.  I had to send mine back.  The dish was loaded with pepper.  Terriyaki is not a peppery dish.  I then ordered Chicken Marsala.  It was just passable. I will say when I had a problem with my meal the waiter acted to correct the situation immediately.  The manager picked up the bad meal and appoligized. I think that BJ's is probably best for burgers and pizza.
Christie L.,"Vancouver, WA",7,36,,1.0,8/11/2013,"Let me first say that we have gone to this BJs for several years now. The beer is always good and the food has been OK. The quality of the food has gradually gone down hill until I finally had my first 'I can't eat this' experience. I love food and when I am really hungry (like I was today) I am not even that picky. I ordered their 'new' Bison burger cooked medium. The server said 'good choice'. Clearly this guy has never eaten this piece of crap. I love Bison burgers but I know the food here is never that great so I didn't even have super high expectations and like I said, I was starving!!! It comes out and here is the breakdown: (1) the burger is a tiny burger on a HUGE bun with a HUGE piece of lettuce, took me about 5 bites to even hit the crappy burger (2) 2 bites in to actual burger and I have to pull a sharp, hard piece of bone out of my mouth (3) the burger is an under-seasoned, greasy, and mushy piece of what had to be a previously frozen patty (4) I asked for it to be cooked medium but it was pretty much warm on the outside and raw mush on the inside I eat about 3 bites of actual burger and decide I can't continue. I don't think I have ever not eaten a meal at any other restaurant, it was that bad. The waiter asks if I want a to-go box and when I say 'No' he smiles like 'that good eh?' so I felt obligated to enlighten this idiot about the fact that this burger is so disgusting I can't eat any more of it."
Ksenia A.,"Tampa, FL",1,3,3,5.0,6/5/2014,"Some of the other reviews site bad service for not giving 5 stars. Yes, the service is hit or miss, but for the most part, it's never been a huge issue for us. But because we ALWAYS love the food, BJs gets 5 stars from me! Yummy."
Dylan J.,"Carrollwood, Tampa Bay, FL",0,1,,1.0,7/26/2013,"I'm currently sitting at BJ's, and I have had the most bizarre, irritating, and somewhat offensive experience of my life.  When my wife, two children, and I arrived at Westfield, I noticed that BJs was crowded. So my wife decided that she and tke kids would go to walk through the mall, and I checked in and got a buzzer. We were told it would be about 15-20 minutes, so I put the buzzer at the bar, went to the restroom to wash my hands, came back to the seat at the bar, ordered a beer, and started watching the Rays. Altogether about a minute and a half.  Before the (very nice and attentive) bartender could deliver my Piranha Pale Ale, the buzzer went off. I was cool with the immediate seating, but somewhat peeved about the ""underpromise"" seating practice. Just tell me what's going to happen and fulfill those expectations, so I don't send my party somewhere else when you're prepared to seat us. Then, as I was standing at the hosting stand, trying to get a hold of my wife, things got shitty. One party came through (without ever holding a buzzer and with a wink from a server) and was seated right next to the bar. Ok, whatever, they know a server, and a lot of restaurants seat adults in areas like that before parties with kids.  Then, a second party, who had arrived later than we had (same total number and same number of children) was seated in the front area by the windows.  My family got back, and we were standing in the lobby, surrounded by other families. I clutched the beer close to my leg, trying to hide it. I'm more comfortable drinking a beer at the bar than in the waiting area; that's just a weird thing to do. After about five minutes, I asked the hostess what was up. Our table was ""being cleaned."" It took about thirty minutes for this table to be cleaned. When we finally were seated, it was at a table I can only assume is number terrible. The server station is actually attached to the booth, so as the servers retrieve silverware and other table settings, the drawers are slamming on our backs. Moreover, busy servers store discarded food on top of this station. It's literally so close that you could be enjoying your meal, have a hearty laugh or a stretch, and end up dropping your head on a plate of (canned, reheated, half-eaten) spaghetti. We're still waiting on our simple order of two kids chicken tenders, a jalapeño burger, and a corn fritter app. It's been an hour. I will never come back to BJs; we'll just go next door to the more appropriately priced Red Robin or the more foodie Giordano's instead. Or even Johnny Rocket's, at least they have a theme.  Both my wife and I are very busy professionally, we spend about $800 a month eating out. None of that will go to BJs anymore. You don't expect Bern's, but you don't expect blatant, unwarranted, and simply strange bad service either. If I could give 0 stars, I would."
Whitney J.,"Tampa, FL",0,15,,4.0,3/22/2014,"I always enjoy this place! Great food, good beer options and I like the enlightened entrees to choose from. Yum!"
Jill D.,"Tampa, FL",0,4,,4.0,6/28/2013,"Delicious food and usually a very friendly waiters, a bit pricey for the size of the dishes and always takes a looong time even on the slow days. But try the pizookie, it's amazing!!"
Emily H.,"New York, NY",0,126,,3.0,10/29/2011,"So this is a place that normally I would not go. Not that I am a snob. Alright, maybe I am but I have come here a few times over the last year and it is not bad. I seriously hope AA does not consider this place for a meeting because they push booze so much, you are left speechless. the first half of the menu is booze. Passive aggression and desserts called bizookies which are like pumped up cookies are served constantly by the staff.  Hostess: "" You don't mind if I seat you here right?"" So, thankfully the wait staff is more than patient with the huge menu. Food here is alright. Some dishes with rice don't look great but the steak salad, the long pizzas and the sandwiches are fine for a mall. You could do worse than at BJ's. Amazing that I just wrote that."
