Austin L.,"New Orleans, LA",0,1,,1.0,3/26/2013,"After waiting an hour in a half empty restaurant, we finally got our food. The pasta was undercooked, and cold. Not ""sitting on the table cold"", like out of the refrigerator cold. My girlfriends pasta was over cooked. Service is ok but terribly slow. Awful food, will NEVER come back. I literally made a help account to give this review it was so bad"
N B.,"Tampa, FL",1,8,,1.0,3/11/2014,"We ordered a deep dish pizza. The menu and website says deep dish pizza. The pic on the website looks like a real deep dish pizza, but it turned out to just be a normal pan pizza....nowhere near the thickness of a deep dish pizza and most of it's thickness was dough with little cheese/sauce. Because of this blatant lie I have to give it a one star.   Even though it was good quality and taste, it was overpriced even for a quality pizza joint."
Sean B.,"New Port Richey, FL",49,6,2,1.0,12/22/2014,"Grossed out. Being someone that loves good beer I decided to hang at the bar while my family shopped. The beer was good until a bartender followed a customers requested.  He was drinking Stella , & she asked if he'd like another. He said  yes  & "" you can use the same glass.""  She grabbed his glass with his last spit hit on it. & proceeded to fill it. As the beer got to the top she put the full tap in his glass. Would have been fine with a new glass but with a used one , YUK !  I now wonder how many other beers get other peoples backwash in them. At $6 a beer you'd expect a clean pour. Never coming back."
Kari C.,"Tampa, FL",68,23,,3.0,8/19/2013,"I've had mixed results with eating at thie BJ's Brewhouse.  I love the pizza, sandwiches and lunch specials, but every time I get the roasted chicken, it's undercooked.  Once i had to send my undercooked chicken back twice, and finally the manager came over to offer me the option of a different meal because his ""cooks can't get it right today.""  I was disappointed because this happens to be one of the healthiest things on the menu, but the manager was friendly and helpful in offering healthy alternative meal options.  Overall service here has been decent, and the seasonal beer selections have been fantastic.  I love the atmosphere and large menu, and the location is very convenient.  I will be back, but I won't order the chicken again."
Harry R.,"Falls Church, VA",51,115,,2.0,6/27/2011,"If you have been to DC and sat down in any of the Great American Restaurant establishments you have seen an upgraded version of BJ's.  Sat for about 25min waiting for them to find space for seven inside.  Seemed a bit odd.  Restaurant wasn't packed - in fact, they actually had an empty section, and we ended up seated there after the initial wait.  I can understand the hostess not pulling the trigger on that kind of decision if the manager was on break.  But, the manager was part of our introduction when we first arrived.  Tough way to start things off. Service was good.  Fried calamari was cooked nicely and still very tender.  Avocado rolls came with their own ""stones"" or pieces of inedible pit.  Yikes.  Not so good.  The California burger sounded great on the menu: toasted sourdough bread, avocado, roasted green chilies, pepper jack cheese, chipotle mayonnaise and ranch dressing.  Sure it will blow out an artery if you're not careful, but man it was delicious in my imagination. On the plate - not so strong.  Something was missing.  I tried adding a slice of tomato, but still no dice.  Mediterranean pizza was a big hit and the potstickers seemed to be a happy choice along with the Caprese salad.   The bazooki was crazy, warm baked cookie topped with ice cream. All in all - not bad, but nothing for the other big chain restaurants (or big box stores) to worry about. ."
Benjina D.,"Frisco, TX",835,188,438,4.0,3/24/2013,"Pretty good, as chains go. I love their baked potatos, and they're big enough for two meals. Of course, the pizookies are why this place is so popular. They are Ah-may-zing! Service is okay, the wait staff aren't always together."
Burr C.,"Tampa, FL",0,29,62,4.0,10/17/2011,"I often eat at the bar for lunch.  There is a good selection of micro brews.  My choice is the american brown ale Nutty Brunette.  The appetizers are good and go well with their beers.  The avocado egg rolls are flavorful and my favorite there.   If you need a lighter dish after beer and appetizers, try the The Angel Hair Toscana pasta.  I get it with with grilled chicken."
Michael L.,"Tampa, FL",21,25,1,4.0,12/3/2012,BJ's is consistantly good.  everytime we go we have great service and good food even though the place is packed.
Ed N.,"St. Petersburg, FL",48,22,5,1.0,4/4/2014,Horrible experience. Food was ok but the service and manager were terrible. Had to wait some time for our server who seemed to not know what she was doing or was intoxicated on some substance. After finishing and waiting for our check for 15-20 mins we ended up getting and paying for someone else's check. After waiting all that time I simply gave the waitress my card and didn't look over the check. My wife however did notice it once the waitress returned and let her know. She apologized and went to correct it and bring the proper check. We asked if she had voided the first transaction from our card and she claimed she had. So we paid again and left FINALLY. After checking my CC statement I noticed we had been charged for both checks. I called and spoke with the manager on the phone who apologized and said to bring in the statement and she would take care of it. So on my own time I returned and was greeted by a very unfriendly wench of a manager whos name now escapes me. She acted like she was doing me a favor and took forever to correct the matter. Watched her talking on her cell phone while she was supposed to be crediting my card. Worst manager Ive seen.
Bryan T.,"Tampa, FL",202,41,43,4.0,4/4/2013,Great place for wide variety of good eats. The deep dish pizza is great the pork sandwich is very tasty and the hamburger is better then Red Robin. If your at Citrus park mall and need some fuel this is your place!
Vishal M.,"Tampa, FL",51,16,1,3.0,6/4/2013,"Nice Beer's, Mocktails flavour....Try Orange twist its...nice...Avocado Eggplant rolls are delicious,,,,,"
John F.,"Alexandria, VA",0,26,,3.0,10/13/2014,"Great choices of draft beers and ales. Plenty of big screens with games of all types.  Food is average. Service at dinner can be good  (although they gave us a beeper that didn't work), but some lunch orders were  screwed up.  Go for the sports bar and not the food."
Holly H.,"Melissa, TX",9,81,2,4.0,3/5/2010,"I think this is a very nice restaurant and brewery.  They have a great 7 beer taster set for about $10. You get pretty large ""samples"" of their seven main beers. It's a great way to discover what you like, and since they aren't tiny little tasters, you can let multiple people try them out to see who likes what before ordering themselves a beer.  Their chips and salsa are yummy. The salsa is just spicy enough without going overboard, and the tri colored chips really entertain the little kids that I've gone there with.  I've had a few different entrees there, and all were yummy. I usually can't eat the entire place of food because there's simply too much.  The Parmesan encrusted chicken is delicious, especially with the cheesy mashed potatoes that come with it.  The Hamburger sliders are yummy and make for a good lunch.  The menu is large, and everything always sounds so good. I'd say the only problem with BJ's is that you have to choose one thing to eat...and it's difficult.  The desserts are amazing! They have these things called Pazooki's (I think that's how it's spelled) they are 5-6 inch cookies in a little pan with two scoops of ice cream on top. They have 4 different cookies I believe (choc. chip, macadamia nut, Oatmeal raisin, and choc. choc chip I think) They also have an oreo version. They donate part of the proceeds to a children's foundation as well. I've had the oatmeal cookie one which was very good, but I'm more in love with the brownie! They also have BJ's Brownie...it's a gooey brownie in a pan with three scoops of ice cream, whipped topping, chocolate sauce, and cherries on top. Delicious!"
Benjamin M.,"Denver, CO",208,199,139,2.0,3/12/2010,"I ate at BJ's on a Tuesday night around 9pm and the restaurant was nearly empty. I guess this location is kinda out of the way. I've lived in Tampa for nearly four years, and this was my first time to Citrus Park Mall. I think BJ's would be much more popular if it was at International Plaza or even the Westfield in Brandon.  A colleague recommended the pizzas, so I ordered the buffalo chicken pizza. When our server brought my pizza, I could almost hear my arteries moaning. The buffalo chicken pizza may be one of the most unhealthy foods on the menu--but WOW it was good!  BJ's is famous for their beer and their pizookies. I don't drink, but I did try a pizookie--an amazing dessert involving a giant chewy cookie topped with exorbitant amounts of ice cream topped with chocolates and sugary syrups. This is a fantastic way to follow an ultra unhealthy meal, right? This place can make Five Guys look like Subway. The bottom line: if you want to get drunk and pump yourself full of trans fats, then BJ's should be #1 on your list. Personally, I will only return if doctors discover preventative medicines for heart disease."
Chad Z.,"Tampa, FL",3,16,3,5.0,12/15/2012,"I went to BJ's for the first time tonight and I must say that I was absolutely impressed with everything they had to offer. Their menu was very extensive and detailed; there is something for anybody there. I had the grilled chicken pasta, which was absolutely delicious. Not only is BJ's a restaurant, but it is also a brewhouse. They have many of their own beers there which is great for those who like to venture into different craft beers every once in a while. I'll definitely be going back. I highly recommend BJ's - great staff, great menu, and great beers. What's not to love about that?"
T T.,"Wesley Chapel, FL",0,17,18,5.0,3/8/2013,"Finally a great deep dish, Chicago style pizza establishment in Tampa! No more cravings for UNO Pizza in Orlando! (although nothing beats their deep dish!) My wife and I decided to eat at BJ's at Citrus Park Mall for lunch. We were greeted at the door with a friendly welcome and smile. We were promptly seated by the hostess, and shortly thereafter Maria introduced herself as our server, again with a friendly smile, and took our drink order, which arrived very quickly. We mentioned to her that this was our first time eating here, so she took the time to explain the different menu options, and with the many questions we had, she was VERY patient with us. She gave us plenty of time time to review the menu, and checked with us occasionally to see if we were ready to order or had any questions. Not once did we feel rushed, or forgotten about. We decided on the BJ's Favorite deep dish pizza. Our pizza arrived very quickly, less than 20 minutes, all the while our drinks were continually topped off. The pizza was thick, hot and tasty! If there was one down side to the pizza, it was a bit dry. There seemed to be a lack of tomato sauce, but the sweet crust and other flavorful toppings were great. Maria continued to top off our drinks and took away any trash/dirty plates and was very friendly. We could not have asked for a better server, props to her!!! The atmoshere was very good, clean and inviting. Several big flat screen TVs were placed throughout the establishment, all showing a different variety of sports, not to mention the huge 4 screen TV behind the bar. The restrooms were elegantly clean and tidy.  I look forward to my next visit so I can explore the other menu options, like the pizookie and their own home brew! We will ask for Maria to be our server next time as she was exceptionally wonderful and friendly, and hopefully BJ's will step it up on the tomato sauce!! Still giving this 5 stars as it was an almost perfect dining experience!!!!"
Edwin M.,"Odenton, MD",3,14,4,3.0,10/27/2012,Food was grossly underwhelming but the house made sodas were to die for!!! I am a non-alcoholic /caffeine free consumer so I have defaulted into the realm of being a Root Beer lover. The root beer here really ticklied my fancy and the service was outstanding! I would recommend everyone to stop by at least one time!
Erin S.,"Tampa, FL",95,163,146,4.0,6/10/2013,"My boyfriend suggested bj's so we could grab a bite to eat before a movie. I had never heard of it, but it seemed to have a decent rating so I agreed. I did get a tad annoyed at having to wait over 5 min for a hostess to greet us, but the service the rest of the time was good so no biggie. We ordered two items off of the ""small bites"" menu to start with, which is essentially a small one-person appetizer. We choose the buffalo & blue cheese crispy wontons and the bruschetta, both were delicious. Upon ordering a sandwich for my meal, I was told how gigantic they are so we split a bbq pulled pork sandwich with fries. Honestly, the pork was dry and I wasnt impressed. It seemed like it was missing something besides the pork, onion strings, and a toasted bun. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing, but given the appetizers and good atmosphere I would come back. Bj's also has a huge menu of craft beer but I dont like beer enough to pay 6$ for a glass, so I cant give an opinion on that. Overall, I think its a decent joint with a well rounded menu, they also cater and can take on parties of up to 100 people."
Elisha A.,"Tampa, FL",12,27,,4.0,11/19/2012,"BJ's across the globe are a great place to go with the family. The food is great and for what you get it is not very expensive. This one in particular serves the food fast than most of the ones I have been to, and aside from it being a little crowded everything was great. The only problem I have is that none of their food really has that WOW factor; still good though."
Cheryl J.,"Tampa, FL",52,32,12,4.0,9/25/2011,Great atmosphere. Had the shrimp tacos; they were AWESOME. Fast service. Loud enough to have a conversation that can't be heard but not too loud where you can't hear each other; this makes it great for kids!
