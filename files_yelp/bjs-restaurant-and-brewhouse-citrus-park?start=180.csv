Phil H.,"Waipahu, HI",16,33,,2.0,3/24/2009,"The good: it looks pretty, there's a bar, some tvs. The 2 stars b/c: The food isn't special, definitely not worth the prices. I'm not a fan of Cheesecake Factory aside of the obvious, but this was to me a poor man's CF. I do believe there is a microbrewery, but I haven't tried any of their brews."
Rebekah C.,"Wesley Chapel, FL",0,1,,1.0,3/3/2014,"We went to BJ's for my friend's birthday and we were all very, very disappointed! We had two waiters for our table one of the guys was supposed to be ""in training"" which we found out was not true. They took a very long time to get our order, they let our drinks get watered down and empty for 15-20 min before refilling them. They took over 30 min to get our food and they only served one or two of us at a time and took 10-15 minutes before they served two more people in our party. They were not busy at all so we did not understand why they were taking so long. Then the waiter ""in training"" spilled a drink on a guy in our party and did not tell the manager, (he tried to cover it up) he didn't seem apologetic at all. They also told my friend that she could not have her free birthday dinner that she had previously been told she could have if she signed up and got a BJ's card. once the manager was told, he apologized and gave everyone half off our meals and gave the birthday girl and the guy that had the drink spilled on him, free dinners. Everyone was happy, but then the waiter shorted EVERYONE on our change (the ones that paid cash for their dinners). I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE! TERRIBLE SERVICE AND THE FOOD WASN'T ALL THAT GREAT EITHER.  This was supposed to be a special night for my friend's birthday and instead it was a disaster!  Not happy at all! :("
Vincent W.,"Tampa, FL",16,82,,2.0,3/18/2009,"The server was great and the place was nicely decorated and that's about the high point of my dinner at this place. My table ordered the spinach artichoke dip for appet., I've had much better.  The dip was kind of watery, can't really taste the spinach or artichoke, even though both were in the sauce.  For this dish, if the dip is bad it's pretty much downhill. I ordered salmon, with rice pilaf and steamed vegetables.  The entree also came with a side salad, I had the house with raspberry vinaigrette.   Side salad:  Flavor of the dressing wasn't really there.  It's raspberry, suppose to be a little sweet, I couldn't taste it.  It was mostly sour and water down.  The water down taste probably came from the lettuce itself.  It tasted like they just washed it and didn't dry it so lot of water was still in the salad. Salmon with rice pilaf and steamed vegetables: The salmon was grilled nicely but was very bland.  The ""steamed vegetables"" should've been called raw vegetables on the side.  It wasn't cooked all the way.  It had zucchini, cauliflower and broccoli.  All 3 were undercooked.  For the zucchini I wasn't able to eat the whole thing, only ate the middle and left rest because it was so hard.  Cauliflower and broccoli made me felt like I was eating a salad again.  The rice was probably the best thing on my plate. I also ordered iced tea.  I had it sweet first, but it was way too sweet, felt like I was drinking sugar water.  The server was very nice and switched it for me to unsweet, which wasn't much better but at least I wasn't going on a sugar high. I might come back here again after a long long long time, at least long enough for me to forget this time.  So enter at your own risk and good luck."
Karen E.,"Oldsmar, FL",3,35,,4.0,12/9/2012,Had drinks and lunch there and it was yummy. The food can be a little pricey fo a sports bar but the quality and service is always good.
Pete L.,"Tampa, FL",1,6,,2.0,8/31/2009,"I like this place because it gives me a place to go while the brood is shopping, good beer, a variety of sports on the big screens, and most of the staff is friendly and well trained (most not all). The bad: Went shopping Friday and decided to stay and have dinner instead of the usual couple of beers. After a couple of try's we found a seat at the bar, in front of the game we wanted to watch. Decided to try their $20 deal, like just every other chain is offering. The salad: Is not the baby greens as listed on the regular menu (is supposed to be the same in the promotional deal), the salad is just the bag type you buy at a discount warehouse, not good. BAD. The manager decides to change the televisions to a game that suited him better, without asking the people around the bar that were watching the games.  I don't know but most places ask before changing to get a compromise (not BJ's). I was a bit ticked off, went told that my game was still on, on the very opposite corner of the bar, I could watch it there. NOT. Asked for my stuff to be boxed to take home (did not finish the meal there). The cookie, that is part of the deal, is like raw dough and grainy sugar, not good, The bartender, could have been better, she did not take it well when I asked her to tell the manager that I did not appreciate him changing the game. To bad I had my stuff boxed and ready to go and had given her the tip already. I did tell the manager myself when I saw him by the podium in my way out. The good: The pizza was fantastic like always. I will just stay away for while, the manager will change eventually, his sales must be in the dumps; the Friday night crowd was kind of thin."
Blair H.,"Tampa, FL",17,10,1,5.0,1/20/2012,"freaking love this place.... Great food and tons of choices.  why go to chilli's across the street, when you and get better food here for about the same price?"
Jay V.,"Lutz, FL",52,175,93,3.0,10/13/2009,"the atmosphere is nice.. and our server was good..and the food runners were pleasant.... they got us what we wanted...and checked up on us ever so often..  it's an American cuisine place.. not new American..not fusion. just plain-o American..so all the flavoring are going to be basic stuff.. meaning nothing unique we had the california club flatbread appetizer .. which was good, but a little expensive for just flatbread..and minimal toppings.. (yeah i think the cook kind of went skimpy on this one)..  i ordered the burger melt w/ the crispy thin fries.. it was just a plain-o patty melt with two types of cheese and onions.. along with what i think is 1000 island..  my sister ordered the chardonnay shrimp pasta.. which was good..but the sauce could have been a bit thicker..and it would have been perfect the TV's seems to always been on some sports channel.. so if you want your sports..you can always kick it here and have some draft beers.. i'll probably go here again..if i just want some typical American food.. sometimes it's just nice to have some simple American food in a simple casual atmosphere."
