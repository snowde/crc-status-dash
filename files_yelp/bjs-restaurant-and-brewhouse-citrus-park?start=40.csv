Jeffrey E.,"Tampa, FL",0,26,3,2.0,9/8/2017,"Our experience started with the server apologizing about a wait for our greet time. We waited about 8-10 minutes for a greet which isn't too bad as I've never eaten here before and I was definitely looking through the rather robust menu. Ordered a beer and vanilla cream soda that was drank all the way through the first 5 minutes of getting it. Mind you this was probably an hour experience. We ordered sliders w fries ,avocado egg rolls and Brussels sprouts.  Our server came back once through the entire menu to just drop off our check. No refill no nothing.  Food was very tasty, just the server was bad. She was definitely concentrating on the larger party in her section and we were ignored. Great food, terrible server. Seemed like she was weeded with the 6 tables in her section. No manager table touch... server was a young, red haired server... kudos to the chef, server just needs more training. Saturday 9/8 8:11pm section closest to the entrance.  The other couple next to us would ask for a refill, she would nod her head in acknowledgement and proceed to take order from 5 top with questions. Refill then became less of a priority and guest experience suffer. Next!"
Amanda Y.,"University, Minneapolis, MN",2,10,3,5.0,1/10/2017,Great restaurant with great house made beers! Happy hour is wonderful (half off apps and alcohol specials) and their dessert cookies are to die for. My husband and I regularly go here to eat and have never been disappointed with their food or service!
Angelina F.,"South Tampa, Tampa Bay, FL",442,54,189,4.0,5/23/2016,Our family really enjoys this restaurant. There is something for everyone. I really appreciate the enlightened meals that give you the calorie count. The only reason I'm not giving them five stars is because they took away two of my favorite item. The Thai mango chicken salad and the bruschetta appetizer. Other than that it's a wonderful place with a great atmosphere and friendly staff.
Gary F.,"Tampa, FL",82,65,126,4.0,1/15/2017,"This was my first time here. The menu was pretty large, they have something for everyone that's for sure. Everything was decent, nothing extraordinary. Service was fine. I had the deluxe burger that has guacamole on it. It was served with steak fries, more than an adequate portion - I only ate half. Everyone at my table seemed to enjoy their food. Pretty good spot for a mall restaurant. If I was at countryside mall again I might give it another shot!"
Scott M.,"Holiday, FL",46,113,120,3.0,11/27/2015,Not bad not great . Nice place to take me to take a   squared pizza is much  better in all categories
Diana A.,"Tampa, FL",319,175,112,2.0,10/6/2015,"Can't believe I have to lower stars on this place. Was one of my favorite places. Last time I went service was not great. This time was not good AGAIN. Both times took over 5 min to even get a greet from a server. I was a server for a long time, if it took more than 45 seconds to greet a table it was unacceptable. If you're busy at least say hello to the table. Iv  never seen this at any other restaurant happening  twice. Server was forgetful. Hoping it was a one time thing but guess not . I always get the crusted chicken, was bland and And over cooked wasn't impressed.  They took away their nachos. Which is sad because they used to be so oooey goey good until they started skimping on the cheese. It's like a metaphor for this place.... Was delish then got lazy.  Hate to give this place this review but needs to be improved."
Marci C.,"Port St. Lucie, FL",0,5,,5.0,4/2/2017,"I had my bachelorette party in tampa this weekend before the party we went to bjs for dinner.  I have to say our server Marcus was  wonderful and the food was to die for.  We left very happy and wishing they had a bjs in port st lucie florida (that's where we are from) we highly recommend this place for lunch, dinner and drinks!"
Chonya A.,"Wesley Chapel, FL",219,14,48,5.0,1/29/2017,This has become our new favorite place to eat in Wesley chapel. The food is great. The portions are a good size for the price and the staff has always been friendly and attentive.
C-Mac W.,"Tampa, FL",40,57,16,5.0,6/4/2016,Highly recommend sitting at the bar. Best seat in the house! Why? Because Billie is by far one of the best bartenders I have ever encountered. And we eat out and travel a lot!  Billie delivers amazing customer service and makes everyone feel special. She has an amazing memory and is always on her game. BJs is lucky to have her in the team. P.S. Try the pear cider...so delicious!!! The monkey bread is so yummy!!!!!
Kristy S.,"Winter Park, FL",83,100,134,2.0,9/18/2015,"We stopped by only to get dessert.  We'd never been  to any BJ's before and we came because my brother-in-law had points to redeem for a pizookie (pizza and cookie).  The hostess took us to our seats and the server promptly got us our drinks.  Unfortunately, my husband order a Red Buffalo that didn't have its layers. The server said she asked the bartender and he said it was because it was coming out of the tap thinner than usual.  When the pizookie came out, it looked nothing like the picture, which was disappointing. We got it half Salted Caramel and half PB&J. When we scooped into it,  it was so good. What we'd wanted after just having lunch at a different establishment. We might try BJ's again. Not sure if it will be the same location since we're from outta town."
Swathi O.,"Tampa, FL",4,12,20,5.0,6/21/2016,"I gave it a 5 Star for only two reasons.  Love the vegetarian Toppings on the Tavern cut as I m not at all a fan of Deep dish pizza.  Ask for -vegetarian toppings on Tavern Cut pizza and I m sure you won't regret, preferable to ask for additional toppings such as Jalapeños and Fiery Roast Bell Pepper which will blow your mind and give you a Lip Smacking experience :)  Second reason is ofcourse the Dessert!!! Haaaa.. Love the Cookies and cream Pizookie, but all the others are also amazing!  Also get the BJ's Rewards card.  I m sure you'll want to go back! :)"
Jody B.,"Port Richey, FL",11,5,2,2.0,2/5/2017,"Not a fan. Staff was nice but the restaurant was dirty. We went in on a Sunday afternoon, it was not busy. Waiter sat us at a table with black ants crawling all over it. Not just a few, but a lot. So we moved ourselves and let our waitress know when she came to take our order. She apologized and said she would let the manager know. The whole time we were there nobody came to take care of the ant issue. Also, I'm glad I ordered finger food because my silverware had food on it when I unrolled it from the napkin. Overall experience not good, overpriced for basically chain food. Will not be going back."
Stephanie M.,"Lutz, FL",0,11,10,5.0,8/7/2016,"We have never been to BJ's before and OH my goodness! SO happy we tried something different.  I got the portabella mushroom and asparagus starter salad which was fantastic. Goat cheese, cranberries and balsamic dressing and baby greens.  But even better - honey siracha Brussels sprouts. I am in my happy place. Many people don't like brussel sprouts, but try these. They are just awesome.  And their beer is great too."
Jasmine P.,"Tampa, FL",9,97,97,3.0,6/6/2016,"Food was ok, nothing out off the extraordinary, they can use a little more flavoring. Service was good and very convenient location since they are located inside the mall."
Sandy C.,"Webster, TX",144,63,190,5.0,9/22/2015,"Went here with the whole family on a football Sunday. The service was fast and food was great! Ambience was very fun and family friendly as well. We ordered the Brussel sprouts and calamari for appetizers. This was the first time I've ever seen my family fight over vegetables. We highly recommend the Brussel sprouts.  For main entree I got the lemon thyme chicken and for low carb option, I replaced rice with broccoli. It had great flavor, but was a bit salty for my taste."
Cassie R.,"Las Vegas, NV",246,122,3,2.0,2/16/2016,"Overall, the food was okay.  However, I highly doubt I would go back and this is the reason why... My husband and I went there with our family, and My father in law is allergic to garlic. We put this told the waiter this upon seating. My father in law ordered a flat bread, that came with garlic and again reiterated about being allergic to garlic and inquired that it be made without it. No problem. The waiter noted it, told the staff and all our dinners were made. Well, we all get our food, and we all proceeded to eat. However, within a minute or two the waiter came over to see if we needed anything and glanced at my father in laws food and noticed there was garlic on it. At this point, he had already started eating it!!!! Luckily he had only taken a bite and spit it out, and didn't end up having a reaction, and the waiter was proactive.  However.... This could have been much much worse. be very careful if your allergic to anything when going here."
Brian A.,"Tampa, FL",0,10,1,2.0,12/29/2016,"Go in to have a late lunch with family on Sunday. Hostess looses our name and seats everyone but us. She's says ""it was crazy for awhile"". Host runs over one of my sons on our way to the restroom. Restroom is flooded and very dirty, we both almost slip and fall. Finally get sat and 10 minutes to be greeted by server. We had to get our own silverware when entrees are delivered, never got the appetizer we ordered. Food was mediocre at best. Asked the manager what was going on, she checks the table once and offers a single dessert. She hides when she sees that we are leaving. First and last time eating at this so called restaurant!!! Visit was august 8th"
Keith R.,"Tampa, FL",18,16,180,1.0,5/2/2015,"Let's start by saying this was not necessarily the worst experience I've had, but it was disappointing enough that I will never go back.  Waiter - He seemed like a newbie. He didn't make or break our experience.  Drinks - Beer was good (Pirhana?), Margarita tasted like a Jose Cuervo bottled mix - no bueno.  Food - Our appetizer was the Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps. Too much of the wrong flavors - just didn't work. I ordered the New Orleans Jambalaya. Sausage was overcooked, chicken was chewy, rice was soggy. Fiancée ordered the Shrimp Scampi. It was okay if you like jarred garlic, twice frozen shrimp, and too much pasta on your plate.  Service/Cleanliness - Noticed residue on the silverware immediately upon sitting down. My fiancée got a glass of water after her margarita and it had once-powdered, crusted dishwasher residue chunks on the glass. All. Over. The. Glass. Appetizer was brought out with the entree with no rhyme or reason. Service was very slow. No sense of urgency whatsoever.  Altogether I probably could have had a better dining experience at TGIFridays - and let's just face it, that's sad."
Angela M.,"Sarasota, FL",0,23,5,1.0,6/15/2017,"Ok I just wanted to write another reveiew. The general manager happened to read my last review and was so kind to send me a gift card for the troubles we had. We went back tonight, but decided to go to a differnt, closer restaurant. Here is my full experience since this time I actually got to try the food. We started off with an appetizer of potatoe skins, which I must say are EXCELLENT. My fiance ordered a burger and fries with a side of cole slaw. Mind you that we did have to pay extra for the cole slaw ($3.95). I ordered a rack of ribs with a loaded baked potato and asparagus. ALL of the food was EXCELLENT! I mean it was darn good! But then, we were low on drinks. The server came by and asked if we needed refills, we said yes. A long time went by and we had to stop him and ask if we could get a refill. My fiance tasted the cole slaw and it was spicy, which was weird, so we asked the waiter if thats just their cole slaw, which he informed us they have 2 different types, a spicy one and one that is more of a classic cole slaw. He asked the waiter if we could trade the cole slaw, because we didn't know they had 2 kinds, and the waiter said yes. He came back a couple minutes later and set the new cole slaw down and walked away rather quickly. We looked and it was less than half of what we should have recieved. When we saw the waiter again he said ""oh they have to make more so i just gave you what was left"" and walked off like that is ok. What he should have done was said ""Hey, I'm sorry guys they didnt have quite enough would you like to wait and i can bring you out a little more"" that would have been perfectly exceptable. Oh! but it gets better folks! We asked for a manger, the manager comes and we told him everything. I don't typically make a big deal of things like this but $3.95 is a bit much for a small bowl of anything and to not get a full bowl kind of well pardon my language, sucks. So the manger kind of blew us off and acted like his server was justified for bringing us less than half a serving. My fiance asked if it would be acceptable for bringing someone a half a pizza, which the manager actually said ""well.....i dont think so"" OF COURSE NOT! It is so sad that the food at BJ's is AMAZING and I would LOVE to frequent the restaurant, but with the service the way it is, and at more than one location, I will not be back. What this place needs to do is clean house as far as their servers go, or a training camp. It is almost like they are afraid to come out and tell their guests ""hey we dont have what you want, would you like something else, or like to wait while we make it"" Customer service is not that hard to do, and this place could be a lot better with the proper training."
Cherri P.,"Tampa, FL",0,7,1,5.0,5/31/2017,Everything I have ordered here has been great. A huge menu with many choices. Love the California club sandwich. Avocado egg rolls. Mediterranean deep dish pizza. Bacon cheeseburger. And especially love their grilled cheese. Super cheesy on delicious buttery toasted bread!!!!
