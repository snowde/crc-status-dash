John L.,"Lutz, FL",36,193,380,4.0,1/4/2017,"This is my daughters favorite pizza. Me? well, its really good but not my fav. Atmosphere is so loud and crowded. I much prefer a quieter ambience. Prices are a little higher (hey you at the mall right?) Salads were good. I guess I would gave it three starts if not for my daughters input."
Pennie F.,"Tampa, FL",29,2,1,5.0,5/22/2016,"Great food! Great time always with Billie at the bar!! Great atmosphere, friendly staff,Billie is the best bartender in the business."
Stu M.,"Tampa, FL",0,3,,5.0,5/17/2017,"I have been a regular at BJs Citrus Park for several years. The food is outstanding and who can resist a pizookie! I frequently stop in for happy hour with my colleagues from work - all educators. We ALWAYS ask for Jessica. She is AWESOME! She provides excellent service with a sense of humor that is greatly appreciated. Honestly I would stop coming to BJs if she wasn't employed there. Jessica, you deserve a raise. You rock!!!"
Ameesh P.,"Tampa, FL",295,594,269,3.0,11/23/2014,"I've been to this location a couple of times and each time walk away with an average view.  On my most recent visit I decided to take my parents and nieces out for meal and given there were 2 children, their palates dictated the type of cuisine we chose and hence we ended up here.  The wait was pretty fast and we were seated at a very large booth.  The one thing I did like is that there are flat screen TV's everywhere and given that it was college football Saturday, it was great to be able to see a couple games and catch the highlights during the 2 hours we spent here. That sums up my experience.  A very regular meal ended up being a 2 hour affair.  The drink orders went in rather quickly and we had a server who advised she was in training so at first it was almost great having 2 people watching over our table as there was a mentor type person with her.  Once we placed our orders, however, we had a new server who must have been overloaded as he was pretty scarce after taking our orders.  I was also left without a beverage and never got  refill during the entire meal.   As far as food goes, we had a few sharers at our table who split a pizza that looked pretty good.  I had the jambalaya, which was overall pretty decent for a chain restaurant.  We did indulge in a pizookie, which is their version of a chocolate chip cookie made in a small pizza pan topped with ice cream.  That was probably the highlight of the entire experience."
Cat G.,"Greater Northdale, FL",25,183,127,2.0,12/19/2015,"Sadly, I have to lower my rating for my once favorite restaurant. Service has really gotten terrible. I have been there twice in last month and both times were borderline painful. The first time, about a month ago, there were 3 of us and the server couldn't even put our drink orders in; we sat for over 10 minutes until my friend went up to the bar to get our drinks.  The most recent visit (yesterday), I was there for our work holiday lunch so there were 12 of us. They gave us ONE server who got switched out halfway through. The server only took half of our orders and then we had to flag down a different server to get our server to take the rest. Our meals all came out at different times. Totally unacceptable.  I do not see myself returning here again. Truly disappointing that a once great restaurant has fallen so far."
Wayde P.,"Tampa, FL",53,60,79,5.0,9/5/2016,"It's been a few years since the last time i ate at BJ's. I had the pleasure of eating there for the 3rd time last night with my family. My most recent experience was without a doubt the best i've had at the restaurant. My party was seated promptly, the food was excellent and the service was fantastic.....BJ's menu is expansive... Almost overwhelming, but you can't be mad at choice. The varities of beer seemed endless (i tried the Nutty Brewnette). I enjoyed it. My wife and i ordered Chips and guac for an appetizer (amazing).... And i ordered their new Triple Decker deli sandwich (didn't regret that decision one bit).....As stated before, the service was great. Our server was very polite and perfectly attentive. My 2 yr old son threw his menu on the ground twice and other servers who passed by didnt hesitate to pick it up (they were very nice about it too). Wonderful experience overall at BJ's. Keep up the great work and hope to visit again soon."
Symone D.,"Orlando, FL",211,8,2,2.0,2/26/2016,"The food is pretty darn good, but don't EVER get take out here.  Every time I have called it's met with getting ""transferred"" to the take out counter 2 or 3 times. And to make it better after my second time of being transferred, I had my order taken, was told to wait 30 mins before picking up...I show up 45 mins later, go to the takeout counter and am told that I never ordered (until I showed that I had clearly called, and had her verify that it was their correct phone number). She then asked who I spoke to as she was the only one taking orders for the to-go counter (Well DUH...who do you think took my order and forgot about it?). At least she had common sense enough to ask if we wanted to put in another Pizza order, but wait another 30 mins? No thanks - I'll happily head to Westshore pizza where the food is less pricey, just as good and the service is monumentally better."
Mary E.,"Clearwater, FL",159,14,2,1.0,8/27/2016,"Waited over 30 minutes when hostess said 5 to 10 minute wait. The people who came in 10 minutes after us got seated before us because they complained about the wait. When we confronted the hostess she didn't apologize only asked our name. The managers only response was ""We will give you a free appetizer"" No apology from the hostess who screwed up or the manager."
Page H.,"Tampa, FL",39,76,103,4.0,7/23/2016,My girls and I love to go to BJ's! They have a wide variety of foods to chose from so even the picky eaters in my family can find something they like. The main thing I love about this place is they have so many really good deals. Ex- 1/2 price large pizza on Mondays. You can sign up to be a BJ's member and get deals emailed to you. ( I know what you are thinking..like I need one more thing to sign up for) but it is totally worth it! Today I got an amazing black and blue bacon burger and a free pizookie. Yum!
Riley L.,"Tampa, FL",0,408,585,4.0,6/29/2015,"Ordinarily I'd prefer to have a root canal than go to a mall. And I never figured I'd ever want to go to the mall just to eat...but this place isn't the horror show I usually expect. First of all, they have an extensive list of imported and craft beers and also a selection of preivate label draft brews of all different types. I don't believe they actually brew it themselves as they imply but wherever it's made, it is pretty good. I always order their ""Pirhana"" brew which is a hoppy drink like an IPA. The food is nothing very special but they do a real nice mini pizza. Ive had a few of them ranging from buffalo chicken too cheeseburger pie.  The other nice thing is that when my wife wants to go shopping she can just drop me off at BJ's and I can sit at the bar while she shops and when she finally comes back with all her packages we can relax in a comfortably booth and have dinner. She calls it the ""Husband Daycare Center"" where you can drop off your mate and they will care for him while you shop. It's a free service--you only pay for his drinks!"
Max H.,"Southbank, Jacksonville, FL",0,4,,5.0,5/26/2016,"BJs came to the rescue after an unpleasant sit down for food at the place we tried before. The bartender, Billie (sp?), was pleasant and makes a very good Mojito. She is someone who knows how to host a guest! The food was good too and they have a lot of gluten free options which my girlfriend loved. There is even a gluten free dessert called a ""pizzookie""... It is a GF cookie with ice cream.  Needless to say, we will be back. Thanks!"
Patrick C.,"Valrico, FL",0,9,,2.0,1/23/2016,"I usually like going to BJs due to their beer and pizookies. Normally I enjoys my visits the BJs in Pinellas Park or Countryside. However, this trip to the citrus park one is one of the worst experience with the franchise.  To begin with, the service that my group received was very sub par. For a group of 8, we were placed in a 2 sided booth that was very cramped and impractical. Eating properly was difficult let alone going to the bathroom. Secondly, our drinks came out very slowly. While I can understand this for cocktails, beers should not take that long at all. Lastly, our server did not get our dessert order correctly and did not stop by our table to check up until well after to deliver the check.  For a chain restaurant where food is not much better from it's contemporaries, service is what sets restaurants apart. BJs at Citrus park failed at this for me."
Kelleigh M.,"Tampa, FL",119,909,712,4.0,1/7/2013,"I've always been a fan of Bj's menu, especially their salads.  My go to has always been the BBQ chicken salad.  This one is different than most...they put tiny bits of jicama in it.  I'm not 100% sure what jicama is except that its a type of root vegetable.  It gives it a nice crisp texture-I love it. My latest trip to BJ's was for take out and I utilized their curb side Togo which was nice. There are 2 spots by the front that are available for curbside. Since my New Years resolution is to eat healthier when available, I decided to skip my go to (it has ranch dressing and crispy union straws) and I tried a salad off their new ""enlightened"" menu-basically everything is less than 575 calories.  I ordered the thai mango salad.  What a great choice-light, fresh and topped with a little avocado.  The best part-it also had jicama in it ;)"
Nor W.,"Tampa, FL",0,6,17,5.0,2/11/2017,"When I think of BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse, I think of the great customer service that Corey Murray exudes. He is the epitome of what you expect from a server. Very professional and always on point with our order.  Besides the food, he is the reason we frequent this location. Management and staff are always welcoming. This location is a must and should your dining include a night out where the food is great and the prices are reasonable, please ask for Corey!!"
Colin A.,"Tampa, FL",37,13,,1.0,7/12/2015,"Food is always decent but service is sketch and management is not with it. First off, the   tour is on when the John Deer Classic is playing. If you're not a golfer or care, that's fine, but a sports bar should have the correct tournament playing.  No one wants to watch the B team play when the A team is playing.  Second, no refills the entire time on drinks and when I ordered a medium rare Cheeseburger I got a burger that was burnt to hell.  Third, I asked for a side of chipotle aioli when my food was delivered  (which I asked for when ordering) and the woman rolled her eyes at me and had zero customer service when delivering it. Failing grade. Not coming back to this place. Ten Robin next door has a new customer as well as the food court.  Terrible."
Pamela R.,"Windermere, FL",41,8,3,5.0,6/7/2016,"Best spot to come for great food and drinks. Lots of variety to choose from for those who are veggies, vegans or meat lovers. Don't forget wine down Tuesday with half price wine glasses and bottles. All of this plus exceptional service by lovely Jessica who always brightens my visit. She is a gem and loves her job and it shows. Be sure and ask for her, but don't sit in my seat!"
Jenette S.,"Tampa, FL",97,179,341,3.0,5/22/2015,They have a vast selection of beers on draft. They staff is knowledgable and courteous. There are smaller food items to nibble on and then for the seriously hungry person there are 'entrees' that will definitely give you leftovers for the next day (or later that night). You CANNOT leave Without atleast trying the pizookies. If Desserts are your thing then that's reason alone to check them out. They have an awesome happy hour too had 2 FULL glasses of wine for $6. Can't beat that price!
Stephanie T.,"Tampa, FL",0,4,,5.0,12/27/2016,"BEST place, customer service EVER!!!! Gave us free chips and salsa cause one of our appetizer was taking longer to come out. Free flatbread/soup because they put the wrong order in so I can snack on it while waiting for my  ordered meal -so basically a whole compensated meal. LOVE this place!!!! The newly opened in Lutz, near Premium Outlet mall Wesley Chapel area!! Been here numerous times and have enjoyed excellent service each and every time!!!"
Casey S.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",61,20,130,2.0,7/5/2015,"Meh. This place is conveniently located next to a lot of stores. There's nothing special about the food, but the beer selection is nice."
Eric C.,"Wake Forest, NC",177,460,409,4.0,6/7/2014,"This is a great place to go to watch a ball game, have a cold beer and munch on appetizers with the family or the guys.  Not my #1 place to go, but they have real good food, servers are always on the money and the amount of TV's they have is second to none. I also go to this place every Father's Day to get the collectible glass (i have one for each year since 2008).  I recently took my grandson and future son-in-law there and we had a good time watching the Ray's game, eating and then having the well-known Pizookie (oreo is the best). I would definitely suggest this to anyone that's a beer drinker, likes sports or a foodie."
