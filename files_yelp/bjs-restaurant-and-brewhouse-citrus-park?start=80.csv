Mark H.,"Elfers, FL",61,1531,5405,3.0,2/12/2012,"This is one of those ""jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none"" type restaurants.  Nothing here is terrible, yet nothing is mind-blowing, slap-yo-momma good. If you want decent micro brew, edible burgers, pasta dishes, pizza, ribs, etc., this is the place to be.  I've been 3 or 4 times because of the menu variety, and there is something for everyone.  So now matter how picky the people in your party are, everyone should be pleased.   Best thing on the menu? The pazooki desserts.   As for service, it's consistently good."
Sean M.,"Tampa, FL",50,26,,5.0,4/24/2016,Outstanding food! Great craft beer options! Everything is priced well. Their chili is delicious and their deep dish pizza is amazing. The wait on busy nights never seem to be too long. Wait staff is very knowledgable and friendly
Jean K.,"Manhattan, NY",4,62,45,4.0,1/19/2016,"Eaten here a few times. Chipper service, extensive draft selection. Nice sports bar type food, but with a wider range of options. I have enjoyed each meal I've had here. A nice option if you want a casual meal with comfortable seating."
Randy G.,"Lutz, FL",4,285,366,4.0,1/26/2015,"Wife and I have been hmming and hawing about trying out this restaurant for quite some time now. Most places that have a huge menu selection usually only make avergae meals at best. BJ's is the exception instead of the norm. We started off with a pepperoni pizza dip and it was amazing. a plethora of cheeses and Marinara suace topped with small cubes of pepperoni and serves with small thin slices of garlic toast. The wife had parmesan crusted chicken that was so thin,tender, and definately crusty cheesy. I had the lasagna that was actually oversized raviolis filled with numerous cheeses and covered in a sauce and mozzarella cheese. Delicious. Now even after all of these great treats the dessert was the pinnacle of the meal. Salted caramel Pizzookie. Now a pizzookie is a 6' round deep dish pizza pan that they add cookie dough to the bottom of the pan then run it through the pizza oven, once on the other side, vanilla ice cream is added then toffee pieces, then caramel and chocolate sauce is drizzled over a shot of whipped cream. A perfect end to the meal. I washed all this down with thier made in house root beer that had hints of sasparilla and birch. Very refreshing and a great taste. Our Sever, James was very professional and very friendly, we will definately go back and ask for his table again. Now as for the atmosphere, its a sports bar environment so expect high levels of noise. The hard floors and shape of the dining area promote echoing and amplification of conversations but if you are a foodie, then the food always takes priority. This is worth a stop for sure."
Julie W.,"St. Petersburg, FL",26,24,13,5.0,6/13/2015,"Eaten there 4 times now.  Cajun pasta has been great and another time bland.  Servers are alway friendly.  Gets a little loud at night but a great place to watch a game.  Ravoli is good, linguini is a little bland for us.  We are use to food that has some spice to it, which is hard to find around Tampa. Love their spicy pig tavern pizza!"
Tavia H.,"Tampa, FL",41,6,1,5.0,5/10/2016,I love BJS Brewery at the Citrus Park Mall! I always get awesome service from everyone! My food is always tasty and timely and the atmosphere is fun and lively! I use their Reward card and get free pizookies and $off! Yesterday i went there for half off lg pizza and by paying on my BJS app i got to do this weeks special of getting a mini pizooki for $0.20!!!  And you can go shopping at the mall after or before...its a win win situation! !!
Beth B.,"Tampa, FL",30,31,,5.0,5/19/2015,"Fantastic restaurant inside of the Citrus Park Mall main entrance off Citrus Park Drive.  So convenient for lunch, happy hour with the friends (their happy hour deals ROCK during the week), and dinner/dessert before or after the movies and shopping. I love the service - every single time we have efficient and happy servers and bartenders.  The menu is so diverse - the selections can make any family of 4 or 6 or 8 (and beyond) happy! The kitchen puts out excellent flavors EVERY SINGLE VISIT!  I love that we can always count on having a GREAT meal - no matter the time of day. Management is very visible and helpful with staff (we witness the interaction) and visible with guests also."
Dianna B.,"Tarpon Springs, FL",847,2344,2388,3.0,2/9/2014,"The menu is huge. If you want -something- it's probably there. They really need to concentrate on one thing to be good at it.  For Lunch, I ordered an endless soup and salad combo.  The soup I ordered was the Chicken Tortilla soup, the way it was delivered was interesting. A big bowl, with a few scraps of avacodo, little bits of chicken and tortillas, and the broth was added at the table. It was a nice presentation, but the only thing was, with the bowl being so large, the soup cooled off -very- quickly.  And the Ceaser salad was way over dressed.  Our waitress was very friendly and accomodating. :)"
Aj W.,"Tampa, FL",4,87,5,5.0,2/14/2016,"So this review is going to be short, sweet and to the point. The food is good. The beer is better. The Pazookie is amazing. If you come to BJ's it is a must try. Don't leave regretting not getting one."
Rob L.,"Atlanta, GA",16,3,15,5.0,4/18/2015,Great food with an awesome wait staff.  Love the committed Double Ipa!   Thanks Kelsey  for your awesome service!
Duane T.,"Land O Lakes, FL",15,25,11,4.0,10/20/2014,"My in laws were in town and have liked BJ's in Arizona, so we tried it out last night to fit into our Sunday evening restaurant trials. I had chili breadbowl with caesar salad. It was very good, the breadbowl was uniquely toasted. I tried an 8-beer taste test flight.  It was ok, I don't typically like all the different beers at brewpubs so I just do a trial to sample it.  I was happy with that. We did the caramel pizookie for desert, that was pretty good as well.  I'd stop back and try a burger next time."
Hunter D.,"Tampa, FL",1,9,,2.0,10/8/2016,"I want to like this place, I really do. The food is good, the service lacks. Waiting 25 minutes for a table just to be sat in the entry way of the mall is a slap in the face. If anyone wanted to eat outside the restaurant in the mall, they'd go to the food court. Why even have these tables? Brings the whole vibe down."
Samantha D.,"Tampa, FL",92,143,41,4.0,12/12/2015,This is a good place for a nice reliable lunch during shopping or before a movie.  There are many healthy options with calorie counts.  The menu is diverse.  There is also good beer on tap.
Navyaa R.,"Detroit, MI",2,11,9,2.0,9/26/2015,I wanted to give 4 stars for the ambiance and service but for the food 2 stars are more than enough. I got badly smelled beans and undercooked rice. I have to think to visit again.
Meagan F.,"Tampa, FL",16,81,5,4.0,1/5/2015,"Great beer, good food that always tastes fresh, the staff is always nice and knowledgable about the beer. I appreciate that because I am a beer lover and sometimes I need to know specific things about what I'm going to drink so when I have questions they always answer. We've never had a bad experience, albeit one time the avocados in my egg rolls weren't ripe, but hey...they weren't in season. The staff was cool about that and took it away.  We frequent BJs at this location often. Oh and the bartenders are good too!"
Luis C.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,3,,3.0,1/10/2016,"I'll admit I didn't know what to expect from this place. Just having moved from the West Coast, my wife and I have been actively seeking out what Tampa has to offer in terms of casual hangouts with decent food & drink. The menu is eclectic & fairly health-conscious, and that plus NFL happy hour got us through the door. Unfortunately, our first impression wasn't so hot. We arrive, there's a wait. Totally understandable with it being a Saturday night. So we saunter on over to the bar thinking ""ok let's grab a few drinks while we wait, no biggie."" I sit myself down, make eye contact with the bartender, and I wait. And I wait. And I wait. And it really seemed like he did everything he could to help every single person around instead of me. Including several who arrived after me. I don't know if it was my face, what I was wearing, or if I reminded him of someone he hated in high school. But it was borderline hilarious; even the random people around me were making comments about how long it was taking. Literally 10 minutes I stood there being totally obvious about the fact I just wanted to buy a drink, and it's not as if the bar was overly busy. I'm not going to be rude to a bartender and start blurting things out or waving my hands around at them after we've already made eye contact a few times. Because of my profession - for better or worse - I've been in hundreds of bars & the cues are obvious. So finally, after about (no exaggeration) the 6th time he walked past to help someone that had arrived after me I blurted out ""you going to help me or what?"". He sighed really big, said ""what do you want man"", and I thought ""you know what, I don't really want a drink from you"" and walked away. It was just a weird interaction and borderline hostile. So after that awkwardness our party actually had a GREAT time. The food was pretty tasty for a chain type place, lots of good options. Calamari was yum, and the Jambalaya was decently spicy & flavored. Drinks were super cheap/strong, our service was attentive and perfect. Dessert was a 3-way pizzouki thing that got devoured in about 7 seconds flat. Even after being presented with a last-minute check split our server settled us up to a T. All the rest of the employees seemed super nice & everything seemed clean & well-presented. No complaints. I don't know if I'll be back, mainly because I don't want to see weirdo bartender again, but I can recommend this place to anyone that wants a fun, affordable night out with friends in a casual environment. Sometimes it only takes one bad apple to leave a bad impression... but your mileage may vary."
Matt B.,"Barrie, Canada",0,1,,5.0,2/24/2016,"It is a great place and I don't know why I don't come here more often! I will have to change that. Great atmosphere, great food and a great app for pre-ordering your food and even paying from your phone when you are ready to pay! No more waiting for a bill."
Sam J.,"Middleburg, FL",142,1,,5.0,5/21/2016,Food is consistent and the kitchen has an open mind and will adjust for you if you want (try the boneless wings tossed with buffalo and parm) Service is great and has a personal touch. Sit at the bar with Billie if you want a good time!
Fernando M.,"Tampa, FL",37,88,,4.0,9/6/2015,"Stopped by there on our way to the movies for a bite and drinks and we really liked it. They seem to have a nice selection of their ""own"" beers and I got to try 2 different IPA's and they all tasted good. My wife had wine after tasted a couple different options and the bartender was super nice to let her try it until she found the one. We had a flatbread app and it was good too. I plan to come back at some point to try more things but the overall experience was great."
Kristal C.,"Houston, TX",348,121,2,4.0,5/10/2014,"I like this location and I like BJ's a lot. Now you ask well if you liked it so much why not 5 stars, well i`ll explain why... The few times i`ve eaten there I was shopping in Citrus Park Mall as well so typically I had a meal by myself because honestly I don`t like mall food that much. But the few times i`ve gone I was always been forgotten about. I was always on a hunt to search for my server for something whether it was a drink refill or napkin or something. I don`t know if it was where I sat or if it was because I was by myself but it was something I definitely did not appreciate.  Food=5 Service=2"
