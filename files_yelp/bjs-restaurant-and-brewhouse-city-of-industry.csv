Ryan S.,"Los Angeles, CA",173,23,30,4.0,1/3/2018,"Visit: Wednesday, January 3, 2018 Dinner with a few friends. This is your typical BJ's: lots of TVs, lots of beers on the menu. We came in around 6 and there was no wait for a table. The menu showed Wednesday specials of $10 burgers with bottomless fries and $4 beers.  My friends all took advantage of the burger specials, while I had a chicken bacon ranch pizza. We also shared an order of the avocado egg rolls appetizer. The avocado egg rolls were very tasty, especially with the dipping sauce. My friends all enjoyed their burgers. The pizza was also very good--flavorful and generously topped. The only thing I would note is that the garlic flavor was almost overpowering; I bite into chunks of garlic and would ask them to hold the garlic next time. I ordered a large pizza, which was massive and would probably feed 3-4 people.  Service was great, our server checked in on us regularly, and drinks were refilled promptly.  A solid choice for beers and pizza. Will be coming back on game nights and whenever they're running specials. And probably other days too haha."
Wendy S.,"Walnut, CA",0,19,27,1.0,1/8/2018,"We've been here about 4 times now for their Prime Rib dinner special on Sundays. Regrettably to share except our 1st experience, rest were disappointments.  Not only our Prime Ribs weren't cooked right but for the last couple of times we've been here with our daughter they forgot to bring us our drinks and soups before our Prime Rib dishes.  I think this visit will be our last for their Prime Rib special. It is just not worth the price you pay to get it so inconsistent!"
Ronald B.,"West Covina, CA",31,31,12,5.0,11/14/2017,"I came here assuming I was going to get bad service and cold food like other BJ's that I have been to but this time was different. Joshua R.  (#157) was really polite and took his time with us. He understands the that the little things matter. He kept our Drinks filled, he asked us every so often if we needed help, he even asked us if the food was fine before leaving. The food was hot when it arrived and it was also delicious. That's honestly a first for me when going to a BJ's. This man deserves a raise or something because it showed that he cared and that made me realize that I will be coming back to this location even though I live about 40min away.  P.S - Anyone who wants to come to eat here should really ask for Joshua R. Before coming. You won't be disappointed."
Rebecca W.,"Rowland Heights, CA",327,227,434,4.0,10/5/2017,"EDDIE IS SO SWEET AND THE BEST SERVER EVER. Very chill and funny guy. Knows his drinks and great recommendations.  Food: tried the bison burger and I guess it's ok? Yes, the Pattie was juicy and med rare. So that was good. But the taste overall lacked a bit. There was a good kick. Instead, I tasted raw onion that kinda burned instead. The fries are good though! Crispy and yummy! Got to sample the beers and I think I like the one similar to Blue Moon the most.  Pizza was pretty good too!  Long Island was not as strong as I imagined...pretty light actually. I already drank this strawberry bj favorites and that was pretty good. On the sweet slushie side but again, not too strong. The margarita was stronger actually. I felt like the margarita was the strongest compared to all the other drinks I tried.     Service: like I mentioned, Eddie was great. Patient, nice,  and helpful. Good came out at a good speed as well. Thanks for the great night! Overall,  it was good. The wait was around 8 minutes? So not too long. Worth coming!"
Henry S. C.,"Upland, CA",4,4,1,1.0,1/5/2018,Ordered dinner for the kids and the Brussel sprout appetizer for myself. They felt because the dinner was being delivered that it was fine to send a completely burned dish you can barely tell the black plastic container from the actual green vege they so badly trashed it. Really low move on their part. So badly burned it wasn't remotely salvageable.
Angela T.,"El Monte, CA",211,316,183,2.0,11/8/2017,"Talk about snail paced over here..  Party of 6 for lunch and we arrived no later than 12:10pm. We ordered ahead of time on their app just so we can save a little bit of time, but nope. Not the case.  We were originally going to be seated at a really small table, but we wanted a larger table and the hostess offered to push two tables together for us (not very nicely, imo). We asked about the booth and we ended up getting seated there, but the hostess clearly showed on her face that she wasn't happy about having to move the menus, even though we told her we already ordered via the app.  Finally got greeted by our waiter and again had to tell them that we already ordered through the app. He jotted down the order/premiere card number and said he's going to get that started right away. We waited for a while and still nothing came. Because we're on a one hour lunch, we were short on time. At the about 12:35, we followed up on our order and was told he's checking up on it. Within 2 minutes, 4 of the 6 items showed up, but weren't hot. We had two lemon thyme chickens missing and followed up, but were told that ""it's being prepared"". About 2 minutes later, a woman who seemed like the manager came out with our food and said they were having ""system failures"" and the food had to be punched in manually after. Which means that they forgot our order initially... and probably forgot to bring out the food because the center of the chicken was warm.  The food itself was mediocre. The lemon thyme chicken was way too salty and the brown rice underneath was really soggy from either the veggies or whatever sauce they had from the chicken.   In the end, we did get a 20% off discount, but for majority of this, nobody really bothered to tell us what was going on and they were not very apologetic about it either."
Shannon H.,"Irvine, CA",337,113,212,1.0,9/25/2017,"Worst customer service ever. I had a gift card that my brother payed for and sent it to me via email. I ordered food thinking it was ok and could be used. The manager Shawn refused to take the gift card saying they do not accept gift cards without a pin. There was a pin on my gift card but he refused to take it. My brother took the online code gift card to BJs in his area and it was used without an issue. I have been a long time customer of BJs. My family loves it. However after this incident we will no longer be coming back. The manager was rude. I was very disappointed. The staff always follows the leadership. If they have such a rude leader, they will service clients in the same manner.  I will be getting in contact with corporate to discuss this issue considering this gift card was purchased from BJs. Do not come here if you want to have a nice family dinner where the manager actually does his job instead of making you more upset. I ended up not paying for the food because it was supposed to be charged to the gift card that my brother ordered up north. What a waste of time and food. This is the most disappointing interaction I have ever had with a manager at a large chain restaurant."
Joyce Y.,"Alhambra, CA",47,375,254,2.0,10/6/2017,"came for a coworkers farewell lunch i ordered the quinoa and added salmon.   came at normal lunch time (around noon) and it was pretty empty.  it took forever to get anything.  from our orders to the check.  started getting antsy we were waiting so long.  finally had to take matters into our own hands and someone from our party got up to track down somebody to give us our check.   foods a little overpriced, at least my salmon was.  probably wouldn't go again unless a coworker wanted to go. located in a mall plaza so parking a plenty."
Loretta C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3524,954,21679,3.0,3/20/2017,"This is an okay restaurant.  I have gone for coworker outings and both the food and service can be really inconsistent each time.  Sometimes the food is amazing and blows you away, but for the most part it is too salty.  For the customer service too, it feels very fake from the females versus the males. Over all, my go-to consistent items to get are the appetizers.  Other than that, the food is salty and drinks can get pricey: 1) Avocado Egg Rolls - This seems like something anyone can make themselves but they are so amazing!  Perfectly hot inside and crispy outside, they are fun to dip in the sweet tamarind sauce! 2) Best Beginnings Appetizer Combo - This has a little bit of everything, including Chips with Spinach and Artichoke Dip, Mozzarella Sticks, Avocado Egg Rolls and Boneless Wings.  I love trying each item with different sauces! 3) Crisp Potato Skins Platter - These are pretty delicious, mainly because I'm biased and love potatoes!"
Elizabeth K.,"Los Angeles, CA",400,470,817,4.0,6/7/2017,Good customer service! Nice and friendly as well! Constantly readily available to assist me during the visit!  The breakfast menu was decently priced! I got the scrambled egg with sourdough. The egg was a bit dry and the sourdough bread was super hard and not that chewy! I think all the food was overlooked to the max. Not that good for BJ quality.  Brunch cost approximately $10-12 bucks.  Seats are comfy.  Restrooms are clean for the most part!  Pizookies are bomb!
Cat Toast G.,"Rowland Heights, CA",142,168,39,2.0,11/11/2017,"Yeah veterans free beer was total hog wash n the server was rude about it. Could have at least said ""Sorry sir no beer I would like to personally thank u for your service""  nope! He was determined to be a prick to us all night.. He didnt get a tip... I hope being a brat was worth it.    Shoulda went to Applebee's. The manager there personally gives you your free beer and thanks you for your service.. The server came back and said that only Texas was participating... Really then why was it printed out on my receipt? We probably woulnt be back Ever the service there just sucks period..its been that way for the last 5 years."
Karen K.,"Alhambra, CA",601,639,607,3.0,7/29/2017,"There will always be a need for mediocre pan-American restaurants like BJ's.  They can cater to large groups, and a diversity of different dietary needs and tastes at a price that is reasonable.   I've been to this BJ's a few times throughout the course of my life, and it appears to be relatively consistent with the quality of most BJ's.  They were able to cater to a large group with relatively no hiccups.   I ordered the Sirloin Steak, medium, with a side of cauliflower and a side of brussel sprouts.  The Sirloin was a tad bit more medium well than medium, but it wasn't bad.  It was about a palm-sized, fat chunk of meat with no unpleasant bits of fat, or bone, or tough bits.  Although it didn't have much circumference, because of it's width, I surprisingly could not finish it by the time the rest of my coworkers were done with their meal.  It made it's way into my midnight snack itinerary.  It was very consistently meat, all the way through.  There was a rosy hue in the middle without a trace of blood.   The Siracha Brussel Sprouts, while not being the best brussel sprouts I've had at an establishment, were surprisingly good for BJ's.  There was plenty of it, and it was well cooked and flavorful, but not too spicy (if you are a light-weight).  This was my favorite part of my meal, and I will order it again.   The Curried Cauliflower wasn't as tasty.  They had a bit of curried flavor and lentil, but it overall did not match with any of the flavors on my plate, and were probably one of the more disappointing curried dishes I've tried in my life.  I make a better curried cauliflower and lentil at home.  I would pass on this side, especially considering it is a premium item, and costs a little bit extra.   I skipped on the pazookie, this time, but BJ's is known for it.  It is a thick, super sweet, monster sized cookie that was meant to be shared by at least 3 people.  (It is much too sweet for any less than 3, in my opinion.)"
Andy N.,"West Covina, CA",163,36,164,5.0,12/3/2017,"Bringing some friend here for lunch, love there pizzas, get you a lot of meat and veggies."
Angel P.,"Whittier, CA",0,20,12,2.0,11/22/2017,Nothing special here besides the desert. Appetizers tasted and looked like they were out of a frozen aisle at the grocery store and main course lacked flavor and everything was overpriced for the quality
Robin I.,"Fullerton, CA",12,93,245,3.0,10/13/2017,The food is ok. Got a small Sweet Pig Pizza with a Caesar salad and some Mozzarella Sticks. Also got a Monkey Bread Pizookie. The food was nothing special. The service was average and our waitress was not the greatest. But I got to have a nice date with my wife. Nice.
Cesar A.,"West Covina, CA",0,6,,1.0,12/21/2017,SERVICE SUCKS.......had not dined here in a long time for same reason. Came on a Thursday night place was not busy took them 10 minutes to sit us at a booth near restroom. Another 10 minutes before they came to ask us if we wanted drinks when I seemed frustrated manager came over tried to make things better even gave us free appetizer. Food was ok service was not next time I will just go to YARD HOUSE.
Rachel Q.,"Monterey Park, CA",879,1307,1913,4.0,1/27/2017,"I don't go to BJ's often but when I do, I really enjoy the pizza and the pazookie!  The beer selection is also very good and they have this new rewards app that gets you a free pazookie the first time you use it! The last time I came here it was Wine Tuesday! The brussell sprouts appetizer was delicious and crispy.  I also got the Ahi Tuna Salad, but it was a little fishy, but the waiter was happy to exchange it, which was nice.  And of course polished off the meal with a chocolate chip pazookie!  Staff is really friendly and helpful, and parking is easy. Overall a good experience."
Raina H.,"Walnut, CA",1131,93,282,4.0,8/8/2017,"Came here after downloading the online app that got us $10 off a $35 order and it was free pazookie day!! Everything was great, we got seated right away and our server was extremely friendly. I was treating my sister out for a birthday lunch and we were so excited because their menu was so extensive!  Their special on Wednesday was unlimited fries with their burgers! Only $10 such a great deal so that's what I opted for- to make our meal $35, my sister got the Mediterranean chicken tacos and sautéed kale and spinach with buffalo boneless chicken wings for an appetizer- everything tasted pretty good but what's bringing down the rating is the wings. They were extremely extremely dry and hard to eat, very tough, not worth getting at all in my opinion but everything else was delicious, my burgers, the fresh batches of fries that kept coming out everytime we finished -  My peach drink was also very good but the only thing that bothered me was they don't mix it well with the tea and I didn't know so I slurpee a ton of syrup on my first try. But the refills for my tea came out very fast, our server was extremely on point !  Overall is was a pleasant experience and I highly recommend getting their app if you ever feel like dining in, savings and earning points! :)"
Nancy S.,"Azusa, CA",32,118,70,4.0,12/14/2017,"Came in to celebrate with coworkers on a Thursday afternoon. We were a party of approximately 20 all paying with separate checks. Our sever was polite and attentive. I ordered the soup and salad lunch special with tortilla soup. It was really good. I was expecting the typical house salad of iceberg lettuce but it was as actually quite delicious. I did notice though that half of the table received their food much later than everyone else. That part was a little disappointing. Overall, the food and service were good and I'd come back again."
Dinasia W.,"Springfield Gardens, NY",9,67,111,5.0,9/2/2017,We stopped in BJs just to have a drink & some apps. We did just that. Tasty drinks ( pink Cadillac martini & peach margarita) we both had two. Not overly strong but very tasty. Nashville pepper wings (promotional) and crispy calamari. Both appetizers were good but the wings were GREAT. Not like typical chain restaurant wings. Our server was awesome ! Sorry I can't remember his name . I will revisit this location.  Btw we came on a Saturday around 6pm. Waited about 5-7minutes for a table. No complaints!
Jane R.,"Mission Viejo, CA",42,109,257,3.0,8/28/2016,"Just had lunch here, it was busy but not ridiculously so for the size of the venue. Perhaps they need more serving staff..  Despite having a reservation they still take a good ten minutes to show us to our table that is empty.. They seem to have a very slow way of seating everyone group by group in this laborious way Drinks orders were taken quickly but possibly because it then takes quite a while to get the food order in  **Free appetizer with Yelp check in! Potato Skins with Bacon and Cheese, a bit dry but not bad for free :p ** I had Salmon with Cous Cous, the sauce is very sweet but it was OK.. The salmon was nicely cooked. The asparagus is too thin to be pan fried/grilled it needs to be steamed or use the thicker style asparagus. It's like eating a dry plant  The server was polite and friendly for our table, prices are reasonable..  One last comment 'silver ware' normally means a knife and fork.. No one on our table received a knife apart from the one eating steak- too difficult to get any of the busy servers attention to ask for them!"
Jose P.,"Brea, CA",135,31,49,1.0,9/9/2017,"Late night atrocious ""snack""! Ordered the Peruvian quinoa shrimp: under cooked quinoa, salty shrimp, and too many sour tomatoes. Disappointed :( They don't have to-go cups for drinks :("
Alicia D.,"San Bernardino, CA",30,9,,3.0,11/18/2017,"Mozzarella sticks were cold. Never brought out our avocado wraps. Waiter took a while to come back and check on us..Ended up canceling the avocado wraps after we were done with our main course and they still hadn't brought them out. Other than that, the clam chowder was good and so was the pizza."
Monica S.,"San Dimas, CA",0,34,17,1.0,11/19/2017,"Ughhhh! Stopped by just for the Pizookie....didn't even get one because I was so irritated with our server Michelle.  She came back to our table once to check on us, ONCE! The restaurant wasn't crowded, so I don't know what was up! Plain ridiculous! I even had to pay up front because she never came back to pick up the bill! SMH!!!!"
Elle Y.,"San Francisco, CA",0,7,,4.0,8/30/2017,My brother and I came here after an exhausting day and it hit the spot. My bro enjoyed his California Club sandwich and I had the chicken caesar with chicken. The restaurant was the perfect amount of cool (not freezing and not stifling) for a 105 day in SoCal. I really wish I could remember our server's name (I didn't take the receipt with me). He was a sweetheart and so helpful.
Adriana O.,"Monrovia, CA",0,4,,5.0,11/19/2017,"Been coming here for a couple years now everything from food, service to cleanliness has always been great when I come by. Love this BJs and I will continue to come to this one!"
Alexander M.,"San Marino, CA",138,241,110,2.0,7/21/2017,"Ordered BJ's through DoorDash since I had guests over, the thin crust pizza must've been made by a BJ employee who didn't wear his glasses since the pizza was very oddly shaped and cut unusual. Thank goodness I had ordered the spaghetti with meatballs which made correctly."
Sue Y.,"Northwest Washington, Washington, DC",52,9,59,3.0,5/26/2017,"I come here for their special on Monday is half off pizza and Thursday is ribs.  I am a reward member and they give out tons of special deals. Sometimes free appetizer or BOGO deals. But their food sometimes is good and sometimes it comes out too salty and taste different. My overall experience is I only come when they run specials or deals. For their regular price, I can get much better food out there ."
Serena L.,"Bellevue, WA",43,256,1353,3.0,5/30/2016,"I got to try out Bj's for our company lunch. We started with the ""Best Beginnings Appetizer Combo"". This combo included four different appetizers; Spinach and Artichoke Dip, Mozzarella Sticks, Avocado Egg Rolls and Boneless Wings with choice of signature sauce or dry rub. The appetizer was just okay to me. I ordered their new ""Roasted Salmon Quinoa Bowl""; Roasted Atlantic salmon with sautéed red onions, mushrooms, fresh asparagus and fire-roasted red bell peppers served over quinoa and drizzled with soy ginger sauce. It was pretty healthy and yummy! At the end, we ordered a huge Pizookie as dessert! Warm cookie with cold icecream, what can be better than this?"
Melissa R.,"Whittier, CA",7,16,1,1.0,10/21/2017,"Stop using DoorDash they make an embarrassment out of your company. They take 2 hours to deliver your food, if the order is to small they'll accept the delivery but won't bring it. Your better than this terrible service that represents your company"
David B.,"Whittier, CA",20,6,5,3.0,9/10/2017,They have really institutionalized inefficiency here.  This time and last they served food without utensils and didn't provide them for 15 minutes.  We had to request additional salad dressing (the cesaer was very dry) 4 times... still no place settings.  They eventually come through but it is really annoying.
Carlos R.,"Baldwin Park, CA",31,3,3,1.0,10/6/2017,After an hour of being seated our appetizer has not made it to our table while other tables that got here after are already halfway of their food. Defiantly a let down and would reconsider this location. Hostess was terrible
Jennifer T.,"Glendale, CA",3,15,19,4.0,6/30/2017,I came out here with my homegirl on a Friday afternoon. BJ's pazookie and beers never fails. The staff was also very nice despite some minor tablet problems. Lol. I'll be back just because it's close to my homegirls house and it's a guaranteed tasty quick bite. Enjoy life. Share a Pazookie!
Mickie W.,"Temple City, CA",542,166,96,4.0,9/8/2016,"Our server Steven A. was great. We had a party of 20 and knowing how complicated it can be, he was was 100% respectful and made our dinner fly by even though the first server messed up on an item. Whenever I get BJ's I get their Deep Dish Pizza- California Supreme with a side salad. Pair it with either Calamari or Avocado Egg Roll and you'll be satisfied."
Vittal Kumar G.,"Coppell, TX",50,7,,4.0,11/25/2017,"Typical BJ's. Excellent ambience, great food and fast service. Always loved visiting this place. Good place to stop by for few drinks after work."
Gloria D.,"La Puente, CA",0,17,,3.0,9/24/2017,I haven't been here in a while. The food was good and flavorful.  I had the Brussel Sprout salad with chicken and my boyfriend had the Chicken Alfredo. The garlic  bread sucked.  The place wasn't even full and our waitress was rushing us. I had to tell her to please let us enjoy our lunch. I didn't like that.  Will not be returning anytime soon.
Allen F.,"Cerritos, CA",220,137,276,3.0,4/14/2017,"So the service was all squared away not that are server way bad but he was taking care of the whole bar seating you think some one would help the guy, but he was some how able to take care of every one in a timely manner.  As for the kitchen how is that you guys over cook the sampler player it was all over cooked the spinach dip, the avocado rolls an they skimmed out on the rolls as well on got one when your supper to get two then they cut them in half. Over cooked in a microwave. Some one i. The lichen dong know how to use a microwave or y'all need a new one. Thursday night an no rush at 10:00 come on BJs. No happy ending."
Elmen O.,"La Puente, CA",9,6,3,3.0,8/26/2017,"They used to be much better. For example, they used to have three items on their menu which they no longer have; one being the bacon cheeseburger pizza, second was there Derek Favorite Meat loaf sandwich, and the last but not least was these huge baked potatoes that had broccoli with Alfredo sauce and chicken. There service is mediocre."
Robert W.,"West Covina, CA",0,5,,1.0,11/13/2017,"I don't complain on Yelp, but there is a first for everything. Worst service ever!! My 12 year old has more intelligence and better people skills than the people that work here! I have had better service at McDonald's.."
Juan R.,"Monrovia, CA",0,11,4,1.0,7/11/2017,Server couldn't take an order for a pazookie correctly. Second time I get crappy service here. Never coming back.
