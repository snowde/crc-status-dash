Eri K.,"Irvine, CA",543,480,343,4.0,11/3/2011,"PROS: - Hostess in the front were pretty nice and efficient - The food came out pretty fast - We ordered the NEW crunchy Jalapeno burger that came with string fries. It was extremely delicious. The meat was meadium-well and was very juicy. It came with a good amount of fries with it. - Also had the ""small bites"" appetizers:    1) Spinach stuffed mushrooms: REALLY delicious and juicy    2) Mozarella and Tomato salad: delicious, crispy salad, *drools* - Ordered 2 handcrafted root beers...so delicious. It was nice and cold, fresh from the tap CONS: - Their service was OK. I've had better - Small booths for small parties. We were just party of 2 so we had to sit in small booths"
Mimi L.,"Torrance, CA",3209,1017,9804,4.0,4/12/2011,"#1 reason I go to BJ's? Piranha hoppy pale Ale!!!!! I can drink a pitcher by myself no kidding! I love Brewhouse, I am an Ale person!   They have good food too, I like ahi poke, chicken or shrimp lettuce wrap, seafood jambalaya, and they have good pizzas too, sometimes I go for a turkey burger, wash down with some Ale.... heaven!  They have good happy hour, all tab beer 1 dollar off, and discount on appetizers and mini pizzas . One of my favorite Brewhouse, and they have my favorite  Piranha!!! yummy! perfect for my usual Sunday beer day!"
Nicole T.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",0,7,,1.0,4/29/2016,"I tried to make reservations for a party of 6 for my daughter's birthday and they would not take a reservation.  The manager was not helpful at all!!  They have some type of ""call ahead"" system, but you could potentially still have to wait 30 minutes to an hour to be seated.  This process is ridiculous.  My family and I USED to eat here a lot, but not anymore.  Customer service sucks!!"
Clarissa P.,"La Habra, CA",30,5,,2.0,9/8/2015,I have been a customer of this restaurant since they opened a few years ago. I went yesterday and was surprised to find what appeared to be all new staff behind the bar and as wait staff. The service used to be incredibly good here but yesterday it was just plain bad. They brought salad but no silverware. I had to ask three times to get a fork. Getting a refill on ice tea was almost impossible. When the pizzookie came it was totally raw inside. I mentioned that to the waitress when she brought the bill ( I was still waiting for more ice tea which never came) and she said she would mention it to the manager to let him know.  I hope that this was just a case of them not having enough staff on duty for the Holiday but both the food and the service was really off compared to how it normally is.
Bxstr M.,"Walnut, CA",1,12,12,1.0,2/28/2016,The  feeling I get when ever I come here is they just want you to hurry up and eat and leave I spent 125 bucks today and I couldn't even enjoy my beer because every time I took a sip of my beer the waiter would come and ask me if I was ready to order  I wish they would take it easy and let people enjoy there evening
Isabelle C.,"Olympia, WA",3,88,12,1.0,6/30/2014,"I had a late night dinner~1 beer & Ahi Poke appetizer. I threw up after I got home... twice. and worse, I didn't even get my change back after I paid cash. This is BAD!  I was sick for 2 days after that! sent my comment to BJ's on-line and that branch manager sent me an email said he wants to talk to me again... for what? I emailed him and explained the same thing again and never got any response back since! VERY BAD!!!!!  So glad I cancelled a company party I was going to have it there.  My company switched our usual hang-out bar to somewhere else. My advice: don't expect a response from them if you get sick from eating their food!"
Patricia V.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",0,3,,2.0,10/7/2015,"I just got my lunch via take out. I ordered the santa fe salad and it was very small for a lunch salad too small for is being $14 . The salad was good but not good enough to be that pricey. If I knew it would be that small I would've gone to Chili's across the street. Their lunch salads are larger and less expensive.  Not only was the salad disappointing , I had ordered the peach berry tea and while driving back to work I took a sip and it was if I had just drank the peach syrup they put into the drink. I thought maybe I had to mix it. After mixing is it was still as if I had a cup full of syrup way too sweet. I even added a whole cup of water and it is still to sweet.  If I had time I would have driven back but I didn't."
Jeffrey C.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",212,116,48,5.0,10/23/2015,I think BJ's is a good one. The pizzas r good. The desserts r good. The rolls with the starters r good. There is a selection of pizzas at this restaurant.
Richard J.,"San Jose, CA",21,13,13,1.0,9/20/2015,"I used to love to come to this place, but just tonight the service is soo fucking bad, the server completely forgot our table, we need to asked another pass by server for our bill and box."

keith l.,"Anaheim, CA",2,20,1,1.0,9/5/2015,"I haven't written a review in a while, but with some time to kill and a recent poor experience i felt compelled to write.   Went to this location the other day with some friends for some pizza and wings.  I've been here several times and have noticed that the quality of the food and service continues to fall.   Ordered a couple pizzas, some pasta dishes, some wings and some pizookies.  What I noticed happened not once but several times throughout the night is that our waitstaff continued to say that they saw that our food had come out of the kitchen, but they didn't bring it to our table until 5-8 minutes afterwards.  This happened with our pizza, wings and pizookies.  Needless to say, the pizza was lukewarm.  It was cool enough that i could touch and hold the pan that the pizza had come in.  The wings were soggy, and for being ""XXX"" hot, barely had any flavor, in addition to being lukewarm.  i would venture to call the wings gross even.   And finally, the pizookies were tasty, but again it was evident that they were sitting out for a bit as the ice cream was runny and some serious ice runoff had begun.  The server gave the excuse that she saw the pizookies but wasn't notified to pick them up (whatever that means).   In any case, the poor service here is a sign of some serious management flaws.   Get your act together, BJs of Rowland Heights."
Edwin A.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,4,,1.0,8/5/2016,"this location is one of the worst customer service i have ever experience. the hostess werent much of a help and keep talking with each other instead of knowledge in the customer. then after 1hr late, we ask if the patio was an options when they should of told us since the beginning.  then we order appetizers and they havent even set up the places of utensils. over all the waiter (lawrence) was a good help and seen to try to be everywhere. i would not come back to this place due to bad,worst,and unprofessional customer service."
Joel B.,"Santa Ana, CA",6,55,,1.0,2/2/2016,I have been very pleased with the food at other BJs before but I had the BJs Brewery Burger today at this BJs  and it was absolutely terrible. It was so over cooked it was almost crispy. The fries were good but the burgers at fast food places are far better and much less expensive.
Tammy C.,"San Dimas, CA",309,468,878,1.0,7/11/2014,"Whenever a friend suggest going to BJ'S I am always in....pizookie on my mind. I usually go to the BJ's in Covina and Arcadia. However, my friend lives in Hacienda Heights, so we came to this location. We came at 12:30 and the parking lot was ridiculously filled. There is plenty of parking in the back, but I didn't feel safe having my car in such an isolated area, so we parked in the Golden Corral lot....sorry.  Luckily, my friend, got there before me and snagged a table. This is a small location and it was packed....mind you the world cup game was on. The waiter took our drink order............which took a loooooooooooooong time....perhaps because of the World Cup. We ordered an  appetizer, which was fine... the problem is when 2/3 people have been served lunch........and you are waiting........I told my friends to go ahead and eat, since their meals were warm. Both of my friends had completed their meal before mine finally came out. My friend asked for a 2nd bowl of soup.....by the time that came out...I was done. The waiter claims that they ran out of soup and had to make some more...not sure if that was true or he forgot. the fact that we sat next to their computer distracts them from us.... my opinion, because they just rush back and forth to that machine and miss what's right in front of them. I will always go back to BJ's for the pizookie.....probably not at this location."
Danny W.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",35,9,23,4.0,2/10/2016,"The BJs bar area has 3 big screen tvs and great to watch LA Lakers game on big screen tv.  Happy hour are Monday to Friday 3 to 7 pm with 1/2 off mini deep dish pizzas and $2 off shareable appetizers.  Bar area has round and rectangular tables with high chairs.  I also ordered BJ favorite mini deep dish pizza and the avocado guacamole and salsa chips and dip, which is Pretty Good new item! It wasn't very busy on Wednesday night.  Busier and packed on Friday nights.  Good location near the puente hills mall. Customer service is great with friendly attitude waiter with great service.  I would recommend this place to watch NBA games during happy hour!"
Michelle T.,"Torrance, CA",1662,1003,4594,4.0,8/15/2012,"HAPPY HOURS ARE: 3PM-7PM MON-FRI                                         10-12 SUN-THURS I rushed over here trying to make happy hour with my bestie and we got there around 6:30 and were told they dont' have happy hour until 10pm. I found out later that they DID have happy hour- so i am not sure what happened there! I also found out that our server told us some wrong info for their rewards program i inquired about also- hope they step things up with making things more consistent!!! We didn't have a problem at all with other things that many yelpers complained about- the horrible wait and the bad service. We were seated quickly and were acknowledged by our server promptly as well. I had been craving club sandwiches and i found one on the menu that had all my fave things. CHICKEN, AVOCADO AND BACON! The only thing tho is that the bread was really greasy. I have concluded that i love my Club from CA GRILL the best cuz their bread is plain and not greasy at all.  My friend got a pizza and a margarita and was satisfied. We were too stuffed to indulge in a pizookie. Overall we had a good time despite a couple of inconsistencies i found out later and it would have been nice to not have been given the bill to us when we weren't even half way done with our meal. (it was early evening still!).  Next time i will stick to the BJs in torrance and get my pizzookie!"
JK C.,"Malibu, CA",4,109,778,4.0,8/30/2013,"BJS is a very enjoyable restaurant to spend time with friends and family. Many people claim that this eatery is highly overpriced, yet I have a feeling many of these people have not even stepped foot into this establishment.  As a rewards member, you can always call in early and request to be in front of the line. Once you show up, you are quickly led to your booth and it is quite comfortable.  There is a certain vibe that is given off, from the multiple TVs to the bar, that certainly makes place great for a family dinner. The endless choices of appetizers are quite appealing, and extremely tasty. I personally love the avocado egg rolls and the potato skins.  I am definitely a fan and I will continue to come here in the future."
Mrs. G.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",0,8,,2.0,2/24/2016,"We eat here quite often but today had a terrible meal.  The brussells sprouts were burned beyond recognition and salted beyond belief, and we sent them back. The Fish and Chips were soggy, the fish was under-cooked and the plate was swimming in grease (the fries were OK).   My husbands salmon was over-cooked, however, he ate it anyway.  Although they took the brussells sprouts and fish & chips off our bill,  it ruined our lunch together and I hope that I don't become ill from what little of the greasy under-cooked fish I tasted."
Sonia M.,"La Puente, CA",3,13,43,4.0,11/25/2014,I've been here a couple of times. Honestly BJs beats any other chain restaurant on food & service.
