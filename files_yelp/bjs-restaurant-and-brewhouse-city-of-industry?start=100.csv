Curly C.,"Baldwin Park, CA",60,69,120,2.0,12/14/2016,Honestly we waited to long to be helped. And I got sick off the food ! I'll stick to the west co location !
Larry T.,"Covina, CA",78,87,1463,2.0,1/9/2016,I always don't like their food too salty Regular service with lots of people.... I just don't know why my mom always like to come over here  Bad food ...... Oh my I wish you never going to come back again
LINDA N.,"South Pasadena, CA",2,40,3,5.0,10/8/2016,"This review is strictly for take out. We were first greeted by a lovely young lady Celeste. She was smiling as she took our order. She was kind and genuine. You can tell she really likes her job! I've been to other BJ's and this is now my favorite! Also, we took advantage of the $10 off $35 which you can also use for take out. They just changed their menu and pricing so it's a little bit more pricy. On to the food:  Spicy chicken w soba noodles- Yumtastic!! Thyme Chicken w veggies- not bad Avocado egg rolls- creamy Delish, the sauce is a bit sweet but it complements the dish well. As I waited she went above and beyond for a hungry pregnant woman. She gave me some fresh piping hot bread to nosh on while I waited for the food. I also received some water and lemon which was perfect.  I love her!! Next time you feel like ordering in come and visit this BJ's and ask for Celeste. She will make your heart melt. What a sweetheart! It's nice to know there are still great people in the world."
Toke H.,"Montebello, CA",23,44,2,2.0,12/23/2016,"Really disappointed in the service tonight.  The wife and I wanted to have a nice holiday dinner...not happening.  Ordered some appetizers and main course, was enjoying my draft beer then BAM!  Our main course arrives...wait but what about our appetizers?  Not feeling it, my wife was hungry so she started eating hers.  I wasn't happy with it at all.  They then bring the appetizers but I decline it because that's a backwards meal service in my book.  Now, all I want to do is eat my meal and get out of there.  Really disappointed.  But hey they offered free desert, which we kindly declined.  The 2nd star is for the food which was good but it should go hand in hand with your mood, how can you enjoy food when your not happy about the whole situation.  I don't go out much but when I do, I  expect better restaurant fundamentals."
Nicolas R.,"Baldwin Park, CA",3,58,44,3.0,4/25/2016,Food was great. Service was bad.  Took about 15 minutes to get our beverages. The server barley checked up on my girlfriend and I.  Its a nice place. More working less talking with each other. They stay talking in a ball by the registers.
Bush L.,"La Puente, CA",0,11,,5.0,1/22/2017,"This place is awesome, its always packed n the seating wait is long but the service and food is great!! The servers come often and are very attentive to you!!!"
David V.,"Rowland Heights, CA",551,28,20,5.0,11/2/2016,"Brian and Angie are the absolute best bartenders. My wife and I always receive great service from them. They're personable, attentive and professional! Next time you're in the area, hit up the bar here. Ask for Brian or Angie and you'll be guaranteed some awesome service."
Chloe W.,"El Monte, CA",224,140,144,3.0,3/31/2016,"I thought BJ's is just okay. The food wasn't bad but it wasn't SOOO great. We got the Deep Dish BBQ Chicken and Fish & Chips, which was good. I really love the fries. The only complaint is that I wish their food was a little hotter, when our food came out it was just warm. The service was alright. Overall, the food is just okay while the prices are pretty high."
Arlene L.,"Rowland Heights, CA",5,22,7,1.0,3/15/2016,Just ordered Santa Fe egg rolls to go curb side and I'm very disappointed. The egg told are soft and wet from the garnish tomato and onions they put in the middle.  I would think they know that it will get soggy if it stay more than a couple of minutes on top of the egg rolls. I'm no chef but I know that.  I've ordered to go at different restaurants and they put things in the side to keep the dish at least presentable and not taong gross .  Big franchise should have good training on these kind of stuff.
Audra R.,"La Habra, CA",0,6,,1.0,8/28/2016,"Seated and ignored for 10 minutes!  Got up and left.  On our way out mentioned it to hostess and her response was ""Oh okay - Thank you"".  No I'm sorry- let me get the manager...nothing.  Server walked by several times not making eye contact, or acknowledging our existence with a "" be right back"" or anything.  My husband wanted to yell at someone but we needed to get home to our kids.....  This place is slower than heck during lunch...thought they would be better prepared for dinner......WRONG!"
Yohan S.,"Whittier, CA",0,24,,2.0,6/26/2017,Popular and reliably mediocre food like McD. Had small deep dish pizza; way too salty for entree. Better as reason to drink more beer than choice for dinner. Their clam chowder in bread bowl is really not worth ordering.  Better to stick with beer and pizookies.
Johnson K.,"West Covina, CA",77,318,170,2.0,1/15/2015,"Wow.. What happened BJ's Puente Hills? This location had always been my preferred location despite the fact that I am located right in between two of them.  Tonight's service by Shane was probably one of the worse I've experienced. First of all, the ribeyes we ordered were overcooked. Second, we were rarely checked on (our waters were empty for at least 15 mins before we were finally able to wave him down for refills). Finally, it must have took at least half an hour for the moment we flagged him down for the check to finally getting my signature signed on the line. Disappointing! I probably will give this place one more try for the benefit of my doubt before I officially take my business to BJ's West Covina!"
Donna S.,"Los Angeles, CA",234,443,531,4.0,2/25/2015,"This place is known for their pizza and beer. I loved getting the hand tossed pizza. When the pizza comes to your table,  the cheese is all melted, gooey, and just plain perfection. You have to eat it quick too while the pizza is nice and hot. Yuuuup!! It's THAT gooood... BUT they took it off the menu so you're out of luck. Are you crying a little inside? Yeah..me too...me tooo The second best choice is the deep dish pizza. I always get bjs favorite. It's a fav for a reason! Not as good as the hand tossed but it will do.  The avocado egg rolls on this visit were gross. It tasted old. Calamari was dry. Ahi tuna salad also tasted too fishy and old. These were the ""not getting ever again"" items. These were staples in the past but because of this one bad experience,  I won't be ordering them again. Chicken wings...i dont think you can mess this up..these were delicious as usual.  Pizooki - this is a baked cookie with ice cream on top.  One of the best creations ever. This should be devoured first so there's always room for dessert. :) I like the white chocolate macadamia nut with vanilla ice cream."
Vibiana R.,"Mira Loma, CA",1,9,,1.0,11/26/2016,Went in today with a party of 6 and it was empty took them 15 minutes to seat us.   When they finally came and took our order it took forever for it to come out.  Most places give the children their food first not here!!! They brought out all the food except for you daughters which was clam.chowder on a sourdough bread bowl.  Took them about 10 minutes to come over and ask how we were. When I reminded them about her order it took another 10 minutes to come out.  Needless p say my food was cold but them but I wasn't going to eat in front mf my daughter while she waited for her order.  I think our server completely forgot about her order   No apologies or anything!!
cheska s.,"San Diego, CA",0,3,1,1.0,5/9/2017,"My fiancé and I came in on a Monday night after I got off from work and we got the appetizer sampler and ordered Parmesan garlic wings with it. Upon our orders arrival, we noticed the wings were buffalo flavored and immediately told the server who brought it to us who said ""oh yeah, you ordered the garlic Parmesan!"" So he knew there was a mistake. He apologized and took it back, only to bring the SAME buffalo wings, mixed with a tiny bit of the garlic Parmesan sauce, which was GARBAGE. They probably thought we wouldn't notice, but we did, and it was gross. You could totally taste both flavors and it wasn't good at all. We notified our actual server who then apologized and said they'd make a new batch, and thanked him. The guy who brought out our new wings was the same guy who brought out the disgusting buffalo-Parmesan garlic wings and looked PISSED OFF coming back to us and just dropped off the plate at the end of our table without a single word. Step it up, BJs. It was 10:30pm on a Monday night, you ain't busy so there's no excuse. After a long day of work, I just wanted to eat and go home, so it was frustrating to have them make a mistake, then wait for it to be fixed. Only for them to half ass ""fixing"" their mistake and having to wait allllll over again. After all the waiting we had to do, we still had to pay full price for LOUSY kitchen service. Our actual server wasnt bad at all, given that it appeared he was working the bar area by himself. But unfortunately, this was not a pleasant experience and we probably won't be coming back here anymore."

Sheila N.,"Temple City, CA",57,2,,1.0,6/17/2016,"If I could give zero stars, this review would receive zero stars!! I booked an event here with 45 guests recently. The contract stated that alcohol war NOT included in the package. At the end of the night why was I given an alcohol bill of $300 dollars?!?!?! I had no choice but to pay it at that time as half the guests were already gone. The next day I spoke with the manager Steven who indicated that he would call me back in 2 days so that he could speak with the GM Debbie in order to come up with a solution. I had to call him back and his solution was to blame me for paying the bill!! Really??? Such poor customer service. Even the GM was suppose to call me back but nothing!! I will NEVER eat here and I will be telling ALL my friends and family to NEVER book an event here again!!"
Anthony R.,"Los Angeles, CA",134,20,16,1.0,10/1/2016,Absolutely horrible service never coming here again. We had a large party. And we had 3 servers who obviously did not communicate with each other. One of our tables got drinks with all their food. While the others got half their drinks. They messed up our orders. We got our desert before our salad and got our specialty drinks when we were almost done with our meals. Our server rarely came and checked on us. Absolutely horrible. The manager did comp us some food. But after everything it was not worth it. I know it was a big party bit thats no excuse. Will never come here again.
Small S.,"Rowland Heights, CA",7,6,,5.0,10/11/2016,Good staff great service. Beer is the best. Nice place to dine or grab a drink. Highly recommended... And also they found my phone and gave back to me.
Christy M.,"San Gabriel, CA",1021,356,4410,5.0,3/30/2014,"My boyfriend and I came here on a late Sunday night because we were both hungry and wanted something different from what we would normally eat. We waited in the front for a few minutes until someone finally tended to us and seated us.  Kayla was our server for the night and she was amazing. I've been to BJ's a few times before at different locations, and I've received good and bad service. But Kayla was refreshing to have; she was very sweet and attentive to us. She gave us recommendations, and told us about the specials the restaurant was having. My boyfriend decided on getting: Ahi Poke appetizer - $10.25 Small Great White Deep Dish Pizza - $15.25 Seared Ahi Salad - $14.95 No joke, our meal was huge. I really love how decadent and comforting their pizza is, so I only order pizza whenever I come here. I ordered the small so I could bring back left overs for my brother to eat, and have some for lunch the next day. My boyfriend has been hooked on Ahi Tuna for the past few months, so that's a perk for me too since I also like Tuna.  The Ahi Poke ($10.25) was good; poke tasted freshly tossed and didn't seem like it was sitting in the marinade for too long. The avocado chunks were huge, and they were the big haas avocados, so they tastes very rich and a perfect balance to the smooth texture of the tuna. It wasn't any special sashimi grade, considering that it's BJ's, but it was good. It was a pretty good portion of tuna, and it came with a side of 8 won ton chips.  The Small Great White Deep Dish Pizza ($15.25) was pretty good. I usually just get the combo, but the garlic was definitely savory. I was just expecting garlic seasoning on the pizza, but I saw some chunks integrated into the alfredo sauce in the pizza, so that was awesome. The toppings to pizza dough ratio wasn't well balanced in my personal opinion, but because the crust was sooo unbelievably buttery and flakey, I won't complain. I got more full from the dough itself than the overall meal. I ate about 2 slices and got full. My boyfriend really liked their alfredo sauce, so another perk! The Seared Ahi Salad ($14.95) was such a huge portion! It looked as if it as easily 2 salads in one. Personally, I'm too cheap to be spending $15 on a salad from BJ's, at that rate I would have just ordered a pizza. The seared ahi was just okay in my opinion. The texture itself was a bit mushy, so it wasn't as fresh as the poke earlier, but the overall dish was good. The dressing was delicious, however the salad itself was overdressed. The avocados, greens, and overall flavors were very generous and my boyfriend and I thought we could've just shared the salad and an appetizer and we would have been full already! We also signed up for their rewards programs, and I guess once you sign up it includes a free pizookie? This was actually the first time I went to BJ's and didn't get a pizookie because we were so full from the salad! I guess we'll save the freebie for another time :) Overall, we both had a great time at Bj's, and we left with way more food than we intended to. Kayla, you were great! She made us feel very welcomed, and our glasses were never left half empty.  We will definitely be back at this location."
