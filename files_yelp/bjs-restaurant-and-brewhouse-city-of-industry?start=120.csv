Brizylla A.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",2280,203,351,3.0,7/23/2013,"I came here to celebrate my birthday with some girlfriends and I was discouraged afterwards. The food isn't as great as everyone says because it really depends on what you order. The menu has a large selection with many choices of meals and drinks. If you get a pizza the portions are big obviously. However, my friend had a pork sandwich; the portion was small and we also saw it was a little raw. My other friend had a pasta and it was tiny but she said it tasted great. Attention from the server wasn't the best and she only came to us twice. It's as if we didn't exist. I do recommend going here if you want a FREE pizookie on your birthday. It's the only perks of it.  Other than that, I would suggest going somewhere with better prices and bigger portions like Olive Garden or Cheesecake Factory."
Cinde Q.,"Pico Rivera, CA",0,5,3,1.0,10/29/2016,Bad service from the waitresses and management. Everyone here is beyond rude. No customer service experience. Not sure why anything hasn't been done after reading ALL the bad reviews for the customer service and wait times. I love BJs but AVOID this location!!!!
Ana R.,"La Puente, CA",0,8,4,2.0,11/9/2016,"We have been to this place about 15 times this year.  It seems it gets worse every time. I used to like their pizzas, salads and appetizers. But it gets worse every time. Every time we wait longer and longer. This last time we waited for 35 minutes for our meals to arrive, my son fell asleep. Service wasn't bad this las time but the guys usually seem too busy. My steak was supposed to be cooked medium-well and it was burned in the outside and totally cooked in the inside. Our abocado in the bacon-avocado burger seemed old. Definitely not going back there. Attaching pictures..."
Gloria C.,"Irvine, CA",601,571,595,1.0,10/1/2014,"I've been to this BJ's many times and like many of the other BJ's out there, it's a well oiled machine. Standard decor, standard menu, standard food and standard service. I love the pizookie's here, love their enLIGHTened menu items such as the mahi mahi with rice, and adore their kale and brussel sprouts salad. I've had great servers, but also not so great, it just depends on the day.   Came here this past weekend and I stupidly left my wallet on the table.  I discovered this a few hours later, had a moment of intense panic when I looked in my purse and it wasn't there, and was so so relieved when I called BJ's and found out they had it.   Only sad thing is I had about $80 in cash in my wallet INCLUDING a sentimental $2 bill a deceased family member had given to me, and it was gone when they returned my wallet back to me.  I don't care so much about the $80, but did they really have to take the $2 too? It was tucked away in a different pocket of my multi-compartmental Kate Spade wallet so it was obvious someone had taken the time to sift through the contents of my wallet. While I appreciate that my server found my wallet, and saved me the hassle of getting new credit cards and driver licenses, to take a personal stand, I will never come back to this BJ's again."
Desiree L.,"Chino Hills, CA",7,80,48,1.0,3/25/2017,"Thursday night I went to this location and it started out fine. But as the night went on and more people came to join us for our going away get together for a great friend and coworker things started to deteriorate. We asked to have separate checks and for the first couple hours it was fine, then when our server was off, they could no longer give us separate checks.  One of our party waited 30 minutes for his drink, another was closed out then told they didn't pay and another was over charged 3 extra beers. Maybe your staff should be trained a little more or get more staff. Better yet we were told that we would either have to move inside if we could find tables or if we stay out side we would not be served because no one on the wait staff wanted to serve us. No one wanted to serve us I asked again to be clear and was told twice yes that is correct. If we were to be served at all then whatever tabs we had at the bar would be combined and we would no longer be able to pay separately. When some of my party who had tabs went to pay their bills, found that the bill had already combined and when the paid it remained on the combined bill. So, now your telling me that your computer system can't handle subtracting a payment or is it your wait staff that can't?  This coming from a manager also stating that his server was doing us a favor by giving us separate checks in the first place????? WTF!!!!!! If you don't want to serve paying customers on the patio after a certain hour, then don't offer to seat them at the patio. Seriously, if your under staffed say so.... we would have understood. We work in retail we understand being busy and understaffed. I would suggest if your mgt is  going to flat out lie to a customer come up with something better than our servers don't want to serve your party because it's too big. What a way to not get repeat business or a good tip. Doesn't you staff survive on their tips. I will no longer patron this location again that is for sure."
Eduardo B.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",0,14,,2.0,1/28/2016,"The waiters are usually pretty impersonal-able but the food is usually good.  I say usually because I had the worst dish I've ever had at a restaurant the last time I visited bjs. Do not have the deep dish ziti it was so small and had very little pasta. It was more like a tomato soup with some nasty ""cheese"" thing that was more like a cream. It was 10 noodles swimming in a orange mess."
Gigi g.,"Los Angeles, CA",201,60,26,1.0,3/11/2017,I hate writing a bad review.   This is about front of the house.. I don't know where to start. Maybe when  I walk in and hostess has her back against the host stand having a conversation with a coworker. Then we made eye contact only to finish the conversation. I walked to the bar area with my adult daughters. Note we are all in the food industry  and we know how corporate restaurant are run. I know that BJ have a standard of service. Saw nothing.  We didnt receive roll ups! We were using the bar nap for our drinks. WtF!  Or sever did not want to be there but talk to his friends at a different table. I didn't see a manager in site. No one touching tables let alone my server. What's going on here. I can here for great service but it was horrible tonight.  On a side note..Props to the kitchen. Bravo Pizza was on point and ticket times.  Runners ran food with acknowledgment and she refresh our table with plates and sliver.
Rachel M.,"Rosemead, CA",60,16,7,1.0,6/3/2016,"DISSATISFIED! Should have checked yelp first. Reviews were spot on. Arrived at 11:45 am. Seated very quickly. Server finally got to us at 12:10 appetizers got to us before the fountain drinks. Took 40 minutes to get food with half of it only arriving after I called the manager. Never received my grandson's rice and manager never came back to see if everything was taken care of. Eventually leaving the restaurant at 2:30! Be warned, make sure you are willing to spend 2hrs and 40mins for lunch and not receive a correct order."
Chloe H.,"Diamond Bar, CA",51,11,6,1.0,5/26/2016,"Crappy humans, bad service, rude to Asians. Seated people with more people than my group. Never coming back. Probably going to starve myself before I come here again. Ever. Do not come here I hope they get out of business. They make a really bad first impression."
Lauren V.,"Tujunga, CA",108,104,106,4.0,2/11/2016,I came here with my sister and a couple friends after a long day and their food hit the spot!  Our waiter was kind of slow but I totally understand because he was in training. (I worked in food service before so I know what it's like). Didn't really bother me. Another waitress was helping him out and the manager also helped us out.  We started off with appetizers. I love the avocado egg rolls! But I think Cheesecake Factory's are better. Ours were a little undercooked because the egg roll wrapper was kind of chewy. But I didn't care cuz I was hungry.  Then we got the Brussels sprouts with sriracha sauce. Oh. Em. Gee. This was probably the best Brussels sprouts I've ever had!!! Americas most hated vegetable-gotta try it! I love how crispy it was and the sauce-YUM!  I also got an alcoholic drink. I think it was the strawberry patch? It's just spiked strawberry lemonade. A little strong if you don't like strong fruity drinks.  My friend got the strawberry... Swirl? Strawberry splash? I think it was strawberry splash. It tastes and looks like a strawberry pina colada! I wish I would have gotten that instead. Oh well. Next time!  Overall our experience here was great! :)
Fred F.,"La Verne, CA",0,10,1,5.0,3/28/2017,We love coming here and Krystal the manager is great. She was very accomodating and always has a smile. Service is great. I have been to several other BJ'S but this place in Industry is by far the best.
Jennifer A.,"Walnut, CA",9,147,441,1.0,11/4/2015,"Came in for HH & was pretty empty around 6:15 pm on a week night. Sat down & waitress basically threw menu's on table without saying a word. Ok, that's fine, maybe she's having a bad day, whatever.  Wing's, Calamari, Chips & Queso were all average. Deep dish pizza is always good.  Came time to pay & I showed the $10 off $35 email coupon BJ's keeps spamming my email with and I was told, I couldn't use it because our tab was all HH items. Hmmm...really ? I've used these type of deals before on HH so either I got lucky (all the time) or she was just Sh*tting me. Fine print stated nothing about HH food, alcohol yes, but ok, unsubcribing and would rather eat Costco food court dinner next time. Much more friendlier there !"
May L.,"Pasadena, CA",50,93,14,1.0,12/22/2015,"My first server stepped out of the segregated south and treated us like second-class citizens. It wasn't busy and waiting ten minutes to be acknowledged seemed like an eternity. When he finally came to our table, he glared (yes! Death stare style) at us, without any glimmer of smile, introductions, apology for the delay and took our order in the most condescending tone. If we were out on the streets, a beat down would've ensued. That's the vibe we got at our table. Scary! Management finally sent me a new server. She was friendly but her runner nearly threw our plates down.  Wow! Their tantrums are far better than my kids' soap opera rage. Five stars for novella-show quality attitudes...In the service industry, it's an epic fail!  Management didn't offer any concessions when the bill came. Even complimentary iced teas on a $100 bill for lunch would've shown good faith.  Service should've been done right the first time. Considering the surreal nature of the poor service, it's a negative 5 stars. Manager switched our server, who turns out friendly. 4 stars. Average the two: 1 star  Although smart establishments would go out of their way to ""take care"" of their customers, lack of concessions are not within norm of any dining experience. If it is part of a restaurant grade, this review would downgrade to a negative star rating. The food was mediocre, at best. My favorite item is discontinued: basil tomato pasta. The calamari was skimpy and the rib eye was charred on the outside. Real chefs know the difference between burning the outside of a steak versus properly searing it. You can tell it didn't rest in room temperature and was thrown on the grill half frozen. The rice pilaf was still hard and 1/2 cooked. My soup arrived lukewarm. The burgers were haphazardly stacked together and the patty was not seasoned at all. That's a sign of complacent standards in the kitchen. Taste in my mouth: meh"
Leslie M.,"Homeland, CA",0,3,,1.0,10/2/2016,Bjs is my favorite restaurant I go at least 3 times a month.It wasn't a very busy Saturday night there was no reason for the food to have taken as long as it did and when it did come out one plate had hair. The service wasn't bad but I've never had bad service at a BJs. This BjS needs some improvement. They didn't even add my points to my reward card and we had to pay for the hairy plate...
Connie Z.,"Rowland Heights, CA",384,14,13,1.0,10/18/2014,"First I have to say this place's food is delicious.  The reason I give it a 1 star though is for the service. HORRIBLE, RACIST, NEGLECTED I walked in seeing the receptionist giving me the ""whatever"" attitude then my waitress waited me very VERY impatiently. I felt like I was being questioned as a suspect. I ordered their wonderful dessert thinking it would come last cause it's common sense, right? But it came before everything else and I asked to put it last. Guess what? My waitress swoops in arguing and questioning me, somewhat forcing me to either have the dessert or get charged double to make a fresh one. Then she gave me the ""sucks to suck"" attitude. My question is what did I ever do to her to deserve this?! I'm just trying to celebrate and now I feel like I'm in prison. Thanks BJ's. Tip for you waiters in BJ's: YOU DO NOT TELL YOUR CUSTOMERS WHAT TO DO."
Reyna M.,"West Covina, CA",140,11,1,1.0,9/25/2016,"Got my order wrong. After they fixed it, I only got my food after my date was done eating, so I took it to go. Pizza was undercooked and 99% bread with hardly any cheese or toppings. Bummer"
Cherrie W.,"Westchester / LAX, Los Angeles, CA",0,13,5,1.0,6/21/2016,"Worst place ever. During a busy lunch hour, we had to wait an hour an half for our food. We ended up having it to go because it was past our lunch break. We saw so many people who came after us got their food, which was the same food. I don't want to point out names but Michelle was our server. She gave us attitude and just gave us excuses of why our food wasn't coming. I am never coming back again"
Kelvin R.,"Anaheim, CA",43,24,20,4.0,9/13/2015,I came in tonight with my girlfriend for dinner.  Was seated and when our server( Kailia I belive this was her name) she came up to our table and introduce herself and before anything else she looked at me and thanked me for my military service.    I got to say it was one of the nicest and most sincere thanks I've heard in a long while.  I almost choked up because of how she said it.   She told me that her father was in the Army and that she has so much respect for the veterans. ... I want management to thank her for making my dinner experience spot on.
Roman A.,"Montclair, CA",40,46,19,2.0,5/11/2016,"Went in for late dinner, self seating in the bar area cause the rest of the restaurant is closed. Funny go in at 10:55pm and they they close at 12:00am and the regular seating is ""closed"". So it's self seating and first come first serve. I walk up to a table (booth) that just was finished being cleaned  and the little host girl tells me that it is for other guests, I look at her and say first come? She tells me that they were waiting for that booth. They were sitting at a high table eating all ready. Poor decision to close the rest of the restaurant. We left and will not return."
Grace C.,"San Diego, CA",66,194,273,2.0,11/22/2015,"Chain restaurants are great sometimes. You know what to expect when you walk in - no surprises with food quality or service. And this BJ's offered just that. I was able to get a table easily during dinner time on a Sunday night while I waited for the rest of my party to arrive. Our server seemed a bit annoyed with us because she had to come back twice to get our order (first time we weren't ready, then there was about 10-15min wait time before she came back). Attitude was lukewarm and deadpan the entire time. Oh well. Food was decent - I ordered lemon chicken and there was way too much lemon over my meat, and my dish was incredibly salty. Their in-house root beer was rather flat and soft, so root beer lovers beware! Eh, it's not like I'll never go back to a BJs, but like I said, you kind of know the mediocrity you get yourself into when you step indoors."
