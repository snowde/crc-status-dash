M K.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",0,4,,1.0,9/1/2016,"Very poor service, we left Chilly from having a bad experience, but this location isn't any better.  The manager working eating at one of the tables, she made a few passes in front of us, we did make eye contact but no greet from the manager, knowing we are looking for our waiter.... We been here a few times in the past, service before has always been pretty good for us.  We final ask the manager to assist, she bring us the bill, and goes back to her table to do work and eat, again no waiter or waitress to be seen for well over 15 mins. Manager needs to be coached and re-focus, set the example for the staff on the floor.  Majority of the waiter and waitress are in the back, and there are very little customers in the building.   The host was great, she very happy jolly personality, also the bar tender seems to be pretty active, otherwise everyone hanging out in the back. Poor service will result unwanted customers wanting to return."
E S.,"Whittier, CA",1,78,,4.0,2/21/2017,"We had a party of 20 people and I had to make my reservations the same day. They gave me the run around over the phone. After speaking with the manager we finally worked it out. It was on a weekday so I do not believe they were very busy. Once we arrived they seated us quickly. Took our orders quickly and were very pleasant. I am giving four stars only because the food came out sooo slowly! Once it did arrive everyone seemed happy with their orders. Another plus, they allowed us separate checks. That made it so much easier. I will go back eventually but not going to rush my return."
Lucy S.,"La Puente, CA",4,7,,4.0,2/20/2016,Came Friday night and we got seated right away. Atmosphere was chill and this place looks really nice inside.  Service was on point. He came often to see if we needed anything.  I ordered the Ziti wich is new on the menu. I would come here again!  Not sure what all the negative comments are about but this place had better service then some spots around that area.
Hilda Q.,"Pico Rivera, CA",1,6,3,5.0,9/18/2016,Good service and good atmosphere I really loved the fried calamari and the artichoke and spinach dip I'll defenitly be coming back for more
Grace C.,"Anaheim, CA",50,843,1158,4.0,11/20/2014,"Been to a good number of BJ's.  All have been fairly consistent, and this City of Industry one is no exception.   Came over here because our strict diet means we need a restaurant where they have a very broad selection of menu items that we can choose from.  I ordered a salad, while the hubby got a burger.  Both very good, both very savory. Service was very good.  Had no issues, as our server had a LOT of tables he was dealing with.  Yet he was able to get to us in a fairly timely manner considering he was having his hands full.  It was a very busy Sunday, so we weren't surprised on the wait times.   May be back.  Good number of restaurants in the Puente Hills area, and this will be a possible option for us if we're in the area.   Their loyalty program seems interesting.  Already signed up, but we'll see how it turns out."
Liz C.,"Santa Clara, CA",428,506,2328,5.0,9/12/2013,"Came here for a late night dinner. It closes at midnight on Thursday.  The server and waiters are all very nice and friendly. The place is dim and has lots of choices on the menu. I like how they have a ""light"" section for those who are watching their calories. I got the salmon from the light section. It tasted great and also had perfectly cooked couscous. My boyfriend got spaghetti and meatballs and he thought it tasted great.  Overall, great place and if you want a sweet dessert, definitely go for the pizookies!"
Jessica A.,"Azusa, CA",0,38,24,5.0,8/20/2016,"Great place. I got signed up for a rewards with Carla. Honestly she was an amazing waitress, made sure our drinks were full and made sure we had the best service. A week ago we were there and we had a rude waitress, but Carla changed our minds to keep coming back to this location. Super polite and nice."
Willy M.,"Seattle, WA",379,735,1493,3.0,10/15/2014,"Was in town for work and my coworker has never been and he isnt too adventurous of an eater so we decided that this would fit him with some bar food, burgers, beers and it would be safe bet since its a chain type place.  Nice looking place, a lot of tables, huge screens to watch sports on and nice environment.  We actually came here twice during our work visit to the area. From those days we ordered burgers (black & bleu, BJ smokehouse, cheese burger) pizzas, fish tacos and some stuffed mushroom apps. Burgers were cooked decently but nothing to send back, pizza looked tasty and no complaints there.  Fish tacos was seasoned nicely too. I like that you can choose from thin cut fries or potato wedges ( we call them JoJo's in Seattle area).   A few recommended beers and we were good to go!  Service is fine, I can tell they were a little stressed out since I think the amount of staff is limited and they have a lot of tables to cover.  We didnt have any issues the 2 nights we went there.   A pretty decent place despite some of the other review, our wallets weren't stolen, I kind of hoped my rental car would've been so I can get a new rental because that was a piece of crap!  (unrelated rant) Happy BJ'n!!!"
Buzzin Around Town I.,"Fontana, CA",0,41,47,1.0,7/29/2016,AWFUL SERVICE- NOT EVEN DESERVING OF A STAR!!! Lunch service is extremely slow and unhelpful! Waitress had an attitude and the manager Kayla was not helpful to accommodate picking up the slack for Michelle H. took over 45min to get salads to the table before our entree! Spoke to manager to help and took an additional 15 min to bring boxed entree. Tickets would not be accommodated since Kayla complained we were an error/hassle for their system for ORDERING FOOD AHEAD to avoid being delayed! STAY AWAY
Steve F.,"San Diego, CA",917,1167,5947,2.0,2/19/2013,"Over the weekend, I had told my girlfriend about Golden Corral.  But, after seeing the line there go out the door and around the parking lot, we decided to try BJ's nearby.  And apparently we weren't the only ones - we noticed a steady stream of customers coming in after us. The first sign that we may have made a bad call was when we gave our name to the servers for a 10-minute wait... and after seeing everyone else's names called that were after us, we asked to see if we'd been skipped.  Their response: ""Oh, we called your name sometime ago.""  Um, we were in the lobby next to the desk - we WOULD have heard it. The second bad sign was with my order.  While Kathy's California Burger and my Jalapeno Burger turned out ok (along with the fried artichoke hearts), I had asked for the skinny fries - and I got the potato wedges instead.   Don't get me wrong - the burgers were very filling (if not overpriced).  But while your orders come out quickly, the service at BJs leaves much to be desired.  In fact, one could say that we didn't get a happy ending from this BJ's!"
Eileen H.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",0,3,1,1.0,2/19/2017,Was overcharged three times the amount of my original bill and managers answer for this is oh just wait 3 days and you'll get credited this happens all the time I waited more than three days called it in again and they told me to wait another 3 days for a return for their mistake like I was the one doing something wrong! Never returning to this bjs ever! customer service sucks
Michael F.,"Covina, CA",194,22,8,1.0,8/9/2016,The food was mediocre. The service was not great. Drinks were only refilled once and our server would disappear. It's also kind of sad when a business encourages being able to pay through an app to avoid the wait to pay.
Andrea P.,"Brea, CA",125,33,,1.0,7/10/2016,This place took a ridiculous amount of time. Our first server took so long just to take our water order and the second server would NEVER check on us. The food was taking an extremely long time and he would walk by so quickly or just not look our way to not deal with us. I am not exaggerating when I say I was here for almost 3 hours just to eat lunch. They should never take this long and I will never be back at this BJs and will warn friends and family before they come here too.
Shadi B.,"La Puente, CA",0,9,3,1.0,5/3/2016,"This BJ's location is one of the worst locations I've ever been to. The employees are extremely rude and inconsiderate of others. It always takes forever to receive my order and when I need something on the side or a refill on my drink I have to wait forever. Regardless if the place is busy or not it still takes forever. Also, I always hear the employees complaining about their job in front of customers. Who ever the manager is needs to really look into who they are hiring because the staff is AWFUL. BUT, the dishes are ALWAYS clean. So gold stars for the dish line! Everyone else.... No comment."
Monica M.,"Pomona, CA",0,4,,1.0,8/4/2016,Come here maybe once every 2 months mainly for the food because I've had more bad than good experiences with the service . I'm a server so I know how things go but Lawrence and Marvin are horrible servers. Both were rude and lacked attentiveness.
Kevin C.,"Rowland Heights, CA",26,3,12,3.0,7/8/2015,"I give three stars only because the food was ok tonight!!!!!!! Where all the serivcer???????????? I put up my hand for 30secs,the serivcer didn't come,the hostess came.....I mean u guys talk to each other doesn't bring u guys more tips!!!!!!"
Ter R.,"Baldwin Park, CA",0,9,,1.0,6/28/2015,Garbage service.  We didn't even stay for the food.   In fact we never saw a waiter/waitress the entire time we waited to be attended to.   Came in on a Sunday right before noon.   Sat down and watched as people who had arrived after us placed their orders in a decent amount of time.   Walked up  and let the hostess know we had been waiting for someone to come take our order for over 20 minutes.   She just looked at me and said she was sorry as we walked out.   This place can take its SORRY and shove it.
Tiffany M.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,37,2,5.0,10/20/2016,Visited on a Thursday night. The baseball game was on and the restaurant was busy and short staffed. Steven the manager came through and was helping deliver food and take drink orders. He showed that he truly cares about his patrons.
Anthony P.,"Brea, CA",22,287,238,4.0,9/6/2015,"I come here for the pizzookie: an outrageous dessert of a large, warm cookie (chocolate chip, my fav) and vanilla ice cream. Don't get me wrong, there are other good combinations of cookies and ice cream, but this one is my favorite. As a brew house, they have good sampler sets and the appetizers are filling. For this review, it was all about the pizzookie..."
Chris Z.,"La Puente, CA",0,22,,1.0,8/13/2016,"This one star rating is not a reflection of the food or our server but the staff we encountered AFTER the meal. After leaving this location it was discovered a set of keys were left behind by my mother. She had taken them out of her purse and set them on the seat to put on her glasses and forgot to pick them up.  So I drove back and went to up to the three hostesses and explained I had just dined there about 20 minutes ago and keys were left behind. I pointed out the booth and asked if they could look as it was now occupied. The hostess left and returned about 5-10 minutes later and said ""no one found the keys .. leave your name and number"". I asked once again if they could simply look on the floor of the booth. She simply repeated to leave my name and number. No one would simply take a moment to look under the table !! disgusted I left doubt I will visit this location again.  Called and asked for a manager - someone named Crystal gave me the usual "" we will talk to them about this"" brush off."
