Matthew z.,"Diamond Bar, CA",330,144,41,3.0,10/3/2015,Consistent with a corporate chain trying to increase prices to increase margins. Don't expect anything special just mehhhhh. Passing time while I go to a wedding ceremony. Appetizers are alright but they have beer so that's all gravy!
CeeJay B.,"Diamond Bar, CA",15,28,6,3.0,10/24/2014,"This location is not to far from the office, and the online ordering makes it a lot easier. Reason I have it three stars: -1 star: I ordered a medium burger and received a well done, charred and burnt tasting burger -1 star: an item I ordered was incomplete, missing their sauce. Not to mention, it was very messy like they were in a rush However, I appreciate how the manger, Melissa, who handled the situation. I came back to work to discover my over cooked order and called them right away. She was very nice and respectful and was able to accommodate a refund my mailing a Gift card back since i could not return back to the restaurant."
Lily L.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",0,2,,2.0,7/24/2016,The food was not great. The service was worse. The waiter was helpful when we walk in but he disappeared and another waiter gave us the bill but it was the wrong bill. This is the second time we had poor service and for sure not coming back to this place.
Reezs B.,"Rowland Heights, CA",35,3,4,1.0,6/23/2015,"There's really no need to write a review about the food at this place.  I'm only writing this review because the service here is terrible.  Came here and got attitude from the host and the other host who walked us to our table. The girl slammed the menu and the seats. We hoped to get a more decent service from our server, but he was just as bad. Very rude to our party and did not have a smile on his face until he realized he knew one of the guys in our party.  That didn't change his service though. He said something like, ""yeah I'm here to serve you but ask me a  question and I'll tell you straight up!"" in such a rude way.  We didn't bother to even ask for a manager because we figured management is probably just as bad if the whole crew is bad so we just left."
Zahra B.,"Los Angeles, CA",86,35,32,4.0,7/6/2014,Its my third  time experience BJ's restaurant. I always come here when I am on my way to Vegas. I always order crispy fried artichokes and spinach Stuffed Mushroom for appetizer  which is great. Today I order Lemon Thyme Chicken lunch portion. It was perfect. Herb-roasted chicken breast over brown rice in lemon thyme sauce. I LOVE IT ! Service is very good today :)
Nicolas S.,"Rowland Heights, CA",72,41,37,3.0,11/1/2014,Our waiter was very nice especially on a weekday at the end of the day. I ordered the classic rib eye and it was delicious! Our waiter did seem tired but he still tried his best to be nice to us.  The food is great but service could use a bit more help to perfect things. I don't care how fast my food gets to my table but I do care about how nice my waiter is. Overall I've heard mixed things about this place but one reoccurring thing is the service.
Felicia M.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",605,268,842,4.0,2/9/2014,"This is my go to place for happy hour drinks and snacks. I have to say, when it was first built it was not that good. Once they got their stoves broken and and left over grease on the pans it was much better.  I am going to review on the happy hour experience that I often have here at BJs. It is from 3-7 and 10 to close Sunday through Thursday. The bar area is good size so I never have problems finding a seat. The staff is always nice but changes throughout your meal for some reason so you may have more that one server.  Now for the good part, the food and drink.  I have had chicken club flatbread, bruschetta, sliders, spinach dip and avocado egg rolls. No, no not all at once but maybe once day. All of the items I listed are very good. I recommend the flatbread and the bruschetta. They are very lite and refreshing, not too heavy so you can still get your buzz on. They have $4 beer and $6 wines which include La Creama Pinot Noir, one of my go to wines.  Sports are always on and on huge TVs over the bar. The crowd is a mix so no weird age group thing going on there.  All in all I think it's a really good place for what it is and I recommend it to all happy hour goers! Right behind the puente hills mall on the movies side, plenty of parking and walking distance from target. C'mon if that doesn't do it for you than I don't know what will."
Kyle P.,"West Covina, CA",2,20,11,5.0,10/18/2014,"I WENT TO THE BAR ONLY, great service! Great beer and good place for a date. Reccomend all day. Time to get messed up"
Nicole I.,"Covina, CA",159,18,3,1.0,11/7/2016,"Note to BJ's: when every single one of your chain restaurant locations garners the same 3-Star rating on Yelp, it's probably time to re-think your business plan. My boyfriend and I chose to visit on a Sunday night after both of us had worked long, hard shifts in the customer service industry. We were looking forward to a nice meal but unfortunately this was denied us by our terribly rude server, who will from this point forward be referred to as Man Bun. Our appetizer and waters were delivered in a timely manner but everything else just plummeted from there. Man Bun treated us like we were an inconvenience and didn't seem to care about doing his job. Our drinks took about an hour to be brought to our table, even though I could plainly see my drink sitting there getting warm as our booth was less than ten feet from the bar. No silverware was brought with our plates and Man Bun had disappeared. I had to flag down a passing server after being ignored for 20 minutes. My boyfriend's beer took more than an hour to make its way to our table, because that's how long it took our server to put in the order. During this time we actually attempted to flag down the manager, who willfully ignored us, and walked away. Man Bun didn't start providing decent service until we were finished with our meal, ostensibly because he was worried about his tip. It was too little too late for that, as I refused to leave a tip for the privilege of being ignored. In lieu of that, Man Bun received a hand-written note about bettering his service skills. It took away my appetite, and as I sit here eating my leftovers, I can only reflect that the food is much more palatable when not paired with horrendous service."
Kari O.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",678,294,875,2.0,1/5/2015,"Our sever was kind of a jerk We came during happy hour on a weekday and he had an attitude problem. I ordered some fish tacos and my manfriend ordered the endless soup and salad. Once we ordered the endless soup and salad we noticed a change in attitude. I get it, more work for a smaller check. WE TIP. WE TIP WELL if it's deserved.  The busboy deserves a promotion to server because he was amazing. Came over and checked on us, made jokes, smiled.  Not the best experience at BJ's"
Ron L.,"Covina, CA",4989,1343,5039,3.0,12/27/2014,"Christmas Eve..and all through the night not a creature did stir, Not even a mouse...except us four little peeps .. Not to much open on Christmas Eve...but BJ's was .... Second time I've been to this one with friends...to have a great time.. Both times good food and good service The waiter would have to tell us about that pizookie....darn darn darn It's not that I'm on a diet...but I really have to be careful of what I eat now. So, I got the baby pizookie.  Delicious. delicious. delicious chocolate chip and ice cream...but I did leave 1/3 on the plate."
Jen N.,"La Puente, CA",294,73,1023,3.0,4/10/2015,"Very small table for 2. For appetizers, I'd recommend the calamari and stay away from the eggrolls. For pizzas, try the Sweet Pig-- it's better than the Great White, BJ'S Favorite, and Buffalo Chicken. Drinks are always good here so def come during happy hours."
Marvelous M.,"Oxnard, CA",1,20,,1.0,12/4/2016,"Ordered a medium Supreme Pizza for take out, and was told it would be 15 mins, I paid for my pizza and sat in my car in the designated take out parking spaces. I walked in 20 minutes later just standing in the take out section looking dumb founded as there employees were just looking at me as if I was just there to hang out. I asked is that my pizza in that little oven warmer on the ground and immediately the Bjs employee gave me a look like who the hell are you!!!! So he grabbed the pizza and I placed the receipt on the table and stupid enough he says ""did you pay for this"" I was like OMG the receipt was right there in front of him idiot!!!!! So he grabs the pizza and for some reason goes thorough the side kitchen!!!! I was like where is he going!!!! Did he spit in my pizza or what!!!! So finally he comes right out and just places the pizza on the front take out table and turns his back and basically says here you go!!!! I just don't know why he grabbed my pizza and went back into the kitchen that's very odd!!!!"
Lisa S.,"Los Angeles, CA",170,308,1620,3.0,1/16/2014,"First time I ate at BJ's I felt sick after. I don't know if I had food poisoning or indigestion lol This location wasn't too bad. Had a get together for a girls night out. We ordered a salad, a pizza, 2 pasta's and shared it family style. Great place if you want to enjoy a few drink when you have family (aka kids) with you lol"
Eric L.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",38,42,329,4.0,7/31/2015,I had the BBQ bacon brisket burger. It was awesome. The burger was tender and the BBQ sauce was really good. BJ is a great place to eat really good food and the beers are not that bad either.
Dean R.,"La Puente, CA",129,28,44,4.0,5/2/2016,"Everything in our takeout order was perfect, lost a star because of the 3 strands of hair I got in my pizza"
Homer d.,"West Covina, CA",93,27,10,2.0,12/27/2014,"This place has gone downhill. This particular BJ's has always lacked the friendliness of the Covina BJ's , but at least the food used to be good.  Nope. Not anymore. Friend ordered a burger to be cooked medium, but they burnt it so bad that the patty was broken up into several dry burnt chunks. I don't know why they even let that out of the kitchen. They did replace it though. Me and my other friend had pasta; mine was clumpy and dry, his he said tasted like boiled pasta with some tomatoes on the side.   Pizza was whatever. Service was a little on the bad side, with the waitress eager to keep giving our bill despite us watching the game and 1 guy continually drinking.   We still tipped over 15%, but I won't be coming back to this BJ's."
Robert A.,"Whittier, CA",50,145,40,4.0,5/10/2015,"Let's get something straight. BJ's is known for their custom brews and their pizza. You know what? Their beer selections are good. Darn good. Their pizza ... eh... it doesn't suck, but it's not the first thing that I (or fellow Yelpers) should reach for. Their menu may not be as vast as other places out there, but seriously, take a gander at their sandwiches and burgers for starters, and you won't be disappointed. Oh, and if you're here before 4 on the weekdays, they've got some darn good lunch deals too that won't bust your wallet, but may bust your belly. The restaurant itself is very nice. Great lighting and ambiance overall. It can get a little loud when it's busy, but it's still just a nice place to look at from the inside. Service here is never an issue. I've always had a pleasurable experience with the people that work here."
Jenn L.,"Saint Louis, MO",51,33,42,3.0,5/14/2015,"I can't say I liked this place, but it's not too horrible either. you can come if you are with a lot of friends and you all liked baseball/football/basketball and want a place where you can watch and eat at the same time.  food is mediocre at best. way too salty, way too fat. most current visit we had pizza (thin skinned) and avocado wrap, both are too much. avocado wrap was a bit better than the pizza. beer was great though. so again I recommend BJ's to people who likes beer and ESPN (or something of the sort)."
Nancy W.,"Los Angeles, CA",125,117,92,1.0,10/21/2015,"This restaurant has gone way down.  Service is slow, unhelpful, and sometimes downright rude.  Food portions have been reduced significantly.  I used to come here almost every week.  Last week's experience was so bad, I don't think I EVER want to go back again."
