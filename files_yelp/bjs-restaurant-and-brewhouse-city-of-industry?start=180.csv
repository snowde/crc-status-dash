roger l.,"Diamond Bar, CA",115,238,222,3.0,1/20/2015,"BJ has gone down in portion, I prefer Yardhouse any time of day.  The pasta is normally quite salty and the pizza always come with super small portions of toppings, now what is up with that?! Service was hit or miss.  Beer is great, but food is just 3 stars."
Jenn T.,"Westminster, CA",68,16,8,1.0,10/17/2014,"I have never felt so neglected at a restaurant till now thanks to our server. Our server is currently MIA while waiting for the check and from what I can tell, we're the biggest group they have tonight so I have no idea what's the hold up especially since it's not even that crowded. If you're reading this, Lawrence, please come back cause we gotta go home! 12:10 AM Day 2 since it's midnight now. We're still here waiting on our cards and receipts back and sucking on the very last remnants of our ice since no one came to refill our cups. Lawrence, please come back with our cards, we got our lives to attend to and we've been here for way too long."
Marty M.,"Diamond Bar, CA",0,29,28,5.0,10/31/2013,"Excellent place for happy hour. Great prices, food, and atmosphere. I think this BJs has the best ambience and atmosphere around town. The restaurant is nice and dark but is lighted up by their selection of liquor. They have a nice big flat screen in the middle of the bar.  Some of their bartenders seem a bit coo coo but Trish is really attentive and accommodating. She makes her drinks well. Great bartender with a positive attitude. I'll be back!"
Ernesto M.,"Corona, CA",83,221,97,3.0,2/22/2015,"The service was pretty lame. She seemed attentive at first but then really sucked. We were sitting in the bar area at a small round table with another couple so you need all the space you can get, she wouldn't even take the empty glasses!!! Had to ask the person who bought the food. A little pricey  but I will give it a second try."
Stephanie R.,"Baldwin Park, CA",4,64,19,4.0,3/4/2016,"I prefer this location over the Eastland Covina location. The service is always better, there are more tables usually available and the beer is fresher. All the food is always good."
Tina L.,"Arcadia, CA",56,5,,4.0,1/30/2015,"I like the environment in it. The food are very good too ;)  Happy hour price are pretty good but dinner Manu is a little bit pricy. Service are very good, got serve in a timely manner"
Lesley D.,"Walnut, CA",67,4,,1.0,6/18/2016,"More than just terrible service.  I came here for dinner with a couple of my friends and we arrived at about 7pm. We got seated at about 7:11 and we ordered our food shortly after. Our first server Steve went on break and our next server Kenny took over and introduced himself. We waited for about 20 minutes and our server came and told us that our food would be out soon. However, time continued to pass by and 10 minutes later he came again to tell us our food would be arriving soon. ANOTHER 10 minutes passed by and my friend asked where our food was and he told us he would find out and send the manager over to us. The manager, Taylor, came over and explained that our food was given to another table, that it food was being remade and that it was at the top of their priority. She said it would only take a couple more minutes and then asked us if she could get us anything. However, it seemed kind of useless to order an appetizer when our food would be coming out ""soon"". She wanted to let us know that this did not usually happen. However, she didn't really offer a solution or proper closure to the accident. We told her we were fine and we continued to wait for our food. After about 10 more minutes of waiting, Kenny, our server told us that he was sorry, our food would be out right away and that he knows that it sucks for us. Yes. It did suck. We didn't need to be made aware of that fact. So of course, we wait some more and finally after over an hour of waiting(total), our food comes.  The food was okay. Nothing special. Definitely not worth the amount of time we waited. We didn't order dessert because the amount of time we might have had to wait for it would be frightening. My friend asked for a box for her food and it was not given to her so she had to ask another waiter. We asked for our checks and we paid our bills separately. My meal came out to be $17.71 and I paid with a $20 bill. My change came back as $2. My other friends did not get full change for their meals either. By this time, we were so done with this place and the frustrating experience. A simple sorry, it won't happen again, does not make things any better."
Johel S.,"Rowland Heights, CA",0,8,5,1.0,4/8/2016,I've been to this place several times the food is amazing and the Pizookies they sell are amazing but the reason I'm giving it a 1 star is due to the fact that every time I've eaten there the service give. has been terrible. That's all I have to say so if your willing to put up with waiters that hate their  jobs and have terrible attitudes then be my guest and go. #20minutewaits
Jenny N.,"Walnut, CA",151,191,74,2.0,9/21/2014,"Came here to eat dinner on a Sunday evening. Got seated quickly..  But our table had not been wiped down properly. The server wiped it down so no problem.  Ordered our drinks... Took at least ten minutes to get them.   Ordered our food when the drinks came cause I was afraid I wouldn't see my server again for a lengthy time.  I ordered the Hawaiian mahi mahi. Then came the wait. About 30-35 min later our food arrived and our server was running around, we hadn't seen him since we ordered our food.  The mahi mahi was dry and a little burned on top. I'm sure that's why I waited so long for my food, cause it was drying out from being overcooked.  Would I order this again? No. Could service had been better? Our server Alex could have come by earlier to at least give us a status of our food.  The only saving grace was when our server went on break and was relieved by James. He made sure to check on us and get us refills and just ask ""if everything was OK"" when he did actually ask us, I wasn't in the mood to bring up the fact that my mahi mahi was dry and overcooked.  Long story short, don't come here if starving and you don't mind waiting for your food for a long while. Side note, someone who appeared to be a manager, came by to pick up one of our plates, normally they would ask how everything tasted, not him, he didn't seem happy to be there. I know he wasn't a busser cause they wear different outfits."
Cindy T.,"Orange County, CA",743,425,1236,3.0,4/21/2013,"Dinner was ok. The portions are kind of small. I had a chicken pasta limone and it was tiny. It came with really good garlic bread though. I had to eat a slice of my bf's pizza because I didn't think it was enough food. I do eat a lot, but seriously, I get full from other places though. I definitely had enough room for dessert.  We got the red velvet pizookie. It was pretty good. The cookie was warm and the vanilla ice cream was a good compliment to it.  Service was kind of spotty the whole night. Our server took our older and didn't return until 20 minutes after to say that he will look for our food. Seriously?  Then he disappeared again. But he picked up the check really quick though. Had a fun night watching the Clippers game though and just general people watching."
Felicia L.,"Long Beach, CA",600,1593,658,3.0,8/14/2013,"It was a Sunday and I met up with a friend here for an early dinner. It was so crowded! Hard to find parking. I guess it's a pretty popular spot, well at least for that area being neighbors with Red Lobster and Golden Corral. We sat at the bar and ordered a pomegranate margarita and a white peach sangria. The margarita was good, as well as the sangria... but not strong at all. The fruits in the sangria were not fresh fruits but frozen... but hey at least they put fruits. We also shared a small spinach and artichoke pizza which was good  and plenty for the both of us. I always liked BJ's pizza mainly because of the pizza dough and how they bake it. It goes very well with the spinach and artichoke. As for the service it was friendly despite being busy. Overall a good spot."
Catt F.,"Whittier, CA",18,7,5,1.0,11/8/2015,"Not happy with this place. A few weeks ago we were having a family dinner. We understand it was busy. Our granddaughter got her meal last, pasta. I was sitting next to her as she was taking out the broccoli and noticed something ""BLUE"" on her plate!! It was chewed gum!!! We were all so disgusted, we all just stopped eating! After a few minutes the waitress came around and pointed it out to her, she took it away. Later a manager came over and asked if he could bring her another pasta. Of course not was my angry answer. We paid and left. Yes we still had to pay!! So disappointed, with this location. Not going back there. Keep an eye on your plate."
Mary P.,"Anaheim, CA",299,291,228,1.0,10/18/2014,"Went here for my friend's birthday. We were a party of 10 but everyone got there and ordered at different times yet we all got out food at the same time, which means some of us waited over 30 minutes for our food. We didn't even get a round of water for our group, our server was MIA for most of the night. It even took At least 15 minutes for him to give us back our cards after we paid. The place was not crowded as we got there at 10pm so we didn't understand what the big hold up was. All in all we ended up leaving at 12:30 when we got there at 10pm, mostly because we were in a waiting game with our server. Definitely won't be back to this place."
Lisa D.,"La Puente, CA",0,9,1,1.0,12/31/2015,"The flatware,glasses and napkins all had bits of old food on them. I will not return to this location."
Nicole Q.,"Long Beach, CA",266,473,373,4.0,9/8/2014,"Because I attempt to avoid chain restaurants on a whole, my rating may be somewhat biased. This is a place my dad likes and the only time I've been is when my dad and grandma want to eat out.  Generally-speaking, the service is pretty good. The food is ok. The Scallop entree, even with no sauces and no butter whatsoever was pretty good.  For me, the downside is a huge restaurant filled with people, loads of kids and huge families, which can translate into a loud and chaotic-feeling dining experience. As I said, my review is probably a little biased by my dislike of chain restaurants, which usually are more concerned with packing people in than intimacy."
Ron G.,"Walnut, CA",1,24,2,1.0,2/26/2017,"I usually go to this BJ cause it's closer to my house then the West Covina location. Went in this past Friday night and sat at a table at the bar area to avoid the long wait for a table. Elissa M was our server. She was friendly and took our order for food and drinks. Our order came to our table at a decent time for a Friday night. Elissa cane by to check if everything was ok and I showed her my plate of food that I ordered and had a long piece of hair in it. Whoever the food preparer or cook was in the kitchen probably wasn't wearing a hair net or hat. Elissa apologized and took my plate and would get me another order. The order took forever and my girlfriend already finished her food when my new order came in. I remember going to other restaurants where my order was wrong or had a problem and the server would be on it right away and even have the manager come by and apologize. Elissa even though she was friendly and not rude didn't expedite my reorder nor did she even come by and refill our drinks.  I noticed Elissa was more attentive to her party's of 4 I get it because you want to work for that tip, but treat everyone the same."
Imran K.,"Walnut, CA",3711,725,48,4.0,7/25/2014,"This is a busy location and has enormous parking, went for dinner 5 people were seated quickly the staff is very cooperative and helpful.  For starters had Spinach And Artichoke Dip, that is served warm with crisp corn tortilla chips, there was pleanty left over after we all tried this.   Tried the Seared Ahi Salad with baby field greens, napa cabbage, romaine and red bell peppers tossed with rice wine vinaigrette. Served with tomatoes, avocado, pickled cucumber, cilantro, wasabi, crisp wonton strips and green onions I got the pizza with pineapple and jalapenos  Avocado Egg Rolls A blend of avocados, cream cheese, sun‑dried tomatoes, red onions, cilantro, pine nuts, chipotle peppers and spices. Served with a sweet tamarind sauce. Su[per tasty with their sweet dip. I ordered Vegetarian Sliced mushrooms, green peppers, black olives, white onions, pineapple  and seasoned tomatoes.  Came out delicious. My drink was lemonade their pink lemonade is tasty. Loved and enjoyed the evening."
Maggie C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3683,2700,11555,3.0,12/27/2012,We didn't have a lot of options to celebrate a co-worker's birthday. We shared some appetizers and I ordered fish & chips. Crisp potato skins and avocado eggrolls were kinda good.  I liked the eggroll better than the potato and it was kinda spicy. My fish & chips were kinda good at first but I got tired of eating it after a while.  My skinny fries were good. 3 stars!! BJ's is almost yummylicious!!
Brit L.,"Walnut, CA",302,92,87,3.0,2/2/2014,"I've NEVER really had a problem here at this Bj's location, but this past weekend was horrible ! I was treating out my boyfriend for his birthday dinner and we waited for 40 minutes for our entrees--A hamburger and some dried ass pasta ... so thats just 2 stars.  Then the bill came and we saw that our waiter was nice enough to take out the entrees from our bill and throw in free mini pazookies, hence the 3rd star."
Daryl M.,"La Puente, CA",3,9,3,1.0,8/27/2015,"You Know What?? This Place has gone to the Dumps!I was Just there with my Family and It was By Far the Worst Time EVER.We were seated with a damn near empty place yet And still it was like we didnt exist.Several Waiters Walked right by us as if the place was  jumping.I know Im BLACK as Hell But Im pretty Sure you Saw My ""Light"" Wife and Kids,If not Im sure you heard my Kids...We Sat there for 15-20 mins Without even being asked for our drinks.This Isnt the 1st time we experienced this service and I thought it was a Fluke that time.Given the Benefit of  doubt I continued to be a Loyal Fan Of the food and Generous tipper but this was my last draw.We Walked out and The Hostess That sat us didnt even bother to ask is everything ok! I am A Rewards customer but i will not be going back there ever."
