Ana M.,"City of Industry, CA",155,1,,1.0,2/17/2016,"Walked in. Stood in front of the host desk with a hostess in the booth and maybe 4 servers talking to her. Long brown hair on a short little girl. She obviously saw us. Stood there for 30 seconds until I finally said "" are we invisible?"" Then she finally asked ""how many?"" No hello. No greeting. No I'm sorry. I don't understand how you can screw up being a hostess. Terrible. Hope our server is better."
Peter P.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",15,162,2,4.0,4/24/2013,"Endless soda, great beer, great pizza and service. I don't care if it's a chain, it's great food and a place to hang out late at night after a hard day's work. Their chicken marsala was quite good; I'd try our their other pizza alternatives as well in the future."
Diana J.,"Rowland Heights, CA",475,153,84,5.0,9/21/2012,"who likes ipas? I like ipas! I love bj's bars. Every bjs is the same setup and wherever you go you instantly feel like you're at home... wait is that just me. No.. I'm not an alcoholic. It's just comforting :P But this Bj's has a very good selection of tap :D Arrogant bastard, greenflash, racer 5?? And that's all I got to know in one night because really I only swung by to grab a jeremiah.... oops I'm a fan! woohooo"
Jackie T.,"La Puente, CA",45,156,72,1.0,5/21/2014,"Bj's did the impossible for me... they made me hate pasta for the first time in my entire life. They've also lost plenty of their loyal customers last night.  We called ahead to book a reservation for a graduation party since our party was more than 7 . The hostess would not let us book an appointment simply because she said there wouldn't be a wait. That's not the point a reservation. It's supposed to give the kitchen and staff the heads up that there's a big party coming in. We waited more than an hour for our food while others around us who came half an hour after us, got their food. Half of the people at our table receieved ice cold pasta and mine was missing meatballs.  Take 2: 30 minutes later the pasta was hot, but my meatballs were cold and mostly fillings. I asked for meatsauce but I got marinara.  One star for the manager stepping up and apologizing without giving excuses or blaming others. Also, he took off 50% of our total bill since he saw how upset we all were ( we even turned down free soup,  salad, and dessert). We just wanted to go home after 3 hours of chaos. We noticed around us that other larger parties were upset too. This place is okay for a party of 4 or less and the lunchtime menu is reasonable. Other than that, DON'T BOOK LARGER PARTIES HERE."
carmen b.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",0,7,7,4.0,2/9/2015,"I always love going to BJ's, The food is never disappointing. The drink are awesome, well I only ever drink margaritas but of all the restaurants around I like the margaritas here, I give them a 10. The staff are very friendly they are always making sure everything is ok."
Jackson W.,"Los Angeles, CA",125,131,91,3.0,6/16/2014,"I don't frequent BJ's in general. But I never mind going. Pizzas are okay. Maybe I'm just not a fan in general of deep dish unless it's the kind of deep dish they serve in Chicago Fire in downtown Sacramento. I was very disappointed with BJ's Ahi Poke appetizer. Just didn't taste right at all. I should have given it back, but didn't think to. The wonton chips were perfectly fine. However the tuna was just really sad. Tasted like they just mixed some green onions, d-grade diced tuna sashimi, and tossed it around in some bland soy sauce, then topped it over a bed of finely chopped cabbage with sesame seeds. By far the worst Ahi Poke I've ever had. You would think that if a chain restaurant offered something like this, they would make it an appealing item to order. However, it tasted like this dish was a complete afterthought. Just seemed like there were so many missing ingredients. Even my friend was disgusted by this dish. On the plus side, the berry limeade was a great refreshing drink. Definitely got me hooked. And you can't leave without having a pizookie!"
Tina Luo Real Estate Broker L.,"Rowland Heights, CA",1,4,8,5.0,2/4/2015,"I invited two of my friends for lunch, they both never come BJ in the before. We love their Avacado Egg Roll, my friends ordered lemon chick and I ordered pasta. Both tasted very good."
Michael L.,"La Puente, CA",101,7,1,5.0,1/2/2016,You guys are full shit I get the upmost best service a beer chugging man ask for !!! My service is always on point
Sandy K.,"Whittier, CA",3003,1575,9402,3.0,7/12/2012,"Came in on Friday after a round of golf with my co worker. It was quite busy and the place is set up with a sports bar atmosphere. It was nice and we watched the woman's US open while we had lunch. BJ's has come a long way since I dined at the location in Belmont Shores! Since going public they have really gone big box for sure. My order the lunch special - crispy, hand breaded, buttermilk fried chicken breast, pepper cream gravy, white cheddar mashed potatoes and corn and fire-roasted red pepper succotash. The entree was tasty but the chicken was on the small side. I thought it was pricey for around $10.00  I was actually still hungry after my meal! Next time I think we'll wait in line at Golden Corral next store."
Mihae F.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",14,46,12,3.0,9/26/2015,"We have been to this location probably 15 times....since it opened and they have yet to resolve their biggest issue; the food comes out so dang slow! !!!! It took 27 minutes for my daughter's birthday pazookie to come out.  It's almost as if their kitchen is too small or they are continuously short staffed.  I wish they cpuld get it right because everything else works! Hosting staff,  wait staff,  food quality. ....."
Catalina T.,"Los Angeles, CA",667,753,2250,3.0,8/23/2012,"We sometimes order from here a good amount of times for pick up. In one of the first occasions that we had placed an order, they didn't provide me with the bbq dressing for our bbq chicken salad and our pizza was incorrect. This wasn't the first time that they had forgotten something out of our order so I had asked them to please double check and make sure that everything was in there, since they kept getting the orders wrong. Sadly I showed up back to my work place with no bbq sauce/dressing for the salad (which was the most expensive thing in our order), semi cold pizzas and no utensils for our lunch. I decided to call since this wasn't the first time and inform them that the dressing wasn't included and make them aware to double check their orders. Who I spoke too claimed to have been the manager and actually had the decency to ask me to drive back to pick up the dressing?!!! REALLY??!! CMON! This should have been taken care of  the first time before I left and you asking me to go back to pick it up was rude. She then offered to send me some gift card to compensate for the dressing. No one at work ate the salad since its not that great missing the dressing. We never received the gift cards either. I then proceeded to write a letter to corporate about their customer service and I sadly never heard back from them. I was disappointed that they do not double check their orders. I would recommend anyone that picks up lunch here to check their orders before leaving the restaurant or they will ask you to come back to fix it. The good thing is that they do have other things other than their over doughy pizzas. Sadly when I think of BJs I think of pazookies and pizza and their pizzas are sooo not recommended from here. We've ordered a variety of them but for some reason they aren't that good, at least not to go. We also stopped ordering the bbq chicken cobb salad and stuck to the regular BJs cobb. We do not order the pizzas any more and we stick to their sandwiches which to my surprise have always been well prepared and don't lack on flavor or ingredients. They all have been satisfying and good enough to keep us coming back ordering the a la carte style. As for customer service, I do not pick up the orders anymore, I just place them over the phone and so far at least over the phone, they have been friendlier and more helpful (their party platters changed recently and the lady that helped me over the phone was really helpful and especially really patient). Bjs cobb salad is good. As for my favorite sandwich so far from them I would say the roasted turkey cobb. The avocado egg rolls arent' that bad either."
Aerial A.,"Los Angeles, CA",19,604,67,5.0,9/12/2015,"I really like BJ's restaurants. My friend and I came for the $25 deal. We got a bacon and ranch tavern cut pizza, chicken tortilla soup, clam chowder, and the cookies and cream pizookie. Everything was great food wise and the service was excellent as well."
Sloppy H.,"Irvine, CA",36,32,13,1.0,8/18/2015,Returned entree twice because it was overcooked. Manager was not apologetic and did not seem to care. Get a new career if u hate your job.
Geraldine S.,"Los Angeles, CA",203,66,131,2.0,3/3/2012,"The service at this particular BJ's is horrible!!! The waiters are nice but they're just too damn slow! On top of that, they're forgetful. You ask them for a refill of a diet coke, a spoon, and honey mustard... they come back with only two of the three things. COME ON, ADRIAN*. My cousin felt bad for not saying please but let's be honest, after we ask for something twice and we still don't get it, on the third request, manners go out the window. *Don't worry, that's not our waiter's real name. I'm not that mean, I promise."
Lynn B.,"Los Angeles, CA",86,241,12,5.0,3/2/2014,"i've been to this Bj's restaurant several times, but last week the service I received was on point! All the managers came to greet our table, the servers were super attentive, and the hostess was very friendly. I was so surprised at how much attention our table got.  Thanks, BJ for your SUPER friendly service. I was impressed!!"
Dani S.,"Santa Ana, CA",1006,2146,4147,4.0,12/30/2011,"Happy Hour is the sh*t! 3-7pm M-F, get your drinks on! Different HH drink specials on different days. 1/2 wine on Tue. $2 OFF appetizers, flatbreads; 1/2 off mini pizzas. Available only in the bar area. Ordered Chicken pestos flatbread & Santa Fe spring rolls - both were superb in taste and presentation.  Crowd is interesting: lots of salt/pepper men w their beer babies, families w kids, surprisingly no single women anywhere to be seen. They r probably next door at Lowe's checking out guys & their big muscles. At least that's what I would be doing if I wasn't here."
Tejas M.,"Anaheim, CA",300,298,51,2.0,2/21/2014,"The ambiance is nice but the happy hour services were poor.   When I ordered an extra drink before the end of happy hour, the response from the waitress was ""you can't order more until you are done (or may be half done) with the current drink""  This is one of the biggest BS I have heard!   Wonder why do they have pitchers on menu with this kind of a policy?... Hehe :)"
Monica V.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",39,23,2,1.0,8/19/2015,Angel Hair Classico was horrible was dry & sticky not much flavor chicken tasted like rubber it was supposed to be blackened but did not look like it at all well it gets worse I felt sick all night felt nauseous and woke up with a headache .... Will not be returning to this place . The only good thing was it was my granddaughters birthday they brought her this cookie with ice cream thing but didn't even sing to her the waiter just dropped it off and ran  I guess they don't do that there  but the ice cream was good I guess cause it wasn't made there
Jeeyoung P.,"Los Angeles, CA",266,256,591,3.0,6/27/2012,"My friends and I were STARVING when we came here. They said the wait would be 5 minutes, so we went in. Probably because all the people were lining up at Golden Corral. By the time we were done eating, people were circled around the whole building and came to BJS..  After we were seated, we ordered: -Mediterranean Pizza -Meatballs and Garlic Bread -Mahi Mahi dish -Caesar salad -1/2 white choc macadamia and 1/2 red velvet pizookie Okay, the food took FOREVER!! Like 40 minutes!!!! Ugh, not good for famished girls.  We got a little antsy and blamed our friend who wanted to come here haha. So don't come if you want your food quickly! Anyway, our food finally arrived all at the same time, so that was good. I got the meatballs, they were good, but anything would have tasted good for me at that time. The salad is well salad. Nothing out of the ordinary. Mahi Mahi dish seemed to be average too. I had a slice of my friend's pizza, and I didn't like the flavors. It just tasted like salty olives.. After we finished the food, we were not satisfied, so we decided to order the pizookie!  Another 20 minutes of waiting, it arrived. The pizookie was probably gone in 3 minutes! SO DELICIOUS. I like the white choc macadamia the best.  They even took FOREVER to get our checks and split them! So annoying.  I would come to Bjs to try their another pizza and pizookie, but not this location."
Wendy L.,"Lakewood, CA",30,17,,1.0,5/17/2014,"Zero stars if it was an option.  This comment is purely on their customer service. Called today for reservations at 7pm for a large party of 10 ppl and they were absolutely horrible. They asked if it was for a graduation and I said, no. Once I said that, she was like 'oh' we have nothing available at that time. 10pm is free. WTF- who eats 3hrs after the time they requested!  Then she suggested 4pm- again WTF.  They are absolutely rude and were not able to accommodate at all."
