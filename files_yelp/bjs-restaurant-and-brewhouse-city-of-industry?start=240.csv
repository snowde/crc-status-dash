Joshua R.,"Whittier, CA",126,56,164,3.0,9/7/2015,"I came here with some friends of mine to celebrate out Labor day.  Unfortunately the service took longer than expected. We ordered a few rounds of beer, appetizers, and pizza. It took a while for the waitress to get our drinks to us. After we ate, we ordered dessert. It took another 20 minutes to get the order to us. Now if it was busy, I would understand. However, I was definitely seeing empty seats throughout the restaurant. This isn't the first time I've experienced this type of service at this place. If they can somehow improve this, I am willing to give more stars."
Rosalyn D.,"Rowland Heights, CA",444,12,14,1.0,4/10/2015,Came in for lunch for a friend's birthday and couldn't be more disappointed with the slow service. It wasn't even busy. Took more than half an hour just to get my card back; that's just ridiculous.
Jin U.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",193,28,33,5.0,6/28/2015,Went with my family for dinner on a Sunday night. Definitely a busy night but the wait wasn't too bad. (15-20 min) The first server was very rude and inattentive. He didn't even make eye contact and when I asked for recommendations he just said that's the only one with this kind and didn't care about what I had to say. My parents are very easy going and even they all thought he was very rude and gave everyone a negative vibe. So we asked to change our server. That was definitely a good choice because the new server who took care of us was one of the most caring and awesome servers we've had. His name was Ahmed and he was so nice and made the dinner way more enjoyable. Kept coming back to check in to make sure everything was going smooth. Definitely let us forget that our first server was the worst. Awesome humor and made the effort to ask for our names and get to know us. Made us feel like we were really welcomed there. There should be more servers like him who gives great impressions to the restaurants and make you want to come back.
Albert W.,"Orange, CA",701,1823,60,3.0,1/22/2014,It's a well run chain.   They have the food and process down pat.   There really isn't any surprised.   Sad thing is that people think this is representative of a good pizza joint.
Joel R.,"La Puente, CA",203,13,75,5.0,3/8/2014,"I love this place!! I always eat & drink at the bar because the bartenders are really cool to talk to. I usually come after work to chill before I head home. The food is great! There's a lot more than just pizza. They have burgers and other entrees if your not looking to eat pizza though by any chance you are looking for pizza I highly recommend getting The Great White pizza which is a chicken pizza with garlic, onions, tomato and Alfredo sauce! They also have two types of crust (original deep dish & hand tossed) and you can never go wrong by finishing your meal with a delicious Pizookie desert! :D enjoi"
Steve G.,"Diamond Bar, CA",0,44,11,2.0,8/29/2015,"My wife and I went here again last night for dinner. This time I was disappointed with my dinner. I had the House Top Sirloin Steak dinner. When they brought out the plate I thought it was one of those diet plates. Where is the other half of my steak? It was a joke how small it was. Normally the portions at BJ's are very good. This was bad. Even my wife was shocked. We complained to the manager and at first she was like, well that's the size. Then I complained to the waiter and he said he would get me an additional steak. I should have taken a picture of the plate. It was sad! Any way the waiter took care of the problem and everything ended well. I was just surprised because this had never happened and the manager was not going to do anything at first. My wife had the salmon and she said it was great and it looked great on the plate. We will see what happens next time."
Raul R.,"Coral Springs, FL",25,9,2,1.0,12/28/2014,"This place sucks.   Service is crap, ordered a pizookie they gave it to me raw and it took them about an hour to bring it.  After they realized that it was still raw they come back and let me know they were going to give me another one and that the manager was going to comp it.  I get my check and they still charged me!  Table was dirty as hell had to clean it myself.  Bad service man.  CALIFORNIA PIZZA KITCHEN IS WAY BETTER!"
Ashley C.,"Whittier, CA",0,3,,5.0,11/5/2014,"I didn't get the bartenders name, but she was the greatest server! She wasn't wearing a name tag for some reason?  Anyways, I left this bj's very satisfied. She recommended that we get a pizooki or whatever they're called. So glad that I did! I will definitely be back soon!!"
Gerardo A.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,14,,1.0,2/2/2014,"Normally, I like BJs, but this location leaves a lot to be desired. The location is nice and the restaurant is big, but that's where the positive comments stop. Me and a friend dropped by on a Saturday afternoon, and ordered pizzas and a pizookie. The waitress we had was a bit cold, in my opinion, but other servers seemed just fine.  The reason this place gets one star is because both me and my friend had indigestion problems afterwards. For myself, I know that the chicken bacon ranch pizza is the only thing I ate that day, so I can pinpoint the source of my troubles. I didn't go in with the intention to pay for the privilege of going to the restroom every two hours, but that's exactly how my night turned out."
David D.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",0,2,,1.0,2/3/2016,"Theirs nothing worse than coming from work trying to enjoy a good meal and expect good service but unfortunately at this establishment it was horrible from the hostess not knowing her job, to servers making faces and throwing coasters at us. I've never been so irritated with the horrible service I was given by Stephanie. My partner and I went in around 3 in the afternoon. Restaurant not even full, our server takes about 7 mins to greet us. Once she gets to us we are all ready with our order so that she didn't have to get the run around. Well here's when the sh** show starts. The food runner who drops off my beer places my beer at the edge of the table then decides to go grab coasters and literally throw them on our table, not place them he stood 2 feet from my table and threw them. I wanted to get up and tell that guy with the beard off so bad because that was simply rude. Then when it the food is finally up, my partner starts to roll up his noodles and a piece of plastic comes from within the dish. DISGUSTING!!! Now for the best part once we told our server that we wanted it remade, she stops and makes a face as if it was an issue. I didn't know your job of taking orders was so hard. Then the manager comes over still charges us for the plate that we didn't eat, and offers dessert. I rather you have been more professional with the matter rather than offering a dessert. BJs you're terrible!!!"
Gabby A.,"La Puente, CA",37,27,20,5.0,4/30/2015,"My hubby, our friends and myself come here on a weekly basis, the servers are very friendly and always go a good job. Because we are regulars they already know what we order. The food is always tasty."
Tricia G.,"Miami, FL",183,109,148,4.0,8/29/2011,"BJ's is a great place to hang out with large groups of friends and family.   The place can get a bit on the loud side at times (especially when a game is on), so it wouldn't make for a romantic setting for you and your honey.  The service is usually on the good side - the waiters make sure your drinks are filled at all times and it's a plus when they don't roll their eyes when you ask for separate checks! From the pizzas, to chicken wings, to pastas, to sandwiches - the food is good.  Decent.  A-OK.  I usually order the Chardonnay Shrimp Pasta (creamy pasta dish with bacon and LOTS of shrimp), and I was pretty bummed when I found out that they no longer have that dish on the menu.  Their avocado egg rolls are delicious as well!   Aside from the deep dish pizzas, BJ's is known for their beer and pizookies!!!  I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE the pizookies (soft cookie baked in a small deep dish pizza pan with ice cream on top)!  Whether it's the chocolate chip pizookie, white chocolate chip pizookie, black and white (half chocolate/half white chocolate) or the delicious red velvet pizookie - you CANNOT and SHOULD NOT leave the restaurant without having a pizookie for dessert!!!"
Loretta R.,"Whittier, CA",10,105,12,2.0,1/1/2014,Food was great! Service and servers are inexperienced and slow. This would not be a bjs location to visit.  Most likely I would not return here again or recommend this location to others.
Cesar R.,"San Diego, CA",82,44,2,1.0,9/6/2013,"I guess it's ok for this establishment to serve their customers with dirty dishes and give vegetables that weren't washed properly(it still had dirt on it). Last time I checked , this is a health code violation.  Spoke to mgr, she just took the dirty plates . Service was horrible, server only came by 2x's and then on my bill they suggest 15% or 20% tip. Really for shitty service you expect 15 or 20% tip? You lost your damn mind. Not coming back to this place again!"
Jason S.,"Ontario, CA",2,12,2,3.0,7/24/2015,"I went here for lunch while was car was being serviced at nissan.  The food and service was good; but, my pizza came late.  So they offered me a dissert.  But as I was eating my pizza I bit into a piece of plastic.  On the plus side they comped  my whole meal.  I know stuff happens and I will still come again"
Steven D.,"Whittier, CA",7,65,10,4.0,5/25/2015,Bjs style of Chicago pizza is really good. I love the stewed tomatoes the their pizza sauce. Overall the service is always good and the food standard is maintained.
Little S.,"Schenectady, NY",4,109,5,3.0,9/27/2015,I went here with a couple Christian friends once several years ago. It was decent. No coupons or anything though. :(
James O.,"Riverside, CA",1,17,5,2.0,8/28/2015,"Lawrence was rude. He also seemed rude and abrupt with his other tables also. I'm sure if you actually got a decent waiter/waitress you may have a good meal here. I frequent Brea BJ's and never have issues. But he walked up said my name is Lawrence I'll be serving you. Anything to drink?. I asked of there was a happy hour and he said ""oh well idk.. oh yea there is but I would have to go get you a different menu."" Sorry to be such an inconvenience to you. If you don't like your job gtfo. There's plenty of people who will gladly be pleasant at their job. I'd give 1 star but the guy who brought out the waters was genuine and nice just bringing out water."
Jackie R.,"West Covina, CA",407,364,644,3.0,6/16/2012,"Pretty good food, but it depends on what you order and when. I really love the Piranhe Pale Ale Nachos. I think that's what they're called. lol They are REALLY good. Of course there's also the famous Pizoockie. Other than that, the food ranges from okay to good. Their alcoholic drinks are pretty good and there's a fairly new non-alcoholic beverage called ""Orange Twist"" that I like a lot. I don't know what happened to my favorite grilled cheese sandwich to go with the tomato bisque? Boo!!!!!!! How dare you take that off the menu! I taketh one star away! The service is okay, nothing special.  Overall, not a bad place to have lunch or dinner."
Tabitha Y.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",462,20,12,4.0,3/21/2016,"I've been to BJs quite a lot and I was always 'whatever' about it. The food was 'eh' and overpriced. But I did come back recently with a friend for dinner and it was quite different from my other experiences. On the day we went, a waitress offered us a slice of their deep dish pizza for free while we were waiting to get seated. I can't really explain it but the pizza was BOMB. That was something they've never done before which was really nice to see! The waiters that served us were very friendly! The food is still overpriced. I think most of the dinner plates were around $14-$16 each. I was going to order their shrimp and asparagus pene (I think that's what it was called) but after I saw the price, I was like ""hell no"". So I ordered their 10 bone in chicken wings. The chicken wings were actually pretty good! I think next time we'll be going during lunch hour or happy hour because it's cheaper than dinner."
