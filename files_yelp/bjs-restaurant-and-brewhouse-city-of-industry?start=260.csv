Jorge S.,"Riverside, CA",4,10,91,4.0,5/3/2015,"Deep dish pizza. In house beers. Wash, rinse, repeat. Maybe it's the nostalgia factor that causes me to be so fond of this place. I know there's tons of smaller pizzerias that will make them as good if not better but being able to walk to to the bar and ordering a deep dish and a delicious beer to go along with it...hard to beat anywhere. The rest of their menu is comparable to any of the other larger mainstays so there's not much to say there except...deep dish pizza, in house beers."
Jennifer O.,"Los Angeles, CA",327,139,112,5.0,3/22/2014,"*Happy Hour Review.* Just went here for happy hour on a Friday evening at around 5:00 P.M. Likes: -Friendly and quick service. -I got the strawberry mojito. It was delicious, made just right (with the right amount alcohol content), and the cup size was fairly big. -Prices are reasonable. Everything is around $4-$6 or so.  -My friends and I shared the spinach and artichoke dip and it was good. -Great place to relax, talk and watch games (They have a few big screen tv's).  -Ample parking in parking lot. Dislikes: -Pretty crowded. You can only sit in the bar area so there is a limited number of tables and chairs. Not the best for big parties.  -Not the biggest variety of happy hour foods and drinks.  Recommend: Yes."
Lisa H.,"Redondo Beach, CA",15,761,154,3.0,2/13/2014,"Good service and happy hour specials.  The food, though, always depend on the location, and this one was ok: pretty standard and nothing special.  We had the ahi tuna appetizer and the tuna doesn't seem or taste that fresh.  We also had a burger, and that was pretty good."
Yard B.,"Rowland Heights, CA",0,173,,4.0,8/10/2015,"First time to BJ's in City of Industry. Our food came fast and was very tasty and good, we ordered Fried Calamari, sheared Ahi Tuna salad and North Shore Mahi Mahi with shrimp and the baked chocolate cookie with vanilla ice cream.  Our server's name is Katy and she deserves five stars, she made sure everything was ok, refilled our water and checked on us several times. You rarely find servers like her who work hard for you these days. Pretty cool place to eat and have a drink, I'd eat here again."
Abe A.,"Walnut, CA",0,2,2,5.0,4/8/2016,"WOW! My wife and I had date night at BJ's near puente hills mall on Friday night. It was crowded (as expected for the weekend) however we were able to find the last two seats available on the bar because we did not want to wait for a table. They were lowered and near the kitchen so it was awkward at first for us, but the moment our server, Michael, greeted us he made us feel so welcome and I knew he would take good care of my wife and I. He checked on us constantly, even though it was extremely busy, and made sure we got everything we asked for. At the end of our date, he mentioned a rewards card that we can sign up for and all the benefits of having it. We gladly signed up for it and will definitely be coming back to redeem all our rewards. Thanks Michael for making my date night wonderful!!! BJ's rocks!"
Mary W.,"Long Beach, CA",22,73,,4.0,6/22/2013,"My family and I went here for dinner after a certain fiasco in my other same day review, and overall it was a pretty solid experience. The waitress and/or cook forgot to add on chicken on my husband's pasta dish. But the waitress was courteous and brought him a nice sized side, and did not add it to the bill. The service was great.  My particular dish, the creole tilapia, left a lot to be desired, but it was certainly edible. That's the reason for four stars.  We had a good time."
Ivy W.,"Los Angeles, CA",1536,1308,2750,2.0,4/25/2013,"Since this BJ's isn't too far from my work, I decided to order online and take advantage of their curbside service. Their online menu wasn't very organized nor easy to read, but that isn't this location's fault. I decided to get the Cajun Pasta -- fettuccini noodles tossed in a creamy tomato sauce with blackened chicken breast, fire-roasted red peppers, red onions, and topped with fresh Parmesan cheese and green onions. Sounds tasty, right? The pasta wasn't bad, tasty even; but after picking it up and taking it back to the office to devour, I was shocked to see how tiny the portion was. Maybe it was because the plastic take-out plate was huge, but the pasta barely covered it at a thin layer. For $12, it was really pathetic and disappointing. Either use smaller packaging or don't skimp out on noodles! Pasta noodles aren't even expensive... I won't be back."
Alice C.,"Pomona, CA",1,18,11,1.0,6/1/2014,"I like BJ's except this location-City of Industry.  My family and I went to this location many times, front servicer always are WORSE. That front girl told me to wait 20 mins, but we waited 45 mins for 4 ppl seat, and her attitude wasn't very nice. It make us a bad impression.   Another BJ's locations that services and food are good."
Jaqlyn G.,"Somset, United Kingdom",0,3,,1.0,10/5/2016,"First off let me start by saying the service was horrible from the time we got seated until walking out of the doors. The only ""good"" thing was us not having to wait long for a table. Everything after that was HORRIBLE. EDWARD G, our server, would throw down his notepad on our table while we are ordering & roll his eyes. Then while my friends & I would be in a conversation & EDWARD would come by it's like he would get angry & flip his hand then walk away. We had to ask for EVERYTHING (refills, napkins, utensils, refills AGAIN) it was really unpleasant for him to even come to our table at all. Finally we waited for our check & that was a whole 20-30 minutes more of my time wasted!! Finally when we go to pay they end up charging our card the wrong amount. They claimed they voided the transaction but that was all of the money we had on the card & they said the money would not come back to the card for a few days. Sooooooo how are we supposed to pay? The manager said the card would get declined & stated she didn't know how we are supposed to pay & it has NOHING to do with them. She basically said it's your problem, figure it out. Did she forget THEY charged US the wrong amount?? We never consented to that amount. By the way we arrived no later than 9:30pm the time was already 11:45pm & they close at 12 am....... LUCKILY a friend was there to spot our group. I regret not just walking out. This was the worst of the worst experience I have ever had my whole life!!!!!!! NEVER EVER GO HERE!!! 0 STARS!!!!!! Manager was a Caucasian with blond hair & no customer service for the life of her, too bad I forgot her name."
Jett R.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",0,2,,2.0,7/21/2015,"Great food, the people working in the kitchen get it right every time. The service is the only problem. Hosts and hostesses differ, but they're real sensitive. SOME of the servers are rude, slow, and expect a good tip for it. For example, Edward G served us and he was the rudest waiter I've ever had. EVER. He was flirting with the hostess instead of bringing our drinks. He made the woman in my party very uncomfortable. He threw our To-go boxes on the table. He didn't even bring out our food or give us refills! But the ravioli was great! Great televisions! Take a chance on this place at your own discretion!"
Bryant L.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",9,9,7,4.0,10/23/2014,I have only been to this restaurant a few time the food is great! The service is ok and the price range is a bit high but overall I like this restaurant. I really enjoy their pizza and if you haven't tried the pazooki you're missing out it's an excellent way to end your meal!
Gary W.,"Brea, CA",1837,140,696,4.0,2/18/2014,"Great food and beer. Love their deep dish pizza. If you like alcohol, they've huge selection of beer. Service is not bad, server is friendly and attentive. Huge screen tv everywhere, it's great if you like to watch sports. Great place to host your business or birthday dinner. The parking is pretty bad during weekend."
Link Z.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",3,16,5,1.0,4/16/2015,"My last 3 visits to this BJ's have been so disappointing, usually an hour before closing. The staff looks less than pleased to help. They're flat out annoyed. Tonight was my last time for a long while. My friend and I waited a good while before the waitress walked over (a heavy set girl with a blonde ponytail). All she said was she'd bring back menus and when she brought them back, she set them down and proceeded to walk away before taking our drink order. My friend started to ask her for something as she walked away. She snapped at him, held her hand to his face, and told him to hold on. We were speechless. We got up and left and went to BWW down the street. This is the last time we go to this BJ's, at least until there's a better staff happy to help."
Heidi S.,"San Francisco, CA",195,32,,3.0,9/23/2013,"NOT Chicago style deep dish pizza. With that said, the pizza still tastes fine. I just don't think they should advertise it as deep dish because it tastes like regular Pizza Hut pan pizza with more dough. We ordered 2 medium pizzas (BJ's Favorite and Great White), 1 order of nachos, 1 pitcher of beer, and 1 pizookie platter. It was a good amount for 6 people, but if you were feeling hungry, I think you can order an extra appetizer. The place was really busy, but our server checked up on us often. I had a great time with friends, but an OK time with the food. Meh."
Vanessa M.,"Baldwin Park, CA",215,14,1,4.0,3/15/2015,Sooooooo came here yesterday with Co workers about 7:00 pm. Knowing how it's been pretty hot lately we thought inside would be nice. Took about 40 minutes to be seated (party of 11) and when we got our seats inside it was very stuffy and hot inside. Turns out the AIR CONDITIONER is broken. Omgsh we weren't seated even 15 minutes and we were all complaining about the heat. Luckily we talked to the hostess and were about to get seated outside. Service was great and so was the food but i would head to a different bjs if it being stuffy/hot inside is going to bother you. 4 stars is because the Ac was broken or else it would of been 5.
Thanh S.,"West Covina, CA",3,16,1,1.0,2/24/2016,Don't order the unlimited soup and salad meal.  I didn't get my 2nd salad for another 20-30 mins.  Bill came out fast though.
Gil M.,"Riverhead, NY",317,176,362,3.0,10/21/2013,"Short-n-Sweet: craft beer selection decent, bulist the list of them is incorrect; extremely dim lighting all day; a smaller location STORY-TIME: Let me at the very least say that I'm happy BJ's exists in the Heights. It's quite possibly the only place to offer craft beer on tap in a 5 mile radius!! I love their food, and it's all very competitive with BWWs and Chili's. It's awesome that there's even a second happy hour!  More opportunity to save! However, somethings really got this place into my 3-star category: 1) Beer menu sucks. Not the offerings, mind you. They don't have a correct beer menu.  Actually it seems no BJ's has a correct beer list.  =/ 2) This place is dim like a bat cave!  I had lunch with my dad here and we both thought we were on a date. Lame. Next time we'll choose the patio or even the bar area had more window lighting.  3) Poor training? The waitress didn't know about the special price on BJ's brews for lunch ($3.50 11a-2p), and didn't know the beers.  Still, I'd rather come here than BWW or TGIF for the food and drink selections!"
Kelsey W.,"Los Angeles, CA",178,227,18,4.0,12/27/2013,"I'm a fan of BJs, and this location is just fine! For a restaurant chain, BJs is one of my favorite, with a wide variety of menu items and tasty food. The service here is only okay though, it's kind of evident that the staff shows up just to show up to work, you know? Anyways, I love getting the grilled chicken pasta and pretty much get this every time I come for dinner. I've also tried their deep dish pizzas, as well as their jambalaya and spaghetti, and some other dishes. As you can tell, this review is a long time coming. The chicken is super moist and flavorful, and they give you a large portion, so I always have some left for a second meal. I wish they gave more broccoli... but I digress. They have a good variety of beers on tap too - well, granted, they should, as a brewery! I also love coming to BJs for the pazookies! These are heaven, and if you haven't tried one, go order one now! It never tastes the same when you try to make it at home."
Hanz L.,"Placentia, CA",308,356,70,4.0,8/5/2013,"There are quite a few things I can complain about here, and all of it would be food.  However, parking, service, cleanliness are all good. Instead of complaining  about everything, I will tell you instead what I would come here for:  Skinny fries, pizooki, and drinks.  Their personally crafted sodas are very unique and very refreshing if you come here only once in a while.  There are a few decent dishes for an entree, but I think you'll have to find something to your own liking.  I had the pasta with a lemon flavored sauce on the chicken and that's worth coming back for."
jackie l.,"La Habra, CA",0,1,,5.0,3/24/2016,My son offered to pick up our dinner tonight but when I tried to order online the southern fried chicken wasn't on the menu.  When I called a really nice lady assured me she could get it for me and I then ordered our 3 entries and soup.  When my son got home he raved about the speed of the order and friendliness of the staff.  We can do this more often now that he is so pleased.  Thanks to your staff and your cooks.   I love the chicken dinner
