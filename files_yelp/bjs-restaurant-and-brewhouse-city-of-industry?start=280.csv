Eric C.,"South Burlington, VT",308,224,315,3.0,11/14/2013,"The boyfriend and I came here twice already and I've liked it every single time. BJS has great deals on Thursdays, especially for their happy hour drinks. We usually order an appetizer of the chicken wings and calamari (or chicken wings and a pizza) and that's pretty filling for the both of us. The inside of this specific BJs is a lot less cluttered and feels way more open that most restaurants. The dimly lit ambiance is really nice, especially if you're on a date or trying to go for a more intimate conversation/dinner. The service has always been spot on so I really don't have any complaints about this BJs."
Jay C.,"Hollywood, CA",198,35,50,4.0,1/10/2012,can you say wine and dine..?? Great Happy Hour around..!!  Tuesday Wine is Half off.!!
Raymond R.,"San Dimas, CA",675,428,411,2.0,3/1/2011,"40 minutes to make a freakn pazookie?? Really?? I can understand if our waiter had to run to mrs. Fields and Dairy Queen at puente hills mall to get some cookies and ice cream from there, but I don't think that's the case. A family sitting next to us got there after us, ordered a pizza and some other food and STILL got their food before us. I never say no to BJ's.. and probably will keep coming back after this experience.. But gotta step up the speed on making pazookies!"
Jay C.,"Diamond Bar, CA",63,28,19,1.0,10/8/2015,"I do NOT recommend this location, the one in brea is definitely a lot better. We came here with a group of 10/11 people, we asked for ranch for 5 times & they gave us only 2 ranches for 10 people. We asked for napkins 4 times! The server was not doing this job. We asked again because he didn't give it to us after so many times. The young guy server threw the napkins on the like we were dogs and left without saying a word. Our group of 10/11 people noticed immediately and believe we did face some kind of racial discrimination. The food took forever to come out & ask for the check several times. We waited the server to collect our money for 20 mins & he still didn't show up. One of us had to get up & hand it to an employee. We had to do THEIR job. What kind of service is this? What can of attitude is this? At first, we were going to give 15% of tips, however, we did notice all these issues with their rude attitude and terrible service, they didn't deserve it. Me and the group of 10/11 people will NOT be coming back and do not suggest others to."
Chel R.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",14,706,4505,4.0,12/12/2010,"This is officially my third time at a BJs and my first time at this location.  Its in my hood and its also CMD's favorite spot.   We ordered:  the spinach and artichoke dip for appetizer, i had one of their flat bread, margherita  fresca which was crispy, very light on the tomato sauce, with tastey sweet basil.  We also ordered their chicken parmesan which was indeed amazingly juicy, savory, and flavorful.   It certainly was a busy Sunday for them but we were confused as to who our server was.  We were approached with one server and he immediately said he was not our 'own' server but he will just go ahead and take our orders.  So from bringing us our drinks, refilling our drinks, bringing out our orders, checking up on us, we had a total of FOUR people attending to us.  We weren't sure how to feel about it.  But I guess as long as we were not neglected, ish all good:)"
Aimee M.,"West Covina, CA",93,46,5,5.0,1/8/2013,"Excellent food, friendly service! I usually go for lunch and get their lunch specials and share appetizers.   Here's what to get : For Appetizers ~ Avocado Egg Rolls Ahi Poke   Lunch~ Black And Bleu Flatbread Pizza & Salad Also try the Chicken Tortilla soup.  It's amazing!"
Kevin P.,"Diamond Bar, CA",128,193,83,2.0,10/3/2014,"I like the pizza, beer and pizookies. Usually we come here and get good service, this time service was terrible.  We ordered the 2 for $20 meal which had 2 apps, pizza and pizookie.  Our waiter was having trouble at another table so he completely forgot about us.  Water refills were few and far between.  I didnt even have parmesan and red pepper till i was into my second slice.  Seems like he was busy with other things.  I also ordered a side of fries but got it really late.  I use the BJ's app on my phone so I can see when an order has been placed for me in real time.  I checked the app and the side of fries wasnt on there.  After many tries, i was able to flag down the waiter to ask for the fries.  He said ""Oh they must have forgotten it.""  He walks over to his station then surprise surprise all of a sudden i see the order of fries on my bill in my app.  Did they forget to bring it out or did he forget to place the order for me.  You be the judge.   I'll still come back here.  I just hope I'm not in that waiters section anymore."
Lana D.,"Fontana, CA",81,49,9,2.0,10/25/2012,"Stopped in here with some friends on a Tuesday night, since Buffalo Wild Wings was a no go. Nothing fancy, though slightly pricey. The service was unmentionably slow (which would be understandable if it was a busy night, but we were practically the only table in our server's section). Though I thoroughly enjoyed the ""Berry Sweet Limeade,"" I would have loved it even more if the server refilled my glass. The table ordered some drinks, pizza, burgers, and wings. Average on all accounts."
Brandon M.,"Fullerton, CA",24,153,7,3.0,1/4/2014,"I normally go to a BJ's that's closer to my house. But I was in the area today and thought I would try this one out. For a Saturday night, me and my date were seated rather quickly (which was good). It didn't take long at all to get the food ball rolling, in terms of waitress service. Our waitress was very helpful and friendly. The meal went well, and I didn't have any problems. Over all, it was an ""A-OK"" experience. The reason I don't give it 4 or 5 star is because the atmosphere is bland, too many ghetto people, and the food was good - but not ""great"" as I get at my normal location. It was still a decent spot, and probably more tolerable for the ghetto residents of Industry - It just didn't hit home for me. Over all, it didn't let me down though. I may not choose to go to this specific location again anytime soon, but at least I know its an option in the event I am struck with extreme hunger and am local to this spot."
Elix C.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,20,,4.0,2/1/2015,I came here for a family dinner and was attended by a real good waiter. His name is Angel. This guy knows what being a server is all about. He constantly checked on us. But what I really liked was that the plate I ordered was pretty bland and I only took 2 bites and set it aside. Angel noticed this right away and immediately offered to get me something else. I declined and said thank you. He came back 5 minutes later and said that he removed it from my bill. This is great service. Would definitely go here again.
Stacy C.,"Walnut, CA",753,737,1249,5.0,12/9/2010,"It's nice to have a BJ's around here then having to drive all the way to Brea to come to a joint like this. And I must say that the decor is just fabulous. I love the spinning doors that they have at the front! Came here on a Saturday for lunch and upon going in we were greeted quite graciously by the hostess at the front desk. We were seated accordingly, though I wished they they had given us one of those small booths so I didn't have to sit diagonally from my boyfriend. It was very uncomfortable when want to talk to him, I had to turn sideways. But the service was what sold me on giving them five stars. Our waitress (oh, I wish I remembered her name!) was very polite and very knowledgeable when we asked her what she thought was the best food on the menu since neither of us had really eaten at BJ's before except my occasional trip there to eat their poozkies. We decided to order their deep dish pizza and asked if it was possible not to add cheese on it because my boyfriend was lactose. She suggested a few alternatives for us to make our pizza taste better. She let us choose having only half our pizza be topped with cheese and the other half added with more tomatoes. We also ordered a Shrimp Bruschetta without cheese.  Our bruschetta came out first and upon inspecting it, I realized that they had added cheese on our order. I started picking it out instead of having them needing to remake a new one. When coming to check up on us, our waitress saw and deeply apologized even though she had told the kitchen no cheese. She immediately told us that they'll make new ones for us and took our old one back. In the end, I was really pleased on the service and their food was pretty exceptional (the deep dish mushroom pizza is to die for! It just melts in your mouth and the bread is just the perfect softness!). They'll definitely be expecting me for more future visits! (:"
Cella W.,"Newport Beach, CA",39,84,32,4.0,12/13/2014,"BJs is BJs..you know what to expect, drinks are good, food is good! The server was very patience with our party of 8 with 3 small children! Overall good!"
Dan Y.,"Cheviot Hills, CA",0,117,,2.0,11/21/2012,"This review is specifically for weekday lunch at this location. The lunch choices at BJ's is very reasonable priced, good flavor, with decent portion sizes. With the usual pizza selection, they also have lunch specials like chicken tacos, and all you can eat soup & salad. Also, many of the beers at $3.50 during lunch. If I were rating just the food and pricing, it'd be a strong 3.5 stars. That being said, the service here at lunch is ATROCIOUS. If you have limited time to eat your food and need to head to the office, either get your food to-go or go somewhere else. I've been here at least five times on various occasions for lunch and the service is soooooooooo slow. Management at this location needs to realize that for lunch, many people need to get in and out faster than they would during dinner service. I can't afford to wait fifteen  minutes for a Pizookie, I can't afford to wait ten minutes for a refill of soup, and I sure hell can't wait ten minutes just to get a beer. Get your act together!!!"
Jenny L.,"West Covina, CA",101,24,19,1.0,10/20/2012,"This past Thursday, I was there with my co-workers. I bought 5 Patron silver Tequila for myself and couple of my friends (each shot cost me $7.00, trust me its a smallest shot I ever seen) and they totally taste water down. After i mention to Byron Barrera,. .... he did nothing about it, and then as soon as we try to order more beer, he stop serve to us at 8:30pm......  I will never visit this BJ again. I guess you guys dont care about us...... so why should i give u the business. But i hope you guys will improve in the future for others who is still trying to have fun at BJs."
Jimmy H.,"Buena Park, CA",937,444,757,3.0,3/1/2013,I would put them on par with places like Cheesecake Factory. Food and service is always consistent. I do like their pizza (good selection and quality) and the selection of spirits. We have a very nice waitress today and her service was A plus.
Summer S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,2,3,1.0,9/25/2014,"I have dined at this location before and I was disappointed then (was served and ate off of a dirty spoon disguised as clean..yuck) so I hadn't been back in a while.  I finally came back today to watch Thursday Nite Football and also partake in the advertised ""Party for Two"" deal which included a choice between soup or salad, 1 medium pizza and 1 Pizookie to share for $22.  My party also ordered some drinks and 2 orders of chicken wings from the Happy Hour menu.  Usually the wings are fried and tossed in the selected sauce (in this case, my party chose Garlic Parmesan and BBQ).  For some reason, we received the wings with the sauce on the side.  I'm not sure if this offering is a new way for BJ's to serve the wings or if our server made a mistake, but we did not like the way the wings were served at all.  The rest of the food (and the drinks) were also mediocre--nothing to scream about--including the 'new' Peanut Butter S'more Pizookie which sounded interesting upon ordering, but was not tasty.   I know everyone is usually disappointed when the bill arrives, but I was extremely disappointed because my party was overcharged.  It looked like we were charged for each item ordered a la carte instead of the $22 price that we were expecting.  After pointing this out to our new server, we received the revised bill with the corrected amount and then requested the server to split the bill between the debit cards for each of us.  We all received and signed our individual receipts showing the split charges, however, a few hours after leaving the restaurant, I noticed a charge on my account from BJ's for the full amount of my party's total bill--not the split amount that was on the receipt that I signed.   I called the BJ's location and spoke with the manager (Melissa) who voided the incorrect charge on my card and replaced it with the correct charge that I authorized earlier in the restaurant.  I did receive an apology but I wanted to document this for BJ's Corporate and unfortunately enter my first negative review on Yelp because I was definitely dissatisfied--again.  I do not feel comfortable patronizing this location--or a BJ's--again."
Jeanette D.,"La Puente, CA",58,28,26,5.0,11/11/2014,"Awesome service especially after coming from the montebello one. I usually go to this location and they always have amazing food and service. My favorites are their California burger, parmesan crusted chicken, bjs pizza,  the wings, and my ultimate favorite their Oreo cookie pazooki :Q___ They have a good selection of alcohol and yummy appetizers to go with them. Another thing that I love about this location is that it's not always packed with people or loud. I totally recommend coming to this Bjs!"
Matthew R.,"West Covina, CA",194,559,199,4.0,6/29/2013,BJs is a great dependable spot to grab a few appetizers and some great craft beer. The avocado egg rolls are always a must.
John L.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",3,9,1,4.0,4/14/2015,Overall a good location come like once a month would have put 5star but was one or two occasions  they mixed up my order to go.. But other than that great place.
Lorraine S.,"Rowland Heights, CA",5,20,,1.0,1/19/2016,"My daughter and I have been coming here for years, and the service just keeps getting lousier!! Our last two visits have been the absolute worst. The servers are down right rude and or un-attentive, the prices are pretty steep for the mediocre quality of food. I am done supporting this establishment time to move on."
