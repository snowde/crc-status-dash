Tina V.,"City of Industry, CA",314,454,653,1.0,6/11/2011,"food is oily, heavy and salty in this locations and services is beyond horrible. you would expect decent services for a new restaurant.   Took 20mins to take my order and 45 mins to bring the order and the beer was warm... for a chain bj is suppose to be good for beer.   i think ill stick to the west covina or brea location at least the beer and food is more average comparable than here."
Susanna H.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",21,5,9,2.0,7/6/2014,"Went there with my kid for a late lunch the food was ok and the waitress walk by us twice with water but never refill our cup or even a courtesy to asked if we need more water, for the whole meal we only had ONE cup of water... We still tip her 15% but in my head I can just walk out without giving her any tips.."
William C.,"Rowland Heights, CA",23,7,,1.0,3/9/2013,"I need to leave a post it in my car reminding me why I shouldn't come here anymore. I've been here for different occasions and it has always been a terrible experience.  Recently came here for lunch, decide to sit at the bar since it was pretty empty. Ordered a pitcher of their phiranna, shrimp pasta, mozzarella sticks, and a Pizza. I've had the phiranna at brea and it was amazing. At this location it tasted completely different. Super bitter and it didn't have that sweet after taste it usually does.  Food took about half an hour to come out. For being so empty I figured it'd come out alot quicker. Waitress was too busy chatting up with her friends in the table behind ours. By the time the food came out it was cold. The pizza was cold, pasta had cold spots, and we never even got our mozerlla sticks. Whats the point of ordering an appetizer and get it as desert? We ended up cancelling it.  This is the only time I've ever not left a tip. Maybe the food taking forever wasn't our waitresses fault but she sure as hell didnt do anything about it since she was too busy conversating.  If you're considering coming here do yourself a favor and make the extra drive to the brea location. This Bj's just has nothing good about it."
Kristina V.,"New York, NY",48,130,22,5.0,5/28/2013,I went for brunch last weekend and had the breakfast pizza and we had an amazing flatbread for an appetizer. My bf got the steak salad. All of it was so good. The service was good too. Great prices too. The menu seemed to go on and one. It reminded me of The Cheesecake Factory. I want to go again for the infamous pizouki (sp?) o_O
John B.,"West Covina, CA",0,2,,1.0,2/12/2016,Worst service ever. Our host seated us 30 minutes ago and no one has even come to take our order. Wanted to leave when the wait went from 30 to 45 minutes but my boyfriend really wanted a pizookie. I will never come back again
Dennis R.,"La Puente, CA",2,32,,3.0,12/24/2014,"Came in today for a few drinks with my girlfriend and had an off experience. When we got here, we decided to sit at the bar since it was empty. We were promptly greeted by Mika (not sure of the spelling). She was friendly and took our order. She had our drinks and food brought quickly. Which was good since the bar was empty. Within the 15-20 minutes, she must of checked on us 3-4 times. This was great. But then she had to leave and switched off with Edward. He was a terrible waiter. He never checked on us. We left our drinks at 1/3 capacity and he never came over. He passed by our table many times, looked in our direction and kept walking. It wasn't until 10 minutes after we BOTH finished our drinks until he spoke to us. We were hoping to have a few drinks but by then, forget it. We asked for the check and left. This is not usual of the experience at BJ's. I cant say it was because it was packed because it wasn't. There was maybe 20 people total."
Jo L.,"Covina, CA",88,279,41,2.0,12/6/2012,"Parking is terrible.  their drinks are absolutely nasty. i had their strawberry something cocktail. my friends got coke and iced tea. all of them are diluted. gross. our server was so out of it. he knocked over something a few times, dropped our silverware while cleaning our table before dessert. one of the knife dropped on my friend! thank god it was only a butter knife. what if it was a steak knife?! no one was hurt but still. he apologized but that was it. he didnt do anything to make up the messed he made. not even a scoop of ice cream for my poor friend. lol"
Samuel L.,"Los Angeles, CA",90,166,6,2.0,8/29/2012,"I've just never been a fan of the food from this franchise. I was going to award this specific location 3 stars but our server made a huge mistake and dishonest mistake that I will talk about later.  quickly: If you want to go somewhere to grab a drink for happy hour then I would recommend this place.  HOWEVER, the food is barely mediocre and overpriced. I'm a pretty health conscious person so if you are calorie counting don't come here. Everything is made of carbs here and is not very helpful with their healthier options.  In my recent visit I ordered: flatbread pizza mozzarella and tomato salad and a Chimay White The beer was great! except that they don't make it so no stars for that.  The flatbread isn't bad at all but it does get boring and a bit dry. They can be a little more generous with the toppings IMO.  THE BAD PART: I was here for a friends birthday. We finished and when we paid the bill we were short a bit. We all pitched in and we were good. We actually realized there was more money than needed since gratuity was already included.  Our server knew that there was more money than needed and I know this because he decided to sit himself down in a seat right next to me organizing the bill. We made eye contact and as I noticed the excess money, he literally snatched the"
Johnson L.,"Manhattan, NY",331,532,169,4.0,12/28/2010,"Yay because we finally have a BJ's in Rowland Heights and I do not have to drive to Brea for BJ's. Meh because I am not a big fan of BJ's food - gets old fast and there is not anything special about their dishes. The environment is nice and this BJ's is super big! It gets super busy too though. It is a nice place to hang out. My girlfriend and I got the Cajun Pasta with Shrimp - it was too oily and honestly nothing special (3/5).  The service here is pretty good. So I give it a 4/5 for a nice group dinner, but a 3/5 for its food. 4/5 for its service"
Debora S.,"Walnut, CA",15,67,1,5.0,7/26/2013,"I've been to this location a few times and every time I've been there....it's been awesome!!!  Just a few weeks ago, my boyfriend and I went for dinner and we literally had the best service I've ever had at any restaurant. Yes, BEST.SERVICE.EVER! I wish I remembered her name cause we went back just a couple of nights ago. It was okay because we had another awesome experience.  We sat at the bar this time and the bartender dude was so nice, helpful, and totally on top of his game. I loved it.  This location sure knows how to provide incredible service!"
T P.,"Orange County, CA",1,510,190,1.0,4/14/2016,"I placed a take out order for 11 soups and salads on a Wed afternoon for next day 11:30 am pick up.   I had also placed an order the past Monday for a Tues pick up at the San Bernardino location WITHOUT any issues.  I received a call at 11:16 am (14 min before my requested pick up time) stating the order would be on hold because the restaurant has received fraudulent on line orders. I was in a meeting with a customer when this call came in.  I called back at 11:23 and confirmed that it was a real order.  I arrive to the restaurant, it was completely empty (now I know why).  A lady greeted me and went to check on the order.  Finally, at 11:38, the order finally comes out.  Because of the delay in this order, I was late to my meeting.  Everyone was there on time and i was 10 min late.  Not a great first impression.  An older, short brown haired lady told me to call and confirm my order.  I'm suppose to place an order on line and call to confirm it?  What's the purpose of on line ordering?  Horrible experience.   I made sure to tell her that I would not be coming back.   Unprofessional customer service.  I absolutely do not recommend or will I return.  Be aware, if your order is over $100, they will hold your order until you call in to confirm it (even if you have a BJ's Premier card number).  I order lunch for my customers 2-3 times a week, too bad for BJ's."
Vanessa C.,"Irvine, CA",246,285,33,2.0,8/28/2012,"I do not go to BJ's often and there's a reason why. In my opinion, the food doesnt live up to its expectations, and I do not have a reason to go back again.  Today I had dinner with my boyfriend, Tuesday night at around 6:30, and there was no wait. We were quickly seated to our cute two person seat. Right next to us, there was a ""bachelorette"" party going on. A dinner of about 15 ladies in their 20's. They were crazy. And throughout my dinner, they were driving me nuts. Why doesn't BJ's have a special room for them? I'm trying to have a nice dinner myself, I do not appreciate the loud drunk ladies throwing a semi party.  We ordered the avocado egg rolls and the BBQ chicken pizza. But guess what. They gave us the wrong pizza. Our waitress was very.. kurt. No words really. Short answers. And obviously did not hear our order correctly. We were hungry, so we dug in. The egg rolls were dry, stuffed with avocado, and nothing else. What about some carrots, onions, some seasoning? Nothing. Very disappointed appetizer. These egg rolls are much better at California Pizza Kitchen. The pizza, was also very disappointing. Instead of the BBQ we ordered, we were given Buffalo something... and it tasted weird. Awkward, as if I was eating buffalo wings on my pizza. Not very good at all. I was a little disgusted with the food to even get dessert, a pizookie. Which was the main reason I wanted BJ's tonight.  We ended up paying very little tip for the poor service, and incorrect order of pizza.  I still have never tried a pizookie. But even then, I will try the dessert and only the dessert. I will not be wasting my time eating their dinners. I'll be happily at California Pizza Kitchen, or the Cheesecake Factory."
Al L.,"Whittier, CA",2,12,1,1.0,8/6/2014,"Went here last night 8/5 around 9:30 in the evening.  I'm glad I ate dinner first and went to the bathroom second.  The server Kenny was excellent, covering for a table that wasn't his.  Food was good.  Then, I decided to go to the bathroom. Trash is overflowing, wadded up paper towels tracked out into the hallway. Counters covered in water and soap, dripping onto the floors. In this condition, I have to doubt that the employees have clean hands. Skipping desert. At a minimum, a lavatory should be wiped down and re-stocked once per hour.  It looks like this went for several hours, or all day.  This is definitely a management issue that shouldn't be ignored. We won't come back to this location."
Kris C.,"Corona, CA",43,151,31,4.0,8/10/2013,"The food was fret, I've never got anything but pizza and I created my own. I reserved a strawberry patch (I think it's the name) the drink was really strong and the flavor was a little off, I got a soda after instead. Our first waiter didn't seem to be to happy to be working, he didn't seem like he had a good attitude. A female took over for him, she said he was going on break but we still saw him working. She was friendly but maybe asked a few times to many if we were doing okay...  We will be back!"
Stephanie B.,"Glendora, CA",0,6,,5.0,2/24/2015,"My husband and I went to this BJ's for Valentine's Day and we got the best server ever! He was so accommodating, very attentive, yet let us have our own space all in one. The appetizer we got were Chicken tenders trenched in buffalo sauce with skinny french fries. And for our main meal we got the Pepperoni Extreme Pizza. To top that off we got the chocolate chip pizookie for our dessert! :) Yummy! ^_^"
Gavin P.,"Walnut, CA",45,4,1,1.0,4/26/2014,Horrible service. My friend got over charged on his check. Our drinks never got refilled. Our orders were wrong. They had short staffing on a Saturday night. Not coming back here.
Ashley H.,"La Habra, CA",36,55,21,5.0,10/21/2014,All I have to say is get JEFF as a server and you will never be disappointed. He has saved the night numerous times. He is the best. The food is good and we love trying new things.
B C.,"Temple City, CA",2,24,2,1.0,7/27/2014,I knew there was a reason why I did not like this BJ's. Every time I try them for to go they messed the orders up entirely. I simply asked for my meal not to have any pickles on it and they put extra pickles on it. Now they're telling me it's going to be another 20 minutes of wait time for them to fix it right very frustrating.
Summer S.,"Los Angeles, CA",54,681,3,5.0,7/20/2013,"Amazing service & great prices for HH!!! We came on the 4th of July and ended up coming at the right time -- it was HAPPY hour! We were very pleased with our drinks and food...and the smiles/great personality shown to us by our server! For what we ordered, we got full for low prices. (pizza, avocado eggrolls, and 2 rounds of beer) We will definitely be back.. :) Good job, RH BJ's!"
M P.,"Pomona, CA",45,152,83,1.0,5/2/2012,"Horrible Service.   We went when it wasn't busy.  We were seated and our waitor dissappeared. It took almost half an hour to get asked if we wanted anything to drink.  Then.. they take forever to bring out drinks.... A different server takes our order, and once again it takes forever. They bring our orders at very different times, so when we got our food, our friends were almost done with theirs. The FOOD:  I ordered the TILAPIA and the rice was HARD and stale. I had to hit it with my fork a few times to loosen it up. No joke. The FISH AND CHIPS were overbattered and extremely salty.  The only thing that was good was the tortilla soup.  We asked 3 different people for Tabasco sauce because the previous 2 had forgotten.... Our cups needed to be refilled and we were not asked for refills until we were done with our food and about to leave.  The WHOLE time we had different servers (4) and were very confused. Bottom Line: POOR MANAGEMENT. FOOD NEEDS SERIOUS IMPROVEMENT."
