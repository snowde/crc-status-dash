janis c.,"Covina, CA",17,9,,5.0,6/11/2014,"I was there Sunday morning with my family . We had a lovely server named Desiree . She was attentive, patient, fast, and was extremely polite. We had an enjoyable meal with excellent service. We will be her new regulars every Sunday. We've been there in the past but we have never experienced such a delightful young lady as Desiree !!!!!!"
Vi V.,"Orange County, CA",281,760,3358,3.0,2/8/2011,"I was in the mood for chicken tenders and I remembered that there was a BJ's close to the Puente Hills Mall so me and my bf decided to go there for lunch. It wasn't super crowded so we didn't have to wait long to get a table.  What we got: Chicken Tenders with Crispy-thin fries: it came with honey mustard and ranch dipping sauce which I did enjoy.  Hand-breaded Chicken Parmigiana: he let me have a couple of bites and I thought it was just okay. Maybe it's because of not a fan of chicken and pasta.  As for the serve, it wasn't bad. The server came back with another strawberry lemonade even if I still had a third of it left =]"
Lyndsey D.,"Walnut, CA",0,16,,4.0,1/3/2016,"I picked up lunch To-go from here yesterday. The woman on the phone was very pleasant and ordering was quick and easy. When I got my food they packed plates as well for the pizza which I thought was nice. The food was good, I had ordered the bjs favorite, five meat, and sweet pig pizzas. The bjs favorite had so many toppings, too many olives for me but I just picked it off. The sweet pig was my favorite out of the three. Bjs favorite and five meat tasted very similar."
Janet B.,"La Puente, CA",4,33,38,4.0,10/9/2014,"Love them traditional hit wings. Always crispy and hot. Besides them I enjoy the avocado rolls..delish. But my dish for tonight was the Mediterranean chicken pita tacos. OMG, if you like these flavors these tacos hit the spot. I ask for fries on the side instead of the salad. Just enough healthy n bad."
Angela A.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",303,40,27,5.0,11/1/2014,"The food was super delicious, and our waiter Michael was super attentive! Great service, he was super funny and caring, and the food was all amazing!"
Jenny S.,"West Covina, CA",122,68,7,2.0,2/16/2012,"THIS BJ'S SUCKED. The service was TERRIBLE. They sat us in and gave us menus..... TWENTY MINUTES LATER, NO ONE CAME TO TAKE OUR ORDER OR EVEN BOTHERED TO CHECK ON US.... THIRTY MINUTES LATER, NOTHING. THE TWO PPL BEHIND US EXPERIENCED THE SAME THING BUT THEY LEFT AFTER 20 MINS....  After finally complaining to one of the waiters, they FINALLY sent a waiter to us and took our orders... Then after apologizing and kissing our asses, we got a free pizookie.  If they didn't give us that free pizookie, I'd give this place only one star."
Hideki F.,"Diamond Bar, CA",201,24,1,4.0,8/11/2014,"Went in with a party of 4 on Saturday night.  I called to see what the wait was and found out that they have a call-ahead list, so I put my name on it.  Within 5-10mins I was sat, and our server Norman was incredibly helpful.  He gave some wonderful ""secret menu"" (modified) suggestions, and had refills coming non-stop.  I definitely would ask for Norman again the next time I go in to eat."
Elias S.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",8,43,,3.0,10/21/2014,I sometimes come here for a beer and appetizers with my girlfriend. It;s not a bad place but sometimes gets so crowded that is annoying to wait for a table. The food is great tho.
Kim N.,"San Francisco, CA",808,354,548,2.0,4/4/2012,Chicken fried steak is really dry! Don't order!
Ivy W.,"Los Angeles, CA",462,375,844,3.0,2/15/2012,"The only variance between this BJ's as opposed to all the others is its service and location. Prices are the same, ambience is the same, food is the same (mediocre at best with the exception of their infamous pizookies). With that said, BJ's is a nice place to chill for lunch and after work. I came here with my coworker for a late dinner, and we were seated right away by a tired (??) waitress who seemed to have no energy at all other than to just ask how many and if we'd like to sit at the bar. Quick run-down?  Location: Awkward. Not much parking space. I could imagine it getting packed and for it to be a nightmare to try to find parking during peak hours. Atmosphere: Relaxing, cushion-y booths, dim. Separated from the bar.  Food/Price: Very huge menu of food. Extensive menu of alcohol. Decent prices. I had 2 appetizers and a pizookie while my coworker had himself a pizza with a beer. Price came out to be under $40. I had the red velvet pizookie for the first time, and it was...interestingly sweet; the ice cream was undeniably delicious though. Small Cesar salad was a-okay. But there's usually nothing special about salads anywhere anyway. Service: Our waiter liked to socialize, and there's nothing I enjoy more than late night small talk. The only problem was that when he brought me my chicken lettuce wrap, all that came out was the lettuce, dips, and carrots. Was I just supposed to eat the lettuce with carrots and dip 'em in the sauce? I'm not a bunny. My coworker asked him for it, and he seemed genuinely sorry that he didn't notice it earlier. We left close to 1AM which was their closing time, although they did drop off the bill maybe 40 minutes (during our meal) before. I hate being rushed to leave, but I really liked our server so I tipped him a little over $12 (yeah, he was that nice!). Overall, 3.5 stars."
Mantis T.,"Goodyear, AZ",12,16,10,1.0,1/10/2012,"*** Just the facts here *** The service I've received was horrible! It was all thanks to our server Bruce. I decided to eat here with my wife on my lunch break. We got seated and ordered our drinks and food around 12:15ish. Our food ( 2 orders of chicken quesadillas ) was served to us at 12:42pm ( A lengthy wait, did they have to kill the chicken?). Our server Bruce only came to our table twice, 1st time to take our order & the 2nd time to give our check ( we had to flag him down to get the check ). Not once did Bruce come to our table or pass by to check up on, he didn't even refill our drinks ( Big taboo for me )! The only employees around us were the bus boys who tried hard not to make eye contact with us. I had to get back to work and we left the establishment at 1:03pm with no tip for our server Bruce.  I called the establishment around 3:30pm later in the day and spoke with the manager Tommy. I asked him about the restaurants soda refill policy and he told me that ""it was unlimited refills"". Then, I told Tommy my experience at his restaurant earlier in the day with his employee Bruce and his ignorance to the restaurants ""unlimited soda refill policy"". Tommy apologized for the poor service that Bruce had given me. I told Tommy; ""I understand that it was busy during lunch but this was the worst service I've had at your restaurant"". Tommy immediately replied; ""We weren't busy at all during lunch today and I apologize again"". With Tommy stating that it wasn't busy during lunch, it solidified my decision to give this establishment 1star. The taste of the food would've bumped the rating to 2 stars but with the poor service any food would leave a foul taste in your mouth. So a message to you Bruce: FUCK YOU!!! God gave you 2 perfectly working legs, so use them properly to do your job you lazy bastard!"
susan l.,"Rowland Heights, CA",264,750,1646,3.0,10/12/2010,"goodbye black angus, hello BJs note: due to their opening, beer is $3/glass! what i ate: - caprese salad (on their small bites menu): tomatoes werent the best, but the perlini and the balsamic vinegar were great. there were also red onions in the salad. what i didnt like was the extra sprinkling of parm cheese on top. seems rather redundant when the vinegar and dressing were salty enough.  - veggie mini pizza: yummy - california club flat bread pizza: bacon, yum, avocado, yum. cheese, yum. whats not to like? a good alternative when youre craving thin crust pizza ambiance: great they totally remodeled the space and it looks like every other BJs service: still working out the kinks - sometimes i was a bit confused as to who our server was because so many were coming by our table constantly asking if we needed anything. but overall everyone was helpful and friendly nothing to complain about. your standard BJs"
Melissa C.,"Anaheim, CA",20,5,3,1.0,2/23/2014,Worst service ever.... Waited 20 minutes for boxes and a pizookie that never came. Waiter came to the table twice... Water never got refilled. Horrible. Would put 0 stars if I could.
Brian C.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",225,149,3,4.0,3/21/2012,"I came by for an early lunch on Sunday.  As expected, there was not wait. I had the Jambalaya which was surprisingly good. It was loaded with scallops, shrimp, chicken and mushrooms. I have to say, it was one of the best Jambalaya's that I have ever eaten, Although, it was not spicy enough for my taste, I highly recommend it. I've tried the pizzas before, not at this location, but it's a little pricey for what you actually get. I'll definitely be back for the Jambalaya and to try their happy hour drink menu."
Rosa M.,"Pomona, CA",104,90,62,2.0,11/13/2011,"Blowjobs......lmao Anyway, the restaurant itself is nice and spacey. The seating is spacious! I hate bumping into our neighbors. I had the Piranha Pale Ale chili cheese burger with the thin cut fries and the orange twist drink.  The burger was bleh. Tasteless but hefty. I'm in a food coma as I type. The fries were good. I blasted everything with ketchup because it was SO frickin' bland! Orange Twist drink was delicious! My diabetes popped wood. $10.95 for burger $2.95 for my orangey goodness. My spawn had a grilled sandwich. He like it enough to want another one. Server was nice but dude was soooooooo busy. It took a LONG while to get our food and even longer to get my spawn's pizookie. Getting a straw for my drink was a mission.  I probably wouldn't come back. I'd just go to the Chili's across the street."
Andrea V.,"Covina, CA",1,16,2,1.0,7/31/2015,"Our waiter had ringworm on his face.   Pretty unsanitary if you ask me.   Also, service was horrible.    Spilled one of our drinks and left us to clean the mess??????"
Henry T.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",401,63,42,4.0,7/9/2014,Food is always great the front hostess and service is hit or miss. Party for 8 at 8:00pm 30 minute wait? Restaurant is half empty. Love the fresh root beer and Pizookie.
Vargas V.,"Norwalk, CA",1,30,7,2.0,8/22/2015,"I'm satisfied hunger wise because I was starving when I got here. I've never had a good experience here! Hubby chose to come here for lunch.. They may be all smiles and giggles but the food is NEVER what the menu says. I ordered a pizza with shredded Parmesan and it had cheap powdered cheese WTF?! Don't make scenes anymore, hubby doesn't like it.. But the quality isn't the same as other BJ's brew houses! Oh well, live and learn.. Will contest coming here again! WACALA"
Vicki C.,"Santa Monica, CA",55,43,2,5.0,7/23/2014,"My parents took me here when i was feeling down. An avocado roll, a deep dish pizza, and a chocolate chip Pizooki cheered me right back up. the avocado roll here is better than the one at Cheesecake factory, mainly because of the sauce they give you. Cheesecake factory is thicker and more tangy, while B.J.'s is thinner and not tangy (it looks like soy sauce). Then I got a mini B.J.s special deep dish pizza, its really deep so I only ate half and I was full. It was like a Costco combo pizza, but with a crust thats fully and really fills you up. the chocoolate chip pizooki should just go without saying. Definitely share it, because its a lot of calories!!"
Bill S.,"West Covina, CA",0,5,,1.0,4/17/2012,"had lunch with my wife here today...MISTAKE! it took at least 40 mins to serve our order...simple tacos and quesadillas! Their lunch specials...it looks big on the pic, but they came out very tiny (bite size)...another mistake! it took us 10 mins to eat it all. the waitress was nice and considerate but she couldn't do anything to speed it up. the place became full 'cause everyone was waiting for their orders!...no one couldn't leave. naturally, the place got really loud and noisy...been to other BJ's, i think this is how it is...just loud! if you're hoping for a quick lunch and get back to work, this is NOT the place! there's always a first time...we learned our lesson...quick lunch or not, never again!"
