Tina N.,"Pomona, CA",4,8,,5.0,3/23/2014,"My friend and I came for an early lunch on 3/23/14 at 11:00.  We were seated right away and greeted promptly by our waitress Bernadette.  She took our drink order as we were trying to decide on an appetizer.  We ordered The Avocado Egg Roll with no cilantro.   A runner brought out the appetizer and Bernadette noticed right away that there was cilantro on it.  She told the runner to bring another order with no cilantro.  We were impressed by her attentiveness.  The Avocado Egg Roll was the most delicious appetizer we ever had.  It had avocado, cream cheese, pine nuts and a hint of pepper; we suggest everyone to try it.   Bernadette kept a good supply of Dr. Pepper coming to the table which is impressive since my friend loves this drink so much.  My friend and I decided on the Great White Pizza.  Bernadette brought out the plates and noticed right away that one of the plates was dirty.  She apologized and brought out another plate.  We were impressed by her observant manner.  The pizza was delicious and creamy.   Overall, our experience was excellent!  Bernadette was cheerful, attentive, observant, and cared about us the customer.  We will definitely come back to BJ's in Rowland Heights and hope to have Bernadette as our waitress!"
Will W.,"Alhambra, CA",3,27,9,4.0,8/11/2015,Came here for a late night happy hour. The prices are decent. The service was kind of slow for being a Monday night. The place was not busy at all. Had to wait a long time to refill drinks or get a certain condiment. The food came out in a decent time. The food was good for the price. Their mini deep dish pizza was very good as well as the poozookie. Recommend both if you don't know what to get. The prices are about average. I would come back again.
Tammy L.,"Glendora, CA",218,105,32,3.0,6/21/2014,"I have mixed feelings about this place. Sometimes the service is nice, sometimes its not. Food is mediocre, but I do like there pizza. Best time to come here is for happy hour but it's usually crowded. I like the fact that they brew there own beers which is a nice change from just bottled beers. There pizzokie is also good, but make sure to share!"
Summer F.,"Pomona, CA",13,1,,1.0,1/16/2015,"We had a party of 24 & we booked a reservation a week in advance to avoid a long wait time. When we arrived, they told us they were booked & we wouldn't  be seated. We waited an hour & a half then asked the hostess what the progress was. She rolled her eyes & told us ""No. You didn't have a reservation."" We spoke to the manager who wasn't helpful AT ALL & didn't offer us anything for the inconvenience. Two and a half hours later we were seated. I can't believe we stayed to eat after the awful unhelpful service, but we knew a party our size wouldn't be able to find another place to eat together. What a nightmare. I never want to go to this BJs again because of the workers!! Customer service is the most important thing about a restaurant. So disappointed"
Linda R.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",0,30,,4.0,9/30/2015,It's always very inviting.  The food is better than most restaurants within the 5 miles radius.  Recommend their appetizers.  They are tasty and well priced.  Their cocktails are very good (recommend apple martini and monitor).  The service is always superb.  Truly recommend.
Kim R.,"Beverly Hills, CA",43,54,,4.0,4/22/2013,"We came here on Saturday evening just to try their Baby Beck Ribs ... they were good. They come with choice of salad or soup for the side order so we chose Clam Chowder Soup, man ... The best Clam Chowder Soup I've ever eaten! Service wasn't that bad (place was really busy that night) but finding a parking space kinda sux though."
Bianca H.,"La Puente, CA",19,39,7,5.0,6/18/2014,"I always enjoy eating at bjs. But tonight I experienced great service and a supremely tasty meal.  Jeff was a really nice server. He took care of us and comped us the desert when the one we wanted wasn't available. We had the calamari which is always tasty here. Our chicken pasta was sooo yummy. I just wish it had more broccoli. Lastly our mixed berry cobbler, which was supposed to be the peach one, but the kitchen ran out, was sooo good. I acted like the little girl from the commercial who did not want to share. Oh and my tea was refreshing. Mocktails!!"
J. B.,"Chino Hills, CA",19,42,29,4.0,6/24/2012,"I must say that I haven't been the biggest BJ's fan in the past....guess I always thought of them as a ""pizza"" place which I'm not so fond of. Anyways, I have come here a few times for lunch and I have to say I have been pleasantly surprised by their lunch menu and what they are offering. The have some great lunch specials as well as some low-calorie options. I'm a huge fan of the chili. I usually order a half chili / half sandwich combo. The next step will be coming here for dinner to try out some different items on the menu. Great for lunch, quick and efficient service, comfy clean environment. Keep putting out quality food and we will keep coming back. Don't Put the Fork Down !!!"
Jenny K.,"Los Angeles, CA",947,1248,244,3.0,10/24/2011,"first time we have visited this BJ's location.  it's smaller than most BJ's.  the deals are good but happy hour stated on the menu was confusing. it says ""Monday through Friday 3 - 7pm  AND  Sunday through Thursday 10pm - close."" we arrive on sunday at 5pm.  she tells us that it's happy hour.  so i'm reading the deals and menus again..  when i ask her about it, she says, ""yes, it is what is written there...EXCEPT that if there is a game on, then it's happy hour during the game.""  basically just no happy hour on saturday.  she told us that the type of game is not specified but football is definitely happy hour.  it's whatever her cashier rings up -- she didn't even know which games made it happy hour.  it's weird because there is always SOME GAME on...but don't know if it's happy hour worthy. other specials: Monday -- All day $5 martinis and mojitos Tuesday -- All day half off wines ordered:  mini pizza -- sweet pig (aka hawaiian pizza) gourmet mac n' cheese (from small bites) fresh mozzarella/tomato salad  flatbread pizza -- margherita food is inconsistent.  we didn't know if it was a new BJs thing or if it was the location.  after readings the reviews, i think it's the latter.  our mini pizza was uneven from the height to the toppings.  one piece did not have cheese...another piece didn't have tomato.  tasted about the same but a bit smaller. fresh mozarrella/tomato salad was tasty but we felt like we were tricked since it looked like half a salad.  the other half just had a zigzag balsamic vinegar on the plate.  flavoring was enjoyable...balls of mozarella, chunks of tomato, chopped basil and red onions. gourmet mac n' cheese was not bad.  rotelle pasta in a cheesy mixture topped with slight bread crumbs and some bacon.  (i prefer elephant bar's mac n' cheese...sooo delicious!!!  you have to try it if you've never had it). flatbread margherita was okay but too wet..  too much cheese that weighed down the flatbread.  (red lobster has a perfect lobster thin crusted pizza) service was fine.  they just really need to up the standard in terms of quality control for the food.  up until this time, i didn't know that BJ's could deviate from the BJ's i have always known and loved.  (cerritos BJ's is much much better!!). i'll probably be back for happy hour.  hopefully the food will turn out better next time.  3.5 stars...rounded down for the inconsistency of the food...  someone needs to talk to the chef."
Rock R.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,19,5,1.0,9/16/2015,"Great food and reasonable prices.  The staff on the otherhand in the Puente Hills restaurant made our first visit our last visit. The hostess sat us down in our booth and murmured something as she walked away.  Promptly Geoff the server asked if we would like some appetizers.  We said it's our 1st time.  We don't know what you have. Oh I'll give you a few minutes, and he walked away without suggesting anything.  10 minutes later he returns again, lacking any kind life, and takes our order. After a reasonable amount of time we receive our entrees. The meal was excellent.  Geoff stop by frequently with a stoic expression asking if everything was alright. We paid, left a 14% tip and walked out. When we got home we see a commercial on TV talking about their two for $25 special which nobody at the restaurant told us about or advertised.  Perhaps the other restaurants may have better staffing, I don't know, but one day in the distant, distant future I'll find out."
Don S.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",189,84,21,2.0,9/14/2011,"Our feelings about our local BJ's Restaurant: FOOD  (Grade: B, Very Good).  My wife and I have been eating here for over a year now and we both enjoy their good foods. A few of our favorites:-------------------------------------------: BBQ Chicken Pizza - One of our family favorites. Cobb Salad - Chopped and ready to eat (they are cheap on salad dressing, so be sure to ask for more, its free). Clam Chowder - my wife loves it and so do I.  They have an excellent recipe and it has LOTS of chopped clams (many restaurants put very little clam in their chowder.   SERVICE IN RESTAURANT  (Grade: C+, Average).  Unfortunately, this is their main problem - one day its ok, and another day its bad.  They are always polite, however, getting service at your table can be a problem.  A number of our friends feel the same on this -  BJ'S, GET YOUR SERVICE IMPROVED!!!!!! SERVICE FOR FOOD TO GO - TAKE OUT  (Grade: D, Poor).  Our server, Stephanie F. took our order for a pizza, salad and soup.  I asked for extra dressing and she said she would get in trouble with her manager - so I told her I would give her $1.00 for 2 extra of their very small containers for salad dressing - and she got it for me!  We were pretty upset we had to pay a tip for extra dressing (By the way, if you eat there, they give you extra dressing for free!  Figure that out!!) PARKING (Grade: A, Loads of free parking). BOTTOM LINE:  WE WILL RETURN, OCCASIONALLY  (MORE OFTEN IF THEY COULD IMPROVE THEIR SERVICE)."
Jenna C.,"West Covina, CA",172,21,,2.0,1/25/2014,"I give this location two stars for their service. The host are rude and are too busy talking or on their phones. It's like really? Do the job your being paid to do. The servers are forgetful, except Desiree she was on point. My food was cold. I couldn't get my first servers attention (not Desiree) to address the problem. I don't think I'll be coming back to this location."
Ash P.,"Chino Hills, CA",71,24,1,4.0,3/15/2012,"BJ's! When you go to a BJ's you know what to expect.  A relaxed atmosphere where you can have a good time with your friends or family.   The location is not bad, kind of secluded.  Parking can be a problem sometimes.  Customer service is improving. Love the Chicken Wings!"
Teri C.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",0,8,,1.0,9/5/2015,"Very disappointed. Called ahead to make sure the game we wanted to watch was on. Get there, won't turn on our game for a good 40 minutes as someone else is watching a (61to 20 score) game. Never mind that most of the people in the bar wanted the same game we came for. We won't be back to this location."
Jeff L.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",10,35,259,3.0,3/13/2014,"Came here for lunch with a group of co-workers.  Menu has a pretty good selection, so there should be something for everyone. Good place to get a drink as they have many varieties of beer, but I am no drinker. Food was alright, nothing special. I ordered the California burger cooked medium with a side of wedge-cut seasoned fries. Burger arrived more of a medium-well and the fries were on the well-done side. The burger itself wasn't bad with the included toppings. Service was above average as the waitress came around twice to fill our drinks and brought out lemon wedges for our water when asked. Several TVs on the wall showing sports, so should be a good choice for March Madness. Overall, place is A-OK for a casual meal, especially during lunch time."
Howard L.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,14,,2.0,8/31/2015,Their waitress steal my credit card info and use it somewhere else.
Cody W.,"Claremont, CA",9,6,1,1.0,9/18/2015,The rudest bearded white cocktail server... He wouldn't acknowledged me or respond... I never leave reviews but this guy earned it
Christine K.,"Los Angeles, CA",301,717,479,3.0,7/15/2011,"So odd...I've never really had any problems at BJ's except for the long wait...at least the ones in Irvine, Cerritos, and Brea. I heard they opened up a couple new Bjs...one in RH and Santa Monica(?). I see now that's it's technically in the City of Industry? Whatever, I'll still call it RH. Either way, I read how people were unhappy with the slow service here, but I didn't really care...how long can a beer order take? haha I got here around 8pm on a Wed night. I think there might have been a 15min wait for a table, which is not bad at all. But the bar was pretty empty, which is great! We order and yes...I already noticed frustrated people around me. Some even just left. Come on people...this is a brewery...relax~ have a beer! hahaha (But I've had those days too where I just can't wait and just so angry I walked out :/) The server did come over and apologize for the wait. I asked her if they had any bread since we were drinking on an empty stomach and she brought us some warm chips and salsa. =) By the time we finished the chips and salsa, our food was out. So it took about an hour. Overall I don't like the setup and vibe as much as Brea's location."
Jennifer F.,"Los Angeles, CA",437,246,279,3.0,7/22/2011,"It's always crowded during dinnertime, but service is always great. The atmosphere is perfect for reunions and social gatherings.  We started off with the Best Beginners appetizer combo which includes spinach & artichoke dip, sante fe spring rolls, mozzarella sticks, and avocado egg rolls. The avocado egg rolls were fantastic!  We each ordered an entree. The BBQ pulled pork sandwich was too salty (and hugely portioned), and the spaghetti with marinara sauce was bland and boring. The scampi pasta and Mediterranean pizza however, were quite tasty.  For dessert, we shared the Triple Chocolate Pizookie--pizza cookie! This was delightful: a giant chocolate cookie topped with chocolate ice cream and chocolate--all Ghirardelli!"
Mimi C.,"Washington, DC",814,2317,481,2.0,7/3/2011,"Meh. . .  I love BJ's Brewery! It's my favorite American eatery  but man, I wish it were better here! Always on the order are sliders  ... I love theirs the most, but this BJ's had dry patties and so so buns. Plus, no side of fries! Apparently, you can get it free w/o charge if you ask for it. So ask! They used to just give it to you as part of the meal. Beef to Bun ratio was not good either. What happened, BJ's?? Also ordered the thai shrimp wraps... must've had too much something in that sauce cuz hubby and I were both drinking tons of water after the meal and after we left.  The saver was the combo pizza. It wasn't too greasy. Service was okay... it was really crowded on Saturday evening so I guess that was expected.  .... about parties ... they do not have a more private/separate room for larger parties. We were sitting next to a table where people were getting really loud cuz they were sloshed. -____-"" We were okay with it, but felt kinda bad for the people with kids sitting around those tables.   ... I may be back for their $5.95 lunch specials though. We were both saying how this BJ's has about 50% asians in it lol. Not a bad thing, just that every other one we've been to the percentage has been less."
