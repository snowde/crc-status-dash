Diana E.,"La Verne, CA",98,85,51,4.0,3/28/2014,Customer service was great and the food came out in a timely manner. Their wings where awesome the burger was average.
Katy Y.,"San Gabriel, CA",15,660,512,4.0,6/13/2012,"Four stars for the food but 2.5 stars for the service. Although the waitress was kind, she was very SLOW. We came in here at almost 2pm for a late lunch and it wasn't that busy on a Tuesday.  The waitress wasn't the brighest. My daUghter spilled water and I had to ask her for paper. She took awhile to come back rather than rush it. My husband ordered a large pizza with everything on it. IT was quite delicious. I ordered a small house salad w/ranch dressing and grilled chicken baked potatoe. Maybe bc I was hungry, but the baked chicken was one of the best I've ever had!!! My toddler was also a huge fan and she's such a picky eater. The layout of the restaurant is also better than monrovia's Bj's bc it's more open space."
Maria M.,"Whittier, CA",1,98,135,3.0,4/30/2014,I really like the Thai Chicken Mango Salad. It's light and refreshing. The wait is usually not too bad but today's wait was pretty long   for our food (45 minutes). Service was good.  We complained to the manager on duty and he barely uttered an apology only saying he has no idea why it took so long. Wasn't impressed with his customer service skills. Probably won't go back as there's no way to go there and back to work in an hour.
Dopin W.,"Chinatown, Las Vegas, NV",0,2,,1.0,2/2/2014,"The attitude of restaurant is very bad, we came to restaurant earlier but waitress let us wait over 40 mins , and she let other customers who came in restaurant later than us go into restaurant first. It's not the first time, my friends said they are racist to different customers, especially for Asian."
Coach I.,"City of Industry, CA",0,44,25,5.0,4/24/2014,this place is always a great place for family and couples nite out !! not a singles place.. but maybe you'll get lucky !! hahaa.. superb food and beer.. long waits though. TVs are sweeeeeeeet !!!
Wilson T.,"San Francisco, CA",304,444,32,3.0,5/7/2012,The pizza is really good. The service is good but slow. the sliders were just alright. It's just that this place is too expensive. Pizza plus sliders was 50 bucks. Too much.
Leti M.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",0,14,,3.0,12/22/2012,I like the food BUT I did not like their customer service. Went to sit at the bar to have some dinner since it would take over half an hour to get seated and the bartender was being very rude. My friend asked for a beer and waited half an hour and never got it so we asked one of the girl bartenders for it and she served it within five minutes.
Richard P.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",102,18,13,5.0,12/26/2013,Had a great reasonable priced lunch. The waiters and managers are cool peeps. The Asian manager with the red shirt is always attentive and ready to help. Will be back soon.
Susan L.,"Rowland Heights, CA",315,169,242,4.0,4/6/2012,"Bjs is the spot to go if you want to hang out and have some good food and drinks. I just hate how long the wait can be on busy nights. I always my usual here which is there Cajun Shrimp pasta and a glass of my favorite wine. They have options like lower calorie dishes or small bites for those that aren't too hungry. I have tried there Southwestern salad, Tilapia and Chicken dish (its the lower calorie entrees), all there pastas, meatloaf, pot roast dish, love there appetizer: avocado egg rolls, thai shrimp lettuce wraps, spinach and artichoke dip and many others.  The food here is really good and I haven't had any complaints about it, just that it take a while for it to come out. I especially love there pizookie! It is a must have here! A warm cookie any flavor you want (I love white chocolate macadamia nut) with two scoops of vanilla bean ice cream.. DELISH! This is the place to go when I want to eat good food and hangout with friends."
Stapawa W.,"Seal Beach, CA",1,8,,1.0,7/16/2015,"Bj's --  Food and Drinks are always good, HOWEVER the Manager at 5.30pm Wednesday 7/15 has no problem having guest be inconvenience by NOT allowing the umbrellas to be moved to  block sun light.  Her reasoning ---  that it was to close to the out door heater and they are not allowed to be moved, the umbrellas.  None of heaters were on as the temperature at that time was well into the 80's and unlikely to be turned on at all, its summer time!!! .   Shame on you."
Gary H.,"Knoxville, TN",8,5,,5.0,5/20/2014,one word.... PIZOOKIE! Get the triple chocolate and then don't be surprised by your sugar high.
Gaby G.,"Rowland Heights, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/11/2015,"Really bad service, slow even at restaurant half capacity. we didnt get silverware so how they expect we eat our food, I asked ""no onions"" on my food and thats the first thing I got. Took more than 20 min to get a beer and a box. Don't go there bad service bad food."
Teagan T.,"Los Angeles, CA",261,518,876,1.0,4/21/2011,"----   This review is for their food only  **   --------------- Long story short, You come here for the ambience and beer. Their food...  or maybe it just depends on the chefs at different locations. But this place, food was not fresh, lack of flavor. Just ..  very disappointed. I've tried other BJ's and they weren't that bad.   Service was attentive. Not coming back to be a regular."
Sophie D.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",54,98,55,4.0,10/6/2013,"This is a great place for planning large parties.  (homecoming, birthday dinners, etc...)   The food was great!  Maybe it was due to the fact that by the time our food came out (which did take a while because we had so many people) I was starving.  I shared the medium BBQ chicken pizza with my friend.  It was a pleasant amalgamation of sweet and savory, the perfect blend of BBQ and ooey cheese.  The crust is crispy and the pizza is not at all dense nor greasy.  It was great!  Just make sure you eat it quickly or else it does get a bit soggy towards the end.   I'd come back to try more of their pizzas, pastas, or pizookies.  I woudln't suggest coming too often.  My other friend ordered a pasta and the portion size was nothing short of gargantuan.  Definitely not a great place to come if you are trying to watch your waistline. But you know...there's always room to indulge."
Jay C.,"Ontario, CA",55,68,9,3.0,5/13/2011,"Went with a large group. I guess the waiter already knew that he's gonna get his guaranteed tip so he came by our table for about 4 times the entire night. Yup... 3 times... first time to take order, second time to bring the drinks, third time to bring food, and fourth time to bring over more water and drinks... and then we got our check. It was almost impossible to ask our waiter to come over. I think he spends more time with the couple sitting at the table next to us. For a large group of 15, I'd definitely think he should come by more often and ask us if there's anything else we need and take care of us. Enough said about the bad service... or should I say ""no service""? Avocado Egg Rolls, BBQ Chicken Chop Salad, and pizzas taste really good. I've been here a few times and no all menu items taste great but the ones I got tonight definitely made up for the service."
Robert M.,"Chino, CA",65,285,2,4.0,1/12/2012,"BJ's is a BJ's is a BJ's, right? Well, sort of. But I do really like the design of the bar here. It doesn't seem to be a crowded BJ's; Sunday playoff games last weekend did not bring many sports fans, at least. They have a nice array of guest taps; not always the case at BJ's. Since   they centralized brewing and one can't get much in the way of variety or experimentation other than a regular seasonal any longer, it's nice to have a choice of Green Flash or Lost Abbey and some other good ones.  The service on the few occasions that I've visited has been cordial and effective. I also appreciate its proximity to Costco, making the up-to-2-hour wait for a tire rotation less painful."
Melanie T.,"Los Angeles, CA",181,48,55,4.0,1/30/2011,"Me and my boyfriend like to come here for their lunch special. I usually order the giant baked potato and he orders a sandwich. Overall the food is great, I knocked off a star because somehow they put cheese and bacon on my SALAD instead of my potato. Weird, right? Oh and I also like their scampi pasta :D!  The service is great and a couple of my friends from high school work here too so it's nice seeing them."
Jennifer C.,"Chino, CA",662,949,866,4.0,5/21/2011,The beer here is excellent n not too pricey...known for their deep dish pizzas which do not disappoint and of course the potato skins r always delish...great place to unwind after work or watch the game
Alexandra W.,"Brea, CA",24,8,2,5.0,10/22/2013,Always come here for sports events or even for dinner or a quick drink. We always sit at the bar. The bartenders are so great! Always recognize me and my boyfriend and always try to make conversation with all the customers they have. Love it.
Tiffany N.,"West Covina, CA",340,547,167,4.0,11/8/2011,This place is pretty new so its super clean & stylish inside. The parking kinda sucks though ( depends on which days you go) but the food is always good.
