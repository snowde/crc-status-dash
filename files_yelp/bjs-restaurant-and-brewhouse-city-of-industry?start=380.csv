Blair M.,"Oakland, CA",68,108,22,2.0,12/24/2010,"BJ's and me are the same age and I've been coming here (well, not this location) since I was a little kid.  Like any long term relationship we've had our ups and downs.  But we've been through thick (crust) and thin.  I used to take dates to the Balboa location when I was in high school. But I think it's time now we go our separate ways, irreconcilable differences and all that jazz.  BJ's used to be a Chicago style pizza joint with a few locations. With a new century came new financial success for BJ's as it turned into a Chain Restaurant.  And thus the seeds of this not too amicable divorce were sown. The pizza has been going downhill as part of the chain-ifacation process which eliminate uniqueness and character and commodifies and uniforms the food.  Each location used to be different.  Now when I am in Tucson I can walk into a BJ's, blindfolded and know where everything is.  This location is on a restaurant row with a Red Lobster.  Nuff said?  About the chain aspect perhaps. But I' not here to bash chain restaurants.  Much. This visit: Service - 1 star Annoyance 1: The hostess made us wait while 'our table was being cleaned.'  When we were finally seated it was next to a clean table that I had been eyeballing from the moment we walked in, in the same section with the same waiter. Annoyance 2: The waiter, Ivan, was awful.  Dirty dishes remained on our table, taking up space, despite us asking 3 times for him to remove them.  Drinks were never refilled.  There was a problem with our order that we were not informed of until the food was brought out.  In short, we were ignored. Annoyance 3: We ordered a large pizza, half Mediterranean, half Sweet Pig.  They ran out of large dough (?! - again, a problem that would only occur at a chain restaurant) and instead brought us a small and a medium.  While I appreciate the solution, we didn't appreciate that the waiter took it upon himself to make this decision.  Ask us, the customers, what we want when there is a problem.  The problem with what he decided was that they did half and half on both the small and the medium resulting in neither being neatly done and everything getting all mixed up. The food - 1 star Continuing with the above, the pizza toppings were sloppy resulting in 2/3 of the slices being kinda gross really.  The other slices managed to only have their intended toppings.  And it seems that the chefs forgot how to cut pizza slices - the sizes ranged from 1/3 the pan, to ritz cracker sized.  I would have complained, but my waiter was never around and my table was too hungry. For appetizers we got the Fried artichoke hearts and the stuffed mushrooms.  The former were great and the latter were ok.  I might have regarded the mushrooms better, but they're just mushroom caps stuffed with their spinach-artichoke dip."
Chandler M.,"Houston, TX",91,283,10,4.0,12/17/2011,"This BJ's is one of around 25 casual-dining places in the Puente Hills Industrial-commercial complex, along with every American chain restaurant known to man. In other words the competition to stay delicious is a big deal when I have so many alternatives. I don't honestly know how the economics of this area works.  ANYWAY It's a BJ's. Fantastic deep-dish pizza; My friends and I went for the cheeseburger pizza and it was marvelous. The house-made cream soda was very odd-tasting but the fresh Root beer was fantastic. Our waiter allowed us to swap out when we told him the creme soda wasn't expected. Very nice gentleman who checked on us often - I think i gave him a 40% tip for what he helped us with! All in all there was nothing really to complain about. the decor was standard BJ's with a lot of sports on TV and a whole lot of people talking and eating. It smelled good. My stigma against BJ's has all but disappeared after so many good experiences with them.  We also ordered the Pizookie sampler with ice cream and that was very enjoyable.  I'm not really a Happy Hour Guy (my work schedule started at 6pm so I never got them anyway) but this seems to ahve a good happy hour.  I'd come here again if I was in a pizza mood and around Puente Hills (which means I'm at Round One most likely)."
Aldo R.,"El Monte, CA",127,41,7,4.0,12/8/2011,"Great place! I love the beer selection, and the cocktails are pretty good too. The pizza is delicious and the pizzookie, well u just can't got to BJ's without trying it. And the Best beginnings appetizer is just great!"
Je N.,"Fullerton, CA",100,7,15,1.0,3/26/2013,The service is terrible here asked the water when i sat down 10 minutes passed where is my water? I have to go to speak with the front desk to get the attention of the staffs so I can get myself a cup of water. Then the manager came apologize and picked up the tab. I certainly will not come again. I feel i am being discriminated in this place.
Rena H.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,55,1,2.0,6/12/2011,"While I'm normally a fan of the food and beer at BJ's, I'm probably not quite a fan of this particular location of BJ's. Until I'm convinced that their service isn't going to be wiggidy whack, or unless I've got my pre-party on beforehand to the point of which service doesn't matter, I'm not sure if I'm going to frequent this location. I came here for a friend's birthday with my boyfriend and my friend's brother who had just moved here. We were seated without much of a wait, and we got our glasses of water right away. A few minutes later, our server plops down a plate of avocado egg rolls that we didn't order. So I notify him that we had not ordered those, to which he responded, ""Oh, but didn't you order these? I had asked you if you wanted avocado egg rolls and you said 'yes.'"" Now I'm thinking, okay, this guy is just making stuff up. So I tell him that no, I di'in't, and he promptly took them away. We ordered our food and everything was beautiful and tasty. We also notified the server that it was our friend's birthday. Now, we had ordered an additional pizookie because our friend had a cold and was worried that we'd catch whatever he had. So that pizookie was brought out, but his birthday pizookie hadn't. I'm not complaining about not receiving a free pizookie, but THEN our same weird server remembered at a random time and he told us he was bringing TWO. That would be a total of 3 pizookies. Uh what the heck. My friend quickly said, ""NO! I DON'T WANT TWOOOO--"" but the server was gone, and while he was, my friend joked, ""Oh my god, if he brings two, no tip for him. That's just overdoing it."" HA... We did leave some tip though, being the good citizens we were. Maybe I shouldn't hate on this BJ's, but the service was just TOO weird. Too bad I don't remember the guy's name... but if I do come here again, I don't want him as our server."
Hope C.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",120,36,,1.0,11/22/2012,"What a terrible, racist establishment! Awful awful service!! My coworkers and I used to come here for happy hour from time to time, until about a month ago when the manager told us we were cut off after TWO pitchers of beer between EIGHT people in the timespan of over two hours. For being too loud. NEWSFLASH: it's the bar area, people are talking, people are watching sports, it's gonna be loud, PERIOD. We're a large party talking in a noisy-ass room, we have to raise our voices just to be heard by the person sitting across from us. So chalk it up to one bad manager with a stick up his ass. Returned last night to the BITCHIEST waitress I've ever had the displeasure of encountering. I arrived after the other four members of our party. We asked for another plate because the table had been set for four, silverware because there was NONE,  some napkins because we hadn't been provided silverware so no cloth napkins (such simple logic), and a glass of water. This waitress had the audacity to roll her eyes at us and say with not a small amount of attitude, ""Is there ANYTHING ELSE I can get for you?"" I'm sorry we're a party of chatty Asians asking you for things you should have already provided us (or at the very least not have been surprised to be asked for), blondie.  No need to get all uppity. I wouldn't be surprised if she spat into the water, that's how venomous her attitude was. Doing things like sighing so hard I could see her doing it whenever she approached our table. The worst service I've ever experienced from any BJs. In fact, one of the best servers I've ever had there, consistently, was a waitress who looked really high. I don't want to say she definitely was, because hey, maybe homegirl has red eyes from allergies (on at least 2-3 separate occasions...), but if she WAS, maybe the other wait staff should follow her example so they can CHILL THE F OUT. Also the food is super greasy and the pizza toppings aren't fresh. If I want a brew after work, I'm going to take my business to one of the thousand and one other places in the area that serve alcohol and NOT get the third degree. NEVER AGAIN. Not even if you paid me."
Alondra R.,"La Puente, CA",0,3,1,5.0,2/28/2014,"So I came to BJs craving a well done steak, I asked the waiter what was the difference between a Rib Eye steak and Top Sirloin steak. He said the Rib Eye was a more fattier cut and the Top Sirloin was a more lean cut. I wanted my steak thick so assuming that the waiter meant thick when he said ""fattier"" I went with the Rib Eye. After I received my delicious-looking plate, I began to dig in! I noticed that my steak started tasting a little gooey, then I looked at the inside of it and there was FAT mixed in my steak! Maybe I misunderstood the waiter when he mentioned the fattier portion of the steak, so I admit it was a fault on my part. I mentioned to my waiter that I wasn't satisfied with my steak and followed that by asking if I could get a Top Sirloin steak instead. I also mentioned my confusion about the two, but he apologized about that and said I would be able to receive my steak the way I desired free of charge. He acted in a very polite manner, and to top it off my Top Sirloin steak was amazingly delicious. Thank you for the wonderful customer service Michael G! :)"
Sarah C.,"Burbank, CA",892,1083,59,4.0,10/10/2010,"Newly Opened BJs Brew, Pizza, Pizookie and more. Menu same as other locations, large restaurant with plenty of plasma screen tvs, bar, indoor and outdoor patio seating, plenty of parking.  Not really my cup of tea but the service and place is great."
Adam N.,"Seal Beach, CA",333,202,94,4.0,2/1/2013,Great tomato and mozzarella plate. Barbacoa tacos ain't half bad either!!
Stefan M.,"Walnut, CA",25,7,2,5.0,3/21/2015,"We had good service on a sat night. We were offered a complimentary slice of pizza whole waiting for our table. Food was good. I had a bison burger. It was cooked rare. That might turn off some people being rate, but not me. Overall good time."
Vince M.,"Chino, CA",50,21,1,1.0,12/19/2013,This review is based on the treatment received while on the bar area. We were spoken to like children. We got the instructions the first time around and that should be enough!
Ann C.,"Chino Hills, CA",715,545,480,3.0,12/3/2010,"KITCHEN KINKS I love BJ's (that's what she said) but this location has to work out the kinks in the kitchen.  I've been here 3 times since they opened and twice there were issues with the food. Once, the tomato mozzarella salad came out with the cheese still frozen solid!  I don't know how the chefs in the back couldn't have seen the ice all over the cheese balls.  I had food poisoning for 4 days after that.   Yesterday, I went with a group of 6 and the food took forevers to come out.  When it did, the pizza was luke warm and dried out.  BBQ chicken should be saucy and fresh but it was just gross.  Our waitress did have it remade but again, how could the chefs let that kind of food out? I hope that this is just the disarray of a new restaurant opening and they work it out.   Order their avocado egg rolls- BOMB DIGGITY!"
Nicole K.,"Huntington Beach, CA",72,21,,4.0,5/19/2012,"Met my boyfriend here after work last night--it's great because it's RIGHT NEXT TO Speedzone (great gokart place--he was able to drive on over after his speedzone day to meet me). Got a steak--usually go with sharing a pizza, and it was really good. His pasta dish took about 45 minutes and the manager came out to offer us dessert as compensation. Had a double chocolate pizookie. Overall, great food, great atmosphere... I recommend this location because of their awesome tv screens--great to watch a Lakers game on. :-)"
Jennifer C.,"Buena Park, CA",77,268,233,4.0,9/2/2013,Our server was great.  We had a great time.  Took us for ever to determine what we wanted to eat.  The server was helpful and patient.
Megan A.,"Fullerton, CA",4,6,,4.0,4/22/2013,BJ's was a fun restaurant to go to.  I loved their bacon cheeseburgers (which were the size of my head).  The staff is very welcoming as well.  My friend ordered a pizza and they brought it out completely wrong!  They gave us a refund for the pizza and made it again which was very nice.  I just hope the cook didn't spit in her food!  I suggest coming to this restaurant if you are ready to get stuffed.

Grace C.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",500,117,30,5.0,12/10/2010,"This BJ's has some really good food. For some reason, the BJ's here was exceptionally better than the BJ's in the Los Angeles area. This place just opened recently and the decor is really nice. Service was excellent! Try the broccoli cheddar soup if you're a big fan of cheesy, creamy soup. The original french roast dip with horseraddish HITS THE SPOT, and the boyfriend really enjoyed his california burger -- more like a sandwich, it was had angus beef with avacado, pepper jack cheese and more, on top of garlic toast. Lots of TVs to watch, and a full bar."
Tiger L.,"Diamond Bar, CA",344,72,11,4.0,2/2/2013,Who doesn't like BJ's? Good selection of food. Good atmosphere. No complaints.
Erniie M.,"La Puente, CA",3,2,1,1.0,3/2/2014,"Great service, great waitress! She's soo cute & polite & attented us at all time. But I shall give it a one star cause they removed the red velvet pozookie!"
Andrea H.,"CA, CA",53,170,353,4.0,3/2/2011,"A typical brewery place to come out, enjoy a drink or two with some friends as I watch Lakers game.  Basically, I was in the bar area not sure how the regular services are if seated in the sitting area.  I love their appertizers... so I order potstickers, stuffed mushroom, and tuna but I really enjoy their pazookie!!!   Yummie *0* The bartenders (Chris) was very friendly and made sure we were okay with our drinks.  I've been to other BJ's (Brea) and never had any problem with their services."
Tiffany C.,"Whittier, CA",9,50,,5.0,12/12/2010,"This is my first time at a BJs restaurant believe it or not. We ordered:  1. Mediterranean Pizza  2. Crispy Chicken Sandwich with thin cut fries  3. Spinach and Artichoke dip  4. Southwest rolls? Very filling and there was plenty left over. I felt like I was going to explode. The service was very good, the waiter was attentive and nice."
