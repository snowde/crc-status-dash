Yushan W.,"Monterey Park, CA",1025,542,1578,3.0,5/19/2016,"Came here with my coworkers for lunch. This place is huge and it was not crowded at all during lunch hours. I can see this place getting crowded during sports game season since they have a lot of beer selection and TV. Just like every other chain restaurant selling American food, there is really nothing to rave about for the food here. Their food portion was also huge. My favorite was their avocado egg rolls because I am personally an avocado lover and they combine two delicious food together, fried item and avocado. It was super crispy and delicious. I also had their pasta item but it was huge and flavor was totally off. Parking is plaza parking."
Randy L.,"Irvine, CA",144,224,326,5.0,7/14/2016,The food was great and the service was excellent. Ask to be seated in ANDREW's section. Andrew was very professional As is the entire serving staff.
Lesley C.,"West Covina, CA",422,521,24,2.0,7/9/2016,"I think BJ's just really want to dry us out with their overly salty food. Or try to make money from us by having us want to order more drinks to quench our thirst.  Two for $25 2x Chowder Bowls 1x Large Mediterranean 1x Peanut Butter Pizookie They had the 2 for $25 deal a few weeks back and I thought to try out BJ's again, since it's been years. Not only was I super disappointed with the taste of the chowder bowls and the Mediterranean Pizza, I really just had a hard time finishing most of my half of the meal. Halfway through, I just really wanted to dump everything, except for the Pizookie because my health is more important than a couple of bucks. Learned my lesson. Don't ever come here for food.  Other than the food, takeout service was swift. Phoned in my order and it was ready by the time I had arrived for pick up. There was a bit of confusion as how to process the 2 for $25 in the register but a manager helped the staff out."
Jennifer I.,"West Covina, CA",2,5,3,5.0,2/24/2017,Try the BBQ salmon. IT IS LIFE CHANGING. I love mashed potatoes& I love salmon but depending how it's prepared it may taste fishy. The bbq sauce gives it a sweet flavor & the sides are sorta burnt (but not too burnt to a crisp) taste. The crispy onions & broccoli make a really good pair. I loved the salmon so much I overlooked my white cheddar mashed potatoes.
Tracey N.,"Cerritos, CA",75,51,29,1.0,6/21/2016,"Customer Service was awful.  I can understand a long wait for food if the kitchen's backed up. I can understand not getting our food order right away.  But I cannot accept a poor attitude with it.  Been here several times with coworkers during lunch, so didn't think any issues going to BJs for lunch.  Unfortunately we came on a day where our waitress had the worst attitude imaginable.   Knew there was a problem when she took our order.  When my boss had a question about a deal he saw on the app, she quickly threw down his throat she has 6 other tables that need help, and that shell take care of it at the end.   She never came back to apologize for the wait, forgot to bring out my coworkers hot water.  But surprisingly, she was attentive to the surrounding tables around us.  I'm sure their experience was much better than ours.   50 min after ordering with no food, we decide we can't be any later back to work, and ask for our food to be boxed up.  My boss again ask the waitress politely, and she quickly tells him ""well its coming out now"".  10 min later, our food comes out from a different waitress, plated.  Again we explain we need it boxed up, so we could all eat at our desk at work. Its just unreal how poor this experience was.  No one was yelling or being rude to her, we just wanted to leave in peace at this point.  Of course, our bill is wrong, and we have to get her attention to fix it.  Whole experience took 1 hour and 45 min, without eating a thing...   And again, what really irked all of us about this experience was how unapologetic she was.  If she had just showed any customer service, where I could really see it wasn't her fault, I would've been fine about the whole experience.   But unfortunately, this experience has left a poor taste in my mouth for BJs."
Stephanie R.,"West Covina, CA",1,13,5,1.0,10/21/2016,"I really hate that this is the closest Bjs location for me. The employees at this location give the worst customer service. Most of the servers (I've been here many times and have been served by most of the regularly staffed waiters/waitress) do not know how to smile, make eye contact or even give an inviting hello. It seems like many are so stuck up! It baffles me how so many people are staffed here and no one seems to even want to be there. I'm not a hard to please customer but I do know what's to be expected in proper customer service.  I can't even list the amount of faults this location has bc it will be never ending.  However my last experience was far too much. My sister and I spent over 2+ hours on this specific Monday night waiting and waiting for just 1 pizza and 1 pizookie. Our waiter never did care to help us and never offered us refills or brought utensils after bringing our food so cold and late. (We waited so long we just ate without even caring for the temp) yada yada. Not cool. We also ordered a pizookie and waited and waited and when I made eye contact with the waiter he was was ""shocked"" that we hadn't received our desert and came back with a almost black cookie! SO hard and cold! And said ""enjoy"" !?! It was so unbelievably burnt and he still brought it out thinking it would be presentable?! Wow.   I practically chipped my tooth trying to eat that ""pizookie"".  Oh well. The experience wasent as shocking to me bc I've had many experiences like the one mentioned above at this location.  I have spoken with HR or whatever or wherever they're complains go to with no help at all.  Overall, very bad location, won't be coming back. Ever."
Julianne J.,"Rexburg, ID",0,7,,5.0,8/14/2017,My husband and I both really enjoy the chicken Alfredo and their homemade root beer. Both are delicious! We also appreciate their late hours.
Ophelia C.,"La Puente, CA",2,14,4,1.0,5/23/2017,"I don't know why I keep giving this BJ'S a chance - I'm so done. Service is still TERRIBLE!!! The server I got this time took forever w/everything. I didn't get my drink until I was 1/2 done with my meal, she'd forget side dishes etc. We got a nice ""rolling of the eyes"" when we'd remind her about our food. Go to West Covina, they're always nice and attentive."
Tao L.,"Chatsworth, CA",43,11,5,2.0,2/11/2017,"2 Stars for good pizza and jambalaya. Service was abysmal. Came in around 10PM with a party of 5 to a decently full restaurant. Initially staff was attentive. As time went on, service became non-existent. Waited 30+ minutes for a pizookie to come out, and the thing was room temperature. Server never bothered to bring us the check until we went and asked for it. I've never had a bad experience at a BJ's before this. Avoid this location."
Bill L.,"West Covina, CA",1,3,,1.0,8/14/2017,"This is probably the worst BJ i've ever gotten. The service is terrible, and on my birthday too! When i got my free pizookie, they didn't even sing happy birthday to me! Horrible!"
Mel B.,"Ewa Beach, HI",345,601,5729,5.0,6/9/2015,"I've been to several BJs but mostly to the West Covina location.  To find out there actually was one now in Hacienda Hts., in my neck of the woods, was interesting and  a good suggestion by Mark M. to hook up at. It was my last night to be back in town and I was looking forward to a relaxing meeting with a fellow yelper I met online.  It was real kewl to find out we had very similar interests and that he actually visited my area of business many, many times but we never met. The place looks amazing with it's awesome ambiance.  Not too noisy.  As I we sit the waitress introduces herself and gives us time to order.  It's been awhile and I'm interested to find out what they have in their home brew selection.  However, Mark H. orders a drink, forgot the name, and it just sounded interesting.  Some sort of tropical, fruity drink.  I tell the waitress let me have the same. When it is delivered, it looks like a Tequila Sunrise (no tequila though) and tastes very similar.  Just what I needed to relax. Mark M. and I start talking getting familiar with ourselves enjoying the stories and  discovering other likes.  The waitress checks in on us on occasion to see if we need anything else.  As we continue into the night, the shift manager introduces herself and starts to check with us for the rest of the night.  I see the 1st waitress but for some reason the shift manager or maybe supervisor checks with our status.  We're milking the 1st drink.  I just didn't want to drink any more on this trip knowing I'll be flying the next day, back to reality. I enjoyed the hospitality and the new friendship made and look forward to his trip to the islands later this year.  When I am back here again you can bet your bottoms up I will be visiting this BJs with a bunch of me amigos!!"
Frances Y.,"Anaheim, CA",0,19,,3.0,7/16/2017,Poor service . One person in party did not get his food with everybody else.  At least the manager comped him  Poor guy had to woof down his food because we were on a time schedule.  Chicken on salad was dry .  Other person had a chicken breast that was pounded so flat that it looked like cardboard.  Need improvement!!
Tom V.,"West Covina, CA",262,84,590,1.0,2/19/2017,"Worst service ever!!!  We were a party of 11. They told us they were super busy and the wait would be one hour.  Finally were seated.  Order taken without issue.  Evening turned south when meals arrived. They brought the wrong soup. Asked for tortilla and was given tomato. Told them it was wrong.  They said oh ok and walked away. Had to wait for his return (bearded server) and had to convince him to fix it. He brought the correct soup and had the nerve to charge for both soups. The tortilla soup was completely not edible. Tasted like Herdez warmed up in the microwave. Never came back to check on us. Was trying to avoid us? Finally when it was time to pay, we did ask for separate checks. He told us he could only break it up to 4 separate checks. He waved his arms at us as he walked away saying for us to figure out. We would have tipped him really good for our size group. But his actions, behavior, and quality of food told us otherwise. So avoid this location. There are better restaurants next door and across the street."
Ray L.,"Irvine, CA",241,452,927,4.0,4/21/2016,Back again.... This time I bought another friend...we had a pitcher of Blonde...and then Fried Calamari...then a medium sweet pig pizza.  I was full.   The beer and foods were good. This is a good place.
LenaNbul R.,"La Puente, CA",6,28,106,1.0,9/19/2016,Service was awful and they served up a desert the was bad rotten or something it's smelled like BO no joke I even had the waitress smell it she was like OMG WHATS THAT SMELL !! Yeah never again!!!!
S-Goddess V.,"La Puente, CA",132,686,3865,1.0,2/18/2016,"Once a week I take my parents out to lunch and we normally have asian food, but this time I wanted them to try something different.  I decided to take them here...  Our server was wonderful, however, the reason for my single star review is for the boy that brought our food.  When I placed our order I specifically asked for ranch on my salad, and EXTRA ranch ON THE SIDE.  When the kid brought out the two plates, I immediately noticed there was NO ranch on the salad, he seemed as if he was in a hurry so I informed him that there was no ranch on the salad and that I had asked for ranch and ranch on the side. He looks to me and says, ""Yea, well I only have two hands"" then walks away, I was in disbelief in his response that all I could say was ""OH"" as he walked away after just having processed his response, I was pissed because my parents noticed how rude he was, my father blamed his age and told me not to make a big deal out of it, but I just cant!!!  He had to be handled, his age is no excuse for his behavior.  He brought A SINGLE RANCH with his TWO hands, didn't say a word, set it on the table and left. I wanted to say so badly, ""YOU HAVE TWO HANDS BUT BROUGHT OUT ONE RANCH?!"" But my parents were present so I had to maintain my good girl behavior.  Shortly, after that, I walked straight up to the receptionist and asked to speak to a manager. I waited there for a good while, manager was a no show. The girl finally came back out and told me that I could sit back down and the manager will walk over to our table. twenty minutes finally pass, our food came out, manager finally arrived and listened to what I had to say, she seemed as if she sympathized, but I doubt it. I've been a manager in customer service work for years and I know that customer service is critical in a striving business, I understand that a customer's satisfaction should be the utmost priority, she did not attempt to make us happy, NOT that I was expecting anything for free. But she could have at LEAST asked if she could bring us anything.  ten minutes passed and the kid comes back to the table he tells me that his manager told him that he was being rude to us, he looked at me and I straight up said the same thing I told his manager.  His response: ""yeah Im just tired I guess""  Uhh, really? I'm a full time student AND work 12-13 hour days the days I don't have school--so, being tired is NO EXCUSE!  Might I add, he was walking away while I was still talking to him, so I guess he is just a tired incompetent kid. I will not be back!"
Gilbert L.,"West Covina, CA",0,4,,5.0,10/10/2017,"10/7/17, not really familiar with the city of industry and as I drove through the city looking for something to eat I passed by this Bj's. I stopped by Bj's for dinner and as soon as I stepped In I was greeted very nicely by the hostess which made me feel really welcomed. I believed her name was Marsala and I was seated very quickly the atmosphere was really great and the food was really good. Leaving the restaurant the hostess even said goodnight and a thank you for coming, really positive atmosphere and will definitely be returning back. Thanks !"
Auau V.,"West Covina, CA",271,77,8,1.0,5/21/2017,"I had the prime rib... It wasn't very good. They served it without au jus ... So I asked for some a few times before they brought it . The meat was cold and hard . The au jus was sweet , which I'm not use to . I'm use to prime rib au jus savory . I just wasn't impressed at all. A bit disappointing."
Belle L.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,25,22,1.0,6/12/2017,"Such awful customer service! We waited 10 minutes for drinks, 20 mins to order and we had to ask for bread which took 20 mins to come out...when we asked the waitress for water with no ice she rolled her eyes and said ok....like what! And when we complained to the manager he didn't even say sorry or compensate us with anything."
Nicole C.,"Downey, CA",0,7,6,1.0,9/5/2016,Me and my boyfriend love bj's. But we didn't like this specific bj's. We got a table right when we walked in which was good because I'm a person who hates to wait for a table especially if I'm starving. But we got sat down and it took someone 20 min just to ask if we wanted water. That's just bad customer service for me. I asked the waiter for a discount because no one should wait that long to be asked for a cup of water.  We ordered our food right there and than & got our food fast but it was just the worst experience at this bj's. & the general manager was thoughtful and took 10$ off our check. But I will never go back here. I would rate 0 if it was possible but for taking $10 off our check you guys can have 1 star. ;p lol
