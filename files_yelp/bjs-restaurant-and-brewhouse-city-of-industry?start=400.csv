Andrea C.,"San Dimas, CA",3,8,8,5.0,10/31/2013,"Turns out on Thurs nights they have happy hour til 9 (maybe for football season) so our beers were $3.50.  They also have a great $19.95 special which includes, soup or salad, a medium pizza and a pizooki! When my husband and I go to BJ's we always have the Great White pizza, so this was right up our alley. Sometimes the pizza is dry, so we ask for extra alfredo sauce but tonight the pizza was on point! You can imagine then how disappointed I was when on the way home I realized I had left it behind.  I went back and they had already thrown it away. Dang. But the manager was kind enough to make us a new pizza. Gotta give them 5 stars for that. Thanks!"
Caleb F.,"Tysons Corner, Mclean, VA",36,193,2,5.0,9/19/2011,"One of the few places I will drink a beer from... for the folks that are not much into drinking. GOOD: I like the atmosphere here. I went on a monday night, so there is no wait. The food was delicious and heavy, just the way I like it. The customer service, different that waiter service was superb. See the experience below. BAD: Though service was friendly, the waiter seemed interested in getting us to buy more, used typical tactics of start you off with a drink or appetizer, or can I interest you in a pazookie. He came around once or twice. EXPERIENCE: So we ordered a medium BJs favorite pizza. When the order came out, the server stated that the cheese was not evenly distributed, so they offered us a free pizza complimentary. So we wound up taking the new one home since there was extra food... much extra. To be honest, we didn't notice and they could have easily let it go, but they did the right thing by going above and beyond to ensure that the pizza we order was made satisfactorily, even though we didn't have any complaints."
Michelle M.,"Alhambra, CA",34,62,225,5.0,7/7/2011,Plates serve big portions. Very good food and drinks. Try the Shrimp Scampi Pasta. Topped with bread crumbs and parmasacheese.
James S.,"Whittier, CA",8,17,,4.0,3/7/2013,"So bomb, especially the pizza, I am a fan on bjs, but the very first time we went, we made reservations over the phone, when we got there, our table was given to someone else because they said they dont hold tables for reservations, so what is the point of calling? but the waiters are excellent, kind, and quick. The food is amazing too! The second time we went, they held the table which was weird from the first experience, maybe they changed their rules. So on the final note, I recommend this place."
Dr. Groovy O.,"Los Angeles, CA",318,202,26,3.0,10/26/2010,"If you've been to any other BJ's, its the same thing. Newly opened. Bartender's and service is good. I've only tried there appetizers and they were pretty good. Happy hour from 10pm - 12am. Not sure on the days. A few of the bartenders are new to the game so they might not know to much about there beer selection but you have many to choose from. I've been here a few times already and its always a cool crowd. I have yet to come during a Laker game. Hopefully they play the sound unlike other places.  Other then that you won't be disappointed.  ; ^ D"
Kay C.,"San Francisco, CA",97,106,15,3.0,8/15/2012,"BJ's is, at best, lackluster. I feel that most of their dishes lack flavor, and their prices are not attuned with the quality of the food. I haven't tasted a pizookie, but I hear it's BJ's saving grace. Let's just say, I'm a connoisseur when it comes to BJs, and this BJs is one I would not come to ;)"
Christopher J.,"Rowland Heights, CA",174,591,420,5.0,4/22/2011,"Came here with a buddy on a Thursday night and arrived just in time for happy hour at 10pm.  We grabbed center seats at bar and immediately I was drawn to the large selection of draft beers available here (as opposed to other locations). Their happy hour is pretty standard with discounts off alcohol and appetizers..  What more do you need this late at night?? Overall, I enjoyed this location because it is local, offers a good selection of draft beers, very clean, and the staff were nice."
S Y.,"La Puente, CA",149,18,12,4.0,8/22/2013,"Came here with friends for bday. The waiter was nice, service from him was good, he would help us decide on food, or give us some suggestions. He was nice enough to take our pictures too. The food was good, as always. Pizookies was yummy."
Ray C.,"Rowland Heights, CA",2,14,,2.0,2/28/2015,"I don't think I ever been here and had decent service. They are the slowest, worst experice I have ever encountered at a restaurant. The food is pretty good but again it's the service that sucks. I can understand once or twice but as I said before it's the same service every time I go. I'd personally choose a different place but my friends like the beer so that's where we always end up flagging our server down again and again and again! Oh and again when we want to pay the bill and get out of there"
Steven S.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",178,343,73,3.0,5/12/2011,"Great food, beers, and pizookie.  Just what you'd expect from this chain. Service is good - nothing spectacular or to rave about - just good... like what you would expect - nothing more, nothing less. They could get more stars if there were more enthusiastic or charismatic servers, but this is far from all the fluff of DT/West LA where all the actors use their charm to score up tips."
Angela W.,"Los Angeles, CA",111,180,27,3.0,5/4/2013,Here's to watch the game and man... if there's a seat in the bar take it! I was kinda sad that they changed their happy hour menu and they took away my spinach flatbread pizza
Jonny B.,"Long Beach, CA",7,25,2,4.0,9/10/2013,"I rarely dine at BJ's but when I do I always enjoy the experience. There's nothing spectacular about the place but the food is consistently 4 stars. This location is one of 4-5 that I've visited and its my least favorite so far. I had a case of bad luck when it came to my servers. Yes servers with an ""S"". Over the course of 2 hours I had four, yes four different servers. It was really annoying bcuz I had to repeat everything several times to several different people. I was rushed the entire time. I was there on a Sunday evening so they might have been under staffed but the rushed feeling isn't a good one for me. I come to enjoy my food, have great conversations with friends and family & I'm always very generou$. One Star for service C of I but I'll forgive you bcuz my food was delicious. I had the Italian Chicken Parmesan this time and the Spinach Artichoke dip for an appetizer. Both were perfectly high in calories and finger lickin' good. No complaints there!! Actually I lied...I do have one small complaint. My friend ordered the fried wontons as a starter....what a joke. 3 little tiny fried things with almost nothing in them. Stay away from the wontons.  The best locations that I've had the pleasure of visiting are Cerritos & The Block of Orange."
Kimi P.,"Rowland Heights, CA",123,182,57,3.0,10/28/2010,"Go to another BJs.   Went there for lunch today with family.  It's recently opened so the place is clean, bright and pristine.   Food:  Calamari appetizer.  Get it.  It's really good.   For my meal I ordered lunch time Soup~Clam Chowder and 1/2 Classic Baked Potato.  The Clam Chowder luckily has a _lot_ of clams and not overflowing with potatoes, so nice... but really _salty_ today!  Really salty.  The baked potato sides (butter, sour cream, and 4 chives?).  They really didn't give many chives.  I had to ask for more.   One of my aunts ordered the Fields of Green salad and they forgot the candied pecans.   Service:  Terrible.  I would give them a 2 for service.  Our server wasn't there half the time and we received our food really slow.  Also asked for water/drink refills 3 times.  Finally got them from a busboy (and not our server).   Birthday Pizookie:  When did they start giving mini-pizookies instead of full sized ones?  That was a little disappointment, also the fact that you can't select which cookie you want on the bottom.   Hopefully it'll grow as service improves... but for now I'm going to Brea or Covina."
Joe T.,"West Covina, CA",29,29,85,2.0,10/9/2013,"The food was good but disappointed with the service and the utensils. Spotty and unclean steak knife and forks plus the server was forgetful. I asked for an extra butter, he left and never came back until 10 minutes later and said ""Sorry about that"" I reported the spotty utensils and forgetful waiter to the manager but did not get any compensation unlike some restaurants like Olive Garden, our meal was waived since we waited longer than expected."
Joseph C.,"San Diego, CA",393,201,101,4.0,2/22/2013,"Great food! I've tried probably half their menu from avocado rolls, ahi tuna, to the entrees from chicken salads, jambalaya rice, pizzas to their ""my fave"" red velvet/oreo pizookie! Makes me want run over there right now as I type this out. I love hanging out here for happy hours. I usually come here whenever we meet up for happy hour with my co-workers. This place is always lively which makes it the perfect scenario to talk about life while we chow down on those happy hour pizzas!"
Al G.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",19,6,,4.0,10/9/2011,"The mimosa is great. I ordered the BJ's California Scramble. The potatoes were crispy and very tasty. The eggs were fluffy and perfect.  The cheese and the applewood bacon were just right. Sourdough toast was also perfect. I was surprised that there weren't more people there, but we got our food quick and hot. My wife had the French toast. Buttery and flavorful, it was very good. The syrup was warm and sweet. Overall a good experience. Our server Ashley, was very attentive and nice."
Roberto C.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",110,20,,4.0,10/10/2010,"I got a Vegas vibe from the restroom.   Service was good.   One huge screen in the bar area.   Parking, no bueno, had to park in front of Acapulco. *Acapulco is now closed so parking is no longer an issue. *Golden Corral is now an issue....haha."
Andrew A.,"Newport Beach, CA",56,44,,5.0,10/15/2010,"If I'm honest I never really liked black angus.. so when I saw BJ's sign come up from the broken wreckage of a forgot black asshole restaurant I immediately pumped my fist.  When you look at the outside of this place at night and then you look at the competition to the left.. it makes it look like the Las Vegas MGM Grand overlooking a motel 6.  The inside was rather similar to the Chino Hills Bj's.. but not that I'm complaning.  The BJ's interiors always out class any other restaurant in their category.  If I'm honest the only one that I feel that can compete would be Cheese cake factory.   The wait was just dreadful looking.  I walked in with the girlfriend and I asked to be seated for 2.. the wait was nearly an hour and a half..  But I persevered and by some blind luck we were seated in about five minutes.  I don't know how or really care why but it made my day just that much better.  The service was top notch.. the waiter expressed his passion for this beer that I'll never forget called the Heritage 100.  Now good god if you like a Pale Ale then you must try this.  It was the most crisp, clear tasting beer that I've had or have had in a very long time.  The waiter continued checking on us through the night and I never felt the urge to have to flag someone down for something as I was always taken care of very well.   The food is what you'd expect from BJ's.  Exhilarating.  Fantastic.  Sexual.  Orgasmic.  The first bite into my Mediterranean pizza made my eyes roll 180 degrees.  I think with the Heritage 100 beer is just was the ultimate combo.  After that we had the famous Pizookie which just kinda seared in my mouth orgasm to final explosion.  (Okay, I'll stop with the sexual euphemisms)   Everything was done right here and I'll definitely be back soon.."
Charles T.,"La Puente, CA",249,307,45,2.0,1/7/2011,"I went in during lunch hours so i helped myself to one of their lunch portions. I went with the Cajun Pasta and it included a bowl of soup with my dish so i ordered clam chowder. I waited at least 20-30 minutes for my food to arrive. If it weren't for the many flatscreens mounted on the walls playing ESPN I would've fell asleep.  The clam chowder was probably one of the best clam chowders I've ate so far. My Cajun Pasta looked stunning but it didn't taste like it was worth 11 dollars.  After I finished my meal, I waited another 15-20 minutes for a waitress arrive with the check. I just wasted an hour of my life just waiting for food to come and the check to leave. The food was alright but BJ's gotta step up with their service."
JJ R.,"Rowland Heights, CA",104,45,50,2.0,4/25/2011,"I've come to this BJ's with family and friends many times and have sat in both dinning area and bar but have yet to receive acceptable service. The only reason to come here is for their beer or their pizookie (for  the wifely).This place needs to get a better wait staff and management team.  The last time I went with a group of friends we noticed the bartender pouring our beer (Stout) wrong.  She was pouring our beer in a pitcher then pouring the beer in a glass.  When we asked the manager about this practice he responded with ""Our dark beer runs on a O2 system and has to be poured in this manner""...for real?  Is this guy dumb! I hope this place gets a new crew or trains their staff soon!  The service gets negative stars, the food get two, but the beer gets four."
