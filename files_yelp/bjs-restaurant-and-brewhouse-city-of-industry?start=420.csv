Saori H.,"La Puente, CA",203,20,1,5.0,10/16/2010,"Came here last night with my bf and a couple of friends. I was sooooo excited about this placeeeee!! The ambiance was pretty incredible, a little more moody and intimate than the other Bj's that I remember...  Anyways, they have plenty of servers and hosts to help everyone.  Their beer list is AMAZINN!!!! from light to dark beer and also ciders and cocktails! I ordered the Hawaiian ale, Longboard beer (about 6 bucks?). It suited my taste pretty well, as i love the fruity aroma! (Hef FTW!) My boyfriend and boss (?) ordered the Gulden Draac (also about 6 bucks) (*whatever the spell is) beer. Looked like pepsi, but I think it was 10%, which really made our dining convo's interesting ;) As for the food, you cant go wrong with the pizzas there. Nice and crunchy crust with generous amounts of veggies and meat. I ordered the salad called ""Field of Greens""( bout $10), which I highly recommend! Fruity (again lol) and with a pretty big portion. it has feta, roasted tomatoes, candied walnuts and raspberry vinagrette~~~~"
Andrew Y.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",357,174,111,3.0,3/3/2011,"The Skinny: New location and the venue is quite large. Service is okay in that they serve you food and you're happy to eat. The Fat: Went here for birthday dinner on a Sunday night. CROWDED. I forgot to reserve a table so was a bit of a wait. Server mixed up on a drink and pizookie order. Food was greasy as always with any restaurant but the deep dish pizza was delicious! The drinks were pretty good. I ordered the snakebite but it was disgusting. They had the top layer as Guinness and the bottom with Fruit Cider. BLEH. Didn't read carefully. The Snakebites in London are better...I should of just ordered Guiness! Overall, a standard Bj's that still needs some conditioning and work but it's a great place for food."
Phyllis L.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",81,42,1,5.0,2/27/2011,"Spinach stuffed mushrooms are delish! The Mediterranean pizza is pretty good.   But what I really come here for is the dessert: The Pizookie Trio - white chocolate macadamia nut, cookies n cream, and chocolate chunk White chocolate macadamia nut is my favorite =P Their root beer is awesome too =]"
Ronald R.,"West Covina, CA",326,175,551,4.0,7/10/2012,"I love BJs. No pun intended... LOL But anyways, the food is great, and not so bad for your buck. The customer service here is really good. My boyfriend and I came here one night for dessert and we sat at the bar, and the bartender was really friendly. She helped me out with what pizookie to get, and ended up just getting half of two flavors! Perfect so I didn't have to decide with just one! I really like the set up at this location. It is smaller than most BJs, but it's still in a good location."
Chris C.,"La Habra, CA",350,219,52,3.0,12/4/2010,Great place to chill... huge menu.. Great White Pizza!!  Chicken Wings!! Avocado Rolls!! It's BJ's. You know what's up.  **P.S They make a mean zombie :P
Ronny D.,"Whittier, CA",1,40,19,5.0,5/22/2013,"Ok so today me , my ol lady and our friend, came for late lunch. Food was amazing but what stood out to me was my server. Oh I forget her name though. White girl with glasses and super friendly. She was one of the best servers i have ever had. Roast beef dip sandwich was great! The only thing I would change about BJs is that they need to sell their Sodas to go."
Jay K.,"Los Angeles, CA",1127,338,660,4.0,1/2/2011,"Outstanding SERVICE! Kudo's to BJ's service trainers, they do an awesome job in setting the standard. No matter which restaurant I go, I find the service to be polite, friendly, attentive, but not overbearing. Reminds me how find dining is like. I never found my cup empty, every request was ""absolutely"". DECOR was fantastic. A lot of thought went into the interior design. A modern industrial revolution motif. Lots of dark wood and steel. Big style points from me.   FOOD is decent, standard corporate mid-upper scale fair. You can expect the typical yuppie Americana selection, topped steak, signature burgers, hearty salads, gourmet pizza, etc. On par with Gordon and Birch. A tad better than Chili's, comparable to California Pizza Kitchen and Cheese Cake Factory. A bit rich and a tad salty I say. DRINKS, I'm sorry I didn't have a chance to sample their well, but it looks fun.  TIP: It's great for dates, group socials, watching the game, happy hour.  Thumbs up and smiles for the service and decor!"
Gary W.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,7,,1.0,7/26/2012,This f'ing BJ's sucks balls.  The service sucks.  My friend order a steak dinner medium rare and our came out well done.  I ordered a country fried steak asms asked for more gravy and this guy forgot about our.  The server is very forgetful.  The fucking server didn't come by to refill our glasses with water.  We even waited more than 20 mins for our food.  Beware of the server George.  He's a f'ing flaker!!!
Diana H.,"Baldwin Park, CA",588,699,1425,3.0,11/15/2010,"Early October of this year, my girlfriend and I decided to check this BJ's out. It's their 100th store location and I was destined to make myself comfortable in this location. I love their small portions mac and cheese, their pizookies, their drinks, and soups! This is, granted, smaller than the Eastland location, but still nice. It's very crowded there since they definitely hired too many employees. The last time I came was for my sister's 23rd birthday in the same month (October) and she ordered the pizza. I had the chicken, and my mom had the steak. All fantastic tasting. I love the pizza. It's so fluffy and flavorful. You must try it out, if not in this location, then any location would be just as fine.  Decor: sexy, especially when you're with the right company (with mugs of beer, cocktail etc) Food: again, flavorful. Do try their pizzas and pizookies.  Price: Fair."
Desiree H.,"Glendora, CA",154,120,218,5.0,11/14/2012,Perfect for a late night dessert!! The strawberry beignet was delicious! Just the right amount of people after 11pm to make this a perfect dessert date place!
Merrill L.,"Alhambra, CA",24,43,,4.0,6/8/2013,"Choice of deep dish or normal 'zahs. The hand crafted sodas are awesome, and the appetizers are phenomenal too! And great service."
Tulip L.,"Long Beach, CA",554,77,273,3.0,1/6/2011,"PROS: -this place is huge! and i like the decoration -the works are all very inexperienced, but i can tell their trying their best and their all very sweet so keep it up! -happy hour! alot of dishes fall in the 3-8$ range during this time -their cream soda! devine! CONS: -SO FREAKING GREASY. yuck. the mac n cheese i ordered was swimming around in oil -like johnson's said below me, the food gets old real fast."
Chase B.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",112,26,2,1.0,4/11/2012,"The service here is horrible. Each and every time. Without fail. I go in around 11 pm more or less for a snack and to hang out with friends, by this time the bar is only open. Now there are about 4 open booths, however none of them are clean, and the manager is busy talking and not caring about anyone else expect her conversation. After waiting 10 minutes in the lobby, right when she was about to walk right past me with no eye contact, I had to discuss my concern. Overall, the food is fine, but this BJ's does not deserves your money, time, or business."
Gil G.,"West Covina, CA",55,20,12,4.0,12/29/2010,"Unlike others, this BJ's doesn't have Mountain Dew. However the facility is nice, the TVs are evenly spread and tuned into great channels. The drinks were a little too strong. And it wreaked of Rowland Heights' populous. Many of the waitresses were literally standing for 20 minutes talking to other guests. I recommend this place to anyone who loves BJs as a restaraunt, not as a bar, and anyone who loves boba, internet cafes, and anime."
Jenny C.,"Los Angeles, CA",270,313,404,1.0,2/4/2012,"Service here is god awful even when it's empty, and their drinks are weak. I think my ice cubes at home can get me drunker than their cocktails."
Joey H.,"Los Angeles, CA",62,320,3,5.0,5/27/2014,"in my opinion bj's has the best pizza. theres something about the crust that keeps me coming back. me, my son and my mom all shared a large vegetarian. we all enjoyed it. we also shared an order of avocado wraps. we enjoyed that too. the service was friendly and the place is clean. great time there."
John T.,"Rowland Heights, CA",116,64,130,4.0,10/11/2010,"Came here on their ""soft open"" for friends and family.  I just happened to stumbled in and was lucky enough to talk my way in since we weren't invited.  Not knowing what was going on, one hostess was giving us issues. She had to talk to management, and was sat in an unfavorable place...the handicap bar seating.  But my colleague and I didn't mind. As mentioned, it was a test run, and was told that the menus are set for different areas so we didn't have the full menu available to where we sat.  I inquired why we only get a partial menu.  The bartender explained to us as the kitchen needed to familiar with cooking the menu items.  Fair enough. Food:  good...the usual BJ quality, but we were limited to a few sandwich/burger items and pizza's.  Still good though. Beers: I like beer but can only take a few as it gets me really full fast.  But some reason, I kept trying the varieties they had...5 of them.  So full! Service:  Great! Especially the bartenders.  They were very helpful and attentive.  Their was even one asian female bartender that was on the other end of the bar to check if we were ok and asked how was the food.  I said due to limited menu selection, we shared an entree.  She inquired why, each person is entitle to the free meal tonight!  Me, whaaa?  ""Yes, the entire meal tonight is free as we are  running a test of the kitchen.  Only the alcohol are charged"".  Damn, set us up with another entree! Though she was not our bartender, she was nice enough to tell us what's the 411 with the night.   Gave extra tip just for that...service! I'm lookin' to head back there as its hella close to home!"
Patrick M.,"Monrovia, CA",11,232,12,4.0,10/9/2012,"Since BJ's has become mainstream, it seems that the food quality has suffered a little bit. The beer is still good as always. This place is always a good place to hang out with friends and catch a football game (if you get there early enough). This BJ's is bigger than some of the others I've been to. Service is decent."
Francis F.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",9,40,1,4.0,11/7/2010,"This restaurant is new to this area, but I've been to the one in Covina(?) many times, and think the place is great. I normally get the pizzas, and I did get myself a Root Beer, but this time around, I got the fish tacos. And they were good, the food rarely disappoints as I've tried almost everything on the menu. Service was good, no complaints there, and the atmosphere was loud but in a good way. I'm not a drinker, so I have no opinions on their beers, but the times I went with my friends who had the beer, they seemed to like the variety and the flavor. I don't know how they do it. All in all, a good experience, good food, and good times."
Leila A.,"La Puente, CA",11,55,1,1.0,4/3/2012,"No Stars for this place due to the terrible service they always provide. The food is really good, but the service sucks all the time. I won't be back to the West Covina location ever again. I rather go to chili's because they provide good service."
