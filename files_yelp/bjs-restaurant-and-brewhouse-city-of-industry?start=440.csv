Debbie S.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",107,14,,4.0,5/22/2013,"Fun, fun place!  The microbrews are great, and they always have a good game on their many screens including one that is 104 inches!!   The food is pretty good, typical chain restaurant fair.  The to go orders are always quick and on time, and you can also order a large Jeremiah Red which is delicious!  The enlightened menu has healthy and tasty items such as Morocco Salmon and Cajun Tilapia"
Daniel Z.,"La Puente, CA",119,39,9,2.0,1/10/2011,"This place is always packed during the normal rush hour dinner times expecially during the weekend. It seems that everytime i go to this location i have a problem. They are a little unorganized  First visit, Somehow they gave my pizza to someone else so i had to wait another 10-15 minutes for them to make one and give it to me.  Second visit they gave my table to a party that arrived after we had arrived RIGHT INFRONT OF US and to make matters worse they did NOT have any more tables avaible for about another 15-20 minutes, I overheard the conversations between the employees and they messed up but told the manager they had a SYSTEM GLITCH! i spoke to the manager and they sat me down at some table probably meant for 8-10 people on some corner which was ok but felt awkward.  they should have made this location bigger but what can you do?"
Cheryl N.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,123,12,5.0,11/12/2012,"I really like BJ's.  I always have great service here.  My husband and I usually order an appetizer, pizza, and dessert.  Sometimes, we order drinks too.  They have specialty beers that my husband likes.  I like their specials, for example, there was a $20.00 special for two soups or salads, medium pizza, and a pizookie.  So much food!  We are on facebook, so they usually post their specials/discounts there.  On the weekends, there is about a 15 minute wait.  Parking is plentiful, you can also park in the back if you can't find a spot. Also a great place for happy hour."
Synthia C.,"Chino Hills, CA",90,4,,1.0,11/17/2013,"My family and I frequently eat at Bj's (at least 1-2 times a month). We usually go to the Chino Hills or Brea locations but were at the Puente Hills location last night. The night started out a little roughly - my beer took a very long time to come and my fork was dirty (looked like someone already ate a pizookie with it) but it was nothing worth complaining about. However, when our food came my mom's Mahi Mahi was so overcooked that the edges were burnt. She gets this every time we go and knew that it isn't usually cooked like that so she sent it back to be remade. Then our friends started eating their pizza only to find that they forgot to put sauce on it. When the waiter returned with the new fish, we saw that it was once again burned on the edges and overcooked. We asked to speak to the manager about our food so he brought him over. We informed the manager of the fish and the pizza. He offered to bring out a new pizza but since they were hungry they said it wasn't necessary, but if he could just bring them a side of sauce. He told us he would personally go get the sauce and NEVER CAME BACK. My mom did not eat the fish, they left the rest of the pizza and at the end of the meal the manager brought us our check with a 20 dollar comp card ""to be used at our next visit"", said nothing about the sauce he never brought, and didn't even ask how the rest of our meal was. He seemed eager to drop the bill and leave. When we looked at it we saw that he charged us for the fish and the pizza anyway. We told our server that he never even brought sauce and we didn't eat the fish and he was understanding and said he would take the bill to the manager to be fixed. When the waiter finally returned nothing about the bill changed and he just apologized again about the food. We put the 20 dollar comp card in the bill and told him to use it now because we would not be returning. The manager never returned to our table and said nothing to us when we passed him on our way out. We are not usually the type to complain, but I asked our waiter to inform the manager that I would be complaining about him specifically because his managing skills were awful and he did nothing to redeem a very disappointing experience. We are always happy with our visits to the Chino Hills and Brea locations but because of that manager we will not be returning to this location and we will advise other friends and family against it as well. The manager I have mentioned is Mark Hester. Hopefully this review is a wake up call that his managing skills leave much to be desired."
Erik C.,"La Puente, CA",1,9,1,1.0,2/9/2013,Oh man this place sucked balls after 2 times the 3rd time we went our food was sooo crappy...and man not to mention the 3rd time when my cousin found a long hair in his food and our food was half ass cooked...and the dam weighter took my beer cup like half way full ...but I just didn't say any thing...ill never go here again...the one star is for the 2 first times we went and it was ok...but never again..
P T.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",45,31,5,4.0,2/9/2011,"Had the Blackened salmon lunch special, and a small BJ's Special pizza... Negatives: Pizza had a little bit too much oil on the outside pan area... Fish was well seasoned, and veggies were okay, but thought the portion was little bit too small compared to Mimi's Cafe...  And pricing seemed a couple of bucks too high, but maybe they have coupons somewhere.... Positives: Nice interior, lots of sports to watch, clean bathrooms....  Also has large banquet area.  Overall a good place for binge drinking."
Simone V.,"West Covina, CA",157,137,190,1.0,9/9/2011,"First time I've been to this BJs location with hopes of good service and food like their other locations, but OMG this had to be the worse service ever! The guy we had was a total idiot! And that's being nice.  When we first got settled in, one of my friends was coming back from the restroom and she noticed another table near us left a note after they had left, ""You suck."" Our first thought was, that's not nice, but after the crappy service this guy gave us, we definitely understood what that table meant.  First off he keeps forgetting to get our water we ordered along with our drinks. There were 3 of us and he comes back, after reminding him a few times, with 2 cups of water with no ice. WTF? We only ordered the mac n cheese and a medium great white pizza. Now here's the kicker too, for the mac n cheese, he brings out 3 small plates for us to share the small appetizer, but for the pizza, he brings out 2 dinner plates. Okay, by this time I'm thinking, ""Can this guy count?"" Hello?! There was 3 of us.  Next was the drinks... my friend had ordered a shot of chilled patron, and we had to remind him several times and his response was, ""I'll check with the bar."", but never comes back with the drink. It got to the point where I had to wave down another server and ask him to help us. And that server brought it right out and helped take additional drink orders from us. Our server keeps asking us if we need a box when we are in midst of conversation with more than 1/2 a pizza still uneaten and we keep telling him ""We're still working on it."" It got to the point when we finally said fine, get us a box after he came back asking us again and he doesn't come back with the box till another 20 minutes. WTH? My friend had to tell him that he never came out with her drink and that we had to flag someone else to help us and his excuse, ""O, there was a really big party, sorry."" So you can remember to bring out the big party their order, but not our small party of 3? LAME excuse.  Will I be back to this location.... I'll pass."
Peter D.,"Los Angeles, CA",394,604,241,3.0,11/20/2011,"Pizzas are thick and chunky. Not NY for sure. Definitely closer to Chicago. Not bad for a chain. I haven't been here in a while and noticed they upped the menu. Horseshoe fries and burgers are good, especially the Crispy Jalapeno. I'd recommend a couple shared appetizers: Santa Fe Spring Rolls are my favorite there. The Shrimp Lettuce Wraps aren't bad either nor are the stuff mushrooms. They even have a gluten-free selection."
Sheila M.,"Walnut, CA",79,12,3,1.0,9/10/2011,"Three strikes, this place is definitely out.   1st visit: - server NEVER refilled our beverages, we had to ask a bus boy, twice - we cancelled our appetizer because our main entrees came out first, then got charged for it anyway, with no apology - we had to ask twice for our check and finally walked up to the host desk to get it, still no apology - we let the manager on duty know, he thanked us for telling him, and by golly, still no apology 2nd visit (by far the worst): - the first thing our server said was ""hi, we're understaffed tonight, so the food will take longer to come out...do you still want to eat here?"" (I should have said no and just left)   - when we asked him for a refill he said ""sure, but I'm not your server anymore, I was just covering a break"" - it took way too long for every person in a BJ's uniform to figure out who our server was supposed to be...all the while we just stared as our first server approached all of the other servers practically begging them to come help us - somebody finally came by to apologize and said ""I guess I'll be helping you for the rest of the night.  Sorry, your table was never assigned to anybody.... what did you want?"" 3rd visit: - we sat for 12 minutes (yes, I counted this time) before the server first approached us - there were only 2 servers covering 8 tables, 2 of which were large parties of 12+, so naturally, everything was slow - server forgot to order the appetizer, then blamed it on the kitchen - the soup was lukewarm - server poured iced tea into my dad's diet coke - they were out of sugar bowls, so our server had to ask a table next to us if they needed theirs, then took it and set it down on our table.  When I asked for splenda, she said she would have to find a table that had splenda in the sugar bowls, do I want equal instead?  (uhh, no... go find me splenda) - there were 5 different servers/bus boys/runners who had to help us with refills, napkins, extra sides, etc... and each person we asked acted as if we were a burden - our server initially charged us for the pazooki that was supposed to be on the house for our horrible service I came back and cut them some slack because they had just opened, and I love BJ's pizza and beer... but the lack of training, and frankly, the lack of CARING is unacceptable and not deserving of a 4th chance.  I'll drive the extra miles to West Covina, Brea, or Chino Hills."
Vita S.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",64,177,24,2.0,3/26/2012,Wow. Service here is bad. Very unexperienced staff for sure!
Stacy H.,"Walnut, CA",125,84,134,1.0,9/16/2011,We got seated. To get our drinks took FOREVER. It isn't that busy.  Think maybe they might need more employees to get this process going. Usually I don't wait that long.. I'm a very patient person but this is way too long. Service sucks lot tonight. I ordered a shot. They couldn't make. Then I asked for a cactus cooler shot. And they couldn't make it. This place isn't the greatest. Go somewhere else if ur going to drink.
Andrew H.,"Diamond Bar, CA",0,3,,4.0,2/16/2013,"I didn't expect much because of so many negative reviews on this location including how horrible the parking was, how long the wait for the food was, and how racist the servers are...Well, I had a great experience at this BJ's last night. I went to eat dinner on a Friday night and they said I needed to wait 15-20 minutes. Ended up getting seated within 10 minutes. The place was packed so I thought my orders were gonna take a long time but nope! Food came out really fast. Appetizers came out within 5 minutes and the pizza came out under 10 minutes. Also our waiter was really friendly and polite. Overall a great dinner!"
David K.,"El Monte, CA",144,115,65,3.0,6/7/2012,"Unless you come for beer, the food is just average - not great and not bad - nothing really special to rave about.  The service is good but a little slow.  Come to enjoy time with friends not when you have limited time."
Ryan B.,"Rowland Heights, CA",285,27,3,5.0,10/9/2010,This is a new BJ's next to the 60 freeway where black angus used to lie. We have been waiting for a long time for this to open and I'm glad to say that the usual service from Bj's is not lost on this new location.  I ordered the Avocado Eggrolls and spinach artichoke pizza with a friend. Both were delicious as usual but who ever is cooking the pizza they were more delicious then normal. Also I am not just saying that because I was hungry I had eaten earlier.  The waiting staff is surprisingly well trained for a restaurant that only opened a week ago and were quick about refilling drinks asking us how we were doing etc. They also did not hover over our table which at times can be fairly annoying.  My only qualm is that parking which is albeit plentiful is a bit of a problem you may want to park at red lobster next door because parking at the peak hour I went was pretty bad. All in all a very good dining experience and I will be back soon.
Lana L.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,848,62,2.0,3/18/2013,"Out of all the restaurants around this place, I have no idea why I decided to come here. Don't get me wrong, the service wasn't bad but the food, Eh! Thank goodness I only got the all you can eat salad/soup lunch special under $10"
zoe h.,"Walnut, CA",3,5,,3.0,5/22/2014,"This is my favorite BJs at all time. But the waiter for tonite really killed my mood to have a few sips. This Bruce send us the check right after the first round like he's busy running to the door. He's too busy drop off checks but forgot to clean our table. And probably too busy to take our order as well. Anyway, we still had a blast but it could be even better if he's not serving our table."
Sam K.,"Diamond Bar, CA",113,28,9,1.0,8/11/2012,Horrible service!!!!!! Waited 45 minutes for our LUNCH to come out!!! I ordered chicken breast with pasta and gf ordered cajun pasta. Serious?! 45 minutes??? If you want to eat here for lunch you should come by 11am so you can start eating by 12!!
Lexine L.,"Covina, CA",231,3,2,5.0,9/10/2012,This place is AMAZING!! Everybody is sooooo nice. Especially the hostesses (*cough*alex*cough*)!!!! I'm a regular and each day I get something new and it never ceases to please my palet. I love BJ's! Gold standard heck yeah :D
Chris A.,"Los Angeles, CA",400,243,2088,2.0,5/8/2011,"Although we got seated right away on a busy Saturday night, the table service wasn't the greatest. My friend and I only came in to get some dessert, but we had 3 different waiter/waitresses. The first waitress was the friendliest, but she only brought us water. Then the next waiter was rather rude and gave some attitude. He seemed unwilling to take our order and kept dismissing our questions to make it seem like we didn't know what we wanted. We were finally able to order our Pizookie Trio with the chocolate chunk, white macadamia nut, and oatmeal raisin cookies, but soon thereafter the waiter went on his ""lunch"" break and we had another waitress. Neither of the last two came by to check on us or even refill our water. Also, the pizookie tastes better in a party platter rather than the 3 minis in the trio because it's easier to get the cookie out and the 3 mini tins that it's served on slides around on the big plate that all 3 are placed on. The satisfaction came in the taste though, BJs is pretty consistent with their pizookies, just not the service."
Wayne K.,"Walnut, CA",274,56,30,3.0,3/15/2011,Wow the menu is different from the one in Brea so it threw me for a little.  Miss some of the regular items they had on the menu but you can ask and at times they can still get some of the classics.
