Dennis G.,"Rio Rancho, NM",0,4,,4.0,6/14/2014,I would give bj's a 5... My problem was the waitress .. We got an appetizer .. Oops I forgot you plates .. Our meal included a salad .. The meal got to the table before the salad .. Oops I forgot refill drinks .. On a Saturday at 11:30 ... Seriously? ... The food was delish.. And I will go back .. Hopefully a new waitress..
Jackie L.,"Rowland Heights, CA",102,5,,1.0,6/1/2012,"The last time there with an order of BBQ chicken pizza and found one of the slices was extremely different than others, instead of chicken, tomatoes and onions on it, it was just a piece of cheezy overburnt dough hardly ignored. In addition to that, their store manager's attitude.  He came to our table shout out loud and started ""Telling"" us that they all looked exactly the same to him. At the same time of yelling, he was also demostrating how it looked the same by picking up the chicken and tomatoes from other good slices to the ""Dough"" to show us the similarity of them, then move the chicken and tomatoes back to the good ones to tell us why they looked differently, and then attemping to do the same ""demostration"" all over again until I asked him to stop playing with the food I paid for. I personally think both of the service and food quality has way to much need to improve."
Nichole R.,"Walnut, CA",281,13,,1.0,11/8/2012,"The past two times I've been there have been HORRIBLE!  The first time was with a large group. Our waitress was flat out rude to the younger (high school) kids in the group. They are not loud and obnoxiously rude kids, so I don't understand why she had attitude. Anyways, at the end we get our bill and notice we were charged for extra stuff (which happens) so the manager fixes it and says ""OK, this is your new total,"" So everyone pays and once we have the amount they all start leaving since their parents were there to pick them up. Now It's just a few of us left and the manager comes back and says ""Oh! sorry I forgot to add tax and tip."" Uh....everyone is already gone and he said ""this is your new total."" It's not our fault he messed up. Finally we had enough and my friend let's him know it. She wasn't going to bring up the rude waitress but we had enough. In the end (after he argued with my friend) we ended up having to pay and he gave her a $10 gift card to ""make it better"" Second time (I don't even know why we went back) it was a much smaller group of 7. Our waitress was only waiting on two tables but we were there for over 2 hours. It took a little over a half hour for our orders to be taken, about the same time to get our food, then what seemed like FOREVER to get our bill which we only got because someone had to get up and find our waitress and ask her after we waited for about 45 minutes AFTER we finished eating and plates were already collected. Again, a friend goes to the manager and he starts giving excuses. He was a lovely man though! A lot more polite than the previous one we had to deal with. Still, he did nothing about it. I think we are done with this place."
Raquel R.,"Los Angeles, CA",347,500,313,4.0,11/14/2011,BJ's is always good for a quick lunch and of course beer!
Steven C.,"El Paso, TX",73,363,114,2.0,9/30/2011,"i sort of wanna give a 3 star review, but that wouldnt be true to the food.  the spinach and artichoke dip is awesome, but very junk food esque.  the stuffed mushrooms? mushroom caps w/ some pesto filling, also had a cheap taste to it. i love mushrooms so this was a bit offensive.  italian market salad was good. it was so funny my friend thought the artichoke hearts was chicken. i really wish asian restaurants would have nicer salads like this.  the vegetarian pizza was interesting. topping was just whatever but i was feeling the whole wheat crust.  im sure their dishes w/ meat are probly much better.. but this was just my experience.  i had some sorta creamy coffee alcohol drink that was just one of the worst recommendations i've ever gotten from a server. i mean.. look at the food im eating.. other than that she was nice tho."
Luis C.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",0,13,7,4.0,9/3/2012,Last night was our very first time at BJ's...service and food was great...would definitely go back again!
Brittany T.,"Cerritos, CA",1,13,1,1.0,5/3/2014,"Came here tonight with my fiance. We get seated and ""Lawrence"" is our waiter. So there is no smile from Lawrence he doesn't even look us in the eye and we sat in a booth so when he took our drink orders he had his back to me! Ewww! We drank our drinks really fast cuz we were so thirsty ...but we got our main dishe before we got our first refill! Now what is sadder about all of this is that Lawrence was raking the order behind us and the table on the other side of us too..but not once did he stop to ask if we wanted refills. So some sweet guy came out from the back to bring us our pizza we ordered (forgot his name)...i had to ask him for refills, plates and our appetizer!!! Seriously what restaurant brings out your main dish firdt and appetizer after that??? What's the point of an appetizer? I work in food/customer service industry and this server was really bad at attaining to his guests. This service was horrible. Won't be coming bak to this location!"
Aubrey J.,"Los Angeles, CA",40,231,678,3.0,4/26/2013,"the food is great and all BUT THE SERVICE WILL ALWAYS SUCK HERE. they are really slow... =( but that doesn't stop my friends and i from coming here hahaha. good vibes, good drinks, good food. that's it =) i'm REALLY glad they opened up this BJ's near home for sure. oreo pizookie ftw!"
Ryan C.,"Monterey Park, CA",208,297,35,2.0,9/24/2011,"Came here to celebrate a birthday.Got seated pretty fast but the food took over half an hour to come to our table which seemed odd, because it was not that crowded.When the food came it was barely warm room temperature.I got the Texas chicken steak which had hardly any gravy at all.It was so bland.The vegetables weren't even cooked it was like eating raw vegetables.Service was ok.Next time I would rather make the drive to Claim Jumper in Brea. I hope not all BJs are this terrible!"
Belange H.,"Salt Lake City, UT",58,246,303,4.0,8/31/2011,"Very fresh Salmon, the veggies and rice was also cooked to perfection. Liked the ambiance of the place as well as the beer selection. The mojito was a bit bland, but the service and entree were great."
JJ A.,"Rowland Heights, CA",133,55,3,4.0,1/18/2011,A small BJ's restaurant.  Great variety in a place when most restaurants around the area offer practically the same thing.  Great drinks with moderate pricing.  Waiting time can get annoying so take advantage of the reservation seating (call it in).  Must be there with half the party of your reservation is forfeited (no mercy)
S M.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",5,30,3,2.0,10/12/2011,The food here is not too good. Really the only reason to come in are the drinks and appetizers. Otherwise if your looking for a great dinner nite make plans elsewhere.
Aileen C.,"Diamond Bar, CA",233,107,13,4.0,2/3/2011,"YAAY! BJ's near my work! I love their beer sampler, you can get the variety of 4 BJ's select beers for a decent price. The portions are just enough for you to enjoy the taste and want to move on to the next one. I recently tried their grilled chicken slider which is absolutely delicious! The grilled chicken itself is not that big, but the taste is enough to enjoy. I also tried their Miso Salmon lunch special, but I would not recommend it since it's probably comparable to a microwave dinner. The beer, appetizer menu and pizza is what I would suggest sticking to."
Shayne H.,"Long Beach, CA",3,68,6,1.0,9/5/2013,"Okay, let me start from the top. We arrived just before 10pm and were hungry and happy as clams that they were open until 1. I'd never been to BJ's but my fiancé has and gave it rave reviews so I wanted to try it out. Total flop! They told us it was a 10 minute wait to be seated. For a Friday night, it wasn't that busy so I just assumed they were short staffed. We decided to have a seat at the bar and prime the ol' pump. I ordered a Modelo and my better half ordered a michelada. Now, a michelada is half beer, half spicy clamado then done. It was horrible. Too much spice, too little tomato juice. Ordinarily I don't bitch about drinks in reviews but for $9 for something I can make at home for far less, I have certain expectations. They weren't met. So, we continued waiting for a table. After 15 minutes, I went over and asked the host if our table was ready and she said yeah, we called you. Oh really? How? Did you send out carry pigeons and we happened to miss them? Didn't hear our names shouted, they didn't give us a buzzer thing, nothing. So we finally get seated. We sat there, decided what we wanted and then waited ANOTHER 15 minutes for a server to show up, all the while, numerous servers walked by and didn't even acknowledge us. So Michael finally came by, didn't offer us water, took our order and disappeared. We ordered stuffed mushrooms and Buffalo style chicken wontons, and the chicken bacon ranch pizza. 20 minutes later, a different server brings our pizza to the table and asked if it was ours. We said yeah, but we want our appetizers first (DUH!) so she offers to take it and put it in the warmer for us. Literally a second after she leaves, a THIRD server brings our apps. Both tasted fine but were lukewarm. What the hell is going on around here!? Michael then asks if he can bring our pizza back, we say yeah. The pizza was good but lacked the right amount of ranch to balance it with the bacon and chicken. Overall, the food was better than average. But for the cost, it should have been really GOOD. The service? Well, it's pretty obvious how we feel. Sorry BJ's, you failed us."
David C.,"West Covina, CA",1,6,,1.0,1/23/2012,Worst place ever! This place gave me food poisoning/stomach flu. No bs! I ordered a medium well steak and it came to me @ medium rare. They took it back and the chef was probably pissed off and gave me back a contaminated steak. DO NOT SUPPORT THIS PLACE!!!!
Mark W.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",15,16,5,1.0,1/31/2011,"The BJs out in Brea was much better.  The service here was horrible, especially for Sunday brunch when the place was empty. Took about an hour to get our food, refills took forever and they kept mixing up our drinks, they got our orders wrong and ended up charging us for something they never brought out even after we canceled it and told them to take it off our order. I ordered a Jambalaya and the shrimp and rice tasted like it came from a microwave meal. Much improvement needed."
Jonathan P.,"Los Angeles, CA",455,184,91,4.0,4/21/2011,Looks like they've cleaned up their act. Last few times I've gone have been much better experiences. The bartenders are amazing and the staff is friendly and prompt.
Devrae C.,"West Covina, CA",2,18,,5.0,11/19/2011,"Been here a few times and each time was pretty good, good food good service! Love the wedge fries with ranch!"
H C.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",72,46,51,2.0,11/11/2010,"This review is mainly for the awful service!   I've been to this place twice.  Once a month earlier when it was just me and the hubby for a late night dessert and snack.  When we arrive, our waiter was on break so another server took our drink and food orders.  The drinks came out and after about 10 minutes, we got curious where our 'real' waiter was and wondered about our food.  After asking around to the other passing servers and then going to the hostess, 'our' waiter finally showed up.  No apologies from him about being MIA.  We knew this place just opened, so we chalked it up to training and hoped it'll be better next time we come.  Well, it's didn't get better.  My girlfriends and I came for lunch to celebrate a bunch of birthdays last week on a busy Friday afternoon.  It took 30 minutes after our drinks were ordered before the waitress came back to take our food orders.  We tried to get others to help us but they told us they'll look for her.  Then, as we were talking to the manager, she showed up!  During the 30 minutes we were waiting for her, other servers came by multiple times with beer and food we didn't order.  We kept sending them away.  They looked so confused just standing in the middle of the room trying to figure out their next steps.  When our food did arrive, a person in our party didn't get hers b/c they said her order was mistakenly taken by another server...yeah, no surprise.  Then they brought a dessert to our table while we were still eating and said 'is there a birthday' here?  Yes...but we're still eating our meal!  Seriously, this has to be one of the worst service experience I've ever had in a restaurant.  There were so many problems, it was funny.   I have to blame the management for all these issues.  They've been opened well over a month and management should have ironed out these issues during that time.   I won't be going back to dine at this location...maybe take out?"
Nick G.,"Bloomfield Hills, MI",30,26,2,2.0,7/4/2011,Terrible service. Inconsistent food. Pass if you can.
