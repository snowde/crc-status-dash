Norville G.,"La Puente, CA",629,8,2,1.0,10/31/2010,"**UPDATE** 12/28/2010 In my review below the dotted line I gave it a three stars.  That was me being generous.  Since I posted my review I came back here a couple more times.   My last visit was last night.  And let me tell you.   Service has gotten a lot worse.   We had a group of 5 people at the bar area.  We ordered beer and food of course.  It took them 30 minutes to deliver our beverages (it wasn't even busy) and on top of that I ordered a bread bowl of clam chowder which came to me 1hr after order and it was friggin COOOOOLD!!!!  Who the hell serves cold Clam Chowder.  So, I called our waitress and asked her to exchange it for a hot clam chowder and she responded with the most annoying attitude and replied ""You know what?  we don't have anymore soup so I'll just knock it off your check.""  And did she apologize??? NOPE!!   I am sick off getting shitty ass service here and we are never ever ever coming back!!  I hope this BJ's burns down!!! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- First impression from the outside was that it was the best looking Bj's i've ever seen.  Upon entering the atmosphere is one of a kind.  The lighting and the set up of the interior is very versatile.  You can bring a date their and have it be romantic or you can bring your family and friends and have a good time.   Their food and drinks is YUMMMMMMY!!!  Happy hour is great there.  Half off mini pizzas!!!! =)  As for their service, I came here a couple of times and the service is a hit or miss.  One out of the three times I came here the service was superb.  Two out of three times that I came here the service was either mediocre or just really bad!  I am really not that strict when critiquing on service but the last time I came it was horrible!  It took the waitress 15 minutes to serve us drinks.  When we ordered appetizers it took over 30 minutes to come out because the waitress forgot to put in the order.  And all we ordered was an order of the fried calamaris.  We placed the order the same time we ordered the calamari and it took an hour to get our food!  And the waitress did apologize nor even bother to come every now and then to check how we were doing.  The other waitresses had to pick up her slack.  At one point I saw our waitress texting in the corner of the room?  WTF?!?!?!   Conclusion::::   FOOD GREAT!  DRINKS GREAT!  (Recommend Gulden Draak) SERVICE  Fire that damn waitress and hire servers that can better represent your restaurant.   I would've given it 5 stars but servers there are is horrible at times."
Vivian Q.,"San Antonio, TX",144,199,729,5.0,11/18/2010,The turkey cobb sandwich w/shoestring fries and wedge salad was out of this world.  You also must try their locally. Brewed rootbeer and orange creme soda - just super duper good!
Kristen V.,"Los Angeles, CA",61,73,2,3.0,1/6/2011,"Went here last night. For the past couple of years, I've made it my mission to go to every BJ's location I can. So far I've been to more than 10. I'm always a fan of their food, but lately BJ's has failed to impress me with their beer selection. I can only order so many pitchers of Jeremiah red, or Octoberfest! I keep thinking they'll bring out a BETTER beer for the season, but same ol' thing. . .disappointing. I also found this location to be a bit small. Service was good though and as mentioned, I never have anything bad to say about their food!!"
Jess P.,"Las Vegas, NV",53,273,59,5.0,1/5/2011,You go to BJ's for beer and pizookie- THAT'S IT! and that exactly what I had...I'm glad a BJ's opened up in the area; now the over 21 crowd but not quite married have a cool place to chill. check it out!
Brian L.,"Cypress, CA",5,10,1,3.0,9/27/2011,"came here today for lunch and ordered pizza, calamari, and beer. loved pizza and beer but calamari was horrible....calamari was cut too big and cold.. And I had to wait long time for a server to bring the menues."
Peter C.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",221,217,154,4.0,1/18/2011,"I used to have to drive to other BJ restaurants, but there is one now that's more convenient. I really like their regular deep dish pizzas and their pizookies (dessert). However, don't order their appetizer style pizza! I ordered an Italian sausage pizza and when it arrives, I thought they made a mistake because all I can see is a plain thin crust pizza. After asking the service staff to make sure he didn't bring to me the wrong order, it IS the right one - the ""sausages"" are the tiny black spots on the pizza that I'll have to use a magnifying glass to see! On the other hand, their Avocado Egg Roll appetizer is really, really good. Highly recommended."
Angela L.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",52,6,10,1.0,4/5/2011,"The BJ's here by the Puente Hills Mall is horrible!   DO NOT GO THERE!  I went with my family and fiance's family, so we had a big table..  The waiter seem to be new, so okay we had patience.  This place was extremely crowded and you need to almost yell to carry a conversation.  It took us 40 minutes to get our food and then out appetizers came AFTER our food.  Okay, whatever, put up with it. Then when we were going to pay the bill it took the waiter 40 minutes and he couldn't even do it. So, he had his manager come to our table and tell us that they do not know how to process a VISA giftcard. Then the manager (Asian dude with glasses) started telling us that it was our fault that we paid with a VISA giftcard and that perhaps there wasn't enough on there.  BS because it was a brand new visa giftcard.  Then the manager started to ROLL his eyes at us and questioned us ""okay, so what do you want me to do......""  WTF service is that. He didn't apologize and didn't even attempt to ameliorate the situation.  He was constantly being on the defensive side and giving the sense of blowing us off.  All in all, I would NEVER recommend anyone to this place.  The service is horrible, the manging sucks, the food wasn't that great either.  Save your money and go else where!"
Melody L.,"Los Angeles, CA",108,275,11,4.0,3/28/2011,"My boyfriend and I frequently visit this place. They have wonderful pizzas and burgers. There are a lot of people who come here so sometimes the wait is ridiculous. However, I call in first and then go there and wait a little bit of time. My boyfriend always gets a pizza and I always get the pazookie for us to share(: It's delicious, however, this place is a little more on the expensive side. The bar looks wonderful though and it seems that they have a lot of selections. Their soups are good and so are their salads, but what they're really known for is for the pizzas so I would definitely recommend getting a pizza here."
Stephane L.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",4,17,4,4.0,3/15/2012,"Nice place to hang out.  The location is kind of hidden, so its not extremely busy most of the times.  The bar is a goood spot to watch sports and drink...woohoo!"
Sarah L.,"Los Angeles, CA",62,20,11,1.0,12/9/2011,This BJ's SUCKS!! Don't go here. The service is slow and the waiters never come to your table.
Andrew S.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",180,32,3,4.0,11/24/2010,Been here many times already. Ivan the waiter is awesome. Normally we sit in the bar area and have a few drinks. Nice to have a place locally with some decent beer selection. Root beer and cream soda are also tasty.
Eddie V.,"Lakewood, CA",131,88,74,4.0,10/17/2010,Busy as all heck. I guess thats what you get when you come on a weekend.  Small wait to be seated.  I'm a big BJ's fan so I ordered some wings to start off while my Mediteranean Pizza is being made. Always a good choice.  Service was pretty good considering the crowd. Definitely worth the wait. Ate so much I didn't leave room for a pizzokie.  Probably one of the main reasons why I like this place.
Henry B.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",7,11,,5.0,7/8/2011,Food is great and served in very large portions on big plates! My favorite is the shrimp scampi pasta with bread crumbs and lots of parmesan cheese! Also big choice of beer too! Very big facility with a huge parking lot.
Paul C.,"San Gabriel, CA",4,40,,4.0,6/26/2011,"I haven't visited a BJ's establishment for years, and this recent visit really surprised me.  The food was actually very good.  In particular, I ordered the reasonably priced California Chicken sandwich with a side of tomato bisque.  The sandwich was much better than I expected; the chicken was  flavorful, the avocado was heaped on, and the peppers added a nice tangy touch.  Prior to that, I tried their Ahi Poke, which was again, much better than I expected of a chain restaurant.  The tuna tasted fresh and the accompanying vegetables were crisp.  The triangular fried cracker thingies coupled with the ahi/veggies and made it a textural delight. Now if only service was more prompt.  When we walked into the restaurant in the late afternoon, the place was only a tenth full.  You would think that the waiter would come right away.  Instead, we waited over 10 minutes before our order was taken.  And even then, it wasn't our waiter that took our order, but the manager, and probably because he saw we were in the weeds.  THAT actually was a good sign. Then the waiter finally came along and proceeded to take our order only to find out that our orders were already taken. All that being said, the food more than made up for the lacking service.  The price point was great for what you get.  The environment is great for spending time with friends and watch the Dodgers lose in HD.  I would come again, and probably not eat the pizooki."
Tiare A.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,3,,3.0,5/23/2011,"Besides having the waitress spill me water in front of our table, it is a very nice restaurant. Happening and busy on a Saturday night...but we still got a table within 15 minutes. Food was ok..I had the Blonde Shrimp. Very tasty although I wasn't impressed with the wedge fries (lack of flavor)."
Bonnie O.,"Rowland Heights, CA",185,3,2,4.0,1/29/2011,"i ve been there 2 times ,i like the Avocado egg roll so much.its really yummy.There is also very nice interior design.Feeling romantic.good dating space.^_^...But they really slow of service. Once I was waiting for my pizza almost 1 hur.its my problem?"
Party_of_five _.,"Diamond Bar, CA",0,41,,1.0,2/29/2012,Worst service ever. Waited 10 minutes just for someone to take my drink order and then another 10 for it to come and they still forgot something. Then the waitress completely forgot about us and waited on a bigger party..ridiculous. Walked out and was stopped by the manager who apologized and offered me a free meal. A little too late. Needless to say I'm never going back! Giving one star is being too kind.
Jacky L.,"Rowland Heights, CA",0,9,,4.0,1/14/2013,"I go here quite often, because of the close proximity to my workplace.  This place generally has tasty foods, and is great to watch a game (if your a sports fan).  The beer is good, and the food is decent as well.  The appetizers can get pretty pricey, so don't bombard yourself, or you will not be able to enjoy your entree."
George T.,"Santa Ana, CA",32,30,2,1.0,9/27/2012,Worst customer service of any restaurant ever.....online ordering is a waste of time. Order wasn't even sent to the kitchen...manager didn't even acknowledge a mistake was made or even said sorry. Guess she forgot how to talk to a real person. Maybe I should text my order to a server next time. They all like to use their phone anyways while working.
Jim S.,"Moscow, ID",0,5,,1.0,11/4/2013,i love this place on any other day but monday!  no sound on the game for monday night football....wtf!!  just in the bar would be nice!!   out of here!
