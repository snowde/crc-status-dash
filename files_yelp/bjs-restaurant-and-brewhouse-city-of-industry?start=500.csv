Maatje T.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",0,19,,2.0,10/13/2012,"Service was excellent.  Wide variety of food.  (Check menu online.)  It was LOUD.  We asked for a table to the far side, where it was still loud.  The noise was unbearable, so we left after the appetizer course."
Krystal L.,"Diamond Bar, CA",24,14,,5.0,8/8/2012,really good food! love the pizzas and you HAVE to try a pizookie! it's a must! when you tell them it's your birthday you get a pizookie for free ;)
Deepa S.,"Diamond Bar, CA",63,60,1,5.0,4/6/2012,"I cant praise this BJ's enough. We went there for dinner with our family and received awesome food and I cannot the praise the service enough. Our daughter has a food allergy and the chef came out to speak to us about options and the process they used to cook her food to ensure there is no cross contamination. This is now going to be our regular hang out since no restaurant has ever done that for us. We usually get the eye roll,,,yeah right she's allergic to milk and think we're crazy or we're going to cause extra work. We never got that impression here. I am very impressed with the service at this BJs. The food was amazing as well. Thanks so much BJ's we really appreciate the extra attention you give people with food allergies."
M G.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",1,55,,4.0,7/20/2012,"I got a chance to check this place out when they first opened courtesy of the boss. They were testing out their new waiters, so free lunch! I always drink their root beer, which is served ice cold and fantastic. Definitely get the chips and spinach dip while you're waiting for your main dish. The waiters are always friendly and make sure you're taken care of. Love them! It does get very busy at times, but a little wait is worth it."
Mark B.,"La Habra, CA",0,3,,1.0,6/3/2012,I used to eat at BJs in Brea all the time and really liked it. I visited this new location today and was very unhappy. The pizza was cold and had very skimpy amount of toppings. The salad didnt seem fresh tomatoes were soggy and seemed old. I was very suprised wont go back.

Elijah Q.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",53,185,14,4.0,1/19/2011,Been here 3 times and had no problems what so ever.One thing that stood out from the bj's in west co..is that noise level here is so much better i can actually here my table talk...not have to yell.Parking is a plus to...parking in front and back.Serive is ok not too good but not bad either.I also like the out door patio seating very nice.Stay away on a friday night all im saying.
JR M.,"West Covina, CA",152,102,,3.0,12/15/2010,"BJ's in Industry. I want to like you more but your first impression was very sub par. The waiter was very meh...welll...he was rude. He got nicer later in the dinner but maybe cause he noticed we weren't the happiest in regards to his service. He got one of the pazookie orders wring but at least he wiped that from the check. But other than that, this BJ's location was decent. Nothing too special about it. It's rather busy but it's still new. It seems to be smaller that expected but that doesn't really get in the way. Food is good but not stupendous. I'm not going to refer people here if they are craving any other than a pazookie, which are still great here. the pizzas are good too, those are usually what I order. The beers, which they prize kinda brag about are meh. They have the usual macrobrews which is expected, but their special brewhouse beers aren't really memorable. Definitely not up to Yardhouse or pub standards that I'm used to. I had the eight beer sampler and only two impressed me (Tatonka Stout and Piranha Pale Ale). The locale in an of itself is great. Brand new, flashy, great location on restaurant row and it's right by the theater. Definitely no complaints about where it is and the building itself. If the waiter was better (I know there's good waiters there lol) and if they had a better beer selection I would have given this place a better recommendation."
Heather V.,"Fullerton, CA",17,6,4,1.0,5/8/2011,"Until today, I thought BJs could do no wrong, after all they feed me my favorite dessert ever, the pizookie... BUT... Tonight I was given the wrong drink, they forgot to bring us our appetizer, our pizza took well over 30 minutes to come out, and the huge party next to us had this kid running around the table with balloons, the kid runs into a bus boy carrying a a tray of drinks and of course a drink falls to the ground. This would have been fine if the contents of that drink didn't come raining down all over where I was sitting. They promptly cleaned up the mess and apologized, the manager came and said he would comp our dessert we ordered, but we got the check and nothing was comped. At that point I was over it and just wanted to leave, so we paid and left without making a fuss. But that was the worst BJs experience ever. So not worth $50 to have your order repeatedly messed up, be spilled on, and then lied to by the restaurant manager..."
Reina J.,"Glendora, CA",57,42,97,4.0,11/9/2010,"Im a fan of Bj's for sure! I tried the new one in puente/industry area. I'm actually sad to say I was a little disappointed. It was packed, we got a table in 10minutes. The fast seating was great. They sat us next to the kitchen and it was real busy. I don't mind that because I'm a people watcher and I could watch everyone moving around. I liked the waitress even though there was a lag on the food. She blamed it on the kitchen. One of my favorite things to eat there is the spinach artichoke dip, its the best ever!!! That took atleast thirty minutes to come out. It took so long the manager offered it to us for free. Which was kinda cool, that i didn't have to complain. It seemed as if the restaurant is still getting adjusted to the busy crowd. I was forgiving because its Bj's....all in all the pizza, dip and drinks were great. Its kinda a big location too... nice decor and friendly employees!"
Rachael l.,"San Dimas, CA",0,4,,1.0,3/21/2011,I went here a couple of nights ago with my boyfriend all i have to say is F this place... seriously. The manager needs to hire better servers especially not a douce bag...And the guy that serve was bald fyi if you get him.
