Judy a.,"Ontario, CA",26,256,185,5.0,4/25/2017,"I went here for a birthday party, I never knew you could have a private party in the back, I really enjoyed the whole set up, endless pizza salad and drinks, I will definitely consider having a party here myself, The buffalo chicken pizza is the Business."
Carol L.,"Walnut, CA",0,22,,1.0,6/7/2017,"This review is on their customer service. If there is a zero star, I will choose that. I called today (Wednesday) at 7:30 to make a reservation for party of 11 for Saturday. The lady who answered the call said "" we are in the middle of rush hour. Call back later."" I thought she said she would call back, and she said ""no, you will have to call back later. ""  I could not believe my ears. I called another BJ and made a dinner reservation without problem."
Kerri P.,"Santa Monica, CA",105,190,165,2.0,8/20/2016,"How does it take three tries to get potato skins without bacon right??? The manager came out frustrated and said ""apparently my kitchen doesn't know how to make anything without bacon."""
Dennis L.,"West Covina, CA",8,26,32,4.0,9/1/2016,I had the BJ cheeseburger and it was very Juicy!  The service was really good the noise was not loud at all and overall I enjoyed my experience at this location.  Will come here again!
Gabriel T.,"West Covina, CA",145,166,344,3.0,3/26/2016,"Our server Bruce was great. Very courteous and prompt. However the steak was terrible.. over cooked, and too salty.  Bad food experience to what is usually a good time a BJs. 3 stars for service only."
Geena B.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",0,14,6,2.0,2/26/2017,"We sit at the bar to finish watching the Lakers lose. We are greeted with an awesome waiter Eddie. We order our drinks and apps. Order our food, all is good. Theres a gnat flying around in the restaurant/bar. No bueno. We have food still sitting out. We asked for boxes, to avoid the nats getting to our food.  #1 gnats in a restaurant GROSS #2 gnats no bueno, But we wanted to get our drink on.  We planned on boxing up our food then ordering more drinks. Gnats dont like beer or alcohol  Eddie brinks me my tab. I laughed and said we weren't done, meaning i was still willing to spend more money on drinks despite the gnats s and all.  Instead of being happy he'd get more of my money, he was insulted that i was not in a hurry to leave.   Or that i called him out on his eager rush to send me on my way. Wait isn't it customary to ask, if i will have dessert, wait u guys usually ask did i leave room for dessert.  At no time was that question asked.  Yet Eddie continued on about his shift being non chalant, unengaged and insulted that i was not ready to leave. Wtf Didnt like how he only asked my husband if he wanted water, or anymore drinks. Hello i am at the same table.  Even after i paid the tab, and tipped him well, despite his attitude.  I like to tip well, i appreciate the food service industy, yet he didnt come by to say thank you, come again, thats ok maybe i wont, ill take my money elsewhere. Yard house, lazy dog, cpk, kabuki, anywhere but here."
Connie K.,"La Mirada, CA",40,24,14,3.0,5/7/2017,So I haven't been to BJs in Awhile and I went last Friday and order The Great White large pizza and it was amazing ! Service was just Ok we were a party of 9 but that shouldn't matter never got our appetizer the calamari so was disappointed that I had to mention it didn't come to the table she did remove it from the bill but not the point ! It was a birthday celebration and we accidentally left a gift at the table when we got to the car we realized so went back and the waitress and bus people were rummaging through the gift instead of giving it to the front and leaving it for us to pick up really sad to walk up and to see everything out from the bag so that's why they get a three food was awesome service not-so-good and disappointed at the waitresses actions about the gift left on the table BJ check your Waiter.
Cecilia S.,"Claremont, CA",0,80,4,1.0,4/29/2017,"Worse service ever. Took forever to bring my husband's tea.  Never brought requested water. Second glass of wine came after our dessert arrived, yet ordered before. Manager came over and asked how everything was. 7;30 and restaurant does not even have a wait list. Enough said. Will stick to West Covina BJ. Get your act together."
Joseph L.,"Los Angeles, CA",429,237,686,2.0,12/29/2015,"BJ's = cookie cutter restaurant. I always leave BJ's feeling cheated.  I always forget that it tastes like a TV dinner someone popped into their microwave. The food is always way too salty no matter how many times I let my waiter or waitress know.  I mean, I don't blame them.   This location gets pretty busy during lunch hour so if you have an hour lunch you'd be pressed on time here.  The lunch specials are not bad but not the greatest either. The best part of BJ's is probably still the pizookie apart from that I'm left a bit broken hearted."
Coleen G.,"Diamond Bar, CA",0,7,2,1.0,5/21/2017,"Went there for my son's birthday and nothing but issues with waiter.  Spoke to manager the following day about all the issues we had. She said she would send some certificates out. This happened in May. Still no certificates. Not too interested in going back to this location.  Manager said she should send gift card to apologize.  That never happened.  A year later (yesterday), his girlfriend took him for his birthday. Twice they asked for his birthday Pazookie and he never did get it. The restaurant was not very busy. They had two different waiters at their table. They ended up walking out with no Pazookie. Seriously though, the service at this location absolutely sucks!!!!"
Mary T.,"Westminster, CA",1279,348,381,3.0,11/19/2015,"Great service. Our server was really nice and patient throughout the entire time-- especially since my boyfriend was being so indecisive! She was super nice to have offered a sample of the beers that he wanted so he can make a decision. Points for that!!  We came here for the late night happy hour, but I think they don't have as many food options on the happy hour menu here as other BJ's Restaurants do. There was the late night happy hour from 10pm-close, but I feel like the happy hour here is a tad bit more expensive than other places. I'm not sure I'd go here again for the happy hour, but service is good though!"
Gaston V.,"San Dimas, CA",63,35,3,1.0,4/6/2017,"Service use to be pretty decent here. Food was good but not sure what's up with this bus boy, perhaps server by the name of Steve. He was annoyed when we asked him for a fork, then annoyed when we asked him for a refill. I thought servers were suppose to serve?  Perhaps that makes too much sense. Good was still decent. Hopefully managements can look at these reviews and make some adjustment to the quality of service at this place."
Connor K.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",97,133,34,2.0,8/26/2016,"Not much to say about this place. It is a decent chain and people go because they want something familiar. The service has been poor at times, incredibly rude on one occassion and after that I swore I would not go back to this location. The food is mediocre and typical of a chain restaurant with too many items. A lot of options and none of them excellent. Prices are a bit high but the ambiance is nice enough. It is one of the few chains I can be convinced to eat at. Mostly though, the smaller restautants are almost always better run with better food because they do not rely on a big brand name."
April L.,"Pomona, CA",1,7,,5.0,5/11/2017,I always come to this location since it's down the street from my work but yesterday I ordered to-go since I was in the area. I was able to place my order at 4 and was able to pick it up at 6:30ish as I requested. The food was hot and delicious! Their Peach Berry Iced Tea is to die for! The gentlemen who took my phone and assisted me was Anthony and he was so sweet and attentive. He let me know the kitchen was a little backed up and my food would be out shortly. He stepped out to hand me a drink as I waited. Thank you so much Anthony. Service like this is the reason why I will keep going back. :)
Mickolai B.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",97,10,2,3.0,4/9/2017,"Service has really gone down. We got seated and the table floor was dirty and wasn't cleaned from the previous party. There were silverware utensils on the floor and the black napkins. When were seated, no utensils were provided to us even after appetizers were served."
Jerome P.,"Long Beach, CA",0,1,2,1.0,6/25/2016,"Service was great, our server Joel was nice. We came here to enjoy a nice early dinner, everything was great until my entree came out. Ordered the grilled chicken alfredo and after a few several bites I noticed something in my plate. I was hoping for the best, but it turned out to be a MASSIVE FLY and immediately my appetite was gone. When we brought the fly to our servers attention he immediately took the plate to the back and told the manager. When the manager came out she was understanding as we were both speechless, you hear about this type of incident happen but never experience it, unfortunately today this was the first time something like this happened to me. They told us they would bring us a new plate but I declined, my appetite was gone at this point, I was glad they were willing to comp the dinner, but still this was unacceptable. Although the service was good, I don't think we will be returning anytime soon because of this incident."
Elle C.,"Santa Barbara, CA",138,19,4,5.0,10/20/2016,Steven the manager rocked the house! he turned a mediocre experience (busy night) into an AWESOME ONE!!! He made us feel like he cared about us with his genuine and thoughtful interactions. PS SKINNY RITAS ARE THE BEST
Sam M.,"La Puente, CA",0,15,7,5.0,11/13/2016,Enjoying great pizza drinks and friends. Great service from all staff.  My go to drink now on is a strawberry patch. The Bartender knows what he is doing.
Daisy M.,"West Covina, CA",81,11,2,2.0,11/14/2017,"Only reason I am giving 2 stars its not always horrible when I go but I hate doing that coin flip thing, I have only had a hand full of good waiters there but always seems that I every time I go now I get the same waiter.... now I wouldn't mind this if he wasn't such a rude guy, I have had him twice and both times he had the biggest attitude I have every seen, First time it was a double date and we had told him from the beginning we are splitting the checks and we got one check which is fine we just kindly remind him we are paying separately and he rolled his eyes and came back 10 min. Later and we paid our separate checks and that was that, but he had the audacity to tell us if you guys are paying in cash just pool your money next time it makes it easier on us waiters, I get it I work in the food industry too but I don't think he should make comments like that towards us, very unprofessional, second time was when I had a gathering of 15 people for my birthday, now we weren't being to complicated we only split the check 3 ways, which again I know its difficult but better than being 10 different checks, mind you I was celebrating my birthday, so I am trying to have a good time, have a few drinks and eat dinner with my friends and family, again same waiter and he goes through taking the orders, looks annoyed and probably doesn't want to be there but whatever, everyone orders and we wait, some of the food or drinks never came out and we were still charged we asked him to remove the items because they never came and he was like, I can bring them out now (one hour later than we had ordered them) but he keeps insisting we just accept it but we declined and just asked him to remove the items because we don't want them anymore we were ready to head out, I haven't gone back to bjs since this, so it has been since June and Im scared to go back but if I do I swear if I get this waiter again I will either ask for someone else or leave, I will maybe try again in a few months for now I will take my service elsewhere."
Hannah W.,"Irvine, CA",70,42,23,4.0,12/28/2016,We just had lunch here with my bff and I think this is one of the better locations. She had the poke and I had the bison burger. Good was great and a nice way to spend a Wednesday afternoon lunch.
