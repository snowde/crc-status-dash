Rene M.,"Newbury Park, Newbury Park, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/2/2017,"Everything is going fine until we paid the check and we still stay at our table. I ask our waiter for a refill of my ice tea.... nothing. After a while, i couldn't find the waiter anymore so I ask this Asian waitress for a glass of ice water.... nothing.  It seems like they start ignoring you as soon as you pay your check. I'm so disappointed and I'm not going back there anymore. We got there at 7:00 pm for dinner and the prime rib is gone. Time/date of visit: Thursday at about 7:00 pm., 4/27/13 Thank you Steven for your response."
Anthony C.,"Rosemead, CA",0,14,1,1.0,6/17/2017,"So a coworker and I decided to eat here for a Friday for a late lunch at like 2ish on 6/16/17. We were immediately seated since there weren't much people there at the time. So It's the usual ask us what to drink and give us time to think what we wanted to eat. After we ordered our food it took a ridiculously long time to receive(we ordered salads) there is no reason for it to take as long as it did. After we got our food there was no settings for us so we sat around and try to flag someone down, but no one would pay attention to us at all. My coworker had to get up herself and walk over to the front and get settings for us to even eat our food. After we were finally ready to eat. They messed up on her order and put wasabi in it, which made it pretty unbearable for her to eat. While we were there the waitress never checked up on us and they never offered us the free apps that supposedly comes with our meal since we spent way more then enough money.  Horrible location with horrible staff. If you can avoid coming to this location. You definitely should."
Katie B.,"Pomona, CA",142,1,,2.0,11/18/2016,"I just had to leave a review after my visit here because I was so shocked by the service. My friend and I came in for a late night dessert (around 10:30) and the waiter was completely pleasant with us until he heard we only wanted pizookies and an appetizer. Once he heard that, he didn't so much as make eye contact with us the rest of the night and he was extremely rude. The tip of the iceberg was when he left the check he told us to let him know if we  needed anything (even though his attitude showed he really didn't care) and my friend immediately said ""oh, excuse me, could we get a box, please?"" And he CONTINUED walking away without even acknowledging her request (mind you he stopped at the booth next to us and the restaurant WASN'T even busy) and I was fine with it at first, because I thought he hadn't heard her, but when he came back with the check he had her box and it was clear he was just being a jerk. The only time he was even near cordial to us again was when he tried to make small talk as he handed us the check. Clearly he wanted a good tip even though I go above and beyond what he did for NOTHING extra at my job. The only reason I gave this restaurant 2 stars is because my food came out good. This server, who's name was Michael, completely ruined my experience."
Francis F.,"West Covina, CA",81,68,33,3.0,1/27/2016,"Parking: Big private lot, so it's not hard to park at all. It does tend to get a bit logjammed since it shares the same entrance as the Golden Corral next door. Place: Usually easy to find bar seating. Dining area is comfortable as well. TVs everywhere to watch whichever games are on that day. Bartenders are also really friendly. Price: Standard chain restaurant prices ($10-20, depending on what your order). Happy hour is the way to go with apps and pizza on the cheap. They also knock a buck off beers during HH. Pfood: Good food. Can't go wrong with a Great White pizza. I recently had a top sirloin (solid) and it came with a pretty dope Broccoli Cheddar soup and Caesar Salad. Pizzookies are the best here too. Salted Caramel is the way to go. As for beer, Jeremiah Red is a must. I'll be back again."
Marie P.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",935,97,947,5.0,9/6/2015,"I've eaten at this Bj several times and I don't know why I haven't written a review for it. I really love the location of this place. It really is surrounded by many restaurants. Its very close to my house which is a plus. They have a really great happy hour! Who wouldn't love good food at a cheaper price!  I've never had a bad experience here. Staff is always friendly and very efficient. Which for me makes the whole dining experience even better! The deep dish pizzas are always good! I've had the Bj favorite and it is so packed with so much flavor! And that crispy crust, yummo!!!  Now on to my absolute favorite, pizookie! What is not to like about a warm cookie and a huge  scoop of ice cream on it!! Genius! All the flavors are so good! But my ultimate favorite is the white chocolate with macadamia nut! If you seriously haven't tried a pizookie, your definitely missing out!!"
Nigina I.,"Everett, MA",1,21,7,1.0,5/12/2016,"First of all terrible staff!!! I work at the fast paced office environment, where every minute matters. My lunch is only 30 min, that's why I usually pre order my lunch online on Panera Breed's website. Yesterday I found out that BJs also has this option and decided to check it out. I preordered everything and showed up on the scheduled time.  Even though,Restaurant was empty,I was sitting there for 20 min trying to get the attention of the waiters, finally somebody showed up and asked me to order, I had to repeat what I told the reception , it took another 20 min to wait there. So I had to leave without food since I was late ! When I told the reception that I am leaving she looked at me bitchy. Terrible service !!! Terrible place"
Alysia A.,"Upland, CA",222,39,15,5.0,7/15/2016,First of all. My appetizer came out before my food...wtf is that about!? My beer was cold. Who'd a thunk it.  I got a straw with my lemonade. ...that's racist.. Obviously. I'm kidding.  Lawrence was awesome. Very attentive. Food was awesome. Service was amazing! We'll be back!!!! The only downfall was the little boy soliciting the patio tables asking for money from guests while the father (wearing a Best Dad Ever shirt) watched outside. This just happened while I'm writing this. ... Too bad the patio wall is small.
Charlton C.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",1001,318,330,4.0,9/23/2014,"I have never actually dined in at this location before; I would always take it to go so I was excited to see how the experience was like.  My friend and I decided to come here on a whim since everyone else was not as appealing to us. It was a Saturday night, it was quite busy but we noticed that there was nobody sitting in the outdoor area. We asked if we could go sit there because it was too cold inside and they accommodated us quickly.  Too start off, I ordered a cocktail that was created at one of their other restaurants called ""A drink like that"" which consisted of Grey Goose Vodka, BACARDI 151, Rum, DeKuyper Pucker Sour Apple, DeKuyper Pucker Island Blue, Sweet & Sour, Sierra Mist,  and Grenadine. After perusing through the menu we decided to order the appetizer Avocado eggs rolls and a deep dish BBQ pizza to share. The eggs rolls came out quick and were very delicious. Nice and crisp on the outside and creamy on the inside as you would expect it. I can see myself just ordering this and be satisfied.  The pizza was also delicious and very filling, we could not finish it. The server was very nice and friendly, though since we sat outside the service was kind of slow since there was no dedicated server to check up on us.  Overall my experience was pleasant and I would come back again. I didn't get to try out the Pizookie sadly and that is on my list of what to order next time."
Kane C.,"La Puente, CA",1,2,6,5.0,3/18/2017,"Me and my wife had some wings and drinks. The root beer wings are delicious and the drinks were great. The waiter was very polite and nice. Very attentive, just wished I remembered his name. Hahaha"
Robert R.,"Walnut, CA",4,15,5,4.0,1/31/2017,"Good stuff! My wife and myself like to come in on the weekday happy hours before the work rush comes in, the place is empty and you get decent attentiveness. For being happy hour it's still a bit pricey, but we can't get enough of the avocado rolls and calamari. The pizza is average, and the home brewed beers are alright too. But we do enjoy coming here."
Laurel F.,"Madera, CA",0,3,,1.0,3/4/2017,"This was by far one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had-the beer was warm and flat-no chilled glasses. I asked for a different beer-he accused me of drinking half and asking for another! He then asked if I was ""okay?""-not sure what he was implying. I was more than happy to pay for my warm beers! I never asked for ""free"" beer. This experience will go to the corporate office. Manager never stepped in. So much for customer service! BJ's never again! Waiter-Grayson."
Adam M.,"La Habra, CA",80,5,,5.0,3/17/2017,Was here with my GF and Jeffery was our waiter. We truly appreciated Jeffery's customer service. Thank BJ's for your bouzouki cookies!
Dena W.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",36,55,77,3.0,8/14/2017,"Unfortunately, 3rd time wasn't a charm. First two times, the service was very poor and I don't remember what I ate. I didn't want to go back, but my niece insisted that she loves BJs and they don't have one where she lives, so I gave it a 3rd try. Service was much better this time, but no wait on Saturday at 7pm and lots of empty tables was probably why. We ordered appetizers. They were pretty good. The burgers looked awesome! But I didn't order one! I Definitely like the spinach artichoke dip. One of our entrees preceded the 3rd appetizer. Waiter apologized for the error. Another server had brought it. I ordered the chicken with soba noodles. It didn't look anything like the photo. It was all noodles and the pieces of chicken were the size of cashews, not big chunks like the photo and only a few pieces of broccoli. The flavor was good. My hubby ordered a shrimp plate and the nice big shrimp in the photo were missing too. He pointed it out, so it's not just me. Restaurant was clean. Restroom was clean. If I get dragged back there again, I'll order a burger."
Bruce M S.,"Whittier, CA",1,7,2,2.0,3/26/2017,"1st time eating here. Food was delicious! Good job to kitchen staff. Service was not good. Had to flag down staff for everything. Utensils, water refill, forgot my soup!! Because the food was so good I will try again and hopefully a more attentive staff will be working!!!"
Ruby M.,"La Puente, CA",0,6,3,1.0,2/17/2017,Worst damn service ever . How do the appetizers come after our plates . An hour late on the rest of our dishes ... we had to wave down a server. Horrible fuck this place
Zack R.,"Corona Del Mar, CA",4,40,18,5.0,7/25/2016,"Stellar food, quick and friendly service, and a clean and huge restaurant with an outstanding ambience. It really doesn't get much better than this. I'd recommend the root bear ribs or the deep dish ravioli. Both are exquisite. This place is better than most ""fancy"" restaurants I've been to. 20/10 would come back."
Andrew H.,"South El Monte, CA",0,3,,5.0,2/8/2017,Went in a group of 4. Ordered: Best beginning app                chicken wings                large 5 meat pizza                the portobello burger                the pasta that was in a pan. Everything was good. We could've downsize the pizza to a medium and skip the pasta because we only took a bite each off of it.
Jose L.,"Rowland Heights, CA",1,6,20,5.0,10/31/2016,Avocado eggrolls!!!!! Been coming here for years. They changes the recipe of the eggrolls but there still the best around. Fish n chips are really good. Bbq chicken pizza is my favorite joshua took good care of us will be coming back real soon.
Mia B.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",0,6,,2.0,4/9/2016,"Service was slow and horrible our waiter did not give us any utensils or plates even when the appetizers arrived !  He never asked if we are ok or if we needed anything & had to track him down to finally order , they have the right amount of waiters but in my opinion need to be trained more  Food and beer was good but service was NOT"
Jennifer C.,"Rowland Heights, CA",466,253,934,3.0,5/18/2015,"I've come here a few times, I just think it's alright. Happy hour pricing is decent, but I think regular pricing is a bit steep.  Food is decent and my favorite is their avocado rolls and pazookies! Drinks: Huge selection of beers and drinks but I wouldn't recommend coming here just to drink because it will add up and be pricey! The place is huge inside so it's great for large parties if you want to have a business lunch or bday dinner.   Staff is nice and I really liked our waitress! She was really attentive to us and friendly. Wish I got her name.  Private parking lot to park in.  Overall, it's not a place I can come to eat/drink often only due to price. Maybe once a month..and I work and live close by!"
