Raymond G.,"Tampa, FL",302,344,139,5.0,11/15/2017,"I have to say I shied away from this place for a while because it gave off a big corporate feel and I didn't think there brews would be as good as some smaller local places....I don't really like the weird color chart they have going because there is way more to beer than just color. But...there beer is actually pretty good. I got to try a few different kinds and I enjoyed each one.  The food here is also pretty yummy. The price seems fair for what you are getting on your plate. Its flavorful and sharable if you want to share. haha. I love looking at a menu and thinking, ""man I can't wait to come back and try this!"" The service is friendly, fast and helpful. Some things on the menu can always be confusing when its your first time at a restaurant, its nice when there server seems knowledgable about things. We actually came here from a different restaurant where we had been waiting to get served for over 20 min....after waiting that long we just left and came here. Man what a difference.  All in all its a clean place, with good service, good food, and great beer. 5 stars because I'll be back."
Robin N.,"Clearwater, Tampa Bay, FL",5,42,123,4.0,9/4/2017,"Aside from the wait time for our apps, this place has delicious food!! And as much as I hate waiting when I'm hungry, it was worth the wait! Apps: Get the Nashville Hot Wings!! These are some of the Best wings I've had (Top 5!) Perfectly seasoned, and just the right kick of heat! Drinks: The Raspberry Sparkling lemonade was great! Atmosphere: You can hang meat in this place. They had the AC kicking!! Entre: I had an absolute amazing Burger. The Hickory and Brisket Bacon burger was Killa!! Also had the 9"" deep dish pizza which was tasty but came out luke warm and was also pricey at $15.95!  All in all good dining experience. Spoke to the manager about the 20 minute wait for the Delicious wings and he made it right.  Overall, Great place to eat with a large selection of food drink and deserts! Cheers. Rob"
Judy B.,"Palm Harbor, FL",4,48,6,4.0,8/6/2017,We enjoy coming to BJ's for their great  happy hour specials and when we are looking for a quick bite. Appetizers are half price and the selection is extensive. They offer some great prices on beer and wines as well. Service was good and the food was very good. One of our regular go-to places when we are not super hungry.
Kim B.,"Safety Harbor, FL",99,76,47,4.0,7/26/2017,"This place has a large menu with a lot of different options, and even some healthy options. Both times I've been here, we've been at the bar. The atmosphere is classic but casual. Very clean! I would have no issue watching a game here. They have lots of beers to choose from and some great wines as well!. I'm a wine drinker and I have no complaints about the quality.  My husband and I split the sliders appetizer with fries. Beware the extras on the sliders - they charge! $13 is a little high for adding bacon and cheese.  All in all a good experience. Will be back."
Mike B.,"Safety Harbor, FL",83,105,232,4.0,7/24/2017,"Second time here and still digging it. Spacious bar area too. We had a couple drinks and some sliders for lunch. They have their own branded beers too. I had the BJ PIRANHA PALE ALE for $5.50 and found it to be good. The sliders are bigger than normal but with bacon and cheese at $13 was a pinch high on price, more value around $10. During a busy lunch run, the wait for our food was 14.5 minutes, decent. Vibe- 4 Taste-4 Value-3 Service-3.5 Wait Time- 4 Cleanliness-4 Overall 3.75 stars"
Paul K.,"Bradenton, FL",70,7,8,5.0,11/11/2017,"Our server, Kendall, was sweet, fun and accommodating! Great atmosphere and excellent  service. They care of their Veterans, too!"
Tom D.,"Dunedin, Tampa Bay, FL",111,270,719,4.0,3/12/2017,"Perfect example of excellent, caring, taking pride in our business pays off causing a three star review into a four.  I came in here starving, was thinking of going to another place but the wait was too long. I've seen this place many times but never looked them up so I was going on blind (also didn't realize they were a chain). First impression is this place is large and must have cost a fortune to build. When I saw the menu it reminded me of the Cheesecake Factory and not in a good way. The menu is a little book, scattered menu items throughout. Way too many offerings in my opinion but if you fill up a restaurant that large I guess you need to keep everyone happy.  I ordered the jalapeño burger. They provide a nice steak knife and it was a good size so I cut it in half. There was not a sign of any red inside for my medium rare request. Since I was starving and don't like to send back food I took a bite and it was quite good. The very attentive bartender came over after the first bite and asked how it was. I stated it was not medium rare but I'll still eat it cause it tastes that good. He stated it was no problem to cook another. I declined. He offered a free dessert. I declined assuring him it was fine and just some constructive criticism because he asked. A minute later the head chef came out and he could see the half of the burger that was not yet eaten. He now apologizes and again asks if they can make me something in a polite way. I decline  A few minutes later the manager gets wind of this and apologizes and insists on discounting my bill.  This is great service. They really take pride in their product and quality. All three gentlemen get major kudos from me. It is nice to point out a problem and not be criticized. It is also nice that they checked on the meal to realize there was a problem. So many do not do this anymore."
Krystal A.,"Oldsmar, FL",169,501,1608,4.0,2/26/2017,BJ Brewhouse has a very extensive menu and is always busy. The best part is that you can place your name on the list through their app and there is always some kind of special going on. I got their ahi tuna salad and enjoyed it a lot. The salad dressing was flavorful and there were dollops of wasabi on the edges in case you wanted to spice it up a bit. I have had many of their appetizers before and never disliked any.  You can't go wrong with their pizookies either. Can't decide on a flavor? Get the sampler to taste 3 different ones.
Erik G.,"Maryland Heights, MO",48,9,1,4.0,12/23/2017,"I've been going to BJ's for years now and I have to admit this is a wonderful restaurant especially when you don't know exactly what you're in a mood for which is why HUGE menu makes this one of my favorite restaurants. Great service, great beers and the pizcookie to die for!"
Dave W.,"Safety Harbor, FL",356,1094,2638,4.0,11/20/2016,"We had a large party here for a football game (Go Gators!). The game went on and on with no clear lead. The whole thing came down to the very last play. I couldn't help but think we could have done something else and watched the replay later but hey, I haven't watched a game from beginning to end in quite a while. I'll blame it on my short attention span. The service was very friendly and professional so we had no issues. I ordered a tall drink with lots of fruit juice and fruit in it with extra cherries. Yes, I'm now a lightweight! The kids in our party each were able to enjoy one (cherry, not drinks silly)! Our food was of the american-chain-restaurant cuisine which isn't typically my favorite. It depends to be under seasoned and safe. On the plus side, the menu is huge so I'm sure you can find something to your liking! However, the Pizookie dessert was fun and delicious. It's like a soft fresh baked cookie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Next time, I'll stick with drinks and dessert!"
Karen S.,"Los Angeles, CA",282,27,41,4.0,5/23/2017,"I like coming here early Tuesday afternoon's for the half price wine (all day) & appetizers (Happy Hour M-F, 3-7) and going to an early movie at the mall. I do NOT like coming here during dinner time. It's too noisy. I don't know why they can't make the acoustics in the restaurants so that you can hear the person sitting next to you when they talk! It's very nerve-racking and not a good way to eat food in a chaotic loud environment. (THE reason I don't give them 5-stars.) But the thing I like most about BJ's these days is that they are adding a lot of vegetarian healthy foods to the menu! I think this is a key factor that is going to make or break restaurants over the next five years. I'm really glad to see BJ's is giving it a go! Now if they would only cook with organic produce and organic grass fed meats..."
Kit M.,"Palm Harbor, FL",35,41,12,5.0,12/6/2017,"Perfect evening at BJ's.  Years ago, we were regulars but stopped going because of a couple of so-so experiences.   Last night we decided to go back.  We were greeted by very nice hostesses.  Our server was Kendall, and she was awesome.  She greeted us promptly and was helpful in my dinner selection.  Throughout our meal, she was very attentive and sweet, My husband ordered the bacon cheeseburger with sweet potatoe fries, and I had the kale and roasted brussel sprout salad.  We both loved our dinners.  That salad was outstanding. We had such a good experience that we asked to speak to the manager (Ryan) and let him know.  He was such a pleasure to speak with.   We will be back!"
Thomas D.,"Clearwater, Tampa Bay, FL",0,16,1,4.0,12/4/2017,"I went to BJ's twice in the past month. Both times on a Saturday evening. The waiting time wasn't bad and the girl at front desk was nice and competent. The place was good and comfortable but the second time we were seating under an AC vent and it was FREEZING. Otherwise there is TV with football. Food is good. I ordered burgers both times and I really like them. They are cooked well and tasty. A special note to the dessert. I got the baked bignet. It is FANTASTIC! Price is ok. Me and my wife spent $50 for both of us including tip, so its not too expensive."
John S.,"Downey, CA",61,343,2081,4.0,7/25/2016,"The 2016 YELP 500, Review #228: I have been disappointed here many times but, never when the server has been Ron.   LEAD IN: With my job I have traveled around the world quite a bit over the past 30 years.  I have seen some good places, some bad and some really ugly ones... I have eaten in all three.  My first BJ's experience was in Portland, OR when my boss took treated a few of us to dinner. I noted that they had 57 things on the menu that I liked.... and I am a healthy eater, my unhealthy friends call it finicky.. whatever. I was sold on the place. Back to Clearwater, FL.   I came here on a first date and my waiter never forgot me or my date.. further more he memorized what I had to eat each time... Now let me say, my visits aren't several times in a week... I get deployed for long periods of time, so this makes Ron's memory all the more impressive. The menu has changed a good bit over the years but, they still have an amazing selection... enough to keep everyone content... even the finicky guy. Big enough for a party, plenty of TVs, restrooms are always tidy, parking is plentiful but since it is at a mall near Whole foods, other restaurants that are open after the mall closes and the movie theater.  Parking can be a serious hassle at times.  Having a parking garage in the south/southwest side of the mall would be quite beneficial... even if it was only two floors.  Just an attempt to park double the cars in the same footprint would be nice. I would recommend this restaurant to others and although this location has messed up my meals 5-6 times and other locations did too... such as Citrus Park, Beaverton, Portland (2X) and Downey, CA (Read my review of that last one) I give  them 4 stars based on Ron being the most flawless server I have experienced ever. Thanks Ron! Respectfully I Remain, John (that works on the Missile Tracker)"
Kathleen L.,"Seminole, FL",0,72,3,4.0,11/27/2017,"Second time at BJs, but first time at the Clearwater store. We decided to sit at the bar for lunch and Chelsea, bartender, was great. We each ordered a BJ's IPA and then looked at the extensive menu. The choice was really difficult because everything looked good. In addition we were seeing all of the yummy plates coming from the kitchen. Decided on the roasted brussel sprout appetizer, cheeseburger, and the pick 2 lunch. The California chicken club and wedge salad was tasty. My guy said his burger is the best he has had since moving to Florida.  We saw that their happy hour is from 3-7 with $4 craft beer and 1/2 price appetizers. We can't wait to try it out."
Alan W.,"Clearwater, FL",8,134,73,2.0,5/21/2017,"I was excited to meet some friends for dinner here tonight.  Unfortunately the food was a let down.  I ordered a chicken & avocado club sandwich.  It cost almost $12.  The grilled chicken sandwich arrived on thin slices of bread.  The chicken was barely lukewarm which was not pleasant.   The small sandwich just wasn't that great.  It seemed overpriced by 4-5 dollars.  My wife got a soup & salad combo for $10.  The salad was only average.  The bowl of tortilla soup that came with it was tasty.  However the bowl arrived half empty.  I spoke up on her behalf, & the very kind waiter lamented that they serve it with 2.5 ladle-fills of soup & that means the bowls come out very empty.  We were not very impressed at all by the food quality & by the pricing.  I did give them 2 stars only because the waiter was kind & the service was excellent."
Indigo R.,"Dunedin, FL",0,27,5,4.0,7/9/2017,"I love this place. I'd give it five stars, but my boyfriend and I didn't have the best experience last time we came.  My FAVORITE salad in the entire world is their seared ahi salad. I could eat it every single day. It's filling and fresh-tasting and absolutely delicious. Their pizookies are also to die for. I'm a cookie fanatic and it's the best after-dinner treat. If I had to pick a last meal ever, it would probably be the ahi salad and a pizookie.  That being said, my boyfriend is a simple man. He does not like fancy things. He ordered a steak and French fries. This should not be difficult to mess up, but he was disappointed.  The steak was not a good consistency. I tried a bite, and it was strange. It had a similar consistency to a hamburger. It was grainy and.. mushy? It was just weird. He's not a complainer so he ate it, but he wasn't happy about it. His food also came on the TINIEST plate ever. When he took a bite, fries would fall off the side.  Still giving a 4 star review because my food has always been amazing."
Christina R.,"Safety Harbor, Tampa Bay, FL",50,141,73,4.0,4/30/2017,Came here for a late night dinner with my husband. We sat at the bar booths. It took a while for our waitress to get to us but that was the biggest complaint we had. The beers are good and the spinach and artichoke dip was good! It's in a great location at the Countryside Mall next to the movie theater. We'd definitely come back.
Wade S.,"Dunedin, FL",156,32,8,5.0,5/14/2017,"Delicious food & service with a smile!   I came in for late lunch today and brought my laptop in tow as I needed to get some Sunday work done and those middle meal times are a perfect place to sprawl out at a table and knock it out before the dinner rush arrives. I did just that. Service - My server was enthusiastic, honest, and joked with me. I told her I'd like to use my laptop and worked and she explained it's not an issue at all and we both agreed the restaurant was in between lunch and dinner. I had an iced tea that never found itself empty as she continued to fill it up. From all the iced tea drinkers in the world, We Thank You! Ambiance - Simple modern, properly lit, with architecture and seating to help a large space with volume control. Even as the dinner rush was arriving as I was leaving, you could tell everyone was speaking at typical conversational levels. Food - I had the Ahi Tuna Salad. A proper portion, mixed ingredients throughout and nice cuts of tuna on the side so I can create eat bite properly. I appreciate when a salad is mixed in with the protein set up for an ""a little in each bite"" situation. It was noticed and appreciated so thank you! The salad was full of flavor and I was scraping remaining remnants of flavor at the end while not feeling hungry, nor bloated. I will be back and I'm sure I will enjoy the same quality as from my observations, everyone was enjoying themselves much as I was while also seeing all staff in a jovial manner. Great work. Coming from working with their manager,  Anne Finklestein at Romano's Macaroni Grill back in my college days, I know she captains a good ship and knows how to make the crew feel valued and secured. She's helping to do that here at BJ's too!  Kudo's all around!"
Mike H.,"Clearwater, FL",81,70,370,5.0,10/18/2016,I've been here a couple of times for lunch and dinner. The menu is quite large but the food is good. We came here on a Tuesday for dinner and it's half off wine night. It's a great deal if you like win. I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and they were great. I'd definitely order it again. For dessert we got the Pizookie and it was delicious. It's a warm baked cookie with ice cream on top. This place is great to go out for a midrange meal.
Lauren H.,"Dunedin, FL",64,26,5,2.0,9/13/2017,"It's been almost 5 years since I've visited Bjs and it will likely be another 5,if ever, I visit again. Food was good,but very small portions. Mine came with a side,but that side wasn't available and my server didn't say anything. Service was slow, at best. He was very confused,maybe it was his 1st day....? When our food came out I asked that person if I got something to replace it. Very unorganized and chaotic and it wasnt even that busy. I saw the ""manager"" walking around and he didn't do any table checks. Not a good sign. So anyway, so plans on returning."
David B.,"Palm Harbor, FL",2,192,6,4.0,8/19/2017,"Lots of 4 stars so I will add on. We had a coupon for $10 off $35 which is a great deal. We had the Best Beginnings sampler which was large as our server Ronald warned us, he was good. We also had the Root Beer glazed ribs with slaw, the slaw as a little brown & very flat in taste. Ribs were ok, not much meat but the sauce was good. I also had the Monkey Bread dessert, that is pretty big & good for 2-3 people, I only ate half. We would go back. Manager came by our table a couple of times to check on us, he was good."
Chris W.,"Largo, FL",46,133,118,4.0,1/22/2017,"Had a great experience and some really good food. Our service was spot on and handled a couple of small issues flawlessly. I gave four stars because two of the four beers I ordered on my flight were out, our waitress replaced them with others of the same type and offered to not charge me for those if I didn't like them. The food was really good, I shared Jumbo Spaghetti and Meatballs with my oldest daughter. The sauce was not overwhelming or too sweet but just right, the meatballs were really good but heavy on the garlic. Our youngest daughter had a Bacon cheeseburger and it was terrific. The wife had a Bison burger that she really enjoyed because it is a very lean meat and good if your fat gram conscious. The beers my server brought were all good although one was mislabeled. I liked it but it was labeled as one I have on a regular basis and this was not that beer. It was good so I wish I knew what it was, haha. The atmosphere is very nice yet very comfortable. Overall this is a good place for good beer and good food with friends and family."
Brian S.,"Manassas, VA",58,34,28,3.0,4/19/2017,So this is an after work dinner by myself for a beer (or two) and a burger. So I ordered a draught stout which was quite good so I ended up with two. Really enjoyable. I ordered garlic Parmesan boneless wings and they were good but nothing to write home about. They seemed a little bland to be honest. Not a lot of garlic and not a lot of parm. I am taking most of them home for lunch tomorrow. I ordered the black and bleu house burger for dinner. The burger was cooked well done exactly as asked and the fries were again- ok- but nothing to write home about.  The server was very nice but it took a long time for her to to get to my table and even longer to get my beer. The second beer took about 15 minutes; I was sitting waiting for it long enough for me to remember to start and write this review. The food came out fast. So all in all the food is a solid 3 and the service is about a 2.5. I would come back as long as I knew I didn't have anywhere else to be.
Marcus W.,"Clearwater, FL",1,6,3,5.0,4/17/2017,This is by far one of my favorite places to go and dine in or out. Food is always great and you always get service with a smile especially when you go see Jenna.
Barbra M.,"Palm Harbor, FL",16,62,99,1.0,1/8/2017,"NEVER, ever, had a positive experience at this place! It ceases to amaze me that they continue to screw up the quality of food... what a waste! This is my final attempt to give it an opportunity.. I'm out!"
Bill G.,"Longwood, FL",4,152,62,3.0,11/19/2016,"Aggressive menu with too many choices   Most of which our party of 13 thought were ""OK"".  My ribeye and shrimp duo was just average.  $30.00 price tag was overpriced  Maybe it is really a burger and beer place?"
John G.,"New London, NH",0,24,4,3.0,7/31/2017,"Kind of a mixed bag. We started with stuffed mushrooms for an appetizer, they were excellent. I had a Brisket and Bacon burger and my wife had a Bison Burger. Both burgers were tasty, but neither was hot (I would say lukewarm), my fries were borderline cold, and her bison burger was tiny. Also slightly annoying was that my burger came out about 5 minutes before hers. I was halfway done eating as she was just getting started. I can't say the server was overly helpful, adequate would be appropriate. I didn't try any of the beers (it was early afternoon) but they have quite an extensive selection. Overall...OK. I will probably try it again sometime."
Christina G.,"Tampa, FL",1322,988,1475,4.0,4/23/2016,"Food is on point, service was super slow. Even though BJ's has a large menu, there wasn't a lot that actually appealed to me.  I do appreciate that they have a low calorie menu.  It made me realize that everything that wasn't on that menu has an even higher calorie count than those dishes!  I ended up going with the shrimp and asparagus penne pasta.  I actually chose it before I realized it was on the low calorie menu.  I'm sure the garlic knot that was part of the dish isn't in the calorie count, but it is delicious!  The penne pasta was cooked perfectly al dente.  I really enjoyed this dish. One thing I don't like about the restaurant is it is cold.  Also, we would only see our server at random times.  It took us forever to get our bill. Overall, I think this is a nice restaurant, but since it is somewhat far it probably won't make it into our rotation of favorite places.  We went because they were donating a portion of the bill to our local pancreatic cancer society.  I think that is an awesome concept."
Bill J.,"Tampa, FL",2,25,5,4.0,6/12/2017,"This was our first time visiting BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse.  Excellent food and menu selection.  Server seemed distracted and was a little slow, but the food quality made up for that.  Loved the hand-crafted sodas and desserts.  We will definitely be back."
Jackie D.,"Skokie, IL",11,4,,1.0,5/16/2017,"I usually don't write reviews, but this really irked me.  I ordered for take out and selected 6:30pm as my pick up time. I came in at 6:45 and when I said I was there to pick up my food, the hostess asked me to stand off to the side and wait (in a very awkward place between where people were coming and going) while they ""paged the girl in back"". I stood there awkwardly for 15 min while people passed by. There was a waiting bench on the other side so I wasn't sure why they asked me to stand where they did. Finally, the hostess told me that the cashier was ready for me, and pointed me directly next to the hostess area. The cashier proceeded to tell me that her pager wasn't working properly and then pulled my food out from the warmers directly behind her and the register. My food had been ready that entire time I was standing there waiting, so I'm really not sure why one of the other hostesses couldn't pull the food out and ring me up. Was hoping that the food would make up for the poor service, but sadly, my food was soggy and subpar. Really disappointing. Maybe things would've been better if I dined in."
Noah E.,"Clearwater, FL",0,2,,5.0,10/1/2017,I had my birthday dinner here recently and the waitress completely catered to our needs (party of 8) and the food was on time and delicious. I would definitely reccomend it here and come here soon
Kimberly D.,"Pompano Beach, FL",521,357,1174,3.0,3/11/2015,"I was underwhelmed by the food at BJ's Brewhouse. Friends and I ate there on Sunday night, and it was not very busy. Service was great and attentive. They have televisions that show sports games, but they are only visible by the bar area and tables around there, and they are very high up on the wall, so it was difficult to see. Order the orange cream soda, it's the best beverage at BJ's (that's not alcoholic). Their special brews are also tasty, I enjoy their blonde ale. The table shared the BJ's Favorite pizza, which is a deep-dish with all of the toppings on it. I asked for the crust to be cooked a little longer because I like it crispy. I enjoyed the pizza the best out of the whole meal. We also shared the tuna tartare, which was okay. I enjoyed it, but it wasn't anything I wanted to order if I was on my own. I also ordered the mahi-mahi tacos for myself. You can choose how the fish is cooked, and the server said I could get one blackened and one grilled. So since I like variety, I followed his advice. Neither way made the tacos taste any less bland. It is served with a mildly spicy salsa and some green creamy sauce that was hopelessly bland. They also gave me two dried limes to squeeze juice on my equally dry tacos.  My boyfriend ordered the shrimp Alfredo. It came with plenty of pasta and shrimp, but barely any sauce. He did not finish his meal and didn't even want it to go. The pizookie (pizza cookie) desserts are yummy, and I suggest ordering it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  It wasn't my first time at BJ's but I really hesitate to return to the restaurant, or any other franchise locations."
Robert S.,"Bridgewater, NJ",0,3,,2.0,4/27/2017,"Unfortunately our first impression was established when the host led us to a poorly cleaned table top.  On our request, we were brought to a second table which had many drops of unknown liquid on one of the booth seats. When we asked to have this wiped down, host returned with a cloth and did a half-hearted swipe.  I took the rag from her and wiped it properly and sat down. Both seats in booth were torn.  One cloth napkin had a hole in it and should have been decommissioned without a second thought.  Cutlery was spotty at best - one piece was filthy and needed replacing. Another fork was bent but useable. These things above should never happen in a well-run restaurant. And they generally predict for a place run with insufficient attention to detail. Waiter was very kind, considerate and helpful. Beer was surprisingly good. We were given small tastes of the Piranha and the Hopstorm. Pirhanha was better to us, so we ordered pints. Good head on pints, delicious beer, perfectly cold, good lacing. Really refreshing. Food (california club sandwich and kid's grilled cheese) was grilled sandwiches, which had a distinct rancid oil flavor.  Kid's grilled cheese was really bad -- not sure if it was the grilling butter or the cheese, but really unappetizing. Club had less rancidity, but still a very unappealing twinge. Waiter informed management, who came and comp'ed the kid's meal, but didn't give the impression that he believed or cared that there might be a problem -- but he made it ""right"" for us so he cared about us even if he didn't show much concern for the business. We won't go back in the near future. The place is popular for lunch."
John L.,"Tampa, FL",9,52,206,4.0,6/30/2016,Went to countryside Mall yesterday and decided to stop in at BJ's for a quick bite. I've been to the Citrus Park location many times and it's always a good meal and good atmosphere.  Well needless to say this location held tried and true to my Citrus Park experiences. I had a simple turkey club with an ice tea no alcohol this time ... Food came out delicious and fresh as expected. I would definitely say BJ's is worth trying if you've never been and they brew all their own beer and it's definitely worth a try.  Cheers!!
Rachel T.,"Safety Harbor, FL",2,16,29,3.0,4/10/2017,"I eat here quite often with friends and family, and the food (especially the pizookies) is usually good quality. Last time I ate here I had the California Chicken Club and the flavor was very good, and the fries were excellent too. The problem I tend to have with this BJ's is the slow service. My friends and family I eat here with notice it as well. The last time I ate here it was not busy at all, however our waiter was incredibly slow and the employees seemed to be talking to each other and goofing around. It took forever to get our meals and there did not seem to be any reason for it. I think the management really needs to teach the employees that chatting with each other and ignoring customers comes across as rude and lazy. I don't mind a laid back atmosphere, but employees should still maintain a level of professionalism."
Sonia G.,"Brewster, NY",1,12,4,5.0,11/26/2016,"Great food, ambiance, and service! Came here while on vacation from NY. Came to see the FSU-UF game (go Noles)! Chrissy was our server. She was quick, accommodating, attentive, and very friendly. She did a great job! I had lettuce wraps, avocado egg rolls, and mahi mahi tacos, everything tasted fresh and delicious! Loved everything! Will definitely return next time I visit mom."
Lina R.,"Clearwater, Tampa Bay, FL",12,50,454,5.0,11/11/2014,I've been here many times for my friends bdays and neither food or service disappointed.  Always great   Both thumbs up.
Pam W.,"North Attleborough, MA",2,4,,5.0,2/6/2017,"Service was fantastic, and everyone was nice and friendly. Spinach and artichoke dip and the chips it came with were delectable! There were so many yummy-sounding things to choose fun, and I had the Derby Style Chicken Cobb salad, which was both scrumptious and filling. My friend had a Crispy Jalapeno burger, which simply melted in her mouth, and had just enough kick to satisfy.  On top of all that, we just had to try the pizookies, and they did not disappoint. Add to that the fact that BJs Brewhouse donates a portion of all sales to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation."
TJ T.,"Tampa, FL",203,261,2234,4.0,11/6/2015,"Best happy hour around! My all time favorite dish at BJ's is their wings. So crispy and tasty! I like that it's served naked with Buffalo and Ranch sauces drizzled on them. My bf likes healthier things so one of his faves at BJ's is the Shrimp Lettuce Wraps. They're fresh tasting and always good. Once in a while we'd get the Calamari. We like that the calamari is always crunchy and thick. Other dishes we've eaten here: Chicken Lettuce Wraps, Mini Pizza, Seared Ahi Salad, Jambalaya, Atlantic Salmon and a few others. They all were good; we haven't ran across any dish that we wouldn't order again. Oh, and don't forget about their desserts. Our favorite is the Baked Beignet. We always have to refrain ourselves from getting it each time we're there, otherwise we'd be double our size! Aside from the food, BJ's also has good beers and mixed drinks. You can't go wrong ordering any of the beers they brew."
