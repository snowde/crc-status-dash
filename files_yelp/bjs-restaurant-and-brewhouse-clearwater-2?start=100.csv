Heather S.,"Palm Harbor, FL",29,8,12,4.0,1/8/2014,"Great atmosphere, good food and large bar menu. Husband and I both ordered off of the lunch menu and found the portions to be very satisfying.  Waitress was attentive and friendly, bathrooms were clean, food arrived quickly.  Can't ask for much better from a chain restaurant."
Sue S.,"Pinellas Park, FL",4,5,,4.0,6/11/2015,"I recently moved back to Pinellas Park and stopped there with my husband and 5 grandsons.   I ordered the deep dish pizza and the wedge salad.  They were both amazing.  The pizza melted in my mouth.  The wedge salad had the perfect blend of dressing. My husband had the clam chowder in a bread bowl and was very pleased.   I can't wait to go back to try other selections.    The only down side was that it took longer than usual to get our entrees.   When you have a 4, 8 & 10 year old its eternity.   Lol.   It was well worth the wait."
Ethen J.,"Clearwater, FL",0,42,7,5.0,8/2/2015,Really good restaurant to sit in with the friends and family get pretty Brizee so sometimes you might want to set a reservation. If your party is more than 6
Tara F.,"Palm Harbor, FL",23,36,30,4.0,4/15/2014,"This was our 2nd visit to BJ's Brewhouse. We attended for a special family gathering and had a good meal. There were 9 of us so with a large group, you expect a wait. Our server was very nice, and patient with my 3 children. The food was brought out in a decent amount of time and there were no complaints from anyone, which is amazing in itself. My children were a tad bit annoyed that it took more than 10 minutes for their dessert to arrive, but all in all, it was a good experience. I did have a small problem with no one explaining the Premiere Rewards to us. We were not advised of it our 1st time either.  We would go there again because the quality was good and the atmosphere just right for our family."
Jen Z.,"Dunedin, FL",0,3,,5.0,4/12/2016,"My husband, daughter, and I stopped in on a Saturday afternoon for lunch before hitting the mall for some shopping. Casey was our server and he was great. I'm in the hospitality business and he's been the best server we've had wait on us in a long time!! Very friendly, refilled our water/soda without us having to ask, food came out great.  Great server. Just wanted to mention how well he did. I will definitely return to BJ's and try to get him for our table again. * I also left my phone behind in the booth and when my hubby went to hopefully retrieve it- thankfully it was found and already safely stored in their lost and found. Very grateful."
Candy C.,"Safety Harbor, FL",1,2,,5.0,4/8/2016,"Ordered dinner online and it was ready right when we arrived. Our server was friendly, efficient, and again, the experience was great at BJ's."
Kim S.,"Tampa Bay, FL",14,6,,4.0,9/5/2013,"CJ is an entertaining, hardworking bartender and she made my lunch experience fun! I sat at the bar and chatted with her, while I caught up on college football scores on the huge flat screen above the bar. I ordered the BBQ lunch special, which I hear will not be available much longer, ? :( ?, and enjoyed one of BJ's craft beers.   The special consists of a juicy, bbq chicken breast, a bbq slider, spicy shoe string fries and a small, and I do mean SMALL, side of slaw.  I was impressed at the amount of food for $5.99, however, I was even More impressed with this miniscule portion of slaw lol!  Good heavens, BJ's!  Cabbage is still relatively cheap, and really, that's the only ingredient I saw!  I am not exaggerating, it was hardly enough for a forkful... The fries were a bit limp, but still tasty.  As I am pursuing a more healthy approach to mealtime, I didn't need the fires anyway, but that is purely beside the point lol. The beer was excellent and I recommend them all!  My all time fav and go-to beer is Stella, and BJ's has a Stella ""partner"" in their homebrew line up.  Top notch! My last trip, to the Pinellas Park location, was equally delightful.  The Shrimp Tacos are luscious, the sauce is finger lickin good!  My dining companion had the Stir fry and rice bowl and she raved about it, too.   BJ's rocks!"
Johnny C.,"St Petersburg, FL",439,270,127,3.0,12/29/2013,"There's something about BJ's that feels a little too corporate for my liking. It's almost a Chili's feel with some decent beers. My bitchiness aside - very clean and the menu had several items I chose to try. Not in a rush to go back but would easily choose it over it's immediate neighbors and there are several all very close. So if you would like something other than a Bud and a Burger well worth a visit, that was just too catty, it's better than that"
Gavin M.,"Tampa, FL",5,59,29,3.0,1/20/2014,"I very much enjoyed the beers.  They have some nice house brands.  My steak was overcooked, and I did not care for there seasoning.  Service was not bad, not great.."
Marielle T.,"Clearwater, FL",8,6,,5.0,7/5/2015,"I love BJs, the food is excellent,  and the staff is great. And what about that cookie piezooke ( not sure if I spelled it right ), it's definitely from heaven!"
Jay B.,"Seminole, FL",0,5,1,2.0,5/12/2015,"Forgot the candied pecans and goat cheese on my salad. The two most expensive ingredients. Coincidence? I think not. Oh, and the roof started leaking causing two families to change tables and need new food."
Danan C.,"Clearwater, FL",123,301,83,4.0,1/9/2013,"While this location isn't quite as cool as the ones in Southern California, it's very nice, plays good music that isn't too loud. The teriyaki chicken is AMAZING. All the veggies were super fresh and the chicken was cooked really well. I recommend getting extra rice or requesting light sauce as its a bit too much on the sweetness."
Marty F.,"Clearwater, FL",15,82,164,1.0,12/2/2013,"Service was very poor, we were over 2 hours between being seated and getting a check. The food was good, but not worth the wait."
Shelby G.,"Dunedin, FL",71,99,22,5.0,12/2/2013,"I have been here countless times, and never been disappointed.  To start with, they have awesome Happy Hour deals that are repeated later from 10 pm-midnight. 1/2 priced apps, flatbreads with great prices on their beers on tap.  I am a sucker for the $3 Caprese small bites dish and pretty much always get the Thai-Shrimp Lettuce Wraps. Top it off with one, or two, glasses of house wine and I am a happy camper for less than $20 (before tip, of course). Other 'Not to miss' items are their salads, which are massive, and their burgers.  My only gripe: Their flatbreads could  use a little lovin'. They are not consistently awesome."
Shawn J.,"Brooksville, FL",36,225,418,3.0,12/17/2012,"The craft beers are awesome, very good selection. Found out that I do NOT like Tanqueray, that will teach me not to order a new drink because of the pretty emerald green bottle. We will have to try some food here sometime. The bartenders were very nice. The place was clean and comfortable."
Forever B.,"Clearwater, FL",0,9,3,1.0,9/27/2012,"I've been here a few times within the past couple of months and every visit has been a disaster.  The wait staff is highly inexperienced.  The lack of training is evident.  The managers spend their entire time going around to the tables and comping meals because of everyone complaining of the service.  My last visit was almost unbelievable.  I thought I was on Candid Camera.  The waiter sat us at a table and we sat there for 15 minutes before anyone came over to even take a drink order.  Then waitied another 10 minutes to get the drinks.  The table next to us was filled with half eaten food and empty glasses when we sat down.  An hour and a half later, when we paid the bill, it had not been cleared.  And...to top off the visit, we were seated next to a couple with a very large, hairy dog.  While I don't have any issue with service dogs being in restaurants this one was not marked (clearly anyway) and was being fed from the table (see my pic if you dont believe me). I hear that the service at this establishment is not indicative of the other restaurants in the area, which is a complete shame.  The food is very good.....the service is plain ridiculous!"
Jade S.,"Clearwater, FL",71,65,143,4.0,1/2/2013,"New restaurant in Countryside mall. It seems they are fixing the mall up to be like International mall, which is ok by me!  Now BJs is alright. We went mid day on New Years Day. The staff were friendly and the atmosphere was nice. It's a new restaurant at Countryside, but it's a chain. I've never been to one before this time.  The menus have a HUGE selection of alcohol, appetizers & pizza. I guess that's their main thing. We ate off the lunch menu which is decently priced, otherwise you are looking at spending $9-15 per person.  I had the chicken quesadillas (ok but not great, I'd give it a 3 for taste and a 2 for size and presentation), but my husband had chicken teriyaki. Amazing! His was very yummy and I wish I had ordered that.  Overall it's a good place to try!"
Haylee F.,"Clearwater, FL",0,25,,4.0,3/4/2015,"This place is really good for Drinks and appetizers. The Entrées aren't very enjoyable. The service is average. The environment is nice, I like the booths and how the bar looks."
Suzanne C.,"Port Richey, FL",1,9,2,5.0,7/23/2014,"My new favorite place! I ordered the Cherry Chipotle Glazed Salmon and it was to die for! I've gone back a few times and always get that because it's sooo good! Their rewards program is pretty decent too. The staff is excellent, very very friendly and polite."
Letha B.,"St. Petersburg, FL",0,20,5,3.0,2/21/2015,"Today was my first visit. Not very impressed. I had the spaghetti with chicken. It wasn't pretty to look at, but the spaghetti was delicious! The chicken was just kind of an afterthought. My fiancé had the southern fried chicken which he enjoyed. The mashed potatoes weren't anything to write home about. We waited about 30 min for our table. There were several empty tables and many people waiting to be seated which didn't make sense. The service was terrible! We saw our waiter 3 times. Once to take our order, once to ask about the food and once when I had to get him to get us out check. 3 stars is me being nice."
