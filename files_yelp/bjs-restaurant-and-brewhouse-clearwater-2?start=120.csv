C E.,"Tampa, FL",0,5,2,1.0,1/18/2016,"We came in for happy hour and ordered the siracha dry rubbed wings, lettuce wraps, potato skins and flatbread pizza. The wings had no kick and were fatty. The pizza was okay. The lettuce wraps were easily the worst I've ever had.  The server took our order, dropped off our food and didn't come back to check on us once. Nonexistent customer service.  Save your time and money and go anywhere else."
Diane H.,"St Petersburg, FL",45,378,214,5.0,6/30/2012,I have only eaten here twice but I loved it both times.   At lunch they offer soup and half a sandwich which is great when you can't eat much.  Their soups are fantastic and I could have a giant bowl as my main meal.  The chili was so filling also.  The dessert blew me away!    Also many tv's by bar if you wanna catch up on your sports.
Sherry B.,"Baltimore, MD",0,194,101,2.0,7/30/2013,"My pizza was not good.  They do a deep dish Chicago style pizza and a thin crust.  I narrowed it down that I just don't like the sauce. And unfortunately the sauce is kinda key.  If I were to go again, I would definitely not get pizza or I'd suggest Grimaldi's for pizza.  They are much better. The wings (appetizer) were very good. They were nice and crispy and the wing sauce was good, too.  So I would recommend their wings, but I'm not going here for wings per se when I could go anywhere basically.  The ribs were just ok.  In my opinion, they were too dry, overcooked.  My husband felt they had too much pepper and he didn't care for the ribs at all. A positive side to some people is that it's really noisy if you want to take your loud kids out to eat.  This restaurant is definitely kid-friendly."
Mike M.,"Safety Harbor, FL",18,122,,4.0,3/27/2014,"Great name, good food, good service. Went for lunch with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. The menu is huge, the prices are good and the chicken tenders were really good. Kind of loud inside but not a deal breaker. I need to start eating at the mall more often."
H N.,"Dunedin, FL",0,28,19,4.0,9/5/2014,Ordered the wings and calamari. Wings were buffalo style. Not too spicy or hot. Great for a group of people who just want good wings. Calamari was good too but they were the tentacle kind. Great beer selection with taps from a bunch of the local breweries. Bartender didn't inform us it was Happy Hour though. We got the discount but would have ordered more if we were told . Overall it was a good time at a chained restaurant
Richard N.,"Palm Harbor, FL",36,141,27,3.0,6/29/2012,"I've eaten at BJ's a few times, and each time I go I inexplicably find myself liking this place, even though the food is very average. I've tried the pizza, salads, fish tacos, the loaded baked potato, and several of the appetizers, and they aren't bad, but the food doesn't wow me either. I give it 3 stars because the food really drives my ratings, with everything else adding a little bit to the experience. The only exception is the avocado egg rolls appetizer. These things are ridiculously good, with a tamarind dipping sauce. It's worth going here just for this! I could order this and have a couple beers and be very happy. Their beer selection is excellent with many imports, craft beers, and the regular domestics. Their own beer is very good and I have tried the Stout, the Red Ale, the Pale Ale, and the Porter, and I've liked all of them. It's a chain with a warehouse feel to it, and it's generally very crowded in the evenings and you have to wait. It's nicely decorated, clean and slightly upscale, and I have enjoyed my visits. I just wish the food was a little better. Food: 3 stars Atmosphere: 4 stars Beer: 5 stars Service: 4 stars"
John L.,"Safety Harbor, FL",27,93,55,5.0,5/31/2014,"I absolutely love this place for its food and beer. Maybe I just love it because of the beer? Come to think of it. I'm not sure what the food actually tastes like. I usually get a pitcher of beer or 2 with my wife and we enjoy it so much that we always say ""Why did we even get food"". The beer selections is so good that before you know it you going to have to go watch a movie otherwise you going to do something silly like try to ice skate drunk. I just prefer the beer and a movie that way the world is not spinning too much and I don't get hurt."
SpeedOfLife A.,"Melbourne, FL",2,55,3,5.0,7/12/2014,"Awesome food, great service. So glad we detoured to stop here for dinner. Vast menu and lots of alcohol options."
Don B.,"North Redington Beach, FL",0,14,,4.0,7/27/2015,We went to BJ's on Saturday evening for dinner.  We had about a 15 minute wait which wasn't bad considering the time.  We had nachos for an appetizer and they were delicious.  I had a meat pizza and was very happy with my choice.  My wife had steak and thought it was very tender and prepared just right.  Another couple with us tried some pasta dishes and seemed to enjoy them.  This is about our 4th time eating here and we would highly recommend them.
Sarah H.,"New Port Richey, FL",17,5,,1.0,12/30/2013,"Two words: raw chicken. The staff was quick to rectify the mistake, but this is a very dangerous and inexcusable mistake. I will not be returning."
Will C.,"St. Petersburg, FL",12,101,11,2.0,9/21/2013,"My wife and I decided to give this restaurant another shot last night for dinner. We decided to sit in a booth which meant a 5 minute wait. Once we were seated it took our waiter about 10 minutes to acknowledge us and let us know that it would be a couple more minutes before he could get our order. At this point my wife and I chose our meals and when the waiter came over ( about 5 minutes later) we asked for 2 samples of the Oktoberfest beer that BJ's makes. He said he would be right back with the samples after putting our order in. 10 minutes later west I'll had nothing on our table. No beer. No water. Nothing, so we decided to leave. Before leaving we told the manager why were leaving and he offered to comp the entire meal and wait on us personally. Neither of us wanted that especially after our previous poor experience. I have to say I most likely will not be back again."
Ed M.,"Safety Harbor, FL",0,10,1,2.0,4/21/2015,Quick to be seated and greeted. Drinks were  quick to come. Order appetizer and also came quickly but had no napkin or utensils.  Food came but not as ordered. Overall staff nice but and Resturant OK but probably will not be back.
Lisa P.,"Clearwater, FL",0,21,,4.0,6/18/2015,"I've visited many times since my first review and to be fair, service is much, much better all around.  The noise level is still high, but the food is good and reasonably priced.  There are low calorie selections and healthy selections.  The menu is large and ever evolving.  It's a thumbs up!"
Sarah C.,"Palm Harbor, FL",17,94,14,4.0,4/2/2014,"Love this place! Clean, good soup. I love going here, just wish it wasnt at the mall, parkings HELL."
Rebecca R.,"Tempe, AZ",31,107,5,4.0,1/1/2014,"I love BJs. I took a friend here for dinner when I was in town. I ordered the ahi tuna salad. Warning - avoid the wasabi on the edge of the plate. I don't know what happened but it seemed stronger than I was used too. Or maybe there was also wasabi in the dressing and I got a double hit. Other than that the tuna was done perfectly and I really enjoyed the salad. Our waitress Karen was very professional, knew the menu, and was attentive without hovering."
David W.,"Willimantic, CT",126,2,12,4.0,2/5/2014,"Really enjoyed the beers and the diverse menu. I will seek out their other locations for great food, service, especially beer."
Candice M.,"Fairfax, VA",291,141,209,3.0,11/9/2013,"BJs is cool when youre tired of Applebee's and Chili's. Nothing on the menu wows me, but their famous piezookie always hits the spot when I have a sweet tooth. They have pretty good late night specials during the week. I also like that they have a pretty decent light menu for those watching their calorie intake. Family friendly atmosphere, good place to watch sports and grab a drink too. Service as always been good as well."
Jeff W.,"Clearwater, FL",0,11,1,4.0,5/8/2014,"Good place for a lunch stop.  The menu is big but the portions not so much.  Not small, but not large either.  Maybe because we ordered off the lunch menu.  The Southern Fried Chicken was good but you have to try the ""Pizookie"" dessert....awesome! Hi"
Marc P.,"Dunedin, FL",29,46,,4.0,3/14/2013,"we only had appetizers and beer.  The beer selection is very good, the appetizers were creative and good.  The atmosphere was great for conversation.  we will definitely go back for more."
Lori S.,"Holiday, FL",0,8,,2.0,5/3/2015,"This isn't the 1st time here, and have always had pleasant experiences but last night we were celebrating with a large group, 20. They seriously understaffed our group. 2 servers who also had 4 other tables each. So the service to our table was terrible since they were too busy taking care of the others. 1/2 the table got water, took almost 20 mins to bring drinks, the person next to me asked to order some apps after she finished delivery of the drinks and he got attitude. Everyone else was served their drinks but me, I said something to the other waitress but then my drink showed up, almost 10 mins after everyone else and I got a snot attitude from the 2nd server I asked. Over an hour before they even took our dinner orders, rather than sitting and enjoying each other's company everyone was focused on how hungry they were. The kitchen needs to learn to expedite better because food came out 2 plates at a time and took well over 10 mins to serve and was auctioned off by very quiet food runners. Food was ok, my mojito wasn't proper tho.  Not a bad place for small groups I guess but go somewhere that has their sh!t together for big groups."
