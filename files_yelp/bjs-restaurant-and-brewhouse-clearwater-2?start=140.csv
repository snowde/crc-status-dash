C L.,"Clearwater, FL",8,54,36,4.0,12/17/2012,"For some reason, I thought I wasn't going to like this place, maybe thinking it was just a sports bar, but I'm giving BJ's a 4 star rating with limited exposure at this point.   When we looked at the menu, I was excited to see that they had ""snacks & small bites"" in one section of the menu.  I enjoy tapas like food because you can try more things and not get too full. So, we've eaten there twice, and I think we got the same thing both times.  I got a ""Fresh Mozzarella and Tomato Salad"" snack or small bite, and the ""Angus Pot Roast Sandwich"".  The mozzarella and tomato salad was good, they use the small balls instead of slices, but everything seemed fresh and the size was perfect for one person. The angus pot roast sandwich rated ""delicious; should I have another""?  It's downsized from what you might expect, but the price is less as well.  Like I said, the small plates are nice.  Tender Angus beef pot roast slices are served on a toasted garlic cheese French roll and topped with white cheddar mashed potatoes and mushroom brown gravy. Served with oven roasted vegetables.  (I stole that off of the website).  Very, very good! We also split (on the second visit) the ""crispy fried artichoke hearts"" and they were fried perfectly.  Parmesan cheese was sprinkled over them and a garlic aioli accompanied them in a small bowl.  Not a fan of mayo products, I ate them without, and enjoyed them much. I don't know if you're a soda drinker, but I am particularly if it's something special.  Well, this place makes they own soda, and I guess they make 3 or 4 kinds everyday.  I tried an ice cold glass of their black cherry soda (OK, so I had 2), and that was spectacular!  Then they ran out, so I had a glass of their orange cream soda, which was really good too. So, we look forward to returning and trying something new (after I have that pot roast sandwich 1 more time)!  Did I mention that was a very good sandwich?"
Allison H.,"Mechanicsburg, PA",135,329,670,3.0,10/9/2014,"BJ's food selection and variety can appease a group that just can't decide what and where to eat. Some of their appetizers are reasonably sized to pass off as an entree (flat breads, wings, calamari, or anything priced 7 and up) They have an excellent beer and wine selection. All portions are very generous with food, beer and wine. I am not a fan  of their cocktails. I do feel they are too weak and they are over priced. Cocktails are served in small portions and though VERY tasty, the booze content lacks big time (even for a lightweight) Their servers are hit or miss. During my last check in, I had careless server who forgot to put in an order for our appetizer and visited our table 3 times before bringing our beverages on the 4th. I have had good service other times and of course their meals are well prepared. The environment is great for a game night dinner. They have happy hour on Thursdays for football. I particularly like this place for a dinner and a movie. The theater is right there and it works out well. Overall, I enjoy their food, and there's usually enough left overs for lunch the next day."
Lauren C.,"Dunedin, FL",124,740,216,3.0,11/29/2012,"I've been for dinner a few times. I like to start off with the brew sampler where you get to choose from a selection of 4 mini beers from the tap. They do have a great selection of different beer, but that's what I would expect from a ""brewhouse"". As far as food options, I've tried the chicken caesar salad. The dressing was excellent, but the portions were very heavy on the lettuce and very skimpy on the chicken. Meh. Also I have tried the gourmet mac and cheese as an app which was decent, but the hair that I found in the bottom of the bowl was most certainly an unwanted ingredient (this was my last visit there). On the other hand, the pizza is probably the best thing I've had here. Excellent flavor, soft thick crust and overall cheesy goodness make it worth another try. I am in the middle about this restaurant, hence why I gave it 3 stars, it's something everyone should check out, but I'm not head over heels crazy for it"
Karol M.,"Tarpon Springs, FL",61,14,26,3.0,9/11/2013,Its ok.  The service was pretty slow.  Food was good. Only 2nd time I have been here at the one in Clearwater.  I think its a bit pricey for lunch on the weekends.
Vicki L.,"Clearwater, FL",0,6,,5.0,2/18/2014,"Excellent! Salmon was delicious as was the angel hair and shrimp pasta. Had never been before, but I will most definitely return for good and great service."
Ken S.,"Tampa, FL",0,41,,1.0,2/18/2015,Service here is horrible.   We went for lunch this Saturday.  The orders came out completely wrong and then came out in different order. So none of us ate together we all ate separately at the same table. The waiter apologized on behalf of the manager but the manager never had the courtesy to come by the table to offer his apology. This is not the first time that this happened at this location - other BJ seem to be fine I think it's just this one.
D G.,"Port Richey, FL",4,15,1,2.0,11/9/2013,The menu is huge! Lots of different items to choose from. Too bad everytime i go the service is horrible!!! Please fix that. Seeing how I've worked in the restaurant business for over 10 years getting bad service ruins places for me.
Jason R.,"Clearwater, FL",1,24,,3.0,6/16/2013,"The name kind of says it all. Another corporate kitchen that is not great but not terrible. That is about the best I could muster about this place ""not terrible"".  How do these kind of places expand all over the country? I thought the massive contraction of Bennigans had signified we turned a corner as an eating people... guess not."
Kristopher L.,"Tampa, FL",0,8,,5.0,1/7/2014,"This is as good as it gets without going to a high end place. I have tried about half of their menu with a new item each time and I am amazed each time around. The avocado rolls are awesome and the chicken lettuce wraps are a perfect follow up.  Aside from the food, the atmosphere and their house brews are worth coming back for. It is a bit noisy when they are packed, but that comes with the atmosphere. Probably not the place for a quiet date, but great for family and friends!"
Katie C.,"Palm Harbor, FL",171,158,108,3.0,6/4/2012,"The new BJ's in the Countryside Mall is a great addition to the area. If you're looking for American fare (burgers, deep dish pizza, salads, sandwiches), there is a vast selection on the menu...it might take you a while to make a selection. The restaurant is also decked out with many TVs throughout, so it's a good place to catch a game or two. The food quality has always been good in my experience! if you're looking for a casual night out, this could be the spot!"
Sharon E.,"Dunedin, FL",0,13,,2.0,5/29/2013,"Met a friend for dinner here on Tuesday, May 28th. Let me just say that while I appreciate the Brewhouse atmosphere, the food & service just didn't deliver. We ordered the Stuffed Mushroom App & the stuffing was minimal, if nonexistent. The service was strong at the beginning, but tapered off quickly. The menu is monstrous, which explains why food delivery is slow, even for the salads we ordered. I'm doubting any return visits anytime soon.."
Sharon B.,"Clearwater, FL",2,21,,2.0,7/22/2012,"The food is decent, chain style fare. Great selection of beer and cocktails. Terrible, terrible service both times we visited. Needs some work or this place will go the way of Bennigan's in short time."
Rebecca T.,"Palm Harbor, FL",0,9,11,1.0,8/10/2015,had eaten here a few times and the food was good so I decided to take some food home for the family I placed an order through the app and schedule it for pickup at 6:30 I arrived at 6:30 and waited and waited and waited 25 minutes later I called inside to the restaurant since I have the kids with me and can't leave the little ones on the car the answer the phone and told me that my food will be right out so about five minutes later my food came out which makes me wonder if my food has really been sitting at the whole time and it just never brought it out so I get almost all the way home and the kids want something to eat so I reached in to get them some chips and there's only two containers in the bag we're missing an entire entree so I called the restaurant and they said oh well you can just come back and get one but I have you know three quarters of my dinner right around in the car with me getting cold you know I'm coming back for it you need to remake the whole order which they did they told me to be about another 20 minutes so once again I waited another 20 minutes they brought my food out you know I'm said thank you so you know I took the food and drove away didn't bother to look in the bag figuring they would never mess my order up bad idea this time I forgot our soups and salads all of the food wasn't bad not worth going to that much of a hassle
Gary R.,"Palm Harbor, FL",0,17,35,2.0,10/1/2012,"Nice decor... Food was OK, except they over-cooked my burger twice. Service was a bit slow, both times I've been there."
John S.,"Vancouver, WA",5,120,,1.0,7/18/2014,"i had a slice of cheese and a slice of pepperoni pan pizza at the dunedin blue jays game. both literally tasted like vomit. it was the worst pizza i have ever had and i had one once that was bright orange. i don't know if the pizza rotted in the heat or something but the other places did not taste like that. surprisingly, i did not get sick."
Jennifer C.,"Frisco, TX",24,4,,3.0,8/6/2012,Food is great but service is super slow. Had to hunt down our waitress a few times for refills on our drinks. Not very attentive at all.
Albert F.,"Clearwater, FL",0,7,,2.0,9/8/2012,We have eaten three times at the Countryside BJs. The third time will most likely be the last. The service was fine and no problem with their microbrews but the ribeye steak we were served was without a doubt the worst that I have ever been served. Shamefully bad.
Jeri G.,"Tampa, FL",2,26,,2.0,9/11/2014,"Do not eat at the Clearwater location if you are expecting efficient service. The servers are mediocre and the management doesn't seem to reinforce customer service as most other reviews echo my complaints. Last weekend we arrived at 6:30pm and had used their App's Call Ahead service. The hostess couldn't find it in their system and didn't have a table ready so we waited nonetheless with the rest of the masses. Upon being seated our server loudly and obnoxiously announced his prepared speech of how he's so amazing and we're going to have a fun night. Needless to say it didn't live up to his promise. We ordered drinks and an appetizer. One of the drinks he brought was wrong and the appetizer never arrived. An HOUR later our food was brought out by an entourage of bus boys along with the missing appetizer. We were so beyond hungry and aggravated that it was even brought out at that point. The server came up and couldn't understand why we wouldn't want our nachos along with our meals that we waited 60 minutes for. He said he'd talk to his manager about taking it off the bill as if it was even a real question. He never asked if we wanted dessert, just dropped off the bill and wiped his hands clean of us."
Deb G.,"Clearwater, FL",12,3,,4.0,10/1/2012,"I've been here 3 times since they opened recently, and 2 out of 3 were really good...in fact I had the best chargrilled salmon I've ever had .  I also got the watermelon and feta salad and liked it so much I've made it for guests twice this summer...I also liked the blonde beer battered fish, but the last time wasn't as good as the first...I hope their consistancy improves...."
c k.,"Pensacola, FL",1,5,,3.0,5/8/2014,"my aunt and i went there tonite.  we weren't extremely hungry but were looking for somewhere you can have great appetizers and beer.  it's a brewery, so if you're looking for bud lite or miller lite you need to pick something else- they do have bud lite but in a bottle.  i didn't even ask if they had miller lite in a bottle.  the menu is HUGE, so there's an appetizer section and a small bites section, which is a good thing.  my aunt ordered the chicken lettuce wraps... it comes out on a plate, a bunch of single iceberg lettuce leaves and a small bowl of cooked, really tiny diced chicken and random veggies with some sort of oily soy dip and a spicy asian mustard dip.  the dips were good, the chicken and soy dip were good, but huge, cold iceberg leaves?  it would've been better if they used grilled romaine lettuce leaves or other sort of lettuce leaf.  i ordered the fried calamari with a creamy, garlic aoli dip and marina dip.  the calamari was a little over-fried so you didn't taste the calamari at all.  it was just greasy tasting, almost like it was fried in old oil.  i tasted the marinara sauce- it was ok, if you like dipping your calamari into tomato sauce, which i don't, no matter how good it is.  i just don't like seafood/tomato sauce combo for anything so that's just a personal preference of mine.  the lemon garlic creamy aoli sauce was good and i dipped the mess out of the calamari into it just to get rid of the greasy oil taste.  our waitress was great, attentive, nothing was her fault.  she saw my aunt didn't care for her food and took her food off our bill and offered to get her something else.  we told her about the oily/greasy fried calamari and she had offered to take that off the bill as well but we paid for it anyways.  that, plus 4 glasses of beer, cost about $30.  the place is nice, good atmosphere and our waitress was nice and accommodating but we weren't too happy with our food all in all.  it was our first time there and maybe the rest of the menu that's not fried or diy is ok, but i wouldn't get anything fried there again.  so while it wasn't great, i'd go there again just to order something else and see how it goes, especially since everything is decently priced.  but if we go and have another experience of food that's not so great, that would be the end of that."
