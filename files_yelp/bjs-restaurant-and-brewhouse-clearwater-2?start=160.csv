Jennifer G.,"Clearwater, FL",0,242,93,1.0,10/25/2013,"I LOVE BJ's generally but this location is very poorly managed. The service is horrible. My husband and I went there on a Wed. eve. It wasn't busy at all. We ordered these new avocado egg rolls as an appetizer. It took us 25 minutes to get them. Our food actually came out within a min or 2 after we got the egg rolls. The egg rolls were AWESOME! I do have to give them that. The burger were good but mine was very under cooked. We couldn't tell the server because he was nowhere to be found. There was a special advertised in the paper for a 2 for 20 deal. That wasn't even in the menu or handouts. We didn't ask for it though since we picked items that wouldn't have been on the deal. The food is generally great but this place is giving the whole chain a bad name due to the poor management and horrible service. We have went in many different times and its always the same with this location. If you want a good experience at a BJs restaurant, drive to Pinellas Park. They are usually on a wait but you can call ahead. They are on a wait because this one is worth it. Stay clear of this Clearwater location! If they keep on this route they wont last much longer. Such a shame."
