Trish B.,"Greenfield, IN",0,5,,3.0,7/24/2016,"Food and service was amazing! Had the Mediterranean Tacos and they were SO good!!! Out waitress was lovely and very attentive. On the drink front, stick with the beer! The bartender is not good at making Margarita's. Tried the new watermelon basil and it was so sweet, they had to cut it with lime and soda water to make it palpable, so I figured I would go with a classic  margarita the second time.... No salt on the rim and it had an orange slice in it. Not what one usually calls a ""classic"" margarita!  If it wasn't for the drinks, this would have be 5 stars!!!!"
Deanne M.,"Holiday, FL",51,172,111,2.0,5/20/2016,"Although spacious and quite comfortable, the food is very unoriginal. The Strawberry Lemonade was delicious when our waiter would come around. I ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken and I was given a tough piece of overcooked, rubbery chicken. The Lemon Chardonnay Butter Sauce was very good and I ordered an extra cup of that. It was a highlight of the meal."
K L.,"Clearwater, FL",1,13,,4.0,2/10/2017,The food is really good and a pretty large beer/drink selection. My only gripe is that it is ALWAYS SO COLD! I usually have to wear a sweater and a jacket to be comfortable.
Jeff P.,"Oldsmar, Tampa Bay, FL",0,12,,2.0,6/30/2017,"We enjoy the menu selection. A few of the items are our favorites which makes us want to return- But consistently poor service for an expensive bill. We always order togo, and everytime we end up waiting much longer than our quote time and something is wrong/missing. Frustrated! $30 and we only received 2 items we ordered out of 3 correctly and after waiting a long time. Hard to give a good rating when the consistency is always an issue! Lack of Time management & Double checking orders. I did not check my order since the manager was the one to take and complete the order for us tonight."
Stephanie B.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",89,19,12,4.0,10/29/2016,"My first experience at BJ's was quite mediocre. I got the salmon, and it was nothing special. However, I went during happy hour this time and stuck to the appetizers. The glazed bone-in wings were to die for. The spinach dip was tasty too. I topped my order off with their Hefeweizen. Great experience; it made up for the prior. I'll definitely be going back for some Sunday football  with the hubs. TVs everywhere by the way"
Angela M.,"Sarasota, FL",0,23,5,1.0,6/7/2017,"Ok I just wanted to write another reveiew. The general manager happened to read my last review and was so kind to send me a gift card for the troubles we had. We went back tonight, but decided to go to a differnt, closer restaurant. Here is my full experience since this time I actually got to try the food. We started off with an appetizer of potatoe skins, which I must say are EXCELLENT. My fiance ordered a burger and fries with a side of cole slaw. Mind you that we did have to pay extra for the cole slaw ($3.95). I ordered a rack of ribs with a loaded baked potato and asparagus. ALL of the food was EXCELLENT! I mean it was darn good! But then, we were low on drinks. The server came by and asked if we needed refills, we said yes. A long time went by and we had to stop him and ask if we could get a refill. My fiance tasted the cole slaw and it was spicy, which was weird, so we asked the waiter if thats just their cole slaw, which he informed us they have 2 different types, a spicy one and one that is more of a classic cole slaw. He asked the waiter if we could trade the cole slaw, because we didn't know they had 2 kinds, and the waiter said yes. He came back a couple minutes later and set the new cole slaw down and walked away rather quickly. We looked and it was a quarter of what the first cole slaw serving was When we saw the waiter again he said ""oh they have to make more so i just gave you what was left"" and walked off like that is ok. What he should have done was said ""Hey, I'm sorry guys they didnt have quite enough would you like to wait and i can bring you out a little more"" that would have been perfectly exceptable. Oh! but it gets better folks! We asked for a manger, the manager comes and we told him everything. I don't typically make a big deal of things like this but $3.95 is a bit much for a small bowl of anything and to not get a full bowl kind of well pardon my language, sucks. So the manger kind of blew us off and acted like his server was justified for bringing us a quarter of a serving. My fiance asked if it would be acceptable for bringing someone a half a pizza, which the manager actually said ""well.....i dont think so"" OF COURSE NOT! It is so sad that the food at BJ's is AMAZING and I would LOVE to frequent the restaurant, but with the service the way it is, and at more than one location, I will not be back. What this place needs to do is clean house as far as their servers go, or a training camp. It is almost like they are afraid to come out and tell their guests ""hey we dont have what you want, would you like something else, or like to wait while we make it"" Customer service is not that hard to do, and this place could be a lot better with the proper training and/or the proper manager to train them."
Tyler W.,"Lebanon, TN",42,7,,3.0,12/24/2016,"I only had one complaint about this place, but it was a big complaint. My wife and I went to grab a Chocolate chunk Pizookie and when we ordered the pizookie the waitress looks at my wife and says that's kinda basic. Customer service was poor all around, but the Pizookie and craft beer made this review 3 stars instead of 2"
Jessica D.,"Tampa Bay, FL",58,8,16,4.0,8/8/2015,Ate here for lunch today. I shared the lettuce wraps and portobello mushroom burger with a friend. The lettuce wraps were delicious but for $10.25 I would expect a bit more chicken....it barely filled four of the five lettuce leaves that accompany the dish. The flavor was on point though. The burger had great flavor and the mushroom and pesto added great texture and flavor but towards the end the mushroom seemed a but much...it was thicker than even the beef patty! We finished the meal with a delicious peanut butter s'mores pizookie....delicious! It's so sweet that it's easy to share. Loved the toasted marshmallow on top!
Dianna B.,"Tarpon Springs, FL",847,2344,2388,3.0,2/27/2014,"I wasn't terribly impressed with this location.  The mall is a nice place for BJ's but with all the TV's and all the noise, it's terribly loud and terribly overwhelming.  Their menu, is like all other BJ's, so it's HUGE.  Both the husband and I decided to enjoy an appetizer of Calamari, which was tasty. I ordered the steak - this is not a steak house,  I know to order something different in the future.  The side of green beans was -meh- and the soup was absolutely decadent.  My husband's dinner of the Indian inspired Salmon. There were a lot of curry flavours blended in, and he said it was really tasty.  However it took over 15 minutes after we were done to get our check, and yes, we could check out ""at the table"" with their ap, but this is not my idea of secure, so we waited for our check... I was not happy."
Jason P.,"Clearwater, FL",0,2,3,2.0,1/2/2016,"Tried BJ's for the first time tonight with my family and we won't be returning.  I ordered a ""mini pizza"" for $10.50.  Given that I wasn't ordering from a child's menu, I assumed that the pizza costing more then ten dollars (a Pizza Hut full large pizza costs the same amount) would be enough for a meal.  I was incorrect.  The pizza literally was the size of my hand.  It looked like one slice of normal human sized pizza cut into four pieces.  It took me all of one minute to finish my ""meal'.   The price of this ""pizza"" is an indefensible ripoff.  Brb...gotta go cook dinner for myself now."
Vicki S.,"Clearwater, FL",95,22,4,3.0,2/27/2016,"We both had the Parmesan crusted chicken. I requested asparagus as a substitute & a cup of the tomato bisque. Soup had excellent flavor but was disappointingly tepid in temperature. The roasted asparagus was excellent, the parm crusted chicken average. Wait staff was very attentive & went out of his way to correct any concerns. Will give it another try sometime."
Fatimah T.,"Clearwater Beach, Tampa Bay, FL",271,10,6,4.0,6/6/2016,The only reason I gave a 4 star rating is because I think the prices could be a little lower. The food taste excellent and the portions are fair. Had a party of 15 and we was able to sit comfortably while we ate.
Graham M.,"Clearwater, FL",0,5,,2.0,11/20/2015,"So often a good meal is ruined by poor service, this place is the opposite (well at least for my meal). I ordered what's referred to as a ""house speciality"": the sirloin steak (medium) and a side of grilled asparagus and the grilled brussel sprouts. First the steak: It resembled a wedge of cheese and therefore the requested ""medium"" temperature didn't start to appear until 3/4 of the way through the cut. Ranged from ""well dine"" to ""nearly rare"". Second: The brussel sprouts. The presentation looked more like a pile of charred pebbles. As far as consistency goes ....... Yuch!!! Mushy! Taste wise? Didn't bother even trying them. At least the asparagus almost saved the day (from a hunger point of view). It wasn't perfect, the bottom 1/4 of the spears should have been removed! Movie time!!"
Mike M.,"Clearwater, FL",70,110,114,4.0,8/26/2015,"We stopped in for dinner after a long day and had a fantastic server,  Ronald,  that took great care of us.  We ordered the lettuce wraps and stuffed mushrooms as appetizers.   Both were ok, nothing really outstanding on either dish,  and watch out for the yellow sauce that comes with the wraps it was like pure horseradish!   If they make that in house,  someone should check that recipe,  yikes!  We also added a mozzarella and tomato salad with balsamic reduction to our meal which was fresh and tasty.  For entrees we ordered the jambalaya and one of the thin crust pizzas with ham,  pepperoni,  sausage,  and pepperoncinis.  Both of those were very good, well prepared and very filling.  Without a doubt the standout of the evening was our server Ronald.  He was perfect in his timing of all of our food and he kept our drinks full which was a task in itself.  He was very friendly and respectful and I thought he did a bang up job.   I'd be happy to have him again and I hope he is appreciated by his managers."
Sydney T.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",11,14,46,5.0,7/9/2016,"My boyfriend and I come here all the time and we've always had great service. Last night we got in right before 7, which is when their happy hour ends. He told us if we ordered now he could still squeeze it in, so I impulsively ordered two appetizers so they would be half off and my boyfriend got a beer. Once we looked at the menu we decided on a pizza. When we ordered he informed us they had a special going on for their tavern cut pizzas. For 25 dollars we got a soup or salad for each of us, our pizza, and one of their pizookies, which is a cookie skillet dessert with ice cream. It was a great deal so we got it. We had so much food. Our avocado egg rolls and garlic parmesan boneless wings came first. I get those specific wings every time I go to BJ's because they are that good. We tried to save room and only ate about half of our apps. Then the soup and salads came, I ordered a Caesar salad and he got the tomato bisque. Our pizza came pretty shortly after that and it was so good! We decided on the great white, which is a pizza with veggies and an Alfredo sauce. We tried to stuff our faces but we also had dessert coming. Our waiter recommended the triple chocolate  ghirardelli cookie. It was little too much chocolate for me, but my boyfriend loved it."
Steve M.,"Largo, Tampa Bay, FL",0,8,,1.0,3/13/2017,Absolutely the WORST experience! Ordered a simple cheeseburger plain. Out came a loaded burger w/pulled pork on top. Sent back. Next came a burger w/no cheese. I asked if there was cheese on it and was told yes when it didn't. After showing our waiter that there wasn't any cheese on it - he took it back. After 20 minutes the waiter came back and asked if we wanted our check. I told him I never received my burger. He couldn't believe it. If he was a decent waiter he would have known. He got the manager who was worthless. Didn't even offer to adjust our bill. How unprofessional all the way around! NEVER AGAIN!!
Frank A.,"Palm Harbor, FL",22,204,539,5.0,9/4/2015,Smores pizookie is ridiculous.   It's a chocolate cookie w a layer of peanut butter then marshmallows brûlée w two scoops of vanilla.  I don't like smores and this was insane.  Just get it!
Paul G.,"Cleveland, OH",17,1,,5.0,8/19/2016,Had a solid meal with my wife and 10yr old. However more importantly we had great service from our waiter. His name was Paul and he did not miss a beat doing small extras like getting my wife a different sauce when what came with her app was too spicy. He went over and above and it was appreciated. Brussel sprouts were excellent. Calamari very good. I had the chic tacos and girls had flat bread. All good. My first review on Yelp. Thanks and another thanks to Paul and the very friendly staff.
Kelly L.,"Safety Harbor, Tampa Bay, FL",3,181,241,3.0,6/3/2015,"This is one of our favorite stops before a movie. Pitcher of beer and some appetizers while watching sports on their TV's. If you are in a rush or are watching your time, sit at the bar.  Otherwise, the service is really slow and you won't make it out of their in a reasonable hour.  I wouldn't recommend many items on their menu, as several items to include the flat breads, pizza and pasta all taste pre-made and frozen, as a typical chain restaurant prepares. The beer has always tasted fresh though.  Clean restaurant with a lively atmosphere."
Joseph L.,"Fairfield, CT",53,98,169,5.0,10/19/2015,"My family and I were visiting Tampa, FL from New York, for vacation and tried BJ's.  I had tried BJ's once before in the Arizona, but the quality of food was consistent.  The place is amazing, spacious interior, great service and great food.  We were stuffed but still had to get the dessert :) which we ate it all."
