Joanne C.,"Oldsmar, FL",127,81,41,5.0,4/16/2016,"I've been here a few times and it's been an ok experience. Today we had a wonderful and very attentive server, Natalie. What a great experience! Everything came out super quick, the food was great and we were very happy. She really took great care of our table and had a great personality. I'd definitely come back if I knew I'd have service like this all the time."
Marinda H.,"Safety Harbor, FL",145,476,142,4.0,3/28/2014,"Pleasantly surprised by my trip to BJ's Restaurant. They have an extensive lunch menu with some lower calorie items and reasonably priced. I ordered the 1/2 Margherita Fresca flatbread and side salad. The flatbread was good, not the best Margherita I've ever had but good, and salad was a nice fancy mix with decent dressing. Portion was small and didn't really fill me up but a good light lunch. BF ordered the chicken fingers and fries and was very happy.  Server was very attentive and food delivered quickly. Nice atmosphere, a little loud though - not sure why restaurants do the super high ceilings as they make it much more noisy."
Larry C.,"Monterey, CA",30,21,11,5.0,10/16/2015,"We loved everything about our meal. The St Louis half rack of ribs was tender and meaty, nice smoke ring. The pulled pork passed my wife's tough Alabama taste test. We will definitely make the 30 minute trip again!"
Rebecca F.,"Waterford Township, MI",45,38,7,2.0,4/25/2016,"This BJ's used to be so good a couple of years ago. It used to be one of my boyfriend's and my ""go to"" places to eat when we just could not decide where to go to dinner. The past several times I have eaten there the service has been down right lousey. On our most recent visit - the restuarant was not super crowded - we sat there for 10 minutes waiting for someone to just and come take our drink orders. I hate when that happens and it sours the rest of dining experience. We ended up walking out and going to eat somewhere else. The few times before service was lacking as well in various ways; empty drinks with no server in sight for a refill and waiting too long for our check. Unfortunately they have also recently raised the prices of some of our favorite menu items - the steak. This BJ's has been crossed of our list after too many second chances."
James A.,"Belleair, Tampa Bay, FL",25,48,101,4.0,2/23/2016,Great place for that late meal. They are open till midnight during the week. Most places are closed. They have an extensive menu of alcohol and food. I am having the ribs ribs tonight and they are very good. I have been here several times before and the food is always been consistent.
Suzanne B.,"Clearwater, FL",6,98,97,4.0,5/30/2015,"Good food in a typical ale house atmosphere. Lots of beer choices and a great menu, plus many large TV screens to watch your favorite teams!"
Foster M.,"Palm Harbor, FL",0,6,,5.0,12/17/2016,"Had a fantastic early lunch with some friends and was waited on by Ian. He did a phenomenal job with prompt, well conversed, enjoyable service. I had the Salmon entree blackened and it was made perfectly, my girlfriend had your iconic broccoli and cheese bread bowl, we loved the garlic bread top for dipping. Our other friend had the same and his girlfriend had the ahi tuna salad, only issue was that there was a very mineut portion of wasabi and the picture advertised large portions of avacado in the menu but when it came to the table very little was found. All in all, very helpful and friendly service with fantastic food and very little to complain about."
Christopher M.,"Gainesville, FL",66,296,294,3.0,5/23/2014,"Not really sure if it's a brewery or a brew house, meaning they don't brew on site. There are too many great breweries in the Tampa Bay Area to put BJ's in the same conversations. The beer is mediocre at best. The food was good, I had the Pepperoni Extreme, which is a flat bread pepperoni pizza. It was really good, and not too filling. I would definitely go back, for the food, but not for the beer."
Darrell A.,"Clearwater, FL",92,131,264,3.0,3/20/2016,Our server was great and very informative about the menu and our options. We were hesitant in eating here for lunch but turned out to be good.
Vanessa A.,"Palm Harbor, FL",15,22,21,4.0,12/8/2013,"The place is really nice inside, very classy and good for a date or to have a girls night out. They have an extensive list of craft beers, including local and seasonal beer selection. They also have really great Christmas specials! We got a $100 gift card and received 4 limited edition Pilsner glasses and a holiday suprise card. They also have something called a celebration for two. This is a deal gives you two starters, two entrees and one dessert,  all that for only $35!!! This is a great deal because theie menu is not too cheap yet not too expensive. Recommend this place and theie food!"
Ralph And Dawn R.,"Holiday, FL",15,10,5,5.0,5/24/2016,"Last night's beer dinner at BJ's was was the BEST EVER! Phenomenal selection of Belgians, healthy pours, and I was introduced to my new favorite beer: Liefmans Cuvee-Brut  (runner up being Ommegangs Rosetta Kriek, the first allegedly ""sour beer"" that I ever liked). Duvel has been brewing since 1600s and with cherries since 1900. AMAZING stuff that paired perfectly with BJ's AMAZING Root Beer Ribs with Siracha Cole Slaw (We will be going back for more of those and the gold medal BJ's peach wheat beer). The Santa Fe salad was a winner too and I actually loved the Triple Chocolate Pizookie even tho I am not a desert lover, usually. The local beer distributor and the BJs manager, Dustin, are very cool, knowledgeable and engaging, even coming up with fun trivia questions related to the beer. We had a wonderful experience and cant wait for the next one!"
Kim L.,"Largo, FL",0,35,11,5.0,5/10/2016,"We are BJ's Brewhouse junkies! We come here probably 3 -5 times a month. Their happy hour specials are the best in town. We always have excellent service, excellent food and their brewed in house beer is awesome."
Teresa L.,"Clearwater, FL",115,220,180,3.0,9/21/2013,"First time here.  New buffalo burger on the 575 calorie menu was good. Cooked exactly to order. Thought it'd have more spicy heat to it - a bit of disappointment there. Coleslaw with burger was very enjoyable especially with the addition of cilantro (everything's better with cilantro!) AND they didn't drown it in dressing, putting a container on the side to add more.  Beer flight was good, but I've had better. Wouldn't go here just for the beer.  Desert was gluten free chocolate chip cookie pie concoction with vanilla bean ice cream on top. Served piping hot and yummy, just wished it was close to a single serving size. Come to think of it, more of the desserts appeared to be suited for a single person serving.  Waiter was helpful but a little long between visits. Never did refill my water or offer to. Don't think I'd go here if I was in a hurry."
Julia J.,"St. Pete Beach, FL",69,49,12,2.0,2/10/2015,The gluten free pizza was mediocre at best. By the time it arrived it wasn't even lukewarm. Also ordered a gluten free pizooki and it was like soup :( server was nice but service was slow and they weren't busy at all.
Heather M.,"Downtown St. Petersburg, Tampa Bay, FL",21,69,187,4.0,9/4/2013,"I have been to Bj's plenty of times before but not this specific restaurant.  I went on a regular Saturday afternoon and it wasn't too busy. My girlfriends and I sat in the bar area. We were seated right away and greeted by our server not long after.  I started with the wonton appetizer, which was scrumptious and fried just right. Next I had one of the lunch specials, roasted veggie flatbread and side salad. The side salad was fresh and crispy. The flatbread was different, still good though. I found it to be interesting that one of veggies were green beans.  My overall experience was a great one."
Kelly K.,"Tampa, FL",369,117,102,3.0,4/3/2013,"I visit this location from time to time in attempts that it will get better. The decor is inordinate and played out. The menu is just as excessive, 10 pages? This particular time once we were seated, next to 3 children with the rest of the restaurant empty our waiter came up and acted annoyed that we were there. Since it was only quarter to one I assume he wanted to be cut and he quickly expressed he had no interest in a tip.  The food is always good, I had the BBQ Chicken salad which was exceptionally good. My gf had the Ahi Tuna salad which was also fantastic. I can't say that I've ever had a bad meal here, in fact they it's never been less that good. They even have a decent happy hour.  It'll probably be a while before I go back again, and once I will hope to have better service."
Michael J.,"Tuscaloosa, AL",1,27,13,1.0,11/2/2014,"Very disappointing.   The service was slow, I was not given a spoon to eat my soup, and the server did not give me all of my change when I paid the bill. I won't visit again."
Caitie O.,"Safety Harbor, FL",53,198,425,4.0,11/10/2014,"Holy appetizers! I came here with a friend for dinner and drinks. Unfortunately, I left my id at home and they were (understandably) strict. We ordered 4 appetizers (half price for happy hour!!). They were good, but not amazing. I really enjoyed the Mac and cheese. It was rich, cheesy, and had the crunchy breadcrumbs on top. A solid choice! What WAS amazing, was that our bill was about $20 for two people!!! I would put their food on the same level as Applebee's or Chile's (better prices)."
Anthony A.,"Dunedin, FL",55,23,1,4.0,2/21/2016,I had there buger with potato wedge fries. Meal was excellent. Burger was the right temp and had great flavor. Place looked clean and was a nice looking environment. Service was great. Prices are fair and average.
Rebecca V.,"Tampa, FL",157,226,75,4.0,4/22/2013,I end up here a few times a month due to its convenient mall location.. It beats the food court any day!  The food is always good! I normally get the balsamic glazed chicken.. It is delish!!   Appetizers are small but good..  The only problem with this place is the service is always sloooowwww! I have yet to get a good waiter/waitress!  They are normally clean and nice but not attentive and everything takes forever to get. Yes I will go again because the food quality is good and hopefully someday they will surprise me and give me excellent service!
