Duane D.,"Clearwater, FL",77,554,211,1.0,12/18/2012,"Well here it is -- my first ""one star"" review on Yelp...   I like B.J.s Restaurants.  I like the location in Pinellas Park a lot.  I was excited when they opened the Clearwater store so close to where I live. Each time I have gone, this location has been a disappointment.  The food is good, but the service is always marginal at best, and the prices are high for what you get.  I have been to the Clearwater location a few times, and each time I wonder if I will ever go back. Tonight, however, took the cake.  First, we tried to order two of the ""2 for $20"" specials they have been advertising.  At first we were told it was only one per table.  Really?  That seems ridiculous.  Then they decided to accommodate us by giving us two checks so they could give us two of the ""2 for $20"" specials.  O.k., whatever. Well this became a problem because we wound up eating in shifts -- two of us ate our dinners, and then the other two ate.  All in all, it took about two hours for dinner.  Not a good experience--caused by a work-around to a stupid policy. Then our waitress, who wasn't very responsive all night, disappeared.  With the two hour mark approaching, we asked someone else to take our check.  A third server then came back with the check and was very condescending--like he didn't want to work someone else's table.  My wife didn't care for his attitude and didn't want to respond to him, and he repeatedly harassed her about whether there was a problem until she said she didn't want to speak to him anymore.  He then argued with her and said she was being rude!  His true colors came out when he then condescendingly referred to my wife as ""Honey.""  Who does that?  Unreal. We complained to a manager on the way out, who took the server's side and basically asked us to leave -- saying that he didn't need customers like us.  I have never been treated like that in a restaurant before -- ever. Clearly the service we received at BJs is a product of poor management and poor training.  The conflict at the end of the meal could have been avoided if either the server or the manager had any people skills whatsoever. I am done.  I am sending a complaint to BJs corporate, and I am not going back to that location ever again.  If you go -- don't say you weren't warned! Updated on 12/19 -- Determined not to let that outrageous behavior stand, we contacted BJ's corporate office.  A regional manager returned our call and was extremely apologetic and agreed no customer should ever be treated that way.  I think this is going to be addressed.  Kudos to BJs for a good response.  Further evidence that BJs is not the problem, but this location is lousy--at least for now. Updated on 12/26 -- BJs corporate sent us a letter of apology and a $50 gift card.  That doesn't change my analysis of this location, but it gives me hope.  We will spend the $50 in Pinellas Park and review that location when we do."
Tnh N.,"Dunedin, FL",13,42,24,4.0,12/12/2015,Came here tonight with my family. We just had a baby so it was kinda for a table of 6 including the baby. Customer service was very nice and they were friendly and even brought over a baby car seat holder. Our waitress was nice and friendly. She had a nice hair cut and was professional and had good hygiene. I ordered spaghetti and meat balls which was not my favorite but my wife got the bison burger which was very good. We ended up switching meal. Overall good atmosphere and good food. Table of 6 with 1 appetizer and 6 meals ended up to be around $85. Also we all ordered waters. Therefore very affordable and well worth the money.  Otherwise the only thing that makes me give this place 4 stars is because we waited over an hour long before our food came out. My stomach nearly ate it self waiting for our meals...
Judy D.,"Clearwater, FL",14,89,13,2.0,7/14/2015,I guess this place is just not my cup of tea.  I asked for a wipe down on the bar and bartender used the dirty nampkin from previous customer with no spray bottle.  Yup a dry wipe down!  Next miller lite bottle $4.50.  Wow!  We ordered the wings as appetizer which were pretty good except blue cheese dressing probably one of the worst....very running!  Sucked!  Ordered burgers - mine cooked perfectly med well.  My boyfriend ordered med and also got medium well.  He was not happy.  Bun was dry and hard.  Honestly for the money won't be back.  $42 and that's with the coupon and no tip!  We have lots better places so we will move on......
Sara J.,"Riverview, FL",43,98,410,5.0,7/29/2014,We order: pizza half feta veggie and half feta grilled chicken veggie. Everything was pretty good! The fries are amazing!  Our waiter was fast and attentive. Will be back!
Shannon S.,"Tampa, FL",31,90,42,4.0,10/29/2014,"Ate here yesterday and I must say I am completely craving the chicken lettuce wrap. This was my 2nd time dining at this location and the service was better the second time around.  We ordered the goat cheese flatbread, the chicken lettuce wrap and the ahi poke. Every time I eat the ahi poke I feel like it is missing something. So I order a side of the garlic aioli to drizzle on top of it and it really makes it better.   I love the half priced wines on Tuesday. It's a great place to go and catch up with your girlfriends.  All in all its good food and spotty service. The menu and specials are great though so it's definitely worth going. Obviously I recommend the chicken lettuce wrap as I must have it again this week. Lol."
Kristen P.,"St Petersburg, FL",252,251,286,5.0,8/31/2014,"I have been to two BJ's locations and this is one of my favorite places so I am not sure why the average rating is 3, but to each their own.  I love the food here (esp the chicago style pizza) such as their parm crusted chicken.  The drinks and appetizers are always a favorite.  This is a place I will frequent often and the service is really good too.  Definitely can be busy on the weekends so book ahead if possible."
Joann A.,"New Port Richey, FL",0,3,,5.0,1/30/2017,"went to be BJ's last night,love this place! we had a server named mariah.she made our dining experience the best ever! everything we ordered was on point,we had lots of extra requests for her as well, and she came thru consistantly. its such a pleasure to be served  by someone who doesn't make you feel like your bothering them! the executive  kitchen manager was making his rounds with the guests, making sure the guests were happy,he came over and greeted us as well. it certainly is nice to see that a restaurant cares soo much! it doesn't happen often enough."
Cheryl C.,"Largo, FL",0,2,,5.0,7/31/2016,Can't wait to come back  service was excellent and food  was fabulous. Glad your only ten minutes  away :)
Rafael A.,"Tarpon Springs, FL",2,25,8,3.0,10/25/2015,"Very nice place, clean, my food was great, my girlfriends was ok, the rest of my family didn't like it that much. Took too long for everything. Waitress was kind of lost, too new to it. I would give it a second chance."
Ashton C.,"Gainesville, FL",38,69,21,2.0,6/5/2014,"Some friends and I were going to a late movie and decided to grab dinner first. I had never been to BJ's and suggested it. Its pretty much a standard franchise brew house. Fairly certain beer is not brewed on site, but I could be wrong about that. It's a Ruby Tuesday's with a slightly better beer selection. I had their light lager, comparable to a bud light. Not my favorite kind of beer, but its more wallet friendly than a nice bold craft.  I ordered the buffalo bison burger with a wedge salad, dressing on the side. I like my veg. No questions, no problem. Easy order.  Or so I thought.  Tell me yelp-verse, what does ""on the side"" mean to you? Maybe I'm wrong, but generally it means in a ramekin on the side of the plate. When my salad came it was drenched in dressing. Some dressing, whatevs, I don't care. But I  couldn't see any leafy greens, so I sent it back, politely explained that I asked for dressing on the side.  When my salad came back there was even more dressing on the salad. now completely surrounding the plate. I realized.. they thought I meant dressing on the side of the plate. Oh. My friend who is a huge fan of blue cheese dressing decided to take the salad and move it to his bill. So no harm, but I do feel like this is waitressing 101. The waitress added on to this by rolling her eyes  when she placed the second salad in front of me.  One other complaint, our food took over an hour to receive. We got there well ahead of our movie time (1.5 hours), they weren't busy and still had to throw food down our throats and rush to the theater.  The food was fairly tasty, hence the 2 stars. everyone enjoyed their meal. The buffalo bison burger was pretty good, though it had to be enjoyed on the fly."
Tianna V.,"Safety Harbor, FL",8,14,1,4.0,11/12/2015,"My boyfriend and I LOVE BJ's during football season! We sit in the bar section and can enjoy the happy hour selections as long as a NFL game is on! Their appetizers are delicious, I enjoy their honey sriracha brussel sprouts, stuffed mushrooms, potato skins, vegetable and goat cheese flat breads. It is hard to find something you don't like! Our ultimate favorite is their Great White Pizza. It will have you drooling. We get it every time!"
Catherine S.,"Palm Harbor, FL",22,1,,5.0,1/7/2016,"Came here last night for my birthday dinner after a long decision process of where to go. I hadn't been here before and heard good things about it so I decided to try it out- and I chose a great spot!! We got the appetizer to start out I believe it was called great beginnings with avocado egg rolls which I was excited to try out, mozzarella sticks, spinach and artichoke dip and these chicken taquito rolls. Soo good. For dinner I decided to try the root beer glazed wings, my mom got the fish n chips, my dad got jambalaya and my boyfriend got the Sriracha bacon chicken mac n cheese. Everyone enjoyed their meal and there was so much food everyone took home boxes. To top it all off we got the s'mores pizookie- YUM!! Prices weren't that bad too- average, server was good, food came out fast, overall it was great!"
Gina G.,"Clearwater, FL",8,7,23,4.0,11/4/2014,"The Happy Hour specials are fabulous here.  Lots of half price appetizers!  I love the plethera of beer selections too.   The parmesian encrusted chicken is really good and a huge portion.  The ""Enlightened menu"" is always a good choice when you're watching your calories.  My favorite part about BJ's is the beer and dinner pairings.  This is a must if you love beer and how it pairs with food.   We eat at BJ's about 2 times a month. If you like coupons, join the rewards club.  It's super worth it!"
S A.,"Sarasota, FL",7,28,7,5.0,8/7/2014,Love this place! Tonight The service was excellent! We had the spring rolls as a appetizer and they are always delicious! For my meal I had the chili in a bread bowl. It was cooked amazing and presentation was beautiful! And for dessert we tried the new salted Carmel pizookie! Amazing! This location always has amazing service and food!
Polly H.,"Tampa, FL",1,5,12,4.0,11/28/2014,"came in around happy hour Sunday evening and stayed closed to closing time. Decided to eat at the bar. Was semi full with one bartender (kenny/kevin?) but he was real amazing. kept the bar clean and our glasses full. Had a real nice experience, definitely not expecting for a Sunday late evening. Great food, strong drinks, exceptional service. Would def recommend. Update: Came back and Kenny/Kevin is still there! He's great, the other guy with him was not as great but he wasn't bad either. The place is super busy so I'm kicking it down to 4 stars as service at the bar seems to diminish. Perhaps they were under staffed. Took over 10min to get noticed at the bar but once food orders were in, they came out within 30min."
Anthony O.,"Palm Harbor, FL",1,36,4,4.0,8/4/2015,The pizza is good great beer selection service hit or miss a great place too watch the game with friends. The menu is too big in my opinion but will go again
Kai R.,"Elgin, IL",125,345,55,3.0,7/18/2015,We will stick with the BJ's in Pinellas Park. The food wasn't good and the service had much to be desired. It is a nice bar and sports place in the mall.
Andrea W.,"Palm Harbor, FL",31,63,196,4.0,2/15/2015,"If you want to host a party for 20 teens - BJs can pull it off - huge menu and something for absolutely every taste.  Good service, always prompt, friendly.  This place is worth a trip for the pizza size Pizookie - amazing- more if us want this hot pizza dessert for our birthdays than anything else - it's truly amazingly delicious!! The ahi poke appetizer is great as is the sampler platter.  Good lettuce wraps and awesome flatbreads! Want a happy family? Take them to dinner here after a day at the mall and order that amazing  dessert!!"
Matt B.,"Palm Harbor, FL",14,163,558,4.0,5/25/2014,"This rating might be a little on the high side, but we have had two very good lunch experiences here.  The food is tasty, and the lunch specials are incredibly affordable.....I wish BJs was actually connected to the mall, it was raining and you are actually stuck in there or you get soaked.  Have a appetizer, they are all very good."
Van N.,"Palm Harbor, FL",1,22,,3.0,8/6/2015,"Nice varieties for lunch! Had Soup & Salad (could be unlimited) - Mozarella & Tomatoes Salad and Chili as soup were very good. Others in our party enjoyed their meals as well. Slow, but adequate service."
