Morgan R.,"Houston, TX",197,85,98,4.0,10/9/2017,"First let me say, I only come here for PIZOOKIES!!!!!! I'm not originally from Texas, but when my friend introduced me to the deliciousness that is the pizookie, I was hooked! They have several different flavors of pizookies available and two sizes.  The regular size is perfect for two people! I recommend the classic chocolate chunk pizookie! It's served warm in a pizza pan with vanilla ice cream on top.  The cookies and cream pizookie is also quite nice if you want to branch out.  If you really want to enjoy your pizookie, DO NOT LOOK AT THE NUTRITIONAL INFO ON THE MENU. I love getting the pizookies here - they're a great treat to share with friends and family!  The restaurant is quite large, so the tables turn over pretty quickly, and there is plenty of parking available."
Sara N.,"Burleson County, TX",93,5,1,3.0,9/10/2017,"Ok. I've been here a few times and decided that after last week I would go ahead and write a review. I want to first start by saying that, I love the whole concept around this restaurant. The menu is full of amazing things at somewhat pricy restaurant. Here are my issues.  For one thing, a salad is the simplest items on a menu to do right, right? So, WHY, do I keep receiving rotting greens? Quality control could easily fix this problem. I know tender greens get bruised and yucky fairly easy. Just go through it and throw the gross pieces out, I don't want it in my food. It's really not hard! Second time coming and for the second time, I once again got gross, rotting, mushy greens mixed  my salad. Bj's, STOP IT! If you're the manager and reading this, your getting 3 stars over LETTUCE! Fix it!!  My other issue is the promptness of your staff. I don't want to run out of water. When I'm ready for my check, I don't want to wait 20 minutes for it to finally come to me once I have asked for it. I was there on two occasions and it wasn't busy. Check your patrons, stop being lazy, and, if all else fails and your staff has NOTHING to do, sort the damn greens! See! Problem solved for you."
Ross P.,"Katy, TX",16,42,1,4.0,1/9/2018,"For a chain they did a GREAT job. Food was very fresh, hot and fast. Had the flatbread pizza and the bartender recommended a side of extra marinara and it made all the difference in the world. If you are hitting a chain I have always found the food to be above the rest as far as chains go and the service is always good. Highly recommend."
Tadesse T.,"College Station, TX",34,94,1390,4.0,11/15/2017,I like this place and go quite offten. It is always busy and makes us wait for long. They have many selection of beer with good foods. Their staffs are nice and active and give cutomers an exceptional experience with their outstanding hospitality.
Dustin A.,"Dallas, TX",38,1,,1.0,12/23/2017,"Just left after sitting there for 20 minutes and the server only coming by our table once.  I have ate at several BJs across the country and talked my parents into trying a new place today.  The service really needs work, beside our slow server you really didn't see anyone that worked there moving like they cared about the customers....... unlikely that I will return to this location again."
Jasmine Y.,"College Station, TX",120,102,76,1.0,6/24/2017,"Absolutely not coming back. The service was terrible and the food was oily and flavorless. My parents and I ordered the appetizer sampler, jambalaya, deep dish pizza, ahi tuna salad and asparagus and shrimp penne. Their serving sizes are huge but needless to say I brought half of our food home because it just wasn't seasoned well at all. The jambalaya just tasted with tomato paste porridge with over cooked shrimp and dried out sausage. The ahi tuna salad was straight up drizzled with wasabi and had more tortilla chips than lettuce in it. The penne pasta was over cooked and tasted like nothing. The appetizer platter was alright but everything was so oily it was hard to eat any of it. However, the deep dish pizza was pretty good. Our waitress hardly minded us, she would literally disappear into the kitchen and not come out for a good 10 minutes and we'd have to wait for water for 15 minutes as well as to go boxes and the check. Terrible service. I see how the restaurant was busy, but the other servers were serving their tables just fine!"
Erica S.,"Houston, TX",121,112,110,4.0,6/1/2017,Love the beer on tap and the tvs! The service is usually very inconsistent but decent. I do love the ahi poke and ahi salad. I prefer to sit at the bar area. The menu here and at all BJ's locations is just too big in my opinion.  I love the appetizers though! They also have a great build your own pizza selection.  I'll come back but wish the service was more consistent.
Theresa P.,"North Grosvenor Dale, CT",0,7,,5.0,11/28/2017,"Love this place!  I make sure to visit every time I'm in town.  The jalapeño cucumber is to die for....and the bison burger, WOW!"
Corbett F.,"Huntsville, TX",0,22,10,5.0,8/12/2017,"Me and my girlfriend come here when we pass through the area a few times a year. They have a great menu with lots of options for carnivores and vegetarians as well. So many beer, cider, and alcohol drinks to choose from. Waiting and bar staff are super nice and inviting. You really can't go wrong with coming here. The fried asparagus is the best appetizer of all time, and the sauce is delectable."
Kevin M.,"College Station, TX",0,7,1,3.0,11/9/2017,"I do love the food and maybe one bartender. Other than that the service sucks, I could say worse but they just need more customer service in this place for how pricey it is."
Kacy M.,"Houston, TX",191,262,466,3.0,11/27/2016,The wait here is horrendous. This restaurant is packed literally 24/7. Once I even had a reservation here and they wouldn't seat us until a certain number of people showed up. Um hello? Then why the heck would I even reserve seats... The food here isn't even good or special. Whenever I come here (for birthdays) I get the Cajun pasta which is not the best compared to Cheddar's or Cheesecake Factory's versions. The only decent items on the menu are the alcoholic beverages or the pizookie (which you could make easily at home...). The food also takes long to come out.
Britanie D.,"College Station, TX",74,2,,1.0,9/15/2017,"This was the worst experience of dining out in College Station that I have EVER had. It was our 10 year anniversary- sat at the bar for a drink and an appetizer- we got beautiful drinks, guac & spinach and artichoke dip. 3 bites into my artichoke dip- I used the spoon to put it on my chip, and got a cheekful of PAPER TOWEL! I told the bartender who just grabbed both of the plates and handed them off to someone else, and continued working. Another girl came over and said we were prize winners of paper towel in our food and can she interest us in dessert. No thanks. My husband asked how this happened and she said well the paper towel holder is hanging over the dip in the kitchen. Im speechless at this point. Never will we ever ever ever go back."
Anna L.,"North Dallas, Dallas, TX",0,1,1,2.0,7/30/2017,"Anticipation builded as I opened the two pizookies I acquired through the convenient curbside pick up. I was ecstatic to get pizookies, I haven't had one in years. When I arrived at my boyfriends house, I opened the food to notice what BJ's considers a ""pizookie""- a half ass attempt at a cookie cake that doesn't even fill the box it's in. My smores pizookie, however, was very much all there. It was the cookies and cream one that was messed up. I will not be ordering Togo food from this restaurant again nor will I recommend patronage to this egregious place!"
James M.,"Oceanside, CA",1,12,2,5.0,11/26/2017,This is our favorite chain restaurant in the area. We are yet to have a bite of food we don't like. The beer selection is great. Servers can be hit or miss but on this trip we had Charlotte who was great!
Lindsey H.,"Burnet, TX",8,20,3,1.0,4/8/2017,Showed up to pick up my food and every door was locked. Don't advertise take out until midnight if you lock all your doors!! I am so freaking angry!!!! I better not get charged for the food I didn't even receive.  Update: Gave them another shot and the food was not good at all. Our potato skins were overcooked and both of our salads tasted off. I think we are done with BJ's.
Chris C.,"Redmond Terrace, College Station, TX",34,2,,1.0,8/15/2017,"Hot food was cold. 13 dollar salad had about 4 slices of chicken on it. Services was non-existent, servers only paid attention to one large party although the rest of the place was empty. Had to leave cash on table because server never came back. No refills. Worst 80 bucks I've ever spent. Won't be back."
L.J. M.,"Fayetteville, TX",0,36,68,5.0,7/25/2017,"Great atmosphere, selection, and food! You can always try something new. The pazooki is a must try."
JD G.,"Austin, TX",318,182,52,4.0,3/29/2017,"I'm fairly happy with my experience at BJ's...the food is consistently good, the service is great for the most part (with the exception of the stupid greeters), and their prices are reasonable. I thought I would address one of the complaints that people have about BJ's, which is the wait. If you were smart, you could avoid every having to wait. With the app, you can put your name on the waiting list before ever leaving your house or work to eat. Even better, if you're in a huge hurry, you can even order ON THE APP before you even sit down, that way when you do get seated, they're already cooking your food so you only have to wait on your server to bring your drinks. That's super impressive to me and I love doing that...you just have to get the greeters on board because they essentially have to check you in, and they don't always do that right, which frustrates me. So basically, if you wait, that's your fault...you can't blame anyone but yourself :-)"
Jeff E.,"Farmersville, TX",18,24,6,5.0,7/27/2016,Had the wasabi seared tuna salad and Jeremiah Red beer. Both where delicious.  The salad was fresh and the tuna just kissed with some sear. The Jeremiah Tedder beer has 5 different malts in it and low hops making it very drinkable.
Randall H.,"Plano, TX",0,2,,1.0,12/24/2016,Restaurant is soo. cold you can't enjoy the food. Why running ac in the winter??? Overpriced for quality of the food.
Cathie V.,"College Station, TX",8,19,,2.0,8/9/2017,"We arrived early for dinner, the restaurant was practically empty on a Wednesday. The hostess sat us right away to the furthest table from the front door, in front of the kitchen. Since the restaurant was nearly empty we asked for a booth closer to the front or center. The hostess wanted us to follow her back through the empty restaurant to the greeting area to have us re seated. My husband picked a table on the way and told her it would be fine. When we asked for a second glass of water it finally arrived when we were done eating. My husbands chicken meal was fine however my coleslaw had no dressing whatsoever - it must've just been served right out of the bag of slaw. Oh, and the napkins on the table when we were finally seated were very damp; we had to ask for dried napkins. No reason to return here with so many other good restaurants in town."
Samuel C.,"Austin, TX",93,666,,4.0,12/9/2015,"Great room. Average food which is getting better over time. One TERRIFIC item BJ's is a chain, and not a bad one. As Chili's steadily degenerates with cost cutting, short staffing and undertrained cooks - BJ's has become my new go-to for an all-American-bar-and-restaurant place. The decorating is terrific. You walk in and you immediately feel happy and that you are about to eat and drink very well. (Whether or not you actually WILL eat well is a bit of a dice roll at BJ's  but hope always springs eternal when a restaurant is spacious and classy.) The bar is heavy on corporate microbrews, and commercial flavored vodkas -  meaning this is not what I am looking for in a place to drink. Much of the food is ""that's nice dear"". The star of their show is the pizza. The pizza is dramatically better than what you would expect from a chain American place. What is their secret? Instead of tomato sauce, they use actual seasoned tomatoes. Using real tomatoes rather than commercial pizza sauce makes all of the difference in the world  on a pizza. American pizza sauce is flavorless red paint - that you make taste like something by dumping pepperoni on top of it. Real tomatoes taste like tomatoes - and BJ's pizza actually tastes fresh. Add that they have the strong flavored ""other ingredients"" that other pizza places ought to stock but don't. Anchovies. Asparagus Seasoned Brussels sprouts. And all the normal meat items you would like to see like italian sausage and bacon to allow you to forget the fact you are eating all of those vegetables. (Waiter, I'll take the bacon bacon bacon bacon and Brussels sprouts pizza!  Tell my doctor I'm eating healthy!) But jokes aside, actual decent ingredients with real tastes combined with genuine bona fide tomatoes means that you have a pizza that does not taste like a cardboard frisbee that has just been home delivered from Domino's. This is where I intend to hang out for a year or three while I wait for Chili's to decide if they actually want to serve food or they just want to concentrate on profits."
Steven P.,"College Station, TX",228,2,1,1.0,4/6/2017,"After getting seated at our table, we were waiting for too long to not only get our food, but also to get our checks. This restaurant failed to cater to their customers, and the wait was awful. The waiter was rude and we had many different servers throughout the night."
Amber L.,"College Station, TX",14,4,,1.0,4/2/2017,There's a hundred and one things wrong with this places service. Things that bothered me most; took 15 minutes to finally get approached by a waiter and once we were finally approached he didn't even ask if we were ready to place our order just asked us what our drinks would be; took 20 minutes to bring us back our Salads; drinks were empty the 2 times he actually came to our table and when my boyfriend asked for a refill he didn't even offer to refill mine as well so it just stayed empty; salad lettuce was turning brown. Just not worth the price after the awful service.. it would be okay if they took care of their customers
Nancy J.,"Calvert, TX",5,23,,3.0,6/27/2016,"This is only a three because my husband said the craft beer was good.  We were seated quickly (plus) by a fake-y hostess who shouted, ""Absolutely!"" each time we asked a question or made any comment (such as ""Thank you.""). (Minus) Server came quickly (plus). We ordered an appetizer and thin crust pizza to share. Took a while for the appetizer, no problem. However, no sooner had we taken a bite of the appetizer, than our pizza arrived. The appetizer (avocado egg rolls) were pretty good but we didn't get to enjoy them. Appetizers are actually supposed to come before your meal.  The thin crust was fine around the edges - for the first piece. Center pieces were totally soggy. When my husband bit into a second crust piece, it had gone soggy. (Minus, minus, minus) This is not the reason for ordering thin crust pizza -you want it crispy. We looked at the serving dish. It was plastic. Maybe the reason for the soggy crust?  Come on, for those prices you can do better. The taste was good, soggy was not."
Gina H.,"College Station, TX",0,4,,1.0,8/14/2017,"What do I say? I've been coming here for 6 years, maybe twice or three times a year. I keep trying to give them the benefit of the doubt because the food is pretty darn good and the atmosphere is decent. But, seriously, the front of house problems never.get.fixed. The cooks, the dishwashers, and the bartenders are doing a bang-up job, but whoever's managing front of house (and I suspect they have tremendous turnover there because it continues to suck) have just been royally f***ing up- for 6 straight years. I have to believe that it's a franchise/ownership problem because I hate to blame the servers and hosts/hostesses themselves although obviously there's huge turnover there too. I've waited 20 min to be seated with multiple empty tables (scheduling); I've been seated with no service for 15-20 min on multiple occasions (scheduling and training); I've been seated and orders taken but no water, no silverware, no check-ins for 20, srsly sometimes 25 min (training/management). Tonight, a Monday during the summer when there was clearly not a crowd, we and every other patron who came in were asked, ""Are you part of our loyalty program?"" ""No? Well, 20 mimutes wait.""  Are you f***ing serious? No. I'm done. Good luck and I hope your hard-working cooks find work somewhere worth their while."
Richa T.,"Dallas, TX",387,653,132,4.0,11/10/2015,"Came here for an event our school was having and they did a wonderful job running the reception. It was quite crowded but the food was amazing and they are very attentive. They placed a large selection of great food - definitely a lot considering the number of dietary restrictions we had.  My favorite were the southwest rolls,  they are the bomb. Also, we found out that they were doing a big anything get a pizza cookie free off the menu.  I seriously expected the waiters to be upset when so many of us used a coupon, but they were absolutely great and very accommodating. I highly recommend this spot. The food is your typical ""bar"" food but your experience probably won't be."
Anna S.,"Aledo, TX",0,4,,2.0,3/11/2017,"The food and drinks were fantastic. The Nutty Brunnette might be the best beer I've ever had. However, horrible service ruined it. I wanted another beer, but the server never came to offer me another. He even passed by us with napkins in plates pushed toward the edge of the table before he came back.  It really sucks that one individual was able to ruin a dining experience that would have otherwise been delightful."
Jasmine D.,"Mesquite, TX",0,14,11,4.0,8/18/2016,"Came here with my family after moving in for school. There's a BJs in my home town, so I was looking forward to see how it chalked up As soon as we walked in, we were greeted and taken to a booth. I got the strawberry lemonade to start with, and I firmly believe that BJs has the best strawberry lemonade I have ever tasted As an appetizer, we got mozzarella sticks, potato skins, and calamari. Mozzarella sticks really went above and beyond; great taste and AMAZING stretch factor. Potato skins seemed overcooked, and although I personally didn't eat the calamari, the rest of the family said its ""eh"".  Main course, there was pizzas and the shrimp-asparagus pasta. Pizzas were delicious, as to be expected, and the pasta was lacking in the meat department  The service here was great; the waitress was always there to refill my lemonade, and she got us whatever we requested with a smile.  Overall, this is a nice place to eat, albeit a little pricey. Great food, great service, and a great time.  Below are quotes from my family: ""I thought potato skins were like mini baked potatoes, not this"" ""I like the stage that the pizza was on"" ""This was 90% pasta and 10% shrimp"" ""The mozzarella sticks stretched for like 10 miles"" ""Good pizza"""
Barbara E.,"Richmond, TX",0,6,,4.0,7/4/2017,"I haven't  been to  BJS in years. I was pleasantly surprised by menu changes .fish, steaks, salads and chicken. I had Mahi Mahi with shrimp which  was  delicious. My husband had the spaghetti  and said it was great and meaty. My son had a pizza and loved the flavors. My daughter  had boneless chicken  wings  with the rootbeer  glaze..there's  a wide variety of  beer. We all enjoyed the avacado egg rolls. Service was pleasant and quick."
Ravi K.,"Houston, TX",0,35,,2.0,5/6/2017,"I like going to BJ's and have had good experiences in Houston and LA. However, at this location the food was bad. I ordered deep dish buffalo pizza and it was bad. Beer was good. Service was good. We don't plan on going here at College Station."
Barbara R.,"Cuero, TX",0,3,,1.0,7/3/2017,We have eaten at many BJs and they are consistently good however today at lunch the service was horrible!  They messed up the order on the appetizer twice and 30 minutes later I' m still waiting on my salad.
David R.,"Cypress, TX",60,22,1,5.0,12/21/2016,"Our wait staff was great.  The were friendly, prompt, and good with my kids.  The food was good."
Ted A.,"Flower Mound, TX",1,143,58,3.0,5/22/2015,"Attending a celebration for new college grad with party of 14. They had table ready early and had well trained, attentive folks serving us.  Electic menu helped people with choices,  most opted for pizza. The combo deep dishes with everything and the Mediterranean were the favorites, the thin crusts not so much. Chicken salads and pasta dishes were hit and miss. The Pizookies were definitely a hit, the Double Chocolate won the day.  Good place for large groups, service is focused and getting many food choices out quickly makes for an enjoyable experience."
Amy M.,"Old Hickory, TN",1,8,415,3.0,6/15/2016,Our soccer team descended on this large restaurant at lunchtime.   They were clearly overwhelmed.  Our server had over 7-8 tables including large ones. Good was good.  They had trouble keeping drinks filled.  Forever until drinks were delivered from bar.  The pizza had a great flavor but not hot. Then I found an entire twist tie by biting down in it. Yuck.  They comped it right away and were nice about it.  So.   The food was good.  Don't come at a peak time if it's busy unless you have plenty of time. Great selection of beers and craft beers.
Angela B.,"Hereford, TX",0,25,18,4.0,4/9/2017,Always a good choice for quick service and a well rounded menu that keeps large families with picky eaters satisfied.  Husband enjoys he availability of tvs and mom likes the wine choices.
Matt T.,"Tomball, TX",3,13,1,1.0,1/28/2017,"Complete chaos! The visit started out fine but a little slow but ok for a Saturday night. The waiter was delivering the food when a ramekin of soy sauce slide off a plate and landed on my girlfriend and in her Louis Vuitton purse, clutch, jacket and phone.   The waiter quickly apologized and provided towels to sop up the mess.  After 10 minutes of me cleaning up the ""Manager"" finally found his way to the table.  Alex the Manager made no attempt to help clean or offer to move us to another table but stumbled through getting our information.   Alex offered to take care of the meal but couldn't have been less concerned about the mess. Maybe if this junior manager was less concerned about the comp and more concerned about the guest I wouldn't be writing this.   Alex scurried off and I had to ask the server to bring him back to find out about any follow up regarding our damaged property.   I am sure I will not be returning to BJ's until they are willing to invest in better management.  I happen to have been in the industry for 20 years and have not seen a more apathetic manager in all my years."
Pauline L.,"Kirkland, WA",447,194,1830,3.0,10/3/2013,"I ordered a beer sampler, which was supposed to be 5 oz and they came out with what I know to be only 2 oz. As a baker, I know what my ounces look like and I am pretty bitter that they jipped me on alcohol. I did jot pay $3 for 3 oz less than what you're supposed to give me. I ordered the bison burger. It came out, was smaller than I expected to get from a restaurant. Islands' Burgers are so much bigger and better. The patty was just normal sized and didn't taste all that different from regular beef. The ""coleslaw"" that came with it was NASTY. It was so flavorless and was basically cabbage and maybe some other shredded vegetable. I had to ask for extra chipotle BBQ sauce (which wasn't all that astounding; could be something you buy at the store) and smothered the coleslaw in order to eat it. I wouldn't order this again for $9. Not worth it. I'd rather go back to my favorite Carter's Burgers. I tried my friend's berry beer and Irish Root Beer. They were very good. I don't like normal beer, so these sweet or fruity drinks really were up my alley. Service was nice but a little slow, considering it was the night when everyone is trying to eat out at night because all these undergrads got their rings. A good experience I had at this place was my first time here with my BF a couple months ago. I ordered the Thai Mango Salad and the endless root beer. This salad was awesome. I should have just ordered this again, but it was like $3 more than the burger. The sauce was great, the mangoes tasty, the crispy wontons were a nice addition. I bet this is one of the better items compared to the individual pizzas or the bison burger.  So, come here for the Thai mango salad, the beer or root beer, and not the burgers or mini pizzas."
Hillary D.,"Shreveport, LA",85,18,3,5.0,8/24/2016,"My husband is on a business trip here in college station and this place is right down the road. It looked like something we would like, so we stopped in. The beer was excellent. They let us try several different flavored before choosing one to purchase. It was also half off wine night which was great for me. The selection was pretty good too. He had the bison burger and I had the sirloin. Both were very good. I had the roasted asparagus as a side and it was amazing. My husband doesn't even eat greens and he had a couple! Very laid back atmosphere and friendly staff. We would definitely go back. Oh and the pazooki for dessert was amazing!"
Jesse A.,"College Station, TX",0,2,,5.0,4/24/2016,"Omg, I love this place. The service, the food, the cleanliness of the restaurant, all top notch.  Its very tough to find all 3 of those in a restaurant now a days.  My picky 3 year old gobble his pizza up in record time and asked of a second one! I had to tell the manager before we left, of our great experience and he was so nice.   If you hate servers who fill your drink before you have to ask, a place that gets your order right, delicious food and a staff that is very inviting and friendly, then bjs isn't for you.  Lol If you have high standards for your dining experiences , try Bjs. They won't disappoint."
