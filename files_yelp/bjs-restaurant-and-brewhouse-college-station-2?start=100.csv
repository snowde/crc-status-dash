Chris T.,"College Station, TX",362,39,21,5.0,5/22/2012,Irish rootbeer and the watermelon and feta salad.  Followed by the brownie topped with ice cream and lots of whipped cream. What's not to love?
Tony H.,"Austin, TX",81,269,53,4.0,11/14/2012,"If you've been to one BJ's, you've been to them all.  I'm a big BJ's fan and have yet to be disappointed by the food options, quality, or taste.  There was a pretty large group of us, right before the lunch rush, but we all got in and out within a reasonable amount of time.  The waitress was very friendly.  Prices for any BJs typically run between $10 and $25 for a meal, but can vary or be a little more depending on what you are getting."
Salim G.,"Richmond, TX",324,211,8,2.0,1/29/2012,"Came here specifically for the pizaoki and they didn't have any chocolate chip pizaoki on a Saturday night?  What A Fail!  The service at the bar was pretty bad too, the waitress never smiled at us and took forever to come around.  The reason I gave it to was that the double chocolate pizaoki was pretty good."
Melissa I.,"Madisonville, TX",98,6,1,1.0,2/17/2012,Call ahead seating/waiting sucks.  Only puts you ahead of others that call in.  Horrible management...especially Alex....over compensates for his lack of social/service skills.
Donald M.,"Stephenville, TX",1,19,2,2.0,6/24/2012,"It is always a challenge for a eating establishment when they seat nine (9) because it takes coordination. They did that part correct. The server was pleasant and the group generally had a good time. Not one person raved about their meal, but neither did anyone complain. So, a positive experience. We did not choose the location for the libations, only two ordered alcoholic beverages, and we got a fair meal. It is a chain and it shows: food you can count on but not rave about."
Andrea S.,"Houston, TX",50,95,240,4.0,8/19/2012,"Really glad this place made it to B/CS - Pizza and craft brews are great. Truthfully I think the B/CS location is the best one I have been to. There is a lot of seating, which is good because college town restaurants fill up pretty fast."
Pam L.,"Tyler, TX",5,7,22,4.0,1/21/2013,"Love the root beer and the avocado rolls. Atmosphere is very nice, not quiet, but not loud either."
Meghan M.,"College Station, TX",5,1,,5.0,8/24/2011,"I was very pleased with my experience at BJ's this past week.  Went for a short brunch with a friend to try out the restaurant and we were both pretty blown away by the atmosphere and food alike. The service was super friendly, helpful and present. The food was way above average. For a college student with a limited budget, I feel it is way worth the money for a meal that you know a good amount of time was spent on. I would highly recommend BJ's!"
Dana W.,"Macon, GA",42,168,1,4.0,8/5/2011,"I have to knock them down a star.  I've been back a few times since my last review.  The service was still good and the food still yummy.  But what's REALLY annoying are the highly scripted ""advertisements"" the waitstaff are required to say to every table they serve.  No, I am not interested in trying a Jeremiah Red or one of your other hand-crafted beers.  No, I do not want to ""get started off tonight"" with an order of avocado egg rolls or mozzarella sticks.  No, I did not ""save room"" for one of your chocolate chip Pizookies.  It's not cool to push specific products on people.  It's tacky."
Sarah O.,"College Station, TX",0,3,,1.0,8/3/2012,"From the watery, disgusting, iceberg lettuce salad, to the overpriced frozen mozzarella sticks, to our pizza order that was incorrect, we were disappointed from start to finish. The one and only highlight was the beer my husband had. It was a $45 dollar ticket for my husband and I to have bad pizza. Not impressed. We will not be back."
Christopher P.,"Seattle, WA",0,12,10,4.0,7/14/2011,"Had a buffalo Chicken pizza that was pretty good. The crust was pretty thick. I got to sample most of the beers they brew since I went with a large group of friends and would recommend any of them. The downside to their Happy Hours 3-7 and 9-11, is that you have to order from the bar. Our waitress, after she served us our first drink, told us they were not happy hours prices and that we had to go to the bar and order if we wanted those prices.  Also as Greg D. mention previously, they do not brew beer at any Bj's. They brew it at St. Aronld's and ship it to their locations. I was told this is because they want the beer at all of their locations to taste consistent.  If it was actually brewed at each location there might be some differences in the flavor of the beers depending on the brew-master. I would recommend for the beer, the food was a little pricey."
Craig Y.,"College Station, TX",4,10,1,3.0,7/18/2011,"I am not a drinker so that is not an appeal to me.  However, I did have the California burger.  It has avocado and jalapenos and it comes on a Sour Dough bun.  Yeah, it rocked.  Food is a little pricey, but the service was good and the atmosphere was fun.  I want to go back for another Cali Burger!"
Gabe H.,"Bryan, TX",0,27,,2.0,1/28/2014,The pizookie is what gets the two star review.  It's delicious.  The rest of the food here tasted like it had sat out quite sometime before being cooked.  Never had chicken at a BJ's before that tasted stale and mushy.  Disclaimer - this review is strictly for this location.  I'm a fan of BJ's but this place didn't do it for me.
Joanna B.,"College Station, TX",0,3,6,5.0,7/24/2011,"We celebrated a friends birthday here and I was impressed with the service and the food.  I loved it!  I also had the Cali burger, and I had it with a wheat bun and a salad on the side.  It was so delicious, I can't wait to go back again to have another.  The waitress was super.  I have a very curious and energetic 10 month old, the waitress was fast, brought us crackers to keep her occupied while we were waiting, brought a drink for her, etc...she was super!  What can I say...I was pretty satisfied.  Also my husband had a pretty darn good beer too..I do not care if it is not really brewed at this location..I would come again and would recommend to anyone."
M E.,"Anchorage, AK",0,10,,1.0,11/25/2012,"Going to have to place BJ's on the do not attend list, food serving temp is getting worse. Rice, noodles, chicken, shrimp, etc coming out cold still, had to send Jamabalaya back tonight, was nuked red hot in middle of rice mush but cold around outside, rice did not survive microwave, all shrimp and chicken was cold with super hot center to mushy rice. Not sure what went wrong here, I tried to work with management over last several visits, but new owners don't seem to care or are out of touch, food quality continues to drop. Will not be back until I hear sustained reports of good service. You shouldn't have to pick your meal on what you think will come out at proper temperature . Used to be a favorite at least once a week but not anymore."
