J R.,"Houston, TX",50,24,13,1.0,5/1/2016,"My husband ordered a Med-rare steak and it came back over well. It was basically a hamburger. This was after we waited for an hour to get our food. If the chefs can't cook a steak, they need new chefs. The manager was unbelievably rude. We nearly got up and walked out. Will never return again."
Blake K.,"Hermitage, TN",115,3,,5.0,9/3/2016,"Went here on a Saturday night after the game against UCLA, super short wait for a busy night. Service was fast, attentive, and overall amazing. Food was delicious and piping hot."
Janet S.,"College Station, TX",17,20,,4.0,12/15/2016,BJ's is one of our favorite places to go when the kids and grandkids come to visit.  Lots of variety so everyone gets to eat what they want.  Very reasonable in price and the food is consistently good.  The wait staff are friendly and accommodating.
Jordan H.,"College Station, TX",0,2,,3.0,11/3/2016,"Good food, I love the pizookies. However, I've lived in the area for years and have been here more than enough to know that the service is HORRIBLE. On multiple occasions, I've had to get up to ask for a refill or my check while witnessing my waitress doing nothing, even texting on occasion during the dinner rush. Not only are they inattentive, but many of the waitresses are just flat out rude with forced smiles and clearly do not care to serve you or even be there. Staff always seems overwhelmed even with minimal tables. Out of all my experiences, only ONE positive waiter experience in the section furthest from the bar-- so I would try to sit there. Literally one of the worst places in the BCS area for customer service."
Jasmine S.,"Beaumont, TX",3,1,3,2.0,8/16/2015,"They've gotten something wrong with my order both times I've decided to try this place. First time my burger was burnt, and second time the gave me old food. (Ordered the southern fried chicken). Had a spoon full of old corn and the chicken wasn't fresh. I sent the chicken order back, and it still wasn't what I expected, just another spoon full of old corn added.  Good point: waitress was very nice and patient. Dessert cookie/ice cream was very good! Triple chocolate was my fav"
Nicole R.,"Apex, NC",61,75,33,4.0,12/4/2013,Um pizookie.... That is all. Oh I guess there is more.  The flatbread pizzas are yummylicious and so are the avocado egg rolls. I like that this place is open late and the staff is always very friendly and attentive.  Yum and yum.
Greg D.,"College Station, TX",3350,3288,41722,2.0,6/2/2013,"During an oil change at Sears which took way longer than expected got curious about the summer wheat as I had not tried it since last year.  Found it to be a stable, basic standard issue wheat no where near being worth over $5 a pint.  Was interesting to note that the giant 15 foot wide Panasonic HD TV over the bar is actually one single panel that's divided into 4 screens.  See, when you sell overpriced average beer you can afford a $30,000 tv no problem.   After having recently eaten and drank at some actual authentic brewery restaurants in Colorado where they actually brew the beer there (instead of making it look like they do here), I can't give more than 2 stars as I have had better very recently."
Jennifer B.,"College Station, TX",28,11,3,5.0,1/28/2016,"My husband and I don't usually frequent chain restaurants, but make an exception for BJ's. We love to go to BJ's on Tuesday nights for dinner & half-priced wine! We especially like to sit at the bar because we so enjoy watching the bartender, Jessica, work! She is so competent, effeicent & friendly, without being at all obtrusive. She helps make a good meal a great dining experience! Also, love all the menu options- eat healthy if you want, or really indulge!"
Maggie Q.,"Huntsville, TX",0,11,44,2.0,6/7/2015,"First time at this place. They seriously need a new chef. The steak was bland at best , even the A1 did little to jelp it out. The baked potato was flavorless with a little dab of butter and 4 chives.  The decor is nice and the waitstaff helpful."
David S.,"College Station, TX",2,37,,5.0,3/17/2016,"This restaurant is a reputable chain that never disappoints. The service is great, the atmosphere is alive and the food is great! Their signature beers are great as well. Great venue for groups."
Dave D.,"Brentwood, TN",5,53,13,1.0,10/6/2015,"Do you wonder why the immense crowds waiting for a table are gone from BJ's? It's the food; and therefore the value. I don't mind paying what are high prices for good food. And when BJ's is good, it's really good. Their deep dish BJ's favorite is delicious. Look online at the picture and your mouth will water. The pizza in the picture is near the top of the pan and full of meat and veggies. When we got our recent pizza delivered I actually thought we got the wrong pizza because it didn't even come half way up the pan, and as I pointed out to our waitress half the pizza was missing peppers and olives. It was like they had a contest to make the fastest pizza and just threw ingredients on without any pride. I'm not kidding you, 30% of the pizza was just dough and not toppings. When I showed the waitress our pizza she said ""what can I do?""  So I flippantly said free pizookies. She said she would see what she could do. When it was time (we ordered a large pizza that was $24.75 folks!). To get our free desserts we found out it was one mini, a $3.33 retail value. At that point I didn't even want it, but they brought it. Then the manager on duty came over and did his ""hey Bro"" squat at the table and said ""sorry you had a bad experience"". For $25 pizza that feeds two I really just want a good pizza. He kept saying ""what can I do?""  When I told him the dough was actually uncooked and didn't rise he educated me in pizza dough proofing. Is it my job to train him that for a pizza as poor as this he should have made us another one and not had us leave irritated. Anyway, I love the restaurant. But what I  find at this chain is hot and cold restaurant standards. If you want to roll the dice that tonight will be good, then go for it because when they are good it is good."
Laura Beth W.,"Bryan, TX",0,3,,2.0,3/5/2016,"I have eaten at this BJ's multiple times and everytime the service gets worse. I have had waiters literally disappear and never come back. I have been seated and waited 30 plus minutes for a waiter to address our table. The food is good, but $8 for mozzerela sticks... Come on! These prices would be okay if the service itself was at least decent! If you have strong patience and a whole night to wait, then this place will do, otherwise take your business elsewhere!"
Kevin C.,"College Station, TX",0,70,,3.0,9/2/2016,this place is just a option when we don't have choice to go other one.
Robert B.,"Houston, TX",183,14,16,5.0,4/7/2013,"Two can dine for $20. Having 2 salads, medium Mediterranean pizza and raspberry white chocolate pazookie.  Grab some of their Thai Seafood wrap as a appetizer!"
Kimberly Skye T.,"College Station, TX",0,3,9,4.0,1/21/2016,Love the food and the atmosphere! The menu has everything from flat bread appetizers to couscous! The craft beer and drink selection is also fantastic! This is one of my favorite places to eat! I highly recommend it!
Taylor R.,"College Station, TX",0,11,1,5.0,4/9/2015,"Great Service, drinks and food. A little pricey (considering this location is set in a college town) but if you can spare a few extra bucks, it's well worth it.  My favorite items so far are their chicken wings and California flatbread pizza."
CJ S.,"College Station, TX",1,40,13,2.0,7/3/2014,"The food and selection isn't bad all. The atmosphere is nice. It is clean and parking is fine. But...the service is terrible. I've never been anywhere (except maybe Taco Bell) where the employees could care less.  We had 5...FIVE different waitstaff. It took 10 mins to get our initial greeting and another 10 for our drink which was actually incorrect. A sloppy waiter with his tips in his shirt front pocket, half untucked, un-ironed, food/armpit stains. It seems like a classy place. However, staff is more about hanging out together at a booth or in the corner rather than helping people. Homebrew is tastey. But NOT worth $6 per glass (which I was unaware of). A few beers and a mediocre appetizer was close to $30. I had to get up 3 times to request a refill as our waiter never would come back (3pm and it was empty). That is a huge tab for a cpl beers and 1/2 raw mini pizza with poor service. My 1st time and last time to go. They do have wifi. So slow however that it is unusable."
Ratika G.,"Houston, TX",149,28,6,4.0,9/27/2015,"Try their deep dish pizzas and a special dessert called Pizookie. I ordered a Ravioli and although it was good, their deep dish pizza was simply mouthwatering. They have special discounts on their app. I got a 20% off. Check that out too."
Jessica L.,"Lafayette, LA",3,17,16,2.0,9/12/2015,"Food here is good, but the service is quite poor. The waitress who served us had a very cold attitude to us, but she treated other table very well. I think maybe the customers on that table looks like they'd give more tips than us. Is this the way that they trained the waitress in this restaurant I doubt. Her attitude was too obvious that we can't ignore. Next time I'd rather choose other restaurant, maybe the Chuy's next to this one, to enjoy my weekend lunch."
Poojee S.,"London, United Kingdom",27,12,,3.0,8/23/2014,Good food! Open till late. Amazing Pizookie :)  May be the servers could have been a little friendly.
