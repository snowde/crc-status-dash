Lorna N.,"Athens, GA",5,4,140,5.0,5/26/2014,Best burgers and crafted beer in Bryan-College Station ... and save room for a triple chocolate Pizookie ... a chocoholic dream
Andrew L.,"College Station, TX",0,20,,4.0,7/14/2016,"The food was good (much better than my expectation). However, with the price I will probably come here once every half of a year."
Krystal I.,"Boyett, TX",7,4,,5.0,4/20/2015,"I eat there several times a month so I figured time for a review! The main draw is that they are open late, and since I get off work late it's the best food in town at that time. A little pricey, which is why we keep our visits to only a few times a month, but it's definitely a treat! Especially the pizookies! Get the cookies and cream one! And calamari appetizer is a must :) The traditional deep dish pizza is always on point. I try to go early as early as possible after work becuase in the last hour they cut down to one server and seat everyone in cocktail, which would be fine if it wasn't always so busy at that time! Service is incredible regardless; there's only one server out of the dozens that I've had there that I don't like, his name is Kyle I think, but the other 99% of the time the service is awesome and the food is great, so I gave 5 stars :) Managers are always friendly and fun to talk to, the hostesses always smile and are polite, exactly what you'd expect for the prices. Besides the one server, I haven't had any other bad experiences, which is impressive since I've been there about a hundred times since I've lived in CS"
Mark M.,"Houston, TX",0,245,1,3.0,2/17/2014,"Have been to a few BJ's over the years, and have never been disappointed.  This trip was a little more on the disappointing side.  I've always enjoyed the deep dish pizza at BJs -- not outstanding, but it has always been quite good, and when one lives in a relatively pie-free area of the country, you take what you can get.  This trip, the pizza was disappointing.  Soggy, too-thin crust, relatively sparse and dry toppings -- wish I had opted for a burger.  A few of our orders had minor errors in execution as well.  Given the pricing at BJ's, I'll avoid this particular one in the future -- not bad, but you can easily do better for the money."
Samantha L.,"Houston, TX",2,49,27,1.0,1/10/2015,"So apparently this establishment does not serve tomatoes on a margarita pizza.... Hmmm funny the definition is fresh tomatoes, basil, and cheese. A mudslide and Colorado bull dog are not the same thing. Pizza was under flavored."
K W.,"College Station, TX",0,2,,4.0,4/14/2016,"The beer and appetizers are good. The best part of my trip to BJ's was my server. If you have the opportunity, ask to be sat in Cynthia's section...you won't regret it! She's one of the best servers. I would go back just because of the service we received and the numerous beers on tap!"
Jeffrey P.,"Montgomery, TX",1,14,1,2.0,9/1/2014,"BJ's better turn this ship around... I don't know if they are growing too quickly, or what, but the quality at BJ's has been going down the last couple of times we have gone there. It also irritates me that they have big posters displaying seasonal beers that they are ALWAYS OUT OF! Yesterday, our waiter spent more time flirting with the hostess than he did taking care of our table (before he went on lunch break).  His attitude was also annoying when my son asked if he could have vanilla added to his Dr. Pepper and the waiter just looked at him like he was stupid and gave a terse, ""No!"" As far as the food goes... If you get anything other than a pizza, it's not impressive."
Tyler M.,"Milroy Farms, TX",17,90,44,4.0,2/14/2016,Went on Valentine's Day expecting crowds and all that but we beat the crowds and we were promptly seated at our table. Our waiter came over his name was Kyle like the field he said which I thought was clever. He asked what we wanted to drink but we ask for just another minute so he left and came back after a minute or two. My mom still wasn't really sure what she wanted to drink (didn't know it was that hard but ok) so he recommended several drinks and was very patient and we finally ordered drinks. They promptly came out he even brought out a sample of one of the drinks he recommended for us to taste and it was good. Now onto food! We ordered to caprese salads and I had the poke (pronounced Pokeh it a Hawaiian thing) basically raw tuna with a soy sauce avocado and onions man it was fantastic. I then had the double burger which Kyle told me was going away next week so beware of that. It to was awesome bereft seasoning nice bum toppings were a good compliment to the beef but not too much. Of course then we had to try a pizzokie which as usual was awesome. I cannot say enough about how great our sever Kyle was great guy and incredibly knowledgeable and helpful.
John A.,"Des Plaines, IL",24,67,6,5.0,4/11/2015,Tried the new BJ's Classic Tavern Cut Pizza. My waiter Joshua said I wouldn't be disappointed and I wasn't. I have a new favorite.
Steven L.,"College Station, TX",182,76,21,3.0,1/26/2015,"They have a really good Happy Hour which is extended on days there is pro football on the TV. I highly recommend you get the app and get points for your meal if you ever plan on going more than once, they really pay off with good coupons, etc. The strawberry lemonade is very good, as well as the mini pizzas and of course the pizookies. Get one to go if you can't finish your meal, they are really good, especially the Oreo version. Lots of vegetarian options as well."
Reeny H.,"Houston, TX",4,100,,4.0,2/14/2015,BJs is always a fun place to catch up with friends or watch a game. The food is delicious (not very diet friendly though).
Minda W.,"Austin, TX",200,198,171,1.0,3/8/2013,"Avoid going here at all costs. It's so awful. Part 1 (Waiting): First off, they only take reservations for groups of 1-6. Who does that? Really. Anyway, we (a group of 10) waited for a table for 45 minutes at 8:30pm on a Thursday night. They had a completely empty section and had told us that it would be a 20 minute wait. What the heck. Part 2 (More waiting): It took 40 minutes to get our food out and 20 minutes from seating for the waiter to take our order. That's a total of 1 hour 45 minutes of waiting for the most mediocre food I have ever experienced. Part 3 (Food): We got the Crispy Jalepeno Burger and the California Club; both were too soggy with grease to even pick up. Both were way too salty and also way too soggy. Our friends got steak ($17), porkchops ($15), and fish (also expensive) and the portion size were less than one serving of meat total (all of them were about the size of a deck of cards). It was completely overpriced garbage. Part 4 (Service): Was there any? They were slow and unobservant. He was nice, but he forgot a bunch of our requests both during ordering and after. TL;DR, go to Chuy's."
Quentin S.,"Burnet, TX",19,12,7,3.0,8/9/2014,Food here is excellent.  Beer is awesome.  But the service sucks.   Be ready to wait on your waiter or waitress.  They like to disappear.  Only givin this place 3 stars because service sucked
Matt J.,"Garland, TX",526,70,224,4.0,12/11/2012,"BJ's is one of the few restaurants where I actually want to get dessert. The cookies and cream pizookie is amazing!  The only drawback of this place is the price. If you only get a pizza you can get out for less than $20 but if you go for a pizza, drink, and dessert it is a bit much."
AsYour K.,"Tallahassee, FL",0,32,3,4.0,7/27/2014,"Consistently good every time. This place has lots to choose from and it's one of the best places to eat in the area ... which says a lot for a chain restaurant. It might be my new ""go to"" since there aren't but maybe three local places that serve something other than chicken strips and burgers (non-chain) besides Mexican food."
Angel K.,"College Station, TX",0,17,,5.0,7/26/2016,"wow this place is excellent, little expensive but everything is awesome, try their pizza"
Sarah G.,"Houston, TX",0,16,,4.0,1/25/2015,Great happy hour specials! The avocado egg rolls are definitely the best! I always get the grilled chicken sand which and my boyfriend gets the Jalopeno burger! Recommend them both!! Come here quite often and service has always been great!!
Curtis H.,"Lewisville, TX",8,35,10,1.0,9/14/2014,"As I sit here with my upset wife, after waiting an hour to get our food, her fish was over cooked and dry, my daughter's chicken was dry and they never brought her a side of ranch, my sandwich came with a bunch of wilted and soggy vegetables when I ordered it with no veggies, and my son (his 20yr bday is today) ordered a pizza with no mushrooms and guess what, yes it came with mushrooms. Not a good birthday lunch or any time lunch for that matter. I won't be returning."
Saurav A.,"Bryan, TX",7,14,3,5.0,4/12/2014,"This is a regular destination for me and my friends. The staff is wonderful and pleasant and the service is surprisingly fast considering that we usually placed large orders. The house beers are great, especially the Jeremiah red. Don't miss out on the avocado egg rolls and the pizookes. It's a shame they don't sell the red velvet pizooke  anymore, it was out of this world. You can never go wrong with BJs."
Chrystal S.,"Plano, TX",0,5,,4.0,12/10/2014,"So delicious! I've come to this restaurant many times over my stay in college station and every time has been excellent. Definitely a hopping place on the weekends, so expect to wait some time on a table. But let me tell you, it's worth it!"
