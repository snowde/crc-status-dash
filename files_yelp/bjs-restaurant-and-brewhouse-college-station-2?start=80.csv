Vince U.,"Ennis, TX",4,5,5,4.0,9/21/2014,"Came to College Station to visit my brother and we came in on a totally not-busy Sunday afternoon around 2:30. The very Amy Winehouse-looking host greeted us immediately when we walked through the revolving doors. We sat down and the server was super nice (my brother also works at this location) and he asked for our drink orders and I realized the huge draft selection they have (it's a brewhouse, duh but I forgot) and I orderd the Hopstorm IPA since I'm on an IPA craze right now. He also took our appetizer order, calamari. Drinks came out super fast and he took our main order the second time and also answered menu questions that my mom had. The calamari was fresh and came out in a decent serving size, also had the legs of the squid. Dipped those in ranch and marijuana and it was great. I ordered  another beer (Jeremiah Red) right before the food came out and I decided I liked the first beer better because I'm not too big on malty beers. I ordered the BJ's Favorite Hand-tossed pizza: it came with meatballs, pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, green bell peppers, black olives and white onions. My mom ordered the ribeye steak which she loved because it was cooked thorougly with a tad bit of red, not dry at all, real juicy. My brother ordered thr Shrimp Scampi Pasta ( I tried it and the shrimp were medium sized, juicy and the roma tomatoes and light angel hair pasta all paired well). My pizza was very hearty and meaty, with thicker crust than I had imagined. Kind of reminded me of a thick-crusted supreme pizza from Pizza Hut, if I want to be honest. The only difference is is was more rich than a Pizza Hut pizza would be. Overall, the waiter was quick to respond to our needs, refills were quickly satisfied and we even topped it off with the pazookie as a dessert (it's a 3 cookie sampler, it was amazingly rich in chocolate and caramel and you can pick up to 3 different cookies). Left a nice tip and the hostess wished us a safe goodbye! I recommend this place during the really relaxed atmospheric time we went because my brother says it gets really busy any other time, especially during Aggie game days. Great varied food selection on the menu and amazing beer selection! Loved the IPA choices :)"
Andrew M.,"College Station, TX",2,3,,1.0,9/12/2014,"Arrived and waited for 30 min. It was a good wait bartender was polite in helping me find a palatable beer. The wait was not a problem until we sat down and waited for another 30 minutes before anyone actually spoke to us. Waiter came to us and asked us if we'd been served. Not anymore at this location. Probably not coming back.  I was asked if the restaurant was expensive.  Absolutely, if you consider the time they wasted in my wife's and my life combined.  Too expensive to ever come back. It's not like the restaurant or time management is new.  Figure it out already."
Shaena K.,"College Station, TX",47,28,9,5.0,7/31/2014,"BJs is my boyfriend and I's go to place! We go every week and sit at the bar. Bartenders there are wonderful! Great food, great service and great pazooki :) the pazooki is delicious, ice cream and a warm cookie :)"
A M.,"College Station, TX",4,22,2,2.0,12/30/2012,"Service isn't the best. Ordered an appetizer and it came out after our meals arrived. A manager, or I think manager, came over and apologized but that was it.  I ordered a burger with mayo and when it came, no mayo. No big deal. Just asked for some, but it took awhile for them to get it to me. Burgers were huge.  Overall, not impressed at all. Service sucked and expensive. I might go back and try the pizza, but that's debatable."
Shirley S.,"College Station, TX",17,8,,5.0,7/25/2014,"This restaurant is our absolute favorite place to eat. We tried the take out service yesterday and it was delicious. What sets this restaurant apart from the multitude of other places to eat in College Station is the customer service.  Fast, attentive wait staff with consistently good quality food brings us back time and time again.  They offer ""enlightened"" dishes that are lower in calories for those of us who are watching our food intake. There is nutritional information available on their website which is unusual for this area. Unlike many restaurants in the area, they do take reservations and even have an app that allows you to preorder your food and drink. One thing I really appreciate is that they will seat partial groups. If we are waiting for a friend to arrive, we can be seated and order them a drink so that it's ready when they arrive. Any wonder why there are so many Facebook posts about us eating here?"
Brian A.,"College Station, TX",0,6,,2.0,10/7/2014,"This BJs is having problems!  Food is pretty good but the service is HORRIBLE!  You cannot get in and out in less than 1.5 hours.  Takes forever to get greeted by a host, then forever to get your server, and even longer for the drinks.  You are sitting for a half hour just to place your food order.  If you eat here make sure that you have plenty of time!   With that being said, the last time I was there I tried their Greek gyros off the lite menu and it was really good."
Michael G.,"Bryan, TX",8,2,11,5.0,3/7/2012,"I have not tried one thing on the menu that is not excellent.  Their local beers are my favorite aspect of this place.  If you are new, go up to the bar and ask for sample.  They will gladly direct you to the right beer for you taste."
Laura R.,"Harpenden, United Kingdom",3,50,1,4.0,8/2/2012,"This restaurant has lots of variety (pasta, sandwiches, burgers, pizza, steak, seafood, gluten-free etc) which is helpful when trying to meet everyone's dietary needs and wants. Their appetizers are great, their pizza is good, and so is the service. Great place for families, even though they are known for their beer. I didn't drink so I can't comment on the beer.  Beware, like most places in CS/B, their can be quite the wait during peak hours.  Also there are lots of TV's."
Dalton W.,"Boerne, TX",0,3,,1.0,12/25/2014,"We went to BJs to spend a $50 Visa gift card. We decided to indulge and each of us ordered one of their $10.50 watered down cocktails, which we normally would never pay for. At the end of our meal we were informed that the electronic system BJs has in place won't accept this gift card and that this happens anytime someone tries to use one of that kind. In my opinion, a problem with their system does not constitute a problem for me. If their power had gone down and they couldn't accept credit cards at all I would I be expected to cough up cash before leaving? The manager gave a weak attempt at appearing apologetic and explained that ""thats what you get when dealing with a chain"" since the big decisions aren't up to him. Of course, the flip side of not being a mom and pop place is that you won't be going out of business overnight because you had to comp the equivalent of a valid gift card that you wouldn't accept, and thats what they should have done. I won't be coming back."
Patty G.,"College Station, TX",3,8,4,3.0,4/15/2014,"Great selections of beers which I like.  Food is average lots of choices though.  Hard to have conversations with people, it's pretty loud."
Ava F.,"College Station, TX",4,29,6,4.0,3/23/2014,"This is a regular spot for my boyfriend and I along with his family. It has a good, yet always busy atmosphere. If you need a quiet place don't go here lol. The food is usually always on point, I find myself having to re-ask for something I ordered every time. I have a tree nut allergy and they are great about noting that. The pizookie is really a stand out for me because OMG it's just the best."
Alex M.,"Austin, TX",1,14,1,3.0,12/27/2012,"Pros: Awesome beer selection Knowledgeable bartender Great orange cream soda Good prices Lots of TV's Cons: Hawaiian Mahi Mahi was dry. Might be over-cooked. Didn't taste fresh. :( The fried rice that came with it was a little too oily. The dish can use less oil for the rice; instead, add some sort of sauce maybe a katsu sauce for the fish. It'll definitely bring out the ""hawaiian."" The egg rolls were nice. The wrap was not too thick."
Kyle W.,"Bryan, TX",18,10,7,1.0,9/15/2011,"No one would follow up and check on us....we had to pull a ""Tonya Harding"" and trip the nearest server walking by us to get anything.   (No one was really tripped). Our supposed designated server who was the only one to receive whatever tip we left (which ended up being 8%) spent her whole time attending to a large table without even an apology or telling us she was going to give us to someone else.  We had three servers in 2 hours.   The restaurant was NOT full.    Nice revolving door and nice decor but we left and went to the less attractive Fox and Hound and had excellent service.  That's where I'll return."
Michael P.,"Bryan, TX",74,33,44,3.0,11/14/2011,Food's OK. Clam chowder in bread bowl was excellent. Wife's pasta Toscana with Cajun shrimp was great. The $8.50  Calezone was mediocre and very over priced. Kid friendly prices & meals.
Binky W.,"College Station, TX",7,23,9,2.0,1/3/2014,So the beer was lukewarm and the appetizer plates were dirty as were the napkins. The lettuce wraps had a huge hair in it. I think we're done with this place. It was expensive and nasty. I will give the pizzooki to them. It's yummy....if you don't get a hair in it.
Mary B.,"College Station, TX",0,7,,5.0,5/4/2015,This is by far my favorite restaurant to visit when I have the extra time and money lying around. Both the food and drink selection are more diverse than any other establishment I've had the pleasure of trying during my five years in College Station. The food menu has enough options to satisfy even the pickiest of eaters. My favorite part is the beer menu. Their in in house-brewed options are fantastic and will leave even the most experienced home brewers pleased. Definitely worth a try!
Boyd V.,"Port Aransas, TX",0,3,2,4.0,11/16/2014,"This was exceptional food starting from the Avocado  Egg Rolls (wow) to the Lasagna (wow) and Flatbread to the Pizookie (oh my)!  The operating hours limited our decision to a handful of options but it was a great one!  The service was fine.  They were busy and we had two to assist us and we had no issues at all. Everything that did not come out right away, silverware, extra water, etc but we asked for it and it came back right away.  Definitely recommend and definitely will go back!"
Hunger E.,"Houston, TX",9,376,11,2.0,6/8/2013,"NOTORIETY:  Pizookie dessert FOOD:      Piranha Pale Ale Chili Cheeseburger:  By name, it sounds like it would be good.  In reality, meh.  The chili, made w/ the ale, which was not properly combined w/ other ingredients, so the chili tasted too bitter.  My buddy tried a spoon of the chili & described it like eating medicine.  Enough said.  I was able to finish it as the ~$12 price tag will motivate you to not waste food, as unappetizing as it may be. OVERALL:  BJ's is a pricey restaurant for the quality of food that you get.  I've had the pizza & this burger as entrees, both of which I am not a fan of.  It gets those 2 stars b/c of the pizookie, otherwise I'd give it a 1.  The only other reason I'd imagine going here are for sports, as it has numerous TVs. RECOMMENDATION:  Pizookie TIPS: 1. On your bday, they offer you a free pizookie when you tell your server its your special day."
Grant N.,"Katy, TX",13,99,65,3.0,10/27/2012,"They have good beer and pizza, but most there food is over priced for what you get.  Plus you can normally expect your food to take awhile to get to you once you have placed your order.  Its a good lunch place if you have two hours for lunch."
Carmen H.,"Conroe, TX",0,20,6,1.0,11/2/2014,"Absolutely horrible service! No refills, and then wrong refills-I tried to flag down our waitress when she was cleaning the table next to us and was completely ignored, not once but twice! Luckily a manager saw this occur and came over to help. we were never checked on after the meal came. Never offered a refill-eating with no drink is not fun! I will NEVER return!"
