Sierra C.,"Colorado Springs, CO",100,49,93,4.0,10/20/2017,"We love coming to BJ's for the beer, burgers, and apps! If you like pepperoni pizza, I highly recommend the Pepperoni Extreme Flatbread as an appetizer. They also have a great selection of house beers, my favorite is the Jeremiah Red.  Even on a busy night service is usually prompt. But last time we were here we had to wait for silverware and proper napkins until we were half way done with our meal, not happy about that. Still one of our favorite places to eat and drink. Also important to note that Happy Hour is only in the bar area (which is large)."
Matt H.,"Colorado Springs, CO",151,240,157,3.0,1/4/2018,"This place A-OK.  It's the kind of place you go when everyone in your party can't agree on a place to eat, and you're not feeling adventurous or like trying something new, but you know you want something better than Chili's or Applebee's or TGI Friday's.  BJ's is that - it's a step above a lot of chain restaurants, but not by a whole lot. The prices are high for what they're offering.  The food preparation is rarely consistent.  I'll explain... but I'll try not drag it out. If you order your burger or steak 'medium' (it's a crime to order any piece of red meat over mid-rare, but we'll allow it for this example) you almost certainly won't receive a 'medium' cook - you'll either get it rare or well done, but you certainly won't get it the temperature you ordered.  If you order a salad, especially a house salad or a caesar - maybe ask for the dressing on the side, unless you prefer eating your salad with a spoon.  Yeah, they're usually drenched in that much dressing.  I've ordered burgers there a few times and they're usually under-dressed or just lacking in condiments and unless you've gotten that mid-rare cook you should have requested, that burger is going to seriously need some condiment love.   Don't get me wrong - it's fine; the flavors are usually alright.  And if you're forcing me to pick between BJ's and a multitude of other fast food places I'm choosing BJ's more often than not.  I've always had pretty good service there. I've almost always gone for lunch or business meetings, so maybe the dinner vibe adds something I'm missing, but it's not a place I'm rushing back to by any means. And for what they're charging and their inconsistency in food service, I'm not buying."
Nick R.,"Kalamazoo, MI",63,70,117,3.0,8/20/2017,"Just had drinks here but here's the run down of why this was just a mediocre experience: Drinks were overpriced  Drinks weren't strong enough to warrant being overpriced.  The server didn't know the menu The sever didn't know any of the drinks The server didn't know how to find menu items on her digital order machine All in all, the drinks weren't bad, but it was a hassle to get them and the service wasn't great."
Blue Von B.,"Peyton, CO",2,90,271,4.0,9/24/2017,"Our go to place when we are on the West side of town.  Twice we've been there and twice we have had exceptional service.  The Mojito is the best ever.  And the strawberry brioche - OMG fresh whipped cream.  So if you're shopping and need a nice casual place to unwind for a bit, this is your place.  Enjoy the wonder staff who are very adept in menu and drink selections."
Austin B.,"Centennial, CO",130,24,15,4.0,12/15/2017,Food and service were pretty good. I got Italian and it was okay I wouldn't go if you were looking for just Italian food but it's nice that they have every different kind of food.
Thomas B.,"Longboat Key, FL",133,290,406,5.0,2/22/2017,"Finally !! Excellent service coupled with good food. I didn't realize this was part of a chain and based on how things went you couldn't tell.  Had a server suggested chicken dish which was great. I could of had more, yes it was that good and the portion could have been a bit larger.  The person I was with had a burger that was looking good and was reviewed nicely. If you want a good, affordable night out, this is your place."
Maria D.,"Colorado Springs, CO",33,27,41,5.0,8/13/2017,"Ate here with the family Sunday afternoon. We ordered the Cheese Sticks, Parm Garlic Chicken Wings, Baja Fish Tacos, and the Margarita Flat Bread. The wings were delicious. The fish tacos were yummy, they only way they could be better is if the tortillas were corn! The flatbread was disappointing. It was dry and lacking flavor. Our server offered to remove it from our ticket. My husband ordered another order of wings instead. I can not say enough about the customer service. Our server, Bailey, was absolutely wonderful! Oh, they also have a military discount. We will definitely be back."
Sarah M.,"Boulder, CO",98,211,424,3.0,1/29/2017,"It is your typical chain brewhouse, nothing more. The service was ok, even while busy. We didn't feel forgotten or neglected which is always good. The food was average. I had their avocado rolls which are supposed to be one the the more popular dishes. It was a bit awkward to eat because the roll made the avocados squishy as opposed to when they have a nice, light crisp. The dipping sauce was general but added to what would've been an otherwise completely bland meal.  My friend had the Parmesan chicken and said that it was very dry and over seasoned.  My lemon drop was ok. I had it with Kettle One so the taste was fine but I wouldn't recommend ordering it with the well vodka or it would be much less delicious.  When I used the restroom there was water everywhere! It was gross to the point of weird as if someone showered in the sink. There was toilet paper strewn all over in the stalls and one paper towel dispenser was empty.  We were short a silverware setting and had to wait for a while to get a third setting.  Overall, it was exactly what I expected. A cliche' brew pub with little originality and bland flavors.  I'm definitely missing the allure of why people would wait in line to eat here."
David S.,"Denver, CO",0,14,,4.0,10/15/2017,"I ate here the other day and being from out of town you never know what to expect. Not sure why this place does not get better reviews. In short, much of the pasta and food is homemade from scratch, the food is fresh, and delicious, portions are generous and the service was solid."
Wendy W.,"Peyton, CO",47,79,4,3.0,4/22/2017,"For starters, wait staff was far from impressive.  We waited for everything and not your typical wait either.   : (   Totally bummed with the quality of the food, even the ranch dressing was sub-par. Next time I'm craving a burger I'm definitely heading over to five guys!"
Angie M.,"Colorado Springs, CO",344,3,,1.0,12/9/2017,"I love this restaurant it's our favorite.  So because of that wanted to book my works Christmas party there so I called I start talking girl says ""your breaking up"" and just hangs up instead of giving me a second. I go outside. Call again.  She says ""okay great let me transfer you to a manager and instead hangs up"". So I call again and a different girl answers and I said I was hung up on I'm trying to reserve something and before I could finish the sentence she said ""well yeah our managers won't talk to you during a dinner rush so you can call later or tomorrow"" and just hung up on me AGAIN.   I mean to say they ""WONT"" talk to me   Could have been said nicer and the first girl instead of transferring me just hangs up? And then makes another girl answer I mean they stand right next to eachother.     So either manager said no won't talk and she just hung up or she took it upon herself to do that    I would have been fine if someone explained the managers are to busy with a dinner rush although I doubt they can't take 3 minutes to look at a date and time and say yes or no if available but it was the way the hostess handled it. Equally as rude as one another.   So since I was a simple inconvenience during ""dinner rush"" for a little phone call I figure a party of 20 would be even more of an inconvenience and decided not to call Back and book it which was extremely disappointing as most of the staff hadn't tried it before and was excited with how I  Raved  about the food and atmosphere   We will Be next door at bonefish with a $1500 tab and hefty tip. So was their loss but also mine as I will think twice about returning due to the lack of customer service. Positive and good Experience goes a long way at restaurants but so does  Rudeness and lack of customer care.  I was a manager at a restaurant for a long time and I would literally let a hostess go for treating someone like that hanging up 3 TIMES and admitting the managers (plural so clearly should have time)  just simply doesn't have time for u right now.    Which is potentially because they were dealing with other complaints at that rate.     Gave 2 stars cause my lunch just last Sunday (and most sundays).   was great and the waitress was awesome as well"
Mary G.,"Frederick, CO",0,6,,5.0,10/7/2017,"I am very surprised by the mediocre reviews. This is one of the best restaurants we have been to since moving to Colorado 4 1/2 years ago. The service and food was fantastic! It is a bit more expensive than where we usually dine out, but it is so worth the extra $3-$5 a plate. The Pizookia dessert is wonderful and we rarely have dessert when dining out. We took advantage because it was only $3. It was well worth the add on to the bill. I can't say enough about how great this place was. I had the Parmesan crusted chicken, which was delicious. My husband had the fish and chips, and that was the best fish he has had at a restaurant thus far. We will definitely be back."
Megan R.,"Colorado Springs, CO",44,3,,1.0,2/5/2017,"This is my second time reviewing this restaurant and all I have to say is WTF is wrong with the wait staff? Rude, incompetent, impatient and all around a buzz kill. Hire people with better people skills :) Oh and maybe hire a hostess so your guests aren't waiting 10 minutes at the front with no acknowledgement :) K thankssssss Sincerely,  A paying customer"
Claudia S.,"Henderson, NV",61,66,148,3.0,8/17/2016,"First time at this location, although I've been too this restaurant chain many times. Their food usually doesn't disappoint I know what to expect and the  pizookies are divine .  On this visit customer service was great. I also like taking advantage of any discounts you can get if you have their rewards program and since it was a weekday they also had other specials.  I got half off -$12.48 on the pizza with the rewards program and $1.00 off the beer and $2.00 off appetizer with the special of the day. On this visit we ordered a brewhouse blonde, lemonade, crispy calamari, large bj's favorite pizza,  2 chocolate chunk pizookie.  The calamari was a little too crispy but still edible. Everything else was as it should be delicious. If you find some of this food pricey again check for any discounts you can get before going. Definitely try dessert and order a pizookie. Its a hot out of the oven cookie topped with ice cream that won't disappoint."
Drew S.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,53,,4.0,4/22/2017,Ate here when it first opened and wasn't very impressed by the food or service. Ate here 2 weeks ago and my opinion has changed.  Both food and service were incredible! We'll be back and eager to try other menu items.
Krystal L.,"Temple, TX",1,2,2,2.0,10/21/2016,"We love this place. Food is usually great and we don't mind paying for great food. Tonight, we're tired and just want to eat something that'll hit the spot and rest.  I ordered online, almost 60 dollars worth of food, and get this. Come on. Just because the order is to-go doesn't mean it has to be done so sloppy and ridiculous.  My kid didn't get bread with her food, I ordered a bowl of soup and got a cup, literally measures, and my husbands steak is practically bleeding after requesting it well done. Then the cherry on top, called to talk to the manager and it just rang and rang and rang. Definitely not happy tonight with BJ's."
Lynn C.,"Fort Myers, FL",0,62,6,4.0,8/23/2017,Our family went in for a school fund raiser tonight and were very pleased. The food was good and the service was excellent. They are very family friendly and really went out of their way to make the kids happy.  We appreciate them supporting the school and will  return soon.
Chad J.,"Colorado Springs, CO",50,84,274,4.0,1/12/2017,"I have been here several times for both lunch and dinner. I keep coming back so overall, it's a worthwhile place to checkout. During my last visit the place was packed with a 20 minute wait. Even being busy the service was excellent. Drinks came fast. Our dinner came out at a reasonable pace. All four of us liked the food. I also like their iPhone app. I check-in before I head over and I pay with Apple Pay right on my phone."
Mellisa W.,"Highland, Denver, CO",2,32,25,5.0,5/20/2016,Wow I'm so pissed off. So I ordered the ahi tuna - and it had cilantro in it and I told the waitress (who was very nice) that I hated cilantro and asked if I could get a new salad. She said yes. (I tired in vain to pick out the cilantro but - it's all green!!) She left the plate there - and I used to work at a restaurant and I know that they toss everything that is returned and I didn't want to waste it so I ate the tuna part The restaurant could have replaced just the salad part or tell me AHEAD of time that I would be charged twice... You cannot just tell someone you will replace it and then charge them - that's robbery! I understand that Bc I got double serving of tuna - but they should have told me ahead of time I would be charged extra. I would've been ok with getting just half a plate replaced with salad and no tuna!!! The food was fine - great even. Edit: Jason their manager knew who I was the moment he picked up the phone (called right after). He did apologize and drop the charge. I appreciate being heard. I want to applaud Brittany for relaying my disappointment. Again - I'm a fair person. I know I finished the tuna and returned half of the salad and I ended up with a whole new salad (with tuna) - but I only finished the tuna because I'd hate to waste food. Had they told me I would be charged extra - I might have either been ok with it or just ended my meal there. I was only upset because I was charged without being told ahead of time. Thank you for adjusting this.
Keoki S.,"Woodbridge, VA",1,76,47,1.0,1/15/2017,"So my wife and I came here Friday night with a friend as we just moved back to the area. It was one of the best meals we have had in along time.  It was so good that we decided to order pizza as we were so impressed just two days ago for family movie night. We got the Mediterranean again as it was incredible on Friday, and the Spicy Hawaiian. Both were a let down and Pizza Hut would have been a better choice and would not have costed me $45 for two mediums."
J B.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,209,110,2.0,12/19/2016,"We've been here twice in the last two weeks.  A Christmas party, hard to really review.  Today, the service was good, but the food not good.  The avocado rolls were clearly made from yesterday's avocados.  Brown tasteless yuck in a deep fried yuck.   The rest of the food was adequate but just okay."
Scarlet O.,"Colorado Springs, CO",15,30,3,1.0,7/12/2017,"222 REVIEWS with a 2 star Average???? hahaha. this place is a joke. DO NOT EVER ORDER A DRINK FROM HERE! Trust me. After a super long day with only a bagel at 8 am, after work at 5 I ordered the ""ULTIMATE long island"" - there might have been 1 shot of alcohol in this drink...and I paid $11!? Like seriously, this place needs upper management because if the bartender can't even get a long island right... there's some problems. I thought BJ's would be a great place to unwind after work with my girlfriends, have a drink, watch a game...ect. But none of us will ever be back. Oh! and I was immediately angry after being seated because I cleaned the dirty booth seat with my bum because apparently if there's wet and crunchy stuff they don't wipe the seats down. Like...come onnnnn."
Tristan G.,"Colorado Springs, CO",4,83,143,5.0,5/3/2017,"It's been almost half a year since I've given another review of BJ's. I've been there a handful of times since then, for lunch, dinner and desert. As always the service is top notch and the best in the Springs and among many other places. I was recommended Double bone in pork chops with prime rib dip by the Executive Kitchen Manager, Zak. The waitress offered plenty of meals, but my colleagues were besides themselves and needed more time to decide. I couldn't blame them, this menu is huge and it's truly amazing with the amount of people that dine here and are able too cook it to perfection in a timely manner. A bit off topic, but deserves the spot light. Zak, had been visiting tables and talking with guests and I noticed him from the last time, but couldn't remember his name for the life of me. Luckily, he reintroduced himself and asked if there was anything we needed help with, asked us about our evening and recommended that beautifully cooked double bone and 2/4 of us ordered it. The other two were ""vegans"" lol but without any hesitation when I gave them a hard time about it (friends of mine) Zak recommended a few key dishes and when they came out I knew what I would get next time. Lastly, he stopped by again to ask how it was and over light conversation we found out about the catering option. Needless to say we brought it to our work center and will strongly recommend booking with BJ's. If not, I will myself for the volunteer event in the summer. Don't bother debating on coming here.....just come here you will be beyond satisfied. Just call ahead and make reservations during busy times when most people are at lunch or off work. If not, wait no matter how long the wait is because there isn't a better establishment.  Superb job BJ's  and thank you again Zak and our waitress who politely asked not to be named. =) 10/10"
Christina T.,"Colorado Springs, CO",2,21,8,5.0,5/19/2017,"I discovered this place through a few friends who had dined here before. We now have our annual Christmas get togethers here. Service is always speedy, servers friendly and good amazing. We love the cocktails and pizookies (sp) from their dessert menu.  It's always hopping so we know our laughter and conversation won't bother our dining neighbors."
Debbie B.,"Colorado Springs, CO",35,201,45,4.0,3/16/2015,"First visit: The only thing really impressive here was the pork green chili fries we got. The pizza, coke and pizooki weren't as good as I remember in CA. The cookies were raw. The pizza wasn't crispy enough on the outside. Overall not worth the money. Second: We came on father's day, sat outside and were very impressed. The beignet dessert was nummy. And so was the bbq chicken salad. Had good nice service today."
Karla M.,"Lompoc, CA",0,14,,5.0,7/11/2017,"I'm visiting from out of town. My family and I had dinner at BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse this past Sunday. The atmosphere was pleasant, food was great, and our waitress was amazing. I only regret I didn't get her name. I will definitely go back to BJ's the next time I come to Colorado Springs!"
Chris G.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,11,8,2.0,2/5/2017,"So I went here on a Sunday. In the afternoon so there wouldn't that many people there. We were put on a wait list and the hostess forgot about us. After we said something, the new hostess said the old one left and she didn't know about us. Then we were seated. 15 minutes.. no one. My wife asked the the hostess, she said sorry and would get our drink order but said she couldn't order alcohol? I guess she was under 21? She said sorry and said she didn't tell the waitress. Food and beer and great. Service was horrible. This place has gone downhill since the last time I was there. Too bad because I have always enjoyed here."
Chuck D.,"Colorado Springs, CO",14,168,48,3.0,8/20/2016,"#garlicbreadsquad  just stopped in one evening for a quick bite.  Very spacious nice indoor seating kind of dark.  Looking over the menu I got the California club sandwich. Also got the crispy fries Order was up pretty fast.  Fries were good.  CA club served on garlic bread.  I liked it. Chicken didn't seem to be of overwhelming good quality.  It was Just ok.  The piece of lettuce clearly had some brown spots on the edges which could of been prevented. Had to do it myself though.  Got a draft root beer, I liked it. Still not amazing."
Sonja J.,"Colorado Springs, CO",153,23,4,5.0,2/6/2017,"We got there at 8, myself and my friend already stepped inside when my other friend was like, ""they're closing"" per the sign on the door. The very kind folks that owned the place ushered us on in anyway and man the food was amazing, as was the service!"
Kerri D.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,11,,1.0,12/20/2016,"Horrid service In the bar for half an hour Sitting at a dirty table Waitress comes over and says that it will be a while before she can clean the table... Asked another waiter for a Bev nap to do it myself... if my friend wasn't driving 40 min to meet me, I'd be gone!"
Tim H.,"Colorado Springs, CO",30,368,89,2.0,11/28/2015,"I'm going to think about coming here again.  Wife-unit and I desperately needed to get some couple time, her 92 year-old mother lives with us and sometimes we just need a break. So we get here.  I order a small steak which comes with two sides and I decide on both a soup and the small wedge salad.  They come together.  I'm just getting into the salad and my steak arrives.  I pass my tortilla soup over to my wife-unit so she has something to work on while I finish my salad, and either the soup or my steak is going to get cold.  Both soup and salad were delicious, however.   Wife-unit has a few spoonfuls of soup and her veggieburger arrives.  She bites into it and asks me to touch her patty.  It is cold.  I don't mean not-hot cold, or barely warm cold.  I mean iceberg-lettuce-fresh-out-of-the-refrigerator-cold.  Our server comes by, wife-unit asks her to touch patty,  which she does, says ""Gross!"" and hurries away with burger.  When a fresh, hot meal returns, I have, of course, finished my meal entirely.  Server points out that ""Chef personally cooked this.""  It was hot and nice.  I should point out that my steak was not great, smallish, a little tough and kind of an ugly shape. Frankly, when our bill came I was surprised to see that burger wasn't comped or that we weren't offered a dessert or something after such a major screw-up.  I would not have been surprised if our entire meal wasn't comped, actually. When I sat down to write this review my last review popped up.  It started out ""I'm giving one of our favorite places only four stars because of inconsistent service and to a lessor degree, food.""  So I had forgotten that BJ's had been slipping. Oh, the Manhattan on the rocks I ordered appeared pale and tasted different, I wondered if it had come up short in the glass and been topped off with club soda.  Tasted okay, just not like a Manhattan. 3/25/2017 Re-visited BJ's and found it was still in a downward spiral.  I ordered a Beefeater martini, server returned saying that they no longer stock Beefeater gin.  I'm sorry, but any bar worth its salt has Beefeater on hand.  I had a Long Island Ice Tea, and it was not as good as it has been in the past.  Red Robin and Famous Dave's both have far superior Long Island Ice Tea.  I think I will forgo mixed drinks here in future and either skip them altogether or get a beer. Frankly, I wouldn't have chosen to come here, but it was suggested by one in our party of four.  It is a shame, they used to be one of our favorite places.  I will be trying one in LA probably, and if memory serves, it was damn good in every aspect.  Here's hoping."
Sam A.,"Monument, CO",0,745,216,3.0,2/21/2017,"Greeting and seating very lacking in speed!  We had great table service from James.   I  still think food is lacking compared to other places.  Flatbread Nachos for $10, were fair, would not order again.  Chicken tenders were good, large BJ Deep dish pizza was cool and slightly greasy, fries just ok.  Person who delivered pizza just plopped it on the table for us to serve ourselves the first slices.  Full bar with and Pepsi products for $2.95."
Nathaniel P.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,15,,3.0,4/14/2017,"Ehhh... The food wasn't anything special; the spaghetti & meatballs were WAY too spicy. The meatballs were too soft in texture, but the waiter, at least, was very nice to us. After complaining about how small my glass of orange juice was, he offered to throw in a complimentary refill. The overall experience was not bad...at all, but, The food was nothing remarkable."
James H.,"Layton, UT",10,355,138,2.0,9/7/2015,So add-on to my previous review. Food and menu are pretty good... Beer selection is great. Literally for the last 45 min or so my waitress just forgot I existed. Had to download the smartphone app & pay my bill online just to leave. Nullified my previous post.  Johnny's Navaho Hogan up the street has better service.
Diana G.,"Chicago, IL",245,1024,3790,3.0,10/27/2014,"Yes, we are from Chicago and eating pizza in Colorado. We ordered calamari, sampler platter and their BJ Special. Calamari was a little overdone. Sampler platter was good. BJ Pizza was deep dish, but we know that it's not. It's more of a pan pizza. I didn't mind the crust as it reminded me of Sarpino's and the ingredients were fresh. I think I would've gave them 4 stars, but there was like no sauce on the pizza."
Rome T.,"Colorado Springs, CO",34,67,77,2.0,6/13/2015,Visited this place today and was not impressed at all. Our food took almost an hour to get then when they finally arrived the appetizers and main dishes all arrived the same time and was missing one of the main dishes. It seems they may have been understaffed as we noticed our waiter was serving all the tables outside and there was about 10. Definitely poor staff planning imo. Our waiter did his best and kept apologizing and gave us a discount at the end. Not his fault though.  In regards to the food..it was bleh. Pizza mostly dough..chicken wings was lacking flavor. Definitely coming back never.
James Z.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,10,,1.0,7/15/2017,"After years of being a solid choice their service (lack of)  and mismanagement have hit all time lows.  Went for lunch on Saturday afternoon and went to sit at the bar. Only five other patrons. Inside of that after more than 12 minutes we were neither greated nor asked about our drink order.  On the way out talked with Brian the manager and he could not have cared less. His response was not an apology rather it was ""oh okay"".  This is the second negative experience within 7 weeks.  Won't be back.  We once were there 3-4 times per month.   Too many better choices, even in the same shopping plaza."
Nancy H.,"Colorado Springs, CO",3,30,121,5.0,6/10/2016,"Great today!  For a quick, light lunch (and your boss doesn't care), order a tomato/mozzarella salad and glass of Pino Griego.  The salad isn't on the menu. but it is wonderful...chilled plate, lots of everything for $3.50.  They offer two Pino Griego, but the cheaper one, to me, is perfect!  My server today was Alex and she was outstanding!!!"
Suelo R.,"Colorado Springs, CO",102,23,,1.0,8/8/2016,"We got here at 545pm waited 20 minutes to be seated, after we ordered calamari and it was dry like it had been under lamps for ever.  Here we are its 7 pm and no food yet, we had to ask the waiter for napkins oh and btw we didn't get plates for our appetizers.  I seriously will never come here again and the restaurant is no where near being full.  In fact back room is nearly empty..  So disappointed well got up to speak to manager instead of asking for my vip or if I had any coupons lol he gave us a appetizer which I had a coupon for anyways and they brought wrong food smh then didn't even ask if we needed to go boxes WORSE BJs ever!!!  Save your money go else where this was just awful"
Kara Z.,"Colorado Springs, CO",115,604,227,5.0,2/19/2015,"OK. Someone gave us a gift card to BJ's and when I looked up the reviews on line I was hesitant to try it because of how negative the reviews were. But we had dinner at BJ's on Tuesday night and really loved it. We were greeted warmly as we entered the restaurant (though I must say that parking really is a pain) and our server Ashley B was great. She checked in with us throughout the meal- always at the right time- and we never wondered where she was or if she would be back. She explained things well and gave us time with the menu since it is pretty extensive. They have a lot of beer and cider options which was kind of fun; this will definitely be a place we'll bring family who visit us because they love this type of place and those kinds of drink menus.  The place was really busy but we didn't have to wait long for anything. My husband got a Black Bleu Burger and he chose the skinny fries (which I ate half of- they were soooo good!) and he really liked it. I got the Honey Crisp Chicken Salad (which I know has a crazy amount of calories- I looked it up online- yikes- but I did ask for half of the dressing than they usually use so I'm pretending that made a huge difference). I loved the salad! We are new to Colorado and I have been struggling to find a salad that I really love. This one tasted delicious and I will order the exact same thing next time.  We were enthralled by their dessert menu and knew we would be ordering dessert. Since it was Fat Tuesday we had to order the Beignet and it was really great- warm and tasty with delicious strawberry drizzle, fresh strawberries and whipped cream. We both really liked it. We also got a mini Triple Chocolate Pizookie which was incredible. It's a chocolate cookie baked in a little dish that is warm so it was crispy on the outside and gooey in the middle, topped with Ghirardelli chocolate ice cream and mini chocolate chips. Definitely a perfect dessert for a die-hard chocolate lover. Wow. They also have a 3 Mini Pizookie dessert where you can pick three different ones- their peanut butter s'more one looks amazing too.  We told Ashley it was our first time at the restaurant and how much we enjoyed everything we had (we ate every single bite of everything) and she told us about the rewards program they have and went and got us the information and explained how it works. On our way out she caught us and said the program had some new ways to sign up so she wanted to explain that to us so we weren't confused- we were impressed with the extra effort she took.  Overall we didn't understand the negative reviews. Everyone was pleasant, Ashley gave us great service, and the food was delicious. The restaurant wasn't too loud either which was refreshing and a little surprising. We will most definitely be back!"
