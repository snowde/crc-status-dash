Sarah N.,"Colorado Springs, CO",88,13,,3.0,9/10/2014,"Food is always pretty good but the few times I've been here service was lacking. Especially if you sit in the bar area they take forever! Also some things are a bit ridiculous on price for what you get. Overall a nice atmosphere and good food though, just never go here if you're in a hurry"
Heather G.,"Colorado Springs, CO",45,298,23,5.0,3/31/2012,My husband and I love this place. We have eaten here several times now and have no complaints. they have a great beer selection as well as mixed drinks. I am not a drinker so I enjoy their homemade sodas. Last night I had the Orange Creme!! Talk about dessert in a cup. It was awesome. The food is always outstanding as well and the staff super friendly and helpful! I can't wait to go back!
Kevin R.,"Ventura, CA",1,29,1,2.0,6/18/2011,"As a sponsored Yelp! business, Bj's has the ability to delete a number of low reviews from their page by paying Yelp!. This is the only way that they have the artificially high star number. Like stated previously, BJ's has greasy overpriced food and is nowhere near a place like the Cheesecake factory in quality. Why do they need 200 menu items where most are only mediocre? Their pizza falls right in line here too-mediocre at best. And their prized pizooki....tastes like a premade frozen cookie with artificial ingredients. Oh well the interior and beer are nice."
Adrienn H.,"Colorado Springs, CO",42,65,15,3.0,2/24/2012,"It wasn't the best food I have ever had, but for the price it was pretty good.  I usually don't do franchise places, but of the many I have gone to this one was better than most.  They have an extensive menu and what they have is done pretty well.  Like most franchise places they are high in sodium, so be careful.  I especially enjoyed their salad choices!  I will order from here again!"
Stephen G.,"Denver, CO",26,44,,4.0,8/17/2011,Wonderful beer and a fantastic spicy tomato sauce. The service is very hit or miss. You'll either end up with a rockstar or someone who can't even spell refill. Best piece of advice- end the meal with a pazooki
karen w.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,5,,2.0,5/31/2014,"I have been to BJ's many times...in fact twice this week. I am so sorry I recommended my daughter order the Cobb Salad. For 12.95 it was a head of shredded iceberg lettuce, a few flecks of bacon( maybe one sixth of a strip of bacon, a few tiny pieces of tomatoes and some tiny cubes of a horrible, cheap turkey filled with fat. I have many good entrees at this place but this was seriously by far the worst Cobb salad I have ever had. I'm an empty nester so we eat out all the time. I feel like I got ripped off in the worst way paying for this head of lettuce with not much else."
Food C.,"Colorado Springs, CO",9,124,,4.0,3/21/2011,"We love BJ's.  We try to get their at off-times to avoid the wait, but plan to use their call-ahead seating.  The food & service is always very good.  I don't agree w/the one review that bringing BJ's to Colorado Springs ""a small town"" is fake.  We may have a small-town feel, but we are over 600,000 people.  Only negative comment is that they serve their red wine a bit on the warm side. I just sent an email to their main site & they have responded to me before, so I'm sure they will take care of this wine issue."
Nick B.,"San Diego, CA",471,422,327,5.0,7/15/2011,"My wife and I have never had a bad experience here. My absolute favorite is their Mediterranean pizza which I have fallen in love with and crave on a regular basis. We were regulars at the BJ's in Tucson, AZ and loved their beer selection as well as extensive menu. Nothing too bad can be had at this place unless it's something that we have not tried. But it is a MUST to try their Mediterranean pizza."
Sarah P.,"Colorado Springs, CO",1,285,12,4.0,8/3/2011,"My husband and I ate at BJ's for date night and were pretty pleased. We started with the large sampler of EIGHT beers! I wish the waiter would have told it it had eight samples! They were larger than we were used to and we couldn't drink them all. What light weights! I ordered off their light menu and really enjoyed my Cajun fish. The menu items weren't super unique, but still enjoyable."
Nick G.,"Fountain, CO",30,100,,4.0,12/13/2010,"Loved the beer, loved the food, the service was here and there.  They were very busy, so I cut some slack, but everything was great and I will be returning!!!!!!"
Bill W.,"Colorado Springs, CO",19,22,1,5.0,9/23/2013,"Great service.  Stopped in after seeing ""Seven Guitars"" at Theatreworks...on the UCCS campus.  Waitress was quick, one of the other servers stopped to chat with us, and we felt very comfortable with the staff.  They have an extensive exotic drink menu, and will mix up custom orders quickly.  Food is good...had the ""Sweet Pig"" pizza, also known as Hawaiian (pineapple and ham).  All around great experience."
Aaron F.,"Colorado Springs, CO",3,3,1,5.0,12/24/2011,"Great beer, good food, fun times!"
Jimmy W.,"Colorado Springs, CO",61,152,1,4.0,3/6/2011,"Good food (veggie options!), a good beer selection, and a very friendly server! This place is great. I was here with a group of about 15 coworkers. We had a reservation so we were sat immediately at a nice big table without feeling like we were crowding out the people around us. We had ample help getting our beer ordered and brought out to the table as well as ordering food, running food to the table, etc. Nice team work, guys! The beers were tasty and the food was rich and flavorful. My only regret is that I didn't save room for a pizookie."
Courtney E.,"Colorado Springs, CO",7,3,,5.0,3/5/2012,"Before my husband came home from being away from a very long month, my friend Jamie took me & another friend to BJ's for lunch. I definitely was not expecting what I expected to see when walking into the restaurant for the first time.  This huge restaurant with plenty of seating inside & a patio for the summer, a huge variety of food and drinks, and a fun atmosphere with tv's all around to watch different sports. As soon as I found my friends I sat down to order me a drink, soda of course. But the alcohol menu is huge. This would be the kind of place a group of sports fans would go to watch a good game, have a great burger & some awesome drinks. For lunch I ordered a burger, with thin cut fries. When I got my food I was surprised by the size of the burger. It was big, and delicious. The fries were the best fries I have tasted in a while. I couldn't have asked for a better meal! It was so good! And for dessert we ordered pizookies! A yummy chocolate cookies with ice cream and for which one you decide to order you will get a little chocolate candy on the side of it. They have a few different kinds of pizookies! They are the best. I was so excited to bring my husband here to celebrate getting our new place. So this weekend we met my family for lunch. Everyone was pleased with the service. Our waitress was the best. And the food was approved by the family & my husband. We will definitely be going back to BJ's again! :)"
Sheila H.,"Colorado Springs, CO",95,30,16,5.0,2/24/2011,"The food was awesome! Best roast beef dip I've ever had. The only place, besides home, that we found good jambalaya!"
Jeff H.,"Mount Vernon, TX",0,16,1,4.0,1/17/2012,Not a big fan of chain restaurants but their potroast is very good! I also like to watch football there.
Victoria V.,"Portland, OR",250,61,31,4.0,1/15/2013,"This place is nostalgic for me because it was one of my college hangouts back home in Cali.  It is a chain, however, I was so happy to see that it is in my new home, Colorado Springs.  They have a very large menu similar to The Cheesecake Factory.  A little bit of everything.  Their pizza is thick crust, but not the true Chicago style.  If you're looking for that you will be disappointed.  Awesome salads, huge loaded potatoes and lots of other choices if you aren't in the mood for pizza. And of course you can't leave without trying a pizookie.  They' add seasonal menu items which is a nice change every once in a while.  Not really a beer drinker, but my friends have always been a fan.  They have a gluten free menu and take their prep seriously and will even take you back to see the prep area.  Since I'm a new gluten free now I was happy to see that.  The GF pizza is the best I've had.  Even better than the Ritz Carlton (CA).  I never feel deprived because of my new diet when I come here.  Also a cool place to chill and watch a game."
Lana K.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,2,,2.0,9/12/2010,"Maybe it's because the place is newly opened, but service here is absurd. After no one had been to our table for even drink orders, someone finally took our orders and found our server, only to have her return with our drinks and a put-out attitude. And she still messed up part of the order. The food is very good, love the fries, and though I didn't have their beer this time, my friends liked Oktoberfest. There's good beer at better breweries here so skip this place until they get it together."
Mongoose K.,"Aurora, CO",8,17,2,3.0,1/27/2013,"Well time to rate one of the newer chain restaurants in the Springs.  This was my fifth visit.  Most of the kinks have been worked out and service is like Russian Roulette-- thankfully we had a great server today.  If you have never been to a BJ's it has a familiar set-up-- large bar area, a large seating area and outdoor seating.  There is little separation so the words ""vibrant"" and ""buzz"" may equal loud;).  I have had lunch specials here and I have  agree with Cobra K that they are nicely done with the same caveat that $2.95 beverages seem the same chain norm;). In past visits I had the calamari and it was surprisingly well done.  One note of caution the menu is rather large from tapas to pizza then salads and sandwiches, burgers, steaks, pasta, etc.  Nothing so far has been off the chain-- very safe and identifiable choices.  That is not to say the food is terrible-- none of my choices sucked but nothing so far has been ""wow"". Beer selection is varied and I prefer the in-house cream soda over their root beer and it is a full bar so mixed drinks and wine are also available.  So to sum up-- some people like Champps over Fox and the Hound-- BJ's is more of the same but is executed a little better."
Sylvia A.,"Fountain, CO",10,11,6,4.0,7/29/2012,Rated wrong place I'm going here next week because I hear it is a 4 star.
