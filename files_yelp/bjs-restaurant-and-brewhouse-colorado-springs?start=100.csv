Robert R.,"Colorado Springs, CO",65,606,38,5.0,5/2/2012,"This is one of our go to places in town for the fam.  Always great food and great service.  Kids love eating here because everyone can find something on the menu that they like. Beers are better than average for a chain brewpub and they have a great bar area.   Only downside is the noise, but its true of all these format restaurants, so no points off for that."
Tim C.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,2,,1.0,6/27/2016,"This used to be a really great place to eat.  The pricing was a little high, but the food quality was excellent and the wait staff was professional.  The past few years, this place has really started to take a big dive.  Like all other restaurants, I have a staple food item at each and in this case it was the balsamic glazed chicken with mashed potatoes.  The first time things started to go south when my food came, the mashed potatoes were cold, the fried onions were missing and the sauteed onions were ice cold (literally must have come out of the freezer).  The next visit, same issue with the sauteed onions.  So I decided to change to the Santa Fe salad.  Now the meal comes without the chicken and when they fixed it, had only a few pieces of chicken included.  The manager stopped out to offer a free desert, should've offered the desert plus taken the price of the entree off. The waitress took her time in assisting us and we waiting a half hour for her to process our check at the end of the meal, in fact we had to track her down to pay.   I am extremely disappointed in how far this establishment has tanked.  Won't be going back ever again.  There are too many other restaurants available in our area without the constant issues. I would highly suggest going somewhere else!"
Julie J.,"Stone Mountain, GA",0,7,,1.0,6/20/2016,"Service was horrible. The manager was rude in addition to being dishonest as to why so many groups that came in after ours were seated so quickly, some, immediately. That's taking VIP to an extreme. After more than an hour wait and our intelligence insulted, we walked out."
Itzel S.,"Oxnard, CA",0,6,4,5.0,8/3/2015,"Went last night for dinner with my husband & little one we loved it ! All the staff is so friendly & our waiter was the sweetest! Everything was delicious we got chicken wings for appetizer there so crispy and yummy, as an entree I got half rack with broccoli & mashed potatoes so good & creamy. My husband got chicken alfredo he liked it but there wasn't enough chicken only 2 little small pieces and the waiter noticed he stopped eating asked if he wanted a to go box he said no there wasn't enough chicken so she was nice enough to go put in more chicken and put it in a to go box never made a bad gesture & dessert we got a white chocolate macadamia pazookie looooooooooved it!"
Ryan M.,"Vilonia, AR",2,36,4,5.0,7/31/2015,"We came in on July 3rd and the place was completely dead. But the layout of the restaurant was nice and very elegant. We were seated promptly and given options for drinks. Although slightly higher priced than a typical bar/eatery, it was definitely worth every penny. The food was delivered very quickly (probably due to the lack of other patrons) and the house brews we tried were amazing! I am definitely a fan of theirs now and will be back!"
Jo E.,"Colorado Springs, CO",62,37,86,4.0,7/22/2015,This place is always busy.  The only bad part of going here is waiting for a table.  I don't like to wait. You can call ahead but I always forget. Good food. The buffalo burger is one of my favorites.  Pizza is pretty good and the cookie and ice cream dessert is YUMMMM
Jayme P.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,6,2,5.0,6/13/2016,"I have been here twice in the last five days and felt I needed to give the praise deserved. While I have been here several times in the past, and have never been disappointed, I was most impressed these last couple times due to an employee. When I ate there Wednesday with a coworker, Tiger was our waitress and was beyond friendly and engaging. I came with my family Saturday and she was the hostess and again was greeted with her smile and great personality. My husband left his phone there and she went above and beyond to find it and ensure we got it back. Thanks you BJs for your amazing food and service, we will be back (again and again)."
Mary C.,"Monument, CO",23,30,2,5.0,3/17/2015,"Fantastic restaurant, fun place for lunch with a big crowd or just a couple.  And  they have a huge variety!"
Cassandra F.,"Aurora, CO",86,782,62,4.0,6/29/2012,"Came down from Denver to go to a gathering here and ended up really liking it. The food was great, my husband enjoyed the beer (I'll have to judge that after I'm not pregnant :P ), and the service was really good. We had a fairly large party, 14 or so I think, and they had no problem accommodating us and serving quickly and well.  I gave their non-alcoholic blood orange drink a try too, I thought it was pretty good, but my husband thought it was overly sweet. Maybe it's a girl thing. The pizza appetizer I had was great, and the wings were really good too.  I'll have to give one of the locations up in Denver a try soon."
Chris R.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,17,,4.0,4/24/2016,"We enjoy BJ's for three important reasons. First because the food is of consistently good quality. Second, because the BJ's Rewards program always has something good for returning customers. And third, it's a nice atmosphere."
Carroll H.,"Colorado Springs, CO",29,51,227,5.0,6/12/2015,"BJ s has always been a favorite place to go dine, but for a while, things had not been as great, but they have changed their service style team work to the max is happening .... It is time you should try them again, above and beyond amazingly great, BrIttany was our main server, and I say that because we had five others bringing food, drinks, and so on, I love a restaurant that has great team work and flowing service and smiles, food always A +++++ but whatever changes have been made, it is working. Every table servered quickly and by many working together. excellent. manager on the floor several times, another plus, but as we were leaving and it was extremely crowded now, people, Waiting to be seated, a hostess had a tray full of pizza slices and handing out to those waiting. BJ s. You have aced it. Everyone time to go back to your old favorite, you will be glad you did!"
Monica T.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,9,,4.0,6/11/2015,"I've been to a few different locations, as far as I've noticed the host has always been gracious and seated us in a timely manner. The dinning area has been kept clean and the bus boys always came out to clear tables quickly.  When I got my order it was as expected and the waiters didn't keep you waiting."
Keebler F.,"Pueblo, CO",0,127,17,5.0,4/19/2015,Great lunch menu. The pizza is awesone and the wait time to receive your food is within 20 minites.
Hailey D.,"Monument, CO",22,176,11,3.0,3/18/2015,"I stayed at a bar, cause I went in during the lunch hour and didn't want to wait. Their food looked pretty good, though I didn't order any food. I might try next time. I was there to have a beer while doing homework. It seems like a good place to watch sports while having a beer or two with a few friends."
Juanita S.,"Colorado Springs, CO",4,2,,5.0,6/27/2015,Awesome meal & service from Tessa. Thanks for making our experience enjoyable! And the free birthday pizzuki was iceing on the cake!
Brian W.,"Colorado Springs, CO",65,47,21,3.0,2/11/2012,"A little pricey, but the burgers were good and there is a pretty large menu to choose from. I home brew and am choosey about my beers, so I was pleasantly pleased with the selection and quality of the house beers they served...though I was SHOCKED by the prices for the beer.  Typical Chain Sports Bar Ambiance...when will these people figure out that Adults like to have conversations and don't all waste their time watching over paid children bashing each others brains out on UFC? Overall it was ok, but I've had just as good for MUCH less price. It's not a destination, but if you're in the area with no where else to go it's ok. I'd much rather go down the street less than 1/4 mile to Senior Manuel's which has been a fixture of good food for over 30 years."
Pete B.,"Colorado Springs, CO",232,3,,1.0,8/20/2015,"If there was an option to give zero stars I would. I downloaded yelp for the sole purpose of letting people know how bad this restaurant truly is. It took an absurdly long time to get our food and over an hour to get our checks. The waiter was extremely unorganized, after our absurdly long wait the waiter returned with our checks and did not apologize for our wait. They also did not refill one entire side of the tables' water glasses. The only upside was that the food was ok. Nothing special but the overall experience was the worst I have ever had at a dining establishment and I will not be returning. Ever."
DTyndale45 ..,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,1,,3.0,8/18/2015,"Good burgers, pizza, bar good and beer. Nice atmosphere but outside of happy hour, a little pricey"
John S.,"Monument, CO",0,8,1,4.0,8/17/2014,"Pleasant, well appointed and not to loud.  Southern Fried Chicken and garlic mashed potatoes where very good, would have preferred that the corn succatash wasn't severed under the potatoes,  rather serve them on the side. The gravy was very good with a nice pepper kick. The downfall was even with a half full resteraunt the food service was quite slow."
David K.,"Ridgecrest, CA",0,76,15,2.0,12/31/2014,"Dinner last night with some friends.  I did not pick the place.  I've been here before, I don't come here unless someone else  wants to, and even then I try to convince them to go somewhere else.  The food is almost average.  I had the fish and chips.  It was greasy and over cooked.  Almost burned in some places.  The Tatonka Stout was really good!  The cheese fries with chili verde was a joke.  You should just take that off the menu.  Service was slow but at least the servers weren't rude or anything.  Also, the parking is challenging.  And this was on a Tuesday evening.  I'd hate to come here on a busy night!"
