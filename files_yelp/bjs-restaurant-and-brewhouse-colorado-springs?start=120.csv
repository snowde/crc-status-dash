Ben O.,"Williamsport, PA",45,9,,5.0,8/10/2015,"Great place for a weekend lunch with a beverage!  Nice menu with lots of lower carb offerings.  Had the grilled chicken salad and a micro brew, was very good.  Service was great!  Is on my future menu."
Jay J.,"Colorado Springs, CO",14,13,2,2.0,8/8/2015,I've been a few times and it's ok but this last time wasn't good at all.  The fish was way over done and tough.  The salad had a lot of water in it. The tuna poke is my favorite dish there but wasn't very good.  I will definitely try again but this was disappointing.  My family didn't finish their meals.  The waitress was very nice though and I think they have a good menu.
Alex L.,"Fountain, CO",2,9,,1.0,12/18/2014,We were told our table would be 30 minutes. We waited 2 hours. The manager was extremely rude. He even avoided telling us to keep waiting by sending the greeter to tell us to keep waiting. The only good part of this whole experience was the server. So much for my wife and best friends happy birthday. Two thumbs down bj's. The waitress' name was bri
Adam K.,"Colorado Springs, CO",10,17,14,1.0,9/14/2013,"Table we were taken too was dirty. Hostess got a napkin to wipe it down. SLOW service. Here in a Saturday and it has taken  over 30 to get our food and it is not even busy. And we did not order pizza. 1st Time, last time."
Adrian O.,"Colorado Springs, CO",5,177,1,3.0,4/24/2015,"Good, filling, nothing special chain restaurant food.  Service was great, however."
Jon T.,"Chesterfield, MO",93,763,486,3.0,7/15/2011,"At the end of our 12 hour drive from St Louis, we went with Bro J and wife TT to BJ's for a quick bite.  Being from St Louis it was a new chain for us.  We were not out to drink beer, but they have a very good selection.  Actually TT could not resist one. This appears to be a better place than the truly national chains like Chiles, Texas Roadkill, Appleby's, Friday's etc.  the beer selection is one difference and the menu looks a bit better, with a page of pizzas and pastas and specialties as well as the sandwiches.  The selection is truly huge. We could not really test the menu in one visit late in the evening.  Ms T had a Wedge Salad and a bowl of clam chowder.  How special can a wedge salad be?  It was fine.  The clam chowder had a lot of clams and good flavor.  It was typical in being over thickened with flour, a no-no in my book.  Everyone confuses thick with good so it sells. My burger was a good solid effort.  Better than the $14 one I had in St Louis a few days earlier at Brasserie by Niche.  This one was thick and juicy with enough salt on it to be good.  I would classify it as a pub burger.  I ordered it as a patty melt so I did not have to contend with a bun the size of a Buick.  The fries accompanying it were much like Brasserie in being coated with the crispy varnish that everyone uses these days.  Whoever invented that idea had better be getting royalties. So while chainy, this is a cut above the norm with a large selection of food and beer.  This is not a place I would go if it were in my neighborhood, but is a good selection when travelling and wanting something decent and reasonably priced (when I can't find a Mom 'n' Pop that looks promising).  I'm not too proud to eat at chains, but there are just so much more interesting places to eat out there.  So I would return and I can't say that for the other chains mentioned above."
MD C.,"Rosamond, CA",13,25,11,4.0,3/5/2015,"I have been going to BJs on N. Nevada Avenue for a few years now. I have had some issues when the restaurant is super busy (cold food, very long wait times for the food to arrive, etc...), but the management is always kind and professional. they do whatever they can to make things right. The service is always great, the food is quality and tastes great. There is a full bar with just about any drink you can think of, as well as a terrific Happy Hour. Overall, a great place to hang out and have a few drinks and dinner with friends."
Missy B.,"San Diego, CA",474,411,844,5.0,8/6/2011,"I just love this place. The menu is HUGE so they most likely have whatever you are in the mood for. I have had the pizza, sandwiches, burgers, and pasta and I have never been displeased. The service is always beyond awesome every time I go and the beer choices rival Old Chicago. My favorite is their Harvest Hefeweizen though, by far! I grew up with these restaurants in AZ and CA so I was stoked to see it finally make it to the Springs."
Herman S.,"Colorado Springs, CO",5,11,,3.0,5/11/2015,We have been there several l times. Attractive setting. Average to above average food. Very slow service every visit.
Victoria H.,"Colorado Springs, CO",12,93,29,4.0,1/20/2011,"We came by just before Christmas for a dinner with friends. We ordered Fish and Chips, Parmesan Chicken, a burger and Pot Roast, and EVERYTHING was well done. My husband remarked that, for as varied a menu as BJs has, that they made all of our dishes well is amazing. For tonight's beer I tried the Porter. I don't think I'll ever try another beer. It was one of the best porters I ever had."
Tim K.,"Colorado Springs, CO",160,703,91,3.0,1/24/2011,"Ate at BJ's once again today, this time for lunch. The lunch menu has a wide variety of options, much like their full menu. I ended up picking the Chicken Parmigiana, house salad with Italian dressing, and BJ's ""Blonde"" ale. The Chicken Parmigiana was really good, but the spaghetti that came with it was rather lacking in sauce. The house salad was a joke. It was tiny and consisted of mostly iceberg lettuce. It was about as exciting and appetizing as a discount bagged salad from the grocery store. The dressing was carried out to the table by hand in a ramekin; dressing dripping over the sides. Overall this salad was a HUGE disappointment in comparison to their full sized signature salads. The ""award winning"" and ""favorite"" Blonde Ale was unremarkable. It could have been MGD for all I knew. It was boring, and had no special ""notes"" like typical micro-brews. I'll stick to New Belgium beers. I know I can't go wrong there. Well, I'm still a fan."
Will M.,"Los Osos, CA",27,39,2,3.0,11/10/2014,"The food was excellent.  Had the southern fried chicken lunch special.  Prices are reasonable for the quality of food.  The reason for not more stars is the service.  The ladies at the front were nice but they seemed indifferent as did the wait staff, plus the amount of time waiting in between drinks, ordering, food arriving then 10 minutes to get a bill and another 10 before they came back to get it was just too much.  What should have been a 1 hour lunch turned into 2 hours.  Busy but not that busy...just be prepared for great food but less than stellar service."
Joe C.,"Fullerton, CA",3,29,7,3.0,5/11/2015,"So I worked for this establishment for three years in Brea, California. When I moved out here I was super geeked out there was a location in the Springs area. When I first started eating at this particular location I thought the service was phenomenal. The last few times it has not been the same. I'm not going to bash the servers because I understand certain tables you're just not thrilled to serve but come on Bj's (dining room) servers I expect more. Bar and Cocktail servers are on point !!! The food is still good and can't wait for this years Grand Cru."
R M.,"Littleton, CO",0,7,,1.0,2/13/2016,"The food at the restaurant is ok but the food that you order for delivery is horrible... I had two times problems with the delivered food. The firsts time, there was a hair in the food and the second time the food was unbearable to eat because it was so salty! The delivery food portions are small and it seems just tossed in the box...The first time, they re delivered the dish, but the second time, the manager told us to call the delivery service ourselves since they use a third party to deliver their food ... We spent about 40 minutes to get a hold of somebody and it took them a long time to re deliver the food... We will not order from them again."
Annalyse M.,"Colorado Springs, CO",195,108,56,4.0,1/7/2016,"My boyfriend and I come here often to watch the game and have a couple beers and a burger. I usually get the black and bleu burger with thin cut fries and it is fantastic. My boyfriend is a fan of the mini pizzas. My favorite beers on tap are the BJ's brews- particularly their IPA, Tatonka stout and Jeremiah red. The bar staff always appears to be friendly and upbeat. We have only ever sat in the bar area (not the main restaurant area) and the service is pretty consistently good. It gets really packed during games and on weekends but we usually manage to find a couple spots at the bar. I definitely think the hosts at the front desk when you first walk in could use some improving. I've been here at least 7 times and I have been greeted maybe twice. They don't acknowledge you when you walk in (even if they aren't preoccupied) and you usually have to initiate a conversation with them yourself. They are frequently just standing at the booth talking to each other."
Megan A.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,4,,1.0,3/17/2015,"Been here a couple of times and both times our waiters were horrible. The first time we just went out for dessert. It took 30 minutes for water. Over 20 minutes for her to come back and place our order. Then over an HOUR before we saw her again. We ended up leaving because who wants to wait 3 hours for ice cream? The second time I went there I asked the waitress for a gluten free menu. Which I am thankful they have but when she went to get it she slammed it on the table in front of me and said, 'Here!' Long story short, if you want people to come to your establishment, you better treat them with the utmost respect. Period."
Sara K.,"Colorado Springs, CO",12,18,2,4.0,11/15/2014,"Delicious!! :) Spaghetti was a little overcooked, but it was great overall!! Delicious and would definitely go back."
Lindita L.,"Colorado Springs, CO",3,14,,5.0,7/11/2014,"Great food!!! being from NY i'm pretty picky when it comes to food, and have been searching for a good place since i got here 3 months ago and I finally found the place. WOOHOO and everything is so fresh and delicious; i highly doubt there is anything better out there"
Rob P.,"Lowell, AR",0,75,,1.0,4/21/2014,Went to this restaurant and was seated in the bar area.  We waited for over 30 minutes and we were not acknowledged by one staff member!  It was as if we were invisible.   Every person who was seated after us in the tables nearby was served immediately.  We finally just left the restaurant and went to a restaurant next door for dinner and drinks.  We'll never return here again.  The service is horrible and staff members are not friendly in the least---not one staff member spoke to us during our entire wait.
Bryan M.,"Woodland Park, CO",0,60,,4.0,12/6/2014,"We liked this place. Big menu, great food and drinks. Every time we go, we've had good service and never came across anything we didn't like. It does seem a little pricy for what it is, but we enjoy it."
