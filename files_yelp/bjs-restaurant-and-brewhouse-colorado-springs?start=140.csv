Justin Z.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,1,,2.0,2/11/2015,"First visit here, LOVED the waitstaff and our server was attentive and pleasant....The fish taco's that my wife and myself ordered were Horrible....To be up front though, we ARE from San Diego and have certain expectations. Firstly, the FLOUR tortillas were tough, and tasted like stale store bought tortillas...:( Secondly, the ""Slaw""was missing all of the tang and creamy deliciousness that legit use of Creme Fresh would have brought. ALSO these fish tacos would GREATLY benefit from the use of Cotija or other type of Mexican cheese (better flavor profile).  The restaurant supply store ""Guacamole "" and the bland Salsa served with the dish were equally disappointing.    The pinky sized portion of grilled Mahi Mahi on each taco was at least cooked and seasoned well....This and the fresh made chips on the plate were the highlight...  We REALLY wanted to like them.....My Dad really enjoyed the Chili though..."
Ashley M.,"Antioch, CA",3,39,2,1.0,12/1/2015,"My boyfriend and I both got off of work early on a Saturday so we decided to go out to eat. We settled on BJ's as it is close to the house. This was about 2 or 3 weeks ago, and we arrived between 8 and 8:30pm. It was pretty busy, but we were seated right away. Waiter brought our drinks out right away and we ordered. We got our food in a reasonable amount of time. My boyfriend ordered pasta and it came out first and was pipping hot, you could see the steam rising off of it. He started to eat right away. A few min late my soup came out and it looked like it had been sitting out for a long time. It had that layer over it so who knows how long it had been sitting in that bowl. I took one bite and it was cold. I couldn't believe it. It was a Saturday night and the place was packed. I took a smaller bite from the other side of the bowl just to make sure and it was cold. I waited 10 min for the waiter to come back. He asked if everything was alright and I said no and pushed the bowl towards him and said you can take this back. I never send food back, but this was utterly disgusting. He asked me what was wrong and I told him it was cold. He mumbled sorry and walked away with it. Another 10 min went by and he finally returned to the table and asked if I wanted anything else, but at that point I had lost my appetite. Then because I wasn't eating my boyfriend wasn't going to eat. We asked for the check. Another 10 min went by and we finally got it and a to go box. The waiter didn't really seem to care about what had happened, which is fine, but I was pretty upset and just to acted sympathetic would've been nice. We took my boyfriends pasta home and the waiter did remove my soup from the check, but when we got home he wasn't in a good mood either and just ended up throwing the pasta in the trash. It's unfortunate, but I feel like this one thing ruined our night. I've been to this location multiple times and have never really had good experiences or bad ones. The service, food and prices has all been average, but after this last time I won't be eating at BJ's anymore. I'll stick to all the places closer to downtown."
Johan S.,"Colorado Springs, CO",8,101,82,1.0,8/5/2014,"Never, ever, ever, ever impressed by the service. The food is always spot on but I always have something negative to say about the staff. Be it the hostess, acting as if it's a issue that she has to seat us oooor the servers that are unprofessional, slow and unpleasant. Not a fan."
T.J. L.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,4,,1.0,6/8/2012,"Just had lunch there today and the service left a lot to be desired.  We waited 30-40 minutes for our food to be served.  They sent mine out 10 minutes before they brought out the rest of the meals for my friends. Being polite, I couldn't bring myself to start eating.  By the time my friends had their lunch brought to the table, my meal was cold.  Fun times! NOT!!!  If you're going there for lunch during work hours, be ready to explain to your boss why you're late getting back. I have eaten there 5 times since they opened and from the first to this last time, the service and the food has gone done hill. Needless to say, I will not be going back nor will I recommend it to anyone. On another note: If you decide to go there to drink, stick with drinking beer.  3 visits back, I ordered 3 Long Islands and walked out of there sober.  With this said, don't worry about a designated driver like I did if you are going to have mixed drinks. Edited due to censorship. Filtered my review?  Maybe I should register and create a website that allows the truth to be heard no matter how good or bad a review is about an establishment.  Thank you yelp for promoting censorship and giving lame excuses as to why you do it. Who knew yelp was going to be the Communist China of the Internet."
Hannah H.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,9,,5.0,1/13/2016,"Love BJ's! It's our go to for date night and hanging out with friends. The food is delicious, and the staff is helpful and friendly."
Lindsey A.,"Centennial, CO",27,80,59,2.0,8/5/2014,"Half price wine Tuesdays are my jam! But the kitchen is always a hot mess. Thank God our servers are infinitely awesome... We've gotten rotten fish for our ahi tuna salad, burned bison burgers (ordered rare) and forgotten food... The server staff is amazing, hence 2 stars instead of .5."
Lynn W.,"Littleton, CO",1,20,,1.0,3/7/2014,"We were a party of three and this was our first visit. Two of us had fish tacos and the third meal was a spicy salmon. The tacos had a tasteless coleslaw and the vegetables that came with the salmon was cold.   We waited forever to get served and the waitress, Kimberly, knew it too. She wouldn't come to the table to see how we were doing or ask what we thought of the food.  Slow service, cold food, and the staff didn't care.  Better places in Colorado Springs to spend your hard earned money.  An excellent choice would be Marigolds."
sharon s.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,22,,5.0,1/6/2016,"We have dined at BJ's quite often, sometimes once a week.  We find the food a value vs other reviews that think it is expensive.  They always let us order off the M-F lunch meal on the weekends.  We have never had a bad meal yet.  My husband's succotash was not up to par this time, advised our great server Brenna to talk to the kitchen.  We were not looking to have it removed from the ticket, but the manager (Jason I believe) took it off.  He came over to talk with us and assured us that he would talk to the kitchen and as we are regulars, it should be the same every time.  Husband ate the whole meal, so it was still good, just not what he was expecting.  I just don't understand the reviews that have bad service, as we never have.  Again, credits to Brenna B. for such good service and conversation.  Took the time out to just chat with us.  We will be back, probably this weekend!"
Shane S.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,2,,2.0,5/10/2014,"First, wait staff & management were very nice. Unfortunately, the food was subpar and too expensive. Might be good for beer and pizza, but we went with the chicken (Parmesan encrusted) - sent it back and ate at home. Per my wife, ""I could have done better at home. Not exciting at all (greasy/bland).""  May go back for aforementioned beer & pizza to give them one more shot."
Carissa S.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,15,,5.0,10/8/2015,"This isn't my favorite place, but I'm always happy to eat here. Their happy hour is affordable and the food is good. Everything I've had off of the full menu has been good. The lunch menu and ""light options"" menu are also great. My favorite thing is the Southern Fried Chicken. It is as good as any I've had in the south and the mashed potatoes and corn succotash are incredible. I'm also a huge fan of their home-brewed root beers and sodas, and they have a really nice selection of drinks for those who aren't beer fans. This is the place to go for a casual atmosphere, to watch a game, or if you want a nice selection of good food and drinks. The patio is also nice in the summer for some avocado egg rolls or a root beer float. Just wish they allowed dogs on the patio!"
Kerri P.,"Colorado Springs, CO",23,42,10,3.0,7/18/2014,"Update:  Sorry I have to do this, but  as other reviewers have mentioned, the service is sometimes great (as with Kate)... sometimes (like this past Sunday) not so great.    Went a little after 1:00 p.m., it was busy, but no more than any other time.  Our server was very nice, but not on the ball whatsoever.  Brought an Apple Cider instead of a beer... had to wait another good while for the beer to come, we had to wait a long long time to just get waters and never a refill (which is what I was drinking). Took forever to just order - would wiz right by our tabl, and when the food finally did come out, only 3 of four meals brought (no by our server) and my husband waited another 7 to 10 mins for his meal.   No ketchup for the fries, after waiting to ask someone... to no avail, husband actually got up himself and got it from the server's station.  When the money and credit cards were brought out is when we were asked if we wanted dessert... it was my birthday, but by this time, we were all ready to go.  Sorry, this visit got thumbs down. My (adult) son, said that was his last visit... no more.  ************* We went to BJ's last night and had such a nice time.  Our server, KATE was excellent. Just made the evening!!! Thank you! Thank you! She was great at suggesting dishes - knew the menu, prompt on refills, never had to wait for a thing. Having a good server makes the dinner, and she made it wonderful. We started out in the bar for happy hour and I had a regular mojito - must say that we just got back from a trip to Mexico and this mojito was better than the ones I had down there.  My husband had  BJ's beers, sorry, not sure which ones, but he said  they were good. The bartender was very pleasant and prompt with our order (very young looking, but she was good at making the drinks).  We ordered the avocado rolls / wraps - heavenly.  I love these so much - just perfectly delicious.  The only thing I don't like about them are the calories. I had the Santa Fe Chicken salad and it was very good also. Has a mixture of greens with sliced chicken breast and avocado (had to take half of it home as it was a large portion). Husband had the California burger.... he liked his too.  I tried it and had a great flavor. Comes on toasted bread, but I think we might like it better on a bun... but the flavor was excellent. Then to top off the calories... had the new peanut butter pazookie...oh my gosh this was SOOOO GOOD.  We were supposed to share it, but I ate most of it. It was a nice evening out and I am ready to go again."
Dennis W.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,1,,4.0,12/13/2014,"Great lunch. Had the brew of the day Grand Cru smooth and strong 10% alcohol so beware. Avocado wraps, Tuscan tomato bisque soup for me and chicken tortilla soup for my wife. Followed by a shared Kale and Grilled Brussel sprout salad super tasty! All excellent."
pili p.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,5,1,1.0,10/27/2013,"BJs will never get your order correct in the KITCHEN :( Disappointedly inconsistent for a chain restaurant. We have been to BJs more times than we have been satisfied, with both the service and the food. We have had surly, insulting, sweet, and friendly servers, but as to be expected, the negative experiences outweigh the positives. Our party's beers are always decent, but Phantom Cañon brews are preferred."
Jon W.,"Durango, CO",0,17,,4.0,6/27/2015,called ahead luckily and made a reservation and got in right on time. we were two families with kids ranging from 14 to 11. everyone very happy and satisfied. tons of choices and a great kids menu. great service. reasonable prices.
Lynda B.,"Colorado Springs, CO",1,161,4,5.0,7/29/2015,"I love your Tuesday 1/2 off wines.  You can't go wrong with the flatbread or deep dish pizza on happy hour.  We sat at the bar top, service was great as always.  Crystal is super.  She was busy but kept her cool.  Since I am a wine drinker, I was impressed with Kevin.  He was emptying the dishwasher and wiped the rim of each wine glass.  Impressed me!!"
Jan P.,"Selden, NY",3,23,1,4.0,6/3/2014,I didn't know anything about BJ's until a friend recommended it to me. I went in with a friend and ordered some pizza and he ordered a plate. They were beyond satisfying and really made me love this place. I would definitely recommend to those who want a good bite to eat.
Jonathan J.,"Los Angeles, CA",38,46,5,2.0,10/3/2013,"Seriously...all the advertisements for watching football, but NO wifi?  In 2013??? No thanks!"
Christopher S.,"Pottstown, PA",8,11,,4.0,1/12/2014,The appetizers and beer were great. My burger and side were a little disappointing. I would go back but hope they improve menu.
Cobra K.,"Singapore, Singapore",64,1257,5727,3.0,5/5/2012,Ordered the Southern Fried Chicken lunch special for $5.95.  It consists of 1 decent sized chicken breast breaded and then deep fried on a bed of mashed potatoes with corn off the cob.  The chicken breast was actually very tender and wasn't overcooked at all.  Overall dish was of good value for a lunch as long as you don't pay $2.95 for a soda.
Brian M.,"Aurora, CO",3,108,,2.0,11/25/2013,"Nice atmosphere and massive menu.  Service was terrible and slow....dang.  Sorry you don't like your job or are having a bad day but please don't try to infect everyone else w the bad attitude.  Food is ok, nothing great.  Ridiculously large does not mean good, just means large.  Smaller portions and better quality with an upgrade to service all needed.  Skip this spot and go to others in the area."
