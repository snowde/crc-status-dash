Jessicca L.,"Colorado Springs, CO",8,3,,1.0,12/3/2011,"We've been to BJs several times and the last 2 times left before being seated. * Went in on a Saturday night and were told the wait time was 20-30min, 45 minutes later it was still a (20-30) min wait. So we left. * Last night, we got smart and called ahead. We were told to come down and we'd be seated immediately. 5 minutes later, we're in line behind another couple who are told 30-40min wait. We get up and provide our name and that we called ahead (and were told immediate seating for 2) to be told 30-40min wait. Ridiculous!! NEVER GOING BACK!! Even when we do get seating, it takes 20min to get a beer, don't even think about ordering a mixed drink. You're lucky to get it as the appetizers come out."
Jane O.,"Colorado Springs, CO",3,18,,1.0,11/17/2013,I have been here at least three times. Their beer is nice. Would be nicer if it was cold or at least in chilled glass. Their menu is huge! But that's not always a good thing when the food is subpar. I got the turkey club which was so greasy that I was constantly wiping my hands and my mouth after each bite. My daughter ordered that shrimp scampi and didn't finish it because it was greasy and tasteless. I could go on with how my husbands pulled pork would embarrass any lover of good BBQ but I won't. Having the waitress push their pizookie on us every time she walked by didn't help matters either. I really want to like this place but it just sucks.
Gina C.,"Old Westbury, NY",36,124,21,1.0,6/22/2013,"Service here is consistently poor. We've been here about a dozen times, not necessarily by choice, but because friends have invited us to join.  The menu selection is good, but food is only marginal.  Wait time for a table is long, service is slow, and they can't seem to get the orders right. Ever.  When they first opened and the service was poor, we dismissed it because we figured there would be some time to adjust, with all new staff. And each time, we hoped it would get better. It didn't. Sometimes it was even worse!  Very disappointing.  I will have to decline future invitations to this place because the poor service is not tolerable. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone at all."
David L.,"Colorado Springs, CO",82,173,47,4.0,2/2/2012,"Went with a very large party (20+). The staff was excellent! They were helpful, enthusiastic and just awesome with everything we were wanting. Food is yummy and they have great prices."
Stacie G.,"Colorado Springs, CO",80,245,1235,2.0,8/6/2011,"Stopped in last night after work for a draft beer and appetizers with a friend.  I have really enjoyed this place to date, but this evening it just wasn't the same.  Our female server was way over-the-top friendly and perky asking us questions such as ""Are WE ready to order?"" and ""How are WE enjoying are food?""  Irritating to say the least.  Servers:  unless you're going to take a seat and contribute to paying the bill, please don't talk to patrons in first-person!  Blech.  Another ""blech"" was the order of fried artichoke hearts we tried.  They sure sounded good on paper and the waitress assured us with perky vigor they were one of her favorite items on the menu (!) so we tried them.  Gross is all I have to say.  The beer was good though (albeit pricey - even at happy hour) and the ahi tuna appetizer was good.  All-in-all, I'll go back but will steer clear of that waitress and the artichokes!"
Jennifer F.,"Colorado Springs, CO",94,10,,4.0,7/7/2011,I was pleasantly surprised with how wonderful BJ's was.  People we talked to had mixed feelings about this restaurant.  The menu was ginormous and the beer selection was awesome.   We started our meal with the avacodo eggrolls which were amazing!  Our main entrees were awesome too. The customer service was great! We had Drew for a waiter and he was probably the the best waiter that we have had in a long time.   We celebrated our anniversary and he brought us each a dessert with a candle to celebrate.   We will definiately be back for beer and burgers :)
Alexander T.,"Air Force Academy, CO",11,10,1,2.0,9/15/2013,"The place's atmosphere is great. Great service and surrounding. But the food is a bit expensive for the portions. I got the 14"" Deep Dish Buffalo Chicken Pizza and it was tasteless. And it was $25. With that price, I would expect at least something decent, but it did not taste like anything. Just dough and cheese. Sorry, but not a fan. Personally, I would not come here again."
Adam X.,"Colorado Springs, CO",69,61,2,3.0,3/24/2011,"This is a chain, not sure how large but you definitely get a 'prefab-atmosphere"" feel here. The beer is okay; I asked for the hoppiest beer they have and got their IPA... it's kinda hoppy. I've had better and worse. If you're only going for the beer then there are better choices than this... but if you are going for food as well as a drink or 2 this place is an okay choice.  The place is kinda like a more polished and phoney Phantom Canyon but since they have locations in more progressive cities than our fine Colorado Springs they have a veggie burger. That's a big one up over Phantom for sure but it falls short of The Warehouse's veg burger. Prices here are a buck or 2 cheaper than said downtown brew pubs and the menu is more extensive.  If you're in the area try it but it's not a destination. There are a lot of brew pubs in Colorado and I prefer mine a little more home grown..."
Jo P.,"Colorado Springs, CO",1,11,1,4.0,11/26/2012,I love the root beer here and the Parmesan crusted chicken is yummy. Can't go wrong with strawberry beignet or a hot gluten free chocolate chip cookie for dessert either!  If you like your cookies cooked through though - make sure to ask for it that way; we've had several almost raw ones come out and had to send them back. Service is usually pretty good - although occasionally a little slow.
Lynn K.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,9,,2.0,4/11/2011,"If you are in the mood for greasy bar food, this is the place. Even the burger buns are greasy! After our second visit we decided we won't be going back. Not because the food is horrible, but mostly because we feel like we can get a better deal/atmosphere at someplace like Meadow Muffins or Phantom Canyon. People rave about BJ's, but I just don't get it. It's chain-y and very sterile, generic.  Maybe they have good beer, but we aren't beer fans so we have not tried their selection. They offer pizza here as well and it was really not good (I am from Chicago, so I feel I can judge). The sauce tasted canned and the dough was oily. Burgers are okay, and we have not tried any salads or sandwiches. Overall, if this place is nearby and you have a hankerin for a burger and beer, go for it. If you feel like driving a little extra for something a little more authentic and local, I would definitely head somewhere like Phantom, etc."
Jenifer M.,"Colorado Springs, CO",1,15,1,2.0,11/5/2012,"Hmmmm....this place leaves me scratching my head. We went as a party of four. Our waitress (Kim) was excellent, although the time for our food to come out seemed a little slow. My husband's and my dinner were really good, but the kitchen completely messed up our son's order. (Not Kim's fault) He sent his food back. The rest of us were done with our meals when his corrected order finally arrived at our table. We really felt his meal should have been comped at this point, but we were offered two comped desserts. Probably not adequate compensation, but it was something. The kicker came at the end when we discovered our son's order had been billed twice. Not cool. It was, of course, corrected, but this was too much hassle for one meal. Seems like there are some serious management issues going on at BJ's. Overall, food was good, but not really worth the issues that went with it."
Cliff L.,"Missouri City, TX",90,50,11,3.0,2/12/2011,I heard people talk about this place like the 2nd coming of jesus was frying up platters in the kitchen. Everyone was running out of the office to get home and get to this place! I gave it a couple of weeks to calm down over there after opening and tried it for myself. All I can say is it was ok. VERY TRENDY! Just wasnt my type of place. Very california/New york/sex and the city style which is fine I guess if you like that type of thing but in my eyes when you bring a place like this to a small town like the springs it just comes off as fake. The food was decent (NOTHING like I had heard it was all throughout construction) but it was ok. Of course ordering is a task because like the cheesecake factory BJ's has those 30 page really tacky menus that have more AD's than menu.
Sibby S.,"Colorado Springs, CO",31,442,,3.0,11/9/2011,"For a chain, it is better than most, but still has that chainy, generic feel.  Very large and eclectic menu. I was there with a work group of ten, and we ordered every single appetizer on the menu. Some were decent, others fair. Their stuffed mushrooms were the stand-out. I ordered their flatbread pizza, that was just ""ok"". Average salads. Overall, really can't complain about this place, but there is nothing here that has me itching for a return visit either. Just OK."
Jenny L.,"Colorado Springs, CO",12,64,,2.0,2/3/2011,"The beer was tasty.  I had the nutty brewnette.  The food was okay.  My friend and I split the California club appetizer pizza.  It was a bit overpriced for what it was (cracker thin crust with some bacon, tomatoes and avocado chunks) but was pretty tasty.  We also each got the soup and salad which were mediocre at best.  It was pretty much salad from a bag and really bad broccoli cheddar soup.  I think soup from a can is tasty so it was disappointing to not enjoy the soup on a cold day. The service was pretty awesome though.  They took the soup off our bill after seeing that neither my friend or I ate much of it.  It was nice to be taken care of like that without having to make a stink. So maybe I will just go there for the beer?  It's pretty crowded in there but I think it would be good for happy hour."
Mike F.,"Denver, CO",0,28,5,3.0,5/27/2013,A solid three star performance. Our service was better than the food--which wasn't bad. It was average chain fare. The facilities were clean and you can see that the decor was finely tuned and nothing left to chance; the look was managed by corporate down to the smallest detail. Not a bad thing but its no corner diner. Go back sure. First choice? Not necessarily. Again: a definitive three star experience
phoenix t.,Hong Kong,15,70,3,4.0,10/11/2011,"Conspicuously located in a suburban super strip, BJ's Brewhouse is a great choice for a good time with friends and family.  The bar is stocked with roughly half a dozen local beers and two-three dozen national brands on tap.  the talkative bartenders are more than happy to pour a taster of any of tipples that you are not familiar with.  I tried a red lager from boulder which was delicious.  While not a sports bar, the restaurant is complimented with several TVs, usually turned to football.   The deep dish pizzas are highly recommended.  We ordered the bacon cheeseburger pizza, which, surprisingly, tasted just like a bacon cheese burger down to the diced pickle topping and special sauce.  So, admittedly, i was hoping for a pizza-like version, rather than such an authentic re-make.  Now that I re-read what I just wrote, surely I'm an idiot, but I can't explain it any better.  I was a big fan of the potato skins, which were really deep-fried hollowed out potato crowned with cheese, green onions, chunks of bacon and sour cream--deliciously sinful.  The chili was our table's most unfavorite offering.  Though the beer-based chili sounded mouth-watering, the finished product tasted slightly bitter, which was a turn off. The service and atmosphere reeked of bustling-chain-store-turnover, but was not unpleasant.  I'd highly suggest BJ's for a company lunch, family dinner or just a beer-drinkin bender with friends."
Dee S.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,26,,2.0,2/9/2015,"I had the fish and chips....fish was not a golden brown. Over cooked and way too chewy.  Steamed broccoli normally has butter and/or seasoning on it,  mine didn't.  My husband had thin crust pizza with sausage. No sauce on it which was weird,  very little cheese and the crust was more like a very bland cracker.  Very disappointed and will never go back. Honestly,  the blandest food ever. Yuck!"
Pom M.,"Colorado Springs, CO",94,32,54,4.0,11/8/2013,Pizzas are good. The pumpkin seasonal ale was also pretty tasty. I started going to BJs in California so having it here local is pretty cool. Happy hour specials are also good but the bar area seating can get pretty crowded. All in all a good place to hangout in CSprings.
Tyson R.,"Air Force Academy, CO",2,8,7,5.0,8/17/2013,Just finished my third dinner here last night. Great place because the menu is so expansive. You can find something different you want to eat every time you go. Great house rootbeer and specialty desserts.
Lito A.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,2,,4.0,11/19/2014,i've always been a fan of bj's my favorite dish is the avocado egg rolls. i go to bj's just for the egg roll
