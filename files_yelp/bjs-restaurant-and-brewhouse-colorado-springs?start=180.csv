Chris R.,"Denver, CO",0,23,,2.0,10/17/2012,"Went because we had promotional gift card but the gift card machine ""was down"".  The cards were worth $5 but we were not comped.  Just told to ""come back""  No thanks.  Plus a Captain and Coke is $7.50. haha."
Sarah S.,"Colorado Springs, CO",93,144,31,4.0,2/5/2013,"my god yes. Im pretty impressed with this place. Best teriyaki salmon i have every had. My mouth is watering as im writing this review. ugh, so much saliva."
Matt B.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,19,,3.0,8/12/2013,"Pretty good. Nothing really bad to say just not great. Pizza is good and the beer is good too. They used to have a $20 takeout for 2 people pizza salad and a pazookie. I wish they would bring it back, it was a really good deal and very convenient to pick up after work."
Danika C.,"Colorado Springs, CO",271,14,,2.0,11/19/2012,"Went to the BJs Brewhouse in Santa Rosa, CA over the summer and enjoyed it, so when we got back we decided to try the one here.  I wish we hadn't.  Had to send my burger back because I asked for it medium well and it was extremely well done.  Also, it was supposed to have carmelized onions on it, but the onions were sauted, not carmelized.  When I got my burger back...after my husband and daughter were done eating, nothing had changed.  It was still over cooked and the onions weren't carmelized.  They clearly don't know what carmelizing means.  The manager offered to bring me soup while I was waiting for my 2nd burger, but I declined because had I had the soup, I wouldn't have been able to eat the burger I was waiting for. We might go back based on the experience we had in CA, but I won't be order the burgers again."
Kasey B.,"Colorado Springs, CO",5,56,,3.0,8/28/2014,"Remember Bennigans? This is pretty similar. Generally it's elevated bar food. It's a good place for a girls' night, but the drinks are expensive, the meals are expensive, and the desserts are expensive. It's one of those places that I don't argue with someone if they want to go there, but I don't pick it out for myself. It is very clean and spacious, so that is definitely in its favor. The parking is difficult at times though."
Chris G.,"El Paso, CO",12,54,3,2.0,6/30/2013,"THis place is a restaurant first, tap house second.  It is not a brewery.  All their beers are imported from california where their headquarters and brewery is.  Food is good, expensive but good.  Happy hour is good also offering food discounts.  Always packed so expect a moderate wait for a table.  BJ's beer is sub par to that sampled from every other brewery in the Springs.  Convenient access of I-25 so meeting here is a breeze.  With so  many great family/locally owned brew pubs and restaurants in the Springs it seems a shame to  eat here and miss out on smaller more intimate settings."
Kitty R.,"Phoenix, AZ",16,87,220,3.0,3/25/2013,So I fell in love with BJ's back in S.CA.  Great variety of food/drink and cool atmosphere to eat in.   Never had a bad experience in CA.  The one in CO Springs just opened so we will see if it matches up to our experience in CA.  We were there for opening week so everyone learning their way around but not bad.
Steve S.,"Durango, CO",8,17,,4.0,12/6/2012,Descent food and amazing beer.  The Imperial stout is just to die for.  They could lighten the place up a little bit.  It's very dark inside.
Marc S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,3,,4.0,12/21/2011,"Large extensive menu. Large extensive restaurant. If it sounds good, it is good. Gets VERY busy, especially on weekends. Service is hit or miss. We usually try to eat in the bar. Typically better service there. Beer selection is a little over priced but lots to choose from. Plenty of TV's to catch a game and they run football happy hours. Not a destination restaurant but a good place to go if you live nearby or are staying near I-25 and Garden of the Gods road."
Mike M.,"Peyton, CO",12,74,204,4.0,1/26/2013,We tend to have some of our executive meetings here for lunch. The food is great and there is so much to choose from. Eating outside is a nice touch in the warmer months.
John A.,"Fountain, CO",10,16,,4.0,3/29/2011,"Just had a late dinner there. First time there. The staff were excellent; made you feel welcomed from the get go, server (Michelle) very friendly and genuinely happy. We weren't in a hurry, and she did a great job on timing, i.e. leaving us be until just at the moment we needed refills / ready to order.  The beer was good too. I had the Red, the Brewnette, and Blonde.  (I'm not particular, ha). The Red was my favorite though.  For food, the Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps were very good.  The Miso salmon was cooked wonderfully and presented with class.  The prices were moderate, but the atmosphere, beer, and friendly staff made it a place I will be going back to.  In retrospect, I can see how this place may be viewed as ""trendy"" but at least you don't get the ""native"" attitude from the people working / patronizing there like the Phantom Canyon crowd."
Marie G.,"Colorado Springs, CO",7,3,,2.0,6/29/2013,"The beer is good, but don't bother with the food.  I had the BJ's Brewhouse Blonde Shrimp and it was fast food quality with a high price. No flavor, just fried coating.  The coleslaw it came with was one bite.  Made me disappointed that I spent the money.  If you want water, you have to flag down your server over and over again.  This has happened every time I've gone.  They'll check your beer often, but forget water."
Susan S.,"Manitou Springs, CO",0,4,3,1.0,10/19/2013,"I wish I drank beer...my friends I dine with just loved their selections.  Don't let the salad descriptions deceive you. Fresh green veggies are non existent.  Greasy ""Line food"" all the way.  I decided to embrace the grease, and ordered a burger. It sounded so yummy. Our server was awesome, but she couldn't control the poorly prepped burger. It's three dollars more for an iceberg / carrot slice salad, & you cannot substitute it for the fries. I sucked up my veggie snob pride, & stole iceberg lettuce, pickles, and tomatoes for my burger off of the kids plates.- not like they would eat it.  My husband ordered a salad. Iceberg city with deep fried onion rings.- come on! At least offer some fresh onions!?  My arteries are still mad at me. The place was packed, even for a Thursday. I kept eying Chipotle's during the 50 minute wait for the table & then another 40 minutes for food. We did get excited once when they told us our table was ready and we all stood up in anticipation just to learn they activated the wrong pager.  I won't be returning, even if the meal is paid for. 5 guys has my undying greasy burger devotion....with 1/60th the the wait time."
Steve B.,"Colorado Springs, CO",1,21,2,2.0,1/25/2013,"Comparing the BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse in the Springs to the one in Denver, I would have to say that the one in Denver is better. I have grown accustomed to the sub par customer service in Colorado Springs but I expected more from this restaurant. Right off the bat at the hostess stand which is the face of any establishment, they were engaged in a conversation which prevented them from greeting me and my family for about a full minute.  Here is some free advice to BJ's, your hostesses should not have their backs turned to incoming customers. There is no consistency in the dishes and the food was better in Denver. Also, I hate it when servers reach over my food. Probably won't return! I am not writing this review out of malice because I was really looking forward to dining at this establishment in the Springs. Totally disappointed."
Deela C.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,9,,1.0,11/12/2014,"our order was wrong we spent $100 for a to go order !!! management was rude and basically said we were lying about our food , and would not replace or refund our money even when we offered the food back never will go back"
David L.,"Concord, NH",15,93,1,2.0,4/7/2012,"Food is very pricy for what you get. $15 for a small deep dish pizza that was sub par. That's right, sub par. $6.25 for beer unless you try one of their brews they make, none of the dark ones were very good. The blonde tastes like Bud. Still over $5 for those. Most meals are around $15. For that price you can go to a non chain and enjoy better food. Worst of all the place is so noisy you can't hear the waitress."
Jim M.,"Colorado Springs, CO",5,56,15,3.0,10/22/2010,"I think the food is pretty good for this type of restaurant, and there is a wide selection of beer. However, I have had conflicting experiences. I have been there with my family on a busy weened and have received fantastic service. I've also walked out after being ignored at the bar while trying to order a beer on a slow weeknight. Good food, good beer choices, spotty service."
s d.,"Colorado Springs, CO",14,92,144,4.0,7/21/2012,Not a big fan of their beers but they have a good selection of others on tap.  Awesome lunch deal with unlimited soup and salads and you can choose from a handful of each for each round.  Chowder is great.
Katrina K.,"Colorado Springs, CO",2,9,1,4.0,2/17/2013,"Had an excellent meal and great service. I had the shrimp scampi and it was fantastic. Hubby had New York strip, it was delicious as well. Berr was great and not too bad at 5.50 but $10.50 for the mixed drinks was super high. Total bill $75.00 for two."
Laura S.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,5,1,4.0,2/9/2011,"My hubby just had lunch here and we actually enjoyed it. The pricing for the lunch specials aren't too bad, but if you end up buying drinks and appetizers it can add up. The staff was really nice and the food was brought out in a timely manner.  The food was excellent. We had the Ahi Poke for appetizer and it was delicious. Their mini pizzas are quite filling so are there fish tacos.  Definitely head out there around 11:30 am for lunch because it does get packed!"
