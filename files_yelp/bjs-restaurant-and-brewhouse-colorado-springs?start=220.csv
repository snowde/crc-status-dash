Andrew I.,"Colorado Springs, CO",65,18,,1.0,5/12/2012,"Oh my goodness, this place has taken a nose dive!  Initially it was busy, but still reasonably fast and the food was worth the wait.  We hadn't been there in 8-10 months and went back for a mid Saturday meal.  At 3:00, there was no wait to get in.  My family and I ordered drinks and apps.  The calamari was greasy, and overbreaded, out flat bread was dry and didn't have may toppings.  My wife's salad was dry, very skimpy on the dressing.  My tortilla soup was tasty, but didn't have a spoon.  When I asked for one, the server brought it holing it basically at the front end!  I wiped it off and ate.  Then, there must have been a 30 minute wait before our meal came out.  Mind you, this is mid-day on Saturday and it wasn't all that busy.  My son's chicken parm was good, but my daughters' spaghetti were both quite lacking for sauce.  My wife's shrimp tacos were under seasoned.  Last, my medium steak was well done.  I sent it back and it took at least another 12-15 minutes to get back.  By that time, everyone else had eaten, so I just got it to go.  I think, given the fact that the gravy and sauce on the side had congealed, that my food had been sitting for 10-15 minutes under the warming lamp and the steak overcooked.  Finally, after the manager (who had to be 25) came and talked to us, the server started going faster, but to the point of running!  It used to be a fun place to go for a good meal.  Maybe they just want to have you sample the brewery area enough so you don't notice the quality concerns.  Unless things change, I'd never go back."
Amy M.,"Colorado Springs, CO",49,9,,5.0,8/8/2013,"I love this place! Every time I go here the atmosphere is amazing. The food is excellent! I have tried a lot of the menu items and they are all fair priced. Great apps, great food overall! Great service!"
Jenny L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,19,,2.0,8/7/2013,"over-priced. our server was great, really friendly.  I ordered the thai chicken salad - it tasted like cumin which was weird. the lettuce seemed to be old, wilted and from a bag (probably bought at the nearby costco).  the caesar salad was much better and crisp. the fries were good but not brown."
Tiger M.,"Castle Rock, CO",40,219,5,4.0,9/4/2010,Awesome place! The beer was good and the lunch menu was even better. My wife and I both had the grilled cheese with ham and it came with tomato soup. It was really really good. Our server wasn't the greatest but the whole experience was good. On a side note trying to find a place to park was awful. They are right next to a bunch of shops and it was really hard to find a spot.
Kenneth W.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,14,,4.0,2/12/2011,"This is a great place to eat. I have been to a few BJ's in several citys and I thinkthe food is always good the service great and the beer is always cold. It's typical american fare food with a few splash's of creativity and a couple of great options, I'm a huge fan of the meatloaf sandwich. Absolutly i recommend stopping buy here and getting lunch or dinner and a beer"
jeff k.,"Austin, TX",3,81,,5.0,9/6/2010,this is far above normal bar food.  I would go out of my way for that California Burger.
Janet A.,"Colorado Springs, CO",27,10,,3.0,6/14/2013,"Our food was good, our waiter funny and attentive, the wait was long, but there were a lot of customers. The reason for 3 stars was the blonde girl who was greeting people up front. I should say NOT greeting people. It was like we took her away from something else she felt was more important just for her to take our name and how many people in our party. No Hello or anything, just 15 minutes (which was more like 30, but that was fine we saw it was crowded). When it came time for us to be seated she actually yelled at the young man taking us to our table to ""Not be so talkative to the people you seat"" right in front of us....talk about feeling uncomfortable. The ladies room had 1 stall working out of 3 without tp and when I went to let her know I was dismissed by a shake of her head. I would go back but I do not want to run into this blonde young woman again. She should realize that it is because of the customers that she even has a job!!! (BTW no name tag for me to even tell you her name--she worked this past Wed night the 12th)"
Franz H.,"Colorado Springs, CO",2,7,,4.0,10/2/2010,"Long wait, call ahead didn't really help.  Chili Burger and pizza are worth it!  Grilled chicken pasta was bland.  Avacado egg rolls ROCK!  GOOD BEER!!!!"
Alexia K.,"Simla, CO",0,1,3,1.0,12/6/2012,I will never go back to a place where there staff is not honest. My friend and I went there for lunch. I took off my sunglasses and put them in my case and set them on the table. I leave the restaurant and head home. And my friend goes you left your glasses on the table. I called as soon as I remembered. Someone there is not telling the truth and took my glasses. I will never go back. They need to talk to there staff and the bus boy or waitress who was working the bar Monday at 12:30. I wouldn't be weighting this if I was not 100 percent sure. I left there and went straight home. Something needs to b done.
Andrew M.,"Colorado Springs, CO",8,58,3,4.0,2/14/2012,"My family loves this place.  The food is just fantastic - haven't had a bad thing yet.  The menu is massive - reminds me of The Cheesecake Factory - pages and pages of great food. The beer is fresh and cold.  Don't know how you could go wrong here,"
Chris S.,"Fountain, CO",5,7,9,3.0,2/7/2012,"For my first time there the experience could have been better. Service was slow but the manager was aware of this enough to come talk to us and bought me my first beer. Still not sure why our waitress was having a hard time serving her area...bad day....bad attitude....just not sure. One minute she was friendly the next a little peeved. The atmosphere when you walk in looks like an upper scale brew house but it is anything but that. I think they over dressed the place for what it really is. The beer was great. Had the Piranha and loved it. Had samplers of several other beers (don't remember them all) and both me and the wife liked them all. The food was really good. My wife had a chili burger and I had the turkey burger, both were great. All in all it was a decent afternoon out......worthy of another visit, but only three stars because the whole service thing and feel of the place kind of put everything off a bit."
Yesenia V.,"Colorado Springs, CO",2,42,11,5.0,1/29/2011,"so happy to see them here now. i'm from cali and it was a frequent place for me. the food is great, especially the pan pizza! happy hour is good, otherwise beer isnt any  more special than any other place."
Paul S.,"Denver, CO",0,4,,1.0,8/19/2011,"unflexible arriving late, rude staff, subpar food & bad attitude. I will never go to a BJs again!! Boooooo"
Cat K.,"Boulder, CO",1,44,6,3.0,1/7/2013,"This was an okay place to enjoy a meal.  I spent the evening in the springs with my family and we decided to stop by here. The place wasn't too busy for being 5 pm on a Sunday night.  We were sat and the waitress took our drink order and we waited and waited and waited. I don't know about any of you, but I'm getting a bit annoyed at having to wait long amounts of time for my drinks or meal to be served. I've had experience with both. As for the food experience, I ordered the BBQ beef sandwich with a side salad (balsamic vinagrette). I did not like the dressing. It just tasted waaaay to sweet for me. BUT, the BBQ sauce on my sandwich was fabulous. I enjoyed that immensely.  If you want to try a good, filling sandwich, I suggest this one. Also, since I chose not to drink last night, I ordered a sparkling raspberry lemonade. It tasted like a Sanpellegrino and I would order it again. Overall, I rate a 3/5 for food, drink, service.  If I got a gift card here I may go again but I most likely won't."
