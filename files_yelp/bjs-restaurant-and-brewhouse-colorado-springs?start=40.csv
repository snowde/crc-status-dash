Tellsplatte ..,"Colorado Springs, CO",22,203,51,4.0,10/4/2016,"Update review... thought the food quality was slowly going downhill for a while, but then I had to opportunity to use their bogo (email) offer a few times on their surf and turf, and I have to say, they make one of the best rib eye steaks I've ever had.  Not much of a steak guy to begin with, but they do excellent steaks."
Ben K.,"Colorado Springs, CO",58,6,,2.0,12/24/2016,"First, I want to say the food was delicious. When we arrived on a Friday night we were seated immediately. Our issue was our service.  We ordered an appetizer  (mozzarella sticks) and we each had burgers (bison burger was amazing). However, we received our burgers but not the appetizer. Waitress didn't even know. She failed to provide refills on our drinks and disappeared for 10+ minutes. Instead of comp us the appetizer she just canceled it. Her service was horrible."
Jan M.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,10,,3.0,6/4/2017,"Usually a good  experience but not so this eve.   Early eve, not crowded.  Women's bathroom gross.  Brittany was an unhappy server so that was a bummer.  A good server can make or break a dining experience.  Brittain was not helpful, not smiling, not interested."
Brian C.,"Colorado Springs, CO",3,11,8,1.0,10/22/2016,This is my first visit to a BJ's Brewhouse in Colorado and we never made it to a table. The Hostess today must've been having a pretty bad day. She was not hospitable or friendly. She was so uninviting and unfriendly we simply walked out. The Server offered to get a Manager but I will not pay good money for poor service out the gate. I hope this is not the norm.
Ryan H.,"Monument, CO",26,44,9,1.0,8/6/2016,This place is way overpriced for the quality and quantity of the food you get. It's difficult to find anything on the menu that is under $12 and isn't a burger.
Regina C.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,1,,1.0,1/16/2017,"Today was the worst experience I have ever had a restaurant. Soggy greasy chips, oily tomato bisque, wrong order put in. Guess the waitress ordered my ""real"" order on the fly which resulted in being served raw chicken. No thanks. Best part of today was the always reliable beer and an apologetic manager who attempted to make up for the waitress and kitchen."
Travis C.,"Galveston, TX",6,2,,2.0,6/23/2016,"Said we'd wait 30 minutes to sit; sat an hour later. Didn't get our drinks until 15 minutes after we sat. When our food came, one person who requested no cheese had cheese on her plate. When she told our waitress that there was cheese, she took it back, and returned the food with the cheese simply scraped off the top. We had to get the manager's attention to get anything done. I love BJ's, but I won't be coming back to this one."
M E.,"Cameron, NC",0,16,4,3.0,4/15/2017,"Hostess was very friendly, food was great. Only complaint had to wait a while for them to bring the check & after taking the card there was another wait when hardly anyone was there & wasn't engaging."
Alex S.,"Colorado Springs, CO",46,5,1,1.0,4/11/2017,"My experiences at this restaurant have been less than desirable. I frequently eat out and am amazed that I've been so displeased all 3 times I've been here. I try not to be a pain & always tip at least 20%. This time we weren't even offered another beverage & we barely saw our server until he offered us dessert & the check. I would have gone about my life without comment, until I noticed that I was charged more than I authorized. I intentionally tipped low, due to the bad service. Granted, it was only a $2.00 overcharge, but not up to them to change the tip I authorized. My question is, how many times has this server done this? My advice, spend your money elsewhere."
Marx M.,"Pueblo, CO",7,11,2,1.0,3/1/2017,"My wife went in to get a table. I was parking the car. She told the hostess her name and number of people in our party. She asked where the restrooms were. The hostess pointed towards that area. I came in 5 minutes after. Asked if a lady in a black sweater came in for two. The hostess said she was in the bar. I walked in the bar and throughout the whole restaurant. Then I saw my wife coming out of the restroom. The hostess said oh I'm sorry. First impressions are everything. I would not have  those two greeting anyone. We were the only ones in the lobby. She told us it would be 15 to 20 minutes wait. Even though,  i saw several open tables. She seated us within 10 minutes. The waitress took five to eight minutes to come to the table. We ordered two Iced Teas. We also at the same time told her we were ready to order. 10 minutes later the waitress brought our Iced Teas. 10 minutes after that our Caesar salad came out. It had random pieces of spinach and 3 slivers of carrot. Not sure if that was supposed to be in there. The flavor was okay though.  10 minutes after that are rack of ribs and are chicken barbaco came out. Again the flavor was good but it was hardly 140 degrees required by the state. After a while our waitress came over to check on us. She did notice she forgot my iced tea refill I had asked for earlier. I also asked if I could have some ketchup. She brought me over a bottle I squeezed it and it queefed because it was empty. She heard it and brought me another one. After consuming most of it we noticed there was a long blonde hair attached to one of the unconsumed ribs. At that point we were done eating. The waitress came over and we told her the situation. She said I'm sorry and took everything away. We asked for the check at the same time. It took at least 10 to 12 minutes for this to happen. The manager then shows up and never apologized just said how are we doing. I said not to good obviously. By then reiterated can I have my check please. This took another five to eight minutes. The waitress came over and gave me my change and apologized. They did take the rack of ribs off the check. We eat out 2 to 3 times a week. We definitely will not be returning to BJ's."
Moira I.,"Cañon City, CO",0,2,,1.0,9/24/2016,"Food poisoning.  I'm sorry too be writing such a poor review because it really wasnt all bad...  until it was.  We arrived at 530 and did not leave until close to 800. The service was a bit inattentive and slow,  but when our food arrived two of our table's meals were cold. Not just not warm... but cold.  These were replaced and comped which was a plus. Unfortunately,  by about 2 am I was awake with a headache and by 630 am I was sick- food poisoning."
Rita R.,"Pueblo, CO",10,5,13,5.0,8/21/2015,"Our favorite server, Cathy, is AWESOME. She is always friendly, extremely efficient and witty too. The food is great too. The ahi poke is our favorite. Love their burgers and sandwiches too."
Douglas S.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,6,,3.0,6/20/2016,"Enjoyed the food BUT - it all came at the same time!! Appetizer, pizza and garlic knots all at once. Glad we didn't order dessert at the same time.  Next time we'll order only one course at a time."
Charlene R.,"Canyon Country, CA",5,10,,3.0,7/12/2016,Almost everything was good but the burger was overlooked . Skinny margarita was delicious and the clam chowder as good as many beach town restaurants.
David C.,"Ewa Beach, HI",105,11,5,5.0,7/7/2016,"Came in at happy hour.  Great service, beer and pupus.   Had hot wings, a half priced mini pan pizza and a few beers.  Pizza was Half price.  Got wings discounted too. Good place."
Lang N.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,4,,4.0,2/3/2016,"Good Food This is our go-to restaurant when my husband and I can't decide where to go.  We have only complained about the food once.  And we have only complained about the service once. Ahi poke - my all time favorite appetizer.  It's usually very flavorful, but this time it was bland.  I still enjoyed it with salt&pepper. Jambalaya & Chicken Fried Steak (nice portions) - our go-to meals when we can't decide.   The one time we were not happy with the service was when: - we waited 15min for a waitress and 20min for water - then, received our appetizer and meal at the same time (we sent the meal back) - but, the food was good (because we asked her to make us a fresh batch, not just holding it under a heat lamp)  Overall, we are still a fan."
Rachel T.,"Fillmore, CA",0,14,4,5.0,6/28/2016,"I had the pleasure of dining here last night. Not only does this place have stellar views of the Peak/Front Range, they have an incredibly hard working and kind staff! I was greeted by a lovely hostess who was so pleasant and friendly. I was seated promptly and my server, Kathryn, was very knowledgeable and sweet! I could tell she was busy but she took the time to answer my questions about a few different menu items I couldn't choose between, and she did so with a smile on her face and without making me feel like she had somewhere else to be. I definitely feel like she genuinely cared about my dining experience. The icing on the cake was meeting the Manager, Burt. He came over to introduce himself and even chatted for a few minutes. I really enjoyed and appreciated the personal touch this team brought to my evening and I can't wait to return in the very near future!"
Manny D.,"Hollywood, FL",0,7,,2.0,1/21/2017,If you want a sports bar and poor service than I highly recommend.  Have eaten here too many times even after the food was below average and so was the service.  The menu is huge with many options but on too many occasions the food has come out cold or undercooked.  The management seem content with the set up.  They have a large dinner crowd and enough out of town guests to stay busy.  Too many other restaurants offering a higher quality product are all around the city.  My advice is to decide what food you are in the mood for and go to a restaurant whose menu isn't larger than the phone book and where the service is up to par and so is the food.
Amisha R.,"Corpus Christi, TX",76,68,59,2.0,4/20/2016,"My husband and I love going to BJ's. This location disappointed us. They seemed to be understaffed. The lady serving us was great, but we felt like she was running around like a chicken with a smile on her face. Someone needs to hire more people to run this place instead of overworking their employees. The pan pizza was the only thing that tasted like what is offered at other BJ's locations. Ordered the chicken taco, hot and spicy buffalo wings, and my favorite stuffed mushrooms. Wasn't too happy with the last three dishes. I took a to-go box with hopes to finish the food at home since we are totally against the idea of throwing away food. It was sad that I couldn't finish the wings since they were so sour, they were not palatable. We went on a Friday evening. If a restaurant chain can't serve well on their peak days, what should you expect?"
Bob G.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,6,,5.0,4/11/2015,"We ordered through   and had it delivered to our house so can't comment on the wait staff, only the food 15 minutes after it was packaged.   I highly recommend using this delivery service btw.  If you don't feel like going out and don't feel like cooking, this is a great alternative.   Anyway,  to the food.   Not sure why all the negative reviews on the food.   We got: Fried artichokes --  really really good.   Crunchy with a tangy dipping sauce.  I could eat those all day.  Ahi Poke --  I moved to Colorado from Hawaii so it's not really fair to compare.   I will say it's good Colorado poke.  I'd get it again.  Caesar Salad -- Good salad with homemade croutons.  Watermelon and Feta salad -- Simply amazing.  Get extra dressing.  That stuff is like salad crack. Lasagna --  Not a traditional lasagna.   Lots of sausage,  tasty sauce and cheese.   Tender and chewy noodles, awesome taste,  and like I said, heavy on the sausage.   If you're looking for mama's lasagna,  this ain't it.   But, OMG, it's good.  Old Country Tomato Basil Pizza --  I really liked this.   Simple,  but good texture on the crust and really good flavor.  I have nothing bad to say about this food.  It was tasty and we'll definately be getting it again.   Not being able to comment on service,  I have to give it 5 stars."
