Kayleigh K.,"Colorado Springs, CO",94,9,5,5.0,8/21/2015,"Tonight we were reminded of why we love BJ's so much. After my last review I was contacted by the General manager, Jason, who was extremely accommodating and eager to remedy the problem that we previously experienced. This has always been one of our favorite spots and where we took our son to celebrate his 5th birthday last year. We have been to BJ's more frequently than any other restaurant in the springs and we will continue to do so after tonight. The service was spot on and the food was HEAVENLY. I'm so impressed that they took the time to make things right with us because not a lot of places do that. There is not one bad thing I could say about the experience we had tonight and I look forward to many more good times here!"
Rick B.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,4,3,5.0,7/11/2016,I've ordered several orders through Springs delivery their food is fantastic I like everything I've gotten from them pizza burgers potato skin wedge salad I would recommend them to anyone. I should probably go to the restaurant the food probably better without the delivery delay
Chessaria M.,"Colorado Springs, CO",68,15,1,5.0,3/4/2016,"My husband and I eat here often. While it can be a little loud, the food makes up for that. There is always something on their menu to try. We especially love their pizookies! I would heartily recommend this to any one looking for a new place to eat."
Kris I.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,6,,5.0,7/4/2016,It can be crowded and a wait to get a table at times but its completely worth it their soups are good and their roast beef sandwich are the best i love this place
Don A.,"Colorado Springs, CO",14,183,13,3.0,3/8/2015,"Food is reasonable for a chain. The waiters are always nice and helpful. The problem is always the bar...I have been here a dozen times and it always takes 20 minutes to get a drink, all the bar tenders simply don't hustle."
Kelley D.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,19,,4.0,6/13/2016,"Overall the experience was enjoyable. We sat at a table instead of a booth which we prefer. However I noticed that most of the booths were occupied and I just went with the table. Our server seemed rushed as she was always walking rapialy around the dining area, would talk to us as she walked passed our table, not stop and actually tall to us. When we got our pizza, it was the wrong size. We didn't send it back or order another one, but we didn't leave full. Not overly concerned with what went wrong tonight. Food was good. Service was exceptional."
Britt M.,"Colorado Springs, CO",13,1,1,5.0,5/29/2016,I am so irritated with my situation. We got served RAW chicken!!! Don't eat here! Manager took care of our bill but showed no simpathy that we ate RAW chicken. They serve raw chicken to their guests! Will never return to this place ever!
Kimberly I.,"Colorado Springs, CO",63,41,80,5.0,4/6/2015,"Ashley H was a great server. She was attentive, gave great recommendations and helped me have a great birthday! I had the PM Porter, which was a delicious nitro porter. Also the Parmesan Chicken and the Salted Caramel Pizookie. The meal was great, all but the beer was based on the recommendation of Our waitress. She was attentive enough but not overly. It was a great experience. I will definitely come back! Recommended for birthdays!"
Ryan C.,"Aurora, CO",1,36,1,1.0,5/30/2015,"Sat at the bar with co worker for dinner and bar area was not cleaned off from someone else before nor was it cleaned off when we sat down or when we left. To the food: I had the buffalo burger which was dry and tasteless. The slaw side was soggy and uneatable like it had been sitting in liquid over night or all day.  Root beer was good though.  Coworker ordered Fish which was unimpressive. Fish tasted frozen and not fresh.   I have been to other locations of this establishment in Colorado, Texas, and a few other states and have to say this place food and cleanliness was the worst. This chain or franchise is not run properly and should close. I told my coworker that the food in the other Bjs were good but boy was I wrong about this one.  Won't be coming here again poorly run chain place!"
Layla C.,"Canyon Country, CA",0,12,1,1.0,10/9/2016,"So I ate here with my two small children and my husband last night and had the worst restaurant experience ever!!! My husband ordered a steak, I ordered a French dip WITHOUT onions and my kids had pizza and grilled cheese. Once all the food arrived I realized that there were grilled onions on my food that I couldn't remove since they were all stuck in the cheese. I told the waitress and she asked me if I wanted another one and said that she would tell the manager and have it removed from my bill and then she walked away. 15 minutes later she comes back to the table and my husband asked her if she put another  sandwich in and she said that no she didn't because I said that I didn't want one which is untrue she never gave me a chance to answer before she ran off! So I just told her to forget about the sandwich and can I please just have a salad and she left again 10 minutes later I asked her if she put the salad in yet and she said no but that her manager had taken the sandwich off of our bill and then my husband and I told her we were ready to leave we don't want anything else just give us the bill. Then he asked if we were charged for the children's chocolate milk's which we never received and they said no they're part of the meal and he said well we didn't get them! So all in all they only charge just for my husband's dinner I ended up eating a couple bites of my daughters pizza and a few french fries and we left! Complete waste of our one night out together! Such a bummer"
Matt T.,"Woodland Park, CO",0,3,,1.0,5/15/2016,"A mere shadow of the original BJ's in SoCal and a lousy version of Chicago style pizza.  I grew up eating at BJ's and the pizza I had the other night was nothing like those pies..it was lightweight, thin for a deep-dish pizza and the crust was tasteless and dry.  A true Chicago style pizza will satisfy even the heartiest of appetites with a couple of pieces... my 5' 95 lb girlfriend, her 60 lb son and myself finished an entire large pie and wished we had ordered an appetizer.  Finally...finished the while meal and never once had anyone ask if I needed a refill..super pet peeve."
Megan A.,"Peyton, CO",38,7,1,4.0,5/11/2016,I had the ahi tuna salad and it was amazing! We had calamari for the appetizer and it was good as well. The margarita was FANTASTIC! Everyone in our party of 8 enjoyed their food! Service was great and it was mothers day so it was kinda busy. We Will try again in the future!
Chelsie Y.,"Colorado Springs, CO",92,6,,5.0,5/9/2016,My family and I love going to BJ`s. They have such an extensive menu with something for everyone. The service had always been good and the food even better.
Lacey J.,"Vail, AZ",0,11,1,5.0,4/30/2016,"Standard BJs...FABULOUS!! Great food, endless choices and awesome drink specials! The staff was friendly and made excellent suggestions! Always a great go to restaurant!"
Terry W.,"Colorado Springs, CO",31,224,,3.0,5/24/2013,Decent place. Food was pretty good and the staff was very attentive. It just wasn't great by any means and for the price I expected allot more. The parking at this location sucks if you go on the weekend.  It doesn't warrant me trying it again.
Jason W.,"Colorado Springs, CO",5,5,2,2.0,8/14/2016,"The food is consistently good. That's where the two stars come from. We came in November and the service was slow and uninterested. We waited until the following August to try again. We have a daughter with food allergies and she is able to have the vanilla cream soda and root beer. Unfortunately despite arriving at open and being one of 2 tables seated in the restaurant it took nearly 10 minutes for someone to approach the table. When our server did arrive she informed us that they were out of the vanilla syrup required for the vanilla cream soda and the root beer lines were frozen. When we asked about whether the orange cream had dye in it the response was a shoulder shrug and ""orange maybe?"" Five minutes later when she came back to see where we were with the drink discussion we had to ask her to check on whether there was dye in the orange cream. She brought the manager over to tell us that there is dye. My wife and I used to be servers at another chain type restaurant and we know what to look for. This was an unacceptable experience. We will likely not be back except for a growler of root beer. If they ever get their lines unfrozen."
Deb G.,"Colorado Springs, CO",59,531,63,3.0,12/14/2014,"Two visits so far..... first one was great.  On a very busy evening, we sat in the bar and enjoyed great service and really good food;  mozzarella sticks for an appetizer, followed by mahi mahi tacos (lightly battered) & parmesan crusted chicken.  Everything was delicious and served warm & promptly.  Left very happy and glad to have a friendly face we knew well from the Dallas area.   Second visit...... a disaster!   Went for lunch on a Saturday and again sat in the bar (which is open seating, so no waiting, and we like the booths).  The restaurant was nowhere as busy as the evening service, but they had a fair crowd.   But, our waitress and the cooks let us down - big time.   Our waitress was nice, but very slow.   But to sum up the experience, after waiting for our food longer than others who arrived after us, we had to remind our waitress to check on our food and pretty much we were served cold, poorly cooked food and I then I had to wait for the sauce I had requested (at the time of my order) for my BJ's burger.   When the sauce finally did arrive, it was not what I requested, but we were hungry so I just went with it.   However, by this time my burger was really cold - you know the kind.... the cheese has returned to it's natural state - that being solid!   Hubs had a salmon salad, with fish overcooked, cold and dry and brussel sprouts that were inedible - hard as a brick.   Needless to say, our waitress was only interested in how quickly she could get us checked out and who knows what was going on in the kitchen.   Now, first you must know, I'm a very good tipper, have a lot of patience, and it takes a lot for me to leave NOTHING - which is exactly what was received for today's service/meal.    Don't know if we will return any time soon or if ever :("
Michael W.,"Colorado Springs, CO",117,55,83,4.0,6/15/2013,"Hard to go wrong when you have good beer. BJs is pretty popular and located in a nice restaurant area. The atmosphere is always lively when me and my wife go, which is usually on the weekend. The bar is always lit up and for the most part the staff is friendly. Been to this location a handful of times and have never had a bad experience. The beer selection is good, and BJs brews are very tasty. I like the seasonal beers they have and how they rotate them. Food is always on par; favorites include the blonde ale shrimp, pot roast sandwich, the pizzas and you can't pass up on the Oreo pazookie!!!  On another note we came here last night for my wife's birthday and had a fairly large party of 12. Other than being shorted 2 seats, the evening went well and the waitress Aubrey took great care of us.  This place has the food, has the drinks, and for the most part a staff to pull it all together. Solid 4 stars"
Jim L.,"Monument, CO",64,55,25,4.0,1/25/2016,"Consistantly good, tried the queso, .99 for guac, literally a tiny ramekin of guac, silly,  don't do it.  Queso is also terrible, tastes like cheese whiz.  Soup and sandwich was good."
Melody D.,"Colorado Springs, CO",60,27,2,3.0,2/8/2016,"There were four of us for dinner the other night, and we arrived early, at 4:30, as we had somewhere to be a little later.  I was looking forward to it, as I've eaten at BJs in other cities, and had great experiences.  The restaurant was very empty.  When the hostess went to sit us in the a small table in the middle of the isle, I asked if we could please have a booth just a few steps away instead.  Although she acquiesced, her reply was snotty and she told me I needed to ask at the hostess stand.  This was accompanied by an eye roll.  The waiter had to be asked several times for water and a box, and we kinda got the feeling we were bothering him.  Additionally, when we sat, the blinds were low.  After, someone raised them, and the sun was shining right in the eyes of two people in the booth.  We asked if they could lower them, which they did, but every few minutes another staff member would go back and raise them again, only to be asked to lower them again.  This happened four times in less than five minutes.   As we were leaving, my friend asked to speak to whomever oversaw the hostesses.  Imagine our surprise when the hostess who saw us is the one to whom we were directed.  She presented herself as the manager until the actual manager walked up, at which time she corrected her title to the supervisor of the hostesses.  My friend explained our issue with how we were treated in the beginning, but had a hard time finishing as the hostess kept interrupting to tell us how she wasn't rude and just needed to be clear.  To his credit, the manager seemed to take our complaint seriously. What keeps this from being a one star experience was that most of the food was decent.  Two of us had the Ahi salad, and found the ahi to be a little less than fresh, although the rest of the salad was excellent.  My friend's buffalo burger and my husbands flat bread pizza were delicious, as were the egg rolls and calamari we ordered as an appetizer.   I sincerely doubt any of us will return to this particular restaurant. UPDATE - The manager called and gave a very sincere apology.  I was pretty impressed.  Additionally, he did everything he could to make things right, including giving me his personal cell number to make our next reservation.  Every business will have off days, but how they handle it matters.  He certainly did his best, and I'm very impressed.  No one has ever gone to these lengths to make me happy again."
