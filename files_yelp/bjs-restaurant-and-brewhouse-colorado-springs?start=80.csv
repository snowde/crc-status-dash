Brig A.,"Colorado Springs, CO",24,164,3,2.0,8/28/2014,"The reviews for this place are pretty much spot on.  If you go here, be prepared to be overwhelmed by the menu (this is like the Jack in the Box) of Chili's style restaurants. The strange thing is that their descriptions of the items in the menu make you not want to order anything.   Then be prepared to have average to below average service and finally be prepared for the food to be good, but to have something isn't quite right with it. Case in point, I really felt like a burger, but decided to do the buffalo burger and save some calories.  The burger was good, the chili was good, but the bun was strangely wet in some spots and rock hard in other parts.  I never knew what I was going to be eating.  I also substituted a salad for the cole slaw.  What was funny is the only thing that came on my plate was the burger.  Normally you at least get some kind of eye candy with your meals.  This was just not the case for this place. I have been to here a few times, I got tacos and the tortilla was hard.  I got fish and chips and they were way to greasy."
Sigrid P.,"Fountain, CO",0,13,,1.0,5/17/2015,"I have just returned from BJ's and to say I am disappointed would be high praise!! I had the "" Fish-Tacos "" and they were THE worst I have ever had. I cannot say I tasted them, since I could NOT do that : they had no taste. I had maybe at most a sliver of fish which I though had gone bad, the cabbage was a mess of a teaspoon of chopped lettuce and something I could not identify....crunchy cabbage it was not. The worst of it was, it was ice cold. I ordered a side of thin fries with the beer, since I was still hungry, we waited 35 min for the food. All I can say : NEVER again!!!  Want fish tacos.....not here.  YUCK!!"
Chris P.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,3,,2.0,1/10/2016,"Four of us came in for lunch today for my mom's birthday.  The wait was about 30 minutes after that we were seated at a booth. We ordered our food it took a very long time will salad had brown lettuce and the entree were  cold like they sat under a heating lamp. My parents are regulars, but were very disappointed. The service was not good today. I am sure they will be back in the future."
Mike D.,"West Hollywood, CA",8,196,429,2.0,10/20/2015,I probably made a mistake by ordering a pizza here. I had a deep dish vegetarian and it was not that good at all. The pizza dough  and crust  was dry and tasteless .  The toppings weren't all that terrible  but they were not evenly distributed on top of  the pizza Should have probably stayed with a burger or something like that in a place like this. More disturbing was the service. The place wasn't that busy and I was in the area where other people were being served so it wasn't an isolated situation. Once I was seated it took a long time for someone to come over and ask if I wanted anything. Once I ordered it took a long time for the pizza to arrive. When I asked for my check it took a long time for that to come as well. It may have been an off night for them or maybe they were just under staffed.
Nicholas B.,"Meridianville, AL",21,112,37,4.0,6/19/2014,"I ate there last night (6/18/14)with an old friend. My old friend happened to be the corporate trainer for BJs Brewhouse chain doing her check ups. This review is based solely on my experience with the food, obviously with her I got the best service.  The menu is large with plenty of drink/food/dessert choices. Their plentiful beers on tap were more then I could handle so I went with the cocktails. I went for the Snackbite which is Guinness&Pear Cider, WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT!!! The flavors married up nicely. I'm a Guinness Stout guy in my personal life so needless to say I loved it. My 2nd drink was the BJs Jack Daniels Berry Lemonade, I'm a religious JD drinker so anything new, I'm going to try. It's basically a Lynchburg Lemondade with the fruity berry flavor.  For appetizer we had the Corn Fritters with Bacon Aiolli. These were tasty, not full of corn in the fritter and the dough was pizza doughy. Bits of jalapeno inside but def not overpowering. Good flavor from frying. I could have gone for a dipping sauce but all in all, I'd order it again  My main course was the Jalapeno Burger with steak fries. What can I say, I love burgers. It's a grilled patty with pepperjack cream cheese, chipotle mayo and some other sauces that give it that kick. Personally I would have gone for more jalapenos but the over all flavor and appearance was good. You could taste the smoke from the grilling that just made it more enjoyable. I should have gone for the thin cut fries personally. Lesson learned.  For dessert we had the Pizookie Trio. I just thought it was ice cream but it was a fresh baked cookie with a scoop of ice cream. Three friggen choices of ice creams was overwhelming, so we did Oreo, Triple Choco Ghiradellis and Peanut Butter. Sugar rush galore, if you love love love chocolate I recommend the triple choco ghiradellis. Cause underneath is a chocolate cookie.  All in all, I enjoyed it. The server was attentive, but again I was with the corporate rep. But the guy was nice and helped with recommendations, hopefully I'll order the jambalaya next time and try more of the beers."
Laura C.,"Colorado Springs, CO",1,92,18,2.0,1/18/2017,"Went to BJs recently on a weeknight after the holidays. We were not expecting it to be so packed. We saw a table in the bar open up, so we grabbed it as the folks left, realizing that it wasn't cleared yet. We waited for a busses or waitstaff to clear it, and waited and waited. Finally a waitress came over and asked to take our order! We were not at all ready to order; we had just sat for 15-20 minutes with the prior customers' dirty dishes in our faces! She said she could just get our order started and then clear the table. ?? Strange way to do business. We finally got it cleared and washed off with one of those really slimy bar rags, and we got a drink, and immediately our table in the dining area was ready. Our waitress there made up for the bad service in the bar, and we told her so, but our food was just ok, and by then we were pretty turned off. Won't hurry back, there are other great choices nearby."
Mila G.,"Arvada, CO",249,476,32,2.0,6/20/2014,"I'll preface this one by saying the food is great. The drinks are great. The atmosphere is great. The service is really awkward and uncomfortable. Our waiter began the meal by spouting off tons of information about the menu, and talking to us like we had no idea how to read. He also stated that he knew everything that was good on the menu and was the expert on good food there. When he came back to take our orders, he criticized our choices and tried to convince us to get something else. At the end of the meal he started telling us about his kids, and how he knows he doesn't look his age, and he doesn't act his age. He was boasting to us about how young he thinks he looks!  We were embarrassed for our out-of-town guests."
Suzanne S.,"Westminster, CO",14,12,43,5.0,10/13/2015,"Having fun lunch using a buy one get one entrée free coupon received via email.  Both the 'enlighten' entree we ordered were fabulous.  The Mahi Mahi shrimp was deliciously flavored with capers, black olives and (I think)anise seeds.  Wow, a surprisingly wonderful sate.  It's new to the menu, but hope it becomes a favorite as it is mine!"
Dory H.,"Colorado Springs, CO",29,42,1,1.0,12/30/2015,"Overrated, bad service, sub par food. Probably not going back after an awful experience with a server that didn't want to deal with us. I alerted the hostess up front of our poor experience and she didn't care as well."
Mayra A.,"Ewa Beach, HI",25,33,25,4.0,10/26/2015,Went for the first time to BJ's and while the wait for food and drink are horrendous the Hawaiian Mahi Mahi pared with half Blondie/half Lemonade was the most delicious thing I ever tasted and paired. It even makes up for the wait for the beer. My husband had the Amber Oasis which he liked a lot but the Salmon with quinoa did not pair well with it. He was very disappointed. Went ahead and ordered the salted caramel mini pizookie which was delicious if a little too salty but DID NOT go with either my Blondie/lemonade or my husbands Amber Oasis. All in all great entree but the wait and certain pairing mean I am going to take away a star. Hopefully they can work on their timing more. Will come back soon.
Annie B.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,11,,2.0,7/27/2016,"We took my daughter out for her 21st birthday - a party of 4 on Sunday at 7pm. The place itself is nice looking, the hostess was nice and told us we'd just have to wait a few minutes for a booth. We sat down, the server took our drink orders. Daughter ordered an Alabama Sunset and a water, husband a beer and daughter's boyfriend a Dr. Pepper. I ordered a Pink Cadillac. We wait, and server eventually comes back to say they are ""out"" of Pink Cadillacs. Hmmm. I order an Alabama Sunset. We wait, and she comes back with one cocktail, one beer and one soda. We wait more and she brings the other cocktail. We order our food, and daughter has to ask for water. The Alabama Sunset was in a large drink glass filled to the rim with ice. I drank it down in about 5 minutes, There could not have been more than 2/3 cup of liquid in the glass. I am a major lightweight that gets buzzy from one beer. From this, nothing.  I didn't discern any alcohol at all. We finally got our food, and all I can say is- meh. The burger was tasteless- I even tried to salt it to make it a bit tastier. The wedge fried were good - they were ""out"" of crispy fries. I got halfway through and just didn't want any more. Everyone else said their food was ok - nothing great, but nothing really bad either. They did give daughter a free cookie dessert for her bday, which was nice. Bill was $105 (with tip) for four entrees, a soda, two ""cocktails"" and 2 beers. No salads with entrees, BTW. Maybe our server was new, and that's why it was so uneven, but I just can't see paying that much for such blah food and drinks again."
Ron L.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,4,,2.0,7/25/2016,"Got there and requested a table and were told 15-20 minutes, which turned out to be over 30 minutes. There were 5 of us, we were seated at a table for 4 with a chair on the end which put me into the aisle with people walking by bumping me constantly. Put in our order and waited 40 minutes for the food to arrive, during which time the server and the manager came by and apologized multiple times without us complaining about the wait. Food was marginal, I ordered the ""late night burger"" which was advertised as ""smothered"" with chile verde, when it arrived there was barely any on it, certainly not smothered. I sent the server back for more twice before it was acceptable. Then the gift card I had was run incorrectly so I had to pay cash out of pocket for no reason. I won't go back to BJ's at any point in the future. Not worth the trouble or expense."
Kamarra F.,"Colorado Springs, CO",8,20,2,5.0,9/7/2015,"Love this place! We had the Carnitas fries, BBQ chicken deep dish and the peanut butter smores dessert. The homebrew sodas were excellent and the staff really went the extra mile for our table."
Erik S.,"Monument, CO",1,8,2,1.0,7/17/2016,"I sit here with my family, we waited for 15 mins to get our drinks and food ordered, two tables of customers got up and left because they had not even got their order placed.  After we ordered took 15 mins for our beer to arrive and 25 mins in my daughters choc milk has yet to arrive.   And of course our food is no where to be seen yet.  BAD SERVICE.  Cant rate food yet since it has not shown up."
Jenn B.,"Colorado Springs, CO",1,6,,1.0,11/11/2015,"We went for lunch and after telling us that there would be a 25 minute wait, we waited 50 minutes. Our food was not even that good. It was cold. All of our burgers were overdone. I wouldn't go there again."
Jonathan B.,"Colorado Springs, CO",70,390,5,3.0,12/12/2012,"I had been to several BJ's locations before and I was not all that excited about returning.  I was really surprised by this place. The food was good, the service was fast.  The bar scene was hopping.  I couldn't believe how busy it was.  While we were waiting for a table, a waitress brought around little bites of pizza for those of us waiting.  It was a nice treat. My 3-star rating is more about my preconceived notions rather than my experience.  If I go back and have another good experience, I will bump it up.  The menu was big, the food was all really good, and the atmosphere was energizing."
Spiro T.,"Santa Maria, CA",117,237,277,2.0,4/22/2012,"Quality control has taken a nosedive as of late.  The previous time, they burned our cod twice.  Finally, they got it right the third time and comped us the entree as an apology.  No problem, things happen, but.....  This time, our pizza came out cold.  I sent it back to get reheated and they comped it.  Still wasn't thrilled with sending back food because I always wonder if they would do something to it.  Also, our rack of ribs were dry and not flavorful.  Although they always comp the screwed up food, I'm not returning because it's a shame to have problems every time.  Look at my check-ins.  I've been there plenty of times, got the duke title, posted several pics of their food, etc.   I'm speaking from experience here and it's a shame because the food is good when they get it right.  So-long, BJs."
Don T.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,11,,4.0,12/21/2014,"Went there for dinner last week and enjoyed it.  The food was very good and the beers were pretty good too. There is a wide selection of brews that they make.  The descriptions are very good and describe each beer well. On the food side everything was very fresh.  Yes, it's bar food.  But it's well thought out and a wide variety.  Something for everyone."
Joe P.,"Colorado Springs, CO",1,44,11,5.0,5/23/2016,"The best thick pizza I ever had, whether its plain or itemized.  Even beats Old Chicago!! Med tacos are good too!"
