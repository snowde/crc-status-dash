Athena B.,"Millersville, MD",68,126,57,4.0,12/14/2017,"Came here for work holiday lunch and had great service. I believe our waitress' name was Natasha, and she was very attentive and friendly. There was another lady who came out to bring our food, and one of the guests in our party ordered a steak and when she handed him his food, she asked if he could cut a piece of his steak to ensure it was cooked to his liking. I've never seen a restaurant staff member ask a question like that, and I love that she did! They definitely went above and beyond and for the service and quality of food, they get 5 stars!! The 4 stars is only because of the seating they have for large parties. It may have been because there was a really large party (looked like 15 people) taking up all the tables where I guess they could accommodate larger parties, but we only had 5 people and they crammed us in a booth that was really meant for 4 adults. Most big restaurants like this tend to have those semi-circle booths for larger parties, but they don't have that here. All tables seem to fit only 4 people, unless they put tables together (which that other party took all of). So I just wish they could accommodate larger parties better (being that we weren't even much of a large party and felt crammed), but other than that, this place is great!"
Allison F.,"Columbia, MD",9,24,5,2.0,12/15/2017,"Not sure why this is so popular--the two times I've eaten here the service has taken a while (really--last time it was 20 minutes before they took our drink order) and the food was mediocre.  The beer isn't bad, with a good selection of BJ's branded and guest brews on tap.  You want better food and many beers on draft? There are better options right down the street."
T. H.,"Gwynn Oak, MD",4,35,171,3.0,11/19/2017,"We came here for dinner after a day of pre Thanksgiving shopping. I've eaten here before, just not at this location. We were seated immediately even though it was a packed house. Our Waiter Terrell was nice, but not that attentive, I think he was in the weeds being it was kinda busy. We ordered the Beer BBQ Wings and Meatballs for appetizers. The Wings were cooked too hard and the Meatballs were bland, tasted like Salisbury Steak don't think I'll order those again. Main entree I got half rack Baby Back Ribs they were ok could of been a little more tender, with Lettuce Wedge and French Fries that were cold and tasted old. The Hubby got Prime Rib with String Beans which were (RAW) and Rice Pilaf which was ok. We also got the Monkey Bread with Vanilla Ice Cream for dessert which was good. Overall, it wasn't the best, but I'll give them another try in a few months being though this location just opened."
Erin B.,"Highland, MD",43,182,103,2.0,10/23/2017,"Dear Jim of BJ's who keeps addressing new reviews but neither of my other two- Your service is still as awful as it was when you opened several months ago. I returned for a birthday dinner early October and our alcoholic drinks arrived the same time as the food (which still took too long). ""Sorry our bartender is backed up""....yeah I heard that story the 11 other times I've visited (see: Yelp check ins and BJ's account) . I asked for a side of garlic knots and when the waitress didn't bring them out, I said to remove it from the check because I didn't want to wait for them. Her response: ""Oh yeah, I forgot to put those in.""  I now have hundreds of BJ's reward points that I want to light on fire because it's pointless to come back here when nothing improves. Duchess out."
Connie L.,"Washington, DC",651,435,1155,4.0,9/28/2017,I like this place. Their beers are great! Love the seasonal Oktoberfest and their red ale is the best! I always get the same beers because they are so good!  Brussels sprouts - yum  Their burgers- double YUM  and their churro dessert - more YUM!  Definitely not healthy by any means but worth it
Carroll N.,"Columbia, MD",52,69,223,5.0,9/16/2017,We came back for the Prime Rib and loved it. It was moist and flavorful. Also I recall seeing that the mini pizookie is now offered on the menu. 9/22/17 - Today came back for my husband's bday. I tried mini pizza. It was fluffy. The flavor tasted similar to Pizza Hut's pan pizza. Tip: Check BJ's website. They frequently offer coupons.
Nancy C.,"Columbia, MD",3,121,,4.0,12/21/2017,"My burger and fries were great, dessert was disappointing.  I got the salted caramel mini pie/cookie thing, and it tasted like they used normal caramel and salted the cookie.  I love salty food, and it was too much for me.  My Paloma tasted like a margarita- more tequila than grapefruit.  But I can't really complain about a strong drink.  It was good, just not what I was expecting."
Savannah L.,"Mount Hope, KS",20,1,,5.0,1/8/2018,"Wow, what an experience! Not only was our server amazing and attentive, but the happy hour is best by far. It was pretty busy when we came but the server communicated well and our food actually came out at a pretty decent time. Me and my husband decided to split 2 entrees and Terrell went above and beyond to split each one for us without asking. It's refreshing to to see great customer service like we had. Overall we had great deals, delicious spaghetti (literally to die for) and outstanding service. Coming from Dallas, Tx where we had such a wide range variety of restaurants , I'm definitely satisfied with this one."
Gregory B.,"Capitol Heights, MD",137,208,166,5.0,10/16/2017,"Great Restaurant but Need Reimbursement for Socks Intro/Atmosphere:  My fit friend told me about BJ's and raved about the pizookie.  I knew if she would spend her calories on some junk it had to be worth it.  So, I wasted no time in going to this place the very same day. I really like the atmosphere of BJ's.  There's a bit of a sports theme, but it serves well as a family restaurant.  It has a vast American menu that can accommodate everyone. Food:  I'm not a burger guy, but I got the hickory brisket and bacon burger with fries.  The flavors were absolutely great.  The hickory mixed with the bacon hit the spot and the bread was just flawless.   I followed it up with a monkey bread pizookie.  You know... (serious moment) it's very rare that you find something that actually supersedes expectation these days.  I came here expecting this pizookie to be excellent and it still managed to blow my socks off.  Seriously, has anyone seen my socks?  It was sooo good.  The soft, warm, and flavorful monkey bread combined with that vanilla ice cream was immaculate.  And it was only $3!!!  I'm glad there is no BJ's close to me because I would be a sad, obese, sock-less man messing around with these pizookies.   Customer Service:  The customer service was outstanding.  My server was pleasant.  My food came fast.  My server went the extra mile because my phone died and I needed directions on how to go to Autobahn raceway.  She looked up the directions and wrote them out by hand for me.  I wish I remembered her name. She's the real MVP. Conclusion:  It's rare that a chain restaurant can earn 5 stars, but I love everything about BJ's.  I eyeballed a lot of people's plates and all of the food looks good.  Anytime I'm in the neighborhood, I'll make it a point to visit."
Ma-e M.,"Baltimore County, MD",0,1416,569,4.0,11/1/2017,This is newly built BJ's and it was my first time. It feels like the Uno Chicago restaurant in Ellicott. The food is what you expect from a franchise restaurant.
Anastasia T.,"Glen Burnie, MD",399,503,303,3.0,11/29/2017,"I'll say it -- I don't like chain breweries and therefore, I rarely frequent them. We went on Veteran's Day, because they seemed like the most promising option. There was a 30 minute wait, but I grabbed my wife and I a couple beers and we chilled. The time went by pretty fast until we got seated. I can't really blame our server, because they were clearly slammed. I must've waited close to 30 minutes for the bowl of soup I ordered and when it finally came out, there was no spoon. I sat for another 10-15 minutes waiting to flag him down to ask for something to eat my soup with. The dish itself was good, but at that point kind of cold.  Their beer selection was a little of the meh side if you're really into craft beer. They had some Chimay and a couple of different semi-interesting local selections, but not much aside from that. Their full bar seemed far more impressive."
Demond S.,"Silver Spring, MD",108,191,387,4.0,9/10/2017,"First time  visiting this chain. Decor was very nice. Spacious location. A very nice bar area with several high tops so this is definitely a place you can get a good meal, drinks, and watch the games. Had two dishes, Ahi Tuna on a green salad with rice wine vinaigrette and  the New Orleans Jambalaya. The salad was excellent. Lite and gently sweet with the rice wine vinaigrette. The jambalaya, I would probably drop the ""New Orleans"" and just call it Jambalaya. It was spicy, but very good. Was not as rich as the version Cheescake has, so this was more enjoyable. There are 30 beers on tap. You can't go wrong here."
Aubrey F.,"Baltimore, MD",28,188,220,5.0,7/8/2017,"Such a great place! So many food and drink options. The staff has always been great and friendly. The service has also always been great. Our waitress was very attentive and checked on our frequently and made sure we were enjoying our food.  On Mondays the special is half off large pizzas. I ordered a Great White, which has grilled chicken breast, alfredo sauce, mushrooms, roasted garlic, Parmesan cheese, and seasoned tomatoes. I'm not a fan of chicken so I swapped it out for applewood smoked bacon. Sometimes they charge you for this, even though it would seem it is an even swap, and sometimes they don't. I also added black olives and a pesto drizzle. It is a huge pizza but I had leftovers for several days, which I love leftovers so I don't mine. Reheats great in the oven.  So many great choices! I hear if you are a beer lover they also have a lot of great beers to try!"
Ric P.,"Severn, MD",388,311,2378,4.0,9/3/2017,"Yes ... I am a fan!  The ribs are excellent.  The Southern Comfort is fantastic and no, this isn't a drink... it's a Chicken sandwich.  BJ's makes their own Root Bier and Cream Soda; both are really good.  Everything I've ordered has been Delish and the staff is friendly and know their food.  You can't go wrong in visiting BJ's."
Adesuwa O.,"Baltimore, MD",187,3,2,3.0,1/4/2018,"My drink was nice. Really liked it. However I can't lie the avocado rolls were very subpar compared to the ones I had at another restaurant and the ones I made at home. It's hard for me not to finish my good bc well I love food and will eat just about anything. It was a struggle to finish these.. it was just an appetizer anyway but it discouraged me from getting an entree, so I know nothing about that. however the drink was really good."
Jennifer M.,"Baltimore, MD",74,161,215,3.0,6/4/2017,"Now there are tons of restaurants in this area, so something new should not have so many iffy reviews. My 3 stars is for the service. Once we got someone to the table all was well....but I think a reevaluation of how many servers are there during a busy lunch hour is needed.  In the shopping center where Target is located, BJs isn't hard to find. Friendly servers, just not enough. The menu is extensive and can be overwhelming. They have tons of options which can make it hard to choose. Healthy options always make me smile.  I ordered a strawberry lemonade, very refreshing. I had couscous Mac and cheese, also very good and chessy. And I also ordered the BBQ chopped salad. I love how it was prepared. I would return and order the same things over again, but there is so much to try.  I'll return some time in the near future and hopefully be able to give a higher rating."
Ericka G.,"Columbia, MD",260,419,1625,2.0,3/22/2017,"This was my first visit to the Columbia location as I had previously visited Laurel and one in Orange County California.  Upon entry, I was greeted by a very handsome tall gentleman with dark hair. He walked me to my table. He was very genuine, gave great eye contact, was engaging.... I wish I caught his name. As simple as that interaction was, in business, you'll go far.  My server Sierra S, later approaches and takes my order. Sierra, I noticed is rushed with me. Her interaction, very odd.... she however is undivided & engaging to the point of inappropriateness with the table of 4 aged men to my left. My service was more an after thought and distracted.  My Orange cream soda arrives sans a straw. I don't mention it as I was curious as to how vigilant my serve would prove to be. I additionally ordered the ahi poke. The wonton chips were overcooked, very close to being burnt. The dish although plated was flavorless. No salt, no soy ginger. No lime. Probably the worst I've ever had. I said nothing. It was clear my chips were burnt and were not in a state that should be served... the line cook served then anyway, the delivery server, served them anyway, even my server saw them, said nothing. That tells you the level of respect they have of the food they serve and to whom....  I also order the tomato bisque in the sourdough bread bowl. The bowl is overcooked. The bowl was not gutted properly so, its bowl only contained maybe 2-3 oz of the soup. The rest being the bread that they were too lazy to pull.  As I'm eating my soup, (it's about 9:30p, they close at midnight). I'm rushed into deciding if I want a dessert and choosing one. Prior to this, my receipt was already placed at my table. I was pretty much shoved out the door from the second I sit down. I refuse dessert as the sizes are too big. I'd prefer the option of purchasing on mini dessert instead of a trio. The check... I don't touch the check until I'm completely finished with my meal. I hadn't seen it at this point. She notices from afar that she did not swipe my card properly and charged me some obscure amount. It takes some time to get the manager to adjust the charge. She then tells me I could leave and they would correct the charge at the end of the night. My server has proven to be less than vigilant and so thus too was not a surprise..... I informed her I paid with a Corporate AmEX and that I'd need a receipt. I am not given a receipt to show that the obscure amount was corrected and credited back, solely that I was now being charged correctly. The manager never came over to speak to me, even as I passed him when I left.  It's funny because I sat there in pulled back hair, a low bun, designer business attire, designer purse and paid with a corporate card and my less than bright server still gave subpar service. This restaurant just opened. I could be a mystery shopper. She was more concerned with the group of flirty elderly gentlemen to my left than ensuring my meal was up to a standard.  I will say, the same young man that walked me to my table gave me the kindest greeting again upon departure. I let him know to look out for my review. I'm not sure who this man is, but he needs a raise and a promotion. You either have it or you don't. He does. Sierra S, doesn't.  Would I come back? They need to get their ish together. If you want me to train your team, I will. Kitchen staff & servers.... How in the world you'd serve that meal to me is beyond fathomable. And I purposely said nothing to prove how incompetent they were... that, and on that level they'd spit in my food. I didn't want that either. Get it together or just close yourselves down."
Donald P.,"Columbia, MD",1,44,18,1.0,12/21/2017,"BJ's just can't get it right. Upon greeting our server, we told him in each of our previous three visits, the server had forgotten on bring an item to the table.  He responded with ""I promise you, that will absolutely not happen tonight."" So I ordered the Barbeque Chicken Chopped Salad. Instead, they bought me a Cobb Salad!  (Our server checked and said he accidentally put in the wrong order). My friend had chips and salsa so I also ordered a side of guacamole to go with it but instead was bought out the guacamole and chips appetizer!  Why one star for this review?  Mistakes can happen to anyone. But every visit has resulted in a service error (i.e., a Santa Fe (chicken) salad served without chicken). The management knows about this problem and yet it persist. Not to mention, it spoils a dinner out together out as one person eats while the other sits there and waits to eat because the restaurant to correct their mistake."
Mark G.,"Columbia, MD",13,181,540,3.0,5/18/2017,"This review starts while I am waiting to be served.  How hard is that? Whatever system they are using here is very slow.   Servers are walking around with tablets, and I still have to wait for service.  What happens if all these devices get a virus?  Would the wait staff look up and see patrons without a drink or food, or even a menu? Anyway, the beer selection is very interesting, including both their own brews and local microbrews.    We decided on two appetizers, a fried artichoke and a cherizo serachi dip.  Thrse wrre good  thpighthe chips were old and had spent too much time in oil.  We then had a tavern thin crust pizza with pineapple and jalapenos.  Though it was light on the ""pig"" it was quite enjoyable. Everthing on the menu had a contrived, corporatized feel to it.  However, the beer selection was good, and our choices were acceptable.  We enjoyed the pizza. Eat well, tip well."
J T.,"Montgomery Village, MD",6,162,1,1.0,12/22/2017,"The food is okay, however the service is really lousy. We were there yesterday with an office Christmas party and our server at first acted like she couldn't give us happy hour prices, we were there a little after 3! She also behaved like she was completely overwhelmed. I mean this goes, for the computer they make them key into and also just with taking general orders and basic skills of being friendly. She never once came back and asked how we were doing, if we'd like more drinks, food etc. I have to say the BJ's in Laurel is MUCH better and, I will NOT be returning to this Columbia location."
Kat A.,"Washington, DC",28,231,16,4.0,8/11/2017,"This might sound weird but I have never heard of this place despite their multitude of locations...which I learned about after eating here for the first time this past week. Overall their menu and offerings are probably my favorite aspect when you compare them to their competitors.  For example, they have the usuals when it comes to apps but they also have unique offerings like avocado egg rolls and crispy flatbread nachos. They're not generic in the sense one might expect. We started with the asparagus and artichokes (I wanted the egg rolls but was overruled) and they were delicious. The asparagus was a bit stringy so I'm not sure if I'd order that again but the artichokes were a awesome.  I tried their BJ's Classic deep dish pizza as my entree and was surprised. It was much better than I anticipated. Plus they also have a bunch of sizes (not the norm when it comes to deep dish pizza) so I really liked that aspect. The pizza didn't take an hour like traditional Chicago deep dish which I was totally fine with. They also have an option of a half half deep dish speciality pizza which got them extra points in my pizza book, even if I didn't order it. It's a great option if you're ordering a larger sized deep dish and sharing it with a table of people who don't agree on pizza toppings.  Sorry for the pizza rambling. Really enjoyed the food and will be back for sure!"
Eli N.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",12,234,134,3.0,10/19/2017,"Food was good. Definitely gotta go with the Peruvian Bowl with Quinoa and Salmon. The deep dish pizzas are good too. Service was slow, really slow. The server was nice and friendly. 3 stars is just right for this place as it's just an upscale ale house. It's new, it's nice, check them out."
Brad F.,"Chula Vista, CA",22,59,10,1.0,5/17/2017,"My most recent visit to BJ's was my sixth to this location and most likely my last. Each time my experience at the restaurant becomes worse.  On the current visit we were greeted and seated in a efficient manner.  Our drink order was taken quickly but after the order was taken 25 minutes went by and we still hadn't received our beers nor given any water. The first thing brought to our table after 20 minutes of waiting was a bottle of ketchup. I had to stop our waitress and ask if our drinks were ready. She said oh yeah like it was an inconvenience to her. She then brought our drinks right away.  We finished our beers and our food still had not arrived, probably 40/45 minutes into being seated. Our waitress never stopped at our table to ask if we wanted another drink but did have time to joke around with her co-workers.  Finally at about 50 minutes in our food arrived. I had ordered the original wings (the description said they would be crispy but nothing was crispy about them) they were average but the portion size was adequate. My wife ordered something along the lines of the honey chicken salad. It looked like a bag of tiny shredded lettuce was dumped in a bowl and topped with honey covered chicken strips. So much lettuce, too much lettuce.  Once again I had to stop the waitress to ask for another drink which she went and grabbed right away. We had to wait about 15 minutes for the check.  I hate to mention this but it's true and unpleasant so I will. In the past I was waited on by a rather large sized waitress. This waitress had a terrible Oder coming off of her. It was so strong I almost lost my appetite. On my most recent visit I was looking down at my menu and I started smelling that awful smell again. Sure enough, I turn around and the same waitress is at the table behind me taking an order.  Management should address this issue. It alone is enough to not make me want to eat there any more.  Additionally, each time the servers/service becomes slower and more relaxed.  I would like to note that there is one waitress we had that provided excellent customer service. I don't remember her name but she was a tiny blonde woman probably late 20s early 30s. Too bad the other servers aren't up to her caliber.  Another occurrence from a previous visit involved my wife and I ordering beers. The waitress first came back and told me they were out of my beer took another beer choice then left. She then came back with out any beer and told my wife they were out of the beer she ordered (both were BJs beers by the way). She left again and some random waiter dropped off a beer that neither one of us had asked for. The manager then came over and said they had made a mistake and both the original beers we had ordered were in fact there. So after about 30 minutes we had our beers and not offered a discount or other way to apologize.  I like the beer but I just can't beer to eat at BJ's any more (that was a pun by the way)."
Khalilah A.,"Owings Mills, MD",2,6,,3.0,12/14/2017,"Standard restaurant there was really nothing that stood out service, food, and ambience were average. It's a restaurant you go to when there isn't anywhere else to go."
Sarah B.,"Arlington, VA",0,6,,1.0,9/9/2017,Our group of ten arrived to find the hostess didnt have the table they reserved for us. Before rousting two toddlers and an array of family members (ages 6 weeks to 88years) we called to see if they could accommodate us and the hostess said we they had two tables available and she would hold one for us. When we arrived less than 10 minutes (the max she said they would hold the table) later they unapologetically said they seated someone at one of those tables and that their manager said they couldn't hold the other--this strong leader manager never made an appearance while we spoke dumbfounded to a gaggle of hostesses none of whom offered an apology or made any effort to accommodate us. Clearly this is not a family friendly restaurant and belongs in Georgetown not Columbia.
Ashley H.,"Columbia, MD",16,3,,1.0,11/18/2017,"If I could give this no stars, I would. To start - we called hours in advance and the hostess took our name, number, and told us we'd be seated at 7:15. When we got there, at 7:10, we were told it would be a 20 minute wait.  The hostesses attitudes were an immediate turnoff. The hostess at the door didn't smile, greet us, or anything - just stared at me until I told her we had a reservation. When we were taken to our table, the hostess didn't look at us, say anything to us, just walked us to a table and threw the menus down. She didn't say a word and walked off. Now, this was the better service of the evening.  When our waiter arrived, I was happy. He was energetic, excited, and detailed. After taking our drink orders, he dissapeared for 15 minutes before bringing the drinks. After we ordered, he didn't take the menus. We ended up sitting the entire evening with menus on the table. After we were finished our appetizer, we waited upwards of 35 minutes for two pizzas. When they finally arrived, we had to ask for plates. After receiving the pizzas we didn't see the waiter for an hour. He did not check in, ask how it was, or refill our drinks. We only received one drink refill the entire time we were there and sat with empty cups the whole time. Incredibly dissapointing. The worst part, was that he did return to the section twice in fifteen minutes, and was attentive to all of the tables behind and around us. Some of the worst service I have ever received."
Daniel P.,"Woodstock, MD",104,46,74,3.0,9/23/2017,"They do a decent job here. I got the Hawaiian pizza which has pineapple, chicken, and jalapenos. Also ordered a red Amber ale which tasted fresh. I have had the flat bread and wings in the past. Great stuff.  They have a curro dessert which is really good. Don't forget to order that! The service is really lacking in terms of man power. They need to either hire more people or have the table service buttons so we can call a waiter up when we need them. It's extremely fustrating trying to get a hold of someone because they are either nowhere to be seen or busy with other customers."
Jessi S.,"Columbia, MD",79,19,6,3.0,12/30/2017,"I think the popularity of the restaurant only has to do with the fact that it is new in the Columbia area. I visited for happy hour on a weekday and it was packed! Almost had a tough time finding seats together at the bar for 3 people. Service was a bit slow at first, but it was busy. We all tried their house brews and were satisfied! The amber and red ales were my fave. We ordered a bunch of small plates to share between us: chips and salsa were good, but nothing special (for $3), spinach and artichoke dip was yummy and I liked that they had large artichoke chunks in it but I think it should come with a dipper other than tortilla chips. Since the other food we ordered hadn't come out yet, the kitchen sent out garlic bread with marinara to make up for the lag- not something I would have ordered otherwise. Our avocado egg rolls arrived, simple and tasty and I enjoyed the sauce that came with it. The mini deep dish pizzas were on HH so we got 3 to split: great white, buffalo chicken, and chicken bacon ranch. They were good! And I liked that they had more than one white pizza option since I'm not a red sauce fan. Last, but not least, we got the 3 sampler pizookies, the best part of our entire dinner! Don't miss out on these diabetic traps!"
Katey T.,"Laurel, MD",0,1,,1.0,12/27/2017,"The service sucks, food was cold, didn't receive silverware until well after food had arrived, consistently forgot our order for blue cheese dressing, and never asked for and forgot our refills on drinks. This is probably the worst service I have received, and I eat out quite often. Please heed my warning and go to one of the many other eating options in Columbia."
Melissa S.,"Woodbine, MD",7,5,,5.0,6/13/2017,I don't understand why this place has 3 stars. After 2 failed attempts to get into this place my family and I finally got in (really long wait times on a weekend night). Am I upset about that? NO! That tells me that this place is THAT good. Well it is. We went for lunch on a Saturday. My daughter ordered a kids burger and my two sons got the kids chicken tenders to share. I had a piece of the chicken and it was really good! Usually chicken tenders at restaurants suck but they were juicy and flavorful. I ordered the Hickory brisket and bacon burger. It was huge and sooooo good. I can't remember what burger my husband ordered but there was nothing left on his plate so I'd say he liked it. Also their fries are like crack! Once you start eating them you can't stop. I could just order a bucket of fries and be happy.  On to the next part...our service was top notch. We took a while to order because there was so many things that sounded good so by the time we ordered and were waiting my two sons (2 1/2 and 10 months) were getting restless and hungry and I was running out of puffs. Our server brought 3 little plates filled with fruit and garlic knots (which again are so freakin delicious) for my kids to keep them happy. It was a life saver. They were completely complementary. Anyone with hungry kids in a restaurant know that this type of kindness is a Godsend. I wish I could remember our server's name so I could give her a shout out. She was very sweet and understanding of our craziness. Don't listen to all the bad reviews on here. Give BJ's a try and remember it's still fairly new there is going to be a wait on the weekends
Rebeca F.,"Pikesville, MD",50,193,1,4.0,7/3/2017,"Enjoyed my first visit to this location. Went around 3 on Sunday and had no wait. I recommend downloading the app to get great coupons. Got a tomato and cheese pizza. Asked for extra tomato, which I didn't get, that was the only disappointing part. Save a little room for the monkey bread pizookie, it's amazing!"
Rachel M.,"Auburn Hills, MI",21,47,43,4.0,10/15/2017,"Pretty solid restaurant...a lot of menu choices. Everything I had was pretty good, service was also good.  I ordered the Strawberry splash drink, Mediterranean chicken tacos and avocado eggs rolls...the egg rolls were my favorite part, sooooo delicious."
SonSo ..,"Hanover, MD",0,14,47,2.0,8/12/2017,"Really pleasant environment; however, the service was slow. They were slow bringing  the drinks to the table, slow with bringing the food and slow with bringing the check. The food was pretty good though so that kind of made up for the whack service."
Carlyn P.,"Baltimore, MD",8,32,31,4.0,6/9/2017,Great Food. Great Drinks. I got the Pepperoni Extreme mini pizza and Berry Burst Cider. A+. They also have a great moscato. The service was attentive and she visited us frequently.
Andrew Y.,"Columbia, MD",43,32,1,2.0,7/2/2017,"BJ's is a personal favorite restaurant of mine with there amazing deep dish pizza and delicious pizookie! I left very disappointed and displeased after today's visit. Came here today with my family and literally sat waiting over 30 min for our entrees to come out. Did our server bother to check on us or apologize NOPE! We were literally going to leave because we were starving and had places to be, but luckily our food came out before we did. And no surprise here my pizza came out warm border line cold. I did not have time for them to make me another.  Also to top if off just for us to get our check and boxes back took another 20 plus minutes. I was so frustrated and disappointed, they were lucky my girlfriend was holding me back from escalating this to the manager.  Big big disappointment today. I will update my review after my next visit if tings improve...."
Sayed I.,"Columbia, MD",1,22,,4.0,5/11/2017,"Good food, great service, cool atmosphere. It is at the end of the shopping center, furthest from the garage/Tesla SC.  It has a sportsbar restaurant feel, similar to RR or GT.  As for the food, I would recommend the Jambalaya and any of the Salmon dishes.  Overall, BJs has a good selection for kids, as it is kid-friendly.  Additionally they have several seafood dishes for the non meat eaters and tasty desserts ""fit"" for those who don't give a damn about watching their weight. By the way the fries are excellent.  A solid B"
Jared J.,"Washington, DC",14,130,5,3.0,3/29/2017,"The food is generally good, but there is quite some room for improvement.  First, BJ's needs to either accept reservations or live and die on a ""first come, first served"" basis. This ""phone ahead"" situation isn't working. One recent Saturday evening, the girlfriend and I ""phoned ahead"" hours in advance, yet were forced to wait outside with the masses for half an hour before we got a table.  While we waited patiently, another patron exploded in an apoplectic rage at the hostess. Some people in Columbia cannot handle a little inconvenience.   Speaking of the patronage and apoplexy, why are there so many children in a brewhouse? Have the parents of Howard County lost their collective minds?  Which brings me to the beer. BJ's suffers from the same affliction as local restaurant (and soon-to-be chain) Victoria's: greed. These restaurants have an in-house brewery producing mediocre beer that the restaurants then eagerly sell to diners at the same price as or at a higher price than other, more reputable craft brews. The profit margins are through the roof.  On that note, BJ's: please take your beers off of nitro. You're doing it wrong."
Gerry P.,"Gaithersburg, MD",123,15,7,3.0,7/15/2017,"Not a bad choice for lunch, the hubs and I purposely came here because we have eaten at one in California and wanted more.  We came in around 1 on a Saturday, we were seated quickly, even though it's was a little busy. The server was fast to greet us and get our drinks. She returned and got out order fast, we were really happy with the service.  The food isn't quite what I remember. We ordered the Brussel Sprouts as an app, the sauce tasted good but the sprouts themselves were a little to done. We both got tomato and mozzarella salads, they came out quickly, and tested great. Our food followed suit with a quick delivery, hubs got the crispy jalapeño burger and loved it. I got the chicken bacon ranch piadena, it was ok. I don't know what I was expecting but what I received was a little under whelming.  Over all I would say the service was great, food was decent. I would come back and eat here again, would def change up the order tho."
Joseph W.,"Columbia, MD",75,229,48,5.0,5/13/2017,"Made a reservation. Love the App. You can reserve a seat, or put a order in. Our waitress was on point and very polite, and attentive. Wish I could remember her name(sigh). Food was great, and my 3 beer selection was great, and I ended up ordering another set. I also enjoyed the dessert. I went home with a full stomach and some take out to go. Atmosphere was great, love the design in the inside."
Rachel R.,"Ellicott City, MD",0,17,,3.0,12/5/2017,"Went here for dinner on Sunday dec 3rd with my boyfriend and a friend. Our server was a little condescending when we were ordering our food. Leaning over one of the chairs at the table and was leaning into the table with his tablet. We ordered root beer and vanilla cream sodas and they weren't as icy as they usually are. And he did not take care of refills at all. I got the California chicken sandwich and asked for cheddar instead of Swiss and it ended up coming with Swiss. Had to call him over and told him it was Swiss and not cheddar and he didn't apologize and just acted awkward like he didn't want to take it back. He stood there holding my plate awkwardly and said ""ummmm okayyyy...."". I'm a server and that's not okay. You're supposed to apologize immediately and offer to take it back and have the Chef make it on the fly. Anyways he came back with it with cheddar and then apologized half heartedly. It was really good so it made the whole experience not so bad. My boyfriend was pretty bad that the root beer soda refills were not taken care of because they are our favorite parts of this restaurant. We asked for a to go soda as well because a previous server(who was absolutely amazing) had done it for us in the past without us even asking, he offered this service. But he was no where to be seen and we wait for 15 minutes and realized he just forgot or didn't care so we left. Luckily the food and the dessert we ordered were amazing! Definitely recommend the ribs, California sandwich, and the monkey bread! Root beer and vanilla cream sodas are to die for! Especially when it's super icy. So service wise it was definitely lacking but food wise this place is great. Price is a little much but I guess the food is great enough to make it worth your money!"
