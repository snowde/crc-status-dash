Brandi G.,"Columbia, MD",0,8,,2.0,4/13/2017,"The food was ok.  I ordered the pork chop with the brussel sprouts and a caesar salad.  The pork chop was very good.  However, the brussel sprouts were a bit on the salty side and the caesar salad had way too much dressing on it.  The desserts are good.  One thing I didn't like was our waitress and another waiter were clearing off the table behind us where she had served people.  She was making fun of the little girl that was there previously with her family.  I found this a bit rude and unprofessional."
Phil C.,"Hanover, MD",0,2,,5.0,3/3/2017,Great fresh food for a Chain Restaurant! Service was awesome and hands down the best restaurant in the surrounding area! Jessica our server was superb! Highly recommend.
Sam S.,"Columbia, MD",0,4,,1.0,3/21/2017,"Service was slow. Took an hour to get our food and no explanation was offered, or even an apology. We were checked on and offered refills once during our wait"
Lucy J.,"Columbia, MD",0,9,,3.0,3/10/2017,"Food is better than most chains in Columbia. Unfortunately, the kitchen can't keep up with a full dining room. Service last night was too slow for us to consider going back. Well, that and the fact that they have a triple chocolate pizookie on the menu but they were out of it both times we went for dinner. Another disappointing restaurant in the culinary wasteland that is Columbia."
Dad F.,"Ellicott City, MD",1,29,2,1.0,3/19/2017,"I can't even give this place 1 star! I love Brussel sprout appetizers but theirs was so over cooked, I was just eating burnt leaves. The menu states the steaks are high quality and aged, then why bury them in so much pepper and season that it just becomes a plate for the pepper! Then to top it off, mid-rare came out cold and red throughout. It took 10 minutes for server to check and when I told her she said they would fix it. I asked if they could not bury it in seasoning. After 24 minutes it came back dry and cooked very uneven and still buried in pepper. Nothing said or asked by the server. The salmon my friend ordered had so much salt it didn't even taste like salmon! The next visit from the server was the check drop off! I called the next day and the day after to speak with a manager but it took 5 days for a response! I will try again but i don't have high hopes! Just another beer joint with cooks that attempt    Quality food but fall hard and very short!"
Taylor J.,"Marriottsville, MD",130,1,,3.0,5/22/2017,"Ate here last week with my family and thought the food was delicious and had phenomenal service so we decided to return this week. The server we had this time around was HORRIBLE! After being seated we waited for 20 minutes just to place an order for drinks, when she arrived we ordered everything at once. She never once cleared our empty plates after appetizers or entrees our drink glasses were never once refilled by our server we had to ask other servers to fill them. Our server disappeared on several instances for about 10-15 min and the other servers were trying to take care of us.The manager I believe his name was Steve came to our table after another server recognized our frustration, he listened to our complaint and did nothing about it except say he was going to check on our dessert and never returned to fix the problem. It was very disappointing that the manager didn't seem to care much, most places try and meet their guests needs.  Such a disappointing experience for a restaurant that has great food."
