Glenn M.,"Treasure Island, FL",98,426,218,2.0,5/1/2017,Seriously the slowest and worst service out of my last few hundred meals.  Food was good a solid 4.  Service was a zero so equals a 2 overall.  Seriously to not clear appetizer plates and empty glasses - I can't explain how inefficient and bad the service was.  Go for the food if you have time to waste
Susie K.,"Baltimore, MD",220,176,13,2.0,5/9/2017,"I've visited BJs about 3 times now and the first visit I would have given it 4.5 stars for the service. Only downside was that when we were sitting at the bar, a man threw up all over himself. Yikes.  The staff gave him some bread and water and then after a grueling 20 minutes he finally went to the bathroom. The GM offered to comp us a salad and dessert but I lost my appetite at that point.  The next two visits were not so great. Thankfully no vomit. But the service was pretty terrible. The waiters and waitresses seem busy because they are constantly walking past your table but they rarely stop to check on you.  Just last night my party of 3 had to wait 20 minutes just to have our table cleared of other peoples drinks and then another 10 minutes for someone to even come and take our drink orders.  Sad to say, I don't think I'll be back a 4th time"
Jennifer B.,"Columbia, MD",0,8,,3.0,10/9/2017,"My husband and I dined here this past Saturday. At 6pm restaurant was packed with 20 minute wait. We sat in bar area. It was very loud, to the point of not being to hear one another. We ordered stuffed mushrooms, and tuna poke' for apps. Mushrooms were very average but low cal. The tuna was fresh but there was such minimal seasoning was bland. Our waiter Casey was great! Laid back, great sense of humor and efficient. We both ordered a quinoa bowl but with different proteins on top. There was a lot of shrimp on mine, but base was bland and identical to my husband's meal. What we did like is calories are displayed and the do have numerous, gluten free or low cal options. We may have just chosen wrong meal. It was ok... but when ditching kids at their movie night to spend rare casual night out, it would not be our choice a second time. We would check out for lunch another time."
Evan T.,"Baltimore, MD",119,42,84,3.0,5/25/2017,"The food was meh, everything I had was very bland. Atmosphere was nice but sparse, and the waiter didn't come by very often. (But I've been told by others it's great so I will give it another try)"
Jo P.,"Elkridge, MD",26,50,13,5.0,8/27/2017,"First time here, very friendly employees. I don't know why other reviews mentioned service was bad? Maybe they improved? Maybe we got lucky? I got the sliders and spinach and artichoke dip. I loved the sliders and the dip but the dip wasn't that hot. Most places serve it so it's like molten lava but my dip was kind of cool, like room temp. (I didn't complain though, I just ate them.)"
Kelleen N.,"Columbia, MD",112,58,45,5.0,2/22/2017,"Everything was perfect. We got the table we wanted, despite being as busy as they were. They have awesome week night specials and you can never go wrong with a pizookie! Amazing."
Natalie R.,"Columbia, SC",0,1,,5.0,9/9/2017,"My boyfriend and I went to BJ's tonight for the first time to watch the USC game. We decided to sit at one of the community tables in the bar area. By the time the game started, they were very busy, so we were a little crowded, but since we chose to sit there, it definitely wasn't worth deducting a star.  We started with the Ahi Poke appetizer and we were not fans. The ahi was not how either of us had ever had it before (it was chopped up and totally raw). We did not finish it. We ended up ordering a tavern style pizza, the spicy pig I believe, and it was GREAT! I would highly recommend it. The crust was crispy and cooked very well and the toppings were great. I also had a wedge salad that was good too. I had downloaded the BJ's app beforehand so I had a coupon for a free mini pizookie and which was also wonderful. Fresh baked chocolate chip cookie with ice cream on top is hard to beat.  We stayed for the entire game, so almost 4 hours and our waitress was very attentive the entire time. They had a ton of waiters tonight, it seemed like many of them were in training, so you could always find someone if you needed anything.  We will definitely be going back to BJ's. The menu is enormous so we could probably go every weekend for the next 6 months and always get something new! I loved how many ""lighter"" options were on the menu too. So many more options for people who are watching what they're eating! I would highly recommend."
Kenneth W.,"Washington, DC",3,55,9,2.0,4/5/2017,"In a town saturated with pubs and sports bars, I dd not care to see another one. But BJs is new, so I through to give it a try. I visited on a Wednesday evening, the restaurant was sparse.  Upon entering this restaurant, I smell timber rather than food and grease, attesting to newness of this restaurant. The ambience is warm and inviting, and the cavernous ceiling lends a feeling of grandness that says this is no common pub or sports bar. I picked up the menu and struggled to read it because the prints are small, so small that I believe they don't want to understand that I am getting.  But I manage to make out that menu offers many of the stand pub item but also many finer items.  I believe this establishment wants to be classified as fine dining - the prices certainly are. I ordered the Avocado Spring Rolls and the Crispy Calamari to go. The carry out boxes were fancy, and I appreciate that the food was waiting for me inside a warmer rather than just sitting out on a counter. The avocado spring rolls were crispy and full of filling, but they were very salty. Beyond saltiness there were other flavors really.  The accompanying dipping sauce might as well have been sugar water - overly sweet and lacking other flavors. The crispy calamari was cut too thinly for a satisfying bite. The batter had some seasoning, better than most of other place where the batter usually consist of only flour. But the subtle batter was hardly worth mentioning. The accompanying horseradish-tasting dipping sauce didn't go with the calamari. The hostess greeted me pleasantly. The young lady at the register who took my order was also pleasant. I am not sure her remarking my order with, 'That's a good choice!' added any value. If anything, it tells me she's trying too hard. Overall with my fist visit - 2 stars for the food, and 3.5 stars for the briefing interactions with the staff.  I will give this restaurant another try, this time dine-in. Hopefully other items on the menu taste better."
Lucrecia S.,"Falls Church, VA",15,39,60,5.0,3/27/2017,"We went to the one and jacksonville.and im so glad there isnconsitency in yhe menu, the offers and the quality. Specially the beer tasting is awesome!!!"
Nikki M.,"Elkridge, MD",24,15,,2.0,9/23/2017,"This is the 3rd time we have been to this restaurant, and we won't be back. The first time they brought me a warm cocktail (cold drink in a hot glass). The second visit they couldn't get my order right. Tonight we used the waitlist on the app, arrived and finally was seated after several parties who arrived after us. Over an hour after I signed up for the waitlist. The manager comped us a free app, but in my opinion that's enough ""tries""."
Sam S.,"Ellicott City, MD",1,2,15,5.0,4/10/2017,"Great new restaurant in Columbia, good service ""Melanie"" was awesome... delicious food."
Meg H.,"Columbia, MD",0,7,,4.0,5/27/2017,"Beer is delicious. We did the 4-flight. Appetizers were phenomenal. Most meals were pretty good  (my porkchop was a bit overcooked in the outside but good on inside). Dessert was fantastic. Atmosphere is classy sports bar. Service was so-so (hence 4 stars), and we waited the entire meal to have our app plates and empty glasses removed. You can tell, however, it was just bc they are so busy right now being a newer restaurant."
Tee R.,"Baltimore, MD",0,20,9,4.0,3/27/2017,"Updated after 3 additional visits (4 stars): On additional visits I've had the fish tacos and spaghetti - both were divine! When the root beer hits the table it's icy cold and frothy. And on 2 of our 3 additional visits the servers and host/hostesses have been extremely friendly and helpful! One (Cara?) went out of her way to assist us with our leftovers and take home items.  I'm reducing my initial review from 5 to 4 stars for 2 reasons: 1. I ordered a chicken club without avocado. The server repeated our order back to us but the sandwich came with smashed up avocado which I couldn't just scrape off. Server didn't come back to check on us right away so I ate the dry chicken. When she finally comes over she tells me that she didn't hear me request no avocado and to make it better she offered another sandwich - the meal was over and I was no longer hungry. No other solution was offered (reduced bill, free dessert, etc).   2. On another visit, the floor around our table wasn't clean. Our server was very apologetic and extremely kind; she took care of it right away.  Original Review (5 stars) This is a perfect location as all of the other restaurants in this shopping center are all less than desirable. The hostess was very friendly as she showed us to our seat. Our server Aria ROCKED. She was friendly, patient (as we had questions about the new menu, specials, and beer selection) and just awesome. Our food was delish and the drinks were frothy and cold. And we got a free dessert (monkey bread pazookie- yum...just, yum) for downloading the app. Even the server who delivered our food was friendly and took a very brief second to chat. We will be back! (Did I mention that our waitress rocked?!)"
Jason F.,"Ellicott City, MD",30,226,,4.0,3/6/2017,"First time at a BJ's and I would describe it as a Cheesecake Factory with pizza and beer. Good for what it is. If you are expecting fine dining or authentic food, then you will be surely disappointed.  Ordered the sweet pig pizza, side of fries, and a chocolate chip pizookie. The pizza is a deep dish/pan pizza. I equate it similar to Domino's version of the pan pizza which sounds insulting, but I liked it since Hawaiian style pizzas are my favorite and the crust was nice and fluffy. The fries were supposed to be shoe string, but apparently this location does not have those so they were just regular. Tasted fine at least. The dessert was good. Think chocolate chip cookie cake with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream.  Tried 2 of their beers. The goliath and the porter. Respectable offerings. They have plenty of taps and not just their own beers. Also, plenty of liquor options.  If you set your expectations right, this place is nice for a casual meal. The restaurant looks nice, has plenty of TVs, and the service was friendly.  Happy Hour is M-F 3-7 and 10-close on the weekends. $1 off drinks and cheaper apps/flatbreads. Tuesdays are 1/2 off wine night."
Cynthia P.,"Columbia, MD",19,9,5,2.0,10/15/2017,"Food was good. Service ruined the experience. Our waiter was Graham. We asked for catsup after our food was delivered (without my husband's Mac n cheese) and watched Graham wait on 2 tables. When called him over his attitude was 'you need anything else'...yes, the two things we asked for 10 minutes ago.  I had to get a drink refill from another waiter because Graham just continued to walk past our table without a check in. Had to send margarita back because Graham got it wrong. To go wings came out on a platter instead of a togo box. Heard about the dessert specials from listening to the waiter at the next table. Finally, my husband gets the bill. It comes back without the credit card. Catch Grahams attention, he had put the cc next to ME, which was under a menu...why was it not in with the bill?  When questioned he immediately suggested we talk to the manager who couldn't even find his business card. No, we didn't want a free dessert nor the story of how ""Graham was one of their best waiters...perhaps having a bad bad day"". Awful. Won't be back."
Roberta W.,"Fulton, MD",31,4,,5.0,11/19/2017,"Been here several times, including the first week they opened.  Typically sit at the bar.  Service at the bar is very good.  Had a favorite bartender but haven't seen her recently.  :(  Pricella has taken care of us the last two visits and she is great too.  Always have to get the brussel sprouts.  Ordered them at Ruths Chris last week and they were hard.  Here they have always been tender.  Love the sriracha sauce.  Harvest Hefeweizen is very refreshing and flavorful.  Don't think I've tried any other handcrafted beer at BJs.  Hickory brisket burger..yum!"
Conner D.,"Columbia, MD",0,2,,2.0,9/3/2017,"On what is now my fifth time dinning here I feel that I'm finally ready to post a review. Every time I go here I tell myself that I'll review it next time, give it one more chance. And every time I'm more and more disappointed. My first time going to Bjs our waitress took way to long to get any of our orders. My moms wine came out much much much later than everyone else's. And here's my biggest problem with the restaurant: the service. My cousin asked for a bottle of ketchup l for his burger form the waiter that brought our food out (he was a different person than the one that served us, keep that in mind it's important for later). The one who brought the food out never came back and our server didn't have any ketchup with him. Neither of them returned, and my cousin ended up having to ask another table for one.  The food itself isn't that bad (the boneless wings are about 80% breading it seems, and the pork chop was too sweet for my liking). The pulled pork is pretty good, but overall not the best. The atmosphere is the only real selling point for me now; plenty of screens and the open concept is great, it's just unfortunate that the food can't match the ambiance."
Daniel V.,"Columbia, MD",11,6,,4.0,7/20/2017,"I have been here twice now. I like the atmosphere.  It's casual and comfortable, usually buddy, not too loud so one can talk to friends easily. The food is great, the menu large and varied and the beer selection is pretty good. I expect that Friday and Saturday there may be a wait."
Deborah L.,"Ellicott City, MD",140,16,29,2.0,4/24/2017,"Let me make things clear before I state my opinions about this place: I came here TWICE to see if the first time was a false representation of this place. 1.) The atmosphere is nice. Open space, modern & good place to catch a drink.  2.) The food is good, and that's why I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1.  3.) The servers here S-U-C-K.  the first time I came here, a short haired black girl served us. She was low-key snarky, SLOW and entitled. Utensils were not given until we asked for it. Never came around to check on us. Moved sluggishly. Made me feel like a burden. All around had a difficult persona/vibe she was giving off that was half weird/half rude. I understand people have bad days, but at LEAST be a little cordial when that's your job to do so? Just a LITTLE.  4.) Second time around, we got a male server (I forgot how he looked like). Same problems again...RUDE and unenthusiastic. Utensils had to be asked for again, drinks took forever to come out. I heard the table next to us complaining and looking disappointed as well that drinks took forever to come out. Didn't really check up on us- sincerely. Just kinda unenthusiastically strolled on by. By the end of the dinner, then enthusiastically said, ""have a great weekend!"" Probably to make a great impression for tip. But you're not fooling me sir.  All in all, servers here 'get the job done' on the surface but are just so rude and a buzzkill to be around. I don't get it. I almost felt like we were a burden put on them.  In all fairness, I really don't think I'm one of those a-hole customers. Service here just sucks. Such a shame."
Athira R.,"Fair Oaks, CA",10,5,,4.0,7/23/2017,Really amazing food only thing is their wait times... especially on the weekends it can get pretty busy. Wish they would expand their space. Food is amazing!!
