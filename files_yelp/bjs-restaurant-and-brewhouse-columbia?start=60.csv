Taylor B.,"Catonsville, MD",1,3,2,2.0,7/9/2017,"This is my second visit to bj's andddddd the food is extremely bland. My guacamole taste like cardboard. The lemon pepper sesame wings were mediocre at best and my mozzarella sticks were Luke warm and also taste of nothing with a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese. As much as I wanted to like bjs I think I just have to accept the reality that the food is just not good. The service was good however. We were a large party and she handled us pretty well, just too bad the food was trash."
Ed C.,"Fairport, NY",0,4,,5.0,7/8/2017,"So far a pretty good experience our waitress is awesome . I have to say I am sad to see all the comments from ""Jim"" and he still has not made the adjustments to improve the service just a bunch of excuses. Jim - if you worked for me you would be canned fast! Sorry folks I have to update this our service was fantastic and the waitress Jerrena was amazing ! I think I may have been mistaken and have to change my rating to 5 stars"
D C.,"McLean, VA",0,14,,1.0,3/20/2017,"I can't review whether the food is any good, but I'm reviewing the service.  Which is horrible. So bad that they didn't even get around to taking my order. I came in, sat at the bar... and waited.  Waited for a long while before the bartender stopped chatting with someone I can only assume was a friend.  He came by and I ordered some ice tea.  I wanted a menu so I could order some food... but had to ask for that. Then he walked off to resume talking with his friend and never came back. Eventually,  I couldn't tolerate that no one would come and take my order, so I had to get up and flag a passing waiter just to pay for the iced tea before leaving.  (Amazingly, the bartender didn't even notice that I had left to flag down someone for the check.) And as the bartender then, finally, came by with the bill for the iced tea... he was *QUITE* unhappy that I was leaving. I'll never go back.  No restaurant should operate like that. --- Edit:  The place was empty, with only two other people at the bar."
Mitch M.,"Elkridge, MD",0,12,,1.0,3/31/2017,"What. A. Train wreck. I can't speak to the quality of the food one way or the other, since we never got seated. I read that they take call ahead, so we called when we left the house, and the hostess told us that it would be a total of 40 minutes - meaning once we got to the restaurant, we would only have to wait 20 minutes.  For good measure, we waited an additional 10 minutes or so past that time to check in to see where we were on the list, and the answer was basically nowhere close. Another 10 minutes went by, as we talked about our options, as unfortunately we were on a tight schedule. Finally we went up one last time to find out how many people were ahead of us, and they told us that we were only about halfway into our 90 minute wait! Nobody said nothing about no 90 minute wait. We asked to see the manager to share our experience, and he was very apologetic as we told him we were leaving. It was very nice of him to give us a gift card to apologize for our experience, but unfortunately I have no idea how much it is for as nothing was written on it. As we pulled out of the parking space, the cell phone buzzed, saying our table was ready."
Nunya B.,"Washington, DC",2,51,56,1.0,3/4/2017,"I'm currently sitting here writing this review. This place sucks a**.  I've eaten at BJ's in SoCal many times.  So I was excited to see there were many locations in my home area.  Suffice to say I will NOT be returning.  Brought everyone's drinks at the same time yet my root beer came 20 minutes after everyone else's.  Got my mom's drink order wrong.  Got my queso dip order wrong.  It was supposed to have pork in it and they bring the pork on the side 15 minutes after the fact.  The dip was cold by that point. They also take down your orders electronically at your table.  It takes longer to order your food that way when the waiter doesn't know.  From what I was told, they haven't been open long and that the California reps just left.  Well, they need to come back.  And this location is much smaller than the ones in Cali. Our waiter was not that great.  Just because you're nice doesn't make you a good waiter bring that you're the reason everything was screwed up. I wish we had the waiter that's serving the table behind us because he's knowledgeable, explains certain things, etc. I will never come back here ever again."
Wes K.,"Columbia, MD",10,11,,3.0,6/26/2017,"Slow, slow, slow.  First time visiting this restaurant.  Server came over and got our drinks pretty fast and I placed an app order before we decided on our main course.  He came back with the drinks and we asked for straws...did not receive them until the 2nd time asking.  Why don't they carry them in their aprons anymore?  After placing our main order it took about 15 minutes to get our appetizer of fried artichokes (tasted great).  Then about about 10-15 minutes more our tacos and fish and chips came out.  We asked for some tartar sauce from the food runner and our waiter.  About 5 or more minutes go by when the server comes back to say they are ""making a fresh batch.""  Meanwhile the fish and chips are getting cold while waiting for some dip (also the fish breading has spice and the tartar is made with chipotle.  You should mention that in the menu).  He apologies and then sends the manager over who was very pleasant and apologetic (comped the one entree).  He mentioned he would ask the cooks why it took so long.  We were never asked for refills or given refills on our drinks even though my water was empty for awhile. Overall I did enjoy the food but the service was extremely poor.  I know it's a new place but that is when you need to get the new customers to come back.  With so many choices in the area it might be hard for me to come back anytime soon considering all the other reviews are similar to mine."
Vivian I.,"Columbia, MD",3,39,25,4.0,3/28/2017,"First time visiting this new chain restaurant in Columbia. I was a little hesitant to visit based off some of the reviews but figured I would give it a try.  Went for lunch with my husband and parents. We all tried the root beer.. it was a little to sweet for me but not terrible. For an appetizer we did the spinach and artichoke dip which I did not care for.. very bland. For my entree, I ordered the chicken bacon on ranch piadina with fries. It was actually pretty delicious. This is a chain, you are not going to get a fine dining experience but for what it is.. it's a decent place. Service was good.. our waitress was a little too helpful and pushy(really wanted us to download their app). But she was attentive and friendly so I can't hold it against her. I will be back to explore other menu items."
Matthew F.,"Elkton, MD",2,2,,2.0,2/25/2017,"Mediocre. First time at any BJ's, heard some good things about it so checked it out on a Saturday night. Got beer, potato skins, 2 pasta dishes, and a pizookie. The food was really mediocre. The potato skins were bland, the pasta sauce tasted like Prego, and all of it was expensive for not being very good. The Pizookie was the best thing of the night. Dinner for two was $76 and the food was really disappointing."
Happy S.,"Rocklin, CA",0,26,1,3.0,5/22/2017,"Came back a second time. Service was slow, my plate was dirty and the food was not as good. Chef did not check food allergy this time and there was an allergen on my plate. Yummy food, lots of choices. They have a gluten free menu and the chef came out to talk with me to be sure they got my allergy friendly food right!"
Ned F.,"Washington, DC",0,129,,2.0,5/1/2017,"We came back today. And it's slow.  It wasn't very busy, and the service was slow. My burger was charred on the bottom. And the kid sliders? It consisted of a regular patty, cut into quarters.  Mac and cheese for the other kid's meal came out luke warm, with cheese that had been sitting on it for a little while.  The server warned us that it was a hot plate, but not so much.   Not impressed with this round."
Greg D.,"Columbia, MD",0,12,15,3.0,5/21/2017,"The service was slow today. Sunday busy, the kitchen sent entree prior to appetizer. This is the 2nd time in two visits this has happened. Prime rib was good after, sending it back to be re cooked it was too rare I ordered med rare. People next to me ordered spaghetti and it did not come in time and he asked for it to go. There's no prep time for that, just disorganized. I used my loyalty points $25 reward, that was a plus."
Leslie P.,"Nottingham, MD",179,3,,3.0,3/12/2017,"Don't come here when it's busy, the service is super slow. The food is okay but since you have to wait forever it kind of kills it."
Dee W.,"Ocean View, DE",0,10,1,5.0,6/23/2017,The service was outstanding and the food was delicious! We went to celebrate a friend's birthday for lunch and we each tried various dishes. All of the dishes were absolutely fantastic. The restaurant was very clean and the staff very professional and attentive.
LaToya M.,"Hanover, MD",82,12,1,5.0,4/18/2017,"My favorite new spot in Columbia. I went during the ""rough opening"" and have been back many times since. The food is always great (I LOVE the sriracha Brussels, burgers and ahi tuna poke), their beer is actually good and they have some other fantastic options on draft or bottled. In addition, they make a great Old Fashioned.  As for the service, all have been very friendly and definitely work hard. There are a couple that when I come in and they see me will come over and say HI regardless if they are assigned to my table or not. Definitely a place that I will be frequenting. It's nice to have a casual sports type bar in the area for the middle age crowd."
Sondra A.,"Columbia, MD",0,7,,3.0,6/15/2017,"First impression: Busy night! Very inviting and clean atmosphere. The hostess staff were very welcoming and got us seated quickly! Ordering: There's a lot on the menu so it takes a second to take in all the options. The server recommended the specials and informed us that there was a large party dining at the same time as we were. The wait for food was about 50 minutes and our waitress was only able to refill our drinks once even though we went a while without after apps waiting. It was pretty busy but it can still be a little frustrating.  All in all: The food was okay, the service was rushed but I don't think it was really their fault if they didn't have enough servers. Still a better dinner than the neighboring BWW or Famous Daves."
Ash T.,"Columbia, MD",1,3,,5.0,2/28/2017,"This location has only been in Columbia for a week and I must say everything about it was amazing! My husband and I really enjoyed ourselves. Ask for Brittany, she was awesome!"
Nathan C.,"Columbia, MD",0,5,,3.0,5/31/2017,Good food. But holy crap the service sucks ASS. The manager knows how to handle it though.
Renee J.,"Columbia, MD",121,5,,3.0,3/21/2017,"This was my first time at the Columbia location. I've been to the one in Laurel before but I couldn't remember if I liked or not. My bf said I didn't. Well, he was probably right.  Good beer selection but out of the 7 of us 6 ordered food and only one of us LIKED what they ordered. I was going to order the portobello mushroom strips but the server suggested the calamari. They were like rubber bands. Awful. The server was busy and kept disappearing. I sent them back and got the mushrooms. They were OK. So, I'll probably give them another chance but they will be a bar and app type of place for me. I need to check out their happy hour!"
kiran d.,"Malden, MA",0,3,1,4.0,8/19/2017,"I love the different varieties of beer they serve .. Also the food is flavorful , the jambalaya and the Peruvian bowl were amazing .. got a authentic feel to these dishes .. I have tried their draft sodas and they tasted good .. better than the Sunkist and all other coke company sodas.."
Garrett N.,"Baltimore, MD",159,6,,4.0,5/15/2017,Great place is you're looking for good beer and a nice atmosphere. The staff is so welcoming which is why I keep returning. The food isn't really that great but not my reason for coming here. Definitely a place I will keep coming too!
