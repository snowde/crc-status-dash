Gabrielle N.,"Columbia, MD",5,16,10,4.0,3/21/2017,We have eaten here a few times now.  Food is good and lots of selection which is nice.  We joined the app and are able to get priority seating and we have never had to wait.    The kitchen is still getting used to putting out food. The apps have come out after the main dish.  That's not what anyone wants.  Manager took care of us though so it all worked out.   Service is good and the place as big as it is isn't too loud.   Definitely a fun casual   eat.
Natalie N.,"Santa Maria Novella, Florence, Italy",126,12,8,1.0,6/20/2017,"This review is for the hostess at this location. My Asian parents arrived before me and my boyfriend and requested a booth, where we typically sit. The hostess blatantly told them no twice because there are no servers. Mind you, there are already 2 people sitting in the booth right next to the one that they requested. So my parents decided to go out and wait for us to come. When we came, my boyfriend (a tall, white male) asked to be seated at the same booth and the hostess had no trouble fulfilling his request. This really upset my parents because they have NEVER been treated like this at any other establishments. Our server, Juan, was AMAZING but his customer service was overshadowed by the discrimination that my parents faced from the hostess. What made this worse was that when the manager found out, he did not address this situation right away but waited until the bill was paid. We are not seeking for any discounts or free services. By addressing this issue at the very end, it made us feel as though management did not deem this issue important enough to address it ASAP. Will not be coming back. Thanks for the small effort at the end though but everyone should be treated equally regardless of race. Hope you really take this into consideration and not make up or listen to the excuses from your discriminating hostess. Thanks!"
Karla A.,"Columbia, MD",0,3,1,1.0,7/15/2017,Terrible service. The one in Southern California has better customer service and the food does not look reheated. It's upsetting when you order avocado and it is brown. You turn it away because it just doesn't look good the second time. Very sad because I do enjoy this chain restaurant just not this one
Ise E.,"Columbia, MD",0,8,,5.0,5/3/2017,"Great place to eat and charge the car. There is a pizza place, a yogurt shop and this place. BJ's is always busy but the food is always good. I love their seafood selection as it has never disappointed me."
Karen W.,"Laurel, MD",32,3,1,3.0,3/28/2017,"First time in the new location in Columbia.  Food was very good.  We had the fried artichokes, and avocado egg rolls for appetizers and two different burgers, a deep dish pizza the barbacoa cauliflower tacos and the root beer ribs for entrees.  Unfortunately the drink orders were not only slow to come out, but they were out of both a beer and their berry cider.   Oddly enough the beer they were out of is the same beer the Laurel location is consistently out of also.  The waitress was pleasant and friendly, but the drink service definitely was a big issue.  One of the rounds of beer and wine took over 30 minutes to arrive.  We love their food , but billing themselves as a brewhouse when the drink experience is so lackluster is shameful."
Regina C.,"Elkridge, MD",13,7,8,5.0,4/28/2017,Love this place - great Mediterranean Chicken tacos and the bacon cheeseburger to die for!
Jimmy W.,"Annapolis, MD",23,4,3,4.0,4/10/2017,Nice atmosphere and wide variety off food choices.  Staff has always been friendly and quick.  Really like the Tavern Pizza as a nice change of pace and they have great weekly specials.  Also using latest technology so you can pay right at table or via a very nice App that also has a rewards system.
Ted B.,"Town Center, Columbia, MD",7,3,,5.0,3/11/2017,"Great food, Emma is a great bartender and very personable! !. My only gripe was being told wait time for party of 6 was 60 to 70 minutes and did not get texted until after 2 hours."
Lauren S.,"Dayton, MD",83,5,2,1.0,5/19/2017,"Awful!!! Waited forever for a server to talk to us. I had to ask the hostess if we had a server and it turns out that she forgot she had our table. Then my husband and I ordered the same steak with the same cook (medium rare). Mine was bland and well done and his was extra rare. I ordered a martini and was delivered a margarita. The Brussel sprouts were hard (raw) and nasty....  Only ate my steak because I was extremely hungry and she never asked how everything was. Had to remind the server of my husband's soup. My steak came out before it (the orders were placed at the same time). I'm usually never one to complain about restaurants but almost everything was terrible. Bad service and bad food... Never coming back! On a positive note, the fries were good. At the end of the meal, the server was apologetic about how the meal went, but with so many things going wrong I would've expected a manager to talk to us."
Lolitee M.,"Woodberry, Baltimore, MD",0,9,9,5.0,2/25/2017,"This resturant is amazing!   I had the buffalo wings plain with hot spicy on the side.  Wings were cooked crispy fresh golden brown not over and hard.  I also had a side salad and Bjs  Margarita.  Very fresh ingredients.  Food came  out hot ! Didn't have to wait very long, a plus. Hubby had the Seafood Jambalaya . He said it was the best. Will definitely come again!  You must try!!!"
T G.,"Fawn Grove, PA",0,13,,1.0,7/10/2017,"If you like long waits, cold/under cooked food, and bad service this place is awesome. After a 45 minute wait for lunch (simple salads and wings) one of our parties plate was wrong and sent back several times before they got it right. The salmon on my salad was not cooked and was raw and cold. Sorta like sushi. Just a very bad experience all around. I have had lunch at the Laurel location and it was very good. I would recommend to drive the extra distance and avoid Columbia."
Anna F.,"Baltimore, MD",73,104,30,4.0,5/26/2017,I dined at BJ's restaurant and brewhouse on May 24 with my friend.  The ambiance reminds me of Columbia Alehouse.  There are televisions for sports fan to watch their favorite home team.  Our server was very nice and answered all of our questions. I like that Bj's Brewhouse has an app which I downloaded.  I also found a free appetizer coupon online and was able to order the New Beginnings which is a sampler of multiple appetizers.  Wednesdays are the loaded burger specials for $10 and unlimited french fries.  It was also $4 craft beers for the BJ's brewed beer.  I ordered the guacamole and bacon burger and it was really good. I did not take advantage of the unlimited french fries because I had so much food to eat already. The french fries were crisp and evenly salted. I liked my craft beer and the New Beginnings appetizer was good also. My friend and I had to take our food home since there was so much but this restaurant is a bang for your buck! I would definitely come back.  The only thing that gave this review 4 stars is the man who brought our burgers to us did not know if my burger had the side sauce.  He answered me in a rude way when I asked about my sauce.  Somehow my sauce ended up in my friend's burger but as someone who brings food to the customer should know where my sauce is.
James P.,"Columbia, MD",2,14,,1.0,3/24/2017,"Food was terrible. Mozzarella sticks were hollow no cheese inside clearly over cooked. Wings were dry. Avocado egg rolls were inedible and we were still charged for them. No manager in site to even talk with about the problems. Waiter made a snarky comment. I usually only rate places good so it takes a lot for me to give one star. I've been to the one in Frederick and the food was mediocre, but they have a lot going on here that needs work."
Jonathan H.,"Ellicott City, MD",0,12,5,3.0,3/20/2017,"This BJ's is poor compared with their California locations in Fremont and Irvine. I haven't tried the Laurel or Towson locations. Maybe it's because they've only been open a month, but the food is disappointing at this point. A $14 salad should have lots of crisp, fresh vegetables and more that three smallish chicken strips cut in half. The burger buns should not be stale. The beer selection is very good. I'll come back in a few months to give them one more visit before I cross them off the list for good."
Darrell S.,"Elkridge, MD",0,17,,4.0,5/27/2017,Very good restaurant. I had an excellent meal and our server was very good. The wings were very good and I had a selection of beer samples that I ordered which was on point. The atmosphere was nice as well. Will try them again
Judi F.,"Columbia, MD",0,3,,5.0,5/27/2017,Great new addition to our area. Extensive menu and the food is very good. The restaurant itself is attractive and clean. Beer lovers will love the variety of brews. The servers are friendly and helpful although it was a slow process actually getting our check and getting it paid. This is a place we will return to often because of the varied menu.
Stu S.,"Columbia, MD",0,47,1,2.0,5/23/2017,"Mixed reviews. Never enough servers here. Very slow. Mahi tacos are terrible, skimpy, barely filled and stale soft shells. Burgers are awesome, ESP the portobello topped. Very filling. Fish and chips decent. $13.00 salads are a joke, pass. Fish and chips were good. This could be great if they had more staff and you know what to pick. I've been 3 times. Bar is super slow. Great selection of beers but trying to get the waitress back is difficult. Opted to purchase alcohol and finish our drinking at home after we left."
Rich S.,"Catonsville, MD",0,3,,2.0,5/21/2017,"This was our first visit. The atmosphere was nice. The food and service on the other hand wasn't very good. My wife ordered a grilled chicken club sandwich. The bread appeared to be grilled in butter or something oily that was dripping wet. She had to pull the bread off and eat was inside. I ordered the cherry chipotle salmon. The salmon tasted good, however the asparagus was so tough it was inedible. The couscous and spinach were floating in oil. Tried to eat it but it was disgusting. The service was also extremely slow. We had to wait a long time to get our check, and also to pay. We may try a second time, but not for a while."
Eliu Junior R.,"Elkridge, MD",11,9,3,5.0,5/6/2017,"love this place so damn much been here about 10 times already I love the food everything has been good, a little slow the first time but its so much better now it helps having the app to make things a lot faster."
Karen F.,"Elkridge, MD",4,120,,4.0,3/9/2017,"Decided to check this place out. Food was good and service friendly.  Had the potato skins to share, Mediterranean tacos for me - chicken with cucumber/ tomato, yogurt sauce on pita, hubby had the spicy peanut chicken with soba noodles. They have lots of beers on tap, some local as well as several crafted sodas - root beer, orange, cream and black cherry.  You can get any of those for a refill so try a couple.  I had the orange and then the cream - both were very good.  The dessert - their pizooki was excellent.  They have specials - pizza night or burger night are 2 of them.  The only thing I didn't like was my pet peeve of the entree coming out before we had time to finish our appetizer.  We had only eaten about half before the meal came. I can see this putting the Buffalo Wild Wings next door out of business."
