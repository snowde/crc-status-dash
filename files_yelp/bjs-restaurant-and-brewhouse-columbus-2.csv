Arun P.,"Dallas, TX",115,147,355,4.0,11/11/2017,"This was a business lunch so service had to be quick.  Well, we were impressed inspite of the restaurant being super busy. Drinks : We tried their cream sodas and they were great.  Feel free to ask for different flavors for a refill. Food : Their menu is a huge book :)  You can pretty much find anything you want to eat.  I tried the clam chowder and it was really good.  For entrees I tried the ham sandwich with fries.  Our table ordered sandwiches to seafood plates and everyone enjoyed their food. Service : Friendly service and our waitress was very efficient and attentive. Ambience : Its in a huge mall with tons of parking.  The restaurant has a casual ambience and is generally crowded during lunch and dinner.  Price : Moderately priced.  There are some expensive dishes on the menu too. Will I return : Absolutely!"
Rachel S.,"Westerville, OH",81,3,,2.0,11/2/2017,"Food is good and consistent. Americana type fare. However, I have ordered take out from here twice. Both times I have ordered ahead by at least 20 minutes, and then once arrived, left waiting a half hour longer. I would be disappointed in eat-in service that took 50 minutes from order to delivery, let alone carry out.  No apology or recognition of a long wait.  The parking lot at this location is not sufficient, so be prepared to circle for awhile."
Laura L.,"Westerville, OH",44,165,138,5.0,10/24/2017,"I have eaten both here at the Easton location and at the Polaris location and I have had great food and service each time. Today, I had lunch with a team from work, and everyone raved about how delicious their meals were. Although I don't review chains very often, I decided to write this review today because I thought my lunch was especially good. Before we left work to go to BJ's, I looked over the menu online. I was very pleased to see that they include the calories for each item. I looked over the menu carefully... everything sounded delicious, but there were a lot of dishes very high in calories. Fortunately, I also found several things in the 500-600 calorie range (and some even lower) that sounded delicious, too. I settled on the fire-roasted barbacoa chicken. This meal was off-the-charts delicious. The menu describes it this way: A barbacoa-spiced, marinated chicken breast served over brown rice and black beans, then topped with feta cheese, cilantro, crema and fire-roasted tomato salsa. (I saw on one version of the menu that the crema is made with Greek yogurt.) [520 calories] Everything in the dish was delicious, but the chicken especially stood out. It was so moist and tender, my fork cut through it like softened butter, and it was seasoned perfectly. I most definitely did not feel like I was skimping or missing out any by getting something with fewer calories. As I mentioned, everyone on my team was raving about how delicious their meals were, so I'm pretty certain five stars was the consensus, and many of them had also gotten lower calorie meals. Thanks, BJ's for offering such delicious options for those of us who want something with fewer calories and putting so much effort into making those options so delicious!!"
Rory A.,"Powell, OH",1,5,18,1.0,1/2/2018,This place sucks! Ordered a kale brussel sprout salad and it came to us without the brussel sprouts! They brought some out on the side after waiting a few minutes topped with burnt plastic!
Mike B.,"Reynoldsburg, OH",1,14,9,4.0,12/30/2017,"First time eating here.  When we arrived, they were packed, but made room for us faster than I expected.  The staff was very friendly and attentive, without being bothersome.  Refills cane fast, and checked about food satisfaction.   I got the fresh tomato and mozzarella salad and the spinach and artichoke dip.  Both were very good.  A good portion of dip, and the salad was very fresh.   For an entree I got the pulled pork and fried onion sandwich.  It was very full of flavor, and the sauce was tangy and good.  Would recommend everything I got as solid options.  Fries were crisp and good.  Portion was more than ample.   All in all, a great dining experience.  I'll be back again next time I'm in the area and want great food and tonight notch service."
Rio G.,"Blacklick, OH",97,9,1,2.0,1/8/2018,Food is good Terrible terrible service . Terrible hosting and wait staff. We had to wait 10 min for server to come and she was rude when she arrived
Katherine N.,"Gahanna, Columbus, OH",182,33,28,3.0,9/7/2017,"BJs is a go-to place if you're looking for some casual, tasty dining that will leave you full and warm. The atmosphere is good for a date night and the bar cocktails or brews are tasty. Try the deep dish pizza and definitely don't skip the Pazookie dessert! Good happy hour prices at the bar. Only complaint is that it gets really busy on Friday nights with families all trying to eat there."
Heather R.,"New Albany, OH",59,18,5,3.0,12/23/2017,"We decided to go here for a few drinks and apps. Ended up ordering the appetizer sampler, and a couple margaritas. Not a huge fan of the food, it seemed liked it was all frozen and heated up at the restaurant."
Amy D.,"Lakewood, OH",114,72,179,2.0,5/7/2017,"I'm not in the habit of frequenting chain restaurants, but alas, sometimes it just is what it is.  I joined a group of colleagues here while visiting Columbus for a work-related trip. I didn't chose the restaurant, and probably wouldn't have based on the previous reviews. But my company was excellent so that made up for the sub-par food and sad service. To start, I joined a table of 5 other people, who had already ordered drinks and were snacking on guacamole and tortilla chips. Within a few minutes the server arrived, acknowledged my presence and offered to take my drink order. I placed my order and rejoined my friends in conversation. The server returned with the salads everyone had ordered before I arrived, but not my drinks. I asked her about them & she looked a little embarrassed and said the bar was backed up. She did return with my drink(s) a few minutes later and offered to replenish our tortilla chips, on the house. That's typically a good sign of customer service, in my experience.  One of my colleagues ordered an appetizer, some sort of southwestern tex-mex flatbread. It was actually pretty yummy and we all munched on it while waiting for our food. Perplexed by the 6428492 page menu, I ordered the sirloin to keep things simple. I should have headed the yelp! reviews ahead of me. The sirloin was about 6 ounces, and coated in some sort of seasoning that resembled Mrs. Dash. I honestly have no idea why one would feel the need to season a steak in this way. It's steak, it's supposed to be naturally delicious. No. Not this steak. It sat in my stomach all night like the dead cow that it was. It kept me up all night, refusing to digest. Oh, what an unhappy meal this was. The asparagus was equally over-seasoned, and the only saving grace where the white cheddar potatoes, which were obviously from some sort of prepared package, but tasty nonetheless. Now onto the sad service. I honestly felt so terrible for our poor, young server. She was so incredibly sweet, and tried her hardest to care for our needs, but she or the restaurant in general kept coming up short. Our food came out in waves, instead of altogether. My friend never got a salad she ordered at the same time as everyone else. My other friend never received a beer she ordered. I had to ask several times for a second glass of wine. When the checks came, my friend who ordered 2 double vodka soda's found that she was charged for 4 separate drinks at $8/piece. $32 for two drinks. After discussing it with her manager the server managed to get that corrected and instead the drinks were $10/piece.  All in all, there are many other restaurants in Columbus. Why chose this one?"
Summer C.,"Reynoldsburg, OH",0,32,,1.0,11/13/2017,"I came here with two other people on a Friday night. We knew It would be busy so we used the online check-in service. The wait was an hour from the point we checked in. We arrived close to the end of that hour and we checked to see if our name was close to being called, It was not, we were told. So we waited with about 40 other people (no exaggeration) in the standing room only waiting area. After 40 more minutes I checked again to see if we were close to being called. The hostess looked confused and couldn't even find our name, and then told us it'd be another 40-50 minutes! We ended up leaving. So unfortunately, I can only give 1 star for this very disappointing experience."
Ronda D.,"Columbus, OH",2,23,10,5.0,11/15/2017,I have found the best wings in Columbus! The Nashville Hot is amazing!! Best sauce around! Always fast service and prompt to fill your needs. I love their beer flights! Try a few!!
Nick B.,"Columbus, OH",44,6,,5.0,11/5/2017,Great service. Great food. Great beer. Pizookie for dessert. Get out of town.  Love this place. I'd go once a week if I could.
Doug S.,"Englewood, CO",0,2,,1.0,12/31/2017,Unbelievably cold in the building you should just eat outside. Crazy!! Will never be back.
Adam R.,"Toledo, OH",180,102,124,2.0,1/16/2017,"I made the mistake of ordering steak. I know it was a bad decision, but I love steak and my wife doesn't eat beef, so I eat it any chance I get. Plus, my in-laws were paying. I order my steak medium rare and it had a lot of char on the outside. That kind of summed up the experience. We ordered the avacado egg rolls as an appetizer for the table. They were kind of mushy and bland. With seven people at the table, we had to pressure people to finish the one order. The service was unnoticeable, neither in a good way no a bad. The wait for a table was long two days after Christmas at a major shopping center. The bathroom had more pictures of Marilyn Monroe than you'd expect. If you're looking for a chain, there are plenty of better choices. If you're looking for something more memorable, there are even better ones. If you're stuck in the area, walk across the parking lot to Chevy's. If somebody insists on going, okay, fin, whatever."
Heather S.,"Columbus, OH",49,191,59,3.0,1/11/2017,"I've been here a few times and realized I've never left a review. We recently went with another couple to catch dinner just after Christmas. The wait time was quoted to be around 25mins or so. There was a mix up in our seating and we waited for about 1.5hrs to get seated. We had requested a table vs. a booth, but there was plenty of opportunity to seat us before we hit 1.5hrs. They do come around with samples of pizza a couple times which was a nice gesture, but getting seated would have been better. Things happen, I know, but the fact that no one seemed to care that we were waiting that long is what was upsetting. An apology, a comp appetizer, or let us know that the tables at the bar were up for grabs! Cause others came in and just took those over.  Anyways, the food is always solid. Nothing fancy or pretentious, just good. They brew their own beers and sodas and that's really their big plus.  Would I go back? Probably, but certainly not on my top 50 list in Columbus."
Senobia S.,"Fairbanks, AK",121,44,82,5.0,1/12/2017,I don't know what time we came in but we walked right in to a table. We just best the rush because not even 10 minutes later there was a long rush.  Tried the Hickory Brisket not bad but don't eat much red meat so feeling heavy on my belly. Other than that it was still delicious. Next time I think I'll try the Cherry Chipotle Salmon.  For dessert we got the sample cookie. The Oreo and cream was AMAZING. Definitely unexpectedly delicious! I also got the Strawberry Beignet to go. Looking forward to that later.  Five stars because the service and food were great. I didn't receive any complaints or dirty looks from my overly exhausted toddler screaming or from my breastfed infant.
Sal-Mir R.,"Blacklick, OH",30,56,74,4.0,7/22/2017,Good food. Great service ! I love the waiter he's super awesome !! Clean friendly !! My wife didn't like her burger but she didn't want to return it. She's pregnant so her appetite is not normal. Waiter offered us sample dessert as a treat. Super awesome !!
J.J. C.,"Columbus, OH",189,60,29,3.0,8/14/2017,"Pizza was a little cold, and despite getting all of our food, we didn't have plates to eat from. We had to ask two different waiters to finally get it."
Mike W.,"League City, TX",1,19,16,5.0,5/25/2017,Ok. 5 stars is easy. Great pace. Service a little slow. But you get to take a growler home. Eat your heart out Texas.
Carlos S.,"Brampton, Canada",21,248,215,2.0,4/28/2016,"A chain restaurant across from Whole Foods. It was clean, modern, and the host was attentive and polite. They make their own beers and have a huge selection. The menu is huge too which seemed like the quality would suffer. I ordered their in house Tatonka stout which is one of their darker beers. For my meal I had Avocado egg rolls for an app and the portobello burger for dinner. You can get it with a meat patty, 2 portobello caps, with a veggie patty, or combination. The Avocado egg rolls were very tasty, filling, and super hot. However, the burger was very bad. The mushroom cap was to big and watery which made the bread soggy. I don't think I'll be back."
Stacy R.,"Reynoldsburg, OH",32,3,,1.0,9/20/2017,"Went here for a after work happy hour.  Food was good, when we finally received it.  They were short handed, but it felt like they totally forgot our group of 12.  There were no apologies or manger that came by to check on us, until one of our party members went to tell the manager.  Checking out was a disaster,  we still had to wait forever.  Manager gave us a coupon for the next visit, but you still had to spend $9.95 to get the free item.  Our group recover customers for a living, so we really tried to be empathic with the staff.  After the way our situation was handled we will not be back.  This was my first and last time visiting BJ's"
John R.,"Groveport, OH",4,23,10,2.0,7/11/2016,"I've been here before, and was not impressed then either. We had a coupon so we thought we would try it again. I ordered the Lemon Thyme Chicken, which, on the menu picture looked very appetizing (attached). Looked like a nice grilled piece of chicken with a dry rub of sorts, Brussels sprouts, onions, and other veggies around it that look to be sautéed. The rice in the picture was also what appears to be white and dry (dry meaning no added sauces), with the food sitting atop. What I was served was completely different, it was a disgusting mass of soaked rice in what I can only describe as an oil bath. I took a close up of the food where I had cleared a small patch of the plate so you can see the oil running out of the rice/sauce, it's that yellow sheen there (also attached). Every grain of rice was COMPLETELY drenched in this oily sauce. It was heavy, and very unappetizing to look at. Very opposite of the ""Light"" dish it is on the menu as. Just my food in of itself deserved only 1 star (heck zero stars). But, saving one extra star was the cook on the chicken, as well as the staff. Chicken was cooked through, hot, and juicy. In addition, my wife's food was rather tasty, which I finished, since I did not eat anything but the chicken from mine (after scraping off the oily mess that it was soaked in). The staff was attentive, friendly, and the waiter was efficient with our order, refills and the check. The flavor was there, and this dish could be really good if it was as pictured, with a light amount of sauce atop a bed of fluffy white (DRY) rice (even brown rice would be a healthier alternative here, and might even get the dish below 500 calories if used instead). Instead it was as if they sautéed the veggies AND the chicken in the same pan with a TON of oil, and then just dumped ALL of it on the plate, rather than picking the veggies out of the sauce and leaving the excess sauce in the pan, which would have been ideal here.  After 2 strikes, I will likely need another coupon to come back to BJ's again, when that happens, hopefully they don't strike out."
John M.,"Northland, Columbus, OH",105,201,1359,4.0,9/9/2015,"I really wish they put that much effort into the food as they do the decor up in BJ's. It's like their trying to be something their not.  FYI, if a restaurant ever has a book with a bizzllion items, chances are the food isn't as great. Great beer selection, I had a very nice waitress, had a nice time with family there but the food is over priced for what it is. It's like the food is good enough to be kinda fancy but not great enough to justify the price. Don't get me wrong my Jambalaya was good. The house salad was half a bowl. Maybe some days tastes better than others? Still better than Applebee's, Champs, Friday's!"
Heath D.,"Columbus, OH",97,172,130,4.0,5/21/2017,"This location does not have the chicken salad or the wedge fries. I love wedge fries and just for this reason will be visiting the Dublin location from here out, even though it is on the other side of town. Bright side: our waitress was on point (says a lot for BJs as their service is what is usually hit or miss in Columbus locations). And the gave us a pazookie with a little candle in it for my B-Day...nice touch."
Dominic S.,"Columbus, OH",82,34,3,5.0,5/7/2017,"Huge menu. Whatever you're in the mood for, I'm sure it's on there. Great house made root beer that comes in a frozen mug."
Wayne G.,"New Albany, OH",0,216,2,2.0,5/11/2017,"Tried BJ's again after a number of months and still the same. My sandwich came out without the ordered toppings, took 30+ minutes to get (2) pizzukis and 2-hours for (4) people to eat dinner. Charles, our server, was courteous and tried to do a great job, but I think the kitchen caused most of the problems."
Mina C.,"New York, NY",0,13,,5.0,10/7/2017,"We always enjoy coming here when we are are in Columbus.  Food is good, serving staff is  friendly and attentive.  We love siting at the bar and watch games on the big screen.  Today, we were here at the OSU game.  Brian the manager went above and beyond.  His entire team is well trained and consistent in good customer service.  Now we know why.  Brain, you are awesome!  Thank you!"
Malkahn M.,"Columbus, OH",103,9,89,3.0,10/5/2016,"My first time coming here. But my only compliant they told us that it would take a hour to be seated.  And two hours later, we were just getting to our seats.  Felt sorry for they little kids with our group.  Not sure what's was going on, on a Tuesday night. But the waiter was really nice and good at her job and the food was great.   So not all bad.  I'll Definitely  come back and try something else.  But I can't say the same thing for the parents with the small children."
Colleen B.,"Columbus, OH",0,9,,2.0,10/15/2017,"On the plus side, the staff was very friendly and courteous. That was a major positive. However, I was told 15 minutes for my carryout order, and it took 30 because they were waiting on an item I didn't order. My medium rare steak was very rare, and it and it's paired side were very cool because of waiting for the unordered side. Also, their dessert menu is pretty singularly focused on their pizzookie. However, they only had 2 of their 6 or so varieties available because they ran out of the others and ran out of vanilla ice cream to go with it. (And this was a good 2.5 hours before closing.)   So, staff is terrific. But, to get a higher rating, they need to get the rest of their act together."
Emily S.,"Athens, OH",0,7,1,1.0,12/8/2016,"This place is terrible. Don't waste your time. First, we showed up at 6 and asked how long the wait would be for a table of 4. We were told 40-50 minutes and so we agreed to wait. An hour later and with no table, I asked the host who told me THIRTEEN parties were ahead of us. When I pressed him why our estimated wait time was so off, he said something about call-aheads (what's the point of a wait time estimate if call-aheads are that much of a problem?!) He assured me we'd be seated soon. We commiserated with others waiting, who had all been told 30-50 minute wait times and now had been waiting for an hour or more.  After a 2 hour wait we were called. But THEN we were told that our table wasn't ready. They had accidentally given it to someone else. Cue more waiting. 2 hours and 15 minutes later, we were finally seated. Unfortunately there was no silverware or anything else at our table. More waiting.  When we finally ordered, they got our order wrong (my medium rare stake came well done...). The rest of our food was mediocre at best.  The apologies from the wait staff and manager were full of excuses and no one would take responsibility.  All told, after arriving at 6pm we left at 9:30!!! 3.5 hours later - and only about 20 minutes of that was spent actually eating. Horrible service, only ok food - this place is a waste of everyone's time and money. EDIT: I don't know how to respond to the manger who commented below, but I would be more than happy to provide more info about our experience if you message me. We did complain to a manger but could only get ahold of the kitchen manager who, though nice, didn't really have much to say about the front staff. (Our waiter was prompt and nice, please don't get him in trouble.)"
Cory M.,"Reynoldsburg, OH",292,5,22,3.0,7/15/2017,The food I got was really delicious! The shrimp and quinoa I recommend - the service however was very poor - set a reservation for a meeting with my colleagues here and we are nothing but a low key normal bunch - the server just forgot so much and they input your order on a tablet right there  - missing chicken on sake extra dressings our coffees at the end what I had to embarrassingly ask another server to get because we were cashed out
Matthew G.,"Columbus, OH",16,127,21,2.0,9/24/2016,"The food is usually pretty good, love the pizookies(sp), but the last few times here the service has been subpar. Slow, inattentive, inaccurate."
Sarah N.,"Columbus, OH",100,61,15,3.0,4/4/2017,Service was sub par. The restaurant was freezing. The food came out salty and the salmon was over cooked. The Thyme chicken tasted boiled and not very flavorful. The bacon cheese burger came without bacon and there was barely any BBQ sauce on the BBQ burger. My pizza was pretty good.
Emily F.,"Columbus, OH",142,1,,4.0,6/1/2017,This BJ's is sometimes a hit or miss. The food is always great but sometimes the service can be spotty. My boyfriend and I wanted a not too crowded place we could watch the Cavs game where we could get food. We drove around to about 3 different places that were too crowded or stopped serving food at 10. We finally landed on BJs and were seated instantly. We ordered an appetizer right when we sat down and two entrees a few moments later. Our appetizer ended up not coming out until after the entrees but before we could even bat an eye the manager was there apologizing and offering to comp the appetizer. It was not even a big deal to us but the manager was so nice and accommodating. This BJs will always be our default when we just don't know what to have for dinner!
Sarah D.,"New Albany, OH",65,15,1,4.0,4/17/2017,"This is one of my favorite Columbus restaurants! My husband and I and our 1 year old have been here lots of times, and we always love it! It's our go-to place. We always bring family here when they visit from out of town because the food is guaranteed to be delicious and the service is always great too. We get a lot of great perks from being members of their program ... free desserts, $10 off, etc! The beer selection is awesome. :)"
Jeffrey P.,"Columbus, OH",25,20,170,4.0,8/10/2016,"It's a chain.  It's BJs. It's the same as every other one there is.   Normally I'd give 3/5, but our server was good and very nice."
John B.,"Columbus, OH",61,11,,1.0,9/25/2016,"Well second time to BJ's at Easton and the last never again. Service was great, our waiter was on top of everything. Things out of his control was the quality of food and how it was repaired. I ordered BJ's Rib-Eye, the other two in our party ordered the Rib-Eye as well and the Lemon Thyme Chicken. My steak did not come out at the same time as the other orders did. I was told that my steak was over cooked? Asked for Medium? The other steak at our table was also medium, so how was it that my steak was over cooked? By the time my steak came the other two were finished with there plates.  My friend Rib-Eye looked awesome thick n juicy cooked medium slightly red inside and he said it was good. The Lemon Chicken, the chicken was cooked fine but the garnish was over cooked and the Brussel sprouts were all burned.  So my steak comes? was it a Rib-Eye? Not sure? It was only 1/2'' thick with 3/4 of it fate and gristle. The meat part was rare as if it had been seared on both side, well one side because when I looked and the underside it was still bleeding.... My asparagus was dry and over cooked, mashed potatoes were good just a very small portion. For $21.95 I would expect an eatable dinner plate to be served? No, am I wrong in expecting this? I can't and will not complain about our waiter he was very apologetic and tried his best to take care of things. The quality of food and how it is cooked was out of his control. The first time to this BJ's I had the Rib-Eye and that time it was all fat and gristle, thick I would have learned my lesson. Get it together Easton BJ's!!!"
Van S.,"Orient, OH",89,267,149,4.0,7/14/2015,"Got a chance to check this place out for lunch last week.  There was no wait a little after noon.  I had the ""Brewhouse Black & Bleu-House"" burger which was fantastic - bursting with flavor from the rich blue cheese and aioli.  The burger was juicy and perfectly cooked.  The server was nice and accommodating even after we changed up how we wanted the checks split.  The waits were a little long between refills.  Also, we were told our waitress would go over a rewards program, but she must have forgotten."
Michele D.,"Columbus, OH",80,12,1,1.0,1/17/2017,"Came there because they had a gluten free menu, the atmosphere is pleasant and service was great.  However gluten free it was not!! I have been very ill ever since.  It wasn't a small contamination I'm questioning weather they gave me a regular pizza vs a gluten free one.  So I get to be sick for days because of this.  I would not!!! I repeat not choose this if food allergies are a concern. Because they don't take it very seriously.  However for your non allergy diners it seems like a nice place."
Angel S.,"Columbus, OH",16,16,2,4.0,1/14/2017,"Good food, excellent staff. They have awesome appetizers. Sometimes I go and just get apps. The desserts are to die for!"
