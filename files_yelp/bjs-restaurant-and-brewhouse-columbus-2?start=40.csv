Joshua R.,"Madison, OH",25,17,2,5.0,4/10/2016,"Short and sweet. Nice place, only stopped by for a night cap. Had an Irish rootbeer. It was amazing."
Steve R.,"Columbus, OH",0,12,2,4.0,12/27/2016,"Met a former co-worker for an after work meal and was very satisfied with my first visit.  All staff were very friendly and even though it was a very busy night during the xmas season, the hostesses and wait staff handled the flurry exceptionally well.  I had the classic tavern cut pizza and an amber brew.  Very tasty pizza and a nice smooth beer.  Not a place I will rush back to but one I will frequent again as I left with a favorable impression."
Brian F.,"Northland, Columbus, OH",68,16,14,3.0,4/6/2016,"We went for lunch and it was extremely loud, which surprised me. This would be a 2 star review if the classic burger wasn't soooo delicious!!!  My friends food came out wrong, and my plate had some bbq sauce crusted on it (I didn't order bbq) and some bits of plastic.... And our server Tana, was not great either. She was hardly at the table and asked stupid questions. I told her no tomato in my burger and she asked if I wanted to add on a tomato basil salad.....uh, no."
Kellee D.,"Columbus, OH",0,1,,5.0,7/15/2017,"I was in last Thursday with my family (large party of 9). Our server, Guy was  such a delight. He was very attentive to our needs. Even gave yummy suggestions to those that couldn't decide. I haven't had great service like that in quite some time. Thanks Guy, the whole family agrees - you're the best!!"
Jim E.,"Carlsbad, CA",57,392,363,4.0,8/9/2015,26 guest taps & 14 house brews. Impressive. Had the seared tuna Salad. Good. Best beer/food selection within 5 miles easy.
Jack S.,"Pickerington, OH",2,16,64,3.0,5/18/2017,"Started in bar with some of BJs craft brews which are excellent! Was seated quickly after the rest of our party arrived(the girl at the door had been given a prior heads up to what our group needed and we were completely accommodated) Not rushed through conversation with our group and after another round ordered. Wife had pizza her way , daughter had something seafoodie which she completely demolished and I had an awesome bison burger. Prices a little high but overall a great experience. Two issues, male server was advised to split checks, he didnt, cost us time only. Second issue was got home and found a bunch of red stain on my pants where I was sitting, either the bar stool or chair had a spill on it causing stains, hopefully they will come out, so watch where you are sitting!!!"
Angie K.,"Philadelphia, PA",15,228,368,5.0,7/26/2015,"Great service, food, and beer. Overall was super happy with our dinner at BJ's. Their prices are spot on; just the right price for the portion and quality. One person at our table got the salmon over quinoa, and another got the mahi-mahi pineapple dish and they both raved about how tender and delicious their fish was (especially for a chain restaurant like this, we were amazed!). Pizzas: They list their pizzas as ""deep-dish,"" but this is really not true. BJ's pizzas are just SERVED in a deep dish, but they are actually pan pizzas. Real deep-dish has a thick crust with lots of sauce and toppings. BJ's pizzas are very light, buttery, flaky crust (i.e. pan pizza) with very little sauce. They did pile on the toppings, which I loved. So was expecting deep-dish, got pan pizza instead. Still awesome tasting, and will definitely get it again! Try the BJ's favorite or Gourmet Five Meat. Beer: Every single beer they brew is delicious. You can get pints, pitchers, or samplers of any beer on tap. They also have guest beers on draft."
Steven H.,"Columbus, OH",70,70,501,4.0,2/19/2016,"This was my first time here at this location you can see they put a great amount of time in to the decor. Nice and roomy i dont feel like you are close to each other. The food was really good and it came out super fast as that being said we did get there before the 6 O'clock traffic so depends on when go it might be a lil slower. The best thing deal was it was happy hour  which you can get mini pizza half off until 6pm the mini pizza is all i need it come with 4 slices and of course i had the deep dish pizza, so i was good an full. We also had the pizookie which is to die for we did half peanut butter and half chocolate chunk. I this the pizzas are a lil high but if you catch the deals its worth your while."
Laura A.,"Des Plaines, IL",3,18,1,2.0,7/28/2016,Food was good but service was bad. It took us 30 mins to get a drink. Also two tables around us agreed.
Veronica C.,"Solon, OH",0,2,,4.0,5/5/2017,"Went here this past Thursday evening around 5:30 pm for the first time with co-workers for happy hour and dinner.  We were in from Cleveland for an overnight work trip.  We didn't wait at all for a table, but as soon as we were seated the place filled up.  The menu was extensive offering options for everyone.  From gourmet salads to steak, everyone in my party was pleased.  Drinks were pricey, even during happy hour. My friend was charged almost $18 for each double she ordered.  The bill was quickly adjusted at her request, but shocking to say the least. Service was mediocre and a little slow, but we weren't in a rush so no biggie. Overall, I would return. The atmosphere and food were great!"
Don R.,"Bradenton, FL",0,8,,2.0,6/26/2016,"If you are concerned about prices, this is not the place have a meal, too pricy and the waitress was reluctant or really didn't know the prices when asked about the items on the menu with no listed prices, mostly drinks. Service was just so, food was good and bad. I order a sirloin steak shrimp combo the steak I requested was to b cooked medium , I was served shrimp popcorn size and my steak was over cooked , my waitress was clueless about return my steak for the correct request, so I just left it on my plate . The iced tea was good. My bill was excess for the food I got, I don't plan to return and strongly recommend you don't get taken like me."
Melissa B.,"Brunswick, OH",138,1,,1.0,6/18/2016,"Have never been to one of these restaurants, will never be back. The host this night had a terrible attitude. Server was awesome but the girl who expo-ed our food out had such a piss poor attitude. Didn't get everything we asked for with our food and she seemed ticked off at us asking for it. Also, we ordered a rib eye steak to split. I have never spit out food at a restaurant, but this was the most overly seasoned and salted steak I have ever had in my entire life. I have worked in restaurants for years and could tell the cooks just slammed seasoning in it and didn't care. Definitely will not recommend or be back"
Luke L.,"Columbus, OH",39,47,4,3.0,11/19/2015,"BJ's is one of the newest chain restaurants available in the Easton area. I would compare it to The Cheesecake Factory -- but with a better beer selection.  Like most chains....their menu caters to all different types of customers. It takes little risk and focuses on creating selections which are neither groundbreaking nor spectacular. This style of food service is not always a bad thing, however it does leave something to be desired by food connoisseur's seeking a revolutionary experience.  The service was great/cheerful and the ambiance is exactly what you should expect from a chain brewhouse. Overall, it is a good family or group destination for people who require many options. It is a better choice than The Cheesecake Factory, Ruby Tuesday, or Fridays."
John K.,"Colorado Springs, CO",6,24,1,2.0,5/22/2016,"Our waitress was great and when my steak came over done the manager apologized, corrected the mistake and gave us free desert. That being said, the steak I ordered was $21.99 and when I order a steak that's $21.99 I have certain expectations. The steak I received  was a half inch thick at most, had large amounts of fat and gristle on it and was over seasoned. It was a steak that at the grocery store would cost $2.50.  On the bright side, their pizza/cookie deserts were awesome.  I've only had one experience at BJ's and that was enough for me.  I would not recommend their featured steak to anyone."
Tom C.,"Columbus, OH",5,16,,4.0,8/7/2016,We always sit at the bar and recieve pretty good service. We love their brewed Creme Soda. The food is hit or miss. They definately are better at somethings than others. The pulled pork sandwich and pizzas are great. The Roast Beef sandwich and ribs not so much. Dessert is great though. Decent place.. we enjoy it. Cheers!
Stephanie P.,"Dublin, OH",53,284,35,4.0,6/30/2015,"The Boy and I wandered in here last week after seeing that it had just opened. The place still had that ""new construction"" smell. There was a large number of staff floating around, probably due to trainers still onsite for the opening. This worked in our favor as everything was smooth as silk. We were seated as soon as we walked in, I expect this won't be possible again once word gets out that they are open. If you've been to a BJ's before, you're already familiar with the layout and menu. I opted for their seasonal beer (which was darn tasty) and the boy went for the blonde ale. We both went for new menu items. I tried the barbacoa chicken off the enLIGHTened menu. It is very good, nicely spiced and cooked perfectly. The Boy had the bbq brisket burger which looked amazing and he reports that it was very tasty. Our server (who, like most of the staff, was new) was prompt, polite and helpful.  They have a takeout door/counter, which seems like an excellent idea for the Easton area. Even though this is another chain, it is a welcome addition to the shopping plaza."
Matt P.,"Columbus, OH",54,201,496,4.0,6/28/2015,"Even thought this place just opened I didn't have any rookie issues with anyone. Seems to be running pretty smooth. It's located in the new Easton Gateway complex and has its own parking lot. It's pretty much the same as the Polaris location but maybe a little less space.  Regardless, I decided to try something off their enLIGHTened menu this time. Specifically the Kale and Roasted Brussels Sprouts Salad, but with added Cajun Shrimp. I'd suggest just asking for shrimp without seasoning. Perhaps for everything you get it added to. Something was a little off with all the flavors of the salad and I think it might have been that Cajun seasoning. Overall it was nice. Worth a try if you're into the whole kale trend and dig roasted brussels sprouts. Neither was overly bitter. Can't visit a BJ's without getting a beer, which they brew themselves, but not on location. I love their Hefeweizen-crisp taste but also a great aroma. I love just sitting there and smelling it. All locations also have seasonals throughout the year, like Pumpkin Ale and others for Oktoberfest and the winter months. They also have a gluten free berry cider as well. It's pretty refreshing and not as sweet as most. This ties in to their gluten free menu, which isn't that extensive but good that they have those options. I'm NOT Gluten free, mind you, but that salad I had was on that menu.  Definitely worth checking out one of their locations. Extensive food and drink menu that would be hard to not find something to enjoy. UPDATE: went back for dinner and got the ahi tuna salad and the sriracha brussels sprouts appetizer together. Also a pint of local CBC Summer Teeth beer. The salad was very good but the size of the tuna in the photo was definitely NOT what I got. A little bait and switch I feel. Also, it had small wasabi dollops in it, which I kept hitting and freaking out about. Needs to be mixed in better. WOW! Brussels sprouts were once again very good but you get a lot of them. Also, never, NEVER eat brussels sprouts twice in one day. Yikes."
Leneen S.,"Crofton, MD",25,50,95,2.0,8/5/2015,I had the body and shrimp tacos one of each. The tacos were full of cabbage and stuffing no meat or shrimp. Disappointment. Got an additional star for very attentive waitress. Staff was friendly.
Marlon G.,"Columbus, OH",6,3,1,5.0,6/3/2016,Sat at the bar with Angel. She delivered fantastic service during a busy happy hour and was flying solo! The food was on point with Chef Adam G rocking it out. Excellent job!!!
Christopher C.,"Methuen, MA",193,33,5,1.0,3/6/2016,"I went in to order take out and I ordered the steak well done. Well done means cooked but not BURNT! The person taking my order asks if they can convince me to go medium because she's in culinary school. Why do I care if you are in culinary school? I told her that they can cook the steak with zero pink without burning it. I get my order and go back to my hotel and the on the to go box the order was placed as ""ex well"" so I open the box and the steak is 100% burnt. Gotta love the asshole response to wanting zero pink. I will NEVER recommend this place to anyone and luckily I'm here on business so I don't plan to be back in the area. Absolutely terrible!"
