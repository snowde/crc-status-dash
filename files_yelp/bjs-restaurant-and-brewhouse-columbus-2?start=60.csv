Daric K.,"Columbus, OH",9,54,17,4.0,9/30/2015,The wife and i tried Bjs this past weekend and we were very pleased. They have a lot to choose from so you should find what your lookin for. We got seated fast with no.wait and the place was packed. My wife had the ribs and i got the double deluxe burger. I think its the best burger ive had in Columbus and ive been to all the places that say they have the best.......uhhhh no. Bjs rock the house when it comes to a damn burger. I tried the ribs too and they were bangin as well. We will be back very soon.
Zach C.,"Columbus, OH",0,5,,1.0,10/22/2016,"Our server Benjamin was great; but they gave him too many tables/people to look after. Shortly after our party of 4 was seated we did drink orders and food orders. Then they sat a table of 16-20 in the same section and things went kind of south from there. I ordered boneless wings and tortilla soup. First cup of soup **barely** Luke warm and the cheese wasn't even melted. Second **comped** bowl of soup... same temp. Boneless wings verging cool temp. Another bowl of chili in our party served cold. After apologizing again and again, I told the server never mind on the soup. (Again, our server was great and did the best he could!). Manager comes by with lucky Tortilla soup #3 in an effort to make amends I suppose, but at this point I'd moved on... I would have liked to have seen the manager more involved. If you're going to over run your server, you could at least help out. Also to note, this was a Friday night about 11:30pm. The restaurant wasn't that busy even after the table of 16-20 was seated. If I was rating our sever, I would do 4/5 stars. But thinking of the experience and **lack** of the mangers involvement; going with 1 star and wishing I had that time and effort back."
S K.,"Columbus, OH",0,3,,1.0,1/5/2017,"I work nearby so have stopped here often to meet coworkers for a drink and meal. Never have I been impressed with the service here, with the exception of Denise. Be prepared to wait for your drinks, your food, your waiter, everything! Just be prepared to wait. The food isn't that great either."
Em G.,"Columbus, OH",44,7,,4.0,10/18/2015,"Nice atmosphere. The host was attentive and very polite. Our server had a great attitude and was very knowledgable. The menu was HUGE and had lots of different options.  I got a cheeseburger and fries. It was tasty and filling. The fries were a little disappointing, they were cut really small and they gave me a bunch of them but overall it was good."
Seneca K.,"Columbus, OH",52,9,,3.0,9/6/2015,"Decided to try the new BJ's last night with the family. Did the wait list on the app to save time. I'm glad I did, otherwise the wait time was 60-80 minutes which is expected for a Saturday evening at Easton, but not easy to do with children.  The service was so slow. Like put your order in and wait 20 minutes to get your drinks and 45 mins to get your appetizer slow. Dinner finally arrived after over an hour. All in all took about 2 hours. Thankfully we had no other plans. I think our server was new to serving.  We didn't see her much but she was nice when we did. Not helpful but nice. The food was okay and portions were good. We got plenty for the money. Overall, it wasn't terrible and we will try again. I think this must have been a fluke. Other parties around us were in and out much faster so we will give it another shot sometime."
Butterfly K.,"Patchogue, NY",1,12,2,4.0,4/4/2016,"The atmosphere was nice and our waitress was great! Was not too impressed with the Lemon Thymes chicken, but the brussel spouts made up for it! Really tasty"
Antonio T.,"Houston, TX",32,87,328,1.0,11/20/2015,"I really try to find the best in every situation, I really do And I generally regard myself as an optimist but, no matter how optimistic I may try to be, there was nothing positive that I can say about my experience here. For starters, I arrived at 7:30 PM and my order wasn't taken until 9:30 PM. Yes, I understand that it was a Friday night and yes I understand that it's in Easton which is a very popular part of town. But I also feel like the establishment should know that. And they should have more than enough people scheduled to work to accommodate the crowd. If you have more people working, people are seated quicker. Those same people then order faster and they eat faster and leave quicker. For me, it all boils down to being prepared. The drinks were ordered and there was a root beer that was placed on the table with absolutely no ice at all. Just root beer and a glass. I sampled a little bit of everyone's plate including the chicken tenders and fries, the fish and french fries, the brisket barbecue burger and my dish which was the baked ziti. The ziti was not cooked al dente. It tasted like it was rinsed in hot water and placed in the broiler. The top level of my pasta was crunchy. Pasta is never supposed to be crunchy. It tasted like someone had gotten some noodles,  poured some Ragu on it, sprinkled some cheese on top and brought it out. And to think they have the audacity to charge me $15 for this. Our server only came to check on us for drinks when we were about to leave so at that point there was no need. Now I understand that everyone has a bad day sometimes. Evidently I caught them on their's. But sometimes once is all it takes for me, especially when there is so many other similar themed restaurants for people to choose from. Needless to say, I probably won't be back."
Albert J.,"Simi Valley, CA",37,74,310,3.0,2/11/2016,"Went after our regional meetings.  Being that I ate pizza this whole trip and it was ash weds., ate very limited food.  Had pasta with shrimp and tomato soup.  Food was par.  Not bad if you want to keep the bill low."
Katie W.,"Columbus, OH",59,12,,5.0,10/7/2016,I love everything at BJs. The deep dish pizza is to die for. I also love their draft selection and pizookies!
Mark M.,"Westerville, OH",2,4,1,2.0,9/6/2016,"We've been to BJ's a million times.  It's the old dependable...large menu selection and you'll typically get a good meal. However, tonight was not one of those nights. Service was okay...it took 5 minutes or so for water...then another 10 for our wine but I don't think that was the fault of our server.  My fiance had the Cobb salad and I had the North Beach Mahi Mahi with Shrimp.  The chicken on her salad was cold..she said it reminded her of a premade ""grab and go"" salad which is not a great compliment.  My fish tasted dry and the best way I can describe it would be freezer burnt. The shrimp were okay if not a little on the fishy side...but overall edible. The dish itself tasted...okay...the sauce had good flavor...the olives and the tomatoes were pretty tasty.  We asked for the check and paid our bill without complaining to the waiter. We did however inform him of the issues with the food before we left. Hopefully it was just an off night but I do feel like the last few visits to this location have been lackluster. I wanted to write this review so that hopefully someone over there will see it and step up their game.  It's nice to have a chain like this in the neighborhood..if they can do it right."
Mark A.,"Atlanta, GA",8,36,11,4.0,3/2/2016,"A great variety on the menu, quality local brew, friendly service.  What more can you ask for. I'd definitely give this place another go when I'm in the area. Great service and comfortable environment. Quality for reasonable price."
Jim F.,"Johnstown, OH",1,91,52,1.0,12/1/2015,"Usually have a good experience here but tonight, not so much I had Chelsea as a server, wow. Did someone tell this child its OK to be incompetent in life as long as your nice.  I don't know where to begin Slow, didn't know the product or menu. Wasn't attentive Food was OK, beer was good"
Mark S.,"Columbus, OH",33,2,,5.0,11/27/2015,Get the hand crafted sodas! I get half black cherry half cream soda. Soooo good!  The bison burger was delicious
CJ V.,"Boston, MA",27,38,9,1.0,8/29/2015,"We never got to seat, so can't say anything about the food. Party of 8, height of rush hour on Saturday. We were told 1 hour wait...fine. let's wait, as this is columbus and this qualifies as good food. After an hour, the hostess had no clue how much more long it will take...kids were  starving and hence cranky,  so left after waiting 1 hour 10 minutes. Thank god they are not on east coast....will never survive with this level of service."
Bruce C.,"Columbus, OH",12,34,,2.0,8/11/2015,"I really liked this place (edit--this part of the review was after my first visit)  Good food, good beer, good service, nice atmosphere.  Negatives...not sure who decided it was as a good idea to have lights hanging in front of the televisions. Edited review. We have been back a few times, and none of our subsequent trips were up to the standards of the first one.   The service has been OK rather than good, and the food has been decent by not great. Tonight was the last straw for me.     My wife wanted to go here for her birthday dinner and I'm sorry we did.    We were there before 5:00 pm and it was pretty empty.  In spite of this, our server could not have been less attentive.   We were seated for at least 5 minutes before he stopped by our table.    It took another 10 minutes before we had our drinks and had a chance to order our food.   My meal was pretty mediocre, but I was extremely hungry and finished it without complaint.   After finishing our meals  we sat for fifteen minutes and didn't see our server at all.    We finally flagged down another waitress and asked for her assistance.    She tracked down our waiter.   He told us he was really busy with two parties behind us--BS, those parties consisted of maybe 10-12 people added together.     On top of the mediocre service, for some reason they felt that Fox News was an appropriate addition to their TV line-up.    Why would you devote so many of your tv's to a channel that is going to alienate a large percentage of your customers.    It was very distracting to try to watch a soccer match on one tv and have the one next to it spewing out political propaganda. Lowering my inital rating two stars for progressively worsening experience on each trip."
Chris E.,"Columbus, OH",50,96,115,5.0,10/19/2015,"Went here for lunch with some friends. Waiter service was great. Quick with the refills. Lunch was spot on. Great food. Huge menu. I ordered the club and it was great. Friends ordered pizzas. They couldn't finish them because they were all full. Restraunt atmosphere is great. Very nice, with a huge bar. Lots of TV's with different things on them."
Lori R.,"Columbus, OH",0,26,3,5.0,11/13/2015,Great food....I asked for my shrimp tacos a little different...came out perfect. Archie was an attentive server and sweet as can be.
Bobbi W.,"Canal Winchester, OH",0,1,,2.0,1/28/2017,"First off, I love BJ's, we have visited the Polaris location several times and have no complaints. However, tonight we decided to visit the Easton location after an afternoon of Disney on Ice. I called ahead at 5:25 to put our name on the list. She said something about being 5 minutes out but it would still be a 45 minute wait. I explained that I was parking and would be there in a few minutes. I walked inside and explained that I had called ahead and that I was on a list and he replied that it was still a 45 minute wait. No problem , my 4 year old is sleeping in the car. Around 6:05 we went back in and checked our wait time. He said there were 5 parties ahead of us. After hearing/watching people get sat , I had my husband check around 6:30. The lady said there were now 6 parties ahead of us ??? WHAT??? I was livid!! Needless to say, the manager got us sat and apologized. Once we were sat that took great care of us! But they need to do a better job seating and taking Call ahead numbers. I will definitely go to BJ's again, but probably not this one!"
Felicia K.,"Columbus, OH",29,8,15,5.0,11/7/2015,1st time here& it was very pleasing. Didn't have to wait long & had a great server(Chaz) & the food was sooo tasty. Root beer glazed wings were definitely a sure thing & the calamari was very good lightly breaded.we'll definitely be back to try out the rest of the menu
Janice J.,"Columbus, OH",0,5,11,5.0,8/14/2015,"I always have a great meal when I go to BJ's. There pizza is awesome! It's Chicago style deep dish and it's done perfectly every time. They don't skimp on toppings either. The last time I went I got their balsamic glazed chicken. Oh my gosh it was so good! It was perfectly seasoned chicken breast over greens with crunchy onions on top, along with some really tasty mashed potatoes. I enjoyed every bite.  They brew their own beer too and it does not disappoint. Also their pizookies are so yummy. They are a perfectly done cookie with ice cream on top. Yum!"
