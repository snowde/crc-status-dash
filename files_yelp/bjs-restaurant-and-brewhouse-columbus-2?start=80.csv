Andrew A.,"Cranberry Township, PA",0,4,,5.0,1/3/2016,"One of my favourite places to go in columbus. Pizza and all other food is amazing as well as the beer selection. Service is hit or miss but never bad enough to warrant a poor review. If you have not tried it, bump the top spot on your to do list."
Denae D.,"Columbus, OH",13,14,,5.0,10/7/2015,"Half price wine Tuesdays and an amazing menu. The ""light"" menu options are fantastic and truly delicious. I had the shrimp and mahi mahi dish and it was perfectly seasoned. Excellent service and a nice vibe. This place also has parking! Oh and if you like beer - the selection is expansive!"
Dan S.,"Mason, OH",20,31,,3.0,6/19/2016,"My sister was in the Columbus area this weekend, so we brought my dad here so the whole family could have lunch together on Father's Day.  This place was decent.  I'm trying to eat healthier, so I ordered the Mediterranean chicken tacos.  They were decent, although the chicken was a little on the dry side.  It came with a side of an orzo/rice type mix that was very cold....I wasn't expecting that, but it is supposed to be served that way.  It was very tasty and had a surprisingly sweet taste that I enjoyed a lot.  Also had a few bites of Pizookie, which was of course incredible.  Our server was very friendly, but could have been a little more prompt removing dirty dishes from the table after we were finished eating.  He had already been back twice to refill drinks and get our drink orders, so it would have been nice if he took a dish or two back.  Oh well, not that big of a deal.  Overall it was pretty good for a chain restaurant.  I probably won't be back to this particular location any time soon, but would have no issue visiting the one in Cincinnati."

Spencer B.,"Granville, OH",12,3,,1.0,8/23/2015,"If you don't want to drink their beer don't go here. When we didn't order beer our waitress no longer was interested in serving our table. She never checked on us and our food order was wrong when we finally got it. Other tables around us that ordered beers had EXCEPTIONALLY better service. Will never go to BJ's again, food was just bad and missing items that it said it came with on the menu."
Sherry C.,"Columbus, OH",0,2,,3.0,5/5/2016,"I expected a great dinner tonight but I was terribly disappointed.  We sat at the bar which usually results in better service. I ordered a salad and then discovered there was no chicken on my salad.  The bartender then took my salad to the kitchen and then she returned--no salad and no explanation. Eventually I was told they were making me a new salad. The salad was delivered with no apology, but my fork was on the salad that was in the kitchen. After 5 min, I got a fork. Hubby's meal was good but not as good as normal."
Brendan B.,"Milton, FL",0,21,3,2.0,5/28/2016,Below average. Steak came out too well done but was promptly returned for a better cut. Waitress spilled drink when pouring. Food quality was mediocre. Beer wasn't anything special. Go someplace else at Easton where you will get more.
Phil V.,"Westerville, OH",100,10,3,4.0,8/15/2015,"Great root beer on tap! Love the mahi tacos! Also their app is great for call ahead seating and ordering, that's right we order from the app before we even get there so the service is quicker."
Sandy C.,"Westerville, OH",39,16,,1.0,10/13/2015,"Allow children to sit at the bar...I'm talking a 4 year old. They claim ""we're a family restaurant"" ok, then have them sit in a booth, away from the bar. Bar stools are not high chairs. Then the family I had a problem with, with their child climbing the barstool every five minutes...started f-you and f-you because I had a problem with it....awesome parents!!!! bartender sided with them..as the loser parents announced, ""we're in here 3-4 times a week"" way to go, parents of the year!!! Will NOT be back!!! It's a ""brewhouse""  not Chuck.E Cheese!"
T W.,"Attleboro, MA",0,23,,1.0,11/22/2015,"Nice atmosphere, good looking menu...and 1 hour and 15 minutes later we walked out the door without knowing how the food was. Got seated immediately, waited a while for a waitress but figured it was just a bad start. No problem. 10 minutes after being seated we finally had an ice tea/water in front of us and placed food order. Fast forward 15 minutes...tea and water refills but no food. Slow forward another 45 minutes and we hadn't seen waitress again. (Did get entertainment watching other waitstaff hand dishes of food to each other and wander the tables trying to figure out where it was destined.) 5 more minutes - 1 hr 15 minutes after sitting down, we went looking for waitress.  Found her and said cancel order. Her answer ""I'm so sorry. I had issues today and I'll take care of your bill."" Uh, ok, thanks. But really, I would have paid for the ice tea and been a whole lot happier had we been told up front she had issues and we wouldn't be getting any food. Hope anyone going there has better luck - we certainly wouldn't try again."
Adam D.,"Grove City, OH",0,1,,2.0,3/29/2016,Service slow the waiter behind us talked way to much about his life.  He completely ruined the mood.  Our waitress very slow not really friendly.  Kids ordered Pizza waitress claimed they where not cooked thru all the way so they had to bake them twice and still not cooked all the way thru.  The chicken I had extremely dry.  Service horrible I guess they should stop talking about their life story and how to become a motivation speaker...oh yea u put me to sleep with ur life story... and focus on their shitty ass jobs....and they messed up the bill....
Lashana J.,"Blacklick, OH",33,1,,1.0,11/8/2015,"This was the worst experience and service I have had in quite a long time. I had attended a party here, and mind you I have been to BJ'S quite a bit In Polaris and Tuttle mall and have had no problem hosting parties. We reserved for 16 people and when we reserved they told us to come 15 minutes before schedule time. We got there 30 min early. It took 2 hrs to get our table. Some of our guess had to leave by the time we were seated because they had waited sooooooooooo long and had other plans. So when we finally sat down instead of the manager coming out to instantly apologize, he tried to spin it around to make it seem like we did something wrong. They tried to please us by offering a free cookie and ice cream if we spent 9.99 which was already a special everyone else was getting for Halloween. Service was horrible, waiters could not keep up with the orders. It was only 10 people and we had 2 waiters and they still could not get it right. After our bill came we asked for the cookies we were promised and they came back and said we had to split them. I will never visit this location again. It was horrible and in fact me and my family won't be going back to any BJ's."
Kevin K.,"Blacklick, OH",0,5,,5.0,2/1/2016,"Our son recommended BJ's at Easton and they did not disappoint.  The salad, drinks, and dinner were Great !!  Can't wait to go back !!!"
Kimberly H.,"New Albany, OH",1,19,,4.0,9/6/2015,"This place is really a great place to go for a wonderful variety of food.  Their Chicago style deep dish pizza is excellent!!  If you don't want that and prefer a fresh salmon dish, they have it.  If you want Steak they've got it.  Get the picture? Anyway you can go with a group of friends and there will be something to please everybody.  I've been there many times and the best server Zahaire.  He was incredible.  He was attentive and accurate and really a good customer service.  I always make sure to sit in his section.  One time I went there and he wasn't working so I was seated in Nikki's section.  She was fabulous too!!  She made sure we were happy with our food and visit too.  BJs hires exceptional staff from once you walk in the door with the hosts to servers and food quality.    You will be very pleased with the selection, service and affordable prices.  I don't know about you but I find it hard in Ohio to locate an awesome Mojito.   Look no further I have had BJ s original Mojito and it was phenomenal and their watermelon Mojito was good as well.  !  Make your next meal at BJS and you won't be disappointed!"
Robert S.,"Chillicothe, OH",52,59,49,3.0,8/9/2015,Had a late lunch here today with a friend and was excited to try BJ's again since I had eaten one in Texas years ago. The hostess tried to seat us but the table wasn't ready yet so we were seated at a small booth for two. We both looked over the menu and both decided to order sirloin steaks. Our waitress took our order. My friend had ordered a wedge salad with no tomatoes. Salad came and it had tomatoes on it. She took the tomatoes off and ate the salad with no complaints. As we were finishing up our salads our waitress came by and asked us if we were ready for the check or did we want dessert??  I told her that we had not even had our main course yet. She looked at us like she was confused. She apologized and said she would check on our food. Food came in a reasonable amount of time and food runner asked us to cut into our steaks. I had ordered my medium and my friend has ordered hers medium well. Mine looked ok but my friends looked medium rare. The food runner apologized and took the steak back. When my friends steak came back it was prepared to her liking at medium well. I was disappointed in the steam asparagus. It was a very small portion and they did not have much seasoning on them. I also thought the sirloin was small for the price. The menu did not specify how many ounces you were to receive. Overall the steak had a good taste. If we go back we both agreed we would try a burger because s neighboring tables burgers looked good. I'm hoping that this new location is still working out all the kinks and will provide a better meal next time we come in. Overall a little less than average dining experience today.
John S.,"Westerville, OH",0,63,,3.0,12/18/2015,We enjoy the Steltzer Rd location much over the Polaris location. Food prep and service are generally better with faster seating.
