Brandon W.,"Columbus, OH",115,25,67,4.0,1/6/2018,"BJ's has sufficient space for a lot of big crowds and they are well staffed. Although the acoustics are not always the greatest.. ""I'M SORRY, WHAT?!"" My husband orders a Great White pizza every time we're there and we're never dissatisfied. Crispy outer edge of the crust with a soft and chewy inside. The tomatoes, that are on top, really bring the pizza all together.  As the name states, there is a good amount of brews to choose from. I just recently found out that they carry Boulevard Wheat, which is my favorite beer!!! KCMO baby!! Ending a meal with a Pizookie is awesome! They're served in the dishes in which they're baked with a heaping scoop of ice cream on top."
Jordan N.,"Columbus, OH",284,108,431,4.0,12/14/2017,"We came for the pizookies this time. Have you had one yet? They're cookies in a deep dish pan baked and served with a scoop of icecream on top. The regulars are pretty large, but they have a trio sampler with 3 smaller pizookies. Not all of the flavors are offered in the sampler, but there's still a great selection. We had the cookies and cream, peanut butter, and macadamia nut. My favorite is the cookies and cream, it's a chocolate cookie but it's not too rich, I found the macadamia nut to be too sweet, and the peanut butter is always delicious. The peanut butter has real full sized peanuts in it, not my favorite part, but FYI.  If you have a rewards card with them they have various discounts on pizookies, so look before you order!"
Itsm E.,"Gainesville, FL",3,151,16,4.0,11/12/2017,"Came here last week to eat lunch and the service was great. There was some kind of party going on next to my table; however, the server was very attentive and came by the table frequently to make sure the food was okay and to ask if my table needed anything. The food was pretty good with the exception of cold sweet potato fries. I simply let my server know and he quickly replaced the cold fries with hot fries. I will definitely return again!  My servers name was Lorenzo! Thanks!"
Tim F.,"San Diego, CA",151,172,227,4.0,9/29/2017,BJ's can he hit or miss but this location is exceptional.   Customer service here is Outstanding!   Food is good and overall pleasant experience  Ordered 4 entrees and 2 appetizers.  The appetizers were late and served after he entrees were on the table.  The waitress and the manager both came and apologized and removed them both from the bill.  Amazing.   Very impressive management.   This is a popular location and rightfully so.  Highly recommended!
Liz T.,"Dearborn Heights, MI",153,301,124,3.0,11/6/2017,"Girls weekend lunch and it was okay.  Nothing bad, but certainly nothing to make me visit them again.  Menu had a wide variety of food, lots of choices that looked really good.   It was just okay.  Okay food, okay service, okay."
Mark M.,"Niagara Falls, NY",136,1018,6165,5.0,5/18/2017,"Came in here tonight for dinner and had a great time. This was our second time here and it was even better than the last.  They sat us at a booth near the bar so we could watch the Sports and chat.  The decor of this place is amazing with the huge mural on the wall near us. Marble tables, brick around the entrance, nice use of wood in the dining room, this is upscale.  Our server was really friendly and immediately took our order. We chose the Buffalo hot and spicy wings. They were nice and crispy on the outside and a little hot, but not too much, perfect. Got about 10 of them. Next time we will try the Extraaa hot!    For our entrees we both got the house sirloin steak.  One with mashed and asparagus, the other with chili and house salad. Both were cooked perfectly.  The mashed tasted super creamy, the steak was nicely seasoned on top with excellent flavor. The chili was a bit too salty but good nonetheless.   We passed on the pizookie for dessert as we were stuffed. We had that last time and it was warm and delicious! Everything seems to be cooked well here, highly recommended!"
Jim S.,"Clintonville, Columbus, OH",0,13,,5.0,1/8/2018,"Favorite restaurant in the Columbus area. Great food, so many choices and great prices"
Danielle F.,"Columbus, OH",242,144,117,3.0,4/21/2017,"Decent restaurant. I went on a busy Saturday evening, with a 25 minute wait time the bar was the best option. Such a big menu with a lot of variety. Great for families.  I had the burger and was able to add a side of onion straws with no extra charge. Noticed onion straws on the pork sandwich and wanted them on my burger. Pizza I tried was slightly dry/overcooked.  I was able to sign up for their rewards program while there to take advantage of the pizookie. So good! I'd go back for that anyday!"
Nick M.,"Cleveland, OH",7,50,,4.0,11/10/2017,"Really great atmosphere. The cheese curds are really good as is the meatball appetizers. I ended up getting a steak with a cedar salad. I have to say the steak was really, really, good. It was prepared to near perfection and overall the prices are fair and the wait staff is really kind and professional. I'll be back."
E P.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",14,8,,1.0,12/17/2017,Absolutely atrocious... SLOW isn't even a fair description.  Time the service on a sundial.  I wouldn't suggest this place ever.  Not even a busy evening.  Sunday in December.
Greg F.,"Westerville, OH",0,15,3,4.0,12/26/2017,"Went in Christmas Eve 2pm or so. Solid food, good service. Got the tavern pizza, was nicely done, plenty of toppings, and came quickly. Bjs service was very good, will go back again. Typical pub food, clean, easy in and out."
Malini S.,"Columbus, OH",97,122,133,4.0,7/11/2017,"Pretty good spot for a family, an afterwork happy hour, or for meeting friends. Their large menu ensures that everyone can find something to eat. I'm not a huge beer fan, but they have some things I like and I LOVE their vanilla cream sodas. My husband IS a beer fan and likes their selection. I appreciate the smaller portioned items as it's fun to piece together a meal by choosing a couple smaller portions, but they also have regular sized portions as well. Save room for the cookie dessert."
David T.,"Columbus, OH",9,47,19,4.0,7/15/2017,Went here to grabbed lunch with some friends. The hostess was very nice! She seated us immediately during busy lunch hours. Our waitress came out with water as soon as we were seated. The food is always fantastic here. I got the salmon with the quinoa and my wife got the ahi tuna salad. Both were very good and the prices are reasonable. My wife also got a margarita and that thing was extremely sweet. I wasn't a fan of it but that was probably the only thing that I didn't enjoyed.  The ambiance at lunch is always a busy scene but that doesn't stop the staff from making sure all their guests are accommodated. That is one great thing about this place. I've taken coworkers here to eat at lunch countless times and intend on coming back in the near future.
Casey G.,"Delaware, OH",40,138,61,4.0,5/21/2017,"Tried BJ's curbside takeout...it needs some improvement.   Ordering online is a breeze. Super simple mobile site that's easy to use. Props for the useful site. However, I parked curbside and tried to call the number, the phone just kept ringing busy. Went inside and my order was still not ready, and the mobile site did not autopay. Not quite sure how the curbside works if you don't put your card info on the mobile. That is a lot of running in and out doors.  I do love BJ's deep dish pizzas. They are a favorite go to dish when I am looking for take out. Tonight's pizza was no exception. It hit the spot after a long day."
Aaron S.,"Columbus, OH",10,19,3,5.0,12/4/2017,"I love this place, this location in particular. I have been to other BJ's that lacked in service. The menu is huge with something for just about everyone. That being said I should admit I am that boring person who orders the same thing I like at certain places every time I go. I like consistent food cooking & portions. This place gets it done. I always sub sides which is easily done and I've never had a hard time doing it. Good in house beer selection and I always go for the BJ' Brewhouse Blonde. Even during peak hours the wait usually isn't terrible. It's a decent size and good for work groups or just a night out. My fav is cherry chipotle glazed salmon with cheddar mashed potatoes & rice pilaf sides."
Lynn D.,"Dublin, OH",9,147,1,4.0,8/14/2017,"Have been to the Dublin location many times, but this was my first at Polaris. It did not disappoint. Lunch with my daughter...beer, hamburgers, and a cookie dessert. What could be better. The service was seamless and friendly. We were given plenty of time to chat which was the point. The restaurant it very nice and was great. Too bad it's so far,  it I'm still a BJ fan!"
Marsha H.,"Miami, FL",38,9,,3.0,12/7/2017,My daughter my husband and myself were out shopping the other night and stopped in for happy hour too bad our waitress what is the coldest person I have ever met she basically ignored us because we weren't ordering meals just drinks and appetizers my husband decided to order a hamburger and fries she took his order and walked away didn't even ask if anything else was needed by anyone at the table food was good waitress was bad
Stephanie F.,"Cincinnati, OH",54,62,105,4.0,3/26/2017,"I've always though BJ's was just fine.  I didn't hate it, but it didn't knock my socks off.  I guess that's because I've been ordering the wrong thing!  The ribs are GREAT.  Not only are the tender, flavorful and juicy, they're super cheap on Thursdays!  They offer a half rack for $13.99 or a full rack for $18.99.  This includes 2 sides, a house salad and a mini pizuki for dessert.  What a deal!!!  I went for the mashed potatoes, broccoli and the triple chocolate pizuki.  All solid.  The service was friendly, the atmosphere is bar like, but on a larger, nicer scale.  I was extremely satisfied and felt great about the deal!"
Jim H.,"Westerville, OH",26,336,45,3.0,7/3/2017,"This is my 3rd review of BJ's and while I continue to be a fan of this restaurant, I think they need to ""up their game"" a little and pay more attention to details.  First -- the good news -- they do order ""wait list seating"" which is similar to the call-ahead seating used by other restaurants. For anyone who has dined at any of the Polaris Parkway restaurants on a Friday or Saturday night can tell you -- wait list seating is a big plus. Our most recent visit was on a Saturday night and it was a disappointing experience.  My wife and I both ordered salads - mine was a tomato / mozzaella salad and my wife's was a ""house salad.  Mine was fine but her salad was served without ANY dressing.  When we called this to the waitresses' attention, she was very apologetic and immediately headed back for the dressing.  It was at least 5 minutes before the dressing was served.  Then, we both ordered burgers,  I requested mine to be cooked medium (my default for burgers and ground beef); my wife asked for hers be be medium well (NO PINK in the center).  Well -- my burger was closer to medium well but was still acceptable to me but my wife's burger was definitely medium RARE as opposed to medium WELL - nice an pink and juicy in the middle.  AGAIN, the waitress was very apologetic and she took my wife's burger back to the kitchen.  She stopped at the table 2 or 3 times to tell us that the burger would be ""RIGHT OUT"" but -- in reality - it took well over 10 minutes for my wife to get a new burger -- while my burger got cold. Finally - when we thought we had seen everything -- we got our check and discovered that we had been DOUBLE-CHARGED for my wife's burger. AGAIN - MORE APOLOGIES - and a revised check. Overall -- the food was excellent (once we get what we ordered).  The waitress was very professional, very polished and pleasant and -- in normal circumstances - I would have said she was an excellent waitress. But with 3 major screw-ups, I have to think she bears some of the responsibility. Based on tonight's overall experience, I can't rate BJ's any higher than a 3-star - despite the quality of their food and their generally decent service."
Ryan C.,"Morral, OH",61,101,67,4.0,8/4/2017,"Can't say I have ever had a bad experience here.  The menu offers a very wide variety of food - and it's all of good quality.   Be prepared to wait - that quality comes with a price, in the form of longer waits. It's very family friendly and somewhat noisy.  However, that does not detract from the over experience of great service and quality dining."
Danielle G.,"Lexington, KY",125,26,26,3.0,5/15/2017,"Service was slow with their new tablet system that the servers use. The watermelon margarita is delicious but not very strong. The top-shelf margarita tasted like pure tequila with a splash of lime juice.  Order the best beginnings appetizer if you want a variety for a large group but ask for extra chips because they don't give you enough. The pizza flatbread was good too, we added pineapples.  I like BJs food, especially when I want chain-type appetizers but I rarely go because their service is always so hit or miss."
Joanna W.,"Columbus, OH",53,39,20,4.0,6/22/2017,The twisted BLT salad is a great bang for your buck! The baked ziti is great also. My boyfriend and I have been here a few times. The Brewhouse Blonde and Light Lager is amazing too. What sticks out the most is the pizookie! Wow!! Love it and will get one each time I am there! Always bring my best friend and her husband here as they love it just for the pizookie!
Sandy J.,"Bloomington, IN",15,6,60,2.0,10/24/2017,"I felt this restaurant was a bit off tonight. The place was a bit busy for a Tuesday night. Wait time was about 15 minutes but there were tables available and there seemed to be enough servers, etc. My steak was good but the mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli were a bit cool so that the butter I finally received from the server didn't melt on the veggies. Hubby got the pulled pork, which had hard pieces in it. Lastly, the wine was to be 50% off on Wine Down Tuesday but it didn't automatically get marked down. I had to ask the manager to fix it."
Devon R.,"Hamilton, Canada",10,56,1,4.0,11/1/2017,Food was so fast which was surprising since it was very busy. Mediterranean pizza was delicious. Service was friendly and efficient even though she was busy. Only problem is bathrooms which seems to be the case at every BJs
John R.,"Westerville, OH",0,3,,5.0,10/25/2017,"I love BJS - carry out or dine in. I always get the same thing. Pale Ale Chili, off the hook good. Santa Fe Salad with blackened salmon. Only knock there is it isn't as ""blackened"" as what purists consider blackened. More like ""seasoned."" Seared ahi salad. Perfect ahi, delish dressing and all salads are FRESH! Get dressing on side, and add. Great service, clean and family friendly. Great beers as well, never been disappointed!"
Rue F.,"Brandon, MS",3,52,10,3.0,6/15/2017,"Busy place. Ordered iced coffee and iced tea at lunchtime. Waitress dropped off our drinks and scurried away. Had to flag her down to ask for sweetener. Not starting off well.     Rapidly going downhill. My soup and salad arrived, husbands burger promised to arrive soon....  had to send soup back, lukewarm at best.     Once everything was properly delivered the verdict is in. Soup and salad just ok. Would not order it again. So sad. I love chicken tortilla soup but this was a fail. Jim's bison burger however was very good. Arrived hot and medium rare. Accompanying chop salad was also tasty."
Mac W.,"Slate Hill, Columbus, OH",65,6,,4.0,10/2/2017,"I know this is a ""chain"" restaurant but they always do a great job when we visit. The menu selection is huge and anyone can find something they like. We always get calamari to start because it's pretty amazing!    Pizza and pazookie for me. Tuna for my girlfriend and all the dishes were right on point. Large TVs help as well!"
Stephanie T.,"Port Orange, FL",2,9,7,5.0,9/7/2017,Great place. Always go here when visiting our college student. Great variety and very casual.
Kelly T.,"Addison, Dallas, TX",228,122,163,5.0,9/10/2016,"Why isn't there a BJ's in Philly yet? I don't understand! I came here a while ago when I was in town, but I'm still dreaming about the Pazookie. I also got the salmon when I was there. Both were amazing. This place is what I think about when I think about Columbus, OH. I came here for the Arnold expo, btw. That was almost half a year ago!"
Lori O.,"Columbus, OH",1,12,23,5.0,5/18/2017,Took my managers to lunch here today. The service was stellar first off! We wouldn't be finished with half of our waters & drinks & would have another one sitting in front of us! Server was fantastic & she recommended the kale & Brussels sprout salad with salmon it was absolutely delicious! 2 others had the cherry salmon & they both thoroughly enjoyed theirs too! Price was on point for the quality of food served! Highly recommend & will be back!
Col K.,"Odenton, MD",10,15,,5.0,9/7/2017,"Visited this restaurant a year ago while in Columbus visiting grandson and family. Staying at a Polaris made this place very convenient. Friday night of Labor Day weekend was busy, however wait was no more than 10 minutes. Aliecia took great care of us (4 adults and two kids in high chairs.) Alcoholic drinks, especially their bloody mary's were terrific. Wife's long island ice tea was perfect. Best beginnings sample was a wide variety of different appetizers..all prepared perfectly. Flatbread was terrific as well as the root beer glazed ribs. Son's pizza was hot and prepared as ordered. I would definitely return to BJ's on our next visit to Columbus."
Lisa M.,"Indianapolis, IN",121,103,178,4.0,8/2/2016,Overall great experience! The food was good (not fantastic) and they had a lot of options. We started with the spinach dip and then I had a buffalo chicken grilled cheese. Unfortunately I burnt my mouth from the spinach dip so the buffalo sauce made my mouth hurt & hard to enjoy. It was tasty though! Our server was amazing!!! And I wish I remembered his name. We tried some of their draft beers and I loved the berry cider. Also the flight of beer was a great deal! Would definitely return
Tami H.,"Sunbury, OH",11,3,,1.0,5/20/2017,"Everything was cold beginning with our appetizers.It got worse.We waited roughly 45 min for our food which was then delivered..... COLD!!Shouldn't it  have been hot considering our wait? Since our server didn't return the kids ate the cold food anyway.....I explained to the manager our food was cold EVERY SINGLE DISH.She ""apologized"" yet had the nerve to give us a check? You're joking right?!?! I already told her I would never return and even expressed my astonishment in receiving a bill.She didn't care. What's worse is it ruined our night.This was my sons graduation dinner.What a disaster! Shame on you BJs! I plan to share this experience far and wide! With all the places to eat at Polaris BJs is not a place to consider.You can go to a soup kitchen and get better food and service GUARANTEED."
Rebekah B.,"Columbus, OH",49,17,,2.0,5/14/2017,"Went in on a Monday night wasn't too busy so I cant blame the food experience on that but I ordered the Santa Fe Chicken Salad I believe it was around $15 and it was TERRIBLE there was literally 4 tiny pieces of chicken no avocado, corn just a TON of lettuce it looked nothing like the picture. I sent it back with my complaints and the salad literally came back looking the same.... its a salad its not that hard!!!!"
Sah-Yu G.,"Baton Rouge, LA",0,24,30,3.0,7/31/2017,"A uber driver highly recommended it . So i checked it out. This place was more crowded than the other restaurants nearby. Ordered the cherry chipotle salmon which was said to be the most popular dish. The salmon was ok but  the asparagus was over-cook. Overall, Fell short of my expectations."
Johnson Y.,"Hilliard, OH",0,80,20,4.0,8/3/2017,"Great service for dine-in, tasty food, very accommodating staff for large parties and children.  Cool looking, clean place.  Parking lot is a bit tight."
Philip S.,"Columbus, OH",23,1,,1.0,5/20/2017,The menu is too large.. meaning they can't be great at everything. The artichoke dip is bland and flavorless. For the second visit in a row I've needed to send something back. I rarely do that as I don't want to complain a lot. Last time I specifically asked for no blue cheese on my salad. Blue cheese came on it. Wouldn't have been such a big deal but including the wait it was like two hours to get what I asked for.. and what ended up being a pretty average and overpriced salad. Additionally there was no offer to comp anything. This time I asked for a burger medium well. It was barely medium. Now my date once again sits eating her meal and I'm miserable. Go to Matt the Millers. I went there last week. My burger was cooked to perfection and tasted amazing! I'm never coming back here.
Sarah D.,"Columbus, OH",32,52,206,4.0,4/3/2016,"I've been to BJ's several times now and it's always consistent. The menu is extensive enough too that anyone can pretty much find something to order. Their house made sodas and beers are always good. My favorites are the vanilla cream soda and their Berry Burst Cider. There are free refills on the sodas and our waitress even brought us to-go cups when we didn't finish ours at the table. That was above and beyond regular service in my opinion. The vanilla cream soda is so good that we'll even make a stop at the restaurant just to get a cup to-go now and nothing else. As for the food, I've had several items, but I always keep coming back to the New Orleans Jambalaya. It definitely has some heat, so it's not for the faint of heart if you can't handle spice.  I would recommend signing up for their rewards program to get future promos and discounts. The $10 off $35 deal on Yelp is also pretty amazing, so be sure to click on it and show it to your server."
Wendy G.,"Dublin, OH",0,6,,2.0,7/23/2017,"Used to love this place. It it has really gone downhill... Went with my husband and two friends last night - the place wasn't even that busy. Took 10 minutes to get our drinks and about 20 or so minutes to get our food.  I ordered the spaghetti and it was slimy and cold... clearly had just been sitting out waiting. The waitress was nowhere to be found so I ate a small portion and just dealt with it.  Once our checks came, we set the card our immediately and several minutes later she came to get them and then took another 10-15 minutes to bring them back. We allotted an hour and 40 minutes for dinner before a movie we wanted to see just around the corner and because of the delays we were aost late. Crazy... please up the quality of your staff... $42 for a mediocre meal and subpar service."
Gina M.,"Chelsea, Manhattan, NY",300,208,659,3.0,5/18/2015,"This is another chain that has found a home at Polaris. Famous for their deep dish pizzas and beer options, BJ's does have good food and a family atmosphere. Consistent with most of my experience in chains though, the service isn't the greatest. I think that every time I've been here, someone has brought out the wrong food, our food was taken to the wrong table, or it took us forever to order. Tiny service issues like this are what prevents me from recommending this place to larger groups. For a small group though (especially if you have kids) this place can be fun and the food is perfect. I will also include that the prices are fairly low, and they always say you get what you pay for, so I can't be too angry about the sub par service. Also, shout out to BJ's for doing a great job with their gluten free options: my parents love the gluten free pizzas and the gluten free pizza cookies!!"
