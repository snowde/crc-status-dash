Michael G.,"Reynoldsburg, OH",8,17,,4.0,12/24/2012,"BJ's is really good.  Beer is great and the food was good.  It was pretty cheap for lunch too.  My wife and I both had meals, she had a soda, and I had a beer for cheaper than lunch at Panera would have cost."
Nick K.,"Westerville, OH",11,63,1,4.0,8/21/2010,"I've never had a bad experience here and any criticism would only be knit-picky.  4 stars is a really good review for me, FYI.  It's almost always packed, but it's worth it.  The menu is huge, the staff is friendly and helpful, the food is delicious, and they brew their own beer.   I personally recommend the Jambalaya and the Parmesan Crusted Chicken.  So Good."
Live Laugh L.,"Delaware, OH",0,19,,5.0,4/3/2012,"This is by far my favorite restaurant!! My suggestions are: avacado egg rolls, chicken tortilla soup, black cherry soda, california chicken sandwich. I can't wait to go back. Everything about them is great!"
Nicole L.,"Glendale Heights, IL",29,616,566,3.0,5/26/2010,"Not a bad place. Pretty big menu with more than a few things that sounded good. I had the Parmesan crusted chicken and it was pretty good. Nothing mind blowing, though.  I do suggest coming here for the pazookie. The other reviewers weren't kidding - it's delicious. We had the Oreo one which is basically a fresh from the oven oversized chocolate chip cookie with three scoops of vanilla ice cream and Oreo-flavored whip cream on top. And it was heaven from the first bite to the last. If I were you I'd grab dinner elsewhere but stop here for dessert. I'm going to dream about pazookie now."
Kyle H.,"Groveport, OH",6,19,1,4.0,3/29/2013,"A friend suggested i try this place out, so i figured while in Columbus to stop in for dinner. The wait was not too bad, about 20 minutes. The place was pretty crowded for being tuesday evening after peak dinner hours, so i took that as a good sign for the quality. The seating was comfortable and the lighting in the two-person booth was just right to see the food but also leave a romantic glimmer in the eye of the person you eat with. Major plus for me. The only strange thing was that the table was clean and prepared, but with the check from the previous diners still on the table. Kinda strange. I ordered the stout, which was really full of flavor and veeeery heavy, which I love. Major points there. For dinner, I had the Mahi-Mahi Tacos, which originally i was concerned it wouldnt be enough at first, only getting two tacos. They had a good filling of Mahi, though and considering the stout and the tortillas/guacamole that came with the tacos, it ended up being the right amount of food. Overall it was great, but we experienced similar service as other reviews mention. In our case, it was just being sort of unattentive to what was happening, but then again they were busy."
Jeremy R.,"Columbus, OH",15,14,2,3.0,6/13/2012,"Ok beer, ok food, and ok prices. They do have arrogant bastard on tap, and the baked potats are massive! Better than Fridays, but still mediocrity on the quality scale"
Andrew E.,"Downtown, Columbus, OH",15,7,,3.0,5/10/2014,I went in for lunch. The food was good but nothing spectacular. I would go back again and sit at the bar which looked very nice. Looks like a great beer selection
Derek S.,"Columbus, OH",49,64,15,2.0,8/26/2011,"If Applebee's and Cheesecake Factory had a baby, it would be BJ's. Cheesecake Factory because the expensive and extensive menu. Applebee's for the lack of quality. Another saving grace was the brewery on location with several different ""flavors."" I went with the blonde brew because it paired well with my menu selection of Scampi Pasta and calamari. The calamari was large in quantity but was mostly just breading and hardly any meat. The pasta was ok, it normally comes with angel hair, but i changed it to fettucini with no problems. I had forgotten to tell them no tomatos also which they fixed before it came to the table when the waiter brought my girlfriends salad out. Even though i liked the pasta it was still very ""meh"", like it had almost no flavor what so ever. I think ill pass on going there again."
Lyndsey M.,"Columbus, OH",22,53,3,2.0,7/6/2011,"Ok, so I don't make it to the 'burbs much, but this holiday weekend after boating at Alum Creek, my family decided to get some food.  My uncle suggested we go to BJ's because they had good beer and decent food.  I totally agree on that first point.  The beer is good.  I had a Hefeweizen that was totally tasty and summer appropriate.  That's where the better than average ends.   My boyfriend (who is 29), forgot his ID, and thus could not get a beer.  Boo.  I mean, I get it, but frustrating.  Next up, the appetizers.  We had very standard chips/salsa and spinach artichoke dip.  I've definitely had better, pretty much, well everywhere.  Then there was a loooooong lag time between our appetizers and entrees.  I ordered a southwest salad with chicken.  It was, well, adequate.  The dressing was super duper salty, so I'm glad I ordered it on the side.  The corn was for sure from a can, the cheese a standard uber processed blend from a bag, and the lettuce really unremarkable.  Heck, even the avocado tasted meh.  And I love avocado!  The entire table was served....save for my poor bf.  His dish was apparently forgotten or something.  After 5-6 minutes, here comes his dish, and it's the wrong one.  Ok.  Just send it back.  Almost immediately, ta da, here is the right dish.  The refills on drinks took a very long time.  When my water was finally refilled, she filled it halfway.  Um.  What?  Yeah.  That pretty much sums up my BJ's experience.  Come for a beer, leave before you get hungry.  I also felt like the check was a bit more than what I'd value the meal at.  Two pretty meh, standard entrees and a beer for $30?  Nah.  I'll pass on this one again."
Paul D.,"Northport, AL",0,4,,4.0,10/18/2012,Pretty good food and atmosphere. The Pumpkin Spice Ale was amazing!!!
Becca P.,"West Sacramento, CA",264,61,7,2.0,8/27/2011,"After ranting and raving about how great the BJ's in CA are me and my boyfriend went here for dinner, expecting an amazing experiance, but we were very disappointed. I got the grilled chicken pasta as always but  the food here was flavorless, and the salad i ordered was a sad excuse for a wedge salad. My boyfriend ordered the shrimp scampi and was also very disappointed. Dont bother ordering the calamari either, its all breading and deep fried in dirty tasting oil. Service was OK but i have had way better, waiter was monotone and boring. I dont think i will be eating at this BJ's ever again."
Loren G.,"Lewis Center, OH",0,6,,2.0,7/8/2015,"Tonight was my second visit there- was a little overwhelmed by the large menu selection- everything looked so good it was difficult to choose. Finally decided on the sirloin steak with cheddar mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. Was disappointed when they brought out a small plain white plate with a very small piece of steak (maybe about a quarter size of the one pictured in the menu), a  few broccoli florets, and a scoop of mashed potatoes that reminded me of the mashed potatoes served with an ice cream scoop in the cafeteria in grade school. They could have at least put a piece of parsley on the plate or something- it all looked so bland. Had a Long Island iced tea for about $10 that was almost entirely ice- what a rip-off. My husband ordered a full rack of ribs with rice pilaf and brussel sprouts, and when I asked him how his food was he said it was ""just okay."" Ordered the triple chocolate cookie with ice cream for dessert, and even though it was shown with vanilla ice cream in the menu it was served with chocolate ice cream & chocolate chips (way too much chocolate! We could eat only a few spoonfuls. And speaking of spoons, the dessert was served with one regular spoon and one soup spoon.) The place was packed while we were there and I have to say I can't understand why; the food & service was mediocre and yet our bill was a whopping $81 without the tip. Won't be going back anytime soon- too many other restaurants in the area with better food for less money, etc."
Andy P.,"Westerville, OH",65,22,,4.0,5/23/2010,"Probably one of my favorite chain restaurants. My only gripe with the restaurant is the waiting time. I love the decor and the way the interior is designed. It's like a warehouse version of the Cheesecake Factory without the slightly higher prices. My favorite item on the menu is the Grilled Chicken Club, but many of the items are priced reasonably and the portions are worth the price you pay. People there are very friendly and I have yet to have a bad experience there. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone. I have actually had 2 parties there."
Denise Y.,"Cleveland, OH",48,130,,3.0,3/3/2010,"Reminds me of a sporty Cheesecake Factory or Grand Lux Cafe. I can't vouch for the beer but the food was average but nothing was outstanding. The beginning and end to the meal were the best parts. Started with the combo appetizer platter which was a feature of fried foods. I had chicken lettuce wraps and other people split a deep dish pizza. The lettuce wraps were too soggy and salty and my bf said he's definitely has had better deep dish in Columbus. We got the pizookie trio at the end of the meal, definitely the highlight of the evening. Best for a big group outing but if you're going just for food, go somewhere else. There are plenty of restaurants out there that are better with similar, tastier food."
Kelly R.,"Columbus, OH",0,1,,1.0,7/5/2014,Service was ok but food was cold when it arrived. My sister's burger wasn't cooked to the temperature she asked for even after she sent it back. I asked for lettuce only but also got lots of tiny chopped onions which were time consuming to pick off. I also found a hair in the bottom of my pile of cold fries. Gross.
Kelli C.,"Delaware, OH",59,73,9,4.0,8/5/2011,"Great beer selection. Ive never actually had the pizza but i have had the wings. Big, juicy, crispy--really damn good!! I normally come here after a movie because there are giant TVs visible from wherever you sit and its a nice atmosphere.  Try the loaded stuffed potato, minestrone soup and the Brewhouse blonde or the piranha pale. Well done BJs!! Also---read their story located in the front of the menu...you'll feel good about spending your time and money in such an establishment!"
Ralph M.,"Pickerington, OH",0,4,,4.0,8/29/2012,"Had a great dinner, drinks & service. There was not one beer I didn't like from the eight glass sampler. Seared Ahi Tuna salad was excellent. The wasabi on the side of the salad plate was a perfect touch. Loved it. French dip sandwich was cooked and tasted great. Will be back but going to call ahead for a table."
Ken W.,"Columbus, OH",7,6,,3.0,8/27/2010,"I've been to the Brewhouse twice now.  The beers are good, the atmosphere is nice, but the food isn't anything to rave about. Apparently BJ's is a chain out of California.  It reminds me of a Yard House but not as polished.  It's a good place to go with a few friends but it doesn't have a lot of character."
Robert K.,"Columbus, OH",1,70,,5.0,9/1/2009,"I love this place!  The atmosphere is epic! Its dressy but casual.   Food is excellent and so is thier beer!  Great place to hang and enjoy good food, but also the perfect place for a date!"
Denise L.,"Pickerington, OH",11,146,19,4.0,7/7/2013,We arrived during a shift change and their computer was down so service was slow.  Food was great though enough that I would return if in the area.  I had the chicken club and my husband had the California club flatbread pizza.  I also had the pastry with the strawberries and he had the double chocolate pizookie.  Both were good but needed a lot more strawberries on mine.  We enjoyed the meal very much overall.
