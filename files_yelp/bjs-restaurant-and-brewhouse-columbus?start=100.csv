Nathan P.,"Delaware, OH",2,29,8,3.0,12/31/2014,"This is not our first time at BJ's. Typically we have a party of ~6 and they do a great job. This time, We ate there on a Tuesday night. The wait for a party of 8 was an hour. This was exacerbated by the rule that party's of more than 6 cannot call ahead. Then we get seated and the waitress was fine. Of course we were talking and a bit slow to order, but we did order drinks right away. The drink order to 10-15 min, it seemed like. It came after we ordered food and the beers were a bit warm. Really? Warm beer? Food came on time. It was good, but not piping hot as usual.  All this was basically ok, but a step down from BJ's normal service. Normally, I would rate them a 4-5 star experience, but today, I gave them a 3. They need to look at how they handle parties of 8. With a $50 tip on the line, possibly 2 servers could work the table??"
Marissa C.,"Columbus, OH",58,418,33,4.0,8/5/2011,"Frankly, I'm addicted to the pizza at BJ's!  This location is always hopping when we head over... even at our last visit, which was at 3 pm on a Sunday - it was packed.  Sadly, they were out of some of the drinks we wanted, but the service was good and the wait time between ordering and receiving food was quite reasonable. They have a large menu for food and drinks, which includes a number of gluten-free items.  My husband usually orders a brew and a burger off of the standard menu, while I go for a gluten-free pizza.  At BJ's, the gluten free crust is a 10"" thin crust that is loaded with herbs, which really add a nice flavor to the pizza.  I really love their crust.  Since all but one of their pizza ingredients is gluten free, the combos are endless.  And, not only do they carry Redbridge (gluten free beer), they also brew two ciders that are gluten-free!  Rumor has it that they are also adding a gluten free pizookie for dessert, so I am going to have to check that out and update then."
Zack S.,"Columbus, OH",65,43,57,2.0,7/20/2015,"I had my first experience at BJ's this past Sunday (7/19) and after being excited to try it, I unfortunately left rather unimpressed. My fiancee and I had plans to meet my sister and her husband as they were going to be traveling through the area.  They were set to meet us at the restaurant at around 6:30; my date and I got there at 6:00 after doing some shopping around Polaris.  We were seated rather quickly and put in our requests for drinks.  These came out pretty quick, and at this point it was probably around 6:05.  We didn't see our waiter again for at least 20 minutes, which was unfortunate was we wanted to put in an order for an appetizer.  The waiter finally came back around 6:30 and we placed an order for the calamari, along with ordering drinks for my sister and date as they were close.  The drinks came out quick, and the calamari shortly after they arrived. Sidenote: Calamari was awesome...hot and fresh, melt in your mouth tender. Again, it was about 20-25 minutes until the waiter came back to take our dinner orders. Eventually we ordered.  I should mention that the table behind us (group of 6) and the table on the other side of us (group of 4) were seated right before we placed our dinner orders, and both tables received their food at least ten minutes before we received ours.  Now, what about the food?   My sister ordered the seared ahi tuna salad, and it came out looking just like the menu photo.  She said it was delicious.  Her date ordered the Mediterranean chicken pitas and he said they were tasty as well.  My fiancee got the Jambalaya and she enjoyed it.  Probably worth mentioning that this was a huge portion size and she was happy to have the leftovers later in the evening.  I was trying to decide between the cherry chipotle salmon and the Hawaiian mahi mahi and ended up going with the mahi mahi.  I regretted this decision almost immediately.  While the veggies/rice that accompanied the fish were great (scarfed down with no regrets!), the fish itself was extremely bland.  There was no seasoning on it whatsoever, and definitely no glaze of any kind as the menu indicated.  It seemed to take forever after this to get our check, and we didn't end up getting out of there until a little after 8:00 PM. The waiter we had was extremely polite and courteous; I feel as though he may have simply forgot about us a few times.  I'm hoping this was just a fluke as I feel that this place had the potential to blow me away.  I'd like to try it again in the future; I just hope it's a slightly better experience."
Eric C.,"Mesquite, NV",3,78,152,3.0,5/4/2014,"Not truly impressed with the service, served our appetizer. Asked for dinner ware. Served our dinner, still no dinner ware. Let's try and set the table before seating a party of 3. 5/3/14"
Nathan K.,"Columbus, OH",8,39,1,4.0,11/5/2014,"My family and I always have a great time at BJ's.  Once you get over the name, this place is kind of wonderful. And yes, every time I come here with my family, my dad always says, ""You know how this place got the name BJ's...[insert typical dad humor here]"" Sheesh, dad. Every. Single. Time!  Anyway, this place has something for everyone. Some of my personal favorites are the chicken tacos, the bruschetta, and their pizzas. Plus, there are enough TVs to keep the sports fans entertained.  Great, upper-end sort of family restaurant."
Viangie G.,"Columbus, OH",77,16,82,5.0,10/13/2014,"We love their service, specials and beer! I still have never had a bad meal here. Their lunch specials are good prices and also their appetizers. My favorite meal is the parmesan crusted chicken, the pulled pork, and the tomato basil soup is the BOMB! My husband gets that every time. I wish we had a Bj's back at home."
Keith B.,"Powell, OH",332,516,72,4.0,6/11/2012,"I've been here for lunch and dinner, happy hour for a few beers, and the mixed occasions where you just get an appetizer. They do not fuck up. Some of the food - I'd pass on it - like the ""parmesan crusted chicken sandwich"" - it was a let down, but perhaps it's because it failed to live up to the plated order of parmesan crusted chicken (which is just...delicious, along with the balsamic chicken). For lunch, I recommend only coming in groups of 4 or less to get fast service. Anything larger seems to get you put in the ""hell of wait"" time. And be careful coming at post-lunch shift change - their staff wants to leave after their shift, but they stick around and take care of you. I always try to transfer to the bar at that time so my server can take a well-deserved break (I've been there, and even when they're exhausted, their staff is top-notch). The lunch specials are quite filling, as well, with the chicken teriyaki being a favorite. Simple and delicious. But why do you really come here? For the not-too-shabby craft beer. From the lights to the darks, they do make some tasty brews. From the low-calorie to the high-alcohol content to the dark and heavy stouts - they have a beer for everyone."
Amy P.,"Canal Winchester, OH",124,134,63,3.0,3/27/2014,"I've never been here when it is not busy.  That must speak to the awesomeness of the place, right?  Honestly, outside of the nice variety on the menu, I just find this place to be A-OK.  There isn't anything wrong, but there isn't anything amazing - - for me.  For my most recent visit, I had a reservation for 13 people made weeks in advance.  We got here, on a Saturday, and had to wait for 40 minutes to be sat because ""our table was still in use by the previous party, who had been there for 2 hours.""  I wasn't mad about it, stuff happens, but a free dessert or a discount could have sweetened the deal - literally. I shared a pizza with my fiance.  It was expensive, and not as good as the pizza I had the time prior to this visit.  The pizzokie was great - but $20+, really?!?!"
Wyman M.,"Columbus, OH",0,3,1,2.0,7/15/2016,"Brought my family for the first time and the food we received was very good, however we didn't get all of our food and no one checked on us until we were almost done. The waiter apologized and went to get it but we were finished with our meal and still hadn't received the missing items"
Shara D.,"Polaris, Columbus, OH",7,6,,5.0,11/27/2015,"Love his place!  I'm a rewards member and already have received roughly $30 in the last 6 months worth of coupons and from redeeming my points!  There is an app I can keep track of my rewards and the call ahead seating on the app was amazing!  I couldn't call out because of my kids in the car and to be able to ""call"" ahead on an app was extremely helpful! Especially when we noticed how busy it was when we showed up.  Not just that but all the food is delicious!  I have ordered so many variety of dishes there and it's been great - my fav is the fish tacos! Service has always been top notch too!  This is by far my favorite place to take business clients or girlfriends for a night out!  :) prices are right on point too!!  Love this place!!!!!!"
Sara G.,"Columbus, OH",7,47,22,5.0,9/18/2015,"I've loved EVERYTHING I've ever ordered from BJ's! It's a fun environment for a date or group outing. The Southern fried chicken is amazing, and the fish tacos are sooooo good! The only critique I had is that we've ordered curbside pickup a few times now, and the last time we picked our food up I could tell my fish taco had been sitting or for awhile."
Kyle D.,"Chicago, IL",251,557,1014,3.0,11/4/2012,"This being a chain, I won't be too critical of it. The food was good, but the service was lacking. Average prices and decent atmosphere, depending on what you are looking for. It has a Chili's vibe, but is fancier and has a lot of TVs. All of the food was good, and the portions are quite large. The prices range from 10-20 and there's a good sized menu. The waitress was very slow with our party and it took awhile to get our food. Service: 6/10 Atmosphere: 7/10 Food: 7/10"
Steve P.,"Johnstown, OH",99,188,39,5.0,4/12/2014,"Man, I love this place. Everything we've eaten on their menu is amazing. I don't care that it's a chain. It's my favorite place in Columbus, hands down. The pizza, the veggie burger, the beer, the pizookie!! This last time we ate there, we had our two small children with us. The environment is family-friendly and our waitress (I think her name was Stephanie?) was absolutely awesome. We always get treated really well there and everything tastes great. I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone."
Matt H.,"Columbus, OH",4,40,,5.0,10/11/2015,I love this place. I have ordered 6 different items off the menu and all exceeded my expectations. The beer they serve is very good too. This is the first place I take my friends from out of town to.
Toni D.,"Lewis Center, OH",1,19,2,2.0,8/28/2015,"I want to love this place. But every time I go, I just don't.  You definitely feel like you're eating in big box restaurant. There is no character in the ambience. The food is average. Nothing that really blows you away. The bar is huge, so if you're just drinking, it's a great place.  I have been there on many occasions and each time, busy or slow, the host or hostess seemed unaffected, unconcerned, and unimpressed.  If you're going for a meal and drinks, I would choose a different place if you would like a full experience."
Greg W.,"Columbus, OH",167,199,148,4.0,10/18/2012,"I've been to this BJ's location a number of times now, and the menu still continues to intimidate me! Maybe not so much intimidate as perplex. It's absolutely massive, on the order of what you would see at the Cheesecake Factory. While most places that have such extensive menus tend to be mediocre at everything, and have no standout specialties; BJ's manages to do everything very well. My most recent foray saw me with a pot roast open faced sandwich. The meet was very tender, the gravy was absolutely delicious, and the vegetables were fresh and crunchy. I would have liked to see a little bit more bread with this ""sandwich"",but still I found it to be very flavorful tasty. BJ's also has a huge selection of their own brews, and they even do seasonals as well. They had a pumpkin ale during our last visit, and being from Circleville the home of everything pumpkin, I found to be absolutely delicious."
Erin H.,"Akron, OH",0,3,,3.0,6/7/2016,"The food is good for your standard chain restaurant, but it's nothing to write home about. A bit overpriced in my opinion. We can never get out of there for less than $50 for lunch and that's with no alcohol!"
Ms. B.,"Columbus, OH",9,29,26,3.0,7/6/2015,"I visit BJ's fairly often because I am quite addicted to the pizookies - okay very addicted. But short of those, the beer and pizza, everything else I have ever had on their menu is decent. It's not bad food, but nothing to rave about. My most recent trip I ordered the flatbread pizza and large stuffed potato (garden veggie). I personally think it's overpriced for the quality (again, besides the beer and pizza). The atmosphere is okay and the service is decent. Not a place you would want to come and watch sports."
Kevin H.,"Indianapolis, IN",4,1,2,4.0,8/2/2015,Stopped here after a long drive from vacation.  Always tasty and consistent at a fair price.  Menu is vast so there's something for everyone.  Plus they brew they're own beer - bonus!
Mara T.,"Powell, OH",11,1,1,5.0,8/16/2014,A group of my Friends and I tonight had dinner there it was very good and we had great service. They said at first at 2 hour wait but it only took 20 mins! There pizokies are aboustly to die for I recommend the regular or peanut butter.
