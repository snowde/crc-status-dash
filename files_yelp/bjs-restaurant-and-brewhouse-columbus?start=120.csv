Nick L.,"Columbus, OH",0,2,,1.0,5/22/2016,"Microwaved food. They call themselves a brewhouse and yet they served their house stout (Tatonka) in a chilled glass, enough said. Cheese on burger was not melted and fries were soggy and cold. Waitress went through the motions and didn't seem to care or inquire as to why we barely touched our food. This place was packed on a Saturday afternoon with the run-of-the-mill blue collar families who come to gorge on massive portion sizes and contribute to the obesity epidemic."
Lisa D.,"Westerville, OH",9,28,1,3.0,2/29/2016,"Love this place because of the breadth of choice of different kinds of food. The service has always been good as well. Totally weird experience there this weekend...Sunday at 1130 AM..maybe 4 tables of people in the whole place. We order a new sandwich that is on a poster in front and on the tabletop pos. The server point blank tells us we cannot have it. I have ordered lunch items before outside of weekday lunch time-perfectly willing to pay extra...not looking for a deal ..just wanted to try the new sandwich because it looked good. Then the server tells us ""well you can have it if you want it but it will put our kitchen way behind if you do"".  Behind how..the restaurant was basically empty. The message we got is this waiter made us feel like we were totally putting him out. It was fitting with the rest of the service he provided...he had 2 tables..we had empty glasses...missing items..and he was just busy socializing with other staff. As we walked out...we passed 3 different tables with customers eating that very sandwich.....which is why I am writing this.    It goes to show that even if the food is good...you have to get treated in such a way that makes you want to come back."
Anna H.,"Westerville, OH",0,18,,5.0,5/1/2016,"Good deep dish pizza. My favorite (sweet pig) Hawaiian Pizza in Ohio. Do not like the cocktails, but the beer is on point. Love the pizookie. They have small ones. Salted caramel was amazing."
Kelsey S.,"Newark, OH",207,13,1,5.0,7/31/2015,"The food, the atmosphere, and the beer. Phenomenal! And don't get me started on the pizookies... they're so good they should be illegal."
Clint E.,"Columbus, OH",96,74,9,4.0,9/22/2013,"One of the best places to eat on Polaris, and always the busiest. The menu is huge, as is the bar area. It always has a clean presence, offers some creative beer choices, and the service is good 95% of the time.  Now you will spend the dollars here, so prepare yourself.  Favorite items: Santa Fe Salad with Cajun Shrimp or the Shrimp Tacos, or the shrimp lettuce cups. Just really solid on all three."
Lindsay C.,"San Diego, CA",82,55,13,1.0,9/6/2014,"Dirtyyyyyyy. Dirty booth I had to ask to be wiped; sticky menus with crushed food in it; feet slipping on nasty grimy floors under the booth, and finally, a hair in my salad.  Freaking get your crap together.   Never again."
Suelo R.,"Colorado Springs, CO",102,23,,1.0,11/18/2014,"I went to BJs to grab dinner (dessert) to go.. I got back to my hotel no utensils or napkins, I called to let them know and got hung up on.. The food was not disgusting but was just ehh... Mediocre and unprofessional staff"
Safiyyah A.,"Atlanta, GA",75,45,16,2.0,3/8/2015,My boyfriend and I went here for dinner last night. The hot wings were very good. He had the fried chicken meal. I tasted it and it was OK. It lacked seasoning to me. I had the chicken pita tacos and those were ok.  However my server was fun and cool.
Melanie R.,"Columbus, OH",23,12,1,3.0,4/25/2015,"Not good anymore. I have been to this location many times since they opened. We took a break & went back to fine the hamburger pizza was no longer on the menu, I wasn't real hungry so I had a wedge salad, not sure how that can be screwed up, but it was discussing. The soup was even worse."
Hannah M.,"Columbus, OH",137,71,117,4.0,2/6/2015,"My favorite place to get a deep dish buffalo chicken pizza. Ask for it well done & it will come out perfectly crispy every time. Service has always been great. The bartenders seem to be a lot more perky than the dining room servers, but are always efficient & friendly. Beer selection is awesome & their Nutty Brewnette is at the top of the list. The only bad thing I can really say about BJ's is their beignet dessert should be re-named. When I think of a beignet I dream of a light & fluffy pastry doughnut covered in a snow pile of powdered sugar. The texture of the beignet I received dense & more cake like consistency, only awfully chewy. It just wasn't good. Will stick to the pizookis from now on; that's what their best at."
Mike R.,"Curtice, OH",0,5,,2.0,11/17/2015,Hostess greeted us seated us and said goodbye when we left.Waitress was also extremely good. Flatbread was good. Margareta was not so good. To much lime not much tequila and way to expensive with no price on the menu. Menu had pages stuck together and stuff in the sleve.Glass in door and curved glass approaching dining area needed cleaning. Men's room had three of four soap dispenser empty and the sink that had soap had no water.
Chelsee W.,"Columbus, OH",48,6,,2.0,6/27/2015,"Great menu and large selection . Nice beer selection too. Service was very slow , our bill was duplicated charging us double for the entire check . We had to bring it to his attention . Waited over 1 hr for our food . Food quality and taste was just mediocre .  Not sure I will revisit"
Ashley W.,"San Juan, Puerto Rico",67,20,22,5.0,3/3/2015,"I highly recommend the ahi poke, my favorite.  The staff is friendly and accommodating.  If you sit at the bar Natalie and Katie will provide you with the best service in town.  Tuesday's  the wines half off too!"
Alexis P.,"Coraopolis, PA",1,20,40,3.0,3/2/2014,The first visit was great! We ordered 2 deep dish pizzas. The next visit we got 2 pizzas to go and it just wasn't the same as the first visit. The pizza was soggy. It was supposed to be deep dish but it didn't look anything like deep dish. :-( So disappointed with the take out order.
April S.,"Columbus, OH",19,7,16,1.0,10/19/2015,"Worst food experience I've ever had. Burger was over cooked like shoe leather and when brought to the general managers attention when questioned on how he handled the complaint he said""I would not have complained"" ! Absolutely ridiculous ...he needs to go back and receive some hospitality training. Over 20 years in the food service industry and I will never step foot in this location again. Totally distasteful ..."
Amanda D.,"Bexley, Columbus, OH",62,27,160,4.0,3/17/2015,"Had an enjoyable atmosphere, friendly wait staff, fresh hot entrées. And the desserts were amazing! The prices were also very fair for dinner dessert and two drinks average $20 or more."
Katye M.,"Dublin, OH",45,212,1604,4.0,5/3/2011,"We went on a Sunday evening around 7pm and sat at the bar. The restaurant seemed pretty busy and you could order off the full menu at the bar, so we sat there. There, obviously, was a wide selection of beers on tap and, of course, I had one... well, two. I tried the BJ's Jeremiah Red, which was great beer! In addition, if you didn't want to commit to a ""full"" beer, then you could try samples of them to see which one you liked. The menu was pretty big and had a great deal of variety, but neither of us were too hungry, so we went with the chicken fingers, which came with some honey mustard dipping sauce. They were really good! We ended up closing the restaurant/bar down, remember, it was a Sunday night, so they were only open until 11pm :). Overall, I enjoyed my time there. I would go back and would recommend it, especially if you live in or near the Polaris area!"
Joey G.,"Athens, GA",2,49,,2.0,10/7/2014,"Made annual trek to BJ's after a business meeting to take some clients there because it's near the event venue and some of them actually like it. As usual, the service was incredibly slow in orders being taken for drinks and food and their actual delivery. By the time food got to us, several of us had cold food and two of us had to remind the staff to deliver our orders. True to form, the food was average and not worth the wait. The staff was generally indifferent with a couple exceptions. We took the exact same size group to Bonefish Grill nearby and we were in and out in 90 minutes and everyone thoroughly enjoyed the entire experience."
Tiffany M.,"Columbus, OH",0,4,,4.0,4/6/2015,Always one of my go-to restaurants in the area. Their menu offers a wide variety of choices and their beer selection is fantastic! Very family friendly.
Shannon S.,"Quincy, MA",95,295,8,4.0,7/14/2013,"After a day of traveling, Boston to Columbus, we were hungry (and thirsty!) and BJ's came up in my search of nearby places with ""craft beer."" A quick visit to their website proved that they are in fact, a chain but that they also brew their own beers intrigued us all the same (and it was minutes from our hotel.) It was quiet (on the 4th of July) but we were told we had just missed the lunch rush which would have meant a 20 minute wait. We were quickly greeted by our server who recommended a seasonal brew and left us to check out the menu. We ordered a couple of BJ's beers - the brown for me and the IPA for him and were pleased when they arrived. Pretty decent beer - exceeded my expectations that's for sure. We ordered a pizza and the avocado egg rolls to share. The egg rolls were great - lots of FRESH avocado which got high marks in my book, the pizza was OK. Oddly enough, I really found that it tasted better when I ate the leftovers a few days later... for breakfast (we had a fridge in our hotel room.) I recommended this place to my family, because I felt like it was a good place to go for a bite and a brew on the parkway. I think if I were a local it would be worth a visit from time to time, for sure."
