Terri D.,"Rocky River, OH",11,67,,3.0,10/19/2015,"welcome to BJs! big, lots of room, great for a large party (we had 8 in ours), good service. just OK food.  the menu is HUGE! i love lots of choices. however, it was kind of a weird collaboration of food. seemed like a lot of 'thinner' options if you are dieting...... anyway, we ordered the parmesan crusted chicken, and a pulled pork sandwich. the cole slaw was dry. basically just cabbage.....the pulled pork was just meh. would not order again. the parmesan chicken....same. just meh. small amount of sauce on it (isn't the sauce the best part?) a few pieces of broccoli...... someone in our party ordered the pizza and they compared it to pizza hut (sorry pizza hut) but one would think it might have been a weeee bit better here?!  burgers were good. wedge fries.....what can i say? is it possible to mess those up?! our server was great~very attentive, quick and friendly.  i would not go back again. i just thought it was alright. prices. fair.  i think i expected the food to be better..........my belly was full but not content, if that makes sense! :)"
Liz M.,"Columbus, OH",554,605,208,2.0,11/15/2010,"Totally mediocre in every way possible. This was my second visit in 3 years if that tells you anything, but we took some friends here to celebrate a birthday since they like Cheesecake Factory, but wanted to try someplace new. Well, I thought BJ's would fit the bill, but really, Cheesecake Factory is a five star place comparatively speaking.  The table ordered:  Spinach Artichoke Dip: not bad, a notch above Applebee's  Fettuccine Alfredo- Pasta and Alfredo received at thumbs up, but the expensive add on chicken was dry and non edible.  Spaghetti with meat sauce AND meat balls- was OK, all parts were edible and meatballs were described as Good! Looked under sauced.  Grilled Chicken Club- contained same dried out chicken, good garlicky toasted bread, over all OK, but disappointing. Thin and crispy fries were rather limp to be described as Crispy, but had good flavor.  Deep Dish BBQ chicken pizza-most disappointing, barely hot when it arrived, more dried out chicken, barely any sauce.  Service:  Was OK. Friendly, but forgetful. Brought out a free Pizookie for the Birthday girl.  At the end of the day, although our guests were pleased, I was sad we'd spent our money here."
Shannon D.,"Medford, MA",94,159,76,3.0,6/22/2014,"Pretty good experience here last weekend. I had a bit of a hard time choosing from the countless beverages and menu items. I really enjoyed the lettuce wraps, and also tried a side of their amazing mac and cheese. I thought our service was adequate being that they were quite busy. I would not have a problem with going back in the future with a group of friends for some interesting brews and good food."
Jessica H.,"Columbus, OH",358,327,744,3.0,8/10/2010,"A decent place that should have worked out many of the kinks since opening.  I was part of an invited pre-open test run dinner.  Items were good, but the most important thing I learned --- and they sent the head chef out to speak directly with me --- is that things you would think would be vegetarian have ""hidden"" meats in them in the form of stock, fried in baconized pan for flavor, etc. Ask your server and follow your intuition as to if they are blowing you off or not."
Olivia W.,"Columbus, OH",0,2,,5.0,2/2/2016,"I got carry out food, and it was excellent as always. My boyfriend and I come to BJ's at Polaris frequently because we always receive excellent service along with great food. We love the atmosphere as well. Prior to getting carry out food at BJ's a couple days ago, I went to another restaurant to get carry out food and not only got rude service while I was waiting for my food, but got home and my order wasn't even right. I called the restaurant to speak with a manager and was on hold for 12 minutes. This kind of service is incredibly off-putting and rude. This is why I should've just ordered from BJ's to begin with. I ordered my food online, with the super easy to use BJ's app. I was greeted immediately upon walking up to the carry out window, and got excellent service as always! Lesson learned! Thank you all for always being so wonderful!!"
Craig W.,"Pasadena, MD",7,15,,4.0,9/13/2013,"Stopped here with my wife for lunch while traveling.  One of the lures was a nice gluten-free menu.  I ended up getting a gluten-free pizza.  Pizza was very flavorful and honestly has been one of the best GF pizzas I have had to date.  Usually GF crust is pretty bland.  BJ's crust has good flavor which ties in nicely with their sauce. My wife ended up getting a modified baked potato with chicken so it would be gluten-free so we could share it.  The modifications to make the baked potato gluten-free made the potato a bit bland and dry.  Chicken was seasoned well and was very tasty.  Nice beer selection (didn't take advantage of it this time around) but had a nice selection of GF beer options If you enjoy watching sports, they have plenty of large flat screens all over the place.  Easy to keep up on sports news or games..."
Meghann T.,"Reynoldsburg, OH",107,133,52,3.0,4/27/2012,"It's an all-american cuisine. Lots of menu choices, it took us about a half hour to decide what we wanted. We did a ""call ahead,"" so when we arrived, we were seated right away. Full bar and huge bar menu; that took me a good 20 minutes to browse. We has the mini bruschetta (about 5 pieces) for an appetizer, which was under $4. Server was polite, friendly, and knowledegeable of the menu. Floors are slippery; I about died walking to the restroom in my platforms.  Try their mojitos, and the non-alcoholic cream soda!"
Marc S.,"Delphos, OH",0,41,1,5.0,11/16/2014,We went with a group of ten at 4pm. Got a table within min. A nice big booth infact. Ordered 3 pizza's and aps. All cooked very well. Plenty of beer choices even with higher abv's. A great wait staff and an all around Very nice place. Good time for a special occasion.
Troy S.,"Hilliard, OH",87,730,522,4.0,7/13/2012,"I was pleasantly surprised with this place.  I went for lunch so I didn't take the time to have a beer especially since I had a baby in the car with me.  I was impressed with their beer selection as they have close to 8 choices from blonde to IPA to Stout to whatever your taste is.   The place is much bigger than i expected and for a Thursday noon, it was quite full.  This place draws the business lunch crowd probably because of decent lunch prices and a beer for the adventurous stressed out workers.  I ordered the light (under 575 calories) chicken tacos.  The tacos are in a corn tortilla shell and were quite tasty.  I had 4 tacos for $5.75 along with black beans, a little coleslaw, and salsa.  This was on par with taco truck prices.  It had a real nice flavor to the chicken and the black beans were great.  Their lunch menu had numerous offerings for around $6.  Their dinner prices are more around $10-15 especially for pasta and seafood items.   I ended the meal with a pazookie, which is a warm, deep dish cookie with ice cream on top.  The kids size is $2.75 which was a decent deal.  The only thing is I thought I ordered the regular pazookie but the waiter thought we wanted the kids size because  the two kids with us ordered first and I guess when the adults said we will also take a pazookie, he assumed.  I didn't know I could order the kid's portion.  The cookie was nice and warm with large chocolate chunk inside.  They even have a gluten-free pazookie.  My friend chose this place because of the gluten free menu.  The kids have a decent menu to choose from and their bowl of spaghetti, chicken finger, and sandwiches.  They also are known for the pizzas.   The menu is quite extensive so it takes some time to browse through it all.  The place is a franchise that is just growing in the Midwest.  I will probably try the place again and seeing it is kid friendly will only encourage my return."
Jaycee M.,"Columbus, OH",11,37,,4.0,2/17/2012,"Met for a dinner with 5 other work associates this week.  My first few times here were so uninspiring that I have not been back for several months, but a colleague suggested the location, so I found myself returning. It was a good experience, the food was wonderful and the customer service was some of the best I've encountered recently. From the hosting team, to the main servers, to the food runners; everyone was appropriately attentive and friendly. Our group had quite a few special requests as well, not only from the bar but a few in our team were attempting to rewrite the menu, all the while the wait staff was patient, smiling, and warm. THIS is the customer service I expect and returned my appreciation with a fat tip. The food quality knocks one star off my review, as my expectation of salmon is not to be over cooked and my hope for micro brew is to enjoy it in a clean glass.  Overall, way better than my first few experiences so thanks to a work dinner and impressive customer care, I'm ready to return."
Keith B.,"Mogadore, OH",19,12,9,1.0,12/12/2015,"Called ahead tonight and got stuck in traffic. I called back to inform them we would be a little late. Was told it was fine. Upon arrival the hostess had no idea we had called back. We were seated promptly however. Ordered drinks and appetizer which we got. Ordered our entrees which included salads and waited for over an hour and received nothing further. The manager came over and asked if everything was ok we informed him we had been waiting for over and hour. He went to investigate and found the ""kitchen had lost our ticket"" even though the waitress had a walked passed our table at least ten times to serve other people while we waited. The manager brought our food and it was good but after waiting so long it really didn't matter. We then were the ""focus table"" as different managers came to check on us however we still had to wait for drink refills etc and the waitress seemed to be afraid to come back to our table. although we never verbalized our displeasure to her. We were offered a free dessert but had to wait on that as well so it was little compensation for our experience. I have been a chef for over 20 years and I can forgive a lot in a restaurant because I know the business. However when you are passed by countless times by people who know you should have been served that is kind of inexcusable. I have seen these restaurants pop up a lot in different areas lately and I will not be back to any of them after tonight."
Lauren B.,"Westerville, OH",9,10,,4.0,4/14/2014,"Delicious food and great lunch specials. They have very long waits on weekends, which stinks, but other than that I have had great experiences here."
Doug W.,"Akron, OH",18,96,10,4.0,10/14/2012,"I like BJ's mainly for it's comfort and ambience. It is a big place with pleasant decor, but nothing formal. The menu is large with some relatively unique items and something for everyone. In my trips here, I've had flatbread pizza (pretty good), a burger slathered with onions (really good), and some seafood (pretty good). Service had been great and they have some pretty good craft beers."
Fidel Z.,"Columbus, OH",0,11,,5.0,7/2/2013,Great food good selection. Great service. Only once they have got my order wrong.  And when they did the manger himself came out to apologize and didn't charge me for the meal.  That kind of integrity is hard to find anymore.
Terry H.,"Mooresville, NC",17,23,3,5.0,2/17/2012,"I wish I had gone there for dinner instead of lunch because of all of the beer offerings, but alas I was not...I was there for lunch. I had the chicken tortilla soup for my appetizer. The way they served the soup was unique...the avocado, onion, and tortilla strips were brought out in the serving bowl and the soup itself was brought out in a little metal carafe. The server poured the chicken soup in the bow at the table. The soup was very good and would certainly warm you up on a cold day!  The soup was so good that I can't remember what I ordered for my entree...it was a burger....but uninspiring!  The next time I am in Columbus I will definitely go back after work so I can sample the beer selection."
Gyasi A.,"Manhattan, NY",14,11,2,5.0,1/5/2013,Great veggie burger!  You HAVE to get a pazookie! Absolutly amazing
Melissa P.,"Canal Winchester, OH",0,2,,4.0,9/18/2014,"My Husband and I went there for the first time on a busy evening. We were seated in less than a minute.  Our waiter was friendly, speedy and always refilled our drinks.  Our food was wonderful.  We could not think of a negative thing to say about the place. Why didn't we try it sooner?  We highly recommend this restaurant. Melissa P."
Marla H.,"Miamisburg, OH",1,19,3,4.0,9/24/2011,"After trying out a bunch of places (that ended up sucking) on a trip to Cleveland, I needed a home run on the way back and I remembered really liking the B J's in Cincinnati. My husband loves the pizza so we stopped at the Polaris exit on our way home to Dayton. I ordered the root beer which was really good (and not full of chemicals their menu promises), we split 2 orders of the Chicken Mini Tacos and I wished we had ordered more (seriously these were crave worthy), because I was in great need of comfort food I ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo with blackened chicken- it was good enough to satisfy my carb needs, but nothing special, and my husband got the Chicken Pesto flat bread which he thoroughly enjoyed.  Was it the best food ever? No. Will I come back when I need something that I know will be good? Yes!"
Kristen N.,"Dublin, OH",87,70,,3.0,8/13/2011,"If you looking for a little light summer reading I recommend the BJ's menu.  It's massive.  Anyone can find 'something' on the menu that sounds good therefore I'd recommend for large groups or groups where it's hard to reach an agreement on where to go or what type of food is desired.  I've been to BJ's a few times and I do enjoy the locally made beer (Specifically the summer seasonal Nit Wit and the Jeremiah Red). I have yet to be impressed with the food.  Iv'e had the baked potato entree (not nearly as good as Jason's Deli), Jambalaya (meh) and the chicken tender salad.  I was truly disappointed by the salad.  The chicken tenders were overcooked (aka fried to a crisp) had little flavor and were dry.  The salad was also super bland with nothing but tomato, corn (very little) and lettuce.  There wasn't even any cheese. Blasphemy.   Iv'e heard the pizza is good and the desserts but I have yet to try either item.  Overall it's one of the more fun chain restaurants to go to especially because of the beer but I'd rather see the menu scaled down and a little more thought put into the quality.  On the upside I have always had good service.  BJ's is just OK in my book."
