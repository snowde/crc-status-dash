Amanda H.,"Westerville, OH",70,20,,5.0,9/11/2011,"BJ's is our go-to restaurant!  I love their beer- my favorite is the hefeweizen or nutty brewnette. In addition to their BJ's Brews, they have one of the best bottled beer selections and cocktail menus around.  The meditteranean pizza is THE BEST and like no other pizza I have had anywhere. My husband loves the pot roast and always claims it is the most tender and flavorful pot roast around. Their menu has lots of choices and they do change it up with some new selections every few months.  Last but not least, we rarely leave without trying a pizookie. We are stuck on the cookies and cream flavor. Yum!! The one thing that would make BJ's a little better is more seating. They are always very crowded but their is good, prompt service so at least I know the wait is due to popularity and not poor service!"
Tina G.,"Cincinnati, OH",67,157,46,5.0,5/29/2012,"Not a true soda queen anymore but since they offered unlimited refills of their handcrafted root beer, cream soda, orange and black cherry sodas, we tried all four of them!  So refreshingly clean-tasting.  Aside from that the food is good.  Avocado rolls.  Lemon Chicken P I haven't tasted the beer yet. ...... More later!"
Sabrina L.,"Columbus, OH",68,289,24,4.0,5/5/2011,"I really wasn't sure what to expect from BJ's, but for what it is, I'm a fan.   The menu is huge, with page after page of choices, and it's very similar to the Cheesecake Factory menu.  So similar that I actually looked up whether or not they were run by the same company.  (It didn't look like it.) It was a cold, rainy day and my husband and I were in the mood for bar type food, so we ordered the mozzarella sticks, the potato skins, and a flatbread pizza. The mozarella sticks were pretty average, exactly what you'd expect from any decent chain.  The potato skins were above average, and served with both ranch and sour cream which I liked.  They were very crispy and had a good amount of cheese and bacon which was exactly what I was craving.  The flatbread pizza was good too, though the sauce was a little sweeter than I expected.  If I could do it over again I'd have gotten one of the deep dish pizzas instead since they looked amazing at the tables around us. Our server was friendly and efficient, our drinks never got below the half-way mark, and our check came out within a minute of us asking for it.  You really can't ask for much more than that in the way of service. This isn't gourmet food, but if you want to watch a game, drink a beer and eat something that's several steps above Applebees, this is your place."
Christine J.,"Collierville, TN",2,36,15,5.0,7/6/2011,"My husband travels to Columbus on business and found this gem.  I thought he might be dragging me there just so that he could have a top choice of beer, and that maybe the food would be on the slack side.   I was pleasantly surprised!  We had two things off of the tapas/small menu- the tomato and mozzarella salad with balsamic vinagarette and the spinach stuffed mushrooms.  Both were EXCELLENT!  We shared the chicken lettuce wrap appetizer and it was better than any I've had- even PF Changs or PeiWei.   We are only in town for a week but we have already decided that we'll be back again."
Jenny D.,"Columbus, OH",3,19,,5.0,8/30/2011,"My husband and I love this place. The service has always been good and timely. There is always a wait for a table but that's not their fault it's so busy 90% of the time you go. They turn over their tables quickly from what I have noticed. We get their carry-out to go often if we don't feel like going and having to wait. Usually our food is ready to pick up 20 minutes after we call.  Anytime we go out with a group of friends we suggest this place because the menu is huge! Note: if you like 'quiet' places, this isn't it. You don't have to shout to talk to each other but you certainly can't whisper.  They only do call ahead seating."
Adam S.,"Dana Point, CA",1,7,,5.0,4/26/2015,"This is one of the best BJs I've ever been to! Staff was friendly, prompt, and the food was amazing! I got the jalapeno something burger. It was so good I forgot I ordered and just remember the amazing taste!"
Tee P.,"San Antonio, TX",92,182,325,4.0,11/4/2013,pretty good selection of food...good for quick lunches or casual dinner with friends. they also have separate room for parties if you have 10 or more people. good service and great food. I would recommend this place!
Jessica W.,"Macomb, MI",30,6,,4.0,3/18/2014,"The Mediterranean Salmon is quite delicious; spicy, flavorful and on the ""light"" menu. Highly recommended if your taste buds are spicy-loving.  Very friendly staff! Service was wonderful!"
Raja K.,"Annapolis, MD",0,43,7,1.0,8/6/2011,Beer selection is okay.  The pale ale is not as robust as other brands.  Server was inattentive and hurried.  Food sounded good on the menu but tasted worse than Applebees.  Don't order anything but bar food if you do end up here.  BJ's has small portions and sub-par ingredients.  The smallest shrimp I've ever seen!!   I couldn't believe we waited 40 mins to get a table and it was so busy for crap food.  There are better options in the area.  BJs pizza tastes like reheated pizza hut za or something from the frozen selection at a grocery store.  Menu selection is a confusing mix of Asian choices blended in with American bar food.
hollie w.,"Columbus, OH",14,20,20,5.0,2/22/2015,"Have to give the management, specifically Dave, a shoutout! I work in a busy salon across the street from the restaurant and don't have a lot of time to dine on a quick break, but this weekend I was craving deep dish pizza! (which theirs is the BEST!) I called the restaurant and told the hostess we wanted to place a pre-order and then come to the restaurant and dine quickly. She passed me along to Dave who instructed me to call him back when we were leaving the salon and he would get our orders in and started so we would have a jump start on our lunch! I called him back and gave our orders and he said that he would make sure it was taken care of! When we arrived at the restaurant we got right in, and our table was set up with drinks and plates and our appetizer came right out. It was absolutely perfect!! I have been a patron of BJ's since its been in the Polaris mall, but this service was above anything I've experienced before! Dave is definitely detail-oriented and customer focused! He is a great example of true customer service and I will definitely be back to see him again!"
Leslie G.,"New Albany, OH",1,9,,5.0,2/18/2015,I had carryout. The person bringing me our food to the car was SO friendly despite it being SO cold outside.
Jim V.,"Nashville, TN",130,115,95,5.0,1/28/2013,"I have been going here since its been open and have never had a bad experience. From the food to service to catching the big game this is the place to come. Want a bar atmosphere or dining experience? Both can we found at BJ's. This restaurant is pretty big. However, you should call ahead during the dining rush or weekends. They brew their own beer on site and offer a diverse and satisfying dining experience."
Karen F.,"Akron, OH",69,9,,5.0,4/28/2015,this is one of our favorite places to stop when passing through Columbus!  it has great food and delicious pizookis....hot chocolate chip cookies with ice cream!  Also love their apps and small plates!
Judy C.,"Los Angeles, CA",116,107,66,4.0,8/30/2011,"Please do yourself a favor and get a cookies 'n cream pizookie for dessert. It's a big, soft-baked, fresh out of the oven Oreo cookie with vanilla ice cream on top. Warm cookie + cold ice cream = so simple but heavenly. Pizza and appetizers are good as well but my heart belongs to that pizookie!"
barb s.,"Columbus, OH",65,60,131,2.0,12/4/2010,"This is a man-place. The name alone would attract the male of the species, I mean seriously: BJ's? Lol!  Sports n beer n perky brunettes wearing Uggs with orange spray tan n a miniskirt in the middle of winter, ugh. Beer is the saving grace. I do adore beer, but I hate sports, ugh again. The food is mediocre. Just another sports bar for people who got the taste all slapped outta their mouths. Boring n bland."
LeeAnn N.,"Akron, OH",155,254,28,5.0,8/1/2011,I previously gave this place 4 but it can have 5 now.  Went around 9:45 on a Saturday night with family and got seated right away in a comfortable booth. Waitstaff was quick and attentive.  I did the 4 taster of the dark and my fiance did the 8 taster. There beer is just so dang good here. I especially enjoy the stout and usually get a pint of it.  Food was amazing that night and we were all cleaning our plates. Will be back!
Ed A.,"Lewis Center, OH",47,5,,2.0,11/3/2012,"We had a party of 10 with a reservation.  We were seated quickly (on time).  Then nearly 30 minutes before server took our drink order, at which time we also ordered our food.  That took another 45 minutes.  A couple of people commented about their food being very bland.  We had taken out of town visitors here for a casual lunch before the OSU game.  Service was terrible, food bland and ordinary.  We did have a pleasant experience there a couple of months ago ... but after today, and with the huge number of better options in the Polaris area, we will not be back."
LJ W.,"Columbus, OH",73,117,97,5.0,6/27/2013,Great place. This place is huge and beautiful on the inside. A little expensive but well worth it. I recommend their deep dish Chicken Bacon Ranch pizza. Pizza 1-5=5.
Mike D.,"Columbus, OH",125,217,147,4.0,5/22/2009,"The service is sometimes a little lacking, as it seems they ask their servers to take on a lot.  The place is nearly always packed during peak hours and you can and will wait for a table, sometimes significantly so, even after calling ahead! The food is delicious -- their potato skins are far superior to just about any potato skin you have ever had. They have some good beers on tap.  The Tatonka Stout does NOT mess around, so be serious.  Their Nutty Brewnette is dangerous in the fact that it is very tasty and very smooth. For kids or if you're not feeling the alcohol, they brew a Root Beer that is also quite delicious.  A little sweet. I have never tried their ""world-famous pizookie"" as I'm typically quite stuffed from dinner. This is a great place for takeout -- avoid the long waits."
Basil S.,"Philadelphia, PA",28,8,6,5.0,8/26/2013,Extremely impressed. Service speed was exceptional. The beer selection and taste was spot on and fantastic. The food was also very tasty and the price was great. Take a competitor such as TGI Friday and double your overall rating with great drink selections at the same price and you've got BJ's Brewhouse.
