Ben T.,"Pickerington, OH",9,175,117,5.0,2/5/2011,Everyone loves a good bj and this one is no disappointment.  A unique delicious pizza crust coupled with their self made microbrews makes for a good day.
Paul F.,"Columbus, OH",175,927,2263,4.0,5/24/2011,"I don't think I've ever been in a place this large or this empty.  It's a BIG restaurant with forty foot ceilings and a ton of booths but at 4:30 on Tuesday there were only a half dozen at the bar and four in the booths.  Geez, I felt lonesome!  With that sort of a crowd, parking was a breeze but I don't know what it's like when(if) they really get busy. Their web site was very useful except there are no prices on it  But it was enough to give me an idea of what they serve and what I wanted. I chose the roast beef a jus which came on just an average roll but it had a good serving of beef, onions, and cheese.  And a nice bowl of a jus.  Along with that I got the quarter-sliced fries which were very good.  Their menu is large enough and varied enough that anyone should find something that they like."
Crystal O.,"Columbus, OH",65,54,57,5.0,6/18/2010,"B.J.'s is a no-brainer. The diverse menu can suit any crowd, from parents visiting to girlfriends for a happy hour full of deelish B.J.'s beer. (My favs are the hefe or ""nutty brewnette."" You can get handles to-go for under $15 from the bar -- just walk into the takeout area and they'll tell the bartender what you need.) Lunch deals are really affordable - you can get a small, quality pizza, salad and a drink for about $10. Husband and I always get the Mediterranean pizza - full of snappy peperoncinis and smattered with feta cheese. Their chopped salads are also generous and pastas are good. Huge portions. The only compliant (and it's definitely an ongoing issue) is weekend crowds at the Polaris location. You will have to wait upwards of an hour nearly any weekend night -- sometimes as long as two hrs. The bar can't suit that many people waiting, and they need more outdoor seating space to make the wait bearable. We only hit it up for takeout those nights, and call ahead."
Mike H.,"Flower Mound, TX",2,29,2,1.0,9/11/2012,"The front door greeters were very polite, attentive and eager to seat my family.  However, the moment I asked for a table instead of a booth mass confusion occurred. Now the manager comes over to see what is going on - he is coincidently looking out at his half empty restaurant with several available tables. The manager further confused the issue by walking out to the empty tables to survey the situation.  By this time my family and I decide to walk out and go to Marcella's across the street.  A key piece to effective restaurant operation is to promptly seat your patrons. BJ's blunt instrument of a manager doesn't get it!"
Mindy W.,"Columbus, OH",36,144,,4.0,4/18/2011,"I would say this would probably be a 3.5 (I'm really drawn to the nonexistent half star), but I'm nice enough to round up. They have a really good mimosa that is reasonably priced. You get your own mini bottle of Mumm Napa (one of my faves) and a carafe of OJ. Your glass and the carafe are brimmed in sugar, and I recall that the cost was under $10, which was good for what is essentially 1.5 mimosas. I really want to go back and try some of their beers! I tried the flat bread chicken and pesto pizza last time, which was really light and pretty tasty. I also had a pizzookie, which is so delicious, it is probably worth coming here just for dessert. Giant warm cookie covered in melty ice cream? Count me in.  I tried the calamari yesterday, and it was really good calamari. I have only had one bad calamari dish in my life, but this was equally as good as most other places where I've tried the tentacled treat. We also split the avocado rolls. everyone loved them, but they were a bit too spicy for my tastes (I'm a spice wimp).  I got the Blonde shrimp (they might be a seasonal Lent item). I think they were butterflied, but they were a really good size and they were really plump. The batter was so crispy, maybe too crispy for some, but really spot on for my tastes. It was really flavorful but didn't overpower. The cocktail sauce is pretty mild, which I would prefer. It also comes with this aioli type lemon-mayo sauce that is pretty good as far as cream sauces go (I can live without them). It came with a side of fries, I chose the thin crispy fries, which were simple, crispy, thin fries that were really good as far as fries go.  It's a bit overwhelming to see a Cheesecake Factory-esque menu, but there is a little something for everyone on the menu. My brother loves the cheeseburger pizza, my dad's fried fish was really good, and my mom's Margherita flat bread was also simple and good.  If you come here, do not pass on the pizzookie. I would also suggest the calamari! It would be a good place to come with a group and share apps and pizzookies. p.s. they don't do reservations, but they do offer call-ahead seating!"
Dominic K.,"Columbus, OH",0,2,,5.0,1/19/2015,"Mattea G. - Was absolutely the BEST bartender/server I've had since coming to the Polaris BJ's the past 2 years!!  Great personality, great sense of care, a definite asset to this location!"
David L.,"Marion, OH",22,19,6,5.0,10/26/2013,"First time here. Good selection on the menu. A little pricey but worth it. Had the ribeye, horseradish mashed potatoes and tomato bisque. Enjoyed it all."
Bill L.,"Potomac, MD",0,6,,1.0,3/1/2014,"Very slow (and confirmed with other people that this is typical) and poor service.  Beer was good, but food, overall, was not.  Big menu of mediocre food.  Think Cheesecake Factory but bad.  None of the 4 of us would go back, except for happy hour, and I confirmed this opinion with other people from work."
Rachel S.,"Columbus, OH",2,80,1,5.0,9/27/2012,"This is one of the best chain restaurants in Columbus.  Fair prices, good food, good atmosphere, and plenty of televisions.   Service has always been good, and they offer to-go service as well.  Skip the places like Applebees and come here instead."
Id T.,"Westerville, OH",2,3,3,4.0,10/12/2011,"Great place to eat with an excellent selection of fresh brewed beers and guest taps.  My menu favorites are the beef sliders, Santa Fe spring rolls, spinach and artichoke dip, and the Favorite pizza. The beer (although not locally brewed) is great. I recently had the Big Fish IPA and it was a great hop bomb that smoothed nicely in the finish. The Porter, Tatonka Stout, and Grand Cru are my favorites. Be careful with the porter though, it's on a nitro tap which has a different mouth-feel than what you may be used to. Still very good, it just surprised me a little.  One of the biggest ""ticks"" against them is that some (not all) of the staff don't have the best knowledge about beer. My feeling is that if you work in a beer bar know your beer. Seriously. Other than that I recommend it."
Michael L.,"Columbus, OH",0,10,8,5.0,9/28/2010,"If you can't find something that you want to eat at BJ's, you must not be hungry. Extensive menu that's predictable & well-prepared with generous portions and reasonable prices. We haven't come across a single dish that we wouldn't order again. You can even make a meal for 2 by ordering 3 of their generously-sized appetizers and splitting it. Their house beers are okay. They're not as good as Barley's craft beers, but better than run-of-the-mill drafts like Sam Adams or Killians. Only one warning: there are no drink prices on their mixed drink menu, and there's a reason for that: They're super-expensive. ($8-9 per drink range) If you are looking for a place to go with a bunch of people where everyone can find whatever food they happen to be in the mood for, BJ's is your place."
Nancy H.,"Johnstown, OH",15,10,,1.0,7/23/2012,"I am not impressed. This was not our first visit to this establishment.  Each time has been worse than the one before,  This was our LAST visit though. 1.  Called ahead for  seating- put our name on the list.  Was not on the list when we got there.  Said wait would be 30-40 minutes.  Supposedly put us on the call ahead list when we got there.  Took MANY others that came in after us that did not call ahead. 2. Server was more than inattentive.  Did not clear dishes.  6 of us at a smaller table.  Was there for a birthday celebration so there was a cake in the middle of the table. 3. Asked for extra ice for my warm iced tea.  Took FOREVER to get it. Then, she poured more warm tea on top and melted what little ice I had left. 4.  Several in the party asked for special consideration about their meals.  NONE were honored.  Had to ask several times for the requests to be honored.  These also took FOREVER to get honored. 5.  Asked multiple times for plates to serve the cake. Asked to speak to manager.  He listened to all our problems.  He did not offer ANY discount for the horrible service or the treatment by the hostess.  His solution seemed to be to offer us water refills.  Never said he was sorry either. We got there at 6:15 p.m.  Did not leave until well after 8. We left as soon as we were finished with our cake."
Erin Y.,"Urbana, IL",23,96,,3.0,2/6/2010,"The atmosphere at BJ's is middle of the road.  It's neither too casual nor fancy.  You could dress up, but why? Go for the brewpub aspect- their beers are tasty.  I especially enjoyed the hoppy Piranha pale ale.  The winter seasonal was kinda sweet and malt flavored. As noted previously, there is something for everyone one the menu.  Food quality was average to good.  Everything seemed a bit overly salted. Our table of four spent about 25 each for food and a drink, so fairly reasonable prices.  There is a bit of a man-cave feel to the place, sports on many TV monitors.  Heard from the locals I'm visiting that it gets mad busy on weekend and during major sporting events."
Michael K.,"Dublin, OH",23,8,,2.0,1/29/2012,"My wife and 4 friends decided to go to BJs Restaurant and Brewhouse to catch up on  our lives over a meal.  We know that getting in on a Saturday night is usually a tough thing given the popularity of the restaurant.  We took advantage of the call ahead seating.  I called at 6:00 pm for seating at 6:30 and was told by the host that the wait was 1 and 1/2 hours.  When we arrived, there about 70 people in the waiting area and spilling into the bar area.  When we checked in, they told us that the wait would be 45 minutes (which is not bad).  We spent the time in the bar chatting with our friends and having a drink.  The wait was more like an hour and 15 minutes and we had started to talk about going somewhere else.  Finally, we were seated. [Note #1: avoid Saturday night and the long wait.  There's got to be a better way to handling the crowd and getting people to table quicker.  While time wasn't a problem for us, had we had other things going on that night, we would not have been able to make it] BJs has a great selection of beers brewed on site and my favorite is the India Pale Ale.  Nice and hoppy, with a good finish. Tableside service was very good. Our waitress checked on us frequently but was unobtrusive.  And despite the huge crowd, the meals came quickly.  For my meal, I had the half rack of ribs with baked potato and salad.  The salads were good sized portions with lots of extras in them: carrots, croutons, and a mix of lettuces.  I didn't ask for the dressing to be on the side so it was already on the salad when served.  I could have used a little more dressing, but that wasn't a problem. My main course, though, was disappointing.  The ribs were very dry and really didn't have much flavor.  They were coated with a barbecue sauce that was ok.  The meat did come right off the bone, so they were done properly.  I think that they had been made well ahead of service and were sitting somewhere and got dry.  They did have a nice char on the outside of the sauce, so they were fired before being sent to the table.  The baked potato was very large, but was also dry inside.  I eat lots of these things and I'm not sure how you get it so dry in the middle.  I had to ask for more sour cream just to soften it up. This was the second meal that I had a BJs that I thought was underwhelming. I asked my friends how their meals were and they said that they liked the food, so it must just be me. The bottom line for me is that there are some really good restaurants in Columbus, and, for now, I plan to go to one of them instead of BJs."
C C.,"Rochester, MN",1,50,9,4.0,8/22/2011,"I'm pretty excited to have found this place! I picked up a friend from a hotel off Polaris Parkway and was just looking for the closest restaurant/bar we could find. It turned out to be a lucky find! The menu is extensive, both in terms of food and drink. I was really disappointed to not be able to try any of the beers or mixed drinks. Must come here again when I'm not DD.  I got the mini tacos and as the waitress warned, they are mini. Each taco was only about 4 inches in diameter. They were delicious, though, well-seasoned and served with a spicy cabbage and carrot slaw. My friend ordered the grilled burger melt and by the end, he said he was full but had to keep eating because it was so good. The thick steak fries that came with the burger were well-seasoned as well. My friend did order his burger medium-rare and complained that it was medium-well. Another friend ordered a giant stuffed potato. She, too, ""complained"" that she was too full to eat as much as she wanted.  Service was a bit slow. We waited about 5 min for our drink orders to be taken and about 10-15 after that for the server to take our food orders. My water glass sat empty for a bit as well. The food was excellent, though, and I'll definitely be returning with an emptier stomach and a DD of my own."
Jim M.,"Westwood, NJ",2,14,,3.0,9/12/2014,"Went in there for a steak & martini.  Sides were great (horseradish potatoes & brussel sprouts), but the steak was average.  Maybe next time order the pork chops, the guys to the right of me looked much better!"
Shawn K.,"Strongsville, OH",8,27,60,5.0,4/4/2012,"Whenever we are passing through Columbus, we always make our pit-stop at BJ's Brew-house in Polaris...it is one of our favorites.  The food is creative, eclectic, and most importantly delicious. We always notice how the menu changes over time (that's a good thing, they are creating, updating, and adding seasonal dishes that are welcome and interesting, an ongoing reflection of a proactive kitchen).    I have been there many times for both lunch and dinner and have never been disappointed with anything that I chose.  My first experience was their pizza. And being a HUGE fan of pizza, I take it seriously when a location has pizza on the menu....It HAS to be good or shouldn't even be offered at all. BJ's scores high marks here. I love their pizzas and they also have flat-bread styles available.   The appetizers are plentiful and very tasty, it's hard to get past them to enjoy the main dishes, they are just so interesting. Salads are generous and satisfying. The entrées, whether lunch or dinner, are amazing and festive, with a good presentation.    Often, the group I am with all chooses differently, then we share. Everyone comments how good the other choices are and noone is disappointed in any way.  The bar options are extensive, and the micro-brewed beers score an A+ for selection and originality.  Also, BJ's is one of the nicest looking casual eateries that you can visit. A true modern American pub.   I'll definitely be visiting over and over again to enjoy their latest creations."
Jay D.,"Columbus, OH",10,53,17,4.0,10/13/2009,"BJ's is one of my ""go to restaurants;"" here's why: The Place: The BJ's at polaris is a HUGE place. There's a large bar along the right side of the space, a few rows of booths in the middle of the space, then tables and some more booths on the left side of the space. It's a very cool environment - they've got the whole exposed ceiling thing going on, as well as nice hardwood floors and brick walls (I suppose giving the ""brewhouse"" feeling?) The light is a bit low, but there are lots of windows. There are HDTVs here and there firmly dedicated to ESPN and live sports broadcasts. Overall it's a nice environment, but not some place you would dress up to go to.  The Service: Every time I've been to BJ's I've been seated pretty quickly, even during the dinner rush. My servers have been hit or miss, but MOSTLY ""hit."" No real complaints here (save one server who seemed to be in a bad mood and in a rush to get away from our table).  The Food: The menu is HUGE. I've had a meat loaf dish and some burgers. People I've been with have had all sorts of sandwiches, salads, soups, pizza and potatoes. (Note: the potatoes are one of BJ's unique specialties - they are HUGE baked potatoes stuffed with things such as chicken, chili and veggies). This is a great place to bring a group because of the large menu - there's someone for everyone, and everyone I've been here with has been very pleased with their meal. It's good, quality food.  The Drinks: this is where BJ's really shines in my mind. They've got seven BJ's beers on tap, as well as others that rotate in and out seasonally. The beers always on tap are: BJ's Brewhouse Blonde (malty and very light), Harvest Hefeweizen (typical wheat - spicy/fruity), Piranha Pale Ale (very HOPPY), BJ's Jeremiah Red (typical Irish red - smooth taste with great malty/fruity taste), BJ's P.M. Porter (dark, chocolatety ale in the Guinness vein), Tatonka Stout (imperial stout - dark as midnight), Nutty Brewnette (brown, nutty ale). I've had them all either in sampler form (either four 6 oz. glasses or six 4 oz. glasses) or as full pints. My favorites are the Jeremiah Red and the Piranha Pale Ale - which are both delicious - but I've enjoyed them all.  The Price: Middle of the road. BJ's is more expensive then the Applebees, Ruby Tuesdays and T.G.I. Friday's of the world, but it's also a much nicer place. I can't remember the exact prices of many of the dishes, but I'd estimate an average of $11-20 for a meal for one and a drink or two.  The Bottom Line: Everything about BJ's is solid. The building is nice, the staff is good, the food is varied, high quality and well-prepared, the beer is AWESOME ... in short, what's there to complain about? I knocked off one star because I favor non-chain restaurants. You don't get the neighborhood feel or service like you get at a lot of neighborhood joints, but for what it is, it does very well."
Heather A.,"Columbus, OH",64,340,138,4.0,8/24/2008,"Alright- even though I have an aversion to people and places with initials for names (I've never met a nice guy with initials for a name...) I decided to give Bj's a go.  I'm glad I did!!!   Loved the food, the atmosphere and the service was great.  I had heard many people talk about this place and say it was great  so I finally gave in a tried it.  It didn't force me over budget either as prices were super reasonable.  Good pizza but still no Cottage Inn. :)"
Zack O.,"Columbus, OH",4,44,9,4.0,8/25/2012,This place gets 4 stars on the Zack scale. One for delicious food. One for excellent service. Another one because the service was that good. And one for having a really nice atmosphere. It loses a star for being a tad overpriced.
