Brad S.,"Columbus, OH",128,256,18,2.0,5/23/2009,"In short, everything at BJ's seems subdued.  My wife and I had the shrimp pasta, the BJs burger, and the Piranha pale ale.  The beer's flavor was better than Bud Light, but not the full-flavored hops that would expect form a pale ale.  The burger was not nearly as flavorful as one would expect from a burger served on garlic bread.  The shrimp pasta had flavor, but it was nothing out of the ordinary.  There's more flavor in Olive Garden dishes, in my opinion.   In short, everything here seems like its designed to appeal to a wide range of people, and in doing so, it fails to take any risks with too much flavor.  I wouldn't return for anything in particular."
Dale M.,"Columbus, OH",4,5,,5.0,5/4/2012,Great place.  Food. Service  no waiting.  I ordered a wedge salad an tried to put some pepper on it.  The shaker was so full it wouldn't come out.  So I opened the cap and managed to spill it all over the salad.  Our server swept in and replaced it in 3 minutes.  Highly recommended.
Jessica K.,"Columbus, OH",157,36,,5.0,6/16/2011,"I LOVE this place! EVERTHING IS AWESOME- service, food, brew, atmosphere. Keith took me here on our first date and I was impressed. Who says you cant have a super romantic night while drinking a pitcher of beer?"
Elana G.,"Chicago, IL",0,7,,5.0,8/16/2012,"I would like to that BJ's for their great Gluten-Free menu!!! The GF food there is REALLY good, and most importantly, the servers are knowledgeable about gluten intolerance which makes me feel confident in their food."
Stephanie B.,"Cannes, France",40,204,408,5.0,1/23/2009,"I remember when this place opened a year ago and I never managed to get myself over there. Boy, was I missing out! This place is awesome! My boyfriend and I were up in the Polaris area today and decided to stop somewhere for lunch. We went to BJ's to finally give it a try. It's located right by the Polaris mall so if you're out shopping it's right there. But, you have to drive back in these little service roads to get to it so it's a bit confusing. You can see it from the road but it's kind of difficult to get back there! parking isn't bad since they have their own lot. It's a really cool looking place inside. There are some brick walls and the rest of the walls are painted really bright colors - green, red and gold. There is also very dark wood paneling throughout the dining room and it looks very classy yet casual. The ceiling is unfinished and you can see the pipes but it fits the atmosphere and doesn't come off looking cheap. It's a really comfortable place - we felt like we could have hung out there all day. There was a big TV right by our table that I was sort of watching, and TVs were here and there all over the place. There was also a huge screen behind the bar with several different TVs showing several different channels. This looks like a great place to come and watch a game and sit at the bar and enjoy some good food when you're hungry. The place is also very big and spacious. The high ceilings make it seem bigger than it is, maybe, but it's just a comfortable space. My boyfriend spotted the Avocado Spring Rolls appetizer as soon as he opened the menu. We both love avocado so that appetizer choice was a given. Our waitress came by and got us some waters and we put on our order for the spring rolls. And when they came out...yum! They were stuffed with avocados and surprisingly filling. I could only eat two pieces. It also came with this Asian-style sauce to dip it in. It was very sweet, like there was honey in it, and the consistency was like honey as well. Those were the best spring rolls I've ever had, and they were very high-quality since they really were packed with avocados. So good! Our server was also very nice and there was no wait to be seated. The place wasn't very full - just a few tables here and there. Not bad for a Friday afternoon. Everything else on the menu looked so good. The deep dish pizzas looked amazing. They also had burgers, sandwiches, wraps, pastas and desserts. My boyfriend decided on the California Burger and I chose the BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad. The wait wasn't very long for our food, and we didn't even notice anyway because we were in avocado heaven with those appetizers. When our food came out I couldn't believe my eyes. My salad was HUGE! But first, my boyfriend's food. His burger was served on bread and there was more avocado, pepper jack cheese and southwestern ranch. It was delicious. He also got a side of fries with his burger and chose the wedge fries. They were very seasoned and I liked them a lot. But my salad! It was a very hearty helping of lettuce topped with chicken, tomatoes, onions, corn, beans, jicama (which is a Mexican vegetable, I believe, that has the consistency of somewhere between an apple and a water chestnut, but tastes slightly sweet - it's good!), and cheese. It was tossed around in BBQ sauce and southwestern ranch dressing and then topped with a heaping helping of fried onion straws. It. Was. So. Good. And needless to say, there was no way I was eating the whole thing. It was so big, but oh so delicious! It was so full of flavor, too. It was topped with cilantro and every bite was so delicious. And oh my gosh I love onion straws for some reason. I was very happy after eating this salad. Sometimes when I go out to eat I don't want to get a salad because they can be boring, but this definitely was not. It was filling and so delicious. I'm sure it wasn't all that healthy, but it was worth it. I mean, it was pretty much the only thing I was able to eat all day besides the spring roll appetizer so that's not too bad! We ate until we could eat no more and I had to get a box for the rest of my salad. My boyfriend managed to clean his plate. I just finished the rest of my salad a little bit ago for dinner and I am full all over again. Two meals! Before I left the restaurant I stopped at the restroom to find it very clean and well stocked. There were plenty of mirrors and I think about 4 stalls or so. This place is really nice! The prices weren't too bad, either. They are typical for the area. But I feel like the amount of food served makes this place a value for your money. My salad was easily two very filling meals. And they also looked like they had a very interesting beer selection at the bar. I think they also brew their own beer! I can't wait to try them. I'd love to come back here for a couple of drinks and to try some of the other items on the menu. A new favorite of mine!"
jim R.,"Columbus, OH",0,37,,4.0,10/6/2011,"10/6/11. Be prepared to wait unlessyougo reliably. It is a real great place for kids as they serve them ASAP, ahead of the adults at the table. We have been there many times. Last time there was the first time Iordered a meal rather than a salad or a burger. I had the parmesan crusted chicken. It was as good as any meal I have ever had in Columbus. I wit held a five star rating due to the yuppie attitude of the seating staff and the noise of the place."
Nelson M.,"Atlanta, GA",1,48,,4.0,7/20/2013,Great beer and food. Nice tv's at the bar for games.
Jason Y.,"Columbus, OH",553,47,97,4.0,9/1/2010,"This was my second visit here. The first time was not memorable. Had the fish and chips, just not a fan of fish and chips anymore. It's just blah now. This trip was different had the deep dish pizza. Awesome. The big screens and tbs are nice. Service is above average nothing to scream about. It was a little hot in there this time. It's summer. Turn on the ac."
Alec J.,"Newburgh, IN",5,42,36,4.0,11/18/2010,I liked it good service awesome deepdish good antipastas nice atmosphere I have only been there for lunch but I Liked it :)
Doug S.,"Columbus, OH",7,8,6,3.0,11/30/2010,"My family took me here for my birthday. Beautiful place, and the staff was very friendly. I enjoyed their Pumpkin Ale, nice taste. My son had the California burger and he enjoyed it, but said it was nothing out of the ordinary, My wife on the other hand really like the California Burger. 2 of my daughters had the baked potatoes that were huge and they love. I had the Texas style chicken fried steak. I did not enjoy at all. Well the veggies and the white cheddar potatoes were amazing, but the steak itself was greasy and had no flavor. The white sauce on top was about a thimble full and I asked for more they brought me another very small amount. The sauce had no flavor at all. I didn't finish my steaks. Other than that, the menu was large and the variety was amazing. We will try again."
Jana G.,"Lewis Center, OH",19,17,,2.0,1/2/2014,"My family and I have been going to this restaurant for years....unfortunately, our last two trips have been complete failures.  Starting with the 15 minute wait for a server to bring our drinks, to overcooked pasta, no drink refills, and to top it off, it's always freezing in there.  I much prefer some of the smaller, non-chain restaurants around this area, they try harder to please the customers."
Eissa M.,"Chicago, IL",15,8,3,4.0,7/10/2011,Absolutely love BJ's Restaurant. Its affordable and a great place to watch sports!!!
Cody A.,"Columbus, OH",50,26,,5.0,6/7/2013,"This might be a chain but this is my favorite place to eat in Columbus. Staff is friendly and the food is always good. Be prepared to wait on the weekends, up to an hour and a half at times, well worth it! My personal favorite, parm crusted chicken!"
Zola B.,"Columbus, OH",1,19,,2.0,8/10/2010,"I kind of want to give BJ's only 1 star, but I won't because they have vegetarian options and great beer. They also have gluten free pizza, but I highly doubt it's vegan. I got dragged here today for lunch with coworkers and I got the overpriced garden medley salad and it sucked. It was small and it was supposed to come with balsamic vinegarette salad dressing, but instead it was some sweet tasting dressing, which was not good. It was $13 for this small, not tasty salad, a *flat* soda and tip. Ridiculous, especially considering all my coworkers got pasta, pizza and sandwiches for the same price."
Damian C.,"Chicago, IL",346,566,209,4.0,11/28/2007,"I stopped in this place with some friends when I was back in Ohio over the long weekend.  I love trying out new beers, and I had a feeling this place would be similar to Rock Bottom or Goose Island, so I was excited to give it a whirl. The menu looked pretty good, a little better than standard bar-type food.  We all ended up going with the deep-dish specialty pizzas so we could all share.  It was definitely no Chicago-style pizza, but it was pretty decent.  It wasn't very filling, though, so I'd say it was a little pricey bite for bite.   The beers were pretty decent also.  The pale ale was a little more bitter than I was hoping for, but their special pumpkin beer was great!  As filling as they were though, you can really only have 2 or 3 before you get stuffed. They don't have this chain in Chicago or even Illinois yet, but I'm sure when they do it'll be a nice place to grab a bite to eat."
Mel J.,"Dublin, OH",1,16,,5.0,9/19/2011,"Must get the Oreo pizookie!  Sooooooo yummy!  Will definitely come back to try more flavors. Had the avocado spring rolls as an appetizer which was good but missing something?  Maybe a little spice/kick. . . Main course- pot roast sandwich.  Totally heavenly! Meat was so tender, potatoes so garlicky, and bread so cheesy.  Nuff said!"
Jessica L.,"Fort Walton Beach, FL",16,54,7,4.0,9/14/2010,Although it's not my favorite restaurant it is a good one. I'm not a beer drinker but my friends say it's a great selection!  They have a lot of really good pizza's to choose from.  I absolutely love love love their appetizers. They have an excellent flat bread (two of them actually) and their sampler platter for appetizers is great.  I recommend at least getting the taquitos - to die for!  Yum... my mouth is drooling just thinking about it.
Cody B.,"Columbus, OH",12,1,,5.0,2/27/2010,My favorite place in town... You HAVE TO try the pizookie! The entrees are good too... Who doesn't love BJ's?
Steve M.,"Orlando, FL",10,176,73,3.0,7/4/2010,Good food but nothing really outstanding. It can get rather loud on the weekends. The flight of beers is worth the trip.
Greg F.,"Houston, TX",549,327,48,4.0,1/24/2010,"Went here to get some brewskies and grub after a rough flight into Columbus airport.  Food was awesome, beer was cold, waitress cute!  Add in NFL playoffs and it was fantastic.  I had a good time there.  I would return."
