Daniele P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,2.0,5/29/2014,"If you like chain restaurants and the food served at chain restaurants like Chili's or similar then you will like this place. It just costs more. We were in the area on vacation and I chose the place based on reviews even though I knew better considering it was a chain, but I was hopeful. My bad for getting the sampler app that was made up of fried food, again I knew better. The app cost 18 dollars and I was curious to why. It was nothing wow or great about it to be worth 18 dollars at all. I ordered a burger that wasn't cooked exactly to ordered temp but close enough, but it was the most flavorless, boring burger that I have had in a long time. My boyfriend ordered the scallops and they were ok, but nothing great. The food wasn't bad, but for the cost and reviews I had expected more. It was bland, boring, and definitely pre-made before it got into the kitchen. However, the restaurant is clean and very nice looking."
Joshua C.,"Columbus, OH",13,13,,2.0,5/10/2012,"For the wait and service, the food was fairly mediocre. We went in the middle of the week and it was some of the worst service I've ever experienced. The server was friendly, but absent for 10-15 minutes at a time. Also, the entrees came out 2-3 minutes apart from one another, which was odd. The saving grace was the fantastic hand-crafted root beer and cream soda. The place seemed fairly clean, but the mediocre food and terrible service really hurt the overall score."
Tasha A.,"Decatur, GA",51,186,32,5.0,4/1/2008,"I bet you have I got to be world's most picky eater - bet I'd win a trophy lol.  Surprisingly though, BJ's was excellent.  I had a Strawberry Confusion - some concoction of alcohol (a sweet drink for a chick) and a customized pizza.  Man, I was just shocked at how good it was.  The place was pretty crowded for a Monday night, seems like a family type atmosphere, but also an awesome place to watch a big game.  Now I'm sure that considering the amount and variety of beers & mixed drinks they have, this probably wouldn't be a good place to take your family on a game night, but it'd be a good place to have a good time, enjoy the beer as well as the other alcoholic beverages, and watch the game!!"
Amber S.,"Galloway, OH",0,13,2,4.0,6/7/2009,The best deep dish pizza I've had in a long time.  The freshest toppings I've EVER had.  My only wish is that they would keep more typical beers on draught.  Bud Light would've really hit the spot.  The atmosphere is very good- very 'grown up'.  You can dress up if you'd like- or walk in with flip flops.
Stacy K.,"Columbus, OH",28,10,,3.0,6/6/2009,"Didn't hate it, didn't love it. I am torn as of what to think of this place. Our waitress was excellent so A+ on the service, she helped recommend diff beer and was just very friendly to me and my hubby and my 7 month old daughter! Food was just ok. I guess I was expecting more. I think I would consider this place more of a place to go for Happy Hour after work or to watch a game. It seemed like the main focus was on the bar area...(which is presented very well I might add)! I live in Dublin so I guess if I was in the area I might be back or I might go to one of the other many restaurants in the Polaris area. I hope this review is helpful to someone!"
Keith W.,"Columbus, OH",18,231,,3.0,7/12/2008,Food is always decent; service gets a little spotty when they get busy. With that said I have liked everything I have tried
Caroline D.,"Cambridge, MA",0,36,5,4.0,5/18/2010,"i recently moved to boston, but every time i am home i HAVE to eat at BJ's. the spinach and artichoke dip is the best i've ever had, mmm! there is something for everyone on this menu, and it is all delicious. dessert: pizookie -- try it!"
