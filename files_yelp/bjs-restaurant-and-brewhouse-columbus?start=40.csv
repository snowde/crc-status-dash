Russell B.,"Polaris, Columbus, OH",0,2,1,1.0,9/4/2016,We were there with us and another family. 4 kids and 4 adults. Every meal was wrong. Two of them didn't come until after most of us were done eating.  One was a child's pizza that they said came out bad. I'll bet they forgot to order it like the other meal. We repeatedly needed to ask for condiments and things already asked for on meals originally. One meal came out with meat that the person asked to have no meat on cause she was allergic. So she didn't even eat.  After leaving three of us had to go get other food somewhere else.  We blame most of this on the server as he seemed like he didn't care about his job. But who knows.  Maybe it's he kitchen staff as well.  I went to the manager at the end and she had just been notified of the situation. They did take care of the meal. Told her that we like to find places that were rated well. I wonder how many are fake reviews of this place.  I say try someplace different.
Nida R.,"Powell, OH",0,5,,5.0,5/29/2017,One of top favorite restaurants! Their chipotle salmon is amazing! Their service is top notch and the restaurant is usually packed. The wait usually isn't that long but it's worth the wait on a busy Friday night.
Jessie M.,"Tifton, GA",0,3,,5.0,6/10/2017,The flatbread pizza was super good and the trio desert was awesome! Great atmosphere and our service was wonderful! Stopping through on the way to New York and it was awesome!
Amy L.,"Sarasota, FL",10,34,12,4.0,7/2/2017,Their fish and shrimp tacos are terrific!  I had one of each the aoli on the tacos have a sweet flavor that pairs very well with the seafood. Don't forget to squeeze your lime on the tacos to make them Complete.  I had a blonde beer which paired very well with the dish
Benjamin B.,"Columbus, OH",24,6,2,3.0,12/24/2016,"My friends flew in from Colorado and California and our annual tradition has been to meet up at BJ's (they love the fries). This was not my first visit to BJ's but it wasn't all that good either. I ordered a Cesar salad, the Brewhouse Bacon Cheeseburger and the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Mini Pizookie.  The Cesar salad was full of the white rib parts of Lettuce which I find disgusting and the Lettuce was still wet with water and barely dressed at all, I had to order extra dressing.  The Brewhouse Bacon Cheeseburger looked delicious but was very dry, (I ordered medium rare) it came out completely done and the bacon however was perfectly cooked and had the magic crispness and fattiness you look for. No amount of mayo or ketchup could save the dry beef patty :(. At last, the pizookie, the best thing I had to eat. So damn good! Hopefully next time will be better, if not, We'll go somewhere else for our meet ups from now on."
Ken B.,"Charter Township of Clinton, MI",0,3,,2.0,8/12/2017,Never would have thought to serve pot stickers cold but apparently they do here. Totally disappointed. At least i can understand why this place isn't busy on a Saturday night
Paul C.,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",18,83,67,4.0,5/14/2015,"I do enjoy a BJs now and then. My partner and I often end up here after a trip to Polaris - this or cantina over the street. It is a huge menu. Huge. On this occasion, we had a bowl of loaded fries (pulled pork, cheese, onion, cilantro) served in a deep dish. They were great. Not too much of anything - just the right amount of everything. Drinks wise I had a pomegranate margarita, with my girlfriend having a spiked Arnold Palmer - it's a great lemon / tea / vodka combo. Margarita was frozen - it separates pretty quick but still delicious. They're great at beer. They have their own brewery - so they have a standard blonde, brunette and a few pales. It's a nice balanced full bar. I enjoyed the pizza here last time, but I went for the half rack of ribs. My partner had the fish tacos - she likes them from here so it's a regular. With the ribs you get chance to choose two sides, I had the horseradish mash and broccoli. The broccoli was perfectly cooked, and the mash just the right amount of cream.  (With the main meal, I switched to a beer called a Nit Wit, it's a whit beer - really tasty). The ribs were coated with rub and BBQ sauce, a little more sauce would be nice, but they were tasty.  Service was great. Friendly and prompt. Never pushy. As always. I'll be back, as I have been before. Always a nice experience. I've not been to any of the other locations but I believe it's a small chain."
Stephanie L.,"Galena, OH",0,7,1,5.0,12/9/2016,"Love this place. Food is always awesome and bartenders are the best, they really went out of their way to make sure my Bloody Mary was exactly the way I asked:) stuffed mushrooms were amazing."
Lauren L.,"Sparks, NV",0,15,,1.0,7/17/2017,Went here the food was good! Service was a little slow but it was late and I'm sure they were tired! Was charged on my credit card a little over double!? Spoke with GM who kindly refunded my money and a some extra but I was totally under the impression it wasn't a big! Look at your bank statement after it clears! I was told the manager should have told me my card was charged for someone else's check and they tried to cancel it. Kinda scary!!! If I didn't catch this would they have?? Could have been extra money for the business!
Wing Yan K.,"Columbus, OH",57,63,189,3.0,2/29/2016,"On a typical Friday night, everywhere is quite busy, so we waited for about 20 minutes to get seated. One thing I like about BJ's is they have so much variety of foods and drinks. From burger to pasta, and other special cocktails and taps, it is hard to get bored with their menu. The food didn't take too long to arrive after we placed our order. However, they brought out the wrong food for one of my friend. While my friend waiting for his food to come out, the manager came back and apologize for the mistake. He also offer a soup on the house. The management handled the situation exceptionally well for their staff mistakes! The portion of their food is pretty huge. I like their Jambalaya because of the amount of different ingredients that they used [Grill chicken and shrimp, sausage, green pepper...] The only thing is they are pretty oily. Spaghetti and Meatballs is way too spicy. So please be cautious if you cannot handle spicy food. We spend like quite some time in the restaurant chit-chatting. We left the restaurant around 9-ish and there are still a lot of people waiting to get seated. Overall, I like their variety choices on the menu and their staffs is very friendly as well."
Ashley M.,"Columbus, OH",0,7,,3.0,12/11/2016,Tried to go to Bjs today.  Sat down and ordered a drink.  Maybe the bartender was new but he only gave us 1 menu never looked back at us.  Took 10 minutes just to try and cash out and he gave attitude.  The food is normally good but service is the main reason we revisit restaurants.
Angie K.,"Philadelphia, PA",15,228,368,4.0,12/23/2015,"BJ's has a standard restaurant-chain menu, but their food is actually really good compared to other chains. The best entree is probably the jambalaya (huge chunks of chicken and shrimp over  tasty rice, and it's really not that spicy). However, if you are going to BJ's you have got to have a pizookie. It's like a requirement. It's the perfect dessert combination of warm cookie and ice cream. The beers are all good. Really can't go wrong with any. Not much else to say. Good food for the price, good/decent service, and good beer."
Joe E.,"Dublin, OH",73,319,420,3.0,5/22/2015,"I hadn't been to BJ's in a while.   True confession has been that it has not been one of my favorite restaurants, especially since so many other dining options are available in the Polaris area.   My most recent visit has me taking a second look at BJ's.   It was quite a pleasant experience.   Co-workers went to celebrate another birthday luncheon.   Service was spot-on today.  Drinks kept filled.  Folks received what they ordered.  Our server was personable, attentive and responsive.   There menu did not seem to be as expansive as in the past.   If you are looking for their lunch menu, flip to the back.  I ordered the lunch sized barbeque chicken chopped salad.   It was topped with fried onion rings as an added touch.  The salad was quite tasty and a reasonable lunch size.  I will likely be back again to BJ's."
Dustin T.,"Columbus, OH",0,10,,4.0,1/30/2017,"I like BJ's.  My wife and I stopped by for a late lunch/early dinner.  Ordered some boneless buffalo wings and I had a pulled pork sandwich, while she chose a grilled cheese sandwich from the Lunch menu.  Her's wasn't quite what she suspected, and was more of a club but was still tasty.  My pulled pork was excellent and juicy, a good balance.  I opted against the slaw that comes on the side, I don't like thick cut slaw.  The wings were awesome, and tasty.  Portion sizes are amazing.  We had plenty to take home with us for the kid.   Would definitely recommend."
Seema A.,"Troy, MI",4,26,,2.0,4/13/2017,"Well, we first stumbled upon this place while visiting Dallas in 2013.  We were blown away by what we ordered and loved the food.  This past weekend we were in the Columbus area so we were geeked to eat our favorite avocado egg rolls.  I remember the flavors so vividly.... yet was disappointed when we got our food here.  There was no cream cheese in the rolls like there was supposed to be.  There was some sort of odd thick creamy paste inside the rolls that I really could not identify.  We ordered the barbacoa cauliflower tacos which sounded good.  When they arrived it just looked like 2 small pitas with some stuff melted on top.  There was no substance to it.  I asked for some broccoli slaw which I thought was coleslaw so that the tacos would have more bulk to it, but turns out it's not coleslaw even though I asked what it was before adding it on.  It's actually just a cream based sauce.  It was just all around disappointing.  The beer was good as well as the dessert (got the Triple Chocolate PIzookie) but the main event was lacking.  The server was nice in the beginning but as our meal went on he just seemed like he wanted to be anywhere else but there."
April S.,"Westerville, OH",200,189,655,3.0,7/31/2015,"Lunch special is great priced.  Personal pizza that comes with salad or soup is $7. I definitely recommend the wedge salad. I am not usually one for bleu cheese but wow, Their dressing was amazing! Had the personal pizza this time, very deep dish and fluffy. I am pretty plain so just got cheese. It comes with diced tomatoes on top as well. I'm not usually one for diced tomatoes but it made the taste even better!  I am becoming a fan of this joint,  very yummy!"
Miranda H.,"Columbus, OH",25,9,,4.0,7/17/2017,Food was great however the waiter was slightly rude. I felt rushed a little. Maybe we caught her on a bad day? I would return but maybe to another location.
Dave W.,"Galena, OH",54,4,11,1.0,2/5/2016,"Tonight we went to BJ's for the first time. We used their app to be put on the wait list (60 minute wait) so by the time we got to the restaurant we only had a 5 minute wait. I liked the atmosphere of the place but that ended up being the highlight. When we were seated the host suggested the Brisket Burger or the Club. He said the Brisket Burger was huge, about 3/4 of a pound and with all the other toppings it was almost a full pound.  So our server arrived and asked about drinks. I ordered one of their in house made beers only to be told they were all out of that one. No big deal so I ordered an iced tea instead. After a few minutes he came back to take our order. I decided to take the hosts suggestion and ordered the brisket burger, my daughter ordered the roast beef dip and my wife was trying to decide between the brisket burger and the balsamic chicken. The server asked how hungry she was and that the brisket burger was a lot of food. She opted for the chicken but upon hearing this I was getting excited to see this thing.  When they brought the food out (by a runner) my burger was the size of a something from the dollar menu at McDonalds but on a huge bun. After I looked at this I motioned for the server and asked what was the deal that this pathetic piece of meat wasn't anywhere close to what both he and the host described. With out saying a word, he took it away. I thought he was going to reorder it and that somebody just screwed up in the kitchen.  A few minutes later another person (I am assuming he was a manager) came to the table and informed us that their burgers are a 5 ounce pattie. That is a big difference from 3/4 pound that the host said actually it is nearly a half pound of difference. What really took the cake was when he asked if I wanted to order something else or if I was set. WTF, I waited an hour before getting there, then when they brought out the food I didn't take the first bite and now your asking if I am all set. By this point I was starved.  So he brought back a menu and I quickly decided on the Texas fried steak. He took my order and 10 minutes later my dinner was served. Of course my wife and daughter had finished their meals by now. I don't know if this was their normal meat or they just pulled the worst chunk they had for a customer that already had complained but this was tough, gristly and had almost no flavor. I didn't want to wait again so I decided to just deal with it and cut around the inedible parts. I guess that was a good plan since the server never bothered to come back to ask how my dinner was.  He brought the check and while I wasn't looking for a comp or discount etc, I would have thought an apology or at least acknowledgment of the situation was in order. I guess I was wrong."
Kevin R.,"Riverview, Columbus, OH",93,2,,5.0,6/30/2017,5/5 had a great experience and the food was delicious. Salads came out after our entree and management came out and personally apologized. Got free dessert out of it! Highly recommend
Heather D.,"Columbus, OH",57,156,371,5.0,5/3/2014,"Great food.  A little pricey but worth it.  This was our third time here.  This time we meet an old colleague.  We will be back again as we still haven't tried the pizza.    We got stuffed mushrooms appetizer again we've gotten this every time, they are awesome.  My man even eats them and he is not a mushroom fan, but he's coming around. I had a Jeremiah Red beer and the roast beef dip sandwich with wedge fries.  My man got the classic burger with wedge fries.  Both were very good."
