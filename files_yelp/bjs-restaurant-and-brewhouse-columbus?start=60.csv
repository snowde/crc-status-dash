Natallia S.,"Hilliard, OH",37,11,7,5.0,6/19/2016,"Absolutely love this location, food is always delicious, especially calamari app and ribs, also have good sandwiches and their thin cut fries are absolutely amazing. Staff is always friendly and attentive, refills come on time and we've never had to wait for our check. Even on the busy holidays wait doesn't go further 15-20 minutes. We go there almost every week and would highly recommend this place to anyone who is hungry.  The only downfall is absence of patio seating but I think they are working on it"
Vlad B.,"West Portsmouth, OH",24,20,2,5.0,3/23/2016,"Ignore the bad reviews, like I did and you should.  Awesome atmosphere.  Terrific food.  Try it! Much better than other BJ's."
Kat A.,"Elyria, OH",0,34,,5.0,1/24/2017,"I came here for the first time on a Friday night with my fiance. It seemed fairly busy, but we were seated quickly. The service was prompt and polite, and although out server appeared to be taking care of a pretty large section of the restaurant, we didn't wait long for anything. We each had a burger,  and both were cooked perfectly. We also has the stuffed mushrooms which I loved. They have a decent wine selection at good prices, and my fiancé enjoyed  the house beer he ordered as well. Overall, a great experience."
Behrouz Z.,"Chicago, IL",40,3,,4.0,9/29/2016,"Came for lunch. Had Brussels sprouts app which were good.  Got the chicken Alfredo for lunch which was not bad.  At lunch they had $3.50 pints of beer which was my favorite part of the lunch, had a couple great house brewed Oktoberfest beers.   cheers"
James H.,"Cleveland, OH",3,6,2,3.0,6/17/2016,Not enough bang for the buck enough said . Drop the price for everything by 2 $ and you have potential.  Pizza was too much bread ; tacos were 2 for 10? What ? Beer was meh. Not again.
Melissa L.,"Charlotte, NC",10,17,5,5.0,9/3/2016,Delicious. We had a fabulous time and all the food was tasty. We split a small pizza and entree salad. It was more than enough for us and the birthday dessert was just the right size.
Nathan D.,"Columbus, OH",13,17,1,1.0,6/18/2016,"Two of us out of a party of three called ahead to ensure we could watch the USA quarterfinal game.  After the hostess checked with management, we were told it would be no problem.  They changed the channel but when someone asked to change it back to the channel every other tv was on, they did...despite us having the larger party.  The server tried, he was fine. Poor customer service by manager."
Jean V.,"Bellville, OH",36,22,98,5.0,3/6/2016,"Always a great meal. Use the app for call ahead to be out on the waitlist, as there is usually a wait to be seated. Never been disappointed with my meal."
Olga D.,"Powell, OH",1,16,,5.0,8/18/2017,"love this restorant,especially polaris location.waiters fast,nice, i often have a reward coupon,or a promotion ,never had any problems,place is busy,which is a good thing,lots of young people,never had a food that i did not like,and prices very reasonable,must have a Jeremaya red beer,the best flavor,my husband and i always order a pitcher,best value,its 4 glasses for the price of 3,another favorite is a full rack of ribs,comes with two sides,pizza is another favorite.i always recommend this place when talking with friends. great job!"
Karissa S.,"Westerville, OH",1,18,1,5.0,9/22/2016,"Love love love this place. The food is always fresh and delicious. It's a bit on the expensive side, but you certainly get what you pay for. They have healthy options as well. My favorite is the quinoa bowl, so fresh and yummy! I have to say that if you come here, save room for dessert! The pizookies are so delicious. They are basically giant cookies fresh out of the over with a scoop of ice cream on top. I've stopped in just for dessert. You can't beat it!"
Samantha M.,"Pickerington, OH",28,57,1,5.0,7/18/2016,We went Saturday!! The food was so good. Great prices! Huge portions! A lot of delicious options to pick from. We had the spinach parmesan stuffed mushrooms..AMAZING!! I had the chicken alfredo. My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich. Everything was so good. I love the style french fries they use. So yummy!!
Olivia S.,"Columbus, OH",5,18,48,4.0,12/31/2015,"I love bjs! I've never had s bad experience here. The food is great, service is good and so are the drinks. This location gets very busy and there is usually a wait if you get here around 6:30 or later. The only downfall is that they only offer their happy hour in the bar area (which is pretty small & fills up quick considering how busy they get). They do have a good happy hour special, half off mini deep dish pizzas, $2 off appetizers & drafts. Oh yeah and the pazookies are delicious!!"
Maria R.,"San Antonio, TX",152,39,93,3.0,1/31/2015,"If I could've given 3.5 stars I would have. We went on a Saturday night so it was a bit of a wait and barely any seating. The hostesses weren't the friendliest but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt it was busy.  The ambiance was very nice and we enjoyed our booth. Wanda, our waitress, was very nice and knowledgeable. Service was a tad slow but again, it was busy. The food was good and the prices were reasonable."
Ashley R.,"Marion, OH",4,54,29,5.0,12/21/2015,I ordered curbside from here last night and i was very pleased with my order. My balsamic grilled chicken was on point. I only wish I had asked for more balsamic dressing. I also ordered the smorez pizzooki... I am not a fan however I do love the chocolate chip pizzooki... I also order a cherry Pepsi to be made and they did a great job. I will be back!
Madhulika S.,"Greenwood, IN",9,42,33,5.0,11/11/2015,"For a brewhouse, this place has a pretty darn good vegan menu. I got the mini deep dish pizza. It was really nice. My team mates got chicken wings, fish tacos and thin crusted pizza and they loved it too. My team has been here many times but this was my first visit, surely coming back. The ambience was good and the deserts looked to die for:)"
Candace N.,"Columbus, OH",82,14,1,2.0,11/22/2016,On 11/18 around 10:00 pm I went to this location and it took all of 5 minutes plus for the server to appear. Stephanie R started out okay but would rather chat with her co-workers who sat at a tall table eating and drinking than service my friends and i. Calamari came out quick and hot. My burger took more than 20 minutes and it was like warm...Stephanie said she brought it out as soon as it came up...not sure how when she spent a lot of time with customers and her co-workers. I like BJ'S BUT this location and the Easton location allows their co-workers to dine and drink once they are off shift in the front area of the bar. Their co-worker friends spend more time with them than the do customers. At both locations (Easton I visited twice) service is horrible. At Easton the manager had a meeting with servers while me and my cousins sat waiting with no one acknowledging us until they were done.
Ryan W.,"Delaware, OH",0,20,2,1.0,4/22/2016,1 star but would give less for no response to our complaints.  We haven't been back and won't be any time soon and we aren't missing out.  This chain will die out along with the others as obviously they do not understand how to run a business and maintain a faithful clientele.
Lisa M.,"Mebane, NC",65,13,,5.0,8/6/2016,"Okay so I see they that this place is not very high with the stars. I'm completely disagree. We have had nothing but a fabulous experience. The food is awesome, the hand crafted beers were great. It has been awesome. When we come back we will definitely make a trip back."
Daggie D.,"Galena, OH",0,3,,3.0,8/3/2016,"I have a couple complaints about my recent visit to BJ's Brewhouse.  First I was casually going to the bathroom and I went out to wash my hands and there was soothing music playing in the background and all the sudden I heard: ""SUMMER, PARTY OF 5!!!"" It was way louder than it should have been. I jumped almost ten feet in the air because it scared me so much. Next, My friend ordered a burger and the whole thing was Burnt because the waiter didn't even bother to ask how he would like it cooked. We also had to ask every time we needed a refill. That is something you shouldn't have to ask for, it's the waiters responsibility to do that task. Other than that I had a pretty enjoyable time."
Amanda D.,"Lewis Center, OH",24,149,14,1.0,8/14/2015,Ugh I just don't get it. I have tried more than once to give BJ's a chance but it's just not good. Every time it seems to be really busy and I have no idea why.  The food is so boring but at the same time over priced.  I leave feeling like I paid a lot for something I didn't enjoy. For some reason the service at this location specifically is bad too.  The last time our server just clearly didn't care.  Oh well plenty of much better choices.
