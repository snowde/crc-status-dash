Apal B.,"New York, NY",10,37,,4.0,11/10/2015,"The drinks and food are mostly what you expect from a place like this. You come here for the pizooki. I've recently moved to New York and I still crave BJ's pizooki.  A delicious, soft cookie in a skillet with ice cream and toppings like caramel or fudge (depending on which you get) that just works so well you're craving it for days after having it.  Drop by for a pizooki!"
Sarah F.,"Columbus, OH",125,512,202,3.0,3/31/2015,"Been twice in the last 6 months and both times I was pleased! Personally I think the menu is obnoxiously big, but at least I had some good vegetarian options. I actually liked what I got the first time so much that I ordered the same thing when I went back! However, the mixed drinks are good but expensive. So I had the Kale and Brussels sprout salad, sounds intense but SO GOOD. The second time I went the presentation was really lacking, it came out looking like they had stuffed it into a cup and plopped it on the plate. This made it look like barely any food and I wanted to complain until I moved it around with my fork and it looked much more appetizing! Along with that I ordered the fried artichoke hearts for an appetizer. I don't think this will even be my first choice, but if someone else invites me along I know I can find something I like."
Robert U.,"Pittsburgh, PA",130,696,131,3.0,3/22/2014,"Standard BJ's.  I've been to several.  Hats off to them for consistency.  This is no different from the others. The food is quite good.  I really like the avocado egg rolls starter.  I like the Santa Fe Salad, and the Seared Ahi Salad.  Fresh greens, good looking veggies, etc. The service, however, is glacially slow.  Pretty bad.  Friendly when they do get to you, but it's as if they expect everybody's on a two-hour lunch (we're not).  It's consistently SO SLOW, it's a deal-breaker for a business lunch."
Dan H.,"Beaufort, SC",7,9,11,4.0,10/13/2015,"Even though the pork chops on the online menu mom was hanker n for weren't there, we stayed for dinner. I'm so glad we did. Mom got the dolphin and it was really good. I got the kale and spinach salad with blackened salmon and it was really good. I might have given them 5 stars but the house brewed porter was pretty sad. Tasted liked something I might have brewed in a bucket in my kitchen. Maybe it was just a bad batch but they do call themselves a brewhouse. One would expect to get a really good beer in a place like this and maybe semi-good food but tonight it was the other way around. The food was so good I'll be back and next time try another flavor of beer."
Maria S.,"Columbus, OH",0,8,3,1.0,6/12/2016,"Went there with a large Group after our Cheerleading Competition.  I understand that we were a large group so waiting longer is expected.  We waited over 30 minutes for the waitress to figure out the checks.  When she came back they were wrong, so she had to take them back and try again.  After 30 more minutes had past we went looking for a Manager to see if he could help speed things up since it had been an hour since we had finished our food.  The manager did not seem to care that the checks were not right or ready.  We finally just asked to give us whatever they had.  I couldn't get out of there fast enough.  It was so bad that I don't want to risk going back to the poor service and a manager that doesn't give a crap.  Food was average."
Theresa H.,"Pflugerville, TX",7,6,,5.0,6/10/2016,'My husband and I with some friends came for dinner....it was great! . It was a do-over..from a bad experience! ..my husband had steak and I had fish and chips. ....it was delicious. ..Susan was our server and she was one of the best servers we've had in a long time! !!
Anna S.,"Columbus, OH",69,350,262,3.0,11/20/2013,"This chain is best described as Cheesecake Factory Lite.  Envision the same huge menu (it has page numbers!) filled with upscale bar food and a mish-mash of everything including American-, Italian-, and Asian-inspired items.  This restaurant is great for accommodating groups of people who all like different things or have dietary restrictions.  For example, for a chain, this restaurant has plenty of vegetarian and gluten free options.  Additionally, the brews are pretty good.  On my last visit I tried the Oktoberfest and it was quite delicious.     Out of the entrees, I enjoy the pizzas and the salads.  As other reviewers have noted, I also like the small plates section, which let's you try decently portioned and priced items like tasty flatbreads, mac and cheese, stuffed mushrooms, etc.  There are some rotating seasonal items (e.g. a watermelon and feta salad during summer).  Also, no trip is complete without a Pizooki, the restaurant's signature dessert.  It comprises of a large, freshly warmed (don't think it's freshly baked) soft cookie topped with ice cream.  Several flavors are available and honestly, you can't go wrong with the giant gobs of sugar involved.  Plus, I believe a portion of the proceeds benefit the company's cystic fibrosis fund.  So eat some calories for a good cause!"
Bob D.,"Beavercreek, OH",1,16,4,5.0,7/11/2015,Great spot in Polaris! Excellent food in a great atmosphere. Menu is solid with pizza as the fan favorite. A little pricey but worth it!  Theodore is great behind the bar!
Tom H.,"Westerville, OH",118,301,1990,4.0,2/16/2015,"Noon on Valentine's Day. The heavy winter weather slowed down the crowd. ""Table for two please"". ""No! Not a booth"". Pay attention at all points of customer contact. Many patrons had their coats on at their table. Pay attention, it's cold out, and I had to ask you to compensate by turning on the over the door space heaters. ""One is broken, but I will lock the side doors so only the revolving is used"",mgr. The decor was clean, eye catching, and not cluttered.  We were promptly greeted by our server, who suggested drinks, and appetizers. There were no specials, only highlighted, feature items. To keep what was in front of us hot, we ordered in sequence. The dinner salad was nice, but small to share. The house Italian dressing was unexceptionable. The plates to share theses items came from the sever station near the door. Side plates were ice cold. Great for the salad, but not the hot items. The baked lasagna was next. (Note... The menu states it is ravioli) the plump cheese ravioli unbalanced the taste for lasagna. Too much ricotta. The meat marinara was very good. Not Diablo enough for me, but most will find it fresh, and zesty with flavor. Of course, unless we were both going to hover over the same baking pan, I was elected to add my portion to the cold plate. My Valentines gift to you sweetheart. Next came the Tavern Cut Brewhouse Classic pizza. We substituted peppers for mushroom, and added extra sauce based on other comments without complaint. The pizza was GREAT! Many around us had the deep dish. The crust was thin and crispy. The pepperoni was so thin that if it was exposed, it crackled like a chip. The sausage was well seasoned, not a breakfast blend. Of course the cheese was stringy(real), with no imitation snap back. My suggestion would be to ask for extra sauce hot on the side. Their recipe is designed to keep the crust crispy throughout. Then came the Salty Carmel Pizookie. There is nothing more indulgent I can say about this, that has not been said before. I would encourage you to remove the chocolate treat except for the chocolate Pizookie. The manager visited our table, and we shared our visit. I did go back inside to tell our manager Bentley that he should consider shoveling the walk, or at least putting down salt. We will return, but sit farther from the front door."
Sheila C.,"Columbus, OH",20,25,76,3.0,5/22/2015,Love the deep dish pizza...Mmm and our waitress was very friendly. We arrived early Friday evening to beat the crowd. It does get very crowded and noisy here. I've only had the pizza and I love it. Very filling no need for appetizer
James P.,"Willard, OH",0,5,1,4.0,5/8/2016,"First time there. Food was pretty good. I got a steak, garlic mashed potatoes and broccoli. Mashed potatoes were awesome. Steak was good, cooked well, but not seasoned. My wife got the salmon and I tried it. Tastes great. Waitress was very nice but not very present. In fairness it was on the busier side."
Lucinda S.,"Poca, WV",54,11,13,5.0,7/17/2015,This place was awesome. Seriously the best burger I've ever had!!!  Both the bun and meat were grilled to perfection. I will definitely go back!
Josie T.,"Westerville, OH",354,41,40,5.0,4/12/2015,"You can never go wrong here! Ask for Erin- but all of the servers are great! They have great small starters, appetizers & pizzas. Great beer menu and carry out service. Best restaurant in Polaris for lunch or dinner. Nice rewards program too."
Joseph B.,"Westerville, OH",0,11,3,5.0,8/9/2015,Way more than beer. Try the Barbacoa Chicken. Everything on the menu is great and the service is excellent
Wendy S.,"Dublin, OH",13,54,16,4.0,2/28/2016,"The food and service has always been great! They've been accommodating for birthday parties, and one of the few restaurants that provide good service even when you're sitting at the bar."
Mileah D.,"Springfield, OH",45,6,,5.0,4/1/2016,We have never had a bad experience. Our meals last night were amazing (all 3 of us) and the beer suggestions from our server were on point. I wish I had known about the rewards card a few visits ago. I love it!
Brian K.,"Columbus, OH",0,9,,5.0,4/24/2016,Consistently delicious food and house beers.  Large menu with wide variety. Great service although we always sit at bar.
Cindy M.,"Columbus, OH",17,21,24,2.0,10/5/2014,"It was a first date scenario, so since I wasn't paying I didn't say anything to Ashley. Who by the way was excellent. Very personable and knew the menu well. I order Parmesan Crusted Chicken and although the meal came out quickly, the presentation was disappointing. I don't know what type of green garnish was on the plate, but it was too much.  The mashed potatoes looked liked someone scooped them out of a giant bowl on stand by with an ice cream scooper, and I got maybe three pieces of broccoli. The broccoli was cold. Everything else was warm, not hot, warm.  I understand Columbus is the food testing capital of the world, so when you first roll into town you're on your best behavior. But please don't end up like one of those restaurant/chains that gradually but eventually goes down hill due to being greedy and being inconsistent with your product.  If every item of food is not ready to go on the plate, then don't put it on the plate because the warming lights aren't working. Thankfully my date and Ashley were able to shine above the food. However, I personally will have to think long and hard before I choose BJ's again."
Mark M.,"North Ridgeville, OH",95,26,33,4.0,8/15/2014,"Stopped at BJ's for dinner while visiting Columbus, OH . Was told the wait would be 20-25 minutes but ""could be less."" Actual wait time was only six minutes! The place was packed and the guest seemed to be enjoying their dining experience. There was plenty of wait staff and they were clearly hustling to give their customers a great experience. If you like alcoholic beverages, BJ's had a wide selection of beverages available. The menu had a nice variety of offerings, too. Our waitress, Ginny, kept our water glasses filled and made sure everything was OK with our meal. If you've read any of my other restaurant reviews, you'll discover one of my biggest complaints about most places are cold fries. My fries at BJ's were luke warm but Ginny had fresh, hot fries ready in just a couple minutes! Next time I'm in Columbus, I'll be stopping by BJ's to try something else on their menu."
Tasha L.,"Delaware, OH",9,37,8,2.0,1/2/2016,This place is extravagant looking and all but the food is mediocre at best and over priced.  They have some good beers though and a nice staff. Not a bad place to kick back and have a few appitizers or something if you're passing through.
