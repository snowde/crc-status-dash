Naureen H.,"Martinez, CA",29,10,29,4.0,1/5/2018,"It's hard to review chain restaurants since one location might differ from other and that's the case for BJ's in my opinion. The last one i went to is in Cupertino and I remember getting good service and food. I believe that this location in Concord has room for improvement. It's by no means smaller or less busy than other locations. We usually sit in the bar area which has nice big screens. Since service is a hit or miss, we prefer the bar top so to get timely attention.  Food quality needs significant improvement and servers need to check back faster after food is dropped. I used to love their pizza but lately it's not been good and I just don't know what to expect. There were chunks of chicken of varying sizes in pizza. Once I got buffalo chicken pizza and it had bbq sauce in it. Jambalaya and Avocado egg rolls didn't disappoint though.  For drinks, it's safe to stick to beer which BJ's does well. I yet have to try their happy hour and lunch menu.  Food, drinks and service aside, I will always be back for pizookie while hoping that they will step up their overall game."
Mister A.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,3,1,5.0,12/28/2017,"Douglas, The manager was pretty cool and professional  He Helped us get a good seat when it was crowded. The food is good here."
Chelsea H.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",21,27,13,2.0,12/19/2017,Honestly I'm not sure why I gave BJ's another chance. It had been over a year last I came here.  I'll start with the positive: drinks & food we're good. Table was clean.  Negative. Where do I start? From the server to the lack of customer service to waiting for plates and napkins and water! Totally ignored all night and our server clearly had some personal problem going on. We never could find him.  Our server was overwhelmed because all we saw him do was run ( literally running)  around the restaurant but not actually pay much attention to any tables. Ours especially. We were so ignored the whole night. Any request we had was always forgotten until we asked 2-3 more times. He seemed annoyed and flustered. My friend and I have worked in restaurants and retail so we can understand being overwhelmed however when we really looked around half his section was empty. We could hear other tables upset with his service and clearly he was paying attention and fooling around with one table more than the rest of ours.  Finally we get our check after being here for over 2 hours and we waited another 30 minutes just to PAY!! I flagged down someone else and she said she couldn't do it so finally we went to the front and pleaded for us to be able to pay so we could leave.   I don't even think the guy noticed we left the table he was hiding in the back so much.  I will never return here after this. Never. I'll chop my arm off before I come back here! Seriously pick ANYWHERE else in concord and pleasant hill and you'll get ten times better service.
Leeann P.,"Vallejo, CA",248,109,681,3.0,11/27/2017,"I used to love BJ's but i feel like the quality of the food here has gone down and extremely salty. I do appreciate their lunch menu on the weekdays though, that give a pretty good amount of food for the price.  Their avocado rolls are always on hit! Even though I'm always tempted to get a different appetizer, the avocado egg rolls are always a go-to. As far as drinks, I know this is a brewery but I'm not so much of a beer person so haven't tried any of those yet. But i have tried the mixed drinks and they are just not good at all. They're definitely on the weaker side. I got the margarita that was flat and then got a Long Island to try to get a buzz, and nothing. It's like the drinks were virgin and had no alcohol in them. That was a waste of $15. Anyway, BJ's is definitely known for their pazookies and i love those!!!!!! Whatever cookie you order is good! Tip: order ice cream on the side. That way your cookie doesn't get hard too fast ;)"
Dana A.,"El Sobrante, CA",4,33,7,5.0,11/24/2017,"I've never had a problem with my food order. There's always something good to try.  My kids love the selection here and the crayons and activity menus. Pizookies are a must and child sundaes are cheap! Also just had great service from our server Daniel, he tastefully dressed his uniform with a few cool Disney pins.  He was very laid back and informative on the menu. He was able to check if I could order a dish that was once on the menu but that they no longer ""carry"". He was very polite and checked on our table frequently. Thanks Daniel!"
Colin C.,"Las Vegas, NV",121,183,168,4.0,9/11/2017,"I have a hard time understanding why all the BJ's get 2.5-3 stars. They're all well above average! I am a bodybuilder and a true foodie. After my competitions, I insist on going straight to BJ's because it's one stop shopping for me. I typically get a small pizza, ribs with double fries, and the Pizookie Trio. They're all very tasty. If I went to a pizza place, maybe the pizza would be better. If I went to a BBQ place, maybe the ribs would be better. But everything is very solid and I am someone who is somewhat critical of food.  The service was also friendly and prompt.  My wife and I we're waiting on four other friends so we sat in the bar area when we initially got there. It was a Saturday night so they were on about a 60 minute wait. While in the bar, Carlos waited on us. He was super nice and took really good care of us. We ordered soft drinks and chips and guacamole. The chips were good, the guacamole was OK. I added some salt and it made it three times better. Shortly there after, our friends arrived and we went and got seated where all six of us could comfortably sit. We ordered a bunch of entrées and all kind of tried a little bit of each other's. The calamari was good, the bison burger was good. I thought my ribs were really good as always. The pizza was also very tasty per the usual.  One thing that I did differently this time was that we as a table got the pizookie platter (I think it was called) which was absolutely amazing. After having dieted for 20 weeks, I felt like I could eat three of them. It is huge, though. 20 bites in and I feel like I'm going into a food coma and a sugar high.  Anyways, you get the point. I'm a big fan of this place. We live in Vegas and have been to 2 locations here and have also been to locations in SoCal and now NorCal. If you haven't been, go!  Check out my photos for more representation of the visit!"
Miko A.,"San Francisco, CA",162,93,426,5.0,12/17/2017,This was our waitress Nikki and she was amazing. Very sweet and attentive. If you get her as your waitress you're sitting in the right area. She was kind enough to notify us that the coffee was still brewing due to the fact that everyone was ordering coffee. Really great service. Hope we get her again.
Eric T.,"Antioch, CA",88,545,6990,3.0,11/7/2017,"Not a bad hippy place, but this place can be busy. Food is a star above Outback and their cocktails are pretty good.  The garlic lemon chicken wings were good flavor but was a bit too dry from being in the fryer too long."
Adrianna T.,"Richmond, CA",211,66,192,4.0,8/18/2017,"I usually go here on a fluke, either for happy hour or because I'm craving a pizookie. Their happy hour is from 3pm-7pm I believe. They have draft beers and wine for less that $10, I think it was about $3-$6 per beer or wine. I know they also have cocktails on the happy hour, but I have yet to try one of them just because I don't really like mixed drinks.  As for their pizookie's... Orgasmic. I mean of course, you can make your own cookies and get some ice cream together. But it's not the same to me... The cookie is so moist and hot, it goes really well with the cold ice cream. They have oreo, chocolate chip, macadamian nut, red velvet flavors, etc... Red velvet is my favorite!  So far, the customer service has been great. I haven't had any complaints! Maybe next time I'll have an appetite and order something off the menu for a change, other than having dessert and alcohol lol."
Gene B.,"East Bay, CA",251,648,993,3.0,12/4/2017,Not quite sure why I liked BJ so much in the past. My feeling about this place did a complete 180. Something about the food that is not clicking with me. I just can't figure it out. I need to make another return and try again. One thing you can't go wrong with is the beer. That's the truth.
C T.,"Vallejo, CA",0,7,,4.0,1/7/2018,"First time visiting last Saturday.  Wings were OUTSTANDING.  Just the right coating, seasoning and tenderness.  Whomever was cooking last week, please don't change the wings.  Beet and arugula salad was very tasty...greens were fresh.  Two cocktails very good..just the right amount in my gin and tonic with my favorite Tangauray Ten.  Wait staff a little slow in taking our order, but very friendly with good suggestions."
R L.,"Pinole, CA",0,20,3,1.0,1/5/2018,"Horrible service!! I called ahead before arriving and was told there was a 30 min wait, when we got to BJ's they hadn't put us on their list! The hostess then put us on their call ahead list which then we were told was a 10 min wait. We ended up waiting another 20 mins. When I asked where we were on their wait list, I was told they were going to seat us ""now"" there were still no tables available. We then had to wait again."
May F.,"Antioch, CA",4,26,74,4.0,11/7/2017,This place is our go to when we're here around the area. We came here for a late lunch and just waited a few minutes to be seated. We ordered spaghetti from the lunch special and it's a good portion and price ($10.25). Also ordered the best beginnings appetizer($19.25) and Peruvian Quinoa with Shrimp($14.25)  Good  costumer service!!!
Miguel S.,"San Francisco, CA",60,1,,5.0,1/5/2018,"So I took my wife for her birthday , the appetizers  came in  a timely manner so as the entrees, my son loved his Mac n cheese , we all had dinner at the same time not like other restaurants where they also forget his food, Bianca the server kept our water glasses full and was always attentive to our needs . Douglas the general manager checked on us a couple times and all we could say was ""everything is perfect"" Thanks for making my wife's birthday special!!!!"
Gaby O.,"Berkeley, CA",505,7,2,1.0,1/1/2018,Horrible customer service. If you order takeout be ready to get hung up on 15 times and wait 20 minutes to place a order.
Rachel M.,"Danville, CA",0,7,1,1.0,1/9/2018,Terrible bjs location I called to place an order and asked if I can pay over the phone because someone else would be picking up my order they informed me I couldn't do that but I can order and pay through the app ok no problem as I'm placing the order online I get a call from bjs and they tell me that I can actually place the order with them and pay for it online ok great I place my order they put me on hold for a little while and then answer the phone and tell me that I actually can not pay online and would have to do it in person and by this time the kitchen had closed and I couldn't order online anymore so screw You guys we were left hungry
Vanessa S.,"El Sobrante, CA",4,23,1,5.0,12/28/2017,Delicious Food and nice atmosphere. Half off wine Tuesdays. Definitely going back to try other meals. They accommodate plate orders if you want to switch something out. Great Service too!
Steph C.,"Castro Valley, CA",2,20,39,5.0,11/24/2017,"Came here on Black Friday to take a load off our feet, and I was extremely excited that I was able to get the unlimited soup and salad lunch special. Usually I only come on the weekends and that special is only for weekdays. I always just continuously order the tomato mozzarella salad (one of my favs) and the chicken tortilla soup. What made the experience more awesome was our server Daniel, who was quick and attentive and checked in on us enough that we weren't just sitting around waiting to order more.  He also was very patient with our table and the millions of questions we had for him. Some other good food options are the double bone in pork chop, the fried cheese curds (especially when they are hot) and the rib-eye steak holiday special.  And of course, their famous pazookie!!!"
Katie E.,"Clayton, CA",164,1,,3.0,1/9/2018,"I am writing this review in regards to a few of the past experiences I've had at this establishment. The issues with the customer service experience begin at the start of entering the restaurant. The very last time I went, we put in our name and number and were told to expect about a 20 minute wait. About 30 minutes went by and we decided to check and see where our name was on the list. They very clearly had no idea what we were talking about, and instead of admitting a possible mistake, they ignored us. I assumed they were just going to discuss with the waitress if there any availability so I sat down and waited. A few minutes later they took us to a table and gave us our menus. Now, the service to get our orders taken has been consistently unacceptable. It was 10 o'clock at night and the restaurant was only about a quarter full, yet it took 10 mins for the waitress to simply take our drink order, and about 45 mins for the food to arrive. Now, the exception I have is the food has always been phenomenal. I have ordered many different things off their wonderfully extensive menu and they all have been delicious as well as reasonably priced. It is why I keep coming back despite the poor customer service. After we finished our meals, our waitress was no where to be found, and all we wanted was our check. We didn't end up leaving the restaurant until midnight. My suggestions would be to give waitress smaller sections so they can dedicate more time to their tables. The food here is great and if you improve on your customer service and being more present/available to the customer, I would frequent this restaurant much more often."
AnaLeesa W.,"Vallejo, CA",0,20,3,4.0,12/8/2017,"Me and my friend came here on a Thursday night. Upon walking in we were greeted by the host who was strictly only offering the bar/cafe area, as if she didn't want to seat tables in actual sections. Not sure what that was all about but i requested a booth in a regular section. The party ahead of us had a confusion about bar seating too. But it all worked out after that.  Our server was busy but still managed to meet our every need. I had the tomato bisque and a cesar salad which were both very good. I also had the fried artichoke hearts and I wasn't wowed by them. They were just ok. I wish I would have got the Brussels sprouts instead. That will be something to try for next time. My friend had the brisket burger and an Alabama Sunset. The plate looked good for the price and the drink was pretty strong and had a really good taste. We ended our dinner with a mini monkey bread pizzookie and I have to say that it was the best part. Sooo good, and even the mini was just enough to share. I will be back here to try more menu items. Thank You BJ's"
Catherine R.,"Lincoln, CA",0,13,5,1.0,11/19/2017,"Really disappointed by tonight's visit.  30 minute wait turned out to be 45+.  Waitress took a very long time to come get orders.  5 out of 7 meals were incorrectly prepared.  Medium burgers were very well done.  Cheese missing.  One plate was 8 minutes later than the others.   I'm not a demanding diner.  But we just paid way too much for sub-par service, mediocre food and ridiculously long wait times."
Bree D.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",0,44,28,1.0,12/3/2017,"Absolute worst experience I've ever had. Went here on a Monday night, it was pretty slow. Our waitress showed up 12 minutes after being seated. When she finally showed up she said, ""Sorry, I completely forgot about you. They cut the floor tonight because we're short staffed"". I couldn't believe she told customers she forgot about them, horrible service.  We ordered our drinks, appetizer and dinner at once. The drinks didn't come out until the appetizer...and the ahi tuna appetizer was frozen!  I've been to other BJs locations and had a great experience, but this was by far the worst."
Renee F.,"Sacramento, CA",35,153,148,3.0,8/14/2017,"Typical chain restaurant atmosphere. This isn't the one I usually go to but I've been here 4 or 5 times. I've always had good service and even if a mistake is made it is quickly resolved. It's at the mall so it's usually packed, but in my experience the wait has never been more than 20 min. I recommend downloading the app and adding your name to the preferred waitlist or calling ahead to add your name, that helps a lot. The deep dish pizza is always good but now that I'm working to stay low carb these days I like the salmon, blackened. I don't like the broccoli here (this time around was my second time giving it a chance) but I love the asparagus. Next time around I'll be subbing double asparagus with my meal. I'm sure I'll be back. If you're meeting people on a weekend get there a little early to find a parking spot. Since Round One opened the area is more busy than it already was."
Ameera D.,"San Francisco, CA",101,117,390,5.0,11/2/2017,Favorite dishes: Avocado Rolls  White macadamia pizookie BBQ Chicken Pizza
Jonathan L.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",13,89,1,3.0,11/2/2017,"It was ok.  I came here for lunch with a few people, and the place was pretty empty.  The menu is literally 20 pages long.  The pages even have numbers on them.  To me, that is always a red flag, as a huge menu usually means a lot of stuff is premade and microwaved. Service was fine, it wasn't slow, though it was weird that we had to flag someone down for ketchup considering we had french fries.  Shouldn't it come automatically with ketchup? I had the prime rib dip sandwich.  It tasted ok, the meat was basically roast beef.  The au jus provided was salty but not much flavor.  It was a tad skimpy on the meat as about 1/4 of my sandwich didn't have any meat on it.  The fries were really good- skinny, had a nice crisp to them.  It was about $13-$14 so quite pricey.   Other people in my party had spaghetti (didn't look appetizing at all) and tacos (looked pretty good).   In the end, it wasn't bad though its a typical chain restaurant.  Basically a higher end, more expensive Applebees."
M K.,"Baltimore, MD",0,15,15,5.0,11/19/2017,"So sorry, but the food is too great to stop to take an image. Ladies and gentlemen if you haven't stumbled into this establishment as yet, you are not being as great as I know you can be.  The food was delicious and the service was fast for a late night food run, less than 10 minuets for hot food. The cooks are in the kitchen hitting those pots and pans hard to satisfy my appetite and they didn't disappoint.  Cheers!"
Kimberly C.,"Scranton, PA",30,24,27,2.0,11/13/2017,"Nooooope. They were so crowded and busy, and they did not handle the service well. They're menu is HUGE which provides the danger of not being able to keep up with the selections of doing each dish really well. We had a salad and deep dish pizza - both were under average. The deep dish wasn't baked long enough so it was ""doughy"". Also, there were not enough televisions to be able to watch sporting events for the size of building and people inside. Needless to say, we won't be returning."
Eddie C.,"Concord, CA",0,2,,1.0,1/1/2018,"I come to BJ's 1 time a week and I go thru take out . I'm sad to say that today customer service sucked ass. They said they were helping ""door dash"" but there was no door dash outside . The lady that was answering the phone kept hanging up on me & playin me on hold for 20 minutes. I waited outside for my order for about 25 mins . This is so ridiculous for 2 Pazookie's . Smh I am very disappointed with today's service . I don't recommend anyone to go thru take out or inside . Save money and go somewhere else . If I could give negative stars for today's situation I would do it in a heartbeat."
Kyshia M.,"Oakland, CA",493,261,215,5.0,12/30/2016,"How can you not like this place?  Full bar, tons of menu options and if you have room for a dessert, you better order a pizookie. Which is a cookie in pie form with ice cream!!!!  I absolutely love the brussels sprouts with sriracha sauce appetizer. Pizza is the primary thing I order from here and I've had no complaints. One of my fav's is the chicken alfredo pasta. AMAZING!!! As far as the pizookie, I get traditional chocolate chip with vanilla ice cream but if you're sharing, I recommend getting the 3 in 1. You can get 3 different cookie flavors for those who cannot decide on just one flavor.  The casual atmosphere is great for all ages, but kids cannot sit at the bar area. Can get really crowded on the weekends as it is attached to Sun Valley Mall."
Justin K.,"Chinatown, San Francisco, CA",4,71,39,4.0,11/1/2017,"Great food. Good atmosphere. Just one thing needs to be worked on. The Togo. There is never anyone to help when u just stand there waiting, and waiting.. BJS if you're reading this. You should have the to go person at the desk at all times"
Alicia A.,"El Sobrante, CA",16,11,1,2.0,11/4/2017,Don't sit at the bar!!! I've never had fruit flies rest on my check ...  good beer but the bar is clearly not being cleaned properly
Francis K.,"Martinez, CA",158,15,1,1.0,12/19/2017,Just really disappointed. My birthday dessert never came out.  I left after waiting for 30 minutes. what was really upsetting that the people next to us who got there 30 minutes after us got there dessert and we never did. There's nothing else I can say but really disappointed.  ------- I called in response to Mr Mangan's kind response and ended up on BJs looping phone messaging system. No one picked up at 11 am.  Consistency is sometimes not a virtue.
La Tanya J.,"Indio, CA",119,46,5,2.0,12/18/2017,"This was by far my worst experience  here i keep giving them a chance not anymore. My order was wrong twice tried to serve me something i said i was deathly  allergic to, then had attitude  because  i refused a remake.  You could tell the waitress was fake and indeifferent with the poor service like she didnt care."
Kristin V.,"Hollywood, FL",57,61,52,1.0,6/12/2017,"What a disaster!! Horrible service, horrible mgt, worst experience. Food is always good and comes out on time though, (must give them their credit in the back).We were given 3 diff servers since they couldn't get it together. In fact the entire patio also had 3 diff servers! Oh, also out of every Cabernet! Managements fault for not properly training! The servers/staff are a direct reflection of mgmt! Period. The hostess and 90% of servers need to be fired! Save your sanity and don't waster your time here.  Will never come back -"
Sabrina J.,"Fairfield, CA",94,123,652,3.0,10/30/2016,"BJ's usually leaves me disappointed, but today's visit was actually pretty good. Of course everyone and their mom was here watching the Raiders play, blah!, but luckily the wait was only 10-15 minutes.   It took quite a while for anyone to greet us and asks for our drink orders, I'd say a good 5-10 minutes went by and in my opinion, that is way toooooo long to wait to be greeted.  When Taylor finally came by we ordered a white peach margarita and berry burst cider, both were absolutely refreshing and DELICIOUS! My friend ordered the tacos, which she thought were pretty tasty and I chose the blackened salmon with veggies and mashed potatoes. I was so surprised with how flavorful the salmon was and it was perfectly cooked and flakey! There was a nice butter sauce on top which really just made it super bomb! We of course finished lunch off with a chocolate chip pazookie, which was BOMB! How the heck do they make them so darn good?! Our server Taylor must have been busy because she didn't check on us at all. Pretty much once the food arrived, she vanished. My friend and I were pretty busy chopping it up but it would have been nice if Taylor had checked in once or twice.  Overall service was MEH, but the food was really good and of course I had great company!"
April M.,"Albany, CA",38,26,1345,4.0,10/7/2017,The chocolate chip pizookie is great! So are the Nashville hot wings! The sriracha queso with chili is amazing! And our server Isaac O. was awesome!
David F.,"Concord, CA",53,372,1592,3.0,12/11/2016,"Stopped by recently on a late Friday afternoon after catching a movie in Pleasant Hill. I had been anxious to try the Concord BJ's clam chowder as the same dish in the San Rafael BJ's had been fantastic. When we got there we were seated immediately as there were plenty of open tables, more people being in the bar area. But the restaurant quickly filled up and by 6:15 it was packed and hopping. One thing we were surprised by was the lack of Holiday decorations, this being early December. A handful of poinsettias scattered around was the sole nod to the season. My order of the clam chowder in a sourdough bowl was as good as I remembered it. The chowder was excellent, and if possible, the bread was even better - freshly baked sourdough worthy of a meal unto itself! My wife had the Vegetarian Pita Tacos, and although the pita was excellent, the meal itself was too oniony. For dessert we decided to try their ""world-famous"" pizookie, which is a freshly baked cookie in a miniature round pizza tin, topped by ice cream and sauce. Not cheap at seven dollars, so we split the triple chocolate pizookie. We were somewhat disappointed by this world-famous dessert. The cookie was good, not great, and the chocolate ice cream was nothing special, tasting like grocery store ice cream.  The sauce, from Ghirardelli chocolate, was the high point. While we were eating a couple of large groups were seated in our area, and our server was tasked with the table of 12. Alas, that was the last we saw of him, and after a long wait we finally flagged down someone to get the bill, and after another wait, finally snagged someone else to take our card. That was a little annoying, and made me realize I would never want to come here prior to a Friday night event where I had to be somewhere at a given time. Although my meal was excellent, five stars, my wife's meal, the dessert, and the long wait at the end knocks Concord BJ's down a couple stars unfortunately."
Elijah B.,"Martinez, CA",200,362,440,3.0,6/11/2017,"This place is always a good place to go IF you have a small party (less than 5), and the service is adequate enough to get you by.  Service when it is busy, slow, or in between, is usually always, the same, which is odd to me. Doesn't matter what time of day or how busy it is, the service is usually the same, in terms of time. The food comes out a bit slow, but if you're at the open bar, it is a bit faster. I recommend the open bar do to the fact that you can get seated faster.  The happy hours are clutch, and so are the BOGO meals (offered every so often). I do not mind coming here and always treated fairly well, but I do not get exceptional service of anything like that."
Sarah L.,"Rodeo, CA",53,185,630,3.0,10/30/2016,"Second time. Food is expensive and its an ok food. I think i like Lazy Dogg more.  Service is also slow. Our server didn't check up in us, i had to ask another server.  I like the Peach Margarita. Well mixed, really good. It didn't taste like cough syrup.  Happy hour is expensive.  You inly get $2 off of the shareable appetizers, which are ranging from $11 and above. Drinks are expensive too."
Anthony W.,"Benicia, CA",87,105,310,3.0,11/17/2016,Hmmmm...BJs eh... My girlfriend brought me lunch from here for take out. It wasn't bad! Had the BBQ bison burger. Normally I need to always have cheese on my burger but this was a tasty exception. I've had brunch here at the one in Sac and it was reallllllly good! I need try this place out more!  I will be back!
