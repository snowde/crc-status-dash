Kirk S.,"Eureka, CA",115,116,42,3.0,3/21/2015,"You call this shit #deepdish? Lol the entire Chicago metropolitan area is laughing and pointing at you BJ.  To be fair, it tastes really good but just because you cook it in a deep dish doesn't mean it is.   Also you gain and both lose a star for the root beer.  Props for the frosty mug.  This is the only proper way to serve root beer but it's not very good.  It's ok. Not great."
Kristin A.,"Lafayette, CA",86,110,564,5.0,6/19/2015,"My most recent visit to this location I ordered and Bloody Mary ($7.95) and the Classic Rib-Eye ($21.95). As usual, the Bloody Mary was absolutely delicious. My steak came with a choice of two sides, I chose a baked potato and brussel sprouts. I ordered my steak rare and boy did they deliver! most places totally fail at preparing my steak as rare as I like it, but BJs knows exactly how to prepare a rare steak! My friend also ordered a steak, she got hers medium rare and she said it was cooked perfectly too. For one of her sides she ordered the Fresh Mozzarella and Tomato Salad which I tried I couple bites of, it was pretty good, the onions were a tad overpowering in my opinion. Our server Mackenzie was really attentive and was so sweet about me asking for extra sour cream and chives for my baked potato twice. The first time she brought us steak-sauce, the bottle was pretty much empty and when we asked for another one, the second one was empty as well. We laughingly said screw it and ate our steaks without any steak-sauce and we actually didn't really need it. The steaks were so flavorful and juicy that I think that the steak-sauce would have taken away from that.  The steaks here are really great and priced really well. This will definitely continue to be my go-to spot when I am craving a well-priced, rare steak."
Tiffany D.,"Pittsburg, CA",85,75,47,1.0,1/17/2016,"Went in today to pick up my online order on my oh so perfectly timed break... walked in look to my left there's a group of black shirts talking about another customer at the hostess stand. I make eye contact and they all scurry away like ants... no acknowledgement of my presence but hey that's no problem! I know how it is when your at work! Anywho,  I stand waiting at the ""order pick up"" register to retrieve said online order that I can physically see eyeballing me from the back counter. My Santa Fe Chicken Salad is waiting for me and I'm waiting for it too.... The host dude is still standing there looking at his list of NO ONE on his clipboard... While im standing there, the phone in front of me rings, same host walks over, picks up the phone greets and places them on hold. I'm thinking ""yes! He's coming to help me pick up my food!""  Host places the receiver down and walks away... Mind you he's like 1 foot away. HE NEVER SAYS ANYTHING TO ME!  Should I have been one of those ""um, excuse me do you work here""  type of customers?  Appalled by the BASIC lack of customer engagement at the front of the house, I literally turned around and walked out. Thanks BJ'S you ruined my lunch break."
Titus F.,"Fairfield, CA",37,138,303,3.0,6/21/2015,"My lovely Queen and I decide to venture out and out our money card to good use. At first we went by the BJ's in Vacaville but decided for a change of scenery. With that, we ended up in Concord.  Since the crowd was bustling, we were given a buzzer for a 20-30min wait. W/in 25mins my hand was vibrating, alerting me that our table for two was ready.  Upon re-entry in the restaurant, we were happily greeted and quickly escorted. But for the rest of the service, it wasn't as quick. Our waitress did not come until a good 10mins passed. After ordering and receiving our drinks, we ordered the Crispy Calamari and our entrees: the NEW Deep Dish Spicy Hawaiian Chicken pizza and BJ's Favorite Deep Dish (check the pics). Once we had a bit of a wait to receive our main course.  Next time I'll do w/o the appetizer b/c it freaked me out a bit. Looked like fried squid and too rubbery...(shh, I found out after I ate most it that it's not fried fish!) In the end, the food was very enjoyable with tasty piña coladas. Service was a bit slow, but not too slow that the experience was a drag."
Lisa C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",250,285,366,2.0,1/25/2016,"The food menu can be a bit overwhelming. I love their appetizers, but when I ordered the avocado egg rolls they came out looking thrown onto the plate :/ The pizza was a but doughy. It is kid friendly with crayons and high chairs. They have very tasty shoestring fries for the kids at .95 cents it is a good deal, too. They also have kids cups. ODDLY our waitress brought us double what we ordered for the kids, she may have smoked a joint prior to her shift... I really like their beverage menu and famous pazookies. Unfortunately when I ordered mine it was touch and not ooey gooey chewy deliciousness I had hoped for. The small bites and salads loom healthy and tasty, with unique offerings. The stuffed mushrooms were delightful and packed with flavor, but again thrown onto the plate. They are big of flavor... However, we went when it was slow. Not busy at all, during the day...so I do not see why our meals were rushed and sloppily plated. I would like to make my way back there and give it a second chance. Parking is a bummer because of the mall, however it is convenient if you want to go shopping at the mall, anyways."
Emily L.,"Martinez, CA",0,2,,5.0,6/22/2017,"I don't know why there are so many reviews about bad customer service at this location. I come here with a group of friends one to two times a week on average because they're the best. The food is not only fantastic and whether they mess up and bring you the wrong plate or they find something in the food. Accidents happen and it's a food establishment........ and they DO care and will handle your situation timely and appropriately but it's very rare that they do mess up because they're great! The service I would say is a big reason why we all choose to come back every week. You not only want to try everything on the menu because it is reasonably priced and looks great, but the way they treat you and care about you as a person not only a customer is hard to come by! Once you walk in the door you're most likely greeted by Katie the hostess with a welcoming smile and a genuine hello. Her and the other hosts/hostesses do their best to seat you in a reasonable time frame depending on the night you're dining with them always keeping you updated on the status of your wait and you can see them making sure you are taken care of. She really welcomes you and makes you feel like your business is really appreciated and it's a nice beginning to your night out! Once you're seated if you get Hailey as a waitress you are SETTTTTTT for a great dinner. One of the BEST waitresses I would say that I've ever had the pleasure in being helped by. She too will kindly greet you with a genuine smile and ask you how you're doing. She always makes sure that you have drinks, your food and that you are doing great overall. She also really cares about you as a person, always keeping a smile on her face as she asks you about your day and what she can do to make your visit great. You can also see her working extremely hard on the floor waiting several tables on a busy night but she never neglects one table over the other, making sure everyone is taken care of. Super professional but also funny and fun to have as a waitress! And even if it is a busy night she'll always be super generous, helpful and informative to you and your table because she wants you to have a great experience. Incredible service, go in and request if she's there you won't regret it. If you get Mia as a waitress you're golden as well because she too always makes sure that you're not only handled in a timely fashion but she lets you know that you're appreciated and that even though she's waiting other tables, when she's with you, you are at the top of her priority list. She also really knows what she's talking about when it comes to questions on the menu or anything in general and she again like Hailey always makes sure that you above all are doing good and enjoying your time. She's also extremely patient, looking at their menu can be tough because everything looks so good and she will help you sort out your options and offer to wait as long as you need to make your decision. There's no rush or pressure when you're being helped by her she's just super nice, fun and respectful. Wonderful service as well, definitely would recommend her too! Gabby as well is another great, fast and a wonderful server to have! She too is informative, nice, friendly and cares about you and who you're with making sure that you're not waiting too long and that you're always happy with your meal and your time in the restaurant. They're all so great at what they do, and make the experience of coming here so much more fun and overall better!  I have always had extremely positive and great experiences when I come here and I truly look forward to it every week as it has become a weekly meeting spot for my friends and I to come out on the days they have great deals which is basically everyday, seriously get out there and look them up, you will be there every week too they're so great. The service is wonderful and again is what makes us want to come back and look forward to returning week after week. They may have a few servers that are not as great, but that's what really makes you value your time with the hosts, hostesses, waiters and waitresses who are above and beyond at their job! Also if there ever is an issue remember that people make mistakes and that it's a food business where nobody is always perfect and they do handle any complaint or dissatisfaction timely and are truly sorry and offer you something in return to make sure again that YOU are happy. They're all human, cut a little slack on the harsh reviews, they do a fantastic job at this establishment. Go in and check them out!"
Annalisia A.,"Pittsburg, CA",0,11,2,1.0,5/22/2017,"Came in last night for a pizooki to go. Arrived to curb side and waited 10 minutes, after no  one came outside I called the front desk and told them I was at curb side for a take out order. I was told  someone would be right with me. After another 10 minutes my boyfriend went inside to get the order. When he arrived the pizooki was not ready. After another 10 minutes my boyfriend got the food but their were no utensils or whip cream as we had asked for on the online order. When asked for it the hostess laughed and on her way back from grabbing the whip cream she dropped the food on the floor and continued to laugh. Awful customer service."
Pia A.,"Rodeo, CA",84,7,9,1.0,4/30/2017,"First time coming to this place and I went during lunch with my family. The food was good, very yummy, I ordered the Fresh Atlantic Salmon and it was delicious, perfectly cooked, my mom ordered the Peruvian Quinoa Salad with Salmon as well and it was also good. Food wise it was pretty spot on, my only problem with this place is the service. Our first server was a gentleman, very nice and patient, and we were a big party of more than twelve, with some seniors and rowdy children. I applaud him for his outstanding patience. It was the other server, a young woman who was very rude and just utterly horrible to us that ruined a perfectly good Sunday lunch. She raised her voice while addressing some of our desserts and just was a totally horrible server, with an equally repulsive attitude. If I'm not mistaken her name was Justine. She completely dampened the mood. Hopefully management will be able to address such rude servers, it's bad for business. I will comeback again, hopefully, but maybe not to this location, I like to enjoy my meals in a pleasant mood, with pleasant accomodating, and POLITE servers."
Susan P.,"Yuba City, CA",5,6,,1.0,6/12/2017,"I brought my friend to the restaurant to enjoy a good meal.  I have been, happily, to many BJ's including Natomas, CA,  Sacramento, CA, Santa Rosa, CA (many times) etc...  The Concord BJ's was a huge disappointment.  The lite plate salmon came on a bed of woody asparagus (no removal of woody bottoms) and the salmon was lacking in sauce.  Our server brought our drinks and we never saw him again for refills or any other aspect of service.  I had to ask for the bill 3 times from other servers and after a good bit of time (10 minutes) the manager came and said that the meal was ""on the house"".  I did appreciate this but would have much preferred a good meal with adequate service.  Apparently, BJ's has not reviewed their reviews because this seems to be a chronic problem."
Janice J.,"Concord, CA",134,26,47,3.0,3/23/2016,"3/22/16 came here randomly at around 9 on a Tuesday. The restaurant wasn't busy and we got a table after a couple minutes of entering. We ordered: ravioli, Siracha chicken bacon Mac n cheese, jambalaya and spicy Hawaiian deep dish pizza.  The ravioli was good, the cheese was delicious and I would definitely order it again. The Siracha chicken bacon Mac n cheese wasn't that great. It was a new dish of theirs. It wasn't really Mac n cheese used penne noodles, sauce was watery and there was no spiciness to it. It was just edible. Jambalaya was great. It was spicy, salty and just fulfilling. I don't mind the saltiness but my uncle didn't like it said it was too salty.  The spicy Hawaiian deep dish pizza was okay. It wasn't spicy, had jalapeños on it to make it spicy and the sauce on it...what sauce? I hardly tasted any sauce. It wasn't really a deep dish pizza if you know what I mean? It was just deep because of the thick dough. Idk I guess I'm used to Chicago deep dish pizza. I wish we had ordered a different kind but my uncles friend doesn't like pepperoni!?!?! Whatever. The waiter was friendly, he did his job well.  Honestly didn't even feel like going out to eat but my sister made me. It was just one of those nights where you enter the restaurant, order, eat, talk a little, pay and then leave. So nothing really special."
Danika Z.,"Walnut Creek, CA",311,101,14,5.0,9/13/2016,By far the best bjs I have been too. Our waiter Geoffrey was so attentive and prompt. Brought my bf to bjs .  It was his first time at bjs and he love it and very impressed with both the service and food.
Paul S.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",2,26,6,2.0,10/25/2016,"Sub par food and service, the pizokie and tvs at the bar are the only things that keep this place going"
Lauren B.,"Concord, CA",0,4,,1.0,7/16/2016,"I don't ever write negative reviews, really. But this...was a terrible experience. We put our name down for 12 people at 6:30 and they said 20-30 mins. That's fine. They told us at 7:15 that they were waiting for one table to leave, ok! Then at 7:30 they sat a table for 16 people who arrived half an hour after us. A hostess came up to us saying that the other group had made a reservation and needed to be seated...and that it would be around another 45 mins. for us to be seated. We ended up leaving rather than wait another 45 mins, which would make our 20-30 min. estimated wait turn into almost 2 hours. I don't think any of us will be returning to this location- that was the most ridiculous experience I've ever had at any restaurant!"
Jay G.,"Clayton, CA",1,24,,4.0,12/5/2016,"BJ's is a great place to eat casual dinners. You can sample the starters and the side dishes and come away completely satisfied without even ordering an entrée. The beer selection is very good, with both in-house and other common beers from which to chose.  We usually head to the bar area where the tables are first-come available. There are probably 10 TV moniters spaced throughout the restaurant. The sound quality is very good, easy to carry on a conversation without shouting. There seem to be several wait staffers, but the bar area always has too few, so these poor girls are running all night just trying to keep up. If the kitchen misses something (like sauce for the wings), you will wait quite a while for the waters to cycle back to you. Empty beer glasses sit for a long time before you are offered another one.  All that, but the food is very good, dependable everytime we re-visit. Great variety, so everyone gets their choices."
Kim P.,"San Francisco, CA",62,9,3,1.0,10/12/2016,"Just had the worst experience at BJs. This isn't the first time the food has been sub-par and served luke warm or cold. We went there for lunch and ordered an appetizer which hadn't been delivered after 25 minutes. Let manager know we were still waiting and about 5 minutes later we finally got our appetizer. After being there almost 50 minutes, 1 person at our table got their food which was soup and salad. The caesar salad was really pathetic looking, the soup was COLD. Went to manager again and told him soup was cold. After this, no one else received their food, so we told manager we were leaving. On our way out, one of the waitresses made a rude comment that we didn't know how to behave in public.... WHAT? Again, we had to inform manager on the way out what the waitress said to us. Since when is poor service and cold food not a reason to complain? NEVER going back again."
Sandy H.,"Antioch, CA",43,95,151,1.0,11/22/2016,Veggies were under cooked. My daughter stared at her salad for 10 mins until they gave her a fork finally. Services was bad. They need to work on their service at this location. They need to take pointers from the Brentwood location which is amazing.
Jr A.,"Suisun City, CA",0,5,,2.0,4/29/2017,slow service but one of mangers he cool tho gave us free pizookie he real one...our servers took so long to give us our food and check not really happy I had to wait so long :(
IshaqSana S.,"Hercules, CA",0,8,3,5.0,4/4/2016,"Give this place a 5 star the staff was very nice everyone knew what they where doing (unlike other places some ppl seem a bit lost) and very friendly, i loved the dessert menu amazing especially the strawberry beganet! and our food was delicious"
Flavia C.,"Fremont, CA",9,8,3,1.0,9/18/2016,"If I could give negative stars, I would. This place is terrible. Their service sucks... Took over 30 mins for our food to arrive."
Y. C.,"Oakland, CA",36,73,117,2.0,9/4/2016,Arrived and was texted to be seated...cool service...took our seats and its 30 minutes later and  no drinks or foodit's an iceberg in here and if I would have read the reviews I would have gone to In and Out! 45 minutes and counting  pizzas just arrived... No plates no salad.. Salad arrived 5 minutes after the pizza ...Spoke with manager ... Did I mention the salad and pizza work appetizers? Food was comped by the manager.  Waitress was sweet ...
