Andy B.,"Vallejo, CA",20,244,55,5.0,4/25/2016,"I had the Ham & Cheese melt and the twisted BLT salad. My mom had the Personal 1-topping Pizza...I read enjoyed my lunch and so did mom.  The service wasn't awesome but it was Sunday lunch and they had just opened an hour before.  I will come here again and try other things as time wears merrily forward... All I can say bad about it is that they apparently have a psychotic OCD janitor who buffs the floor to an insane surface daily.  I would advise you wear non-slip soles if you dare to eat here. Seriously, wtf? I think the floors were cleaner than my tabletop.  But the food was pretty dang delicious."
Giorgio T.,"Concord, CA",0,28,1,3.0,3/25/2017,"So I go to this place very often, and the food is HELLA GOOD!!! I usually get the avocado rolls as an appetizer because they are so damn amazing.. as for the entrees I think they all hit the spot quite well. Love the soup and salad combos, the beer selection is pretty nice and the fancy drinks are just ok. (Light on the alcohol) I give it three stars because the service is pretty bad. Yes, the people are nice... but that just doesn't do it for me. Seems like they have new servers every time I go, but thats fine. They always forget napkins/utensils, I have to ask twice for water, and its hard to catch a server to ask for little things. (Such as ranch or sauce etc). Overall i still go to this spot because it simply does the job and its pretty alive, just wish the little things were there at the beginning."
pam w.,"Concord, CA",1,22,12,2.0,7/23/2016,Service was good. Beer selection is outstanding and served at the proper temperature for each variety. My issue is one star for food. I ordered the lunch salmon on quinoa without peppers. It has asparagus and mushrooms.  OMG NOT A SINGLE ASPARAGUS TIP!  All tough stalk end pieces.  All of it. Ridiculous. Tried posting a photo...didn't post for some reason.
Max B.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,1,,2.0,8/15/2017,The Dennys down the street has better service. I went here three times in the last month. The first time our server barely talked to us and actually gave us plastic spoons for our pizzokies. The second time our server left part way through and we didn't really get a replacement server to finish our orders. The final time (tonight) I met my friends here and for the entire 20 minutes I was here no one talked to my table. I also asked a server if someone could come over to our table and she later walked by our table a few times so we eventually walked out.
Pamela Marie B.,"Hercules, CA",0,1,,5.0,11/1/2017,Douglas was so friendly and considerate with my visit today at this Bj's location. This location is one of the best!
Simr P.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,1,,5.0,7/22/2017,I love BJs  if there is more stars    then five I would give them. Everything if super nice. Thank you all staff of BJs to make our evening beautiful.
Christina M.,"Hercules, CA",72,407,341,3.0,10/26/2015,I do like this place for the variety of food they have here and even the low calorie options they carry.  Sometimes the service is a hit or a miss here depending on where you sit and what time of the day you come in.  I came here last Saturday and decided to sit in the booth area by the bar so that my boyfriend could watch all the games going on.  The food was definitely fast and delicious but our server at the time was just whatever.  I feel like she only came by to take our order and then drop our food off.  She didn't bother to stop by to check up on us and a couple of times we actually had to wave her down so we can order more beer.   Food is good with plenty to choose from. Service needs a lot of work.
Ray R.,"Fairfield, CA",5,34,,4.0,2/11/2017,"I have a problem focusing on the negative and really my negative could be your positive. Here's my experience.... I went with my family for lunch along with my two little ones. It was at lunch time so a wait was to be expected. We seated ourselves at the only available booth in the bar area, unfortunately it hadn't been cleaned and there was no bus persons available to clean our table, apparently someone called in sick. after about 15 minutes  of waiting we went to the host to see if a table was available.  After  being seated we experienced great service especially because children can be challenging. My only issue was the place wasn't really the best setting for small children, it has more of a sports bar feel. We enjoyed our meal and liked the fact that they have a great selection of beer.  Because of its popularity, it is well worth the wait!"
My Two Cents C.,"Los Angeles, CA",211,31,1,2.0,11/5/2016,"First and maybe last time. I had to call 3 times as the first 2 times I was on hold for over 5 minutes each. When you're on a silent hold, that is a long time for a customer. After finally getting through, I placed a curbside order as I was not ""public"" ready. 1-I had to call and let them know I was there after waiting close to 10 minutes past my quoted time. He offered for me to come grab it, but that was not going to happen.  2-He brings our order and comes without change on him. One would think they could come prepared to make the transaction smooth and quick.  3-I was about to walk in when I realize 1 order is wrong, but he came out. Without an apology for the incorrect order, he goes back to fix it.  4-Now my ice cream is melted and one person will have to reheat their food.  Food is ok, but reheating could have been the issue. Curbside is a joke and took 20-30 minutes. I choose curbside thinking it would be quick and I was being lazy. Won't make that mistake again."
Stacey L.,"El Sobrante, CA",0,4,14,5.0,3/5/2017,Douglas Mezquita GM was very nice. Service was great fast and friendly will be dinning here again with friends and family.
Nat B.,"Concord, CA",195,51,3,3.0,10/27/2016,So BJ's food is nothing if not consistent. We usually don't come because the servers are all young and seem over worked. their call ahead is a joke and whats the worst part?? calling in a curbside pick up. i did this and still had to wait 40 min after i arrived to get my food! i could have walked in and ordered togo and still got home to feed HUNGRY kids before my order i made way in advance.
Kimberly C.,"El Sobrante, CA",405,49,2,1.0,5/7/2016,"Ordered the Santa  Fe Salad!  It came to me in the most sloppiest form without the Avocado!  The calamari was not crisp in fresh oil, also sloppy with pieces in the sauce.  Feeling a little nausea from my not eaten meals!  Had to order the chicken as a replacement and it was not good at all!, so I didn't eat it as well!  Going home to get some real food.  Wow!   No cauliflower appetizers? Just went to the one in Sacramento whereas I had salad and cauliflower and the food quality and presentation was excellent! This BJs needs to take lessons from the Sacramento location!"
Shana E.,"Marietta, GA",26,23,12,2.0,4/17/2017,Probably the most saturated grease I have ever had in lettuce wraps.   Too bad I was excited. Good drink.
Fatima O.,"San Francisco, CA",8,28,8,1.0,6/21/2017,"Avoid this place unless you want crappy service and hair in your burger. Granted they took it off the tab and offered to make a new burger but I declined. I was about half way through my burger and a long stringy hair came out of the burger. Ruined my appetite. Not sure if the servers are new or they just don't care but they forgot drink orders and forgot to include an appetizer. The only thing they can get right is the beer, unless they're out which has happened before."
Monica T.,"Martinez, CA",0,2,,1.0,8/3/2017,"We probably should have gone somewhere else to eat. Really bad service, probably the worst I've ever had. I understand it was busy, but from the time we sat down and ordered it took 1 HOUR to get our food. When we did finally get it, our Mozzarella sticks were cold and tasteless and our wings were tasteless too. Also our server never came to refill our water, actually just never checked on us except to ask for dessert; which we declined because we didn't want to wait another hour, and to give us the check :/ I really wish it was just a bad day, but this will not be my first choice in restaurant."
Kathy B.,"Benicia, CA",214,126,381,3.0,4/17/2016,"They have a variety of food, drinks, appetizers and plenty of TV!  I would only rate this place a 3 because the food is just okay for me.   Came here on a Saturday night and there was a long wait so we sat on the bar area instead and its first come first serve. Make sure to make reservations if you have a large group."
Jeannie T.,"Oakland, CA",90,226,913,3.0,7/6/2015,"I used to love to come to BJ's but my most recent experience here was lacking. The service was great and our server, MacKenzie, was extremely helpful, but the food didn't wow me like it usually does. I'm not much of a drinker period so I asked our server which one she recommended. She steered me towards the Tickle Me Pink which I ended up ordering, but once I tried it, I really did not like it. MacKenzie was a doll and offered to take it off the menu in exchange for a different drink. I took her offer and ordered BJ's berry burst cider, which tasted so much better. I'd definitely recommend it. It's light and sweet but decent enough for someone like me with a really low tolerance to drink.  In terms of food, our group ordered the chicken wings in spicy and Parmesan, avocado egg rolls, fries, and the flatbread to share. I have nothing bad to say about the appetizers except that the avocado egg rolls are executed better at CPK and the Cheesecake Factory.  For my entree, I ordered the Asian chicken salad. The salad looked really pretty and tasted good. I ate the whole thing, but then again, I really love salads. My boyfriend ordered the mahi mahi. The couscous was cooked well, but the fish was tough and overcooked. At first, the tomato sauce paired well with the fish and couscous but the more you ate it, the acidity from the tomatoes became too much and it started to taste like the acidic bile from when you throw up. Pretty gross. Also, my friends ordered the shrimp scampi and the bison burger. According to them, the shrimp scampi was too dry with very little sauce and the bison burger was overcooked. The only thing that tasted good was the pizza.  Lastly, the pazookie is always good. We ordered the pazookie trio with chocolate chunk, white chocolate macadamia, and cookies n cream. All were yummy. No complaints there.  Overall, the appetizers were better than the entrees."
Heather C.,"Concord, CA",0,1,,5.0,7/5/2017,"Great service, a table for 2 on a Saturday night and got seated real fast. Our waiter Diana V. had the best service! Like she knew when we needed her lol.  Wait time for our food, perfect. Our food and drinks, great Will be going back real soon."
Albina I.,"West Hollywood, CA",6,15,7,1.0,12/16/2016,"Ahi tuna was the worst I ever had.. unfortunately They have tea, but they don't have sugar. Silverware was dirty.."
Spencer M.,"Vallejo, CA",0,9,,1.0,1/16/2017,"Always terrible, they have messed up our to go order EVERY SINGLE TIME. Tried to give them another chance today:  Phone rings, press 1 for take out but always goes to front desk who then sounds confused that I am asking for take-out. I am told I am being transferred, the phone rings a few times and I get hung up on. I call back, woman says she's so sorry but she doesn't know where the take-out person is, she said she will go physically find them but, ""it might take a while."" Normally, I wouldn't mind but I am completely done with the crew at this BJ's. If you can't even find your take-out person, I have no doubt you're going to mess up the order once again. I have ordered the pulled pork sandwich several times and every time I get just bread and meat, no sauce or sides. I have tried to order a simple pepperoni and seasoned tomato pizza and have gotten everything from extreme pepperoni to chicken/artichoke.  I've also waited hours for a table and have had some of the worst waiters I've ever come across here. Funny thing is management seems to care because the one or two times I or someone in my group has complained they pull out all the stops to make it right. Just get it right and there will be nothing to fix."
