Kate G.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",6,24,,1.0,9/2/2016,"Do not come here if you are hungry. Do not come here if you want any sort of quality food. Do not come here if you expect any sort of care from the chefs preparing your meal. The sad fact is that they don't care about any of these things, but will take your time and money and leave you with un-edible, subpar food. We ordered a classic burger that was so black, it didn't even resemble meat of any kind.  Nor did the lettuce they put on top that was so brown and wilted.  House sirloin steak was literally about 2 1/2 inches in size and thought it must be either a joke or a child's portion.  The asparagus that came with it was so overcooked, the poor stalks were limp and bent over.  And don't even get me started on the chicken club sandwich, that was neither recognizable as chicken or a sandwich. Dry, stale, rubbery chicken, with none of the avocado or cheese it was promised, but did include more of the brown and wilted lettuce, because we just didn't get enough the first time on our burger. It is so completely disgraceful to treat food in this despicable manner, and these chefs should be ashamed of themselves. If I were BJ's management, I would take a serious look at these reviews, and do something about these incompetent chefs. Have ordered take-out from here for the very last time."
Paola E.,"Concord, CA",5,1,,5.0,7/20/2017,"I went to BJs with my family and had an overall good experience. Douglas the manager was so kind to us. Our food took a long time to come. We asked to speak to the manager and Douglas came he was very kind he apologized and got our food out right away. The food was delicious. We will definitely return the menu is very varied, the drinks very good, the atmosphere very good the manager's service excellent."
Jairus M.,"Daly City, CA",13,24,21,1.0,8/30/2016,1: Didn't give us utensils.  2: Forgot my daughters drink.  3: Waited a long time for my drink.  Service was horrible. Our surrounding tables were also complaining. We tried to give this place another shot but was let down yet again. I do not think we'll be coming back here again.
Christine K.,"El Sobrante, CA",146,54,49,4.0,3/6/2016,"I love coming to this BJ's. I come here whenever I can, and this has become my boyfriend and I's ""spot"" to go for a fun date night.  I typically get the Parmesan crusted chicken, it's amazing. one of my favorite dishes and always made perfectly. I've tried other dishes including the jambalaya, ziti, steak, and burgers. I've honestly never been dissatisfied with this place. with my experience, I've never had to wait a long time for food. the call in ahead 30 min in advanced option is actually pretty convenient. my boyfriend and I will shop in the mall, and call when we are almost ready. a major perk to the location is the mall, so if you have to wait for a table walking around the mall is a great time killer!  although some other people have had bad experiences here, I'm glad I never have. I'm definitely a reoccurring customer and always enjoy my meal. one of the best things about BJ's is the pizzokies, I love the Oreo one!  all in all I love this BJ's and will continue to go for many more years. I highly recommend this place to anyone in the concord area or shoppers at Sunvalley!"
David C.,"Concord, CA",0,15,4,1.0,6/21/2017,"When we checked in at the desk we were told we could sit immediately at a table or wait 15 minutes for a booth.  We waited for the booth.  When we were escorted to our booth there were five other vacant booths and five vacant tables (most of the tables and some of the booths had not been cleared of dishes and food yet).  The booth we were brought to had food all over the floor which we did not want to step in while eating our meal.  We showed it to person seating us and she said she would clean it up.  After 5 minutes standing and waiting she showed up with a broom and dustpan and swept the floor.  Then I showed her the table next to us had food and a rib bone on the floor - she shrugged her head and walked away without cleaning it up.  Gee, I wonder what the kitchen looks like :("
Christina B.,"Oakland, CA",68,57,79,3.0,4/17/2016,"Service was cool, menu selection is awesome. However our food selections were not the best...I ordered the Deep Dish Ravioli and it was hella dry (had to ask for more sauce). We liked the calamari.  The Honey Sriracha Brussel sprouts were pretty yummie  (they looked burnt, and the sauce was on the bottom, but I liked them). My friend ordered the Spicy Hawaiian deep dish pizza, it was also dry (she returned it). The Hickory Brisket Burger was   -we all should hace just ordered that. Lol The chicken Alfredo baked potato and tortilla soup looked really good and my friend enjoyed it.  I would go back, but would definitely order something different."
Joseph V.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,21,12,3.0,7/8/2017,Visited for dinner snack...waitess was very busy and when order came in...was not complete. Manager was nice enough to discount the meal 2.00 Dissappointed on service and meal was not same had it been served correctly. Might give em another chance. Ty J
Bianca B.,"Belmont, CA",2,5,,5.0,5/7/2017,"First time coming to this BJ's. Unfortunately all 3 of our orders were wrong. The waitress was very apologetic, the manager (Douglas) came to our table as well and apologized and offered free desert. We received our order at different times but the food was very delicious and we were under the impression that desert was going to be no charge, but once we received our bill all of our meals were free. Even though our order was messed up and we all ate at different times the staff handled the situation promptly and professional. Thanks again to Douglas, we'll definitely be coming back."
Viclaire S.,"Fairfield, CA",266,342,1916,3.0,3/18/2016,"Nothing truly special about this place. If you ever been to a bj's its exactly the same everywhere. Food ok, beer ok, service hit or miss. We frequent this Bjs as it is centralized from our work office. We typically host large work lunches here. Sometimes getting awesome service, most times receiving ok service. I will say for the last experience we had, I called in the same day for a party of 12 and Rebecca answered and accommodated us right at 12:30 pm. She did not hesitate and welcomed us."
Yee W.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",21,187,151,3.0,1/21/2016,"Came here for a late lunch. Took about 5 minutes to get seated. It was pretty quiet. Sat in a booth, it was very comfortable, but still had crumbs of food from previous guests. Our server wasn't that friendly. Didn't catch his name either. Ordered Mac & Cheese, French fries and Apple juice for our son. The Mac and cheese seemed old and the cheese wasn't cheesy, kinda dried. I had the root beer BBQ ribs with slaw, but replaced the slaw with mash potatoes instead. Both tasted great! The BBQ sauce was flavorful, I mixed my mash potatoes with it. We also ordered the three trio for dessert. It was really good too. Too bad the cookies were damnear stuck on the pan & wouldn't scoop out."
Danielle C.,"Long Beach, CA",191,4,5,1.0,12/17/2016,"I normally love BJs which makes this so disappointing.  We were seated and 45 minutes goes by and the waiter NEVER came to our table. We never even got water!! Meanwhile we had servers keep passing our table, making eye contact with us but not once even asking if everything was okay. We ended just leaving without even ordering. I don't ever want to go back to this location."
Emily T.,"Concord, CA",93,1,,2.0,2/26/2017,"Greeted and was sat quickly, to be left unnoticed at our table for roughly twenty minutes. No drinks, not even water. There was a group of servers in the corner by their staging area chatting about. There were only 5 tables being served, granted one was a large party, with us being sat DIRECTLY next to said party with 3 employees passing us each time they came to that table, menus closed waiting patiently. Michelle greated asking if we had been helped already and then took our entire order. Entrees came out a few minutes before salads. All the food was delicious and worth the wait. But the wait staff left us thinking take out may be the better option next time!"
stephanie w.,"Oakland, CA",1,19,,1.0,4/17/2017,"Worst place ever to eat at. Waited for f***king 30min for my dish and it arrived. Then they're going to lie saying ""oh your dish is taking longer than expected"" when in reality, they forgot. And it's on a Monday evening where it's raining so they're not busy at all."
Déna M.,"Walnut Creek, CA",118,14,1,3.0,8/12/2016,"The reason I give this restaurant 3 stars is for the following reasons:  - the food was good but nothing special  - our server was very nice but trying way too hard for a large tip - my party of 7 rolled in at around 8 pm, we were told it would be a 35-40 min wait. We were waiting for an hour and a half - the AC was blasting, we were chilling while waiting for our food and throughout dinner. I took a look around and at other tables people were looking chilly as well - and last but not least, the dim lighting made it hard to read he menu, the mood they were trying to set was not accomplished.  Let's just say, I wouldn't suggest this place if me and my friends were to go out; but it wasn't horrible."
Christina C.,"Antioch, CA",1,11,2,5.0,10/16/2016,Last night I came to this location and was very disappointed at first because the 30 minutes turned into over one hour 20 minutes. I could've gone anywhere else.  I want to thank the Manager for his concern and my server Jamez for making the experience very enjoyable after all! Jamez was awesome and very attentive!  I will definitely be back to this location
Shannon A.,"Scottsdale, AZ",83,13,9,2.0,12/7/2016,"We have been here two nights in a row (out of towners) and we have sat in the same section both nights and the wait staff was mediocre. For example, one of the guys we were with did not get the burger he ordered and everyone's beer glass ended up empty without asking if we wanted anything else.  The food was decent, recommend the mahi tacos! And, of course, there is a good selection of beer."
Stephanie M.,"Walnut Creek, CA",32,36,43,1.0,10/8/2016,Terrible service. We sat at the bar high top tables and waited for a few minutes for the waiter to set us up. Another 5-8 min later he took our drink and appetizer order. Another ten minutes goes by and a girl comes by to take our order to which we explained we ordered and she says sorry what did you order? So we told her. Shortly our drinks and appetizer comes out. We finish and sit. Our waiter still hasn't come by to check on us or take our lunch order. I see him walk by reach out to him and ask can we place our lunch order. His reply. YUP By time we finish lunch and I have to catch him again to get the dang check it's been an hour and 40 minutes. Trust me it reflected in his tip.
Jessica M.,"Richmond, CA",0,15,7,1.0,5/19/2017,Usually good but today the kitchen couldn't get it right. We're regulars but today I had to keep asking for extra this and extra that. Drinks were watered down. Salad had barely any dressing. Sriracha brussels sprouts had no sriracha sauce on it. Server was nice though but the kitchen was just very disappointing today. Maybe there's new chefs in the kitchen. Not sure. Not coming back for a while
Angelia C.,"Vacaville, CA",262,21,2,1.0,11/15/2015,"I went to BJ's last night with my family even though we already know how crappy it is due to past experiences.... And Because el tapatio closed at 9 and Lucille's has their own problems... Anyways we go in to get seated and of course there's like 15 empty tables but we have to wait to be seated... We get seated and we have a nice waitress who brings us our drinks and appetizer. The appetizer was calamari and it was okay, not exactly fresh. My parents ordered some beers and it took hella long to get them. We get our food and everything is okay until I try my Mac and cheese. I realize it had a weird taste of cheese.... Kind of like NACHO CHEESE. What the fuck??? I have noodles with fucking nacho cheese?? What the actual fuck man...  If you look at the picture you can see the little spices that are usually seen in NACHO CHEESE, the CHEESE YOU EAT WITH NACHOS AND NOTHING ELSE. Also, I ordered their bacon Mac and cheese and had no bacon on my plate, so they brought me a cup of bacon... In which I found a hair!! The my parents ordered two more beers and it took over 30 minutes to receive them. And we also asked for ketchup 3 times and instead had to have my boy Friend look around and find a ketchup.  Needless to say this place was not packed at all... And every other table was receiving the same service. Ridiculous. Do not eat here. The manger came up and offered to take the Mac and cheese off the check which is good... But looked at me dumb when I told him it was Nacho Cheese. Everyone at the table who tried it said it was nacho cheese... I'm so appalled because Mac and cheese is my favorite and I have never been disappointed by it :( until now. I've had a pleasant experience at the Brentwood location if you really need to eat at BJ's. They had real Mac and cheese there!"
starlight x.,"Vallejo, CA",39,53,7,4.0,9/15/2016,"UPDATE - I just couldn't stay away and have visited 2-3 times after my last review.  Service has been noticeably better and so far no issues, food continues to be amazing and the variety is unreal, always have a hard time deciding what I want here! I downloaded the app and get discounts, etc.  Also took advantage of 3 Tuesdays in which they were giving away a free pizookie with every order of at least 10 bucks.  Used curbside service mostly, paid on app and via paypal - the hungry, lazy person's dream!"
