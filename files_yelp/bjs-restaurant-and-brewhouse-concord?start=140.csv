Melissa T.,"Contra Costa, CA",42,101,222,3.0,6/10/2016,"So it's a Friday basically morning we arrive at 10:57 am and I was under the impression oh we have a few minutes til they open. Go inside with half of our party and realize the place is pretty empty so no biggie. We let the hostess know that we have a group of 13 coming from an 8th grade graduation. They let us know they're getting the table together. Gotcha.  So I run down to forever 21 real quick while the tables getting set and the rest of our group arrives. And I spent a good 15-20 mins in the store. So my niece and I rush back to our group thinking man they've probably already ordered..right? Soooo not the case. After I settle I ask what you guys order. And I get a look back at me that made me realize something is not right. Come to find out no waiter have been introduced neither has anyone asked for a drink order from us or even come by to check on us.  To fast forward after two personal face to face attempts and a phone call that was put on hold to figure out what's going on. Do we have a waiter ? Is there an issue? We get nothing in return. Not even a courteous do you need help from neighboring waiters.  It truly felt they were all ignoring us because we were staring each and every waiter down. So I go to the bar and actually ask a bartender for water for our table. And she thought I asked for a water for myself. And I reiterated that we all needed water for the table because after 30 mins we still haven't had a server approach us.  Once I sat, a waiter who apparently just so happen to be in that area where we were seated noticed how famished we were. Asked if we needed anything? And we told him actually can you wait on us as a joke. He said he actually was going to wait on us but was told not to someone else was going to. So he said forget it I'll do it. We all started clapping, thanks to Saul or Sal!! He was excellent and didn't get anything wrong. As he was taking our drink orders the lovely bartender I spoke with prior had waters for us. And asked have we been taken care of? By the time we got our drink orders in, groups that arrived after us already boxed up their food. Which made us very upset. Again never upset at Saul he was on point although the the orders took a minute but by this time the restaurant went from 5 groups of her than us to near full capacity.  I can't say if I'll ever return to this location it was so exhausting. We had two kids with us under the age of 7 and they both became very uneasy and irritable because they were even thirsty or hungry or tired of waiting. And a pregnant woman too. It was exhausting for ALL of us. I hope they really do fix this issue. Don't wish this on anyone. Everything we got was a process. A loooooong process. Not the drinks tho just everything else. I hadn't leave early to get to work but before we had to wait more than 30 mins for the bill. Very exhausting, unnecessary and unprofessional."
Riana C.,"San Francisco, CA",243,196,14,5.0,6/3/2016,"By now, everyone knows what BJ's menu serves. This review is for Matthew D!! Matthew D provided my family with the best customer service that we've ever received from a BJ's! Came here late aaafter a Warriors Finals game and he still gave my large party tons of attentiveness and quality customer service. The food came out hot and everyone was pleased with their meal. Extra touch of quality customer service when Matthew brought out a complimentary single pizzookie for the high school graduate that we were celebrating! Thank you Matthew D!"
Jenny F.,"Concord, CA",1,19,2,3.0,3/22/2017,"My friends and I were excited to come and have dinner here after work but not long after walking in we were very disappointed in the way Tiffany handled her mistake. We were told to wait to be called but after 15 minutes we noticed that everyone who was before and after us all got seated (big and small parties) I went up and asked Tiffany. She didn't say anything and started to look for our sitting down receipt. I believe she didn't even print it out to begin with. All she said was ""I'll sit you guys right now"" sounding annoyed and didn't apologize. THANKFULLY our server Ashely M. was a joy! She was attentive, talkative and overall very friendly. The food was also delicious. Thank you Bjs for hiring workers like Ashley."
Miss S. C.,"Fairfield, CA",1,63,1,2.0,4/9/2017,Went in last week ordere the spaghetti and meatballs tasted like a microwave dish not what I expected my daughter got the kids meal pasta that came with bread and guy forget twice to bring it neve filled our drinks. I was ready to leave!
Rise S.,"Concord, CA",0,3,3,5.0,8/25/2017,Daniel was a great waiter who outperformed all expectations in customer service with timeliness on food and drinks. Food and drinks was great. I'll definitely be going back! Thanks Daniel your the best!
Jessica G.,"Los Angeles, CA",127,5,4,2.0,5/1/2017,Went here on a saturday night had no wait ordered the pozookie and others ordered the grilled cheese food was good and worth the price but the service was awful. When we were clearly done the server never came and checked in on us and took 30 minutes to give us our check and walked past us 5 times and then completely different server gave us our check. the whole thing was just frustrating. food was average
Michael N.,"San Pablo, CA",0,1,,4.0,8/15/2017,"Good food, brews and atmosphere. Can get crowded, but the bar is a good place to grab a seat and catch the game. Like the new ""healthy choice"" menu options.  They make sticking to your diet, but still getting a tasty bite possible (although the beer eats up the calorie count)."
Jason G.,"Pasadena, CA",4426,2425,5439,3.0,9/23/2015,"Pretty good food but the best attraction or draw for this chain restaurant is its hours as it is one of the few restaurants in the area that are open really late.  They have a bar menu and specials not only during happy hours but also in the late evening.  The food overall is average, at least the appetizers."
Milko Y.,"San Mateo, CA",0,1,,5.0,8/22/2017,"Really nice experience with the service and also the food was amazing and tasty , the manager Douglas was a really nice guy and friendly as well ,I really enjoyed my lunch today with my friends"
Kristen S.,"Inner Sunset, San Francisco, CA",6,7,,1.0,1/6/2017,"TERRIBLE. Don't waste your time or money here! Wait wasn't awful since we called ahead. But my god. The food was so terrible that we each took 2 bites and that was it. Our server wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed, being that she messed up my order and then after a long time of waiting, she stops by and goes ""you guys didn't order entries did you? Oh wait, you did. Let me check on that."" A few minutes later she comes out with food about the temperature food is and tastes when it's been sitting under a heat lamp for 20-25 minutes. As someone that's been in the industry for years, if you go to a table that asks for the check and refuses boxes with only a bite or 2 taken, maybe use common sense that something was wrong. Maybe inquire? What a waste of $40. The only good thing about this meal was the IPA on draft I got. How is this place busy? We should have gone to In N Out."
Tricia N.,"Walnut Creek, CA",71,170,116,1.0,11/3/2015,"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. I have given BJ's consistent business since they've opened their doors.  Despite some of the incompetent, rude, and annoying staff that they have.  The food is OK, the customer service sucks, and the customer is rarely right here. It is Tuesday, November 3rd.  I called in to reserve a table for 10 on Saturday, November 7th.  The employee I spoke with, said her manager communicated that there are no tables available.  I find it hard to believe, that this massive chain restaurant is unable to accommodate me.  Besides the large parties they're currently accommodating, I'm assuming they must prepare for walk - ins. Unless they plan on turning people away?  The last time I came here (about a week ago); I asked the hostess if we could sit at a table closer to the TV (MNF)?  She said no, kept running back and forth for permission.  She refused to sit us at the tables I requested.  She kept mumbling reasons that made no sense.  It was as though seating 2 people was the most complicated and difficult task. BJ's needs to pay their employees more OR hire more competent staff. I think I'm finished wasting my money here.  Save yourself the trouble.  DO NOT EAT HERE"
Temmara S.,"Oakland, CA",157,144,564,1.0,9/9/2015,"So I come here ALLLLL THE TIME, and have great service(5-star for Andre), but let me tell you about my Labor Day experience. On Monday night it was my friends 21st birthday, and he absolutely loves BJs and would eat there everyday if he could. Anyways, as we seated ourselves at the bar, 5 of us, we were asked what to drink, or should I say some of us were asked what we want to drink. Okay, whatever, no biggie. Then it took foreverrrrrr to find our waiter. Okay, finally she came, took our order and went on with her life again. Mind you, it is about 10pm and it was very slow. Then she comes later and asked if we need utensils.... what do you mean do we need utensils?!? I guess we're supposed to eat our soup and salad with our hands... Before out food came she brought us the dirties/wettest plates ever and only brought four. Seriously you would think she is blind by the fact that she didn't see the food crumbs and how greasy the plate were. Then, out comes the food, from a nice woman by the name of Marsha(i think) and she asks us if we need anything and made sure everything's ok, now the birthday boy says, ""why can't she be our waiter?"" As we were about to eat our food we realize... we DO NOT have utensils... They also forgot my soup and it was cold... Onto dinner, the food was absolutely great as always, then we realized our drinks have been empty for quite some time now. Eventually enough was enough, so my friend, having experience in serving customers decides to ask for a manager, and boy was he an unapologetic a**. He sarcastically said, ""is here anything else that I can get you that you didn't get?"" Not once an apology, I almost wanted to ask for his manager. I guess when the manager is more like your friend you get away with giving shitty service. Then TIFFANI(our waiter) walks by and ask another waiter, ""Do you need help?"" WTF, what do you mean do she need help? YOU NEED HELP. We need help.  Okay, so to conclude my essay, the waiter, who finally came out from hiding asks the birthday boy would he like a pizookie....................and he says no!!! wtf, what do you mean no?!?! He loves pizookies, but that literally how shitty our server was, she sucked the enthusiasm out of us, he couldn't even find her to order his first legal drink! So as you may know, when the check comes, they are sooooo nice. And sadly, me being me, still persuaded my friends to give her a 15% percent tip....... What a good night... pause, NOT."
Wenzel L.,"Concord, CA",0,5,5,1.0,9/17/2016,"So me and my friend both get some drinks, the cream soda and the black cherry soda, both in mugs that were in a freezer. We down our first drinks, but when we get the second ones, we notice something wrong with ours. There were random pieces of somethings floating in the black cherry drink that were definitely not supposed to be there. It grossed both of us out, and there were even weird black/brown things on both the inside and outside of the mugs!  On top of that, my friend also asked for a well done burger, but one side of the whole burger was pink, not even the center of the burger. Be wary of this BJ's."
Mrs.Kifle S.,"Pittsburg, CA",0,8,,5.0,4/9/2017,Great Service ! Our waiter was so nice we repeatedly asked him for 5 more minutes we kept talking and getting side tracked from deciding on the menu !!! The drinks were so good and so was the food I ordered the spaghetti with meatballs the portion was really big I brought it for lunch the next day !
Rachel Ann C.,"Irvine, CA",416,303,1459,3.0,8/15/2014,"I've been here several times over the years and my experience has always been inconsistent. It's mostly about the customer service. Employees will forget about my table sometimes, neglect to come back or take my order, forget to get my beer. Other times, they are extremely friendly and courteous and are willing to serve you. I've had a waitress one time who seemed like she was flirting with a customer in the bar. Same goes for another guy serving a table of girls. Service aside, the food is standard BJ's. Their appetizers and entrees tend to run HUGE. Just look at the calorie count--it's definitely something NOT for one person. I tend to split the bigger entrees and pastas with another person as it's enough for two. The appetizers are DEFINITELY shareable between 3+ people. If you're looking for a more personalized one-person or small group appetizer, go for the Snacks and Small Shares portion of the menu. You'll definitely save your appetite and money. Most of their foods are huge, greasy and packed with flavor which makes you fill up. Not entirely healthy but... It is BJ's. Since it is a brewhouse, they have such a great selection of beers. For a light beer-cider blend, I love their Black Velvet beer. It's a nice brew of their BJ's Porter (coffee-chocolate-malt roast) and Cider blend. It's sweet but balanced well with their dark brew. I've heard of their other beers as well and people tend to generally enjoy them--just find what suits you! Overall, mediocre experiences altogether. Pizookies are usually a guilty pleasure and you can never go wrong if you're ready to indulge in those. A restaurant and brewhouse that packs on the flavors and sizes in their foods, good happy hour with a great beer selection, and mediocre service. Classic BJ's chain for ya!"
Jay R.,"San Francisco, CA",1,2,2,5.0,3/10/2017,"Great service and great food! What else can you ask for?  I've been to this BJs a few time now and the service is what keeps me coming back! The servers are super friendly, the management team is awesome and the food is delicious!  On this occasion the manager on duty Douglas greeted us with a nice smile and warm welcome! Both he and the server suggested we try the NEW chocolate mint Pazzooki and boy was I glad he did!!! I was totally in Pazzooki heaven! I'll for sure be back again! Keep up the great job Douglas!"
Caroleann B.,"Oceanside, CA",457,576,3900,4.0,9/3/2015,"I was visiting in the area and my cousin suggested to meet here for a bite and drinks.  We did come here at dinner time and on a Friday, so needless to say it was quite busy. The restaurant is located in the mall parking lot.  Our server took a few minutes to get to us, but we were able to place our order. He returned with another server with our drinks and informed he was going on break and she will take care of us. Our food was brought to us after waiting a bit.  Our server did check on us but it seemed like a long wait.  And of course when you need something at the table they are never around, but finally got we needed.   The food was good, fresh and hot so no complaints there. It being Friday and dinner time, it took awhile to get the bill.  If in the area, despite the wait, I would return to have a bite and drinks."
Andre L.,"Fairfield, CA",391,106,564,2.0,8/12/2015,"BJs is of course famous for its brewery and pizooki: as far as service goes, not that high up on the list. The calamari was very soggy and cold!  My girlfriend ordered the Angel Hair Pasta and the pasta noodles were waaaaaay over cooked (very mushy) she had to tell the waiter she needed a different dish. They didn't put it on the tab at least."
Gina B.,"Pleasanton, CA",6,30,4,4.0,1/3/2017,"They have a really big menu and lots of tasty ones.  Our family goes here for a treat now and then, but most of the time you do have to wait at least a few minutes for a table.  Weekdays we've had shorter wait (or no wait at all).  We've tried all the types of food they offer, and they are consistently good.  Their pizza reminds me of Pizzeria Uno, which I used to love, so that's a welcome treat I can indulge in now and then."
Tracy D.,"Albany, CA",114,104,185,3.0,1/2/2017,"Service was super slow and it wasn't that crowded.  Our waitress was nice but don't understand the slowness of service.  Had clam chowder, cesar salad, kid had grilled cheese.  Jut ok.  But the Pizzookie was amazing.  I'd just come here for that."
