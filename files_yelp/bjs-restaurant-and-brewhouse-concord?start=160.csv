Avery B.,"Oakland, CA",6,4,,1.0,1/22/2017,No Stars! Went here today and ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken and had like 3 or 4 bites looked down and the chicken was BLOODY and red. I told the nice waiter and he said he would take it off the bill and take it off my bill!!' Honestly think they should have the whole damn meal free. That is NASTY and I could get sick but the waiter said they he told his manager and he can take it off the bill!!! Really just the meal that was not cooked chicken!!!!! Please make sure your food is cooked before eating!!!
Colleen C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,11,2,2.0,8/4/2017,"Came here for lunch & our poor waitress, Patricia, was given no support ex... Appetizer put on table by supporting staff but given no silverware, lunch delivered by support staff but appetizer plates not cleared. Patricia could have had some help bc she was back & forth carrying drinks for 2 tables at a time etc..."
Norm D.,"San Francisco, CA",54,130,415,3.0,6/8/2016,"It's BJ's for goodness sake. Everyone knows what you will get when you come in here. I came in here for a late lunch and a beer, and I knew exactly what I was going to get in food, service, and quality of beer. I ordered for lunch the Black and Bleu-House Burger with chipotle, bleu cheese crumbles, Applewood smoked bacon, tomatoes and roasted garlic aioli. I also asked for sliced red onions. Medium rare burger of course. I also ordered the HopStorm IPA as well. Beer was good (I had two in fact), and the burger wasn't bad. Service was acceptable and friendly as well (it did take a while to get water). BJ's is the same everywhere, so it shouldn't be a surprise to anyone."
Car C.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,18,1,1.0,9/17/2016,"Even with different location... The service sucks  2x in Dublin location and now here in Concord. Today, Simple orders of soup and appetizer took 45 min. It was not even busy. We got our appetizer n that was it. Ask for the manager to comp our appetizer -- Pat was apologetic and accommodating but too late my 85 yrs old dad wanted and ready to go. We headed to Lucille across the way. Maybe the CEO need to do an 'Undercover Boss' to restructure the weak links of customer service of this business. They have enough staff hanging around. Too bad they are not thoroughly trained. Three times too many to give it another chance."
Drew B.,"Walnut Creek, CA",1,56,10,5.0,2/19/2017,"My wife, mom and myself came here last night for dinner. We got 2 flights, 2 pints and some awesome grub. I ordered the hickory brisket & bacon burger. It was soooo good. We had a good time and even helped sing happy birthday to the table across from us. Great service and our server seemed knowledgeable about brews."
Lauren C.,"Vacaville, CA",369,70,880,2.0,11/1/2016,Late post. We came in a slow day (Wednesday) no problem getting seated right away for a party of 3 but was disappointed that when I checked in at the hospitality desk area they didn't ask if I was a bjs premiere rewards member or not. Therefore my mobile check didn't show up on my BJs app. Lately I've been paying via the app so I won't have the hassle of waiting for a long time to get my check by the server. We had two servers this day. I'm assuming one is a new employee and the other one is kinda of shadowing and guiding. It was confusing because they would both talk and we don't really know who we should talk to. As far as food it arrived very late considering there were hardly anyone at the time. We ordered our typical dishes but was underwhelmed with quality and taste. The server didn't come up to ask to refill my drink. Been drinking the heck out of my soda because the food was taking forever to arrive. This time around our food and service experience was huge MISS!
Bong T.,"Concord, CA",114,36,378,5.0,6/3/2016,"""There's no other way  I would truly enjoy having a sumptuous dinner at BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse in Concord rather than with our home town guests, 'COREY NAKAMURA' and 'TYLER YAMAGUCHI' from Hawaii who are 'Star Athletes' of the WC Crawdads Baseball Summer League while joyfully watching the Warriors badly trounced the Cavaliers, 104-89 on Game 1 of the NBA Finals. Their food was unbelievably delish! We had their yummy Combo Pairing Meals of Steak and Shrimp with creamy sauce. We Love their signature 'PIZOOKIE' dessert of macadamia pudding top with creamy vanilla ice cream. A 'BIG SHOUT OUT' to our amazing server, 'CORREEN' for her 'phenomenal' and 'hilarious' service. ""THANK YOU"" 'C'! Couldn't wait to be back soon! It's All 'Worth' It Dining at BJ's People! #Warriors #DubNation #StrengthInNumbers #NBAFinals2016 #ABC7Now #BJRestaurant @julianedward_"
Mari A.,"San Francisco, CA",0,3,,5.0,3/12/2017,"Doug, the manager was very helpful since we first walked in. I saw him checking in with every table making sure everyone was good, great hospitality. My husband Salmon dish was dry and He called Doug and right away he fixed the problem. Very impressed!!!!  We will be coming back more"
Ashley S.,"Irvine, CA",232,36,,4.0,1/12/2017,"Usually don't go to many chain restaurants these days but you can never wrong with BJs because of their extensive menu. BJs Favorite pizza, BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad and the Asian Chopped Salad are my go-to's!"
Bobbi P.,"Emeryville, CA",2,2,1,5.0,1/7/2017,"5 stars for our server Nina with the bandana... It was our first time at BJ's and she was extremely helpful & friendly.. Amazing service, we will be coming back !"
Amy Y.,"Berkeley, CA",1329,658,1993,3.0,10/21/2015,"I came here with some co-workers post work, and the food is great. The food is on the pricier side, but everything tasted good. The potsticker as my co worker says ""tastes like trader joes"" but we loved the wings. Stay away from the chicken potstickers. Definitely not worth it! The buffalo wing HITS THE SPOT!! The ranch sauce with it is amazing!! CHICKEN WINGS $10.50 Drizzled with hot and spicy buffalo and ranch. Served with celery sticks, extra sauce and ranch for dipping. Or choose one of our signature sauces from the selections below. Signature sauces: Brewhouse BBQ, maui sweet teriyaki glaze, garlic parmesan, extra hot buffalo. It's perfect! The CRISPY CALAMARI $10.95 With marinara and lemon garlic aioli was okay.  We also got some drinks and I ordered Very Berry Margarita with: Patrón Silver Tequila | Cointreau Orange Liqueur | Monin Blackberry | Strawberry Purée | BJ's Fresh Sweet & Sour | Fresh Lime | On the Rocks. It was basically tequila. I didn't like it too much.  We sat outside so it was a great area, and we got a pretty big table. The server was overwhelmed with our order so she forgot our drinks multiple times. Someone also refilled my alcohol with water.. for some weird reason.. It's a good thing we went and got free food, otherwise I would not come here."
Myra P.,"Pittsburg, CA",1,3,2,2.0,5/29/2017,Everytime I order something it's salty. I think the chef just pours salt on my order .  I ordered chicken lettuce wrap. Omg I was so excited to eat it and it was salty. My husband ordered jambalaya it was also salty . The fries were serve hard and old . What a waste of money . So disappointed !!!!
Jacqueline J.,"San Francisco, CA",173,117,553,3.0,3/26/2016,"Food is alright here.. Kinda blan honestly. I mostly order salads at this place or their deep dish pizza which is probably the best thing on their menu. Customer service is is slow at times. If i had to choose between this or Cheesecake Factory because they are kinda similar in menu options, it def be Cheesecake Factory. bjs needs more variety in their menu! And hire more waiters/waitresses!"
Travis W.,"Vallejo, CA",109,77,23,3.0,4/22/2016,"Food is good, drinks are better. The drink selection is very nice, I love trying new beers, went with the black velvet beer, VERY GOOD, poured correctly. The steak was good not great but good, I'm used to steakhouses so that might be it. Go here with the thought of drinking, they even have a pairing chart to help those who don't know how to pair drinks with your food, I myself didn't really know and it was very interesting taking a look at it. Service was okay, they don't seem to be very much into it, another thing I didn't like too much was at the booths it's hard to watch what's on TV, either you have to look straight up or look across the place to see. ONE THING YOU HAVE TO DO IS TRY THE PIZOOKIE!!! Pizza and cookie, not literally but just imagine a huge cookie with ice cream and whipped cream. I'm not big on desserts but love this."
Andy C.,"Concord, CA",1,17,,1.0,8/2/2017,"Waited over an hour to get our appetizers, no exaggeration. Very frustrating, didn't get any attention from the servers or anyone walking by. Food itself was meh. Appetizers were frozen and microwaved, don't recommend them. Really got off on the wrong foot, very bad impression, won't be coming back again."
Monica J.,"San Pablo, CA",1,3,1,2.0,2/20/2017,"After shopping at the mall for a couple of hours, my family and I worked up an appetite and decided to have BJ's for dinner. It was a Sunday evening so we imagined it would be somewhat busy but not 30 minutes wait-time busy (there were plenty of tables open from what we could see.)  Once we were finally seated, it took about 5 minutes to actually get a server come to our table. When he came back to our table with our drinks, he placed the drink on the uneven table and accidentally spilled my fathers drink and it fell all over his lap and phone. Luckily no damage, just a bit of stickiness, but we understand accidents happen. The bus boy was a great deal of help! After the spill ordeal, we were ready to order. The server had pens and notepads in his pockets but as we were giving him our orders, he never wrote anything down; pretty weird especially since it was a busy night and he was serving other tables but I just relied on his good memory I guess. My parents ordered soup and salad combos so their meals came out in a fairly average wait time. As my parents are getting through their meals, our server finally came with my plate but instead of the sirloin steak, he brought me a huge rib-eye steak. When I told him that's not what I ordered, he seemed confused and said that he could've sworn I said rib-eye and even look at his ""empty"" notepad. So as my parents finish their food, I finally received my meal but at that point it was already late and I had to rush through it; not even able to enjoy it. The only good thing about this experience was that I had a $5 off $25 coupon. I think it's better to play it safe and take the extra second to write down orders and that way you won't waste food/time and get things wrong in the first place."
A R.,"Martinez, CA",0,3,6,1.0,8/2/2017,"Worst experience today. Horrible service, sat down with a party of 5. No server approached or asked if we needed anything for 20 minutes. Finally we stopped a server who said they knew who our server was and if she was busy she would help. 10 minutes passed and still no service. We left and went to lucille's and the service is already at a 10. My suggestion is to potential customers to avoid BJ's and give that hard earned cash to any of the other local establishments and hopefully BJ's will fix its self or disappear."
Gus D.,"Fairfield, CA",17,6,2,5.0,1/4/2017,Let start by saying it was a real treat to have  been treated like we VIP at BJS our waitress Alicia was so helpful to help us and the 20 other tables at the Bar we were just stopping on my best B-Day. And we're treat with gloves must stop by and will return visit is coming David the Manager on Duty was always near by andatentive to our needs.  Gus and Jim cord.
Myra V.,"Martinez, CA",86,22,26,2.0,4/20/2015,"I'm just going to get to the point in saying that I've always liked the food here. It's ok, pretty good. Every once in a while I'll crave a pizookie and come by with my family.  BUT THEN we'll come in and the service is so bad that it'll remind us why we don't come in so often.  We prob haven't been to this location in over a year prior to today's visit. The service was just as bad back then.  Today our server was Katie. We've seen her here over a year ago so she's been around for a while. We used to see her in the bar area but I guess she's serving on the lower dining area now. We arrived at approx. 7:45pm and didn't leave until approx 9:10pm. We were seating for at least ten minutes before they took our order or even brought waters over. We ordered an appetizer (carnitas fries, they prob weren't worth the $6), a pizza to share, my son ordered a kids meal, and we shared a pizookie at the end.  When ordering, I asked Katie to tell me what was on one of the pizzas featured on the table that wasn't in the menu (I think it was called the Prime Veggie?), and she had no idea but pulled an answer out of her ass. She proceeded to ask me ""What DON'T you like, and I'll tell you if it's on there?"" I didn't have an answer for her but I told her I just wanted it to have artichokes. She confidently said that it did so I ordered it, but of course we later found out that it did NOT have artichokes. She didn't come by the table very much, and when she did we asked her for two ranch dressings. She only brought one. When we reminded her about the second one, she never brought it.  We didn't order much but it took SO LONG for us to be served. I understand that sometimes it may be a little busy, but the service was bad as soon as we sat down. Another thing that irritated me was that for some reason the table next to us that arrived after we did (and had a bigger party than us) received their check before we did! UGH. I had to calm my boyfriend down because he was ready to just get up, leave, and tell the people in the front that Katie was taking too long to come by with our check.  Bj's is nice, but not this location. The service here is horrible, and has been for years. Only come if you're not in a rush or have nothing to do for the rest of your night. And Katie-- I've worked in the restaurant industry before, where I've had to know what came with every single menu item and combination we offered. We know you're not new here, so I suggest you step your customer service game up. I apologize if this is harsh, but I believe that you did NOT deserve the 15% that I tipped you."
Jessica B.,"Pacheco, CA",42,10,1,2.0,7/27/2017,"Great food but service was horrible. Didn't get greeted or asked for drinks for 10 minutes after we were seated. Didn't have the same server, different people each time throughout our whole meal."
