Teasha S.,"Denver, CO",235,58,1,4.0,3/3/2016,"I moved to the East Bay last year from Reno and I ALWAYS went to BJ's up there, but the negative reviews for the BJ's around here have caused me to stay away until recently... I'm glad I gave it a shot, because they did just fine and I missed their pizzas, dammit. We came here on a weekday evening this week and I believe our server was named Emily.  She was attentive, quick, and efficient, and even made sure to put the half of the pizza with mushrooms facing my boyfriend (lol) since I ordered my half without. She seemed genuinely happy to help and it made me regret not trying the local BJ's here sooner.   Give them a shot! Just remember that lunchtimes are busy, as are weekends, and the service might be slower at that time. Also, I think it's really weird that multiple Yelpers are complaining about Pizookies. I could not care less if a pizookie is kind of stuck to the cookie sheet.  I would annihilate that thing anyway. Pizookies are fantastic."
Christy A.,"Concord, CA",0,5,,1.0,2/5/2017,"Went to lunch here on Super Bowl Sunday (2/5/2017) and was hoping to have a good time. Not only did the service stink....I ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken and needed a take home box. I did forget it and left it at my table. Got to the car and in the rain ran back to get it.....(was MAYBE 4 minutes!)...... The young man with a silly smirk on his face said ""oh I'm sorry they threw it out"".......I could not believe it. He just stood there and stared at me!  A classy restaurant  (I know this from past experience) keeps the boxed food for up to 30 minutes as a courtesy for those people who sometimes do forget their take home box when they leave the table.  Shame on you BJ's for wasting food and not allowing the benefit of the doubt for your guests....... think about it Management and make the necessary changes!"
Desiree N.,"American Canyon, CA",1,20,14,1.0,2/5/2017,"Please please please please please save yourself and avoid this BJ's restaurant at all costs. Let me tell you, I've been here about three times in my nineteen years of living and I've had bad experiences all three times, but let me tell you about the last time I went.  So my friends and I were hungry and Lucille's was closed so we decided to go to BJ's, that was our first mistake. We were seated promptly and everything was going okay until we got our food. There were four of us and NOT ONE item was cooked correctly. I got soup in a bread bowl, the soup was cold and the bread bowl was burnt, so burnt that I could not break into it with my teeth at all. One of my friends got an artichoke dip and the chips were stale and the dip was crusting/burnt, we didn't know how it was possible to screw up a dip but okay! My other friend ordered a pasta and it had NO TASTE, we all tried it and none of us could eat it. So we called the waiter over and complained, she had an attitude even though we kindly explained to her that this food was something that a dog wouldn't dare touch. I knew that she would be no help so I told her to call her manager. The manager came over and was kind enough to have our food remade. Two of my friends were so disappointed that they didn't want their food remade so the manager agreed to have the food that we didn't eat removed from the check. The second batch that came out was great, food that we should've got the first time around, but we were happy that they finally got it right. However, when it was time to pay for the check, all hell broke loose. Our evil waiter carried her attitude the whole night and almost exploded when we asked to split the check and remove the food that we didn't eat from the check (keep in mind, the manager previously agreed). On the way out, we asked for our change (that our waiter neglected to return to us) and the waiter literally starting YELLING about how much of an inconvenience we were. It was so embarrassing and I couldn't BELIEVE what was happening. Almost everyone in the restaurant turned to look at us and as much as we wanted our change, we couldn't stand the negative attention so we simply left. As someone who has worked in food service for almost four years, I couldn't understand how she could do such a thing to paying customers, and get away with it. I called corporate and my call was never returned. There's not much I can do but I will make sure to pray for that girl."
Ellis B.,"San Leandro, CA",21,66,56,1.0,12/5/2016,"Over 30 mins wait for food, no water refill. Horrible experience. People were getting up and walking out. Bar maid knew no prices on beer. What a joke."
Liz B.,"Concord, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/21/2017,This place is a joke. I was waiting for 20 minutes in the free sitting area. I got there at 11:36pm. The servers kept passing by not paying attention to our group of 3. We waited for them but they came around 11:50 pm telling us they already closed that area. They literally payed attention to us at the moment they were going to close but kept looking straight at us before without giving us menus or anything.
Ronald J.,"Concord, CA",0,16,,5.0,7/22/2017,"Our service last night was rather incredible. Our server, Sam, was upbeat and bubbly and even in the dead of night, as the clock was striking 12, she was still very attentive of our table and our needs; consistently topping off waters and taking orders with great speed. She also recommended the cherry chipotle salmon, which was amazing."
Charlene S.,"Moraga, CA",0,18,1,4.0,1/26/2017,"I was so excited a special friend gave me her extra slice of sausage pizza from BJs. I haven't been to BJs in years but I'm already craving it again! Even though I heated up the slice it was still so moist& sooooo delicious, w/ so much chz & fresh tomatoes :) I would love to give BJs 5 stars but I I wish their prices were a bit lower. However, your pizza is amazing& worth the visit!"
Jim R.,"Antioch, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/21/2017,"The service of this restaurant is second to none ,for all the wrong reasons ,the staff not all just blatant ignore even the most basic of request  it's not too much to ask to have utensils at the table  but seems like here it is ,our waiter was fine and he was I believe genuine in his embarrassment  of co workers lack of professionalism and furthermore even more upset that his manager at his request and ours would. Not address the lack of basic service  ,so enjoy Bjs  but realize  no service included"
Rachel S.,"Pleasanton, CA",757,547,284,3.0,4/1/2015,"My boyfriend and I came here after a long night of bingo playing. It was one of the only places that was still open at 11:30PM. I hadn't ever been to this particular BJ's, I knew it was by the mall...but I didn't know if it was on the other side of the freeway with all the other restaurants. Note: it's connected to the mall.  Since it was so late, the dining room was closed and only serving in the bar area. That was fine, there was a good amount of people sitting in there. Service was a little on the slow side at first, but once our waitress came, it picked up.  My boyfriend and I ordered the spinach and artichoke dip, wings and a flatbread pizza. The spinach and artichoke dip, we could have passed on. It was like it had been sitting out from earlier and they threw it in the microwave and reheated it. It was a weird quiche-like texture, instead of a creamy dip, like texture. I suppose that's what happens when you go to a restaurant late. The wings, we ordered half and half, different sauces. I got the garlic parmesean and my boyfriend got some hot buffalo flavored sauce. I liked mine, they were good with ranch. You do have to ask for an extra side of ranch though, if you have two different flavors because they only give you one.  The flatbread pizza was okay. A little more greasy than I remembered from other locations, but overall we liked it. Our waitress was really nice. It was my birthday, so she made sure to bring out a personal sized pizookie.  I understand that going to businesses close to when they're closing can change your experience a little bit. I wouldn't say that this isn't a bad location, but you could definitely tell that they wanted to get out of there ASAP that night."
Ploy A.,"Richmond, CA",60,2,1,2.0,12/11/2016,We come here often but hosting&seating system never change.There a lot of empty tables but I don't understand why they won't seat people there.i give 2 stars because we love your beers not the service
Jenna K.,"Sacramento, CA",0,11,1,2.0,1/21/2017,"I went on a first date there last night. I noticed the protocol seems to be asking the table if they want separate checks or checks together, I think it's incredibly rude. Im sure it makes it easier to split the bill if you know ahead of time, but don't ask. Hand us the bill and if we want it separate WE will ask. Just made things a little awkward for us."
Alexa A.,"Hercules, CA",117,26,56,4.0,6/11/2016,"I love bj's, but they're good not great. The service was slow, but our waitress was very kind. We were seated quickly and promptly ordered drinks and appetizers. We had the combo appetizer with mozzarella sticks, artichoke dip and chips, avocado rolls and buffalo wings. It would've been perfect without the avocado rolls. They were just egg rolls stuffed with avocado, not very pleasing. After our appetizer we waited quite awhile for our main courses to arrive, some of the sides were messed up (fries instead of mashed potatoes) but  were fixed quickly. Of course we ended our meals with pizookies! We ordered the trio which included 3 mini pizookies for $10. It was marvelous."
Marietta G.,"Concord, CA",10,15,16,1.0,9/17/2016,"We called ahead knowing full well it gets pretty crowded, the reception forgot to check us in when we got there.   We waited 20 minutes.   Our food was not fresh, my friend and I both ordered Ahi Tuna and the tuna looked dry and old.  I ordered this dish several times and loved it, this time the tuna was hidden in the lettuce and cut in tiny portion.  Not worth what we paid for.  On top of that we both got sick."
Jay B.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",104,409,360,4.0,3/6/2016,I am a fan for BJ! Came here on a random Saturday morning. I ordered the all you can eat soup and salad. It was well worth the price!! I couldn't believe it! I am surely a fan!!
Jenelle C.,"Concord, CA",2,33,36,5.0,10/24/2016,"Just want to say thank you so much to CORREEN!!!! She was super nice and very fast with her job. I didn't have to ask for anything twice which is a 1st, and what I loved is she brought me water to start without me having to ask. She is super friendly and if I ever come back here I will ask for her before they seat   customer service I've had all year... thank you so much correen for the amazing experience ."
Isabel A.,"Clayton, CA",24,6,,5.0,11/25/2016,Went here for lunch the good was great the waiter was exceptional! His name is thomas he was very happy and polite and helpful!
Stacy C.,"Antioch, CA",0,16,,1.0,9/13/2016,I have been going to this place since they have opened and it has definitely gone down hill. I was bragging to my boyfriend how great this place was and we have gone there twice in the last month and ended up just leaving because the server just wouldn't come to us. We sat there for at least 15 minutes and didn't even get a water! This place is a joke! I will definitely not be going back here again.. such a shame!
Ryan W.,"Pittsburg, CA",0,2,,1.0,7/8/2017,Very poor service waiter was rude and tried to be funny at our expense. Ordered drinks took a long time and another 15-20 before we saw our waiter again. When the food finally came out our kids food was cold and the burger I ordered was wrong. When I asked for it to be corrected it took another 25 min to get it corrected and all the manger said was well I guess it is because it is a new item and it is bound to happen. To me this is a poor excuse
Patricia F.,"El Sobrante, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/4/2017,"If you are into beer and watching sports on big screen TV this is the place with over 30 beers on tap. The food is mediocre and service is slow. We started with clam chowder which was barely warm. The grilled Mahi Mahi tacos were a skimpy piece of fish covered in cabbage, served again barely warm, not good. I've had lunch here before never again for dinner and think twice about going back for lunch. The waiter was nice and offered a replacement entree but I didn't want to wait for it. I just wanted to be done and gone!!"
Alex G.,"San Francisco, CA",183,20,,1.0,11/4/2016,"After calling in to reserve our party before hand, we still had to wait 30 minutes for them to rudely tell us that it'll be another 40 minutes to be seated.  It's truly baffling that people still come this sorry excuse for a BJ's."
