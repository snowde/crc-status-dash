Joy E.,"Lakeport, CA",27,3,,1.0,10/15/2016,"Took an hour before anyone noticed we didit get anything to eat yet, asked the manager to see what was up he never came back to see if we were  ok? We went to a horse show Calvera in Santa Jose all the way from Calistoga  and had to drive home empty in our stomach maybe stop somewhere to get a bite. Kind of ruined the great time......"
Shelli H.,"Martinez, CA",371,251,1332,4.0,10/30/2014,"Wow! Good job Bjs at stepping up your game! My mom and I regularly eat lunch here. Our server was William H, he was spot on our needs. I had the grilled ahi salad, not the first time I have had it but it was definitely the best. I asked for extra wasabi, it was delivered by a runner. Barely any wasabi. 1 bite in and here comes William with a big scoop of it. Excellent!! He checked on us constantly but not annoyingly . My mom had the new chicken pesto sandwich and she also enjoyed her food.. They must be listening to all the bad reviews because this time it was outstanding.. Good job BJs."
Alexis L.,"Walnut Creek, CA",191,80,22,4.0,3/26/2015,The carnitas fries are my absolute favorite appetizer and of course I love the pizookies.  It's like any other BJ's except this one is consistently filled at the bar and throughout the restaurant. I've always had great service here
Kelly G.,"Aurora, CO",119,389,7889,2.0,12/5/2014,"This was my second visit for lunch in the last couple of months.  They were located near JC Penney's at the Sun Valley Mall in Concord.  The first time I went, I ordered the Prime Beef Dip and my mom ordered the Chinese Chicken Salad.  My beef was in little pieces and it was fatty.  My mom enjoyed her salad and ate the whole thing. On our second visit, we both ordered the Unlimited Soup and Salad.  The Clam Chowder was good, but tasted like canned soup.  We had to ask  for an order of Garlic Bread to eat with the soup.  They did not have dinner rolls or crackers,  We ordered a total of 3 salads.  A Caesar, Wedge, and Garden.  All were basic. I ate for free on Veteran's Day showing my DD214.  The deal was for any entree for $9.75 or less.  Most of the entrees I wanted to order were in the $9.95 and $10.95 range. We probably won't be back."
m f.,"Alameda, CA",0,26,4,1.0,10/6/2016,"Last night, my girlfriend and I were waiting for a table in the bar to be cleaned, after someone had spilled their drink and broken a glass on the floor. I witnesses the bus boy literally wipe up the floor, glass and all, then use the SAME RAG to wipe down the tables and chairs. We were sitting their watching, and couldn't believe how anyone working in food service could be so ignorant, especially with people waiting for the table, watching! It sucks because we eat here every so often, but we will NEVER be back after witnessing that. Who trains these people? Who manages them? Unreal."
Nicokle I.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",0,5,,1.0,4/28/2017,The food is exactly what you would expect from a mid level chain but the service is TERRIBLE! Expect rude waiters and at least 20 minutes for even the most basic salad.
Alma M.,"Concord, CA",1,30,26,4.0,9/14/2016,Tuna salad is the best. They have this little dessert cookie dough with ice cream OMG its delicious. Good place for dinner.
Anne C.,"Napa, CA",1302,497,592,4.0,12/25/2013,"I have never been to Bjs, but I was forced to come here and after two glasses of MacMurray Pinot Noir, I got their version of a Caprese salad. Then we got the appetizer veggie pizza. Then the mac n cheese no bacon. And then the Beignet.  :)  Yum. Fast service. Comfortable booths. Although there was a ten minute wait to sit in a near empty restaurant."
Mondo M.,"Concord, CA",46,12,11,1.0,1/29/2017,"Worst service ever at this place. Went to eat Saturday for lunch it was around 1:30 we where seated pretty quick. Got our orders in, in a timely manner. We get out drinks I drink my $4.00 root beer and it took for ever to get a refill. My 2 daughters got chocolate milk they didn't get a refill the guy bring me another drink after I tried to eat the driest burger I ever had. The brisket Burger was a total let down. I sent it back they took it off check my daughters chicken tenders where also dry if not for a bottle of ketchup I don't think she would have ate them. I had the tortilla soup it tasted ok but gave me stomach problems first stomach pains then explosion as I nearly made it home. We are to sleek with manger he never came. Then the district manager called me I missed his call called him back and he said he would call me and never heard back from him. The first time we went to BJ  the bar was set high the waiter was awesome drinks never got past half the food came out was on point. He made sure we had every thing we needed now we go and get crap food and bad service. Oh and when we got the food we had to wait to see server to ask for utensils because we had none at the table. I would not recommend going to BJ's anymore. I went to in and out after we left BJ's and the $4.00double cheese burger animal style was 100 times better then BJ's 15.99 brisket burger. If you want a good brisket burger go to Lumpy's.."
Eddie W.,"Oakland, CA",0,5,1,1.0,4/18/2017,"Congratulations you got one star for getting my order correct! Maybe next time if you don't send all your servers home early you'll get more stars. Never come here for a late night snack, the service is horrible. The waitress tried to talk to me like she was my step mom. And everybody knows damn well they get no respect. Hopefully they'll come to your table before the have an attitude. She kept coming to our table complaining about other customers and management. I'm sorry is this a restaurant or a pity party? Try again motherfucker."
Angela J.,"Newark, CA",14,9,11,1.0,9/21/2016,"Wow ... Unbelievable that a well known restaurant like BJ Brewery in Concord, CA can prepare and present food that looks so unappetizing.  The plate was dirty, pieces of avocado inside the rolls were smushed and falling out, and the garnish were scattered and looks as if someone grabbed some grass and threw it on the plate.  Sorry, but food presentation must be appealing, not looks like it's was flopped on the plate from Folsom prison."
Veronica D.,"San Ramon, CA",5,19,8,1.0,6/13/2016,We preordered.... They couldn't find our order... When they brought it out it was cold... The soup was cold the fries were not only cold they where hard... The fish was greasy. They brought me another order of fries. But they where not any better.. The salad even had some old pieces of Roman lettuce. The pizookie saved the meal.
Gory W.,"Phoenix, AZ",23,54,5,4.0,10/4/2016,"Friendly Staff, happy hour all day during any NFL game day. I had a ribeye steak, very tasty and 3 beers at the bar while watching the game. Met a few friendly patrons men and women who were enjoying 6 TV'S as the Giants beat the Dodgers, as NFL played on 5 others. A great place to watch the game lots of TV'S across the huge dining area. I will return"
Winston L.,"Hercules, CA",68,50,14,3.0,11/8/2015,"It's alright.  It kind of reminds me of Buffalo Wild Wings.  Decent beer.  Food is ok, but I don't really want to eat it unless I'm going there for another reason (watch the game, another friend picked the hangout place, etc.) Our dinner: Appetizers were solid.  I feel like almost no restaurant can mess up fried stuff or chip + creamy dip though. Pizza - meh.  It came in a pan and was kind of like deep dish, but I wouldn't really recommend it unless you had a serious hankering for some pizza. Ahi salad - decent Pizookie - this thing was pretty freaking great.  A hot cookie in small pan with ice cream on top. I definitely could see myself having a good time here for a sports occasion (beer, burger, apps).  I can't see myself coming back here for dinner."
Will C.,"Garden Grove, CA",188,190,114,4.0,8/2/2015,"BJ's was crowded at dinner time, but its 2b expected in a big shopping center on Friday night.  We'd spent the day sight seeing and shopping in San Francisco.  So we are meeting relatives and having a reunion.  They had arrived earlier and put their name on the queue for a table.  When we arrived they had just down and ordered.  Service for us was just as quick but I guess that doesn't count because we didn't have to wait.   Girlfriend and her son split the classic burger . I had a similar burger with fries. Everything was great.  And although someone technically paid the bill, I added my BJs loyalty membership number onto the check and they gave me credit without having my member card on hand.  Nice touch, on top of quick service at the busy time. Well recommended, we will return whenever we go to Concorde."
Bonnie B.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",9,10,,2.0,4/22/2016,"Good food. Terrible service. Waitress picked up previous bill and did not even  acknowledge our presence. A simple hello would have been nice. I wanted a booth. Waited with dirty dishes in front of us for 15 minutes, finally sat at the bar. Bartender was great. Used to be a great place. Kudos to the kitchen!!  Always good and reasonable wait time."
Mikaela B.,"San Ramon, CA",190,71,83,3.0,6/20/2016,"Nice waitress but wouldn't order the deep dish ravioli again, noodles where uncooked inside & it tasted bad. Looked like mush."
Stacy C.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",11,143,49,2.0,9/10/2015,"One star for the tortilla soup, an extra star for service. Nowhere in the 20-page menu does it describe their soups, nor the fact that the tortilla soup is garnished with the vile herb, cilantro. Once that was remedied, the soup was the best thing we got. Mediterranean Chicken Pita was HORRIBLE. Raw, doughy pita, 4 pieces of chicken and cubes of tomato, onion, and cucumber. Yawn. Don't be fooled by the wild grain salad, it's mostly mushy quinoa. The rest of the overpriced meal was about the same. Pan pizza was meh, we'll get Round Table next time. Driest, toughest ribeye ever. Yuck. $4 for a dinky side salad. And the wedge salad tasted sweet. SWEET. Gnarly. I'd go back for the soup, though."
Judy W.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,15,,1.0,3/14/2017,"This is the second time my friend and I went to BJs and had the same problems, so it will be the last.  We were encouraged by all the 5 star reviews recently written and hoped they had improved, but we had the same problems with slow service.  My wine was delivered almost immediately, but it took over 15 minutes to get water and the tea that was ordered at the same time.  It took forever for the server to take our food orders too.  My fish tacos which supposedly contained 'grilled' mahi mahi were so overwhelmed with cabbage salad that I didn't notice until it was too late that the fish was breaded and fried.  The pieces were so small, it was a wonder I found them at all.  So much potential and such a great menu, but it BJ's just doesn't deliver!"
Samantha N.,"Antioch, CA",119,5,,5.0,6/5/2016,"The beginning of my experience was horrible. They lost my table reservation, and they tried to make us sit in the 100 degree weather with two elderly men and a child When the restaurant was half empty. But, as soon as we were sat, our experience changed around. Craig was such an awesome server he made our experience amazing. It was my little sisters birthday and it was perfect from the moment he took our drink order. Our glasses were never empty, he was always there when needed, and he remembered her name from  only being told once. I worked at the cheesecake factory for 4 and half years, and I was a designated trainer, I know what good service looks like and he went above and beyond! I would definitely ask for him the next time! Thank you."
