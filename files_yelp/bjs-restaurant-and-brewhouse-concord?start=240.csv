Anabel A.,"Richmond, CA",0,1,,5.0,3/11/2017,This was my first time here at BJs. I will defiantly come back. The manager Douglas was very kind i loved everything he recommended. And our waiter Mel was one of the best!
Concerned C.,"Martinez, CA",2,35,,2.0,4/13/2016,"SUMMARY: My best guess is poor management with no leadership. EXPLANATION: Where to begin.... When we first started going here, they seemed pretty good. Good location with lots of staff who did their jobs, decent food, and not much competition.  In the last couple years, we noticed the service and quality have dropped significantly. Sometimes there are lots of staff, but when there are, it seems they group together and talk...mostly about how dissatisfied they are working there. Other times there are few staff, and they still talk...mostly about how dissatisfied they are there. Of course, there have always been good, hard working employees also.  A while back, we were helped by a relatively new employee there (Jake). We got to talking to him, and he explained that he came here from another BJ's location to help the manager create a better environment for the customers and employees--they ARE related. It was a great conversation that made us feel better about coming back.  The last two times we have come here, we were somewhat enthusiastic about having Jake for a server. Each time, however, he just didn't seem to care anymore. Most recently, we heard him complaining about staff. We noticed that not a single other employee came behind the bar to assist him with anything. Apparently, in turn, Jake demonstrated his unhappiness, anger, or frustration by providing us with very short and rude service....oh and the food sucked. We left the customary tip, but I do not know why... As we were leaving, we stopped outside the door to get our stuff together. There. we overheard two employees (who were on a smoke break) complaining about working there.  It is sad to see a place, that should be great (based on location, menu, and apparent backing) devolve to this level where nobody wants to be there. I can only guess that Jake tried to make the place better, but instead became a victim. Then ruined our experience.  Sad"
Jeff K.,"San Leandro, CA",0,7,,5.0,3/5/2017,"Take my elderly mother there and Douglas the manager made sure everything went well with the food ,service etc.Nice to go out to eat and people care about your service,that doesnt happen very often and when it does it makes you want to come back again ..Which we will...Thank you"
Valerie W.,"Fairfield, CA",1,8,1,3.0,9/4/2016,"My family and I had dinner today at BJ's. The food and the service were good, but I forgot to mention I have a loyalty card. I guess it's my fault, but the last few times I have eaten here I am never asked if I am a loyalty member. I think this is something that the servers should be prompted to always ask. What better w ay to ensure repeat customers, when they receive perks. In my party today there were a total of 5 adults and 1 child, we generally find a location after Church to have lunch or dinner. BJ's keep us coming back, please remind me to provide my loyalty information."
Fred P.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",22,41,97,5.0,8/20/2014,"Another wonderful meal and pleasant atmosphere.  This is still one of my favorite restaurants in the bay area.   Jambalaya again, it was cooked to perfection as always."
Isadora Q.,"Hercules, CA",255,49,142,1.0,6/6/2014,"Been here a million times but today I gotta say...worst experience EVER! Usually I get A-1 treatment :( Hubby and I ordered appetizers. ..but it came with our meal. We sat there starving waiting. Finally my spaghetti lunch combo came but the pasta was cold. The meat sauce was just a scoop or two. All bad. Im sorry but I need a little more sauce with my meal. I asked for grated cheese that came 10 min after the meal was served. Manager asked how my meal was because I had asked for extra sauce...I told her what happened. She credited me my meal. I was scared to ask for anything else in case something would happen to my meal. I was good at that point. Luckily, I had a soup and my drink. But my drink was wrong as well!  At that point the waiter was not trying to wait on us and gave us the bill. Too bad. So many ways he could be corrected all this by just taking it in stride. Every thing is a learning opportunity! But from the looks of it....this guy aint gonna last too long. Just not his forte to deal with people and  cleaning up his mistakes. I'm not counting BJs out! One bad apple didn't spoil it all for me. I will be back!"
Audrey S.,"Shasta Lake, CA",12,63,,1.0,9/5/2015,"HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE SERVICE. Iris was the only saving grace! She came over after my sis & I had been abandoned for +15 solid minutes right when being seated. She got our orders started before she was off, but that was the only decent part. Joycelynn(sp?) could have cared less about picking up where Iris left off....abrasively bringing our less-than-stellar drinks, presumptuously trying to take our not-empty plates & rudely trying to take our money before we were ready. We've been in retail & it's a slave factory with low pay, but you DOOOOON'T, DON'T DON'T not give at the very least minimal pleasantries!!! That earned her a tip and not in dollar signs. To re-iterate: We were seated. My sister went to the bathroom for 5 minutes, came back and we sat for another 10 or more watching the tumbleweeds blow by until Iris-whom deserves a raise/promotion-sympathetically came over and at least got our orders going. BLESS YOU, GIRL!! THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS NEEDS MORE EMPATHIC EMPLOYEES LIKE YOURSELF. Joycelynn....yeeeeaaaah. =__= P.S. This has nothing to do with race, but quality customer service. It could've been a Caucasian *serving* us with a great sympathetic African-American and Middle-Eastern bartender personally bringing our booze."
Martha S.,"Alameda, CA",60,28,81,2.0,7/28/2015,"After months of hearing my friends and family rave about BJ's, I finally had an occasion to visit the restaurant. There was a reservation for 8:00 pm Saturday July 25, arrived at 7:20 pm because I thought the reservation was for 7:30 pm. 8:05 the party sitting at our tables have yet to leave. 8:20 we are finally get our tables. By this time I am starving because I had not eaten in hours due to meetings and a gradation. I order the BJ's Classic Rib Eye Steak and asked it to be cooked to medium rare. When I finally received my food I was extremely disappointed. The rib eye was a horrible cut of meat,  more than 30% of the steak was gristle and fat. It was nearly impossible to cut a piece that didn't have fat on it. I did not send it back because I did not wish to wait 40 minutes for another steak. I ate 1/2 at the restaurant and took the rest home as it was too much of a hassle to finish there. I did order a peanut cookie pizookie and it was delicious.  I would like to add that our server, a slender woman with red hair (can't be 100 percent sure as the restaurant was so dark) was very nice. If it was not for her I would have given the restaurant a single star."
Kyrah A.,"Hercules, CA",127,87,31,3.0,7/1/2014,"The beer selection is great. The ambiance is nice. The staff is friendly.  The food is pretty good. I do wish they had more of a selection, but if that cuts down on the beer selection in any way, I retract my last statement."
Steve S.,"Concord, CA",61,322,116,1.0,5/28/2015,"I was starting to become a fan here. Loved the new app that lets you seat ahead waiting list and order your food ahead of time.  So this last time we tried using the app and seemed to work fine. App said you are on the active wait list that is currently 35 minutes.  So we arrive within 30 minutes to be told the wait is 45 minutes to one hour. But I said wait we checked in on the app. And I was told time does not start until you check in at counter. Wait what!?!, that is not what the app shows.  Very disappointed and probably lost my family and myself from returning."
Demetrece M.,"Oakland, CA",26,6,1,1.0,2/12/2017,If I could give 0 stars I would. I'll make this short. Worst birthday celebration EVER. Ribeye was dry our salads arrived after our meal service was slow it took 30 mins to get ranch dressing  I could go on just know I won't be coming back.  I suppose if we were drinking server would have been more attentive I noticed the tables around us recieved alot of attention and ALL of them were drinking lots of alcohol.
Shaunte P.,"San Leandro, CA",0,7,5,4.0,2/11/2016,"I work close by & frequent this BJs location for lunch. The hostess' aren't very courteous but the food is delicious & keeps me coming back. The last time I went I ordered the smothered fried chicken on top of mashed potatoes & corn, it was only $7.50 on the lunch menu. It was soooo good! The only complaint I have is the years worth of dust on the devider that splits the booths. It was pretty disgusting especially because it's at eye level when you sit down. Other than that i had a great experience,  I will jus avoid that booth area."
Andrew G.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",0,8,,4.0,2/21/2017,The customer service is always on point and one of my favorite places to go to from birthday dinners to a casual night out with friends!
Lynne C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,5,,4.0,8/9/2016,I was here last week with a group of ladies.  Prior to our arrival I read the mixed reviews so was curious to see how it was when we arrived.  Our servers were accommodating and Kayla(?) was attentive and helpful throughout our meal.   8 out of 9 of us enjoyed what we ordered and were not disappointed. Most of us would go back again.
Eddie F.,"Clayton, CA",3,5,2,5.0,8/5/2016,We have been visiting BJ's in Concord for over two years now. We eat here often as the entire family likes nearly everything on the menu and we are not hesitant to try new entrees. They change their menu on a regular basis. The service is always great as well as their brewery. It's consistently a great experience!
Janice T.,"Hercules, CA",224,589,2832,3.0,3/3/2013,"I've been meaning to return to this place ever since I tried their Pizookie.  However, my husband is not much of a fan of these types of establishments.  He only relented because we had out-of-state friends we wanted to take out for appetizers and dessert at 9pm on a Sunday evening, and this was the only decent place we know that was open late.     AMBIANCE:  I see it as a typical American chain with spacious dining area and extensive menu at moderate prices.   SERVICE:  I am docking a star because service was super slow.  Granted that we were seated right away and our server was super friendly, the food took forever to come out from the kitchen.  To think, the place was not packed as it was already 9pm.  We just ordered drinks, an appetizer sampler, and a dessert sampler for crying out loud.  We were almost finished with our drinks when the appetizer arrived.  To make things worse, after encouraging us to try the different pizookie flavors, our server forgot to put the order in.  So we waited a long time for...nothing. Major disappointment!  We had to wait another half hour for dessert.  Bummer!    DRINKS: Piranha Pint -- $5.25 Pale ale Lightswitch Lager Pint -- $5.25  Malt flavored light beer Strawberry Margarita -- $9.50  Made of Ketel One Vodka and strawberries. Strawberry Splash -- $9.25  Made of Grey Goose Vodka, Disaronno Amaretto, Piña Colada and Strawberry Puree.  I am not into alcoholic drinks, but I was able to appreciate this cocktail.   FOOD: Best Beginnings -- $16.95  Consisted of Spinach & Artichoke Dip, Mozzarella Sticks, Avocado Egg Rolls and Santa Fe Spring Rolls.  Excellent for sharing.  However, if it were just me and my husband, we would have shied away from the sampler and just picked the avocado spring roll. Pizookie Trio -- $9.50  We ordered the red velvet, chocolate chunk, and white chocolate macadamia.  The white chocolate macadamia was the best of the three.  It was as good as I remembered it.  The other two flavors were disappointing.  They were too sweet for my taste.   We should have just gone white chocolate macadamia all the way.    BILL:  Our total bill without tax was $60.71.  That's not bad for a party of four. We could have saved 50% if we didn't order drinks.  Word to the wise, go during happy hour if you want to save on drinks...duh!   :)  VERDICT:  Be prepared to wait forever for your food to arrive.  However, if you have lots of time to kill, then you'll feel right at home here."
Marissa M.,"Pittsburg, CA",0,2,,2.0,1/28/2017,"Ordering from this location is HORRIBLE! First time the girl was going to forget to give me the salad I ordered that was right behind her on the shelf so I told her to give me the salad I just paid for, she also forgot to provide me an my appetizer that i paid for and  I reliazed once I got to my destination so I had to drive all the way back. Manager was nice enough to provide me a gift card, which entails me to order togo about two weeks later... I was on hold trying to order my food for literally 30 minutes, mind you it is 12am and the restaurant is not busy at all, only about 4 tables are filled when I get there to pick up my food. I am waiting another 15 min food to be ready and to pay and than the girl says the Tomato Bisque soup I ordered is not available!!!! And to top it off I am late to my job from lunch, all because of BJ's horrible takeout system!!!!!"
Travis L.,"Honolulu, HI",19,7,,1.0,12/15/2016,"Standing waiting for a table.  There are visibly more empty tables than seated tables. At one point one of the girls was standing next to the hostess stand just talking to the host. Party of 6 who came in AFTER us (party of 4) got seated first.  When we asked the host, they couldn't find our name in the system and made like it wasn't a big deal.  No apology at all."
Ethan W.,"Walnut Creek, CA",128,39,7,1.0,4/1/2016,Food cane out cold for all 5 of us.  Took two hours to get in and out. Our drinks took 25 minutes to come to the table.  Lousiest service I've ever had. Feel neglected. Also bathroom was disgusting.  Called other staff to our table for service but the other staff also had bad service.
Christina C.,"Martinez, CA",3,10,10,2.0,3/29/2016,"To start off, it took our waitress 10-15 minutes to even come buy to take our orders for drinks. By the time we received our appetizer we had not received any silverware. We had to ask several times for our silverware while our appetizer got cold. We order the spinach stuffed mushrooms for our appetizer which was delicious."
