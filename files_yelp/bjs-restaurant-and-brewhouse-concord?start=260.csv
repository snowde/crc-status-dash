Carlo C.,"American Canyon, CA",7,52,1,4.0,8/5/2015,"Daniella was our server and she was great! She was very polite and attentive even if the food was slow to come out... As always.  And although I hate the fact that BJs at this location is notorious for their slow food service, even on a Tuesday night, I would come back if I knew that Daniella was our server. Note to BJ's: HIRE MORE KITCHEN STAFF (maybe then the timing and quality of the meals will improve)"
Scarlette H.,"Oakland, CA",0,24,2,5.0,7/24/2016,"The food was great. I especially like the chicken parm.. Everything else we ordered was great to such as the burgers, grilled cheese,and soup! The only thing is that they gave us the wrong food but then switched it and took it off the bill. They are also very nice!"
Bonnie Z.,"San Francisco, CA",336,459,632,3.0,6/22/2012,"What, a 20 minute wait on a Tuesday night?! That was a little whack, but my group of girlfriends already agreed to meet here for a birthday dinner.  FOOD - Portabella mushroom pizza: I love the strong woodsy taste of the mushrooms, but everything else was a bit lacking. I wish I tasted the basalmic vinegar sauce a bit more. - Mediterranean pizza: This one actually packed a punch of flavor! Kalamata olives, peppers, feta cheese...my friend got this one and I nibbled on it a bit. Will order this next time. - Stuffed mushrooms: a very delicious appetizer full of mushroomy, cheesy, garlicky goodness DRINKS Okay the big plus of all BJs? They have a full bar! I loved the Very Berry margarita...it was almost like an alcoholic smoothie. My friend had the Pink Cadillac--I would highly recommend if you are into citrusy drinks. SERVICE Stars come off for this section...we were scooted into a booth and it took over 15 minutes for someone to ask us about drinks! Another 15 mins passed before we got them. And our appetizers were served first without any utensils. How did they expect us to eat stuffed mushrooms without a fork? Waiting for the check took a bit longer too, although we requested it to be split in 4. ATMOSPHERE I'm used to the roominess of the Brentwood location. The aisles in this Concord spot is very awkward and narrow. It's hard to navigate to the back of the restaurant for bathroom without asking other patrons to scoot in. Talk about a traffic jam when another customer or waiter walks towards you in the opposite direction. CONCLUSION Decent place to meet up with friends for drinks; food is A-OK; I would check out other eateries in the mall or by Willow Pass Road if you want a more intimate gathering."
G-man B.,"Vallejo, CA",80,63,94,4.0,5/31/2014,"Spoiler alert, review contains puns. I'm overdue to review BJ's. Although the name references what pleasures I received in the past, but hey it crosses my mind how about you? Anywho back to the review, this place boasts beer and fine food. As I came BJ's delivered as expected and I was pleased as usual. I do recommend the IPA beer and the Mediterranean deep dish pizza. BJ's ranks among the best restaurants in the area."
Nessa P.,"Richmond, CA",84,9,,5.0,6/9/2016,"This BJ's has a lot of great servers! I've gone here for lunch a lot and every time their service is always A1. Doesn't take crazy long to get your food, plus they check on you once or twice once you do. That's always a plus for me. Also, if you're looking for a good starter, I recommend the Honey Sriracha Brussel Sprouts! Not usually a fan of the things but with honey sriracha they're delish."
Dlorean C.,"Martinez, CA",1,11,1,1.0,9/24/2015,"started off well. walked in and immediately had a spot to sit........ BUT. service was atrocious, chicken tortilla soup was luke warm and goopy and the pizza was really doughy.  At least the Pazookie was good. Hard to mess that up. Oh, and these cups sat here for about 15 mins"
Dory S.,"Concord, CA",0,12,,2.0,5/19/2016,The drink I ordered was weak as usual. The service here has continually been bad with snotty waiters and waitresses. Other than that the food is pretty good for what you pay for. If it's a busy night the service is very very slow.
Michael A.,"Concord, CA",25,3,,1.0,6/6/2016,"Service thru phone sucks, got hanged up twice trying to place an order. When i finally got my order to be picked up. No f*cks given to the take out customers. Maybe cause its take out idk. Id rather drive up to folsom to get a better service than going here in concord"
Jaydee B.,"San Francisco, CA",708,163,715,5.0,2/28/2014,"Ask for the Gluten-Free menu! Had the steak, baked potato, and salad (no crutons). I didn't try it but they also have a Gluten-Free beer. Nicely done BJ's!"
Amanda T.,"San Leandro, CA",695,318,120,3.0,2/15/2014,"Maybeeee it wasn't such a good idea to come here during Valentine's day. But anywho, I did and my experience was overall just OK. We called in ahead to reserve a spot in line and when we got there, of course there many other parties there waiting to be seated as well. The hostess gave us an option of either sitting outside at the patio or waiting for about another 45 minutes for a table inside. We opted for the patio, considering that it was 8:30 already. While waiting to be seated at the patio, there was a nice server handing everyone drinks and small slices of pizza. I thought that that was very kind of them. So, we waited for about 10 minutes because there was some disorganization, but we were finally seated. Yes, its outside, but there were heaters. At some point they turned it off and my feet were freezing.  Our server Melissa was very sweet, kind, and friendly. She really made up for the chaos that was going about in the patio. There was a giant group of about 20 (with lots of kids), a group of disgruntled older folks, and a whole lot of waiters and waitresses scurrying around. I wouldn't call this the ideal romantic Valentine's atmosphere, but I guess that's just what it is! Food: Calamari: not very fresh- I've had better. It was whatever~ Clam Chowder: creamy and full of clams. It hits the spot~ Baby Back Ribs: delicious! Tender meat that falls off the bone.You can't really mess this one up."
Kai R.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",620,495,966,4.0,2/20/2014,"Preview:  The best part of the night (and perhaps my entire life!!) was when I took the first bite of dessert... ***  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  BJ's is pretty consistent, and I like that.  I know that I can order the items I normally get time & time again in order to satisfy my cravings / expectations.  That said, tonight our stuffed mushrooms were lacking something, they just tasted different for some reason.  The calamari was just okay.  Crispy and light, but not very hot tonight; not sure how long it sat around before arriving at our table.  The scampi pasta was piping hot, which is a good sign of freshness, and it tasted just as I remember, yyaaayyy.  The young man got the crispy jalapeno burger, and he liked it, so that's fine by me.  Now he's on a virgin pina colada kick, so he had one and enjoyed it.  ***The best part of the night (and perhaps my entire life!!) was when I took the first bite of dessert... their baked beignet with fresh strawberries & vanilla, OMG OMG OMyyyGaawwsh, it was absolutely heavenly!!!  The experience is going to invade my dreams tonight and possibly every night until I have another one."
Fabiana C.,"Concord, CA",4,97,,3.0,10/20/2015,"Every time I go there there's something. The managers are really understanding though. Last time we were 3 and all our food took a very very long time and came luke warm almost cold. So they had to reheat or make again, who knows and some we ate cold because it took long enough."
Natalie R.,"Seattle, WA",266,59,275,3.0,2/23/2015,"This place always looks like they've had there electricity shut off. I understand dim lighting may set the ambiance, but its more of a friend/family restaurant and I don't plan on making out with my cousin. Also, the floors in the bar area are dangerously slippery.  Aside from that mess, the avocado egg rolls are *ahem* ON POINT making this spot a must, especially if you live in the Concord area where your dining options are limited after 10pm."
William J.,"Berkeley, CA",0,8,2,4.0,1/6/2017,Went there for some pizza for lunch.  Good service and great food.
vita k.,"Oakland, CA",156,180,79,4.0,6/15/2015,I was a first timer and wished I would have signed up for the app they have ahead of time. I really enjoyed the food and air conditioning! What I had: the chicken Parmesan or Parmesan chicken really good nice size portion.the mashed potatoes were to die for and the pizzokie..... salted Carmel yum!!!! I have to try some other things on the menu
T C.,"Oakland, CA",112,791,313,3.0,1/28/2015,"Not nearly as on it as the other BJ's in all the land. I usually love me some BJ's so, I feel badly that I don't love this location because lovin BJ's is my thing..it truly is. Took 20 mother-fuckin minutes for anyone to approach our table and it was after we flagged a few folks down. When we had a waitress who did focus on us, she was awesome. Sadly, she started at a negative because of the pre-crap. That's just the way the pizookie crumbles! I'd probably  go back since it's close enough to work to enjoy what I do happen to enjoy about BJ's (usually) but, they better get their shit together. I have an MVP card here now.. don't fuck it up!"
Mel L.,"Sacramento, CA",610,579,3201,3.0,10/6/2012,"This place is consistently good, even if the service can sometimes be sketchy. We came here for a business lunch, and I ordered a flat bread pizza with a side salad. This was just enough food...enough to fill me up, but not too much that I was afraid I'd fall asleep at my desk. The menu is so big, there is bound to be something for everybody.  Save room for a pizookie. The party size is HUGE and perfect to share with a crowd."
Angel G.,"Concord, CA",0,5,,5.0,12/15/2016,"This is my Friday night treat. The staff is great, the food is awesome, and the overall environment is just fantastic. And it's conveniently located at the mall, so once you're done stuffing your face you can go get a good walk."
Bettina D.,"Concord, CA",54,66,47,1.0,5/1/2016,"The worse experience I've had in my life. We were given the worse table,  right under the air conditioner,  which was so dusty you could've made a sweater with the dust bunnies, we requested to change tables before we even order, but we were told no, even though there were 2 tables empty next to us. The table that we requested was given to a white couple. I felt that they didn't give us that table because I am Hispanic. I felt discriminated and actually considering to sue them. We stood up and left, bad customer service in that place. My money is as green as anyone else's, so I will take my money elsewhere."
Jessie O.,"Danville, CA",52,213,81,3.0,3/4/2016,"We came here for a birthday celebration. We were disappointed upon arrival to find out that the happy hour specials are only good in the bar area while we were already seated at a table. I was trying to eat healthy, so I appreciated the calorie information on all the items. I was surprised to spend $20 on a starter salad and an entree. No dessert. No drink. That's more the price I expect to pay for 2 people. At least our server was nice and split our checks."
