Kara L.,"Fairfield, CA",19,20,20,5.0,5/21/2015,"I thoroughly enjoyed this restaurant tonight.  I called ahead to be put on the ""preferred waiting list"" and it worked out perfectly. I like that.  Scott our waiter was very nice, kind and patient especially will my busy kids.  ""and he's cute"".  Our food was good.  Kids ordered the pizza and mini burgers.  They ate it all.  My husband ordered the bacon cheeseburger and of course it was good.  I ordered the blackened shrimp tacos....EXCELLENT!  And for dessert we had a variety of the Pizookie Trio.  Oooooh, so good.  We didn't leave anything on the table.  Price was good so that I can leave more than 15% tip.  My second time trying BJ's and the rest the family the first time they tried it.  We will be back on Thursdays for our family night outing. Thanks BJ!"
Shantel W.,"El Sobrante, CA",48,16,,5.0,3/24/2016,"Great strong drinks, great food, great service for a large chain. Went on a Saturday afternoon so 5 minute wait. We enjoyed ourselves...service can be iffy some servers are kinda rude ours was great...."
Run C.,"Corona, CA",4,13,9,3.0,4/1/2015,"BJs is like a white frat boy who just recently graduate a prestigious Ivy League without learning anything useful so he rides his father's coat tails to a cushy wall street job. He tries his best to up his game and exude quality in his work. However, his attempts usually fall short, disingenuous, and tries to salvage the attempt by putting a humorous spin on his shortcomings. I'm rather confused as to what kind of restaurant this is. Is it a place for dinner? No, its too casual. Is it a place for lunch? Sure, if two hour lunches are part of your company policy. Just like the unfortunate millennial generation, it's surviving on handouts from their middle class parents.  If you've been to on BJ, you've been to them all. Almost everything down to the servers are the same at every BJ. I'm not convinced that they're an equal opportunity employer.  Ok, down to business. I use to think the food is less than acceptable. However today, I thought the food was good. I ordered a rib eye steak, medium rare with soup and mash potatoes. I enjoyed the meal. It's worth another visit if I get another coupon. I recommend ordering your meal ahead of time if you don't want to wait a long time for your food.  +1 star: Order was correct, and the food was tasty.  +1 star: Service was fine. The waiter came by a few times to check on us and remembered all our requests.  +1 star: Online ordering option for take out and dinning in.  Lastly, I don't get the Pazooki. It's just a large chocolate chip cookie with two scoops of vanilla ice cream. People treat this as the best invention since sliced bread. I've had ample opportunity to try it in the past and on all occasions I've been puzzled by the attraction people have to this strange desert. It's almost pure profit for the restaurant. That's why they always push this dish. I'd rather save the money and get a nicer entree."
Jenna T.,"East Bay, CA",419,620,1266,4.0,1/11/2014,"Went here with family and got seated at the outside patio. It was very warm thanks to their heaters. We waited for some time and then finally had to ask if we even have a server.  Our waitress came out and she was super helpful and very cheerful. She definitely added to our dining experience.  The food was good but it took awhile for it to get to us. The patio wasn't spacious at all, good thing it wasn't crowded or else we would've been very uncomfortable. Either there were too many tables or the chairs took up too much space. I was literally arms length to the table next to us."
Jocelyn T.,"Hercules, CA",363,807,1133,3.0,3/22/2015,"First time eating at BJ's at the sunvalley location. Ordered their sliders with fries and ahi poke appetizer plate. The sliders were a good size for mini burgers. Usually when I order sliders they come in rolls but the these sliders actually came in buns but smaller then a regular bun. The plate came with a side of pickles and lettuce but had to ask for ketchup and mayo from the server. I'd skip the poki. Totally flavorless, what a waste! Service was a bit slow especially getting our checks. For some reason they turned up the A/C in the restaurant and was very uncomfortable hence I knocked off one star."
Denise E.,"Carmichael, CA",78,2,,1.0,8/1/2016,"Very disappointed in this restaraunt!  We have gone there 4 times now. Each time it just keeps getting worse. We will NOT be going back to that restaraunt again!!  The service is slow. The waiters(waitresess) don't keep the drink filled, always have to ask for a refill. We went there for dinner one time and ordered a meal that said it had bottomless fries when we asked our waiter for more fries he said it was only at lunch time. When it didn't say anywhere on the menu that the bottomless fries were only for lunch time. I have been to other BJ's and the service at those are 1000% better!!  Today we went for lunch and my husbands fork was dirty had to ask for a clean one and they took 10 min to bring us a clean one. They weren't that busy and it took 45 min to get our lunch. My husband and I both ordered sandwiches which don't take forever to make!  Today our waitress came ip to take our order and all I could smell was cigarette smoke. I don't care if you smoke but I don't want to smell that when you are taking my order and it gave me an INSTANT MIGRAINE!!  I had to take Ibuprofen instantly!  Had to ask her for refills on our drinks. And where our food was because they were taking way too long!!   We won't be going back to this BJ's!!  VERY DISAPPOINTING!!"
Ro O.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",18,10,,1.0,12/6/2014,"1- Spinach and artichoke dip was dry and not creamy and tasted bland. 2- Calamari was not fully cooked because they were stuck together and my daughter said, 'I'm wondering if this is really Calamari?' 3- My daughter liked their fresh squeezed strawberry lemonade  4- Steamed broccoli didn't taste good, tasted stale 5- The steaks were decent. 6- Wedged seasoned fries was okay. 7- Mashed potatoes was a little dry"
Jeff W.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",18,19,,2.0,10/21/2016,"BJ's quality of food or service would have to be way over the top to make the hassle of trying to park at this location worthwhile.  Neither is.  We only came because it's near our house and we had a gift certificate.  The bar was nearly full with only one bartender, who wasn't in any particular hurry.  Took nearly 10 minutes just to get a beer.  The guy next to us had been waiting far longer for his buffalo wings.  The food is standard chain cuisine, though a little pricier than most.  Nothing special about the entrees.  The manager would not honor our gift certificate because we did not spend enough on food.  We won't be returning in any case.  There are other BJ's locations that have much higher standards."
Mike P.,"Vallejo, CA",1,35,54,4.0,6/19/2015,"Came here for my birthday dinner with my familia and the wait wasn't too long, maybe 5-10 min. Wasn't too packed, went in around 6 o'clock for dinner time. For our appetizer we had the lettuce wraps which were surprisingly very good and also we got the poki which was on point also. I ordered the bison burger and it tasted okay. I ordered it medium so it could be nice and juicy but it came out a little dry and the bread was soggy. Overall the experience was good but I would find a better main course next time."
Gian C.,"Alamo, CA",0,2,,1.0,11/11/2016,"The food was decent, the service was okay, and the plates were disgusting. After two times of asking for new ones, we were still delivered with dirty plates. It was unacceptable. I had to ask 4 different times for a glass of water. It must have taken 20 minutes. I am never recommending this place, nor coming back"
Niraj L.,"Sunnyvale, CA",2,7,4,1.0,6/13/2015,Good drinks and Appetizers. The worst deep dish pizza ever. It had more bread than the bread bowl and the toppings were not properly cooked. The manager were good enough to help. Best part was the yummy Ghirardelli Pizookie
Leah Anne B.,"Oakland, CA",86,91,81,3.0,4/2/2015,"My boyfriend and I recently visited for dinner. Service was kind of slow for a weeknight. They forgot to give napkins, utensils, extra plates and even the lemon in the ""water with lemon"" that I asked for. I wasn't really too satisfied about that. Our server was really nice though. And food was okay. Their food is good but nothing really special about it. It's an okay restaurant. Tip though, be a BJ's Premier Rewards member, it's free. They send you coupons and you earn points every time you use your rewards card."
Teo D.,"Martinez, CA",196,55,134,3.0,3/26/2016,Good thing about this place is that it has many selections to choose from.  The pozookie dessert is a nice treat. If only the service was better.  A little slow but they continue to try every year since I have been going here.
Tiff W.,"San Francisco, CA",322,1286,143,2.0,11/23/2015,"Very disappointed at the bar service, super slow and it took a while to flag someone down, she was just in front of me as well. Annoyed by the whole experience."
Michael C.,"Suisun City, CA",0,4,,5.0,11/5/2016,"We had an amazing time! James was our server and was very entertaining! Just to be able to talk story with him about our jobs was great! It couldn't get any better. James, thanks so much for making our night even better!"
Jack L.,"Milpitas, CA",582,57,17,4.0,11/25/2015,"Hailey B. Is by far the best server I have ever encountered at Bj's and I am a frequent diner. Her customer service is phenomenal. She is friendly, personable and very attentive to us. Thank you Hailey for making our thanksgiving eve dinner a memorable one!!"
Mike D.,"Benicia, CA",762,96,208,3.0,11/21/2014,"I swore I wouldn't come back after the last time I was here and I was hesitant to come here tonight, but they redeemed themselves. They have a broad menu and it really makes a difference in what you order.  Some things they make better than others. They have some new items on their menu.  One new item I tried was the deep fried artichokes as an appetizer.  These were great. For the main part of the meal, I ordered the BJ's Favorite deep dish pizza and it was good too. I like the dark wood interior, the seats are comfortable, and I like the televised sports on multiple TVs. The experience was much improved over the last time I visited and I will likely come back."
Zach R.,"Lake Jackson, TX",2,7,5,1.0,12/30/2015,"After waiting for 10 minutes, we were finally given a table, even though there were multiple tables open right in front of us. Once we were seated, our waiter came after another elongated period of time. We didn't receive any silverware until halfway through our dinner. The soup was lukewarm, and our dinner didn't come with the complete items as said on the menu."
Sisi H.,"Concord, CA",2,32,10,1.0,8/12/2016,"I'm done with BJs. The service never improved so I started ordering takeout. My experiences ranged from tolerable to decent and they usually got the order correct. Recently I've experienced issues not receiving my side dishes that go with my entree so I've made a point to review the items before I leave (I really should be able to trust that THEY are capable of doing this, it's part of their job). Today I had my husband pick up the order and he got home with it and sure enough: they forgot my side dish (soup). I had been really looking forward to that so I was incredibly disappointed. My husband called to speak to a manager and was put on hold for 15 minutes with no explanation. He hung up and redialled and spent another 10 until he was able to get through a manager to get us a refund on my order. Honestly the food is not worth the headache I go through with them. This was the last straw for me."
Dana H.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,7,3,5.0,5/11/2016,Don't know how this doesn't have a fove star! It's so yummy and drinks are always reasonable. Staff is great
