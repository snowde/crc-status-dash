Bonnie S.,"San Francisco, CA",446,220,248,2.0,12/23/2013,"Never understood the long waits for food that was just ok. The only saving grace is the red velvet pizookie, coming from someone that doesn't even care for red velvet all that much. And note to the wait staff: if our waters are empty and you make us feel unwanted and uncomfortable, YOU'RE NOT DOING YOUR JOB. We still tipped over 18% though. You're welcome."
Mona Linda R.,"Vacaville, CA",0,5,1,2.0,9/16/2015,"Service was crap. Unprofessional server. Literally told my husband what he ordered wasn't a good choice and it gets sent back a lot. Took the order wrong and then when we brought it up she said ""oh, shit!"". This place has gone down hill!"
Shane C.,"San Ramon, CA",65,175,38,4.0,1/9/2016,I had tried another BJs and was very dissapointed so I had avoided going to another one for fear of the same bad experience. It was Christmas eve and my wife had heard the pizza here was great so we decided to give it a try.  We sat at the bar and found out it was happy hour.  Great drink prices and discounts on the small deep dish pizzas.  We both ordered our own and they were lights out good.  I had pinapple jalapeño and pepperoni and I polished it off.  This is a happy hour we will revisit.  The lesson here is do not judge an entire chain by one bad restaurant.
Patrick M.,"Concord, CA",0,23,,4.0,2/19/2016,"A favorite among my group. Takes awhile to be seated, but its pretty busy usually. Food is decent, nothing special, but the service here is great and the pizookies are good. Definitely would recommend"
Terri N.,"Concord, CA",532,725,2900,4.0,3/20/2013,"BJ's has been open at Sun Valley Mall for a few years now, and I swear they have been packed ever since.  Definitely the most popular restaurant at this mall - if you're dining at peak times, be prepared to wait!   But every bite will be well worth it.  BJs is a conundrum - a gigantic menu but I've only sampled a handful of items because what I've had is so darn good I can't wait to go back and order it again!  Nevertheless, some highlights: GRILLED CHICKEN CLUB - Delicious decadent sandwich, put over the top by being served on what sure do taste like garlic bread.  My first and still favorite!   AHI POKE - Presented as an app but I have made this my entrée plenty of times.  Always fresh and delicious! CHICKEN TORTILLA SOUP - Epic and delicious, made super special by their unique presentation.  You receive a large soup bowl filled with the chicken, chips, cheese and other goodies, and the soup is poured by your server over all the goodies from a little kettle.  It really preserves the integrity of the chips and cheese, nothing arrives soggy.  I was very impressed.   BLACK & BLEU FLATBREAD - A really good portion of yummy steak and blue cheese in pizza form - brilliant!   PORTABELLO/BALSAMIC DEEP DISH PIZZA- Doesn't seem to be on the menu anymore which is a shame, because this was EPIC.  Sitting at the bar with a glass of good wine, chatting with good company and munching on this pizza -  life doesn't get much better.  BRING IT BACK!!   ENLIGHTENED HAWAIIAN MAHI-MAHI - So tasty!  While you definitely know you're eating a healthy dish compared with all the French fries and cheese that will be all around you, there is no shortage of yum on this plate of food.  I loved it! BBQ BISON BURGER (from the Enlightened menu) - Wonderful!  Delicious perfectly seasoned and well cooked burger patty, topped with pico de gallo, roasted pepper, with a side of slaw.  Tastier than their regular burgers, seriously! And of course, Pizookies!  The original, gluten-free and triple chocolate are all SO good, super indulgent and enough for I'd say 4 people to have a good couple bites.  Seriously one of the best dessert options in any restaurant I could name in the area.  So thank you BJ's for great meals, and more to come! PS - There is an excellent photo op in the parking lot, signs for their curbside takeout that read ""Parking for BJs only"".  Yep I went there.  ;)"
Janine G.,"Concord, CA",0,4,,5.0,6/22/2015,"I normally don't review a restaurant were the food is so mediocre, but our server was so good, it made up for the blandness of everything else.  I think his name was Kenan, we all asked for his name,wanted to be sure we are seated in his area whenever we go and since my family likes to come here, I am forced to put up with the lack of good food, we were there for Fathers Day! Once again Kenan saved it. Attentive, and professional and seemed like it was important to him that we had a good experience."
Tony H.,"San Ramon, CA",64,8,,1.0,3/24/2015,Went to BJ's tonight for dinner with a friend we ordered  Barbecue  bchicken salad waited 20 minutes for my salad to Arrive there is no chicken in my chicken salad Service was very bad The manager did not care or did not offer anything at all so we lift very poor experience  The place is a joke
Diana T.,"San Francisco, CA",16,102,8,2.0,11/16/2014,"Not a good option. First off, the food took FOREVER to get there and the place wasn't even packed. The servers were nice enough. The problem is with whoever is cooking the food.  We ordered beer, the stuffed mushrooms (which were decent and the only reason this gets 2 stars!), a deep dish pizza (TINY!!! tasted ok I guess...but it's really small!) and scallops dish (which I sent back immediately) and replaced that with the bison burger.  Whatever the scallops were drenched in smelled really bad. The asparagus was cooked all wrong so you couldn't really eat it.  Bison burger - I came out smelling like nothing but onions. Too much onions. They should've grilled the onions at least, it would've tasted SO much better. I felt like I just wanted to go back there and tell them how to cook it. They also included ""cole slaw"" - that was not cole slaw -_-..... it was some wierd salad thing (without the right sauce) made out of parsley, carrots and probably more onions. I brushed my teeth twice - still taste onions :(  This place is crap."
Abby L.,"Pinole, CA",2,9,2,4.0,9/4/2016,"I really do enjoy BJS but the one problem I had his time was with the hostess at the front who referred to my friends and I as ""these ones"". Maybe an honest mistake but very unprofessional and rude."
John P.,"Berkeley, CA",19,198,6,3.0,1/7/2015,I have to drop them from 5 stars to 3.  They served me what they said was a deep dish pizza.... It was abysmal is what it was.  They still get 3 stars because I will come back and stick to the thin dish but wow.  When you are there google deep dish pizza images and compare them to what you get.  It's not the same.  Their deep dish is more like a thick crust pizza.  They increase the pie pan size but keep the amount of ingredients the same.
L T.,"San Pablo, CA",154,59,547,4.0,11/5/2013,"Celebrated a friends birthday here couple days ago. I forgot how busy this place gets so make reservations before hand.  This place is usually pretty busy no matter what day it is & the wait can be anywhere from 10-45 minutes depending on the day and how big the party. For us, we only had 4 people and waited 40 minutes. Good thing there was a bar and outdoor public seatings. Lol. The pizza is one of the best choices to get. I love the calamari appetizer.  For the drinks I loved the ""A drink like that"" ( Must try ) & the ultimate long islands. But just about any drink is delicious so you wont be disappointed.  The servers are pretty amazing depending on the days. Free pizookie on your birthday !"
Gwen H.,"Moraga, CA",0,5,4,3.0,3/25/2016,"Decent prices, nice atmosphere and really great service.  Numerous food and drink selections (maybe a bit too many items to choose from).  Food was decent, but not rave-worthy.  It's your basic american fare."
Tarah M.,"San Jose, CA",114,51,6,1.0,7/25/2014,"I'd leave negative stars if I could!!  Only positive is we didn't have to wait for a table...probably because people know better!  10 minutes to get a glass of water.  20 minutes to get a cup of coffee.  $12.95 for what they call a Cobb salad consisting of a mediocre bowl of shredded romain lettuce, mystery cubed meat they call turkey, sprinkled with bacon & feta... When said salad was complained about and a manager was sent over, both manager & waitress agreed the salad appeared subpar when talking cost/quality ratio - yet the manager offers to take our credit card for payment (without us seeing the bill) and runs it for full charge of all disappointing costs!!  My advice to BJs...quit spending so much money on your extravagant building aesthetics and allocate it to proper employee training and education about the importance of customer service!  Rant over. Mic drop. OUT!"
Val F.,"Rodeo, CA",28,5,3,1.0,10/26/2015,"My husband and I dropped in for breakfast and were so disappointed. The food, especially the avocado, appeared old. It looked as though someone had taken a bite out of my eggs. My husband had two pieces of bacon; one burnt and one raw. The manager came and took our plates away without a word. The server asked us to come back for dinner...it would be better. Really?"
Craig H.,"Walnut Creek, CA",159,165,197,3.0,11/30/2014,This is a good place to come if you're looking to eat a sandwich or a flatbread pizza.  One of my favorite things to eat there is the Barbeque Pulled Pork.  They have many different types of house drafts also.  For dessert you need to have a Pizookie it's the best thing to eat here and my favorite is the Triple Chocolate Pizookie made with Ghirardelli chocolate.   Overall the servers are pretty nice but the service is just average.
Monica G.,"Martinez, CA",0,3,,5.0,3/19/2016,"What can I say about BJ's? This has been my go to place for practically every week for either lunch or dinner. The staff's are always so kind and helpful, they always have the biggest smile on their faces. Which is always a great quality to have , as well as one of the manager( the younger one) is always so genuine and helpful. While, the older manager( with all due respect), was extremely rude. However, one guy doesn't have to ruin it for everyone, right ? Also, the take out service is always so quick and helpful!!!! I recommend this place highly."
Trang T.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",61,69,52,3.0,1/30/2015,"I've been to the BJ's in the Sacramento area and they seemed like a totally different restaurant. I only come to BJ's whenever my friends have a last minute plan to come together to get some drinks and eats. Although their entrees are average and seemingly generic to me, I think their forté is their appetizer selection. I really like their artichoke and spinach dip, and their fried calamari is really crispy and good. They have a good selection of drinks, but that's to be expected from a restaurant that specializes in homemade brews. My current favorite is the Gulden Draak Ale. As for the quality of service, expect some delays. Not sure what the reason is, but I always end up waiting a long time for my food. During the later hours, you go in and seat yourself, and it costs an arm or a leg to get the attention of a server. I don't think the atmosphere would be appropriate for a family with small children, especially because the frequent goers range from rambunctious high school students to stressed out white collared workers who wanna let loose at the bar."
Anna M.,"Livermore, CA",38,74,91,3.0,9/10/2015,Ooops! Wrong location. For my prior review; that was for the Livermore/Dublin location. Leaving the average number of stars here so it won't effect rating.
M S.,"Hercules, CA",1,23,,1.0,2/19/2016,"How is it possible to wait 15 minutes for a table, another 15 for a waiter, then another 10 to get water in a practically empty restaurant?  After our third wait we decided to leavw. We asked to speak to a manager on our way out, and after 10 minutes of waiting (again...) we finally left.  If you have time to spare, I'm sure this would be a great place but the service was slower than molasses."
Ron L.,"Concord, CA",393,716,439,2.0,12/14/2012,"A very solid two-star place. I actually had little interest in going here.  On the outside, it seems like a bar-and-nightclub experience, not a place to take little ones.  Then Big Joe, a friend of mine from house church who's also a Yelper, told me ""Nah, nothing bad about it.  I take my kids there a lot.""  When my daughter won a coupon for BJ's at her school, there was our reason to go. Well, Big Joe was right.  It's more of a restaurant.  Sorta loud, like a place were you go hang out with the boys after work, or a girls night out with margaritas.  Not bad for kids, and they have a kids menu.  Similar to what I've heard about Hooters, this atmosphere is better than it looks. It looks like the bar takes up the entire long side of the wall;  I could be wrong on that.  But the drinks are stacked in shelves all the way to near the top of the high ceiling.  And the first five pages of the menu are their drinks.  Yep, they take their beer seriously, not too good for a non-alky like me. Food looks kinda uppercrusty, with prices to match.  Both my wife and I had chicken-fried steak, came with lots of vegetables;  I wasn't impressed.  We had to wait a long time to be seated, so I guess people come here for some reason other than the food.  Then the bill came - and the dollars-off coupon wasn't included! I'll sum it up by quoting my hunny:  ""Well, I always wanted to try BJ's once.  Once is enough!"""
