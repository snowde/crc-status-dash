Jim C.,"Danville, CA",19,34,4,3.0,12/20/2015,"I have eaten here for both lunch and dinner on multiple occasions.  Poor service and slow delivery of food. On several occasions, we ended up eating at the bar after waiting in excess of the time the hostess gave us for a table."
Joshua P.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,,5.0,3/7/2016,"The service was great, the clam chowder bowl was a amazing , way better than Boudin. Delicious tons of clams and they made the top into garlic bread and ran the whole thing  through the oven sooo good."
Angela H.,"Richmond, CA",52,728,181,3.0,8/1/2013,"So I've been here a number of times now, and their service has been a lot slower... once I came with a large group, and we happened to have a waitress in training, so she was shadowing another server. They BOTH wrote down our orders, but still it was wrong for three people, and everything took over an hour before it came out. Another time was during their late night happy hour, after 10pm, so the restaurant is nearly empty, but service was slow again, too... Food, however, is good. And their happy hour food specials are worth it."
Gabe H.,"Concord, CA",0,1,,2.0,9/4/2016,"The food is good but the hostess who answered the phone her name was Gabrielle she was very rude when I called and asked to explain what a call ahead was, then rudely hung up after she was done explaining what it was, this is unacceptable and I hope bjs has a better way of greeting their customers."
Terry T.,"Hercules, CA",306,1291,384,4.0,11/15/2012,"We had another opportunity to have a Veterans Day meal because the legal holiday fell on Monday, and BJ's offered lunch on both days.  After I read both Eric B. and Janice T. reviews I was sure I we would enjoy lunch and then I read Ivy R. review for the root beer for adults and I knew this was the only place I wanted to go. It was busy at lunch. I think they might have a stroller brigade that lunches here as there were at least six strollers parked inside near the door.  I found the interior of the restaurant a bit too dark for a midday meal. We ate outside and the heaters made it pleasant. S had salmon on pilaf and a cup of clam chowder and I had the glazed chicken teriyaki. The food was good and I liked the taste of the clam chowder a lot.  I also had the Irish Root Beer for adults. This tasty drink is made with Jameson Irish Whiskey, Baileys Irish Cream, Butterscotch Schnapps and BJ's Handcrafted Root Beer and served in a frosty glass.  I really liked it a lot and I am sure happy I read Ivy's review and did not order something else"
Carina L.,"Merrill, OR",0,2,,5.0,3/3/2016,"Such great service! I love it here. Definitely recommend. Waitress was very friendly, and offered recommendations from the menu, and have great overall knowledge about what the items on the menu looked liked, and how popular they were."
Mo L.,"El Cerrito, CA",0,63,1,1.0,9/7/2015,"Dropped in for a snack always having been satisfied before. Ordered Sliders and Macaroni. Sliders were worst ever with soggy undercooked meat and stale buns, My dog might even reject them! Macaroni was dry and tasteless with little cheese. $20. for this Crap! Please!!"
Kassi O.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",0,25,32,1.0,1/18/2016,"They just gave themselves up. I used to like coming here. But lately they have been very disappointing. The food and drinks are terrible, service was slow. When we told the waitress the food was not that good she didn't give a f. Won't be back again."
Jose R.,"Pittsburg, CA",0,6,1,1.0,8/31/2016,We came ad a group  of 7 couple....our server was nice she took our drink order and right after took our  food order. We waited about 30 minutes to get our drinks and hoestly I think it was because I asked a different waiter to bring drinks because we had been waiting for a while.
w m.,"Pinole, CA",0,40,4,4.0,10/1/2015,Went back to BJ 's today for first time in weeks. The service was extremely good and our waiter Antonio Mora was great. He anticipated our needs/ brought the food in a timely manner and seemed to serve all tables quickly and efficiently. This was quite impressive as the restaurant was packed.  Food as usual was good and prices fair. Will be going back again soon.
Adyson S.,"Grand Lake, Oakland, CA",58,74,62,1.0,11/12/2014,"After my most recent encounter with this place, I will NEVER go back.  I get that all big chain restaurants like this one are not healthy in the least bit, but when you don't really have ANY vegetarian options besides salad and fried cheese, i'll pass.  I went for brunch with a co-work and ordered an omelette that came with an addition of HAIR. GROSS, sent it back waited 45 minutes to have another dish come that has MEAT. When I stated that I just wanted the same thing. The server kept bringing the wrong beverages to our table (I only asked for water, and got soda?!?)  WASTE of money, and I would like to live rather than have a heart attack from too much sodium."
Olga L.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,4,,2.0,8/6/2016,"I go to bj's in Concord, California. Food is good, but they have an ongoing problem washing the dishes. I always see some lipstick on the glass or sugar at the rim of the tea cup. So, if you are not afraid of diarrhea, you should be fine ."
Loren J.,"San Pablo, CA",12,9,55,2.0,5/25/2015,"Wow let me just start off saying....WOW!!! So I come here with my mom and my brother after a long day of shopping and getting new phones (which was stressful enough!!!!) to sit down and enjoy a meal cause yknow what's better than spending quality time with your family??? Hmmm well first of all we enter the restaurant and tell the person in the front our name so they could call it when the table was ready. Ten to fricking fifteen minutes pass and all we see is ppl who came in after us getting seated so we were like ummmm are you serious?? Is this a racial thing?? Probably. So the same front person that took are name asks ""are you guys ready to check in?"" Me being a hardcore yelper took it the wrong way so I didn't really understand what that meant but my mom was like UM ya we already checked us in. IT WAS THE SAME GIRL THAT CHECKED US IN BUT SHE SOMEHOW ""FORGOT"" ABOUT US. I am putting quotes bc this is probably has something to do with race. The fact that that was how our lunch started showed a lot. Okay so after we order our food and all that stuff we get our calamari, salad, and flatbread while I got my Cali chicken sandwich. What disappointed me the most was the calamari bc I know what good calamari is and that was NOT good calamari. It was cold and not crunchy at all which really disappointed me bc I love calamari so much. Another thing was their water!! It tasted weird and had a slightly odd after taste to it but maybe it was just the drought effecting our water but who knows! Anyway we were so disappointed we didn't even want dessert. I am sorry BJs but maybe you should change your name to ""restaurant with racist service and terrible calamari"""
Janelle A.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",11,9,4,1.0,8/22/2014,"If I could give this place 0 stars I would or even negative stars. And it's weird to say that because I'm honestly very understanding and patient when it comes to going out to eat, and I understand how difficult it is to be a waitress so I don't mind patiently waiting to order.  The first horrible service I received is when my boyfriend and I decided to eat here. We were seated promptly but then everything after was just bad. Not only were everyone else getting served around us it took us probably 15 min to get served water and so we ordered right away. Our waiter is no where to be found, and I keep reassuring my boyfriend that they are probably busy and try to get our minds off the wait. But after hunting down our waiter about our food, he tells us it should be out in a bit. AND 35-40 min later NOTHING. No water refill or anything, we give them another 5 min. And still nothing, so we finally walked out.  I decided to go again w my family after we had a baseball game to give them the benefit of the doubt. And while our waiter was a young guy who communicated very well w my family. I just don't understand how LITERALLY every member of my family gets their food and of course my small deep dish pizza is no where to be found. My family ordered 2 other pizzas which already arrived, and the guy didn't even check to make sure we had all out food. We had to tell him about our food and he said he'll check on it. Then another 15 min later nothing so I tell him to cancel it. I am soooo pissed about this place I can't even explain. I tell everyone I know not to go here because of how horrible it is and that's saying a lot for me.  Stay away from the concord bjs , but if you want great food and great service fr bjs go to Vacaville and you WILL not be disappointed."
Jess S.,"Mountain View, CA",25,51,7,3.0,10/28/2014,"First of all, I think the food here is a pretty decent, like 3.5 or 4 stars depending on what you order. Their avocado roll appetizers are super tasty, and personally, I thought my order of cajun chicken pasta was pretty tasty. My grandma though, ordered a cheeseburger and it was really really sad looking. It was also missing the cheese and the spread that they asked her if she wanted to put on. Oops.  But the real kicker was that they had ads for this really sweet looking pumpkin fireball drink on the table, but the waitress didn't tell us they didn't actually have pumpkin beer (even though it was a Thursday) until we tried to actually order it. It was like omg what, why couldn't you tell us this sooner. Thank goodness they have other tasty beers, but it was still kind of disappointing. Service overall was just kind of really blah; not bad enough to make me never want to come again, but definitely not good.  You could probably get better service at Red Robin's, but the non-burger foods at BJ's (and the beer) are definitely better (but more expensive)."
Melody C.,"Concord, CA",0,14,,5.0,7/6/2014,BJ's always has great food and good atmosphere.  A great place to start the night with there signature beers or have brunch in the morning.
Caio M.,"Corte Madera, CA",0,5,,4.0,8/20/2016,"The place is ok. Been there feel times and like the food, customer service can be a problem sometimes."
Semon J.,"Arlington, VA",2,17,138,5.0,6/14/2014,"Best dinner of my life  We here for my birthday in June 2014. It was amazing. The service was very nice, the food was wonderful  YOU GOT TO TRY PIZOOKIE!!! absolutely great"
Naomi S.,"Pittsburg, CA",6,37,19,3.0,6/8/2015,"Like everyone in the area, I've been to BJs numerous times because I like their food and ambiance. Because of this, I decided to throw my fiancé a surprise birthday on Sunday, June 7 since their outdoor patio would accommodate our 40+ headcount. Let's get to it: Positives: -Manager Michael Gatto took the time to speak with me over the phone and go over my selected family-style menu for the day. He even offered to provide our 7 kids complimentary cheese pizzas! So nice! -Tables were set up and ready for our guests before our 1:30PM reservation time so no one had to wait to be seated! -Michael Gatto came out to the patio to introduce himself to me since we had spoke and emailed over the phone. He asked how everything was going and wanted to greet my fiancé. I thought that was great customer service and I appreciated that he wanted to meet his guests! -Our servers Ceci and Dijonae carried themselves well. They didn't look stressed out handling such a large party and they always had a friendly smile on their face. I enjoyed talking to them very much! Negatives -The planning phase was terrible due to lack of communication. I emailed BJs on two separate occasions regarding their menu but did not receive a response. I also called BJs on two other occasions and left my name and number but received no call back. It wasn't until my third email that Michael Gatto got back to me (I should note that Michael was not the initial manager who helped me. Alyssa Alvarado was the dining manager who helped me book my reservation and sent me an email with the menu. I never heard back from Alyssa after I tried to contact via email and phone). -The entrees I ordered were suppose to be prepared on four different plates so that they could be placed on four separate tables to be shared family style. Instead, the entrees were prepared on one or two plates which required my guests to stand up and pass the plate to another table. Very inconvenient on a hot June day outside where space was limited. After the first few times this happened it was later corrected for subsequent entrees. -Since I had sent Michael Gatto the exact entree and quantity of each dish I wanted via email, and since he confirmed everything, I didn't expect there to be any hiccups with my receipt so I signed and left. I was wrong. When I got home I reviewed the receipt and noticed that I was actually charged for the cheese pizzas that were suppose to be complimentary. I also noticed that the quantities of each dish I ordered were incorrect (they were less). It was such a busy day that I'm not even sure if my guests just didn't receive all the food I had ordered, or if I received a discount. I doubt it's the latter because I saw nothing complimentary on my receipt.  Although Michael Gatto was helpful, and our servers Ceci and Dijionae were great, my overall experience with planning a large party at BJs is three stars. There were just too many problems during the planning phase and the day-of the celebration for me to overlook. I still think BJs is a good restaurant and I would return, but I would never plan a large celebration here again."
Marck N.,"Emeryville, CA",138,1039,58,2.0,12/7/2012,"It's a chain restaurant. My experience here for lunch was average.  I've had better service at another location.  Our server was nice, but not attentive.   When my party's food came out, dishes were mixed up and the soups ordered were cold. They corrected it, but considering it wasn't busy, there really wasn't any excuse for the mishaps.    Maybe dinner service would be better, but I don't think I will be visiting this location soon."
