Chad P.,"Crockett, CA",4,132,38,2.0,7/4/2013,"Not going to complain about the slow service because it was 4th of July and they may have been understaffed.  Above all though this is a beer place and they need to get this right because I am a beer guy and I went here for beer. I am like Benjamin Blue of Forrest Gump fame except I go on and on about beer rather than shrimp. I was happy to see they had a tap of Pilsner Urquell. I ordered a pitcher, but when it came 35 minutes later it was a pitcher of IPA. Not a bad IPA but not what I was looking forward to. I told the waitress a mistake had been made. Twenty minutes later she brought me another pitcher of the same IPA. I told her the wrong keg must be connected to the Pilsner Urquell tap and settled down to drink a pitcher of IPA. A second waitress/assistant manager came by and asked me about it. I told her the kegs were likely crossed and she said she would check on it. Thirty minutes we flagged the second waitress down to ask about the kegs. She reports the bartender reported to her that the kegs were connected correctly. Here I sit with the aftertaste of American hops on my tongue and the feeling of grief that a perfectly good second pitcher of IPA or possibly a strong Pale Ale had to be poured down the drain. Also the the belief that the draft lines were never checked. Food was not bad but Cobb salad is not Cobb salad without blue cheese. July 13 update The real Pilsner Urquell can be enjoyed at DJ's Bistro in Concord."

Miss C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,58,,1.0,1/17/2015,"Have been to other BJ's locations with great experiences. Went to this one tonight, the margarita was WEAK and overly sweet, the potato skins were chalky & gross, they literally disintegrated into a pile if powder when you cut into them. Waiter left us for long periods of time. Asked other waitstaff for help, they said they were ""looking for him too"". Nice. Screwed up both of our orders...(2 cheeseburgers, one with fries, one with salad), and they both came out wrong (and brought out by a different waiter). Pretty simple...asked for one plain, and one with onion strings.  The plain one showed up with all toppings, and they put the onions for the other one on top of the caesar salad instead of the burger (WTF?!) Had to send back.  Then we had some other guy come over, I assume the manager but he didn't introduce himself, asking us what was wrong with the order. We told him, he was apologetic, but then just walked away without comment. Then we were left again another 15 minutes. Empty drinks & dirty appetizer plates just sat on the table. Flagged down yet another waitress, asked to order 2 more drinks, she said she'd order for us.  Original waiter came by, with attitude asked what was wrong with our order, then just walked away.  Another 15 minutes, no drinks. Yet ANOTHER waitress finally brought our corrected food. We asked to cancel the drink order & get boxes to take out food home. Funny, she said the 2nd drink order was NEVER PLACED.  Then original waiter returned & left the check. I noticed they refunded the price of one meal they messed up, but nobody told us they were doing that.  No tip. And we'll never go back. They have a HUGE staff working, and they are completely disorganized & few of them care about service. Bummer."
Marissa D.,"Fairfield, CA",0,8,,4.0,1/13/2016,"I went to a late lunch at BJ'S today and had such a wonderful experience. 5 stars on the service. Our waiter was very attentive and friendly. ""CRAIG M"". He was such a joy to have as a waiter! 4 stars only because their deep dish pizzas lack the pizza sauce itself."
Kaye S.,"San Francisco, CA",33,50,26,4.0,10/11/2014,"Server was extremely busy since it's Saturday but managed to check in on us in a timely manner. She was fast with our refills and didn't interrupt my boyfriend and me when she saw that we were engaged in our conversation. We ordered the Scampi Pasta (which was slightly bland this time), the Buffalo Chicken pizza (mediocre), and the traditional wings (best out of the 3). Servers are a hit or miss here but ALISHA was a speedy server and had very good service (thank you!)."
Christina G.,"Walnut Creek, CA",134,447,2556,3.0,3/6/2013,"I came here with five of my coworkers for my birthday, and the food was just ok.  I've had the enlightened mahi mahi before and it was amazing, but this time, the fish was overcooked.  My coworker's teriyaki shrimp was drenched in sauce (and a considerably smaller portion than another coworker's salmon).  I guess the food can be hit or miss, because the wings I had at happy hour the week before were tender and crispy and cooked to perfection.  Their orange cream soda and pear cider have strange, astringent-like tastes to them.  The cream soda, however was delicious.  My pizookie was delicious though!  That never misses!!"
Nikki Z.,"El Sobrante, CA",4,55,,4.0,6/26/2014,This review is for the Pizookies.  Yummmmo! I haven't been here since November 2013 but recently I came and they have new flavors! Salted Caramel and Peanut Butter - Delicious!!! I will definitely be back for these.
Rizzy B.,"San Pablo, CA",0,44,1,4.0,4/8/2016,"Two words, well - four words, actually.  STUFFED MUSHROOMS - FRIED CALAMARI.  Both of these appetizers are always my faves and 100% winners.  They give great portions so it's definitely feasible to enjoy a meal of appetizers alone and still feel satisfied. I used to love, love, love, the seared Ahi Tuna Salad, but it seems as if they changed the recipe.  It used to come with full slices of Tuna, but lately, the tuna has been chopped in smaller portions.  The sauce used to also have more of a ""kick"" to it which went very well with the wasabi on the side.  With their new recipe, this salad went from ""WOW"" to just ""ok.""  You also can't go wrong with the Long Island Iced Tea (top shelf only please) and they fried, naked chicken wings with the buffalo sauce drizzled on the top.  The waiters are also extremely friendly as well as the hosts.  They can get pretty busy during weekends, but during the week, there is hardly ever a wait."
Sal M.,"Anaheim, CA",252,190,230,3.0,8/13/2014,"Well, at least they have a happy hour with $4 beers (Haywire Hefeweisen!) and discounted appetizers and mini pizzas, and their pastas with chicken or shrimp aren't bad either. But they need to wash the lettuce a bit more on the salads, and take out the wilted stuff.  Mine had dirt, was it just harvested yesterday?  Service is a mixed bag especially on the busy nights, which is why I mainly come at lunch or happy hour, to avoid the two-hour dining experience.  Most of the main menu, except for the light bites is $2-3 more than it should be. Although I lean toward Gordon Biersch or Pyramid for my chain restaurant beer, there are just enough reasons to come back here."
Jason D.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",0,6,1,1.0,2/11/2015,"I've been to this restaurant 4 times and have NEVER once had a good experience. I've been too several other locations such as Redmond WA. This place should be on undercover boss.... The manager is a jerk. He is rude to his staff, he does nothing to help and makes poor decisions when given opportunity to do the right thing. I went here Sunday night 2/8/15 with my friend. He ordered a small pizza and I ordered pulled pork sandwich and each of us had a beer. My food came out with an empty sauce cup and no fries. Waitress takes my food back for 15+ minutes, says the manager cussed her and the f-ing cook. By the time the food comes back out, my friend had already finished his meal. She said the manager was sorry about it.... but then they charged me 100% He should have walked out to deliver the food talked to me himself and either fix the bill or offer us a free beer or some other way. I really felt horrible for the poor waitress who was embarrassed Both myself and my buddy will NEVER go back"
Brian W.,"Benicia, CA",131,15,24,5.0,12/24/2014,Eric or server was amazing! Memorized our entire order and it was quick and accurate. Great food too! I called ahead and spoke with the manager for a last minute Christmas Eve birthday dinner reservation and he hooked us up.  We were welcomed and seated within 10 minutes. Drinks and appetizers served in 15 minutes. Good food and nice Gluten Free Options.
Rodrigo M.,"Richmond, CA",0,1,2,5.0,12/24/2015,"Went there for the first time with my girlfriend since I've gone to the mall. It had a nice environment and was not at all full which was great because our wait time to a table was about 6-7 min. We were greeted by our server Joseph D. He prepared me an awesome Bombay Saphire Straight with a lemon twist, although there wasn't a crystallization in the glass it was an amazing drink. We then ordered our BJ favorite appetizers. (Avocado rolls, and fried calamari). It took a while for us to decide our food since we were to busy enjoying our apps lol. But we ended up ordering an Asian chopped salad and their Grilled Barbacoa Chicken over brown Rice ,black beans, and feta cheese. The chicken was good but there red sauce was a little cold and the dish felt like it needed a crunch. Overall the entrees were Good. But then he offered to get us dessert (on him) which overall topped of the whole experience. Our server Joseph was very attentive and came to our table several times for feedback and short convo. Also refilled our drinks and was very polite. We want to say that It was an outstanding dinner and the service was great. ! Thanks Jo ! Thnx BJ's! Happy Holidays."
Jen O.,"Martinez, CA",63,23,15,1.0,9/24/2015,Worse service ever tonight never came to fill our drinks...Took an hour for my deep dish pizza to come out.When I took a bite it was undercooked very doughy.  The manager comped the pizza but since it was the special I eneded paying for the two salads and pizookie which ended up being $25 anyways! They should have not charged me for the 2 salads. I would have been happy paying $15. Ive been coming to Bjs and this has been the worse its ever been.
Tone S.,"Vallejo, CA",0,6,,1.0,12/23/2015,"Put it this way, if you want to have a good ol' stomach ache then this is the place to be ! To be fair the service isn't bad but the food isn't good . This is the second time me and my lady have came home with a bad stomach . Not to mention we ordered the pizza and it was still doughy. If Wendy's and round table fooked  you would get BJ's. Ol sucka butts."
Anan K.,"Portland, OR",9,50,11,3.0,10/13/2015,Came here to get some dinner and pizookies but my steak was a little disappointing. It was too cooked when I asked for medium rare. The Pizookies however is delicious. Recommend the triple chocolate.
C P.,"Pinole, CA",0,6,,5.0,11/8/2015,I love it here! I came here last night with my husband and we just wanted to order like appetizers or something but our sever helped us out and helped us decide. Cristian was a server and he did a great job. He was so friendly and very calm and quick. He brought us out samples of the handcrafted soda beverages that BJs makes cause my husband ordered one and was curious what the others taste like. Was great! Definitely coming back.
Eduardo D.,"Modesto, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/16/2015,Worst Thursday night ever. I ordered two shots of patron. The glasses were dirty as hell. Also instead of salt they give me sugar!  On top of that my server kayla gave me a terrible service . She never checked on me. I ordered pizza and they brought it out to me. Kayla forgot to give me goddamn cheese and pepper. What a terrible service. All i wanted was a good night but my server messed it all up. I pray for all out there. DO NOT GET KAYLA AS SERVER.
Cindy C.,"Suisun City, CA",0,17,24,2.0,11/5/2015,"Tonight was such a disaster. Food never consistent.  Sometimes food IS BOMB. but tonight, was just nono. Food was drenched in oil, seriously... it was gross . Heart attack. And my chili was not chili, it was basically nacho cheese ): the lady taking my togo, even spelled my name totally different ( I even told her how to spell it ) jeez, it's going to be a minute before I come here. So disappointed ."
Sandy L.,"Pittsburg, CA",196,33,58,2.0,8/11/2015,"I don't why I still go back to this place.. Maybe I try to trick my mind into liking their food. But I had a weird eating out day today. Randomly went into BJs because I was craving Pizookies. We ordered take out for the Pizookie Trips and let me tell you this- the Pizookies were soooo small and poor looking! They were half the size in comparison to the bowl they were put in. They had the sauces in different containers and ice cream scoops in another.  I'm sure it would've been better dining in, but please BJs work on your take out!  Also ordered the California Club flatbread appetizer. It was alright, some parts weren't even crispy and too skimpy on the avocado; that's the best part! My bill came out to be regular priced and I came around happy hour time, wondering why I didn't get the discount. I tried calling someone but no one would give me their attention.. -.-  Overall I forgot about it and still managed to give them a hefty tip (I'm too nice). looolzzz.  It's an alright place but I wouldn't bother coming here unless I'm coming for the Pizookie AND its dining in. Other than that, I'll pass."
Brian H.,"Benicia, CA",66,94,28,2.0,9/12/2014,"They have lost their luster .  It's rush rush rush .  Took a while to be seated yet there were 12 open tables in the restaurant.   Service : she was polite but in a rush then we didn't see her much after taking the order  Food: pizza was not completely cooked , sausage was squishy like it was defrosted and was wet .  The Parmesan cheese on her chicken wasn't cooked all the way and the green beans were like they just took them from the microwave .   Appetizer :  cold and crunchy .. I had the mushrooms .  Strange I know .  Drinks: she had the peach sangria which was very good .  My iced tea was 99% ice and 1% tea.  I asked for light ice .   So in a nut shell .  Lost its luster and we will be taking a break for a while .  Looking elsewhere I guess ."
