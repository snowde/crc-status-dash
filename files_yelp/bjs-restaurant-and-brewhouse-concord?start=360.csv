Michael J.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",29,15,3,5.0,9/9/2015,"This place is swell. Well staffed and well run. I came here tonight for a family members birthday. We brought a party of nine and came during dinner rush. They were able seat us immediately, we were quickly greeted by our waitress who was just a doll. She brought our drinks and wasn't the least bit bothered that the rest of our party hadn't shown up. When they arrived she quickly gathered their drink orders and bought them out as well. Our food orders were taken quickly and the food was brought out just as fast. She even brought a dish out twice because my aunt forgot to make her corrections when placing her order. Customer service like this is why I'll come back. Thanks for putting up with my family Christine(I hope that's her name), appreciate your patience and kindness."
Eric A.,"Concord, CA",0,7,1,3.0,5/1/2015,"I'm giving a decent rating because the food is consistently good. The bartender, Tyler, needs to relax. His ego, and the way he treats everyone he works with, makes the bar almost unbearable to sit at."
Lynne L.,"Hercules, CA",0,30,2,1.0,12/4/2014,"Every birthday or special occation, my kids want to eat at BJ's, unfortunately we will now find another establishment to visit. On November 25, we were at your Concord location celebrating my son's 16th birthday.  Unfortunately, my son left his birthday card with a sum of money on the table.  We contacted our waiter and he told us that he did see the card and had asked another coworker to bring the card to the front.  After several conversations with the manager, we still have not received the card, nor money back from the restaurant. Therefore, we will NO longer spend any more of our hard earned money at BJ's because we do NOT trust this establishment."
Chrissy O.,"Walnut Creek, CA",40,56,14,1.0,8/12/2015,"Went to bjs for a quick bite and a pitcher of beer. Sat in the bar area, got a seat right away. It was just me and my sister. We ordered a pitcher of beer and waters right off the bat. 15 minutes had gone by and we hadn't even seen our waiter. When we finally found him, he said the bartender had ""cut her hand or something"", and that's why it was taking so long. Another 10 minutes goes by. We finally get our pitcher after almost 30 min, ordered food, and waters (again).  Food came quick and was good. We asked for napkins and forks, twice. Which never came. Our waiter (Salvador) seemed to busy flirting with some waitress at the bar then tending to his tables. The one directly behind was also complaining about their service. We finally flagged down a different waiter to talk to the manager. Before the manager came out waiter finally came out from wherever he was hiding and we asked again for silver wear and waters. By now our food was getting cold (calamari and Brussel sprouts...two things not good when cold) so we used our fingers. Boy that was pretty gross as the food was super greasy. Beer had been gone for awhile. The manager came out and listened to what we had to say and said he would take some stuff off our bill, but NEVER even apologized. Our waiter was MIA for another 20 min, and when he returned he didn't even ask if we wanted refills. We AGAIN asked for water and napkins. Finally got napkins, NO WATER. The manager took half off our food. We had to of course find the waiter and ask for our check. Another 15 min go by, and we have to find the waiter to even take out payment. By the end he was so FN rude I didn't even tip him. Maybe that's harsh but all I wanted was a relaxing night with some good food and beer. Anything but. Horrible horrible service.  NEVER coming back."
Michelle M.,"Fairfield, CA",609,122,1244,3.0,8/17/2010,"I come here mainly for the deep dish pizzas, particularly the 'BJ's Bacon Cheeseburger' ( thank you sister ) along with a randomly chosen appetizer, be forewarned when saucing up the chicken lettuce wraps--that spicy mustard sauce was more consistent of a wasabi soaked dipping sauce!! My sinuses were cleared up instantly and my eyes were watering up along with a few coughing fits.  Other than that it wasn't that bad of an  appetizer. But my main purpose for visits to any BJ restaurant (brewhouse to be more precise) is for the beers. The usual selection of beers. My choice being the Jeremiah Red or for a sweet note ask for the 'Jerry Burst'. Friendly service with a surprisingly prompt response though at some point the wait was adding up as more people trickled in. Not too much to complain about this time around. I will be back. No doubt about that. :-)"
Toni W.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/25/2015,This was absolutely the worst service ever by Sal!!!! Do not go for their late night happy hour!!!!!!! The food came out cold and soaked in grease and the server could not articulate any part of our order. Got it wrong thrice and brought us the wrong check!
Ivy R.,"Martinez, CA",137,1779,4674,4.0,3/25/2010,"Its been a long time since my husband and I went out on a Sunday for our regular lunch dates. We were shopping for beds at Sears and I said what the hell.  Lets go try the cocktails over at BJ's. (We didn't drink last time) There are two mitigating factors to the one star bump.  Their amazing cocktail menu and they have the calories listed in the back for almost all of their menu items. Now to the drinks.  I started with a Pina Chococolada Martini.  Number one weirdest combination drink I have ever had and it is extremely good.   ""A decadent, creamy blend of Malibu coconut rum, Midori Melon Liqueur, Monin White Peach, pineapple juice and whipped cream, topped off with a chocolate swirl.""  Its Delicious. Second drink was the BJ's Irish Root Beer.  If you thought Root Beer couldn't get any better, well sister it just did.  ""Root Beer for grown-ups! Made with JAMESON Irish Whiskey, BAILEYS Irish Cream, BOLS Butterscotch Schnapps, and BJ's handcrafted root beer. You can't drink just one.""  I only drank one but I wanted other things on the menu. In between those two drinks we split a House Salad and a Grilled Chicken Pesto Pizza.  The salad was good.  Just a regular salad. The Pizza was very good.  Its actually the perfect size to split.  Each piece is 93 calories.  Between the two of us we had 3 1/2 slices.  It was a nice lunch and reasonably priced. For the last drink of the day I went with the Strawberry Confusion, Hpnotiq Liqueur, Stoli Razberi Vodka, pineapple juice and a splash of strawberry served chilled and straight up. It was very fresh like a thinner strawberry smoothie served in a Martini glass.  I really liked it.  Its a great summer cocktail. The service was great.  Kind of slow but it was really, really busy in there.  I'm just really appreciative of their outstanding cocktail menu.  I will be back more often now because of that."
Tyko N.,"Antioch, CA",24,32,2,1.0,9/15/2015,The new mahi mahi was nasty i was fooled by the picture. My friends soup was cold and the manager did not have any empathy towards us. Told us we were wrong. Never going back to a Bj's. McDonald's quality food at double the price.
Kent W.,"Fairfield, CA",90,27,5,3.0,2/6/2015,Half time at Warriors Hawks game tied.  Sitting at bar watching nice big screen and there are a few other vocal Warrior fans which helps vibe. Ordering Mac N Cheese.
Sean S.,"Pacheco, CA",0,4,,1.0,11/14/2015,Late a lot of open tables still Had to wait . Mac an cheese tastes like nachos cheese noodles over cooked. This place sucks !
Kevin K.,"Concord, CA",8,203,,4.0,11/26/2012,"I've been here several times and just never gotten around to writing a review - what's wrong with me?  Took the family for dinner the night before Thanksgiving and was surprised that 3 of the 4 of us ended up with a seafood dish. Two out of the three (sirloin/lobster tail combo, clam chowder) were decent or above average. The third was the Mahi Mahi and while I knew it was pan seared, it came out very dry. The manager did a great job handling a return and recommending a jalapeno burger so she gets props for her service. I was surprised that I didnt even get a ""sorry, we messed up, here's a free beer"" offer but I guess that's the way it is in today's economy. The beers were good as usual. The waiter was hilarious and helped make an enjoyable evening of it. Tried the Call Ahead Service to get our name on ""the list"". The person answering the phone said they were not busy and there would be no issue so we said, we'll be there in 40 minutes. We arrived 5 minutes ahead of schedule and waited 15 minutes for a table. While it was probably better than the 20 other people waiting, I'm not sure what the real bonus of ""call ahead"" is.  We'll be back as the overall experience was positive and the one bad dish out of about 7 or 8 times there doesnt ruin it for us. Everyone goofs up occassionally."

Liz P.,"Pinole, CA",18,69,1,2.0,5/29/2014,"I want to give this spot more stars... but I can't. Their food is pretty good, I've never had a bad meal at BJs. But the last time I was here the service was ridiculously slow, and they were not busy in the slightest, so no excuses people!  Co-workers and I came here for lunch at 11. There were only 2 tables that were occupado, so you would think that service would be snappy. That was a negative. Once our order was taken it took forever to get our food... were they hand making the pasta back there? De-feathering a chicken? I have no clue, but seriously people... step up your game PLEASE."
Mars D.,"Concord, CA",4,3,,4.0,9/30/2015,"My girlfriends & I went there last Sunday & had a good time~! Gaby was our server & was fantastic!! (Give that girl a raise, would ya!) All the other servers there were not on her level. Service-wise, Gaby was awesome! As for the food, it's simple, but it's tasty - good job! *Thumbs Up* :)"
Dar W.,"Concord, CA",0,4,,1.0,12/20/2014,"First of all, call ahead seating/reservations is a joke!  We still waited a long while.  Service was very poor and inefficient. My meal was wrong probably because the waiter did not write anything down. He never brought a few things after being asked twice. After the manger took off my meal and offered a dessert,  which I accepted a bowl of ice cream for my daughter, the waiter had the friggin' nerve to put that on the bill too.   On the up side everyone was polite and pleasant!"
Sziezel P.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",201,6,69,5.0,3/26/2014,"Got the usual desert (Cookie's & Creme Pizookie) It never let's me down!! They have a new flavor added to their wonderful, delicious pizookies, which is White Raspberry & Almond. My boyfriend decided that he wanted to try it, so we did. & it was just amazing! All of their pizookies are really worth trying!"
Amy R.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",0,25,1,2.0,12/16/2015,"Overpriced and Uninspired. 1 - The mac 'n cheese came from a box. I am not kidding: tiny noodles, neon orange. The meal cost pennies per serving, and it's a bad business decision for any self-respecting restaurant. I have no complaint with boxed mac 'n cheese when I'm lazy at home, but no one who cares about food serves boxed Macaroni and Cheese to paying customers. 2 - My hamburger cost $11.25, before tax. $11.25! It was meh: not bad, but definitely not good. For $11, I expect my bacon cheeseburger to be dripping in some crack-based delicious sauce, possibly BBQ, with thick applewood bacon slices, onions - grilled or rings, and sharp cheddar dripping over a half pound grass-fed Angus burger on a fancy bun. No!!! At BJ's an $11 burger is rather pathetic: a smallish patty on a plain bun - no sauce, paper thin bacon, a slice of raw red onion, and the cheese was placed as an afterthought in that weird not melted but lukewarm sweaty stage just sitting on the burger.  3 - Shoestring French fries were so unhealthy and fried so many times they would've been decadent if they had arrived hot or at least warm. 4 - The ""healthy"" grilled chicken was so salty my kid wouldn't eat it.  5 - For a ""brewery"" BJ's offers no local, unique, or interesting beers. 6 - Everything was soo expensive it made the mediocrity insulting. It would be one star except:  - The service was nice. Staff were inexperienced, but trying.  - The cookies and cream pookie! Still over-priced, but soo delicious. If I ever come back it will be only for that."
Gabriel D.,"Hercules, CA",173,133,741,2.0,4/1/2014,"It's not often that I give a place a bad review.  This was one of the worst dining experiences I've had in a long time. Time is valuable, and this establishment really wasted my sister's and my time. If the food wasn't good, I'd probably never go back.  Unfortunately the food here is good enough to come back for. Now for the story. It's Friday, March 28, 2014. I just got home from work and my parents went to Cache Creek for the night so I brought my sister to BJ's (we were contemplating on where to eat for over 30 minutes until finally she decided BJ's). Before arriving my sister called to reserve a table for 2. So once we got there we checked in and they said we were next on the list. We waited for 5 minutes or so and were finally seated. After looking at the menu, we decided to order from their new ""Enlighted Entrees"" section (well new since the last time I was there). So then at ~9:00pm we ordered: Drinks: root beer and water Appetizer: Calamari 2 dinner plates:  Mahi-Mahi Tacos (chargrilled mahi-mahi with chipotle mayonnaise and tossed in Santa Fe dressing, Napa cabbage, carrots, red onions and cilantro. With avocado cream sauce, fire-roasted tomato salsa and tortilla chips.) Lemon Thyme Chicken (Herb-roasted chicken breast served over brown rice, topped with sautéed red onions, tomatoes and roasted Brussels sprouts in lemon thyme sauce.) After 5 minutes the calamari comes out pretty fast, so we eat that while waiting for our main courses. And the waiting commences. My sister and I talk about college, since my sister's a junior in high school right now and I just recently graduated from college, we talked about SATs and grades and which colleges she should apply. We already finished the calamari, and the time is now 9:45pm. My sister and I are wondering what's taking our food so long. So when the waitress walks by, my sister asks, ""Do you think you can check on our food?"" in which she replies, ""Yeah..it shouldn't be taking this long, let me go check."" 9:51pm, our waitress does a squat so that we're all on eye level, and tells us, ""I'm really sorry about this, but they lost your ticket in the back. They don't know what's going on back there. I'm really sorry about this. I told them to cook them as fast as they can."" My sister and I are just like :| at this point. It's almost 10:00pm already, it's kind of late for dinner, and we're not as hungry anymore because we had calamari.. Then our waitress offers us free salad, in which my sister and I happily accept. So we received 2 'Fresh Mozzarella and tomato Salads"" that were pretty good. Then just 15 minutes later, both of our orders came in. My sister and I ate half of each, and they were both really good. Under 800 calories per plate, yet packed full of flavor. The food being good is why this experience doesn't get 1 star (as well as the 4 refills of root beer I had which made me pretty full). Our waitress apologized again as she gave us our bill, and my sister and I said np. We know it's not her fault for the mistake they made in the back. I just wish she could have been more attentive of it though instead of us having to ask her to check on our food. Probably coming back here again eventually...but I just hope that we have a better experience."
Alex N.,"Lafayette, CA",4,91,,2.0,8/20/2014,"Meh, I wasn't expecting much anyway, I was just killing time while my wife was at the mall. Tap beers were not as cold as I usually like. Bar apps took way too long especially given the fact that they weren't busy at all."
Michelle Z.,"San Francisco, CA",234,129,62,3.0,11/12/2012,"I like this location because it's right next to the mall. If the wait is long, you can shop for a little bit (although the buzzers don't work inside the mall). Try the call-ahead list though, so you can shorten the wait once you get there. Service is mediocre here, even when they're not busy, service can be a tad slow.  But the food is just like any BJs--big portions, and always tasty :)"
