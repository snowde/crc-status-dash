Timothy P.,"Martinez, CA",0,8,,5.0,12/4/2014,"My wife and I love this place! We go pretty much once a week. There's always great food, and the beer selection is inspiring. I'm something of a beer snob, and I give their Stout a big ""thumbs Up."" The Porter needs a little work, but seems to have improved in the past year. The red, Nutty Brewnette and Hefeweitzen are also good. So many beers, so little time......"
Amanda H.,"Concord, CA",195,81,13,5.0,9/6/2014,I absolutely love this restaurant !!! The avocado egg rolls are to die for! I would go there every single day for these if I could!!!! The customer service is usually on point and it's loud enough that I can bring my daughter and not feel like the loudest table at the restaurant. I definitely recommend this restaurant!
Chia V.,"Walnut Creek, CA",92,16,9,3.0,2/1/2014,"I come here a lot mostly for the happy hour deals. After tonight's visit I should stick to happy hour appetizers and pizza from now on. The jambalaya was extra salty and my bfs burger was tiny. For the cost of the burger, we could've gotten a much better bigger, juicier, and tastier one from red robin. I'll definitely only come back for pizza or the happy hour deals. I've had the Parmesan chicken, average. Tuscan chicken limone pasta, average. Blackened salmon, good. Fish tacos, ok. Stick to the pizza and appetizers. Get the wings. They're really good."
Lishyy L.,"Pittsburg, CA",163,14,8,2.0,7/11/2014,I normally go to the Brentwood location & now I know to stick to it. First off our waiter was the worst took forever with EVERYTHING! We didn't even order a drink refill because the only time he came back was when he brought our check. & I wanted to order desert but he totally ruined that as well.   The food was not tha bizzness. Lol ordered a shrimp ceasar salad & the shrimp tasted half cooked made my stomach hurt. My boyfriends steak was not well done really undercooked. The time we sat there was ridiculous we were seated waiting on or order to be taken for over an hour. Crazy right? But on top of that it wasn't even packed & ppl that we were there 20 minutes seated before had already been served with drinks & their meals came about 45 minutes before ours. Why we didn't leave? Because I decided I would be nice & give the guy a chance. Wrong choice! I will be sticking with Brentwood Bjs
Erica C.,"Antioch, CA",212,53,245,3.0,3/9/2014,"Came for lunch. I haven't been here in a lil while. Didn't have to wait for a table, which was nice. But our waiter was a bit off. He didn't get the order right & then gave us a wrong tab. (Which was less than what our actual bill was, but we were honest enough to let him know.) Food was ok but definitely need better waiters!!"
Tom M.,"El Cerrito, CA",52,34,84,3.0,6/28/2015,"If you're looking for the American chain restaurant experience, you come to the right place. Decent food,   decent service, and plenty of TV screens to watch your favorite sporting events - especially your Bay Area teams like Giants, the 49ers, and the Warriors. Come for their amazing assortment of home made beers on tap and stay for their Pazookie! (And deep dish cookie with ice cream on top!).  So good!"
Shelby S.,"Moraga, CA",0,6,2,1.0,8/17/2015,"The service was mediocre and so was the food. I have ordered the Santa Fe Salad before and it was awesome, but this time will be my last. There was barely any salad dressing and they forgot to add the cheese and avocado. Poorly done and disappointed."
Antonia M.,"Novato, CA",10,284,67,2.0,4/7/2012,"When I go into a restaurant, I expect good service whether or not it is a chain.  The service here was just mediocre; we had to ask for drink refills and also for water refills.  When the waitress brought our bill, I was shocked since the bill was over $90 and there were only 2 of us for lunch.  She gave us someone else's bill; luckily we checked.  That kind of mistake is just careless.   Would I come back a second time? Eh, probably not."
Thaddius D.,"Seattle, WA",128,11,,5.0,2/13/2014,"B.J.'s. That must stand for BEST JOB by their employees. I have gone here several times and I am always happy with the service. I have come back several times because of how a couple of the employees have treated me. J.T. has always given me the utmost best experience every time that I go in. He knows the drink that I like and almost has it prepared the moment that I sit down which I think is absolutely amazing. I consider that top class service. I get a lot of great service from all of the employees that work here. It almost seems like a small family when I come in and the way that I am treated. There is great employees at this establishment. Eric has always been nice to me and the same goes for Andre. Andrew always greets me with a smile. Every time that I come here, I feel like I am coming to a family restaurant. It is always a pleasant experience. I like all of their home made brews and when I like to try new things, I try and mix my beers to see what they taste like. The bartenders here do an amazing job of helping the customer satisfy their pallet. I will take my wife and family here any time."
Cynthia P.,"Clarksburg, CA",0,12,,1.0,6/24/2016,This is one of the worst BJ's branches around. The service is extremely slow and sloppy. Beer was kind of stale. The food was blah-blah. Altogether a thoroughly unpleasant experience....
Tracy N.,"North Side, Pittsburgh, PA",8,13,1,4.0,7/10/2015,"Absolutely amazing service from Kayla! I am very happy she was our server tonight. I order food without onions-I have an allergy- and when we said that there were onions on my salad she informed the manager of this and they both made sure I got a salad without any onions. Honestly, having a server who cares about her customers is an awesome feeling and a manager who comes out and knows about his customers is great! I would give this 5 stars if there wasn't the cross contamination."
Russ A.,"Danville, CA",57,27,31,2.0,5/14/2015,Food kind of sucks and is overpriced. Poor waitress was slammed but a great server. I don't think I need to go back.
Chris B.,"Antioch, CA",0,34,,4.0,9/14/2014,"It was a Friday night.  We went there with a party of 4.  We called in 30 minutes before to get our name in.  When we got there, we had to wait an additional 5 minutes, but then we were seated.  Waiter had us sit at a table as he told us there were no more booths available.  No big deal.  We ordered our drinks, and then a short while later ordered our food.  It did take them a while to bring everything out but it wasn't too bad.  I ordered a Bacon Cheeseburger, well-done, along with the crispy fries.  I have to say, this burger was one of the best burgers I've ever had in my whole life.  I ordered it well-done, and if you like well-done burgers, then you know that it has a special flavor to it when it's cooked correctly.  Well they absolutely nailed it.  The bacon was top-notch and the bun complimented the burger very well.  I've had burgers from places like paddock café where I also felt they were VERY good, but this was truly a gourmet burger, on another level both in terms of quality, as well as price ;)  The crispy fries were also extremely good, making it pretty much a prefect dinner.  They have a great selection of beer to choose from also, and I enjoyed being able to try a new beer. Only real downer is that the waiter was not very attentive to us.  It seemed like the only time we could get his attention was by basically flagging him down.  Everyone felt pressured to order a new drink during the few rare times the waiter came by, whether they were finished with their current drink or not, simply because you couldn't count on the waiter actually coming around to give you another chance anytime soon.  The table we were sitting in was sort of in the middle of everything, which is the only reason we were able to flag down the waiter on occasion.  If we had been on the edge or something, we would have been screwed, maybe seeing the waiter once every half hour or less.  Even though this place is not particularly cheap, their service certainly is!  For me though, the food is the most important aspect, and I really enjoyed my meal this time."
Stephanie V.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,11,,2.0,10/28/2015,"Normally I love Bj's and I love their food, but not this time or location. The service was sub par to say the least. We were never actually greeted by our server, all of our appetizer dirty dishes were left on the table, the mustard and ketchup for my boyfriends burger never came, and we were never checked on, and the server rushed us out trying to get the bill from us asap so he could leave. Not cool dude. If you don't want to stay, give the table to someone else so I can give a tip to someone who deserves it."
Evelyn Q.,"Pacheco, CA",148,146,6,5.0,9/8/2015,We came here on Labor Day. It was a Monday. Happy Hour was still in play even though it was a holiday! The margaritas were refreshing seeing as it was really hot in Concord. Did not try the food but definitely will come back for the drinks!
Emmette H.,"Concord, CA",1,1,,1.0,10/24/2014,Service was terrible tonight we were promised a 25 minute wait And have now waited for 50 minutes they really don't know how to handle a crowd here at all. Don't eat here
Timothy T.,"Fremont, CA",132,109,67,1.0,1/24/2014,"I come here often. But this time we got seated and we had to wait 45mins to get the news that ""there was a mix up and your food is getting maid right now"" thats bull crap. The people around us that got seated after got served first; one table came in 25mins after and still got serves first! ARE YOU KIDDING? The service should have had the common sense to double check.   I should have mad a big scene to get some crap out of this joke"
teri g.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",0,10,,1.0,10/21/2014,"Used to be a faithful patron, hadn't been there a while - took out of state friends celebrating a birthday....what a joke!!!  I agree, it's nothing but a RUSH game - ordered several appetizers, four entrees with one added salad.  Ok, salad arrives first, then after a long wait the appetizers then five minutes later the entrées.....say what????  The waiter was never attentive and then when he approached the table and I explained what happened - there was NEVER ""I'm sorry"" or try to rectify the problem - it was ""I'll have to talk to the kitchen"" - then another employee  maybe some manager type) walked by, explained same to her but again blaming the kitchen.  REALLY??? never again - what a huge disappointment!  get your act together folks, another trashy restaurant in the county!"
Alix F.,"Walnut Creek, CA",1,37,8,1.0,7/27/2014,We waited 20 minutes for our waiter to notice our drinks were empty. He asked how our food was and left. So we asked for our check and we are now headed elsewhere for drinks. The santa fe egg rolls tasted like microwave taquitos.  The fried calamari came with marinara sauce instead of cocktail. All around dissatisfied.
Kris S.,"Walnut Creek, CA",5,31,15,1.0,12/10/2013,"I've been here several times before, but never really cared for the place, other than the fact that they have decent beer on tap. So my bf and I went in for lunch/happy hour on Sunday, and I ordered the mini pizza, and the spin dip. My bf ordered chicken wings, fries, and the chicken lettuce wraps. Everything seemed fine, the service was surprisingly pretty good, the food came out fast, we weren't too pleased with the lettuce wraps (the sauce was really sweet), but we ate and left. Well a couple hours later I started to feel a bit groggy and my stomach was feeling a little uneasy. I figured it could have been from the beer, or maybe I just overate, so I ignored it. A few hours later I felt a sudden sharp pain in my lower abdomen, and began cramping severely, after which I experience acute, bloody, diarrhea. I ended up spending the rest of my night/morning vomiting, cramping, and craping blood. Needless to say, it was food poisoning, most likely from the chicken on my pizza not being cook throughly. I was sick, and in bed the following day, and am still cramping.  My bf was telling his coworkers about the incident and ironically 2 out of the 8 present said they had experienced the same thing after eating at this Bj's. That's a high number for a such a small circle. I wonder how many other people have had food poisoning from this Bj's as well..."
