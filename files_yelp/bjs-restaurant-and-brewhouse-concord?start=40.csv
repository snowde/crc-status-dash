JT H.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,26,5,4.0,9/9/2017,"Nice atmosphere. Not a long wait on a saturday night. Only 25 minutes. Food was good. Wife had a pizza and i had mahi tacos. Mahi tacos were very good and very well priced. Pizza was pretty good as well. A little over priced for the pizza. Had a flight of their beer (7.95), decent beer.  Pizakookie is amazing. Definitely get dessert here"
Emäÿ B.,"San Jose, CA",99,24,20,1.0,12/27/2017,"waited for over 10 minutes to place a takeout order, 5 different people came by the takeout counter, none provided any assistance, including their manager! finally the 6th person came, took and screwed up my order. now mr. bossman came and wanted to help. well, thanks but no thanks, that's a little too late to be the hero."
Anabelle P.,"Fairfield, CA",98,12,1,5.0,9/18/2017,"Okay, So let me preface this with: The food is good. About what you would expect at a brewhouse/pizza place. Similar atmosphere to the Cheesecake Factory with way better service. What sells me on this is the service though. We were a party of 6, and we got sat next to an older gentleman that elbowed my friend's son in the back of the head a few times. After asking him to stop, the guy gave us trouble. Management swoops in to the rescue and got us moved. He checked in on my friend and his son to make sure everything was okay. Overall- They saved what could have been a really bad night for my friend's son (12 years old and not really able to handle this 40-50 year old macho guy whacking him in the back of the head because he wanted to put his arm around someone..) 10/10 would be back. Kids LOVED the appetizer mixed plate, portions were generous for everything, and the GM on that night was a total life saver :)"
Michelle Y.,"Brentwood, CA",1,55,588,3.0,3/7/2017,"Today,  went for a late lunch early dinner.  My son was very tired and fussy.  Actually tried something different, today, I got the lettuce wraps and the chicken pot stickers. They were both good! Got the Chicken Wings for my lunch tomorrow.  My hubby got the Ribeye and mashed potatoes, and vegetables for his meal. My son got the corn dogs and French fries, but, was very tired & sleepy.  So, after he ate his meal, he fell asleep on me,  and that's why he didn't want to sit in the high chair,  he already had his own agenda,  he wanted to sleep on me, while we ate. The service was good,  our Waitress, kept coming back to check on us, to see if we needed anything, and check with us, on our meals and drinks.  We were full,  but, got the pizookies for dessert - ""To go"". You can't come here without having the dessert. I got the Chocolate Chip with the French Vanilla Ice Cream and my hubby got the Triple Chocolate Chip and the Ghirardelli Chocolate Ice Cream. The waitress even added some ""Chocolate Chips"" to go with our pizookies! Too bad, they ran out of Peach Tea, maybe next time I will try it. Wanted to try the Fish and Chips. But . .  . , DID NOT, want to be disappointed,  just like yesterday, BUT, at a Total different restaurant."
Brian B.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,2,,5.0,12/28/2017,Good food nice cold beer we were greeted by Douglas he was very professional thank u we will back again
Gus D.,"Fairfield, CA",57,8,,5.0,11/17/2017,Let start by saying it was a real treat to have  been treated like we VIP at BJS our waitress Taylor was so helpful.Manager on Duty was always near also came over to make sure that our needs were being taking care of making us feel special. Thank you everyone.
Stefarn C.,"San Jose, CA",172,23,9,1.0,8/4/2017,"On a time crunch and decided to come here real quick just to grab a sandwich or something. We were told our food shouldn't take more than 10-15 minutes so we ordered. We literally waited an hour just for them to tell me, the pork isn't ready but you can wait more if you want......... why did I have to ask 3 times and wait an hour just to hear that.. Aside from that, I tried to be understanding because I saw people coming in and out so I figured okay it's busy let it slide..but the more I observe and look around, the more it pisses me off. If food isn't ready, customers should be told and given a heads up. There are so many people working here like I swear I saw at least 7 servers just standing around talking walking back and forth..one of them was even playing around with the manager in the front.  I work in a kitchen also so I understand timing. But when something isn't ready or we mess up an order or over cook our steaks, we tell the customers asap.  Just bad impression of this particular spot..i was super hungry and rushing to get back to SJ for business matters and because of their unprofessionalism, we are late"
Curt L.,"Martinez, CA",0,57,1,2.0,11/16/2017,"The food is good here but the service is poor. They are slow and not attentive. I have come here 2 separate times with 3 kids, and it just really bothers me when we finish our food and the waitress/waiter just disappear. When I finally get the check they sneak off and I can't find them to pay. Don't bother going to the front and asking for help, they'll tell you that you have to pay through your server, all the while my kids are getting restless and the server is still MIA. I almost walked out the second time...."
Mae M.,"Richmond, CA",0,2,2,5.0,11/1/2017,"Went to dinner with a friend, We were concerned about something when our order came up, and Douglas came to save the day. He made us leave satisfied and happy. We are definitely coming here on a regular"
Rebecca J.,"Concord, CA",15,4,,5.0,11/13/2017,"Service takes a long time, especially for delivery. But the food is good quality and well cooked."
Sabrina K.,"Concord, CA",74,2,1,5.0,11/12/2017,"Five Stars for the manager Pat. Our waiter was horrible. I asked for a manager and Pat apologized, came back multiple times to see if everything was going good and lowered our check. Too bad more of his staff can't follow in his footsteps. Our waiter never even apologized. Pat needs a raise and an award! -Sabrina & Randy"
Danika H.,"San Francisco, CA",292,69,42,1.0,5/14/2017,"BJ's isn't a fine dining destination. I get it. At the very least, I expect average food, average service, and a Pizookie. I've never really had a bad experience at a BJ's, nor do I ever mind minimal service at fast casual spots. Today's dinner was a downer though. Got there around 7:30pm... our party had been seated already and already had appetizers. Everything was fine at that point. Our server took our orders right away and everything was noted around 7:45pm or so. Our server went on break and then Mother's Day went from pretty good (The Warriors won!) to something that free Pizzokies all around couldn't even fix. An hour later, around 9:00pm, our food started coming in 15 minute intervals. Awkward when you're waiting for everyone's food to get on the table. But wait, here's the kicker... my mom (whose ""Day"" it happens to be) got her food last. Yikes! Food was cold, food was messy. People who were seated after and around us were already done with their meals and paying their bills. To be honest, if they had at least explained that the kitchen was busy or if there was a miscommunication between our servers, we would've been fine. 1 Star for a disappointing Mother's Day."
Tony A.,"Concord, CA",42,11,14,4.0,8/17/2017,"Again I don't know why this place is insisting to make people stop going there this is my 4th incident in same location today I go there with one of my friends and after waiting for 45 minutes till we called in they put us in the table and keep waiting for 28 minutes with no one come over to my table asking to take my order, even when I did ask for the manager it took 10 minutes from him to come over this is not the kind of service that we should receive in such restaurant don't know what's going on there and they need some attention from the corporate office  P.S the manger said oh I'm sorry lol  This is an update review 08/16/2017 Again last night ordered 3 soups came 2 only and ordered 2 salad with shrimp it canes with chicken  Ordered 2 ordered of fried calamari it canes test burned and so dry  This is an update review 08/18/2017 I got a courtesy call from Mr. Pat to solve the issue he is a really nice guy he is the General manager there and he is so nice and he did promise to fix this issues on the future thank you Mr. Pat for taking care of your customers"
Misty B.,"Martinez, CA",20,47,33,3.0,8/26/2017,"I received a gift card card for this place My friend Raquel , my granddaughter and myself went for lunch.  First we had to wait about 10 minutes which was odd since there was a ton of open tables. Second, we ordered an appetizer..which they served with our meal...not before  Third..i ordered soup and salad...the soup tasted burnt and the salad was wilted Last. It took almost 20 minutes to get.our waitstaffs attention tonget our bill Would not go.back for the food"
Jennifer H.,"Berkeley, CA",258,3,7,1.0,9/24/2017,Waited 20 minutes to get served water. Waiter who finally came wasn't even aware they were suppose to serve our table.
Sira V.,"Conroe, TX",13,88,338,3.0,5/6/2016,"The good: they have awesome drinks The bad: the food is only okay The ugly: is another sports bar/restaurant,  so it's always noisy. Their BJ's Irish Root Beer is the best! Many of their drinks are very good. The bartenders know their craft very well.  The food is okay... mostly.   Tonight I had their new Ham & Swiss melt. I figured they should have an easy time with that.  Well, it was obviously difficult. The sandwich was really greasy and not very flavorful.  If it weren't for the drinks this place would get only one star."
Ashley C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,4,,3.0,12/20/2017,"Overall 3 star. Service was okay, food wasn't the best. Could have just been an off night, might give it another try."
Alycia S.,"Martinez, CA",56,19,,2.0,10/22/2017,I wish our BJ's was good. Bc I do like the menu but service here is always slow and crappy hahaha so don't come hungry. It's so slow I think they forgot I ordered or I would almost want my money back. Yes that bad. So bad that I may never return to this BJ's again when there is a lazy dog close by or lucille's next door. Food is good and drinks are good but service and them coming to refill a water or anything is horrible. So I'm taking my money elsewhere which I wish I didn't have to do. Bc dang it I do like it and I'll miss the monkey bread pazzoki.
Alan P.,"Lafayette, CA",0,135,,4.0,10/21/2017,"There seared ahi tuna salad is heavenly. Try it.  The waiter is a little green and rushed us to order. Other than that, a very pleasant experience."
Suzette V.,"Vallejo, CA",14,10,1,3.0,6/11/2017,"Been here plenty of times, definitely good for groups except the wait time can be very long! Came here with a group of 12 on a Saturday night around 9pm, was seated within 30minutes (not bad!) Selection of food is predictable, I always get the Parmesan crusted chicken, which this time around you could tell it was just sitting there for a bit cuz the broccoli was over cooked and dried out.  Service at the front was nice, but our waitress could definitely have a better attitude. Checked up on us a handful of times and we needed refills on drinks... Nonetheless would come back again."
