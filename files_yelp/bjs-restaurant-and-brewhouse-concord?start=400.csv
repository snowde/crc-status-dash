Gaby R.,"Vallejo, CA",2,21,3,2.0,6/1/2015,Came here tonight for the happy hour. Waited 20 min for a menu and another 20 to order. Started out with drinks. My beer was fine but my boyfriend had to send back the Hef because it tasted like it was half water. He traded for the pale ale and was much happier. Unfortunately when our food came...much later..our experience took another nosedive. His sliders were tiny and dry. My carnitas fries were almost inedible. The carnitas meat was fried and then must have been baked to the point where the meat was just a rock on top of the fries. We were going to order wings but then thought better of it & went with the pizookie instead thinking this would be the one thing they couldn't mess up. Hence the two stars. We will not be returning to BJ's.
Jabez J.,"Oakland, CA",21,115,48,3.0,1/22/2015,"I had the artichoke and spinach dip which was subpar but what made the experienced great was the waiter,  Edgar he's personable and accommodating; he multi-tasked very well especially with a table full of young ladies and a guy just coming from playing a game of soccer.  If you ever stop by BJs ask for Edgar and sit in his area you will be pleased you did."
Shirley J.,"San Pablo, CA",53,47,2,3.0,2/2/2015,"Sadly I like the berry beer and Mediterranean pizza, however my last two visits have been pretty disappointing. Both times my waiters have been extremely inattentive. The potatoes skins were so greasy when you cut them grease oozed out. Anywho we were seated received out appetizers and did not see our waiter for another 10 minutes we were waiting for napkins, utensils and small saucers, truly by the time we received these our appetizers were cold?! I order the kids cheese pizza and it came out with a large scoop or diced tomatoes on top, I'm not sure what little kid finds that appetizing but maybe you should try something else...my 4 year old almost had a stroke when he saw those tomatoes on his pizza. Anyway hit or miss food to sum it up and the waiting staff may need some training."
Sammy E.,"Pittsburg, CA",111,44,26,5.0,1/2/2013,"I've been to this restaurant many times now, i'm a big fan because the food is very tasty no matter what you order! i tried the Build Your Own Pizza on a whole wheat and it was awesome!! i will order it for sure next time! i also get the spicy chicken pasta, its flavored and light. i'm not a big fan of desserts but their bazuka was yummy for sure! sometimes the waiter may take a bit too long or forgets to get the necessary things to the table (napkins and sugar/ketchup..) but that really depends on how crazy it goes at their place! its always my fave place to eat wither its on a date or with a group of family and friends!"
Robin W.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",62,3,,5.0,10/29/2015,"This is a great place to go for late night. I go here a couple times a week in the evening after class and zit at the bar. They have a pretty big selection of food and drinks for happy hour. The service is always great, friendly and attentive. Looking forward to going back ! All the food is incredible it's hard to chose ."
Eddie C.,"Sacramento, CA",1,8,,4.0,2/16/2015,"So my gf and I dined here on Valentine's day and we thoroughly enjoyed it. Everything from the food to the ambience, everything was great. Knowing it was a special day, we were expecting a long wait. Wrong! We got a table within a few minutes and the server was very accommodating. Our food and drinks came out quick and delicious. I had the ribeye ( medium rare) which was juicy, packed with that beefy, rich flavor you can expect from this cut of meat. You know its good when you don't need A1! My gf and I also tried the Irish root-beer which was sweet with a nice, mellow kick. Overall, we would definitely come to this BJs again. The only downer was that there were a few noisy kids who apparently were never taught how to use their indoor voice. Aside from that, it was a great dining experience."
Neil M.,"Pittsburg, CA",5,2,,1.0,7/2/2015,The only reason I'm giving one star is because the service was good but the food is very very bad. The food totally sucks. I ordered the spicy meatball pizza and got sausage pizza with any spice. Friend ordered the salmon rice carp and all you can taste was salt on the salmon.
Adri A.,"Hercules, CA",358,53,88,1.0,8/14/2013,"NOPE. I used to think that this place was all right. Y'know, your typical 'eh, I'm not expecting much' chain restaurant. Now it's like 'oh man what is this?' My boyfriend and I haven't been here for about a year, so we figured we were due for a cheeseburger deep dish pizza (our fave) and a pitcher of beer. It seemed like a good idea while watching a game of baseball, but... The cheeseburger deep dish pizza we loved... what happened to you? It's no longer served in the buttered deep dish we knew to recognize; it now just arrives on an extremely hot plate. The dough isn't buttery at all like before and the toppings were very skimpy. It seemed more like a regular pizza but with bloated dough--a more half-assed version of its former self. The kicker is that it isn't the worst part about the pizza. The worst part was my boyfriend biting into a small piece of plate in his slice. Yep. Apparently a piece of broken plate had gotten into the pizza somehow. It was small--about the size of a dime, but still very alarming. He could have damaged a tooth! I regret not taking a picture of it before letting the waitress take it to show the manager. Apparently it was hidden under the cheese and other ingredients which is why my bf didn't notice it before it was too late. We pretty much lost our appetite after our unfortunate discovery... The staff, at least, was very understanding toward the situation. The waitress apologized, took our pizza away and set up a replacement (which we didn't even ask for, but oh well). The manager was apologetic and told us that she ordered the kitchen staff to do a clean sweep of the kitchen, which was assuring. My boyfriend received a form to fill out about what happened and her business card in case he needed to contact her.  In the end, we weren't charged for the pizza and its replacement (we ended up taking it to-go and carefully eating it at home). I thought the staff did a good job of taking care of the matter, but honestly we will not be coming back because our impression of this place is pretty much ruined. At least the beer was tasty."
Jen C.,"Lafayette, CA",1,45,7,2.0,4/16/2014,"Ordered dinner Friday night through Grub Hub. Food took about an hour and a half to arrive, which is understandable for a weekend evening. Delivery driver was really sweet, but that's where any positive feedback ENDS!  We ordered southwest eggrolls, a santa fe chicken salad and a pizza. The eggrolls were edible but both the salad and pizza were absolutely not. They were the SALTIEST food items I have ever attempted to eat. The chicken in the salad (a seemingly somewhat healthy option) tasted like it had been soaking in ocean water then cooked in a salt bath and then dredged in salt. It was absolutely terrible. The pizza, aside from being horribly salty, was also undercooked and just gross. All this, horrible food, set us back $53 including a $7 delivery charge.  After eating a few bites of this disaster of a delivery dinner, I reached out to Grub Hub for help (their online chat tool is really handy, fyi) -- They submitted the complaint with the intermediary between Grub Hub and BJs, and on Monday my request for a refund was denied. Update: A couple of people from BJs coprorate have reached out to me to try to resolve this issue and I appreciate their follow up. 4 stars for corporate customer service...food was still awful though, but I do appreciate the effort!"
Margo L.,"Concord, CA",0,4,,1.0,4/22/2016,"We are regular customers of BJ's, we've been coming here for years. We visit at least 1 time a week. Recently they decided to down size a lot of the menu items but have not adjusted the pricing at all.  We ordered calamari and received 1/3 the portion we received in the past and the price was unchanged.  I ordered the Ahi Tuna Salad the portion was 1/2 the size but the same price.  I am all for downsizing, their portions were on the large size however I don't think I should have to pay the same price.  Have to say I'm disappointed and most likely will find a new spot to go to each week."
Jenelle B.,"Northwest, Portland, OR",167,92,178,3.0,12/26/2013,"I go here often and the service here is a hit or miss.  Their menu is great and they have a great selection to choose from. They offer lunch specials that run from 3-5 or 2-5, I forgot. BJs also has a happy hour during the day and also late at night where a few dishes would only cost $4 $5 & $6.  They offer call-ahead seating for your convenience.  My favorites: Clam Chowder w bread bowl  Lunch Special: unlimited soup & salad Had to add that their drinks are also a hit or miss depending on the bartender.  I had to send my drinks back multiple times because it didn't taste ""right"""
Cali G.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,63,1,2.0,6/14/2015,"4 stars for the food, but only 1 star for the customer service.  I absolutely hate coming here because of the customer service. It's horrible every single time. I've overheard employees cuss/curse/whatever numerous times in response to a wrong order (that was the servers fault). Service is slow and not friendly.  Perhaps they are over worked and treated poorly by the company? Who knows. I be come numerous times and experienced the same problems. I won't be returning."
Kayla V.,"Sacramento, CA",2,3,,1.0,10/27/2013,"Typically I love Bj's food, however this experience was just awful.  You sit down and expect that the host/hostesses/servers don't stare you down but I guess that's something normal for this Bj's. I didn't realize how juvenile people are, until I was sitting in my chair and kept feeling people stare at me- only to look up and see a couple hostesses/hosts trying to block a server that is staring right at me and acting like a teenager in high school. I mean granted if you know me- say hi and if you think you might know me.. ASK. But if you know me and just don't like me- (which was the case in this scenario) don't just stare.  Not only is this unprofessional but if it were anyone else, they may have embarrassed the crap out of you. Bj's should really reconsider what kind of people they hire, cause it's just a bad look.  Just so everyone knows- the one star is for the food... And even then- what I ordered was dry...."
Livia G.,"Berkeley, CA",184,43,19,5.0,5/8/2015,"I occasionally enjoy some food from Bj's but my last time here was all about my server Craig! He was amazing, knowledge about the menu, very sweet and professional! He came by quite often to take on my friend and I. He really did take care of us and midway in our dinner he surprised my friend with a puzookie for her birthday! Without either of us saying anything. I was surprised to learn no one else has ever made a yelp review based on his wonderful personality!"
Kaitie R.,"Chandler, AZ",14,6,1,5.0,5/6/2015,"BJ's has always been one of my favorite restaurants, but our visit today was super exceptional! Our waiter was Craig and he was so sweet! Honestly one of the best servers I've ever had anywhere I've went! He's very knowledgable about the menu and gave awesome recommendations. I ordered a Nutty Brewnette beer that he brought with my burger and it paired perfectly! He even brought me a birthday pizookie (my birthday was the day before we went, he obviously saw when he checked my ID for the beer). I wish I could give him more than 5 stars, I should call ahead next time I go because I don't think I would want anyone else serving me! He has the perfect balance of professionalism and personal friendly conversation. I would definitely have him serve me again as well as recommend all of my friends to him! I wish I could give him 10 stars!"
Jen P.,"San Francisco, CA",13,97,8,5.0,10/27/2013,"Delicious, delicious pizza! And make sure you get a pizooki - their warm cookie served with ice cream... so bomb! PS they also have great lunch specials!"
Grace C.,"Houston, TX",41,928,178,3.0,2/16/2014,"Plenty of TVs to watch, but service was very slow on a Saturday night.  I guess that's to be expected.  We got an Oreo flavored mini-pizookie (free for your birthday if you sign up for their eClub online in advance of your birthday) and the stuffed mushrooms - both delicious!  The prices are OK, a little high but not shockingly so."
Jennie C.,"Hercules, CA",16,155,162,2.0,8/6/2013,"I arrived at BJ's a little before 5 pm expecting the place to have plenty of seating and attentive service. Instead my party was met with a fairly busy restaurant (so much for an early and quick dinner) and really inattentive service. It took quite a long time for our order to be taken and then half way through our meal the server went home for the night. The server that took her place seemed overwhelmed by the amount of tables she had to attend to.  We ordered salads and entrees and asked if we should order our pizookies for dessert when we placed our order. The initial waitress said we didn't need to order a dessert ahead of time, so we didn't feel too worried. I ordered a wedge salad and a gluten free pizza.  Our server didn't bring our salads. The person who brought our salads placed each salad in front of the wrong person.  The lettuce was crisp, but the tomatoes weren't ripe. The entrees took a long time to arrive and when they did, the same thing happened with the salad...all placed in front of the wrong person...and to top it off they didn't bother to take away our dirty salad plates.  We sat there for some time before we finally tracked down our server to place our dessert order (after considering going somewhere else for dessert because of the slow service). I ordered a gluten free pizookie. The dirty salad dishes finally disappeared but our dirty entree dishes remained (why?!?).  The pizookies arrived and my table mates was so undercooked the manager removed it from the bill (thank you).  With that said, we were there for TWO hours. Two hours?!? Why?!? service was sooooo slow. We should have just ordered our pizookies at the beginning - not sure that would have helped, however.  I should also mention that we came in for a girls night out to celebrate three birthday's. I told the original server when we placed our order and even told the second/replacement server when she took our pizookie order. None of us received a candle or a howdy'do.  I mainly chose this restaurant because of the gluten free pizza and gluten free pizookie. I'd been to the Reno and Roseville locations and had a great experience at both. I even did curb side service at the Vacaville location and everything was perfect. Flawless service and great food was found at three other locations...why not this one?? I'm disappointed in the service we received at this location. Based on this, I am not sure if I would return. So disappointing. Two stars for the gluten free menu. 0 stars for service."
Auriyon J.,"Richmond, CA",113,150,40,2.0,11/16/2014,"This place could be so much better. They're unorganized. My date and I came in and they seated us immediately but at the wrong table. They seated us at a reserved party table so we had to move all our things. Then it was way to dark. I could barely see my menu. Even inside the bathroom was really dark! The waiter brought my date the wrong food. And they brought us our drinks with no ice. Who wants warm drinks?! The food proportions were bad. I ordered parmesan crusted chicken with mashed potatoes and broccoli.  I got three very small broccoli,  and a very small scoop of potatoes.  The food was very good! But way to expensive for the size! The dessert was awsome though. Beignet with strawberries and vanilla bean icecream, perfect!"
Alexys E.,"Antioch, CA",80,334,325,4.0,3/10/2012,"BJ's is not just a one trick pony! Besides their pizza, their other main dishes are fabulous as well. 1. The first time I went, I went with family. We had pizza, and must I say it was GREAT tasting pizza.  2. The second time I went I had their porkchops. I was expecting a double cut...it was close to lollipop pork chops but they were delicious and the potatoes that came with it were to die for. It came with sweet apples and mustard...it all tasted wonderful together. A great dish. 3. Third time I went I had Parmesan crusted chicken breast with again their fab mashers...the broccoli was cooked to death though. The chicken came with this lemon and sun dried tomato butter.. It was so rich that I could barely finish it...but rich is a good thing. 4. By the way, their raspberry lemonade is amazing. And if you're going to BJ's, you MUST have a pizzookie for desert.  The place is pretty much always packed. The service is decent the food is above average. Loved it and will go back as soon as possible."
