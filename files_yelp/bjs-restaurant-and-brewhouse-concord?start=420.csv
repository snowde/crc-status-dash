John M.,"El Sobrante, CA",16,47,1,3.0,10/9/2013,"We go here maybe twice a year. The menu is overwhelming, it's the size of a small novel. BJ's isn't bad and it isn't really great, it's just okay. If you have a family that can't agree on what type of food to eat then this is your place, the menu variety is what makes us choose this restaurant over others when we're in the area."
S. D.,"Columbus, OH",28,42,,1.0,11/13/2013,"This place managed to ruin my simple birthday dinner. Our sever was great and compassionate, the manager on the other hand was a bit inexperienced and uncaring.  Our appetizers were okay, nothing to write home about, but okay. Our wine was excellent.  Our steaks where bland and unseasoned, one arrived well done instead of medium and one arrived cooked okay. Now I remember about 6 months ago the steaks being delicious and tender with a garlic butter sauce, which apparently is what made it tasty and tender. Have you ever have a tough steak that was cooked medium, I didn't either until tonight.  Our baked potatoes where not baked, they might have been at one point but they where nuked warm after being chilled, because nuking a baked potato the sits in the fridge makes it that solid non-fluffy consistently that I received tonight. Even boiled potatoes are fluffier than what they tried to serve me. So we complained to the manager, one meal was deducted, granted I ate more of mine but a 10% discount or having made my  glass of wine free, on that plate would have been nice, because you not only ruined dinner but a birthday dinner. He did not try to apologize for the cooks, to me that says obviously he knows they are nuking cold things and does not care about the quality of the food, which also says inexperienced to me.  Then they try to make me happy with a birthday dessert, I do not want dessert after an awful meal, no, that does not make amends.  I will not be returning, not because of the server but because the food was awful and the manager barely cared. You've lost my business forever. I wish I could give zero stars Update: I was ill a few hours after eating here until the next night, avoid this place unless you like food poisoning."
Bethany C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",64,13,4,2.0,12/17/2014,"So I came here with my two very best friends. We usually go out to eat once or twice a week and try new places. And critique each place. It's a tradition we have had for years. Today the food was mediocre. Good flavor (slightly above average). The portions were average. The time it took to get our starters was decent. And the entrees came maybe 8 minutes later.  The flaws of the night:  Our server didn't use any type of note pad to take our orders. I have had this before but had a better out come from it. There were 3 mistakes made to our orders. Usually I give the server the benefit of the doubt, but since the expos (food runners) had the order slips in hand I could see that it was a mistake in the order taking. I will go into further detail of our orders and mistakes later. The server was very sweet at first. Until  we asked him to split the check (which I had asked him to do when we were greeted), he looked at us seemingly annoyed and walked away. This was the point when we had decided not to tip.  Our orders are as follows: *Seat #1 (Me) Starter salad: Golden Beets Arugula Entree: Toasted Chicken Pesto Sandwich   -Sub cup of Broccoli Cheddar soup (no greens salad)   -Extra side of pesto *Seat #2  Starter: Mini bruschetta Main Course: Classic Baked Potato  -Add bacon, chz, & sour cream *Seat #3 Entree: Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos Errors::: No topping on potatoes (even tho it was an extra charge). Cup of clam chowder not Broccoli Cheddar. No extra pesto. My water glass had been empty for my last 10 minutes in the restaurant.  I will give the restaurant one more chance to redeem it's quality of service."
Xurxo A.,"Concord, CA",26,20,5,2.0,3/30/2014,Food was decent. I liked my strawberry lemonade. Our table was forgotten... Uhm... not coming back.
Kitty D.,"Alamo, CA",64,756,913,3.0,10/1/2013,Tried the happy hour in this strip mall location. Staff were nice and accommodating and we got the patio seats. The ambiance was OK but it was very mall like.  Menu selection was varied and seatings were plentiful. We got the patio seat and I had a salad. Nothing outstanding.
Jan Jeric M.,"Sacramento, CA",167,45,48,3.0,10/22/2013,"Dinner at BJ's is always a hit or a miss. You'll either like or dislike your dinner/lunch depending on how good the cooks and waiters/waitresses are that night.This night, my entire group was 50/50 on our meals. Three of us had soups, salads, and light dishes. All were very good; especially the tomato bisque! The other two had salmon and pulled pork. The salmon was over seasoned and the pulled pork with fries was not cold but not warm either. Both were okay. Dessert... that's an entirely different story altogether. We were all full from our meals but one of our party insisted on getting a pazookie party platter. Five of us on one pizza size pazookie? I didn't think we could do it. We ordered a red velvet, chocolate chunk, cookies and cream, and peanut butter. IT WAS AMAZING!!! I was a believer after that, and we finished every last scoop. Overal: 3.5 stars because the food and service is never consistent. It fluctuates between good and bad. But the dessert never disappoints. You can't leave BJ's without getting a pizookie!"
Taylor B.,"Brentwood, CA",214,29,73,3.0,2/14/2015,"okay. let's start this review with the beginning to end. first of all, we found a booth in the bar on Valentine's Day! We were super stoked. So that's not a problem. Our server Kristen approached us, room our drink and appetizer order which was perfect. I ordered a Raspberry Lemon Drop and my boyfriend ordered a Widmer Hefeweizen. The drinks get to our table and he tastes his beer and let me just say, it tasted like fireball was mixed with it. So we ask and the server goes, ""oh yeah they make it all citrusy and stuff, I don't know why."" ....... okaaaaaay? You could've told us before we ordered it haha.  Second, we did not see our server for a good 30 minutes. She passed by, talked to a couple other of her tables, etc. I'm not one to bicker at the server because I understand they may be busy due to it being Valentine's Day. But I mean, go through all of your tables equally and just try a little harder to earn your tip. She was so nice but not the best server. It could've been a better night had it not been so busy."
Janine C.,"Eastside, Las Vegas, NV",0,1,,5.0,8/1/2014,Celebrated my 21st birthday here! I was just visiting this area and chose Bj's because I knew it would be worth it and it was!  Our food came out hot and within minutes!(we preordered online). After finding out it was my birthday our waitress told her coworkers so I was wished Happy Birthday a ton! It was great! I felt like they genuinely cared.
Cherish D.,"Saratoga, CA",46,29,7,2.0,9/22/2013,We ordered a pizza with no meat as we are vegetarians. My bf noticed there was a lot of missing cheese on his pizza then saw the ham. There was ham sprinkled all over the pizza then picked off. Tomatoes were thrown on at the last min. We couldn't find a manager anywhere.  I'm giving them two stars bc they gave us a $20 gift card and made us a new pizza.
Trang W.,"Martinez, CA",64,130,1005,3.0,2/12/2012,"I think the change in ownership also changed their food.  I ordering their chicken tortilla soup off their new menu and when it came to the table, I had to asked the waitress if the soup was really what I order, I could not find ONE piece of chicken in the soup.  Also I recall when I first came there, the soup bowl they had for a small was a good portion, and their large was LARGE...now it looks like they are resulting to big flat plates to give you the illusion of a big plate, but it's so small I don't even think it would be consider ""small.""  BJ is getting to be like many good restaurants gone bad--started off with great taste with fresh ingredients to one that short-cuts their customers on taste and still charge them the same price. I thought I was going crazy but even my other friends who go there often said the food is not as good as it use to be.  Kind of disappointed--thought we found a good place, now it's just another ""chili""--hit and miss menu."
Ysa B.,"Vallejo, CA",2,7,2,2.0,4/18/2016,"The staff appears friendly but they should listen better and be specific with what the order is.  I ordered a New California Supreme Pizza and I received not what I ordered.  It turns out the waiter only wrote down what he thought/assumed was the ingredients of the Pizza ""Spinach and Artichokes"" but not the NEW CALIFORNIA SUPREME PIZZA.  Unfortunately when I realized what I had ordered, our waiter was on a dinner break and someone else took over.  When I asked the waitress that took over ""Excuse me what kind of Pizza is this?""  she responded really RUDELY and said, ""What do you mean what is this?""  Then I asked that I could borrow a menu and I showed her what I wanted the NEW CALIFORNIA SUPREME PIZZA and she said, ""Well that's what he wrote on the slip, he wrote ""Spinach and artichoke pizza"" once again in a snotty tone of voice then finally she asked, ""Do you want me to change it?  I can give you a new one.""  Even though I was disappointed and I didn't want to ruin my evening, I just shook my head and said, ""no it's okay"".  But I was not okay so this is the opportunity to express how I feel.  I still gave a 15% tip but honestly with that kind of treatment and tone of voice I shouldn't have."
Jack D.,"Rocklin, CA",5,15,,2.0,4/27/2014,"We chose BJ's because it was familiar and they have a large menu so there is something for everyone. Service was good.  They were very accommodating for our party of 7 plus service dog on a Saturday afternoon.  Wait staff were attentive and pleasant.   Food, however, was cold and bland.  Not how I remember BJ's - maybe they sell enough booze they can phone it in with the food.  The two of us who had alcohol were happy with their drinks.  The coffee drinkers were disappointed that their options were limited to ""regular or decaf.""   Next time in Concord, I plan to try somewhere else."
ser s.,"San Francisco, CA",10,26,52,4.0,11/9/2015,"Ok, I have to start out saying I really didn't want to go to this place this past Saturday nite solely based on the reviews.  However, my S.O. was insisting on getting something to eat as we just finished a brief shopping sojourn at Sunvalley Mall, which in itself left me a bit perturbed as I kept repeating to myself ""I'm not a mall person -- I don't like mall food, etc.!""  Anyway, I couldn't dissuade him and followed him in to this place, asked for a table for 2, and proceeded to wait until a table was available...15-20 minutes, which was not an issue as we had a beer at the bar....chilled me out...his intent I'm sure.  We checked out the quite impressive selection on the menu -- he chose Jambalaya (really well-seasoned and flavorful!) and I the lower calorie chicken  pita wrap, which to my surprise was quite....tasty.  Our servers were polite and our orders arrived promptly.  So, what else than that do you want when you go to a restaurant in the burbs attached to a mall, or in our big insanely over-priced world-class city for that matter?  Well, this place ain't too shabby!  I'm actually recommending it..just don't tell my S.O. that he was right after all.  ;)"
Janice C.,"San Francisco, CA",528,2174,5892,4.0,4/1/2011,"I love BJ's for their deep dish pizzas, but on this visit we took advantage of their lunch specials.  From their small bites menu, we sampled the crispy artichoke bites. These were lightly breaded and sprinkled with parmesan cheese. Although I think without the lemon garlic aioli, these would be bland. Then our server brought out the Ahi Poke. A generous serving of big chunks of ahi with yellow and green onions, served with crispy sesame wonton chips. I liked this a lot! I had the fish tacos which came with red cabbage, onions and delish chipotle mayo. It just worked well together. Dad had the clam chowder and wedge salad. We had a hard time finding our server at the end of the meal, but he worked his butt off considering it was a bit busy lunchtime on a weekday. BJ's has the great formula of keeping lunch specials (from 11am-3pm) under $12 for entrees, having a full bar and being conveniently located at the mall. This is so much better than the food court."
Nic P.,"San Francisco, CA",38,65,38,4.0,4/18/2014,The blend of the atmosphere with the dinning section and the bar section could be different it's is hard when in dinning section With a date and all u hear is cheering
James B.,"Concord, CA",1,15,,1.0,2/28/2016,"After checking in and waiting 20 minutes we were forced to change our minds.  We got up and just walked out.   Multiple parties that arrived after us were seated, all the while we were left there, just waiting, like idiots."
Pat C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,22,,4.0,3/18/2016,Good meal tonight while watching our golden state warriors beat Dallas Mavericks . Our waitress was super friendly and allowed us to sample some of the beers before buying. The calamari appetizer was excellent.
Monica S.,"Merced, CA",4,21,3,3.0,2/2/2015,"Food was nothing special. Pizookie was good. Atmosphere looks nice enough but waiters are horrible. Our waitress complained about another waitress when i asked her if everything was ok (a general question). Killed the mood for me, will not return unless Im too high and want a pizookie."
Jeremy K.,"Martinez, CA",123,87,10,1.0,10/25/2014,"Wow, if there was ever a moment I wish I was a woman it would be now. Sitting at bar, 3 male bartenders, took 15 min for 1st beer. Put empty beer on edge of counter (indicating I would like another) going on 34 min, yes I am timing them and still no service. 3 women have sat at the bar on both sides of me since my empty beer has been getting dusty, both served 2 times already.....so your service sucks, I was going to order food but I need sleep it's Saturday and I need to work Monday morning. Last time here"
Aisha J.,"San Lorenzo, CA",4,8,,4.0,5/5/2015,"I had my husband's birthday gathering here and overall I was very happy! My party of over 20 was given 2 friendly servers. Also, I really liked that BJ's allowed people in my large party to get separate checks! That way I wasn't stuck with a large bill of things my party forgot they ordered. The only real complaints I have is that they took forever to bring out the birthday pizookie. So, most of my guests left before we could sing happy birthday. Lastly, they gave me a scare when I called to confirm my reservation by telling me they had no record of my reservation. Luckily all was figured out the next day and good times were had."
