Aaron P.,"Concord, CA",5,21,3,4.0,10/9/2013,"I ordered the clam chowder as well as the calamari appetizer. both were pretty tasty! the clam chowder could have been a little bit less viscous, but still tasty! calamari was great as well. for desert, I got the infamous red velvet pizookie. still can't say that I have every once had a bad pizookie. great food, and pretty good service as well! Not my first go-to place, but always a great backup to fall onto in case you want to dine late!"
Jessica P.,"Auburn, WA",24,62,7,2.0,7/20/2013,"This was the 3rd time I've been here. And again was disappointed. Maybe they knew they were second choice, after we were told that Lucille's, (the restaurant across the way), told us they had an hour wait.  First we were told it would be a 10-15 minute wait. After about 20-25 minutes, my boyfriend went to go check where we were on the list, and it turns out they didn't even have our name logged in. They took care of it right away of course, after a very insincere apology from the manager. We were seated at a freshly wiped table and the waitress we had was very nice. However, the service was very slow. It seemed as if this waitress had too many tables to wait for. We didn't get silverware until our appetizers came. I had to ask for sides of ranch, twice. The food took forever. The whole experience took about an hour and a half.  The only highlight of the evening was the food. Try their giant stuffed baked potato with chicken (with a side of ranch!). It was awesome. Their fried shrimp is also very good. The cocktail sauce has a kick to it."
Steven G.,"Modesto, CA",84,945,143,4.0,3/1/2011,"Wow this trip was so much better than the first and my love for BJ's has been renewed (get your head outta the gutter, ya hear?!). This time around it was lunch time on a Monday, soooo much better. We got a nice comfy booth, our server was not far behind after being seated and our food came much quicker than the last time. I ordered a Turkey Club and the hubs ordered a BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich. Mine was very tasty and hands down one of my favorite items on the menu. Hubs enjoyed his sammy too but got some stomach discomfort later on, no fault of the restaurant. We'll be back and I am currently starting up a campaign to inundate headquarters to open up a BJ's in my area. We'll see what happens with that ;-)"
Jack S.,"Martinez, CA",0,43,,2.0,4/20/2013,"I will not be going to this BJs again anytime soon.  I have to admit, I used to go to BJs before it was a huge chain and when they basically only had pizza, the original one in downtown Seal Beach...My how far they have fallen. We went last night and a promised 20 minute wait time turned into 40. Then we had to wait for our table to be cleared while the bus stood around and joked. Then we had a 15 minute wait for a greeting and menus. Get the point? getting the check took another 15 minutes, and by the way, they gave us the wrong one. My daughter said the last time she came with some buds, they screwed up the check....twice. Getting the check picked up - another 5+ minutes. The food was average, the pizza not like I remember. I will give 4*s to the Hopstorm IPA, and the apps. But service is a 1*. The crowd is pretty lame, call it diverse ghetto. Fat ladies of multiple ethnicity with tats galore. Dudes with crooked hats and lots of bling, dropping f-bombs. And as we walk out, right past JCP, a bunch of employees were smoking, in plain sight, in an area designated as non-smoking. I smoke, but frick, show some class and when wearing your colors, be discreet! Anywho...find a better pizza joint IMO."
Jonathan Q.,"Concord, CA",235,50,12,4.0,5/9/2013,haha I feel like I come here several times a month. Either cause I cant think of anything to do but to share a couple pitchers with friends or cause they have hella TVs and I just wanna catch a game.  They're food is alright. Its like a fancier applebees or chilies. Very similar food with Yardhouse in SJ. But they're happy hour pizza and appetizers are cool.  They have a cookie/ice cream dessert thing called a pizookie. Nothing special really but the ladies like cookies and ice cream...
Dusty N.,"Emeryville, CA",21,219,13,4.0,2/17/2014,"Came here this evening after a long day of running errands and it was the perfect place to unwind. We sat at the bar and had excellent service from a bartender named Shane. He was so nice and professional and gave us prompt service. It was happy hour so our drinks were only $4 each and the appetizers were cheaper than usual too. Great drinks, great food and great service. I will definitely be back!  Note to the hostess stand.....there were like 5 people standing behind the hostess stand and it was really awkward feeling and intimidating when you all just stand there staring at us when we walk in and out. Why is it necessary to have that many people greeting and saying goodbye? It was just a weird uncomfortable feeling."
Jasman B.,"Danville, CA",0,2,,1.0,8/16/2013,"Terrible service. My husband and I were starving after a day of running errands and we stopped here on the way home for a familiar, no-fuss dinner. Big mistake. Once we were seated we were unacknowledged for at least 15 minutes. We had to flag someone down to get a glass of water. Another 15 minutes later, we flag down that same waiter, who let us know our waitress was somewhere around, to place our order so we could eat and leave. 30 minutes and all we had was water?  Our waitress finally showed up to bring by our meal and was unapologetic for being absent. We asked for tabasco twice until we finally received it--it was just awful service. I know it's BJs and not exactly high end fine dining, but a little bit of customer service would be nice."
Karli B.,"San Ramon, CA",251,10,2,5.0,3/10/2015,"Never disappointed,  atmospheres great, food and drinks are always on point, and service is usually good.  If you want to go for a more lively experience where I think the service is usually a little more prompt, I highly recommend sitting in the bar area. But if your not in a hurry and you want a more private date out, the dining areas great too."
A.B. S.,"GA, GA",0,104,,2.0,7/4/2014,"Stopped in to BJ's for the first time yesterday, after work.  My colleague said he wanted to watch ""The Game"" and this was the place to do it.  He also said to me, ""The food here isn't great, but I like the atmosphere.""  So there it was, at the start and plain as day.  Okay, I am game for (almost) anything, including lunch at a nationally-represented place. The HUGE, four-image TV was impressive, bit without sound, who cares?  Bar was packed, but we found two seats at the far end.  Bartender was busy, so much so that what should have been a 45-minute meal stretched into double that.  She was perky, friendly but all business.  I asked about special drinks and she convinced me to try a pear cider. Good, sweet and not too tart. Ordered two appetizers, as I prefer grazing and was not super hungry.  Chose the Crispy (read: Fried) Calamari, with two dipping sauces, and the Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms I saw on the plate of the diner next to me, who raved about them.  My friend had the Moroccan Spiced Salmon.  Then the wait began.  The place was not super crowded, and yet it took almost 30 minutes for the food to arrive.  My friend's tomato soup was brought to him, but neither of my dishes were forthcoming until his salmon showed up. Finally, a runner brought the plates and by then, I was ready to dig in.  The calamari, a long-time favorite, was properly and lightly coated with a crispy, non-greasy batter and fried just barely past the well-done but still chewy stage.  The alleged Lemon Garlic Aioli was more Ranch-like, but still better than the flavorless ""Spicy"" Marinara, which, at the very least, needed salt.  These were not the large, sometimes-rubbery rings offered everywhere, but smaller circles along with nicely crunchy larger pieces as well. The mushrooms were another story altogether, and not a good one.  The first bite of the half 'shroom I bit into had good fungus flavor, and that was about it.  None of the promised flavors of a ""blend of fresh spinach, BJ's own spinach and artichoke dip, feta cheese, chopped mushrooms, herb bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese"".  That is a whopping seven (7) items, all stuffed into one little cap.  But that ain't the end.  The almost final product is then, ""drizzled with lemon pesto sauce.""  Perhaps.  But the only real, pronounced flavor discernible was a vinegar-y tartness, tinged barely with citrus.  None of the Feta's saltiness, no earthy Spinach or Artichoke notes, not even, again, salt. In the end, the cost vs. value was hinged on the fact that I was full, but not sated.  It was a business lunch and next time, I take my business elsewhere."
Darnella K.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",0,1,1,1.0,4/14/2015,"I called to place a take out order. I saw online that the bacon cheese burger pizza was available; called the restaurant to order it and the staff had no idea what I was talking about and that it was not available. Please update the menu online. So I ended up ordering two DEEP dish pizzas that was $50. I went to go pick up the pizzas that looked like regular pizzas that could pass for Pizza Hut. I even asked the take out staff about the pizza, and they agreed that this is what their DEEP dish pizza is. PLEASE! The only difference is the crust looked like it had been puffed with air. Extremely disappointed I will be saving my money next time and just call Pizza Hut for only a fraction of the price."
Agnes B.,"Vacaville, CA",1,30,,2.0,3/4/2014,"My husband wanted to eat here one night because of the beers, and he really wanted a steak.  Our server seemed bored out of his mind and desperate for his shift to be over.  He gave us the special beer menu, and after ages of weighing the different beer selections, my husband decided which one he wanted.  When the server came back, he said, ""oh, yeah, we don't have that beer right now.""  My husband's second choice?  ""No, we don't have that one either.""  Third?  ""No, don't have that one.""  Do you think perhaps this would have been good information to give us before you dropped the beer menu and walked away?? My husband's steak was fine, but the sides seemed teeny-weeny.  I swear, it seemed like he had six green beans and a mini scoop of potatoes.  Maybe to make the steak look bigger?  My entree, however, really ruined my night.  How can you go wrong with fish & chips?  Maybe when the fish is fried in the same vat of oil as the jalapeno poppers, thereby burning the mouth of someone who can't handle jalapenos.  Instant heartburn too.   By the time the server came back, my husband was nearly finished his steak.  He did offer to replace the entree.  Did I want to wait for another order of fish & chips to be made?  This late in the game, no.  I opted to switch out for a salad, which was incredibly disappointing... practically revolting... ice cold, obviously pre-made (who knows when?) and stored in the fridge, with chunks of ice-cold processed turkey that I would only expect to be on a salad I bought at a gas station.  I ended up taking a few bites only because I was starving.  Can't believe we ended up paying for it.  We just wanted to get out of there.  Can't see myself saying, ""hey, let's go to BJ's!"" ever again.  Bleughhh."
Joe B.,"Hollister, CA",97,226,35,4.0,11/30/2014,Pizza was good but it could use more sauce lots of beer on tap including racer 5 great service
Richard N.,"Honolulu, HI",209,267,112,3.0,2/24/2011,"A-OK.  Right in the middle is a good way to describe this place.  The service is okay, often messing up our order.  Once we asked for a carafe of the sangria and the guy told me, ""we don't do that here"" and we took the menu and pointed to it and said, ""it says it RIGHT HERE that you do"".  He came back and said, ""my manager said okay, we can do that"".  I didn't know you needed to get your manager's approval to sell things on the menu... ?  Also, they are horrible at getting your reservation sat on time.  I understand that they are known to have big parties and that can sometimes interfere with time.  But I planned my cousin's birthday here and we had a reservation for 8:00 and didn't get sat til 9:00 even though our entire party was already there.   Portions are pretty good sized.  Happy hour is pretty whack, not really a good deal and the late night happy hour doesn't start til 10. Avocado egg rolls = YUM Pale Ale Nachos = YUM (ask for these with the shoe string cut fries, its like carne asada fries but BETTER, and even more delicious when you take your leftovers home and microwave it) Calamari = OK Lettuce Wraps = OK Root beer here is DELICIOUS and bottomless (I guess all soda is).  But they are KNOWN for it.  Its really sweet and comes in a giant frosted glass.  They can make you a whole lot of stuff at the bar but they don't carry 151 (no cariboo lous).  DO NOT DRINK THE RED HEADED SLUT.  WORST DRINK EVER."
Leslie H.,"Irvine, CA",0,30,,2.0,3/29/2015,What a disappointment this restaraunt was today. Portions very small and food not great. Eat in southern California BJ all the time and  I give them 5 stars. To top it off manager said he would make an adjustment. Got bill no adjustment.  Chalk it up to bad experience.  Won't be back
Karabella C.,"Concord, CA",56,58,2,3.0,8/2/2013,Very inconsistent food and service to be honest.  Sometimes we enjoy everything.  Other times its a horrible mess.  They have a great kids menu though so we often go when it's family outing time.  I love their rewards program and often redeem my points with no problem.  The hubby enjoys their craft beers :) Really a 3.75
Kim L.,"Walnut Creek, CA",94,46,44,5.0,1/17/2015,Absolutely the best pizza and wings we've ever had. Pizza is out of this world. The beers are exactly as great as you expect them to be! Our favorite is the blonde-but you can't go wrong with any beer you order.
Miguel E.,"Fairfield, CA",23,5,,4.0,2/13/2015,"Went to BJ's to have a few beers while my lady shopped, and Eric the bartender was seriously amazing. When it comes to customer service he knows what it takes. He touches the entire bar and makes sure everyone is satisfied and has a drink in their hand. He took a short break and the service wasn't that great, but when he came back you could see he makes a big impact on that place. Great job Eric. I gave this place a 4 cause of the 2 bartenders that took over when he went on break. They just ignored the whole end of the bar. One guy looked new, so that's understandable, but the other girl just looked like she didn't want to be there. Amazing job to Eric tho."
Debbie B.,"Martinez, CA",12,14,2,1.0,9/21/2014,"I was so disappointed last night 9/20/14  I have been there several times, but my husband has never been there. So for my birthday dinner we decided to go to BJ's . We were seated outside as requested. Got drinks right away. We ordered the flatbread pizza that  when got to our table had hardly ANY toppings!!!! When the waitress came to pick up the plates she knocked over my wine glass that cost 9.00 for about the size of a 3/4 cup of wine. I caught the glass before it spilled on my phone but some wine spilled out!!! When I asked if she would replace it, she told me we can't do that!!! Horrible customer service!!! Then my daughters pulled pork hardly had ANY pork in it!!! My birthday meal was top sirloin  with my two sides was mashed potatoes and broccoli  when it got there, there was 3 little broccolietts . I was so disappointed  for the cost you hardly get any food!! I wanted to add a photo but can't find where to do that!"
Darcy N.,"Concord, CA",0,26,5,3.0,2/9/2015,"Adequate service, adequate beer. BJ's strict corporate policy's ensure that if you've eaten at one BJ's, you've pretty much seen them all."
Michael C.,"Vallejo, CA",0,4,,1.0,7/22/2014,"Can't stand this place. About a year ago me and my significant other decided to eat here since it was right next to the mall.  We were seated and weren't even served drinks until 20 minutes later. We tried to be patient and smiled at the waiters and waitresses as they walked by and they never said a word or stopped to ask any questions. 30 min passed and we finally had to flag down our waiter to order.  Another half hour later, not exaggerating, our food never came.  Worse thing is that our original waiter took his break and never told any other waiter anything. We got up and left. Last week we decided to give it another shot. BAD IDEA. Again for no reason whatsoever after an hour of ordering, no food to be seen. Asked to remove the pizza from the bill since we were there with family. When asked where's our food, server seemed surprised. Never again will I come here. The workers are friendly but unorganized, forgetful, and unclear with their duties."
