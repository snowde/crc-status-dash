Jenn Z.,"Orinda, CA",14,20,,5.0,1/31/2015,"Sat right down in the bar. Service was friendly and quick. Great menu. This place is always a great place to stop in for lunch, snack, or dinner. Oh yes and save room for some awesome desserts."
Jaynie F.,"Oakland, CA",592,88,56,4.0,6/13/2013,"The grilled Mahi Mahi tacos on the lunch special were off the hook. A delicious, and creamy avocado sauce and a salsa with a decent kick to add on top. I do not come here very often, however now with these tacos, I just might be back!"
Lisa Z.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",0,3,,4.0,3/2/2016,"Great menu, and the bar area with the huge wall of TV's is very entertaining! The delivery service and curbside pickup is lightening-speed fast. All good!"
Lisa L.,"Oakland, CA",41,76,9,1.0,10/31/2014,"This is the Second time their service has been lousy, and the LAST time I'll ever set foot in this awful place. Soup and a salad, how difficult can that be? After waiting about 30 minutes, we were ready to walk out, just as my boyfriend's meal arrived. A few moments later my salad and side order of cold fries arrived. No setups, I suppose we were expected to eat with our hands. The course ground black pepper in the salt shaker meant that I had to unscrew the top and pour the pepper into one hand and sprinkle it on my food with the other hand. No, the place wasn't packed (1:30-ish in the afternoon), but with the dirty knife in my setup napkin plus the slow service and everything else, it's obvious that this place is being managed by someone with little attention to detail."
Marcus M.,"Ventura, CA",767,138,332,3.0,10/24/2010,"BJ Micro Brews from light to dark *note straight from the menu* BJ's Lightswitch Lager- well with mild or delicate dishes, as well as spicy foods. BJ's Brewhouse Blonde- pairs well with poultry and seafoods. Harvest Hefeweizen- good match with most salads. Piranha Pale Ale- excellent with spicy foods. BJ's Jermiah Red- is best matched with beef or pork. Nutty Brunette- pairs well with hearty foods and sauces. BJ's PM Porter- a great compliment to barbecued and smoky foods. Tatonka Stout- that pairs well with sweet sauces, toppings and deserts. Similar with most BJ's the interior appearance is the same. After plopping a squat at the bar I was greeted and ask immediately what I wanted. There's nothing like a cold one with a fresh glass of Ahi Poke. It was pretty good. But don't get the Fish and Chips. Breaded Parmesan Chicken, and the Chardonnay Salmon was deeee-licious! Pizooki's are the greatest desert.  Good for groups. Surely you will enjoy!"
Lisa H.,"Walnut Creek, CA",115,786,173,2.0,11/4/2010,"After my dining experience last night, I am not really a fan of BJs.  I prepared myself ahead of time with how slow I expected the food to take, but I swear the whole dining process took way too long!  I was also irritated b/c our waiter asked us multiple times if we wanted appetizers or desserts, I think asking one and receiving a NO should suffice.  I was really thirsty last night, but our water never got refilled, the only thing we got asked about were beer...i don't know if our waiter was trying to up his tip, but the lack of water, combined with the super long wait time for ok food, and the waiter just made this experience blah. The deep dish I had was not good....the pizza reminded me of pizza hut, just with a lot more crust....so the pizza should really be called extra thick crust pizza.  None of the food at my table wowed me, I would really only come back to sit at the bar because then I would be able to get a drink when I wanted and be able to order the flat bread, which is the only thing I like here."
Xavier R.,"Oakland, CA",242,21,12,3.0,11/26/2014,"Overheard and associate say ""omg fuck this place right now!!"" there's a time and a place to talk crap about your job. But not in front of customers and coworkers. I like eating and drinking beer at this place but after I heard that, it killed the vibe. Makes me wonder if the associates get so mad that they'd do something bad to my good or drinks."
Sasha C.,"Fairfield, CA",133,88,83,5.0,10/2/2012,"Normally I come here for the pizza, but everything I've ever had here has been delicious. Last weekend I meet up with a couple of my girlfriends here to share appetizers.  Potato Skins, topped with Shredded jack and cheddar cheese, apple wood smoked bacon bits and green onions, served with sour cream, and ranch dip. At lest a third of the potato skins did not contain enough cheese.  Margherita Fresca flat bread, the classic mozzarella cheese tomato and basil, with Parmesan cheese. Was very good I would defiantly get it again. The new Black and Bleu flat bread, grilled skirt steak and bleu cheese, with mozzarella, caramelized onions, portobello mushrooms, red bell peppers and thyme; was my favorite! It wasn't until after we ordered that I noticed their Oktoberfest menu, guess I'll be coming back soon!"
Dani J.,"San Pablo, CA",1,48,10,5.0,1/15/2015,"Finally a good server ! Came here with my boyfriend and for some reason, no matter where we go, we end up with crappy service. Alex was our server for the night and he was fantastic! Really funny and genuine and was an overall great server. Food was great also !"
Ashley L.,"Concord, CA",10,25,8,5.0,1/13/2015,"Waitress was friendly and attentive but not in a way she interrupted the meal it was very pleasant, not to loud.   I had salad it was extremely good tasted really fresh.  Friend had sandwich and fries they were cooked perfectly.  Would definitely recommend it."
Samm A.,"Benicia, CA",23,22,1,5.0,1/13/2015,I was taken here today for my birthday by my friend Chris. I had the best burger. And then a mini Pazookie. It was so good. Our server was so helpful and courteous.
Amanda N.,"Richmond, CA",130,20,1,1.0,1/6/2016,"The lady was rude, she had a sarcastic attitude with me when I simply asked a simple question!"
Meg W.,"East Bay, CA",266,885,371,1.0,9/6/2012,"I should've listened to my gut and my previous reviews and not gone back here.   4 out of 5 silverware settings dirty 2 rootbeer floats forgotten Steak ordered med-well came rare Crispy jalapeno burger was cold, had no flavor, and just looked sad.  The beef patty itself was torn into three pieces.  There were three little deep fried jalapenos smushed inside, but you couldn't taste them at all. The bun was ridiculously huge, dry and cold. Mahi-mahi rice dish embarrassingly small. Waiter's attempt at a bartender's slide of a glass of water across our long, long booth ended up in disaster, toppling over, streaming ice cubes and water down the length of the table and a cascading down to the floor.  The waiter handed me four towels, asking me to clean it up. The California Club pizza app (flatbread with chicken, applewood bacon, tomato, and avocado) was good, but certainly not good enough to suffer through anything else here. Oh, and you'll have a good wait outside before any of the fun stuff begins.  Maybe I thought service would improve since it's now been a while since they opened.  Fool me once, fool me twice, fool me thrice.  The End."
Azn B.,"Oakland, CA",620,156,139,4.0,5/30/2013,"Although a short experience, the food here was pretty delicious. Just food done right. SERVICE was spectacular. The servers look like they were on drugs, I swear! The fast moving, the constant talking before I can even answer their first question, making sure they heard my requests even when my dinner date cut me off with a question. They were on point, other than the fact that they gave us this small little corner table that was an add-on and the seats & tables were like a foot shorter than the others. We asked to change tables and they were debating it with themselves. Another older couple sat on the same table after us and they just plain left. Plus they served us piping hot food and left us staring at it without utensils for, what seemed like, forever. Complete torture. FOOD Soup of the Day - Clam Chowder. Flavors were good, but it was incredibly salty. Unbearably salty. Inedibly salty! I was super hungry so I finished it with all of my oyster crackers. My dinner date agreed that it was way too salty and did not want anymore of it. Baby Back Ribs, full rack. SO DELISH! Perfectly cooked ribs. They were moist and finger lickin'! I was super full and I still ate a couple more ribs because reheating it wouldn't do it justice. My only complaint is that they didn't sauce it enough while cooking. A couple of ribs on the ends didn't even touch BBQ sauce. I'm not a big BBQ sauce fangirl, but at least a smidgen of it is needed on ribs! Potato Skin. Probably one of the better potato skins that I've had. It's cut into small segments (I hate them when they're way too big to eat) and pops right into your mouth! They look like they're fried because it was super crunchy and crispy.  Beer - Snakebite. Super cold, which makes it so much more delicious! Really clean flavors. Best thing was that it wasn't an overpriced beer!"
Karlo B.,"San Jose, CA",258,115,157,1.0,11/28/2014,I'm writing this review while I'm sitting at my table. Came here for lunch on Black Friday and it's not that busy. I've been waiting 10 minutes and still no server. Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm­mmmm still waiting. I'm falling asleep.........
Jason P.,"Dickinson, ND",4,106,262,5.0,6/26/2014,Didn't go here with high expectations but was proven wrong! Their house root beer is amazing!!! Presentation of all food was unique and taste was on point!! Our server was a young white bald female that I wish I could of got her name but displayed great service!! Kudos to her for sure!
Penelope V.,"Concord, CA",62,77,,4.0,8/26/2013,"I am a creature of habit and always get the same thing when I come here. I LOVE their BBQ Chicken Salad. It never fails to fill me up. The fried onion on top, YUM! i'm sure it's not very healthy for you but ohhhh so good. I'm not a huge fan of beer so when i do order beer here it's always on the lighter/fruitier side. The wait never really bothers me too much, i don't think we've ever had to wait more than 25 mins for 3 people.  I come here with my daughter and my boyfriend, the place is loud enough for my daughter to not get on anyone's nerves. And they have a good kids menu. I've never had a problem with their service. Everyone is friendly and helpful."
Maximilian R.,"New York, NY",53,61,12,2.0,12/31/2012,"The service was slow and the portions were meager at this place: here's why (below)--- 1. 3 of us sat at the high tables near the bar it took 8 minutes for a waiter to come and just set our silverware.  2. I ordered the lunch salmon with rice & vegetables, but the plate was more like rice and vegetables sprinkled with salmon. Seriously, this was weak. (the server did bring out a side of tortilla soup though to make up for the lack of salmon).  3. The rice and vegetables were not that good. I have have better fried peppers and onions before.  4. The Arnold Palmer that I ordered was barely sweet. I was definitely disappointed with that. The Tea to lemonade ratio was off for sure.  The atmosphere is also loud, so you have to talk louder than usual to have a conversation with your company. Keep in mind, this is a high volume chain restaurant so they serve tons of people everyday. On that note, the food felt rushed and again, the service was slow too.  This place might be good to grab a beer and watch Sunday football, but not too much else."
Jill E.,"Clayton, CA",20,15,1,5.0,12/18/2014,I love this place! I love the food! I am a club member and am always treated well and take advantage of the deals whenever I can. I have had off nights here and there (cause I come a lot). Once my steak was a little more done than I liked and I just happened to mention it when the waiter asked how everything was The server INSISTED on taking it back and bringing a new plate even though I was just gonna deal with it. One night I came late and there was an issue with only one server. I could tell it was an off night but as I had brought a guest I felt disappointed. I wrote the manager a letter and not only did he issue me a discount but wrote me a personal thank you for my letter. I will always choose this place when I am looking for a wide variety of consistently tasty food and reliable service.
S T.,"Vallejo, CA",0,1,,1.0,2/8/2016,"Horrible service!!! And pizza is just warm! And when you ready to eat, there are no silver ware!"
