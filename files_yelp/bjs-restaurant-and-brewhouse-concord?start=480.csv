Karene M.,"Elk Grove, CA",91,3,,1.0,12/13/2014,"I've never had such a bad experience at this Bj's before until today. First off, we ordered and waited for about an hour to get our food. 3 out of 4 of what we ordered were all wrong. And on top of that, everything tastes disgusting. I'm so mortified at my experience here!!! What happened? You used to be so good."
Josephine S.,"San Pablo, CA",1,1,,5.0,1/21/2015,"A friend and I went to BJ's for dinner since that's our usual go to place when we're out shopping.  Our waiter was Will, he definitely made dinner awesome. Polite, funny and kept me laughing , even lit my candle for me on my desset . Thanks Will for the great service you provided."
Matt H.,"Concord, CA",18,10,2,2.0,10/22/2015,"I usually don't go to BJ's during my lunch break since it takes too long to get food, but I discovered their mobile app recently which I thought would make things very convenient to order in advance. Two days in a row now I've had problems (yesterday my burger arrived with no cheese, despite the request being very visible on the receipt), today they clearly didn't start making my food until I arrived to pick it up. They had sent me a confirmation email with the pick up time clearly stipulated, yet I spent half of my lunch break waiting for it to be brought out. My biggest problem in both cases was the lack of accountability for error, in both instances an employee gave me an excuse that was clearly meant to distance the restaurant from the problem, rather than accept responsibility. Yesterday it was ""oh well the order just didn't print correctly"" (they showed me the slip and it printed just fine), today ""your food isn't ready but it's being bagged up"" (took nearly 20 minutes to ""bag"" my food, clearly a lie). To BJ's: take responsibility for your errors and stop treating your customers like they're idiots. You get two stars because the food, when it finally arrives, is quite tasty, otherwise you'd have 1 star."
Noelle N.,"Vallejo, CA",53,21,,3.0,1/25/2013,"Wait: Two stars Food: Three stars Service: Five stars  Hubby and I went to BJ's Brewhouse tonight on a whim. His first visit, my third. The wait for a table was almost an hour, but I kept telling myself the food was worth the wait.  After we were seated, it was another 8 - 10 minutes before our server could get to us, but  when he did he was friendly and courteous.  We ordered calamari, the roasted veggie flatbread and chicken fried steak with green salads.  The calamari was done perfectly - the breading light and crisp, the meat tender and flavorful.  The aioli had a delightful garlicky bite that balanced the mild flavor of the fish beautifully.  The flatbread was very tasty, although the toppings were very uneven - an oversight that was easily rectified.  Then we were served our main course.  I love chicken fried steak, and eat it only on very rare occasions and dug in with gusto. The breading was beautiful, dark golden and crispy. I took a bite and paused tasting . . . . nothing. I added some salt and pepper - still nothing.  When our waiter came back, I explained the situation to him. He was immediately apologetic, offered us an alternative entree, and assured us that he would ask the manager to ""take care of it."" (And it was - far above and beyond what we expected)  Their house-brand sodas are very good, the cheddar mashed potatoes were delicious.  Aside from the chicken fried steak my only critique is the house salad which was straight out of a 1950's diner. Iceberg lettuce, cucumber, tomato, julienned carrots and croutons. BORING.  Overall, a good experience."
Tammy H.,"Warren, MN",0,12,2,2.0,7/6/2015,Nice place always great food.   This location has poor customer service at the bar.  Never a smile.  Bartenders laughing and smiling amongst themselves but treating the customer like a nuisance.  This is the second time now I've  experienced this.
Krissy L.,"Bronx, NY",255,203,79,4.0,4/2/2013,"Definitely my go to place.  On normal days you get seated almost immediately. Always a good idea to make reservations though since the place tends to be packed in the evenings - like 15-30 minute wait.  Ambiance is as you'd expect from a BJ's- it's like any typical american restaurant chain. It's pretty clean and it's moderately noisy here.   I never had issues with the service. In fact it's always been pretty great for me. The waiters/waitresses I've had were always nice and helpful. They always have something good to recommend when we ask and even give out free samples of some beers to try out if you're unsure of your choices.  The highlight is definitely the food and beer- always great here as in any other BJ's so you know it wont be disappointing to eat here. Overall, great place to head to when you want a beer. Best to make reservations if you plan on coming in on the evening but the wait isn't too bad on non-game nights."
Shaneka S.,"Emeryville, CA",27,148,64,1.0,9/3/2015,First.....I want to start off by saying they serve an awesome pink Cadillac and the pizza is good when it's hot.....I was here yesterday and the pizza was Hella good and hot.....the first pizza I got today was cold in the middle....the cheese wasn't even melted all the way....after one bite I sent it back and the waitress said I would get a new one.....she brought the same pizza out reheated.....she offered it to me while a new one was being made.....but I refused to eat it....because it looked overcooked......the replacement pizza was slightly hotter.....but the Italian sausage was cold smh......I waited Hella long to eat so I didn't send it back but I couldn't eat more than half because by that time it was super cold.....when she asked me how was it I told her the truth.....it was only a little better.....she offered nothing.....pizza still was on my bill.....on the bright side I had three pink caddy's while waiting.....had she taken the pizza off I would have gave her a tip....comparable to the price of the pizza.....it's not about the money or free food.....it is about quality and if the kitchen fucked up she should have taken it off my bill.....
Stewart B.,"Castro Valley, CA",12,256,137,4.0,7/1/2013,"We have come here a few times and we enjoy the food and beer.  I am a big fan of Big Poppa Smokers and heard recently that BJ's was using some of BPS recipes for there Blue Ribbon BBQ.  Big Poppa won the Royal Oak last year, so good BBQ was to be expected. The Baby Back Ribs with the SWEET MONEY CHAMPIONSHIP rub were awesome.  That rub really is Money.  We also tried the Fries with Jallelujah Seasoned Jalapeno Salt, WOW! We will be back!"
Anna G.,"Napa, CA",42,23,6,5.0,6/22/2014,"Earlier today I started raving on an internal survey after signing up for mobile pay with Bj's, and realized I really needed to share my experience here. I was ""that person"" arriving late with my sister for a Saturday night late for a quick bite... and by late I mean the restaurant looked like it was closing down. Shame on us, but we couldn't have been treated better by the staff. I had to do some searching for our servers name ( Will Hoss ) but I defiantly recommend sitting in his section if you want to feel like a VIP!!!  We ordered a build your own pizza with the recommendation of our server! AMAZING to say the least."
Shazz S.,"Antioch, CA",3,6,,3.0,12/28/2014,I love the food here but if your not sitting at the bar and you have a party of more than one be prepared to spend 1hr before your food is ready horrible with time!
Zack R.,"Lafayette, CA",16,2,,1.0,6/23/2014,"I have loved BJs since we lived in Orange County 10 years ago, but the poor service and food quality at the Concord location have killed it for me :( maybe they will clean house and fix it"
JoAn R.,"Oakland, CA",162,30,3,3.0,4/28/2013,"This place is your typical chain brewery. Good beers and the food is ok. There is nothing on the main menu I would brag about. However, I do love the Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps on the appetizer menu. Its a bit pricey, so try it during happy hour (you get $2 off appetizers). The service here is usually good (not consistent)."
Simon W.,"Walnut Creek, CA",9,97,,2.0,11/5/2012,"Knowing it would be busy we called ahead from the Sun Valley Mall while we finished shopping and were told it would be a 30-35 minute wait for a table for 5. We killed another 25 minutes and turned up at the desk only to find that it was another 25 minute wait. Not the best ""call ahead"" service. The food and beer selection is pretty good with a huge menu. The jambalaya was ok but seemed to have been left under the hot lamp a little too long. One of our soups was forgotten as was our daughter's fries but the other meals were good. We heard the next table complaining that they were also missing a couple of items. I'd recommend checking it out and if the wait is longer than a couple of minutes head down the street to Outback or the Elephant Bar. They need more staff on busy nights."
Jessicka L.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",64,58,1,4.0,7/5/2012,"Northern California, consider yourselves lucky.  BJ's originated in so. Cal. (I used to go at least 1-2 times per week while living there) and, just like the Cheesecake Factory, it finally made its way to Concord and Livermore.  Like I said...NorCal should be so lucky.  Here's why: -If you don't like beer, BJ's will change your mind.  Try the Jeremiah Red. You'll be wasted before you know it.  -The service here has been phenomenal from the servers (not the hosts...they're terrible. Management should work on that).  -The food selection can satisfy anyone. Seriously.  Best appetizer? Spinach and Artichoke Dip.  Best entree? I couldn't choose just one... But the gluten-free pizza is amaaaazing. So are the loaded baked potatoes.  -You can't go wrong in a pubhouse setting. Sure, it can be noisy/busy, but as long as your server keeps you happy -- which he/she will -- the ambiance is pretty fun/inviting.  Anyway, give BJ's a chance.  I can promise you I've had far more experience than half these Yelpers and the Concord location is far superior in service than so. Cal. has ever been."
Butch P.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",6,201,16,4.0,5/30/2013,"I wish they 3.5 star rating because that is how I feel about BJ's. Mixed. My wife and I go there on weekends and sit at the bar. We usually get great service from Natalie and the rest of the staff. The beer selection is great! They offer at least 30 on tap.TV's at the bar and throughout the restaurant-also great. Service in the restaurant? Iffy..Sometimes it's good and others it is just bad. Never rude but they just seem overwhelmed at times.  Now the food. Also mixed. we love the ahi poke and the flatbread pizzas. The ahi is good quality and they serve with won ton chips (you can ask for lettuce cups too). The flatbreads have a light and crispy crust. Their boneless wings never work for me. I ask for the hottest sauce they have and extra on the side. it just isn't that hot and  I am not a glutton for punishment, either. And the wings almost always don't come out hot as if they have been sitting in the window for 8 or 10 minutes. I don't get it. the menu is HUGE! I guess it is true-when you try to be good at everything, you are rarely good at anything.. Sit at the bar, enjoy a cold one. they have multiple happy hours throughout the day. Watch the 49ers or Giants on their huge flat screens. Cheers!"
Andy M.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,6,1,4.0,2/3/2015,"I frequented another BJ's location when I lived in Irvine a few years ago. It was one of the better restaurants if you wanted to be able to hear conversation. This one has a bit more of a sport's bar vibe, but all the same; the food is great and the prices are reasonable."
Randy P.,"Concord, CA",0,6,6,3.0,2/3/2015,"I did get a response back from BJ's  I will certainly go back and give it a try! Dear Randy: I would like to personally apologize for your recent unsatisfactory experience at BJ's in Concord. There is never an excuse for poor service and we take your comments very seriously. I am very sorry for the experience that you had here with the appetizers and us not taking them off the bill.  I have already followed up with our team to ensure that corrective action has been properly taken.  We sincerely appreciate your taking the time to call us and let us know. This gives us the opportunity to apologize to you and to learn from our mistakes. Your loyalty is very important to BJ's.  We never forget that you have many choices for your dining experiences and that it's our responsibility to earn the privilege of serving you.  Please accept the emailed $25 courtesy card, not offered as an excuse or compensation for poor service, but offered with the hope that you will give us another chance to ""wow"" you with better service. Thank you again for taking the time and trouble to contact us, and for bringing this issue to our attention. Sincerely,"
Jared P.,"Benicia, CA",24,11,2,1.0,6/12/2014,"Terrible service. Went in on a slow Tuesday night for happy hour & waited 11 minutes for anyone to stop and acknowledge us at our table (the manager walked by 5 times doing nothing). Once served, part of our order was forgotten and still on the bill (even though I let the waitress know) & took another 15 minutes to get my check so at that point I didn't want to wait another 15-20 minutes for that to get adjusted and just paid the full amount. I would not return here unless changes are made!!"
Andrew I.,"Pittsburg, CA",472,221,394,4.0,2/15/2013,"I come here for beer, TV, appetizer, pizza, and burger. I've come here with 2 people and with 10 people. If you make a reservation, you won't be waiting for a table, they'll sit you asap. However, come here on a busy night and you'll be waiting for a while. I really like their beer selection here! Lots of mixed beers, you have to try!! Also they have good size pizza, for a slightly more expensive price than the average. They use a lot of bread on the pizza, unless you get the flat, rectangular ones which are my favorites.  Service is always great here, and I never noticed the long waiting for food time, because most of the time I'm just too busy with the beer, watching TV, or having a great conversation. So a really nice place to chill, but not if you're in a hurry. They have a large dining area, decent patio area (it's shaded), and a good size bar area where you can just walk in a seat yourself. usually though the bar area gets filled first and fast. You can order the same food anywhere you sit.  The lighting of this place is kind of really dim, but the booths are comfortable, the space is adequate, and they keep their bathrooms clean. Perfect for large groups or just get loud with friends."
Olivia S.,"Pittsburg, CA",0,2,,1.0,12/16/2015,"If I could give no stars I would, I went last week on a Thursday night and my server (Kayla) wasn't pleased at all to have us. She didn't smile once and was very unprofessional. Never checked up on me . Not sure if this is her first serving job but she DEFINITELY needs more training. The food was good but not worth it for this service. Won't be returning ."
