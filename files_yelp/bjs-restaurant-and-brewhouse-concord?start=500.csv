Candy R.,"San Francisco, CA",150,40,5,2.0,6/18/2012,"Perhaps because we decided to patron BJ's in Concord on Father's Day, our experience left a lot to be desired!!! We walked into the lobby that was overflowing with people and no order! We decided to call ahead as stated by them, ""Call ahead and wait less time!"" - NOT TRUE!!! When we checked in the hostess told us 20mins. After waiting over 30mins in the stifling heat because the lobby was bombarded with people waiting, I checked back in to find out what was going on...they told me another 45mins!!! WTF??? OK, I get it! It's Father's Day; it's going to be crazy but jeez!!! The wait was one thing and I understand. But the food was NOT GOOD at best!!! We are a family of big body eaters and every single one of us had left overs due to lack of quality in taste! Pizzas were bland and dry! The salads were a bit too tart for our taste and the baby back ribs were dry!!! The worst part was that I had my 3 year old son's food didn't come out until everyone else was done with their meals! We ended up feeding him from our plates. By the time his food came he didn't want it anymore! The server stated that someone stole his plate off of the food line! Really? And yet, it took over 20mins more to get mini corn dogs and fries out to a child?  I'm adamant about good customer service. BJ's extended no hospitality to rectify our experience of poor quality of food and lack of customer service! I'll stick to what I know...BJ's in my hood always comes through. I may give Concord another shot if and when it isn't a day dedicated to special people but until then....BOOOOOOO!!!"
Diane E.,"Los Angeles, CA",300,1074,28,4.0,6/3/2010,"Okay, I'm giving them 2 stars back.  Came here today for a 'going away' lunch with my gym pals (who says you can't make friends with people at the gym when you go at 2:30 a.m.???) and lunch today was phenomenal.  So are my friends who I will miss terribly after I move to Indy. Two of us had the Grilled Fish Tacos...what can I say other than YUMMY!!!  Another had the Grilled Salmon and the fourth had the Mini Veggie Pizza.  All were reasonably priced on the Lunch Special menu.  Waiter was attentive without hovering.  We never felt rushed although they were very busy. The trick with this place is to either go BEFORE the noon rush or well after.  If you are a beer drinker, beer/ale is $3 at lunch.  I didn't partake because I'm not a beer drinker...and some of us had to go back to work :-) I kind of hope there is a BJ's in Indianapolis..."
Megan M.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",54,52,,3.0,10/6/2012,"Pretty much what you expect from a chain brewery restaurant.  I LOVE their hot wings.  The stuffed mushrooms are good too and their flatbread pizzas aren't too bad.  Last time I was there I opted for the avocado egg rolls and they were awful.  after a few mouth fulls of luke warm avocado mush I just couldn't stomach anymore.  If you LOVE avocado maybe these would be good.  I like avocado but no the baby food texture.  They need to mix some crunch in there.  Ended up eating some of he beef sliders my husband got and I was pretty impressed a how good they were. In the past I've gotten the shrimp lettuce wraps, which weren't too bad and low calorie.  Trouble was the shrimp was barely cooked.  When we asked about it they said that is how the dish is supposed to be.  They did cook our shrimp some more, but I haven't ordered it since because I don't want to be that picky customer who's like ""can you really make sure the shrimp is cooked?"" Good beer, good cocktails.  Not the best happy hour, but we live close so I'm sure we will back!  Especially the next time I'm craving hot wings!"
Gregg W.,"Martinez, CA",5,21,1,1.0,11/12/2012,"Went at about 5 pm, Monday, November 12. Restaurant was busy but by no means full. Appeared to be plenty of wait staff. And yet, after 20 minutes no one even brought me water much less took my order. So I walked out.  Based on other reviews and tips, be prepared for a long wait for your server."
Layla P.,"Isla Vista, CA",0,11,,1.0,6/8/2016,"Shout out to the girl who decided to charge me extra money on the tip last Friday on my graduation. On June 3rd, I came to BJs after my graduation around 12am and I sat in the second table on the middle right side in front of the restrooms. My waitress if I remember correctly was a white blonde (maybe platinum blonde) girl. I ordered 3 of the mini pazookies for my cousins and which costed around 10 dollars. Sure I apologize for not leaving a good tip BECAUSE I HAD NO MONEY IN MY ACCOUNT.  I had enough money to just be able to pay for the pazookies which is why I chose to purchase it only. My money has been going to college. I'm not a rich girl who won't notice any extra charges to her account. This waitress probably decided to add a extra 6 dollars to my account and thought I wouldn't notice. My account was overdrawn because of her and if I did not catch it I would have been charged a extra 25 dollars from my bank because of this desperate girl who thought it was okay to do what she did. This is not OKAY at all. Beware coming here because you'll get screwed over. STOP going here and go to Lucille's BBQ instead since it is right by it. I've been going to Lucille's since they opened and nothing like this has ever happened to me!! I hope karma gives this girl what she deserves."
Rich P.,"Antioch, CA",68,654,137,2.0,7/1/2012,"So, this is an update to my last review. Everything about my last review still stands - good food, good beer. Try their IPA and/or the Nit Wit - very good. Why the downgrade? Service. It was atrocious. The drinks came quick, which was nice. We ordered our food (two mini pizzas and a salad). It took 30min for the salad and another 40min for the pizza. During this time we heard nothing from our server. He was too busy with the group of 15ppl that had been seated in his section. When our food finally arrived, it was cold. It took another 5min for the server to get us some ranch.  I get that the guy was busy, but at least check in or ask a co-worker/manager for some help."
Natan O.,"San Francisco, CA",173,73,,2.0,5/12/2013,"Going to a chain restaurant there are some things that you have to expect coming in...the vibe is usually the same across the board and the food is usually mediocre / semi decent.  While BJ's met the vibe expectation, the food did not. I was impressed by the cleanliness of the restaurant and prompt service.  The wait staff was spot on and they were very friendly.  These positive statements were unfortunately overshadowed by the sub-par food.  I ordered the California chicken sandwich, and if it weren't for the fact that i was starving I would not have finished it.  The bread was soggy, chicken dry, avocado stale and just didn't taste great.  French fries were clearly frozen and tasteless.  The blonde ale I ordered was the only thing that got me through my meal. I will never come back to BJ's unless it's just to get drinks."
Edrienne G.,"Concord, CA",42,103,37,3.0,3/29/2013,"I had a dirty fork and dirty knife, and apparently so did the table next to us because they complained about their utensils also. It took over an hour and a half  to get two drinks and one pizookie. On a Wednesday night. -_____- I also ordered a pizookie to go, for my dad. She brought it out, and took the check, but came back like 15 mins later. by then, my dad's ice cream had already melted.  They have good food here, but the service sucks."
Jon G.,"Santa Rosa, CA",1,33,2,1.0,10/4/2012,"0 STARS! A couple of these Yelp! reviews mentioned that BJ's carried NFL Sunday Ticket so I stopped in this last Sunday to watch my team.  The restaurant was busy, but there wasn't a long wait and me and my roommate sat in a booth in the bar. The booth itself had not been bused from the last customers, but we were advised that we should take it before someone else does.  I had to flag the manager down 10 minutes after sitting down to request that my table be bused.  The server arrived 5 minutes later to give us menus without taking our drink order.  When she returned she took our drink order and our food order and I proceeded to wait 30 min before getting my beer.  I actually got my food before either my roommate or myself got our bar drinks. The burger I ordered was cooked right but was bland and the sauces I had requested on the side did not come with the burger, I had to ask AGAIN to get them.  The water that I drank while waiting for my beer sat empty during the entire meal. On top of all of this, BJ's double charged my debit card.  I am really not a picky person when it comes to restaurants as long as the food is alright and the service isn't horrendous.  Our server spent more time flirting with the old guys at the table next to us than she did trying to make sure our experience was at all reasonable. Horrible service, unimpressive food and time spent reversing an extra charge.  Will not return."
Gina H.,"Concord, CA",161,402,39,4.0,12/5/2010,"A-Okay with me! Our server was quite nice to us this afternoon. It was a wet wet day and we didnt want to take our litle one out anywhere far... with the options among us we chose to come here for the first time as we knew the selection of food we could choose from would be plentiful. Despite the rain, our service was excellent. We were seated promptly and given a chance to settle in with our little one.  Our server was very nice and recommded certain beers for my sig other while giving us a children menu and crayons for our little guy. We ordered a small BJ pizza and the meatloaf sandwich... not really knowing what to expect. He even gave us the mashed potatoes and applesauce for our little one on the house. What a great guy. I had a great time there. He was busy with other tables but made sure we were taken care of. Our food came out in good time, not the best, but I dont know how busy they really were as we were in a booth where you couldnt see much. I recommend this place if you have kids, its very family friendly . The prices are a bit steep for the appetizers... they cost the same as an entree so we nixed that step and went right to the food. The deep dish pizza, OMG, so good! It reminded me of Zachary's in Oakland's Rockridge area...since Zachs is a bit of a drive now, if we are feenin' for a lil Chicago style pizza, we may just zoom on thru to BJ's. The meatloaf was really good, needed some spicing up so I asked for Tabasco and the mashed potatoes could use a bit more butter and seeasoning as well but hey its not a 5 star place right? I would be back, probably for the pizza and to watch a game some time soon!"
Frank and Carol P.,"Martinez, CA",36,44,8,2.0,5/28/2012,"Underwhelmed. Came here for lunch today, ordered the deep dish Chicago style pizza. I wasn't served deep dish Chicago style pizza. I was served an inch and a half of sponge like bread dough with a thin layer of toppings with almost no red sauce. The pizza was dry. A Chicago style pizza should have a nice hand tossed pizza crust,  many layers of tasty toppings, cheese,a thick layer of red sauce, and another sprinkle of cheese. Chicago style pizza this was not. So, if you're by Sun Valley Mall and you're craving good pizza, drive down the street four blocks and go to Melo's Pizzeria. If you are craving really good pub/grill restaurant go to Jack's in Pleasant Hill. It's not a chain restaurant, the staff is happy to see you, and the food is so much better for the same price."
Stephanie H.,"Hercules, CA",116,37,12,1.0,10/10/2012,"Food was okay. Drinks were okay but expensive. No happy hour?? Maybe I wasn't informed that there was one. BUT I want to review our waitress of that night. I wish I could remember her name BUT I will just say SHE CAN NOT COUNT OUR MONEY THAT WE PUT WITH BILL TO PAY with rest on card!!  Apparently, she didn't realize that she put the majority of our money out of the way when counting so my friend got over charged on his debit card. We told her and she corrected it. Couple days later, he realize they didn't reverse his charge on his card, talked to the manager and told him to file a claim/fraud with the bank to get his money back. WTF KIND OF SERVICE IS THAT?!!! IM NEVER GOING TO EAT THERE IF IM WITH PAYING CARD!! FRAUD!!  Lesson learned: PAY WITH CASH! Also we waited like over 30 minutes for our dessert of pizookie.  Boo this place! Hire new waiters or something."
Eleanor D.,"Hercules, CA",143,148,171,2.0,8/28/2010,"It's just your typical american cuisine bar food.  I came here with a bunch of friends today hoping for some good quality food. We ordered  Fried Calamari Pot stickers & for an entree i ordered the chili cheeseburger. So for starters the calamari was heavily breaded, and the squid was non existent. The potstickers were basically the same as the ones you buy at costco and make yourselves. As for what i ordered.. I wanted to throw up after the third bite.  The plus side of the whole experience was that our waitress was extremely helpful and nice."
A D.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,14,4,1.0,11/3/2012,"I'm not even gonna give you a review on their food because no matter what you order, if you receive bad service.....it leaves a bad taste in your mouth altogether! I always have bad experience of SERVICE at BJ's.  I don't know if that's how they train their staff, but this place had terrible service. Our waitress took our order....she had help serving the food since we were a big party.  After that I never saw her again until one of my nieces had to get up herself and direct her to our table.  She never even came back to see if we needed anything else.  Somehow, we always have to wait at BJ's for additional items we might need for our meals.....never fails!   We ordered dessert cause we had to wait for our other party to finish their meal....our waitress took our order and you would think at that point she should've emptied our meal plates to prepare for our dessert.....but no she failed to do that as well.  Then she served our dessert and she still didn't take our meal plates away which at that point, I just pushed in the middle of the table.  It was an awful experience.   Our waitress thought she was gonna get a good tip from us....we were a party of 12 and to my husband's disappointment again at BJ's....he left her with no tip at all!  My husband is a good tipper....he'll even tip our donut place $10 for a dozen of donuts, but this time....she could've received a good size amount of tip especially for our large party.  TO OUR WAITRESS......you never know who you're gonna be serving......that's too bad! P.S......I know the logistics of being a Server since I was a waitress myself as my part time job while in school and my husband was a Chef.   Other bad experience at BJ's....Daly City and Brentwood.....WTH....does BJ's train their servers this way!"
Tam F.,"San Ramon, CA",489,1397,253,2.0,4/5/2010,"I would definitely like this place better if I were a beer drinker or was out with girlfriends and wanted to try one of their fruffy drinks, but alas, I was here with the family for lunch and it was pretty meh. The place is like a sports bar/pub/chain restaurant rolled into one. I think as they have expanded the chain and what I can assume the menu, there has been a lot lost on the food but probably made up for in the drinks (or maybe they depend on the drinks to numb the taste buds?). We were seated right away on a semi late lunch for a Saturday afternoon and our server pounced on our table immediately to take our drink order and ask if we wanted an appetizer. While I appreciated her enthusiasm, I was a bit put off at the rushing feeling I had with her approach.  I advised her it was our first time at the restaurant and it would take us a bit to figure out their large menu and she just shrugged and said ""oh, okay"". I think I am used to more savvy servers or something.  We perused through the extensive menu and husband ordered a mini pizza( he was the smartest of the bunch) as the rest of the offerings were a mix between Cheesecake Factory and Claim Jumper rolled into one (but with smaller portion sizes). Daughter had shrimp tacos and I had a chicken club sandwich on sort of soggy bread that came with burnt bacon bits on the sandwich instead of nice strips of bacon. The fries that came with my sandwich were the best part of my meal, but the lack of service put me over the edge. I still don't get how servers can bring fries and not bring ketchup or even ask if any is needed?  The waitress did not come to check on us until the meal was more than half way eaten and asked if we would be wanting dessert. I inquired as to how the bacon was supposed to come on the sandwich and she said it came to me the wrong way and asked if I would like something else. I declined that as well as dessert and she brought us the bill -all charges intact. Had I been paying and not husband, her tip would not have been so generous... We won't be back to this chain as there are others more worthy."
Samuel R.,"La Jolla, San Diego, CA",107,29,48,2.0,5/14/2014,Food is mediocre at best only reason worth going is the pizzokie.. and it's slightly over priced
Vanessa K.,"East Bay, CA",130,1017,485,3.0,12/18/2012,"Came to watch the UCLA v. Stanford game at the bar. Our waiter was really nice and service was good. I used to love BJ's while in college, but no matter which location I go now, it's just not the same. Is it me or is the food lacking and depreciating? Also ordered the p'zookie afterwards and I was disappointed that the cookie dough wasn't spread all over the pan. I felt I was scammed a few bites."
Melyssa G.,"Bethel Island, CA",42,190,308,3.0,7/9/2010,"I've only been here twice. I did enjoy my personal pizza and salad lunch meal for $5.99. The service was slow that day, and I think it's because we had a big party and many of us ordered pizzas. I can understand the pizzas taking longer to bake. I went there again with my fam of 3 and a friend on the night of July 4th. I was surpised that they were open so kudos for them. We ordered drinks since we were parched. The lemonade was a bit icky, even my 4 y/o said it tasted funny. We decided to order the 3 mini pizookies. OMG that took forever. We waited and waited and waited. How long does it take to bake 3 tiny cookies? It wasn't even busy when we first got there. The 2 guys sitting at a table next to us just got up and left because no one was taking there order. I don't blame them, they did wait while. We finally got our pizookies 40min later. Are you freakin serious? All I know is that if you're going there for the pizza or pizookie, be prepared to wait a LONG while whether it's busy or not."
Monica B.,"Clayton, CA",9,87,39,1.0,6/14/2014,"Ugh.... not good. What has happened to BJs? We came at an odd  time today for lunch (2:30) and were seated right away. Love when that happens, but it was all downhill from there. The runner brought our appetizer without plates. He ran off before we could ask him for some. Our calamari was mostly the tentacles - you know, the spinely part of the squid. Then our entrees came out. The pork chop was really dry and hard to cut. Thank goodness I asked for the sauce on the side because it was cold and sickeningly hot/spicy. I would not have been able to eat the pork chop if it was served with the sauce on it. It came with green beans and red potatoes which were very dry/over cooked. My son thought he ordered a large baked potato, but we found out when they brought out his tiny, overcooked potato that they don't make those anymore. He also ordered a side of broccoli which was in a tiny dish where the broccoli was covered with dried out carrots. There were a total of four tiny pieces of broccoli in the dish. The pizza was disappointing - I would say a tad bit better than microwave pizza. This was their normal crust - the deep dish pizza that some of the other diners had looked more promising. Service was poor. Our empty appetizer plate stayed on our table the whole time, server forgot to refill my husband's tea when she said she would be ""right back"". Server rarely came by and never removed any of our plates."
Rose P.,"Elk Grove, CA",11,16,,2.0,5/4/2014,"Let me qualify this review by stating that I have worked as a hostess and a server before, and so I know how difficult and chaotic the job can be. That said, this place really needs to tighten its gears when it comes to service. Most disorganized place I have been to in quite a while.  A friend was visiting from Sac and we went here just this afternoon for a late lunch/early dinner. Neither of us know much about the restaurants in this area, but we've been to various BJ's before and find them to be fairly dependable  as far as food is concerned. We also know, from previous experience, that service can be pretty spotty depending the location and how busy it is, but this one took the cake.  When we walked in the door, the manager and a host were standing at the host stand and the manager had to tell the host to stop talking to another employee and take care of us first. He left, and rather than seating us in the dining area or letting us know that there was a short wait for tables (it wasn't packed, but they only seemed to be seating in one area of the dining room), she asks us instead to check out the bar area because it was open seating. This wasn't a giant deal (just a little jarring) so we checked out the bar area but found no booths available. We went back to the stand, and they were in the process of seating a group of 3 people in the dining area, so apparently there were free tables available. There were also plenty of tables open in the patio area, so I'm not really sure why the first thing they recommended was for us to seat ourselves at the bar.  In the end, because it was a nice day, we chose to sit outside. They have a pretty large patio area, and at the time, there were only three small tables occupied (two couples and a group of 3 girls), but we still had to wait for them to wipe a table down before we could sit. While they're wiping the table down, the host seating us said, ""oh, let me get some silverware""--this will come into play later--and goes to fetch them. We're seated, and a couple of minutes later, our server comes to take our drink orders (two coffees, a water, a diet). She brings the drinks to us but has to make a second trip for sugar and cream for the coffee. We order our entrees.  I can't say how long it took the food to make an appearance as we weren't in any particular hurry, but it did seem longer than our usual experience. My friend had a cheeseburger and fries. I ordered the fried chicken and mashed potatoes with the gravy on the side. When they put the plate down in front of me, I didn't know what to think. It was probably the blandest presentation of fried chicken ever (and I love fried chicken). The two breast pieces were much smaller than I anticipated, more brown than gold, and were just lying on top of a mound of mashed potatoes--this was everything on the plate.  Luckily, they tasted better than they looked, but you eat first with your eyes, and it was not a sight that whet my appetite, to say the least. Furthermore, that silverware I mentioned earlier? They apparently never made it on to the table, so we had to flag another server down in order to get a fork for my mashed potatoes. We hadn't seen our server for a while, at this point, though she did reappear shortly after the other one went inside.  There were just a lot of little things like this that overall gave the impression that no one in this place has it together. In addition to the above, about ten minutes after we were seated and while we were waiting for our drinks to appear, another server came to our table to ask if we'd already been helped. On the one hand, it's nice that she thought to make sure, but on the other, shouldn't every server know which table belongs to who, rather than everyone having to follow up with all the customers to make sure no one is being ignored/forgotten about? Also, in the time that we were there, three different times, food runners came out asking each table if they happened to order the dish they were carrying--they had no idea what food was supposed to go to what table. (Keep in mind that there were only five tables there after another couple sat down, and three of them were already in the middle of their meal or finished.) To her credit, our server was friendly as was everyone else. It was just the general feeling of disorganization and chaos that really marred the experience. Hopefully they can fix these issues."
