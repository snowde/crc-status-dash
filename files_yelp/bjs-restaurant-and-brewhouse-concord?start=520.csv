Marissa F.,"Martinez, CA",164,21,4,2.0,11/22/2014,I have been here multiple times & never had a problem until tonight. Everyone always tells Me about how much they can't stand this restaurant & I never understood until tonight. We came in on a Friday night at about 7pm & were told it would be a 30-35 minute & that they were out of buzzwords but she took my # & would call me when our table we ready so we went into the mall. 45 minutes past & I called & was told it would be another 10 mins so when another 45 minutes past we finally just went back in & the hostess argued w/ me saying they had called me a while ago for about 10 mins & no 1 responded & the girl who took my # just have just deleted it. I was so pissed that I will never return back. I now see what everyone has been saying.
Sunny T.,"Antioch, CA",65,43,8,2.0,8/4/2014,I think you need to be friends with the staff to get service here. Our food was good our server did not care if we enjoyed it or not she also really never checked back to see if we needed anything or bothered to refill our drinks I think Stacey was more into the table of boys than a table of mother daughter even though I am a great tipper I feel like it was undeserved I guess it would of helped if I was male.
Gina S.,"East Bay, CA",783,70,1232,5.0,6/10/2010,"I can't decide whether to give it a 4 or 5 stars. My friend and I come here practically every weekend after we get our mani/pedi done from My Nails and have to order the spinach & artichoke dip.  That is sooo yummy, especially when the nachos are hot.  Then we order the strawberry lemonade and some entree.  I have tried THAI SHRIMP LETTUCE WRAPS, MAC N CHEESE, SHRIMP SKEWERS, MEDITERRANEAN DEEP DISH PIZZA, TURKEY BURGER, GRILLED CHICKEN PASTA, CHARDONNAY SHRIMP PASTA, CHICKEN WINGS, GRILLED CHICKEN PESTO FLATBREAD, CALAMARI, CLAM CHOWDER, AND BJ'S FAMOUS PIZOOKIE.  Man, I didn't realize I've tried so many dishes already.  But I guess when you have been coming every weekend for the past 2-3 months, you're bound to try a lot on their menu.  Some of the dishes are on the salty side so if you're watching your sodium intake or on a diet, don't order the pizzas or pastas or read the back of the menu.  You won't order 3/4 of the menu.  So if I really like something, I just order it. When we go there, we usually go to the bar area so we don't have to wait.  The wait can get ridiculous especially at night.  Better to hit this place up after lunch.  The waiters/waitresses are great.  We always get this waiter who has a DJ voice or more like he's interviewing for an auctioneer or a voice-over. LOL.  He's hilarious.  Last weekend, I ordered an appetizer and a flatbread and they came at the same time.  I like my appetizers before the meal so that I can have take-home for dinner. LOL.  Anyway, I love the atmosphere and the pleasant vibes from the customers.  The food is the best in the Concord area for sure and when you're done, you can walk it off at the mall.  After all that, I WILL give it five stars after all!!!!!"
Bobby H.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",0,4,,1.0,1/1/2015,"This is our second time here.  I swore I wouldn't go back to BJs again. Last time was about 3 years ago and again last night 12/31/14. Both times we found hair in the food!! YUK!!! And the service was unprofessional. Was ignored, the waiter was just standing around. Took a long time to get our beverages.  The runner served us better than our waiter. We wanted to complain about the hair in the food and asked to talk to the Manager. The Manager never came, he was to busy kissing a female. The bar service is fantasic though. We had to go up to the bar to order our own cocktails.we were taken care of right away and headed back to our table."
Sonia T.,"Antioch, CA",0,4,,3.0,12/26/2015,"I was there for dinner, my plate wasn't enough to make me full, it was very light plate and very pricy. I think it happens because they get busy n they don't know how much food should put on a plate. Like they are working in a dark place  n cannot see how much food should be on a plate for an adult.....pricy , Not enough,...so i am not  totally satisfied."
Joshua C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",9,145,67,4.0,7/6/2014,"I'm not a big fan of Chain Restaurants.  Too much formula & usually average to below average food, however BJ's has some delicious dishes as does Pasta Pomadoro. Not eating pizza just now, but BJ's is good.  Not Emilias or Cheese Board in Bezerkeley quality, but good. I also love their Poke Appetizer, with its homemade chips. At least I think they're homemade because I can't find them anywhere.  I'm not a big beer drinker, however their beers, the many on tap & in bottles are some of the finest.  And my fave bartender, JC, served me today.  My initials too!"
D R.,"Martinez, CA",1,75,,1.0,3/21/2012,"We were so impressed with the food and service from our first visit we came back days later for dinner. I had a personal deep dish pizza and hubby had fish and chips. I'm a little confused about the service here, one waitress comes to take your order, another comes to check on your drinks, then another comes to bring the food??? confusing and we had to wait for refills and extra sauces (quite a long time). Our food came out and frankly I was so hungry from the long wait that I ate my pizza anyway when I should have sent it back. It was cold and rubbery like it was sitting under the heat lamp for quite a while. Hubby didn't care for the fish and chips. Don't know if they just had a bad night or if our good first experience was just luck...ehhh"
Jack P.,"San Ramon, CA",21,318,314,3.0,8/9/2014,This is a large chain place.  Good but not outstanding food and service in most locations.  Better service if you eat at the bar.  Open late night so good standby if your hungry and want a brew - large selection of beers on tap.  Good prices.  I like the chilli and a beer as a night cap.
Elizabeth G.,"Clayton, CA",7,19,13,4.0,8/21/2014,"We went here on a saturday night with my parents who have never been here before, so we sat in the bar area where it was open seating our server was William he was awesome and very knowledgable with menu he had great suggestions with the food and drinks. My dad is very particular with imported beer and hates to try new things,but he knew exactly the beer that would suit him,he was a happy man. The food was awesome and came out on time, i had a peachy-kean, it was way to sweet for me so i will stick with beer next time. So thank you WIlliam for the excellent experience my parents had a blast."
Lynn S.,"San Francisco, CA",9,20,16,4.0,3/12/2014,A broad selection  on the menu. I had the Hawaien Mahi Mahi and my husband had the Parmesan crusted  chicken. Both were delicious. Service was good as well. Bottomless mocktails.
Deniel P.,"Walnut Creek, CA",21,25,,5.0,8/20/2014,GREAT place!!! love the pazookie!!!!!
Timothy T.,"Concord, CA",87,20,3,3.0,10/27/2014,Here at BJ's in this location services a bit choppy depending on where you sit within the restaurant doing to get great service or very poor service I feel that they do training in part of that store and they train on us the customer that being said they do have great food and I feel the clam chowder is a plus!!
Hylynly L.,"Vallejo, CA",33,11,48,4.0,2/11/2014,love the appitizers & desserts. The entrees & pizza are good too but not for the price. The customer service is always a hit or miss. Ive been here many times and had awful service. But thank goodness our server (alexander?) today is really nice & attentive.
Eric B.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",2129,5344,4760,4.0,1/27/2010,"Gayle had a long day at work and came home just wanting to relax, talk, and be served across a nice table.  She also wanted something that was not too pricey, casual, and close, and decided to try out the relatively new and nearby BJ's. Gayle and I thought that BJ's was very good for what it is. The location used to be Houlihan's in the Sun Valley Mall.  And they've done a nice job with the interior.  It has a nice night club meets brew pub feel, and features nice woods, cool bar lighting, flat screen TVs, comfy booths and decent acoustics for good conversation.  The interior of this BJ's is also much classier than the one in Southern California that I had previously been. We were promptly seated and for this Tuesday night, the place was full but not overcrowded.  We both thought that the table service was friendly and accommodating, although the actual kitchen coordination was a bit slow. As for the food, my pulled pork sandwich was delicious and it went very well with the creamy stout that I ordered.  Gayle had less luck with her fish tacos.  The menu mentioned that they were lightly breaded, but I don't think she was expecting a fish stick wrapped up in a tortilla.  In hindsight, Gayle would have ordered the grilled shrimp. I will be back, as I like these sort of ""guy"" places.  Gayle is not so sure, except maybe to take one of her sons out for a meal.  We also left speculating what additional dining options might be possible in the former Left Bank space within Downtown Pleasant Hill. Postscript:   After we got home, Gayle mentioned that she wanted some chocolate.  My immediate response was ""After all that food?""  Apparently that was the wrong thing to say?"
Grace Anne D.,"Concord, CA",265,364,623,1.0,2/4/2010,"This place is only good for drinks and to watch football games. I went there once for my friend's birthday dinner and I thought the place was gonna be good since everyone else said so. I was wrong. Horrible service, the waitress rolled her eyes more than once when we were paying and asking her for things. The prices are high, and I wasn't satisfied."
Katrina F.,"Concord, CA",116,55,8,1.0,6/16/2014,Worst service ever . I gave this place two chances and will not return for a third . I was with my family for dinner to celebrate graduation for my son. What a nightmare. We all got the wrong food and my son never received his food . When it was finally corrected the manager came to our table to apologize and informed us that our one appetizer would be on the house after waiting over an hour for the food to be fixed . Let's me say this if you want over priced terrible service you are in the right place .
Daniel D.,"Concord, CA",827,462,315,4.0,10/31/2012,"Well, BJ's in Concord surprised my girlfriend and I last Friday night with great service and food. We were able to get a table (it was still early) and had a great time. B R I E F  S U M M A R Y -- Parking lot gets full because of the mall, BJ's and 24 hour fitness -- This is one of the ""smaller"" BJ's so it gets packed quick -- HUGE menu like cheesecake factory -- Specializes in beer and pizza but offers a lot more -- Lots of TV's to watch sports and a bar, of course -- Happy Hour is always a win here -- Not personally a fan of their deep dish or new hand toss thin crust -- Thin cut fries or wedge fries, no regular fries -- Service is hit or miss depending on your server -- Soup in their breadbowls are BOMB (most people don't even know about them) -- Calamari was very good, fresh & the tartar sauce was the best -- Most entree' portions are HUGE -- Save room for a pizookie for dessert! (I prefer the glutten-free) I would have to say that BJ's is probably one of my favorite chain restaurants. I love pizza but rarely do I eat it here. Instead I'm eating their appetizers like calamari or chicken wings (they also do boneless - not bad either), their chili or tomato bisque in a their delicious bread bowl, or a burger. I actually prefer their calzones over their pizza, go figure! Last weekend, I could not pass up the offer to try their new hand tossed thin crust pizza. From the description and the photo it looked like a hand tossed pizza crust but when it came out it felt more like a crispy flat bread pizza. It also sucked that it wasn't cut very well so I had to hacksaw it with my dull butter knife. Despite the crust, the pizza toppings and flavors were all there. I ended up with the new chicken bacon ranch and subbed spinach for tomatoes. It was a decent pizza but I will not be ordering the hand tossed again. Before we had our entree's we tried their calamari. It was very good and fresh but I wanted to mention how great the tartar sauce was. It was the best tartar sauce I have ever ate. It was very fresh and refreshing. It completely balanced the fried calamari. We finished it in no time. I always find it hard to believe that some people have not heard of BJ's famous pizookie. It's a small circle pan with whatever choice of cookie you choose served hot with ice cream on top. I've started to prefer the glutten free option because it's a lot lighter but still has all the flavor as the original pizookie. Don't miss out on this awesome dessert! I wish I would have remembered our server's name. He was seriously the best server we have ever had. There were moment when we needed him but he had that ""spider"" sense and would show up when we needed him. We were very please with the meal and makes me wish the San Bruno location was more like this one."
Sarah H.,"Danville, CA",223,364,85,3.0,2/5/2010,"This is a busy, BUSY chain restaurant. If you call ahead, get in line to get your buzzy thing, go to the bar, have a drink, then another, then get lit up by your buzzy thing and head to a table, you can count yourself lucky. PARTICULARLY if you kept your buzzy thing in your pants pocket. I went in knowing the wait, and I was fine with it. When seated, it took me some time to peruse the ginormous Cheesecake factory-like menu to make my selections. I really want to return to this place (after maybe running a marathon, because the calorie counter they include at the back of the menu nearly had me in tears) to try more of their appetizers and drinks. That's really what stood out.  Fried avacado eggrolls were great, made even MORE awesome by our fantastic (no really, super high energy, high level of service, attentive but hella busy perky blonde) server, who noted my aversion to cilantro, and had the dish made without it entirely.  The ""deep dish pizza"" was lame. I got the buffalo chicken pizza hoping to share it with myself for lunch the next day, and I only ate one piece, and it was just meh. Dry yet greasy. Bland and uninteresting. MEH. I didn't even bother eating the rest that I boxed and took home, it was that meh. I just suppose I've been spoiled by the Chicago style glory that is Zachary's. Points for ambiance, and impeccable service. Tipped hugely, because I remember vividly how shit it is to work a so-so location where you biggest tips rarely even out your walk-outs and stiffers. So go. Drink heartily, nom some apps, and don't bother with the pizza, seriously. You can have better."
Brandon F.,"Hercules, CA",996,70,23,4.0,4/1/2014,"BJ's is a chain. The pizza was great, and they have a nice selection of beer. I would come here again to watch a basketball game and munch."
Diana G.,"Dublin, CA",69,85,9,2.0,8/3/2014,"I decided on having BJs for lunch because of the gluten fee options. I was also able to use some rewards pints to make it cost less. While the service I received took awhile, it was with a smile. I like when I order take out for them to show me my food. I had to do it myself. It looked correct and went home to enjoy. I orderd 1/2 chicken bacon Ranch and 1/2 pepperoni with sausage; no onions no tomatoes on gluten free crust. There were onions! :(. I even checked the order on the box and it says no onions. Very disappointing... I'm now eating my gf pizooki and it's not fully cooked. I did not order cookie dough! Took another star off :-/"
