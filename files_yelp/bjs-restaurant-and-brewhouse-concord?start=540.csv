Tim W.,"Concord, CA",0,3,1,2.0,10/13/2013,"Slow service. Pizza came with no sauce. All onions on one side..... Clam chowder was great. Pizza still tasted good even with our the sauce.... Manager computer the pizza.... Don't go here if you are in a hurry...,."
Ashley L.,"Walnut Creek, CA",23,38,12,2.0,5/31/2012,"Came here with my ECE 250 classmates as a celebration of the last night of class. Very nice restaurant, nice flow to it, dim lighting, TVs, etc.  The food was ok. A classmate and I shared a pizza and some pot stickers. The pizza we got was Chicago style, but that's not what we got. We got a soggy crust with minimal toppings. Chicago style has the sauce on top of the toppings. The pot stickers were good though. 3 of us shared a dessert which was delicious. I've been to other upscale restaurants and experienced way better customer service though. I mean I understand it was busy and we were the biggest crowd , but you need to keep up. I mean we got our appetizer at the same time as the entree... isn't it suppose to be appetizer, then entree? Afterward, when we all started to leave , got our check put some money in an waited for change. I had to ask for my change. The waitress wrongly assumed the change was her tip. WOW! That's a big no no. You give the customer their change and let them decide your tip.  Overall , the BJ's looks nice, has some good food, but they really really need to work on their customer service and give their waiters/waitresses some training. I don't really see myself coming back here. I think this place is more for sports lovers with all the TVs they got."
Sean M.,"San Francisco, CA",81,477,8,2.0,1/8/2012,"Where the 1% don't eat.  My first clue about what the food would be like was seeing two thirds of the men hunched over their plates while wearing their ball caps indoors. The women were blond, real and otherwise, loud and over weight. TVs all over with the Pittsburg-Denver game on. So, what to eat? I went with the chicken fried steak thinking that would be one of the better dishes. The gravy was peppery and covered only half of the steak.But, the server brought more for me to pour. The spuds were fine, nothing special, A's were the steamed veggies. The service was very good and earned my two stars and a decent tip. I might give this chain another chance, if my only other choice was a Applebees or a Mickey D's."
Shannon H.,"Brentwood, CA",749,1031,606,4.0,12/29/2009,"Mmm....Do I love this place! I have been anxious to try B J's (what a name) since they opened as well as my friend, so we decided to have a pre new years celebration for the year to come, before the year to come and we celebrated it here. The atmosphere of this place is really aesthetically pleasing -very classic brewery style, with the dark cherry wood throughout along with the cool dimmed lighting and the lively atmosphere creates a great place for get togethers.A little loud for private parties or dates, unless you're not into your date and you want to be distracted as possible this is the place, over all classy and clean. So being the pre planner I am, I will pickup menus form places before hand or go online to look over menus before arriving (funny I know) so they had a menu online, I scanned over there delicious looking menu before departing only to arrive knowing exactly what I would sink my teeth into, I also didn't want to have to overwhelm my waiter with the thousand of questions I would have asked... Just saving time... : ) So for Starters my gf and I had there pomegranate martins (which I had been anxiously waiting to try) Â my friend also agreed with me on my pre planned decision of the great white deep dish pizza, Which is creamy Alf redo sauce, white chicken, garlic, parmesian cheese and thick succulent tomatoes (we shared a small) which was more then enough. Martinis took a little while to arrive but worth the little wait -pretty in presentation and excellent in taste and might I add very nerve calming: )  So this was my first time trying a deep dish pizza and what a great first impression it had with the most flavorful personality ever! This pizza had it ALL!! Rich creamy Alf redo sauce, thick moist chunks of white chicken flavored with garlic topped with yummy parmesian cheese ohh!! And did I mention the thick chewy drenched in butter, soft to perfection thick crust (yes I know so bad) but out of this world good!! I literally could barely eat one piece wow!! So overall My one complaint is the service is a little slow and it took some time to get our dishes though our server was friendly.Other than that, food was up to par with flavor and the drinks were sweet and strong.They are a little pricey,but not too bad consdering what your get. I will certainly be back again!"
Cristi S.,"San Francisco, CA",94,25,2,2.0,7/14/2012,"SUUUPPPER SLOW. I've been there several times now, and each time the service has been extremely slow. They have a very wide selection on the menu and the food is pretty good. However, the extremely long wait time between being greeted, getting drinks/food, and getting the check, has always annoyed my party and I.  Honestly, for the price of the food and drinks, I'd rather just head a few miles down the road to Walnut Creek and go somewhere similar like Pyramid or Cheesecake factory so that I don't have to spend 3 hours on a meal..."
Rob W.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",27,26,3,2.0,4/6/2013,"I love BJ's, but this location isn't up to par. I asked about getting a growler of one of there brews and they fed my some BS about not being allowed to serve beer to go in California. If I didnt used to work at Gordon Biersch where we served growlers to go, I might have bought it. When I pressed them on why, they basically turned to another customer and ignored me. Whatever. That should have tipped me off to what i was in for. I was there to get take out, and when I got my pizza home wasnt fully cooked. Awesome. Go to BJ's. It's a great chain. Just dont go to this one."
Mark W.,"Madison, WI",158,277,18,2.0,9/2/2012,"We had pretty terrible service at this BJ's. Our waitress paid almost no attention to us, despite the fact that we were a group of 8. The food is pretty good, but almost all items on the menu will equal your total daily recommended calorie count. If you don't care about calories, the pizookie is seriously delicious and the only redeeming quality about this restaurant."
Adrian R.,"Concord, CA",2,11,26,1.0,8/23/2014,Fu*k this place with an aids dyck..food taste disgusting and the people that work here suck from top to bottom..one star for the beer which is impossible to mess up but the rest of the crap here taste like dog shyt!
Greg Z.,"Walnut Creek, CA",85,9,,4.0,7/29/2012,"I drafted this review a while back and never published it so maybe it's a little dated. Oh well, here we go. I wanted to hate this place so much the first time I drove by it. Really? Another 'brewhouse'? *yawn* And they named it BJ'S. Are they trying to parody themselves? Then I tried one of their deep dish pizzas.  I now fully endorse BJ'S and everything they stand for. They also have an Ahi Poke appetizer that makes me feel like less of a human being, for I will never know what it's like to be something so beautiful.  Their Mediterranean deep dish may very well be tied for FIRST with a Round Table pizza."
Robert R.,"Concord, CA",333,736,1032,4.0,8/14/2010,"This is where we decided to get dessert, and there was barely a wait. Can you say Trio? We had 2x Pizzookie Trios and tried all six Flavors. Peanut Butter, Triple Chocolate, Oatmeal Cookie, White Chocolate Macadamia, and Chocolate Chip. I forgot to mention Cookies and Cream and all of them were topped with Vanilla Ice Cream. These Desserts are smaller in stature, but big enough to share. (check out pic) We even lucked out and were able to sit in the Bar area and snag a large round booth. I kept looking for Reese Witherspoon to come out and ask me ""Wow, you got a baby in a Bar"", in that movie Sweet Home Alabama. What do I have to say? I got a Sweet Tooth."
Angie V.,"Antioch, CA",284,14,4,2.0,1/17/2014,"To celebrate a birthday I joined my brother, sister and significant others for dinner here. This was my first time here. Here are my thoughts: Parking: Shared lot with a shopping mall made for a bit of driving in circles before a spot became available.  Host[ess]: I entered the restaurant by myself, there were no guests ahead of me. Still, I waited several moments for the 3 host/hostesses to come to a stopping point in their conversation to even notice me. Only one (the male) seemed concerned that I'd not only been waiting, but listening to their irrelevant conversation. I then had to ask not once, but three times where the bathrooms were as the first and second times I received (from two different hosts) a very vague ""just over there"" with a hand gesture pointing somewhere to the back? bar? off to the left?  Server: If I were reviewing the server alone, I would give him 4 stars. He was friendly, made eye contact, got our orders right without writing anything down, was quick-witted, seem to genuinely care and overall was quite a delight. (Alexander, you deserve some recognition!)  Unfortunately though, none of our dishes arrived timely. I do not fault our server for this as we had a different server bring each course. In my opinion, the appetizers were really the only course that should have arrived untimely, as 3 of us put in our appetizer order later than the first 2. This theme carried on throughout our meal though. Entrees came one, then two and two (party of 5). The birthday girl's dessert came immediately after dinner plates were cleared and then the rest of us were asked if we wanted to see the dessert menu. The birthday girl's dessert was done before anyone came back to ask if we'd like to order dessert. We did, and we waited an incredibly long time for that too. There is nothing I hate more than sitting, waiting for the arrival of the rest of the party's food. Those who got theirs, feel uncomfortable knowing their food is getting cold. Those who are waiting feel uncomfortable as they wait hungry, salivating over the food that has arrived. Inevitably, someone insists they go ahead and start. They do, and the hungry continues to wait awkwardly, only to receive their dish just 3 bites before the first served finishes.  Food: Pretty good! The pasta was over cooked on one appetizer and the paired ""garlic bread"" was more like very large croutons - way over cooked. The mushroom appetizer had mushrooms of all sizes, mostly unusually large. Great for stuffing, sure, however I couldn't help but wonder where they came from (GMO, anyone?). My dinner, the balsamic chicken w/ mashed potatoes was just okay. The chicken was over cooked, but just barely. The mashed potatoes had good flavor but were very, very dry and not creamy. The balsamic drizzle was quite tasty, Small bites of balsamic, crispy onion garnish, baby greens salad and chicken made for a well rounded bite. The dessert, the berry pecan cobbler, lacked berries in a way that left me wondering if they warmed up a Costco blueberry muffin and served it with ice cream. If I wanted a dense, cake-like cookie, I would have order the pizookie. I wanted a fruit cobbler though, and that was definitely not what I got.  Miscellany: No one smiled, except for our server at a joke that was made in his presence.  The lighting was so dim that I could barely read the menu. Even more disturbing when I realized I could barely see my food once it finally arrived. My brother thought I'd ordered dessert for dinner as the balsamic looked like hot fudge and the mashed potatoes looked like ice cream. I couldn't tell if I had a berry cobbler or a chocolate chip pizookie.  So, would I go here again? No, especially not with any of my friends and certainly not with my chef husband! I'd be so embarrassed! Do I consider this place kid friendly? No. The menu did not reflect children being taken into consideration. If I were on a playdate of sorts, with kids, at the mall and we needed to get lunch, I would pick BJ's over the other mall options though. Their lunch specials look appealing enough and certainly won't break the budget. As a pregnant woman, the booth was bullshit - I barely had enough room to carefully slide my swollen belly under the table. BUT I did come in late, not with the group, so how could anyone seating our group know?  Who might like this place? Teenagers, young adults and anyone else who might not have experienced quality food or service, or those who are satisfied with mediocre. I could see a young person feeling ""grown up"" being in that environment."
Bruce D.,"Benicia, CA",13,35,43,4.0,11/30/2010,"Nice overall experience. Our waiter Natasha with her big green pen, is fun and enjoyable! Happy hour is great on Tuesday especially because it's half price on all wine, by glass or full bottle.  And yes we did order the full bottle!"
Niki H.,"Oakland, CA",13,30,2,5.0,12/10/2013,"Jeez, I don't know how this place can get less than four stars. The wait time is, meh, but it's worth it. I had my 21st birthday here two years ago and the person who waited on us was one of the best waiters i've ever had. That's not an exaggeration. Probably THE best i've ever had. He even created a drink for me and said I can name it! The bartender working at the time even came over and treated me to a shot and told me some ""breathing techniques"" to do while drinking them. All very very nice people. I remember my 21st very fondly and was very happy I decided to go there to celebrate it. I went again for the first time in a while (was out of the country for a couple of years) a few nights ago with my mom who is *very* nitpicky about restaurants. I was a little nervous she wouldn't like it... The waitress we had was adorable. She sat down at our booth (which was huge for only three people) and took our orders which I thought was cute. It showed she was comfortable with us which, in turn, made ordering fun. My mom ordered the Maui Glazed Pork Chop with a side salad and coffee... I, the Parmesan Crusted Chicken. When mom's salad came she took a bite and instantly loved it (This is only the salad, folks. The salad.). ""Oh, this salad is DELICIOUS. Niki, here, you gotta try this salad. It's so crunchy and the sauce is wonderful! I need to make sauce like this. Here, try it! Just taste the salad!""  Yay, the salad gets an A+ from my mom.  Also, the coffee was the best coffee she's ever had at a restaurant. It had to have been freshly brewed because I tried it as well and it was ... so ... GOOD.  Coffee gets an A+ The main course arrived and, surprise, my mom was gushing over each bite. ""Oh. MMMM. This is so good. Try this. Let me get a piece of that chicken. OH. Yummy."" Main course A+ And how could we forget the Pizookie? My ten year-old sisters absolute favorite dessert on this planet. It's literally a huge, fresh-baked cookie topped with ice cream. My mind was blown when I realized it's a combination of the word ""pizza"" and ""cookie"". I'm slow, ok? We had the original (chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream) and devoured it all in under 5 minutes, probably.  Dessert gets an A+ BJ's gets an A+"
Kat T.,"Vallejo, CA",28,21,3,3.0,4/29/2012,"I've only been to BJ's a handful of times and this was my first time to the Concord location. I am ALWAYS overwhelmed by there menu and have learned to stick with the pizza which has ALWAYS been delicious.  We walk in on a Saturday night and the hostess is on her cell phone. She takes my name but doesn't write it down, and motions for me to stand away from the hostess station. She motions to another employee while she's still on her cell and another employee takes our name and seats us.  The staff is just ""ok"". They don't seem to genuinely enjoy there job which isn't really my problem. It just sucks when you want to go out and enjoy dinner and you don't feel welcome. Maybe it was just our waitress??? But wait... There was a point when 2 of the bus boys were arguing while clearing the table behind us and it lasted more than an awkward look between my dinner guests and I.  BJ's is great because they have a diverse menu and there hours are flexible. I would definitely go there again with friends. I was probably the victim of being someones last table = )"
Hayley S.,"Walnut Creek, CA",16,9,2,2.0,5/24/2013,"I went to BJ's last week. Â I got at least once a month or every other month. Â  - It was busy, but the waitress didn't know what anything was, and kept asking us if that was even on the menu. Â  -The runners kept trying to give us other people's food. -The food was meh -my friend got food poisoning from the shrimp scampi -the waitress never refilled our drinks. Â It wasn't until my friend asked her as she was running by, if she could have a refill. Â Even then, it took 20 minutes to get to us -The waitress didn't ask if we wanted dessert."
Emily J.,"Concord, CA",379,1293,166,4.0,11/8/2009,"I started with their basic beer sampler - blonde, pale ale, red and porter. Â I have had their beer at other locations and already knew that it was good and the sampler definitely didn't disappoint.  They have an extensive menu. Â Burger? Pizza? Salad? Sandwich? Â Too many choices that all sound delicious. I highly recommend checking out their menu online before you visit. I ended up ordering the California Grilled Chicken Sandwich. Â This sandwich consists of a thin grilled chicken breast served on toasted, cheesy, sourdough bread and topped with avocado, green chilies, pepperjack cheese and chipotle mayonnaise. Â It was very tasty although the chicken was a bit too salty, at least for my taste buds. The fries are crispy and addictive. (Don't say I didn't warn you.) Â  As is required for all large chains, the nutritional information is made available. Â This information is conveniently located in the back of the menu so you can make an educated, good (or bad) decision. Â   The service was friendly and there were plenty of staff readily available.  I'm glad that BJs has finally arrived close to home. Â I will be back."
Jim K.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,4,,2.0,10/27/2014,Sunday 10/26/14 approx. 2:00pm Food eaten Bison Burger & Wedge Fries 1. Location was very clean. 2. Wait time was satisfactory. 3. Service was Excellent 4. Â Presentation of food and fries was good.  5. Bison burger center was raw returned it and the 2nd one was mostly cooked but a small portion was still raw. 10/27/14 Complained to management and they stated they would review problem with cooks managers.  Considering the problems we have in this country with under cooked food I was surprised that this could happen twice in a row. I think this is either a cook not using proper cooking time or possible cold spot on the grill in either case I hope they take care of the problem. I doubt if I will return to them to find out if they resolve the problem as their is a lot of other fine restaurants in the area.
Trung N.,"San Jose, CA",715,409,54,4.0,7/12/2010,"Silly friends that burst out laughing when one of them asked, ""Who doesn't like BJ's?"" Always a great time with them, and with a crazy group like that, there isn't anywhere else better than to spend a nice dinner at a restaurant/brewery such as BJ's. Good food, good beer, and my personal favorite in the non-alcoholic category: the root beer. Lovely waitress named Natalie will take care of you if you're lucky enough to get her. Wonderful time."
Greg A.,"Concord, CA",1,20,36,1.0,12/20/2013,"Food was great however Waitress was so bad everything came out at different times nothing was comped, then she Handed us the bill before we were done! BAD Service waitress name is Stacy if you get her ask to sit in another section"
Bryan P.,"San Pablo, CA",190,7,1,1.0,6/15/2015,"My friends and I came on a Friday night to have some drinks . Our waitress was not personable whatsoever. Once one of my friends ordered an old fashioned she obviously had to ask for an I.D and we complied. Keep in mind that my friend is not from this country and we wanted to take him out for a good night out but does have a drivers license displaying his name, photo, DOB, and exp date. The waitress was extremely rude when she had a hard time reading something that she wasn't used to. She gave us attitude and made stupid remarks such as "" if only I could read this"" while rolling her eyes. Manager came and asked to see the I.D and once again we complied. He said he has never seen an I.D like this. I explained he was from Â another country and he asked if he had anything from this country. Are you kidding me!?!? We left and went to Lucile's which gave us no problems. Next time learn how to treat others that aren't from this country with respect and if there is a problem address it in a manner that is respectful but straight to the point."
