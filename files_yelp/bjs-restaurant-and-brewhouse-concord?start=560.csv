Mae M.,"Auburn, CA",192,282,22,3.0,6/30/2012,If you have a big group of four or more get reservations because the wait time is forever. But the wait is worth it! From their food to their drinks and their staff this place is wonderful :) Lunch time is hectic but their lunch menu is soooo good. Slider burgers are superb and desserts are very filling :)
Eileen H.,"Concord, CA",344,329,94,3.0,9/29/2011,"I'm afraid I'm going to have to downgrade BJ's based on their pizza.  I realize that they're not claiming to have Chicago-style pizza, but when I hear 'deep dish pizza', of course I'm going to hold it to a particular standard (being from Chicago, and all).  BJ's deep dish pizza was not good.  It was super salty, and the crust was pretty much on par with pizza hut.  It was not buttery and flaky like good deep dish crust is supposed to be.   Their fish tacos were so-so.  Not the best, but passable.  My peach margarita tasted neither like a peach OR a margarita.  Tasted like a ton of sweet and sour mix with some tequila in it.  Boooo. Service was still good and they have such a gigantic menu with items I'm sure I'd like that I'm not boycotting BJ's.  I'm just not going to order their pizza (or the peach margarita) again."
Keith G.,"Bedford, NH",2,22,,5.0,11/6/2012,"Had an early dinner with wife & 11 month old daughter. Steak & fries were delicious, almost too good. We'll definitely be going back. Dessert was quite yummy, they call it a Zookie (freshly baked cookie in a small pan with a scoop of ice cream, way good. The service was prompt, the server was very attentive and atmosphere quite pleasant. Overall a great time. Only concern was the high chair buckle didn't work anymore so we had to tie it in a knot and keep an eye on our baby."
Camy C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",32,19,,1.0,9/30/2014,Had lunch here with friends today and the atmosphere is nice. Sat down and ordered the bbq chicken salad and asked for no beans or corn and dressing on the side. The salad had beans so the waiter brought it back. It took a long time for a salad. Finally the salad came and the plate was dirty with other food smeared on it!!!!!!! The salad did not look fresh either it looked life someone's leftovers.  So disgusting! We will not be returning!!!!!
Casey J.,"San Ramon, CA",9,5,,1.0,6/6/2014,"Worst restaurant ever with the rudest servers ever!! Guess that's what happens when you have little to no standards when hiring your servers. We sat in the bar area and the place was dead. We ordered 2 drinks and an appetizer. Our server left our food and drinks on the counter for 10 minutes. We had to ask another server to go get her then asked her if that was our food sitting there. She simply replied ""oh yea sorry"" and finally grabbed them. Our drinks were warm and our food was cold. This is the most recent out of many bad experiences with this place. The food isn't good enough to say it was worth the frustration. I will never spend another penny here."
Arna S.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",0,4,1,5.0,9/30/2015,"Great menu with pictures! Waiters are polite and help with orders! I visited this place several times, because it's really tasty! My favorite delicious is pizzuki! It's cool place for events too. I really recommend it to everyone:)"
Leanne V.,"Martinez, CA",81,23,2,3.0,4/22/2014,Nice convenient place to eat while shopping at sun valley mall. Large selection of food and appetizers. Spacious bar full bar with good happy hour.
Jon F.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",382,36,1,4.0,8/26/2013,"This place has really good food, beer and atmosphere.  There are tv screens hoisted up along every wall of this place.  If you are a sports fan, this is a good place to watch a lot of sports (and eat and drink).  Solid 4 stars."
John G.,"San Jose, CA",0,7,,5.0,9/21/2014,Always consistent food quality and taste. We love going there for the upbeat atmosphere and very reasonable prices. We like that new items are added to the menu with creative combination of fresh ingredients. Our favorite dessert is the Baked Beignet. Here's too many good meals in the past and many more for the future!
Mikaella P.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,4,,2.0,8/1/2014,"Ordered buffalo boneless wings and the celery sticks tasted like rubber.. The shrimp scampi was a tad too lemony for me. I'm disappointed for my first time here, but maybe I just didn't choose wisely."
EM.cas C.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",0,10,9,1.0,6/16/2014,"I was there yesterday for father's day it was the worst yet we got sat and nobody said anything to us so we waited for 20 min and we got out ....this is not the first time the service is the worst please don't go to this place, there's better restaurants ...."
Sadie B.,"Fairfield, CA",123,24,1,4.0,3/20/2012,"Overall BJ's is my favorite. I am a WING connoisseur! They have the BEST traditional buffalo wings ever.... better than any where I've ever been. and I've tried almost every wing spot you can find.  I've tried much of the menu and it's all pretty good food, esp for a chain type Restaurant. Drinks are pretty good and service has always been top notch. But I could do without the ""My Pleasure"" every time I ask for something... I know the servers are probably made to say this .. but seriously.. it gets to be a little weird after the 2nd or 3rd time you hear it in a 30 minute sitting. LOL  The only thing I have had trouble with is Togo, every time (10+ visits) they have gotten my order wrong, even when i ask them to double check... check it before you leave  :)"
Pushka G.,"Brentwood, CA",12,288,10,3.0,5/6/2012,"Clam chowder in a bread bowl.chicken tortilla soup, and calamari. The calamari was excellent. The bread bowl on the clam chowder was not typical in that it was baked and soup added. The Tortilla soup is interesting I suppose. You get the bowl,and the soup is poured into it seperately? Strange but not super hot because it cooled off so much being in a seperate little pitcher.  Crowded for lunch....yet comfortable. Service was fair."
Chanelle N.,"Pittsburg, CA",619,185,502,4.0,4/18/2012,"This is the best restaurant at Sun Valley Mall which is located on the border of Concord and Pleasant Hill.  The menu is voluptuous, similar to the Cheesecake Factory. The food is quite good and high in calorie content ;) There are so many pluses to coming here. It's family friendly, there's a full bar, tons of TVs for sports, a patio (that can be covered and heated), and convenience of being at the mall, right off the freeway. I would love this place if the staff were a little bit more friendly and accommodating. They do not accommodate large groups well. If you and your work peeps are planning a night of happy hour after work, this is not the place. They don't let you add extra chairs to your table for stragglers. I understand why, it's just frustrating. They are always busy, I get it. They do have a good happy hour menu but don't come with more than 6 people."
Jennifer C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",24,137,14,2.0,3/15/2014,"Two stars for handcrafted soda. Everything else... meh. I've been there three times and they can never get my pizza right. The service can also be slow at times. As much as I love the free refills on handcrafted soda but without good food to go with it, what's the point of going to BJ's?"
Caro S.,"East Bay, CA",354,621,571,4.0,10/25/2009,I came on opening day 10/19/09! Loved this place when I lived in Sac and loves it now that it's in my hood. Because this place is new I cut some slack on the delay in service. We had to wait about 40 minutes to get seated. I hope that this rush will die down after the newness factor goes away. Not to mention you can call ahead for a reservation.  All o the food is great deep dish pizza and good brew! the crust on that pizza is like a heaven sent pillow of plush. The salads are yummy salads and plenty of sports to be watched. I love the wedge salad.  LEAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT! You must try the pizzockie. Yes! Deep dish cookie with ice cream on top AMAZING!
Johanna P.,"Hayward, CA",9,14,33,1.0,2/7/2012,"Ughhhh if it was possible to give it no stars I would.  I went to this place a few days ago with my friend and had a bad experience.  Customer service: Terrible. We got there and was busy, I asked how long the wait was and the guy said 5-10 minutes. Wait for 25 minutes and my name wasn't called. So I go and asked, they gave my table to someone else. Really? I'm standing right in front of you plus I doubt there was another Johanna and my name was never called. Waited another 20 minutes finally get a table. Figured things happen and tried to stay positive. Waitress comes and everything we ordered she kept looking at us like we were ordering shit that wasn't on da menu. =\...... Table was dirty, had to ask for it to be cleaned. Food: Disgusting. I ordered their Jambalaya, YUCK. A frozen dinner tastes better than that. I literally had to add almost half of bottle of hot sauce they gave us. My friend ordered a deep dish pizza. Elementary school pizza tastes better than that. Ugh We also ordered a chocolatini tasted like Phillips medicine with chocolate. Irish Root beer float was actually good. Beer: it was ok. I much rather go to 21st amendment in San Francisco. Great service ,beer and food.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY/ TIME HERE!!!!!"
Kristen G.,"Walnut Creek, CA",1,8,,5.0,1/3/2014,"I've been coming here for a few years with family or friends. The dining room is just ok service wise, but the bar is absolutely amazing! Jessie always makes us something good to drink and has made sure food gets there quickly! My best advice is to check them out on late happy hour and enjoy discounts with great service."
Darryl L.,"Port Costa, CA",85,33,59,4.0,4/6/2014,"Friday night Happy Hour is decent. The menu of both craft beers and food is vast. And the prices are decent. Noise level is kept to a minimum even at capacity by cavernous dining area. Now for the staff. There seemed to be plenty of them, and they were pleasant enough but seemed ""inattentive"" or ""rushed"". We placed our initial drink and appetizer order. Our drinks arrived and we gave her our entree order. Our entrees arrived almost immediately after we started our brews and then they delivered the appetizers about 5 minutes later.  WOW, slow down everyone. It's ""HAPPY HOUR"" not ""SPEED DATING"" we're here for. What made us giggle even more was that none of the many staff members that approached us notice or said anything about our ""untouched"" appetizers.  We ate and took the appetizers home in containers for later (which I must admit were good), but ""ill timed"". Staff was pleasant, but just going through the motions to turn tables. Not the pace that ""Happy Hour"" bar floor should be ran at so this is more a floor manager issue.  Be nice to the staff...they deliver your brews and food. Will we return? The selection/price of the brews and people watching crowd draws me more than anything else. We might try the BBQ joint next door first though...hmmm."
Jason R.,"Concord, CA",63,33,3,2.0,4/25/2014,"Service is very slow. Part of our order was forgotten. The food was too salty. I finally rated the place after this has happened more than one visit. Overall, the service definitely needs improvement. Pricing is fair for this size chain restaurant. On a positive note, recommend their beer samplers since it is a good size serving for an individual."
