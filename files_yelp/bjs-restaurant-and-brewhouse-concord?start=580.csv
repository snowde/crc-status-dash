Susan K.,"Livermore, CA",0,2,,1.0,1/4/2014,"Can no longer find my review on here, so thought I would re-rate. Don't bother eating here, the service is truly horrible, and they don't care at all.  Took about two hours for them to serve lunch to my party of three people (cold sandwiches and french fries). Others arrived later than we did and were served more quickly.  Complained to the manager the next day, who promised to look into the situation plus send us gift cards.  The gift cards never arrived, and when I emailed to complain about it (I wanted their corporate office to be aware), I never received a response.  THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKS AND I WILL NEVER GO HERE AGAIN!!!!"
Jill N.,"Antioch, CA",54,50,30,5.0,8/16/2011,"Happy Hour 3-7, M-F Specials: Drinks $1 off, Tues~Wine 1/2 price! Appetizers: $2 off Small Pizzas, Half Price I love the ambiance and attentive service in the bar here. The crowds tend to be in the 30+ age range which translates to mellow & comfortable. There is plenty of seating at the bar with a view of 4 TV screens above one of the longest rows of beer taps I have ever seen.  Other bar seating consists of tall tables that seat  up to 6 people as well as several booths that seat up to 4. Everything is black granite...much nicer than my kitchen at home, to be sure.  Appetizer stand outs~Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps & California Club Flat Bread Pizzas.  (My hard to impress boyfriend  was  even a fan!) On my most recent happy hour excursion here, my friend and I happened to hit it on a Tuesday afternoon. Tuesday is, as our awesome server Becca informed us,  half price wine night!  I think it has a catchy name like ""Wine -down Tuesday"".  We shared a decent bottle of Pinot Grigio,  two pizzas, and chicken tacos.  (The chicken tacos were on the snacks & small bites menu & always happen to be a bargain at under $4 even during non-happy hours.)  Total bill? $30. Thank you very much. This may become a regular Tuesday night thing for me! I'm fully prepared to try the Crispy, Fried Artichokes, Seared Ahi, & Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms and maybe even some more wine. Who am I kidding here?  Of course, there will be wine!"
Cindy T.,"Antioch, CA",0,10,7,5.0,2/22/2012,"So you have made it to BJ""S, from the moment you walk in the entrance and survey the scene you know that there are good times to be had!  There is electricity in the air the crowd is buzzing with a mix of young and old and is also family friendly.  People sitting at the bar drinking , laughing, talking just unwinding after a day of work, or that mother with her kids that just did not feel like cooking today.  Whew feels good!  I was with 6 friends all hungry and grateful to be able to relax and just enjoy good food as well as good friends.  I ordered the vegetarian pizza, delicious,  even meat eaters would have enjoyed this one, didn't miss the meat not one bit.  Couple of my fellow diners ordered the ribs, they had no complaints and raved about how good the ribs were.  Our waiter was courteous and gave good service while anticipating our needs.  So if you are looking for good food  with reasonable pricing, you can't go wrong here.  have been back since this meal and it will be one of my favorite spots.  As I said on my next trip  I lost my keys in the restaurant  They were missing for about an hour.  Turns out, I threw them away in the trash with my paper towel.  The staff diligently searched for them, one young lady tackled the job of ""trash"" diving, she found my keys, yeah!  Can not remember her name, may have been Stephanie, anyway my dear here is your proper THANK YOU....THAT'S WHAT I CALL SERVICE.......  This one is a big thumbs up!   Cindy T.  Antioch, Ca   the  FOODIVA :D"
Ben S.,"Martinez, CA",35,10,,1.0,5/22/2015,Table and menu are Sticking and GROSS. My glass of lemonade has been Empty for 15 minutes while waitress walked by a dozen times.  Used to love this place but it's gone down hill. Friday night at 5pm and place is 3/4 empty. That should have been my warning.  Won't Be Coming Back
Jazmin R.,"Pittsburg, CA",12,51,11,1.0,3/30/2014,"The staff COMPLETELY forgot about our table. We had 3 different waiters and the first two forgot we existed. The first half of our services were fine, totally normal service.  But then we asked for 2 deserts which were added to our bill but we received them 40 minutes after having ordered them, and AFTER we got our check and told the waiter that we just wanted to cancel them since we had ordered them so long ago & were already picking up our things to leave.  The food was ok, nothing special.  Definitely not going back."
Daniel C.,"Honolulu, HI",627,552,1137,4.0,2/23/2012,The deep dish pizza here is very good! It's very spacious and comfortable. The menu is vast and has a healthy eating section which is awesome. They are open late night which is a plus because nothing is really open late in East Bay. Late night special here is very reasonable if you're craving a late night snack.
Bri B.,"Concord, CA",29,68,93,2.0,2/17/2014,Every time I've gone here (which is a good amount) the service is horrible. I understand that the restaurant gets busy but waiting for an hour for the food to get done or waiting 30 minutes to even be asked what I'd like to drink is ridiculous. Other locations have been better.
Dmitry O.,"Oakland, CA",22,252,271,4.0,3/1/2014,"me and my wife had salmon medeatrian and chicken parmesan, both were very good and delicious. salmon was just 3 skinny small pieces, well prepared, and served with some sort of rice that i didnt really like, but i ate mashed potatoes from my wifes plate....., so next time NO to that rice and substitute with potatoes!!!!! my wife's plate was good and delicious as well!!!! regarding drinks, unfortunately they serve pepsi product,and only strawberry lemonade....."
Nick J.,"San Francisco, CA",48,128,123,4.0,3/17/2012,"BJ's is just an all around great restaurant that has something for everyone and really does well...except the service.  They're improving little by little; definitely bringing on better, new staff.  I was pretty stoked to see this open after enjoying one for years in Roseville.  Great appetizers, awesome brews, and nearly every main dish is delicious.  I gotta hand it to 'em on one in particular: Angel Hair Toscana.  I don't want to offend any ma and pa genuine Italian spots but this may be the best pasta plate out there.  It's simple but perfectly balanced with each ingredients flavor.  And, of course, the pizookies.  Indulge.  Just indulge. Check in early on the weekends.  The wait is horrible and the quotes...well, once again, staffing is their missing fifth star in my review.  It's pretty bad.  If you can get passed that, you're in for some good eats.   Recommendations: avocado rolls, California chicken sandwich, BBQ chicken deep dish pizza (but all of 'em rock), seared ahi salad, jambalaya, the aforementioned Toscana, the pizookie of your liking, and any of their craft beers."
C J.,"Vallejo, CA",0,10,,3.0,6/14/2015,"I ordered online for extra aoli for my clamari, did not get it even though I can read it on my receipt. Don't ask if you aren't going to do it:"
C R.,"Pittsburg, CA",0,99,,3.0,2/12/2013,Not bad of a place. Nice that they are open past midnight too (bar). Get their before their happy hours or you'll be waiting to get seat. I like their tomato bisque and fried artichoke hearts.
Isa W.,"Vallejo, CA",186,253,1450,4.0,3/29/2012,"i LOVE BJ's   everything on their menu is pretty good. the appetizer wings are soooo delicious too!  this was my first time at this location, the waiter skills lack. It took so long for the girl to just get me water... it would be different if they had to make it or do something special."
Michele W.,"Martinez, CA",4,32,2,2.0,6/28/2013,"Won't be returning to BJ's anytime soon... they kinda suck.  Only eaten here about 6 or 7 times in the several years they've been here- but the experience is usually about the same. I just finally asked myself, ""Why do you keep coming back?!""  I guess because it's a big enough place and noisy enough, that the kids like it... but it is just a tough place to bring kids- because of the LONG WAIT!  Always a long wait, for everything! We usually try to go in off peak times, so we dont wait more than 15 mins for a seat... so that's fine. But it takes forever to get a menu, place your order, even LONGER for the food to come, and forever to get your check and get out. Seriously people-- what is wrong with you guys?!  We went in (myself, a girlfriend and our kids-- 6 of us in total) and our food took about 30-40 mins to come out. And we didn't even order that crazy of stuff. Just some appetizers and 4 kids meals (which the kids meals were horrible!) All in all, just a bummer. The table next to us sat piled high with dirty dishes the entire time we were there (about 90 minutes!) and I saw tons of staff just standing around. The table behind us asked for silverware 2 or 3 times before they finally brought it-- all the while their food sitting there in front of them getting cold. Even when I asked, 'when is our food coming- the kids are getting restless'... our waitress said, ""should be soon- you know, they can go run around out on the patio"" and pointed to their outdoor dining area. Yeah- like I'm gonna let my kids go run around and bother the diners out there --even if there were only a few? Plus, my little one is LITTLE... I cant just send her off to run and play.  That wasn't the point-- the point was - what's taking so long to make a salad and reheat some gross mac n' cheese?! It really was gross, all clumped together and oily.  I'm done. While I feel the food is OK (pretty much just ok)... there are so many better places I'd rather support that care about the customer.  Bye BJ's."
Dylan S.,"Berkeley, CA",0,42,,2.0,10/13/2011,"BJ's has some of the most bland food in the world, although the ambiance and drinks make up for some of it, service can be spotty but most of the help is 18-20 so it makes sense. Not my favorite place but i end up goin here once or twice a year"
Cynthia d.,"San Mateo, CA",56,21,8,1.0,3/4/2014,To the rude and unfriendly waitress who helped us on Friday... Altering/changing the gratuity on customers credit card transaction is a big No No!!
Maria C.,"Sunnyvale, CA",3,5,2,1.0,11/5/2013,"First time at this restaurant and was very disappointed! Went here around 3:30 for late pre-bday lunch on 11/3/13, we got seated right away since  it's not even busy. It's a party of seven, two are toddlers, we ordered appetizer which took 35 minutes, we got our soup and salad first before that.  The entree took 50 minutes to get to our table! Plates was hot but the food, side dishes and sauces are less than warm already and some are even cold to touch. My veggies are dry too since it's probably been in the food warmer too long and got dehydrated! Steak ordered was medium well and came out dry and warm not hot. We called the manager to complain about how long the food took before we got it and that it's luke warm and not acceptable. They convinced us to redo our order and will try to get it to us fresh. The steak came out more rare than medium well the next time around, we've been at this restaurant for two hours now and i convinced my brother not to complain anymore since it's been horrible already and we just want to leave!  The manager did give us complementary gift card to use for next time which will not happen since the food was terrible and not worth coming back for! I love discovering new places to eat and this is the first time something like this happened to me that it's worth taking my time to write a review!"
I. A.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",254,30,10,4.0,4/21/2014,What's there not to love about BJ's..??? Good food. Good ambiance. Good music. Can be crowded though.
Patrick Z.,"Concord, CA",114,319,34,3.0,2/7/2012,"Took my sweet wife here for a welcome home dinner. Neither of us had been here before. We were seated almost immediately. All the food dished on the menu looked great. My wife got the Kung Pow Chicken and I got the Pork Chops with Tortilla Soup.  The Tortilla Soup presentation was good and it tasted great. My pork chops were juicy and delicious. I got a taste of the Kung Pow Chicken. Wow! I was jealous. The chicken was tender, juicy, and spicy.  At the end of the meal the waiter recommended a cookie desert that came in a mini deep dish pizza pan with ice cream. We took his recommendation without regrets. This place was good. We'll be back to try some other menu items that caught our attention."
Jane S.,"Pittsburg, CA",0,2,,1.0,10/24/2013,"Horrible service!! I'm being very generous with this one star. It took 2 hours for them to serve 4 people. My table watched people be seated after us and leave before us. Our cups were constantly empty and when the food came out, the burgers were burnt, the breadsticks were hard as cement and the salad was just plain disgusting. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."
Ms. V R.,"San Leandro, CA",0,3,,1.0,4/10/2016,"4/9/2016 ~ HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!.  Party of 45 came to this restaurant to enjoy a night of family and friends.  We were seated on the enclosed patio outside.  First there were not enough waiters/waitresses for our party.  Secondly, they were taking two to three orders at a time, and it took them no less than 50 minutes to fulfill the orders.  Thirdly, after bringing all the appetizers, sodas, water etc., they never removed any of the EMPTY DIRTY dishes from the table.  I had to remind the waitress twice of my order (two fish tacos & fries) which took almost an hour!  I never received my water or my soda.  When I could no longer tolerate the DIRTY DISHES on the table, I asked to speak to the manager.  When he finally came, I shared my concerns with him; I stated we had a huge party of at least 45 guest, the DIRTY DISHES were not being removed from the table, it was taking over 45 min to receive our food, our drinks etc. and that was unacceptable to  me.  The first thing the Senior Manager ~ David Henderson stated ""was unacceptable that you guys are out here smoking marijuana.""  WHAT!!!!!!!!! Excuse me ~ no one is smoking marijuana.  David said he could smell it.  What!!!!! First of all, no one is smoking marijuana and what has that got to do with my complaint regarding the poor customer service given by BJ's???  He was insulting and unprofessional.  I demanded an apology, It took three demands before David apologized!  That was the last time I will patronize BJ's Concord!"
