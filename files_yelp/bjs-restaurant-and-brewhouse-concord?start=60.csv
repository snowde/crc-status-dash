We were sat at 8:02 Started out with a sweet waitress then after ordering letting her know about a coupon we had (6 of us total) she brought out 5 drinks and then said o I knew I forgot one...then we order our appetizers which is what we had a coupon for she again brought us 5 plates we ordered our food before the apps came at this point we find out she is going to break....so Jimmy P takes over...we had to constantly ask for refills. My husband ordered the new SPECIAL prime rib it came with a salad the salad came and then 45 mins Jimmy walked by in which we asked where our food was and he straight up said ""o I don't know..."" We asked for him to check...out comes 3 plates of food and a pizza for 2 to split NO PLATES OR PIZZA STAND...again we are missing our 6th person stuff and my husband's prime rib looked as if it sat for 3 hours under the hot lamp...he said he would reorder it also pizza was dry and cold so but kids were hungry so we just had them eat it...asked for mgr jimmy said he was on the phone...out comes a Caesar salad no one ordered and we ask for 6th person plate....it finally comes 10 mins later...prime rib another 20 mins later its HALF THE SIZE OF THE FIRST ONE!!! Manager finally shows up...O and did I mention its hubs birthday...we show him the 2 prime ribs and tell him about the pizza he says o well i'll take care of those for you....yeah duhhh I'm not paying for that crap!

Ohhh and all the while jimmy has no idea what we are drinking so every time we ask for refills we have to tell him...then we ask where our waitress is....break was over 45 mins ago...you ready for this...

Cait H.,"San Lorenzo, CA",53,36,8,3.0,8/21/2017,"There were definitely goods and bads. I'll start with what was good. The pazooki was to die for. The shrimp in the pasta was amazing but the sauce was a little rich.  We ordered delivery and it took forever. When the food came, I was surprised at how little there was. We order in a lot and usually get a lot of food for way less price. This was expensive and not worth the $7 delivery charge. It's worth the price in store, but unless you're getting a lot of food, $7 delivery is high."
Lena M.,"Hercules, CA",76,152,451,4.0,12/2/2016,"They have so many options in regards to food and drinks. So many faves. I love their pizzas, pizookies and beer. It can get pricey so if you are on a budget, take advantage of their happy hour. I haven't been disappointed with any of their food items. They offer sampler appetizers, beer and pizookie which is great if you are indecisive. They have many screens for watching sports and a large bar area. The bar area is open seating but where they serve happy hour. Location is great. Right next to the mall and round 1. Kid friendly which is a bonus. Parking can be difficult depending on the day/holiday. Staff was supper friendly although service gets a dip on busy days. Overall, I recommend this place for great eats and drinks."
Christi Y.,"Concord, CA",0,5,,2.0,12/18/2017,"I took my mother out for a belated birthday dinner (We also had my 3 yo with us). The hostess was kind and the waitress was alright. She did come back and fill our water for us. However, I did feel somewhat annoyed because I waited for quite some time to get extra lemon for my salmon. Also, the manager EVENTUALLY came to talk to us. While he was at the table, I mentioned a second time that I wondered if they could please turn the football back on one of the screens for me. It never happened. EVERY screen in there had basketball on it. By the time the bill came, we were not asked if we would like to order dessert and we were waiting to pay and get out of there. I would have ordered dessert if they had come back sooner. Maybe I was just in a sour mood. I don't know, but I was not very happy when I left the restaurant."
Samantha Y.,"San Francisco, CA",4,65,11,1.0,6/20/2017,We should have just gone to cheesecake!  Yes it's hot yes you were busy but dang it my salad should not have taken an hour and when it came out it was lifeless! I eat a lot of salad and I kno when my salad has been sitting out for hella long!  Everything was sour! The dressing was hella sour.....They super over dressed my salad and my lettuce was seriously dead like mush and gross and stuck together! I can tell when salad has been let out sitting to long with dressing and from the looks of it...it sat out at least 30 min before It came to my table. I was hungry and pissed and when I told my waitress she totally brushed it off and told me it was suppose to look like that!  First of all no! Salad is not suppose to look like dog food second of all you should try to fix it and not give me attitude....such a waste of money!  Next time I'm sticking to cheese cake factory!
Juan G.,"Richmond, CA",0,1,,5.0,10/25/2017,"I want to start of by saying, the atmosphere as you walk into the restaurant Is so pleasant and full of energy that put me in a great mood i would like to thank starting for the hostess for being so friendly and giving us a seat right away. Our server was outstanding he didn't took long to take our order food came out fast. And he would always check up on us to make sure everything was good.and are drinks  were always full. The manager Douglas was awesomee it was like having a second waiter he was on itt!!! And we will definitely recommend this restaurant to friends and family...  Thank you to all the stafff"
Victor Sbm O.,"Pinole, CA",120,1,,5.0,10/25/2017,"Walked in on a Wensday afternoon, the place seemed busy but my waiter Chris did an extraordinary job! I recommend asking for Chris! Very attentive, my water glass was never empty! The Manager Douglas also checked up on us and asked us how we were doing! He's the type of manager that you want and the type that great restaurants need, Amazing guy! Great job Chris and Douglas, definitely coming back!"
Gabrielle D.,"Pittsburg, CA",39,24,20,4.0,9/28/2017,"Most favorite dish here- the jambalaya. Seriously I just love Cajun! It's really spicy though so I'd recommend asking the server for mild. Service is fast in the bar area however anywhere else can take  almost forever. I'd never expect fast service though, because trust me, you won't find it here. Anyways, I love their burgers and fries as well. Pizookies and ice cream doughnuts are a must have."
Laney M.,"Alameda, CA",1,10,1,4.0,7/31/2017,"Went here on a date last night.   It was a Sunday night, the wait for the two of us was approximately 13 minutes.  It was bustling with activity, but still comfortable and fun.  Lots of groups, families, and couples on dates, and they all seemed to be enjoying themselves.  Our waitress was adorable, fast, and attentive, and laughed when we prodded her with our silly jokes, so she definitely had a good sense of humor.   We started off with the basic appetizer sampler platter.  After trying all of the options offered, I will definitely be getting either the Avocado Egg Rolls (fantastic dip), or the Spinach & Artichoke Dip w Tortilla Chips next time.  Mozzerella sticks were good enough to get an honorable appetizer mention.  The boneless wings were fairly bland, and not very original (kind of reminded me of the grocery store microwavable variety), so I don't recommend those.    As for my date, he ordered the Chicken Fried Steak Burger.  His side choice was fries, and they give you a variety of options in the preparation - everything from an egg, to cheese, bacon, or even avocado / tomato.  I had a couple bites and thought it was fantastic, but he only made it halfway through the burger before filling up.  It really is A LOT of food, especially if you order the sampler first.     For myself, I ordered the House Top Sirloin, with sides of mashed potatoes, and the Mozzarella and Tomato Salad.  Really cool artistic presentation of Fresh mozzarella and tomato wedges, came on a separate plate.  The side salad could have very easily been its own meal if I had ordered it as a lunch by itself, very tasty because it was covered in basil, red onion, and Parmesan cheese drizzled with balsamic glaze that I wish I could get a bottle of at home to put on everything!    I ordered my Steak medium-rare, and they did it a little closer to medium, but it was still delicious and well seasoned enough that I did not need to order any sauces.    We had planned to get dessert, but we only made it halfway through our meals before we were full past our limits.  We got most of our food boxed up to take home, so there was definitely no room for that dessert!  I think this is a fantastic place to take a date, but if you have a large family and want to get stuffed to the gills with comfort food, this is probably the perfect place for you!"
Justin T.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",63,2,12,3.0,7/19/2017,"I'm going to start off by saying Jeanne G. is literally insane and should probably use Yelp to find some help with that anger. I had Jimmy as a server the other night, which I found he was very attentive and proactive - like asking for refills. Out of all the typically not so great experiences at these restaurants, Jimmy stood out as an outstanding server and made sure to go give us the best BJ's experience we've ever had.  For the food, it's pretty eh. The spin-dip is a must though, but I just mainly go for the beer. Restaurant itself is decent too- shmedium noise level, somewhat dim lighting, uuge bar area with TV's, etc."
Mary R.,"Martinez, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/14/2017,"Went here with my mom after some shopping and were seated pretty quickly after being told there was a wait. However I guess what they failed to mention is that the wait would be after we were seated. Once we were seated, we were promptly ignored. After 10 minutes, we decided it was enough and got and left.To make it all the better,  there was a group of employees hanging out at the hostess stand chatting it up.  One time I can understand, however this was the second time this happened to us.  I may go here again since it is one of the better places to eat at the mall, but they seriously need to get their act together."
Michelle V.,"Oakland, CA",8,156,4,4.0,3/26/2017,"Surprisingly easy to get a well balanced vegan meal here, and the service was very friendly. I ordered vegan lentil soup, a salad with mushrooms and pepitas (sans cheese), and a side of fries. It was all tasty.  Definitely a good choice if you find yourself hungry at the mall."
Deshaunna P.,"Rio Vista, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/25/2017,After being seated no one came to ask if we wanted water no waiter are waitress came over sat there 10 minutes and they were not crowed
Melanie A.,"Vallejo, CA",109,7,5,4.0,8/18/2017,"Cat was our waitress and she was great. Very attentive and enthusiastic. The wait for our food was a little long but our waters stayed full and our appetizer kept us happy. The pizza ended up coming out cold but one of their managers, Douglas, kindly took care of it for us and we appreciate the customer service."
Jess P.,"Oakland, CA",0,55,1,3.0,3/11/2017,Healthy food options as compared to other chain restaurants.  I like that they always have a cider available and it isn't Angry Orchard. But it's usually something that's still too sweet. Great beer selection.  Main problem is that it's always WAY too crowded. Some of the food items obviously came out of a freezer bag and were reheated.
Michael M.,"Pittsburg, CA",73,2,,5.0,10/15/2017,"shout out to katie y'all better give my homegirl a raise this is what mlk died for, a black man praising a white woman"
Scarlet R.,"Daly City, CA",52,24,6,2.0,5/28/2017,"I went here last week with my fiancé to watch half of the Warriors game. It wasn't that busy because it hasn't started yet, and we saw a table at the bar and sat down. After 20 minutes we were never approached and a few employees already made eye contact. Even if the servers had a different section, someone could have told us ""someone would be right with you."" I was a server too, I get it, but for that long to not even have menus on our table is not acceptable.  I decided to get up and tell someone if we could at least have a menu. Hailey was so kind enough to apologize and help us right away. At the end of our meal she even talked to her manager about the whole situation and took off our appetizer on our tab. She handled it very professionally and five stars go to great service because of Hailey, but I only put two because of the disappointment of the restaurant. BJs can use some help cus this isn't the first time it has happened to us."
Amy S.,"Concord, CA",881,1788,13506,4.0,2/10/2017,"I used to enjoy going to BJ's in Southern CA with my sister when we were in college. I stop in at this Concord location from time to time but it's not nearly the same trying to eat the Pizookie (cookie) dessert without her. However, I had dinner here with my boyfriend last night. We started with crispy portobello mushroom strips. For dinner, I ordered a soup/salad (chicken tortilla/wedge) combo and he had jambalaya. He also ordered a wedge salad to start. I asked that our salads be brought out together, thinking perhaps mine would be served with my soup, as an entree.  The appetizer came out and was delicious. Our server did an excellent job of keeping our drinks full and checking in on us. When we were almost done with the appetizer, my bf's jambalaya was brought out. No food for me, and no salads.  We told the girl who brought his plate out not to worry about his salad at that point, since he already had his entree.  However, a few minutes later my soup and salad, and his salad, were all brought out together. Even though we asked her not to bring his wedge, it remained on the bill at the end of the night. Kind of weird to serve a customer's salad after their entree and then still charge them for it after they say they don't want it anymore.  We had other things to do though and really did enjoy our server's good service, so instead of complaining and wasting time, we just left. Honestly, it's funny but the only part of our meals I didn't really enjoy was the salad. The chicken tortilla soup was excellent, and jambalaya very good too, but the salads were absolutely drenched in dressing and mine had almost no tomatoes on it while his was covered in chopped tomatoes. A little more consistency and a little less dressing would be nice."
Shayna W.,"Ukiah, CA",91,1,,1.0,10/2/2017,"Literally was of the worse servers iv had in a long time. Karen, was our server tonight and she just gave off so much attitude. Our food came out fine, but we asked for ranch and blue cheese right when the food came out. It took her 20 mins to get us the dressings because she kept forgetting. I'd understand if it was busy, but it wasn't. She had maybe 3 tables in her section but the only thin. She was worried about was talking to her coworkers and the boys that worked there. When it came time to leave, she gave us the receipts (we had split 3 ways and she knew that from the beginning because she asked) and so once we told her what was wrong she took 10 mins to come back just to find out she messed up on them again. While telling her what was wrong she was giving us attitude like it was a hardship. Horrible service in dinning area. Sit at the bar, you get better service there!"
Brandon M.,"Moraga, CA",0,1,,2.0,2/11/2017,"I've been in there 10 times in 2016. 2 out of 10 times they get things right. I usually order the Chipotle Salmon and usually what happens is its undercooked and with a different sauce than what what described. One time it was so bad it has has gotten me sick... The 2 times they got it right was very good however... service was lacking. There have been times where it took an hour to get seated (understandable) then 1:45hr to get our food because the server forgot about us and served the other tables. Also, never forget your wallet because the manager refused to let me look under the table even though I knew it was there. When the customers left, sure enough it was there with all my money stolen.... Positive: wide variety of food and some good beer"
