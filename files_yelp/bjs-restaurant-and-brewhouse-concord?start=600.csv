Crystal L.,"Discovery Bay, CA",8,6,,2.0,5/21/2014,I have been to BJ's several times in the past and my latest visit was to this location which I have also been to a few times. The menu was changed which was extremely disappointing because I love the giant baked potatoes which are no longer on the menu. Since my favorite was no longer offered I went with what I felt was a safe choice and that was a french dip type sandwich. The sandwich was not very good. There were a lot of chewy pieces of meat that I had to spit out and also the au jus was pretty much a cup of grease! I was just all together disappointed in the food and the service wasn't much better.
Alma C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",59,21,1,1.0,7/4/2015,"This was my first time going to BJ's because of all the things I've heard about them. At first it was okay, the hostess's greeted us. But did not ask us if we wanted a table, instead, they told us immediately to go to the bar? We agreed anyway because we were hungry. We waited for atleast 15min to get noticed by the damn bartender, Jacob. I asked for the menu right away, and it took him another 10min to give us a menu, if I hadn't reminded him, he would have forgotten all the way. The food was cold already when it got to our table about 45min after ordering and we didnt waste our time anymore to ask for a replacement since we were starving. We were told by hostess that there is Happy Hour and when we got our checks, it wasn't there because apparently, Saturdays does not have happy hour. This place sucks and you should just take your money else where."
Juice C.,"Dublin, CA",2,69,9,4.0,2/12/2012,1. Ambiance is pretty good in the Concord one. TV's everywhere with plenty of space and a nice central bar. I have yet to find a place that competes with the selection of beers this place has. I did try the appetizer of guacamole rolls that was awesome!
Kathryn M.,"Concord, CA",0,10,,1.0,10/7/2013,"Stopped in for an early dinner on a Friday night.  Once we got seated with menus, waitress finally came around, put her knee on the extra chair and took our order.  We had no silverware which she noticed.  She brought our water but no silverware.   I noticed there was a bug or something in my water so we asked for the manger.  We showed it to him and he took away the glasses. The waitress brought us new water but made no apologies. 10 minutes later came back and tossed 3 sets of silverware on the table.   When we got our order, we asked the runner for water as we were out and no one noticed. She never came back with water so we stopped someone else and asked her.  She was able to fill 2 of 3 glasses and we asked for a pitcher so we wouldn't have to keep trying to ask someone. She said she would be right back but again, never returned. French fries were cold on 2 of the dinners. Waitress never asked how our dinner was.  She did come over at one point with another server and leaned around one of us, stated 'oh they are fine' and left again. Once again out of water, we were able to find her and ask for water.  She brought enough for 1 1/2 refills even though there were 3 of us at the table.  When we brought it to her attention, she blew it off and said she would go get more and the pitcher wasn't filled all the way and that's why there wasn't enough. We asked to speak to the manager again.  We saw him talking to her but he never came to the table.  So we asked another server for the manager.  When he finally came over, she stated that she had not told him we wanted to talk to him! He knelt at the table and apologized and said he would talk to her about her service.  While he was talking to us, the waitress leaned over him, grabbed the ketchup off our table and walked away!  Some of this may sound picky and I know it is not an upscale restaurant, but the rude, inconsistent and often lack of service was out of control.   We will NOT be back."
Lin F.,"Vallejo, CA",2,27,2,1.0,5/10/2015,"Had dinner here last night and it was a nightmare. We sat for 15 mins before the waiter recognized us and finally took our drink order. When i got my ice tea it tasted like there was nothing but sugarin it. Than dinner came and i ordered the fish and chips, my fish had a piece of calamari stuck to it and i am allergic. When i told the waitress she asked if i was sure it was in my food when they brought it?? Accusing me of lying?"
Ramak H.,"Moraga, CA",1,3,,1.0,6/6/2011,"My good friend worked for BJ's at another location and I love that place.  So, of course, I go visit one near my house and end up having a horrible experience.  My friend and I go to sit at the bar area where it didnt seem very busy and wait anxiously for our server to order our drinks before we start looking at the menus.  First,  we werent even acknowledged, we had to flag down the server after sitting for 5 minutes.  She then brings our menus and takes our drink orders.  Fifteen minutes go by!!  We are watching the bartender and no sign of our martinis.  Finally our drinks arrive and we order food and I feel like that was the last we seen of our server.  Im easy going and hate to be a bother, but JEEZ, i almost felt like she was deliberately ignoring us.  It wasnt that busy.....maybe she cant handle more than 3 tables at a time.   O yeah, and when the food arrived....25 MINUTES later, there was no silverware, napkins, extra plates, or anything.  The server herself dropped off the food and left the table as if there really wasnt anything missing.. we then had to flag her down again for silverware.   Really wanted to say something, but I think my tip reflected the service much better than me saying something I might regret.  Thanks BJ's"
Sophea U.,"Concord, CA",98,38,6,4.0,6/15/2013,"This place is one of my favorites! Great selection of food, and very delicious all-American dishes. I love their moscato and stuffed mushrooms. The service is just as great as the food, and a wonderful ambiance. Not to mention very kid-friendly. :)"
David P.,"Alamo, CA",5,53,,3.0,2/7/2014,"Plenty of parking aka it's in the mall. Lighting is great. Good beers as its a brewery. Food reminds me of good bar food. If you're hungry at the mall and don't feel like fighting the food court, BJ it up."
Ben C.,"Seattle, WA",444,54,,4.0,5/24/2011,"BJ's Restaurant is a great place to grab lunch for me and the crew. We like coming here when we want some good food and to have a decent atmosphere after a few drag in the classes. Their gourmet mac and cheese is amazing! It is very cheap and only costs 3-4 dollars, and it is pretty filling with a side of garlic bread. I also really like the soup here, as well as the sandwiches. I have rarely been disappointed with the food here, except the service can be very different, sometimes great, sometimes not so.  Gotta take off a star for an unpleasant experience with one of the waiters, and that their utensils are not washed properly, but its not that big of a deal for me. Hopefully I won't find any food here that will make me sad :)"
David C.,"Concord, CA",0,48,,2.0,4/2/2016,"We've eaten here many times since they opened.  The food is actually good. I've never had a bad meal here.   I had the ribs today and they were excellent.  The customer service is horrible and that's why we rarely eat here anymore, every time we go here it seems to be worse.  Today was about the worst.  It took about 15 minutes for our server to show up at our table. It seemed to be a bother to take the drink order.  About 15 minutes later the drinks arrived and our order was taken. The meal arrived about 30 minutes later. You would think that with ribs you would get a warm towel like you do everywhere else, not here. After we finished the meal, I had to ask for a towel. I waited another 10 minutes and went to the restroom to wash my hands. I had to ask for the bill. We were seated at 4:15 pm and paid our bill at 5.45 pm. and there wasn't many people in the place. Just sloooooooooooow service."
Melody K.,"Brentwood, CA",154,274,395,5.0,3/29/2011,"I love this place!!! Met a friend here for lunch and had AWESOME service! Waiter was attentive, nice and really on top of things! Food was great. Had the California Chicken and loved it..so tasty! I also saw the Happy Hour menu...good selection and good prices. Definately will be back again and again!"
Mike S.,"San Francisco, CA",95,337,29,3.0,11/10/2011,"it's an Ok place, another (Chili's or elephant bar), but this one has the best brownie/ice cream dessert. Our order did a while to come out, and we had to ask for it several times before it actually came out.  we didn't mind though, since my friends and I were actually enjoying the conversation"
Tracy A.,"Berkeley, CA",426,29,6,3.0,5/13/2011,The decor and lighting is nice.... service good so far.  I will taste the food and see how it is. My chicken salad was delish!!!
Michelle W.,"Brentwood, CA",167,351,41,3.0,11/8/2011,"We were surprised that on a Sunday we were seated right away at noon. It seemed like we got there just in time because 10 minutes later and it was busy.   It's not as loud as the BJ's in Brentwood so every little noise our 1 year old made seemed really loud.   We ordered the calamari since our oldest loves it. It came our luke warm and the crust was soggy.  Hubby got the french toast, again.  Son, got the mac and cheese and I had the crispy jalapeno burger.  The burger was awesome!   Service was good and the waitress said that our kids were great.  She did make a comment about how some kids should be on a leash which was kind of weird."
Hanna W.,"Concord, CA",2,16,,4.0,11/6/2012,"LOVE their Mediterranean pizza!  LOVE their boneless wings.  LOVE their beer!   I don't like that they don't take reservations and it's tough to find parking.  It's recommended that you call ahead if you want your name on the wait list and I definitely recommend that you park on the side of the mall, near JCPenney, instead of in front, if you want to avoid driving around in circles."
Danny T.,"Vallejo, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/12/2015,"3/12/2015 So I came to write this review based on the manager On duty Daniel . My family and I came to this bjs at 8:00 pm. We order our food at 8:15. Within 10 min out appetizer and beverages came out. In my head I was thinking we are going to get our food pretty quick. We finished our drinks and appetizer by 845 and enjoyed the game that was on tv. Around 915 I noticed our food wasn't out yet. Keep in mind it was not busy. At 930 our waiter (Amy) came to our table to explain to us the mishap that happened in the kitchen. She informed us that our food is on priority and will be out ASAP. In addition she informed us that the manager was going to come around to speak to us. Now I get it, nothing is every perfect and things happen. Our food came out 20min later and our waiter asked if the manager came around yet to ""speak to us"". I was not expecting a lot. I wasn't even expecting free food. The manager Daniel came around and asked us ""if there anything else you need or anything I can get for you"" we replied with ""no its ok"" and he went on and said ""if there is anything else you need just let the waiter know"". Now I've worked in retail for a long time and things happen but for the manager to show ZERO EMPATHY was beyond my imagination. A simple acknowledgment that our food came out later and a simply apology for that would have made it a semi better experience. You are the manager duty of a large establishment and I would have expected more. Once again on the record I understand things happen, but for you leader/manager on duty to that type of demeanor is unacceptable. His lack of empathy left me with negative remark of this BJs establishment."
Jessica L.,"Oakland, CA",123,169,34,3.0,11/9/2011,"The food is OK. The service is OK. Their beer is OK. It is in a mall after all.......... They have a lot of craft beers to choose from beside their own brews and they have a good happy hour special on their mini pizzas, half off."
Eli M.,"Vallejo, CA",238,222,77,2.0,8/19/2013,"Seriously we have had a bad experience the past few times we have come here! Today we had all dirty knives and forks, they forgot our Caesar salad, the food took 45 minutes to get. The original server was amazing  but when you have 3 different people bring out your food the original server has no clue what all came out. Thank god he took the salad off our check! Bonus is he told us how many point we had on our rewards card so we got a free pizookie"
tabisky c.,"Walnut Creek, CA",1,334,1,3.0,2/20/2012,"Attentive staff and manager who accommodated our request to sit at a booth. The menu is large and the items are reasonably priced. However, my shrimp taco was not that great. Chunks of raw onion blasted my taste buds and the tortilla was cold and rubbery.  My friend had the ahi salad and she liked it a lot and recommended that we try it the next time."
J M.,"Martinez, CA",0,14,2,2.0,2/24/2015,"Hit or miss, but mostly miss.  Wilted salads, found a hair in my food- yuck! They do have bomb shrimp tacos though,  pretty much the only thing on the menu that I like."
