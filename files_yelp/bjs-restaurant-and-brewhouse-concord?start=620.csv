Sunny J.,"Chatsworth, CA",33,81,3,3.0,11/20/2011,"BJ's is one of my favorite restaurants. Why? Because the food has never disappointed me. The only thing that lacks from location to location is service. Any BJs I go to, service is always a hit or miss. Since it's always packed you would think staffing will be increased to produce quick turnover, but that doesnt fly normally with the BJ's family. Regardless i'll keep loathing for a pizookie and their pizza. The Concord location wasn't too bad... Service just could have been better as my friend waited 30 minutes for water."
Danielle G.,"Benicia, CA",0,3,10,2.0,4/2/2014,My husband ordered a Long Island and it was too sweet. Not usual for a Long Island! I had the skinny margarita and it was sweet also. Hardly tasted any liquor in either. I had mahi mahi for dinner and it was sooo dry. My daughters Kraft macaroni and cheese looked like it had been made the day before and warmed in a microwave. I can do better with the single serve in the microwave. I used to really like this place but I'm not coming back for a long time!
Jeannie E.,"East Bay, CA",2,5,,3.0,7/1/2013,"I frequent often and the service has home downhill. Visited last week BEFORE the lunch crowd and just after they opened. Waiters white shirt was a mess. I inquired and he said he made a big batch of tea and spilled. Funny, it didn't look like tea, but I believed him. His apron had white stuff all over too. I wouldn't have thought much more of it, but we were seated next to the window and 30 minutes later, I noticed another employee parked in the very first parking spot (aren't they supposed to leave the good spots for customers?), get out of her car. From a distance I noticed her shirt wasn't clean and as she walked past the window while tying her apron, I could see her apron was filthy. I can't believe management allows that. Things do get spilled in a food business and I assume there are extra shirts and clothing just in case. How can you allow an employee to start a shift looking filthy?  That is unacceptable. I'm still considering speaking with a manager, but I doubt it will make a difference. I had to wait so long to pay after asking, that I don't think they care anymore.  The food was good, but it still disappoints me with the changes they made in the soup/salad lunch special. I'd be willing to pay more if all the salad and soup choices were available daily like they used to be."
Ali L.,"Antioch, CA",2,74,5,4.0,11/5/2013,I've had good experiences here. Food is good. Drinks are good. Pricey but hey when is going out to eat at a brew house cheap?
Jeannean L.,"Sacramento, CA",8,4,1,1.0,2/16/2015,I absolutely LOVE BJs and have always had exceptional service and amazing food. I am from sacramento and came to this Bjs to take my niece out to lunch to find that sacramento and concord bjs must hold themselves to a different standards. The hottest was unfriendly and our waiter was slow and non responsive. We ordered right away however every table around us for their food before our appetizer. When our food finally came out I ordered the pulled pork. No fries they weren't done yet it was cold the onion rings were soggy and there was no sauce. My niece had turkey club it was dry and not very toasted as well as cold. I had them take mine back and left hungry will never return.
Lyndi M.,"Concord, CA",20,25,,1.0,3/26/2014,Had dinner here last night. Service was slow and server was not very friendly. Never smiled or even asked how we were. Took forever to get our drinks. Food was mediocre at best.  Nope won't be coming back here.
Christine C.,"Dublin, CA",120,156,2,2.0,10/1/2011,"I've always liked BJ's.  The food isn't too original, but its always had a good consistent taste.  With that said, I am not a fan of this particular BJ's.  I have been going to BJ's since I was a wee little teenager and this is by far the worst BJ's I have ever been to.   The service is either a hit or miss.  I have had good service and I have had horrible service. There have been a number of times when I have had some of my order comped which is nice.  What would have been better is if one my appetizers hadn't been served to me frozen in the middle or if my food had come within an hour.  The food being comped was a result of me talking to the manager and I am not much of a complainer.   The food is as decent as other BJ's have been, but with the less than appealing service, waiters with eyes full of judgement when it comes to everyone thats steps food in the restaurant and frozen/food that never came, I think I'll pass.  If I ever get a craving for a Pzookie, maybe I'll go over to the one in Vacaville....it may be far but at least its next to an outlet."
Hannah K.,"Tara Hills, CA",185,181,31,4.0,9/28/2013,"Food was actually pretty good and the customer service was friendly. I guess it deserves four stars... so I am going to change it, but it can get noisy in the restaurant, especially when there is a football game going on."
Jim N.,"Clayton, CA",0,18,,3.0,3/22/2014,"I have eaten here several times and am usually satisfied with the food.  The menu has a huge selection to choose from.  There beer menu is just ok.  Their house beer is terrible.  Don't fall for their dessert ""pizzuki"" it's a joke."
Mark H.,"Hercules, CA",136,80,175,2.0,3/11/2011,"I ordered the balsamic chicken and it's was really good. It came w/ 2 chicken breasts on top of a lil spring salad w/ a side of buttery mashed potatoes   drizzled with balsamic vinegar. Calories= (750).  Wifey ordered the fish tacos, it came with 2 fish tacos chipotle sauce w/ cabbage slaw, chips, creamy guacamole and salsa. Calories (750). That was good too. As far as food was  concerned it was pretty good.  SERVICE= fir me my past 2 and only 2 times I've been here, the service really sucks!!!! They take way to long just to give u water. And our waitress was so slow and not attentive to service that we was ready to walk out both times. She would pass us up and not have our drinks and the food takes longer than usual to serve so.....I would never go back here based on my experience. Ur better off going to elephant bar or claim jumpers. Service sucks here at this est."
Food C.,"Napa, CA",1,44,5,3.0,6/17/2013,"First, call ahead when you are on your way. This way you only have a 10-15 minute wait on a Fri or Sat night rather then 45 -60min. Server was nice and informative. Pizza was good (hence not great). If they could have cooked it for 3-4 minutes I think it would have been hot all they way through rather then just warm. Toppings good and fresh. Beer good and when I couldn't make up my mind on which one to choice they brought me 2 samples to try. (nice touch). The management just needs to remind the young workers to make an extra effort to clear empty glasses and plates, make sure there are napkins & utensils on the table (or at least bring them after seating. People should have to ask for things like to be done). Overall I guess I would go again to try a different pizza but it wouldn't be my first choice."
D R.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",11,26,,2.0,2/4/2014,"BJ's is hit and miss. We've had good experiences and not so good experiences. We were there last night (on a Monday) and the service was slow, the food took way over a half hour and wasn't brought out at the same time. The place was maybe 70% capacity so it wasn't like they were incredibly busy. The spaghetti sauce was runny and the burger was way too salty. Wine is way overpriced but the beer is decent and priced fairly. It's not a bad place to eat but there's a lot better in the area."
B H.,"Martinez, CA",0,11,,2.0,5/27/2013,Just had dinner at BJ's in Concord. The wait was really long because there were at least 15 tables not bussed. Not a huge crowd waiting to be seated either. Finally after waiting 25 minutes for a party of 3 and having other parties that came in after us be seated first had to say something. The front desk girl finally bussed a table herself for us. Our server was very nice. House salad was plain iceberg (which had rotten pieces of lettuce) dressing and one slice of cucumber. No croutons or anything else. We used to like coming here but the past few times have been really lacking in food quality and cleanliness. Time to try a new place.
Paris G.,"Concord, CA",1,2,,4.0,6/5/2013,Went here with a party of about 30 ppl. Service was pretty good and food was great as usual. Luv their fish and chips! Great experience even with the large party!
Jeromy G.,"Foster City, CA",602,660,1032,4.0,8/6/2013,"This review is for Happy Hour. My coworkers and I came here after work to grab a bite to eat and a drink. I have to say overall we had fun. We ordered drinks, the girls cosmos, myself a mojito. My mojito was made well and it tasted good and the girls said their cosmos were good as well. The servers were nice and really helpful when we were figuring out what to order. We got the artichoke dip, avocado rolls, mini deep dish and a flatbread. All of the items were really tasty and very cheap, around $4, $5 or $6 depending on what you got which is a good deal. The drinks as well, so you could get mixed drinks, beer or wine and it's included in the happy hour prices which was nice. So I got one of their beers and it was pretty good while the girls got a lemon drop that they said was their favorite. For desert we each got a glass of wine and the 3 pizookie which is a cookie topped with ice cream and we got red velvet, chocolate and macadamia nut. All were amazing, I'm surprised I never had it before. The happy hour deals are worth it, good food and drinks for a good price so I will come again."
B V.,"Antioch, CA",0,15,,1.0,5/13/2013,"WORST. BJ's. IN. THE. WORLD! Your food sucks, and so does your customer service."
Joshua E.,"Miami Beach, FL",62,13,11,3.0,1/26/2014,Very fast and friendly service. Only reason I gave it 3 stars is because The food is mediocre when compared to the price.
Mike H.,"Antioch, CA",8,29,,3.0,4/20/2014,"Food is alright and the service is hit or miss, you can't mess up a beer and the beer has always been good but other than that a subpar experience"
Vanessa S.,"Oakland, CA",475,783,361,2.0,7/9/2011,"I'm not really a fan of BJ's. I do enjoy their deep dish pizza and their music selection is pretty good. Other than that, I could live without it."
Daniel P.,"Beaverton, OR",13,84,58,5.0,10/29/2009,"Well I went twice this week and overall I had two great experiences. The first time I went for lunch, as I got to school right across the street and someone suggested popping over. The service was fine, it was in the middle of the day on a Tuesday so it was pretty slow, so there were a few servers attending to us.. I had never been to this chain before, but my friend had and suggested the pizza. I had the Cheeseburger pizza and he had the Great White, we both shared a little and I must say that they were both excellent!!! I got some of their house brewed root beer, it was pretty good but not amazing or anything. However considering it didn't really cost a lot and there were free refills I would recommend it for perhaps a long dinner. Their register computer was down so they gave us free ice cream without even a second thought and I really appreciated that.  The next night we had a final and I suggested to someone that we go over to BJ's and that I had had a good meal the previous day. Now THIS was a good test of how well BJ's performs under pressure. I got there first with a friend and we got a table for 4, this was right during dinner time and they were packed but we got a table after maybe 15 minutes. Soon after that we were joined by three other friends from our class that had heard we were coming....and then six other people.....and then eight other people!!! Almost our entire class of thirty showed up when they had no tables and in the middle of the dinner rush!! SOMEHOW the good people at BJ's found seats for everyone, while providing seats to the people waiting in line, AND continuing to serve us without interruption. WOW.!!! So on to the food, I tried the spring rolls and the calamari, and I enjoyed the classic Angus burger for my entree. The spring rolls were fine, but sort of small for the price. The calamari was soggy rather than crispy and yet was cooked completely properly and had wonderful flavor, and usually I hate soggy calamari. I have had a decent handful of gourmet style burgers, and this one was one of the best. The bun was hot and toasted, the meat was flavorful, and overall the burger was a good size. Also the potato wedges on the side were tasty and definitely plentiful, I even shared them with a friend (and I HATE sharing!). I will definitely be going back sometime."
