Rochelle R.,"Sacramento, CA",219,84,55,5.0,8/9/2011,"I LOVE BJs as a chain and love the fact that after I moved from Sacramento to the Bay area 4 years later there is a BJs in my back yard now!  I love the Pizzookie!!! (the Trio is the best so you can try three) Service is always great - I've gone for Sunday football, lunches, dinners, drinks, apps etc.  Everything is great.  There is sometimes a wait but BJs has a call ahead program where you call with parties of 2-9 and get seated within 5 minutes from your scheduled time for the call in. The pizzas are delish. Stuffed Mushrooms are to die for! Every time they taste great! I like the mozzarella and Tomato Salad as well.   The new enLIGHTment meals (for those who are calorie/health conscious) is awesome! I love the new choices.   Concords Locations is Great! I've held my birthday at the Roseville Location for a group of 25 and it was fantastic as well!"
Sean W.,"Concord, CA",3,123,,3.0,10/15/2013,This place has good food but the service is slow I do like the drinks and all of the tv's but the service sucks  the margaritas are as was as the long island ice tea I personally do not recommend the house beers
Brian G.,"Walnut Creek, CA",150,246,,3.0,10/16/2011,"Obviously BJ's is a big chain, but this particular location I would go back to.  BJ's has a large selection of beer for such a chain type place.  They also have a lot of different TV's going on at all times in the bar.  It's first come, first serve there too so you don't need to wait around forever if you're smart about it. Service and food was just ok, but based on the TV's and beer selection I'll be back."
Arianna B.,"Hercules, CA",1,9,1,4.0,2/25/2014,"Loved the Crispy Jalapeno burger!! Fried jalapenos, pepper jack cheese, chipotle mayonnaise, Baja sauce, red onions, tomato and lettuce. Perfect combo."
John A.,"Walnut Creek, CA",140,22,14,5.0,9/3/2013,"Katie was amazing - I came in for a late lunch with my boyfriend, she was very quick, friendly and helpful. She asked us at least 5 times if we needed anything. Have not had service like this in awhile."
Christin V.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",15,10,,4.0,11/21/2013,We had lunch here today and I must say that I was thoroughly pleased with the excellent customer service given by Natalie & the manager!
Diana C.,"Corona, CA",204,691,796,3.0,7/30/2013,"Good beer, good cocktails, and average food. Like how they are their own brewhouse. The prices on pints are decent. I like that there is a lot of variety when it comes to everything. They serve big portions too. I always have to take a box to go. Wait time is a lot though. Especially on weekends. You have the option of making reservations M-F before 5:30pm."
Maxwell R.,"Eugene, OR",224,49,2,4.0,7/6/2013,"OK, to be clear, BJ's isn't getting the 4-star rating here, their bar staff at this particular location is. Very pleasurable experience, much classier then competing chains. Our waiter memorized our elaborate drink order with a friendly face, even while the game was on and the place was packed. Clean, ambient atmosphere."
Bill D.,"Concord, CA",31,7,1,2.0,1/12/2014,Came here for brunch and the waitress said they ran out of eggs.  She then proceeded to tell us that they run out eggs every sunday. Avoid brunch here.
Jonathan R.,"Concord, CA",257,885,1047,4.0,6/10/2013,"Great beer and good food, what more can you ask for. I was greeted by the hostess who asked me if I wanted to sick in the cocktail lounge because it's open seating. I tell her no, just a regular table and her attitude seemed to change from happy to not so happy. But I was seated pretty much right away. While I was waiting for Terri to come in our server Chris brought us both water. I noticed both the drink menu and the table were a little sticky. Finally Terri comes in and we place our orders. She ordered the Bison burger which was on there under 600 calories menu and I had the jalapeno burger cooked rare. Thank god it was actually cooked rare, I believe this is only the fifth place I've tried that have successfully cooked my burger the way I want it. The fried jalapenos and the pepper jack cheese with the spicy mayo gave it a great kick. However it was very uneven. Some bites would have the full spicy bite, and others would have no kick to it at all.  Instead of getting fries I decided to go with a dinner salad. It was OK but I've had better salads in less popular places. One thing I hate is whole tomato slices in a salad. I tried Terri's Bison burger and it was amazing. I would love to have switched but I knew that wasn't happening, haha. For dessert we ordered the triple sampler of Pazookie. Awesome stuff. We had the original which was a warm chocolate chip cookie and vanilla bean ice cream on top, raspberry and white chocolate cookie with vanilla bean ice cream, and red velvet  cake cookie with vanilla bean ( my personal favorite.) Our server was Chris and he was very good, saying yes sir, no sir, very polite young man. One thing though is after he would ask a question, or after we answer one, he would stand and stare for a second and then walk away. I tried there Piranha ale, and it was delicious. Very good experience here."
Dan B.,"Deltona, FL",0,2,4,1.0,6/26/2012,Do not go to bar if u r gluten free. Anne does not have a clue.  To bad 4 people w/allergies.  Never again.  Manager was nice when i complained.
Michelle G.,"Pinole, CA",0,1,,1.0,2/15/2015,"KATIE has the worst customer service. Don't asks her to split your bill because she won't understand, does not understand the menu. We felt so comfortable that we had to pay for our drinks and cancelled the order and leave."
Mark M.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,39,,1.0,2/15/2015,"Thought I would give them another try. What a mistake. Will not give them another visit. This time, the fries were soggy. Sent them back and got crisp proper fries. The burger bun had been frozen and then blasted in an oven making it rock hard like a brick! The burger was bland and unseasoned. Needless to say only took one bite of this and sent it back. Glad I started with a iceberg wedge which was good. The meal was comped. Just wondering how this type of crap can get past quality control."
Ana C.,"Hercules, CA",32,49,1,4.0,2/11/2011,"Good beer, good food, and Dorene (the best bartender there).  The overall service at BJ's is so-so. Sometimes its good, sometimes its alright. Now, I usually sit at the bar area. I love it when Dorene is the bartender. She makes great drinks and her service is great. She's always checking up on us to make sure our cups are full."
Eva M.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",93,73,7,3.0,9/13/2013,Pretty good place. One of the few places that the whole family can go to and find something they like. Hubby loves the fact that they have a goat cheese option on some of the flat bread pizzas (he is very  lactose intolerant). I love the fact they they have healthy options for the kids menu and I've never had a server ask if we wanted desert loud enough for my toddler to hear. Long waits between 6 and 7:30 though.
Andrew H.,"Castro Valley, CA",41,50,41,2.0,8/5/2013,"I dont know if it was because our server was new, but we had terrible service here while sitting out on the patio, had to get up and walk around the restaurant to find her to ask for another drink 3 more servers had to come out and help her, wish i could have tipped the girl who helped us as opposed to our actual server. =/"
Diana G.,"Martinez, CA",24,2,,1.0,2/9/2014,"I cannot begin to describe the level of incompetence that the wait staff exhibited during our visit. Yes we were a party of 13. But we were a reservation and a birthday party. The waiter did not keep track of who ordered what. We negotiated separate checks for smaller groups in the party. Food was ordered and not served for almost an hour as were beverage orders. Orders were misplaced. At the end of the meal, the bill was brought and it was one bill and we were told we would have to separate it out as the waiter couldn't recall who ordered what. Even after we separated and organized the orders for him, he STILL messed up the separate checks. This took another half hour to sort out. We were at the restaurant for over an hour trying to  FIX the mess the waiter had made. The Manager was NEVER called. The waiter tried to ""make it all up to us"" by compting 25 % of the meals. This is no way to run a restaurant and yes I would know as my grandfather owned one for many years. We will NEVER be going back to this establishment."
Stacey T.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",0,12,,2.0,3/8/2012,"I'm giving them two stars because I like the food, but the service is terrible!  Something is always messed up when I go here.  My last experience was we ordered two dinners, pizookie's, and root beers to go over the phone.  It was a Thursday night.  They said to come pick it up in 20 min.  Well, AN HOUR later, they finally gave us our food.  The manager only comped the root beers which is only a couple bucks.  Definitely makes me think twice before going back there."
Tera M.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",24,18,,1.0,12/17/2013,HORRIBLE! ! Ridiculously long waits. On last visit our waitress Sara was extremely unprofessional and RUDE!  Don't waste your time or $$.
Justin R.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",30,29,25,5.0,7/26/2013,"Katie was my waitress, very professional with a wonderful smile! Was always on top of my drinks an food!"
