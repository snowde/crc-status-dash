Maggie A.,"Walnut Creek, CA",97,19,16,2.0,10/16/2012,"Nothing is really special about BJ's. The food is just ok and universal, and the beer selection is alright, I have had better and good ones. The Happy Hour is really bad, (its juts a dollar off) and very very sweet cocktails.  Not to mention, the floor is very very slippery and I think its very dangerous when you have a full bar, and serve alcohol drinks. I have seen many guests slipped and hurt themselves.  I just go here sometimes because its the only local restaurant that has TV and play sports."
Laura P.,"San Francisco, CA",321,197,134,5.0,5/30/2011,"Ok, ok I'll finally give this place the stars I think it deserves.  What pushed me to finally review? The Ahi salad. Seared fresh ahi, avocado, cabbage, FRESH baby greens (it's amazing how often they are not fresh other places)  spinach, marinated cucumbers and tomatoes.  UM yes please thank you. They also have gluten free pizza and beer.   What more could a girl ask for? Oh yeah, excellent service! Our server Chelsea was great. I'm not saying BJ's is up there with Michael Mina or anything, but for this category, this BJ's gets my 5 stars.  Bravo!"
Jada B.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",16,105,86,2.0,11/3/2014,"The two stars are strictly for the food. We came on a Sunday when numerous football games were on and they were busy. Despite that, our server was super attentive ( I would rate her 5 stars) and accommodating in every way. We were craving burgers so this is where we landed since we were already at the mall. My sister ordered the Double Deluxe Burger without tomatoes, pickles and any condiments (i.e. no sauce). I ordered the Brewhouse burger w/ bacon, no pickles. When our burgers came, both were seemingly dry of any condiments. I understand that confusion since my sisters request was kind of odd when you read the description of the burger and there probably was just a mix up with our table. No big deal to me. I just asked our waitress for some mayo (which my burger originally was supposed to come with) and added it myself with some ketchup. This burger was still so bland!! Just no flavor at all except for the few bites I could taste the bacon. And the bun was soooo dry! I ended up picking off parts of it to get around the dryness. It was actually a chore to try and finish this thing. My sister said her burger was good but half of the bun had a weird mustardy type of sauce on it. I got the wedge cut fries, her the crispy thin and both were very tasty. Next time I think I would try one of their signature pizza's. As a side note, as someone else mentioned before me, the table behind us also tried to order the pumpkin beer off of the advertisement on the table only to be told they did not have it."
Jacquelyn H.,"Concord, CA",45,84,6,4.0,7/18/2013,"We have been here a few times and no complaints here. I love the avocado egg rolls, yum! I didn't give it 5 stars because there is nothing out of this world about this place."
Christopher H.,"Oakland, CA",11,21,,4.0,12/1/2011,"1. The food. BJ's food is all pretty good for it's type, price, and location. Pizza is definitely their better dishes but I've enjoyed their pastas and burgers. Salads are probably their weakest dish. 2. Ambiance is pretty good in the Concord one. TV's everywhere with plenty of space and a nice central bar. 3. Waiters have always been pretty good and never had an issue with any of them. In fact when my girlfriends order was messed up once they took special care to correct it and give her extra. 4. It's a good moderately priced place to hang. This is definitely my neighborhood restaurant."
Karen S.,"Danville, CA",13,52,1,2.0,1/8/2011,"Updated 6/2911 - I tried the vegetarian pizza for lunch and would go back again for it. While the restaurant is clean and pretty the food I've eaten here is seriously unremarkable.  I've tried many things in my visits - salads, soup, pasta, burger, sandwiches and none of them have flavor and for as many calories as are jam packed into a meal I don't come away feeling satisfied.  The ambience is great, the service is ok but the food is what makes me not want to go back.  Maybe I should try happy hour there!"
Justin G.,"Martinez, CA",3,35,4,1.0,11/17/2014,"Hi BJs. I went to your concord location this weekend for my brother's birthday. We were told an hour long wait for our party of 8. Waited an hour and twenty while tables sat visibly empty. Ordered pizza and appetizers. Pizzas all came out first which would have been fine if the four servers we had to ask for silverware had actually brought them so we could eat our food. And all this shit service was underscored by an unapologetic and apathetic staff.  Pretty embarrassing if you ask me. Oh yeah, and learn how to get refills to people for crap sake."
Grace L.,"San Diego, CA",1143,621,560,2.0,7/22/2010,"Wow.....somehow I'm the queen of ""let's go to an alehouse at the most inopportune time ever."" During this lunch visit, Concord High seniors just had their graduation, so the place was swarming with 17 & 18 year olds and their clans. On top of that, the bar was completely filled because of World Cup. One star for being seated somewhat soon despite being really busy. Another star for the food, which was decent. We had the chicken caesar salad and the fish tacos. One thing they forgot to do: dressing on the side. Big no-no. The tacos I enjoyed because they had this delicious avocado salsa to accompany it.  Minus 3 stars for the service. It's been well over a month and I can still remember how unprofessional and snooty the waitress was. When we mentioned the ""dressing on the side"" issue, she responded, ""Oh sorry about that. Our kitchen is incompetent."" Wow. Seriously? I can interpret that in so many ways, don't even get me started. And maybe it was her fault to begin with for not writing down the order correctly. Unfortunately, I'll probably find myself here another time or two because of its vicinity to the mall. I'll just remind myself not to go on gamedays and make sure my waitress isn't a snooty you-know-what."
Frankie-Rain M.,"Antioch, CA",99,3,,1.0,9/20/2013,Horrible service. We came here to celebrate my nephews birthday & it was pretty much soiled because of the service.
C M.,"Santa Barbara, CA",37,101,162,2.0,8/10/2011,"Blah. Meh.  I can see why some people might like the bar, but steer clear of the restaurant.  Granted it is attached to a mall so my expectations were low, but the service was the worst I've had anywhere in a long time.  We waited so long for everything.  Server was really nice but clearly they were shorthanded.  Food  was just so so.  Bland bland bland.  I had the pale beer sampler, they brew on site. All 4 came out warm, taste was decent, best was the hefeweizen.  3 in the group tried the house made sodas, those were really good. Only other possitive I can see is if you want to watch sports there a ton of TVs with all the games."
JM L.,"Vallejo, CA",1,5,2,1.0,11/17/2013,"11.17.13. Just left the restaurant...hungry and disappointed! Got there at about 8:40 pm. We were promised about 15 minutes of wait. There were a LOT of vacant tables, one section was completely empty. At  about 9:10, for some odd reason - we were asked to wait for another 30 minutes. Unbelievable!"
Ken F.,"Martinez, CA",11,37,9,4.0,2/17/2011,"Went to BJ's last night and had some great eats during Happy Hour. My first time to BJs was a couple of weeks ago for a business meeting (Yes it really was a meeting). I had the Hefeweizen and OMG! - it was the best Hefeweizen I had ever had and probably one of the top 5 beers I had ever had in my life. (The best was the Guinness I had at the brewery in Dublin, Ireland.)  Anyway....just had to go back and take my wife Michele. She got a glass of the BJ's P.M. Porter to start with.  Our first order was for the calamari. Not the best calamari we had ever had, but darn close. Next came the pulled pork BBQ sliders, four of them on a plate with fries and cold claw. They were excellent but, 'What's with the coleslaw??""   What they served was a tease. About two good mouth fulls. I wouldn't be complaining if it wasn't so good. Hey BJs - how about at least doubling the amount served with the sliders! Another Hefeweizen for me (damn it was good!) and one for Michele, and we were just about done.  Then came dessert - Triple Chocolate Pizookie made with some Ghirardelli chocolate. It is a chocolate cookie -(more like a thin brownie) made with chunks of Ghirardelli chocolate and topped with two scoops of double chocolate ice cream with Ghirardelli chocolate chips and a Ghirardelli dark chocolate square. The waitress was kind enough to bring me a small glass of the Stout to have with it. It was the perfect finish to a night out with my girlfriend.  And we still got home in time to watch Survivor."
Christina S.,"Oakland, CA",68,118,88,3.0,8/27/2012,"I don't know how to put this... I feel like BJs doesn't care about me.  This is the 10th time I've been here and it's always like somethings missing: literally.  If it's not one fork/napkin roll on a table for 2 people...or we're waiting to order drinks for 20 minutes or they've forgotten I ordered something...  I know why we keep coming back though: I like drinks, and my boyfriend likes this one sandwich. It's just a turkey club, but they put it on garlic bread. He loves it. So we have to come back. But even still, I'm constantly trying all the beers, drinks, and menu items, and he's getting the same thing he always orders: the verdict still stands. Not consistent. I've had 50% of my food be out of this world amazing, the other 50% sub par. All the drinks and their beers are great. But the service is really weak half the time, I thought that it was because it's always so busy there. Yesterday we came by for lunch and that's the time no one asked us for drinks until they took our whole order! Drinks, appetizers and entrees! I was like OMG if you bring them all out to us in 45 minutes I'm going to lose it. I need at least a glass of water RIGHT NOW."
Amanda Z.,"San Francisco, CA",2,41,22,4.0,12/10/2010,"Hostesses were a little off in their own world. I was standing there for about 5 minutes before she acknowledge me.  Our waitress was great!  Food was good (large portions). Drinks were made well.  There was three of us and the booth tables are a litttttle small, but I still enjoyed the experience and would definitely go again."
Barbara S.,"Concord, CA",0,18,33,2.0,1/19/2013,"The service is usually slow and mistakes by servers or the kitchen crew happen often.  The restrooms often need attention.  Parking is terrible.  Some of its servers apparently do not understand that it is not OK to run into occupied chairs or tables and that some sort of acknowledgement or apology is appropriate when they jostle a guest, especially when the guest is in the middle of eating or drinking something. BJ's uses an outside company to administer its frequent customer rewards program and this restaurant frequently fails to do what it needs to do to give guests the reward points they've earned for eating/drinking there.  When a guest notices the problem and complains, sometimes the restaurant fixes the mistake but it usually takes more than 10 minutes to do it.  Even worse, sometimes the management tries to blame it on the outside company and is not sincerely apologetic.  I think this restaurant is extremely lucky.  Much of its success is due to its prime location at the Sunvalley Mall. On the other hand, the steaks (when cooked to order) are usually superb, and many other selections are very nice.  It's great that servers always ask guests who order steaks to cut into the steaks in front of the servers to make sure the steaks are cooked correctly."
Juhwi K.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",27,39,11,5.0,11/28/2010,"Yes I know this is one of those chain restaurants but seriously my bf and I LOVE this place!!!! they got great selections of beer ( try their bjs hefeweizen!! its pretty darn good =) ) and for food I know they got similar menu like cheesecake factory - thick and too many selections ) but their small bites menu is cheap and delicious for party of two and just dont go for their deep dish lol you can only get good deep dish only in chicago but Bjs got pretty good thin bread pizza =)  and service wish depends on what time or what day you go if its really really busy you need to expect slow service but everytime we went, they were at least showing effort to keep our beer glass full =)"
Annette W.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",0,48,1,3.0,10/16/2013,I've been here a few times. The service is usually pretty good. The sandwiches are great. I also like their choices for salads. Portion size is large to say the least. I did try the Fish and Chips and that is one dish I would not recommend. Very greasy. Good atmosphere.
Brandi W.,"Walnut Creek, CA",589,541,625,1.0,10/6/2010,"Everything was way below my expectations.  The waiter seemed to be trying too hard to get a good tip. Strangely enough, he kept winking at me at the end of every sentence. I felt really uncomfortable and slightly creeped out, but I tried to ignore it.  The lunch specials are fairly cheap, but you get what you pay for. The soup was too salty, the Caesar salad was bland, and the pizza was just awful. The dough didn't seem to be cooked enough. It was the mini size, so I suppose I should feel lucky I didn't order the large. It arrived to the table lukewarm, and by the time I was halfway through it was cold, the cheese was rubbery, and I was not at all satisfied.  Maybe I'm just picky, but if I order pizza, I expect it to arrive at the table piping hot, almost to the point where it burns your mouth. If I wanted cold food, I would have ordered a cold entree.  The waiter didn't even refill my soda until we were done with our meal. What was the point of that?  If you want slow service and a sub-par meal, then this would be the place for you. The menu features about 2 pages of beer and yet another of booze. So almost half of the menu is just alcohol. Now I know why. Maybe if I had been drunk, I would have actually enjoyed my food."
Sam A.,"Benicia, CA",232,694,304,2.0,4/5/2011,"I do not get the allure of BJ's - I have been to this location twice and a different one once, and I just don't see it.  The food has been wildly mediocre. Sandwich, chicken strips, appetizers, pizza - none of it made me want to come back and have another.  Cool atmosphere, nice servers and friendly customer service, but food that makes me want to cook rather than go out."
Cindy N.,"Bay Area, CA",153,31,28,4.0,10/6/2010,"so i had my 21st birthday dinner here and i had reserved my birthday for 7:30pm the table wasn't even ready till 8:40pm that was like 50 min wait! i came in 10 min early just to tell them i was here but they still took hella long but i was fine with it in the end cause i guess it gave my guests to get acquainted with each other then when we finally sat down and my friends ordered some appetizers calamari which was pretty good which was $8.75 and the mozzarella sticks which i wasn't a big fan at the price $7.09 it was not worth it. Alex and Manny both had the hefeweizen they both liked it which was only $4.95 for good quality beer as all the guys told me which i wouldn't know since i never liked beer in the first place. My first drink of the night was PEACHY KEEN SANGRIA which was $5.75 this drink was really good it was made with Grey Goose L'Orange Vodka, Stoli Razberi Vodka, Beringer White Zinfandel, Monin white peach, pineapple and orange juices with a slash of grenadine which was in a pretty glass with a slice of orange and cherry i didn't expect it to be as strong as it would be cause i had a sangria at applebees and it tasted like juice to me. me and alex ordered a meduim great white pizza made with creamy Alfredo sauce with mushrooms, garlic, fresh Roma tomatoes, Parmesan cheese and grilled chicken breast which was hands down the best pizza ever bj's are famous for their deep dish pizza's they didn't have anymore medium great white so the waitress upgraded us to a large for the charge of a medium pizza wow super nice right?  my second drink was the strawberry confusion omg she spilled some on my dress but she was super sorry about it and got me some wet napkins and got me a new one this drink has to be my favorite drink of the night i downed it so quick it was made with Hpnotiq Liqueur, Stoli Razberi Vodka, pineapple juice and a splash of strawberry this drink was $8.50 i got 1 and a half glasses of this drink so i was happy! then she came out with my birthday pizoozkie and everyone started singing happy birthday to me aww and omg it was soo good it was right on point =) our bill came up to $185.89 and i had 12 people together at my dinner so it was 17% gratuity hehe i had such nice friends that dinner was on them i love them so much! overall it was all worth it and i would come back anytime!"
