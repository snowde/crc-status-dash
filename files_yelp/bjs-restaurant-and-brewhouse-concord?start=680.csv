Joe S.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",1,52,,2.0,8/31/2010,"I only had take out from this place and it was on someone else's dime so I can't comment on service or price. The ribs here is surprising good. Not the best ribs I had, but certainly not the worse. The pizza here sucks. Don't get it."
H. R.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",45,49,3,2.0,10/21/2010,"Food: Ok Drinks: Strong Biggest bone of contention... I ordered a drink, they were out of orange juice. Someone brought me a drink and told me it was the one i'd first tried to order. When i explained i was told there was no orange juice the gentleman said oh they must have found some.  I continue to take a few sips of this drink he brought me. The waitor comes back and says yea that wasn't your drink and TAKES IT AWAY!! At least give me the option of paying for it. He said he had to take it away. In my opinion if you mess up an order that's on your back, you never take away someone's food for your mistake.  I worked in the industry, that's how it should go!"
Sun E.,Bay Area,529,153,1,2.0,6/9/2010,"1.5 stars rounded up in their favor. This was a destination visit and holy crap... quite  a  letdown. The ambiance is spectacular. But that is where spectacular ends for me. Simply put...I feel it is overrated and overpriced as a whole. Service really needs a major overhaul... s l o o o o o w, inaccurate  and forgetful. Our visit was early lunch time; there were only a few tables of customers in the place. It took over 10 minutes to be acknowledged by the server. And by golly, service only went downhill from there. Our appetizer order was messed up miserably; it should have been comped but wasn't.  When the correct appetizer was finally served (after the meals), we were blown away by the poor  preparation of the potato skins. Toppings were incredibly sparse. Some skins had no cheese at all, others had no bacon... really sparse and lame for a spendy fee AND considering the order had originally been messed up by the server. Simply put- a huge ripoff. Boo. My salad cost $11.25 and was missing an ingredient. I couldn't tell the server because he didn't get to our table to check on us until we had almost finished our entrees. For $11.25, I had hoped for a HUGE salad...not. I was still hungry after finishing it.  Can't comment on the beers because we don't drink. If you haven't already guessed... nope, do not recommend."
Vicki E.,"Sacramento, CA",24,43,,2.0,8/22/2010,"I've eaten at this particular BJ's on a few occasions, however.. I must admit that I was greatly disappointed by the service we received this evening.   Server was polite, but once she took our order, she pretty much abandoned us for her other tables, which were getting much better service than we were. Food, as always, was wonderful."
Jeremy V.,"Hayward, CA",71,75,2,2.0,6/29/2011,"Overrated. The food is decent, but the service, price and waiting time is not worth the while. The prices are on the steep side of ""moderate."" I have a difficult time seeing coming here and having a genuinely enjoyable experience with my money and time. However, there are some positives. The positives include the actual selection of beers available. The sampler is often a good, fun choice and the pizookie is pretty good, as well. Otherwise, I can find similar styles of food, drinks, and better service at a smaller box restaurant like TGI Friday's, Chili's, or Applebee's at a slightly lower price, in addition to a more-comfortable feel to go with it, as BJ's is huge."
Patrick Gabriel L.,"San Ramon, CA",713,307,1246,3.0,3/10/2013,"Good location being adjoined to the mall is the redeeming factor. Service could have been better too. I like deep dish pizza, but I prefer Zachary's."
Jim L.,"Walnut Creek, CA",4,12,5,2.0,9/27/2013,"Food has always been ok, but the service has overall been poor. 3 of 4 times I ate there I can say the service was mediocre at best..I was in food service for 8 years myself and not impressed with the waitstaff."
Lance C.,"Citrus Heights, CA",33,54,1,4.0,7/26/2011,"We had a party of 7 eat lunch here today, we all had the rootbeer for a drink, i was not a big fan. for appatiser i had the stuffed mushrooms, they were tasty. my main course was the soup and salad, both were good the service was really good"
Natasha A.,"Vallejo, CA",80,39,2,2.0,4/4/2011,"This place seems to get worse and worse with each visit.  The first time I went here was when it first opened. The service was just ""ok"" and the food was decent. I figured that since the place was new, they were still trying to get their act together.  I have been there a few times since, and each time my experience seemed to be worse then the one before. The quality of their food has gone way down hill. Their sandwich combos are a joke. Sub-par sandwiches that I could have made better at home, and salads that are just soggy and wilted. Their soups have always been either too bland or too salty, and tasted as if they came straight out of a can. Their pizzas have also gone down hill. They are sloppily made, and have considerably less am mount of toppings then when they first opened (I know times are tough and places are trying to cut back, but skimping on pizza toppings to save a few pennies is not the way to do it.)  They last time we went, I decided to order a bunch of the ""small bite"" items to share with the table. At $4 - $6 a pop, I thought these would be good appetizer sized items that we can munch of while drinking a beer. These ""small bites"" were literally 3 or 4 bites each. I ordered the friend artichokes (awful tasting and overly greasy), and mozzarella salad (looked like a small mound of shredded cheese in brown sauce, and only have a few actual pieces of cheese in it) and the bruschetta (4 small sad pieces of cold bread with a couple chucks of tomato on top.) The items were so sad and pitiful looking, and they tasted so bland and awful, I should have just saved my money and used it to buy another beer.  The only good this this place has going for it is that they have a wide selection of beers. Other then that, the food is horrible, and their service is slow, and even for the moderately prices menu I would not even waste my money on the food.  I'll only go here again is my friends really want to go there (and if they pay for me) but other then that, there are many more places with better food to go to."
A. L.,"Dublin, CA",42,78,14,5.0,7/21/2012,"BJ's in Newark received 3 stars from me. Same food here. Better service. I live in the Easy Bay and my boyfriend and I drive all the way up here because their service has NEVER disappointed us. And they never question my cheese-free, gluten-free pizza orders ;) Food always gets delivered quickly and the servers are exceptionally awesome. I never get names, but we've had a fabulous server (and take out specialists) each time we go. Recommend this BJ's all the way! :)"
Maria T.,"Alameda, CA",1,6,,2.0,3/8/2012,It's alright! not all that maybe only go there during lunch next time waiting FOREVER for a table for 4  place was nice felt bad for our waitress every drink we ordered she came back to apologize that they ran out of this or that to make the drinks..  so..My food was alright ordered the Thai salmon Eh i could of made it better my wifes food and my kids food looked better than mine desert was probably the only thing I was happy about there...Oh not to mention the creepy girl that walked in with booty shorts and a tank top it's almost 10 pm cold as heck outside and she is just wondering around all creepy standing in front of peoples tables staring ( mind you no one even bothered to kick her out )  so this place was alright I guess..Might go back but def not a fave of mine
Michelle L.,"Concord, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/26/2010,Lets start off with how terrible the hostesses are. They all sat around and did absolutely NOTHING while they all bossed one girl around that sat us to our table. Seems like they were more interested in criticizing everyone else than doing their job. There was one hostess that was nice and did her job correct but after being disheveled by the previous hostesses i was already upset and shut this one out.  Server: TERRIBLE! Just as dramatic as the hostesses. Luckily i got the name. Sarah i believe it was. I came in with a big party and asked to split the bill. She split it in a way that was so inconvenient for me! Luckily i gottospeak with the manager. I could complain forever. Overall not a good experience.
Chira E.,"Concord, CA",185,313,30,4.0,9/27/2012,"Personally, I don't think there is much to be said about chain restaurants.     Mediocre food, and basic service is what I have grown to expect.  After a fiasco at a so called ""M.A.C launch"" (another review, another time) my friend and I decided to spend time sipping on a glass of Cab at BJ's rather than standing in a horrendous line.  The stars were aligned because we sat at the bar, and we were informed by the courteous bartender that all wine was half off on Tuesday!  Word?!!?  So not only was the wine half off; being the dutiful Yelp checker inner that I am, I realized that there was a special ( not on the menu, only privy information for us Yelpers).  The special included two salads of your choice, medium pizza of your choice, and dessert pizza of your choice for...wait for it....$19.99!  Word!??! I am quite discriminating when it comes to my pizza, and this pizza was quite good with an excellent crust.  BJ's you are all right with me."
Steve K.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",27,545,21,4.0,2/25/2011,"BJ's has always been a favorite... So, where to start? How about the Happy Hour half-price mini-pizzas (bar only)... Or the nice selection of Belgian beers? Or the fantastic deep-dish pizzas and home-style dishes like meatloaf, fried chicken, and pot roast? And, of course, the famous Pizookie dessert... I'd say you almost cannot go wrong with any of the food here. Their own beers are not bad, but they also have a very nice selection of liquors at the tall, full bar, and plenty of TV's to watch if there's a game on. You won't be disappointed with the food and drinks here"
Telzey G.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",15,172,23,1.0,3/23/2013,"All around bad...actually our server himself was very nice, it is just that everything was so slow. We had to ask for silverware 3 times and the cobb salad was terrible. Won't be back. I spent too much of my very precious time sitting and waiting. Also, if you sit outside, the ""smoking"" area is RIGHT next to the outdoor patio...so I smelled gross smoke the whole time."
Grace C.,"Martinez, CA",28,16,1,4.0,9/17/2012,My husband and I went here on Sunday to watch the 49ers game.  We got the party for two which was a great deal!  We ended up waiting for over 40 min for our pizza. The manager came over and said that he would take care of our meal because we had been waiting so long.  We never even said anything but the manager was really paying attention to the customers.
John Y.,"San Ramon, CA",1,179,50,2.0,10/17/2010,"Been here 3 times and wanted to like it more.  Especially with the prices, I want to like it more.   First off, the atmosphere is nice.  Kind of like an Elephant Bar/PF Changs/Cheescake Factory type of place.  It's like an upscale Applebees.  The waitstaff is almost all the early 20's, 1st or 2nd job out of high school type.  That also seems to be their target audience.  Young, college-age or young family types.  The restaurants are very clean and everything is new.  So, that's very nice. The service is o.k.  Being that their audience is the young crowd, the waitstaff is also very young and maybe not so attentive/experienced, the way you would like.  Our service has been o.k. overall.  But, my most recent experience was that it took a very, very long time to get our food.  When the food did finally start coming, the orders were wrong and the food was cold.   The food.  This is where this place fails miserably.  They DO have generous helpings.  Just about everything sets you up for a nice meal.  The atmosphere, the prices, the niceness.  Everything is just o.k.  I wouldn't mind if the prices were less or the 'expectations' were less.  My burger, was not cooked right/overdone.  (I asked for medium rare).  But, o.k. no biggie.  It was lukewarm.  It wasn't juicy at all.  Not much in the way of condiments on the burger either.  A simple mid-level burger and they messed up!  I'd rather pay a lot less, get it faster, get it better at In N Out!!!  I hate to be so harsh.   The previous times I've been here, I never really liked it either.  Just o.k.  Nothing to write home about.     One good thing, is that they have a lot of beers on tap and they have a full bar.  So, I think their audience is well served.  Just don't go for the food."
Giacomo S.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",364,13,2,2.0,7/4/2013,"You know, the beer selection is great. The food is okay, but the service....they try. It just seems when I come in for dinner and wait for a seat in the dining room, they keep you waiting..just very slow service. When you are at the bar, the service is much quicker. This past visit, they just forgot about us, apps out in 30 minutes, dinner, fries cold, not out at the same time and incomplete order. Server was a nice kid, but overwhelmed with the way the sections are setup in the dining room. I would expect better service for the price. Never saw a manager either."
Jen G.,"Oakland, CA",53,102,92,3.0,3/5/2013,I love BJ's!!!! I have been to 3 locations and I always enjoy the beer. Either the Blonde or the Hef.  I usually get the artichoke/Spinach deep dish pizza. It is so good! But this time I was feeling a burger since I only eat them about twice a year.  I ordered the Spicy Jalapeno Burger and it was definitely lacking.  There were only 3 little jalapenos under the bun and the secret sauce they used was a mere squirt.  I had to ask for extra sauce. I probably wouldn't order that again.  Id go back to the deep dish or a salad.  My boyfriend loved the Jeremiah Red and even bought a few 22oz bottles to go:) even though the burger was meh.....we will be back if we get hungry while at that mall.
Helen K.,"Lafayette, CA",74,378,37,1.0,5/12/2010,"S L O W  service B A D food. Good only for drinks but the acoustics are off. The place is cavernous and packed. I can overlook a lot when the staff tries hard (and they really do), but even they could not save this disaster of a dinner. Strike three, BJ's you're out!"
