M. W.,"San Francisco, CA",33,30,3,2.0,8/19/2013,"Too long wait to be seated, too long wait for just two kid's meal and one adult dish.  (We waited 45 minutes for that.)  The food was not that delicious either.  I wonder if it is because they are short staffed in the kitchen, or short staffed on the floor.  I suspect it is both."
Angelica B.,"Concord, CA",11,85,15,2.0,3/29/2013,"We stopped coming here a couple of years ago due to the slow service. We went back tonight and the service was slow. The deep dish pizza, kids meals, salad and chowder and pizookie were good."
Kymberli C.,"Clayton, CA",136,1486,5781,3.0,4/30/2010,"I used to LOVE eating at BJ's before they opened this location.  Maybe it's lost its excitement because it's so close to home or maybe it's just this location but It just doesn't have its appeal anymore.  The two times that I've eaten here, I got bad tummy aches following.  I will come back when I am craving a pizookie."
Rebecca P.,"Concord, CA",1,1,,1.0,11/19/2012,"Service was slow, the pizza was under cooked, and when we ordered an appetizer it came out with the dinner food I wouldn't recommend going here"
Ann D.,"Moreno Valley, CA",17,64,7,5.0,10/19/2013,"Love it! My husband always wants to come here for the Cookies and Cream Pizookie or the white chocolate macadamia  Pizookie. I in the other hand come here for the Alcoholic drinks, last time we came they had some sparkling strawberry lemonade with some alcohol. It was really good but not too strong. Food is also delicious like the calamari or avocado rolls. yumm!"
SANDY M.,"Concord, CA",13,89,,2.0,5/18/2010,"This review is based on the pizza!!  I had high expectations about their pizza, cus its deep dish! Sorry to say but mann....it was so dry! Very disappointing!"
Denia S.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",0,40,,2.0,6/22/2012,"Hostess stuck up and rude today at our 11:15 lunch and had us wait even though there was no one in there.  Service was good in the beginning, only because they want you to order and turn the table over.  Our waitress pretty much harassed us into ordering and her comment everytime was ""have you made your selection yet?""  I mean, seriously??  And after thanking her she would say  ""my pleasure"", once or twice with that was enough already.  After we ordered our waitress was no where to be found.  Had to ask for ketchup, refills, the check, and then she never came back for the credit card so I slammed two $20s in there and left.  Very stuck up attitude in there with their workers.  Yes, you are workers!! Food was excellent, though, so too bad about the crappy service.  Clam chowder was excellent and so were our sandwiches.  I'd like to go back but I am big on service so probably won't return."
D C.,"San Francisco, CA",15,308,177,1.0,6/3/2012,"Service is just awful, and not sure why this is generating so much business.  It's just another Cheese Cake Factory but without the cheese cake"
Adriel H.,"Danville, CA",281,108,9,4.0,7/22/2010,"Great lively atmosphere with a layout that makes it feel spacious, yet cozy at the same time.  Plenty of seating indoor and outdoor, but there is usually a lot of people which is always a good sign.  Plenty of televisions showing a variety of sports.  Service is decent and up to par if not better with other joint semi classy restaurant chains (up to par with elephant bar, P.F. Changs; better than cheesecake factory service) Onto the food, THE go to spot for authentic deep dish chicago styled pizza in the east bay.  The crust is a near perfect blend of chewy goodness yet crispy on the edges.  The pizzas are flavorful with unique combinations.  The root beer is of above par quality, where it is rich and creamy and authentic compared to sodas, these are far superb.  The Bizookies for dessert are delicious!  Scoops of ice cream over a warm chewy fresh cookie.   Definitely come by here if you want quality deep dish pizza and root beer!  Plenty of parking in the Great Mall lot.  Good for large group semi formal celebrations to a casual date with a friend."
byron s.,"Concord, CA",0,5,,2.0,6/13/2010,"Pros:  Unlimited refills on house soda. 5+ toppings priced as 4 toppings. Cons: Doesn't fully cook their Pizookies (repeatedly) Occasionally slow service To Go orders undercooked and soggy Dark When you order a pizookie, make sure you tell them to cook it longer. They reliably undercook the pizookie, so that it is the consistency of dough. The edges are crispy, but the whole of the center is a gummy mess.  Cookie dough is good, but warm? It doesn't taste good, and after the second time of sending the undercooked order to be rectified, it had better be frickin cooked. Pizookies taste great when properly cooked. The problem is, properly cooked pizookies are becoming a significant rarity."
Rebecca P.,"Pittsburg, CA",0,5,1,4.0,1/3/2014,I love their happy hour... specially at night service is good but food might take a little long sometimes and their pozookie is just great
Craig K.,"Brentwood, CA",11,63,1,4.0,7/13/2010,"First time visit, Tuesday at 11:30 for lunch.  Not too busy, service was very attentive and food was served quickly. Lunch menu pricing is great, and portion sizes were just right. The Tomato Bisque with Grilled Ham and Cheese was terrific, and so was the Triple Chocolate Pizookie.  House brewed root beer was nothing special. Henry Weinhardts Private Reserve Root Beer is much better, and should be the gold standard to which all other Root Beers, especially home brews, strive to be. Will definitely try BJ's Brewhouse again."
Mrs. M.,"Concord, CA",9,6,,2.0,7/14/2013,"We have been to BJ's several times.  The food has always been good and, until today, the service was good.  Tonight (7:00 pm) the service was horrible!  We waited a long time until the waitress took our drink orders.  No explanation.  I asked for ice tea with lemon, to start.  I received no lemon until I asked three different people.  No sugar, no straws, again until I asked someone else.  Our waitress kept on mysteriously disappearing.  When our salads arrived, I had to ask for silverware.  The food was good, but the wait was silly.  Again, no waitress.  When she brought our bill, we put our card out right away.  Yes, again, she disappeared.  I had to bring the check up to the main desk to have it run up because I had no idea where the disappearing waitress was.  When the bill to be signed FINALLY arrived, no explanation.  I did tell the front desk.  They apologized, but honestly, someone needs to wake that waitress up!  Everyone else was doing her job! No tip for her, either."
Jessica K.,"Hayward, CA",0,6,1,1.0,9/28/2013,"There was a CHOCOLATE CHIP on my pizza crust.. I will NEVER come back to this place. I am beyond disgusted. Now I would like to add the manager did try to rectify the situation by giving a complimentary soup and by bringing out another pizza but for this to even have happened in the first place?! eewww I now rank them right along side Applebee's... This is my 5th time coming here and I have had problem 3 out of the 5 times... Save yourself and don't eat here, maybe just grab a beer"
rebecca f.,"Pittsburg, CA",66,19,1,4.0,8/28/2012,"Mmmmm. Love coming here. Great place for a date night Or girls night out. Hey i even took my Mom here on mothers day and had a good time. It can get really busy especially on the weekends, but i believe you can call ahead and reserve which is a plus. They also offer take out which is excellent considering they're food is delicious. Appetizers are cheap and yummy. A lot of there drinks are signature drinks created by Bj's employes from all over. Cool, I know. Any ways i like Bj's especially this location and will continue coming here for good food and a wonderful atmosphere."
Marakia R.,"Berkeley, CA",87,119,2,4.0,2/13/2013,All I come for is the black and bleu burger and the heff. PERIOD
Sophie S.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",0,4,,2.0,12/29/2014,Everytime I go here I complain. The food is just so BLEH and PLAIN. Nothing special about it all. Will not be going back.
E. Y. G.,"Pinole, CA",90,205,64,1.0,3/31/2010,"Went back this weekend and my kid got super sick after eating here.  Something funny about their fries....they tasted like fish and onion. Maybe old oil? Is it common practice to fry fish in the same area as the ""veggie"" items? AND...my ""deep dish pizza"" was just fluffy bread with a like coating of toppings. WTF?"
Gary M.,"Concord, CA",3,5,,4.0,9/13/2013,"I always eat in the bar area and have fast and efficient service.  The food is always excellent and comes out hot and at the appropriate time, like after the apetizer.  Love going and watch the sporting events on the TV."
Christina J.,"Walnut Creek, CA",4,28,8,2.0,4/23/2013,"I've been here a hand full of times and each was a different experience in terms of service. Sometimes we have great service, sometimes it's okay and sometimes I feel like I need to stand up and wave my arms around to get the attention of the waitstaff. This wouldn't be my choice of place to go to eat dinner however, my friends and I used to come here for happy hour. I've sat both at the bar and in the main dining area. The food is okay, nothing special. We've tried a variety of different foods and nothing stands out and spectacular. I wouldn't come here unless someone else decided they really wanted to and invited me, even then I'd have to think about it."
