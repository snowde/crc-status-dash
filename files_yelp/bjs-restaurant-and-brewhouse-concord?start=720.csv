Maria G.,"San Pablo, CA",99,6,2,2.0,8/19/2013,Food was good service was sub par. Lighting inside was horrible might be to hide some things? I've been here various times so this isn't a bad experience review but 1 time did force me to come here and vent. Lets just say they need new management and a bit more thurough hiring process.
Rachel B.,"Hayward, CA",122,684,111,1.0,6/26/2012,"Disgusting microwaved, super salty processed food. Even a monkey could cook better at home."
Bob H.,"Payette, ID",0,11,,3.0,11/9/2013,"Are here yesterday evening.  We did the pick up.  I had burger and fries.  Good meat, a little under cooked. That is why I give it a three star.  The wedge friends were great. My nephew had the Salmon, and it was very good.   I have had steaks here that were very good, but I didn't enjoy the salad that came with it.  It  a busy place for dine in or take out, but can be noisy too."
Melissa J.,"El Sobrante, CA",1,37,1,4.0,2/7/2013,"My husband and I love the appetizers here.  We usually get the spinach and artichoke dip, egg rolls and the potato skins.  Always delicious.  BJ's is usually busy and it has a lively atmosphere.  The best place for service is at the bar.  When my husband and I eat in the restaurant area we have to wait an unusually a long time before we are asked what we want to drink and what to order.  One time, a girl who was there seeing her boyfriend (her boyfriend worked there) had him wait on us because after 20 minutes or server never came.  Granted this extreme happened once, we usually do have to wait a while before we are given service."
Alex M.,"Oakland, CA",0,42,,2.0,3/14/2014,"I was super excited to eat at BJ's in Concord because I had a blast at the one down in LA, but I ended up being super disappointed here. I'm not sure if the food is prepared differently for happy hour or not.. we arrived in time for it. Every food item we ordered from the happy hour menu was greasy. The avocado rolls I have been craving forever were badly made with old avacados. The chips that came with the artichoke dip were stale. The pizza was ehh. Food would have been okay if I was plastered.. which brings us to the best part of the night- alcohol! The drinks during happy hour are good; 5 bucks for a decent mint mojito and 4.50 for any craft beer. Yiss."
Justin M.,"San Francisco, CA",1,7,,5.0,9/19/2010,"Been to this location numerous time for happy hour and dinner. Great service and food every time. During happy hour I usually just order an appetizers  and drinks with friends with friends. The appetizers are $2.00 off regular price, which usually comes  out to $6.50ish. I wish that happy hour prices were half off like other places. I recommend getting the nachos and the spinach dip. They serve you a large amount and they are very good. Tried the calamari and the chicken lettuce wrap and they  were just alright. For dinner the deep dish pizza are a must. Ive tried the bbq chicken pizza and it is my favorite one. The sauce was not too sweet or tangy, just right. Then the chicken was perfect and not over cooked. The only other pizza i've tried is the Mediterranean. This pizza was alright. I a little too salty for my taste. Toppings include pest, roasted garlic and sun dried tomatoes. For desert I get a pizookie. They give you the options for different kinds of cookie and to go half and half. I look forward to this every time I got to BJ's The service has always been great at this location, whether I am eating during happy hour or dinner. The hostess and servers are very friendly and always have  great smiles. It doesn't look like they hate their jobs or are waiting to get off shift. One time our server forgot one of our appetizers and our pizza came out before it had. She asked us if we still would like the dish but we declined. Couldn't fault her, it looked like a busy night and it happens. No complaints from us or anything. The manager came up to us and apologized for the mistake and gave us the appetizer anyways, for free. This was soooo legit. Great food at every bj's location, but what makes this one my favorite is the proximity to the mall and the great service. I will continue to come to this location and eat great food."
Heather L.,"Benicia, CA",4,48,,4.0,7/23/2011,"Ate lunch here today. One thing I don't understnad is why the don't offer a lunch menu on the weekends. They said because most people have more time on weekends and the food on the lunch menu is designed to be made quickly. OK, but what about the poeple that don't eat those huge portions. SHe ended up letting me get a weekend lunch item. Which was very nice of her.  Salad was good. BJ's is like an Applebees, but a little better. A good place overall for lunch. Drinks were quick, food didn't take long at all. Server had a smile on her face always friendly."
Mitra W.,"Concord, CA",59,227,115,3.0,5/29/2010,"Great beer and wine selection. Lot's to choose from (food). Nutritional information for EVERY dish in the back of menu. Customer service is hit or miss.  Have had slow service when it was dead and fast service when it was packed.  Never can tell.  Mostly, everyone has been friendly. Prices are reasonable. Have had: Thai Style lettuce wraps-just OK Chicken Pot Stickers-YUMMY Ahi and Avocado Poke salad-Not bad at all BBQ Pulled Pork sando-SLAMMIN"
Peggy N.,"Antioch, CA",240,324,3,5.0,1/5/2010,"Now...let's get one thing clear.  I LOVE me a good BJ, however, my event at the Lodi BJ's left a bad taste in my mouth.   ahhh... *smirk* The BJ's in Concord has redeemed my love of them and I'm here to give some lip therapy on my visit! I pouted about having to attend my husbands Christmas/Winter Solstace/Kwanzaa/Hanukkah dinner here.  But I went because..well, he is my husband....and he promised to take me to Vinnie's afterward for a real drink.  (score) We arrive, we are greeted and we are seated.  Everyone orders a drink from very polite waitresses and we make small talk.  The drinks arrive and I'm completely in heaven! They were good and strong just like I like 'em!  Nothing else mattered from that point on because I was happy to have a great drink at a chain restaurant.  My honey and I shared a sandwich and fries cuz I was full of booze (go figure) and not very hungry - from what I remember the sanwich was good. All in all I left impressed: from the service, to the bar to the food. As a bonus we left buzzed but walked it off with some last minute holiday shopping at the mall.  As a bonus to that bonus, I did not have to run across town to Vinnies for a real drink. I'm happy to know we have great BJ's right here in Concord!"
colleen r.,"Martinez, CA",23,27,4,1.0,4/3/2010,"Some friends and I went here recently, and sorry I don't see what the big deal is. The food is lacking in quality, noisy and everyone and their brother in here. Why?  I have no clue. I had the pot roast and it was terrible.   The service was fine, but waiting in line to eat this crappy food is crazy.  If you want some good food try Stanfords and WC.  The ribs are terrific, they have flavor and the place has atmosphere.  Unlike this dump. Run, run quickly away."
Bill B.,"Martinez, CA",2,60,2,3.0,7/6/2011,"This place is OK, but I'm not a huge fan of it.  Service was quick and attentive, and they were quickly able to accommodate the large-ish group we brought along.  Food was good, although the beef dishes tended to be overcooked. Their ""Rare"" is ""Medium"" everywhere else. Appetizers are tasty and generous in portion. Prices are fair. The beer is again good but not great. Atmosphere is crowded and noisy. Not good for a date, but if you have an after event crowd to feed, you could do worse. I hate writing middle of the road reviews but BJ's just stays right there in all respects.  Go. You won't regret it, but you wont be cheering in the aisles either."
Lani P.,"American Canyon, CA",13,3,10,2.0,1/11/2010,"Our latest visit to BJ's was a very disappointing one.  Our server, while mildly polite, was horrible.  Her name is Natalie.  We ordered 6 sodas, only 3 of which had straws.  Upon requesting more straws, she sarcastically said, ""I don't have straws with me, but I can bring you some.""  She never did.  We had to flag down the hostess who then brought us straws. She then gave us a stack of small plates for our appetizers at the end of the table.  When we started passing them out, we noticed that several of them were dirty on the bottoms, with chocolate or BBQ sauce, which got all over our hands.  Upon telling her about this, she said, ""It's probably just chocolate sauce.  I'll bring you some clean ones.""  She did not apologize at all for the dirty plates, and when we requested wet wipes for our hands, she said that you did not have those.  Which was confusing, because on another occasion at BJ's, we thought we remembered receiving wet wipes with our buffalo wings or rib orders? Our food took a very long time to come.  Throughout our meal she did not come back to check on us, or notice that we had many dirty plates and glasses to taken away and/or refilled.  While we were there, the couple across the way from us were seated and ignored by her, so they ended up leaving without ordering. At the beginning of our visit, we mentioned that we had a birthday at our table and she patronizingly said Happy Birthday to my son.  It wasn't until my mother-in-law inquired again before we left about something for the birthday boy, that she said that he does get a dessert.  I don't believe she would've mentioned that if we didn't ask. We had been excited about going to BJ's this visit, however, the experience was really bad.  While we did leave Natalie a tip, it wasn't nearly what she would've received if she had actually taken care of us.  In fact, it was probably still more than she deserved."
Adam Z.,"Concord, CA",65,18,,4.0,11/19/2010,"Some really great beers with some good food.  The pizza's are huge.  I'm a deep dish fan and these don't disappoint.  The BBQ chicken is great.  The appetizers are one of a kind.  Try the sampler, it's got a variety that you can't get at too many places.  The service is a little slow.  But I've never been in a hurry here.  Just give me a Jeremiah Red or a Nutty Brewnette and I'm set.  Those 2 are my favorite beers.  The wheat is decent and their holiday pumpkin ale was awesome.  The place is decked out with TV's and sports all day long.  I loved going on Saturday's for college football.  A different game on all the TV's.  Not too loud and fairly comfortable seating.  Bartenders are knowledgeable and they get to know you.  Wait staff is nice and talkative."
Krystal A.,"Martinez, CA",1,13,7,1.0,8/23/2014,"Me and 5 of my friends went to the BJ's in concord last night and we literally had the WORST service EVER! If I could give 0 stars, I would. First off, we called about 40 minutes prior to us arriving for their call ahead seating for up to 6 people in your party. When we arrived at 8pm we told the host that we did the call ahead seating and stated the name is was under, they could not find my friends name that she put it under. Then they continued to explain to us that our wait time starts when we arrive, I asked what's the point of call ahead seating then and she said that she thinks calls ahead seating should only be for parties of 5 and under. So then, we waited our 30 minutes to be seated and then waiting about another 10 minutes before anyone greeted us. When our server greeted us he took our drink order right away, but then didn't see him for about 20 minutes. When he arrived with our drinks he then stated that he forgot to ring in one of my friends drinks from the bar, well we all already knew how long their drinks from the bar take so needless to say my friend was bummed that he was going to have to wait another 20 minutes to get his drink. After we got our 1st round of drinks he never asked us if we were ready to order or anything, he just dropped our drinks and left, he came back about 15 minutes later and took our order for our dinner (this is around 930pm, we've been at our table for an hour before he took our dinner order). At the time he took our dinner order we all ordered another round of drinks. It took probably 30 minutes for us to get our dinner and when it arrived, my friend ordered a large pizza and my boyfriend ordered a small pizza, the guy who brought our pizzas didn't say watch your hands, hot plates, no he just slid the hot pizza pans across he table and almost burnt my boyfriends hand if he didn't move it on time. Then it took about another 15 minutes for us to get our drinks and this time he OVER ordered drinks, some of us didn't want another round and I even had a non alcoholic drink and I never got another one. Lets just say our server was VERY overwhelmed and desperately needed help with his tables. When it came time for our bill to come he just dropped it and walked away, I numbered everything 1,2, 3 (there was 3 couples) and told him to just split everything with the numbers on the side of what was ordered, he then said ""I will try, but its going to take while to do this for you"" ... If I already numbered everything for you it shouldn't take that long. 15 minutes later he comes and just gives everyone a receipt with no booklet and he STILL got things wrong and put other peoples items on eachothers checks! We got there at 8pm and left at 11pm!! I have never had that bad of service ever! I just couldn't believe it, I will probably not be going back to that BJ's"
Janet J.,"Clayton, CA",10,24,,3.0,1/30/2013,"I thought the food was delicious, but the service was way too slow."
sharlyn g.,"San Leandro, CA",50,143,87,4.0,10/7/2010,"I love Bj's  I hate going to the one in Newark though, because its soooo crowded ALL the time. Concord, on the other hand is busy but little to no wait for smaller parties.  The service is always great , the food is good, and the Beer selection is WONDERFUL.  a great place to unwind, and spend time with friends. =)"
Michael L.,"Benicia, CA",91,189,17,4.0,1/26/2013,"Been here many times. Despite bringing me the wrong dish tonight, the server, Sandy, was superb. Won't order the flat bread pizza again, sausage was way processed, and not a bit over warm. Then pulled pork was outstanding as always, I am a regular here, highly recommended"
R T.,"San Jose, CA",4,107,3,3.0,3/3/2010,"Last night was my first experience at BJ's, and it was super mediocre-- meaning nothing special. If it wasn't for our co-worker reunion, it probably would have been a terrible night. I ordered two Long Island Iced Teas, and it was too watered down (didn't taste the alcohol whatsoever). I was no where near buzzin'... but eh, what can you expect from a restaurant/bar? Not much, I suppose.  The food was so-so as well. My pasta, Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo was quite dry. Not to mention the pasta itself was still hard! The service was horrible. Our waitress mentioned she had another big party like ours, but I guess she was more attentive on the other table... I don't mean to put you on blast, but our waitress, Mallory was horrible. She was rude, and rushing to kick us out when we were still eating our dinner asking if we wanted dessert. C'mon now! She's quite entertaining though, but that's about it. The automatic 17% gratuity isn't what you deserve.  Trust me on this one, because our co-worker reunion was from a restaurant we all previously worked for. Been there, done that. Take some constructive criticism if you do happen to read this."
Jonathan R.,"San Francisco, CA",693,47,4,2.0,6/13/2011,"I had heard so many great things about BJ's that I couldn't wait to go and try out their signature burger and their Ultimate Long Island.  But there were too many things wrong with my experience: Strike 1: I tried their signature BJ's Burger with additional bacon, and the sandwich is served on a toasted garlic french roll instead of a traditional hamburger bun.  Oddly enough, I didn't taste any garlic at all while biting into the roll.  I had asked for my burger to be cooked medium-rare, and it was served medium-well.  (At least the wedge-cut seasoned fries made up for the burger's lack of flavor and juiciness!) Strike 2: I was a bit disappointed in their Ultimate Long Island Iced Tea.  It was watered down and had a dark amber color instead of the light blond color it should have.  Lo and behold, with my first sip, my taste buds were assaulted with the sweet taste of PEPSI instead of the signature Coke.  It also had notes of orange and other things that I do not believe should be in anything called a Long Island.  (After drinking it, I looked up the ingredients online and realized that it is created with vodka, gin, rum, orange liquer, sweet & sour and Pepsi instead of the classic vodka, tequila, rum, gin, triple sec, sweet & sour, and Coke.)  The mixture they serve is definitely NOT recommended. Strike 3: The area in which we were seated was facing a window at sunset.  As the sun set behind the building, it suddenly came into view and the waitstaff could not adjust the blinds in any fashion to prevent the searing white light from blinding us as we ate.  Apparently, part of the blinds above the window cannot be adjusted. Anyway, the burger and the ""Long Island"" cost me $30.  I guess the only good thing was that the Dallas Mavericks won the NBA championship while I was there! NOTE: The floors are extremely slippery, so make sure you are wearing a decent pair of non-slip tennis shoes or boots that are made with recycled radial tires.  Don't say I didn't warn you."
Linda M.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",394,604,61,3.0,11/27/2009,"This type of restaurant isn't my thing, but loving 2 guys that *live* sports, we thought we'd check it out. I kept thinking Outback (with more focus on pizza and sandwiches over red meat). My guys were happy with all the sports on big screens, as was my son's picky eater friend with his meal, and I enjoyed the red beer. The service, though slow at times, was better than McCovey's, which has a similar sports bar vibe.  We were prepared for a long wait, but were pleasantly surprised when the quoted 45 minutes was really more like 20. Plus they brought pizza slices around to give to patrons waiting for tables. Once we were seated, drinks and salad came quickly. Main entrees took quite a while. We'd been warned about big portions, so hubby and I split the roast beef dip which came with a huge mountain of fries (choose thin and crispy or wedge). The sandwich itself wasn't anything to write home about and was much more bread than meat. Luckily, we'd added the wedge salad (also to split), which was, again nothing special.  The kids meals came with drinks (although we had to ask for a lemonade to be removed from the bill and point out to the server that it was one of the drinks listed on the kids menu). Also they serve those nasty reconstituted happy face potatoes, which the kids didn't love. They should just use the fries they serve adults. You can add a good-sized kid's sundae for 95 cents.  The kids were excited about their specialty ice cream on cookie dessert, the pizookie...so we ordered a ""trio"" which offered 3 mini versions of it with your choice of flavors. Of course they ran out of cookies and cream (aka oreo), so both kids had to go with their 2nd choice flavor. Dessert took so long to come that we later joked they must have been baking them individually with a light bulb, easy bake oven style. The cookie part you had to dig out of a little metal pan.  I'd have preferred just a regular old brownie with ice cream to the triple chocolate version I tried.  Food gets two stars, +1 for good beer, friendly (but slow) service and entertaining for my guys.  Next time I'll probably try a burger."
