Meena P.,"Concord, CA",2,61,,1.0,5/22/2012,"So this place has steadily gone down hill!  Hubby and i went for dinner on a Friday night a week ago. I use to love BJ's restaurant. So it being a Friday night, it was plenty busy but we didn't have to wait long for a table. It took forever for our waitress to come to us. She said she was swamped as they had just sat 3 tables in her area and she already had a full house.  Ok, no problem. We ordered a cesear's salad, large veggie pizza and drinks. So this time since we had so much time while waiting for service, I started reading the menu. I read that the veggie pizza comes on their whole wheat crust - Aha!  The previous time we came here I asked my server if our pizza was on whole wheat crust (again it was a veggie) and he assured us that it was not. I had my doubt as it tasted sweet and not like the usual crust.  So, now after reading the menu I realized that our last waiter did lie to us about the crust.  So this time I made sure to request the white crust.  I find the whole wheat crust quite gross, it's so sweet and pizza crust in my opinion should not be sweet! Anyway, we got our salad and it was half the size it normally is so I asked the waitress if they had changed their portions and she said no that this was a side salad. Hubby and I were sharing the salad but the portion turned out to be fine. We got our pizza and it was ugly. It literally looked like the chef (and I use that term loosely) had just thrown our toppings on the pizza, not only that it looked like in the cutting they first cut it wrong and then tried to correct it. It was the ugliest pizza. there were areas without sauce or toppings just cheese.   I should have complained to the waitress but we barely got any service. I will definitely not be returning to this BJ's restaurant.  I have been to other locations and was satisfied with them.  I had written a note to the customer service contact form on their website and have yet to have anyone contact me.  It was such a disappointing experience!"
Melissa R.,"Patterson, CA",0,2,,5.0,6/16/2012,"I've been to BJ's before for prom with a bunch of my classmates and we had the set menu with the pasta and pizza, but this time I went I had a different experience. I got to order off the menu for the first time. My aunt actually ordered the California flat bread as an appetizer, it was to die for! It is a must get! When it was time to order I ordered the lunch pasta and salad. I chose the Alfredo fettuccine with chicken.  First came the salad and I wish it had more dressing but thats just me I like a lot. Then came my meal it was the perfect size amount for me. It is smaller than the actual dinner size. It also came with two garlic cheesy bread sticks and it was amazing!"
Ruth R.,"Vallejo, CA",32,149,13,4.0,12/10/2009,"I called a day in advance with a reservation for 8-10 people at 6:00pm. Coming from an event in Oakland just after 5pm, we got stuck in traffic, so I did as they asked and called to notify them of my tardiness. We arrived at exactly 6:30PM, and we were told we had to wait. We waited for nearly 45 minutes. Our first dish came out at 8:08pm, which by that time, my friend had to leave to go to work. Everything was good, worth it the price, but that wait after reserving and calling was inexcusable. When we asked why we had to wait, they explained to us the whole process of what making a reservation meant, which is a little different from other places. I would not have been so disappointed if they had explained that over the phone when I called. If I had known, I probably would have made reservations elsewhere.  Nonetheless, foods still great, service was great, the wait/reservation process needs some work."
Virgo M.,"Bay Area, CA",221,767,81,2.0,11/10/2009,"Meh. I've experienced better is right. All HYPE at this point in the juncture.  Call ahead seating is a joke. 45 minutes was the quote...we arrived right on time and were told by one of the hostess cupcakes that the wait was now 1.5 hours. Are you fuggin kiddin me? So we sit and wait, and wait. Then finally the head hostess, told us their vibrators were broke. So..we had been waiting for nothing...really.  Once seated, our waiter was Joe. ""Joe was my husband's name"" my 93-year old Grandma said. ""Joe is a common name"" said Joe.  DICK!  His serving neglect and off base sarcasm continued through the experience...total azz and example of when someone thinks their looks can carry them. ""He kinda looks like that handsome man from my soap opera that now left and has his own primetime show doesn't he?"" said my Grandma. It took me a minute to figure out who she meant. I decided he did sort of resemble Shemar Moore...but in a broke down thinkin' he's hot, working at BJ's while probably giving some on the side sort of way.  DICK.  The food was okay...if you like egg rolls with hot avocado inside. WTF.  I'll be back cuz I wanna try the pizza and hot cookie dessert. Hopefully we have a better experience cuz this one was more like bad hand job."
Jessica H.,"Concord, CA",149,235,337,4.0,1/5/2010,"I've been here twice to the new location and had two completely different experiences. The first was on opening day- went and had dinner. With the exception of my burnt pizookie, it was delish. The second time was during lunch. Decided to try the fettuchini alfredo- which ended up having a hair in it. I told my server (who later came back and asked if l had save the hair- huh???), and the manager brought me a new plate at no charge. There ended up being not one, but TWO, fettuchini's on the bill. It also took about 90 minutes because she rang up the wrong tabs to the wrong debit cards. I would definitely go back, but not on lunch!"
Sheila B.,"Antioch, CA",173,19,,5.0,6/18/2010,"been here twice and both times had a great experience. First time, i called for a reservation for 5 people and we were seated within 10 min. (packed Saturday night); Second time, no reservation for 2 people and  seated within 20 min. (busy Thurs. night) The last time I was there, I ordered the CHARDONNAY SHRIMP PASTA and oh my goodness, it was ecstasy...paired with a MANGO MOJITO and it took all my strength to stop myself from drooling and making inappropriate noises.  love the ambiance, and although we were pretty much surrounded by huge TVs, it didn't intrude our evening. i'm a big fan of low lighting and the effect it gives, so  when I first walked in, I was sold.  definitely will return here again.  If you can, MAKE A RESERVATION, it does get packed."
Dean M.,"Martinez, CA",3,33,,2.0,2/1/2013,"I have tried this place three times now. First time, Slow service on a Sunday. Out of food items and house beers, bathrooms look like a Greyhound station.   Called district office, took a month to get a hold of me (I had to call back). Then the General manager calls me and comps me a dinner for a retry.  The food and service were excellent.  As any manager should do, he made sure we enjoyed our experience as a thank you for giving him the opportunity to make things better.  Went in a third time, this time for the pizza and other foods. Pizza was almost raw dough in the middle, the service great again, the bathrooms look like a Greyhound station again (all three visits honestly) and the bar slow all three times as well.   Very mixed feelings on if I will go again.  They have great food potential with unfortunately very poor execution if the General manager is not looking over them like a hawk from my experiences."
Islandgirl G.,"Martinez, CA",0,2,,4.0,5/12/2012,"Our first time here and I must say I was impressed. Considering I wasn't expecting much as for the service and food, as to reading some of reviews on yelp. As we arrived greeted by the hostess and seated us right away. Our waiter was awesome making sure we have everything. The food was good - start off with appetizers, meal and dessert. My family was satisfied, definitely coming back again."
jeffrey k.,"Emeryville, CA",0,44,,3.0,1/14/2011,"Went back a couple times and things were amiss each time. Same complaints as some of the other reviewers: lackadaisical service; skimpy toppings; unmelted cheese. Let me just stop there. Unmelted cheese on a pizza pie. Someone should lose their pizza license.  Good beer is good beer, and the place is still a nice setting for beer imbibery. The food gets demoted to bar food."
Sherly M.,"Walnut Creek, CA",101,62,82,1.0,12/11/2013,"I really wish I would have taken a picture of my sandwich today because most of you won't believe me!! I was there from 12-1 pm today for lunch, sat in the bar area and had lunch with a friend. Well I ordered a half sandwich and soup lunch special. Tomato bisque soup was delicious. No complaints.  My club sandwich came out next. I took a bite and I stopped because I couldn't bite thru the whole way. I pulled the sandwich away from my mouth to realize the wax paper that separates the cheese slices was STILL on the cheese!! Really!!!?? From the cook and then to the runner and for two people to not realize there's non-edible items in my food is just beyond me!! The waitress called her manager over. All I got were simple apologies from the both of them. And when the check came to the table they still wanted to charge me for the meal. Um, NO! My friend got up and spoke to the manager again for them to comp the meal. That's just unacceptable! Worst experience."
Alexander A.,"Honolulu, HI",1,17,,4.0,10/30/2009,"Since the recruiting office I work at is across the street, I was super excited about BJ's.  Went their on an opening night, had pizza and beer.  I am a huge fan of Blue Moon and because they have it on top this review just went from 3 stars to 4.   Of course, their was a miss-communication between servers on the Happy Hour menu ( a little later on that).  They have a gigantic TV above the bar which was pretty cool.   The food was better than your average chain restaurant.  I had deep dish pizza which was great.  Now on Happy Hour.  Its 3-7 p.m. Monday-Friday.  You get $1 off of beers or tap and mini deep dish pizza (which normally goes for $10) you get for $5.  And during NFL games and MNF, happy hour applies through the duration of the game."
Paula K.,"Downtown Berkeley, Berkeley, CA",7,21,4,1.0,3/15/2012,"March 8 went for lunch.  Six in our party including children.  Server was attentive but overworked.  Four members of our party received their entree and were finished before the other two were served.  Mentioned to our server and wrote to company, no response.  Will have to air their dirty laundry on Yelp:-(."
J M.,"Brentwood, CA",0,4,,4.0,6/13/2011,"I absolutely love this place! The pizza is delish (BJ's The Works) and the fried potato skins which is the worst thing you could ever put in your body is scrumptious! I also like the chicken wings but I think they need to make that a little crispy. I enjoy the atmosphere, casual and the service isn't bad. I can't wait for the one in Brentwood to open in October! Pizza night will never be there same at my house when they open up the location here! Yeah! P.S. If you guys are ever in SoCal - the BJ's in Cerritos hands down has the BEST pizza."
Sarah W.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,24,,4.0,3/4/2011,"Decent service, usually. I've had good and bad waiters & waitresses here. Its nearly always busy and loud. The food is usually delicious. I recommend the grilled chicken pasta or the great white pizza.  The pizookie is a delicious way to end a good dinner as well, if you're not already stuffed!"
Marie W.,"Martinez, CA",36,174,,3.0,1/20/2012,"Food was FOUR stars but our waitress was not very motivated at all. Soon. As we sat down, without even having our menus handed to us she wanted our drink order and our appetizer order. Asked for a moment to look at the menu. When she arrived we ordered soup as appetizers and she asked if we want it out at the same time as our dinner. We politely asked for it first.  Our soup was served from another waiter and was so good. The soup was served with a waiter who likes his job. Not even two minutes later our dinner was out of the kitchen. Why ask if y our not going to listen. Asked for no tomatoes and still had tomatoes. I know people have off days and we are human, I did only take off one star. Also, we only saw her to place our order and drop off the check. No polite, is there anything i can get you, till she dropped off the check. And they were not that busy, Thursday night at six. I will still go back, as this has been my 6 the visit to this location. This has been the only time we had an waitress that lacked motivation."
Jac T.,"Oakland, CA",413,290,24,3.0,6/19/2010,"It is what it is.  There's nothing horrible about it...it's a chain and it's consistent.  It's not fab, and it's not special.   I always love a good pizookie, so i'd go back for that....oh, and the bacon crumble on that baked potato ain't bad either!! it's great for groups, and fun for what it is...."
TIM M.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",12,96,41,3.0,11/30/2009,"Food is good quality and service is OK.  I had the mini Pepperoni and a small wedge salad. Yummers on all counts. Having all of the calorie information available for your perusal before you order is kinda like a bad version of ""Scared Straight"".  Visually the atmosphere is warn and inviting, but it us pretty noisy."
Josh B.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",39,655,,2.0,8/17/2012,"mushroom pizza was good, salad was WAYYYYY overdressed. I mean we're talking lettuce in a virtual ocean of honey mustard. Also a total, complete and absolute CF of epic proportions occurred when the doors opened - the restaurant was seemingly unable to seat anybody for 15 min, then put EVERYBODY in one section and totally hosed the servers.  We wound up with free pizza to make up for the disaster."
Jo Anne S.,"Daly City, CA",33,7,,5.0,5/17/2011,"Thank you BJ's of Concord.  I had my granddaughter's 1st Communion reception for 35 people here on Sunday May 15th. The staff was friendly, accommodating, courteous and fulfilled every request. The menu was awesome....great combination pizza. This was the best package deal I have ever purchased. Food was in abundance... appetizers were yummy! Thank you so much for making this a very successful event. I will be back! Jo Anne S."
rosanna c.,"Berkeley, CA",65,229,,4.0,12/24/2009,"Hooray, there's a BJ's in the East Bay. Well, I guess there's one in Newark, but Concord is closer. I go to BJ's whenever the BF wants to go to a sports bar atmosphere and I want pizookie. This place has been open a few months (street level near JCPenney's), but I couldn't tell since the service and food were up to par with all the other BJ's I've been to. Service actually may be a bit better here because there are so many servers, probably in training, standing near the bar.  Like all BJ's, the wait can be long, and you have to stay in range of the beeper (sorry, no mall shopping). It's easy to get a table for 4 or less, but definitely make reservations if your group is larger. There's a dine-in promo until 1/8/10. Meal for 2: 2 salads or soups, 1 med pizza, 1 pizookie for $19.99.  I'm not a fan of their beers, but do try their hand-crafted sodas. The cream soda is heavenly and a perfect pairing with any pizza. And they say deep dish, but they're not really. The deepness is in the dough, everything else is like regular pan pizza."
