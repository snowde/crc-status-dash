Louis H.,"San Jose, CA",208,272,648,4.0,5/11/2012,"Regular mega sports bar here.  Enjoyment can be had by just sitting at the bar and watching their extra large split TV.  The bar is long and has two rows of taps behind.  The staff seem to be very nice at this restaurant and try to accommodate as best they can.  My meal consisted of their roasted beef sandwich with au Jus.  I ordered the skinny fries and a sampler of beer.  I asked the bartender if they could cut me a rare piece.  She said they would try.  The meat is already packaged before it arrives so they can't  very well uncook it.  The meal arrived and to my surprise the meat was fairly rare.  The fries were very thin and crispy.  They were very enjoyable and tasty.  The beer went like this: drink my beer, drink more beer, sit on stool for an hour, bs with my neighbors about sports.  Go home and relax.  Whats to complain about.  {Individual beer evaluations at a later date.)"

Michelle N.,"Hercules, CA",125,221,41,2.0,12/12/2009,"The family and I stopped in at lunch on a pre-Christmas Friday to have something to eat before taking the little one to see Santa Claus. We arrived right around noonish and was expecting more of a wait but luckily we got seated right away in one of the last tables available. (We were very lucky -- just a few minutes later, all the tables were full and a long wait for tables started!!) This was the first time I've ever been to a BJ's so I didn't know what to order. Sis got the house made orange cream soda; I got a cream soda plus a lemonade for the little one. We also ordered some calamari to share. Eventually, my parents joined us and we ordered our entrees. Their lunch specials covered most bases and we all found something we wanted; sis got a hamburger, Dad got a french dip, Mom got jambalaya and I got some hamburger sliders. We also got a chicken tender entree for the little one. Our calamari came out maybe fifteen minutes after we ordered it, which wasn't so bad. The calamari itself was delicious! Very tender, well breaded and good sauces. Nice job, BJ's! And then came the entree wait. Even accounting for the lunch rush, we waited over a half hour for our lunch entrees AFTER our appetizer came out. If you've ever been to a restaurant with a fussy toddler, you know that this is torture!! Our waitress didn't seem that attentive though we got our refills without asking for them. When we finally got our food, it was still another ten minutes before my dad's food came. The burgers were pretty dry so we asked for extra mayo; it never came. The food itself was okay. I liked my sliders but would have liked them more if I had steak sauce or mayo to help lubricate the darn things. My mom liked her jambalaya and my dad liked his french dip but would have liked more au jus to go with it. Like me, sis' burger was pretty dry so she ended up just eating my mom's food. All in all, a pretty mediocre experience. I don't know if I'll be back, especially with a toddler in tow. While BJ's has a kids menu with a neat pack of crayons, I wouldn't call them kid friendly. The place is loud and the lights are low, two things which sort of set my easily overstimulated toddler into high alert. Their high chairs also seem sort of small. My little one is pretty small, at the tail end of the growth scale, but I found it extremely difficult to put her in the high chair and she seemed very uncomfortable in it."
Laura D.,"Brentwood, CA",16,56,7,4.0,7/2/2010,"I was a little surprised to see all of the bad reviews since I've been here four times and have had nothing but good experiences. I will add that I haven't been here during busy times. It sounds like this place has issues if you come during prime dining hours.  I will return to BJ's because...  They can make a dirty martini.  They serve real horseradish with their french dip (why didn't I think of this?!), but it could be considered a little dry if you prefer fatty vs. lean.  Their chopped Italian and Cobb salads are flavorful.  The low lighting and busyness give the restaurant a nice ambiance."
Erin G.,"New York, NY",20,52,37,4.0,10/24/2009,"Overall, despite being hectically busy and a bit rowdy with larger parties, I had a more-than-satisfactory experience with BJ's.   My bf and I got there just before 6pm on a Saturday night, an intimidating mass of people already outside.  As one person put it, ""there's no recession here.""  For our party of 2, we were quoted 45-60 minutes; seated in about 30.   Our server welcomed us warmly and took our drink order right away.  The root beer made on site is tasty.  I ordered a hot tea that came with a little kettle for extra hot water.  A moat of hot water started to grow around the kettle and we figured out that the kettle was actually leaking.  That's okay, though.  It led to a pleasant conversation about rates of change, high school calculus, and physics (""Physics B is basically a place to learn gang signs.  Right-Hand Ruuule!""); and the server we alerted brought out a replacement kettle in no time. The atmosphere was typical for a busy restaurant: people running all over.  However, I never felt cramped.  Yes, there are TVs, but they're high enough on the walls you can avoid looking at them.  We were right next to a group of 10 celebrating a 20-something's birthday.  Typical ""classy"" affair.  Like the kettle-situation, it was also bittersweet.  (""WHERE'S OUR SERVER?"" followed by ""Shut UP, birthday girl."" cackle cackle). Our food came quickly.  We ordered the Cajun Pasta and the Jambalaya, which came in quantities enough to take half home.  Both dishes were tasty, though I preferred the pasta since it had subtler flavors.  We also got the Pizookie (my first time here; I need to be initiated to BJ's).  It came a little slower, but it was a nice substitute to the long-gone giant cookie sandwich at Elephant Bar.   When we were finished, our server took care of our check in a timely fashion, bid us a great night, and we were out of there before anyone could sing a drunken Happy Birthday.  I'll be back, but maybe until after the hype cools down."
Chris C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",17,15,1,3.0,9/12/2010,"Would give this place 5 stars for their beers (wonderful selection) but only two stars for their food. The beers, both their own and the guest taps, are wonderful.  They have a wide variety and anyplace that has Monk Cafe Sour Ale on tap is great!! The food, for my tastes, is way too heavy. The quality is fair for this type of establishment, but just not suited for me. Everything is either breaded, deep fried or slathered in oils.....just not my preference.  Others I have gone with really like the avocado rolls and wings. The burgers are ok, which is what I will usually order.........but hey...let's be honest:  you're going here for the beer!!!"
Danielle M.,"Woodland Hills, CA",112,54,25,5.0,10/31/2011,"Always love love alllllll the food here! Service has always been great, drinks are great. The tomato bisque soup is Soooooooo good and I love the Mac and cheese!!"
Aimee T.,"Martinez, CA",0,3,,1.0,4/12/2013,"This place is consistently a let down. When we dine in they are typically out of at least one thing we order and the service is slow. However dining in is the better end of the deal. I cannot even begin to explain how bad the curbside service is, but I will just give an account of our most recent visit. We ordered online and went to pick up. After calling to let them know we were outside, they did not come out for twenty minutes. When we called back, the gal working the curbside was not even aware we had called the first time, and our food was not ready. After she brought us out a complimentary beverage for our troubles, we were on the way home, about 45 min later than our pick up time. When we got home, there were pieces of the order missing. We will not be ordering from them again, they have consistently bad customer service. We were very unhappy."
Connie Z.,"Oakland, CA",230,7,,1.0,1/19/2012,"The first time i came here it was pretty busy but id assume they have enough chefs to take care of everyone in a certain amount of time. I didnt get my food until an hour later and half of it was cold and half of it was warm. I could barely even find the server when i needed something. The second time i was there, we were placed all the way in the back of the restaurant. It was the last table in the row. and honestly, it wasnt even a table. it was like an emergency table for when it get too busy and theres no where else to sit. but it was so slow! everyone else got to sit in booths & there was still plently of booths open but nooo. they had to place us at the ugliest table in the restaurant. and there was a column blocking one of the chairs so you cant actually sit comfortably. and yet again the food took a long while to come out. oh & i didnt even get a greeting when i entered the restaurant. they had us sit and wait to get a table when there was plently open. the person who guided us to the table was rude too, like come on now, at least a smile? i think the people who work here are racist! there was 2 white ladies that came in and they got a booth that could fit 5 people when there were small booths still open. and they werent even big people!"
donna y.,"San Ramon, CA",181,51,1,4.0,4/20/2010,"I like this place. In the past 2 months my friends and I have came here 3 times. That's sort of a lot for a restaurant.  So the food and drinks are good. Everything that I've gotten hit the spot. I'm surprised that people say the customer service was bad. One time we came it was for a birthday had about 15 people or more, our server I think his name was J was super nice and dealt with us drunk people. The other day we went for lunch and our server was so cute. She had a great personality and it made me think that the servers were always kind.  Anyways come here, the food is good, portions are good. Nothing bad I can say about this place. :)"
Azam H.,"Concord, CA",64,43,1,2.0,1/19/2010,"I received a pre-opening invitation for BJ's back in October 2009. It was good for 4 people, so my wife and I invited another couple to join us there to try it out.  The location used to be Houlihan's in the Sun Valley Mall. It's been completely gutted, redesigned, and rebuilt. It's very modern and upscale now with a great (and very long) bar with huge flat screen TVs above it.  The menu is quite large (not as big as Cheesecake Factory, but big) and the food choices seem similar. The food was complimentary in exchange for a donation to the charity of the night, and we had to pay for any alcohol ordered. (More on that later)  We were told to order four different meals to ""test the kitchen staff"" and were offered the choice of appetizer or dessert. The flat bread pizza appetizer was good as were the four meals.  One annoying aspect of the evening was they kept trading out our waiters every 20min or so. By the end of the meal, we felt we had about 6 different waiters throughout the night. They said it was for training, but it left us feeling a bit discarded. Despite all these waiters visiting our table, a typical gripe still emerged: no one would remove our finished meal plates and you are forced to stare at them or move them aside yourself - a common theme at many restaurants these days.  Now we're down to the last parts of the meal, (the plates are finally gone) the check has been dropped, and we've already paid the bill. The other husband and I are finishing our beers, when a completely different waitress comes up and asks, ""Would you like me to top those off for you?"" I ask, ""You mean our beers?"" And she she says, ""Yes, top them off."" I said OK and she took our not-quite finished beers with her.  She comes back with two full beers - and right behind her is our most-recent waiter with ANOTHER BILL FOR TWO MORE BEERS. I was totally put off by her topping off ""offer"" rather than making it clear she was selling us 2 additional beers. We weren't even finished with the ones we had - which we would have before ordering another round.  They might not be good at picking up plates, but they sure know how to get another bill worked up and dropped off! Hell, he almost beat the beers to the table.  I was all set to take this up with the manager, as I felt we were duped into purchasing more beer; but my friend ended up paying the second bill when I went to the restroom, thus avoiding any more involvement with their staff.  I realize one visit and one slightly off putting experience do not a restaurant make, but I haven't found myself going back there yet to give them another shot."
Christy P.,"Walnut Creek, CA",42,177,181,4.0,6/18/2012,The first time I ever heard of BJs was in SoCal and I fell in love. I like their food and the happy hour. But get to the bar early cause it fills up fast. I usually get a wedge salad or a small meal. The pizza there is also good if you like deep dish. I am a soda kind of gal and this Concord location has the homemade root beer and it was really good. I also like the pear cider and berry cider.
nadia a.,"Orinda, CA",1,10,2,1.0,12/27/2009,"Ugh! Worst dining experience of my life. I normally never skimp on tip, but this place was just that bad. Let me list the reasons why: 1) We waited 1.75 hours for a table, probably because it just opened 2) Waitress spilled a drink on two of my friends, and still charged them for it 3) Found a hair in my food and I think it may not have been mine since it was there before I started eating. 4) Our plates were dirty when they gave them to us, we asked for new ones 5) The to-go box she gave me for the pazookie I ordered was covered in dust...so unsanitary 6) Slow service, the waitress was nice and she meant well but come on people... 7) This isn't really anything to do with the service, but all BJ's lacquer their floors to a dangerous slickness. I didnt slip but I imagine that place is one old lady and a broken hip away from a law suit. In conclusion...don't go here!!!!"
Ben M.,"Santa Cruz, CA",175,131,23,3.0,3/31/2012,"I have only come here for drinks so I will have to do another review when I have the food. I love all of the options on tap! It's close to work & the gym, so often times I will see co-workers & friends here enjoying some ap's and cocktails after their day. Price is pretty average. The bar is nice, and the bar area is appropriate, although can get crowded."
Annette M.,"Concord, CA",3,19,,1.0,8/10/2014,"Absolutely horrible service! We waited over 15 minutes to be asked what drinks we wanted because our waiter was chatting with another table of patrons. We were seated outside without being asked if it was ok. We ordered the Fried Calamari  which took forever to arrive, our waiter even was shocked it had not arrived yet. When it did finally arrive it was soggy instead of crispy. I will definitely will not be giving this restaurant anymore of my business."
Ivan W.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",92,54,18,3.0,1/1/2010,"Darn you BJ's for screwing up the parking at Sun Valley Mall! Minus one star! The wait sucked too, but it was nice that they came around with pizza samples. Still, we missed happy hour because of it. I thought the food was pretty good, but they messed up our order a little bit. The replacement came quickly, though, and after a quick check to make sure they didn't hawk a loogie in it or anything I dug in. I got a bbq beef sandwich and it was good, but greasy. I think the best thing they have going for them, though, is their pizookies. Two scoops of vanilla bean ice cream on a freshly baked cookie. soooo good. If i go back, i think i might skip the food and just eat a pizookie by myself."
Stuart M.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",22,154,,1.0,1/1/2014,"Beer selection looks promising until you realize most of the tap handles pour their own mediocre brews. Service is indolent at best, insolent at worst. Asked a bartender for mayo for my burger. Fifteen minutes later I asked a barback to get it and the bartender went all passive-aggro furious. She came back every 2 minutes to ask ""is everything better now?"" in a syrupy-sarcastic voice, as if we were retarded children who had skinned our knees. And speaking of the food, do NOT order a burger here. Seriously, this was among the sorriest burgers I have ever been served, including in military chow halls. I have had better burgers in remote areas of Europe where they don't know what a burger is, and just give you a fried clod of mystery meat. I asked for it medium rare and got it charred well. Served cold, cheese not even starting to melt at the edges. Four-day-old stale bun, bone dry. Sad little remnants of pickle and tomato inside, cut from the stem-ends. Cold greasy bacon that smelled like a KFC dumpster. And all of this assembled in the strafing fashion, scattered across the plate like it had tried to run and been machine-gunned down. Even though I only ate part of it, I had a mild case of food poisoning that kept me on the dumper for most of the next day. But hey, I hear the deep-dish cookie is really good."
Gabrielle M.,"San Ramon, CA",0,4,,2.0,7/17/2013,"So I came to BJ's last night and Katie was my server and to the say the least she was delightful. The beer she recommended was outstanding it was a mix of the berry beer and red ale and it was delicious  Tonight was unfortunately a much different experience we sat at the bar it took about 5+ minutes to get greeted, and when we did we immediately ordered our drinks and appetizers, but our server Lara forgot to put in our order so we had to wait about 15 minutes for my beer to come up and a bit longer for my appetizer, which on my last experience dining there took about 5 minutes to come up  Our server failed to check up on how our entrees were, so we got the manager's attention about our issue, which he was more than accommodating about. At the end due to our server's attitude we decided to tip the bartender who had to make up for our server's short comings, and I asked him to give the runner veronica who was extremely helpful a tip, and I mentioned that I knew she could not accept a tip because she was training, which then our server Lara proceeded to rush over with an aggressive disrespectful manner stating' she can take tips ill give it to her' and took the tip from my hand and stormed off to the back  I plan to come back to BJ's, but due to the bad taste that our server Lara left us with I think I'll just go to the Dublin location for a better dining experience."
John M.,"Vancouver, WA",15,30,,3.0,8/28/2010,"For all the gluten-free people out there! This pizza is horrible at best! Actually, I think they just didn't cook the crust all the way through. For all the gluten-free'ers, you know that raw gluten-free dough does not taste good at ALL. The outside edges of the crust were pretty good, but the rest of it was doughy, chewy, tasteless and it was an overall disappointing experience.  This place is all about volume, but they charge an arm and a leg, IMHO. Lunch prices are good, though!"
Tyler I.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",6,17,,3.0,1/3/2010,"This place is okay their happy hour food specials are a pretty good deal. They told us it would take 25 minutes but it ended up taking about 8 minutes. I got the mini size Sweet Pig which is a Hawaiian style pizza. Dough puffy crust with pretty fresh ingredients although they could be fresher and it wasn't very hot either. Wait staff is decent but you barely see the same waiter twice. Home brewed root beer was excellent though, and I am a pretty big fan of Root Beer. lots of tv's with sports on around but takes the social life away because you usually have to look up and away from anyone else to see them, not the best place for families in my opinion."
