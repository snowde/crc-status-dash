Angela G.,"Hercules, CA",36,68,81,2.0,3/1/2012,"I never usually had problems at BJ's before but when I went recently with my family for my cousins 19th birthday there were a few problems. First of all, I went in about 15 minutes before my family got there so I got a reservation and I let the hostess know that there was going to be 7 of us. She gave me a buzzer thing and told me to let them know when they get here. When my cousins got there, they told us they had a table ready for us but it was only able to seat 6 people. Clearly, I told the hostess there was going to be SEVEN of us. So we had to wait an additional 10 minutes which wasn't so bad. Another host gave me another buzzer and told us it would go off when a bigger table was available. When the buzzer finally went off I gave it to the original hostess who was assisting me and my family and she looked confused and didn't know what was going on. So i explained to her that another host gave me a NEW buzzer. She then made us wait an additional 15 minutes. When we finally get seated, they put us OUTSIDE secluded from everyone. The heaters were not strong enough, and it was cold. Our first waitress was nice although she seemed like she hated her job. After her shift was over, she then introduced us to another server who would be assisting us for the rest of the evening. He was a lot nicer and lively but disappointed me when he said they didn't have any more beignets :( Don't get me wrong, it's a good restaurant but I do NOT like their customer service. We should've got a complimentary pizookie for the long wait/hostess mistake."
Dave S.,"Concord, CA",0,13,,4.0,6/4/2014,"My wife and I eat out often and are used to nice restaurants.  While this restaurant doesn't have a chef on staff the menu was pretty large and the decor is modern and upscale.  We were seated in a middle table which I was not thrilled with, but when we are just two this is to be expected.  The server Ally was good and when we ordered our food we were offered to have our soup and salad delivered before the entree.  Ten minutes later a different server delivered our entrees'.  Eek!  Eventually we did get our salad and soup but the meal was disjointed and the plates were so big that it was awkward trying to eat from both plates.  The highlights of this dinner were the in-house brewed beer.  Very hoppy just the way I like them.  And the manager whose name was David came to our table and apologized for the mix up with our dinner.  I know they were just trying to get the food out quickly, but I did appreciate that they apologized and did what they could to make me feel better about it.  I gave this review a 4 star because the food was good and the atmosphere is pleasant and because they did what they could to fix a mistake."
John S.,"Pittsburg, CA",28,35,,4.0,10/21/2012,"Service was great. Prices are pretty good. Spend as much or as little as you want. Food was off the chart. Recommend to anyone who wants a fun place to grab a informal bite to eat, a drink, or watch the game. The atmosphere is great."
Nayla M.,"Martinez, CA",88,35,54,5.0,6/3/2012,"Our kids LOVE BJ's and so do we. It's always a good option when we want to go out and each time we get hot, yummy food. We are never disappointed."
Marilyn. E.,"Sugar Land, TX",8,153,1,4.0,5/23/2012,We've had lunch here several times now and it has always been good.  The Roast Beef dip is always excellent. Love the thin crispy fries.  I had the new lunch item that is a Southern Fried Chicken Breast over cheddar mashed potatoes and with southwest corn for only $5.99 and it was excellent!  Jessica's service was great the last two times we were there!  We sit in a comfy booth in the bar and watch the split screen tv..it has on something for everyone.
Kathleen M.,"Hercules, CA",30,13,5,4.0,7/19/2010,"Had very delicious pizza, their mini-size is enough for me, but if you're super hungry I suggest buying some pasta fills you up more.  But anyways, went there and ate the veggie mini pizza. it was soooo good! the pizza dough had a hint of this kind of butter taste, but it's up there with cheeseboard in berkeley for me as for pizza.   Something you should FORREALS get when you come here is the PIZOOKIE!! omg so so good. was the first time i tried it and now i'm hooked.  now up there with all my favorite desserts.  they serve you a freshly baked ooey-gooey warm chocolate chip cookie (YUMM!) and top it off with vanilla bean ice cream and it just melts all over the cookie. ahhh soo good!"
RENEE R.,"Concord, CA",29,38,2,2.0,3/9/2014,Poor poor service!! Food just ok. Kitchen ran out of items but did not inform us until food was delivered. Never got refills. Good delivered without utensils on table.
Dennis E.,"Concord, CA",16,17,11,4.0,11/7/2009,"Yes it is a chain Get over it! Good beer, good food Very crowded but I like going in places where people are busy. If you can get a seat @ the bar incredible 4/screen HdTV so you can watch multiple sports I probably wouldn't go with a large group as I don't do flashing vibrators in public & I really like sitting @ the bar where ever I go Bottom line, the only true way to rate anything; is would you do it again Yes, I'm going back"
Jessica C.,"Vallejo, CA",7,5,,5.0,9/10/2012,"By far this place has the best burritos in town , I will not go anywhere else. There super burritos feeds me twice and my girlfriend twice for only $10.00... I would recommend this place to anyone"
Rachel S.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",2,90,,3.0,1/30/2010,Most of their beers are good (I prefer their Berry Burst Cider).  Their pizza is delicious!  Great Happy Hour!  1/2 off mini pizzas in the bar area.   Lunch menu is extensive and reasonably priced.
Keith B.,"Concord, CA",5,158,,2.0,1/29/2010,"Pretty standard fare as far as food and beer goes. The pizza is definitely worth getting and the desserts are pretty good. The spinach and artichoke dip, although pretty good, gave me a massive case of heartburn, and I'm not exactly opposed to greasy food. The beer is alright, nothing mind-blowing, the Jeremiah Red is my personal favorite. Would probably be 3-4 stars if not for the hideous service at this place. The first time I went there, it was busy, but not packed. There were tables available and there was no wait to eat. Had to wait 20+ minutes for my appetizer, and even though I ordered the beer BEFORE the meal, the beer came about 2 minutes before the actual meal came. I complained to the manager and left no tip. I decided to give it another chance, and although the service was better, there were maybe 5 other parties there at that time and I still felt like I had to send up a smoke signal to get my waitresses' attention. Bummer."
Daniel M.,"San Jose, CA",95,116,90,3.0,12/6/2009,"Came here with a group of eight of my cousins during Black Friday. 45 minute wait for inside, 15 minutes for patio. Turned out that the patio table wasn't actually available, but they gave us an inside table after about a 25 minute wait. I had spent too much already during the day, so I jumped all over the lunch specials. The BBQ pulled pork sliders sounded really good and were only about $6. Those turned out pretty dry, but the amount of food was definitely worth the price.  We also shared a pizookie party platter among us. They got the order wrong and brought out a regular pizookie. After realizing their mistake, they called it a ""sampler"" and gave it to us free of charge. Nice! Overall, a nice experience, but just so-so food. Summary: 3/5 stars +Pizookie, pizookie, pizookie +Our waitress was really nice -So-so food -Crowded"
Amanda M.,"Dixon, CA",72,85,10,4.0,2/25/2010,"I have yet to go to BJ's and not like my meal. I have ordered everything from a pizza, chicken strips, salad, crusted chicken - and it is all great! The appetizers are great as well. The house-brewed sodas are smooth and delicious as well! They're lunch specials are a bargain!  I'm not thrilled with their selection of desserts. I am NOT a fan of the cookie dessert they push. If they could improve the desserts, they'd get five stars from me."
Van W.,"Oakland, CA",220,283,1,3.0,11/24/2009,"Wow, this place has grown in popularity in a short amount of time.  I've gone to another BJs (San Mateo) and this place is pretty similar. It's not too big but they still have a nice selection of their beers.  There is more and more of a wait each time we go -- good for them, annoying for us. Service is still I think a bit hiccup-y.  Our orders usually get messed up and no one fixes things but nothing major.  (2 people ordered thing fries, got wedge instead, when we brought it to the server's attention she said she'd bring us another plate but never returned except to give us our bill) The hostesses and servers are all very friendly and probably have been trained to do so, but I think some of them stop thinking and are on auto-pilot.   It's a bit pricier, but the inside is still nice and we come here occasionally anyways.  So apparently it's good enough.  Oh right, the food is ok, mostly just whelming -- not over, not under.  I tend to get the Angus Roast Beef Dip (French dip) and happy with that.  I would not recommend their BBQ beef and Chicken plate -- small serving sizes and dry.  That is just from one experience though so who knows."
Salonje R.,"Sunnyvale, CA",194,278,41,5.0,8/3/2011,Tried the Medittaranian deep dish pizza.  It is super yummy...also drinking the Berry Burst cidar beer.  Just learned from the bartender that BJs went through the same company that makes their Pear cidar beer.  Also tried a sample of some yummy mixture of this beer with a special berry syrup.  I forgot the name but it was so delicious. I am beginning to like this place...
Kevin Z.,"Concord, CA",75,99,12,4.0,2/7/2012,"Good beer, nice place, generally new staff, and hit or miss on food."
dina s.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",222,150,34,2.0,4/21/2011,"We went to BJs for dinner with a large-ish group of people. First, they messed up our reservation. As in  they didn't have it at all. Minus one point. Super! We finally sat down and our waitress came up and told us we weren't peppy enough. Maybe if it wasn't 9:00pm and we hadn't waited foerever, we'd be peppy. Ok, whatever. Minus another point.  She took our drink orders and my fiance got a delish beer. Plus one point. Our waitress came back and told us that someone else was taking over. No prob.  New waitress- forgot to take our menus away after she took the order. Forgot to note that I wanted dressing on the side. Minus two points. Boo! I ordered the Great White pizza and my fiance had the BJs favorite. The crusts were good, the pizzas were alright. No points in either direction. The server who brought us the food tols us ""If you want something healthier, go for thin crust"". Thanks for telling us after we ordered. Boo!  We lied and said it was someone's birthday. The waitress then told the guys- way to ruin the surprise. Minus one! But we did get a delish pizooki for the table because of the wait. Plus one! And then they messed up our bill. Minus one. We still had fun, so I guess plus one. Grand total: 2 points, BJs."
simone x.,"San Francisco, CA",0,20,,2.0,7/3/2014,"Server sucked her name is Kimberly. Heavy attitude. Never once checked to refill our water.  Would ask if everything was ok as she ""passed"" ( and kept going) our table and kept on walking regardless if we answered, grunt or not. Poor customer service and when she did take some time and we acknowledged with thank you she would respond ""my pleasure"" as though it was  beneath her and painful. We were apprehensive to ask for anything because we were OH SO inconveniencing her.  And we were paying for this BS?!!  WTF.  We ordered a hamburger w/fries... no condiments. We had to get up and get it ourselves from another table. Needless to say she got a meager tip.  It was NOT busy and this was in the bar area. BJ at Sun Valley Mall.  I will not be returning. We spent $70 on food and drinks. Poor.."
Heather N.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,4.0,12/18/2012,"I absolutely loved their food! Everytime I go here I am satisified, whether its the pizza, baked potato, nachos, ect.  I love how they stay open late because gives plenty of time to enjoy their delicious bar drinks! They might want to lighten up on the waxy floors, i had to tip toe in my heels so i wouldnt fall :(  Everything else is Great!!"
Shane R.,"Walnut Creek, CA",28,155,2,2.0,5/1/2012,"This place is great if you are into over-paying for food just to have a nice enviroment. The food we have had here isn't bad, just not great. Its clean and nice enviroment, but I care more about the food than what the place looks like. Ide rather go to some small hole in the wall family restraunt thats is half the price with better food."
