J C.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",0,20,120,4.0,5/22/2017,I have been here many times ordering the same food but sometimes the food taste too salty. Its like hit and miss. But overall they are good place!
Michael B.,"Galt, CA",9,6,,1.0,8/2/2017,"My party of five was promptly seated. That's the highlight of this visit. First off, it was about 100 degrees outside and the air conditioning wasn't working or it wasn't adequately set. It was uncomfortably warm inside. We sat at our table for 20 minutes and were never acknowledged by any of the staff. We asked an employee if she knew who our server was. She replied, ""Yes, I know who she is. If she's busy, I'll take care of you guys."" We waited 10 more minutes and still we were not helped at all. My party and I got up and walked across to Lucille's. This is twice in the last two weeks that I've received horrible service here. What makes it worse is that there were plenty of employees standing around. It's a shame because the food is pretty good here."
Steve B.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",103,206,120,1.0,7/7/2016,"Super disappointed with the hostess. She took my name and said it would be a about 10-15 minute wait. After waiting about 10 minutes I started to notice that people that got there after us were being seated.  I asked the same hostess about the status of our wait to which her answer was ""we already called you.""  I told her that she did not call me since we were standing right by the hostess stand and we did not hear her call my name. I did hear her say to another host to ""call Steve"" but he never did (I thought there may have been another party named Steve). I told her that I heard her conversation with the other host and he never called my name. Her reply to me was ""we'll seat you as soon as possible.""  I looked at the other host and said, I said you never called Steve. His response was we'll seat you as soon as possible. No apologies, no I'm sorry or anything. They both acted as if they were dismissing my concern.  We decided to stay because we were hungry. After being sat 5 minutes later we were seated. Unfortunately, either the server was having a bad day or they hostess and host told him about our interaction. Our server had a nonchalant attitude. He was slow and it was another 10-15 minutes before we finally got our food.  Fortunately, he was phased out and sent home and we had a different server. Our new server was 100% better. He was friendly and be took care of us. We took care of him by ensuring he got to keep the tip (cash- which was well over 25% of the bill), and he did not tip out the other server, hostess or hosts."
Natalia L.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",0,2,12,5.0,5/11/2017,"Nice place to have a dinner. Delicious food and tasty beer. Blood orange IPA is my favorite. If you will be here, ask for Jarred! He is super nice, polite and intelligent, helps to choose from the menu, and even if you forget your dessert after a good dinner, he will remind you and offer to take it to go with a beautiful smile."
Marcia B.,"San Francisco, CA",5,98,,2.0,4/1/2017,"I ordered salad for takeout and I'm still sitting here waiting for it 20 mins later. I asked the front person what's the status and he just said ""20 mins"". I asked ""another 20 mins"". To which he said ""I don't know. I don't work the kitchen"". So fucking rude. WTF Is taking so long. It's only a salad. Especially since the place is more than 1/2 empty. The girl taking the order was super nice.  Hence the 2 stars. That's it."
Jimmy P.,"Pleasanton, CA",188,21,3,5.0,9/3/2017,Thanks for the customer service pat . Customer service is a big deal in this industry!
Cheryl W.,"San Ramon, CA",2,52,,2.0,8/6/2017,"I have had brunch at BJ's in Sacramento and it is very good. However, I had brunch at their Concord location today and it was terrible. Even though I asked for my eggs to be scrambled medium, they were over cooked and did not taste good. My bacon tasted like cardboard, and my pancakes were just ok. My mimosa had mostly champagne and little orange juice. My server came to take my order after a group that was seated after me. I will not return to brunch at this BJ's any time soon!"
Kevin C.,"Missoula, MT",0,17,1,1.0,9/13/2017,Placed my order online they forgot to check the computer so here I sit waiting for food. It's okay though because everything I ordered is easy to make. If you miss someone's order maybe have a better way to deal with it than just saying that. If it was so easy why wasn't it done when I got here.
April B.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",0,19,,2.0,11/12/2017,"I first experienced this place about a month ago at about 3:00 on a weekday afternoon when not many people were there.  I sat at the bar area for about 20 minutes, and no one ever took my order.  Lots of servers standing around socializing, though.  I asked to be re-seated in the main dining area where I was promptly served.  The food was okay, so I decided to give it another chance.   Fast forward to today, Sunday early afternoon with a 10-15 minute wait. I took my mother and her roommate.  Both are in their 80's and live in an assisted living facility.  One walks with a cane and the other with a walker.  Both are obviously frail. No one seemed willing to give up their seats in the waiting area, so I asked the greeter if there was somewhere my mother and her friend could sit while we wait for our table.  The greeter said she would get 2 chairs.  I waited a few minutes and asked again, as it appeared she had forgotten.  She had not forgotten and said she'd take care of it.  She never did, and she never asked her co-workers for assistance. I approached another worker for assistance who told me that another man had approached the manager and was taking care of it. That other man was a customer who had watched the entire interaction.  He carried the chairs over and seemed just as disgusted as I was.  Meanwhile, the greeter that I initially approached remained oblivious.  When we were finally called to be seated, they seated us in an area near the bar that required going up steps. No harm was intended, but I was irritated by this point, especially since there were lots of empty tables in the main dining area with no steps.  We were re-seated, and the service was decent from that point on.  For that reason, I am giving 2 stars instead of 1. This is a place that clearly caters to much younger, able-bodied people.  What a sad statement about their service. I just can't see myself returning when their are other comparable restaurants nearby that demonstrate far greater sensitivity toward the elderly and disabled."
Brian P.,"Concord, CA",75,7,4,1.0,9/16/2017,Thought we would have a nice lunch. Walked in and stood there for a few minutes while 5 employees stood at the hostess station and did not even great us. Walked right out! Fail!
Lia S.,"Brentwood, CA",0,3,,5.0,9/9/2017,"Daniel B gave the best service , very helpful did an outstanding job. Will always come back because of him . Sitting in his section is a definite must!"
Supreet K.,"Tracy, CA",9,6,5,2.0,8/24/2017,I want with my sister the other day for lunch. We sat outside however their service is slow. We waited so long just to get our appetizer. I like the food but not the service.
Cristal V.,"Alameda, CA",0,4,,5.0,9/1/2017,It's been a while since I've been to BJ's Restaurant in Concord. I came in on a Friday night and was helped by a wonderful waiter by the name of Daniel. He was extremely attentive and super helpful.  My party and I were very pleased with our experience thanks to the chill environment and our wonderful waiter Daniel. We'll definitely be coming back again!
Karen V.,"Richmond, CA",10,18,17,5.0,6/20/2017,Been coming to this bjs for a about a year and I've never had a bad experience. Waiters re very attentive and kind. Love this place.
Justin O.,"Riverside, CA",142,9,5,1.0,12/30/2016,"BRING YOUR TABLETS!! You'll at least have something to do for their slow services. Came with four friends and ordered 4 mini pizzokies. The restaurant was not busy. We waited an hour before our pizzokies came. It took about 15 minutes at another BJs. To add to our disappointment, the pizzokies that arrived were cold! We waited over an hour for cold-not warm- pizzokies. Furthermore, we had to wait over 30 minutes to have our waiter hand us our check because he was nowhere to be seen. We also were never given the chance to have our water cups refilled. Terrible service and the long wait is not worth the time for the poor food quality."
Derek S.,"Pittsburg, CA",0,2,,5.0,8/26/2017,My Wife & I were in last night for dinner & were seated right away but once we had our table we weren't acknowledged for 10 minutes by a waiter/waitress for drinks or anything. Then Daniel walked by & we let him know our situation he immediately without hesitation asked for drinks as well as what we're having for dinner even though it wasn't his section. He found us a waitress made sure our food came out on time & make our experience absolutely enjoyable.
Iris T.,"Antioch, CA",151,78,29,3.0,1/7/2017,"I've been to this BJ's about 3 times now and I've gotten different experiences each time. But this most recent experience was not a great one. We got seated right away which was great, and the server came to our table right when we opened our menus. So we asked him to come back in a few minutes. Well it was extremely packed which I get, but it was about 20 minutes later until he was able to take our order. We saw him running around to different tables so obviously he was busy, but wow we hadn't even ordered food yet. We finally order, and it takes about 30 minutes to get our order to us and it was only 2 burgers and buffalo wings.. when I tried my wings I realized they sat at the window for a while because they were just lukewarm.. I do not suggest going here while it's busy."
K M.,"San Leandro, CA",12,51,16,1.0,10/12/2017,"I came here for a bday dinner for my friend. Our server (blondish red hair, guy in his early 20s) was honestly the worst server I've had in a long time if not the worst ever. He didn't show up for a long time, we were never asked if we wanted drinks or appetizers to start with. We all ordered our food, he was super quiet and barely acknowledged us the whole time. Everyone received their food except me. We tried to flag him down the whole time but could never get him. I received my food 20 minutes after my friends received theirs. There was no explanation when I got my food and unfortunately the food wasn't even worth the wait. I got cold spaghetti with burnt meatballs and the plate looked dirty. I barely touched my food and was never offered a refill for my drink. When we asked for our bill and wanted it split he rolled his eyes and told us we should just Venmo each other. He did eventually split our bills. Honestly it was a terrible night with horrible service and bland food. I won't be coming back here and urge others to steer clear."
Ophir S.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/6/2017,"My boyfriend and I normally love BJ's but unfortunately our experience yesterday was less than pleasant. We came here around 2:30 for a late lunch; we had calamari as an appetizer and I had the pork chop while he had the New Orleans jambalaya. While we were eating, I noticed my pork chop was slightly pink in the middle but didn't think anything of it at the time. My boyfriend and I both had some of it and we woke up in the middle of the night with food poisoning. We're both feeling miserable and now I have to miss my college classes today, not to mention I have a midterm tomorrow that I need to study for and the most movement I can endure is from the couch to the bathroom :/"
Willy M.,"El Sobrante, CA",0,6,,5.0,3/5/2017,"I've been to this BJ's twice now and it has quickly become my favorite restaurant because of the great service provided by Douglas the Manager and his team.   The first time my family and I had dinner here a few weeks ago Douglas came by our table to check on our meal, which was fantastic!  We went in again for dinner and he recognized us. He then came by our table to greet us and check in on our meal! Who does that?! If that doesn't  make you feel at home, nothing will.  Our server Gabrielle did a wonderful job taking care of us, she was extremely friendly and knowledgeable of the food on the menu.  I will continue to come back!! The brisket BBQ burger is a MUST!"
