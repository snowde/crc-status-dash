Ronald N.,"Hercules, CA",201,399,94,4.0,4/2/2011,After a few months absent from this place I still get great service. Jesse from the bar was very helpful and Doreen was amazing. Both of them are excellent server.
Maria P.,"Pittsburg, CA",936,67,38,1.0,2/15/2011,Horrible service... We have been here 4 times since it's been open the only thing that has been consistant is the horrible service... I do love their root beer ;)... But that's about it...
Ashlee G.,"Concord, CA",2,12,,4.0,8/11/2011,I was surprised at how quickly we were seated and served on a Saturday! We were immediately taken to our seats and had our app before they waitress had even brought over plates. We loved the stuffed mushrooms and the flatbread pizza. Overall it was a great experience.
Stephanie G.,"Concord, CA",38,23,9,2.0,11/11/2009,"I want to give this place a break because I know they just opened and how chaotic that can be for restaurants but the service was pretty awful and my food was less than mediocre.  I want to know how many times you have to ask for sweetener before a server brings it to you...apparently for our server it takes more than 3 because we eventually had to get the busser to get it for us after my friend's""s tea had been on the table for at least 15-20 minutes. Same goes for ranch. This server was also incapable of bringing out our food because two other servers did that and a third and fourth servers helped out throughout our whole visit too. Its a shame that the guy assigned to our table is the one who takes home the pretty generous tip we left him.  I would maybe look past the crappy service if my Cajun pasta was at least as hot as taco bell mild sauce! It would help if it wasn't dried out from being under a hot lamp for at least 20 minutes either! On the plus side my 4 friends did enjoy their food.  I plan on going back on a less crazy night and ordering something different. I'll update then, but for now it was a disappointment. =/"
K M.,"San Francisco, CA",1,14,,3.0,6/16/2012,"The service here is really a hit or a miss but it has dropped dramatically since it first opened. We've found pieces of meat in our vegetarian pizza. Utensils are almost always dirty. Condiments are brought out after asking 3/4 times. I've yet to be impressed with the service.  Other than that, the food is great. Avacado eggrolls are scrumptious!"
TJ M.,"Providence, RI",223,21,2,4.0,11/10/2011,"Definitely expensive for the food quality, but it makes up for it with friendly service, always getting seated right away, being open until 1am, and pizookies."
Kevin M.,"San Francisco, CA",0,5,4,3.0,1/19/2010,"BJs always has really good food. However, this Concord restaurant was incredibly disorganized. There would be many cleaned off tables waiting to be filled with the dozens of customers waiting at the cramped front, and yet it took them forever to put anyone at them.  At the front desk, waiters and hosts would just be chatting with one another and standing around.  I arrived there at 6pm (with my name called ahead). I did not get seated until 30 minutes after I was told I'd be seated. Salads came before appetizers (shouldn't have happened), appetizers took forever to get to the table, and the order of fish tacos was ice cold.  We did not get out of the restaurant until 9:15, and we are not ones to stay and mingle forever after we finish eating.  BJs is still one of my favorite restaurants, but this was not one of my favorite locations due to its lack of organization."
emme n.,"Concord, CA",3,29,4,2.0,12/3/2009,"One notch above Dennys but 5 notches below Cheese Cake factory. Please Concord, bring something new and refreshing. This is NOT deep dish pizza. I first had BJs in SoCal when it was a small chain and the deep dish was Chicago style, but after getting bought out and going mainstream, I can now see its just another gross chain. Its really unfortunate this place will turn into another: Chilis, Chevys, Outback, Red Lobster, Fresh Choice etc etc etc But it seems like its some what busy so some townies stuck in the suburbs must enjoy greasy and favorless food."
Kenny P.,"Hercules, CA",9,53,3,4.0,12/30/2009,"This is the third BJ's I've been to in NorCal and I'm glad a decent place to eat has arrived @ Sun Valley. BJ's has a nice SportsBar vibe with a good selection of beers, numerous flat screen TVs and some of the best pizza around.  I agree it is not classic Chicago 'deep dish', but it's so light and tasty it more than makes up for that shortcoming.  I usually don't care for chain restaurants, but BJs - like PF Chang & Cheesecake Factory - are always consistantly good with a fun atmosphere.    Got a sweet tooth? Try a Pizookie!"
T L.,"Pittsburg, CA",5,30,1,3.0,12/9/2010,I'm not a big fan of BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse just because I feel like the some of the hostesses there are a bit rude and neglectful. But the servers are the best! I had Natalie as my server and I just really appreciated how she continued to check in with our table even during a  busy night. I was a bit ticked off but the fact that she didn't forget us made the night a little easier to enjoy.
yoyo v.,"San Pablo, CA",2,11,,4.0,4/26/2012,To put it in short. Our waitress Tammy is awesome! Service was promt friendly and professional. Me and my friends of nurses were well taken care of.
Lady K.,"Oakland, CA",69,9,,1.0,2/16/2013,Place sucks. Slow service  bad service. My family has been here two hours and my kids are just now eating. I will never come back.
Sara W.,"Livermore, CA",30,497,173,4.0,2/22/2011,"Great beer, good food and good service. Nothing remarkable or note worthy about the place... But at least it's consistent!"
Sara H.,"Frederick, MD",298,290,25,4.0,10/14/2009,"I went to BJ's in Orange County on a regular basis. They have solid beer and good food with a wide selection. We ate a small 1/2 southwestern and 1/2 bbq chicken pizza. They weren't that different from each other--it was hard to taste much difference. Then we had a Pazookie-yum!  I had the Robust Porter and my husband had the seasonal pumpkin ale. It was the best pumpkin ale I've had, but I don't generally like them. The spices were noticeable form the moment it my tongue but then the pumpkin hits. Overall we had a great experience. I'm glad BJ's is here and I'm glad there is a quality restaurant open late at night in concord. Mufasa the brewer was there but we didn't get a chance to meet him."
Natalie V.,"Hercules, CA",102,14,35,1.0,1/24/2012,"It took 15 min for someone to take drink orders.....took twice as long for food to come out! Why a LONG wait, especially when it's not busy! Service Sucks.... Root beer is  Delicious!  I should've learned after 2nd visit- thought we would give them them the benefit of the doubt- Never Again!"
cupcakefiend L.,"Walnut Creek, CA",1,16,,2.0,1/23/2012,my boyfriend and I went here for a late dinner after noticing that it was open. Big mistake.. At the beginning service was okay. The server got us our drinks and took or orders pretty quick. Then she served us our food and forgot we were even there. I had no silverware and she did not notice it missing from the table or me trying to get her attention. So I had to snag silverware from the table behind me which also wasn't wiped down properly. After we finished eating we had to wait 10 minutes to receive the check and another 20 after she took the card! Both the food and service the past 3 times I've been here have just been okay. But this time was bad. Would rather go to the cheesecake factory even their food is better & service over the top compared to bjs.
jamie j.,"Walnut Creek, CA",146,249,13,1.0,2/6/2011,"This place doesn't even deserve a star, but yelp wont allow any less. I went with a party of 8 people and it took 2 hours to a get a cobb sald (with dressing on the side)....no kidding. Took the waitress 30 minutes to tell me they don't have ginger ale. Cobb salad was disappointing and the meat on it was cubed processed deli meat (consistency of spam). I needed to leave early (since I hadn't anticipated that it would take this long to eat) and the waitress wouldn't let me pay since everyone wasn't leaving....what?!?!"
Traci J.,"El Cerrito, CA",1,12,12,2.0,3/21/2012,"My friends and I did not have a good experience at BJs. FIrst of all, I ordered a fish taco. Now I have had fish tacos before but this was just awful. It was nothing but a big fish stick wrapped in a tortilla. Had I known that, I would have ordered something else. Not only was my friend's pizza undercooked, but it was brought out after we had almost finished our meal. I guess they forgot about her order. Last but not least, there were two strands of hair in the ice cream in the pazookies. Gross. The waitress offered to bring another one out but by that time, we were done."
Gio M.,"Solano, CA",81,7,2,3.0,11/2/2011,"The Waitress was very nice but she was alright, she forgot to put in my friends order and lied that the kitchen was taking longer on his calzone. I don't think it takes 15 minutes for the kitchen to finish up his calzone. I will be coming back for the food but not the service, i recommend the Honey-Crisp Chicken Salad."
M G.,"Concord, CA",0,9,,2.0,11/18/2010,I have eaten here maybe five times.  The service is SO slow.  Don't eat here if you are in a hurry. The mixed drinks are good. The food is so-so to blah. Standard fare you  find at other restaurant chains. I've given this place to many chances.
