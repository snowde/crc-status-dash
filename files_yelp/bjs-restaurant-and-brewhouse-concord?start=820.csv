Cam S.,"Concord, CA",1,12,,4.0,6/9/2012,Food is good but we go mostly to get a drink for happy hour. Their beers are good I recommend Nutty Brewnette and Jeremiah red. What I really like is they have lots of beer on tab and a good selection of imported bottled beers.  They stay open late on weekends which is nice because its walking distance for us.
Sonila S.,"Concord, CA",0,7,1,4.0,4/25/2014,"Love their pizza! Bufflo chicken pizza is the best at bjs! Customer service is good not bad, sometimes they are a little slow the waiter or waitress but overall not a bad place to sit down and enjoy time with friends/family."
Sun L.,"Oakland, CA",133,21,30,4.0,9/7/2011,"Went to this place during me and my girlfriend's 18 month anniversary for dinner, the format of the restaurant looked like Fentons and Chessecake factory, as of the welcoming service, two of the waitresses didn't gave a friendly welcoming and just stared rudely as if i were lost. My girlfriend and I were eventually seated shortly about just a minute after we've walked in. Ordered the Cajun pasta and New Orlean Jambalaya Pasta, they were delicious! and i practically felt stuffed by the Cajun pasta while i was trying to finish the last bits of it!! i would definitely order any of the two on my next visit, foods were good, but quite pricier than i thought since it came out to be $30, but can't complain since it was our anniversary, didn't had to wait too long, and food was great!"
Alicia G.,"Concord, CA",0,5,,1.0,12/16/2013,I went out to lunch with a friend here and the service was terrible! We walked in and no one greeted us and we had to ask for silverware and napkins... The staff is just hanging out and talking to each other and their friends in the front of the restaurant. Completely unprofessional.
John W.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,5,,3.0,5/23/2012,"I go here for lunch periodically, and usually sit at the bar.  Bar service is good, with attentive staff.  My experience has been somewhat different in the dining area.  Last time I sat in the dining area service was slow, they forgot my salad, and when I did get it, it looked half finished compared to everyone else at the table (no croutons, smaller portion, etc.) Prices on the lunch menu are good, but does seem like portions might be getting smaller (chicken tenders).  Can't beat the lunch time beer price for house brews, which is the main reason I go.  Used to be $3, now up to $3.50, but still a good deal.  Food okay, menu items can be hit and miss depending what you get."
Audrey L.,"San Diego, CA",1,25,4,1.0,1/21/2013,"Last time I was here service sucked. We sat in this little table that was too small for both my boyfriend and I and were constantly subject to being bumped into by servers. In addition, our server kept forgetting my drink refillsAND my boyfriend had to keep asking for some horse radish for his steak and didn't get it until he was done eating. I wish I had remembered her name, but she was a white girl who was everything BUT attentive and good at her job. Today, I am here because I love BJs food, but service continues to suck at this location. Not only are tables sticky and chairs crummy upon seating new guests, but it takes a whole 15 to 20 minutes before you are approached by your server. Servers give guests evil glares as they are trying to get up from their tables, but happen to be in their way. All they had to say was EXCUSE ME. This place LACKS professionalism. I give only one star because I still love Pizookies."
Nancy M.,"San Francisco, CA",1,39,,4.0,7/17/2012,"I've been to this location at least 5 times. Their Calamari is delicious. Their beers are great although I am not a big beer drinker. I have ordered two of their cocktails and they are not the greatest. If I order a Martini I want a Martini not a glass of water with an olive. I have had their short order of ribs they were good, fell off the bone, but were a little on the greasy side, their Asian chicken salad was delicious, their burgers are good. My suggestions, is give your patrons a drink.  Leave the watered down drinks for someone who doesn't know drinks. I'd give you 5 stars if the drinks were real, and the ribs weren't so greasy. The other foods are good"
Jamie G.,"Concord, CA",119,18,,5.0,12/2/2010,The breakfast is GREAT... I love THIS PLACE! The parking is bad but the food is so good. The floor is slippery and my friend fell once! But it is worth it! (hahah)
Trent R.,"Antonito, CO",60,73,35,2.0,1/16/2011,Pizza was OK...service was lacking. They forgot my salad....Beer is overpriced...imho
Rachel A.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",27,21,2,5.0,11/18/2013,"My fiance and I were trying to think of a place that we could watch sunday night football. I don't particularly enjoy sports bars, so we came up with a happy medium: BJ's. The bar has a humongous TV that shows 4 different sports channels, so we elected to sit there. The bartender, Shane greeted us and let us know that he'll be right with us. I really appreciate when bartender's do this because the majority of the time I'm not sure if they know I'm there or not. They have happy hour whenever there's a sports game on, so we definitely took advantage of that! We ordered about 6  happy hour appetizers and they were all delicious! Shane was very knowledgeable and helpful when it came to deciding on our beverages. We asked for a couple beer tastes and I decided on a Berry Cider and my fiance asked for something lighter that the beer he tasted. Shane recommended that we combine the Berry Cider and Jeremiah Red. OMG!!!!!!! I'm thinking of going back just to have that beer!!!!!!!!!!! My fiance loved the blend, so we got a pitcher :-) Delicious beer, great food that I didn't have to cook, attentive service, and football!!!!! It was the best sunday ever!"
Vanessa J.,"Antioch, CA",115,28,,4.0,3/17/2011,I LOVE this place! Excellent food and drinks and great service.  My favorite is the parmesan crusted chicken and they have really good fried calamari.  I find it hard to leave without finishing my meal with a pizookie for dessert!
Jessica B.,"Martinez, CA",19,60,17,2.0,11/28/2010,"I've been to other Bj's and really enjoyed them.. however this location can't get their service up to par. First encounter with poor service was with the hostess. We were told the wait would be 35-40 minutes.  Well thats fine.. except it was an hour.  When were finally seated we immediately ordered waters and cocktails. Our waitress (albeit very nice) was our second encounter with poor service.  After assuming the she forgot our drink order completely our cocktails arrived but not our waters.  We then ordered apps and a pizza and waters.  After finishing out cocktails (and we're not fast drinkers) our pizza arrived and so did our waters.  Two problems here, one we had no silverware and two what happened to our appetizer?  We informed our waitress we would just like to cancel the app because we already had our main course.  She said it was ready and would bring it to us, complimentary.  Since there was no room on the table for it we just asked it be boxed up.  4 minutes later it was served to us by another member of their wait staff.  Whatever. The pizza is good here, but the service makes it not worth it.  Step it up BJ's!"
Joshua G.,"Ventura, CA",1,1,1,1.0,1/19/2013,"Okay, so first off, after a strenuous day I was finally reaching the perfect situation to release the troubles of the week into the abyss. I was with my wife and good friend with beer at the table and awaiting the arrival of an amazing burger. After a reasonable amount of time, I was served some irrelevant sandwich- the same kind your weird Italian roommate would make in between football and a bizarre laundry ritual. I was not too disappointed at this point, and after some contemplation decided to send it back to get the real burger that I desired. After watching the people who I love enjoy their meals, my burger arrived. This time the meat was not thoroughly cooked as the pink was so bright it was as if they were mocking me. I felt so badly for sending it back a second time, because usually I just take what I'm given even with mistakes. It was simply not edible- I did not go there to enjoy raw meat. The manager came to the table to apologize, and she seemed sincere but I feel it was façade. I understand that being a manager of a restaurant and brewery is demanding, and I would feel the same. After all it wasn't her fault. But to express my experience at this restaurant, it was not worth what we paid, and to make multiple mistakes on one order is simply not acceptable. When it comes down to it, the Wendys in Fremont is so much more superior. Their Frosty's are impeccable, and the burgers are amazingly delicious without being overpriced. Wendy's in Fremont never disappoints, but if you head this way, you will not be impressed. We all make errors, but after a week of dealing with the problems we all face, Weny's in Fremont is the only place that can suffice."
Angela G.,"Dublin, CA",40,14,,5.0,1/16/2012,"All I can say is that I'm crazy for the Nutty Brunette draft beer. I did the little sampler and all beer choices were exceptional, but now when I visit this place with my husband that is my favorite drink of choice. the staff is wonderful and precise with our food. I also love that they offer the NFL Ticket there."
Chia C.,"Oakland, CA",70,186,18,1.0,8/4/2010,"This place was pretty terrible. The service blew my mind. I am in awe of how slow the servic was and how not on top of things the staff was. Hate to say it, but I will be back. I mean, there is nothing else in the mall worth eating."
Cammie K.,"Brentwood, CA",0,15,,4.0,8/13/2010,"In my opinion, great food and nice atmosphere.  Cool selection of mixed drinks and various beers. Never too long of a wait, the most I've had to wait is 10 mins. Friendly staff and plenty of TVs for your entertainment needs."
Elizabeth D.M. A.,"Pittsburg, CA",0,2,,1.0,2/22/2014,"So my children and I arrived we we seated fairly quick, but we left after a 1/2 hr of no waiter. No one came to our table and offered drinks or anything."
Patricia R.,"San Francisco, CA",0,18,,2.0,1/6/2013,"We'd been to BJ's before and had slow service, but decided to give it another try. Boy, we were disappointed. Went in for an early dinner (5:00) and were seated quickly. Waitress walked by our table on the way to others several times and didn't stop or make eye contact.  I think most people are ok waiting a bit (at least I am)  if you at LEAST acknowledge that you know they are there, so perhaps a little more training on the basic customer service would be advised.   Another party was seated nearby and they sat for about 5 minutes and a manager approached their table and asked if anyone had been by. She apologized and took their order.  We flagged the manager down and explained we'd been there a LOT longer and nobody had approached us either. She apologized and took our order as well.  Did not write anything down. Server FINALLY stopped by and apologized for the wait too.  After waiting about a half hour, the same manager walked by and said our meal was ""coming right up."" 15 minutes later, they brought it out. One of the meals was completely wrong (not what was ordered) and they had to remake it, which took - no kidding - another 30 minutes.  A different manager brought out the corrected meal and said they wouldn't charge us for that meal.  I explained what had happened and from that point on, our waitress was rude.  I didn't bag on her at all, I just explained what happened during our visit.  Before we ever received our meal, the other table that came in AFTER us had FINISHED their meals and already left!   We should have left when we were ignored for so long and taken it as a sign of things to come.  BJ's, we'll be checking out different mall options going forward!  And as a side note - not a good idea for servers to wear heavy scents - the perfume was overwhelming!"
Ed Y.,"Hercules, CA",0,25,3,1.0,7/8/2010,"Should be zero rating. Do not bother to dine here.  It was the worst dining experience of my life.  Waited at least 30 minutes until they figured out who the waiter should be for our table while surrounding tables who were seated after us were already being served food!  Then when we finally ordered, the first plate of food came 45 minutes later.  The deep dish pizza was awful. The crust was not fully cooked and soggy.  The pizza's taste was bland and salty. Don't waste your time, money, patience and stomach here.  You are better off going to one of the places inside Sun Valley mall which isn't saying much.  You have been warned!  Walk away."
upper d.,"San Francisco, CA",0,51,1,2.0,2/16/2011,"I usually love coming to BJ's for the deep dish pizza, the wings, the beer, the atmosphere and of course the pizookie. But my experience at this particular location was a disappointment. I ordered my usual buffalo chicken pizza. They came out with the barbecue chicken pizza instead! I kindly reminded our waitress that I ordered the buffalo chicken and she took it back whit a smile on her face. I thought, no problem, just a little mix up, mistakes happen... To my surprise, they basically scraped off the cheese and most of the barbecue sauce, spread a little buffalo sauce, sprinkled some cheese and more chicken, put it in the oven and served that to me. It tasted nothing like the buffalo chicken pizza. All I could taste was the barbecue sauce and I just could not enjoy my meal as much as I tried! I was so upset but so damn hungry that I just ate it. I also didn't want to make a big deal since I was with a group of friends and we were all having such a great time. But I usually call the freakin manager over and make a scene and demand that they make things right or my meal is on the house. I still love BJ's restaurant and brewhouse -__- But next time my order better come out perfect."
