Jessica J.,"Concord, CA",6,11,,5.0,2/8/2011,If you are looking for delicious food at reasonable prices & brews this is the place to visit.  I've been here quite a bit and I absolutely can say each time I visit it's GREAT!!!  No bad reviews for me.  This is definitely a favorite on my list.
Brett F.,"Danville, CA",235,38,6,1.0,7/16/2013,"I have a bone to pick with this place, so first the service sucks! i mean really this is the worst. I feel like i'd like this place more if they just spit in my food and gave it to me within a reasonable amount of time, then having to wait 30-45 minutes for a cheese burger. I am saying this not only during the slow times, but even in the busy times. I've caught my waiter/waitress on their phones and chit chatting instead of refilling my drink, or while holding my freshly poured beverage. secondly, the foods not that good. lastly, i lost my wallet here about a year ago and it took over 2 months to finally get the General Manager to look at the security tapes. after seeing that he couldn't make out if i put my wallet on the table or not he concluded that he couldn't help me further and that's how my problem was resolved. oh and in those 2 months i was on the phone with some guy claiming to be manager, who kept saying he would call me back and never did. i ended up speaking to 3 ""managers"" and non could help me. I HAVE NEVER BEEN BACK SINCE! Try lucille's bbq next store! its waayyyyy better!"
Stephen B.,"Folsom, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/3/2011,"Food was very bland and left me feeling sick; Mens bathroom was littered with wet towels on the floor and pouring out of receptacle; Wait staff seems to be overwhelmed easily; One Manager in particular seemed to be acting very inappropriately with the 16 year old hostesses. Not sure the Manager's name but he had a Boston like accent. Just a terrible place to spend your money, might as well give it away to the Casino located down the road. At least then it's momentarily exciting."
Mike T.,"Harrison Township, NJ",35,90,121,2.0,1/10/2011,"Like many other people have mentioned, do not go here if you have anything you are planning to do later. Slow. Yes it was busy, and I get that, but they were so disorganized! I laughed when I read the review about the hostesses not knowing what they were doing. There were 3 hostesses and a manger all standing in there little command center up front, and all with that wax museum or deer in headlights look. I turned in my name and stood with my wife (8 months pregnant) for over an hour. To be fair, I was told it would be 45 minutes, so I went to the command center to get an ETA on our table. She asked for my name, then asked me how many in my party. Um, no, I've been standing here in front of you for over an hour, I didn't just walk in. I told her that I had checked in with her over an hour ago, and she calls a huddle with the rest of the crew. No one knew what happened, or how my name disappeared from their computer, so I was told that our table was coming up soon. The funny thing was, someone else complained about the wait earlier, and I heard one of the hostesses comment that there was a pregnant lady that has been waiting a long time too. Once again, I know that it's busy. But if you see that you are seating people ahead of people that have become a fixture in front of you, you may want to check on your ""system"".  So we get seated at a table near the back of the room. A booth for the pregnant lady would have been nice instead of the wooden chair, there were plenty available, but whatever. We then wait 10 more minutes as servers walk by. A couple of guys get seated at a booth behind us and order drinks. I couldn't even grab anyone's attention to find out which server was ours. The guys at the booth behind us get their drinks. I was about to sneak water off one of the empty tables when I decided I had enough. I went back to the command center, but the manager had gone off somewhere, so I asked the Three-headed hostess if we had a server. They said they would check on it. Our server apologized, and was friendly, but everything was still slow. No refills on drinks, and took a while to get our check. Our server suspected we didn't have a great experience, so he got us a free dessert. Add one star. So 3 hours after we walked in, we were walking out to our car, wondering how we ended up in the BJ's time machine again. Were we going to some movie or something after this? Am I late for work? What day is it? Quick Marty, your parents are in trouble back in 1985, get in the car!"
Gordon C.,"Oakland, CA",56,201,58,2.0,5/21/2010,"If it wasn't for the large beer selection, I would give them just 1 star. It was over an hour wait when we got to the restaurant. We decided to just check out the bar and see if we get lucky and find a table and not wait for an hour.  It was so crowded we could barely even drink our beers without elbowing someone. About a half hour later we got a table at the bar. However it took another 20 minutes to have a server come and greet us and take our order. We ordered a pitcher of their Indian red beer and a large combination. Beer was nice and cold. Pizza seemed like it was pre-made and barely warm or was sitting out for a long time. The cheese wasn't  even melted all the way through. The server didn't even come back after delivering the pizza to our table for us to complain about the cold pizza. Very poor service. Come for the beer and sit at the bar."
Lindsey M.,"Seattle, WA",8,151,,3.0,7/14/2011,"Some good beers on tap (their own.)  Some great salads, sandwiches, and oven brick pizzas.  I love the pizookie and ice cream.  Unfortunately I've experienced a lot more bad service than good service, even for their take-out!  They've messed up orders, forgotten about us, my waiter ALWAYS seems to take a break in the middle of our meal so I always get a second server, and only once out of about half a dozen times has my salad dressing ever come out on the side, (my one and only ordering quirk.)  Given the menu, it's a great alternative to Applebees and Friday though."
Mary G.,"Martinez, CA",1,3,,5.0,3/1/2010,"I'm pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoy BJ's. I am not a fan of restaurants at malls due to the fact that they are usually so busy all the time but BJ's is different. I've never had to wait long for a table and their employee's are super friendly. Their menu is extensive, which makes choosing something difficult with so many choices. Everything I've had there has been wonderful.  They have a great full bar but I've only had their beers, which are great!! Its refreshing to have yet another choice for good food and beer in Concord. As I've stated before....sick of the Mexican & Chinese restaurants on every corner of the Bay Area.  Great addition to Concord!!"
Michelle Q.,"Los Angeles, CA",75,24,4,4.0,9/1/2013,"BJ's is definitely my go to place when I want to grab dinner with friends. We arrived around 8pm and It was fairly busy. Theyre usually really busy weekend nights so expect a wait. However we got seated fairly quickly. Our server was Alex and he was quite friendly, they have a big menu so my friend and I took a while to.order but Alex was super helpful with the menu and patient with us.  We took forever to decide lol. I ordered the creole tilapia and my friend ordered the tuscan chicken limone. Both were very delicious and for dessert we had the pizookie trio. It was yummy! Everytime I come here I always get the pizookie, its a must! The atmosphere is very chill and they usually always have the game on so its perfect for sports fans."
Fred D.,"American Canyon, CA",76,8,,1.0,11/11/2012,Food was terrible because the service was awful please save yourself a lot of time and eat at a different restaurant
Marissa M.,"Clayton, CA",2,54,3,2.0,11/12/2010,"Had lunch with my mother here yesterday. It was Veteran's day so there was a 20 minute wait, understandable. We took advantage of the lunch specials, the specialty salad with added soup for 1 dollar extra. I had the honey crisp salad and my mom had the cobb. The salad itself was good but mine had like a chicken finger on top, and my mother's deli turkey. The soups were nothing special, we had minestrone and broccoli cheddar. The wine was good though (haha). The waitress was very nice, but the place was very busy. The gal that brought our soups was very short and pretty much threw the soups at us. I was a little disappointed because of the good things I'd heard BJ's."
S C.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",0,34,4,1.0,8/12/2013,"On Saturday night, my kids and I were seated outside on the patio for dinner. After 20 minutes of sitting without seeing a server, another group was being seated next to us so I asked the hostess if a server could come greet us and take our order. Before the server, Jonathan, could get out, 2-3 more tables had been sat after we had sat on the patio for all this time alone other than another couple who was already finished and just hanging out.  Jonathan FINALLY shows up and proceeds to take all the orders around us and was heading back in until I spoke up. The service went even worse from there. My beer comes in a warm glass so it was barely cold when I did finally receive it. By now, the patio is filled up. 30 minutes go by and not a word from the server. Other tables around us were getting their food who had arrived and ordered after us. I ask about our food from another server who had brought items to other surrounding tables. She finally finds our food and my girls' burgers weren't even hot and my son's macaroni and cheese was a big blob with the top crusted over and dry from sitting under the heat lamps too long. Disgusting. He barely ate it and just had apple sauce. I would have sent it back but I doubted that we wold have ever seen it again so poor thing, he just ate what he could of it. My girls picked at their burgers and left most of it on the plate.  Jonathan's customer service skills leave A LOT to be desired and if I was sat in his section again, if I ever go there again - which will be a LONG time - I would ask to be moved.  Drinks didn't get refilled until we were literally minutes away from leaving. I had to ask for my bill and we waited 10 minutes for Jonathan to return with it so we could leave. I spent $50 for a horrible dinner and even worse customer service. For the money you spend at BJ's, do yourself a favor and go someplace else. Their service is ALWAYS, notoriously slow but this was ridiculous. I definitely feel like I got robbed of my $50."
Ryan E.,"Woodacre, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/18/2012,"sucks!!!! dont go to this terrible restaurant!  rude servers, wait forever for food,  awful!"
A. H.,"Benicia, CA",15,95,5,1.0,1/27/2012,"This place is WHACK! only go here if you want to wait forever, be ignored by the staff and never get a drink... the food is decent but not worth waiting 2 hours for. Been here 4 times and walked out the last time, gave my $50.00 gift card to someone else, this place sucks."
chris a.,"Concord, CA",3,37,3,1.0,11/18/2010,"I went here for the first time back in October, for lunch.  The place was pretty empty, yet they managed to take forever to bring me my food and the order was wrong (how do you manage to mess up soup?) So I decided I'd give the place one more try.  My boyfriend and I were seated very quickly, drink order taken and appetizer dish brought out fast!  I was thining great...this place has changed for the better...that was my first mistake.  After waiting over 30 minutes for our meal to come out, it finally did only his was the totally wrong dish!  Not at all what he ordered.  My drink was never refilled and at $2.25 a pop, I shouldn't have to chase anyone down for a refill.  After another 20 minute wait he gets his order.  My pizza was so so, not hot so it gets cold fast.  It was awful that him and I didnt' get to eat dinner at the same time. So we decide that we'll order dessert, ugh mistake number 2.  We waited over 25 minutes for them to bring out a brownie dish, and it was not even cooked.  That's right...it was RAW!!  It took us over 1 1/2 hours to ""eat"" at this place, and that is just unacceptable.  The manager did take the raw brownie and my boyfriends meal off the bill, however with two bad experiences here, I won't ever be going back there again. It's a shame that such a new restaurant is going down hill so fast."
Emily R.,"Frederick, MD",29,67,,1.0,9/26/2010,"There were so many tortilla strips in my salad, I thought it was a plate of nachos. Awful."
Treesa M.,"Russian Hill, San Francisco, CA",21,27,1,3.0,7/19/2010,Mmmm 1/2 berry cider 1/2 amber ale is so refreshing to drink on the patio on a nice day! Love the bruschetta. The menu is a bit overwhelming... I stick to the drinks and appetizers either at the bar or on the patio.
Jens M.,"Antioch, CA",40,9,1,4.0,10/19/2011,I love BJ's Restaurant ever since my Dad introduced me to the place in Cerritos (one of the best). Now that we live just a couple of miles from the Sunvalley location I'm definitely going to keep coming back. I only gave it 4 stars because their pizza could use a lot more cheese. The last two pies I ordered from them barely had any!
Grace C.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",95,5,2,1.0,4/13/2010,"WORST COSTUMER SERVICE EVER! i was there on march 12th wanting to celebrate my birthday it was a friday so of course it was packed and i wasn't stupid so i actually called on the tuesday before that to make a reservation for 15 people i even called twice just to make sure that they got my time and date and everything right my reservation was at 9:30pm on friday and the manager did confirmed it okay, i knew that all of my friends were gonna be late so i even told my friends to be there at 9pm and a few of my friends actually got there at 9pm sharp, while i was still at another friend's place getting ready so when my friends got there at 9, i asked them to check in for me first when i got there at about 15 min after 9, they were still waiting for the table well, that was reasonable since my reservation was at 9:30 so i sat down and waited when most of my friends arrived at around 9:30-9:40 we were still waiting patiantly but we waited and waited and waited OMG! it was 10 o'clock already! so i couldn't take it anymore and went up to the host and ask what was going on (since i asked once at 9:40 already and the host said that the last table is on dessert already so our table would be ready soon) and at 10pm, the same host, gave me an answer ""your reservation was at 8 o'clock and we kept it for you for 10 min but you didn't show up, so we gave the table to other people."" I was like WTF!?!?!? HELLO~then what was the point for me leaving my phone number here? and the last time i asked you said the table was almost ready? that just wasn't right and all of us were starving so we just left and went eat at somewhere else i mean, that's how you treat your customers? im never coming to this place ever again (i mean, just the particular location, i went to other BJ's, they were all pretty nice)"
Sheila T.,"Oakley, CA",9,21,,4.0,8/1/2010,"Okie dokie so 2 stars for the food, everything I have ordered here up to date has been very good , I highly suggest that if you like cheese sticks to order the cheese sticks, the ingredients used to make them is so fresh it is amazing.  The ingredients used to make everything that they sell are so fresh its amazing.  1 star for how quickly we were seated, it was pretty packed and they told us about 20 minutes but we really only waited about 8-10 so I was pleased with their time management.  1 more star just because I like this place, the atmosphere is great and there is a bunch of huge TVs everywhere.  Minus 1 star because our waitress was one of the fakest girls I've ever had serve me and she had the inability to actually listen. I orderd the fettucini alfredo (chicken free) and it came with chicken on it, which was fine I just took the chicken home to my dogs, but if I were on a budget it would matter because the dish is 2 bucks more with the chicken.  For desert we ordered the chocolate pizooki with chocolate chips and batter and she failed to listen and brought normal chocolate chip, we did not want to wait for them to prepare another so we just ate it and it tasted good, however I still firmly believe that the waitress was a bimbo. So other than that, this place is good and you should still go there if you want good food and good if not great service."
Kathy B.,"Pacheco, CA",1,11,,1.0,1/13/2012,"Our recent visit was possibly the worst dining experience I have ever had.  Service was slow and off, food was cold and bun on hamburger was more than stale, it was hard. Burger was broken into two pieces and way overcooked (no one asked how I wanted it done)  Someone arrived at our table delivering our side of fries which we did not order - and looked at us as if we were crazy when we looked bewildered. The manager came over and gave us a long song and dance about how the corporation is great and personall oversaw the redoing of my burger and IT WAS WORSE than the 1st one.  They did not charge us for the burger but I will likely never go here again.  There are a least two places (not corporate) restaurants near by that serve great burger at way better prices (Chef Burger on Golf Club Rd & El Tapatio on Golf Club Rd - they have great mexican food AND great burger and steak sandwich) Take my advise and go local and stay away from BJs!!!"
