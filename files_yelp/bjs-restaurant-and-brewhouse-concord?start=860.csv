Ken L.,"San Francisco, CA",88,407,28,1.0,6/17/2010,"What the fuck happened to this place? It was average food for high prices to begin with, but now, where do I begin. Our lunch crew came here on Wednesday. We had to wait to be seated because it's always busy now for some unknown reason. Our waiter took a while to first come to us, and then he asked us what drinks we wanted. He also asked about appetizers, which I'm kind of tired of being asked about. I'm just here for lunch man - give me my food - let me the fuck out. And their prices are ridiculous already; I don't need to pay more for something none of us want.  Our waiter disappears, then comes back with our drink orders, then takes our lunch orders...finally. He leaves, times passes, and some unknown dude, let's call him X, comes to our table with some soup. Who ordered the blah blah blah soup. You know who? Nobody at this fucking table! That's who. Ironically, sadly, my friend did order soup, but that one was not it. So our main dishes come out, which is served by some unknown person, let's call her Y. All around us it seems like they are trying to deliver the food by some method of random selection. Maybe if I just throw the food up in the air at some random table, maybe, just maybe, it will land at the correct table. Whatever system they are using, it sucks! Girl Y goes away after laying down 3 of the 4 plates of food, I think. It's gotten very confusing at this point, even for me. I can't remember who delivers plate 4, but my friend eventually flags down our waiter to bring out her soup. I look at her right after she takes her first taste of soup, or chili, or whatever it was. Uh, she looks like she has just eaten chili flavored with cat piss, which is what she says it tastes like. I wonder if it can really be that bad, so in my ignorance I try some. Wow, I don't know what it taste like, but it taste really weird, and I don't blame her for not eating another bite.  On to the other friend's, who got sandwiches, delivered COLD! They are not supposed to be cold if you are wondering. Oh, and I think stale bread was pretty much the norm. My fish was okay, but the best part of everyone's meal was the chips, errrr, fries. We contemplated whether they ordered them from McDonald's though.  I don't know if the entire regular staff was home watching the World Cup, which I hope is the case for them, but even if not, I doubt we will make our way back here. Massive Fail. Gargantuan Fail. Fail the size of Colossal Squid. Hrm, should I go there? Dear BJ's, your food now taste like bad cigarette tinged cum, and your wait staff are like the sperm that can't figure out how to make it to the damn egg. Was that in bad taste? Well, you are now in bad taste."
Dustin S.,"Concord, CA",74,18,7,3.0,8/28/2010,"The beer is ok, the food is great! Very loud sports bar feel. I feel as though I'm at the espn zone in Vegas.  The pizza is fantastic! The beer is typical, nothing special for being a ""brewhouse."" Great place to go if you're trying to avoid the annoyance of the mall but still being at the mall."
Eric S.,"Walnut Creek, CA",122,56,11,2.0,8/28/2010,"This particular BJ's was not good. I had the crispy chicken sandwich with the seasoned wedge fries and a Mt. Dew. First off Pepsi sucks and is a horrible way to start a meal. The chicken sandwich tasted like it had been fried in the same batter the fish was fried in, and subsequently tasted more like fish than it did fried chicken. And without seeing it, I would of thought I was eating fish... The seasoned potato wedges were under ""cooked"". They weren't even crispy in anyway and were almost raw potato in the middle of the larger wedges. The waitress was nice mostly prompt with her service."
La C.,"San Francisco, CA",82,1052,45,3.0,6/16/2010,"I guess we picked the wrong day for a birthday dinner celebration.  The place was packed thanks to the Lakers/Celtics game.  We arrived around 7 and were quoted a 40 min wait, we waited a little less than that.  Our waiter took forever to come to the table and we were famished.  We placed our orders and proceeded to wait and wait, finally we got our appetizer but 2 mins later our entrees arrived.  The food is good and large portions but not gourmet by any means.  I rather enjoyed the avocado rolls.  We also shared the dessert trio and scored a free one for the birthday girl so we got to taste all the cookies, the peanut butter was my favorite.  I do not know, if it wasn't for this being the birthday girl's request I would have left and happily ate at Claimjumpers instead.  Parking was pretty harsh too, jammed packed.  Overall ok and that's it. P.S.  the TV went out for about 10 mins during the game and the manager came by to explain that their circuit blew out, we honestly didn't care but other patrons were freaking out."
Shelly M.,"San Ramon, CA",0,5,,1.0,12/22/2011,Not gluten free!!! They don't substitute gluten free choices for the gluten containing items on the menu so your order is very sparse when it arrives.  They clearly made a mistake on my order and scraped MOST of it off the plate to fix it.  The waitress had no idea what gluten was.  Stay away if you are intolerant.
margot b.,"Santa Rosa, CA",2,55,2,5.0,7/4/2011,"Now I was only here for a pint while waiting for the Sun Valley Shopping Mall to open but I will definitely return. They have a tremendous amount of beers on tap including their own variety and Bartender Stacy was a delight to kill some time with. Love their seasonal beer ""Nit Wit."""
Christopher F.,"Watsonville, CA",2,17,,2.0,6/30/2013,"Food is good, service is dreadful. Hostess stands with back to the door and can't figure out seating. Absentee waiters abound. Only getting the second star because pizookies are crazy good."
Michael D.,"Lafayette, CA",59,74,10,4.0,3/16/2011,"The reviews are all over the board, but we had a great experience with the kids. Our servers were incredibly great...always there and yet not intrusive. I was even given a couple samples of beer to make sure I picked the right one. Very nice. They have an amazing selection of beers -- some of the best selections in Contra Costa County -- just don't always select the house brews which they push for obvious reasons. The pizzas and salads were top notch. Nice job BJ's, we will be back."
Ashley Z.,"Oakley, CA",0,15,,2.0,9/10/2013,"I have been to several BJ's in the bay area and this one was one of the worst. It's quite a bit smaller than the other BJ's Ive been to. I didn't have to wait that long for seating, but my table was practically squished up against another table that was pretty noisy. They completely messed up the our order and took a good 30 minutes to correct it. It was lettuce wraps. I can't imagine how hard it could be to throw the ingredients on the plate considering the eater assembles it themselves. The chicken I ordered was cold and didn't have enough seasoning but I just wanted out of there so I decided to just pay and leave. Wont be coming back"
Jim L.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",1,117,1,4.0,3/13/2011,"I love this chain. There are few places where you can get Black Cherry Soda and this is one or at least the chain is, not all the restaurants carry it but many do. If you're into beer or cider, this is the place for you. Ironically, I hated it the very first time I visited. Not sure why, it was a different restaurant though and not the one in Pleasant Hill. The place can be very crowded so I often opt for less popular times. Trying to make a ""reservation"" is a joke. They say they put you down on their list but I've found this unreliable and simply don't go when I think it will be crowded. Service is pretty good for Pleasant Hill."
Roberto F.,"Twin Peaks, San Francisco, CA",0,53,,5.0,2/17/2012,"Good food and I love the pazooki desert. Also very impressed with the management . The male manager who corrected our to go order was very professional. He even came out to personally explain the situation, and then brought our order out himself. He also credited our dinner for the delay. Again that made me very happy and completely made up for any issue. I will be going back soon."
RedCub S.,"Dublin, CA",21,85,,3.0,6/19/2011,We recently visited for lunch with my father in law and toddler in tow. So we needed a place that had something for everyone and we found it.  The menu is expansive and the food was really good.  Will definitely try again.
Suzie F.,"Concord, CA",125,3,,2.0,8/26/2013,"Went to a late dinner (8 p.m.)  The waitrwss was unfriendly.    Food was fair, but not exactly what was ordered.  20 + minutes to get waitress to acknowledge us even though the place was not busy.  Do not think we will being going back anytime soon."
J T.,"Concord, CA",0,1,,2.0,11/25/2013,"The food isn't bad tasting, but the wait for food and drink is horrible. You don't know what you are getting on your plate because the menu doesn't seem to describe it right. If you plan on having more than one drink I would order two at a time, or you could be waiting 20 minutes for your first beer. I've been twice hoping the second time would be better, but in fact it was worse. I will not go anymore."
Anne P.,"Richmond, CA",1,11,,2.0,11/21/2009,"I love BJs and had eaten at the one in SSF and Vacaville... super-stoked to find out that it was opening nearby in Concord!! My BF and I arrived last Thursday night around 9pm. The wait wasn't long.  We order a Sprite, beer, avocado eggrolls, soups, and 2 New York Strip steaks - I ask for ""medium rare."" Instead of Sprite, I get a watered down drink and ask the waiter for another one. After the fact he tells me that it's Sierra Mist, which is still fine. So after several minutes, I notice that that he still didn't replace my drink. I had to ask another waiter who was delivering my BF's beer for another drink. The Sierra Mist was watered down again, so I just asked for a Pepsi - tasted better.  Then..... we get our soups and then our steaks... wtf.... what about the avocado eggrolls?? (I heard our waiter repeat the order and it did include the eggrolls.) They had been forgotten as the cooks in the back started to make it as soon as we mentioned we didn't get them. Anyways we start on our steaks, I not so adamently.  The steak was already cold waiting several minutes for someone to bring us A1 steak sauce and kethcup -  the manager finally did. At this time they realize their bad service. Great, so we get our eggrolls and then as I take a couple more bites of my steak and really look at it.... I realize it is not ""medium rare""... it is just rare... pink throughout and did not taste cooked at all........ WTF again! **Okay, who are you hiring.. were these people screened so you know that they can cook a freakin' steak, right??**  Anyone can easily undercook steak which is all about ""TIMING"" & attention. When you mess up on a NY strip, sorry, but it's almost unforgiveable. So finally after the waiter apologized sincerely and the manager offered free dessert and for us to only pay for the drinks (a small bill to pay under horrible circumstances).... I couldn't believe that this happened..... this has never happened to me before........... I gave a hefty tip because after all that, the manager and our waiter were trying to reach out to us and I didn't want to short-change anyone who was actually doing their job right."
Kris A.,"Danville, CA",6,24,2,5.0,1/11/2011,Love the great white pizza and the triple chocolate boozkie.
Alyssa G.,"San Francisco, CA",848,520,103,4.0,2/21/2010,"BJ's feels very much like a gigantic sports bar. It probably is. I joined a friend for Happy Hour here on Thursday. We walked in a bit early (nearly 4pm) and headed straight for the bar. Our bartender was energetic, helpful and very knowledgeable about all their draft beers....and trust me there's a lot!  I like when places give you samples to try before you buy. She definitely helped us out there...I was able to sample a ""Nutty Brunette"" and a ""Jeremiah Red."" Gotta go with the red for round 1. After talking and drinking, I realized that I was starting to feel a bit loopy and ordering food would be the best idea. Mini Pizzas were 1/2 off, and so of course we had to get one: Margherita Mini deep-dish pizza. Not salty, felt a bit light yet filling enough to eliminate the buzz. That can't happen so we decided to order another round...this time she let us sample the Lindeman's Framboise, and a pear sparkling cider (sorry, didn't catch the name). Lindeman's Framboise was my choice, a sweet raspberry fizzy cider-like beverage. Not as heavy as a malt beverage like Mike's Hard Lemonade. By the time we were done, the restaurant had filled up and the room was a-flutter with people talking about how glad they are to be done with work for the day. Never knew there were this many people in Pleasant Hill. Good to know. Total: $25ish for 4 alcoholic drinks and a mini-pizza"
Angie M.,"El Cerrito, CA",14,58,182,2.0,6/21/2010,Menu was not appealing whatsoever. I ordered ribs and they didn't even have any and this was Sunday in the afternoon (first day off NBA playoffs may I add)! First time experience was pretty lame. Doubt I will ever return.
Leo S.,"Martinez, CA",47,3,,5.0,8/13/2013,Went there to have dinner with the wife. Say down and waited 40 min for drinks. My wife got her dinner before our appetizers it was just horrid inconsistent service never walked out of a place but this was ridiculous!!
Christine D.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",4,48,79,2.0,1/3/2013,I have tried over and over to give this place the benefit of the doubt. The food is great but the service is HORRIBLE. Too bad because I really want to like it! They have an incredible variety of delicious food but I don't have 1.5 hours to spend on a lunch.
