Chanel F.,"Martinez, CA",9,40,,5.0,2/10/2011,"This place made my top 5 restraunts as soon as it opened. Amazing food. Huge selection reminds me a lot of cheesecake factory. Love everything have yet to have bad food or bad service. I love their calzones, egg rolls, clam chowder and well everything else."
Rishi C.,"Pittsburg, CA",2,2,,2.0,10/26/2013,"Not so great service ... It is a Saturday afternoon 9 including me at the bar , sitting for 15 mins not even asked once if I needed anything while 2 bartenders standing on the far end talking ... Let's wait n see if I get a drink this afternoon ... Luckily the TV is on"
Charles O.,"Fairfield, CA",0,2,,2.0,10/24/2013,"The service makes this a poor choice for lunch.  The service at this BJ's restaurant is extremely slow.  I ordered soup and salad....a fairly simple request....but it took 25 minutes for the soup to get to the table.  Your original waiter or waitress generally do not bring out your food so they have no idea of the quality of service you receive.  Any requests made to the waiter/waitress usually gets missed by the person delivering the food. The menu offers numerous choices....most of which are good, but the quality of service over shadows the food."
Beatrice T.,"Los Angeles, CA",303,358,101,4.0,4/4/2010,"I try not to hit up the chain restaurants but for an oreo pizookie and cheeseburger pizza.. I am easily steered =) The bbq chicken salad is also really good but with all the cheese and fried onions on top, I hesitate to even call it a salad.  And I actually prefer their jambalaya over the popular Cheesecake Factory version.  Prices are a tad steep considering that the small pizza was ~$16?  Regardless, I'll be back!"
Bebe E.,"San Francisco, CA",239,107,7,2.0,1/4/2010,"Let's get this straight, food gets 2 stars, management gets 1, but our server, Candi, gets a 5 star rating.  I would even give her 6 if it was possible. But let me explain the distribution.  My buddy and I came here one night, we hadn't seen each other in months since he'd moved out to walnut creek, and BJs is always a chill, laid back place to go, throw back a few beers, pay too much for barely decent food, but a fun sports bar atmosphere. If you want to actually read a review for the food/beer, please see others reviews on this place.  Mine is for the service. Candi is an incredibly friendly, outgoing gal.  Everytime I've been to a BJs in my life, the servers do the bare minimum to skim along acceptable service and recieve their tip.  Candi kept my friend and I entertained all night, gave us great suggestions on the menu, I felt like we had bonded to become best friends in the 2 hours we sat at her booth.  Basically, some of the greatest service I have EVER received, not only at BJs, but at any restaurant I've been to.  And as I work in the restaurant industry, I should know how service should be.   Anyways, as the night goes on, she tells us how ever since she had her son, guys don't leave their numbers like they used to.  Well after we had paid, i prompted my buddy to leave our numbers because not only was it kind of an ongoing joke with her, but she seemed like a really fun girl for my friend to chill with.   So on the way out, I ask to speak to the manager.  Give him a glowing review of our experience, and walk out of the restaurant, beaming because she just made our night.   Well lo and behold, she leaves us a voicemail later that night saying that her manager thought we had been friends of hers and she asked us to tell him that she had done a great job.  excuse my language but WTF!?!?!?! how unprofessional can you be? Just because I'm a young adult and still in college, you disrespect my opinion?  Well sir, I will not be gracing your restaurant with my presence ever again and to be honest, Candi is too good to serving in your dump of a corporate chain, and I hope she moves on to bigger and better things. /end vent."
Mary L.,"Concord, CA",68,10,,2.0,9/12/2010,"We used to come here every Saturday for lunch, but I don't think we will be any more. The past two visits have been disappointing with orders screwed up and food tasting . . .well, just not as good, I guess. Just seems to be getting sloppy overall and it's too bad. The drinks are creative and the margarita flat bread pizza is tasty, but being told by our server that the Mac and cheese my son ordered was straight out of the box Kraft, getting soggy calamari and a chicken salad missing the chicken - well, I can find plenty of other places in this price range that care more about a customer's experience than turning a table."
Lauren S.,"Lafayette, CA",102,153,25,5.0,2/18/2010,I love their happy hour menu!! Everything appetizer is $2 off and select drinks are like $5 each so I loaded up on shots and their California Club flatbread pizza! So good and its big enough to share between two guys and one girl. :) Staff is super friendly too and the bar area is huge! Ample parking outside and convenient location from the freeway! Can't wait to return for another happy hour rendevous!
Carl T.,"Oakley, CA",59,12,,4.0,7/7/2010,"My daughter suggested this place the other day when we were at the Sunvalley Mall. I'm glad we went, because we were not disappointed.  The food and beers are really good.   When seated, the first thing you notice is the extensive menu.  I think it's over 15 pages long.  Plenty of choice, that's for sure.  We started with an order of the deep fried cheese sticks.  They were cooked perfectly and the mozzarella cheese inside tasted like they had just made the cheese sticks by hand in back from fresh mozzarella.  We asked our server if they were made fresh, but she didn't know.  She promised to ask, but she never did, so I don't know the answer.  I do know that we are, as embarrassed as I am to say it, cheese stick connoisseurs, and these were some of the best we have ever had.   I had the Blonde beer as a drink.  It was light and tasted like  a fine ""German"" beer.  I liked it very much.  For my meal, I had the BBQ beef sandwich with the thin cut fries.  The meal was delicious.  The beef was nice and tender and had just the right amount of sauce.  But the best part was the bun.  Fresh, soft on the inside, just a little ""crunch"" as you bite into the bun.  I would order it again, no problem.   My wife had the potato skins for her meal. She wasn't happy with them.  They looked good and there was plenty of them.  However, the amount of cheese in them was anemic.  Compared to the other meals we had on the table, you would think these things would be over flowing with cheese.  Not the case.  She only ate one or two of them and we brought the rest home for the dog.   My daughter had a 1/2 pound Angus cheeseburger.  She loved it.  It was cooked just right and the meat was very tender.  Once again, the bun was the star of the show.  Toasted just right, soft on the inside, just enough of a crunch when you bit into it.  The burger was so big that she only ate half and save the rest for later that day.  The service was not the best I ever had.  There was the inevitable ""I'm going on a 30 minute break"" from our server and someone else took over our table.  It wasn't terrible service, but it could of been better.   But I'm not done yet, because the next day we had the opportunity to visit BJ's again.  We wanted the try the deep dish pizza that they serve.  Me and my daughter order a pizza, but with no tomatoes.  (They put fresh tomatoes on the top, not my daughters favorite)  And of course, the pizza came out with the tomatoes on top.  We pointed this out and the food server immediately offered for us to take that pizza home, which we did, and the food server went and put our order in again and had the pizza remade.   It was well worth the wait.  The toppings were plentiful.  But what really makes the pizza is the dough.  The dough is crunchy on the outside and when you take a bite it just melts in your mouth.  Is SO GOOD!  Can't emphasis this enough.  We really enjoyed the pizza.  I highly recommend it.   My wife had the french dip this time and wasn't disappointed this time.  The roast beef on the sandwich just melted in your mouth.  Plenty of cheese on the sandwich.  The horseradish sauce was very tasty.   For dessert we had a ""pizookie"", which is a fresh baked cookie that is baked in a little ""deep dish"" cookie pan.  We tried the chocolate/chocolate cookie with vanilla ice cream on top.  Just delicious.  I highly recommend leaving room for dessert and having one of these.  Once again the service was a little slow, had to ask for drink refills and settings for the table, etc.  No, not the end of the world, but the service could have been better.   They do offer the ""call ahead"" service so they can save a table for you, which is nice.   All in all, the food is great.  If you are going to BJ's, go for the food, not the service.   The only thing stopping me from giving 5 stars was the service."
N R.,"Benicia, CA",2,7,,5.0,6/26/2011,This place is quickly becoming one of my new favorites.  The baked potatoes are amazing.  The service has yet to dissappoint.  So glad a good restaurant has finally taken over this spot.
Timothy L.,"San Leandro, CA",46,174,9,5.0,10/17/2010,"I went here today with my aunt and uncle for dinner, they were pretty crowded but was able to get us seated within 15 minutes. The servers here are really friendly, and helpful when it comes to ordering. The food was great, i got the jambalaya, which had a nice little kick to it and had plenty of shrimp, sausages and chicken in it. The brewed rootbeer they had was a disappointment as it wasnt as carbonated as i would like it, but i didnt minus a star because when i asked him about it, he said that he would give me a sample of it and if i liked it, i can order it."
Jim T.,"Reno, NV",63,20,,4.0,1/29/2011,"Any time I've gotten pizza here, it's been excellent. The wait time can be atrocious, and I've had problems getting service as well. But the pizza is great."
Jenny C.,"Concord, CA",3,21,1,4.0,6/6/2011,"Happy our with friends on Wednesday night is a classic now!! Beers are delish, calamari super crispy, nachos are super good (specially with an ice cold beer!!) If not in the mood for beer, their cream soda is uber good, not to sweet, just the right amount. Don't care much for their entrees, except for the fish and chips. But then again, I just go for their appetizers.... and their beer =D"
S T.,"San Leandro, CA",2,164,9,1.0,1/18/2011,"I was very very displeased with this place. I have been to other BJ's restaurants throughout California, and this is by far the worst one I have been to. I came here to celebrate my 21st birthday with my family, and it was the absolute worst experience. I was looking forward to a fun night out, but instead, I was disappointed.  We called a week in advance to let them know we would be having a large party of 20 people. They seemed to be accommodating over the phone, but it was an entirely different experience when we got there. Our reservations were at 6pm and I showed up at 530pm since we brought a cake and wanted to be at the restaurant prior to our guests. We were told we could not be seated until half of our party arrived. Ok, no problem...so we sat at the bar. Service sucked at the bar! Then the manager informs my mom and I that we are sitting OUTSIDE!! Outside in January...i think not. He said that all large parties have to be seated outside which was a complete LIE since there was a large party of 50 seated down the center of the restaurant. Really?? Ridiculous. He said if we wanted to sit inside, we would have to wait an additional hour and a half.  The outside ended up being semi-closed off with heating lamps but we were still cold and we could smell all the cigarette smoke from the smokers outside which made my guests who were pregnant to be extremely uncomfortable. As we get outside, they were seating us at SEPARATE tables!? WHAT!? By this point, i was extremely upset and wanted everyone to sit together. My mom, NOT the workers, had to put tables together and go inside to get silverware for everyone. Excuse me, am I paying my mom or the restaurant. Granted, we did have a lot of people so service wasnt going to be quick. But we only had one waiter for all of us and it took forever to get drinks and order our food. They should have brought in one additional person to help out. I did feel bad since the waiter was working his butt off to help and I was thankful for that.  However, when I got my pizza that I was sharing with my dad, we were not giving any plates. My guests didnt receive plates for their food either! Then it took 10-15 min just to get plates and some of them were DIRTY! Later on, a random server brought a pazooki to my table for me to have for my birthday, but I was still in the bathroom. By the time I returned, the ice cream was completely melted and I had melted wax all over my dessert. That went into the trash...Even though the food was good, I was very displeased about everything in general.  The manager gave my mom a gift card to return, but I moved out of town and will not be returning...so I did not benefit from this experience whatsoever. For being a restaurant that brings in a lot of customers, it is not large enough. Plus, they should have told us over the phone prior to me coming out there that we would be seated outside. I WILL NOT BE BACK!"
Michy M.,"Brentwood, CA",0,16,2,4.0,6/1/2013,Been here many times and the food is very consistent and tasty (never had issues with anything I've ordered). Love the beer and the happy hour is good...avocado rolls are amazing!!
Colleen L.,"Orinda, CA",13,27,1,1.0,1/13/2011,"I was so excited to hear that BJ's was opening up around town! I used to eat at BJ's in socal quite often... satisfying my cravings for deep dish pizza, spicy chicken pasta, or pizookie! This particular BJ sucks. Absolutely sucks. We ordered the mediterranean which was bland and undercooked (BLEGH) and the Apple Berry Burst Crumble, which came out like.. a pan of microwaved jam and two melted puddles of ice cream. We sent it back and just got a good reliable pizookie. Guess what! UNDERCOOKED AGAIN. It was raw cookie dough, once again with two puddles of ice cream. Our waiter was amazing and responsive but the food sucked. Service was slow but I can't say it wasn't our server's fault. He was running around... seemed like the other servers were just getting paid to watch tv. Have I mentioned that this place sucks?"
Erika B.,"Hayward, CA",1,2,,1.0,5/26/2012,"this is not the first time i have been to this particular BJ's, but this experience was absolutely AWFUL.  I wish i could give ZERO stars for the service.  Here is why.... We arrived at 7pm for a party of 8 and used their call ahead service to put our name on the list before we arrived.  Once we arrived and checked in, they told us it would be a 30-40 minute wait.  An hour later, our buzzer goes off and we go to get seated.  They take us straight to a table outside--but never asked if we had a preference and just assumed we would be okay with it.  We were not.  There were people smoking outside near the patio area and it was pretty chilly.  We were then taken back inside and told we would be put back on the top of the list for the next available table inside that could seat 8 people.  They didn't give us an estimated time of how much longer it would be, but just told us they have been waiting for another table to leave who had been there for almost 2 hours.  FINALLY, we were seated...inside--almost 2 HOURS since our arrival.  There were no free appetizers given, barely an apology--instead they just blamed it on the other table taking 2 hours before freeing up a table for us.  Once we got to the table, our service from our server wasn't the best either.  He took a while to get us waters, and once he brought them, he didn't even bring enough for the whole table.  We finally ordered our food, they forgot a salad that was ordered and it just took forever to get anything accomplished.   In addition, there was a large spill right next to our table and it seemed as though we were more worried about getting someone to clean it up, than the management was.  We put down a napkin on the spill, so no one would slip and eventually someone came to clean it up. We were at BJ's for a total of 3.5 hours for dinner.  Absolutely RIDICULOUS for a Friday night dinner.  The food was delicious, but the service made the experience, less than appealing.  Management NEEDS to do something to improve this, or they will loose a lot of customers."
William D.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",242,211,80,3.0,12/10/2009,"Stopped in on a Satuday afternoon with the girls about 1:45 & was told it would be a twenty minute wait.The buzzer they hand you for notification went off in about 10 minutes. The place was very crowded as you would expect around the holidays. Nice interior for a higer end bar & it seems very open & lots of bigs screens. Ordered the avocado egg roll appitezer ^ they were interesting & pretty tasty. For the main the misses & I  split a cheesburger on a french roll with the string french fries & and a chopped cobb salad. Both were excellent. The Toots had a spinich sald & said it was pretty good also. For desert you have to try the chocolate chip cookie they bake in a small pizza ring topped with vanilla bean ice cream. Flipping excellent,but you may want to plan a long run or gym workout the next morning,due to the 2000 calories it contains. If this is a step above Dennys ,I'm a little confused...(Way better then Dennys)"
DANNY B.,"San Francisco, CA",2,60,15,1.0,1/11/2010,"This was the worse experience that i have ever had, my Pulled Pork Sandwich was dry like it sat out for a day then got put into a microwave for re-heating... Pretty gross .. I guess i will stick to the one in Newark because their Pulled Pork Sandwich was great..."
Christina T.,"Pittsburg, CA",0,2,,2.0,5/30/2010,"OVERRATED & OVERPRICED Went here last night with my bf and his brother and cousin. Called ahead because I heard the wait can be ridiculous. anyway when we got there the   ""welcome"" hosts were busy with other people so I waited and when the crowd cleared the host greets the white lady (no offense) who just walked up next to me without so much as recognizing me ( young black lady with 3 young black men) She apologized when she realized what she did but still.  We waited less than 10 minutes before our table was ready, ordered Jambalaya (nothing special), some California sandwich ( very good) and several drinks including strawberry confusion ( delicious! tasted all fruit and no alcohol but i felt it. lol) adiós mf that was not nearly strong enough to be called an adiós mf...and a white peach mojito which was ok. We also order artichoke dip which was   really good but way overpriced  @ $8.95 for chips and dip?!?  Overall I probably wont be coming here again. The food was good but overall i think it was too overpriced for the food and service."
Mouse K.,Bay Area,6,93,8,5.0,8/31/2010,I go here at least twice a week and enjoy it every single time. The food is never off. I usually get a chicken mustard salad and my friend gets the burger melt. The service is pretty good. I've been to the BJ's in Neward and Foster City all of them have been nothing but great.
