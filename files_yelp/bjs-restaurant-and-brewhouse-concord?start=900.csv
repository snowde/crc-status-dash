Tori M.,"Fairfield, CA",61,107,8,3.0,10/1/2010,"Came here after we rode BART back from an amazing Giants game! I'm not a drinker but the root beer is to die for. They serve it in this frosty cold mug and it freezes at the top, so delicious on this hot day! Food is OK nothing all that special, typical chain restaurant stuff."
Ivette K.,"Concord, CA",101,43,,2.0,2/18/2011,I would only recommend this restaurant if your going to drink at the bar. The service is horrible. I went their on three occasions and each time was not a pleasant experience. Food wise well if they haven't ran out out anything it might be good. I think the only thing they have going for them is the poozkies that's about it oh and the deep dish. Over all this is a no no.
Lee F.,"Walnut Creek, CA",1,24,,2.0,2/16/2013,"The food is good enough, but the service lacks.   I understand you're busy, but could you at least make eye contact and let us know that you haven't completely forgotten us??  Lack of communication makes for a bad dining experience.  Unfortunately, the waitress actually got a good tip simply because I couldn't stand to wait any longer for her to come back with change.  I figured this would cause me to stay another 15 minutes and I had somewhere to be."
Food C.,"Concord, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/5/2013,"Weakest service ever.. Ordered about three different kinds of beers each time the server came back saying they were all out of that. Wtf is it on the menu for..?? After there third miss I told them I didn't even want a beer anymore, service got even worse. I can honestly say ill never be returning to this chain brew house. Anyone considering save your self the hassle and time. GO SOME PLACE ELSE!!"
Lincoln H.,"Concord, CA",5,9,3,4.0,2/16/2011,"We arrived there at 5:30 and had appetizers and drinks. I love all the Flat screens and the open area. I enjoy the selection of different beers. A little pricey for a hangout, but worth it on a once jn a while basis. Service is good."
Val B.,"Honolulu, HI",503,164,75,4.0,5/23/2010,I liked the service here. I only had literally 40 mins for linner (lunch/dinner) because I was at work. I meet a group of girls there.  They started with their cocktails.  I came to the table.  The server took my order immediately. I ordered the Honey Mustard Crispy Chicken Salad.  Very Very Very refreshing and delicious! The food came out in about 7 minutes. My check came so quickly. I clocked in one minute early from lunch.  Thanks!
Danielle G.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",174,145,332,4.0,7/7/2010,"Ok I heart BJ's so much...but it pains me to include a horrible experience there. I have been to BJ's like 4 times for dinner/late night drinks. One of those times included my birthday. All of the first 3 times I have been there, I had yummy food and drinks.  It is sad to say that I did experience a buttheadish bartender. It was my birthday and the people who I were with were getting this unacceptable attitude from him. Hella rude. Thank goodness for Sebastian the other and much nicer bartender who was well much nicer. :)  The last time I was at BJ's was for a late dinner, last Friday (7/2) the place was just starting to wind down. It took quite a while to actually get to see our server. He was very nice, but looked a little stressed. Once we finally saw him (20minutes after being seated) we order drinks and food. We were told this chicken dish was sold out, so my friend opted for the the country fried steak dinner. I ordered a shrimp pasta, but the angel hair noodles were out so I had to sub my noodles. Which was ok, we were hungry. Anyways, the wait for our food = about 45minutes. And my pasta came out luke warm. Not kool!!!  We were informed by the manager like 40 minutes into the wait that there was a reason for the wait. The CFS was just freshly breaded and fried. I asked to have my pasta warmed up. Only good thing was free desert.  Still I really love the food, when its hot.  The opened sandwiches are A+. Always wanted to try the pizza. But really the Country Fried Steak is pretty awesome with the thick gravy and some hot sauce. Always wanted to try the pizza, maybe next time. Yes there will be a next time for me even if service it needs a little work."
Steve P.,"Concord, CA",0,13,3,1.0,7/5/2011,"My son and I went there because it was the only place open in the mall two hours before fireworks started at College Park. The hostess was nice and pretty and sat us two right away. Our server Andrew was pleasant and immediately asked if we wanted a house soda or ale. We opted for a root beer and cherry soda. I also ordered the seared ahi as an appetizer. The house sodas are served with no ice - I suppose because they are so yummy. However the mug was very warm from the dishwasher and the soda was super sweet. The root beer was strong but good, but the cherry soda was strong and just bad. I asked for ice and Andrew brought us a glass, half way attempt to add ice to our drinks, then gave up, mumbled something and left me to spoon ice into our drinks. After adding ice, the drinks were okay, but could have been more watered down for my taste. The ahi came and was alright. I had wonderful seared ahi at Outback a couple of weeks prior, and it was much better. When the ahi came I had to ask for utensils... because we had none - you'd think the server might have noticed that by then, maybe checked when the ahi was dropped off, but no. I ordered the chicken parmesan off the lunch menu and the boy got the classic bacon burger - both mistakes. The chicken I got was the worst I've ever had. It was hard and dry and the cheese was gross. There was no sauce, but it was served with spaghetti. The spag was overly spicy, but was the best part of my meal. As another reviewer mentioned, the burger is served on a roll, not a bun. The bun was gross and severely burned. The bacon was nasty on top of that burger. My son usually wolfs down a good burger. He stopped before half way and told me it tasted funny - the kiss of death for a ten year old. So I tasted it and he was right - gross. I tried a few of his fries and they were absolutely gobbed in some spicy stuff. I wanted to be in a good mood for the fourth, so I paid my bill and left, never to return."
Lets Go T.,"Gold Beach, OR",0,26,36,3.0,1/9/2011,Best red ale   third trip.  Not a disapointment consistantly good .  Wide selection.  Great pizza.  The appetizers were great  love spinich dip!  Patricia did a great job on serving.  Thanks.
Tomo K.,"Fremont, CA",3,100,,1.0,9/19/2012,"On 2 separate occasions they forgot my food and brought me cold food! the very first time I just thought it was an accident and its hard to blame anyone because it could have been a server error or it could have been the cook not cooking all that well or what have you. But the 2nd time I went, not only did the server forget about our table, by the time he remembered us and brought us our very cold food, he tried to lie to us and tell us that they just came out and that it was a busy night, little did he know we were paying attention to all the other tables around us and they were getting their food before we were even though they sat down 10-15 min after us. Poor service, poor food quality, overall just a poor experience. I will never go back here."
Larry W.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,20,,1.0,3/15/2010,"Nine of us had to wait over 40 minutes after we ordered for our food to be served.  Restaurant was only 1/3 full. I had a BBQ rib dish that came with only can with a pototoe. No veggies. Food was barely warm & not very tasty.  Some of the others said their food was good, others said food wasn't. Too many great restaurants around, I won't be going back to BJ"
Mich H.,"Concord, CA",118,7,4,4.0,10/25/2010,Great selection of brews...and I love you can watch your favorite sports team from every table in the place!
Jac C.,"Concord, CA",42,48,8,4.0,11/7/2009,"I went to BJ's all the time when I lived in SoCal so I was really excited that a location opened in Concord. I really like their house beers and they have a big selection of other beers including bottled Belgians. They have really good mini pizzas but today I opted for the California Burger. It was really tasty and perfectly cooked. It's a hamburger patty on sourdough bread with cheese, avocado and green chiles. It came with some crispy shoestring french fries that were really good. To drink, I had a Pumpkin Ale and a Jeremiah Red. The Pumpkin Ale (their current seasonal beer) was tasty, kind of like banana bread mixed with pale ale. Jeremiah Red has been one of my favorite BJ's brews for a long time so of course that was good too. Service is really good. There are lots of friendly people around ready to help you whenever you need it."
Daniel B.,"Vallejo, CA",28,17,2,3.0,7/4/2010,"We go to BJ's probably around once every other month.  Overall, we do really like them.  but definitely have a few issues with them as well. Our usual order: *Appetizer - mozzarella sticks:  I could just order a few plates of these and make a meal of it.   *The wife - fish & chips:  Some of the best around.  Most places rarely get it right, but they nail it every time and their fish is very high quality.  *Myself - roast beef dip sandwich (au jus):  Consistently the best french dip I have ever had.   Other things we've ordered: *Pizza - Yea so i guess this is what they're known for.  It was pretty good but still - It's just pizza, not like it's Zachary's or anything... *Pizookie - My wife enjoyed this dessert.  I was a bit bored with it. *New York steak - oh this one was BAD.  it was just a flavorless chunk of meatiness.  Blah.  So disappointing. The Experience: *The Dining Room -   Expect it to be loud - loud music, TVs, and loud wasted party goers abound.  Expect a very long wait for a table, unless you feel like eating on the patio.  The servers are always great though, once you actually get seated. *Take out - We just tried their ""curbside"" service last night.  It was a complete joke. I called in our order and was told it would be 20-25 minutes.  I show up 25 minutes later to find an abandoned take out counter.  After a few minutes a girl shows up at the counter and confirms my order.  She says everything is ready and she just has to go in the back to get it and disappears.  She didn't come back for over 15 minutes!!  Eventually a hostess offers me a complimentary drink and later had to page the girl that was getting my food.  It was ridiculous!  In all I had to wait for over 20 minutes from the time they told me to show up to pick up the food.  We thought maybe the food wasn't ready when i showed up and the girl was just lying about it, but the mozzarella sticks and crispy thin fries were totally rubbery like they'd been sitting for a LONG time.  I don't know that we'll do the take out thing here any more."
Abby R.,"Rohnert Park, CA",23,30,13,1.0,3/27/2012,We had a very disappointing meal here. It took 25 minutes to get our drinks and over 1/2 hr for our appetizer. It was about 55 min till our lunch arrived. The kids were never offered refills on their sodas or more water for my husband.... Our waitresses name was BIE..... Tattoo under right ear. She seemed distracted the entire time and when she did manage to come to our table she was looking around and not focusing on us. Her relief David was great. Would have asked to talk to a manager but we were pressed for time. Took too long ... And food was mediocre.
Marcus R.,"Phoenix, AZ",786,51,14,5.0,1/29/2011,Love the bar set up here....cracking on Fri & sat .....like the beer sampler and wingz....
Logan P.,Bay Area,105,184,39,5.0,11/8/2010,"About a year ago i've always been hearing about Bj's from my friends and family. Never got to eat there until early this year. Now ive been there about 5-7 times and the customer service there is always friendly.. I was just there for my wifes BDAY and she made them take lots of pictures and the waiter didnt complain one bit. He didnt even look like he was irritated or anything. I like the fact that they have a pretty good variety of beer you can choose from and the food is definitely above average.. Nice place to go eat with friend and family. And its right next to a 24 hour fitness, if your feeling fat after you eat there. You can go work off your calories or whatever.."
Derek S.,"Concord, CA",1969,156,53,4.0,11/5/2009,"I've been to all the local Bj's Restaurants in the area (Sf, Sac, East Bay) and was very pleased both times i have went to this one. Staff is very friendly and helpful. My most recent time in, there was a small error with my food in which then very much made up for it. With free desert and meal. I will for sure be going back scene i finally have one close to home!! It is a lot smaller than the other Bj's and gets full pretty quick, but very glad to have one here. Beers are great, food is a above average in comparison to Elephant Bar and Cheesecake Factory."
dan a.,"San Francisco, CA",115,150,,2.0,10/20/2009,"i've been to BJs in other cities before, but AVOID the concord location until they get their act together... maybe it's because they just opened, but the service was HORRIBLE.  when you eat at a chain restaurant, you can expect the same food, so of course service would make the difference.  and it did... in a bad way. my party of 8 was seated 30 minutes after we had all been there (which would have been okay, except for the fact that we had reservations!).  but the best part was that they seated us IN THE BAR AREA which is open seating anyways!  the circular booth we were shoved in was obviously meant for 6 people MAX. do i need to continue in detail about how one of our plates went to the wrong table (so we got a new one late) and one of our desserts NEVER CAME?!  as i was the one paying, i noticed that they comp'ed us the late plate, but failed to do anything but apologize for the missing dessert, AFTER I HAD ALREADY SIGNED THE CHECK WITH A FATTY TIP!  It takes pretty extreme circumstances to make me a poor tipper, but if could have gotten my check back, I would have been one... moral of the story: DON'T GO!  if you want a deep-dish pizza, spend the time you'd be waiting for a table by DRIVING to ZACHARY'S in either oakland/berkeley or san ramon and getting some REAL deep dish."
margaret l.,"Pittsburg, CA",26,40,,1.0,12/28/2009,"The good news we didn't have to wait. The bad news service was slow to poor, food was worse.  The waitress asked me if I wanted a refill on my soda, 20 mins later I got it. The food was horrendous, so much so both myself and my friends got ill from eating it.  I had the chili cheeseburger, the fries were good (seasoned fries) but the chili tasted like the beer wasn't cooked out of it enough (all I could taste was beer). It took the waitress another 25-30 mins after we ended to bring us the bill.   I left over half of my meal.  I will not go back, service is worse then the Cheesecake factory but at least there you get the cheesecake."
