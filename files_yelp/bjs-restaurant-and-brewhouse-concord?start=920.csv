Lois R.,"Los Angeles, CA",66,106,1,4.0,4/29/2010,"Went in there for lunch. Baked potato with minestrone soup. One coffee, a sprite & bottom less soup & salad option. [I know, very light lunch but BJ's has huge portions] Btw this is between my homegirl & I. Her & I sat @ the bar & got immediate attention. The lady bartender running lunch was quite pleasant and super nice. She even split our Jeremiah. Loved the lunch crowd, their quite chill. Not bad for a Tuesday lunch."
Jack N.,"San Francisco, CA",6,81,84,3.0,1/30/2010,"i think this place is good, but the location in foster city area by san mateo is better.  this place is new so it still has a few waiters getting used to the menu and taking orders (ex.: my waiter put jalapenos on my pizza, instead of on the side like i asked for which ended up burning my butt to infinity cuz i dont send food back and i really wanted to like him cuz he was starting his life over here after a tragic ending in san diego plus he was a nice guy and i felt bad giving him a shit time for such a small but painful gassy experience and ...anyway i'm getting off track) i recommend the southwest pizza.   they have a beer, that's dark in color.  definately a stout.  and definately over 5% i'm sure (now errrbody in'a club gettin tipzz) good place, but maybe once every 2-3 months at the most for this one. can get severely crowded.  waited about an hour for seating on saturday night."
Casey C.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",368,101,1091,3.0,5/28/2011,"good food, love the stuffed mushrooms, the pizza is ok not my favorite... every time I go the service absolutely sucks..."
Benjina D.,"Frisco, TX",835,188,438,2.0,10/26/2009,"I'd tack on another half star to the two stars I've given, but that's it...tops. I've been to many BJ's Brewpubs, especially in Texas, and I have to say, this one sucked. So they're new, ok, I'll give them a break for not having their waitstaff together. But having bad food is no excuse, especially since what they serve is standard fare that is served in all BJ's restaurants nationwide.  Brownie points for being seated on time, after having called ahead to be put on their list. Another star for giving us a booth (there were only 2 of us). I was disappointed at not seeing the chilli cheese fries on the menu. They used to have the thick cut fries, with chilli and cheese on it -- it was the bomb! So, we opted to get the nachos that the waitress recomended. It turns out, that they do offer the thick cut fries, they have the chilli and the cheese, so why the waitress didn't just offer to have the kitchen make them for us was just weird.  Anyway, the chilli cheese nachos weren't done right the first time around. Not enough cheese, it had olives (we asked for no olives), no sour cream, and no salsa on the side. Second round of nachos came, and they looked good enough. One layer of chips into it, we were out of cheese, and there was no chilli to speak of. It was all dry chips. After playing with the plate, and digging into the middle of the stack of chips, I finally found the chilli...all on the bottom of the plate, and stone cold. Wtf? On to the pizza. We ordered a medium with onions and green peppers, well done. The pizza didn't have enough sauce on it. I know, I know, Chicago style has sauce on the top...but trust me, this one did not have enough. And, not enough cheese either. The pizza dough was doughy, and not at all well-done, or crispy. The toppings were falling off the pizza as we lifted the slice. My husband pointed out the dry, sauceless, cheeseless parts of his slice to the waitress, who said, ""oh, you must have gotten a bad slice."" Really? How about the rest of the pizza? Must have gotten an entirely bad pizza, I guess.  She never did offer to do anything about it, and simply walked off.  We also had the Blackened Chicken baked potato, which was ok. The chicken had been re-heated, so it tasted really dry. The alfredo sauce was horrible. Tasted watery, and I wouldn't want it anywhere on a pasta dish, if that's the same sauce they use.  The saving grace was the pizookie. It was awesome! We had a warm peanut butter cookie with chocolate ice-cream...mmmm! Also a plus point: Cowboy games! So, would we come back to this BJ's? Yes, but we'll be sitting at the bar, having a drink, eating a pizookie, and watching the Cowboys play."
Melissa M.,Bay Area,73,126,,2.0,11/3/2009,"I went here last night for happy hour with some friends.  The food was good, but the service sucked.  Our server seemed out of it and made my husband repeat his order to him multiple times.  Seriously, dude.  Freakin' write that ish down already.  I mean, it was a little loud, but if the server actually paid attention to what my husband was saying, he would've gotten the order.  I asked him three times for new place settings, but I never received them.  Luckily, I ordered pizza, so I didn't need a fork, but I still wanted a napkin. I was forced to use beverage napkins that were left on my table.  I know they opened recently, but they really need to work on training their wait staff to do their job."
John S.,"Chicago, IL",0,14,1,2.0,3/10/2011,"BJ's is awesome. Regardless how awesome and amazing though... Sunvalley BJs sucks. Second time going, and second disappointment. The San jose one is great, so is the Reno one! First off the waiter [RODGER] was TERRIBLE. didn't give us refills on water, took forever to give us our food and take the order, never asked how the food was, and the group who arrived 20 minutes after us got their drinks before WE did! The food was good at least. We got less portions than at the other places. specifically the avocado rolls. we got a two topping medium pizza but he charged us for a three topping....?! Plus when we paid we wanted 20 cash and the rest on the card.... he put all of it on the card and just broke the 20 for us.... who hired this guy? Seriously! He spilled our pizza as well and blamed it on us saying we made him nervous. I don't see how though? at least the semi-new wildberry mojito was okay."
Jamie D.,"Berkeley, CA",108,5,1,2.0,6/1/2011,"I worked at this location for almost 2 years...since they opened. I finally had to quit because the servers were lazy and the restaurant did not run very efficiently. That is not to say that there are not a few Gems there. Of course, there are about 5 servers who are amazing, and a few menu items that are always popular. I would always recommend the Jambalaya and the Parmesan Chicken with cheddar mashed potatoes, but ask for extra chardonnay butter sauce...trust me. The pizzas I feel are a joke...need to be cooked longer than they are, and not worth the calories you will pack on! The problem with this place is that the menu is so F****ing big, and they add new items every 3 months (good for variety, but bad for server knowledge). They also make the servers go through all of these retarded steps of service, which are suppose to create efficiency, but makes us sound like robots that dont really care. I always ventured away from the steps of service, which low-and-behold made me one of the best servers, and I had a ton of regulars, secret shoppers of course got in the way...I decided it wasnt worth being a drone and quit! So I would recommend Bjs if you are looking for a fun place to kick back and drink some beer and watch a game in the bar, f the dinning room, and be really friendly to your server...trust me they get enough bs from the manager there! Good luck!!"
C B.,"Clayton, CA",0,63,,2.0,6/14/2014,Super slow for a Thursday! We came in to celebrate the last day of school & I think half of Pleasant Hill had the same idea along with those who wanted to watch the soccer game in Brazil. We arrived at 1:00. Our server was horrible!! After we were seated he took forever to get our drink orders & we were hungry & ordered an appetizer. After about 20 minutes he comes back to take our orders. Mom & daughter split a pizza & mom wanted a house salad to go with it. Her salad comes out BEFORE the appetizer & it is the saddest salad I've ever seen. It had 4 pieces of lettuce drenched in ranch dressing. It was a disgrace to call it a salad. The BBQ chicken on the pizza was DRY. My daughter picked it off because she couldn't eat it. Chicken tacos on the other hand were great. Our server never brought us our food someone else always did. The only thing he did do was refill drinks when we asked. A good server should be on top of the drink situation. After we ate we decide we need to eat a pizookie! By the time we got out of there it was almost 4 pm This was the longest lunch!
Matt H.,"Oakland, CA",6,61,1,4.0,3/7/2012,"I go to school near BJ's and enjoy going for lunch. Their beers are great and their food is always good. The servers have always been friendly and capable. Their desserts are quite popular as well. I went with a friend of mine who doesn't eat gluten, and their gluten-free pizzas are awesome. I definitely recommend this place."
Kay S.,"Concord, CA",0,7,,3.0,10/25/2010,Food was just ok. Service good but nothing special. Had the peach drink. Not worth your money at all. The atmosphere is good.
Christina S.,"New York, NY",2,46,3,1.0,4/24/2012,Foods good if your lazy and don't wana cook or eat mcdonalds.  Service fucking sucks even if you order to go.
Dale B.,"Pinehurst, NC",1,15,,4.0,1/5/2011,Nice place to stop and have a quick bite before shopping. The happy hour menu has a good veriety and the prices are reasonable. Our server was very friendly and right on top of everything. The number of TV's makes it easy to watch sporting events.
Matt W.,"Oakland, CA",0,101,,2.0,11/14/2009,"Took forever to get a table, and the wait for the fun was about 30 minutes. And when the food arrived it wasn't even cold, and 1 of the orders was totally wrong.  It took another 20 minutes to get a new burger out on the table.  When I used the restroom, I slipped on the wet floor, and told a waitress who said I need to tell the manager (i guess that isn't in her job description).  So when we got the bill we spoke with the manager Justin, who apologized and said he was going to give us coupons for our next visit, but after waiting 10 minutes and seeing a crowd of people waiting for a table we just left. I don't recommend this place."
Rosemary M.,"Berkeley, CA",0,24,,1.0,8/22/2012,"We took my mom there for her birthday lunch on a Saturday; we'd been here a couple of years ago and enjoyed it. This time it wasn't good and we won't be back.  Slow service, mediocre food; there were things wrong with every item ordered!  Pizza was half BJ's favorite and half veggie, way too doughy, barely any sauce, lukewarm when it arrived and the pizza stand wobbled when you tried to remove a piece.  The pork chop entree was overcooked (tough) and the green beans were  undercooked (just this side of raw); we had to ask for a steak knife to cut the chop. The caramelized onion was asked for on the side and it never made it to the plate at all!  The fish and chips were overcooked, almost burnt, and the fish (must have been pollack) had no flavor and was dry; the wedge fries were very good.  The server constantly tried to ""upsell"" us from appetizers and drinks to dessert.  First we were told cutlery would be brought, then we asked for it and finally when we were served, they still hadn't brought anything.  The server did offer a complimentary pizza-cookie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a candle which was very nice of them."
D B.,"Concord, CA",0,21,,3.0,11/15/2012,"I have been to BJ's several times and have to say, they food is very good.  For lunch you can sit at the bar and get good service.  The problem is when things get busy.  Last week we came by on Saturday with a group of 10.  It took 20 minutes to get our order and over an hour to get our meal.  One meal actually came 20 minutes after everyone else's. We called the Manager, who took off one meal. I wish he would have taken off the tip, which came to almost 3 meals!  Again, food is good. But the service stinks when they are busy!"
Jessie L.,"Martinez, CA",0,65,,1.0,2/13/2012,"I've had a bad experience at this particularly BJ's more than once. Last week I ordered take out. When I arrived it took them several minutes to come outside only to say they didn't have my order. 10 mins. later they realized they did have more order. It ended up being over 50 mins. before I actually received my food. I only stayed because they gave me the meal for free and a gift card. When I got home the food was overcooked and over seasoned. I do like BJ's. I've been to some in the South Bay and I have had better experiences. However, after this experience, II honestly don't know if I want to even bother going back to use the gift card."
Megan J.,"Lodi, CA",3,10,,2.0,5/13/2012,"I'm giving it a 2 because this use to be my favorite restaurant. I always enjoyed my service and food. Even though I have enjoyed goin here for years with my friends and family, I will never go back again after today!!!! That's a promise!!!! I can't believe the kind of service and overall experience I had there today. I wanted to cut them some slack on the fact it took so long to get our food, but that's nothing. So we get our food my sisters moms and my food were all cold. The waitress sees that we aren't eating our food and walks by 2 and still didn't ask what was wrong. The waitresses family and friends were at the table next to us what does she do she stands there talking with them and eating food (with her hands and mouth open so gross) and then goes and serves people there plates, nasty girl wash your hands. She finally comes over and sent my sisters food back. We went and food the manager ourselves, he didnt have much to say except he would talk to her I guess he did. Wait for this, as we get up to leave the restaurant the waitress is telling the table of people she knew how we told on her and what do they do the waitress and the whole table started yelling at my sister and calling her rude. Were classy people so we walked away and just politely told the manager after all the business we gave you we will never be back we pointe to the table and the waitress and they were waiving good bye at us like the one a match on being the trashiest people in concord, congratulations you won!"
Christine P.,"Daly City, CA",80,401,285,4.0,12/21/2009,"this is the 5th bj's location i've been to (oxnard, cupertino, elk grove, san bruno, concord) and, because of this chain's consistency, i round it up from a three to a four. i normally do not like chains because i'm pretty sure of the food is frozen or prepared offsite - which totally goes against my food religion. but i enjoy bj's because the chain itself has consistent service and food. my bf took me here for dinner and it was his first time. he didn't like how the waitresses were ""crackheads."" what that means is that they check up on you every 2 minutes and they're all SUPER HAPPY. yeah, i'd have to say i don't like that either. he had a sour dough burger and i had the NY strip. both were good, but not outstanding. we did however LOVE the potato skins. i personally haven't met a potato skin i haven't liked - yet. we'll be back, but not before i can go down to costco and actually make our own burgers and steaks. they'll probably be more tasty."
Dorothy M.,"Lafayette, CA",70,149,13,4.0,12/13/2009,I consider this restaurant a poor man's version of the Cheesecake Factory. Well it's not that cheap but more affordable than Cheesecake for sure! I like the many options. The food is usually executed well even when you order to-go. Pretty delish drinks as well!
Bob T.,"Concord, CA",0,1,,1.0,5/31/2014,"I just had dinner here a few hours ago and let me tell you it was the worst service I've ever experienced. The hostess was clueless and our waiter was an idiot and a racist because he acted differently towards minorities. A couple sitting next to us had to complain  to the manager because the idiot didn't put in their order and next thing you know he starts taking his anger out on us and slams our waters on the table and he even threw a chair to the side! How unprofessional can you get especially in front of customers. All the workers act like they are all so busy when in reality they are just walking around and doing nothing! These people don't know what busy is, I've been to restaurants in the City that are super busy with crowds and lines going out the door and yet the staff manage to be friendly and professional.  I know the future of this restaurant and let me just say it's not pretty, especially with a mediocre staff like that."
