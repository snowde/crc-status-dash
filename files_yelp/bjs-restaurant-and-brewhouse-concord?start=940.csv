Jory S.,"San Francisco, CA",205,119,2,5.0,1/12/2010,"Great food, Great Prices, Great Service.  Amazing buzz and energy there.  LONG overdue to see a BJ's in Contra Costa County!  Welcome to the neighborhood BJ'S!"
Laura C.,"Concord, CA",64,10,,4.0,7/12/2010,"Been a fan of BJ's pizza for years but just tried this BJ's for the first time. Great deep dish pizza, italian chopped salad, and beers- just like always! We also had excellent service- we had only been seated a minute when someone came over to tell us our waiter would be right there. This guy took our drink order and our waiter was at our table a couple of minutes later with our drinks and ready to take our order. He checked on us throughout the meal and brought the check out promptly. We don't eat BJ's pizza often because it's not exactly healthy, but it is always a great treat when we do get it! Ooh, and don't forget to get a pizzooki for desert-YUM!"
Mark D.,"Vallejo, CA",3,58,,3.0,11/14/2009,"They're stuff is decent. It's like Cheesecake factory without the 2 hour wait (though I haven't been there during peak hours/days). They have a wide variety of items. Perhaps too wide a variety. Some things are great, and some things are ho-hum. Service can be pretty slow at times. All in all, not bad."
John Z.,"Orinda, CA",10,99,12,4.0,11/9/2009,"Been here a couple times, pretty decent food and great selection of beer. The floors are damn slippery though. Watch out!"
Heidi T.,"Sacramento, CA",1,25,,3.0,6/12/2010,"I def wouldn't try to come here around dinner time, especially on a weekend. It seems to be the only hot spot in Concord where everyone migrates to after 6pm.  For lunch I would recommend BJ's. I love their deep dish pizza. I've tried their specialty pizzas and they're great and so is their simple peperoni pizza. Great crust!  However, the staff does need some work. One waitress was about to end her shift and she would not stop buggin every 5-10 minutes. She was so anxious on leaving and giving us our check and we hardly received our plates. She needed to chill out or have someone else tend our table bc she became so annoying. I understand you are in a hurry to leave but do not rush me! Another time late on a Friday night, there were two groups of people arguing. One girl took off her heels and you know somethings going to happen after that. They were, no doubt, causing a scene but not one manager or staff member did anything. This wouldn't have pissed me off as much if the girls hadn't picked up glasses and start throwing them. Of course, we would be right behind one of the girls who threw a pepper shaker so then a glass was thrown across the room back in our direction with inaccurate aim and hit someone at our table. REALLY? As if this couldn't have been prevented if the commotion was taken out of the restaurant at the time it started. Bad experience. Overall, decent food, slight overpriced, come when it's not so busy to enjoy your meal."
Chris P.,"Livermore, CA",0,16,,4.0,6/10/2010,I absolutely love this place.  The food (especially the pizza) is to die for. Service could be a little better and faster.
Colin P.,"San Francisco, CA",27,597,43,4.0,8/21/2010,Good food and great atmosphere. A little busy on a Friday night.
charlotte c.,"Walnut Creek, CA",121,6,,2.0,12/29/2009,"Service sucks big time. Our food was late and kinda cold (I had pasta), they messed up on one of my guests orders (their order wasn't made so he had to wait longer while watching everyone else eat), I asked for a lemon wedge for my water (never got it), the waitress accidentally charged us for 3 sodas when only 2 we're order and she argued with us until she realized she made a mistake, and the waitress lost one of the check receipts (our guest had to sign another) It was tempting to not give a tip, but to be nice, we did it anyways. It gets 2 stars because the food was decent."
Lead F.,"Leesburg, VA",0,28,3,5.0,5/1/2010,"This is the best BJs of them all! What makes it better? Not only do they have their own beers, they have an awesome selection of beers - mostly Belgium. Try the Bezelbuth from France and Scaldis from Belgium and Monks Cafe Flemish Sour Ale from Philly. Paradise on Earth in Concord!"
Charles B.,"Vallejo, CA",11,110,,4.0,10/27/2011,I like the lunch specials and the beer is great!  Service can be slow and sometimes really disorganized when we come with 5 or more people.  Where one person gets an incorrect order or their lunch does not come until almost everyone else is done eating.  We really like their wedge salad and rich tomato soup. And we tend to split the cookie and ice cream for dessert.
Alex M.,"Berkeley, CA",2,30,3,2.0,11/16/2009,"Went to BJ's tonight, after being very excited about the new location opening up here.  I had eaten at BJ's in LA, and I remember it being really good. Well, this time it wasn't really good.  We went on a weeknight, so seating or wait times weren't a problem at all.  But maybe that messed up their timing, because our food came all at once.  So the salads hit the table, and the pizza came about ten seconds later.  Another problem with timing was that when the server took my card at the end, she kept it for like ten minutes.  If I have any bogus charges I know right where to go.  Actually, they changed servers on us halfway through.  The first gal came by every ten seconds to ask it we had saved room for a Pizookie, and the second was kind of distant.  The service was pretty much whatever. The food was pretty much in the same boat.  The salads were actually bad.  I had the Caesar, and the lettuce came with a bunch of wilted pieces included.  Also, Caesar is supposed to be made with romaine hearts, and this was mainly the tips of the leaves, so it was kind of tough and dry.  My friend had the house salad, which wasn't much better.  I had the house amber ale, and it was not very good at all.  Almost a weird chemical taste.  I didn't finish it. Ok, the pizza was actually really good, which it should be because it's their signature thing.  No complaints here.  Hot.  Nice chewy dough, crispy crust.  Tasty and satisfying. In summation, you can tell walking in that they basically hire a bunch of 19 year olds, and the dining experience really shows it.  Nothing was polished, nothing was truly professional.  One more quick example.  My friend asked for water, and the dude only brought one.  Pretty standard I think, that they should think to bring one for each diner.  Its the little things.   They have a great service where you can call ahead for a pie, park in these two special spaces out front, call em again, and they will walk the pizza out to you.  I would recommend this, because while the pizza is good, the restaurant sucks.  Get it to go."
Daniel A.,"Walnut Creek, CA",85,36,1,4.0,2/22/2012,"Honestly if it wasnt for the slow service I'd eat here more. I LOVE the ghiradelli triple chocolate pizookie. It's to die for, and with as many calories as it probably has, you probably will. The sourdough burger and fries are tasty but a couple times my food was borderline cold and would literally take an hour after ordering. This place gets busy so be prepared. Honestly I would come here just for the dessert! I almost gave it 3 stars but that pizookie...."
Dane W.,"Concord, CA",0,3,,5.0,2/20/2010,"Very fresh flavorable foods and salads. Hand crafted beers, efficient and courteous staff. It has become a regular for us."
Dimitri K.,"Brentwood, CA",244,14,,4.0,5/11/2010,"Ok, Im not a big fan of chain restaurants, they always make me feel like IM eating some microwaved plastic in all so I rarely go to them. But my buddy and I decided to give it a flip and a whim and give it a shot.  I was in love with the decor of the place. Liked the look of the bar and being an avid sports fan, I loved all the TV's. Had a wonderfuld server Amanda who was very attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu. Had their homemade root beer and it was just root beer to me-nothing special. Followed by a fried calamari appetizer which I really enjoyed. The batter was real good, and the two sauces served with it were pretty good. For my main course I had the fish tacos. The halibut was fried to perfection which was a surprise since most of the chain restaurants overfry and destroy everything that they touch. My buddy had a bacon cheeseburger and seemed to like it very much.  Overall, I cannot complain. For what it is, I would definitely repeat to go back for lunch or out for some coctails and apps. It was a real nice touch to my day"
jess r.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,21,1,2.0,11/4/2011,"just waited over an hour and a half for food taxi. cobb salad a supreme disappointment. Even though I had the order read back twice, they failed to deliver blue cheese dressing. The seared ahi had a dressing that did nothing for it. The clam chowder was ok but lacking celery it fell short of making an impression. Only plus was not having to cook or go out with infant twins."
Angie E.,"Livermore, CA",510,44,5,1.0,8/19/2010,"First I will say that I've had dinner at other BJ's locations (and love their food and usually get pretty good service at other locations) so this is strictly my opinion on this Concord location only. It's a Wednesday evening and we had a group of 7 ladies.   Parking at this location is a bear because it shares the same lot as a 24 Hour Fitness. Our car load of 4 circled 4 times up and down and finally just settle parking around the corner taking a little bit of a walk. Remember, it's a WEDNESDAY!!!  We get there and they said that it was going to be less than an hour wait...I've NEVER had anyone tell me that at the other locations when I eat mid week. We had put our name in at 627pm. We're standing outside and their entire patio area is pretty much empty with the exception of 1 couple.  Didn't think anything of it at the time and since there was 7 of us we just had good conversation while waiting.  We checked with the front twice on our status and they kept saying that there were 2-3 parties in front of us...well what is it, two OR three? how do you not know?   FINALLY at 737pm we got seated...the gal asked us if the patio was ok.  we said yes (cause we're starving at this point). we get seated out in the patio and so did two other tables of two. We were greeted by a hot waiter which seemed to make the waiting we had done a little less painful.  he asked us for our drink orders and brought them back to us.  Then he took food orders and we ordered apps (potato skins 2 orders) and the rest of our food, nothing was weird or special about our orders, just ordered straight from the menu.  The only thing they get 1 star for is having a nice, hot waiter and the fact that our potato skins came out right away and the fact that I can't give no stars or negative...i wish i could. we finished our potato skins and then a group of 14 ladies were seated next to us.  the two couples near us had already gotten their food they ordered.  still no food for us.  waiting and waiting and waiting...finally a couple of dishes came out at 835pm.  waited and waited and waited...nothing else.  hmmm so we waited and waited and waited some more.  a couple more dished trickled out at 845pm.  got a manager involved.  she apologized and said that she'd give us 50% off the entire bill.  we were still waiting for one more dish.  waited and waited and waited. by this time we had to get some of us home and so we said to give us boxes.  the entire wait staff in the restaurant knew we were LEAVING....and what do they do, they bring the last dish on a plate when they had helped box the other stuff up.  it was almost 9pm when that last dish came out....so they took it to get it boxed...15 mins passed, i was pissed. so i went to find the manager again...but the manager was apparently busy putting out other customer complaint fires (that's a red flag)...waited and waited and waited and FINALLY the last dish came. Opened the box to look at it and it seriously looked like someone threw up on my pizza.  the toppings were everywhere and the crust was completely limp and soggy like it had been sitting there for 15 mins in the box before they decided to bring it out. so i took the pizza in to show the girl at the front.  she took it to the manager and he came out 5 mins later.  I said we're not paying for our bill period cause this evening has been absolutely unacceptable.  he said he completely understood and that there were no words or excuses he would give me and he'd happily take care of the bill.  the bill was for $120...too bad we didn't have drinks...that would have been better. so i ended up going to burger king on my way home and had a whopper jr for dinner at 10pm since my stomach was growling louder than my radio at this point.   bottom line, never going back to the concord location ever again...not that i'm ever out there much anyway, we were just trying to accomodate a friend that lives out that way.  and i suggest you don't go there either...one of the gals posted our adventure on FB and all of her friends were commenting on how they never go to that location because the service/kitchen staff sucks all the time."
K V.,"Brentwood, CA",25,8,1,3.0,11/4/2009,"I like the rootbeer and jambalaya and the avocado rolls.  Went there twice.  Tuesday afternoon and Friday about 8pm.  On both occasions they were out of calamari.  Wait was very long on Friday, we were told the wait was 45 mins, ended up waiting more than an hour.  I felt rushed leaving as our server interupted our conversation to ask if we needed boxes to go, considering we waited that long to be seated."
denise s.,"Concord, CA",0,57,,1.0,8/30/2013,"OK, I have been here 5 times but no more. I kept trying to give it another chance. service is crummyand food is always disappointing. went in last sunday to try brunch. one of my complaints is that after I am seated it takes at least 7 minutes for anyone to ask if  I would like water!! with server after server passing me by and they aren't busy even! this last trip I was thinking about breakfast and asked my waitress how much coffee is as price was not on menu. She looks at me with a blank stare and says she doesnt know. OMG, really..you dont know the price of coffee. oh, and if I want to know she can check the computer. oh, yes..I would like to know I said as I might get tea instead. she left and did not return to almost 10 minutes. ok..now I have no water and cant find out the price of coffee. are you f'in kidding me. a different waitress passed by and I asked if she knows the price of coffee and she did! whoo hooo.. I explained my frustration and said I dont want to see that other waitress again. The new one took my order and was very sweet. Oh, but no, this isnt over. I said I want sourdough toast. She came back by once and said..now, you want sourdough toast, right? yes.  Well, guess what...yep..they f'd up the toast. oh, also..I got something called an Italian baked omelet with italian sausage, and more. NEVER  saw one bit of sausage and that omelet was soooo overdone it was like rubber. I asked for the manager who was very nice and said I would like a discount and he gave me meal for free. I explained my ongoing frustration with this restaurant. after 5 times of trying I will not be back... I can only give a place so many chances!"
Katrina A.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,7,,2.0,9/19/2010,House brewed Beer = great! Food = boring flavorless and would be something I could make myself for FAR less money at home. I tried to order 3 different belgian beers and they we out of all 3! My pasta was under cooked and my chicken was overcooked. The meal itself was cold. Just not how I would like to spend $60 for my husband and I.
Brenda R.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",0,31,,5.0,4/2/2010,"My husband and I eat out once a week. We have tried several places in our area and have a few favorites.  We are defiantly adding BJ's to our top 5 for casual dining.   The service is incredible. If you take the time to watch the staff, you will see a well oiled machine working. Everyone pitches in where needed.  Tonight, our waitress was extremely attentive and very friendly.  She was a delight to talk to. She  accidentally dropped a couple of glasses on the floor and the number of staff that came to her aid to help clean up was amazing. They even had someone standing watch over the mess to make sure customers didn't step in the ice and glass. Now for the food.  I'm a fish taco snob. I try them everywhere, and I have say, their fish tacos are the best I've had in a long time!  My husband had one of the hamburgers and he was very satisfied with his meal as well.  Now the kicker. We had 2 beers, 1 marg, two meals, great service, and a nice atmosphere for under $45.00!!!!  We are used to spending $75.00 +++ for a great meal. You have to try this place!  Just go early or call in for a reservation It is very popular."
