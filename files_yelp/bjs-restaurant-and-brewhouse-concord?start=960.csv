Marie P.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,41,,3.0,11/17/2009,"we tried to come here once before and peaced out because of the ridiculous wait, but we returned tonight and were pretty pleased... kinda like cheesecakke factory but a little more reasonably priced and although the menu is a bible here as well as @ cheesecake, it is not as overwhelming and doesnt offer as many heartattacks on a plate, so i GUESS its the better option?  the food was pretty close to as good as cheesecake but like i said cheesecake has more original options which can be overwhelming but can also be interesting. @ bjs u wont really find anything youve never had before.... we got potatoe skin platter, they were just perfect, not dry or overdone or skimpy on cheese and stuff.. also split beef sliders good and average, not out of this world (oddly enough chilis is better)  also split off the lighter side menu panko breaded halibut fish tacos which were very good and supposedly under 670 cal.... kinda hard to believe but ill take it... and only $7.50, pretty damn good ok so i really did like it and i will definatly go back i just dont feel it deserves a 4th star... it is too much like something else (cough cough * cheesecake factory) for me to be overly impressed and even tho prices are better its still not helping out americas obesity crisis thats for sure... but i would love for it to do well, and i think in these tough economic times its a great bang for ur buck!! next time you wanna pig out come here, youll like it, just dont expect a gormet meal across the board p.s.*  deep dish pizzas looked good, maybe bjs will earn their 4th star if i try them??"
Jessica M.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",22,78,4,3.0,8/24/2011,"food is ok, service is ok, watch out for the over waxed floors, it may be the death of you"
M A.,"Concord, CA",0,3,,2.0,4/9/2012,"Don't get excited and fooled by how modern this place is. Very clean, yes. Minus the pizza, much of the food seems similar to your basic chain brands (Chili's, Applebees, etc.) Service appeared to be slow on the day I wen't."
yelper l.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,69,,1.0,5/28/2011,i went there to watch champions league soccer final. for 45 mins i was staring at the blank screen. spent 30$ for nothing. food was ok. but i went there for soccer. I should have stayed home and bought 15$ package for 1 month soccer. Thanks for enlightening me with the fact that Directv is unreliable. btw. so i went to roundtable and watched the second half
Paola G.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",91,18,2,2.0,5/20/2011,"I can only speak for the Bar area, the service was horrible. Food was good but our server gave really bad service."
Sam K.,"Martinez, CA",4,22,,1.0,6/21/2010,"2 words folks..FOOD POISONING!.  I used to really like this place but I went on 6/18 and got the pulled pork and holy smokes, belly not happy. As I walked up I remembered a coworker ate the chicken and got really sick when he called, the manager did say that a few people got really ill?!.  But I thought, I'm not gonna eat chicken so no biggie.  WRONG!  Not cool."
Naomi F.,"Brentwood, CA",1,4,,1.0,9/29/2010,Terrible service...waited 15 minutes before flagging down a manger to tell them we have not even been greeted yet...food takes forever to get (almost 30 minutes). Have experienced this every time we go here...what is the hype about this place?
miriam l.,"San Pablo, CA",0,2,,1.0,12/18/2011,Waited 30 minutes to be seated 35 minutes for the food & it was wrong! First & definitely the last time I'll ever go there.  Waste of money!
Brick J.,"Antioch, CA",1,1,,5.0,12/15/2009,"Went here the other day and was very happy! We had to wait a while but it was cool because... you know the place is new AND its xmas time everywhere will have a year long wait!  We were seated by a friendly hostess 'jessica' she told us about the handcrafted sodas YUM! And then another Jessica was our server... She knew her shit! She told us all about their beers and which ones she likes, which ones were the favs of customers and then we were able to sample some. She picked the hef, red, and some berry cider beer and we decided to try the pale ale- YUCK. She was right. It was like chomping on a leaf! haha. But the rest were great. We ended up with a pitcher of their Hef      We had never been to a BJs before so we needed time with the menu, and had questions. Jessica was patient and helped answer our Q's. which was cool because Im sure we were annoying. :)   I decided on the grilled chicken pasta (its what the server recomended) and my friend got a pizza. Both were amazing! The food took a while... ummm.. so did the bar. But the place is new and PACKED. Everything came out right and it was all amazing. Concord has finally gotten a decent restaurant!!"
Kara S.,"Brentwood, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/13/2011,"Lately, I have been having a lot of issues with slow service but this was  by far the worst. My boyfriend and I got to BJ's at about 7 pm tonight and it was busy. I don't usually find that's a problem. We waited about 10 minutes to be seated. Once we were seated, we waited about 15 minutes for our server to come over and tell us he would be back in a minute(He did not introduce himself or anything). Ten minutes pass by and the manager comes by and asks if we had seen our server yet. She finds someone in the back to come over and take our order. We ordered everything at once(drinks, appetizer and main course) We got our drinks about 15 minutes after that in which our normal server dropped the drinks said his name was William then scuttled off. About 10-15 minutes later just my pizza came out. After the manager tried to fix it by bringing out our appetizer and telling her she would comp it, we left. Will never go to this place again."
Dave B.,"Concord, CA",0,13,,4.0,12/6/2009,This place is good. Nice wait staff and servers. Their beer is really good. Try the 7 sampler...only $10.00. I had a classic burger that was charbroiled (tasty) and my wife had a turkey sando. Both were good and decent price. I will be going back for sure.
Chris D.,"Martinez, CA",4,3,,1.0,8/15/2011,Just left bj's after a really bad experience. The hostess Samantha was very courteous and did her job well but after her this restaurant sucked we were seated and were not even acknowledged what so ever and sat there waiting as two other parties were seated after us and already were ordering drinks and appetizers. So needless to say we got up and left and made sure and let the service area know that their wait staff is not doing there job at all. I do not recommend this location at all and will not be returning.
Sony J.,"Vallejo, CA",0,2,,3.0,10/27/2009,"so I have been to the new BJ's twice first time great.... 2nd time not so much....first we order drinks sierra mist and club soda server comes back we are out or sierra mist i not having menu in hand ask what do you have similar he starts rambling root beers and lemonades then  my husband orders a turkey burger and he goes to ring in comes back and asks if he meant garden burger or was there actually a turkey burger on menu bc he cant find turkey in the POS system, ummm shouldn't servers know their menus??? then we wait forever for our food the mgr had to get us refills cuz he saw us sitting on empty, then our server comes and asks if we have saved room for dessert mind you we hadn't even gotten our food yet! he says let me check on your food passes by us 3 times and never once said it will be right up sorry for wait nada... having said that i am giving a 3 star because i was very impressed the first time we were here which was opening day!"
Catherine L.,"Concord, CA",0,18,,5.0,5/17/2011,"I  LOVE this restaurant!  The salads are wonderful.  The potato skins were very good as well.  My husband and daughter liked the pizza.  I met some old classmates there and we stayed over 2 hours on a Sunday afternoon.  From about 1 PM until after 3 PM.  No one rushed us. We had long since finished our food. They kept the refills coming on the ice tea and never tried to get us to move on.  I have been there several times now and still want to go back. Good food, great atmosphere."
Maria Y.,"Vallejo, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/11/2013,"We went there to have dinner yesterday. Worsed experience ever. Not only did we wait 10 minutes for the server to take our drink order but worsed yet 30 minutes to just get our drinks.when waiter took our drink order we thought that placing our food order also would expedite the process so we did. We waited, and waited....the server finalle shows up only to say that the salad we had ordered only came in a big size. She did not even notice that our drinks were not in the table so I told her which she responded that this was not her table but not ones did she aknowledge the fact that we had been waiting so long just for the drinks. She even Had the nerve to say it would take another two minutes to get our drinks never offered an apology .my question is were was the manager that is not looking over to make sure orders r taken on time And guest r serviced. Our food An hour to get to the table. Unbelievable. I get it it is a Saturday day night and the restaurants r bussy but to wait 30 minutes for drinks to arrive and an hour for food and waiter to  not  have sense of urgency it it completely of the parameters of customer service."
Elena T.,"Dublin, CA",0,91,,1.0,4/9/2012,"I LOVE BJ's. I come here all the time and have been to this location close to 20 times. I love that no matter what I am in the mood for, it's probably on their menu and good. We always have great service, even when it's crowded. Until yesterday. So it's Easter Sunday. Our party of 6 gets there when the doors open at 10. We are the only party there. we sit down. our waitress with long black hair in 2 braids, takes our drink order (all sodas.) Just from that interaction, I had a bad feeling. She didn't seem all there or to know what she was doing or something. About 10 minutes go by and no one has drinks. A party of 2 has since come in. That's it...our party of 6 and the party of 2 in the entire restaurant. She was no where to be found. She finally comes back. one person ordered a regular soda, the rest are all diet. She stares at the platter of drinks and says ""Oh..usually i put 2 straws in the diet to tell it apart from regular but I guess I didn't, so we'll have to guess."" Then she realizes as she is setting them on the table  that she put 2 straws in the regular. um..??? it's been like 5 minutes since you filled the glasses. She walks away-and SHOCKING-the regular soda is also a diet. REALLY? So 3 of us order from the breakfast menu (2 french toasts and a breakfast pizza) and 3 order from the regular lunch menu. so we wait. Finally 4 of our meals come out. The 3 lunch menu items and one order of french toast. so we all wait to start eating until everyone is served..and we wait...and there is no syrup or butter on the plate or table for the french toast either. Finally our oh so bright waitress shows up with the breakfast pizza and sees us all looking around and says 'whats the problem?"" Um..we still are short a plate and my dad asks for butter and syrup.  ""Oh.."" she says. So she disappears into the kitchen and gets the other french toast. meanwhile-the rest of us have been waiting for all of us to be served, so now ALL of our food is cold. By this time, one other party of 4 is in the restaurant. So 12 customers in the restaurant...and this crappy of service? after she sets the last plate down, she says ""is there STILL a problem?"" My dad said ""I still don't have butter or syrup for my french toast."" She SIGHS and goes back to the kitchen like she is put out. Are you KIDDING? she brings back a syrup and butter for my dad that ordered french toast-but NOTHING for the other person that ordered the same thing. Who eats french toast without syrup and butter? That would just be warm bread! why doesn't it come on the plate instead of asking for it?  By this time, we were all so irritated with the cold food and crappy service, that the person that got NO butter, just gave up and did without. NICE! We are very generous tippers, and I have to say, this was one of the rare times i  didn't even want to leave a standard 20%. Our family Easter brunch was a total wash. we all left shaking our heads. Not sure if i will go back. if i do, and i am seated in her section, I will ask to be moved. And by the way, when we left, there were still only about 20 customers in the whole place. NO reason for the lack of service we received."
Sandra O.,"Norwalk, CT",23,16,,4.0,3/25/2011,"Good burgers, and salads. nice staff and clean inviting place."
Arthur T.,"Concord, CA",0,44,1,4.0,12/18/2010,"Try the Irish Rootbeer! I always see these restaurants on the Food Network that have these great items that can't be obtained anywhere else except for that restaurant. Well I've found that thing at BJ's. The Irish Rootbeer is fantastic. It's made with their homemade rootbeer and it will give you a nice buzz. I've been to BJ's 3 times in the past 3 months. It is quickly becoming my favorite ""go-to"" spot when I want pretty good food with lots of options. My only complaint is that on Friday & Saturday nights you get the bar & club crowd which can be a little irritating. If you go during the day or on a weeknight you should be fine though."
Dino S.,"Concord, CA",22,9,7,2.0,1/30/2010,"The food was average, the beers were better. For a restaurant they do make pretty good pizza though. We have gone 3 times since they opened at this location and find the waiters/waitress were great, very friendly. However, we may stop going there because of a recent debacle with the restaurant manager. I caution you in advance if you plan to make reservations for large parties. We asked 3 times and 3 different hostess instructed us to call 24 hours in advance to make the reservations, however the manager argued with my wife that she could have made it days earlier. The afternoon manager on Jan.29th was a complete asshole. He needs to try to accommodate his patrons, but instead he was argumentative and rash on the phone. If I was there in person, I would like to see him talk to my wife or I like that. We are boycotting going there until he is removed from his position. We love going there, but do not respect the way management treats their customers. We are still waiting for his call back, his name was Mike."
Malena Y.,"Berkeley, CA",8,8,,3.0,1/24/2011,"I went in to BJ's with my sister after shopping last Sunday afternoon.  I was excited it was ""happy hour"" but really all that means is $1 off pints and a few dollars off appetizers.  We sat at the bar and waited about seven minutes before the bartender acknowledged us.  After tasting a couple beers, we both decided to try the Marin IPA (delicious) but none of the appetizers looked appealing.  The prices were a little high - even with the small discount - and I didn't feel like eating fried food.  I looked through the menu though, and found their ""small bites.""  The mini tacos with spicy barbacoa beef were great, and really reasonably priced.  They were a perfect snack.  At first the service was shoddy, but then another bartender showed up who, after speaking with him  for a minute, realized he is the same bartender that used to work at Stanford's restaurant in Walnut Creek. I  believe his name is Jessy??  Anyway, he made our experience really enjoyable.  The bar at BJ's is beautiful and Jessy is a great addition.  I'll definitely go back after another shopping venture, but probably won't go out of my way to hit up their happy hour - it seems as though there are better deals all over the Bay."
