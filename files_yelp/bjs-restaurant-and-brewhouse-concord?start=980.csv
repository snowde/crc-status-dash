Lori R.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,42,,4.0,4/24/2011,"Yep I liked it. Two friends and I went last week,  the meals we choose were Tai luttece wraps they were spicy sweet and yummy,  one had the giant baked patato and the other had the shrimp pasta both were happy with their meals.  I had the buscetta small bite it was cheap and tasty but even at the price not worth the $ it was four very tiny pieces of bread."
Steven O.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,712,1,4.0,8/8/2010,Love the pizza and potato skins at BJ's...wish they had better wings.
Jo M.,"Benicia, CA",2,2,,2.0,3/22/2011,Service was not bad.  Only thing I did not like about it is that the floor is slippery.  Didn't feel safe walking inside the restaurant.
Diane W.,"STANFORD, CA",3,376,,3.0,10/21/2012,hawaii miah OK chicken OK shrimp thing was good
K T.,"Concord, CA",0,2,,2.0,2/14/2011,"Had lunch here with a friend, she had the shrimp tacos which she said were delicious.  I had the Cobb salad which not only was the portion very small and had way too much dressing but the chicken was processed and cubed, not real.  The service was very slow.  We had to wait almost 15 minutes for our drinks, then our server never asked if we wanted refills, which we did.  Other than the shrimp tacos, this was not a positive experience, won't be going back soon."
Laura A.,"Martinez, CA",1,22,,4.0,9/6/2010,"Avocado rolls are delicious.  Balsamic chicken dish is very good.  Mini Pizookie (warm chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream) a great hit with entire family.  Service a little slow, staffed by young adults but ok overall.  Called 1/2 hour before we got there to get on list and table was ready within 10 minutes of us arriving.  Popular location."
Sasha V.,"Oakland, CA",2,88,,3.0,11/2/2009,I have been able to come here quite a few times now and over all the food has been really good. I have had the Cuban burger and the California grilled chicken sandwich recently and they were both good. One of the servers I had was Jason I think and he was an awesome server. Then I have had a few servers who were really good and some not very good at there jobs. I payed close attention to the bartenders lately and they are SO BAD AS BARTENDERS!!!!!!! I don't know if that is the way they are trained but WOW! They seem to be clueless on the most basic cocktails and then I saw a few of them making a drink that requires shaking and they don't add ice and barely even shake the drink. Plus they move slow and don't seem to have any confidence as bartenders. The beer itself has been inconsistent lately as well. There are times when lets say the Nutty Brunette is really good and then other times taste like dirty gym socks. I was able to try the sodas the other day and they are all good except for the cherry cola. And they are always out of the cream soda which is the best. This place is great but they need a lot of work and help to improve themselves. I know they are just your typical chain but even so they I haven't found myself liking them as much lately.
jjj z.,"San Francisco, CA",0,56,,4.0,1/27/2010,Healthy portions of great tasting dishes win me over every time. My favorite dishes are the meatloaf sandwich for comfort food or the Italian salad for eating somewhat healthy.
Matt M.,"Dublin, CA",6,121,13,2.0,12/16/2009,"The hiatus is over! After a lengthy break from the world of Yelp, I am making my Ali like return to the ring...er web. Bj's...oh such high expectations going on. I love beer; I love the taste, the complexity of it it, the bitter aromas, everything. My better half went to the Newark Bj's with some friends a few weeks back and recommended I should try it out too due to my fondness of the suds.  Long story short, we went to the Concord one instead on a busy Sunday night with some family. After a short wait which we were served snacks for waiting (very cool btw), we were finally seated and I was ready for a beverage. After a few minutes, the waiter took our drink order, then came back and took our food order and then we waited...and waited......and waited some more....then finally got our drinks nearly 15 minutes after we ordered them (I had to ask the waiter if remembered). Then within five minutes, the worst scenario in eating out unfolded before our eyes....the near same time delivery of the appetizer and entree. Literally 3 minutes apart, no one at the table had even finished their salads yet before pizzas starting showing up on our table. Then to finish the scenario my poor 18monther's food was forgotten about and came about much later.  What's strange is that similar to other yelpers, it too took our waiter nearly 10 mins to figure out the bill. 2 stars for the good beer ( jeremiah red was excellent) but after that, I'll come back when the kinks are worked out."
mimi g.,"Martinez, CA",0,8,,2.0,5/31/2010,"If you dine in make sure you have alot of time on your hand. Service is slow. Takeout is not much better, whatever they quote the time your food will be ready just add atleast another 15 mins."
Mateo S.,"Vacaville, CA",5,22,4,2.0,12/5/2009,"The only reason they get 2 stars is because the Beer is Delicious and the food was good. Granted they only opened a month ago, the workers can't seem to get it together there. They all look puzzled. The place is WAY to small for a BJ's. The location in Vacaville is way bigger and better. Concord's only has one section for large parties so good luck on weekends if you have a large party. (we had a party of 8 and it took us 2 hours to be seated) When we finally got seated we had 2 different people wait on us (which I knew was bad news from the start) sure enough our order got all screwed up. One pizza came out before anything else so 2 people from our party were done eating before others even got their food. THEN to top of a wonderful evening we waited 45 mins for them to get our check right... they had to have the MANAGER come out and do the check cause the workers didn't know what they were doing with the computer i guess... Granted we did get 3 free pazookie desserts and $30 bucks in gift cards for the inconvenience.. all in all horrible restaurant expeirence, good food, great beer as always BUT!! if u have large parties (and 8's not even large) go to another location until this location can get the act together."
Maria R.,"Benicia, CA",0,29,,3.0,4/4/2010,"My hubbie and I went on Valentines day.  Just now getting around to yelping.  Food was ok.  Plenty of tvs to watch, but they are a little too high for my neck and can't hear the volume.  We sat near the back and noticed a lot of workers just standing around, which was sort of annoying since we were still waiting for our food.  My Husband enjoyed his salmon and my salad was good.   Customer service was ok.  Gave it another try several weeks ago, it was about the same.  Appears to be a good place for a large group out for drinks and fun."
k o.,"Martinez, CA",0,8,,4.0,3/14/2010,"We were pleasantly surprised to find a well trained crew of waitstaff and bartenders to compliment a fine selection of beers and cocktails. The menu leans a little to the deep fried and overloaded plate audience, but we found some excellent flavorful choices like the Shrimp Taco and the Thai Shrimp wrap appetizer."
Ann S.,"Concord, CA",0,24,,3.0,4/7/2010,"I have been there three times in the past month. Their lunch menu cannot be beat when it comes to price. $6.95 for all you can eat salad and soup. It was nice the waiter kept asking me if I wanted a different soup or salad. Tonight I took my kids and we ate some appetizers from their little bite menu. The shrimp skewers for $3.95 was decent. It came with a few bites of veggies and rice. Perfect size to go with the yummy beer. I could just go there for beer. Service was a bit confusing and slow tonight, unlike the other day for lunch. The waitress looked tired. She did get a nice tip because she closed the tab quickly...I have to wonder if I was her last table!"
anna i.,"Concord, CA",0,2,,4.0,1/26/2010,"I've been to BJ's a few time and haven't been disappointed yet! I'm a big fan of their spinach dip and deep dish pizzas. They have a tasty selection of house made beers also. Good food, good atmosphere, good service. Our server, Lindsey, was very attentive and friendly."
Hugh J.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,1,,2.0,1/19/2010,"I arrived for my third visit since this location opened to meet a friend for dinner.  Upon arriving I had to wait ten minutes for a drink.  We were sitting at the bar.  My friend had to ask for service for me.  Neither one of the two bartenders noticed that I had arrived, and I had not been served.  Monday night football had ended, and the restaraunt was not too busy.  There were plenty of empty tables.   I intended to order food when I arrived.  However the bartender that served me a BJ's Porter neglected to offer me a menu.  Once I had finished my porter I was going to have a stout, and order dinner.  After waiting over tfifteen minutes I finally became disgusted, and left."
Nicole D.,"Martinez, CA",70,5,,2.0,1/5/2010,"Worst service ever.  Food was good, but I thought I would never leave!  We sat down at our table and 15 minutes later they said that we were never assigned a waiter!"
Melissa D.,"Oceanside, CA",0,11,,5.0,11/4/2009,"I went to BJ's for the first time last night, and the waitress we had I think made the experience 10 TIMES BETTER! I wish I could remember he name, but she was so nice and fun and actually cared about serving us. She said we weren't even her table but she saw that we had been sitting there for a while so came right over!!! I will go to this resteraunt as often as I can. The food is well piced, the beer is AWESOME, and other than some sloppy drunks hangin out at the bar, the atmosphere was perfect."
Rob Z.,"Pacheco, CA",0,4,,1.0,10/29/2009,"Awful experience.  Went with a group from work and waited 15 minutes to seat our group of 7 when there were 6 people in the entire restaurant.  Then waitied another 15 for anyone to ask for our drink order.  Then the server returned to dump the tray of drinks on us, the table, and the floor.  He walked away in embarrassment and we sat there for another 10 minutes until some other server came to clean it up.  No one apologized.  No manager came over.  Food came out incorrect after 55 minutes.  No soap in the bathroom.  No consideration on the bill for having drinks dumped on us so we asked for the manager. Over 15 minutes later he finally showed up.  We explained what happened and his response was ""well that's not what the server said.""  We have never made a complaint about service in our life.  This was a horrible one and a half hour experience and we will never go back.  They finally tried to make it right by adjusting our bill but it was too little, too late."
Alan V.,"Hercules, CA",18,269,3,3.0,4/5/2011,"the cheeseburger pizza could have had more cheese and burger, the scoop of ice cream over the cookie was good tho, spinach dip was just ok, i will come back and eat the same things"
