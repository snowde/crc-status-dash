Nik M.,"Pompano Beach, FL",6,29,1,3.0,1/8/2018,"I have been here a few other times and each time I have had a ""meh"" experience. But there has always been a personal reason. Once I was trying to eat healthier and I tried to order from the ""enlightened"" menu. (I HATE healthy food. Just isn't me, particularly when dining out)Another time was the grand opening and we were kind of forced into our item. This time I went with high hopes and was let down. First of all the place is as dead, but for some reason it took at least 5 minutes for someone to seat us, and the person who sat us seemed annoyed that she had to. Once we were sat our drink orders were taken and then our server vanished. We closed our menus (signal for ""we are ready to order"") and waited. It took about 10 minutes to place the order. Once we placed the order it took almost 20 to get our food. And as I said before, the place was dead. Our server checked in once to see how we were doing then vanished again. We all finished our food and he finally appeared to ask if we have room for desert. We didn't, we were ready to go.  Overall the experience was very underwhelming. Nothing bad, but nothing to make me want to come back. If you have average food you need to have awesome service. If you have a heave service the food needs to blow me away. Tonight we got average everything.  Can't see a reason to go back."
Brooke S.,"Pompano Beach, FL",241,11,1,5.0,1/6/2018,"My mom and I went on a Friday around 6, so there wasn't a wait to be seated yet. The restaurant is pretty large, however when we were leaving a little after 7, there was a considerable amount of people waiting.  Our waiter Connor was very attentive. They now use a sort of iPad to take orders, I assume to decrease the amount of error (which I find pretty cool). We each had a glass of wine and started off with the spinach and artichoke dip as an appetizer. It was a great size and came hot with a bunch of chips.  On the weekends they are running a new special which includes this double on the bone pork chop that comes with a honey mustard sauce on the side. My mom ordered that with two sides and it was delicious!  I had their sirloin with two sides and I thought it was rather yummy! We were too full to have any dessert, however I do recommend a pazookie if you have never had one!  The restaurant has a real cool vibe and is definitely a great place to bring the kids or celebrate an exciting event!"
Janika G.,"Boca Raton, FL",4,53,43,1.0,1/4/2018,"This was single handedly one of my familys worst experiences out at an establishment period...in the history of our dining out..if i could give them negative stars i would.  We sat for 14 minutes before being acknowledged by our server (she was not attentive until my muscular attractive brother showed up halfway through our meal.. and allllll of a sudden she realized the rest of the party existed..what a hot mess). Food was awful, lots of salt on already superbly salty chips that came with our spinach dip (they were old chips salted to the max n probably sprayed with pam as they left the kitchen bad..notice my emphasis on salt!).. Burger was bloody raw when my brother asked for well...now cmon i have seen a rare burger with more color & sear on it.. My meatballs and mash had already formed a skin on it..on both potato and the sauce covering meatball..just gross..why in gods name would you even serve someone this crap...i could never present anyone this plate of food...i immediately sent it back and was so turned off i couldn't dare order another thing for myself. Meanwhile my poor nephew is complaining the cheese on his pizza tastes funny..we all taste it and low and behold it actually did taste funny..he picks then eats only the pepperoni and disregards the rest. My hubby had a Tennessee chicken sandwich..dry as hell and just a overpriced KFC sandwich without the pizazz of KFC (and i dont care for KFC but they actually won this round..sadly and thats not saying much). The store smells of dirty mop, dirty rag, and humidity mixed with dirty dish water...POW it hits you as you go into the restaurant..i honestly had a bad feeling when the smell hit me before the shenanigans began and i should have just moved our party to chillis or someplace close by...im sorry to say but every person in my party had major complaints.. The only thing enjoyable, tolerable, and edible was the beer, my husbands side salad, my nephews pink lemonade...yup yess thats it!!!. Don't even waste your time here anymore things have taken a nose dive for the worst and as a family we will not be returning..i always give trys but things have been slowly going downhill at this location and today was rock bottom for us..it was all just plain nasty."
MICHELLE C.,"Plantation, FL",2316,2081,4444,3.0,12/29/2017,"The menu is huge with many options for food. I enjoy swinging in for a quick lunch. The bar area is large which is where I prefer to sit. They offer many beers, liquor and wine.  I usually always order their deep dish pizza individual size which is perfect for one person. The crust is very good, ingredients are fresh and plentiful, decent sauce as it always satisfy a me.  My daughter ordered the ham and cheese on a garlic sourdough bread which was delicious. I had wished I ordered it. I had a patron margarita which was made very well and my daughter enjoyed a great Bloody Mary.  Been here many times and the service is usually fairly good. On this visit our server was not that friendly. She was very rushed, and did not check on us much.  For a decent lunch or happy hour this is a good spot to hit up. The food is good, drinks are well made, service can be spotty."
Britanee S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",76,73,538,4.0,12/15/2017,"Last night I stopped in for dinner for a Thursday night the house was packed. Upon signing in with the waitress she alerted us the wait would be about 15 minutes. That time seemed pretty fair to me so I grabbed a seat and waited. We waited no longer than about 5 or 6 minutes and were notified via text our table was available. While entering the restaurant and while sitting waiting for our table I looked around at the decor and building  architect which I found to be very nice. Its nicely built with a rustic feel to it. The colors are settling dark browns, deep mustard yellow, deep dark orange. Very settling and relaxing if you ask me. Decor defintely received 5 stars from me.  Once seated we were provided our menus and it was a very large one with many varieties. This in some cases can be bad or good depending on the person. For a drink I chose the special of the day Titos Vodka and pineapple juice and it was yummy. After we started off with calamari as an appetizer and this was indeed a great choice. After looking at the menu for a while to choose my dinner I finally decided on the Barbecue chicken deep dish pizza. The presentation was nice. The pizza its self pretty average. I was able to also taste some of the Ribs they have on special for thursday as well and they were pretty good. I shared a mini cookies and cream Pizookie and it was amazing. Totally a fan fave for me now, I cannot wait to try this again. Overall the food was pretty average for a restaurant so I would defintely rate the food 3 out 5 stars. My waitresses was very nice, friendly, accommodating, and attentive. She made sure to check on us quite often which sat very nicely with me since I've experienced it oh so many times how servers can leave you behind. Even as the night went on her attentiveness slowed down a little but it's totally understandable. I still would rate her a 5 out 5 just for her effectiveness. Its appreciated.  As far as pricing it is a wide variety which is very accommodating and affordable for everyone's lifestyle. I would like to go back and try this place again. I would definitely get something different for dinner but surely would go for the calamari again"
Eli N.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",12,234,134,2.0,12/22/2017,"I've been here a few times and typically like this place but today, damn, just see the pic. Still ate the food and it was ok but they've done better in the past. This experience wouldn't deter me from going back because I know what I've gotten there before but the time I go to make review,  they blew it. Give them a chance. My steak was cooked ""burnt"" instead of ""medium"" and the avocados were way past ripe. C'mon man."
Sher R.,"Pompano Beach, FL",33,14,33,4.0,12/22/2017,"Food was fast, service is ALWAYS good here at this location (Coral Springs) We had the thin crust pizza( very good), the chix tenders( very good, crunchy not dried out) multiple dipping sauces.. We also had a dinner salad( Cesar was good, House... not so much) Desert was the three cookies with vanilla ice cream. Very light if you want to pick at good flavor but not overstuff yourself as there small.. the price is good for 3 at $10 for two ppl though.. My only issue is they don't serve coke products, I'm not a Pepsi fan.. but the atmosphere is genuinely nice and roomy.. like a big European mansion or something with sconces on the wall & portraits of men in wheat fields.. pretty cool."
Jose M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",205,16,2,1.0,1/4/2018,"We tried this place for the first time. After a 15 minute wait  to be sat (not bad for the area) the server finally acknowledged us after 20 mins to say that she was sorry for the wait then walked away. She came back 10 minutes later to take our  order. She passed our table for the next 10 minutes and we still had not even water at the table.  I never leave restaurants, but this was one of those times."
Carl C.,"Pompano Beach, FL",57,2,,3.0,1/5/2018,"The atmosphere the location the service were terrific, the food was mediocre at best. I got the tomato and cheese salad, when presented, it was such a menial portion that it looked like someone had already eaten the rest of it. When my full slab of ribs came it came with an ice cream scoop of mashed potatoes and the ribs on the plate. Poor presentation, no excitement, but they did taste good."
Jay G.,"Pompano Beach, FL",2,215,107,4.0,12/11/2017,"I had been before and found it too crowded but last night went for a late dinner after 10 pm and found the food to be very good. We had the ahi tuna salad which was large and delicious.  The spinach and artichoke dip was fresh and hot with light crispy chips. The tortilla soup was wonderful too.  I ordered a side salad and it was the best side salad I had ever had.  Great variety of lettuce, carrots cucumber. Nice sized and added blue cheese crumbles. Very nice.  Because it was late the service was very attentive. We had the benefit of happy hour so the drinks were $5 call drinks. Which was also nice So while I may not always go when there are crowds (and now I know why) I will go at off times at it was really quite good and good value for the money as well"
Jim M.,"Parkland, FL",27,15,38,4.0,10/21/2017,"Called ahead for quicker seating.  Jenna was our waiter and the food and side came out fast. Ordered the apps: wings, mushrooms, calamari, fried artichokes. Main courses ribs, prime rib and hickory burger. Burger 8/10, prime rib 9/10, ribs 7/10. Apps were okay, wings average. Service was very good, personal but not in your face. Timing was fast but arrived just before 6:30 - dinner with deserts done by 8:00. Oh yes the deserts are awesome and root beer and beer selection are very good. Desert we had the pizookies one the triple chocolate and monkey bread. Off the chart great! 10/10."
John H.,"Coral Springs, FL",2,88,144,4.0,11/2/2017,Salmon and pecan crusted chicken were very good. Love the cream soda. Be sure to checkout happy hours for the best deals. After 10pm and after 3pm.
Didianka P.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",6,15,27,3.0,8/24/2017,"First time last night eating here for my friend's birthday, it is new! Peruvian Quinoa Bowl Brown rice blend with sautéed spinach season tomatoes a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, lemon juice choice of meat/ protein, I had shrimp. It was wayyy better than what I had before this. It was very flavorful and really Peruvian with the tastes. The shrimps were cooked perfectly. The spinach was okay not head other heels, it just added a different texture to the dish. A side of fries did not come with it I just asked for. The French fries were greatly salted and not soft which is a plus.  This is dish is....   Didi approved"
Nancy M.,"Coconut Creek, FL",1144,607,3201,5.0,5/13/2017,"Arriving anywhere at 7 15 on a Saturday night the waits going to be murder. We called ahead and reserved a table so our wait was literally 5 minutes and the line was way out the door and the restaurant was filled to the brim. We were taken to a large crescent shaped booth and sat comfortably. We ordered drinks ( I had a Caribbean mai tai mule which was a rum based mule. It was so good, I had two!) I also had a spip of the orange creamsicle soda it was really great   . We also ordered appetizers which were the avocado egg rolls which are deep fried stuffed with avocado cilantro shredded carrots and red chilies which really gave it a kick. Those were my favorite. We also ordered fried calamari and for some reason it was warm not hot like it should have been (mine was kinda almost cold in my opinion) so when our waiter Alex asked how our appetizers were I said the calamari was cold. He immediately removed it and brought a fresh cooked order. Very cool of him to do and what was even cooler was GM Scott Goldman coming to the table to apologize for the med warm calamari and informed us it was taken off our bill. He didnt have to do that but that was a very classy move on the GMs part. Right there you could tell Scott takes pride in his restaurant and does an above superior job as GM. Thanks  Scott! For entrees we had the salmon and the Parmesan encrusted chicken. I had a taste of the chicken and it really had a crispy Parmesan crust that tasted delicious. Im on a diet and had the grilled salmon broccoli and rice. The salmon was absolutely fresh, grilled to perfection and was healthy. I loved my salmon. My ex fat lous mom was with us because this was like a pre mothers day meal. She had the salmon like I did and she had hers Cajun. Lou was the one who had the Parmesan chicken.  For dessert we had the chocolate chip macadamia nut cookie with ice cream on top (I had three teaspoons of that ,,1300 calories for the entire dessert so I thought I maintained some sort of diet mindset by only having a taste. It was really good, warm and the melted ice cream was the topping on the cookie (like the icing on the cake) and I loved it! I enjoyed my meal and I was treated so good here tonight I would definitely return! The menu was huge and there are so many other items I want to try. A great meal was had by all."
Nicole Marie C.,"Coconut Creek, FL",2,26,30,5.0,9/24/2017,"This restaurant is amazing. Its always my first choice. They have different kind of food and affordable! Their unique dessert called Pizzoki is SUPEB, the monkey bread one is my favorite. As well as deep dish pizza and the rooth beer glazed ribs  recommend a 190%"
Vincent L.,"Deerfield Beach, FL",0,15,28,1.0,4/27/2017,"Bring my wife here for a lunch today. Spent 1 hour+ for a lunch (1 clam chowder, 2 meals, 2 beers) the service from the server (Erica M) took too long, ask for a glass of water took 5 minutes, I have to wave the check in the air for 2 minutes in order of some other male server come over pickup the bill ?? I only able to see my sever (Erica M) for the first 15 minutes when we sat down, then slowly when the restaurant starting to fill, I couldn't locate my server ? After the meal, my wife ask for a glass water took 5 minutes, and we are ready to pay our bill couldn't find anyone, I have to wave my check book in the air for 2 minutes to catch staff attention, my next table sat down for 10 minutes still haven't place their drink order.  Overall, the restaurant look great, their home brew blonde light beer was good, food are ok (not great or wow), service are horrible (under staff or not proper train)  Only if you have a lot of time to spare/kill, otherwise I'll not recommend anyone come here for a meal."
Alex R.,"Coral Springs, FL",143,139,1790,5.0,3/23/2017,"I have been to BJ several times now, and I have been happy with my experience every time. The service is friendly. The food is really good. I usually get the Salmon with steam vegetables, and it is really good. They have some good special on wines on Sunday. It is a good place to grab dinner in Coral Springs, and they are open until late. I will be coming back."
Katherenny V.,"Pompano Beach, FL",36,20,2,4.0,12/6/2017,Their chicken tortilla soup in a bread bowl is amazing. It has a little kick to it. Their pikozies ( not sure how to spell it) are the best desserts ever.
Harsh M.,"Seattle, WA",107,143,182,3.0,10/9/2016,"We needed to get out somewhere for drinks and food on a Friday evening. This place was in my bucket list for like 4 years so decided to go here. On arriving we were told that there was a wait for more than 1 hour. This was surprising because we could hardly see people waiting and they don't take reservations. We decided to go elsewhere and went back to return the buzzer. At this point we were told our table was ready. One hour to 5 minutes that's poor estimation. Anyways we were happy get a table without going elsewhere. We ordered beers and watermelon basil margarita. The cocktails were obnoxiously sweet and the beer was served after I got my entrees (which didn't come for an hour or so). In all disappointed on the drinks. For appetizers we ordered spinach stuffed mushroom (good), portebello strips (good) and honey glazed Brussel sprouts (decent). For entrees we ordered half a rack of ribs with chicken tortilla soup and side of fries. Crispy jalepeno burger with potato wedges (good). Tip: Go for wedges over fries. We ended up paying 50$ per couple with the coupon. It took 2.5 hours for the whole dinner and the service could be whole lot better. I think the management needs to add more servers."
Bob W.,"Boca Raton, FL",0,22,55,1.0,4/11/2017,"What has happen to this place.  The service was horrible!!!!! Trying to find out server was like playing where's Waldo. The staff was working like individual departments instead of a well trained team.  The manager Scott only seemed to care about the interviews of today with potentially new employees.  Our food took almost 40 plus minutes to come from the kitchen, which they were not even busy."
Savanna M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",254,966,4960,3.0,6/30/2016,"For some reasons the engineers at my company are obsessed with BJ's.  Personally I think it's a bit too far away from the office to come here for lunch, but they insist it's worth it, and with the pre-ordering option it makes the lunch not run too long.  Those are their opinions, but not mine after visiting here lol. It was a coworker's farewell lunch, so I was somewhat obligated to go.  The ordering ahead sounded like a good idea, and with a party of 20 it definitely is the way to go.  However, this means your food might come out slightly less than fresh (the bun on my burger was quite soggy, another coworker complained his lettuce was rather wilted etc).   We arrived at noon on a Tuesday to find an empty restaurant.  The hostess said she wouldn't seat us for our reservation until half the party arrived, again, we had pre-ordered our food and the place was empty!, so I found this to be a bit odd, but eventually we were sat.   Due to our numbers I think we were given two or more servers which was good for drink ordering etc, but perhaps still not enough as my water went un-refilled.   Those who ordered appetizers, side salads etc, got their food first, and then the main entrees came out.  We had placed our orders ahead of time with names attached, so it did help when the food came out and we had to determine what belonged with who.  I ordered the portobello burger (no actually burger, just mushrooms) with wedge fries.  It was decent, nothing to rave about, and again the bun was pretty soggy, but I'd give it a solid 3 stars.   The menu here is pretty extensive, so there's definitely something for everyone, which is a plus.   The check came, and the easiest thing was just to divide it by 20 and handle it that way per person, so that may be one flaw in ordering in advance too (no individual checks).   Lunch actually took close to 2 hours including the drive, so I'm not too sold on the claim that ordering in advance can make this a quick lunch. If I was in the area I'd consider eating here again, but I won't be coming back for any work lunches, if I can help it lol."
Steve S.,"East Greenwich, RI",8,23,56,4.0,1/29/2017,"Consistence, friendly, coursetly and friendly.  Good food great price and a real nice comfortable atmosphere.    Great to watching as sports too.     Join their frequent prgagram and receive all kinds of extras.  They appreciate your business."
Willie T.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,1,,1.0,12/2/2017,"We have always gone to Bjs restaurants, in Tampa and Pembroke Pines BUT, this one in Coral Springs needs to adjust their service, for the last few times that weve gone here we have called ahead 30 to 45 minutes, and Every Time we get there, they always tell us that were next or almost there and we end up waiting 30 min to 40 minutes, and then you notice other people show up and they pass them through quickly,  so it makes you wonder why...I speak to the manager and she says pretty much you just have to wait. I ask if theres any point of calling in and she never anwsers me, everytime we go here I have to keep asking the hostess how many more people are before and I dont get called until the whole lobby clears up. They never tell me how many people are waiting, seems like trickery.Their hostess  that was here tonight, Saturday night was rude, she acts like it didn't matter wether your attended or not, she should ask someone if people dont come back theres no need for a hostess. Coral Springs  Bjs should learn from Pembroke Pines how to treat their customers!"
Sherrie K.,"Margate, FL",64,60,260,3.0,3/5/2017,"My boyfriend and I went here for lunch on Saturday. The place wasn't very busy so we were seated pretty quickly. We chose to sit outside. Unfortunately, it was really windy that day and the shades they had up kept slamming into the building making a loud noise. It caught me off guard the first time lol! The waitress was nice but service was a little slow. I ordered a mini meat pan pizza and my boyfriend orders spaghetti with meatballs. My pizza was very dry. It had hardly any sauce in it. Other than that it came out hit and fresh and had a lot of neat. So they weren't skimpy in the meat but definitely were with the sauce. My boyfriend said he loved his food. He said it had a good flavor to it. This was my 3rd time at this location. I've never been overly impressed by it but they do have a lengthy menu. I'm sure anyone can find something they want to eat here."
Audrey G.,"Pompano Beach, FL",32,120,82,4.0,7/5/2017,So I've been here 3 times since my last review. I think the burgers are terrific and I love the Santa Fe and barbecue salads. The Santa  Fe dressing on the barbecue salad is dynamite!!
Holly S.,"Pompano Beach, FL",403,369,434,4.0,11/23/2016,"I liked it a lot but didn't really love it.  I'm not sure what kept me from that 5th star buy something (maybe the ambiance) was off.  Food selection is pretty decent (sandwiches, salads , American cuisine). I guess Innoway this place reminds me of a really big open spaced Bennigan's. We both ordered sandwiches which were really good and of course had to order some drinks to go with it as well. I had the caprisi piadina (I am a big fan of mozzarella and tomato together). This came with shoestring fries which is so so so much better and steak fries. For dessert we split the BJ's Baker Beignet.  The one thing that I will say that I really liked is that there is a very big selection. Sometimes I can be overwhelming however I have been to restaurants before and I just did not like a single thing on the menu and this case if you have dietary restrictions or eat a particular way there's pretty much guaranteed to be something for you here.   If you go on the website it lists gluten-free options as well."
Danny M.,"Coral Springs, FL",25,3,,2.0,8/18/2017,Food was very mediocre. I had the prime rib which was over cooked. I asked for a salad wedge no blue cheese. Was brought out with blue cheese. They took it back and it returned the exact same way. Cheese sticks were good.  No attention to detail. Staff needs better training.
Alan L.,"Parkland, FL",0,17,1,2.0,6/9/2017,"Tonight we had a substandard experience at BJs.  Usually it is okay, middle of the road chain restaurant. My wife ordered the Brewhouse Burger well done.  When it arrived, it looked like a diner burger that had been smashed down on the grill, and it was rare inside.  We got the server to bring it back, and it took some time for a new one to be delivered.  The server told us the manager would be bringing it, but that did not happen - maybe why we waited to so long.   When the second one came, the server did not wait to see if it was okay or come back to check on us.  I had to flag him down, because the second one was only slightly more done than rare. We were offered a ""free"" dessert as an apology, but we do not eat that stuff.  Iwould have thought there would be an apoogy from the manager, or some credit offered for the burger.  It is not hard to cook a burger, and not hard to make sure it is cooked properly.  This was a disappointing experience."
Lee L.,"Ocala, FL",19,113,240,3.0,6/9/2017,"Bj's Restaurant is mediocre for its entrees and selection. The only reason I go here is for their chocolate chip pizookie to be quite honest! The ambiance on the inside of the restaurant is quite nice, giving you an upper class type feel however the menu just does not cut it for me. I struggled to find something to order because nothing caught my eye. This was my second time coming to Bj's and I've noticed that they changed the menu. I used to order the cajun chicken pasta, but now that's not available anymore. I was a little stumped because the one dish I liked was now gone!  BJ's menu to me is all over the place. Meaning what is the concept?  This time, I ordered the parmesan crusted chicken as my entree which came with roasted broccoli and mashed potatoes, but I mistakenly swapped the mashed potatoes out for a broccoli cheddar soup (HUGE mistake)! The soup was extremely cheesy, so I did not finish it. I was told by a friend after my experience that the mashed potatoes are to die for, so if you are going to choose this dish, then I guess stick with the mashed potatoes. We also ordered a couple appetizers,avocado egg rolls, calamari, artichoke dip and a California chicken flatbread. All of these items were pretty good, but nothing special or different than what you can find at a TGIF or Chili's. The ONLY reason I would be willing to go to BJ's would be for their chocolate chip pizookie!! It is basically a cookie that is baked in a deep dish (like a pizza) and has a couple scoops of vanilla piled on top. The cookie is warm and with the ice cream, you achieve that melt in your mouth chocolatey goodness!!! Plus, if it's your birthday, you receive a free mini pizookie with a candle lit in it! Bon Appétit."
Nicole V.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",416,431,1047,2.0,10/9/2016,"If you're in a hurry or even if you're not, this is NOT the place to come. I suggested this place for lunch for my friend's birthday. While I haven't been in quite some time, it has a diverse menu. We went on a Sunday at 1:30. I half expected a wait for a party of 5 people. We walked right in. The hostess sat us towards the back room away from the bar and there was only 2 other tables of 2 in the room. We looked at the menu for quite awhile before our server came over to take our drink order. We ordered 2 apps (artichokes and asparagus). She eventually made her way back with drinks. The apps were very good and she took our orders.  The food took an insane amount of time to come out and to make matters worse only 2 meals came out and 3 of us went without for about 10 minutes. All of the dishes should have come together!  I ordered a ""deep dish pizza"". The food runner who dropped it off was carrying it with tongs and warned me that it was extremely hot. Imagine my surprise when I took a bite and it was warm at best. It also wasn't very ""deep"" if you ask me but it had good flavor. Everyone else enjoyed their meals. My boyfriend ordered the New Orleans Jambalaya. It was pretty spicy so when he asked for a drink refill and it took more than 10+ minutes to get a water, I had to flag another employee down to see what was taking so long.  We were reluctant to order dessert because lunch was going on 90+ minutes already. When I mentioned my friend's birthday, the waitress offered a special birthday dessert. That took another 12 minutes! She failed to bus the table so we had dirty plates everywhere.... gross! To be proactive, I had my credit card waiting along with the $10 off $35 coupon I downloaded. Again, to get my card back and sign took an exorbitant amount of time. The waitress apologized for the ""little inconveniences"" that occurred. I honestly wanted to speak with the manager about the horrible service but I saw her running food and she had RBF so I'm not sure what good it would have done.   2 1/2 hours for lunch is insane especially when they were not busy! If they don't fix their service issues, they will most definitely be out of business soon. I've worked in the industry. I realize stuff happens, you're short staffed on the floor or kitchen but the basics like making sure your customers have drinks and food arrives at the same time is service 101!"
Julie C.,"Palos Heights, IL",14,114,48,4.0,6/17/2017,"American bar food. Couple of steps up from TGI Fridays or Chili's. Good for a quick, inexpensive meal and a beer."
Dave H.,"Boca Raton, FL",1176,675,784,4.0,9/5/2016,"Taste: we lucked out 3 out of 3 dishes Service: a bit slow but fine Decor: corporate contemporary Vegas Price for quality: ok, some decent deals Beers: some good brews and imports Really, they have some excellent veggie options and some really good beers amongst the schlock. Brussel sprout app with honey Sriracha sauce was Amazing! Portobello burgers were absolutely perfect: two caps per burger, heaps of sweet caramelized onions, fresh tomato, basil... oh man... Swiss cheese at no extra charge. The dessert was delectable.. a trio of ""Pizookies,"" small freshly baked cookies in mini deep dish pizza pans with ice cream dolloped on top; peanut butter, salted caramel and cookies 'n cream. Yes! They also have a refreshing sparking water with cucumber and mint that was excellent and was not charged. Honestly, one of the more deliciously tasty lunches this year."
Marianne C.,"Pompano Beach, FL",12,24,63,2.0,3/4/2017,"There are too many choices in South Florida for a great dining experience to tolerate mediocrity.  From the hostess who seated us without ever making eye contact and barked at us to wait for her to tell us to scan a rewards card, to the food runner who delivered our lunches 25 minutes apart, and the server who forgot about us and had to be flagged down for the bill, thank goodness I was with good company! Step it up, BJ's Brewhouse, step it up! (Except I won't be returning to see if they actually did)"
Ann Robin H.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",45,292,1813,3.0,3/15/2017,With all the bad review I wasn't excepting much well as you can see by my pics . I'm glad I went. The soup bowl was awesome as well as our server Matt . The bread bowl was awesome
Maria A.,"Pompano Beach, FL",37,163,208,4.0,5/18/2017,"Ordered over the phone and gave my BJ's loyalty number over the phone as soon as I finished placing the order.  I ordered the Thursday bbq ribs special, a bundle that includes a starter salad and a mini pizookkie (dessert), and was looking forward too getting a good value while getting EVERYTHING I was entitled to get with the Thursday ribs deal.     I arrived and my food was in a hotbox behind the Takeout counter so the Takeout employee put it in a bag for me and I paid.  It was explained to me that the kitchen made a full-size pizookie for me by mistake.  I didn't mind getting a larger pizookie.  But what I did mind was being charged extra for specialty side dishes I ordered:  roasted carrots, and, turmeric cauliflower.  And when I got home to discover the contents of the bag did NOT include the Caesar Salad I ordered [I minded].  I was so looking forward to the salad that comes with the Thursday bbq deal.  Disappointed."
Karen P.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",48,49,65,5.0,8/19/2016,"I can't believe I've lived in South Florida almost my entire life and I've never been here before. This restaurant is great!  My husband had two of the BJ's beer (the red and the regular IPA - both were great). I had their homemade cream soda which was sweet and delicious.  My husband ordered the bbq chicken salad which was good though not fantastic. The real star of the meal was my chicken bacon and ranch deep dish pizza - delicious flavors and the dough was soft and fluffy.  Lastly, dessert. Oh my. BJ's has their own special dessert called a pizookie. It's a big cookie with ice cream on top. They have multiple flavors. We got cookies and cream. Photo posted.  Also check their website - they post coupons. We got our dessert for free. You can also call ahead to put your name on the seating list, which saves some time especially on a Friday or Saturday night. Finally, I must mention our server, Melissa Faye. She was absolutely fantastic and a highlight of our experience at BJ's. She was knowledgeable about the beer and food, offered her own opinions and suggestions, answered all our questions, and was just overall friendly and welcoming."
Elaine K.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,2,,1.0,10/1/2017,"Very disappointing experience. They were out of every beer my daughter wanted to try, even those advertised on the board. The waitress was clueless about what beers were offered and very slow about bringing replacements after she made mistakes. The food was also slow to arrive and we were disappointed in the quality. It was cold when it arrived too since it took 45 minutes after we ordered. My husband was never offered a refill on his tea and to top off an unpleasant experience, the bus boy started clearing the table before we left and even asked us to help him to give him plates and silverware. Yikes!  Probably won't go back."
Andy V.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",936,1403,6924,4.0,1/12/2016,"Ever come to a place and not be in the mood for it and just worry you'd not like it for really no reason other than just not knowing what to expect? That was me at BJ's and I am glad I pushed myself to go. We got there, stood around while som girls talked who were working there and then eventually we were seated. It's a pub/brewery type of place so it has a cool vibe- darkish lights but well enough to still see your dinner companion and your food. It's large but not overly loud which tends to happen in these types of places. Our server was great. Our food came out so fast. My dining partner didn't like the way her chicken tasted so they immediately let her pick something else without any hassle. For my appetizer I had the Brussels sprouts with honey glaze on them- oh em gee. I could have ate my weight in those. And only 220 calories if you still have a New Years resolution. The portion wasn't big but it was delicious. The ahi tuna salad was pretty bomb. Full of tuna which a lot of times when I get this salad at places it's overpriced and small- neither is the case here. The wasabi was firing hot. The dressing was sweet and light and the vegetables were fresh and crispy. Their menu was much larger than I expected. Their burgers looked amazing as they were being served to people. Next time I go have to try their deep dish pizza, a burger, or one of their famous pizookies! Looks like I'm going to be coming back here pretty often."
Omar D.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",44,29,1,5.0,5/17/2017,Great location and superb service. Our waiter was great and the food and drinks were delicious
Brittany O.,"Boca Raton, FL",244,47,31,4.0,3/29/2017,"Walked in late around 9:15 on a Tuesday and asked to be seated outside, the hosted explained the outside area was closed for seating for the night. Okay I'll sit at a table, then she asked if we mind sitting by the bar and I explained I had a friend meeting me who was pregnant and we needed something that had a little more room for her. At this point the hostess seemed a little bothered at this point and said she needed to ask the waitress if it was okay which seemed a little strange but ok finally we get seated. The waiter we got was a very tall and handsome young man, he was very polite and knowledgeable. We waited a while for my friend to show up and he kept checking on us to make sure we were doing well, which is something I truly appreciate being a part of the biz I know how it can get. Anyway moving on to ordering the food, I couldnt decide between the Pulled turkey dip or the Parmesan crusted chicken, I asked the waiters advice and with no hesitation he replied the chicken. So I ordered it and it was amazing !!!! Getting on to desert now just so everyone is aware every Tuesday Pizookie are only $3 (the full sized one)!!!! I will be back on Tuesdays for that special.  On another note, after dinner we went out for a smoke and I notice there was no ash tray and  people were putting there cig butts in the cracks on top of the trash can which I think is very dangerous, possibly getting a butt can or something of the sort would be a great touch!"
