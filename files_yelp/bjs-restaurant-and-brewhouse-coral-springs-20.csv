Vinson B.,"Annapolis, MD",27,3,1,3.0,1/5/2016,"Food was good. House beers were pretty good. Our service was slow. Our waiter seemed to be new and was not very attentive. Other servers picked up his slack and got our drink orders and brought us drinks. Manager stopped by and we told her what was going on, but didn't seem to do anything. Would like to try again next time I'm in town."
Karin S.,"Buena Ventura Lakes, FL",18,30,1,3.0,8/25/2015,"Recently, it was my second time there with the hubby.  It has good service and the prices are pretty reasonable.  I had the fish and chips this time, not really that tasty like I was hoping for.  My husband had a meat lover type pizza which was ok nothing out of this world.  Now there selection for beers are really good."
Athena C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",27,22,1,1.0,3/15/2015,"Ok so upon arriving we were told a 1 hour wait. Didn't look that crowded but we chalked it up to being a Saturday night. Wrong it was because service was slow. We actually get called earlier and thought ambiance was pretty cool so we felt good and ready to order. Our waiter was brand new only 3 weeks in. Kind of strange they would put him on a Saturday night but he was trying his hardest to get it all right so I'm not mad at him......entirely. First question I asked was "" what's good here?"" He tells me, ""well we are known for our pizza and beer so yeah "" um ok. I have an encyclopedia of a menu in front of me and only thing that's good here is pizza? Well he was actually right because our food sucked and we didn't have pizza. I wanted ribs they didn't have. My son wanted cheddar mash they no longer served that even though it's still on their menu. The appetizer we ordered was supposed to be nachos. They were frito chips with crap on top. Gross. We got our drinks and my 5 yr. old was thirsty watching us drink because the guy forgot his drink. For like 30 minutes. Not kidding. My other son asked for a refill and never received. We were there for over 2 hours! I ordered a rib eye cooked medium. It was the dryest steak I ever had in my life. The waiter offered me A1 and forgot to bring it. My steak was halfway done and stuck in my throat by the time he came back. My mash potatoes felt like cafeteria mash. It was clear our food had been sitting out forever. My husbands sauce for his pork chop wasn't even a sauce by the time it came out. It looked like poop. I have pics don't worry. The kids meal didn't come with cheese for the burger so we requested it when we first ordered. My son was done with one of burgers before waiter brought out a slice of cheese. He charged us a dollar for that cheese too. I forgot to mention our food didn't come out at same time. 2 people were eating 10 min before everyone else then another meal then few min after the rest. We spent over a hundred bucks and left so unsatisfied and unhappy. It's just unbelievable to me how bad a place can actually be. I try and give benefit of doubts which is why I don't totally fault our waiter because he is only 3 weeks in but unfortunately our experience here has been the worst I have ever had at a restaurant hands down."
Garret N.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,3,,1.0,7/2/2016,"Cold, stale tasting food. The shrimp and asparagus plate was cold and bland. The menus were sticky and dirty. The utensils looked cloudy and dirty.The sodas were flat. Honestly, worst place I've ever eaten and I'm not picky. Do not be fooled by the looks...this place is disgusting."
Doug F.,"Pompano Beach, FL",27,11,11,1.0,2/24/2014,"Nasty! I have been here twice. The first time I had a burger and fries that were mediocre at best. I ordered the burger medium rare and it came out medium well. The fries are stock frozen type fries :( Today I ordered the chicken Cobb salad. I actually had to spit the first bite out into my napkin! Something was rancid in it!! I have never done that before.  The service is really bad and the prices are too high!  The decor is beautiful! Don't let it fool ya! Go down the street to Big Bear, that's what I'm doing next time."
Matthew W.,"Cooper City, FL",0,1,,5.0,7/16/2015,Love this place. Have been back 3 times already since our first experience a week ago. We encountered with a very nice young lady named cacee when we walked in we told her it was our first time and we were looking for somewhere to have my friends 20th wedding anniversary dinner. She was so very helpful and welcoming she gave us a mini tour of the dining room and gave us party menus to look over. I also asked to have happy anniversary written on the dessert and she was confused what to use saying they didn't have frosting but they would figure something out and they did! We ended up making a reservation and coming in on a Friday night. My friends were so impressed. They had the table ready when we got there. Our server was Sydney and she was lovely. She took excellent care of us and was very sweet. We had a wonderful experience and we will be back again to see them both again! God bless.
Sola M.,"Pompano Beach, FL",1,29,14,2.0,3/11/2014,"I decided to come back since the management was so nice about getting back to me since my last disappointing visit. I was focused on viewing things objectively.  They get an extra half star from me because the management was nice enough to send a courtesy card as an incentive to get me back in here. My husband really seemed to like his Parmesan chicken dish, and the clam chowder soup I got was pretty good. Our waitress was sweet and more attentive than I remember. We ordered a pizookie for dessert since there were rave reviews for that.  Why still only 2 stars? I also ordered the Mac and cheese bites, but to my chagrin there was a hair in my food. I guess it could happen to anyone, but it was really off putting after I came back in the give this place a second chance. The waitress was really apologetic about it, which was nice, but it's just not a pleasant experience. The restaurant would've bumped up to 3 stars for me, but it's difficult to give three stars with an error like that. Will I still go back? Sigh... Undecided. I tried to like this place, but I don't think I'll be back anytime soon."
Paola T.,"Pompano Beach, FL",146,42,34,1.0,3/20/2015,Service is not good. The menu is really big making it a bit hard to decide what to eat. The food quality and menu options is comparable to a TGIFridays.
Robyn W.,"Coral Springs, FL",26,55,14,2.0,7/27/2014,"I'm going to make this brief. First time at this location (just moved to Coral Springs) tried bringing my parents to one of my favorite restaurants.  1. 30 minute wait, ok it's busy for a Friday night.. We'll deal and wait. 2. When we get seated we are next to the loudest table (a family of 5) yet there was a party across the room of 15+ people and they were quieter!! 3. Ordered beers and we got our appetizers before our drinks.  4. Ordered a medium rare burger it came medium well. Sent it back because it was ALL wrong down to the toppings and sauce.  5. Manager was joking when customer was clearly not happy.  6. Second burger came medium well.  We ate and finished beers and left. I'm disappointed with the experience because I've never had anything like this with the location in Doral or Pembroke Pines. I don't know if my parents will ever be willing to give a second chance."
Dimeisa M.,"North Lauderdale, FL",20,73,36,3.0,7/10/2015,Honestly bjs is overpriced for the quality of the food. The only reason they get 3 starts is because of the pizzazokie
Erin L.,"Pompano Beach, FL",56,227,140,3.0,3/1/2014,Management contacted me and wanted to know what else they could do to make things better.   I think that's great!  Will try again.
Anthony R.,"Pompano Beach, FL",3,75,,4.0,8/31/2015,I have eaten here on several occasions. The servers have always been friendly. The food is good and it is a decent place.
Nick A.,"Pompano Beach, FL",107,335,187,2.0,12/3/2013,"Beers were watery & weak Apps tasted like they went straight from Walmarts freezer into their microwave then tanned under a heat lamp Pan pizza was pretty damn good though, tasted like pizza hut at the top of their game, some might not see that as a compliment  menu is about 10 pages long, its like a crappy album with alot of 1:45 songs never seem a more unorganized staff worst of all theres a 45 min wait to experience all this they need to give that nice building of theres to big bear"
Eric L.,"Montgomery, MD",21,46,15,2.0,12/24/2014,"Why don't I believe the locals? Love BJs in Maryland but this was the worst. Cold food, pitiful portion (really, is there a severe broccoli shortage?) and an an idiot of a manager.  Do yourself a favor and go down the road to the other brew house."
Leticia A.,"Coral Springs, FL",13,4,5,1.0,2/19/2015,"Bad service, we were sited outside so the waitress kept us waiting, she brought drinks and and appetizer but no napkins, after 15 minutes she shows up to take the order and when she brought the food (steak and vegetables) she forgot the silverware, my husband had to get up to the front of the restaurant to ask for silverware twice, even then it took good ten minutes to get it. The food was fair, I had fish tacos but the cole slaw was bitter, guacamole was weird tasting. We had to ask the waitress to turn on the TV, I don't know if they sit you outside to be ignored and to take you for granted, or may be they short on staff. Definitely not coming back ever, rather spend my money where they appreciate my business, so disappointed."
Rick N.,"Pompano Beach, FL",1,16,8,2.0,11/5/2015,We had company in from out of state and my wife loves their flat bread.  I spotted the root beet ribs and I do love ribs.  In all the years of eating ribs these are right at the top of the list as the worst tough no flavor and tough!  Everyone else was happy with what they had ordered but I vow never eat those ribs again.
Frank B.,"Pompano Beach, FL",2116,256,1057,2.0,12/10/2013,"The food is okay and the service is the worst. The high points are their outside sitting area with a fireplace and a fantastic bar!  The best bargain is there ""1/2 off Happy Hour"" appetizer in certain sitting areas all night long. (...the only reason to go)  Cheers!"
Stefan S.,"Parkland, FL",38,52,8,3.0,10/6/2013,"I was feeling ambivalent about how to rate this restaurant, so I settled for 3 stars.  The food isn't really bad, I just can't say I've tasted anything from here and thought ""wow!"" Usually, extensive menus confuse me, but I like how there is a broad variety of main courses to choose from. Where this place really falls short is with their service. Slow, slow, slow. Did I mention slow? Even slow to bring back your card/change after you pay! I wondered why there was always a wait, and now I understand that it's because of the sluggish turnover. I even noticed there was a manager dedicated to damage control last time I went in. She was armed with a coupon card as a way to ask for forgiveness from unhappy customers.  I'd eat here again, but if you're in this area, go to Big Bear instead."
Shari H.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",12,8,,4.0,11/20/2013,"My fiance and I visited this restaurant on a Thursday night for dinner.  When we arrived, I was already aware of the open seating on the patio and so we requested and sat at a table on the patio.  It was a little chilly out but we went ahead and ordered drinks and appetizers to begin.  This was my fiance's first visit and my second.  The drinks were good and the apps were fantastic, as I knew they would be.  It got a little chillier than I expected and our server, John was gracious enough to find us a table inside and help us relocate,much to the chagrin of one of the hostesses who was not pleased with this change.  We sat inside for a while before our new server attended to us which was a little off-putting after the prompt service we had received from John on the patio.   BTW, John wasn't even supposed to be our server on the patio, but saw that the assigned server was a little behind and decided to be proactive and pick up our table so we wouldn't have to wait. The entree was okay.  We ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken and a lemon chicken pasta dish.  There was way too much sauce on the pasta dish and the parmesan crusted chicken was a little bland.  It actually tasted much better the next day!  All in all, the apps at BJs are fabulous, drinks are great.  Jury is still out on the entrees.  I'll try it again before making a final decision.  Service is outstanding!  Kudos to John!!!"
Sierra K.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",139,205,40,1.0,9/23/2013,I wasn't impressed. This place is always packed because the people of coral springs never leave. It is the new hot spot because of size and abundance of alcohol. The food is not that good and service sucks.The waitresses were clueless about the type of beers. The place was not intimate and I felt like I could hear most peoples conversations.  Would only go back if it was empty and I had no where else to go.  Typical sports bar. That makes about five in coral springs. I really wish there were other places to go than the endless sport bars that all serve the same food. The waitresses know they will get business and act like they don't need the money.(again because coral springers never leave the area)  MEh.
