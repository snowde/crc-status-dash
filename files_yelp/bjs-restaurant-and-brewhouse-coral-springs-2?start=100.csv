Bogo E.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,3,,1.0,12/3/2016,"Worst customer service ever!!! Signing in online saying 35 minutes, coming to the restaurant to hear from the manager that we should wait another 35 minutes!!! All she could offer, instead of moving us to the top of the list is Sorry"" :((( Not good enough. Waist of my time. BJ's just lost a loyal customer."
Gina S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",152,58,5,2.0,9/28/2016,"Terrible terrible service literally every time. They must be incredibly poorly managed. The last time we waited 15 minutes until we were even greeted at our table. The food is fine, but not enough to make me come back.  Brussel sprouts are good."
Jennifer F.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",373,313,2975,3.0,12/31/2015,"BJ's Brewhouse was this years host for my departments annual holiday lunch. Being that they are a very large establishment they were able to accommodate our group for lunch (about 15 of us). While I'm not usually a fan of chain restaurants and don't review them often, the food was actually quite good and they also accepted a call ahead RSVP which I thought was convenient. Their menu is large and has a wide variety of food items fit for any taste. Their spinach artichoke dip and avocado egg roll appetizers, as well as, the burgers and salads would be my recommends. We ordered various entrees and appetizers that all came out quickly and were all cooked correctly the first go around. Their staff members were very friendly and service was attentive. We had a few different servers attending to our table which was nice considering we had such a large group. Since we were at a work function lunch I wasn't able to try any of their beer options which are their own creation even though they do not brew in house. They have a ton of really great beer option from their look of their menu and also offer a full bar with other specialty drinks. Even though the BJ's vibe is more upscale sports bar I wouldn't hesitate to come again with a large group for casual, night out, or special occasion."
Monica F.,"Pompano Beach, FL",635,94,191,5.0,11/18/2015,"BJ's was awesome. The service was great and quick, and our food was great. We used the $10 off of $35 coupon that we found on Yelp. The Parmesan crusted chicken was very good, but the dessert was even better! They have pizzookies which are basically heated up cookies with ice cream on top (and there are a lot to choose from!). We had the cookies and cream, chocolate chip cookie, and triple chunk with Ghiradelli chocolate. They were amazing! BJ's had a huge menu with many different options for whatever you were in the mood for. I will definitely be coming back to try some more food items on the menu and to have that dessert again!"
Barbara R.,"Coconut Creek, FL",32,56,56,4.0,4/19/2015,"BJs doesn't disappoint me! I love going in for a simple meal with friends to just have a good time and catch up. For the menu, I think they should update to more unique things, they do tend to have things I've seen before. The service is usually great. I just wish I could make reservations for 2! Only ""call ahead"" service is available if you want a reservation for small parties.  Bathrooms are clean and modern! I like the place and its cozy atmosphere."
Lori M.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,15,,2.0,5/12/2017,"The last two times we went, service was not good, but decided to try the rib special. This time we had a great server named Julie. She was friendly, helpful and efficient. There were 2 of us around 5:30 on Thursday eve. It was not at all busy.  My rib special arrived and the ribs and baked potato were room temperature.  The broccoli was ice cold. The other entree was fine. How can a place have a ""Special"" and when it's not even busy, serve it cold??!!  By the way, room temp baked potatoes can cause food poisoning. If they are leaving out potatoes and microwaving them when ordered, they are going to make people sick. Julie got it corrected, but a manger did not come out to check or apologize. Julie- get a job at a better restaurant.  BJ's does not deserve you."
D M.,"Key Largo, FL",227,101,48,3.0,3/5/2016,"It was ok. Beers are good, I like to try different ones. Tuna salad was not good. Service was not great. Flatbread pizzas are very good. I would go for beer and flat red pizza. It's not as if it's a cheap place either. Wish it was better, close to home."
Talisha M.,"Miami, FL",119,569,32,1.0,10/11/2014,Seriously I had a pub in my pizookie!! More like its a pubookie that made me want to pukookie!!! Beet salad was super tiny and nothing special & neither was the deep dish pizza. The wings were good. And the gluten free chocolate chip pizookie started off amazing until the pubic hair I found. So the best part is I showed our waitress & just apologized & walked off...no manager no discount...so I paid for that pub!!
Chris O.,"Pompano Beach, FL",119,9,1,1.0,9/30/2016,This place ruined our date night. Our calamari was rubber and our food took FOREVER. My burger would have been delicious had it not been COLD and the salad was WARM and WILTED. My wife's shrimp pasta was just a poor menu choice to begin with but left her with stomach cramps. Do yourself a favor and drive 5 seconds north to Big Bear Brewing Co. You can thank me later. I'm just disappointed we wasted our money here. I have MS so most of our money goes to medical bills. Our date nights are few and far between. Thanks BJs for ruining it
Surley L.,"Pompano Beach, FL",3,3,31,4.0,11/4/2016,"Normally, the ahi poke is great and one of my faves here. Not tonight. The taste was not up to par. The saving grace was the BJs favorite pizza. Still great. The dessert took time to arrive but the beignet is to die for."
Chris M.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,4,,1.0,5/5/2017,"We sat out on the patio for almost an hour this evening and were not even acknowledged. Ended up having to leave to find some food elsewhere. Service was pretty terrible tonight. We let them know at the desk on the way out and they seemed apologetic, but doesn't change the fact that we waited an hour and didn't even get a glass of water."
Elizabeth W.,"Coral Springs, FL",127,2,,1.0,1/30/2016,"This specific Bj's has to be the WORST service ever!!! We got seated pretty quick. (In 5 minutes)  But when we got seated, it took someone at least 10 minutes to come greet us and ask us what we wanted to drink.  When the appetizers came out, they were cold like it been sitting on the counter and so was my sister's entree.  When we ordered the pizookie, the cookie was burnt. The food was a disappointment and not to mention our waiter was horrible and had an attitude about everything since we asked him to take back a lot of things to the kitchen. He didn't apologize about anything and rolled his eyes the whole time. The Bj's in Pines is way better. Better food and better service."
Casey M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",115,97,67,2.0,12/3/2013,"So we decided to wait before eating here for a while based on all the bad reviews.  The reviews sort of made us under the impression that most of the issues for this place were primarily service related, which we were optimistic would work themselves out over time. Well.. service was unfortunately still an issue! We were some of the first people there for lunch, and we waited about 15 minutes for someone to come to our table.  There were only 3 other tables seated! :(  The food was pretty okay though. Their thin cut fries are delish. My husband had the turkey cobb sandwich, which he would not order again.  It sounded interesting in concept, but the quality of the turkey really killed the whole sandwich.  I ordered the jalepeno burger.. Hm.. let me break down my review of this item a little more in depth. Jalepeno Burger Breadown: 1.  I hate when restaurants only serve 1/2 lb burgers - it's too much meat! (This was the case at BJ's) 2.  The flavor of the burger was unique, which is something that makes a restaurant a keeper for me. The fried jalepenos were indeed tasty. 2.  Overall though, too much meat and too little flavor. :(  I would not order again. The beer was so-so. We are big microbrew fans, so we have high standards.  We would go back here, but mostly just because we were in the area looking for something to eat and didn't feel like going to Big Bear.  Big Bear has better food."
Jax G.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,22,,1.0,11/14/2016,"Stopped in around 9pm on a Thursday. Decent crowd but not extremely busy. It took 11 minutes to get a waitress to come take our drink order. We should've left at that point.Eventually we ordered our entrees and a chips & queso appetizer. It took a while and when the queso arrived it was cold enough to have formed a ""skin"" on the top. That's pretty bad. Entrees arrived 58 minutes after we initially sat down. Two burgers, fish tacos, and a kids mac & cheese. All fries were cold, one burger was cold, and the mac & cheese was so cold it wasn't even funny anymore. The waitress never apologized or even acknowledged that  everything was stupid slow. I'm generally a 20-25% tipper. Even when the food isn't great, I always tip based on service because the wait staff can't always control the kitchen. This was the first time in my life that I gave no tip at all. She truly didn't deserve her hourly wage much less a tip. Best bet is to go two blocks down to Big Bear Brewing and get a great meal and service."
Lindsey V.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,3,,5.0,7/1/2016,I was looking to try a new brunch spot and Big Bear was delicious! We ate the biscuits and gravy and the chicken and waffles. These did not dissapoint this Southern girl! Love the patio seating .  The hostess could be friendlier but the service was on point!
Ana B.,"Plantation, FL",669,199,394,3.0,8/1/2014,"BJ's will always have a special place in my heart. In college, it was a go to place for celebrations (birthdays, graduation, etc...) and celebrating because financial aid was disbursed. ""WE'RE RICH!! TIME TO GO TO BJs"".  But anyways I digress. This place seems busy all the time, but I've never had to wait long. They have tons of TV'S to watch games as well as a stellar happy hour. Their beer selection and cocktails are pretty good. I've had their calamari and lettuce wraps for appetizers, both are just ok. The fish and chips, just ok. The pizza, just ok. Overall, the food is just ok. But it is much better than other chain restaurants at the same price point. I will continue to come here and would recommend it, just don't expect too much. It's like going to a T.G.I.F or Chilli's, the food is not great but it's not bad and you are mainly going for the ambiance and $."
Linda L.,"Tamarac, FL",889,469,1794,4.0,8/6/2014,"The food was the normal bar and beer food. If you're looking for a casual setting or a good happy hour place, the atmosphere is fun here. A good place to watch a game too. I ordered the sliders and it was very good. Near patty was cooked medium rare and juicy. The fries weren't super oily. The berry sangria was delicious. Not strong but very refreshing. The bartenders could come to take orders a bit faster but they're nice."
Alison C.,"Pompano Beach, FL",141,3,,4.0,6/23/2016,"We went in on a Tuesday night.  Restaurant was crowded but not packed.  We didn't have to wait for a table.  Our waiter was kind and attentive but it seemed like he had too many tables as he was rushing around and I felt the pace was a bit slow. Very nice, though. Food was delicious.  A bit on the expensive side."
Christian D.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",91,165,213,2.0,1/12/2016,"I have been to this location several times and it is the same thing over and over: Mediocre service, overpriced underwhelming food. Go there if you have absolutely no other choice in the entire city."
Michelle M.,"Tamarac, FL",2,35,42,4.0,3/3/2016,"I've been here many times. It's a chill, cheaper restaurant that has a huge menu and the food is great. Today I came in with my son and my friend who is home from being out of town for a while. We were both starving. We started with the ""best beginnings"" appetizer which has a little of everything and it was amazing. We shared a deep dish veggie pizza and then split the Oreo dessert which was by far my favorite part of the meal. I would have given this place 5 stars but the service was not the best. Our server was very ""meh"" every time I would say thank you...she never said ""you're welcome"" or anything just silence. She couldn't hear us the entire time and she just seemed like she did not want to be here. I tipped 20% just because but she definitely didn't earn it. I'll be back & hopefully we will be with a more cheerful person."
