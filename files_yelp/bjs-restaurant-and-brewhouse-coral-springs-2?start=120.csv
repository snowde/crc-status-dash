Christina M.,"Tamarac, FL",52,10,2,5.0,11/20/2015,"This place is a nice spot to grab a nice cold beer and a meal. When it first opened service was horrible but they have gotten way better.  Tonight there was a 40 minute wait but we got lucky and found s booth at the bar which is first come first serve.  We had the blonde, our favorite. And the appetizers were the potato skins...also our favorite. If you're going to get a burger or sandwich I highly recommend the wedge fries.  We used the $10 off on $35 or more. We will keep going back."
Scott B.,"Pompano Beach, FL",9,180,100,3.0,9/28/2015,"When this location first opened we visited several times and it was hit or miss with food and service.  The location also appeared the hot new spot and wait times increased substantially. We recently started revisiting and had two stellar meals, one with the kids.  The menu has shrunken a bit, but still larger than needed.  They offer several pizza types, but deep dish is most offered.  They also offer stacked burgers ( mine was topped with shredded BBQ )and many bar like offerings.  Wife loved the fish and chips, the fish was light, fluffy, and not fishy or oily. The challenge is seasoning as they need more while cooking and in their dressing and sauces.  The Piszookies (desert baked cookie) are rich and worth every penny.  Kids loved the salted caramel offering.   Our servers on both nights were very accommodating and well trained.  The wait was reasonable and call ahead is offered.  No management was seen on floor in either visit nor mingling with visitors and clients.   They offer a Reward program but blatantly take back your points if you don't visit enough within a year !"
Scott O.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,14,1,2.0,3/3/2016,"Went 2 weeks ago with a buddy on a Thursday at 7:30. The place was pretty busy but there was immediate outdoor seating. We waited almost 10 minutes before a server came by to take our drink order. Mine was a Tanqueray and tonic. When it came it was visibly flat and tasted the same way. I sent it back and received another that wasn't flat but was close to it. We order an everything deep dish pizza. I'm on a low carb diet and this was my cheat night so I had high hopes. After about 30 minutes the pizza comes out the server warns us it's hot as he puts it down using tongs so he doesn't get burned.  The first thing we noticed was how small the pizza was. The pan was deep but the pizza only came half the way up. If you took it and put it in a box it would look like a regular sized pizza. Deep dish pizza is supposed to be think and sloppy where you need a knife and fork. This was not (and not worth $25!). Next thing we noticed was the lack of cheese. There was some cheese in between the other things on the pizza but there was no layer of cheese as you would expect.  After taking a bite the next noticeable thing was that it was luke warm at best. I had the manager come over and when I picked the pan up with my bare hands he got the picture. We had waited so long, we didn't feel like sending it back so ate it as it was. Pretty lame for a $25 pizza. I took a picture but can't post it here. The only reason why they didn't get 1 star is because the manager didn't charge for the first drink and took 50% off the pizza. I go there frequently for lunch and get the roasted salmon which is outstanding. I was amazed and how poorly they did on this night."
Mimi N.,"Pompano Beach, FL",80,27,19,2.0,8/12/2015,Every time I come here I am reminded why I don't come more often. Service sucks. Servers disappear. Food takes forever. Having a quick lunch is impossible because service is so slow.  The only reason there are 2 stars instead of 1 is that the food is actually good.
Tonia C.,"Pompano Beach, FL",39,90,84,5.0,8/24/2015,This place has a great open bar area. The menu has a ton of vegetarian options. I was happily pleased. If you do not drink beer there are plenty of other options. I personally enjoyed the wild berry mojito!
Nicole S.,"Palm Harbor, FL",5,47,72,2.0,5/3/2015,"Eh, it's your standard chain brewery. I've been to the location in Clearwater and the location in Lake Buena Vista, in addition to the one here in Coral Springs and in every single establishment I have been less then impressed (Clearwater is probably the best out of all three I have gone to). The food is ok - they have a large variety - and I hear the beer is good. Oh, and they do have Gluten Free Pizza, which is actually pretty good. I have been to the Coral Springs location twice and the first time they charged my credit card twice for the bill and the second time, which was today the service was SO slow (food took over an hour to arrive and we ordered a salad and a burger) I was ready to get up and walk out. I could understand if they were busy, but there really wasn't that many people there.  The server we got today was apologetic about the food taking so long, so I would say that the staff is nice.  Conclusion: Overall, it is standard food that is slightly overpriced. I have given BJs it's chances, but I do not think I will not be returning for a sit down meal at any of their locations. I would however get the Gluten Free Pizza to go. Sorry, BJs!"
Eveline R.,"Pompano Beach, FL",153,10,185,5.0,10/7/2014,"I'm amazed with the bad reviews.  I'm a big fan of Bjs,  since I went to my first time on the one in Irvine, California 8 years ago. I was dying to have one close to me, 4 years ago, found one in Orlando and last year they open one 5 minutos form my house. I always had a good experience here, food is always great e good portions.  The open area os my favorite.  I guess when is a bad reviews is always the haters that like to follow... I like it : ) SORRY my English, is not my first language"
Robert C.,"Margate, FL",174,164,39,4.0,8/16/2015,Having lunch.  Not too crowded.  It's about noon.  We are sitting at the bar.  Nice music playing.  Football on the TV's.  We had the fried calamari & the fried artichoke hearts.  Both are very good.  We are waiting on a pizza for my girlfriend & the BBQ pork sandwich for me.  Our bartender is good & attentive.  They have a large great menu full of good food choices.  It's worth a trip if you haven't been here.   We have been to the one in Pembroke also & they are as good as each other.
Sergio A.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",27,44,45,5.0,6/18/2015,Great service and food. I sat at the bar and the bartender was very personable and prossional. The food that I was recommended was delicious and cooked to perfection. They're quick at getting you your food during lunch time which is great if you need to get back to work in a hurry.
Rebecca L.,"Parkland, FL",1,6,,1.0,6/16/2015,"I used to love eating here and while I do love their pizookies, the service is always bad when I come here. There is only one server that gives me and my boyfriend good service when we go. I understand that people have bad nights and things can get busy, but it happens too frequently even when it's not that busy.  I decided to try them again after receiving a coupon by e-mail. The service was horrendous. It took forever for the server to take our drink order and it took forever to the drinks. I spent more than half of my meal without a drink. What if someone had chocked on their pasta?  My fettuccini aldredo with chicken and broccoli was okay. It was a bit dry and I only got one piece of broccoli. The server hardly checked on us and didn't even walk our way. When I was done eating, I had about half my pasta left and the server placed my napkin on top of the dish without asking me if I wanted a box or if I was done. She begins to place everyone's plates on top of mine and walk away. I didn't want to take the food because it wasn't good the first time so I wouldn't eat it as leftovers. But what if I did want to take it home? That's so rude and a simple thing a server should know to ask. I don't think I'll be back anytime soon. This place has really gone downhill."
John R.,"Jacksonville, FL",1,39,1,2.0,6/19/2016,"Had some snacks today. 2 ""Oasis"" drafts, decent beer, probably 3 of 5, bit sweet, but drinkable for a 4.7 Irish red. Wings, forget it ...I ordered ""traditional "" got gooey, saucy, and I think they squirted white dressing on it, I think it was ranch, but not traditional. ....bad, bad, wife's asia salad was very good. Waitress was super, around just enough."
D C.,"Parkland, FL",0,43,11,1.0,5/2/2016,Another bad experience.. We wanted to catch the end of the heat game and figured how bad can it be. Well they didn't surprise us .. It wasn't busy at all but our waiter was overwhelmed.. With too many tables. His quote. This place is a corporate business .. Lol. They were out of my first two choices of tap beer.. Then my friend was drinking Tito they ran out .. Do I have to continue? Ok the bill comes and still had beers not available on bill had to ask for them to be removed...no management around.. It's obvious why big bear brew kicks their butt!!
M P.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,8,3,2.0,5/1/2016,"Waitstaff knows nothing about beer , food is sub-par at best. Asked if they had a porter and the response was , ""whats that"" ?  One and done , never again."
Andrew S.,"Miami, FL",0,130,32,1.0,7/28/2016,Good: 1: Friendly host. 2: Near empty @ 4PM on a Wednesday. 3: High ceilings. 4: Soft music. 5: Cool decor. 6: Good specials. 7: Excellent drinks. Bad: 1: Undercooked (fried) fish & chips made me very sick. Up all night and nauseous all day today. 2: Slow service.
Erin D.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",3,39,45,1.0,11/17/2016,"I hate to do this, but I feel that I must deliver this public service announcement. I've given this place way too many chances. Partly, because there are so many items on the menu, so, I figured that not EVERYTHING could be mediocre. Ugh. I was wrong. The food is either too salty, too bland, or just plain blah. And EVERY single time, lukewarm. To add insult to injury, this restaurant must host the master class on bad & underwhelming service. Seriously awful. Especially when the restaurant was slow as molasses... And BJ's, what gives with the high chairs?? I swear I think they're using doll furniture. If your child is over one and is of normal weight and height, he/she will never fit in their doll high chairs. So, prepare to wrestle with a toddler while trying to simultaneously eat your blah, tepid meal. To anyone who truly enjoys the food here, either you are extremely lucky, or you honestly wouldn't know good food or service if it hit you in the face. I will not be back and I suggest you save your hard earned $$$, too."
Cherine A.,"Coconut Creek, FL",734,675,663,2.0,3/16/2014,"Originally I was very excited to see this place open in Coral Springs. It's easy to get stuck in a rut with the dining options around (Big Bear is still my favorite, but variety is nice too). Having eaten at the BJ's in Pembroke Pines twice, and enjoying my experiences there, I keep finding myself disappointed during my trips to this location. First of all, the service has never been very good. On our latest visit, I could've sworn our waitress actually avoided us. My mom asked for a split of champagne (and requested for it to be really cold), and it was delivered warm. As in, had never been refrigerated at any point. The waitress brought the bottle and a beer glass (?!) and walked away. Didn't open the bottle and pour it, just left. I guess it was better that she did that, considering the champagne was WARM. Attempts to flag her down and request a cold bottle were futile, so I chugged my water until the glass only had ice, and put her bottle in my glass so it could get colder. Eventually our waitress came by and saw what we had done, and said nothing. Didn't offer to put the bottle in ice for us (we still hadn't opened it), just pretended it was completely normal. Every time I've visited here, I've tried something different, but I have yet to come across a dish I've actually really enjoyed. The parmesan crusted chicken was bland, and the white cheddar mashed potatoes that accompanied it had not an ounce of cheddar anywhere near them. On my latest visit, I tried the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos. They were decent... best thing I've had here so far... but that's not exactly high praise either. They were just fine. The only thing I've eaten here that I've actually enjoyed is the mini chocolate chip pizookie... I mean, who could complain about a warm, freshly-baked cookie? But that hardly makes a meal. After each visit here, I've left wishing we'd gone to Big Bear instead. I'm sure I'll end up back here... and maybe this next time I'll find something I really like and have good service. Fourth time's a charm?"
Diana E.,"Pompano Beach, FL",651,268,275,5.0,5/20/2015,"My husband and I love this place. It's our go to when we can't decide what we want to eat. GREAT menu, from burgers to pasta to salads.  It's very consistent to us.  Always great food and great service, we like to sit at the bar. Love the pazooki dessert.  White macadamia is my fave."
David C.,"Hollywood, FL",12,5,,2.0,6/1/2016,"The beer is good, but the burgers have much to be desired.  I've been to this location twice, and both times my burger was overcooked.  In my opinion there are better places to go if you want a beer and a burger."
Romm D.,"Wellington, FL",0,7,16,3.0,8/3/2015,"Nice restaurant. No relation to the wholesale store. We ordered stuffed mushroom and scriracha brussel sprouts for appetizers w/c was pretty good. I ordered the loaded burger which I thought was good. My son ordered the lemon thyme chicken which he said could have been better and same went for the Jambalaya w/c my other son ordered. Overall, I can say the place is good for group gatherings over drinks, burgers and appetizers ."
Dan I.,"Coral Springs, FL",426,410,1965,4.0,2/23/2014,"Way better! Went here on 02/22/14 at about 1230p. Ordered beer, wine, potato skins extra cheese, small BJ's deep dish pizza extra cheese, grilled chicken club, and a bacon cheese burger with extra cheese. Yes we love cheese. Lol. As my father in law would say, now we are cooking with gas folks. Excellent! This was the first time we have been here that everything was perfect. The service, the Apps, the drinks, and main course were spot on. I knew when I first ordered the deep dish pizza here months ago this couldn't be the best they had to offer and I was right. The deep dish pizza I had today was fantastic. Tons of toppings, good crust and great taste, see my pic. The potato skins were perfect too. Freshly cut potatoes fried perfectly, see my pic.   Everything was clicking and I was very happy to see it. As a resident of Coral Springs who eats a lot I want you to succeed. The restaurant is beautiful and the beer is awesome the only issue was the damn kitchen producing inconsistent food and the timing of the service was way off. NOT TODAY! Great job by the staff, our server Brian, and the kitchen. I knew you could get your $hit together. I thanked your manager Chris too and I hope he relayed my appreciation of a job well done. Just don't F it up!  Remember to tell them Dan sent you and Stay Hungry!"
