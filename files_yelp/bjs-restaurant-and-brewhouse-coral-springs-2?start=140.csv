Dawn R.,"Cape Coral, FL",0,6,,1.0,7/13/2016,"Horrible food!! Order took forever to come out then the food was cold. Ahi Tuna was not even rare. When I said my meal should of been comped he asked me to order something else. The Santa Fee Salad is what I got , dressing ? This place sucks. The manager was so busy handling other complaints I had to wait to ask for the meal to be comped. He refused. What a waist of $40.00"
Nick S.,"Pompano Beach, FL",54,121,18,3.0,8/26/2015,"i used to be a regular and liked it a lot - but they have removed some menu items (like the corn fritters)and the beer is overpriced. Last couple times I was there the service was absolutely horrible,  and it never makes for a good experience. I don;t think I will be back again just  because of the abysmal service we have had - and how it can really ruin a night out that you are paying good money for.  I still give it 3 starts because some of the food is good."
Sam C.,"Pompano Beach, FL",453,17,11,3.0,4/21/2015,"Lot of hype...doesn't live up to it. A nice variety in menu, but it seems as if the food is just thrown together. We ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken and the portions were very small. In addition, I had the Jambalaya. Word of caution. Salt is used as a spice here, not an ingredient. Service was sub-par and a bit slow, this place seems understaffed. HOWEVER, the Sante Fe Spring rolls were AMAZING!!! And yes, the Pizookie is worth it, buy into the hype!"
Dwayne P.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,38,52,4.0,10/7/2015,"Ashley is the best! Even when she's not there, you wish she was because she leaves an impression on you. Now the food unfortunately was okay this particular day. Salmon was overlooked and veggies weren't fresh:( However I've had several good experiences, so for now it's still 4.5 stars"
Richard M.,"Miami, FL",6,7,,1.0,4/3/2015,"Went to BJ Coral Springs for lunch today, Friday April 2, 2015 around 12:00. Service was extremely slow. Restaurant  at 50% occupancy, maybe less. Wife's meal was served and the adjoining tables meals was served at same time. My meal didn't show up for another 10 minutes, about the time the adjoining table was finishing their meal. Asked to speak to manager to receptionist and two other waiters, we never saw our server until after the manager showed up. Found out from manager that only the receptionist told her that we needed to talk to her.  Time it took for manager to show up was way too long! Bottom line I feel that the sever left our food in kitchen until the food was cold. We feel that soup should be hot and chicken should not be warm. If food waits for long periods of time then what good is it to have a good cook if the food can't get delivered in a prompt fashion. The manager zero balanced our check but I never got a lunch that I could eat. If you read reviews at this restaurant I suggest you look at reviews dated 2015 as reviews dated 2014 only talk about the past."
Stephanie S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",12,96,39,4.0,5/9/2016,So I've actually been back a couple times since the last review. They've moved up to 3.5 stars. The service and food have been consistently good and the pizookies are great. It's really convenient that they're open late during the week. Oh and I love their in house root beer. I'll definitely be back.
Conner J.,"Pompano Beach, FL",108,46,6,4.0,4/3/2016,This place brews a few beers of their own and they are very tasty. The food here is just average in my opinion. The prices aren't too bad. Place is usually very busy but you get good service for the most part.
Far I.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",13,74,137,4.0,5/2/2014,"Second time trying here, and both times they delivered, in fact exceeded my expectations for what I normally expect from a restaurant chain.  We sat in the outdoor seating area.  Perfect weather with a gently breeze on a lazy Sunday afternoon.  Not many people were outside on the patio so it was pretty comfortable.   I can't remember the name of the drink I had (non alcoholic), but it was refreshing.  I had the Mediterranean Chicken Tacos, which was the perfect portion size for me.  It also came with a quinoa salad.  Both tasty.   I sampled some of my sibling's Parmesan Crusted Chicken....that was totally delicious and flavorful.  Next time I believe I will order that.   Wait time was normal, and our waitress was pleasant and helpful.   We will definitely be going back again."
Bill H.,"Naples, FL",37,409,35,4.0,6/25/2014,I decided to check this place out for lunch.  A large menu selection along with a great beer selection and homemade brews! Great service and good food.  I'll be back.
Rai S.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,10,2,2.0,12/12/2016,The service is extremely slow here. Getting a server took 15 minutes and it wasn't busy at all. The drinks took 10 minutes to get to the table. When the server came back we told him our entire order from appetizers to the entrees. Appetizer took another 20 minutes to come out. Add another 5 minutes for silverware and napkins.  When our entrees came out we had to ask they remove our plates from the appetizers and had to ask twice for one refill. There is nothing worse than having to repeatedly ask for something. The food was okay but it was nothing amazing. It was very generic and cookie cutter. I won't be rushing to this place anytime soon.
Joyce P.,"Pompano Beach, FL",2,16,25,4.0,4/23/2014,"I've been here 3 times in the last 2 months. I must say the food & service is great.  a must try is the classic & strawberry mojitos   Also I an NOT a mushroom eater, my cousin made me try 1 of the mushroom appetizer & I must say I loved it. I probably will only eat mushroom there. Also reccomend the Shrimp Thai wraps & Margherita pizza. Try to catch the Happy hour special  Mon - Thu 3-7  1/2 off all appetizer & some food."
Derrick H.,"Pompano Beach, FL",2,18,3,4.0,4/28/2016,"The pizza is very good, love the micro-brews. Lots of TVs but it doesn't feel like a sports bar. Outdoor seating with the fire places, on a cool night it's great. Service is always pretty good. Menu is huge with lots of options ranging from light choices to big deep dish pizza. It has a feel, on the upper end of casual but it's very affordable. Something for everybody!"
Scott S.,"Orlando, FL",66,194,26,2.0,2/26/2014,"For some reason I really really want to like BJ's. I just can't do it. I have given them 4 tries and after my most recent visit I would not come back unless it was for dessert.  The food is mediocre.  Neither myself or anyone I have gone with has said the food was better then average.  The only real reason to go is the pizookie which is pretty good. My most recent trip was probably my worst experience yet at BJ's.  I ordered from the 2 for $19.99 menu which included soup, salad, pizza, and a pizookie.  We got soup and a salad that were okay.  We also got a pizza plus a flat bread that was not part of the 2 for $19.99 but we wanted to try it anyway.  The pizza came with onions on it when it did not have onions listed on the menu.  I dislike onions.  When we told the waitress this she said its a good thing you ordered a 2nd pizza. The 2nd pizza was delayed.  Before it came out the waitress told us our pizookie was ready and asked if we wanted it now.  We said no since we had not gotten the rest of our dinner yet.  She said okay then came back 10 minutes later with the pizookie and said out pizza got delayed again and she did not want the pizookie to get cold.  The pizookie itself was pretty well done.  We finished it then got our 2nd pizza. At no point were we ever offered refills on our drinks.  When we got our check they forgot to give us the special price.  This just added another annoyance to the meal. I am done giving this place chances.  As a few other people have said, go to Big Bear which is right down the street instead."
Gino M.,"West Palm Beach, FL",1,29,24,4.0,5/8/2016,"Great menu options, the appetizers were a bit small. We had a party of 10 for Mothers Day and even though it was very crowded  we seated quickly. The food was very good. The waitress did a great job. The prices are reasonable."
Doug Z.,"Boca Raton, FL",14,12,6,1.0,4/22/2016,Omg! NO service whatsoever! Had to wait to be seated in a half empty restaurant and then we left without ever having eaten!  Terrible experience and never going back. Telling everyone we know!!!! Zero stars. We won't be back. Too many other/better choices for us to spend our money. Try staffing your restaurant properly- maybe you won't lose business this way.
Ricardo M.,"Midtown West, Manhattan, NY",4,25,35,3.0,7/5/2015,"Great location, friendly staff, we ordered a pizookies, and they are so good!!! Nice environment, they are cheap and I ran cheap on the liquor though....don't know why....but still a good place to get some ok food,"
Michele M.,"Pompano Beach, FL",49,33,15,3.0,4/21/2015,"Meh. My friend and I each ordered mini deep dish pizzas and both of them came out soggy. We ended up eating them with forks & knives because they were so mushy on the bottom. What a disappointment.  I've ordered the same BBQ chicken pizza there before, but in a larger size which was served in the pan, rather than a plate. Perhaps side really DOES matter here? Lol Service was excellent though and OMG the croutons in their Caesar Salad are the bomb."
Keith B.,"Pompano Beach, FL",138,444,2,1.0,10/14/2013,"Bad.  Just bad. Crowded on Saturday night as are most chains in Coral Springs.   I ate in one in Texas not too long back and it was pretty good.  So decided to take the wife and try it out. We got a table quickly by the bar (kinda lucky on this).    I sampled a few of their beers, starting with an IPA (my favorite type of beer) and it was really average at best.  I had to go 4 samples of different kinds of beer just to find something drinkable.       We ordered lettuce wraps and they were decent.   I had a salad and it was decent.   We ordered two min pizzas and they were just plain horrible.   They were thick (why, oh why were you thick???).    No need..make them flat bread style.   And they just didn't taste great.    Only thing going was all this stuff was 1/2 off due to happy hour during football games. Then, heading to the bathrooms I almost slipped 5x (and was wearing rubber soles).  My wife commented on the same thing.    It's just a lawsuit waiting to happen.     The floors in the restaurant as well as the floors near the bathrooms are super slippery. No need to go back...heading over to Big Bear which is EXCELLENT."
Anton E.,"Pompano Beach, FL",1,21,89,3.0,1/4/2015,Food is ok. But just don't get injury while walking on their slippery floor. Slip and fall very easy. Lol
Nayda R.,"Coral Springs, FL",160,29,61,4.0,4/5/2016,Food it's ok. Try the jambalaya dish and you must have the pizookie cookie.. American food!
