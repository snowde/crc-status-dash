Tracey C.,"Pompano Beach, FL",74,102,246,3.0,2/25/2016,I don't like the food here one time I came her with my daughter and we ordered a bunch of appetizers to try the different things on the menu. Nothing really good. I came one other time with my husband and again didn't like what I had. Haven't been back since. The prices are normal. They do have a happy got at the bar area don't know how good it is.  I do love the bar area its very nice looking rich looking.
Mitch B.,"Tamarac, FL",55,44,10,3.0,4/8/2015,"They have a nice layout/atmosphere and a attentive staff but i think the food is average. They have the typical franchise menu and food is mediocre . I had the ribs that were nothing special. The beer on the other hand makes up for the food, if you're in to that.  They brew some pretty decent beers that are pretty good. I have had the Oasis, Nutty Blonde and Tatonka that were all good. I believe that they have a decent happy hour (ends at 3) as well."
Brian R.,"Boca Raton, FL",898,1221,4079,3.0,12/3/2014,"Three star food. Four star service. Look is Cheesecake Factory Lite but the food is just a notch over Chili's and Applebee's. The bar is pretty but stocks a lot of McLiquor for what management must envision are the consumerist sheeple who don't care about the food. Almost as much as the kitchen doesn't. Pictures in menus are Always a liability at chain eateries, as the kitchen can seldom produce what the chefs and photographers have cooked up.  If you like ambience more than eating, then this is your place. If you like great, not Golden Arches in a pseudo brew pub, move on down the road. This place is all concept, and very little substance."
Esty F.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",849,70,3,2.0,9/9/2014,"My 3rd time at BJ's was NOT a charm. First time - opening jitters so ok, understandable 2nd time - very awkward seating for a group, slow service and mediocre food. 3rd time - once again just not comfortable, so loud, servers rushing by you, friendly servers but they disappear.  I have tried a few things here - the ""gumbo"" was bad, some of the appetizers are pretty good. Best to stick with an appetizer or a burger IMHO - the ""main dishes"" leave a lot to be desired.  Maybe just not ""my"" kind of place,  the decor is very impressive but the acoustics are horrible. Still I guess a lot of people ""love"" it cause the line is always big and always a wait. Not sure I would go back"
Marcus E.,"Pompano Beach, FL",30,13,4,5.0,4/3/2015,"I've been here about a handful of times. Mostly for their happy hour... Which I must say is probably one of the best in the area... great food selections (1/2 off ) apps, mini pizzas and flatbreads.  I usually get the mini meat lovers pizza which is about 8iches but it is a deep dish...holy moly is it delicious and filling. I finish everything I eat but I couldn't finish this... So that's a good thing cause now I have late night dinner or lunch for tomorrow haha.  Any who food is great! service is prompt! and the drink specials are awesome .. 2 dollar domestic bottles (thumbs up)"
Marcos M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1,15,,1.0,10/3/2016,"We've been to this location several times. The food is usually very tasty but value is lacking compared to other similar restaurants. The Mediterranean chicken pita wrap is very small and has a minimal amount of chicken. The salads are decent size but are also light on protein. The flat breads are very tasty and a good choice. The restaurant is kept very cool and was unusually cold on the last visit. This is Florida where the temperature is over 90 outside and people are wearing shorts and T shirts. The temperature inside was probably 65-68 degrees. I observed people going to their cars for sweaters and jackets. I asked the server 2 times to adjust the temperature.  Last, but certainly not least, I went to the restroom upon arrival. The toilet in one stall was full and I attempted to flush it but it would not flush. I went to the other stall and there was no toilet paper with 2 empty rolls. I immediately went to the front desk and advised the hostess who said she would take care of it. Service was very slow at the restaurant. Just before leaving, 1-1/2 hours later, I went to the restroom again. The toilet was still stuffed and would not flush in one stall and still 2 empty rolls and no toilet paper in the other stall. People used paper toilet seat covers for toilet paper and left soiled ones on the floor. I immediately asked to speak to the manager on duty who said the restrooms should have been checked every 15 minutes. Not sure if employees use the same restroom but it is apparent no one had serviced the restroom in a very long time given that there were 2 empty toilet paper rolls. It is unacceptable that this was not addressed when first brought to the attention of the hostess 1-1/2 hours earlier."
Stephen F.,"Apopka, FL",116,647,692,2.0,8/6/2014,"I knew going in that the reviews for this place weren't great but after being in business for a while I was hoping the kinks were worked out, unfortunately I think they still have a ways to go. That being said, I really wanted to like BJ's, I love beer and I love simple food, burgers, wings etc.... This was one of those meals where immediately I knew it was going to go south. My dining partner ordered Absolut & Diet Coke, our waiter asked if Absolut was Vodka, ah yeah... (side note they sell Pepsi products not coke products). I ordered a flight of beer and apparently the word ""flight"" stymied our waiter, he had no idea what I was talking about. You're a brewhouse, it's noted in your name the word ""flight"" is very common in the beer world. Can I please have a sample of four of your beers. We asked our waiter for an appetizer recommendation and he suggested the Avocado Rolls, sounds good we'll have an order. When they arrived they were a mess, falling apart with each bite (side note your silverware setups should include a spoon, some people might not appreciate double dipping in your sweet tamarind sauce). We made it through two and took the other four home for whatever reason. Our drinks came, my flight of beer, which was actually good beer and earned them an extra star, my dining partners Absolut & Diet Pepsi arrived in two glasses, one full of Absolut and the other full of Diet Pepsi.......huh, never in all of my years have I ever seen someone show up with two glasses when we ordered an Absolut & Diet Pepsi, it was all I could muster to ask for a glass so my dining partner could mix their own drink.   By the way this drink combination cost $13.00 and my dining companion spilled half the Absolut mixing their own drink. Our meal order consisted of a BJ's Brewhouse Burger medium well with no mayonnaise and an order of Boneless Wings Medium our waiter actually asked ""so you want your wings cooked medium?"",  huh... yes I'm looking for a mid-week case of Salmonella, no I was looking for medium spice please. Five minutes later he came back to the table to say that they only offered mild & hot spice not a medium. Our meals arrived, my dining partners burger arrived with some kind of a sauce on it, remember they ordered ""no mayonnaise"", if it came with some sort of a sauce our waiter should have known that, same with no medium wing sauce. This was the most medium well cooked burger on the planet, the outside was cooked so well it was caramelized. The boneless wings were so heavily breaded that I honestly have no idea if there was any chicken in it at all, and half of the boneless wings had no sauce on them at all. I know you coat the wings after they are cooked but please make sure they're evenly coated. Again, I really wanted to like this place and possibly everyone involved in my meal was newly hired, but this was brutal. I rarely give 2 star reviews but it was honestly earned."
Jorge E.,"Port St. Lucie, FL",0,2,,1.0,10/1/2015,"Worst service ever. Arrived at 7pm. 3 people in my party of 4 had their meals after having to talk to the manager because we did not even have silverware by 7:30 pm. My plate never arrived with the other. My plate shows up with the manager at 8:30 pm. Needles to say, rejected it, paid my bill, left $0 in tip (first time ever) left the place hungry and will never come back."
Schylone R.,"Pompano Beach, FL",59,17,6,3.0,8/27/2013,"New therefore work in progress. Could put Big Bear Brewery out of business    I will give my ratings from 1 to 10. 10 being best. Location - 9 Atmosphere/Decor - 8.5 Kid Friendly - 8 Flooring - 6 (High gloss finish on wood/tile made it very slippery. Accident waiting to happen) Bar & Brewery options - 9 Bar service - 7.5 (Need to acknowledge the customers existence even if you cannot take their order immediately) Wait staff - 7.5 (Have solid base training. Will improve as they get more comfortable with peek rush) Food - 8 Quality assurance - 4 (long wait for appetizers. time between appetizer and main course: 2 minutes) Overall summary: * Silverware had to be replace TWICE due to improper cleaning/inspection (food still on them).  * Waited close to 20 minutes for main course. Sent steak back due to wrong order. Waited additional 15 minutes for redo so had to ask for it to go. * Management acknowledged delays and therefore comped meal. * Told by phone the wait would be 3 hours for parties of 3 or more. Parties of 1 - 2, about 1 hour. I waited maybe 25 minutes for party of 1. (excellent!)"
Todd W.,"Hollywood, FL",98,320,,4.0,12/29/2015,"Was pleased with the meal and drink selection for this restaurant.  The quality of food was above average and found it to be good.  There is a lot to choose from here but they have a lot of healthy options and even Gluten Free if you should choose.  The beer selection is what makes this place great, as we enjoyed a Magic Hat...something I haven't had in quite a while and it was great.  Overall, was pleased but there is kind of a franchisey feel to this environment so I deducted a star."
Heather S.,"Irvine, CA",0,15,,1.0,9/7/2015,"Wanted to order something to go and though ""no problem, they have a special counter for take out"".  Well no body wanted to take my order and I was directed to the bar, then back again to the take out counter.  It was not a busy night and I guess I'll just assume this place just has bad customer service."
Jeff S.,"Queensbury, NY",0,38,,1.0,3/11/2016,"It is tough to be this bad.  Got table fairly quickly.  Server was friendly.   Food kept getting delayed and delayed.  Took close to 45 minutes to get anything and at that they ""lost"" some of the food. Total mess that no one could explain.  Food that did come was cold and poor."
Raj R.,"Boynton Beach, FL",72,3,,1.0,7/9/2015,"Food is awesome. My Bartender however, didn't know how to pour a proper Guinness. I casually told her about it and she very defensively told me that I was wrong and I didn't know what I was talking about. It seemed like she was having a bad day so I ordered something from a bottle instead."
Jason R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,17,,2.0,8/30/2014,They decided to get rid of the veggie burger. Went back to Big bear instead. Chain restaurants should provide more vegetarian/vegan friendly options other than salads.
zachary l.,"Pompano Beach, FL",1,6,1,1.0,7/12/2015,"I went to this BJs on opening night a few years ago and been back a few times because of the clean nice atmosphere this place has.  But on Friday my 5 friends and I had an awful experience. We waited 30 minutes for drinks to get to the table after ordering We waited 20 minutes for our food to get to the table after ordering When the food arrived it was cold so most of us decided to take it to go. After we ordered drinks another waiter came to ask for our drink orders. We called the manager to complain who said she'd take some items off our bill The waiter never arrived with our bill so we had to flag him down and paid the bill in full since the manager didn't take anything off and we just wanted to go home. In the past BJs has been a decent place to eat but I don't plan on going hack after this horrible experience.  The waiter was in training but there were so many mistakes it was just ridiculous.  If you go, go on a partially full stomach since it will take almost an hour to get your food."
JANIELLE B.,"Los Angeles, CA",232,16,48,5.0,10/3/2015,"Always enjoy myself when I come out to BJ's I mean who doesn't like fresh chilled beer on tap. Food is awesome especially the glazed ribs (full rack) or the fried chicken breast with cheddar mashed potatoes - too good to be true. If you are ever dining for lunch; amount is decent when you look at your plate it's a small portion (that's the right portion we are suppose to eat anyways) but you will get full; both seafood chowder & chicken tortilla soup is awesome you get enough serving. Happy hour is usually after lunch but if you are like me & you always miss it there is late night happy hour. Honestly their happy hour sucks $1 draft beers & $2 off shareable apps ehhh I might as well pay for the reg. price ijs. But that's not going to make my ratings go down. I LOVE my Root Beer no matter what & the best ones are the ones on tap which they have!!! It has a hint of toffee in their with such a tasty aroma aroma, bubbly delight. There desserts are phenomenal my personal favorite is the peanut butter smores pzookie topped with vanilla ice cream served in a warm skillet. Indeed it is sweet but that's why it's a dessert & marshmallowy goodness so good with the melted marshmallows on a bed of a moist chocolate cake the vanilla bean ice cream even it all that sweetness. Or get the strawberry beignet it's warm fluffy pastry sprinkled with confectioners sugar topped with real strawberries & strawberry syrup & of course vanilla bean ice cream. This is a delight as well. Either way you go you won't regret it. I'm a VIP member so whether spending a lot or little points do accumulate & you receive either promotional offers or something for free."
Jorge L.,"Coral Springs, FL",2,17,10,4.0,8/30/2013,"1st time hearing about BJ's (and I mean the restaurant/brewery), when they opened one up by my way. So decided to check it out and I gotta say I'm feeling it.. Mind u they opened  couple weeks ago so there are a couple quirks they gotta iron out, but the food was tasty--- had me a California burger which I would get again..their service was good... The only thing I didn't like was the beer I ordered which was a Field Day IPA (organic) wont be getting get that again,  reminded me of a time when I was a lil kid and accidentally used women's perfume as banaca...yea I know. And the pizoockie was tasty as well"
Josh B.,"Tamarac, FL",44,5,2,2.0,10/23/2014,"Tried BJ's again after a few months since my last visit. Place wasn't too crowded.  We got there at 6:30pm on a Thursday night. Got right in with a party of 5. Took 10-15 minutes before we were greeted by our server. Girl named Tara, I think. Placed our drink order of 2 waters and 3 sodas. Took another 5-10 minutes before another server delivered it. Took another 15 minutes before she came back to take out order after the drinks were delivered. Mind you it's not that busy. There is zero wait at the moment and a couple of open tables near us.we finally ordered at 7:15pm. 3 burgers, a flatbread, and a chicken dinner. Food came at 7:45PM. Food was all good, just the service was terrible, again. I do want to say though, when Tara did come by, she was very courteous. The issue was mainly how long everything took."
Michele D.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",296,2,1,5.0,11/9/2014,BEST HAPPY HOUR AROUND!! Stopped by to check it out Friday night and got there just in time to try the happy hour. Berry Burst Cider was awesome. Danielle behind the bar was so knowledgeable with the entire menu. Waiting for a table at the bar area since it was so packed. I was amazed at how fast I believe his name was Rick came over and cleaned off a table so we could sit and enjoy half off APPS!  Chad our server was one of the best servers I have had at any establishment in quite some time. (I go out to many different places 3 or 4 times a week)  App Combo was HUGE and SO GOOD. mini deep dish pizza was a really great surprise. Watermelon and Feta salad is a MUST TRY!! We will for sure come back soon to see the staff have some drinks and try some more of your amazing food. KEEP IT UP!! THANK YOU!!
Harry S.,"Coral Springs, FL",154,227,65,3.0,6/7/2014,"Was here last week if they fix a few quirks I would give them a higher rating. We got there during happy hour and was told if you want the happy hour prices for appetizers you need to sit in the bar area of find a place outside on the patio because its self seating outside . We chose to sit outside as we walked to the area we were stopped by a group of 3 servers and was told a hostess has to seat us, We went back to the hostess stand and was told its self seating I then told the hostess she needs to walk over to the group of servers who stopped us from entering the patio area and discuss  with them if its open seating or we need to be seated. After a 3 minute debate between them they decided it to have us sit down in the patio area that was complexly empty accept for one table being used !. Just to let you know they food was quite good but them serving the appetizer, salad, and the entree  all within a 2 minute period is down right stupid.  I hope they get their act together because I would like to give them another try at it because we did enjoy the food."
