Michael S.,"Fort Myers, FL",0,31,4,3.0,1/27/2015,"Well walk in not busy but one of the Bartenders yakking with people not two feet from me.  She never even acknowledged me, the other bartender from across the other side of bar came to wait on me. Again later during happy hour mind you one bartender, and she is wrapping silverware and folding napkins (her back at me), while my beer was empty. The food was good, no complaints, beer cold when you got one.  The TV'S at the bar leave something to be desired. You can only see them from up front, on the sides not much of a view of them. (Also why do 4 of you take up bar seats, when tables right next to bar with 4-6 seats available, leaving up party of one to fight, squeeze in to seats at bar? Just a thought!) Over all one of the worst BJ'S for service, in all the dozen, I have visited."
Melissa C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",28,64,24,5.0,6/28/2014,The food and atmosphere is great. I love the fact that they have a huge light menu. The options are anything from mango salads to pita sandwiches. Totally yummy and under 795 cals. They also have a fun cocktail menu if you are out and having fun. The prices are also pretty cheap if you compare to other places.
Tiffany S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,3,,5.0,2/19/2016,"I lovvvvvvveee this restaurant!! Me and my boyfriend have been here 3x in the last month! Service is bomb, food is bomb!!

Walter B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",21,27,6,1.0,2/14/2016,"1st time here. Very busy. But had imediate seating at the bar,elevated table for 2. Got heffenweis, excellent,smoothnes weis beer. The jombolia ordered was not prepared properly, and seemed to have mean prepared in a saute pan, then played and Finally sprinkled with a seasoning powder. The chicken ordered was rubbery and u,sardine. Our server gave us an obligatory, how is everything without giving us the opportunity to respond and pointed out the underdone chicken breast. The chicken was toasty but after seeing the pink my date lost her appetite, and we left unsatisfied, and wanting. Hopefullyneither of us will have any I'll effects from the pinkchicken. My date also ordered a side baked potatoe, and it too was undercooked.  In final, do not think I will ever return, And would not recommend anyone come in.  Inaditiln when expressing our dissatisfaction the manager was argumentative and unwilling to admit that there was a problem....."
Juan S.,"Boca Raton, FL",0,6,7,5.0,1/23/2016,If you want a sure thing then  come to  BJ'S  . I have been here numerous times and have yet to have a bad experience.  Today  I tried  the Spaghetti and meatballs  very good . I will definitely order again . My wife had the Mediterranean  chicken pita tacos with a multi grain salad.  She would definitely recommend. Last but not least we ordered the 5 meat gourmet pizza to take home  for dinner.
Ashley P.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",2,8,11,4.0,12/9/2014,"Not only do they have a great happy hour, but the staff is top notch as well. Sit at a hightop and try some of their amazing in-house brews. Also, I haven't eaten a bad thing on their menu. My favorites are the parmesan crusted chicken and deep dish pizzas. :) Try to ask for Danielle or Diana-great servers!"
Dell J.,"Estero, FL",0,22,16,1.0,8/3/2014,"The building looked promising and we were ready to embrace this brewery restaurant hoping for a new favorite on the east coast.  Sad to say the appearance was all they had going for this place. We ordered deep dish pizza and a Bison burger.  And of course beer to go with. The beer a hefeweizen and their seasonal IPA. First the beers: not good - the weiss was watery and not appealing, the IPA was more of a pale ale and not much better than a Budweiser.  The Bison was way over cooked (asked for rare) and was shaped like a meatball on an oversized bun.  No kidding the bun was 5 inches and the ""meatball"" was 2.5 inches. Not a lettuce leaf just the thick spine.   The pizzas was a mushroom and artichoke. The cheese was virtually missing and the mushroom and artichoke were hardly present. It was all deep dish crust and a cameo appearance of  Messrs. cheese, sauce, mushroom and artichokes. The service was good and the chocolate ice cream was good but nothing else.  Walking out the floor was well - no better way to describe it than greasy.  An accident waiting to happen.  Hard to say if this was on off night for a Saturday but I'm not willing to try it again at my expense."
Dina S.,"Pompano Beach, FL",99,107,198,3.0,8/10/2015,"Awesome Happy hour. 1/2 off apps $2 domestic brews. Nice sitting by the fire.  Comfy, relaxing seats outside."
Lynn S.,"Boca Raton, FL",0,12,,1.0,9/14/2014,"I was so looking forward to having a real Chicago deep dish pizza. Yes, I know this is Coral Springs and not Chicago. The outside of the building is beautiful and the inside is nice as well. However, the music does not need to be blasting. The seats to the booth were all wet we had to ask for them to be dried off. The napkins were placed on the table and those were wet. All of them ! We were a party of 3 so we ordered the large deep dish pizza with pepperoni. Asked for it well done. Someone else ordered the sirloin steak. While waiting for the meal I was looking over the menu and realized they have a large deep dish for $25 and then a build your own for $15 and change. Asked the waiter the difference in the two pepperoni pizzas. Oh, he says, the build your own comes with two toppings. Ok, then why,  didn't you explain this in the beginning? Changed the order to the build your own pepperoni and sausage and saved $10. Ordered a small side Caesar that was ok. The mozzarella ball side salad with the sirloin was just ok. Never saw such tiny mozzarella balls, they were the size of small gum balls. The steak arrived first and it was five minutes until the pizza arrived. The sirloin steak was so overly seasoned and extremely salty. My party had  to scrape the seasoning off the steak just to eat it. The asparagus was dried out.  Then 5 minutes later the pizza arrived. When you order two toppings aren't they usually spread across the whole pizza? Half was pepperoni the other sausage.  Let me say that there was so much butter on the bottom crust that it was soggy. This is not the pizza I expected. Very disappointed.  On a good note, your root beer was good and I don't like root beer. Water was good too. Now I can still feel all that butter just sitting in my stomach. And your floor is so slippery, greasy and sticky I almost fell. I will not be back. Too bad."
Nicholas S.,"Pompano Beach, FL",24,3,,1.0,1/31/2016,"Worse experience, server was excellent, food was far from perfect. My wife's steak was over cooked, mine was undercooked, returned to kitchen, got back and it was acceptable except neither steak had flavor. Spoke to manager didn't even care about our comments. Will go to McDonald's next time at least they will fix and listen to the customers. Will not be going back. Horrible."
Ken D.,"Pompano Beach, FL",3,22,,1.0,8/2/2014,I didn't like this place the 1st time I went.  Only went back because my wife liked it a lot.  One of the only places that I've ever sent my food back at.   Finally after my wife went here 4 times she agrees with me that the food here just isn't up to par. We won't miss you BJ's
Charlie V.,"Sunrise, FL",2,9,3,5.0,5/14/2014,"Clean, not too noisy, good beers, great kids' menu and great prices. They offer different types of fries, comfy seating and open, yet enclosed, outdoor seating. TV's are playing what a warm-blooded American male wants to watch and the service is fast and friendly. Get the triple pizookie to share- you won't be sorry."
John B.,"Coral Springs, FL",25,15,,2.0,5/27/2015,"The first time we went we fell in love with the Chicken Tortilla Soup because it was exactly like the soup from a very popular restaurant we visited in San Antonio TX. (Been looking for that soup for over a decade! And BJ's matched it) We also tried the flatbread pizza. All was delicious. But this time around we went with the Avocado Egg Rolls of which we wrongly assumed they would be similar to AER's from the Cheesecake Factory. NOT. The menu should say ""with Jamaican smoked spices."" Thumbs down on the AER's. The wife couldn't even get past the first bite. We also tried the Honey Glazed Chicken Salad. Poor grade on the salad. It was all iceberg lettuce even though the menu says it includes romaine. It was more like a cheap salad you would get at a cafeteria. Service and atmosphere are nice but menu items aren't up to par."
Sean L.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,13,2,1.0,5/25/2015,Poor Service...Sat and waited 20 mins just to be noticed as 3 other tables are served. Order my meal didn't get fries until my main course was over. Guess the manager wasn't watching my order as he said when he apologized for the delay
Margery G.,"Parkland, FL",1,8,,4.0,8/21/2015,"Friendly staff, comfortable, diverse menu, and memorable desserts...! A great addition to Coral Springs."
Buddha B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,3,,2.0,8/20/2015,"Heard about this place for a while. Went there and was very disappointed. Sat at the bar while waiting for the rest of my party. There was only one bartender behind the bar, that was for the whole restaurant and a full bar. Beer was good.  When others showed up we sat at a table and it took 15 minutes for a server to talk to us and of course the drinks took 10 minutes to get. Ordered a pizza and it was last to come out after everyone else was half way done with their meals. Server said pizza was backed up. Noticed the lights kept going off. Server asked how everything was and I told her not that great and she gave me an attitude. Will not go here again."
Gianna C.,"Margate, FL",66,2,1,2.0,5/17/2015,"I hate staring a restaurant with good food,  maybe even great food but the service is so horrible... It's why I don't go back... A great place to go enjoy some drinks & a meal with friends but during the week.. Every single time I've gone on the weekend my food was served COLD, EVERY TIME!!! They need more help"
Christopher A.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,7,3,5.0,1/13/2015,"This restaurant is amazing. The food is so good, the happy hour is the best in Coral Springs! Dani, Nicole and Kristen are awesome bartenders and always take such good care of us !!!"
Brandon L.,"Sunrise, FL",13,20,8,4.0,3/22/2014,"I do love Yelp, and those who provide feedback. My wife and I tend to lean toward any restaurant with 3 or more stars and would go to the lowers only if we felt ambitious enough to spend money in a place with a bad rap sheet. Despite the average being a bit low, we decided to take a risk and give BJ's a shot. Calling ahead is a requirement, as it seems to always be packed to the brim. The outside was well kept and the inside was huge, nicely decorated and not cluttered with TVs. We are seated towards the back at a bench table, and begin glancing at the all-in-one booze, entree and dessert menu. Our waiter (let's call him B) comes and asks for our drink order, which prompts me to try their beer sampler as I have been growing accustomed to do. I was shocked at the quality of their in-house beer, as in the Tatonka Stout is now one of my favorite beers of all time. The ""small-bites"" section intrigued my wife and I, being full of small, lower cost appetizers. We order the stuffed mushrooms, the best we've had at a restaurant in a long time.  B then returns and takes our entree order, consisting of a rib-eye done rare and chicken pita tacos. An average wait time was accompanied by a second round of other beers in a sampler, all of which were good. The tacos were unique and decent on flavor, not even requiring the Greek yogurt crema it comes with.  Sadly, the rib-eye was not given the same treatment. Asking for rare translated to medium in the kitchen. If it didn't translate well, then we must find some way to translate to them that salt and pepper is all that's needed to do a steak justice. Indeed there is the black and white shakers at the table, but they didn't even attempt to season it. At least the veggies and potatoes were better than average, and thank you for not providing soggy green beans (my pet peeve). A cookies 'n' cream pazookie to take home ended our meal. B did an average job, attentive and knowledgeable but always overlooked the empty plates and beer glasses. This place exceeded our original expectations, especially since we experienced Big Bear Brewing Company in weeks past and believed BJ's couldn't mimic their quality. We were wrong, and will return."
Vanessa B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",70,13,3,4.0,7/11/2016,Have eaten here many times. Everything I've ever eaten here was delicious. The service depends on who you get. It's not consistent though. The atmosphere is nice but can sometimes get a little loud. Still enjoy going there.
