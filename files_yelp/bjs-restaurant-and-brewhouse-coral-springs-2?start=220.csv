JL Q.,"Pompano Beach, FL",36,185,101,4.0,8/25/2013,"We went to the ""soft opening"" and that was rather hit or miss.  But after the grand opening, we visited on a busy Sunday afternoon, in between lunch and the early bird and the place couldn't me more packed! We decided to take the outside seating as there was no waiting for that.  We opted for the hightop tables and loved being able to see over everything that was going on around us.  Our server quicly brought our beer pitcher out and the only comment I'd say that could help would be to use the kind of pitchers that can have ice in the core to keep the beer cool.  Since we were outside, it didn't take long for our beer to get warm. We ordered the Chicago-style deep dish pizza and I thought I was back in the Windy City when we tasted it.  My husband thought it needed sauce because it didn't have any, but I liked it the way it was.  And oh, boy, was it good!  We never left one morsel!"
Meghan S.,"Coral Springs, FL",197,9,3,2.0,11/17/2013,Ok food. Terrible service. Tables are dirty. Not a manager in site. This place needs better people working here who know what hospitality is. Probably won't be back for awhile.
Netalia S.,"Deerfield Beach, FL",16,17,,4.0,11/13/2013,"I was a little hesitant to come here after seeing the poor initial reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised. I've been to other BJs locations before and always loved the food and beer.  My boyfriend and I went with another couple on a Friday night. We called the restaurant, and while they don't take reservations, we were able to call-ahead. We got to the restaurant and it was packed, but since we called ahead, we were seated within 10-15 minutes.  The food came out good and the pumpkin beer I had was excellent. I will admit that the service was kind of slow, but we were having a good time and weren't in any rush to leave. Despite this, the waitress was very friendly and warm. Overall, a good experience."
Ruthie G.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",5,11,1,5.0,7/28/2014,Love this place ! Great Food Great Atmosphere ! Happy hour is the BEST!!!  Must order their pizookie's they are outta this world just side note tell them to undercook the Pizookie if not it'll come back very burnt :)  Love them still!
Ed M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",4,17,2,4.0,1/31/2015,"Went for  1st  time used call ahead  was told 20 minutes  wait  and we were  taken  in 15 minutes, Danny (girl ) -our  waiter  was great  we ordered  deep  dish  pizza  and calamari very good  would  go again"
Terry S.,"Medina, OH",0,22,2,2.0,3/22/2016,"When you walk in your nose is immediately met with an old food restaurant odor.  The cloth napkins stink as well; their laundry service does not clean them efficiently.  The food is mediocre at best.  The kitchen staff repeatedly puts out sub-par food.  Rotting lettuce with bagged salad taste, burnt hamburger and bacon, forgetting sides, sloppy presentation, and so on.  We are here tonight with a BOGO coupon, but I think I'm done here, free meal or not.  The waitress was great!"
Joshua N.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",92,11,,2.0,10/27/2013,"I went on a Friday night around 10pm. We were told by the hostess that outside had open seating and to go ahead and seat ourselves. After sitting outside for 10 minutes we had figured out that we had been forgotten. So we decided to ask to sit inside where we were once told again to go ahead and seat ourselves anywhere in the bar area. This place was not crazy busy either. It would have been nice if the hostess could of stopped her conversation with her friend to seat us.  Our server was friendly and attentive. The building is nice with ambient lighting and high ceilings. They had a very large beer selection and an extensive menu. I was confused at first because the first two pages were all different types of pizza. I was like, "" Is this a pizza place?"" None of the drinks on the menu had prices which I hate and makes me feel cheap to even ask so i don't. So it's kinda like a fun or not so fun surprise at the end. I ordered some fruity beer which was $5 (not bad) the beer was actually pretty good. My partner ordered a long island which was the worst tasting long island i have ever had. It was a glass of sweet and sour mix and didn't even look like a long island. He said he was fine with it but i think he didn't want me to send it back. After finding out it was $11 he wished I would have.  We ordered the jalapeno burger and the Parmesan chicken. My burger was a 4/10. I ordered med/rare it came out medium and it seemed the meat was not seasoned at all. This was the first time I ever put salt on a burger. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good. I've had better at BK. The Parmesan chicken was dry and again under seasoned. 4/10 again not bad, but not good. We ordered chicken won-ton as an appetizer that for some reason came out almost at the end of the meal which the food runner was confused about and apologized for. I thought that they had been forgotten and didn't really want them at this point but we decided to try them as there were only 3. Cool, greasy, and soggy would be my definition of these. Overall I would like to give this place another shot because of the atmosphere. There is a really nice patio with a fireplace in the middle of tables. But the food just plain sucked."
Jessica P.,"Margate, FL",6,6,3,5.0,2/4/2015,"I've been here a bunch of times and the beers are great as well as the food. Pretty nice place and the bathrooms are always clean, which is important. I recommended it if you wanna hang out with friends and want to have good drinks."
Burj S.,"Boca Raton, FL",238,316,1420,2.0,12/17/2013,We tried this place out as some of our friends had been there the past week. We were seated after a 30 minute wait in spite of being told that it would be 15 mins!  The wifey and me both ordered the Rib Eye steak which came with a soup or a salad and we both had the salad which was fair.  After that it took well over 45 mins before our main dish came out.  My 14 oz steak was COLD and served on a tiny plate (I figured it would make my steak look bigger) but the annoying thing was that it was on a heap of fries so every time I tried to cut a piece of my steak I had to stop to rescue one of my fries from falling overboard!  Quite annoying to say the least.  Our waitress was so intense that we actually enjoyed having her as she reminded us of one of our crazy friends!  All in all it was quite an experience ....the patrons next to us were not as forgiving as us and had the manager over complaining about the time it took and the cold meal they had too!  The bill was comparable to the Grand Lux Cafe but unfortunately the food and service was a far cry from it!  I may return if the management stands us a complimentary meal.....but then maybe not!!!!!
M J.,"Pompano Beach, FL",19,6,96,2.0,10/27/2015,"Went here on a weekday and met with a friend for 12:30pm in the afternoon. Lunchtime, but there wasn't a wait and it wasn't overly crowded as one might think during what is otherwise a typical high peak time for lunch.  So it was very disappointing to be rushed through our meal by our server, complete with rude condescending looks and comments like ""Umm excuse me its a restaurant policy to drop the bill off"", when it appeared we were taking longer than she had liked for us to hurry up and ask for the bill.  Very rude!  What if we had wanted dessert? What (gasp) if we just were not ready for the bill because we did not want it yet since we were still eating with plates in front of us?!  Honestly, if we didn't have an appointment to be somewhere, I would have taken the time to report to management,however since I will not be back, figured it's more important to just rate it here and let you know food was delicious but good food can't over compensate for horrible, insulting service.  Especially at a brewery where you expect good times/service to go along with great food.   In looking at the other reviews, it seems there is much to be desired with the wait staff.  Maybe try another location or something since the food was pretty delicious."
Lawrence W.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,11,,2.0,9/24/2013,"Nice atmosphere and happy hour.  The food represented the menu.  Very commercial presentation  of ""food service industry"" quality.    Before finishing dinner we were asked if we wanted desert and immediately handed the bill.   Yes, rude.   However I watched as similar activities were happening at other tables  and it appears to be the company policy to encourage a quick turnover  You will eat here once and say ""it's new to Coral Springs "". Been there done it and won't go back again."
Adam A.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,5,,4.0,4/23/2016,I haven't been to BJ's in a while due to past experiences win poor service and food quality. But I thought a while with a few friends and we couldn't figure out where to go so we decided to go to BJ's. And I cannot describe how amazing our waiter was. He was a welcoming and had that type of ajar personality. The time it took for him to get our drinks was only 3:05 and that's pretty quick. I also think that the menu is fantastic and the food quality was pretty good. I ordered the bacon avocado and tomato sandwich and I think that a little less avocado would make it a little more flavorful. I think that the service is a lot better than what it used to be.
Katelyn T.,"Pompano Beach, FL",68,110,10,1.0,8/22/2013,"Not impressed. This is maybe their first week so from seeing loads of cars parked out front since the opening, I figured we would go check it out. I have to say, the place looks like a step down from cheesecake or maybe looks like it could be part of that chain. Very nice starting with high hopes. Our server stated it was her first day and she was great! Now let me start by saying, there were six of us all coming from helping a friend move and was very hungry by 9 which was the time we got there. We ordered our drinks and appetizers and boy were there SO much to choose from, probably a little too much. Anyways, we got the combo app. and it was... interesting. It came with spring rolls, spinach dip&chips and mozzarella sticks. Food wasn't even fully cooked, the spring rolls were warm and a bit cold in the middle, spinach dip and chips... it literally was like Alfredo sauce and spinach and mozzarella sticks, well that was okay. Dinner came, once again our food wasn't fully cooked. One of my friends dishes were, not going to lie, it was cold in the middle. He proceeded to have them take it back and he didn't want anything after. His girlfriend got a pasta dish, the pasta was over done (hard/dry noodles) We got a manager and he was unpleasant and rude. But he said he'd take care of some of the meals. (50% off each meal) Desert, well the server knew we weren't happy and brought us a ""bazookie?""A cookie made in a pan type thing, well we got it and ONCE again.. not cooked. The cookie's ingredients were not even close to being done on one side. Not impressed at all! Before we left a few of us wasn't feeling too hot. I hope they get their crap together because if not, it will be going under.  Only thing good about this place was their server."
Porscha R.,"Coral Springs, FL",15,3,2,3.0,1/23/2015,"Good for happy hour deals , can't go wrong with half priced appetizers and discounted drinks !"
Matthew C.,"Parkland, FL",1,16,7,5.0,7/28/2015,"I love this place!! I had heard of poor reviews for BJ's but decided to give it a try and was extremely satisfied. I was extremely low on budget and was only able to order bottomless mocktails, an appetizer, and a dessert. The mocktails are so sweet they're toxic, but in a good way like Britney Spears sings in the song of the same name. I found myself feeing like I was in the middle of a happy hour in a bar specialized in giving me happiness through their fruity virgin drinks. I ordered the sriracha Brussels sprouts and was delighted with the size and good taste for such a cheap price. The pizookie desserts are delicious and have the consistency of playdoh(again in a good way) with an amazing taste almost like that of cookie dough. Not to mention the great service and plentiful waiters that were always willing to help. Can't wait to enjoy another night out here with my friends!"
Adrianna U.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",44,68,5,3.0,3/17/2014,"Wasn't bad.  Came here for lunch, and i was surprised how cheap it was. The food was basically very average. I had the pulled pork sandwich and it was by all means nothing special. Just something to fill my tummy. Food reminds me of TGIF, where it's really average. It's what someone should expect from a chain like Bj's and TGIF i guess. On the other hand, that pazookie was amazing! I love the contrast of warm and cold, and how the cookie is almost raw.... mmmm.  I would come back just for dessert, but then again, it's very busy for dinner so i'm not really sure if i would come back. EDIT: I'd also like to point out how i have come here for dinner before. My friends and I made reservations, and then showed up on time. What we WERENT told is that those reservations only reduce your wait time. This can be very upsetting to wait 45 mins when you came very hungry, expecting to be seated right away.  ....So we walked our butts over to Zona Fresca where there is no wait AND a salsa bar :).."
Ana M.,"Pompano Beach, FL",2,14,15,4.0,12/6/2014,"Very clean. First time I ate here and I gotta say the food was delicious, the service was very good and the price is ok for the quality served. Did not have a problem at all. The place was packed and had to wait about 30 mins for our table, I guess is ok for a sat night...I will definitely be going back soon!"
Greg O.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",15,39,2,4.0,3/5/2016,Great place for dinner...quick beer....or to watch a game  i enjoy sitting at the bar drinking their amber ale while eating avocado egg rolls. I like ordering a few appetizers and passing it around.   I haven't had a bad bite yet. They have an awards ptogram to earn free food or money off. Overall i visit once or twice a month and will continue to go as long as their food..beer..and service are consistently excellent.
Juli L.,"Meriden, CT",2,44,8,4.0,4/4/2015,"4 stars for food 5 stars for service. I came in a party of 4 (4/3/15) and our server Melissa was one of the best waitresses I've ever had. She was so knowledgeable, honest, and had a great sense of humor. The manager Oscar is pretty funny himself. Spinach stuffed artichokes were delicious. I got the Parmesan crusted chicken. The crust was great but my chicken felt...spongy? I don't know how else to describe it but I think if it wasn't crusted I wouldn't have liked the chicken. My party enjoyed their deep dish lasagna, bison burger, deep dish pizza, and tomato mozzarella salad."
Jarret S.,"Pompano Beach, FL",12,84,1,3.0,1/4/2015,Not as bad as TGI Friday's but not nearly as good as Cheesecake Factory. Decent service and OK food at reasonable prices. Pizookies sound better than they taste.
