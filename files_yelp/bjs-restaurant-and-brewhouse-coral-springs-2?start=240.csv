Octavio S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",27,26,11,3.0,2/27/2015,"Had the calamari which was as good as any other that I've had. I enjoyed it. Their harvest hefeweizen is by far their best beer. The others are rubbish and lack any boldness or flavor as did the bjs favorite deep dish pizza. The carnita fries with chile verde are my go to here for happy hour. They are always great. All in all it's a nice environment, cheap prices and sub par food."
Stephen C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",182,171,626,2.0,9/27/2014,"Went to this restaurant about 2 months after opening which is a decent amount of time to iron the kinks out.  While I must say my experience with the customer service was great, I can't say for the food.  Hands down the decor and design of the Resturant is very nice. The night we went was a Saturday so it's expected this place would be busy as it was.  Our wait was about 35 minutes which was decent for the amount of people it did help the wait that the staff was walking around serving samples of their pizza which was great and they were not stingy with the samples either.  We were so tempted to order a pizza which I wish I would have but after seeing the menu and having a taste for a steak that was my choice.  I was very disappointed with the quality of the steak mainly because there was  significant amount of fat on the steak and it was not exactly cooked properly.  I would have sent the steak back but at the point I discovered the fat I had ate a little over a quarter of the steak and decided to let it be.  The sides I had were ok nothing to brag on but decent.  My fiancé stated her food was ok and she was not impressed and would not go back.  I am willing to give a place a second try but I have spoken to other people that stated the same the pizza was good but the other food was ok."
Josh D.,"Hollywood, FL",2,65,9,4.0,11/7/2014,Food was good overall. I had the steak... Price was reasonable bit a salad would have made it better.... Server was excellent and kept the drinks full as well... Wifes meal was very good as well. We would come back... Very nice atmoshere.
Beth F.,"Tamarac, FL",35,22,,4.0,6/7/2015,"My daughter and the grandkids and I have gone here for family night a few times, and the food was always good and the service is ok.  My grandson said they had the best mac and cheese he's ever had- high praise because that's his favorite thing to eat out.  I did bring my husband here once to have some different beers, but the ones they were featuring were all lighter ones, like IPA's, and we enjoy heartier ones like ambers, nutbrowns, and stouts, so I don't think the brew part is that great.  I did like the food and I did like the ambience of the place.  Large tables to accommodate our family, so that's also a plus."
Daisy P.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",229,248,547,4.0,8/23/2013,This place wasn't that bad. We did wait a good 30+ minutes to be seated but once at our tables drinks came relatively fast and the food came out at odd times. Chicken-wings gate was interesting.. Since it was the first thing we ordered and the last thing to arrive! Their 'signature' pizzookie was good but not out of this world good... I'll be back maybe on a 'off' night to try more beers and more dishes.
Brian R.,"Pompano Beach, FL",11,42,39,4.0,4/11/2015,"Really enjoyed the atmosphere and food here. Waitstaff very knowledgable and friendly. Great selection of drinks and lots of food choices. Known for their pizza, it's pretty darn good!"
Nikki S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",3,18,2,5.0,2/16/2014,"My husband and I came here on a random friday night date night after passing this place many times.  The wait was a bit long, 20-30 mins, but we waited by the bar and were greeted by two friendly bar tenders that got us started on drinks. My husband tried the beer sampler and even with the busyness of the bar, the bar tender explained the different flavor and background on each beer.  Shortly we were seated and had very friendly service by our waiter. We both ordered the moroccan salmon it was delicious!!! A little bit of a spicy kick, cannot wait to try it again!  In short, we would come back here again! Food was delicious, drinks were generous (i had red wine) and service was friendly and efficient."
Paul C.,"Miami, FL",33,22,34,5.0,11/10/2013,What a beautiful restaurant. It specializes in pizza but serves a host of other types of foods everything from pasta and seafood and even burgers are on the menu. The wife and I had a specialty calzone (mushroom and artichoke) to share which was top notch! For desert we had a cookies and cream pizookie ( they combined pie and cookie) and man was it fresh and delicious. I'm so glad this place opened they are a refreshing change to the boring chain restaurants in our neighborhood in Coral Springs. Check out their strawberry lemonade and their rewards program. Great place great service the prices are reasonable and the food portions are large. Check them out ASAP I know I'll be regular here going forward!
Julian D.,"West Palm Beach, FL",5,2,,4.0,3/16/2016,Stopped by for lunch as I do live in the neighborhood but managed to never make it over.  Server was very nice food was great.  Love it plan on stopping by more often.
Dave B.,"Parkland, FL",0,2,,1.0,11/30/2014,"Cold food, bad service and dirty tables for over an hour. This location is going down fast. At least the manager tried to rectify the situation."
Debbie A.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,6,,2.0,9/8/2016,"My husband & I wanted to get a quick dinner last Saturday night so we went to the CS BJs. Our waitress came right over & took our orders & almost an hour went by before we got our orders. Our waitress kept coming by & checking to see it our food came out & when she didn't see it, she'd run to the kitchen to check. She then got a manager involved & finally our food arrived. He apologized & said he would comp our dessert. I told him that I thought the entire meal should be comped because of the extremely long wait & he said he had to check with another manager. She then came out & told us that they would only buy us dessert. We then got a teeny, tiny $3.95 pizookie as compensation! What a joke! I can't blame the waitress who tried to help, but the kitchen & the management better get their acts together! I would never go back there- definitely not worth a hour wait for shrimp tacos & chicken pitas!"
Sean C.,"Plantation, FL",63,11,4,1.0,8/23/2015,"My wife and I received some wonderful news Wednesday August 19, 2015 and wanted to celebrate and decided to try this restaurant out for the first time. Well needless to say we had a HORRIBLE experience and will never go back to this place ever again! We were greeted within a timely fashion and sat down and ordered drinks right away. Our server was amazing she helped me order one of the specialty craft beers and was very knowledgeable about the beer selection. This was NOT our horrible experience. The service from our waitress was amazing and this review had nothing to do with her directly. This review sorry has to do with the food and the management staff of this establishment! My wife and I ordered calamari and baked mac and cheese for an appetizer. The calamari came out burnt cause the oil in the dryer hadn't been changed in days and when I began to eat it I found myself almost choking on a piece of plastic. The waitress was there at the table when this happened and was completely professional and apologetic about this and asked if we wanted a new order. She quickly went to the kitchen and had them rush a new order for us. While we waited we began to eat the Mac and cheese we ordered which by the way was basically soup, noodles and some store bought bacon bits. The new order of calamari came to the table and surprise surprise it was the same thing.. Burnt and greasy!!! Then our entrees come out.. I had the newest burger on the menu. A brisket, bacon bbq burger which I ordered Medium (as I do with every burger) and low and behold it was a hockey puck!! WELL DONE!!! My wife got the fish and chips and just like the calamari, it was burnt, greasy and the batter on the fish was horrible.. No seasoning no flavor!! The fish inside the batter had a smell that no whitefish of any kind should have. My wife eats fish often enough to know that wasn't 100% safe to eat. We did see the server talk to the manager but not once did he come to our table to try and make corrections or even see how the meal was. The management staff acted as though it was inconvenient to stop by our table. Needless to say, if you haven't guessed it by now we will never go back to this restaurant ever again!!!!"
Ben D.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,13,,2.0,10/10/2013,"So we went for my wife's birthday and looking forward to the latest restaurant in Coral Springs. The positive.......large, open, clean and great attentive service. The beer is excellent. Out of all the brewery restaurants that claim to brew in the style of the masters, they got it pretty close. The not so positive......food. The first warning was the shear amount of items offered along with the themes of food. They offered Pot Roast to Jambalaya. Asian to American bistro. Pizza to Poke. I thought, how can they offer this variety and in mass quantity and still be profitable. My theory was soon confirmed. My wife and her sister had the chicken and pasta, brother-n-law had the Pot Roast and I had a burger with wedge fries. I can sum up the details of every dish by saying everything originates from the term ""Food Product"". It is either from frozen or from a bag. I don't know if that is the truth, but that's what my taste buds tell me. The $225 bill for four makes the failure to meet expedition sting a little bit worst. In fairness, we did drink quite a bit at $5 to $6 a drink."
Corey H.,"Pompano Beach, FL",32,18,2,2.0,3/18/2014,"I only go here for the beer... The only reason I like going here is because they have a large selection of beer. I haven't been back for a while because the service takes so long to get you anything, especially during lunch. As I understand they can be busy, it seems like it takes too long  to get in your order for food or drinks. Although the atmosphere is pretty good, the service is not what I expected. On the better side of things, their mozzarella tomato basil salad is excellent. If you want to go for an expensive beer then def go for it. If you are short on time don't go but pizza is pretty decent..."
Kretta M.,"Boca Raton, FL",71,21,7,4.0,9/1/2013,"I heard a lot of good things about BJs from other cities and I was pretty ecstatic when I heard about one opening down south.  The atmosphere was great, the building is well designed, and the bar is definitely attractive as soon as you walk in. They had a great drink selection, I tried the prickly peach sangria, it was okay a little on the strong side and little bit too much sour mix, I added some sprite and it was good.  The root beer they make there was delicious and creamy. For appetizers we had the Ahi Poke, it's diced ahi tuna with crispy wontons. It was delicious and the tuna was very fresh and I was a big fan of the wonton crisps.  For the entree we had the deep dish chicken bacon ranch pizza and I enjoyed it. It was nice and crispy and full of flavor!  For dessert we had the macadamia nut cookie with vanilla ice cream, I believe it's called the POOZOKIE. It was pretty awesome. Overall I enjoyed my experience and I'll definitely be returning. I would've given it 5 stars the only issue I had was the server wasn't too knowledgable about things on the menu when we asked questions but overall he was nice and the service was pretty good."
LeeAnn D.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,8,,1.0,8/31/2015,"The service alone makes me NEVER EVER want to return!! The food was good, but not good enough to earn this place another star. The food took forever and the waitress would vanish. I mean, why does it take 35 minutes to get a beer?? Seemed she was dragging her feet bc it was happy hour and wanted to keep me there to drink once happy hour was over. I ended up walking out. Never will return again. EVER."
Josh M.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,7,,5.0,10/24/2014,I come here often. The 1st few times I visited the establishment the food was amazing. Since then it has gone downhill. It is now just an average restaurant. The pizookie was amazing!!!! Recommend this place 200% I have never had a bad experience here.
Kay H.,"Pompano Beach, FL",39,168,401,1.0,9/6/2013,"Service is not lacking, it is just missing. Did not receive our drink orders till 1 hour later, and the food did not make it out. They are not prepared for the grand opening weeks with enough staff nor customer service. Customer service would be able to help them out of the weeds if they can find it. We frequent restaurants from high end to  dive bars, and though this may be a new ""trendy"" place ... it will not make it unless the service catches up with the neighboring local established places."
Cindy N.,"Pompano Beach, FL",54,103,342,3.0,8/27/2013,"When you walk into the restaurant, your eyes will dart straight for their bar. They have a huge selections and they will let you try the beers before you order them. I am more of a fruity drinker so i had the Berry Burst Cider. It was exceptionally fruity and did not taste like cider, but it was good to drink. I ordered the calamari (Seafood Lover) and it looked every impressive when it came out, but when I ate it, it needed salt! The calamari was not crispy at all and I ate all of it because I was starving and could not wait (or else I would send it back!) My friend had 2 blondes. The service was confusing. My first server was very nice and knowledgable, but it got confusing when different servers came up to ask if we had ordered. Then my server came back and stated that his shift was over and this was our new server. If he was going to get off in 10 minutes he should of let her take the table early or have the manager come over and ask serve us until our server came. Then a new server came over and explained that she was our server so I was confused. If the service was up to par and the calamari was flavored correctly and crispy, it would have gotten a 5. If you are looking for a good drink, this place is a good idea."
Erin R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,5,6,5.0,2/11/2015,"Beautiful ambiance, great food, decent prices. The service is a little slow but still very well worth the wait. Friendly staff. I'll definitely be back!"
