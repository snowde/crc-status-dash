Andy V.,"Gainesville, FL",34,19,8,4.0,11/30/2013,"I was on the prowl for something to quench my thirst Friday night.  We've been to BJ's a few times.  I have visited BJ's in Daytona Beach, Pembroke Pines, and now Coral Springs.  First and foremost I really enjoy beer and this place has all the usual suspects lined up for the beer lover in all of us.  But look past the usual and you will find BJ's own brew.  Don't pass go, stop right there!  Try a sample of each one from the Blonde to the Tatonka and you will know why this place is just plain great! The best time to go is during Happy Hour.  That's when you can get some good deals. Last night we sat outside at the fire pit.  It was a bit chilly outside but the fire was really nice.  The service was ""ok"".  It wasn't busy outside and there were 3 servers.  Our server was nice but the service was a bit lame.  Took about 15 minutes to get drinks and about 40 minutes for the food to come out after we had decided to order. All in all though, we had a good time.  Every other time we have been at a BJ's, and even in Coral Springs, it has been fantastic.  I just chaulk this last time up to an oops. I highly recommend this place.  Just great."
Melissa F.,"Wilton Manors, FL",2,14,9,1.0,12/11/2015,"I have never been to BJ's I just drive by, my friend the other night raved about their Deep dish pizza so I  decided to order one curb side since Im from Chicago and miss their world famous deep dish pizzas. What I should have done was save the $23 dollars I spent on this garbage. The pizza was not deep dish. It looked like when I called it in they got the frozen pizza out of the fridge, heated it and added some tomatoes on it. It was horrible to say the least. My friend who recommend the place was mortified as she took the 2nd bite out of this crap. I called to complain and you'd think they offer me my money back but no Stephanie the manager did absolutely nothing. The receptionist agreed as I explained how bad this pizza was as if she knew they had given me crap. The manager wanted me to come in the next day so I could give it one more try. No thanks! Pizza ended in the garbage and so did my $23 dollars. Now when I drive by BJ's I cringe. DO NOT ORDER ""DEEP DISH"" CURBSIDE!"
Barbara B.,"Orange Park, FL",83,63,37,3.0,9/6/2014,"Nothing to write home about! Food was okay. Atmosphere is okay. Basically another version of TGI Fridays, but larger and a bit more money."
Danijela M.,"Coral Springs, FL",0,1,,2.0,1/29/2016,"We just had worse meal ever. My husband ordered medium steak he got bloody steak, when we returned it stake was tasteless, taste like grease, no seasoning at all. We called manager and he act stupid saying you should ask for ""seasoned steak"". Not recommended. We are not coming back for sure"
Marlene M.,"Boca Raton, FL",0,5,1,2.0,5/2/2015,"I ate here this evening with 4 other people.    Our waitress seemed to be busy with everything other than our table.  We ordered the flatbread for an appetizer, which was very good.  From there it all went downhill.  My food was very good (cherry glazed salmon) and my husband's  burger and baked potato were fine.  However, two dishes came out cold and the other burger looked like it had been charred in a fire and the baked potato looked like it was leftover from days ago. We sent the potato back and then asked for a manager.  During this entire time we never saw our waitress.  Finally a young man came over ( who we assumed was a manager, being we asked to speak with one) and we explained what was going.  He was very apologetic and said he would take care of everything.  The next round of food that came was not much better. We also learned that the two actual managers  were in the kitchen trying to straighten  things out. Very disappointed."
Danielle P.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,2,,5.0,12/3/2014,Wednesday nights with Nicole & Danielle is my favorite night of the week! Grand Cru is back and I couldn't be happier! Check it out
Linda B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,8,,2.0,12/28/2015,"We waited a very long time! Did not have enough servers , service was slow, and food was just ok! We were disappointed. It was not run professionally!"
Lori P.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,6,,1.0,6/11/2015,This place has become hit or miss at best lately so we decided to try. We were seated right away only to be ignored for 20 min. Not one person acknowledged us. A server went to the table behind us then walked away. I really liked this restaurant when it first opened but if this bad service and cold food continues it will close in 6 months to 1 year......there are plenty of other places on restaurant row!!!!!!
Elizabeth S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",13,17,,1.0,5/14/2015,We waited 40 minutes for a salad and wings. The waiter said there was a problem in the kitchen. I asked for the General Manager  it took him 10 mins. to come to our table. He said he was in the kitchen and that are food was on time. I guess he doesn't understand that he needs to be accountable for the experience. His attitude combined with very bad food will not put this place on my recommend list.
Brittany W.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,7,,5.0,8/1/2015,"Amazing food, good atmosphere. Great beer and quick service. Seating is fast even with a wait. We get the same server every time for the best service! Try the pizooki! It's a hot cookie with ice cream dumped on top and is the best fat kids treat ever!!"
Yousef G.,"Plantation, FL",86,12,14,5.0,12/16/2014,Amazing food great people I really love their beer and root beer also the menu is great it's overwhelming the service is great I recommend anybody going to it huge bar even can sit outside its so nice
Paul S.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,4,,2.0,5/26/2015,"Ordered the artichoke dip and avocado egg-rolls for appetizers. The first was spot on, however the second contained only avocado, no other ingredients. Spoke with the waitress and showed her that they were missing the tomatoes, pine nuts etc that were listed on the menu as ingredients. She offered to replace them I declined and she took them off the tab. Ordered two small deep dish pizzas, buffalo chicken and chicken bacon ranch. Thy looked very impressive but both had under cooked dough in the centers. For drinks we ordered the frozen strawberry margarita and their house IPA. the first tasted like they forgot to put in any alcohol, the IPA was outstanding, very nice flavor very drinkable. Overall the place has an impressive appearance with nice attentive waitstaff and way above average beer selection but falls short on executing the food."
Nicole A.,"Orlando, FL",0,1,,5.0,12/3/2014,"Love this place! Wednesday nights at the bar with Danielle and Nicole are awesome!! Great happy hour specials, great atmosphere can't beat it !!!"
Seth P.,"Weston, FL",8,16,,1.0,5/16/2015,"It was my birthday dinner on 5/13, I invited my parents, my sister and bro-in-law, my nice and nephew and we had my family of 4.  There were 6 adults and 4 kids.  We arrived @6.  It was about a 30 minute drive It was my for everyone coming from different directions.  We were swat immediately, greeted about 5 minutes later.  We ordered soft drinks and kid drinks which came out in sports.  We then ordered out dinner about 6:20.  The restaurant was not crowded at all.  I proceeded to open my cards and gifts. We then realized, wow, it was taking a long time for the food. It was now 6:50.  No food, I flogged the waiter over and he laughed and said ""I don't cook the food, it's not me."". Then 10 minutes later the kid food arrived, 2 of the 4 were prepared incorrectly.  My wife went to the hostess stand and asked for the manager.  The manager told her she was checking on the food.  We are now 7:15 and the adult food comes out but only 3 of the 6 dishes, 2 of them were cold.  We never saw the other 3 dishes.  Still we have never had a manager visit the table. Just a sarcastic server who could no even be bothered to give us coaster or cocktail napkins so the drinks were sweating all over the table, I hate that.  We all looked at each other and decided to get up and leave.  I was so upset.  Everyone had to get their young kids home as it was a school night.  On the way out, I saw the manager and told her our experience was an utter failure.  You told me I was right and after a few seconds of awkward silence we left.  We had to grab a bit near our house way past our kids bedtime.  What a disaster.  We will never visit that restaurant again."
Sheana G.,"Pompano Beach, FL",1,27,3,1.0,8/9/2014,I've ordered a burger here two separate occasions and it was b-a-d both times. I've heard great reviews on their appetizers and their alcohol is nice esp the lighting of the bar..Oh the potato wedges were really good though w the burger the second time I went.
Big Scary D.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,12,1,1.0,6/16/2014,"Decided to finally try this place one night when we were looking for late night eats with very few options. They happen to be open later than most regular restaurants which was a plus or so I thought. The atmosphere was nice and the service was good enough but the food was horrendous. I ordered pasta, if i remember correctly it was fettuccine alfredo. It tasted like one of those frozen dinner meals you get from the grocery for $1.29  I had been hesitant to try this place since the reviews were so bad but it fit my needs that evening and now I know not to frequent this place."
Lisa S.,"Silver Bluff, Miami, FL",197,4,27,5.0,10/6/2013,The service was good. The mini pizza is very small it's just like the kid size.  The manager Andrew provided great service and managed the little hiccups with great attention and service.   He made our visit much more enjoyable.
Wesley H.,"Coral Springs, FL",0,8,,1.0,12/28/2014,"Awful awful service. I found a piece of metal in my kale salad, and when I called waitress over--she didn't get manager. Instead, she complained about how her day was so terrible and lack of workers. Very unprofessional and Will not return"
Ed R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",9,17,,1.0,2/25/2014,"We have eaten here twice. The first time was good. The second was so bad we left without eating or paying. Our order was simple, hamburgers and soup. they were not busy; but our order still took over 30 minutes. We found out why when the food reached the table. It was cold. The manager came over after about another 5 minutes, was upset and took the food away. He told us another 15 minutes because they were cooking new burgers. 15 minutes to cook burgers for unhappy patrons? 30 minutes later,  guess what. The order came to the table cold again. There is no excuse for this. I don't think we will be going back anytime soon. P.S. This was on a Sunday night. They were not that busy."
Nancy S.,"Boynton Beach, FL",0,11,9,3.0,7/12/2015,"We made sure to make a reservation for 7 people at 7pm for Sat night. When we arrived we were told that there was no reservation. At this point i asked if the young man if could accomodate 7 people because the restaurant didnt seem full yet. He said they could but we would have to sit immediately cause he couldnt hold the table for the rest our party to arrive. (It was about 6:45pm and there were just 2 of us at that point) We said that was fine and waited for him to put the tables together. At this point a young lady started trying to speak to us from the hostess stand... we were not sitting close enough to hear her. At this point i got up and moved to the hostess stand and she informed me that that could not hold the table for us. I was not understanding because the young man just told us that he was putting a table together. She stated that because our whole party wasnt present that she couldnt hold a table. I then told her thay we orginally made a reservation that wasnt honored and now she was telling me that we wouldnt get a table even though we were already there. I stated that not only did someone at her restaurant not establish our reservation, that we were told we could have a table that now would be given away if enough people came in before the rest of our party.(It still hadnt reached 7pm yet) She also told me that they wouldnt have been able to take a reservation cause the restaurant had been booked for days! I told her when we made the reservation the kady on the phone told us that they wouldnt be able to hold the reservation past 7:20pm... that there apparently was a 20 min grace period but for people already there we were givin no such curtosy. This young lady who never told me her name but said she was the manager was unwilling to help us. At this point we were watching at least 20 other people come in and be seated that did not have reservations. So we realized her statement earlier wasnt true. I was flabergasted at the rudeness and sheer unwillingness to simply help us eat and spend money in a restaurant she told me she managed. There were business cards of the manager on the hostess stand and i asked this young lady if this was her card and she said no. Like i said there were plenty of tables when we walked in that they were happy to seat other people who again did not have reservations in and make us wait. Thankfully she finally came over and said they would put a table together but wouldnt seat us until half our party was there. I said ok and the other person in my party thanked her. At which point (i kid u not) she stomped her foot like a petullant child and said ""is she going to acknowledge me"" (meaning was i going to acknowledge her). Im guessing my statement of ok wasnt enough. The young man we orginally dealt with seated us as soon as one more person showed up. I was wondering how they would count half being that would have been 3.5 people:)) Anyway, our first 15 minutes in this restaurant dealing with a person that is supposed to manage the staff and deal with customers was extremely dissatisfying. I can only hope that she gets some more training and hopefully deals with her staff with alot more common sense and grace than we encountered."
