Brandon S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",491,163,199,2.0,8/4/2014,Had a terrible experience here with my family. The wait was an hour long..  once we sat our waiter was very nice. All of our food came out cold. Besides the cold food most of it really tasted bad. Nothing looked fresh or looked like it was cooked with any care. Won't be back.
Beth B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",3,23,2,1.0,1/30/2014,"Ugh... Disappointing 1/29/14 dinner. A birthday no less. We had high hopes, but to be fair,  had only reasonable expectations. Both were to be unmet.  We didn't ever turn into ""those diners"", we acted like we always do, like we want to be treated. Gave the benefit of the doubt, were always kind and considerate, even when issue after issue made the evening almost unbearable.What DID we choose to do? Laugh about it. And, thank god for the outlet-write a review. It's like having an extra $100 in your pocket when someone robs you, like they can't take everything from you-I still have my $100! So, here goes my $100 (AKA: my review):  *SERVICE: Very poor. Wait time told ""20min"". After 20 min., told ""oh, I meant 40min., so it's another 20 min."" Great when you have kids in your party. Awesome news.  Then when waiting at the bar AND when dining, apathetic waiter & bar staff. That's worse than bad if you ask me. Like getting served by a GHOST. They aren't even really there. A shell-in the way, unhelpful, space-taking, time-sucking, useless...But a shell standing between me and my sustenance! *FOOD: Ordered a build-my-own-pizza, clearly from the side of menu (& pointing to it!) not continuing any reference to Pan Pizza. The Waiter-giest didn't ask or clarify, nor did I think a need to, but he brought a deep-dish, greasy pizza. I simply and kindly mentioned that I was expecting a regular style crust and that perhaps I should have stressed that, to which his reply was a blank stare. I ate it with a smile. I reminded him of the side of marinara to dip-it-in that I'd asked for. My husband asked the waiter why his baked potato had nothing (let me clarify here, NOTHING) on it? The waiter didn't ask or clarify what may be available when my husband ordered it, just delivered it as plain as a baby's butt without comment. That item did go back to be loaded, but was sent with a smile. No complaints, we dug into the meal.  Overall the food was ala TGIFridays with a little (more) flair. Helpful? I think that's clear enough.  *ATMOSPHERE/EXPERIENCE: Very busy; Sports on big TVs, but not annoying like many places. The timing of our meal - was laughably poor. So bad, any frustration was waited through to where we could either have left OR stick it out and laugh about it (to ourselves of course, and now to you - bahaha!).  Although ordered at the same time, both some of our table's DRINKS and DESERTS were VERY - V.E.R.Y delayed. Perhaps there was an invisible extra person or two at the table that our waiter-geist could only see and he held those up for their slow-digestion? Not one apology or expression that any of the issues piling up as we dined was abnormal. Zero gratitude or uplifting smile from anyone, even thru our very kind, respectful manner towards our waitstaff (living or dead) smiling and being gracious for their hard work and our utter nonjudgmental manner towards them when it came to the worsening dining experience, of which I've only touched on major points here.  *BILL: excessive for what we got - very excessive for what we had to tolerate. Had the evening been as promised (what anyone living in or visiting the US and dining at a chain, self-professed higher-end, restaurant may expect when walking-in), we may not have felt as though was overpriced. Note-we always tip well, even when there is disappointment since we care how hard of a job waitstaff has get that tips are critical to getting by. Maybe it's also so we never walk away feeling like they can refer to us as ""one of those people"", even when we had one of ""those experiences"". I don't need to be haunted by any of waitergeist's friends from beyond, so I'll do my part and tip well to get out alive - and alone.   *WOULD I RECOMMEND IT? No. Not even to myself if it were a free meal and I hadn't eaten in 3 days. I'd rather eat ramen @home."
Barbara L.,"Plantation, FL",0,11,,4.0,5/2/2015,"Met my girlfriend for dinner and felt front desk help were rude. Our waiter, Melissa f was fantastic.  Went with apps and drinks then ate 1/2 sandwich. Stuffed. Good pomegranate margarita and peach sangria for friend. Calamari delicious as well as beet and arugula salad. Would definitely return."
Eddie G.,"Lombard, IL",1,30,20,5.0,4/26/2014,"Took the family here, it was excellent dining experience! Mason was a great server, thanks! May want to call ahead w reservation, it does get busy. Beautiful decor and great outside/inside seating. Food was very good! Service was great! Very friendly. Noisey but well worth it. Beer selection is EPIC!"
Henry S.,"Pompano Beach, FL",56,21,4,3.0,9/13/2014,Wait was extremely long. Got there at 8 didn't get seated till 9:30. Food was good. Waiter was attentive. Overall good experience once we finally got seated.
Veronica R.,"Orlando, FL",99,52,17,2.0,7/29/2014,"I have to say this was one of my worst dining experiences. I came here for lunch one day with my boyfriend and we were quickly seated. The waiter was very nice and took our order. So we waited....and waited....literally 35 minutes and our waitress has walked by us several times and didn't even say anything to us. I am not one to say anything, but noticed the place was not packed at all. I finally told her we been waiting and haven't gotten our food. When our food finally arrived it was cold and mediocre at best. I will never be coming back here."
Joanne T.,"Davie, FL",68,53,2,3.0,7/22/2014,"I came here a couple weeks ago with my family and I used to have a bad review of BJ's because of the food, but they redeem themselves with their deep dish pizza. Service has always been excellent, my only complaint was the cleanliness of the restrooms and the other food on the menu."
Cee D.,"Voorhees Township, NJ",50,13,,5.0,12/25/2014,"I'm really shocked at the bad reviews here. We ate here on Christmas Eve and had a great time and great food. The hostess was really nice and helped us get a table outside even though it was supposedly closed down for a big party. Our waiter Cameron was super nice and made spot-on recommendations for food. We started with a the vegetable and goat cheese flatbread and it came out fresh, piping out, and PHENOMENAL. It was honestly so good we ordered another one for takeout to eat on Christmas day. I got a salad for dinner that was also very good and stole some wedge fries from my husband's burger that were delicious. The best part was definitely the pazookie trio for dessert. We got oreo, chocolate chip, and salted caramel. They were all amazing but the oreo and salted caramel were really special. Being from a northern state we love to eat outside and the outside seating is very comfortable and the ambience is great. I hope they open one in NJ soon!"
Barry K.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,2,,2.0,3/6/2015,"First, the good news about BJs.  Went for an early weekday dinner, and service was excellent because it wasn't crowded.  The beer selection is terrific, and the salads were wonderful & plentiful.  So far so good.  Then came the entrees, and that's the bad news.  One person ordered a burger well done.  Huge mistake.  It was bone dry, devoid of flavor.  Two of us ordered the pepperoni deep dish pizza.  Another huge mistake.  The crust was limp & lifeless, there was hardly any tomato sauce, the cheese was overpowering, and there was so much pepper it was way too spicy.  It was certainly the worst excuse for deep dish pizza we've ever experienced, and maybe the worst pizza (any category) of all-time.  This was our first encounter with BJs, and we're willing to give it another chance, since the menu is big and there are lots of other choices.  So far, though, forget the burgers and forget the deep dish pizza.  Oh, well..."
Marietta R.,"Coral Springs, FL",23,21,41,5.0,7/16/2014,Not sure why this place has a low rating. it is delicious and we have eaten here 3 times. The food is great and the service is great as well. Last time we went we were a group of 5 and each one of us ordered a different item on the menu and they were all delicious. The steaks are cooked as requested. Nothing to complain about here. We took longer to go based off these reviews and decided to try it and I am glad we did. Yelpers got it wrong.
Heather C.,"Coral Springs, FL",0,34,30,4.0,9/6/2014,"BJ's has been my favorite restaurant since I moved to Coral Springs in January. Last night I was so excited to go because the last few new restaurants I tried sucked and BJs has ALWAYS satisfied me. Of course there's always a wait because it's very popular. I put myself on the call ahead list and after 30 minutes we were seated. After 15 minutes from the time we were seated we had not had 1 waiter come over to us and what really infuriated me was people that sat down after us were promptly served as soon as they sat. So I asked Donald, a waiter, if he could find out if we had a server at all. 10 minutes later, nothing. So I asked another server Ciara if she could send the manager. No manager ever came but Ciara said it was Donald's table but he said it wasn't. Thanks Donald. So Ciara said she would take care of us. She was amazing just like all the other servers I've had there previously. Instead of having our night ruined, she made it awesome and gave us free dessert at the end. My complaints here are that A) you have a terrible server working for you which is probably why you have so many bad reviews. B) the manager never came out which I think is highly disrespectful, especially when asked for. A good manager comes out to make sure everything is Ok. You failed. C) the only reason I'm giving you 4 stars is because Ciara was great.  Try a little more if you want people to come back. There are plenty of other restaurants to go to."
Susan P.,"Pompano Beach, FL",19,31,,2.0,7/4/2014,Not one my favorites.  Burgers were okay.  I prefer pizza from an Italian restaurant and dinner menu is limited.  Service was just okay.
Zee H.,"The Villages, FL",1,24,,4.0,6/29/2015,"I would give this place 3.5 stars. The food was really delicious and excellent portions. I got the bison burger and it was great. I also shared a dessert which was very good. The issue with this place is you wait a long time for your food. They seemed to be understaffed, as our waiter- good waiter- but he was literally running and rushing the whole night. I could feel his stress, it was uncomfortable. Also they brought the food out for everyone except for one person in our party for what seemed like forever. Which is just poor restaurant etiquette. Overall I would go back, but with the expectation of waiting."
Shali R.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,7,,2.0,7/24/2015,The quality of the service has definitely declined! The portion sizes are quite small / over priced.
S M.,"Boca Raton, FL",71,29,7,5.0,1/22/2014,We had a BJ's in Arizona and I am so happy to see one close to home.  They have the BEST food and beer.  I love the Southern Fried Chicken and the Blonde Beer.  The desserts are amazing!!  This is a favorite place for all times!
Marie P.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,1,,1.0,10/2/2014,Went there for the first time with friends and our children had hour 1/2 wait the hostess were rude wanted to talk to the manager got a kitchen manager who was so short didn't care what what we had to say threw us out . We ask for his card came out with one of the kitchen guys to try and intimate us joke !!! Have been trying to call corporate leave a message almost a month later no response. Not a way to treat people never tried the food so can't say anything about continue this path you will not be around long
Yadira M.,"Pompano Beach, FL",39,30,26,2.0,10/10/2013,"Twice now I've gone in for lunch , and twice it has sucked ... Starting with the staff . They start off attentive then eventually disappear , not to mention there's a ton of employees on the floor but no ones moving fast enough . The food is nothing great , which sucks because it was actually exciting to finally have a new restaurant in springs .  I ordered the unlimited soup and salad ... Wedge and clam chowder . My wedge salad was drenched in watery ass blue cheese that had like 2 crumbles of blue cheese , my clam chowder came out and it was warm, the consistency of it was thick (almost jello  like ) sooooo, I didn't eat it . Next I decided to order the piranha chili and a tomato and mozzarella salad ,which took for freaking ever ! I'm pretty sure the soups are pre made . pour that shit , scoop my salad and bam ...seems simple but not the case , lol . So the chili looked and tasted great. Only wish it had actually been hot so the cheese that comes on top could've melted when mixed and the big ass scoop of cold sour cream , wouldn't have made it colder than it was ! Tomato and mozzarella no complaints , needless to say , skip the soup and salad !  My friend ordered some stuffed mushrooms and well they were luke warm as also . Nothing comes out nice and hot , why!!??? Overall I'm not impressed and honestly prefer any other restaurant on university drive , especially Big Bear . Aside from the reviews, most people I've spoken to haven't liked it much either and said the service was terrible . I  Wish them luck,it's busy now because they're the new place in springs , they need to shape up , I won't be returning , at least not for a long while !"
Dawn N.,"Tamarac, FL",153,34,3,2.0,12/21/2014,Food was ok. Nothing to rave about. Service was absolutely horrible. Waitress forgot to bring stuff. Needed to ask three times for dressing. The bill was completely wrong. Charged for things we never ordered.
Zachary K.,"Davie, FL",46,57,9,3.0,1/18/2014,This place is nothing but a glorified Chilis (actually happens to be next door to a chilis that is why i say that). I had the pulled pork sandwich: decent sandwich but for $11 not very worth it. My grandmas bacon cheeseburger looked over cooked and not very appetizing. I have eaten at several other BJs locations and I will never return again. For an average meal of $15 a person (without drinks) you can find much better food elsewhere.
Joe S.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,10,,2.0,12/24/2013,"I had been to another location (in Texas) before so I knew what to expect in terms of food. Service is an issue at this place. As I was waiting for my table I noticed two customers complaining about the service.  Not a good sign. After a while, it took a while for our waiter to show up. While we were waiting for our food, we overhead to table next to us complain about their meat being raw. My wife order a cobb salad to come with her meal. Her main dish came and no sign of the salad. She mentioned that to our waiter when he came to check on us (someone else brought the food) and she said she didn't want the salad anymore. He said he would take care of that and offer a free desert. He brought the salad anyway... I ordered the Black And Bleu flatbread appetizer, without onions (my thing... I don't like them). Unfortunately, my request was disregarded and the onions were there. I chose not to complain. It was just going to delay our dining experience. While we were waiting for our desert, we noticed another table in front of us with errors in their check. They waited a good amount of time for the waiter to come and fix it. They were pretty upset. When our own check came, the charge for the desert was there. We had to ask for it to be taken out. During this process, we just saw waiters and waitresses congregating around their service area, just chatting and leaving customers unattended.  Basically, the food is good but the store manager needs to keep a closer eye. The dining experience was just disappointing for us."
