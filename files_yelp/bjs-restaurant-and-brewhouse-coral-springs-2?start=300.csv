Drew M.,"Naples, FL",0,16,,1.0,1/26/2014,"Went here on a Friday Night around 8:30. Long wait which we expected, horrible service which we did not expect as the Doral Location is on point and we have been there several times. This Coral Springs location is miserable, this is the first restaurant since the Cheesecake factory in Atlanta in 2008 that a server knocked over my drink onto my lap and did not even apologize, the waiter (Juan) is the most Douchy waiter that I may have ever experienced, he was calling my Family....""Family""..never..Juan..WTF? anyways you could have had 10 year olds running this place and it would have run smoother and to top off the horrible experience..ready for this?...as we were leaving, our headlights shined towards the alley next to the ""Restaurant"" and we saw one of the Cooks(Judging by his Chef outfit) urinating next to the dumpster..lol..only the best for the Coral Springs Sheople."
Timothy J.,"Coral Springs, FL",10,24,3,3.0,9/16/2013,"New place in Coral Springs. The waiting list can be long. We only waited less than 15 minutes but the catch is we got there around 9:30pm. Full bar and there is seating inside and outside. There are several TVs with all the games on. We got the 8 samples of BJ's Handcrafted signature beers. We tried Light Switch, Harvest Hefeweizen, Hopstorm IPA, Oasis, Blonde, Piranha, Jeremiah Red, and Nutty Brewnette. I liked the Light Switch and Jeremiah Red. Great beers. The lettuce wraps and gluten-free pizza are good. Service was fast."
Greg P.,"Pompano Beach, FL",4,61,7,1.0,4/11/2014,"Update from 4/11/14. We typically preorder our food now because the service is soooo bad here. I called the other day and some girl told me we cannot preorder any more. I explained the situation and she literally told me they don't care. Forget this place, I will never go back for food or beer! These people are idiots and the restaurant doesnt deserve to exist in coral springs when there are so many better places to go to."
Nikole G.,"Pompano Beach, FL",98,32,16,1.0,1/10/2016,"I have never written a negative review as of yet. But this experience definitely calls for one. Mostly because this was the SECOND time our service at BJ's was atrocious. DO NOT GO TO BJ'S WITH A PARTY OF 5 OR MORE! When only 4 of the people in the party were sat we got our drinks in about 6 minutes. The rest of the party arrived and 2 people in the party ordered the SAME drink that had already been served to one of the people already sitting. We timed and they did not get their drink for 13 minutes. And it was wrong. We asked for the right one, they brought it 10 minutes later and they still charged us for the incorrect ones. The second arriving party ordered their food AFTER the first arriving party (almost 15 min later) and they got their food first. No big deal.... Except for that the rest of the food didn't come out for 10 more minutes AND one of the orders never arrived! I had to ask them to take it off the check. The next 2 times we ordered drinks we waited about 10 minutes each time. ALL THIS WITH TWO SERVERS ASSIGNED TO OUR PARTY OF 12. Definitely not worth the sub par food they serve."
Regina D.,"Pompano Beach, FL",9,40,38,5.0,2/6/2014,"This has become one of my favorite sports-bar kind of restaurants. I've gone multiple times and have yet to be disappointed. I had two people I know disagree, they weren't a fan of the food they ordered but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Absolutely ADORE the cookie pan deserts.  red velvet is the best."
Diana D.,"Pompano Beach, FL",45,56,,4.0,4/8/2014,"Got addicted to this place while in school. Thrilled they opened one up in my current town. Been three times since. Food, on-site brewed sodas, and pizookies are my favorite! I am in the frequent diner club and I get great deals. Just went last night with a coupon for free small/snack bite and happened to show up during happy hour so took advantage of half price appetizer and $1 off drinks while watching NCAA finals game in bar area. Never have had a bad experience at either location I've been to!"
Justin A.,"Burlingame, CA",172,130,53,2.0,9/15/2013,"Interesting beers, but the food is mediocre, especially for the price. Basically, it's just greasy bar food with a huge markup. I guess I just expect a little more quality from an upscale brew house."
Ross Z.,"Pompano Beach, FL",1,32,25,1.0,2/29/2016,"My wife and i ate here yesterday with 2 other couples.  4 of us ordered the ribeye steak. This is where it gets good. After tracking down our waitress since she disappeared for 20 min. We asked where our food was. Since it had been 45 min since we had ordered. She apologized to us,  telling us that she had a big baby shower she was also taking care of. Not my problem i thought to myself. She said our food was coming now. Well it came and along with my ribeye i also ordered asparagus and a baked potato. My asparagus was all dried out but I didn't say anything until i cut my steak. My steak was suppose to be medium it was more like rare. I asked for the manager. I explained to her how long we waited and the food still came out wrong. She also gave me the excuse of the server having been over loaded. Well then instead of thinking it i told her thats not my problem thats yours as a manager. She apologized and said she will take care of it. My steak comes back and now they served me the same steak they just threw it back on the grill. It looked like a lump of charcoal. And it was well done now. I called her back over and asked her if she was serious serving this steak to me. I said look at it. You gave me back the same steak and burnt it. She replied your right it is burnt but i disnt want you to wait any longer for your food. So i said i would rather a little longer and have my food correct then like you served me. So i had her just take the steak back and cancel my order. Then she replied like she was doing me a favor she will remove it from my bill. This was a pathetic display of management skills and making sure your customer is happy. I think its pretty pathetic that in a place like that there so called chefs cannot cook a steak correctly. I will never go there again. I just wish i would have taken a picture of the plate of food she delivered to my table. What makes it even worse is she was the manager. I guess its quanity over quality in this place."
Rob M.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,22,,2.0,10/1/2013,"Location is new to Coral Springs but not a new restaurant so they should know the drill.  They better get their service under control and the kitchen on the ball since this town will make or break a restaurant in 6 months.  I give it that they are new but 45 minutes for a soup and salad?  Come on.  The table next to us was going on 1 hour for salads and burgers.  GM response ""we are working the kinks out"".  No kidding.  Take the short ride to Big Bear Brewery.  Always consistent and always great service. BJ's will be gone in a year."
Howard S.,"Pompano Beach, FL",2,33,1,1.0,1/26/2014,I've been here 3 times and it is consistent for very slow service. It doesn't matter what time of day. Ie 330pm. For the prices they charge something is wrong here for slow service. Good luck to you!
Mindy S.,"Delray Beach, FL",42,5,,4.0,3/18/2014,"Love the brushetta,pizza and parmesan crusted chicken. The cheddar mashed potatoes are insane. This is one of my favorite places"
Donna H.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,20,2,2.0,10/12/2013,"We decided to try this new place to celebrate family nite and my oldest son's return from a year-long overseas military assignment. Used their call-ahead program, but still waited an hour. After being seated, another 20 minutes for drinks, and almost an hour for food. Tough to get condiments, or a second drink for that matter.  The food was bland, and definitely not worth the wait. The chicken was grizzly, and the salads unimaginitive. There are too many great places in south Florida, and unlike the sheep of coral springs, I do travel to other areas to find a good dining experience. We will not be back, they gave me no reason to choose this restaurant  again."
John H.,"Coral Springs, FL",47,38,14,1.0,1/22/2014,"I was excited when I heard this place was opening in Coral Springs but after being there three times I can honestly say that they still need to work on their service. The food is not bad (had their California Buger, Marghrita Flatbread so far). Each time I have been there the AC is pumping way too much. It's quite cold so I would suggest outside seating because the waiter does not seem to be able to adjust the temp. Food came out late twice and the last time I was there they forgot my about my order completely. My family ate and I was left taking mine home after the Manager come to apologize and comp the meal (Pizza). Not going back any time soon."
Bill F.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",2,65,39,3.0,8/19/2013,"First day open to public so we were told.   Everyone seems very nice, so I had to give them a little more credit than deserved.  The menu looks really good, but the kitchen needs some help for sure. It's clear they are not organized and don't have it together.  We ordered the ribs and chicken for two to share. The taste was good, but they skimped on the sauce and had to wait a long time just to get plates.  We wound up just keeping our salad plates and used them.  It seems the wait staff is very confused.  One takes the order but then we didn't see her for a while.  Then someone else brings the food.  We asked for veggies with our meal, but they brought cole slaw and potato salad.  When they did finally get the veggies from another waiter who saw we were looking for someone, he finally told us he had to go back and make them himself.  Thus, the reason for hard veggies still hot from a microwave.  They sure do need another decent rest in Coral Springs, so I hope they get it together soon or they will never make it. Unfortunately, we will not be coming back soon."
Keri R.,"Pompano Beach, FL",3,33,6,5.0,3/9/2015,"Jeremiah Red is my favorite beer, brewed by BJ's.  Excellent thin crust AND deep dish pizza.  Of course the Pazookie is outstanding too.  I highly recommend BJ's Brewhouse."
Dan M.,"Pompano Beach, FL",86,1,4,3.0,3/8/2015,"SLOW!!!  Went in for lunch, food bearly made it out before dinner.  I'll have to budget more time to eat there again. Food was pretty good though."
Adam G.,"Coral Springs, FL",1,3,,2.0,9/5/2013,"Disappointing! I've gone two times since it opened. I was excited for this new addition to Coral Springs. Both times have been extremely disappointing. I wanted to be charitable after the first time, thinking it might have been an off night. But the second time was worse than the first. Both food quality and service was substandard.  I've had both dinner and lunch.  For dinner I shared a deep dish pizza with a friend. It came out cold and undercooked. We sent it back. It came back a little warmer...but not much. Got a side salad with the pizza. It was poor quality. For lunch I got the beef tacos. Waited 40 minutes for them to arrive. They tasted fine but were ridiculously small. The overall quality just seemed cheap.  Two bad experiences. There are a lot of other great restaurants in the area for comparable prices. It's cool that they brew their own beer...but it's not enough (and I love beer). Go somewhere else."
L L.,"Pompano Beach, FL",1,26,4,1.0,1/15/2014,"AWFUL service.  SLOW, incompetent, and inaccurate.  Food advertised / pictures does not match food received.  I didn't even bother to try the food - I made an order for take out - asked a SIMPLE question, ""what is baja sauce?"" (for a burger) and was transferred to THREE people in an attempt to answer this basic question.  Hurriedly told the 3rd person not to bother and to just put it on the side.  I should have hung up then, it took over 10 minutes just to PLACE the order via phone! Made 2 orders for burgers with some minor customization (no cheese or mayo, add lettuce, tomato, substitute slaw for fries, etc - these are not crazy requests, just a little healthier than a ""normal"" order)...She read back the order THREE times and I ok'd it. I was told it would be ready curbside in 15-20m. I allowed just over 30, then when I arrived, did as instructed and called the number to tell them I was here and was told they had to ""check status"" and waited over 10 more minutes. Called back and was told it would be right out. Waited another 5.  Not at all surprised to find that the order wasn't even close to correct. Despite 3 repetitions and she and I reading the order back and forth, they managed to put things on that I specifically requested they leave off, and it looked nothing like what was pictured. Is it fair to picture something that looks perfect, vibrant and delicious - and then deliver something that looks like a cheap diner meal? The slaw - the buffalo burger is pictured with ""baja slaw"" (which is what I asked for) looks colorful and healthy with vibrant colors and a ""baja vinaigrette"" - which is what I asked for...the girl had no idea if there was more than one kind of slaw and had no idea what I was talking about. I was given a tiny container of something that closely resembles KFC's limp mayonnaise covered chunk slaw.  Congealed cheese and mystery orange sauce (perhaps the mysterious ""baha"" sauce), both of which I'd asked to skip, topped off this cold burger (probably b/c it sat around waiting for 30m) and some of the requested toppings were missing. Will not go here again, would not recommend.  I don't know if it's the kitchen or the waitstaff, but in ANY case, the staff should be better prepared and knowledgeable about their own menu!!  Come ON!?"
Bryce M.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,14,,5.0,4/29/2014,I am very surprised to see the low rating. I didnt read the reviews to see why. I have been here several times. The home brews are good. The have a very good craft brew selection. The appetizers are very good and the buffalo chicken deep dish pizza is great. I dont know if people were expecting classy but the best way to describe BJs is that it is a relaxed atmosphere with a cheesecake factory sized menu of drinking/bar foods with custom brewed beers and lots of crafts. Many on tap like the always great Weiheistephaner HefeWeisse and others. Anither way to think of it is a classier ale house with better more upscale bar food and better more craft style beer selections. My wife is a fan too as a minor beer drink and mostly wine drinker.
Lacey B.,"Lauderhill, FL",4,13,6,3.0,1/23/2015,"Walking into the restaurant, I really wanted to like this place. I really did. I hadn't seen my best friend in months, and I was excited for something different that could make up for all the hipster restaurants that we have in Miami. We were seated immediately, at a tiny table for two right by the door. We sat, and we looked at each other and we looked next to us at the open tables that were a little bigger and not as undesirable as this one was. I approached the hostess, and she told me that we could move, so we get up, and we're moved to the other side of the restaurant.... to the same sized table, and to the same awkward openness. Our server Greg was friendly, he recommended a couple of things and put up with the weird way we ordered. We tried the corn fritters which were heaven, the carnitas fries, which were kind of boring and could use a nice refreshing sauce, the California club flat bread which was delicious, but lacking in topping and way too crisp to eat without making a mess, the calamari, which was served on a plate about 12 inches long, with the actual calamari taking up only six of those, and the other six occupied by two little containers of sauce and two slices of lemon...... the presentation was lacking to say the least. The dish that was the end all, that really made us never want to come back was the pepperoni pizza dippers. We were so excited to have something really good and when it arrived, to say the least, we were disappointed. It came with sliced bread sticks that were stale and gross, and the flavor of the actual dip, was just not what either of us were hoping for. It wasn't cheesy, it was just rich in cream cheese and had no extra flavor. They might as well have given me a bagel for dipping it had so much cream cheese in it. The former mac and cheese saved it for us, as well as the corn fritters. We ended up having dessert, but we're really disappointed when we saw they only have pizookies  for dessert, which is kind of stupid since there's a big variety of everything else. Anyways, the dessert ended up being okay, definitely recommend the cookies and cream and the salted caramel ones. All I can say is when I come to visit in Coral Springs, I will not return here, and my friend (who lives down the street) will never go back."
