Scott R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",46,6,2,1.0,1/19/2014,"Prefer to give less than one star. Service inconsistent. Servers not always trained well. Rewards program is a joke: none of the items on our bill were eligible? Food not great. Went early at open, beer tasted like it sat in the tap all night. Been a few times, doubt I'll return."
Melanie J.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,4,,1.0,8/26/2015,"So, I first ate at BJ's when I lived in Gainesville. That BJ's is amazing and has excellent service! I loved everything about BJ's. That being said, I was so excited when they started building one in Coral Springs. After they opened, I ate dinner there. The service was terrible and I waited months to go back thinking it was because they were so new they just weren't quite ready yet. I waited and waited and one day decided to go back. Well, the second time was no better. My family member's food was made wrong and the service sucked. That last experience was probably about 3-4 months ago. Today a friend of mine says, ""hey, let's give BJ's one last shot."" Reluctantly, I agree. Third times the charm, right? Wrong! We went for lunch and the place was only about a third of the way full. So you would think there would be good service, right? Wrong again! The service was terrible. I literally saw staff just standing around chatting among themselves as I waited forever for my drink and salad. I ordered chili- it was cold, not even luke warm. My friend ordered pizza, it came out cold. For dessert, we ordered a pizookie trio. Well, turns out they were out of the cookie and cream flavor we ordered, and they decided they would just chose another flavor for us without asking. Turns out, it was a flavor we don't even like. The waiter didn't even care. He just left it. Then to top it off, it was obvious the pizookies had been sitting awhile before they were brought to our table. The ice cream on each one was completely melted and falling over the sides of the pizookie container. Even worse, the pizookies weren't even hot!!! This, after we waited for 30 minutes!  All this to say, I will never go back. The service is always terrible and the food is always cold. None of the staff care and they more than likely need new management since this is not a one time problem."
Jonathan B.,"Coral Springs, FL",1,2,3,1.0,3/30/2014,"This place looked satisfying when I first walked inside. It was very neat. The menu didn't look to bad either. The burger I got was also good. Not the best, but still enjoyable. That was all until I finished the food. I felt sick to my stomach for the rest of the day. It was not just me, but my whole family as well. I do not recommend this place. It might look good and taste good, but the outcome is unbearable."
Danielle C.,"Deerfield Beach, FL",1,41,11,2.0,11/10/2013,"Wanted to try this new place, well that didn't work out.... Arrived at 8:00, the place was packed which is probably a good thing. We I was told the wait was nearly 2 hours, which is absolutely crazy I walked out. I will try again some time but, obviously not waiting 2 hours for any restaurant especially a chain...."
Dave R.,"Pompano Beach, FL",4,111,6,2.0,9/13/2013,Warehouse looking restaurant was freezing! Trying to get them to turn down the temperature was exhausting. Be careful if you sit near the bar because you might get frostbite.  Server was nice but he gave us the hard sell on things like their rewards card and appetizers and drinks. Eventually we asked him to move us to another table and he found us a table outside on the patio. Much warmer.  The food was okay. Kids mac & cheese was bland but kids pasta was good. Turkey burger melt wasn't anything special. Wife's salad and flatbread was just okay.  To get the kids mac & cheese off the final bill the server had to find the manager who then had to come out and give us a visit before taking it off. He was friendly and nice but the whole process took an unnecessary 15 minutes.  Next time we'll go to Bru's Room. There was nothing special about BJ's.
Food_Zen Z.,"Provincetown, MA",0,14,1,2.0,9/9/2014,"Oh boy where do I start? The building is beautiful but everything else is just awful. It was a weekday and we were there for lunch. Server was OK  our drinks took about 10 minutes.Dining room was pretty empty. We had an appetizer the avocado egg rolls it was good but out of 6, 3 of them were burnt. I had the Cesar salad with a deep dish pizza. The pizza was not impressive at all i think i had better pizza at pizza hut. My salad was soggy and drenched in dressing. My mother had the Cobb salad which was also smothered in ranch dressing and the lettuce was chopped so horribly. it was also very soggy. We told the server to comp the Cobb salad because my mother was very unhappy he came over and had a very confused look but the item was comped off the bill. We had a very disappointing lunch here and I don't think we will be returning anytime soon. We should have just stuck to Sweet Tomatoes close by but wanted to try this new place out which ended up being our biggest mistake that day. Beautiful exterior and interior but service and food was HORRIBLE! SKIP IT!"
Curtis P.,"Pompano Beach, FL",32,31,4,3.0,5/8/2014,"Not gonna lie, this place is growing on me. Visited tonight for the third time, and thought it time to review. Went with my two kids, who are not exactly kids anymore. (20/17). Chad our server was great. The restaurant was busy but not crazy. Have been here on a weekend, and the waits can be horrendous. We started with calamari appetizer. The squid was crispy and delish. I like the two dipping sauces as well. I ordered parm crusted chicken and thought it was great. Nice portion, moist and crunchy goodness. My son ordered the fried chicken, and he liked it as well. My daughter had the honey lime scallops, which i tried, and they were well seared, with a nice spicy sweet finish. Her rice side was ordinary and a bit bland though. Onto dessert. We ordered the pizzookie trio, three different cookies, warm with ice cream on top. We loved it! I had a cup of coffee and we were out the door for $66 plus tip. A decent value these days i think. I recommend you try BJ's. Very large menu selection, good service, and decent ambiance for a chain restaurant. Just beware the crowds on weekends and during season/ college break."
David B.,"North Lauderdale, FL",0,6,,3.0,1/5/2014,It's a shame that the service sucks because the food is really good. My job is close by so I frequent the restaurant for a quick yummy lunch but good luck getting a server that us actually attentive to your needs.
Lance N.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",29,17,40,5.0,8/31/2013,Great tasting food. Defiantly will come back to try the other options on the menu. Soup in a bread bowl awesome. Jambalaya was filling and satisfying.
Steven W.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",11,7,,3.0,11/26/2013,"Great place for apps and hangout with friends!  Went for a quick dinner and opted to take the open seating on the patio.  It turned out to be a little to cold to enjoy the meal and our server John quickly made arrangements to have us seated inside despite losing us and our potential tip!  Even after we moved inside be checked up on us..kudos John!  As I mentioned before, the apps were great, the Parmesan chicken was a little bland as was the Tuscan dish.  That won't deter us from returning."
Shontelle M.,"Boca Raton, FL",1,6,,5.0,1/18/2014,"This is the best place ever!  After moving here from Arizona we have missed this restaurant. Thank you Coral Springs for bringing it close. The southern fried chicken and blonde beer is outstanding. You will not be disappointed. The pizookie is amazing. Chelsea, our server, was the best.  I will be back."
K D.,"Miami, FL",1,11,,1.0,1/7/2014,"The service was horrendous. We sat for 20 minutes without even being acknowledged. Then our drinks took another 15 minutes almost to get there. The food took forever as well and since we were in the bar area we got to watch the micromanager touch every plate that left the kitchen. The food was tasty, but overly greasy. I had the California burger which was served on over buttered bread. I also ordered the hefeweizen beer and it was OK, but off in a way. The place seemed in general chaos and the waiters seemed stressed. I doubt we'll be going back."
Brian H.,"Delray Beach, FL",0,5,,2.0,12/22/2013,"I have had mixed experiences here .  Some are good some are bad, I will share both.  Went to BJ's once ordered a burger and there was a bone in the meat that I almost cracked my tooth on.  I informed the manager he was very nice and said that has never happened before.  He removed the burger from my bill and that was that.   The next visit everything was fine ordered the roast beef dip it was good came out a little on the colder side , not a big deal.  3rd time ordered the salmon dinner.  It was absolutely awful.  Salmon was grilled and was crunchy over cooked and dry.  Seems like they had the grill way to hot.  Overall decent place be-careful when chewing their burgers and don't order their fish it's really nasty."
Steve B.,"Pompano Beach, FL",9,14,1,1.0,6/14/2014,"I went in three weeks ago, sat at the bar and ordered the most basic fireball on the rocks. They didn't have it. At that moment I should have picked myself up and headed right to Big Bear where I know it's good every time. But I did not. I proceeded to order the porter house steak with steamed green beans and a Cesar side salad. Oh boy.... The salad came out wilted and brown but I stuffed it down my gullet anyway. Then the steak came out. No steamed green beans to be found on the plate. I got mixed veg instead. No worries. I'm easy and I've learned from many of my restaurant working friends to never return food. I touched the steak and immediately felt it was Way Rare. I asked for medium rare. I cut the steak open and it jumped off of the plate and ran back to the kitchen still mooing. My next words were ""check please"". Cashed out and then enjoyed my fav pretzel encrusted chicken at big bear. Never ever again."
Michelle K.,"Sunrise, FL",25,5,8,1.0,3/21/2015,"We had a horrible experience at BJs last night that started from the moment we sat outside on the patio.  When I asked a server if it was ok to seat myself outside they told me to go ahead but when David came over he made a big fuss that I should have seen the hostess first but agreed to serve us ""this time"".  My husband and I each asked for a sample of their craft beer and ordered the fried calamari as an appetizer.  The app came out before we got our beer taste so of course we finished our appetizer before we ever got drinks.  The calamari tasted like they forgot to season it.  We waited entirely too long for our meal.  I watched as another table nearby was bussed, a new party sat down and was half way through their meal while our burger and Roast beef dip sandwich were nowhere to be found.  I asked the waiter to check but he insisted the long wait was all in my head.  When the food finally came out my husbands jalapeño burger was missing the jalapeños and my roast beef was ice cold.  Our server came over and asked if everything was ok and looked at my husband and said, they didn't give you jalapeños"".  (He knew before we ever complained why did he allow it to be served to us?) he did go to the kitchen and bring out some fried jalapeños.  Meanwhile the manager Oscar finally came over and I found him to be very obnoxious.  He wasn't apologetic at all.  He took my cold sandwich and removed it from the bill and acted as if he had just done me a favor.  This is such a shame.  We really liked this place on previous visits but this was over the top bad to worse.  We will not go back."
Taylor W.,"New York, NY",4,18,3,2.0,6/25/2014,"The service is great, but the food is yuck! I tried it over and over again and the only thing worth eating are their pan cookies with ice cream!"
Melissa M.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,2,,1.0,12/14/2014,"I have been to the BJ's in Pembroke Pines and had less than a pleasant experience. So I figured we would give the Coral Springs location a second chance. I immediately regretted that decision. We used the online ordering system as we were going to have take out. We placed the order at around 8:15 pm. I called the location after I received my order conformation to just be sure they received it. I was told no abruptly and to call back in 15 minutes. After closer review of my order conformation it stated I placed the order at 9:00pm and that it was actually for Nov 17 at 9:15pm. When I called back to inquire about this I was put on hold for another five minutes, only for the girl to come back on the phone and tell me that she spoke to her manager and that just couldn't be possible maybe I did something wrong. They took my order over the phone and we went to pick it up. I at that time told the employees at the take out counter that maybe there was a glitch in the system and they should have someone look into it. I was again told that could not be possible. Not to mention the lack of service, but the food was sub par as well. The burgers we ordered were dripping with grease and soggy bread. I really wanted to like this place but that won't be possible. I really wish I would have gone with my gut and went to Big Bear instead."
Delia K.,"Pompano Beach, FL",1,1,,5.0,10/4/2014,"I'm a frequent customer at BJs, especially the Coral Springs location. During my most recent visit I had the best service from the waiter, Chad. He was super fast and came over to the table frequently to check up on us. I plan to ask to sit with him the next time also. I don't usually applaud the service at restaurants unless it was an excellent experience and it definitely was beyond excellent tonight at BJs."
Zen B.,"Pompano Beach, FL",93,3,,1.0,12/28/2013,"Went there on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and the pizza they brought out was not cooked all the way through. They then brought the manager over for a horse and pony show that we didn't ask for. After explaining what went on he took the raw pizza and said we will make you a new one.....after waiting about 20 minutes, they finally brought out a new pizza. Yes it was cooked all the way though.....BUT....it was COLD! The deep pan that is supposed to be scalding hot was cold! If I was the manager and had unhappy guests I would have made sure that was the best damn pizza they ever had. Especially after being told they were getting 2nd shot at impressing an already unimpressed skeptical patron. Guess my idea of ""good service/good food"" and BJ's are a little different. This is very similar to the last time I ate there. They have no concept of food quality control in the kitchen. It takes more than a nice looking place to stay in business. The bottom line is the food has to be good and the service has to match. BJ's has neither of these in place.  And to boot, the hostess couldn't have been less friendly.  I will be spending my hard earned money else where....I suggest everyone do the same."
Norine F.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1,23,5,2.0,6/7/2014,"the kitchen needs to wake up...the server brought the Ahi tuna poke platter, minus the poke sauce...the lettuce   finely shredded it didn't look like lettuce.  the chef left off the avocado, but added the lettuce core."
