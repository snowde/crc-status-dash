Carlos M.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,4,,5.0,12/5/2013,"The happy hour here is incredible. I've been to this bjs twice and enjoyed both times. Quick and friendly service, healthier food options and cheap drinks. What's not to like? People that live in this area seem to be bit too tough on new places."
Steve P.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,2,,1.0,1/1/2014,"The mozzarella sticks were good and thats where the positives end. The waiter was either drunk or clueless, we had to point at the menu for him to grasp what we were trying to order. My ""medium"" burger was burnt and the five cheese pizza was unedible, I dont know if the cheese or sauce was rancid but it had the unique flavor of vomit. Will not be going back, there are plenty of other restaurants to patronize in the area."
Marlisa S.,"Pompano Beach, FL",8,23,,2.0,9/7/2013,"Disappointing.  Place has been packed since opening a few weeks ago, but they seem to need work out some kinks.  Our server seemed very inexperienced and lacked any kind of professionalism, even for a casual restaurant like this.  Drinks took almost 30 minutes to arrive, appetizers took about 20 minutes and then the server said that our food was up, and did we want it.  Umm..no, not yet, but we also don't want it to be cold.  She looked perplexed.  The food was all right, not spectacular.  We had chicken potstickers as an appetizer and they were good; the jambalaya and the fried shrimp both suffered from poor quality, ""frozen-textured"" shrimp.  The shoestring fries were crispy and well-seasoned, and the cocktails were tasty and fairly priced.  But our send off from our server included a lackluster, ""Do you think you'll be interested in dessert? We have some good stuff.""  We will try again, but hoped for more on our first visit."
Kathy P.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,3,,2.0,5/19/2014,We have eaten here before and the food is good but the service is horrible. We came on a Monday night and it wasn't busy. We waited for a table and once seated we waited over 10 minutes...without even ordering drinks. We decided to get up and leave without anyone that works there even noticing. Ridiculous service!
Debbie W.,"Pompano Beach, FL",39,4,1,3.0,9/3/2013,"Freezing cold , bring a sweater.  It 15 mins to puruse the massive selection of brews and food.  Waited 25 minutes for lunch to be served. I ordered a chicken quesadilla arrived cold , husband ordered turkey burger. It arrived good and hot and he enjoyed it. The waitress was super friendly and the manager  came by too.  We will come again but will be prepared. ."
Mark H.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,4,4,3.0,1/29/2014,"I've been back a few times, and had no problem with food, but service is incomprehensibly slow.  Severs disappear for lengthy periods, even at hours when business is slow.  Seems to take forever to get food on the table."
Mary P.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,3,,1.0,2/13/2014,"Worst service ever. I called on Wednesday to make reservations for 9 on Saturday, and the ""manager"" who took care of me over the phone said they didn't take reservations until 9:30, but that I could go earlier and they will put me in the waiting list as a walk in. Which I did when I got to the restaurant at 6:19. I explain this to the host in the front and she said no problem that still might take about an hour to hour and a half (that was ok to me). An hour later I come back to the front and I asked them if they could add 1 more person so instead of 9 we would be 10 and also asked how much longer was it going to be. Their answer was that we were going to be seated at 9:30 bc my reservation was a that time (that same person didn't put my party in the wait list, she automatically pulled a reservation that apparently the manager put on the computer even when he said I could walk in). I spoke to the manager and explain the situation to him (very nice tall skinny guy, can't remember his name). We expecting to have a better night sat down to have some appetizers and drinks.  Cynthia was hour server, she looked inexperience, everything was taken way too long.  We even asked another server what was going on, why was it that even to get a drink was a nightmare and he said ""the service here is the worst, I'm sorry you have picked this place for your reunion"". We decided to pay our tabs and just go to another restaurant. But the nightmare didn't stop there, Cynthia gave us a crazy bill whit things twice more times than they were supposed to so we told her to verified it and make different receipts so the birthday guy didn't have to pay (that was terrible) she got more confused so she had to call another manager to fix it for her, we waited for about another hour between they could clarify the account, corrected and we could pay.  This last manager has a 2letters nickname (AJ, JC) something like that.  First time there and the worst experience ever.  Manager, hostess and servers need training.  They didn't even made the attempt to make us feel better and stay."
Brad V.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,8,1,2.0,2/8/2014,"The food and beer are always great. The service is an issue, our server was good but the hostess WAY under-quoted our wait time. My wife and mom's food were barely warm and had to be sent back. In any good establishment the manager would have stopped by to mend this issue but the managers seemed more interested in standing in the lobby talking to each other. This is very disappointing and similar issues have been seen at all BJ's we have visited. We will return for the food but something must be done regarding company-wide customer service."
Charlene W.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,25,,3.0,1/11/2014,"Mediocre food at a decent price.  You get what you pay for.  Lunch menu is good decent quality, portion at a fair price.  Will be back for the chocolate chunk pizookies!"
Joseph R.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,1,,4.0,1/13/2014,"I went to BJ's for the first time yesterday. The service was excellent and the ambiance is pleasant. I ordered the BBQ pulled pork sandwich, which was delicious. The only reason this is a 4 star review is due to my wife's entrée. Her fish tacos were bland and contained very little fish."
Robert L.,"Deerfield Beach, FL",41,2,,5.0,9/28/2013,"Great food (amazingly big menu list) at a reasonable price and terrific beer.  The Tatonka Stout is the best stout made in the U.S. (seriously, from a beer geek).  Service is nice, an outstanding place to go for lunch or dinner, or just some excellent beers (try the Jeremiah Red or, in season, the Grand Cru, very impressive)."
Carlos M S.,"Hollywood, FL",0,2,,1.0,9/18/2013,"Don't waist you hard earned money in this place if you want to dine, visited last night with my family, service horrible even a waitress gave us a ""thats what I asked!!"" just becouse a child asked again What did you said? Pizza just OK not a real Chicago deep dish, my son ordered sirloin and it was a dollar cut so bad could not finished. Again worst service ever!! Waitres with face like eat the place food obligated. RUN AWAY !!"
Al R.,"Manalapan Township, NJ",8,16,,2.0,2/27/2014,We used BJ's as a meeting place for a family dinner with cousins while visiting Florida. The cousins raved about it so we tried it. The ambiance is great but that's where it ends. We ordered the light beers. They took forever to come to the table along with the waitress. When we got the beer one person liked it the other thought it was not good. We exchanged it for another terrible tasting beer... The food arrived and 5 of the 6 meals were ok. The enlightened turkey burger was under cooked. Almost raw inside. By the time the waitress returned most of the people finished eating so it was returned for a credit. I would have been ok with returning the food and exchanging it for something else but the waitress wasn't coming back to the table. We ate there on a Thursday evening. It wasn't a Saturday night where you expect lousy service and food. Since I returned my food I shared with another eating with me. Their food was totally mediocre. This restaurant needs the guy on TV that goes into businesses and turns them around to be really successful !!!
Maggie A.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,43,,2.0,10/13/2013,"This place opened a little over a month ago in Coral Springs. The first three weeks was impossible to get in this place without a 2 hour wait on weekends. We were dying to try it out, we figure it must be terrific.  We finally got to go on a Sunday afternoon. Its a big place.  The hostess told us that our waiter/waitress would sign us up for the rewards program. We asked our waiter. He did not want to be bother and told us to go to the website and sign up. The menu is American Pub basic fare.  The beer was good. We ordered clam chowder soup, Turkey sandwich came with french fries (McDonalds type) and Crispy over fried calamari.  The quality of the food is mediocre. They are trying to imitate Cheesecake Factory (far from).  Our waiter mix our checks with another table, when we call it to his attention. He took the check left, came back with the same check and told us that the other table had paid our check and he could not re-do it without getting in trouble. Told us to take out of his tip. It was a $3 difference our loss between our check and the other table. We paid it and gave him a tip. I was not in the mood of arguing and did not want him to get in trouble. However, looking back we should have asked for a manager.  We decided, we will not be back. Not worth it. I lived in this town for many years and have seen restaurants come and go. Closing within a year. This town is hard on restaurants it can came make or brake. Service and ambiance in this town is more so than food quality. Brus Brothers does not have to worry."
