Brionna H.,"Delray Beach, FL",486,102,502,4.0,6/22/2017,"I absolutely love this place! The ambience of it is big and dimly lit to set the mooooood. My favorite beer is the blueberry - it's so light and refreshing! I had the ahi tuna appetizer, it's delicious with the wonton chips I wish they gave you a bit more for every bite! They load it with avocado and that can never go wrong! And the poozkie you literally can never go wrong with. Warm and gooey in the middle with a nice crust surrounding it! I got the trip platter and got the macadamia nut, Oreo, and Triple chocolate made with Ghiradelli. The macadamia nut was good, wasn't a hugeeee fan of it. Next time I might sub out my trip for the peanut butter poozkie. The triple chocolate is so rich and delectable! Some bites I feel like the chocolate ice cream was just a bit to overwhelming but I will just make it a double chocolate instead of a triple next time and sub out the ice cream with vanilla! Lol. The Oreo is THE ""WINNER""! Seriously each bite it literally tasted like a Oreo it's the best! And that's hard for me to say because other times I had the s'mores poozkie and it's been awhile since I found anything better. I mean common how can you beat toasted marshmallow!"
Min D.,"Pompano Beach, FL",121,36,31,4.0,8/7/2016,"Four of us went here for my dad's birthday.  We were seated quickly, and the waitress quickly took our drink order.  We ordered chips and guacamole as an app, and everyone enjoyed it.  My mom ordered the flatbread pesto pizza, my niece ordered a cheeseburger, my father ordered the broccoli cheese bread bowl, and I ordered the broccoli cheese soup.  Everyone enjoyed their meal, though I will never order broccoli cheese soup from here again.  There was something about the flavor that I didn't care for.  My niece and my dad shared the dessert trio-it was gone in five minutes. Overall, it was a good experience.  Also, the picture in the back of the restaurant is a pokestop for those of you who have kids that play Pokemon Go."
Jennifer R.,"Sunrise, FL",126,23,58,3.0,1/10/2017,"Always a big fan of this place. It has a variety of gluten free options. Can't go wrong with the gluten free pizookie. This time around I came with friends for a quick dinner. The atmosphere is sports bar like but a little more on the modern side. I had the fried artichokes for appetizer. They had the avocado rolls and mozzarella sticks. And of course the skinny margaritas. Just quick, fun and yummy!"
Danielle L.,"Coral Springs, FL",36,10,1,1.0,6/28/2017,"I didn't even want to give it a 1 star. The service sucked. The salad came out w the meal.  Then we ordered a steak dinner and it was all fat, absolutely disgusting and unappetizing. The bill came and the server said they would adjust it and he did not. The service is always lacking and poor."
Andrew M.,"Buffalo, NY",84,20,,3.0,12/7/2016,One of the big things I enjoy about living in Buffalo is that we a wide verity of restaurants to go to that are not chain restaurants. When I moved to Florida a lot of people said that chain restaurants are a dime a dozen down there.  After being in Florida for a month or so the chain restaurant thing got kind of stale and we didn't enjoy going out to eat as much. No yes there was all new places to check out and they mostly had the same menus or something similar in a different form. When we found BJ's we were a bit hesitant as we didn't really look at the menu before hand since it was a quick dinner stop while Christmas shopping.  Over all I thought that they had a great menu and they had some different options for drinks and desserts as well. The wait staff seemed a little uninterested and it was hard to get our servers attention from time to time. One of the perks was the music in the restaurant was great! It know it sounds corny because it was just some radio station but they played great alternative music that just wasn't readily available to listen to on the radio down there.
Bri V.,"Pompano Beach, FL",4,80,,4.0,3/13/2017,I've been here twice  The waiter was polite  Took a long time to get our order but The food was good  Will come back
Rebecca H.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/16/2017,"On behalf of my mother: ""Last night, 6 of us went to BJ's in Coral Springs. We called ahead and had another 30 minutes to wait when we got there , no worries. We really weren't in a hurry. We got seated 20 minutes later but it took some doing because they tried to put six adults into a booth that was accommodating to four adults and two kids not six adults. The air conditioning wasn't working right. The fans helped but it was uncomfortable. Musta been 80 degrees in there. We finally got seated at a table. It took 2 requests and 40 minutes to get water. It took 35 minutes to get the appetizer which came burnt and cool. It took another 30 minutes for dinner to arrive. 4 dinners were returned because they were ice cold ( as in out of a refrigerator),1 dinner was already being remade in the kitchen because of an error they made while they were preparing it. 1 dinner was ok, probably because it was a sandwich and needed no cooking. 2 dinners returned came back ok. One was so salty it couldn't be eaten. And the 4th just gave up and didn't reorder. The 5th came back so late she wasn't Hungry. The bill was wrong. It took another x amount of time to fix it. No manager ever came by during the course of the evening so we asked to speak to one while we were waiting for the bill. No one came. We went to search one out and 16 minutes later he arrived at the table. No apologies no nothing. He didn't want to hear anything that anyone had to say. He seemed annoyed as he was stuck in the kitchen cooking. Not a very nice person and certainly not someone who should represent a large restaurant chain. He did not seem to want to hear or do anything but in the end, he took our bills. We got there at 7:30 and we left at 10:20, hungry, hot and bothered. I don't recommend BJ's in Coral Springs until they fix their problems including their management."""
Brent M.,"Boca Raton, FL",142,605,1694,3.0,10/2/2015,"Everybody in my dept at work like to come here for birthday lunches. We are here about once a month it seems. The food is pretty good and when you order ahead of time, the food comes out quickly. I don't think they ever got all of our orders correct, or even delivered all of the meals (forgot someone).  That said, they always correct the issue quickly. I haven't had a chance to try the beer the dinner menu, so I am reserving more stars until I give that a try, they I will adjust accordingly."
Tairyn A.,"Coral Springs, FL",526,680,7288,4.0,4/25/2016,"I've been here a few times. I like their menu, it's a little more upscale than say, Chili's and the such, but their prices are still very reasonable. They also offer healthier options such as Quinua bowls, and brown rice. Their lite menu truly feels lite, not just the same food, only half the serving (or less, you know who you are *cough Cheese Cake Factory)  On this visit I had the light thyme chicken. It was delicious. Only 690 calories according to the menu, but it didn't lack flavor. It was still a lot of food. One thing I noticed and commented on was how hot this dish was. This is not a complaint! Often times my food is luke warm and that is a turn off for me. The fact that we came close to closing time, and my food was piping hot, was a definite plus for me. Hubby had a full rack of ribs and they were falling off the bone, finger licking good... I'm not a rib person, and I had some. Service was good. Not out of this world, but good. Decor is that of a more upscale sports bar. They have lots of beer on tap. Multiple TV's with different sporting events on. Overall a good vibe. I'd definitely be back!"
Alejandro B.,"Pompano Beach, FL",17,185,429,4.0,7/11/2016,"Second time here, not too bad. Waitress (J name but i forget her name) was awesome. Good food, large portions. The breadbowl soup is pretty badass. After sharing the breadbowl with 1 other person we didnt have room to eat anything else so we had plenty of left overs.  Its a nice, large & clean restaurant with a huge menu."
Karri M.,"Pompano Beach, FL",2,25,12,2.0,7/27/2017,"Took 15-20 minutes before our table was ever greeted by a waitress. Ordered chips and salsa that took over a half an hour to get. Food is overpriced, ordered a side of roasted cauliflower that didn't arrive to the table until after everyone was finished eating their entrees, but I was still charged for it. Super slow service, was there for two hours and not because we got carried away with talking but simply because everything took forever. This has been my experience the past two times I have been there and I will not be returning"
Danielle J.,"Pompano Beach, FL",189,220,429,4.0,4/1/2016,"This place can get incredibly busy so make sure on the weekends, you prep yourself to wait. They brew their own beer like a Brickyard Brewery type thing, a microbrewery I suppose? The beers are okay, I stick with other ones though. They have plenty to choose from. The food menu is overwhelming for me, like a Cheesecake Factory kind of assortment and I never know what to order. The food is good, you can get pretty much anything. I've had plenty of the appetizers and 2 of the pastas.  If you're in Coral Springs, I recommend trying it out. It's not your average restaurant down the University strip of franchises. Check it out."
Nicole B.,"Asheville, NC",1,56,9,1.0,1/11/2017,"Three strikes and their out.  First, it is freezing when you walk in.  Also, there are constantly dirty tables that are just left for extended periods of time.  Host(ess) doesn't know how to accurately measure a wait time.  Let's get to the food. When you get it right, fresh and hot the first time, it actually is pretty good.  On all occasions, they have messed up my sandwich order of either no onions or mayo.  If you don't like something on a dish, you can't just take it off, the flavor is still there.  Second, everyone's food comes out at different times, what's the point?   One of the times, I literally had to leave my friend after waiting over 20 minutes and asking the waiter several times for the check.  I shouldn't have to beg to pay a check.  I tried to track down the manager to get the bill, yet couldn't find one.  I went up to the waiter and told him I was leaving. I don't understand why people go back for horrific service and food that comes out cold and wrong every single time.  Will never go back to this restaurant again.  They need to properly re-train every single staff member of this place, front to back, especially management. Just horrible."
Denise G.,"Oakland Park, FL",96,7,,1.0,10/19/2017,"Went here Sunday night for a quick bite, sadly the place wasn't extremely busy. Was sat in Brooke's section, she was very pleasant BUT after placing a drink and food order got our appetizer BEFORE every getting a water or cocktail... then mini pizza came it was very doughy and although edible wasn't great. Brooke asked if we would like anything else, yes, Parmesan cheese for the pizza. Of course that was brought with 1 slice left to eat. I went to speak with a manager who could CARE LESS about my concerns, NEVER came over to my table after my complaint. Brooke was more concerned with me speaking to management then management. Brooke gets 4 stars on sweetness but needs a lil work on order and customer expectations.. I would love a drink before food arrives. WONT BE BACK, not even due to Brooke, she is human and perhaps felt overwhelmed, the manager's aloof attitude is not someplace I care to spend my hard earned money on.. BJ now stands for BAD JOB in my book.."
Rick S.,"Pompano Beach, FL",1,3,2,3.0,2/19/2017,"Was my first time in this restaurant. Anytime I go to a new place, I like to try something they are known for. I saw they started out in Chicago as a pizza place, so naturally I tried the deep dish ""Chicago"" pizza. I got the five meat special. I wasn't too thrilled with it, to be honest. It wasn't very deep, but I loved the way it was served. The taste was nothing to brag about.  Our waitress was great, she was very polite and super thorough. No one had to ask for anything more than once and the decor was expansive and comfortable. I also ordered calamari as an appetizer and would definitely recommend that dish to anyone looking for solid calamari.  If you are a Pokémon Go player, there's a stop right at the front of the restaurant, and you can't go wrong waiting on your table and getting some pocket monsters while you wait!  Overall, I'd say you won't get ripped off going to BJ's, but if you are looking to be wowed by their ""deep dish"" pizza, you'll be deeply disappointed. Find something else on the menu; however, as I heard my friends really liked their dishes.  Cheers!"
Serena G.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",208,89,236,4.0,3/27/2017,"The service here is okay. I like the food and the food is sold at a reasonable price. They have a variety of good to pick from in their menu. Also, the restaurant is very clean and nice."
Jennifer S.,"Pompano Beach, FL",15,6,,5.0,7/22/2017,"We love this place.  The service at the bar is always great.  Today we went in for lunch with Wein(bartender) his knowledge of the beers they carry is excellent for a kid his age. Definitely recommend everything on the menu as we probably have had it before!!  Correction, we have yet to have a pizzookie, lol."
John B.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,19,4,5.0,7/16/2017,the best craft beer and a burger at the bar that I've had in a long time. Dayton Beach location has great service and mind blowing food
Rachel S.,"Delray Beach, FL",18,3,27,1.0,6/3/2017,Worst place I have ever been to in my life! There was a piece of paper in my brothers chicken no big deal wait best part is manger came over took it and left and NEVER came back like we're we being punked? Dinner care so much about the food as how the manger handled the situation my 3 year old would do a better job!
Gregory L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,10,3,2.0,2/13/2017,"I have been coming to this BJ's location for a few years now and the service has steadily declined.  It has only gotten worse now that the BJ's application has been launched.  DO NOT ORDER YOUR FOOD THROUGH THE APP!!!  I cannot stress that enough.  Our food order was lost and the servers were completely confused.  The food, once we got it, was delicious as always.  Their food, their homemade sauces/dressings, and homemade sodas are the only thing keeping this place going."
