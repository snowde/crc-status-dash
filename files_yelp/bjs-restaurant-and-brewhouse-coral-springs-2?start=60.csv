L M.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,3,1,1.0,10/1/2017,"All Show No Go!  From the rude greet from the hostess, terrible service, cold food & manager who didn't seem to care. We will never return. Our busboy took care of us the best!  Better clean up your act BJ's seasons coming!"
Andre R.,"Hollywood, FL",0,1,,1.0,9/29/2017,"There is only one thing worse than being served a terrible meal: being served a terrible meal by an earnest bartender who's ""regular"" is hawking the first time customer for their seats at the bar. The definition of a paying customer is not concrete at this establishment. Not only are entitled snobs allowed to stand behind and chirp at the customer enjoying their Friday night but they are encouraged to time the customer from last bite to payment of bill. And so to the fine establishment that is BJ's Restaurant & Brewery in the fine city of Coral Springs Florida, or the scene of the crime as I now like to call it, I find you guilty. You are guilty for not having a timer on the back of each bar stool to let the fine high class people stalking behind the paying customer know that the customer sitting at the bar must stop drinking their beers and give up their seats immediately after paying their bill. This is not sports bar and the customer is not allowed to watch sports and finish their beers. In terms for value for money and experience this place falls short of the 7-Eleven around the corner."
John T.,"Hollywood, FL",11,4,,1.0,5/8/2017,"Worst experience ever!!! I order online thru the curb side service , an hour in advance since me and my girlfriend were  felling under the weather,  I got there was no one on the curb side service or the take out, I ended up going inside to the bar to ask to the bartender, I asked her for my order  and she had no idea, she went to the kitchen and come back saying that there was no soup or steaks and that the manager was gonna come out to make it  up for us, h e came out and told me that I could substitute it for anything else, so I asked to the girl what were my options and she went and asked the manager again and at the end she just came back to told me that they were not doing anything, that just order something else!!! I was on shock and I left there 2 hours after I ordered with no food on my hands, definitely worst experience ever!!!"
Louis S.,"Wesley Chapel, FL",16,64,107,5.0,3/28/2016,Well I guess it finally had to happen. This was the worst meal that we have had since they have been open. My wife ordered a California club which was supposed to have both avocado and bacon. There were 2 small slices of avocado and no bacon. When we asked our waiter he said yes they were supposed to be on the sandwich took the check and brought it back without changing anything.  I ordered a pulled pork sandwich which has always been excellent until today. It was the worst. A very small amount of meat with a piece of bread that the cook put mayonnaise on and then wiped it off. It looked as it was rushed while putting it together and was full of fat. Needless to say we will not be eating here for a long time.  I had to give them 2 stars for the homemade sodas that they The server was very good. I believe her name was Virginia. Everything came out hot and she was always there to refill our drinks and ask if we needed anything. Very good.
Gary J.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,14,,5.0,6/3/2017,"The pizookie is the greatest thing I have ever experienced at a restaurant. The Bison Burger was also really good, but it just can't compare!"
Yesy F.,"Hialeah, FL",8,12,,1.0,4/11/2017,"If I could I would not even rate this location 1 star. I have never experienced such obvious racism and discrimination like what our party experienced on Sunday night. The restaurant was empty and the staff basically refused to sit us. When we suggested we (party of 12) would sit in the bar area they stated they didn't want to overwhelm the staff. The entire outside was empty and there were a few tables inside that were empty. We still insisted but they refused to help us. We requested to speak to manager and he took a very long time to come see us. He basically did not introduce himself and when we finally had enough and said we were leaving he, the manager opened the door and let us leave. He never introduced himself. If you are not white then you will probably not be served. So disappointing given this day and age."
Brian H.,"Chicago, IL",0,55,,4.0,5/27/2017,Menu has a huge variety (maybe to much it's hard to choose).  I had the baby back ribs and they were good.  Garlic mash and veg were a bit boring and under seasoned.  Maybe I should have chose better! Service was attentive workout being annoying.  The cookie dessert was very delicious!  Overall I would return.
Sidra A.,"Boca Raton, FL",62,109,132,2.0,8/14/2017,"I have seen the big building for BJ's restaurant everytime I drive down University, but never had the chance to try it. Yesterday my friend wanted me to meet his sister and kids so we decided to finally check this place out. It is quite impressive when you walk in; with high ceilings, black furnishings, and dim lighting. We were seated at a circle booth, which we liked. We noticed that the menus were all different. Apparently, there are 2 editions and they didn't bother to toss the old ones out. This caused some confusion in ordering. Secondly, the kids both ordered chicken nuggets. After 15 minutes, the server came out to tell us that they did not have any. I don't know why this could not have been communicated earlier. We placed orders for alternate items. A few minutes later, we got our deep dish pizza. It was done well, albeit a little pricey for $15. They forgot to bring the Dr. Pepper and we were waiting for a long time. Meanwhile kids were sitting hungry and tired, while adults ate.  Finally kids food arrived. Kid 1 liked his grilled cheese sandwich, but kid 2 hated his fettuccine alfredo. We had asked for a box for the soup and dip and it came at the very end. Anyway, when it came time for dessert, we were so tired of waiting around that we decided to pay the bill and walk over to Chili's. Yes, it looks nice and fancy but the service is slow and the food is the same quality at Chili's, with a higher price. I felt bad to meet his sister first time and to have a negative experience. She said ""well it's good to try a new place, but let's never come here again""."
Sue S.,"Tamarac, FL",1,6,,1.0,9/7/2017,This place is HORRIBLE!!!!!! We were here with two other couples on a Saturday night with a reservation. The service was THE worst. We were there at 6:30 and didn't get out of there until after 10:00. The food orders all got messed up and had to go back. Avoid this place. If I could've I would've given it a big fat 0 stars.
Chuck M.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,11,3,1.0,5/10/2017,"Went to this restaurant on Monday night (5/8/17) around 8pm with my family. The kids and I split a large meat pizza  (1/2 off on Mondays) and within 30 mins of leaving all three of us were complaining of stomach pains. The next day my kids were fine, but I was stuck in bed and couldn't leave because I needed to stay in close proximity of a toilet. Horrible feeling and I believe the health inspector should check this place out. Never again."
Ryan S.,"Coral Springs, FL",164,33,,3.0,4/9/2017,Food is not bad. Service is bad - every time. The location in Pembroke Pines is infinitely better.
Elizabeth S.,"Miami, FL",186,48,43,3.0,8/22/2016,"I want to like this place, but the service is pretty slow and recently, the food under-seasoned. I ordered the ahi poke and the chips were not salted and the slaw under the ahi tuna was bland. The tuna tasted fishy to me. For these reasons, I didn't really enjoy my dish. The Brussels sprouts, however, were pretty flavorful as they were fried and had sriracha on top."
Jonathan R.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",47,144,334,3.0,9/16/2016,Get the cookie brownie dessert.  We had the burger - good.  We had the southwest salad - ehh. We had a panini - ehh.  Our waitress was very nice - tigra.
Joe M.,"Pompano Beach, FL",1,103,292,3.0,2/15/2016,"Good, solid food; a little pedestrian but the ridiculously huge menu means everyone can find something they will want. The fresh baked cookie dessert is out of this world, highlight of the dining experience. Good for large groups but call ahead to be sure you can all sit together."
Saul B.,"Coral Springs, FL",38,25,12,5.0,4/5/2017,"Came here once and i was impressed i never heard of bj's u till i came i was surprised at how excellent the service was, coming from a background of working at high end restaurants, i enjoyed how my water would get filled up instantly which is something other places should do too, food was ok but great experience overall, coming here again."
Ruth P.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,7,1,1.0,4/3/2017,"Went today for lunch. It was my first, and probably my last, trip there. First, the service was HORRIBLE. The waitress was no where to be found. Getting my tea refilled took forever. Actually my INITIAL glass of tea didn't come until after the appetizer. And the food. Can you say SALT??? Both the appetizer and the entree were so salty I left most of it. Such a disappointment. With so many other restaurants close by, I see no reason to return for sub standard service and food. Do yourself a favor and drive down the road to Big Bear."
Priscilla B.,"Boca Raton, FL",14,79,23,5.0,7/24/2016,Love this place! We had an excellent waitress. I had the guacamole burger and my daughter had the pizookie. Both were super yummy!!
Sean O.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",32,23,,4.0,5/11/2016,Been here a couple times for lunch and dinner. I've only had their burgers which are really good. Love the selection of crafted beers and always get the sampler.  So far only negative is give yourself plenty of time to wait for a table if you go in the evenings on a weekend. They did do reservations when I went with a large party. Afternoons for lunch I may have waited 5 minutes if at all.
Lissette C.,"Orlando, FL",48,64,26,1.0,1/13/2017,I'm a huge fave of BJ's brewhouse because I love their pizza and they always have great specials going on plus who doesn't love their pizookies? But One thing that I have a problem with is the service at this location. As an former employee I know that it shouldn't take 15min to be greeted and another 20mins to take our order. I've been to this location about 3 times and each time and the service has been the same with service so slow your food comes out cold. It it's wasn't for the gift card I have I wouldn't come came to this location ever. They need to clean house and rehire employees who know how to serve
Stefania L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",91,19,8,5.0,8/3/2016,I loved it!! Deff recommend i love going to eat to try new places and try new drinks. I love their 6.95 5oz tasting their handcrafted beers amazing. I recommend the white peach margarita ! And their shrimp is amazing. Great service!!
