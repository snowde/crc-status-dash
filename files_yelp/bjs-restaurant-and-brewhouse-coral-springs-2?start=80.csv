Keisha R.,"Lauderhill, FL",36,15,36,1.0,1/15/2017,"Service SUCKED & the food was very mediocre! Our server was Sam, I literally had to go looking for Sam at 1 point. And the place was empty but Sam kept getting lost. Needless to say I am HUGE on service! This establishment won't be getting my money ever again! I will be sure to spread the word to anyone I know as well"
Don W.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",40,12,10,4.0,8/17/2016,A plethora of craft beer and decent food with improved service since opening 2 yrs ago. $4 beers on Wednesday a welcomed addition.
CeeCee S.,"Margate, FL",71,5,1,1.0,2/11/2017,Very poor service. Was sat outside for 20 min before I went in and requested one of the four standing and chatting would at least help us with drinks .. ordered finallyb20 min later.. ice tea with little ice and no sweeteners  as requested x 3.  Salad was wrong.. no avocado means no avacado.  Allergic reaction much? Tables remained dirty the entire time we were there.. no pride in food or service.   Can someone please take pride in what you do please?
Gary S.,"Coral Springs, FL",1,2,,1.0,7/16/2017,"Last night, 6 of us went to BJ's in Coral Springs. We called ahead and had another 30 minutes to wait when we got there , no worries. We really weren't in a hurry. We got seated 20 minutes later but it took some doing because they tried to put six adults into a booth that was accommodating to four adults and two kids not six adults. The air conditioning wasn't working right. The fans helped but it was uncomfortable. Musta been 80 degrees in there.  We finally got seated at a table.  It took 2 requests and 40 minutes to get water. It took 35 minutes to get the appetizer which came burnt and cool. It took another 30 minutes for dinner to arrive. 4 dinners were returned because they were ice cold ( as in out of a refrigerator),1 dinner was already being remade in the kitchen because of an error they made while they were preparing it. 1 dinner was ok, probably because it was a sandwich and needed no cooking. 2 dinners returned came back ok. One was so salty it couldn't be eaten. And the 4th just gave up and didn't reorder. The 5th came back so late she wasn't Hungry. The bill was wrong. It took another x amount of time to fix it.  No manager ever came by during the course of the evening so we asked to speak to one while we were waiting for the bill. No one came. We went to search one out and 16 minutes later he arrived at the table. No apologies no nothing. He didn't want to hear anything that anyone had to say.  He seemed annoyed as he was stuck in the kitchen cooking. Not a very nice person and certainly not someone who should represent a large restaurant chain. He did not seem to want to hear or do anything but in the end, he took our bills. We got there at 7:30 and we left at 10:20, hungry, hot and bothered. I don't recommend BJ's in Coral Springs until they fix their problems including their management.  On a good note ice cream at Larry's seem to help."
Marie B.,"Miami, FL",2,13,,1.0,2/21/2017,"This is the third time I gave them a try as my family loves this place but I just can't get on board.  The food is dismal and the service even worse.  Lunch took us 2hr 30mins because of the service being so slow.  The service was working her tush off I guess just not a lot of help.  It took forever to get ketchup to go with our burger, then get a refill then get the check.  Very long process for lunch.  The food is not up to par at all.  I had the ham and cheese melt.  The sandwich was not edible as it was swimming in greasy cheese with some store bought ham.  I wanted to like this place so bad but it just did not cut it.  The décor is great at least."
Heath W.,"Coral Springs, FL",66,39,15,2.0,5/11/2016,"Update- I received a response from regional management who addressed our concerns, which is more than I can say for other big restaurants.  The food is excellent and the menu changes frequently with updated offerings, we stop by often and while the food is great the service has been iffy each time we have been here, it's either the servers are overwhelmed with too many tables, because they do try and they try hard, or the kitchen manger is just in need of serious improvement. Orders do not come out timely or in clumps with dishes meant for other travels mixed into our orders. It's been this way since they opened. I don't blame the servers but the kitchen management and the GM, I am not ever sure they read these reviews, since this isn't the first review which seems to state the obvious, if they do or better yet if corporate reads these they should seriously consider a management upgrade.  This place has potential but one of the reasons we don't go as often as we should is because of the poor management issues mentioned above, if the service was better we would go more. For example this afternoon my during lunch our tables order didn't come out all at once but was mixed with another tables order, some at our table were served and some at their table was served leaving half of out table to wait to be served and the rest waiting to start to eat, the same with the other table not in our party.  This is just one detailed example, there are others. If you don't mind poorly managed places and can deal with that go for it, the food is great and the beer selection is bar none."
Robert W.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",76,46,4,4.0,3/6/2017,Jody and I had lunch here last Wednesday 01-March-2016. I had the coupon for the free Appetizer (it was expired ). We ordered the potato skins as an appetizer they were some of the best we ever had.   We also both ordered burgers mine was the Hickory Brisket and bacon and Jody's was the Classic cheeseburger.. Both were cooked perfectly and the fries were some of the best I have ever had.. They also accepted the coupon for the appetizer even though it had expired..Service excellent  The Oasis beer I had ordered was excellent little bitter  but still delicious. We will be back ..
Kerry W.,"Sevierville, TN",0,8,1,4.0,1/21/2017,"Had a really great meal, and an excellent dessert. Waitress was terrific. The only thing was it did take a little while for the food to arrive, but overall a great place. Looking forward to going again."
April C.,"Pompano Beach, FL",2,34,1,3.0,4/13/2016,"Not impressed.  Definitely overpriced for the quality of food.  I got the fried Artichoke as my meal and we shared an order of Calamari.  The Calamari was ""good"", tender and seasoned perfectly. But the artichoke tasted like it was store bought and not fresh at all.  It had that disgusting vinegary taste (that I detest) to it which was a total turn off. The ambiance and decor is amazing outside near the fire and the inside is similar to that of a ""Flanagan's"" - not bad however. The grand kids love it tho! Their selection is vast however, I'd prefer Cheesecake Factory any day."
Ash B.,"Pompano Beach, FL",1,11,4,2.0,7/20/2017,"We when to dinner 2 days ago I love this place but this time around it was the worst experience I had been with BJs. We got seated by 9:30 our waiter didn't see us unit 5 mins later. By the looks of it she had a lot of tables that she had on her owe, she takes our order for the drinks that took another 10 mins. When we placed our food order to make easy on her that took 40 mins to get our food it was cold and the steak looked like left over from somebody else that might not wanted. My other half was like this is not fresh at all. Called the server over and she took it back to make other one. She came back and stated the manager is going to make it. After waiting on that to I asked for deserved and they run out of the chocolate cookie that's fine because it was tue that when they have there cookies and ice cream for 3.99. Got something else. I asked for the manager and she came by I explain to her what happen and how was the services tonight she apologized and walk alway. We got the check and still the steak was still on there wow after all that. We left there when they were closing. Will not come by for a long time."
Samantha R.,"Pompano Beach, FL",101,73,468,3.0,9/11/2015,"We came here on a Saturday night around 7:30 with a group of 7.  The wait wasn't too bad it was about 15-20 mins.  While we were waiting we all decided to head to the bar and grab some cocktails.  The drinks we had all were pretty good.  I had an adult root beer that had Irish cream, Jameson whiskey, Bailey's and Root beer. Just like a regular root beer with a kick.  There strawberry martini was strong and sweet.  The margarita wasn't bad either.  The bartender we had was very nice and fast.   For dinner we started off with the Best beginners appetizer combo, which had Spinach and Artichoke dip, Avocado egg roll, Sante fe spring rolls and Mozzarella sticks.   The sante fe spring rolls reminded me a lot like Chili's egg rolls.  The avocado egg rolls are my favorite.  Spinach and artichoke was just okay,  not the best I've had and the mozzarella sticks tasted just like any mozzarella stick.   For my entree I had the Deep dish lasagna. It's was like having a creamy cheese filled ravioli with Italian sausage and pepperoni pizza in one dish.  You would love this dish if you like ravioli, sausage and pepperoni.  My husband had the Southern fried chicken which came with peppercorn gravy,  mash potatoes and corn.  I tried it and it was delicious.  My sister had the bbq bison burger and I don't like bison at all and I actually liked the flavor of the burger.  I  wasn't gamy at all.   My aunt had the mac and cheese and she didn't like it at all.  Thought it tasted like the mac and cheese from Pizza Hut and it had way too much garlic in it.  My cousin and uncle had the seared Ahi tuna salad.  It was very light and refreshing.  Over all most of us enjoyed our dishes and drinks.  Our waitress was very nice and was on top of filling our drinks.   The atmosphere is nice and it's clean.  I only gave it three stars because it's just an average chain  brewery restaurant."
Summer S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",186,126,114,5.0,11/10/2016,I love every BJ's Brewhouse location that I have ever been to. This was no exception. Everything came out quickly and we were served by a friendly and helpful server. Their happy hour was until 7pm and he managed to get our orders in on time and even acquired some happy hour prices for us a few minutes after happy hour officially ended- That's some great service!
Brie B.,"Margate, FL",16,21,63,5.0,5/20/2017,"Our lunch experience gets 5 stars based on Jevon, the awesome server (5/20/17). I got there before my friend so I perused through the menu. I asked Jevon if the menu had a separate section for vegetarians & he said no. But he did take the extra step of not only advising me of the vegatarian options, he also showed me on the menu where they were. So besides the already friendly service I received when I first sat down, his hospitality was on on point. Jevon was friendly & constantly checked up on us. We had a free app coupon. Our app order was a little complicated for the flatbread pizza, but it came out great. Our food was good overall. Since my friend brought me bday gift & balloon, Jevon took upon himself to give us a free dessert. That was very considerate on his part. I asked Jevon to have the manager come over to our table. Scott, the manager, came by so I could compliment Jevon on his fantastic service. I am glad I picked this place for my bday lunch. It was my friend's 1st time & we will be back!"
Krystal R.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,14,2,2.0,9/22/2016,"Service is absolutely slow. Took 15 minutes for a drink order/app order. We had to grab someone and ask for our waiter to come back so that we could place our dinner order as we were left alone for about 20 minutes after drinks came. 30 min for food. Steak was very well done when ordered medium, they brought a new one pretty quickly and that was very good. Asparagus side was loaded with pepper, and would have been delicious otherwise as pieces that happened to not be covered in the pepper were. Alcoholic beverage ordered was mostly ice. Those cookie ice cream desserts that they have were awesome though, so that was a nice closing to the night."
Greg B.,"Pompano Beach, FL",237,397,1046,4.0,4/13/2014,"My guest and I snatched a spot in the outdoor front portion of BJ's, and we had a very pleasant experience on a Friday afternoon. We had one of those flowing conversations, and I truly believe that your surroundings -- the service, the food, and especially the libations -- can collectively contribute to a fun experience. I had a couple of pints of beer, and they were cold and delicious. I also had some spinach/artichoke dip that was creamy and delicious. They also had a large screen TV with the Masters on, so I could sneak a peek from time to time.  I'm certainly looking forward to sampling other beers and other menu items in future visits."
Natlie F.,"Tamarac, FL",233,175,1545,2.0,2/4/2016,1. Waiter made us wait too long to order. 2. Waiter forgot every and anything we asked him for lol. 3. The food was not good. It either had no flavor or too much seasoning. The cook was awful tonight because I've been to this location before and it has never been this bad.
Ricky J.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,2,,1.0,6/18/2017,"It's Father's Day and I came out with my family for what I hoped to be a great meal. When our waitress came we ordered water and she brought us water bottles with no cups, (not a big deal and definitely not why I'm writing this review). We began to order and our waitress just practically ignored everything we said. I had to repeat ATLEAST 4 times for her to understand what I wanted. Our food came out and it was some bullshit ass franchise microwave quality food. The ribs were spicier than satans semen and seasoned like shit. Each persons entree came out ten minutes after the next. The manager was nice enough to take it off our bill. I ordered a turkey sandwhich and specifically asked for barbecue sauce ATLEAST 3 times and that shit definitely didn't come with BBQ sauce. Never will I return to this shit excuse of a restaurant. Great selection of beer tho."
Patty R.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,5,,5.0,6/11/2017,"I LOVE this place! Not only is the food good and the ambiance awesome- they are so accommodating! I showed up with a party of 12 on a Saturday and they had us seated in 10 min, drinks right after we sat and food in under 20- that is IMPRESSIVE! They were so wonderful and the waitress was super attentive. Will definitely be planning future party events with them!"
Brad B.,"Sandpoint, ID",0,2,,5.0,6/7/2017,"First time to Bjs brewhouse and I got to say it was amazing. Our server Julie was great and so was the manager Jason he was very helpful and friendly. Julie, Jason and the food made this me and my wifes new favorite spot! You got to try the Turkey Dip and pizookie especially the smores!"
