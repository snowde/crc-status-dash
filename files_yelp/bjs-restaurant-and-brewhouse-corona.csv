Stephanie B.,"Oceanside, CA",145,92,17,4.0,12/6/2017,"This is a review for a pick up order BJs isn't always my go-to place for dining in, but their pick up rocked today. I called in and had a coupon, and the person who assisted me was very helpful in suggesting items to me to meet the minimum for the coupon without overselling me. When I got there 10 minutes early, the order was just coming out of the oven. I asked them to keep it warm with me while I chatted with some friends I ran into and they were very nice about it. When I was leaving I noticed I forgot to apply the coupon and the manager was very kind about not making me feel bad and refunding me.  The food quality is always good in my experience at BJ's. They loose one star because I know from experience that their dine in is not usually the best service, the servers there just seem overworked, especially in the bar."
Marcia M.,"South Gate, CA",40,28,65,1.0,1/9/2018,"First time at this location. We got seated quickly. Party of 2. We ordered waters and an appetizer to start off while we browsed the menu. The server came back with the appetizer (sriracha queso dip) maybe 6 minutes later and gave us another minute to look the menu over. Once we were certain what we wanted we ordered and waited approximately 15 minutes for our food. This is where the visit starts to go badly. A server -not our server- walks over with a salad, not ours. We tell him it's not for us and he gets upset and says ""whatever then"" and turns around and walks away. We sit here a little dumbfounded but let it go it was just an awkward little thing. As soon as that server walks into the kitchen another female server comes to our table and leaves 2 of those metal stands they put the pizzas on at our table -we didn't order pizza- we tell her this and she says ""ok??"" and walks away. At this moment the first server that wasn't our server comes back to our table now with a grilled cheese ham & cheese sandwich which is what I ordered BUT there were no fries and I had asked for mine with sweet potato fries. We again sit here a little confused and don't touch the food thinking they're maybe about to bring the fries out but that doesn't happen. There are 4 pickle slices on the plate, I eat one and my girlfriend eats 2. The plate is directly in front of me, I coughed once or twice and then put actual server runs up the table and says ""oh my goodness this is not for you!"" takes the plate and gives it to another patron sitting at another table with his family. I try to tell the server ""hey we ate some of that"" he cuts me off & says my food will be right out. We sit here again just sort of stuck in stupid DID THAT REALLY JUST HAPPEN? Did he just give someone else food that we touched without saying anything!? My girlfriend is a chef by trade in the catering business and this made us question even being in the restaurant. Our food comes out this time both orders, both correct. We try to tell the server again before the man starts to eat the sandwich how they should replace it with a new one and he says ""oh it's fine"" NO ITS NOT  It just got worse from there. I would definitely not recommend this location to anyone! Such a shame."
Qasim C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",42,67,10,1.0,1/6/2018,Worst location.  My pizza came out cold. My salmon came out cold. My avocado egg rolls came out nasty. My french fries came out nastier.  Complained to manager. Didn't seem to give a shit. I had to request that my food be remade. Everything came out nasty again. Terrible customer service. Rude ass waitress and rude manager. Will complain to corporate.
Julie A.,"Corona, CA",0,2,,2.0,1/6/2018,"Food was okay, good enough to warrant left overs. However, when we left we forgot our left overs and when we returned not less the 3-4 mintues to retrieve the box and asked the bus boy if he set it aside, he was extremely rude!  His comment and l attitude was awful nor would he even eye contact when we tried to talk to him and he walked away! Not a good ending for a 1st experience to this establishment to people who.just moved to the area! BJ really needs to teach customer service to theiremployees!"
Kimberly J.,"Norco, CA",148,53,392,4.0,1/1/2018,Been here twice and both times food and services has been good... they have a large menu and sometimes very hard to decided but everything I've ordered is yummy!!!
David S.,"Riverside, CA",1,11,7,4.0,1/3/2018,Have to love their Happy Hour.  I had the Dark Horse Wine which was good.  Their craft beer is also good. Usually the service is good sometimes it's a little slow.   BJs is a nice place to grab a drink and food.
Ashley S.,"Corona, CA",68,8,6,5.0,1/6/2018,Ask for bartender Colby if you want the best time! He's amazing and funny. He will keep you entertained and beyond satisfied with food and drinks. Food was delicious (I love the Brussel sprouts) overall great experience every time.
Brandon R.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",7,12,5,4.0,12/2/2017,"5 stars for the Jeremiah Red. Is there an option for no stars; we decided to joyfully wait an hour to be seated. But another hour to get our food (I'm reviewing as we wait). The waiter didn't even fluff the time of wait. Never gave us an update. Well, I'll write another review once the food arrives.  This is a followup this review I did a couple weeks ago. After posting this, the manager was making rounds and stopped at our table. I commend him for his efforts. Apparently there was a wedding reception which made it challenging for the kitchen staff. Overall, it wasn't necessarily the waiter's or anyone else's fault. This was simply unforeseen.  With this being said, our family will be giving BJ's Corona another try, very soon.  Happy Holidays!"
Simon M.,"Irvine, CA",118,87,218,1.0,9/5/2017,"So you think all BJ's are equal? (Insert inappropriate joke here) No sir/madame, this particular BJ's was truly awful.  Since most Yelper's are familiar with the food, I'll focus on all the things that went horribly wrong.  Our party of 10 was seated at a long table and given menus, so far so good. The waiter then disappeared for 15 minutes and came back with a buddy. He introduced the other waiter and said ""you can blame anything that goes wrong on him."" Okay...maybe that was a foreshadowing of things to come. The new waiter took our drink orders and poof, didn't see him again for another 15 minutes.  Meanwhile, we're chatting and I feel a chubby drop of waiter hit my forehead. What the? I look around and don't see anything. Three minutes pass and another chubby drop plops on the table. Then I notice water lines and water drops around our entire group. Hold up! Unless that's a leaky beer tap, we have a problem. So the place is full of leaks and when I asked the waiter he smugly said ""it's just the air conditioner."" Ok, I get it, but I've never been to a restaurant with AC sweat plopping me on the dome. It was raining earlier that day so I actually think it's a leaky roof and ceiling.  Moving on, we finally got our food orders in after 30 minutes of waiting. The water arrived but still no drinks...this is really not the place for alcoholics. We remind the waiter and he says, oh you didn't get your drinks? Followed up with ""what did you order again?"" Nevermind dude! The food finally arrives and my pulled pork sandwich is salty AF. Sure would be great if I had a nice cold...doh!  In short, all aspects of the dining experience was awful. I don't expect amazing service or food at BJ's, but this location was really sub-par. Pretty sure we won't be coming back."
Ben M.,"Corona, CA",10,19,3,3.0,12/29/2017,I've been here several times and usually enjoy there beer selection. However today I noticed a new beer and asked for a sample before I ordered a pint. Our waiter said that it's now 5 cents for a sample. I know it's only a Nickel but talk about nickel and dimeing you to death.
Jason M.,"Riverside, CA",18,25,22,5.0,11/18/2017,"I went to the location in Rancho last week and it was delicious.  So good I wanted to try it again. I ordered the same things Pizza and avacodo rolls. Well, when I got home after picking up the food from takeout I found my food to be less than desirable. After talking with the manager Brian Sunday, he went above and beyond to make everything right for me and my son and in the process he gained my trust and respect. The Avacodo rolls were absolutely delicious and the pizza was perfect. I will definitely come back here again.  Thank you Brian for caring about your customers!!"
Dan N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",287,160,197,1.0,12/16/2017,"Never go here because the service and staff. The food is good but most of the time is cold before it gets to you. Beware only go here if you are really craving the food, because if you are going to have a good dining experience you will most likely be disappointed."
Linh A.,"Orange County, CA",873,20,15,1.0,12/27/2017,"I can write for days about the multiple bad experiences that I have had here but I will keep it short and sweeet. I rarely go here anymore because more times than none I will have something to be disappointed about. The servers are not too bright or attentive, and they always bring out the food cold. It's like they leave it on the counter waiting before they bring it out to you it's insane. The only highlight here is the Pizookie which is delicious and one of the few reasons I may drag myself here if I really crave it. Their food is pretty good sometimes but overall if you're loooking for an overall positive dining experience I would stay away from this place."
Lana S.,"Corona, CA",71,3,,1.0,1/1/2018,"Just stepped foot out of this BJs and no wonder they have three stars. The service was absolute garbage, we didn't have any plates nor napkins when we were given our appetizers. Waited 10 minutes just for them, on top of that the chicken wings were bland and rubbery. Overall don't waste your time and money here, you're better off going to Chic-Fil A across the street."
Matt P.,"Corona, CA",73,9,,1.0,1/1/2018,"I'd like to review the food,  but the service was so bad that out of the last two visits I've yet to be able to eat. Sitting for over 10 minutes without water or waitstaff comibg up to me before I give up and leave. If you actually want to eat, head to one of the nearby restaurants that will actually serve you."
Don M.,"Corona, CA",0,8,6,1.0,11/3/2017,"Perhaps BJs isn't the restaurant for me. After a negative experience at a BJs in northern California, I tried the one closer to home. I ordered a couple of pizzas & bazookie for dinner for curbside delivery. Upon arrival I was notified that there was no record of my order. The manager was gracious enough to explain that since they didn't offer the bazookie the order wasn't processed. The only issue issue I have with this is that I was emailed an order number, if there was no record why did I have an order number emailed to me????  He was apologetic and admitted that there should have been some notification. Had it not been for the fact that I a hungry family, I would have walked out. It took my appetite, I ended up ordering one pizza instead of two. No discount or consideration for the mistake on their behalf. It defeats the purpose to enter email, and phone number and they have no system in place to notify me that one item in the order is not available, to give me the opportunity modify the order without driving to the restaurant! BJs you're better than that aren't you?  I gave you another opportunity after a negative experience, I'm done.  This was ridiculous. I'd contact corporate to make them aware of this issue if I thought it would make a difference or had any desire to return but why bother? They got their money, who cares if they lost a customer."
Abeldia H.,"San Jacinto, CA",78,37,33,4.0,10/26/2017,"Great lunch specials. Good service.  Pepsi only. :( But had really good iced teas, so I didn't miss my Diet Coke too much."
Jason D.,"Corona, CA",0,21,,4.0,11/7/2017,"We have what we call a 2-3 month rule with this particular BJ's restaurant. If you wait 2-3 months you will forget how bad it was the last time and go back. You'd think with a menu is long as theirs they could make anyone happy.  Simple request to change dishes often lead to multiple trips back to the kitchen where I can only imagine the chef and servers bless it with a sneeze or disgust.  When it comes to service as long as you are cool with be forgotten about while Your server flirts with the cute guys at the other table. (Wtf am I not cute enough?)  or you dont mind waiting while your server forgets your place settin for The 3rd time it's great. Don't bother with call ahead seating we have called ahead then showed up at the time been told too and given the exact same wait time as the couple in front of us who didn't call ahead. And when we asked the people behind the counter they acted like we crazy. ..well we are because we keep coming back for more. I guess we are a gluten for punishment or maybe we have a special place in our heart for going to a place that once was good? Went back tonight with the family because #shortmemory and I don't know if they had a come to Jesus talk with their servers and employees but it was like a new restaurant?  Our server Sarah was extremely ""on it"" even though we sat out side which has previously been known as the ""no mans land"" because no one goes out there to help you. She was on top of it along with all the servers or helpers that came to our table.  I almost forgot that my food was a little later than everyone else's at least it came and it was really good.  Not sure if they have us on some sort of ""be nice"" list when we come in. But what a difference! Good job BJ's you are earning your way back up the food chart here in south corona"
Michael S.,"Perris, CA",0,1,,5.0,1/6/2018,We have been coming to BJ for a long time and have always had a great experience. The Friday night bartenders are among the best they are friendly and entertaining. The food is consistent suits the atmosphere. Colby's Sunday mimosas are great. We highly recommend BJ's
Clem B.,"Riverside, CA",13,22,23,3.0,9/20/2017,3 stars for the beer.  We ordered Seared Ahi Salad and Maple Salmon Pita Salad. Great food but I am giving 3 stars for the pint of beer.
Joanna S.,"Santa Ana, CA",7,42,21,5.0,9/30/2017,"Best service ever today. A big thank you to Andre and Lauren who made it so. We were a party of 7 with two kiddos and 1 infant. Andre was our waiter, he came and said hello right away took our drink order. Then checked on us regularly throughout the evening. He was polite, quick to get our orders and refills out, and very welcoming. Lauren was the manager. She came over with a warm smile to ask how everything was for which we took the opportunity to tell her how awesome Andre is. She then made small talk with us, very friendly and welcoming as well. She went above and beyond and bought is a pazooki. Thank you both for making out visit the best one yet, you both rock! Keep up the amazing service."
Cheryl C.,"Chino Hills, CA",13,11,,1.0,9/12/2017,"This BJ'S location is a hit or a miss. I've  received fantastic service on my last visit, but not this time. My boyfriend and I sat in a booth, in the bar area on a Wednesday night. This is the only BJs location that seems to be slow. Waiter is even slower.....Once we sat down, we waited quite a long time for service. When our waiter arrived, he seemed like he was in a hurry all the time, although the bar area was hardly busy at all. He was ""too"" casual with us, addressed us with ""hey"" or he would tap on our table just to let us know he'll be ""back later""....the table behind to us had the formal greeting such as, ""How are we doing today, I'm your waiter..."" so where was our formal greeting???  Are we too young to the server to receive great service? The food took a long time, drinks took a while....of course the check took forever too because we can see our waiter hanging out by the bar and talking with his co-workers.  I couldn't WAIT to get out of there.....will never return. I'll make the extra trip to go to another Bj's location!"
Moreen G.,"Corona, CA",0,3,6,5.0,1/5/2018,My boyfriend and i have been going to the Bjs in Corona for almost 5 years now and not once we've had a bad experience. The staff is always gracious and attend to us in a timely manner.  We have ordered a number of stuff from the menu and have never been disappointed. The drinks are always on point but the reason we go back on a regular basis is because of the staff. Michelle and Brian are doing an excellent job running this branch. We look foward to going to BJs everyday.
Kristen B.,"Newport Beach, CA",352,4,,2.0,10/21/2017,"Heads up if you have a party of 13 (with a reservation days in advance) expect to show up and be told you have to split your party up. Even though you can have a table of 12 people sitting nearby. Hmmm. Eventually they ""worked their magic"" and let us sit together. Funny thing was at the end of our meal a much larger party came in and they said they wanted to all sit at one table and it was literally no problem. But I mean what do I know? ‍ only reason I gave it 3 stars is because the food/pizookies are bomb.  Oh and they jipped my grandma on her free pizookie that came with her meal."
Nereida D.,"Riverside, CA",0,2,1,1.0,10/21/2017,"My boyfriend and I decided to have dinner here last night.  We were in such a great mood that even the heavy traffic we had to sit through didn't bother us at all. Although we were starving, we were in no rush.  Our waiter took a really long time to come by at our table and attend us, however, we were quite understanding because it was really busy so we sat there patiently.  The thing that really bothered me was how awful the food was. I usually love eating here; I come plenty of times throughout the year but it just seems like the food isn't as great as I remember it. I decided to try something new - It was some golden crispy breaded chicken with mashed potatoes and broccoli - at least that's what was displayed on the menu. However, when the food came out the chicken had a rubbery texture and the outside did not have that golden crispy look to it. In fact it looked burnt and had a flat texture; no crispness to it whatsoever. The mashed potatoes were just ok. The best part of my dish was the broccoli! For a $16 plate I had 3 bites of the chicken and a couple bites out of the mashed potatoes.  I was starving but after tasting my food I lost my appetite. I was honestly really upset. Coming here for dinner honestly ruined my night."
Kevin D.,"Santa Ana, CA",268,133,27,4.0,4/13/2017,"I have dined at many BJs establishments and this is one of the best ones I've eaten at. That being said, your experience may vary depending on who is on staff at that particular time. I've eaten here with my family about 10 times since moving to Corona and there have been 3 visits where the experience was not ""excellent"" and 2 of those 3 times, the manager (I can never remember her name) has always gone above and beyond to rectify the situation to the best of hey ability. I do think that they may want to be more selective in who they hire, as some of the staff are a lot less professional than others. Despite the few negative experiences and open admission that I've been less than pleased with some of their wait staff, I still give this BJs 4 star because of their food.  The chicken strips are amazing. I always steal one of my son's chicken strips because it's so good. Real, juicy chicken, perfectly crispy breading... And only for $6 (for a kids meal), it includes drink and a side! You pay that price for 3 chicken strips at carl's Jr and get 1/4 the meat!  One of the best fish and chips I've had. I LOVE fish and chips. I do not claim to be an expert on fish and chips, however, but I can honestly say that the fish and chips here are amazing. I've tried a few places in Seattle, Orange County, and LA, and this place is still easily top 3. Amazingly crispy breading and juicy fish with no hint of fishiness (wife can't stand that).  Jambalaya is really good here. I haven't been to new orleans so that's my full disclosure, but I really like the cajun seasonings. Rice is perfectly cooked, and the andouille sausage had a nice kick.  They have a new prime rib promotion the last time I went and it was pretty good for the price. It's nowhere near lawrys, but it never claimed to be. For about $26, you get a 16oz hunk of prime rib, 1 soup or salad, 2 sides, and a pizookie! They recently replaced their shoe string fries with thicker block type fries which are really good."
Ruth P.,"Diamond Bar, CA",48,10,1,5.0,10/28/2017,My server was the bomb! I signed up for he new rewards and got my free mini pazookie! That was overshadowed by the amazingly delicious Ahi tuna salad. Have only eaten at Bj's a few times. That being said I will be back more often Chase was a great server and went over the top for his customer service!
Reel L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,1,3.0,12/9/2017,"After  2 attempts at getting clean silverware, we gave up and decided to dip it ourselves in hot water.  That's how it started but not how it ended. Great service from Lorraine, she really turned the silverware fiasco with great service.  She catered to everyone's needs. Party of 8 and each dish was pretty good."
James E.,"Norco, CA",10,70,2,1.0,8/14/2017,"Ordered a beignet to go. The guy who took our order was decent, but we get home and they literally gave us a plain biscuit (supposed to be a donut with cinnamon and sugar), no whipped cream, and just ice cream and strawberries. This is HIGHLY unacceptable for $8 freaking dollars! What the hell kind of service is this?! Thanks for the rip off!"
Alexis T.,"Monterey Park, CA",1,21,8,4.0,11/13/2017,Best BJS  I have ever been too. Although I requested my portobello burger come well done it came pretty rare but server Charlie was quick to apologize for the kitchens mistake and tend to the problem quickly. He was great although there was a slight mistake in the kitchen overall it didn't really ruin my experience I just ordered a broccoli cheddar soup instead which was absolutely delicious. Thank you Charlie for the awesome service you're the best!
Maha R.,"Corona, CA",0,4,,1.0,1/1/2018,Just walked out !! Is there a rating with negative stars??? Waited about 15 minutes to be seated which is ok but to wait to be acknowledged/ greeted by a waiter for 10 minutes is not!! Waiting for utensils and napkins after getting the food is not ok either. The food was cold and tasteless especially their famous wings.. Really a disappointing  experience.  It was my son's birthday dinner that we were looking forward to.. Shame on you bj's management team..
Scott R.,"Irvine, CA",518,157,2690,2.0,1/17/2017,"I recently moved to Corona and have been frequenting the BJ's located the Corona Crossings shopping center and I'm sad to say that I am not a fan.   On our most recent visit my wife and I were looking to enjoy a simple dinner of soup and salad.  My wife and I both ordered a iced tea, side caesar salad and clam chowder.  I ordered my soup in a bread bowl.  Within a few minutes of placing our order the tea arrived.  It was wrong because we both got flavored tea instead of black so back it went.  Pretty soon the right tea came out but for whatever reason there we're just a few ice cubes in it and they were melting quickly.  Before we could complain and ask for more ice the meal arrived.  Both soup and salad came at the same time.  Granted we did not specify to bring one of the other first but most restaurants I've visited they usually ask if you want them separate of together and which you would like first.  In addition to it all coming out first my order was wrong.  I ordered soup in a bread bowl but just got soup in a bowl.  I sent it back and asked for the correct item along with some ice.  Enough time passed that my wife and I were able to finish our salads and my wife most of her soup.  My wayward soup in a bread bowl showed up with some ice for our empty iced tea glasses.  Refills please.  The refills arrived as I was finishing soup along with the check I guess at the point server realized there would be no dessert.  I went to use the mobile app to pay and discovered that even though I had put myself on the waitlist using the app they had not noted on the check that I was a member of their rewards program.  Now the wait for the server to come back update the check with my information so I could pay the bill and get points for the visit (I'll probably use them one day when I'm traveling and desperate).   A couple of days later I got an email with the opportunity make comments about my visit which I followed up on.  Soon after responding a received a voice message from the manager asking for a return call.  I called the restaurant back within an hour or receiving the message and was told the manager wasn't in the building.  The person answering the call promised to connect me to another manager and put on hold.  I waited and waited and waited.  Someone else picked up the phone and I explained who I was and why I was calling and again asked for the manager.  This time they promised me I would connect me and again I was on hold.  Waiting, waiting, waiting.  I needed to move on something else and hung up.  I never heard back from the manager.   This was the second time we had received questionable service at this location and it will be the last.  There are plenty of large national chains to spend money on that offer better service and food."
Isaac S.,"Murrieta, CA",0,3,,1.0,8/9/2017,"Had ordered taken and received drinks and appetizers in about 8-10 minutes. Pretty good so far. Then we waited... And waited. For about 40 minutes with not so much as an ""I'll be right with you"". I understand that sometimes you get caught up with a table that needs a like little more attention. But to wait that long and watch every other table be helped while our drinks sat empty and our menus sat on the edge of the table for 40 minutes. By the time the server got around to asking if ""(the appetizer) will be all, tonight"" we were feeling pretty ignored and asked for the check. 10 minutes later we got the check and another 15 until I could sign it and leave.  What turned into a promising night of good food and delicious pizzokies ended up with us grabbing food from somewhere else and going home feeling pretty bummed."
Debra B.,"Corona, CA",0,25,,1.0,12/28/2017,"The food was gross- kids meal didn't com out with the main meal. The Root beer ribs were gross. The meat was tender but the flavor of the sauce was tasted terrible-my avocado rolls tasted like nothing and I sent  them back.  The kids chicken meal, my son said it was okay and that he had better.My husband order the pepperoni extreme he said it was just alright.  The clam chowder soup he order,  he said it wasn't bad.  The quest and chips was the only thing hung with flavor.WE WILL NOT BE BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Adrian N.,"San Diego, CA",549,18,1,1.0,12/4/2017,"Use to love this place..........but that wasn't the case last night. Me and about 6 friends came in to celebrate and have some dinner and have a few drinks. On friend forgot his ID card so they wouldn't serve him drinks which was understandable. Us being all adults in our late 20's and 30's we're being treated as kids as if we were going to sneak some drinks to our friend. They might as well announced over the speaker system to every employee in the place that my friend didn't have an Id. Every time we looked over the employees were staring at us then they would look away. We even brought it to the attention of our server. It was pretty annoying to say the least.        Another issue we had was when they brought us our plates they were all wet and the spatula handel was soaking wet. Service wasn't that great neither we had to ask to have or pitchers to be refilled, not to mention my friend that wasn't drinking never got his water refilled. Not really one to leave bad reviews but the whole experience sucked."
Vikki C.,"Murrieta, CA",181,102,37,2.0,10/8/2017,Wow! What a mess! This place had our food out over ten minutes before we got any place settings to eat with. The kitchen was undercooking the steaks every time. And the steaks and asparagus was so over seasoned it made us cough and sputter from all the pepper. All tables surrounding us had all sorts of different problems. Food was taking forever to get to people and arriving at all different times. My husband and I finished our dinners before our daughters food even arrived. The manager apologized for everything and gave us free dessert. But this place seriously needs to get it together.
Patrick S.,"Mission Viejo, CA",389,16,,1.0,9/26/2017,Being from Chicago- this has to be the worst deep dish pizza ever made. In addition to horrible food their services is worse. First they don't answer the phone or they transfer you to be disconnected. Run like hell from this place...
Tyler G.,"Norco, CA",0,2,,4.0,9/6/2017,"Always great food, great atmosphere and their Happy Hour wins among all brewhouses in the area. But...the last 2 times my girlfriend and I have visited, the silverware had food caked on. The 2nd visit, I went to steal my girlfriend's knife after finding some on mine and found it had old food caked on as well. Looks like they may need to pay a little more attention in that area because this is a great weekday date night location with that one minor exception.  8/10 would recommend this location!"
Darren H.,"Corona, CA",133,260,637,4.0,6/5/2016,"Typically I don't review the chain restaurants, but I had pictures stored of a previous visit and figured it was due time to at least give BJ's its due (well at least the cleaner of the two) Haha..ANYWAYS! I dine here every now and then and what I do enjoy is that periodically they do revamping of their menu, but at least still keep some of the previous crowd pleasers. I can tell they really did go health conscious in the last few years and even I have to tip a hat for that! On this outing I decided to go simple and by recommendation of the wife went for their avocado egg roll off the appetizer section. I was very impressed by the portion size as it's beyond generous for being an appetizer (quite enough for one person to pound or if you're after a toned bikini line then there's enough to fill up two tummies). I expected it to be greasy for some reason, but found it to be crispy and light in nature. Between the laundry list of ingredients in this concoction go figure the sweet tamarind sauce it's paired with sets the dish apart. It's a pleasant offset to the slight kick from the spice within the egg roll. Highly recommended! As for the main attraction, I admit at the $15 price tag it's a bit much for a pizza however it gave me that all important food wiggle so it was worth every penny. The Brewhouse Classic tavern cut pizza comes thin crust style which sends my taste buds into overdrive when well prepared and this was no exception. The pepperoni and sausage were juicy oddly enough and the mushrooms tasted fresh and not canned which is always a plus, but I wouldn't expect that from a restaurant style meal anyways. The five cheese blend gave it that extra added BANG leaving my stomach wanting a cigarette?!? I much like others feel like Hansel and Gretel when it comes to BJ's, as you follow the road back with a trail of pizookie crumbs..another trip will be in the cards and that my friends leaves me feeling like I've been dealt a royal flush!"
Kerry Q.,"Riverside, CA",47,74,83,5.0,12/4/2016,"We stopped here on our way home from LGB on Sunday night. We don't eat fast food and like lots of beer options. BJ's had been recommended to us by friends so we parked and headed in.  We were greeted at the door and seated quickly. As we flipped through the menu, we noticed that there was an impressive beer list - something we hadn't expected but we're psyched to see!  Kristen, our server, came over with a smile and we placed our beer order: he got the the hopstorm IPA and I ordered the berry blast cider. Both are brewed by BJ's and were delicious!  We split an order of boneless wings - 1/2 root beer BBQ blaze and 1/2 parmesan garlic. Both flavors were so different but delicious! For dinner, he had chili with sour cream, green onions and cheese and I had the chicken quinoa bowl. Both portions were huge, tasty, and came home for lunch for  tomorrow.  For dessert, we tried the chocolate chip pizookie (pah-zoo-key) and it was delicious!  The good was great, the service was fast and friendly (especially Kristen - she's a peach) and you can't beat the brews. Give BJ's a shot!"
