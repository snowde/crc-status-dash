Leigh Ann K.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",1,14,5,2.0,4/12/2016,First off the horrible fish smell when I came through the door. Why would you come here for fish? ??? Then the bar tender gets slammed by the 6pm rush and they don't have a back up.  I'm good because I'm at the bar. .but our bartender is being so over worked and I don't agree
Tara R.,"Los Alamitos, CA",105,67,36,2.0,12/23/2015,"What a disappointment.  Went there for lunch.  Ordered a white peach margarita...so sweet I thought I was drinking syrup.  Sent it back....mojito. Again...extremely sweet.  Gave up on the drinks.  Ordered rolls and a pizza.  Pizza was nothing to write home about for sure.  It was just blah.  Had to get up and get our own napkins and silverware.  Food took a long time. It clearly looked like chaos.  Wont be back, at least not to this location."
Brian O.,"Corona, CA",29,12,2,1.0,11/12/2015,"Pathetic!! 3 of us ordered soup and salad,  they can't even bring it out at the same time. They scrued up for the 5th time in a row!"
Courtney M.,"West Hills, CA",20,16,4,5.0,12/31/2015,"We came in for our last meal of the year and weren't disappointed. We didn't have to wait very long and were greeted very warmly. Andrew B was our server and was so attentive and fun. He made sure we never ran out of drinks and made sure our dining experience was exceptional. He also had such a fun attitude, my daughter loved him. If you ever come here, definitely ask for Andrew if you want fast, amazing service!!"
Johnny H.,"Corona, CA",21,39,19,3.0,12/26/2014,Been going here for awhile.  Servers were always good but lots of mistakes and kind of apathetic staff this last visit. Also house keeping could improve as our table and chairs had a super sized drink spilled all over.
Roxanne F.,"Irvine, CA",29,303,357,3.0,9/10/2013,"Every time I come here, or any BJs for that matter, there's a wait. Always. It doesn't matter if it's lunch or dinner time. I don't understand why.  I have been to BJs many times and I have never been ""wowed"" by their food. That's expected since it is a massive chain restaurant. I'm not a fan of these types of restaurants, but I always go seem to find myself here. I guess it can't be that bad after all.  The thing about BJs is that they have a good selection of food and drinks. Most people can find at least one item that they are interested in. Also, the prices are reasonable. This is a good place for groups, but you should already know that because it is highly likely that you've been here with a group before."
Maddie A.,"Corona, CA",0,5,,2.0,8/21/2016,"The food at BJ's is good, I usually always enjoy my meal when I come here with my family. However, my  orders and my family members orders are ALWAYS messed up in one way or another at this location. Often it's forgetting sides, drinks we've ordered or bringing us cold food. Also the tables and utensils have been dirty several times we've come, and we visit this location often as it is close to our house. I like BJ's a lot but the quality of service is not good here. The management must know this because they always apologize and offer us free deserts and discounts without even asking what the problem is."
Armando E.,"Corona, CA",6,41,49,2.0,10/15/2015,"I came here as I have not been here for months.  I always would order the Cobb Salad,  no dressing,  no avocados or croutons.  Why? Low carb and calories.  I went to order and the waiter said,  we no longer have the Cobb salad.  So he told me to pick one from the menu.  Well,  those other salads are loaded with carbs.  If I were to take the high carbs out,  I might as well order a tasteless dinner salad.  The other thing is,  there wifi never works when I come in."
Kristin A.,"Corona, CA",0,1,,5.0,2/15/2016,Tonight my girlfriends and I went to Bjs and let me tell you... Our service was great ! I will always come to this bjs and the parmesan crusted chicken is to die for !!!
Angela M.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",77,15,,2.0,9/22/2015,"If you expect good service at this location,  you're  gonna have a bad time. Forgot our drinks. Forgot my salad. Forgot to tell us they were out of chili until we asked where the chili we ordered was. Forgot to put toppings on baked potato, and apparently the cook forgot to take the steak off the grill because the medium rare meat came out well done*.  But it's okay. We'll forget just this BJ's location exists and never come back.  *The manager did come (awkwardly) by the table, and offered my diabetic significant other a free pazooki... if that somehow makes the disappointing $60 dinner better."
Ronald M.,"Riverside, CA",77,1,,2.0,9/9/2015,"Stopped in to have a celebratory dinner with my wife for getting accepted into a university today. The evening was going great until we stepped into this store. Before i rant i must say that im an avid fan of BJ's and this experience will not stop me from enjoying Bj's atmosphere and food. Upon being sat it took our waitress 15 minutes to come greet us. This is unacceptable for a franchise of this magnitude. Upon finally greeting us she explained that she did not realize that we were sat in her section and that she was sorry. I believe that this issue could have been alleviated if this store implemented some type of teamwork among the servers, cover down when a server is MIA. Moving forward to our meal; everything was fine with the exception of our waitress not being attentive and only coming by once to fill our glasses with water. However, i did notice that our waitress is a social butterfly and preferred to hang out in the front of the restaurant with the hostess and other servers conversing. heck i even saw one of the managers partaking in the conversation while customers are suffering from poor customer service. After finishing our meal we had to go look for our waitress (who was aptly at the front of the restaurant conversing with co-workers) to get a to -go box. Once we got our to go boxes we ordered desert the three sampler pazookie. Our choices for the sampler were salted caramel, PB&J, and Triple chocolate easy order right? wrong she managed to mess up our desert order by assuming that we said chocolate chip pazookie instead of the triple chocolate like we asked for. Upon noticing that she brought us the wrong order i once again had to go to the front of the restaurant and find our server who was having a stimulating conversation with the hostess. I told our server that she gave us the wrong order, ""where she stated i heard chocolate so i assumed chocolate chip"". However she went to the back and put in the correct order. Upon finishing our desert we once again had to go find our waitress to receive our check. My question is why is a diner constantly looking for their server are servers not properly trained at this establishment? I know they are at the Cerritos C.A. and Centennial Hills location in Las Vegas. Moreover, needless to say this was my most absolute worst dinning experience with this company. Our waitress Kaley P. should tend more to the customers in her assigned stations instead of conversing with other co-workers, it will financially benefit you in the long run with better tips. However, i know B J Brewhouse will not over look this review and start to demand that servers at this location act professionally to prevent negative customer reviews. A dining experience should not be ruined due to employees/servers being unprofessional.    Sincerely,        Table 604 Served at 6:57 on 09/09/2015"
Heidi M.,"Corona, CA",61,52,274,4.0,10/24/2014,"It's clean. It's nice at this one. Ontario Mills location is usually packed and this one could be the same on the weekends as well. I just like the kind of generation that walks in the doors, usually my age group. Mid twenties to thirties."
Julio C R.,"Garden Grove, CA",94,40,4,4.0,1/11/2016,"Excellent meal here on Sunday evening. Opted for the bar seating and swooped in when someone got up rather than wait the thirty minutes for the restaurant table. Had the IPA which was strong and delicious. Artichoke dip stuffed mushrooms, fried artichokes, and chipotle bleu cheese burger were all very very tasty. Always get the wedge fries versus the skinny fries. Never a bad meal here. Service was slow unfortunately on this night. Will return on Sunday, cool atmosphere."
Marisa Q.,"Riverside, CA",5,34,7,1.0,11/17/2015,"Came in here with a party of 3. Was told it would be a few minutes. When we got seated there were so many tables open, I didn't understand the need for a wait. But we brushed it off. 10 to 15 minutes pass... no server greets us. Another table got seated after we did. They got drinks within in seconds and had placed there order by the time we decided to leave. A couple servers saw us and didn't bother to ask if we had been helped. So we got up. I decided to let the host know that no server came by and other tables that got sat after us had already been helped. All she said was okay. Really? That's all you have to say. How about, let me get a server for you. Or I'm sorry I'll find out what's going on. Nope! We didn't get anything, so we went to T.G.I.F and had a better time. Sorry BJ's but when you don't take care of your guest, we'll find a place who will take care of us."
Ciera S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",13,21,8,5.0,9/8/2015,"Came here for some drinks and lunch and it was awesome! Shawn was the bartender and we had the best service ever.. Drinks were made right, he had awesome drink & food suggestions... Advised us it was happy hour.. Just overall did a great job. Ask for him when you visit this Bj's.. You won't be disappointed! Thanks Shawn, we will be back !"
Yos G.,"Corona, CA",0,4,,2.0,2/21/2016,"The waiter threw our coasters on the table; he looked like he hated his job. The pizza was good, though. I'd rather just have the food for carry-out."
Nina H.,"Corona, CA",1,36,8,2.0,12/28/2015,"Good service......not so good food. My pizza was less than warm. My husbands Cesar salad tasted funny. The lettuce did. We had an extra long straight blond hair wrapped in our silverware on the table. My hair is black and curly. Our server tho was very tentative.....this place is a hit and miss. Sometime we come and the service and food is on point. Sometimes, like today I vow to not come back, but the bazookas and the location gets me every time. Would I recommend to a friend. Sure....I'd tell them it's a 50% chance they're going to be satisfied."
Dawn T.,"Mira Loma, CA",84,90,166,1.0,6/1/2015,"I had a terrible experience at this location on Memorial Day. But I didn't want to leave a bad review because of 1 bad experience. But after my experience yesterday I decided that this location is pretty consistent when it comes to providing salty service to its customers. On Memorial Day i was off work & my son obviously had the day off from school so I decided to take him to use his ""all star achievement award"" that he got from his school that got him a free meal from bj's. So I told him let's go celebrate. We get there & ordered some appetizers & our meals. we are enjoying our appetizers then we realize our food was taking a while but I'm not the type of person that complains easily so I let it go especially since I didn't wanna ruin the experience for my son who I wanted to celebrate that day. Then maybe 15 mins goes by & the waitress comes over & says ""no food yet?? Let me go check on that for you"" long story short somehow our order nvr made it into the system. So she had to retake our order then we had to start our waiting process all over again. Then she comes out to tell me ""I'm sorry we are out of linguine so is angel hair pasta ok for your Alfredo dish??"" Very annoyed but again I'm trying to keep a smile on my face for my sons sake. At the end of our meal she offers us free pazookies. We were full & honestly tired & ready to go so we declined. I handed her my sons award so she could remove his meal off our bill & she didn't acknowledge it. I'm not saying she needed to do cartwheels but my son is 7 & in the first grade, the least she coulda did was say wow you must be really smart!!! Congrats!!"" But nope nvr said anything...My real issues is the manager never once came over to reach out to us personally & apologize for the experience we had.  Our waitress just brings out bill back with 1 appetizer waived & my sons meal was waived which in my opinion shouldn't count as compensation because he was already getting his meal free. 1 appetizer taken off wasn't enough. But I accepted it just so I could get out of there as quickly as I could. 2nd experience I went here yesterday to celebrate my niece's high school graduation.  We sat outside & our waiter Ryan was extremely rude. He came off like he didn't want to be at work at all. Didn't smile, didn't ask if we were celebrating anything no nothing. Only nice thing he did was offer to split our checks into as many checks as we needed. But just his service was very dry & short. My family thought maybe it was just us because we were a big party & he was annoyed because of that, so we kinda started looking around and noticed him at another table there were 3 Asian girls sitting next to us & we saw him hand 1 of the girls a small box then she said something to him like maybe something was wrong with the box then he snatches the box from her then walks away & gives her another box without saying anything, didn't even look at her when he handed it to her then walks away again. Then all 3 of their mouths dropped to the floor like ""Omg what is his problem??"" So it was at that moment we knew it wasn't anything personal against us he was just rude. Luckily for us his shift ended before we got our food & another young lady took over who was PERFECT!! Very sweet & smiled a lot. Definitely a breath of fresh air.  I really hope the manager reads this, his/ her staff needs work, so much so that I'd rather drive all the way to the rancho location where I've never had any issues. Which is pretty sad cause this location is only like 3 miles from my home."
Harry M.,"Norco, CA",2,15,2,5.0,6/21/2015,"Very satisfied with this establishment. The soup bread bowls are delicious. Also had the carnitas verde fries and stuffed mushrooms. Everything was good, both food and service wise. Drinks are tasty."
Jose M.,"Corona, CA",110,16,2,5.0,1/24/2016,Amazing service! Let me premise. We tried to enjoy a fancy dinner at a 5 star restaurant and received mediocre food and worse service. Excuses on over and under cooked food and worse service with no apologies. Came to BJ'S for a simple meal and had a short delay on one of our plates. When the staff became aware they stepped up. Apolgized comped the plate and reacted quickly. Awesome service and great food. Mgr came out and said sorry. She didn't have to but that was appreciated. Exceptional staff and great food. Thanks for a great experience.
