Marlene J.,"San Diego, CA",340,270,1115,2.0,10/1/2015,"Although it's not too far from my fiancé's residence, we wouldn't normally come to BJ's Brewhouse Restaurant.  My stepson and daughter-in-law with whom we haven't seen for some time, however, invited us here for dinner.  For that, we were most appreciative.   Still, my fiancé insisted that I not forget to submit a bad review for this place.  So, here goes.... The dinner started off well.  Our waiter was pleasant and took our appetizer orders quickly.  We ordered Chicken Wings, California Club Flatbread Pizza, and Santa Fe Spring Rolls.  All were good. Us adults busily yacked away, catching up on each other's lives, while taking nibbles here and there of our appetizers, not paying attention to how much time had passed since we had first put in our dinner orders.  It wasn't until our 7-year old granddaughter nudged me away from our conversation and look at me with her big, doe eyes of hers, that I noticed that almost a full hour had passed.  She asked, ""Grammy, when is our food coming?  We've been waiting soooo long and I hate waiting so long, when I'm hungry.""  Guilt-ridden from not putting both of our granddaughters' needs before ours, I quickly searched for our server.  I diverted their attention by having them color in the objects on their paper menus, so that Grammy could judge their artwork.  Our meals finally arrived.   My granddaughters' kids' meals arrived first.  Immediately, they began to stuff themselves, burning their delicate little tongues, since the Mac 'n' Cheese and Happy Face Potatoes came without a heat caution.  The adult meals, on the other hand, arrived at room temperature.   Our runners kept switching along the way and, as a result, they were rushed and didn't know who ordered what.  We had to keep trading all of our plates with one another. My fiancé had ordered a Medium 12"" BJ's Favorite Deep Dish Pizza for $20.95 all for himself, with the intent of taking home the leftovers to eat the next day.  The dough was cold and he couldn't  detect any tomato sauce.  He only ate two  forgettable slices and asked for a To-Go box for the remainder.  Isn't BJ's known for their pizza and whose 'Favorite' was it anyway?   Not my fiancé's, at this point.  He actually threw the pizza away when he got home.  $20.95 down the drain. The handcrafted burgers on the menu had caught the eyes of my stepson and mine.  I had looked forward to biting into their NEW Portebello Swiss Burger.  Since it was priced high at $12.95, I had expected it to taste like a gourmet burger.  It did not.  It was as if it had been 'fire-grilled' several hours prior.  I was unable to detect the taste of carmelized onions (though I saw them), balsamic vinaigrette, and garlic aioli that was advertised.  My burger was served with a large helping of thin-cut fries that were neither hot nor crispy. My stepson had their NEW Fully Loaded Bacon-Guacamole Deluxe Burger for $11.95.  He's a man with few words, but you could just tell by his expression that he felt indifferent about his burger, leaving half of it untouched.  Understand that my stepson is a large, 6', part Samoan CAL-Firefighter with a ferocious appetite (usually), who just returned three days ago from fighting the explosive wildfires in Northern California, wanting to take his father and his fiancée out to what he thought would be a nice dinner.  I don't recall what burger my daughter-in-law ordered, but she was equally unimpressed.  We finished off at least portions of our burgers, not because we enjoyed them, but because we had all saved ourselves for dinner and was hungry enough to eat just about anything that was put in front of us. Another runner interrupted us, with two plates of appetizers in hand.  ""Alright.  Who ordered some Wings?""  Wrong table.  He went onto the next table over and it wasn't theirs either.  The error had prompted a discreet remark from my fiancé that those same $9.95 BJ's Premium Wings we had eaten at the start of our meals tasted better than all of our individual dinners combined.  We should have just lied and said they were ours. At least the dessert was promising because we each ordered individual Pizookies, which BJ's is also well known for.  Our table hadn't been cleared off by the time our Pizookies arrived at the table though.  So, we stacked our dinner plates atop each other ourselves to make room, while a different runner passed out our chosen desserts incorrectly once more. We decided the next time we planned a Catch-up dinner, WE would be the ones to treat,...but select another spot."
Rina B.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,1,,5.0,10/30/2016,"Yesterday my son and his water Polo team came in with a group of 24 and this restaurant was so accommodating! Went to the host and they were able to seat us right away, the manager Bryan was right there to help out as well, he definitely made us feel welcomed, I mentioned to him with were on a time limit due to another water Polo match and he said not a problem, food came out quick and perfect, definitely made such a great experience. He constantly checked to see if everything was okay and I was more than happy we decided to eat here! We were in and out without a problem and we also won the game! This restaurant is one we will definitely come back to when we're in the area! Amazing service and management!"
Vincent A.,"Corona, CA",41,1,,1.0,5/1/2017,Food was below average and the service was worse. Ordered the ziti and found hair in it. Will never go back
Mary A.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",25,12,1,4.0,4/30/2017,"Went to this location about three weeks ago, we waited the 45 minutes and preplanned what we wanted to order before we sat down. Our server was amazing and loved the fact we didn't want to waste any time. Got our mozzarella sticks appetizer served about three minutes before our main course. Our server was on time with drink refills and the one customary ""how is everything"" and on his way. We've come here multiple times and always had great service. Along with food that always hits the spot."
Cathy C.,"Carson, CA",2,7,3,1.0,8/12/2017,"This review is in regards to the delivery service only. I placed a delivery order online, for 7 menu items. I received an email confirmation for my order. However, the BJ's website gave me an error message stating that the order could not be processed. I immediately contact the restaurant to speak with the manager. He was abruptly apologetic and said there was nothing he could do about the charge at this time and that their delivery driver did not come in today. My concern is that the website allowed me to place an order for this location AND charged my credit card, without once alerting that there is no delivery available on this date. The abrupt, insincere apology from the manager, with no offer for a resolution did not help. Won't try delivery service from BJ's again. I am quite sick and stuck in my house, so thought this food delivery would help me out. It was far more trouble than help, with nothing to show for it, except a charge to my credit card."
Lance Lot L.,"Menifee, CA",53,6,1,1.0,4/27/2017,"While shopping, we got hungry and decided to eat at this BJ's, unfortunately we had a very bad experience, we waiting nearly 35 mins to get served and then the food, took about 30 mins to get our food, on top of that the food was served cold and the steak wasn't cooked the way we ordered.  They took food back and Micro Waved it, told the waiter that this was not a new plate, did you put it in the micro wave, and he stated no, so that was lie, cause the plate was extremely hot as heck to the touch.  We asked for the manger and she took about 45 mins to get to our table, told her about the situation and she replied it's very busy and we are running behind, so sorry for that, and walked off and never seen again.  I was willing to pay for the kids meals, cause my wife and I didn't eat anything.  I would not recommend this BJ's to anyone I know"
Laura D.,"Corona, CA",19,45,66,5.0,7/9/2016,"Been here many times. Never been disappointed.  Great food great appetizers great beer. Their pizza... ""forget about it""... the best. Top notch service..."
Alexis N.,"Riverside, CA",116,29,10,5.0,1/22/2017,BJs is BJs but this afternoon had shaving service by Mustafa (sp). He was so attentive and had a very pleasurable attitude. Great service isn't dead. Thanks!!!
Jesse B.,"Corona, CA",58,146,166,5.0,12/6/2015,"BJs is a pretty decent place to go for a good meal.  When visiting,  we ordered the stuffed mushrooms and the carnita Verde fries to start. I really loved those fries.  I ordered the clam chowder soup in a bread bowl.  My partner had the chili in the bread bowl. We loved our soups. I enjoyed how diverse the menu is.  There is always a lot of great food to choose from.     The servers were nice and attentive.  Outdoor seating is very nice,  we prefer it when visiting. .  Music can be a bit loud out here though, it can get hard to hear the people at your table. Food was delicious.  Serving sizes here can be really big.  My partner also had a bloody mary,  which he loved. Their mixed drinks are usually quite delicious."
Phil O.,"Corona, CA",0,6,,5.0,4/5/2017,Allways great for dinner and pizookies. Carrie B  was great and very helpfull. Will for sure be back. Try peanut butter pizookie with chocolate ice cream. 5 star dessert
Sheila C.,"Costa Mesa, CA",1,7,1,1.0,8/6/2017,"Tried this location for the first time, visiting friends that live in Corona. Late night craving for coffee and a pizookie dessert I never tried before. Wasn't very busy, in fact more off duty employees hanging out than customers. We went to the bar and ordered 2 coffees and 2 desserts. Bartender brought out the coffee pretty fast, but that was the last thing he did. Waited about 30 minutes before getting bartender's attention and asked about the dessert order, he replied ""I put it in, so I'm sure their making it"". Well he didn't ""wow!!""me with that response. I guess he didn't get the module in training on customer service??With that level of service, I was inspired to ask for the check and leave."
Christina T.,"Escondido, CA",0,18,2,5.0,2/23/2017,"Love coming to this location. Staff is friendly and well put together. I love that they have gluten free options. They have a gluten free pizza and a gluten free pazookie. As somebody with an intolerance, sometimes I get a little bloat but I do not get extremely sick. Often times the gluten free pizza is a little over cooked in my option because the bottom is burnt. But I'm hoping they will find a way to cook it less in the future. Steaks are always coked the way I like them and I haven't had any trouble with orders so far."
Becky S.,"Oklahoma City, OK",130,205,92,5.0,5/8/2016,"We had amazing service today by Lorraine! She was very attentive and never let our glasses get even half full. Our pizza was undercooked and she right away took care of the situation and even let us keep the bad one to cook more at home & enjoy. Food came out promptly and she checked bad right after it arrived. If it hasn't arrived yet, she stopped by to let us know it was on the way. Very happy today!"
Taylor P.,"Corona, CA",31,49,23,1.0,6/28/2017,The service gets worse and worse every time we come... it took ten minutes for us to get seated then about another 10 to even get our drink orders.
Brynjyn H.,"Henderson, NV",1,2,,5.0,7/31/2017,"We had a great experience here today thanks to our waiter, Damian G., whose customer service was superb! He anticipated what we needed before we had to ask and he did not delay in checking in on us."
J G.,"Ontario, CA",3,26,5,1.0,1/21/2017,It's always a bad review when they at least 5 group of people get seated before you do and they made super clear they forgot about you.
Tom D.,"Corona, CA",15,54,50,1.0,11/26/2016,Bathroom has broken urinal leaking and no TP.     Told hostess.  30 mins later - still broke and worse
Tom O.,"Norco, CA",0,15,,2.0,10/26/2017,"We visit this place often because of the convenience, but our last two visits were bad enough to do a review in hopes that management will tighten things up so we can enjoy this place like we used to.  First problem was with a beer sampler.  I wanted to try one of their exclusive beers so I ordered a sampler so I could figure out which beer I wanted with my meal.  It was a horrible sampler- all flat and the first of four samples was almost tasteless.  So bad I stuck with water.  Next visit I arrived mid week within 5 minutes of opening so almost no other customers there.  Was sat outside and completely forgotten!  I waited for 20 minutes checking emails on my phone and then realized how long I'd waited so I packed up and went to Rock & Brews across the parking lot (sat and served immediately).  Now that BJs has left us with a couple of recent poor experiences, we'll likely drop them from our rotation and patronize the handful of similar restaurants right next to them."
Paul G.,"Corona, CA",0,25,,5.0,7/1/2016,"We had an issue with our reservation and the manager was able to correct it and we were seated within minutes.    Had stuffed mushrooms which were delicious, Ginger Beer and Derby cobb which were great.   Ill be back.....  soon"
Vanessa O.,"Anaheim, CA",3,9,,2.0,2/1/2017,"Ok, I give it 2 stars only for the fact of how apologetic the management staff was after the horrible experience. What restaurant waiter staright up lies to your face about singing happy birthday to my 10 year old child. They specifically said, we dont sing unless requested. Well according to the employees they just simply do not do it. First, you have no reason to be dishonest, I would have given you more credit if you would have simply said, I am sorry we are busy. Nonetheless, a beautiful family sitting behind us made up for there rudeness by singing to my son, the mother was appauled at how we were treated. If it wasnt for the nice gesture while departing, i would never step foot at this location again. Get it together guys."
