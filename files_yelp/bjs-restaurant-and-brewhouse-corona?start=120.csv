Katie W.,"Corona, CA",57,400,35,2.0,5/21/2015,"I had to take away 2 stars for 2 reasons: 1. They no longer serve the cheeseburger pizza which was pretty much the only reason I went BJ's. The good news is I figured out how to make my own, and if it's not better, it's definitely as good. 2. The service sucked on Saturday evening (5/16/15).  Our waiter took forever to bring drinks, we had no napkins or silverware for about 20 minutes (despite the fact that we ordered appetizers), we wanted to continue drinking cocktails since we were seeing a movie later, but he was so slow that we could never ask for refills...that's a good way to kill the tip for you and the bill for the business! AND to top it off, he actually took my friend's bowl of chili away when was STILL EATING IT! Seriously! Who doesn't ask if the person is done before touching their plate, ESPECIALLY IF THERE'S STILL FOOD ON IT! He put it all the way on his tray with other dirty dishes and moved on to the next table before we could get his attention that he wasn't finished with his dish! THEN he didn't even bother to ask if he wanted another bowl since it had touched other people's dirty plates. That is just crazy to me! I was a waitress for 2 years and I never would have even considered clearing someone's dish with food on it without asking! He needs to be re-trained. Honestly, without the cheeseburger pizza and the with the crappy service, I'm not sure how much I'll frequent this place anymore."
Jared E.,"Corona, CA",1,3,,5.0,7/26/2016,"What an experience!  Let me start by saying, wow! When I walked to this establishment for the time, I was welcomed by a big great beautiful smile of a gorgeous hostess names Michelle. Instantly knew this would be a great dinner. The food was fantastic, the dessert was unbelievable! We paid the reasonably priced bill, then walked out of the establishment with our beautiful hostess  and her kind words giving us a farewell. I will comeback because of the food and because of the unbelievably friendly hospitality Given to us at the host stand. 5/5 for food 5/5 for service 10/5 for Michelle."
K G.,"Norco, CA",4,18,40,4.0,4/11/2016,Great service from our waitress! Tried the Magnolia Peach beer.... It was excellent! Balanced peach flavor with a clean finish. Didn't leave a hoppy aftertaste like some other fruit beers do. Ordered the Buffalo Chicken sandwich.... Another great choice with a side of blue-cheese for dipping! Not overwhelming on the buffalo sauce and great flavor! The lemon-blueberry pizookie was good but it could have used more blueberries. Overall good meal!
Mallori M.,"Riverside, CA",0,5,,1.0,10/2/2017,"This location is a hotmess! My husband talked me into to coming here after my sons game this evening because of the $10/$35 coupon & the free dessert. I was hesitant but gave in... it took over 5 minutes to be greeted. Our food did come quickly which was a positive with two small hungry kids. Our server never came to check on us after we got our food though and a new server came over when we were almost finished eating and said our server had an emergency and had to leave so he was taking over which is fine but it took double the amount of time to cash out and leave because the new server was getting acquainted with this new station plus I'm sure taking care of his tables too. Besides the server change which is fine because I understand things happen but I swear the tables are not numbered or they are and nobody knows the numbers. Servers kept coming to our table asking if this was our food and then trying to give our food to the table next to us. Basically this place was a super disorganized. Also my husband ordered the jambalaya and he said it had way too much Cajun seasoning but of course didn't want to send it back, not like we ever got checked on to do so but he normally hates doing that anyways. One last thing that stressed me out was the fact that the tables kept moving when the kids were moving... they slide so easily which is so frustrating. Ughh... hopefully someone got good service tonight. Wasn't us!"
Nick R.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,173,1149,5.0,5/14/2016,Came on May 14th 2016. Food was good. The staff responded well to customer needs. Despite place being full the waiting staff took care of all our needs and follow ups. Stephanie and Sean were great.  The only concern I had was my bacon cheese burger that the cooked patty had a smaller diameter than the bread.
Jill ..,"Corona, CA",0,31,7,5.0,11/28/2016,I just finished a chicken club sandwich and a wedge salad and everything was perfect.  I am soooo glad that this location has stepped up their game.
Ed R.,"Corona, CA",0,17,1,2.0,1/23/2017,"I am puzzled as to why some well established Restaurants such as BJ's would provide low quality customer service. One would assume that an established restaurant chain such as BJ's would have excellent customer service but this was not the case at this specific restaurant.  I took a trip to this restaurant with my wife and son for a nice family lunch, it was approximately 2:30pm, so there was minimal customer there. We opted to sit at the bar area (in a booth of course since we had our son), we quickly sat ourselves since there were quite a few open seats, I will venture to say there were about 15 customers in this area. I assume we would get quick service but that was not the case. The couple that sat down 5 minutes after we did, were helped before we were, a mistake one would say and I can agree with that, but they had only one server for all 15 of us customer, Pathetic!!! What kind of manager would have one server for 15 customers (One that has no clue as to what they are doing or are simply trying to save on labor costs at the expense of service), she couldn't keep up with the demand. Needless to say the food was tasty but the since the manager would rather place profits over service I feel compelled to provide them the low stars. If the manager had any type of business acumen he would have shifted the staff around to provide adequate coverage for his customers, I failed to mentioned that there were 3 young ladies simply chatting away at the take out register, why couldn't the manager have one of them help our server? Yes, but since he/she doesn't know how to manage their staff the results are unhappy customers. The customer next to me tapped me and asked ""are you getting horrible service?""  If I was the General Manager I would have a good chat with my manager to understand what he/she is doing; lack of customer service can lead to a decline in sales thus leading to the demise of such an organization/restaurant. On my way out not one of the 3 young ladies told us by or have a great day, not even a thank you, but I don't blame the employees, I blame the manager who has failed to teach his employees how to treat customers, and if this is the type of culture that is fostered, its a matter of time before someone is replaced."
Mike P.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",4,24,1,1.0,10/21/2016,"Deeply disappointed during my recent visit to BJ's. I couldn't get out of there to save my life. The server never checked on us. I wanted to order dessert but after waiting so long, I just wanted to leave. BJ's then kept me hostage since it took 20 minutes to get my check after asking and another 10 minutes to get my card back. I don't blame the server, I blame the manager for not ensuring there was enough staff to ensure his customers are pleased. Good money wasted today."
Amanda V.,"Corona, CA",118,18,5,5.0,5/10/2015,Excellent food and service. Was expecting to wait a long time since it's mothers day but we were seated right away. My server Damian was awesome and attentive to all our needs.  Extremely satisfied.
Elvia H.,"Stanton, CA",2,26,11,5.0,9/29/2016,"Neal is hands-down, THE BEST WAITER EVER!!! Enough said!!! We absolutely LOVE eating here"
Nijole T.,"Los Angeles, CA",3080,6372,5149,3.0,1/27/2015,"I am really not a fan of huge national chain restaurants. BJ's is a bit better than TJIF, Chili's and all those, but still not better than average, and average is not worth spending my money on. That being said, we came here for lunch with the in laws. They love BJ's, I was trying to be nice and my husband loves free food, so we sat through a noisy, looong lunch here. Service is fine, a bit rushed as they are always busy. Got my order wrong, of course, so by the time my food came, everyone else was done eating. I ordered the ahi, while it was very tasty, I wanted it well done, it came pretty much raw, then almost 20 minutes later, prepared the way I wanted it. My husband had a pizza, they brought him deep dish even though he ordered regular crust, so I enjoyed it more than him. In laws loved their food and apps, we didn't bother to order any. Nothing stand out good or bad, I just would not bother going back."
Nicole P.,"Whittier, CA",68,13,2,2.0,10/9/2016,Came to have dinner with family. The service was horrible. Our soups and salads came at the same as our entrees. We had to ask to refill our drinks. And our appetizer was accompanied with 2 plates for a party of five.
Beth W.,"Ellensburg, WA",0,49,7,2.0,2/8/2015,"What happened to BJ's? It used to be soooo good. Not so much anymore. I used to work at the BJs in Irvine 10 years ago and their standards were so high on food and service. That has obviously been lost or didn't make it to the BJ's in Corona.  I had a Bbq chicken chopped salad today which was wilted and obviously pre-made. They used to make the salads fresh to order. My kids had ""fresh"" veggies as their side and the carrots and celery were brown. My Hefeweizen was flat and didn't taste right.  I guess just stick to pizza if you go here, it's not that bad. Service was not impressive. It took way too long to get our drinks and food.  Won't be coming back."
Frank S.,"Corona, CA",10,66,37,5.0,2/20/2016,Thank you Chris. My family went back Sunday afternoon and they opened the patio for us. Yes it was warm out but the waiter was as nice as could be even know it was 98 deg. Out. Great service thanks de you all Sunday.
Rodolfo C.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,6,,4.0,11/6/2016,The food is excellent very family friendly environment. Although i think there waiters could be a little bit more outgoing
Jenna B.,"Laughlin AFB, TX",0,30,1,1.0,2/10/2017,"This rating, sadly is solely based on tonight's experience, other wise it would be a 4-5.  I love this place, & usually the staff is wonderful. The food is always great, I've never had a problem with that. But tonight seemed to be a different story. We got the text saying our table was ready, why? We aren't sure. We stood there while the host talked about the people getting up from the table and hopes that they were just going to sign the check real quick and get up. I'm sorry, there is people still sitting at the darn table, why would you tell us it's ready just to talk shit in front of customers about customers? Also, the bleach blonde hostess (also the one talking about the people at the table) that felt the need that it was her ""call"" on determining if the ""hot guy"" that was walking out as we were standing there was with a cute enough girl... apparently because she's sick of seeing ""hot guys"" with ""ugly girls"". Didn't realize it was in the hostess job description to determine that. We noticed a hand full of times after being seating, other people waiting to be seated while there's still people sitting at the table. Is that a thing now? I find it pretty rude to rush a paying customer in front of a paying customer waiting. She was extremely unprofessional specially for such a busy place.  I know it's a busy place, but we have always had wait staff that was on top of things (unless we sit outside) but tonight we saw our server 4 times(take our order, bring us plates, and bring us the check) one of those being we had to stop him to ask for water. Not sure if they were under staffed (which I totally understand if it was) or just not a good crew tonight. The bus boys were awesome though! Extremely pleasant, polite and on top of things. Thank you for that!"
Andrew G.,"Nuevo, CA",0,14,1,1.0,5/22/2017,Our wait time to be seated was short so that was nice. Then after sitting for 10 minutes without a server stopping by our table we left. At least three different servers walked by us and no one said anything to us. Definitely not going to spend money and have to tip service that starts off that badly. So we went to chilis.
Scott B.,"Corona, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/14/2017,"Went to BJ'S for Mother's Day today and once again the service was horrible. We arrived at 10:30 am and we sat down right away. After we ordered we did not receive or lunch for over 45 minutes after we ordered . I finally had to go and ask for a manager to ask if the kitchen went home for the day.People who came 20 minutes after us already we eating. Half of our parties food was cold. I asked if they could bring a microwave to our table. Then to top it off the waitress start trying to clear plates and bring boxes when we were only half way through our meal.I hope that it was here first day on the job. I said I would never go back to the Corona BJ's after our last experience but we grew up loving the one in Brea. Such a nice establishment to have it run so poorly. I was embarrassed that I choose take my Mom and my entire family to BJ,S Corona today"" absolutely horrible"""
Felecia H.,"Granada Hills, CA",0,3,,2.0,4/13/2017,The food was great on the other hand the service was awful I had an empty drink the whole meal the waitress walked by 4 times and never asked if we need another drink or even if the meal was fine this place is a joke if you want good food just order take out
Derrick L.,"Riverside, CA",1,17,5,5.0,3/20/2016,Had a PM porter on nitro ...awesome beer paired with a rack of baby backs.. Recommend to all my fail and friends.
