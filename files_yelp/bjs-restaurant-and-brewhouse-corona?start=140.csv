Tamara P.,"Norco, CA",0,4,,5.0,10/7/2016,"Today's server was AMAZING! my sister and I sat outside to enjoy the day. Steven M. Was so attentive & made our lunch experience like we were celebrities. I ordered the wrong plate. Both our server, Steve & the manager Sergio was sooo understanding. They brought me a new plate & accommodated us with such professionalism.  We were blown away & will definitely be back soon! Thanks BJs for the best experience I've had from all of ur locations. ;)"
Terri B.,"Corona, CA",2,123,34,1.0,10/12/2015,"Today was an exceptional bad day for the servers. Arrived at 1, server arrived 20 min after to take our drink order. After an 1 1/2 our food finally arrived. Flat bread pizza is cold with other half burnt, wings arrived fine. Personal pan pizza cold. Long story short, I do not intend to return to this facility ever!! After looking around, it was apparent that it wasn't just us receiving bad service, but others too. Management should have stopped seating and start a wait list to allow time for catching up. BTW: nice try Lisa - I did return your phone call but you never replied."
Corneal S.,"Riverside, CA",104,49,20,4.0,1/3/2016,Food is good.  I eat here a few times a week and the food sometimes can be inconsistent.  When it is the managers are pretty good with resolving it.   Staff members are pretty nice. Best tip I can give is use the BJs app if ordering to go.  The BJs app makes it easy to order pay and go.  Also with the app you accumulate points to earn free food and drinks. The one things I wish the app supported which is used to is Apple Pay.
Amy S.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",49,29,19,1.0,6/19/2016,"We've given the BJs in Corona two chances and both don't even deserve one star. We aren't complainers as you can tell by my Yelp reviews but the service is terrible and the food is bad. When I say bad, I mean literally. We did get an apology from the manager and so did the three tables around us . Never again"
La F.,"Riverside, CA",0,1,,2.0,4/16/2017,"Overrated place to eat, not worth the price. Good service, family friendly place, but the food was nowhere near as great."
Jennifer A.,"Riverside County, CA",5,42,23,2.0,11/8/2015,"This place has definitely gone downhill. I just came a few weeks ago and it was so busy the kitchen couldn't keep up. People were complaining left and right, and food was coming out cold or burnt. Instead of the manager waiting to seat people, the hostess continued to seat people which the servers didn't even have time to greet nor take tables orders. It took my server 20 min just to take my drink order and by the time my food came (1.5 hrs later) my family's food was burnt! Today is not as bad, but still a disappointment. I came to enjoy the weather and sit outside with my family. I saw the outside patio tables and just about all the empty tables still had used cutlery on them. The server looked overwhelmed to stop and grab some plates. When the busser came outside, she snapped on him to grab some plates, but still about a good two tables left because they had been sitting at their tables for awhile waiting to be helped. This restaurant overall is a disappointment. It clearly needs new management."
Britney M.,"Big Bear Lake, CA",217,625,1057,5.0,12/24/2014,"Love BJ's. Its good to go to with friends and family. Happy hour is cool, can get a personal sized pizza for $5! And cheap drinks. I LOVE there pizzokies. I've seen imitation ones at other places, but they do not compare. The watermelon salad is SO good! BJ's has the yummiest mozzarella cheese sticks ever! So gooey and delicious :),"
Marylan S.,"Orange County, CA",33,201,245,5.0,11/18/2015,"Pleasant experience here with the BFF and our 4 littles.  We went at 4:30 pm on Sunday and beat the rush.  We ordered the Sriracha queso with pork chile verde, the golden beet and arugula salad, a small BJ's favorite pizza, and kids meals of chicken tenders, mac and cheese, mini corn dogs, and grilled cheese.  Everything was delicious, hot, and well prepared!  The queso dip and salad were the standouts for me.  I wouldn't have imagined these at BJs.  The menu looks like it has been revamped since the last time I was there.  Lots of promising options for next time.  We couldn't stop eye balling the other tables' orders as they came out.   Service was quick and friendly.  Great job, BJs! I'll be back!"
Caydie C.,"Corona, CA",259,32,31,2.0,5/29/2016,"We come to bjs almost every week or for any occasion. Never had a bad experience till today. Crystal wasn't an attentive server, she didn't seem to care that we were here . We got our food before we even got our water (which we only ordered water, not even an actual beverage) okay, props to the food runner who was more helpful than our server , if it wasn't for him we wouldn't have gotten anything. Wasn't to happy about this experience , putting the wrong people on a busy holiday to work . She had 5 tables in the bar she was waiting on , may be to much to handle. Just hope to not get her as a server again."
J D.,"Anaheim, CA",0,25,3,1.0,3/7/2017,"Very disappointing food at every visit. They have had multiple chances, but no improvement. Wish it was better, but I would rather eat fast food than what comes out of this kitchen. Not sure how they are still in business."
Rose A.,"Orange County, CA",55,41,,3.0,11/10/2015,"Service: 2.5 - 3 stars. Our waiter literally threw over/tossed down the coasters for the drinks we ordered vs. simply placing them flat onto the table and setting our drinks atop. It sounds like a small thing, but it set the tone, which was way too informal and (word from my boyfriend, who is hard to offend) ""classless.""  This was also done without any formality or humorous comment, which might've made it more acceptable. The waiter just walked off after. Also, the olives in my boyfriend's martini came 10 minutes after the waiter brought our drinks, in a separate cup (?). Overall just seems like some of the staff need training in hospitality etiquette. Food: 3 stars. We ordered salads and pizookie so it's hard to say whether the food here is great or not. It's hard to mess up salad and the pizookie tasted just like they do at other BJs locations"
Pat G.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",8,10,,1.0,6/8/2016,Tried to order a regular Budwieser or equivalent and they don't have any thing other than a craft beerThen my steak came out over cooked and looking like a piece of turd on the plate. The house salad is all weeds no lettuce. Great place...not
Shawntel D.,"Corona, CA",30,14,21,3.0,7/18/2016,"Ok, I wrote my original review right after the incident because I was completely shocked and mortified that they did that and thought it was ok and acceptable and would fly! BUT, we talked to management and apparently there is a new manager there and not only did she comp my stepdads meal, she comped the entire bill. So I must say, kudos to her for handling the situation pretty well and maybe with her there, BJ's can get back to what it used to be."
Cristine D.,"Torrance, CA",615,182,1359,4.0,7/22/2014,"NUMBER OF VISITS: 1 at this location but many to overall chain. WOULD I COME BACK: yes I haven't been to this location in a while. I only visited this one because I was having lunch with some friends and this was a neutral location for all our taste buds and it was close enough to one of my friend's house.  I've had several items here. On this particular day I had their maui glazed pork chop with grilled veggies. I was a good girl on my diet so it was something like 500 calories.  I didn't get it on this trip, but I usually get their pizookies. Those are good! It's like your own personal fresh baked warm cookie in a mini pizza dish topped with ice cream. They have different cookies to choose from too. CUSTOMER SERVICE/LOCATION: I don't remember having any complaints with regards to the service. It has been nearly a year though since my visit. I do remember my cell coverage wasn't good. I have AT&T...maybe they don't have a cell tower close to the area."
Jessica R.,"Corona, CA",239,17,20,1.0,5/16/2016,I am a usual customer. My service is always good. My favorite soup to get before a meal is the chicken tortilla soup. When I was recovering from a surgery I would order three soups Togo and eat them as my meal. I recently went to bjs and got my usual soup before my meal. It was the worst soup I had ever gotten. It had white lumps in it and was really gross. I haven't craved going back since. I hope no one else experiences that.
Hannah G.,"Pomona, CA",0,4,,1.0,12/3/2016,"This is just about the last time I plan on visiting this location.  It seems like I give this restaurant chance after chance and every time, I leave feeling like I just wasted my money.  First of all, the service has gone down exponentially in the last few years.  First my boyfriend and I are seated, handed menus, waitress says she will be right back to take our drink order.... no problem.  But apparently, right back means 10/15 minutes- to ask what we want to drink.  She doesn't even look me in the eyes when I'm ordering, she's looking around saying 'uh-huh' like she thinks we are a waste of time.  She leaves, comes back literally 10 minutes later with the wrong drinks.  I let her know that this isn't what we ordered and she doesn't say anything, grabs the drinks, and leaves.  When she comes back to bring the right drinks, once she puts them down she immediately turns to leave when I have to stop her and let her know we have been ready to order.  We both make our orders, my boyfriend asks that his side salad come first.  10 minutes... 15... 20... finally, what comes out? Our meals.  Where is the side salad? Nowhere to be found.  Also, I had asked for extra croutons. What did I get? No croutons, like at all.  The woman who brought our food out was not our waitress but since our waitress had been MIA, we asked her about the side salad and croutons, said she would be right out with them. No one for 10 minutes.  At this point, we have seen our waitress at other tables asking about their meals, hasn't said a word to us.  Finally she comes over as we're almost done with our meals and we remind her about the side salad and croutons which no one has brought out. She looks at my boyfriend and says 'oh did you want me to bring out the salad still, like, now?'..... yeah, we want the side salad after the meal when we asked for it before?¿ I'll cut to the chase- she never brings it out.  My boyfriend has to walk to the kitchen area and ask some other male server to bring us our salad and croutons, after we have basically finished eating.  She never comes back other than to drop off the check.  Never refilled our drinks. I couldn't believe she actually charged us for the salad after that ordeal. She was so rude and treated us like we weren't worth anything.  I know that we look young, we're in our early 20's but that's no reason to treat us so poorly just because you don't think you'll get a big tip.  We always tip generously but this woman did not deserve a thing.   MORAL OF THE STORY- This is the last time we plan on visiting this location and if you're hungry and in the area, go to Kings or Wood which is right next door where you will be treated like a valuable customer."
Mark C.,"Corona, CA",287,162,149,1.0,6/12/2014,"Please read before visiting BJ's in cojalco. We arrived with more then half of the group there and our server asked us if we wanted to order drinks. I found out the bar only had happy hour. Like most places and most BJ's restaurants we were able to order from the bar and come back to our seats and drink. There was only a total of 4 of us ordering drinks out of the 20 people. I don't see what the harm was. The manager ""sean"" stated we aren't aloud to do that. Yet my old manager Amy who used to be manager there just earlier this year, and the other managers allowed us to order from the bar.  Like most places they allow it because it was alcohol sales. I was a bartender for 5 years.. I never heard of this rule. It was not the servers fault, it was not the bartenders fault. It was the managers fault for making up some fucked up rules.  Please be aware of sean the manager"
Hector A.,"Costa Mesa, CA",34,2,,2.0,5/6/2016,"Deep dish pizza, really?  So gross and doughy. I'll never get pizza here again. Also stay away from there avocado rolls."
Tammy R.,"Long Beach, CA",72,378,235,5.0,5/31/2016,Xavier C was great! We came after graduation & they got slammed!! Xavier was honest & said that one of our entrees was overcooked & they started it over. They gave us a side salad while we waited. I finished my water and he brought a new without me even asking! Great service even though they were slammed.
Humberto S.,"Riverside, CA",2,21,1,1.0,6/20/2016,"The service was terrible! We waited 45 minutes to get our appetizers, which we had to ask the waiter for! Then we get a salad with hair in it. We had a spill on the table and no waiter around in sight. I honestly have never had service like this at a BJs or a restaurant in general. Extremely disappointed. Ohh and we had to grab our own appetizer plates!! Ridiculous!!"
