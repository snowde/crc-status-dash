Scott T.,"Corona, CA",133,155,31,4.0,6/18/2015,"Can't really go wrong with this place. very consistant across the boards. Its a very good ""go-to"" when you don't know what you want. Their beers are delicious as well.."
Peter C.,"Riverside, CA",9,40,20,5.0,8/11/2016,To start off our waitress was terrific which made this a 5 star review. Stuffed mushrooms were delicious. Also the pizza was great too.
Melissa Z.,"Corona, CA",31,10,,1.0,3/23/2016,"My waiter had the worst attitude towards my party. Ruined the vibe of the restaurant and my experience, won't come back to this service. Threw menus on table and made me feel unwanted in this restaurant. I guess that's what I get for sitting in the bar area"
Jessica S.,"Atlanta, GA",7,78,21,4.0,9/28/2015,"I've visited this location a handful of times & always pleased. There's never a long wait, our servers have always been knowledgeable & polite. For being a chain restaurant I'm honestly surprised by the food, being a lot better than expected. I crave the 'caprese' salad here all the time! Love the little balls of mozzarella, it's such a refreshing menu item. I've tried many different items on the menu, and have never been let down. LOVE the stuffed mushrooms & avocado egg-rolls are AMAZING. I enjoy their patio as well, it's nice and open, yet cozy at the same time. I'd definitely check them out! Also, they run promos on food & drinks pretty often..right now they're doing 2 for $25 (2 salads, medium pizza, & the yummy pizookie!).. As well as they're offering happy hour during all pro football games!"
Karen F.,"Pomona, CA",49,32,31,3.0,5/18/2015,"It makes me sad to give one of my favorite restaurants three stars, but this particular location has warranted it. First, I'd like to mention that it has nothing to do with the service. Our server was extremely nice and attentive, and our drinks, appetizer, and entrées arrived in a very timely manner.  However, The entrées were extremely greasy and oily. My husband ordered the California burger, his usual, and he took one bite and said that he couldn't continue eating it because it literally made him physically ill to eat it. My husband has an iron stomach so I knew there was a problem. I tried it and nearly got sick myself. As much as we hate taking back food, we told the server, and she was extremely nice and offered the menu but my husband had lost his appetite. The rest of our food was great, but the next day, we all felt the after effects; I guess the rest of the food might've been overly greasy too. The manager came to our table to ask about the entrée, and she offered the menu as well, in addition to removing the California burger from our bill. Again the service was fantastic and the people are extremely nice, but, at the risk of sounding slightly pretentious, the food preparation on this particular day was subpar. Maybe it was just on this day that things were off, and I'm sure we'll come back, but maybe after our stomachs toughen up a bit!"
Nanette R.,"Corona, CA",2,15,1,1.0,3/30/2016,If I could give - stars I would. Went here with my family. The staff was not very friendly. They all looked like zombies. Not smiling monotone voices. We ordered burgers and we were asked how would you like them prepared we said well done. When we received them they were not well done! I sent mine back! We ordered a pazookie. How do you mess this up? It looked burnt. It was so disappointing I thought this would make up for the horrible meal. The only thing good here is the beer!!!
Kim O.,"Corona, CA",190,313,2282,4.0,8/23/2015,"Stopped by to pickup a quick order to go. I love the fact that they have a separate entrance & seating for placing orders to go. I usually go with a pizza or their amazing clam chowder bowl. It comes in a hollow out sourdough bowl , and then they toast the top of the bread and scoop this amazing thick very generous portion of clam chowder into it. So amazingly good. Clam chowder at BJ'S? Who would of thunk it!? Today I chose the chicken lettuce wrap. It's great. The chicken is seasoned well , not too salty and the lettuce was crispy and fresh. Still kicking myself for not getting the clam chowder bowl :("
Rachel W.,"Las Vegas, NV",37,10,2,5.0,4/21/2016,"We had a large group of 13 people, and we were seated right away. Mona was a friendly, fun and fantastic waitress! The food was delicious and came out quickly. Mona was attentive and we never had empty drinks. Thank you BJ's for making my family's celebration awesome!"
R.Scott H.,"Canyon Lake, CA",84,140,211,4.0,5/19/2014,Happy Hour Prices were darn good. 1/2 price flatbread pizza and appetizers. Margaritas were pretty good also. Get there early and save some money and it is a little quieter with no wait for seating. Happy Hour until 7 even on Saturday.Yay! Kyle and Danny were great servers and very personable and helpful.
Michelle L.,"Irvine, CA",154,123,371,4.0,4/11/2015,Had a late lunch- ordered the watermelon appetizer salad that was delicious and the carnitas fries. The fries were drizzled in cheese but the pork was hard and crunchy. Could have been better. Tried the triple pizooki and it was great of course. Our waiter was very friendly but had too many tables and was running to get everyone what they needed. Poor guy! Fun family place though.
Brittany L.,"Irvine, CA",87,63,351,4.0,7/29/2015,"Enjoyed the sweet pig pizza with Canadian ham, pineapple, and tomato! Waiter was nice."
Deidre Q.,"Corona, CA",197,7,7,5.0,11/16/2015,"My boyfriend and I came in today for lunch, and was served by Christy.  I never really go to bjs, since my boyfriends choice of restaurant in the area is always Bww; however today we wanted something knew and since we were going to the movies in a couple of hours we decided to eat here.  My waitress went above and beyond for us, we didn't know what kinds of alcohol they served, and questioned her for her opinion, gave us well knowledgable answers.  Being someone who works in customer service industry she definitely was top notch, she cater to every little thing we asked for. From picky drink orders to extra lemons in the water glasses. She was amazing.  Thanks Christy!"
Cody Z.,"San Francisco, CA",0,4,,5.0,3/28/2016,The Mahi Mahi fish taco was very good. Also great beer selection. Mustafa Kazmi was super awesome! Get this waiter if you get the chance. He was extremely friendly and helpful. He was extremely attentive making sure we had everything AND was fun to talk to. Very charismatic. My table couldn't help but engage him in some conversation toward the end of the night. Definitely coming back to sample another dish and grab a table in Mustafa's section.
Mickey M.,"Irvine, CA",34,27,5,5.0,3/24/2016,Ana M. is awesome! I work in the service industry and appreciate good service.  Thanks for the birthday monkey bread
Jodi S.,"Corona, CA",0,16,1,1.0,12/4/2016,"Well we're do I start.... 1.server forgot avocado rolls made excuse that they sat in the window too long they had to make new ones.  2.ordered cherry salmon no tomatoes sub brown rice was told they don't have brown rice only pilaf..told him ok I'll take the pilaf.  3.cherry salmon came WITH tomatoes and NO RICE.... took tens mins to flag server down... asked for my rice.  4.Server comes back says they don't have pilaf gives me brown rice says he'll be back with the pilaf. never got the damn pilaf!  5. Server called us JErks 6. Asked for refills and they had no more tea.., asked for black cherry Soda and apparently they took it off the menu? Weird isn't that one of their signature drinks? 7.server dropped the F bomb and offers free pizooki because my food was ""fucked up"" but says he could only give us 2 before a Manager has to get involved shouldn't a manger been involved anyways?? With this many issues at one table???? I worked for this company for many years and last nights service reminds me why I left. We heard every excuse a server could come up with last night to the point me and my friends could not believe what was happening. Server did take off the salmon but apparently thought it was coming out of his pocket because he threw the check at us when it was time to pay. This guy ruined our night honestly. I don't want to blast the poor guy on yelp but come on get it together Bjs! Two weeks ago we were given attitude by the bartender for sitting at the bar top! Lol funny thing is we came here because everyone knows the service at buffalo sucks! Should have went with our first instincts tho lol who wants to work an 8hr shift themselves then have to deal with this crap??? Stay away!"
Deb F.,"Corona, CA",0,7,,5.0,3/23/2016,"Dinner was great! I had the Balsamic Chicken recommend by Amber, and it was perfect! My husband had a rack of ribs and loved them. We sat at the bar and was served by Crystal and she was very welcoming, fun and energetic. She made the evening great!"
Brittnie S.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",34,15,1,3.0,9/8/2016,"Have been to this location twice now and I wish I had reviewed it from the first visit because my most recent experience left a bad taste in my mouth. My boyfriend wanted to treat me to a dinner date since we rarely get time together so we came to BJ's. The atmosphere is always pumped up around dinnertime and all the sports are on, everyone enjoys themselves. Our waitress comes to take our order and we go ahead and order drinks and chips and salsa. Everything came out timely but wait...there was this nasty thing in the salsa. We discovered it was a soggy old chip. No biggie but seriously it had to have been sitting there for awhile, the poor thing was limp and sad. Kinda grossed me out just knowing that the salsa had been sitting out for some time. Anyway I tried to overlook it. We ordered dinner, just some bbq sandwiches with sides (they were good. nothing to write home about). Our waitress was starting to take her time when it came time to service our table and when she would come over, she would flirt with my boyfriend right in front of me. She would completely change her tone of voice and get bubbly around him then when it came to me *switch* straightface. Good thing my boyfriend is somewhat oblivious to that stuff. Anyways she brings us more chips and salsa and again! There is another sad chip in the salsa. Its not a big deal its just careless. So I'm rating 3 stars because it just seemed like all the staff there that night didn't really care to create a good experience that would make customers want to return."
Sharon M.,"Corona, CA",108,19,,3.0,5/13/2016,"I feel like a 3 star rating is high but they don't have two and a half. This place is....hit or miss. Sometimes the food sucks and the service is good or the service sucks and the food is good...or both suck. Sometimes it is all good but not often. They are almost always pretty busy.     We come here more often than we should because they are open late. We went in and it didn't seem like the hostesses really wanted to be of assistance. We were sat at a dirty table, there were still napkins in the booth, very visible crumbs, and a sticky as hell table. I immediately asked the hostess if she had someone who could clean the table. She said someone would be over to do that, well this girl passed by us at least 3 times and we were still sitting at a dirty table. About 10 minutes passed before anyone came to the table, and at that point it was the waitress who was asking for our drink orders. She apologized profusely, but it was just kind of annoying to be sitting there for such a long time. That is the only time that has happened but it seems that we are almost always leaving bjs a little sadder than when we went in. They were pretty damn good 10 years ago but it seems that the quality of the place is declining. Oh well, doubt I'll learn anytime soon and still go here when hunger strikes at 9 pm."
Farwa R.,"Anaheim, CA",39,4,4,5.0,4/24/2016,We come to Bjs ever so often when we want to eat late. Nothing out of the ordinary.... Food is okay.... Service is at times good and at times horrible. Last night though we went and we had the pleasure of being served by Carrie who honestly changed my view on this Bjs and that's why I'm taking the time out to give this Bjs a 5 star review.... For her service. She was from the moment the sweetest thing so personable so warm so kind and informative. She even took the time out of take out all the tomatoes off my daughters mid pizza and bring 2 kids plates for my kiddos! How sweet is that! Just wanted to say thank you and to whoever goes to Bjs I hope y'all have have her as a server bc she's awesome!!
Kelly Z.,"Perris, CA",18,3,2,5.0,3/12/2016,We come here all the time and sit in the bar area. The waitstaff here is amazing and they make us feel like family.!!
