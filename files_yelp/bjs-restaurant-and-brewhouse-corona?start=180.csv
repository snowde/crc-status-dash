Yasmeen A.,"Riverside, CA",4,2,,5.0,7/20/2016,"We came in for lunch and the staff was absolutely amazing. Our waitress, Loraine, was super helpful and constantly checked up on us. Also, the food was delicious. BJs never fails to impress."
Allison nicole R.,"Huntington Beach, CA",66,35,,5.0,2/25/2016,Came here with a big party (20people) for dinner and everything was great especially the service from Donnovan and Luis! Food and service was delicious And it made for a great time!
Kathryn D.,"Orange County, CA",123,111,147,5.0,5/25/2014,"The spinach artichoke pizza is to die for!! ABSOLUTELY ALL THE P'ZOOKIES are incredible as we all know.  All times i have been here the seating was done quickly and we were greeted promptly. I don't know if we just have bad luck, but our server always went on a break during our meal. This wasn't always a bad thing but the service is always a little disjointed when this happens. A better transition is needed as we were sometimes looking for out server who had unknowingly started their break!  Nothing to truly complain about though. We will be back!"
J. V.,"Corona, CA",105,170,786,3.0,12/2/2013,"Root beer float 5/5 Bjs make their own root beer and it is one of the richest soda I've ever tried. Normally I don't drink soda but this one is the exception ! bjs original Deep dish pizza 2/5 Low on tomatoes sauce, toppings were fair, tomatoes and vegs were not fresh. Avocado egg rolls 4/5 My favorite appetizer. One plate will normally fill me up. Its stuffed with avocados and comes with a side of sweet sauce.    Pazookies 5/5 My favorite thing to get here. The white chocolate raspberry and classic chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream will leave you satisfied. Strawberry beignet. Rating 1/5 Don't waste your taste buds on this dessert. I can't believe our waiter said it was one of the most popular. It's a salty, chewy piece of bread topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, strawberries, and a ton of whipped cream. After two bites I asked if I could switch it for a pazookie because of how disappointed I was. 700 calories. Fried calamari 2/5 Soggy calamari=bad calamari"
Chris C.,"Corona, CA",0,8,16,2.0,7/31/2015,Good service terrible took forever for a small meal. My sons pizza had a women's hair in it! Bad all the way around. We come here twice a week. Not anymore
Kim N.,"Norco, CA",120,14,6,1.0,8/25/2016,"We went to BJs pizza last night for my daughters 17 bday.  The restaurant was fairly empty and the we were seated right away.  The waiter came over and was very nice and we ordered our drinks. He was very attentive at first giving very good service but then the restaurant started to fill up. We had to find him to place our food order, and it was all down hill from there. I had to find him to ask for more water, to order more beer for my husband. Our food took forever to arrive and once it got there it was good. The ahi tuna salad was very good but I had to hunt down our waiter again to get more dressing.  The service was so bad at the end we had to wait about 29 mins to get our bill.  Our dinner bill was over $250 with the 5 people and appetizers dinner and deserts. Not to mention all the beers my husband drank    Over all the food was good but service was terrible. I will not go back there. Having to hunt down the waiter for everything is not my idea of a good dinner out.  When I asked the waiter why was the service so slow he said the manager had sent everyone home because he thought it was going to be a slow night.  I even asked when we were ordering our desert if it would take along time he said no. It will be quick. It wasn't."
Alice C.,"Palmdale, CA",1851,280,506,3.0,3/18/2015,There service at this Bj was great the food was pretty good and I enjoy the customer service my waitress was very friendly and helpful. The parking is very close and I must say the drinks from the bar was great .They also have a great list of happy hour drinks and lunch special offers.
Anthony L.,"Corona, CA",1,19,2,1.0,12/22/2015,"Great food, amazing aps and phenomenal beer! I love this place. The issue is it ALWAYS leads to a fight with my wife. I always wanna eat here.... She would rather not step foot in this place. So why the complaint? It's the service! 10 mins to get a water..no refills at all even three requests later. It'd be faster if I input the orders, made the food, brought it out and wrote the bill myself.  I'm sorry BJs but this is our breakup. I'm leaving you because of your shitty service we always get here for my wife."
Jon I.,"Corona, CA",0,3,,5.0,11/22/2016,"I came here Sunday for the first time with my family. The food was So-So but the service made up for it. Zack was excellent. Love that guy. He really knows great service. I now understand why they call the restaurant BJ's. Once again, love that guy."
Sydney H.,"Riverside, CA",51,236,34,3.0,3/30/2015,"Cool place but typical to other BJ's. Nothing special, good food, good service, great beer! I visit here often sometimes for lunch while riding  with my boys. Enjoy the beer so much that sometimes I have a few of them.  Plenty of parking and there is not much of a wait when I have went."
Eddie C.,"Chino Hills, CA",3,515,294,1.0,8/6/2013,"Low rating is primarily focused on service alone.  Our waitress was the worst experience I've ever encountered as a patron!  She began by exerting the most outlandish sound of exhaustion alerting us of her frustration for seating ourselves when clearly the hostess was not at her station.  Then had the audacity to say aloud ""If You Hadn't Sat Down Before I Had A Chance to Clear The Table"", I asked her point blank ""Would You Like Us To Leave""!!  It ruined our mood and we left to Miguel's which greeted us for our patronage.  I wish I caught her name and informed the Manager to inquire if this is a repeated situation because that was clearly unacceptable."
Saide C.,"Riverside, CA",0,2,,5.0,5/7/2016,Celebrated my sister's birthday yesterday with a very large party. The manager and her staff were so friendly and accommodating. The food was great and we had a great time.  Thank you!
JooHyun J.,"Corona, CA",0,2,1,1.0,1/7/2015,Found a lot of pieces of thin plastic which was covering the pepperoni on the pizza.  My five year old son ate it without knowing.  I am furious that they put something thats can't be eaten on the pizza.
Heather P.,"Hollywood, CA",79,67,18,3.0,10/18/2015,"Roderick helped us after clocking out, because service was slow and we complained to him. We sat for at least ten mins before he came near and I asked for water told him we had been ignored. He made our visit worthwhile and kept us from leaving before being helped. The place was very busy but not a reason to be ignored after waiting for a table. Food was delicious however as was the beer. We were promised a discount or a complimentary something or other but did not get it. The waiter took his time getting us the bill we had to ask someone else for because he kept disappearing for long periods of time and then when he brought it to us, I could not hear what he said, he may have offered something but we could not hear him and I was frustrated after waiting for him for everything."
James T.,"Corona, CA",0,8,1,1.0,10/25/2016,"Havent been to any other locations but this one.  This was my 5th visit and my last.  They NEVER get my order right or something is always wrong.  Asked for medium rare steak....got well done.  Asked for ranch, never got it.  Asked for fried chicken in my salad, got grilled.  No....im not going to send my dishes back to be corrected.... a 30 min wait for food the first time was long enough.  Im done with this location.  Incompetent staff....from the kitchen to the floor.  GM can give me all the coupons for free dessert rhey wont, wont be using it.  Over it"
Liana W.,"Murrieta, CA",0,3,,1.0,4/17/2017,"I'm not even sure where to start. The fact that my grand daughter sat on glass and management could have cared less to our waiter who barely came to check on us, to the hair in my daughters pizza, and then when we do get a check and the manager doesn't even give a discount for the cut on my granddaughters leg.  He even came to our table after we received our bill, asked how we were, I told him how disappointed I was, that I would never come back and he just looked at us like we were from mars.  Unbelievable!!!  Worse service from a waiter and from management I have ever had in my life!!!  The only redeeming grace was a sweet waitress named Jessica, we weren't even one of her tables, but she checked on us more than our own waiter armondo.  Never, again Bj's. Your service has gone downhill and the worse thing is your management doesn't even care. What happened to wanting to give good customer service?!!!  Byron, you need to go back to management classes!!!"
Alexis W.,"Corona, CA",324,11,,5.0,3/20/2016,"Excellent Service , Very Friendly , Awesome Pace On Getting Out Our Food , & The Food Was Delicious ! Highly Recommend !"
Lisa J.,"Corona, CA",0,11,,3.0,10/10/2016,Spent my anniversary here.  Food and service was good.  We sat outside on the nice patio.  Would go back again.
Veronica P.,"Corona, CA",0,21,9,5.0,1/26/2015,"I have been to this restaurant at 10+ times over the past 4 years and it never disappoints. On weekends, yes it can get very crowded but the service is always great.  When considering this place, also take into consideration the day and time you choose to go, if it's ""rush hour"" so to speak or a weekend, don't base your whole experience in just one visit. The food is always great, the pizzas are amazing and the pizookies are too die for. One of my favorite restaurants now and always!"
Ticha B.,"Los Angeles, CA",1102,1623,7645,4.0,6/30/2011,"After a nice round at Trilogy @ Glen Ivy we decided to stop by BJ's to settle our bets and grab some lunch! Gotta love it when they ask you what kind of fries do you want with your burger...the McDonald's or KFC sized fries (meaning the regular small fries or their wedge cut fries). I always get their wedgers. I enjoyed this BJ's. It wasn't too packed and we waited a couple of mins for them to set up our table. Service was good, food came out fresh, yummy and quick, there's plenty of parking around the restaurant, and the place was clean. You don't really go wrong with BJ's Pizza. This location was pretty nice but wayyyyy out there in Corona.  I AM DISAPPOINTED THAT BJ'S DOES NOT SERVE HALF AND HALF PIZOOKIE'S ANYMORE.  :("
