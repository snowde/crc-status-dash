Nick P.,"San Diego, CA",19,31,,5.0,6/2/2015,"Pizookies!!!!! Definitely the best part of BJ's hands down. The cookies come so gooey and warm, it's incredible. Combine that with vanilla ice cream and it's just heaven in a (rather tiny) plate! I literally do not want to get anything from BJ's sometimes, unless it's their pizookie."
Sara W.,"Corona, CA",246,76,15,3.0,8/6/2015,"Food was fine but service was horrible!  It was not very busy, slow for sure yet we had to wait for kids menus and for everything we needed."
birdie o.,"Irvine, CA",64,86,77,4.0,8/30/2014,"Awesome location and venue with great vibes. It's a really great location with great people, the only thing to point out is it's always pact no matter what. Take out is just as good but some silverware would of been nice!"
Joel R.,"Corona, CA",0,4,,1.0,1/29/2016,This is the 2nd time that I've been to this restaurant worst experience ever and 2nd time this happens. Don't plan on making this a group area because they will rush you the entire time you are here. They gave up our table as well made me stand to accommodate others who did not have reservations. Both Management and Serves are rude and unprofessional. I've never been to a restaurant who forces you to stand because their lack of organization and scheduling. Seems this restaurant deserves to be closed and retrained. Staff unprofessional and Rude. If you have the option of driving to another BJs in a different city I recommend driving further for better service.
Ric J.,"Corona, CA",2,8,1,3.0,12/26/2015,"This restaurant says you can call ahead.  The last two times we called ""ahead"" the wait time was 30 minutes.  15 minutes later when we arrived the wait time was still 30 minutes.  If you can't call ahead than don't claim you can.  Other than that annoying fact the service is good the food is good the price is slightly higher than mid range."
Priscilla B.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",9,12,3,1.0,11/8/2015,Came for their happy hour & its GONE!!!! They changed it & now it totally sucks. You're better off going someplace else if your looking for inexpensive drinks & appetizers!!!
Dieter J.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,7,,4.0,1/25/2016,Food is good. Nice atmosphere. I have eaten here a couple of times and I recommend it.
Andrea H.,"Corona, CA",40,40,13,5.0,4/8/2016,"We came in on a friday night. It was busy but we were seated right away. Our server was Jessica O and she was fantastic. Shw is the reason I am writing this review. She was attentive, polite and all around wonderful. She even offered our drinks to go. I have always enjoyed bj's but tonight it was an all around great evening. I hope her manager sees this because she deserves a pat on the back tonight. Thank you Jessica"
Mark N.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",161,87,,1.0,6/8/2015,Where do I start! Was with a party of 20 people today. I was number 5 to place my order at around 11:45am I ordered a 1/2 sandwich with fries and their clam chowder soup. The servers were very nice I will give them that. My order arrived last at 1:16pm! The clam chowder was horrible. Way too much salt one taste and that was that. The sandwich was decent and the fries too. What took me back also was that they brought out 3 side salads and put on empty table with dressing on them around 12 noon and started serving them around 1:00pm...eck! Last my friend asked for unlimited soup and salad and as I was leaving he only had one bowl of soup and still waiting for salad. Sorry not returning. Lunch hour is just that 1 hour! Improve service and food timing.
Shaun P.,"Corona, CA",0,16,1,5.0,1/23/2016,"Went to BJ's for lunch today and had the greatest experience. Amelia was one of the nicest servers we have had in a long time. Before we finished our drinks, she already had another one at our table. Every little thing we needed, she was there to take care of it for us. She checked on our table often and made the meal enjoyable. Food was great and the service was OUTSTANDING. Will be back soon!! Thank you Amelia!"
Randy T.,"Corona, CA",6,7,1,1.0,6/26/2015,Only one star tonight in an otherwise 3-4 star place. Beautiful night for the patio. Maybe 20% occupied yet we were told we had to wait because they only scheduled one server to cover the entire patio. Who does that? Time to go back to Restaurant Management 101. Bummer. Had to sit on noisy bar tonight
Darren F.,"Ivins, UT",114,20,17,5.0,10/10/2014,Great Bloody Mary great beer selection with pairing guide. The pazookie is the best desert. Staff is very friendly. They have sport on all day around the restaurant.
Jennifer E.,"Corona, CA",4,4,1,5.0,4/12/2015,"Courtney was our server and Bartender she was great!  My boyfriend had never been here before so he was a bit cautious I told him this place has great beer and food. When we walked in the bartender Courtney advised us of the best beers on tap. We took her suggestions and enjoyed it. The food was also great had a burger and pizza, Which were both great. I live close by and love to come in for atmosphere and service is always great."
Kara Q.,"Berkeley, CA",20,14,52,3.0,7/7/2014,"Usually, I love BJs. The food is delicious and it's affordable. But this time, the service was pretty bad. Several times, our server said she was going to be right back and we wouldn't see her for over 20 minutes. Food was still delicious, but the slow inconsistent service put a damper on our lunch."
Martin M.,"San Diego, CA",3,21,19,5.0,9/22/2014,Came here because this place had nice reviews here. Cool sports atmosphere if you come in late like we did and sat by the bar and had your delicious pizza (try the one with ranch and chicken! om nom).  Will definitely be back to try more pizzas and more beer!
Apryl T.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",956,184,109,3.0,11/20/2012,"I had eaten at this Bj's once before a long time ago. We came here for a friend's wedding rehearsal dinner. She had informed the staff of the large party a week before so they knew we were coming and had the table set up for us.  The service was okay. We came in the less busy hours and our server took forever to get drinks and take orders. Since we were such a large party and couldn't fit inside the bar we asked if we could get happy hour specials and she said no. After talking to the manager then they said yes. I was happy because we were able to get a dollar off of our cocktails and get mini pizzas at half off.  Mini pizza with bacon,chicken, and ranch was the bomb!! MIni pizookie was amazing because I was feeling a little full from dinner but dessert was small enough that I could still enjoy it."
JJ M.,"Corona, CA",0,182,14,1.0,2/1/2014,"This BJs is the worse of the chain.  BJs is usually my first pick when I'm traveling as well as at home.  This Corona location will never again get our large family's business. We are appalled at the rudeness and unprofessionalism of the staff and two manager's, one is the General Manager (female.)  We had a disagreement over the inconsistent practices of this location.  It would have been easily resolved with a honest explanation and apology. The general manager was rude and unprofessional! She contradicted herself twice. Clearly she was being untruthful.  I don't understand why these representatives of BJs were so unprofessional.  We got great service at Jack in the box for lunch. What's the problem? So we (party of 18) called Fridays at Dos Logos and they said come on down! So this is where our night gets great! The server at Fridays brought to the table complimentary appetizers because they knew we were all pretty torqued at BJs. Nicely done. Great business strategy to keep customers coming back. Service was great, there was one server and she was great, did not miss a beat. The tab for cocktails, entrees, and deserts for 18 was $460.00. The lone server was tipped, $120.00. Not bad for a bunch of ex-BJ customers.  Shame on you BJ General Manager. Go suck a lemon!"
Estelle A.,"Riverside, CA",147,8,2,2.0,4/27/2016,"Wanting to fulfill my pizookie craving, I came here in the evening with a group of friends. However, I did not expect such terrible customer service--which is why I'm not surprised to see many of the reviews here reiterating that very fact. We were seated after 20 minutes of waiting and soon after, my friends and I have noticed that amongst the plethora of servers here who were bustling around helping all the customers around us, they had failed to even serve us. Finally after a good 30 minutes of glaring at the servers in hopes to catch their attention, one server took notice of our table that was situated right in the middle of all the other tables (which is why I'm surprised that the others did not notice our table for almost half an hour). Long story short, the food is exceptional at best and the pizookies are the only things worth waiting for, BUT the customer service is deplorable. BJ's--either fix your management at your Corona location or fix your customer service policy because that was unacceptable!"
Lynn K.,"Corona, CA",1,79,2,2.0,4/1/2015,"I'm giving them 2 stars because the food is good but the service is terrible. I eat at BJ's at least twice a month for work. No matter if I am with a group or with one other person the staff and service are awful. No matter the time of day! They are friendly and courteous but they don't know what they are doing. They take your order and disappear. You will see many waiters and waitress walking around, and when you stop another waiter they also tell you they will find yours. The don't refill your drinks. The food comes out wrong 90 percent of the time. It takes them over an hour to get your food. I really would never go here again if I had a choice. After several complaints you think management would figure out what is going wrong and fix it but they don't. I honestly think they don't care. They have people like me who will continue to eat here even though the service is bad."
Carla M.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",127,33,5,4.0,8/27/2015,"I am always happy with the avocado egg rolls.My server Ryan, was very helpful. I was not impressed with the peach margarita...way too sweet. Everytime I come to this location, i have a good time, good service, and leave satisfied."
