Britney S.,"Corona, CA",25,44,2,4.0,10/2/2014,"Came here for my mother-In-law b-day and we had a great time.  the waiters were attentive, and given we were a LARGE party no orders were screwed up ( it never fails when you have so many people). They brought my mother in law their famous pizzaookie (I'm sure It's misspelled) We had a great time! Will be back."
Jessmarie S.,"Riverside, CA",74,14,143,1.0,1/30/2016,"Just walking through the door was not a great experience. I asked if there are any specials or happy hour and the host laughs in my face and says it's Saturday. True, but there are places that have specials even on Saturdays.. and laughing in my face is not polite. Then sitting at a bar top for 15 minutes before being approached for drinks is not okay. On top of that we came in my friends birthday, we ordered drinks and the waitress checks our I.D.s but obviously not very well cause she didn't even notice it was his birthday. Then our waitress wanders the restaurant avoiding our table.. we waited another 20 minutes just to order our food which by the way she did not want to take so she ponds us off on another waitress without letting us know that she won't be serving us anymore. Super rude waitress, super rude host. A lot of employees but not much getting accomplished. BJ's has just gone down hill. I'll go to McDonald's next time. I will say the second waitress was amazing."
Dennis Y.,"Riverside, CA",16,29,119,2.0,9/30/2016,"to Lisa M. the manager of BJ'S. I understand you want to better your team in the performance of of your restaurant, however, the choice and decision to cater to high school students and giving them the right and exclusive use of the patio dining area fall directly on your shoulders because it was a call management has made. In short, that is your fault. a good leader does not put blame on people who makes the company run. A good leader takes responsibilities. This is not just me as as a customer complaining. I took off 1 more star because you failed to acknowledge your own failure to address the main issue. Don't talk to your team yet. First you need to learn to listen. I consider that day day failure on your part because preferential treatment was given to high school students over your everyday customer. we have family members that wer  children and elderly people who I consider my party waiting...the high school kids were ushered in ahead while we waited."
Shae C.,"Palm Desert, CA",7,25,23,1.0,6/20/2014,"My first experience at BJ's and LAST. Went here on a Thursday night around 10:30pm. We sat at a table near the bar. Our server didn't look like she was in a good mood and had an attitude. We ordered 4 drinks and it took about 15 min to get 3. I ordered a John Daly and server rung it in as a John Collins.... Totally different drink. I told her what it was before hand, but still had to come over and ask what it was again... (Arnold Palmer with Vodka). Took another 15 min to get my drink. We ordered appetizers: ahi poke, avocado rolls, stuffed mushrooms & margarita flatbread. Ahi poke was terrible. It tasted like old refrigerated fish. Avocado rolls and stuffed mushrooms were actually really good.  Our server barely checked up on us, we asked for water, never came. So we asked the food runner and came back right away. It took a while to get another round, and then took longer to get the drinks.  Everyone at the table works in the restaurant industry and we were not impressed or satisfied at all."
Teal B.,"Corona, CA",1,6,5,1.0,12/26/2014,"The hostesses are always rude and snobby high school girls. The food takes forever, even on days when it's not packed. Used to have good service, but over the years, this place has gone down the drain."
Liz O.,"Seattle, WA",678,808,67,3.0,11/12/2011,"The variety here is insane! You're sure to find something that sounds good, but that doesn't necessarily mean it will taste good.  And heaven forbid you left your patience at home, because this place was suhlowww. Parmesan crusted chicken with white cheddar mashed potatoes was satisfying. And huge.  Easily shared with two people, and leftovers for my dog.  Mini appetizers (mac & cheese and tomato & mozzarella salad) will be skipped next time; just not worth it. Nice employees here - especially compared to the Rancho Cucamonga location."
Lauren H.,"Riverside, CA",0,52,,1.0,6/14/2014,"Visited for a quick lunch.  Could not find anything for $5.99 like they advertise. Both my husband and I had the soup, 1/2 sandwich.  $7.95 Not worth it!  My husband had the turkey which was nothing more than store bought deli slice. Bread fell apart when he tried to pick up and eat it. No complaints on the salad. I had the California chicken sandwich with chicken noodle soup.  Soup was delicious.  Did not care for the chilis on sandwich and scraped them off.  Kept the nice avocado slice ....and my bread also fell apart making both sandwiches messy.  We had the choice of fries with meal.  Thin, crispy and unfortunately greasy. Service was good. Ordered 2 beers which came in bottle at $4.50 each.  Way too much money!! For what we had it cost over $26.00 and we ended up throwing 1/2 away. Don't think well be back...sorry!"
Sheldon L.,"Riverside, CA",93,121,18,3.0,5/17/2015,Food was okay.  Service on the other hand was less than good. The reviews on yelp  are pretty much spot on.
Julie H.,"Corona, CA",4,20,15,1.0,2/24/2015,Went to bj tonight for dinner and I asked Steven t our server for the Tuscan tomato soup and asked if I could get the ham and grilled cheese sandwich with it he told me he would check my soup came with no sandwich which Stephen never came back to tell me when he did come to the table I asked him so I guess u couldn't get the sandwich he's respond was it's not on the menu did u want me to get it for u I was thinking no I just asked u for my health I told him I guess not his response to me was I just work here I guess someone needs to tell Stephen t is on the off menu Stephen t needs to be retrained on service to his customers and it's like he was afraid to ask about the sandwich I inquired about u know asking if free I was pleased with my service tonight very disappointed
Geo A.,"Santa Ana, CA",214,32,13,4.0,2/27/2014,Came for an early lunch. Got the soup and salad unlimited meal plus the lemon thyme chicken. YUMMY. Food came out very quickly and fresh. I love the presentation of the chicken tortilla soup poured at the table. Awesome. The lemon thyme chicken is very flavorful!! Not heavy and perfect lunch portion. Definitely would get that again.
Sheryl T.,"Anaheim, CA",67,1,,1.0,11/30/2013,"Food is ok, service is terrible. My son's glass mug literally broke in half as he lifted it to take a drink.  Not only was our table covered in root beer, but my son's legs and shorts were drenched, as well.  When the dinning room manager Dyana Duran was made aware of the incident, she informed us that, ""it happens,"" and to send them the dry cleaning bill.  No apology for the faulty glassware and no concern for my son's welfare, we were lucky to get his kids meal comped. Now I understand why the restaurant was half empty on a Saturday during lunch.  Hopefully, she receives some customer service training soon."
Anna-Marie T.,"Santa Ana, CA",321,356,846,1.0,12/22/2014,"I came here with my family (party of 7) on December 20, 2014 at 6:30pm-8pm to celebrate a couple of birthdays and had a terrible experience. For starters, we ordered appetizers for the table to share and we were about half way through when we were FINALLY brought individual plates which were DIRTY. The plates had leftover food (some sort of mayo sauce) all over them. It took a couple of minutes to flag down the manager and even longer for them to bring out clean plates. The next incident occurred when our meals were brought out. One of our family members received the wrong order and had to sit and watch everyone else eat while he waited for his food. When his food finally did come out it was brought out in pieces. He was first brought his steak, then his soup and then his scallops. This was totally unacceptable. Our server made several excuses for her error saying that she couldn't read her hand writing  because she was writing too fast, that no one had ever ordered this particular menu item before and that she was brain dead because she just took a history final. The final straw came when the check was handed to us. Upon review we found that we were charged for an additional drink (one that they had told us they had run out of no less). Honestly, this was just a very disappointing experience. Dining out is a treat and BJ's servers and manager did not seem to recognize this. I don't demand perfection when it comes to service but act like you care and take pride in your job and be accountable. Please hire better people."
Joe M.,"Keeler, CA",0,84,40,3.0,5/5/2015,Checked out BJ's on Sat after AVENGERS movie. Gr8 service and the verde carnitas fries were good. Had the jalapeño burger with fries and was not disappointed!
Dawn S.,"Dodgertown, CA",1,81,18,1.0,1/15/2015,"I will never eat here again. I have eaten here over 10 times hoping that it will get better and it keeps just getting worse. The service is terrible and slow. They always get my order wrong or a part of our order will never come, either it be my appetizer, salad or a meal. They always blame the cooks. The quality of food has gone down hill tremendously in the past few years. Its actually gross. I wouldn't eat here if it was the last place to eat in Corona. Ill just go buy a Frozen pizza at Albertsons and it will taste better and i don't have to worry about the crappy service."
Sofia S.,"Corona, CA",0,12,,5.0,5/15/2016,This place is great. Food is great and service is awesome. My server Ann took care of me today. Great job
Ruby L.,"Corona, CA",7,18,7,2.0,5/4/2015,"Kind of hard to rate them two stars when my husband and I eat here often. The last few times were just okay and this last time, on May 1, was absolutely the worst. My family decided to order in and since we are a somewhat big group we decided to try their family carry out meals. We ordered the portion size suitable for for 4-6 people. Decided to get the two large pizzas, the Santa Fe salad, mashed potatoes and potato wedges. We also added an order of mozzarella sticks since we love them so much.  We picked everything up and took the 5 min drive home, literally 2 exits away. We set up the table and sit down to eat. Try and get a slice of pizza and notice that it cold..... On top of that it was cut horribly and the crust was not crunchy but seemingly undercooked. It doesn't stop there. There was no sauce.... Very dry. We received ONE SCOOP of mashed potatoes for 6 people? A small one person serving of wedges... Really? And my favorite mozzarella sticks were smushed and cold..... I called in after trying to eat the meal and instead of telling me they would remake the meal I was told i would get a call back. After the food basically went into the trash...$70 worth of food. The manager finally calls me back to apologize and tell me they would give me a $20 voucher to come back. I asked if they could return some money to the card and she said they had already closed the tab and couldn't do it... So in a nutshell, I am very disappointed and will not be returning. I will make sure to tell my friends and family to do the same. This review will also go to corporate and on social media."
Alexis P.,"Corona, CA",266,15,5,2.0,3/18/2016,"Waiter was terrible. Waited 15 minutes for drinks at 10:30 at night, they were not busy at all. Had to ask multiple times for the same things. Friends met us and the table was full of empty plates, I asked the waiter if he could please bus the table after twenty minutes I got up and moved everything to the table next to us and he had seen that and walked past it three times with nothing in his hands (could have taken the plates himself) A bus boy came by and he said ""bro can you get those""! I couldn't believe it, so lazy! I get it if you're busy and need some help but, he could have easily have done it. The bus boys are busy enough! Work for your tip a little! When the bill came I asked for him to use my points from my rewards never did, asked again and be applied it and told me how much I had, I asked for a print out to see what my points could be used for came back with the paper with just the points, I asked AGAIN what my points could be used for, and he told me off his ""memory"" I could have $10 off. Seemed to me he just wanted the bill to be high so his tip could be more.  Spoke to the manager and to my surprise he didn't seem like he really cared himself, didn't even ask if there was anything he could do!  Food was great but, we will defiantly not be returning after tonight's experience! Doesn't matter how good the food is if the service sucks it's not enjoyable. Been coming her for years and never had issues until tonight. Very disappointed!"
Sarah M.,"Corona, CA",0,2,,1.0,7/3/2015,"**Forced to give this place one star because Yelp won't allow me to give ZERO!**  This is my neighborhood BJ's that I've been going to for years. I'll admit the past year or so the service has gone down tremendously so I barely go. Tonight I remembered why I stopped coming.  My friend and I went for dinner. I ordered a mini cheese pizza and she ordered Cajun pasta. My pizza came with pepperoni, which I don't eat. I had to have it sent back and remade. While we waited for our food, we had to literally ask 3 servers to give us utensils which is ridiculous! It should not take 3 servers to give us a fork. We remained patient while already being extremely irritated and restless waiting for the correct food to arrive. While we waited, my friend asked for red peppers from a waiter. The waiter didn't seem to concerned to serve us because she started chit chatting with other waiters and servers for a few minutes before coming back with the peppers.  The waiter that finally brought us our utensils had the manager come to our table so we could address our issues. The manager apologized for the poor service but didn't seem to care about what we had to say. He seemed more annoyed that we were rightfully complaining.  The correct pizza finally came, which took much longer than necessary. I overheard the table next to me complain and show frustration about how long it was taking to receive their food. Anyhow,  my friend took a bite into her pasta and it was UNCOOKED!! LITERALLY UNCOOKED PASTA!!! UNBELIEVABLE!  Clearly we finally had enough and told the waiter. He wanted to bring the manager to us but we said not to worry about it because we don't care to be there another moment longer and aren't paying for such horrible food and service. We walked out.  I will no longer be visiting this location and will make a point to tell all my friends and family not to visit either. I'm not one to write negative reviews but tonight was a disappointment and insulting and I feel others should be warned before they go to waste their time."
R.T. M.,"Corona, CA",0,27,16,3.0,7/2/2015,"I received feedback in my post, so after speaking with BJ'S hey seen genuinely apologetic on the poor service my family and I received, so my family and I plan on giving them one more chance."
Shay R.,"Costa Mesa, CA",164,4,,2.0,5/18/2015,"Went here last night for dinner and pazookies. The service was not good our server took 15 minutes to greet our table and kept checking back in with her other tables. Finally came back to get our drink orders took her another 15 minutes to get our food order. I ordered gourmet Mac & cheese which is my fav here! There was no cheese on my noodles. All the waiter offered was a ""side of cheese"" not sure what I would do with that. But didn't offer to remake it. I was very disappointed. This is the second time Bjs service was not good. :("
