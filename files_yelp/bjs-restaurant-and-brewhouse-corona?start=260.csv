Lucas P.,"Riverside, CA",63,32,43,4.0,6/20/2013,Friendly staff and great food. Love the BBQ Chicken Pizza and the Pizooke! Avocado Rolls are awesome too! Came here last night and had a great time. We got a table right away. Service was awesome and everything very tasty. My 4 star reflect a little lack on consistency. I wish our previous visits were like last nights. But they are improving and I do recognize that! Keep it up!
JJ S.,"La Quinta, CA",19,126,23,4.0,8/31/2013,"What a nice surprise! For a big chain and a VERY busy place, I was SO impressed by the service! We didn't have reservations but we were sit in less than 5 minutes. Our waitress was super professional: she asked for drinks and suggested different beverages, she knew the menu super well, gave us enough time in between courses to checked on us. The manager came and asked about our experience and was super friendly in a proper way.  I was super impressed by that. Food is ok for my taste. Great example of how the employes and service can make a huge difference in a restaurant!"
Shane R.,"Irvine, CA",37,56,3,4.0,6/7/2013,"This place needs an explanation for the stars.   The food is a 4 because everything I have ever had, from Pizza to Clam Chowder is kick a$$.  Not a game changer, but really good and consistent.   The service is 2 stars because it's horrible.  One time we left after waiting 15 minutes to be greeted by a server.  It's like the manager is sleeping, doesn't care about service, or doesn't know any better. That brings me to a 3 star average, but something changed last night.  We had a server named Leo who was the best thing that has happened to this location since it opened.  Maybe it's under new management or maybe they just got lucky with this guy, but if we go back, we'll wait to be seated in his section.  My 10 year old daughter wanted to find the manager and tell him/her to give Leo a promotion.  So for your regulars who deal with crappy service because a Pizookie is calling your name, don't fret.  Look for a dude with a big brown curly mane that resembles a Leo and you'll be set. BJs.  Pay attention.  Your food is good.  All you need are more people like Leo and you'll blow up."
Mike C.,"Corona, CA",51,19,,1.0,3/4/2016,A total sh@t hole. You'd be a fool to eat here. Either that or you wouldn't know a good meal if it jumped up and slapped you in the tastebuds.
Mike V.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",7,13,,4.0,7/8/2013,"Notice the people complaining are the type that have only been once. People are often FAR too critical of this and unforgiving. And one is the type that would rather eat McDonalds...  I go here often and get great service. I understand the reality of this world as I have dated servers in the past. large parties are tough no matter if it's busy or not and expecting a perfectly filled drink every time it empties is a little ridiculous.  The management has corrected any issue I have had, all have been small. People need to get a life and stop being so mean. Th proof is the fact that all the regulars love the joint, so they must be doing something right huh?"
Alex G.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,4,2,4.0,8/24/2014,"Good environment, good food.... Just don't eat outside during the afternoon.... I'm cooking as I type this out."
Ronald P.,"Riverside, CA",1,15,,2.0,6/26/2013,"I've eaten here about 6 times. I like the food, I like the Pizza, and I enjoy most of what is on the menu. My main complaint is the service. Quite honestly, the service sucks. The waiters and waitresses try to rush you out, and most of the time they don't check on you or come to your table. There have been several instances where they make themselves scarce. Now I like the food, and especially the pizookie, but out of the 6 times I have been here, only once have I had a waiter worth the tip I gave (I usually tip 30%), so the last time I went I lowered the tip to 20% and left a note complaining about the service. I haven't been there since, there are food places nearby with food that tastes just as good, but I don't rate a restaurant based only for the food, it's really about the service and ambiance, otherwise I might as well just get take out. BJ's really needs to up their service if I'm going back there."
Julissa N.,"Riverside, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/28/2015,This was the worst experience I had at lunch time. They brought a 1.5x 1.5 inch salmon on a plate. Ridiculous!! In addition the server was so rude!!!
BreeAnn M.,"Santa Ana, CA",91,27,13,2.0,7/11/2015,"The food at this BJs is always great. When I visit my friend in Corona we usually go to this BJ's as ""tradition."" However today's service was a little disappointing. I'm not sure if our waitress was new or maybe overwhelmed? Whatever the case, never asked if we wanted a refill, never came to check on us, barely smiled. We just wanted to get out but even getting the check took forever and it wasn't busy. Luckily the fries were perfect and my California Chicken Club was made perfectly. My girlfriend's burger was sloppily made though, she didn't even finish half of it. Stick to pizza when you go here."
Julian P.,"Corona, CA",16,13,7,4.0,5/11/2014,Great place if you're in the mood for pizza. Ordered the buffalo wings and was given a small portion for the $10 price. The food is a bit expensive for what they give you but the quality is high. I give it a 4/5 if you're willing to spend a bit more. The restaurant is also poorly lit making it harder to see inside.
Marcus G.,"Corona, CA",6,16,5,4.0,6/24/2015,"BJ's almost never let's us down. My wife and I recently went in and had an appetizer,  drinks, and a meal  plus the movie tickets combo with the Corona Crossings theater and the whole thing cost less than $40. It is unfortunate that people typically only give negative reviews. Life is good and so is a good lunch and decent movie. Just Enjoy."
Pricilla K.,"Riverside, CA",34,33,14,5.0,12/23/2014,Love the calamari and the giant deep dish pizza! Yummmmmm
Soccer D.,"Corona, CA",0,60,,5.0,2/12/2016,Awesome lunch!  I got the Soup and Salad combo with Chx tortilla.  One of the best I ever had.  Unlimited both for $8.  I had 2 salads and 3 bowls of soup.  My wife had an artichoke pizza and loved it.  We had a 2 for 1 coupon and paid $12 for the whole lunch with great service.  Sarah C was our server so kudos to her.
Sterling L.,"Murrieta, CA",0,4,,1.0,2/2/2013,"So me and 2 friends went in at 8pm and they closed at 10pm. It was super empty but for some reason we weren't aloud to have a booth. So we sat down and no waiter came by for like 10mins so we sat and talked. Two separate groups got seated(at booths) and received drinks before anyone even came to our table!! So I got up and asked the front if we could get a waiter. So a waitress came by and said she would take our drink order ever tho ""we weren't in her area."" We told her we were ready to order as well. So we got our drinks and kept talking. At some point I looked at my phone. It was 9:10 and we still hadn't got our food or appetizer. We had been sitting there since 8 and there were probably 10 people in the whole restaurant! Done.... We left a $10 bill for our 3 sodas and left for McDonalds.  Btw it was dinner for my bday, thanks BJ's! :D"
Leslie D.,"Corona, CA",0,1,,4.0,3/25/2016,"The servers are always great when I come in, and I always have a great time.  I know people complain about waiting, but I'd never complain about waiting for a table at a restaurant at night, that's normal to me! The only suggestion I'd have for improvement is talking to their hostesses, sometimes the curly haired blonde could be a little more welcoming :)"
Adrian D.,"Corona, CA",78,3,1,5.0,10/9/2014,"Came here for a dinner date with my wife. We were seated instantly and out server Michael was just the best. Recommended me the new pumpkin spice beer, and he was extremely understanding and courteous when we had to return our first pizza for a different one because of my wife's food sensitivity. Just the best date we have had here before."
Loren R.,"Long Beach, CA",0,15,6,5.0,4/8/2015,BJ's in Corona - best pork chops ever!  Love the beef dip.  Even the enlightened tacos were great.  Service was spot on and speedy as always.
Chris R.,"San Bernardino, CA",3,14,6,1.0,3/20/2015,"Let me start by saying, I LOVE the BJ's by my in laws in San Diego and the one in San Bernardino. However, this one is one of the worst run restaurants I've seen. I'll just dive in. We visited this BJ's onThursday March 19th shortly after noon. I suggested going here to meet my grandmother and was embarrassed when she bit down on a lettuce core that was two inches in diameter. My tacos were bland like most the food we had on this visit. I got the grain salad I love with the chicken tacos, which is normally full of corn and really flavorful. In this case it was a single boiled grain with no dressing, no corn, no anything else.  All of this can be chalked up to being only human, mistakes happen, etc. I really understand these kinds of mistakes, though with proper expectations, standards and enforcement they can be avoided.  My real issue is this, and I hope management is listening. We were there another 30 minutes and even though I made eye contact with the manager the mistakes were brought to, at no point did any manager or supervisor make any effort to apologize or to offer me a replacement. I didn't need or ask for any discount even though I didn't eat half my meal, but a 30 second acknowledgement or something would have avoided this review and my not going to the restaurant again. Whoever is in charge needs to wake up as you are Not adhering to or enforcing corporate standards."
Dano P.,"Riverside, CA",28,17,8,4.0,3/16/2014,"Great service, waiter was on it!!!!!....food is grade A......the beer is what makes it!.......and the pazzzzooooookkkkkiiiiiiiii!!!!...... Great joint to visit!"
Anthony N.,"Playa del Rey, CA",4974,2735,19385,2.0,10/20/2012,"***I don't think BJ's is the greatest chain, but I thought this one was a little below average compared to the Torrance location*** BJ's is similar to T.G.I. Friday's and Chili's in terms of its family chain sit-down restaurant approach, prices and menu, which features several cuisines.  There are a few differences though.  BJ's has a heavy focus on deep dish pizza though it is definitely far from what you would also get in Chicago.  There is also a heavy focus on the brewery, which even features housemade sodas like cream soda and root beer.  Finally, it also seems more sports bar oriented with huge flat screen TVs sitting over the bar. I've only been to one BJ's in Torrance.  The food there is okay--kind of depends on what you order.  Service tends to be good there.  Sometimes, service is a little off or slow, but the management is always ready to make things right (even being very aware of when customers are receiving slow service and doing what they can to fix it). We had the Thai shrimp lettuce wraps, which were garnished with napa cabbage, red onion, carrots, cilantro, and mango salsa.  These were just okay at best.  The shrimp was not that good. I went with the Maui glazed pork chop, which consisted of a pork chop with a sweet glaze, oven roasted red potatoes, green beans, and grilled sweet red onions.  I've had this pork chop at the Torrance location a few times and it definitely trumps this one in Corona.  The pork chop here was not too bad; it was a little dry, but it was okay overall. The sides were not that good.  The green beans were limp, bland and lifeless.  The red onions did not have a good crispiness or char to them.  The oven roasted red potatoes were really bad.  They were underseasoned, but worse was that they had that squishy taste and texture of oven roasted potatoes you would get from a Lean Cuisine meal or something. Service was not that good either.  While the staff was pleasant and polite, they were not that attentive.  Also, it took a little too long for the food to come out. Prices were similar to what you would find at most family chain restaurants.  They do offer reasonable weekday lunch specials. BJ's is not my favorite chain, but this is a weak location.  The food was not that great (same could be said for the service).  There are a lot of chains in this area so my suggestion would be to seek out other nearby places before settling on BJ's. This BJ's is located in a huge retail plaza, which has its own free and huge parking lot; it is easy finding an open space."
