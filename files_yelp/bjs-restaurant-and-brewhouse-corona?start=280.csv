Lupita A.,"Riverside, CA",3,19,21,4.0,10/12/2013,"General Manager Chris is fabulous. She made us feel welcomed & made up for the little mishap in the front with the hostess! Thank you Chris :)  Over all, the food & service was great...."
Tony C.,"Corona, CA",0,5,,2.0,3/29/2015,"I wasn't quite sure how to rate this, overall the experience wasnt great. Was not satisfied with our service (from our server KATHRYN).  My wife And I came in for dinner And ordered our food along with a beer from the bar. That was basically the only time our server actually came to us at our table. At one point my wife was wanting something and I  was looking to order another beer but couldnt figure out where our server went. Another server in our area (Christina) noticed us looking around and came to see if she could help us. She quickly retreived what my wife was wanting, and then our server showed up with my beer that Christina let her know I  was wanting another of. And then Kathryn dissappeared again. There was multiple times that Christina would come by and check on us and give us a hand.  My wife and I  greatly appreciated Christina for her above and beyond helpfulness as she was not our assigned server, And had tables of her own to attend. I did speak to a manager (Shawn) And felt like that went absolutely nowhere as well.  I made him aware of our server, And also let him know about the great service that Christina gave us, she served us more than our own waitress. I don't know what the problem was, maybe Kathryn had too many tables to take care of..but that is when ""teamwork"" comes in to play, And that is exactly what Christina did for us. Thank you.."
Sara K.,"Arcadia, CA",0,5,,1.0,3/21/2014,My brother and I came in on a wed. night (3/5) we were greeted when we walked in and said we wanted to sit in the bar. We were told we could sit ourselves and we sat in a booth right in the middle of the row of booths in the bar. We sat and waited ....waited ...and waited ...NO ONE said a word to us. waitress walked right by 5 or 6 times but ignored me when i tried to get her attention. I decided to wait and see how long it took to get some sort of service or acknowledgement ......but after 25 min. I was hungry and thought FORGET IT!! so we go up and left a  (went to Kings Fish House ...it was very nice and fast friendly service.)
Vanessa E.,"Riverside, CA",3,43,28,1.0,1/13/2013,"I have always hear people say bad things about BJs but as a true lover of the place, its food and drinks, I have always tried to bring people back. One of these times was this passed December for my Fiancee birthday. We called in early to the Corona location, just to see if the wait would be long, and they said that for a party of 14 that there would be a 10min wait. Sure enough the wait wasn't long, so they weren't all that busy. That was the only good service we got that night.  Our first waitress got 2 of our drinks wrong, when our second waitress got there she rolled her eyes when I told her about the mistakes. Then she questioned my drink order and didn't look too happy when I pointed to the menu and showed her that I did pronounce the drink correctly. It took forever to get the new drinks, took forever to put our order in, some of the food was cold when it got to the table and some of the plates were wrong. We were so hungry by the time we got our food, that we just ate  what we got. The place wasn't even that busy so I don't know what was taking up so much of our waitress' time. All I know is that we got sorry service, and she got her gratitude of 18% from the check, which was over $50.  Just making a trip out to Moreno Valley location from now on."
Sharon S.,"Corona, CA",4,11,1,3.0,11/13/2015,"I don't know why but it seems like every time my boyfriend and I come here on a date, we always get crappy service. 1st time: On Valentine's Day, we went for dinner, after waiting in our table for about 45 mins-1 hour, the waitress comes to tell us that the kitchen never made our food. She asked if we could wait 10 more minutes and they would have it out for us. They apologize and bring us salads while we wait and even dessert after our meal, everything turned out to be on the house. 2nd time: My boyfriend and I go for Sunday lunch to get clam chowder in the sourdough bread bowl, well by the time my boyfriend had reached the bottom of the bowl, he realized it had mold. The manager apologized and paid for our meals and gave us a $25 gift card. 3rd time (tonight): we ordered a pizza and our waiter didn't bother bringing the pizza stand or plates so the girl who brought the pizza realized we didn't have utensils so she had to carry the pizza back and forth with her so she could grab a pizza stand and plates. Then we told the waiter they didn't put mushrooms or olives on the pizza, so he brings out refrigerated mushrooms and olives on a plate. Who the hell wants cold mushrooms and olives on their pizza?! Management is really nice and good with making up for any issues but the service really SUCKS! We've gone with groups of people and usually everything goes smoothly, so I'm guessing they just don't care when it's 2 people."
Melanie O.,"Glendale, CA",340,661,63,5.0,10/1/2012,"Is this place new?  Feels new.  Substantially smaller than other BJ's we've been to, but fresh & clean. Our server, David, was excellent from beginning to end.  Super polite and helpful, think I ended up tipping him 30% because he was so attentive and overall awesome. Parking is easy, great specials (that we found through Yelp!) and fast food & service."
Brian H.,"San Francisco, CA",54,130,24,1.0,11/28/2012,"Woah.  Not what I expected.   From first impression, this place looks great.  It's clean, spacious, and has friendly wait staff.  The menu even looks good... but the actual food was shocking. Four things were ordered- A black and bleu burger, a personal pizza, a bowl of soup, and the special which was fried chicken, mashed potatoes, etc. None of the food looked fresh.  The soup was looked gelatinous and had obviously been reheated recently (and not thoroughly), the pizza looked like one of those microwave dollar pizzas you can get at cheap food stores, the blue cheese on the burger was cold and shaped like a compressed patty, and the special... the fried chicken was soft instead of crispy, and the mashed potatoes were stiff and hard as if they had been made weeks ago. I personally had the burger, which didn't taste horrible (just looked very unappealing), but both of my companions said their food was as awful as it looked. Not really what  I was expecting from a place that looks like this.  I really am shocked and surprised."
Shawn Z.,"Corona, CA",273,25,5,4.0,9/16/2014,"We went here for the first time last night for my sons 12th birthday dinner.  We were seated quicker than the approximate wait time.  The server was nice , understanding  and got our complex order right without a beat. The Avocado roll appetizer is fantastic!"
Kristen O.,"Palm Springs, CA",2,1,,1.0,1/6/2015,"Terrible service,  only got helped once- good was not cooked all the way, like warm when it came out."
Mikhal G.,"Corona, CA",20,4,,1.0,4/10/2014,Well it's sad to say that I will no longer be dining at this establishment. Never have I been so disgusted with what I experienced tonite. Lately the appetizers or salad have been showing up literally a minute before your main dish comes out and this has actually been consistently happening the past few times I have visited this place. Tonite was no different in the sense of the salad coming right before my main plate but to top it all off there ended up being a used bandaid in the salad! I immediately lost my appetite and new I would never be coming back here! The service I could have put up with but finding that in my food doesn't go over well! Just make sure you check your food next time you decide to dine here
Juan S.,"Riverside, CA",1,5,,1.0,8/1/2014,Don't take any large parties there.  They don't know how to accommodate them and don't want the business apparently.  About 20 + people from work went to celebrate a coworker's new job and we got kicked out by the manager of the restaurant because we were too many people at the bar and we were supposedly a safety hazard.  Unfortunately this wasn't the first time we had a problem at BJ's because of this.  A couple of months before this incident we had another going away party at BJ's and the manager was rude and obnoxious with a really bad attitude.  We spent well over a $2000.00 + on drinks alone.  Where I come from you make space for a big party and treat them with respect.
Heather H.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",21,6,,4.0,2/20/2015,"Positives * Brooke H. The best server EVER!!!! She was very engaging to both myself & my daughter. She made the experience wonderful.  * Mediterranean chicken tacos with ""grains""  AMAZING!!! ""Grains"" were the best part though * sat outside & it was very warm Negatives**** **way too long of a wait **hostess should've suggested outside seating. Was asked after 15 mins of waiting. ** restrooms were a little dirty with overflowing trash bins"
Valerie R.,"Corona, CA",17,64,4,4.0,10/15/2014,We love our bartender Crystal! !!! Food was good. .very helpful with order! ! Made us so comfortable. Went for bday dinner. .
Andrea M.,"San Diego, CA",5,3,,2.0,11/8/2015,"I really truly do love Bjs and am a constant customer there. I live in San Diego so usually go to the ones down there; however, my mom lives in corona so today we decided to do take out from BJs from this location. We ordered our food online and then proceeded to pick it up. When I got there the lady was very nice.  She read me back my order and said she'd be right back with it.  We sat waiting for 20 minutes for the food to take home.  And I thought oh it's still cooking so that must've been why it was taking so long.  She handed me the bags.  Forgot our drinks.  Then I get home, open the bags... Come to find cold food, incorrect orders, and honestly I was really disappointed.  I got a chicken pesto sandwich. It was cold. Not toasted bread ( also very soggy) and probably had an ounce of chicken and the rest was pure bread. The fries tasted four days old and were cold. I could keep going on about everyone else's food but I'd rather not. I was just really disappointed because bjs has always been one of my favorite restaurants."
Myles R.,"Corona, CA",0,4,2,1.0,6/30/2016,"BJ's has always been one of my favorite restaurants to visit, usually guaranteed great service and great food. Unfortunately, my last visit was one of the absolute worst experience I've ever had in my entire life. When it comes to going out to restaurants, I totally understand all that goes on, due to my previous experience as a server, but our servers attitude was inexcusable. I was out to eat with a few friends of mine and our server, Ryan, came to greet us. Immediately he had an attitude asking us what we wanted to drink. We specifically asked for 2 Nojitos (Mojitos without the alcohol) and proceeded to bring them out to the table. We asked for Nojitos because we are underage and cannot drink along with the fact we were both driving ourselves. My friend thought her Nojito tasted strange, so she didn't drink any of it and waited for Ryan to come back so she could very politely return the drink. Ryan was not attentive at all and the few times he would come to check on us, he was very rude. Ryan came to drop off the check and as we went to pay our bill, we saw that we had been charged with alcoholic Mojitos. When my friend asked Ryan to remove the drink from her tab, he yelled at her telling her that she needs to speak louder in a restaurant that has music playing and to say a non-alcoholic Mojito instead of Nojito. I have never felt so disrespected as a loyal, paying guest in a  restaurant. The first mistake on his part was not asking us for our ID's to verify our age, which had that been done there would have been no confusion to begin with. He served alcohol to minors and was in the wrong, putting the blame on his guest. He was very rude and I will not be coming back to visit his location again."
Robyn M.,"Corona, CA",3,8,1,1.0,6/10/2014,"We decided to try the Party PAC catering ..... Ordered my food on the phone 5 days early. The day before our party I called to confirm the order, well no order so not sure where my order and credit card info went. The  manager who made me feel like I was really wasting his time not once apologized for their error in losing my large $$$ order but instead told me to call back tomorrow and order it the day I needed  it!!    I said I'm not calling back if you don't have time  to take my order I can order my food somewhere else $240 of food mind u! He found someone to take my order after a 15 minute hold time Sarah was a great help and did apologize for their mistake. Food was ok just ok My order wasn't complete and was minus 30 chicken wings!!!!!!!! Stopped going in this place a long time ago due to service but thought this was a no brainier  guess not"
Angela P.,"Corona, CA",12,13,5,2.0,8/30/2014,"Came on a Saturday night. They were OUT OF ROOT BEER.  Strike one. Half our table didn't get a drink for 10-15 minutes,  not to mention it took the waiter that long to take our order.  Strike two. They forgot the cheese on my daughter's cheeseburger.  Strike 3.  I used to LOVE  their open faced pot roast sandwich, which is no longer a menu item.  I will not be returning."
Aaron S.,"Murrieta, CA",457,323,8,3.0,2/13/2013,"Almost identical to the BJ's I frequent in Mo-Val. I only went here for a trio of pizzookies with my lady and our mutual friend, so can't really say much besides that (but you would probably know what to expect judging by how other BJ's are, they don't change much!) Well.. the pizzookies were overcooked, all of them. Still REALLY good (maybe enhanced by all of us being a little buzzy?) but still..overcooked. So much so that at the edges of the pan were just cement cookie plots. Not bad by any means though!"
Ciara O.,"La Habra, CA",143,78,93,3.0,2/18/2014,"I love BJs and have came to this quite a bit since I live here in corona.  Never had a problem until tonight.  My boyfriend, friend and her boyfriend came in at 11 after we got off work. (Mind you, 3 out of 4 of us are servers) the bar had some people. Right off the bat our server L*** B. made us feel unwelcome. She was so rude! I've been a waitress for almost 9 years so I know when someone is having a rough day and just wants to go home, but we didn't walk in 10 minutes before closing. We came in an hour before. She was attentive and did check on us but it was her attitude! She never said anything and when she did it was almost like an irritated tone. We literally checked what time bjs closed because she was treating us as if we walked in as they were on their way to lock the doors.  Every time we said thank you if she was dropping things off... nothIng. Not a word!  It was like I was talking to a brick wall!! When my boyfriend and I's pazooki was dropped off their was only one spoon so I said ""sharing with one spoon"" to him as she walked away, few minutes later she walked by us and set a spoon down on the plate and kept walking, and again, not a word.  Apparently I'm not the only one with servers attitude problems on here. I'm only giving 3 stars for their excellent food and usually top notch service. Even if I receive horrible service I still leave good tips because as a server I know, sometimes you get behind, or sometimes you get a random rush and try your best. But it wasn't the service that was the problem it was her attitude"
