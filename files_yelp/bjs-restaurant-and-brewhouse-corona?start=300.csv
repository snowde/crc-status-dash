Tim D.,"Menifee, CA",97,94,55,3.0,4/11/2014,I always drive through this area of town on my way to work. Stopped here last night for a drink and a bite to eat. I had a bacon cheeseburger which was tasty but not something to write home about. The fries were great. I'm not much of a connoisseur of beer so I just had a Newcastle to drink. The service from my waitress was ok.
Susan M.,"Corona, CA",127,294,96,4.0,5/26/2012,"We have been to this BJs many times and always had a good experience. 3.5 stars would be just right if I could give that. I almost always order the Sweet Pig mini pizza, which is so good! The perfect mix of cheese, sweet pineapple and salty Canadian bacon. I always ask for a side of ranch for dipping. A few times I ordered a loaded baked potato (butter, sour cream, cheddar cheese and bacon) which I really like also. The potatoes are HUGE!! Just one is a full meal! I have tried some of their beers, which are all good. But I actually prefer their freshly made root beer served in a cold, frosty mug - yummy! Tonight I opted for a change and got the bacon cheeseburger. It came with cheddar cheese, crispy bacon, lettuce, and dill pickles. I opted for mayo instead of the special sauce which had a little kick to it which I did not like. It was a decent burger, but it was dry and lacked the juice I like it a good burger. I got the wedge fries with it, which I think are better than the shoestring fries. My husband also had the burger and agreed that it was a little dry.  This burger and an okay brunch that I have also tried lower the stars for me. It would be a 5 based on just the pizza and root beer! We had great service from Katherine. She was very attentive and we did not have to wait to long for our meal. (And it was a Saturday night!) We have never had a problem with good service in either the bar or restaurant. We did not have a pizookie tonight, but have tried several in the past. Our favorite is the white chocolate macadamia nut! I also like the Ghiradelli chocolate one. They are so tasty! We will be going back, but next time I will order the Sweet Pig!"
Vivian H.,"Corona, CA",317,169,472,5.0,1/3/2013,"This is still 1 of my fave local bars in the area. Stopped by here to catch some football on a Sunday after a disappointing experience @ Buffalo Wild Wings & I'm glad we did. Food, service, & drinks are always good. We were in a drinking mood so we ordered a few snakebites (Guinness over cider) & chopped it up while watching the games. I always have a good time & positive experiences @ this location. Can't wait to come back again."
Elisa D.,"Corona, CA",1,36,9,4.0,7/23/2014,"I would venture to say, we have been here A LOT. Some experiences were horrible,  but tonight was awesome! Yey! Great service and food was amazing. I hope this keeps up. New manager??"
Tiffany S.,"Corona, CA",192,64,15,3.0,5/20/2014,Open late which was good . But even with hardly any people in there service is SLOW . Average food . Happy hour had good prices . All in all just Ok .
Christine R.,"Murrieta, CA",1,4,1,1.0,9/20/2015,Horrible service. I asked two different servers to please bring ranch for my salad. Neither one of them came back. We got 2 different servers our table was cluttered and as we finished our dishes the server wouldn't even take our finished plates. I will never come to this Bjs.
Daydreamer d.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",46,9,18,3.0,11/8/2012,"You can't go wrong with their artichoke & spinach dip, it never disappoints, nor does their sweet pig pizza or oreo pizookie for that matter. In years past they would give you a full size pizookie if it was your birthday, now you get a smaller individual sized one.  Great place to take the family on days when you just don't feel like cooking..."
ßenjämin Ä.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,193,54,1.0,4/25/2012,"What a Fail. After being convinced to go there for my birthday dinner I see 8 of my friends eating and in my spot sits an empty spot because my server forgot my order. Not sure why they insisted on bringing me my meal after everyone was done eating. No need to worry though, my baked potato was comped for the mistake! This was hands down the most pathetic restaurant experience of all time! Special thanks to BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse for providing me with a horrible (or lack of) birthday dinner and then making me pay for it."
Cynthia W.,"Downey, CA",66,122,52,4.0,8/29/2010,"My husband and I went to this location with friends, after a long day at the zoo. We didn't have any complaints; besides the dressing on the house salads were awful. The buffalo pizza is always superb!! The strawberry lemonade is on the sweet side but with a little water added it's good. Last but surely not the least, the pizookie deserves it's own blog!! We had the Oreo pizookie for my husbands bday, and I have to admit I ate most of it :o) I'm sure he didn't mind"
Amir G.,"Corona, CA",324,31,1,5.0,6/25/2014,"I usually order takeout once a week, and dine in occasionally as well. Always great!"
Victor M.,"Corona, CA",6,4,,1.0,6/13/2014,One of the worst service I've had at a bjs been coming to this location for 4 yrs never had a problem with ordering drinks from the bar for happy hour until the new manager Sean said we can't order from the bar but we can't get happy hour at our table when the old manager Amy lets us do it with out a problem. If anyone trying to go out with a group of friends for happy hour go somewhere like buffalo wild wing or Friday's because they will happily accommodate you. The bartenders were cool but the manager made up some rules that bjs never had. They basically kick out a party of 20 that was going to spend $500 easy
K Z.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",0,18,,2.0,1/12/2014,"I am not sure why but this place always seems to be busy for dinner. My family and I ate here one Sunday and were surprised how long we had to wait. In any case we ordered a cheesy dip as an appetizer and it was very very greasy. Although cheese is fattening as a whole, the chips served were also greasy. Later on in the night we all complained of a stomach ache and the appetizer was the only thing we all ate. I ordered a gluten free pizza which I could barely eat. It did not taste good. It was more like cardboard and some cheese and sauce. The server was clearly not interested in our table and had to be flagged several times. The prices are slightly high for what you get. We'll pass on this place next time."
Carla Lee H.,"Lakewood, CA",359,442,231,4.0,8/14/2012,"Good food, good ambiance, although the service is somewhat lacking. We had to wait for silverware when our lunch came out. After we were done, they cleared away the silverware, but when we got dessert, we had to ask two people before we actually got more spoons.  Not sure if it was just our server or if they were extremely busy that day. However, the food is good enough that I would be willing to come back to find out! (: mmmm....pizookies....."
Chacon L.,"Riverside, CA",4,256,7,5.0,5/11/2014,Always a good choice. Food is always good and consistent. the nutty brewnette is the beer of choice. Service is always friendly. The restaurant is always clean. You can't go wrong with those three things.
Ali G.,"North Richland Hills, TX",317,552,114,4.0,5/30/2012,"We had a huge party (of 16), were seated very quickly, and were treated very well by the waitstaff. All of the food was good - everyone was happy with what they got. You have got to try their pizza, and their pazookies."
Rob W.,"Orange County, CA",34,648,1172,4.0,9/9/2009,"Oh Yeah....I'm a fan of BJ's alright. Not so much these newer Brewhouse Restaurants........my favorites are Newport & Lahaina. In fact, Tim and I pretty much almost hated this location when it first opened up 4 years ago. Just too noisy, service was never very good, food was just OK. The restaurant and bar is just one huge open space and it can easily seem like a giant sports bar at times.  Tonight we met my family (9 of us) here to celebrate my Moms Birthday. They sat each of us as we arrived instead of making us wait for a ""complete"" party. We actually had great service and the crowd and noise level was actually pretty mellow. We ordered a variety of things off the menu including one large Bacon Cheeseburger Pizza. Seemed like it was all good, didn't here any complaints. I definitely didn't hear any complaints when our 7 PIZOOKIEs arrived!!"
LeRoy W.,"Corona, CA",3,27,28,4.0,6/15/2014,Love the beers and the variety on the menu. Deep dish pizza is great.  I'd recommend the  Mediterranean deep dish pizza with a Hop Storm IPA.
Sarahzin S.,"Riverside, CA",173,9,2,5.0,5/13/2014,"I have to say that I've never had a bad experience here. I'm lactose intolerant and I always order food without cheese or butter. Most of the time, they get it right. If they don't get it right, they do their best to make sure that my food is okay. Sometimes, they'll even give a drink or pizooki free to make up for the inconvenience. Overall, I love it."
Christie L.,"Corona, CA",0,9,,1.0,7/11/2014,WORST BJ's experience ever!!!! The hostess was rude when we came in. Our seats were given up when we had a reservation. They sat us on the patio and forgot about us. Our meals came out wrong and all at different times. And some of us didnt even get our order at all. We had to ask for our food. We had to ask for our table settings...and we were a party of 15. We spent over 300 dollars for the worst service and food ever. We totally will never go to this BJ's ever again!!!!!
Daniella O.,"San Francisco, CA",105,39,32,2.0,11/17/2013,The food is good but the service here has always seemed a little lackluster to me...last time I went they took forever to bring out our condiments and my drink was empty for a while before I asked my waitress if I could get more water.
