Esther F.,"Corona, CA",1,10,,2.0,1/25/2015,Somethings going wrong with what used to be a good place to eat. Last two times i visited i have left sadly disappointed . I hope someone stops this runaway train.
Michelle D.,"Riverside, CA",0,4,,4.0,8/16/2015,"My boyfriend and I had spontaneously wanted to have the delicious pizza from BJ's and since this was the closest location to us, we decided to go. For a Saturday night, it's typical to have a 30-40 minute wait for a booth, so while we were waiting, we had already picked out which pizza we wanted. We had awesome seating facing the bar and all of the main TVs. We ordered the BJ's favorite and the gourmet Mac and cheese. As expected, it took a little bit for the pizza to come out--but it was alright since we were having a good conversation and periodically watching all the games that were on. Anyways, right as we got the pizza, my boyfriend asked me, ""didn't we order the Mac and cheese?"" So after that we flagged down our waiter and asked him about it: he forgot to put it in. He apologized and immediately put it in, and it came out quickly. The pizza and the gourmet Mac and cheese definitely hit the spot!  Usually waiters ask about dessert before you finished your meal, but we were already close to being done and we had to flag him down to order the mini trio pazooki. It also came out quickly, but I was sad that all of them were hard, as if they were in the oven too long or were sitting out for too long. He later came back and asked how it was and I told him how I felt about it and he was very accommodating saying that if we had the time, they would redo our order. We really appreciated it and also felt bad for wasting food. But when the new order came out, it was ooey gooey delicious. We really appreciated the service and patience from our waiter during our time with him."
Mia G.,"Riverside, CA",2,6,2,5.0,4/27/2014,"Came here last night with my sisters after a disappointing experience at another restaurant. We Got seated right away here and ordered the kale and roasted Brussels sprouts salad, a grilled chicken club sandwich, a side of thin fries and a pitcher of the oasis amber! The sandwich was so good we ordered another one! Not only did our food come out in what seemed like 10 minutes but Everything else was amazing the food our beer our server that was super attentive...thank you bjs corona for saving our night!!!"
Candace A.,"Beaumont, CA",1,25,,4.0,4/27/2015,"I must say I'm not a fan of chain restaurants so my expectations were very low. Our waitress took a long time to take our drink order and an even longer time coming back for our food order. But once the food arrived we forgot about how long it took to get it. We ordered the spinach filled mushrooms and they were superb. Lots of cheesy goodness. This time a guy brought the food and he was professional and attentive throughout the meal. We were pleased with the soup, (I ordered tortilla and my daughter ordered tomato) but the real winner was the caprese salad. There was a smear of balsamic on the plate which was delicious, along with olive oil and fresh basil. It was the best I've ever had. I left off 1 star because of the poor beginning, but I really can't wait to go back for the food."
Emily N.,"Riverside, CA",26,12,,4.0,3/30/2015,Their  chicken lettuce wrap and mushroom stuffed with spinach were scrumptious. Our waitress was friendly and helpful.  We ordered flat bread pizza but it didn't taste like pizza. She offered to change for another entry. We didn't want to trouble her and declined the offer. Unexpectedly she asked the manager to take it off our bill. We were pleasantly surprised.
Hungry H.,"Riverside, CA",0,11,,5.0,4/5/2016,come to this location quite often with both family and friends. the staff continuously exceeds my expectations. you guys rock.
Nenna G.,"Murrieta, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/24/2015,"after a long day my family & i decided to go to this bjs location since it was the closest to where we were at. First of all the hostess has starring problems and then decided to talk to another girl at the front and they both kept talking and proceeded to stare. second of all the food was disgusting. one of us ordered a steak medium well & it was bloody and undercooked we had to send it back and by the time it came back we were ready to leave. the mushrooms had NO flavor at all. The avocado egg rolls were kind of burned. the asparagus was dry and seemed very old. we ordered 2 jambalayas and they both had dry almost burnt rice and too much spice the other stuff on top was just not as great as in the other locations. we also ordered a pizza and it was falling apart. Over all the food was just not good. no one finished their meal. the only good things were some mashed potatoes and a pizookie. the food took a while to come out and we were just not pleased at all. the server was great and when she saw the meat was way undercooked she asked if we wanted to have a new one made, she was on top of it the whole time. everything else was just disappointing. if we would of wanted crappy food we would of gone to get fast food."
Brittney J.,"Riverside, CA",35,120,17,1.0,9/14/2014,"Some of the worst service I have ever experienced! I love BJ's the food is always super good. Normally we go to the one in Moreno Valley, but the one at Corona Crossing is equal distance so we decided to go to that one instead. HUGE mistake. We were seated for awhile before our waitress came over she took our drink order and didn't come back for about 10 minutes, when she did she only had 2 of our 3 drinks. I ordered Sierra mist and it was flat, yuck. My husband asked after she dropped the drinks if we could order and she said yes and proceeded to walk away!!!! She comes back like 10 minutes later still no drink for our 3rd person. This place isn't packed, there's really no excuse for this poor of service except for this girl is seriously incompetent. If your not going to be friendly and you can't properly wait tables don't be a waitress!!! I will never come to this location again or at least if I do I never want to be seated in this waitresses section again!!!!?"
Olaa C.,"Corona, CA",2,8,,2.0,3/6/2013,The food was eh... just ok but the service is horrible! Our server simply disappeared until it was time to drop off the check. Don't know why I bothered eating here...
Douglas W.,"Corona, CA",172,47,17,4.0,1/27/2011,"So, my wife and I rarely eat in the restaurant.  But the bar, at happy hour?  We used to go all the time.  We're all for a $5 mini-pizza (1/2 off), a beer ($1 off) and used to share a giant plate of wedge-cut fries for just $2 ($3.95 - $2 off) for a cheap restaurant meal.  But when the chain got a new head chef a couple years ago, they took the wedge-cut fries off the menu, and added some new ideas that sounded good but that the restaurants hadn't figured out how to cook.  So it's been a little while. It should be noted that they're doing $2 beers on Tuesdays during happy hour in addition to the specials mentioned above and 1/2 off wine all day.  That's right, TWO DOLLARS FOR A PINT OF GOOD BEER AT A BAR.  I was so excited. We decided to hit the bar last Tuesday and, frankly, had some of the best service we've ever had, anywhere.  Our server, Leandro, was funny, personable and quick.  The refills and the jokes flowed, plates were cleared immediately, and although the food didn't take too long to come out, he let us know a few minutes before that it'd be out in just a bit.  He came by to check on us regularly, but not intrusively.  Great service.  Maybe it was an anomaly, we haven't had service like that there before, but color us impressed, particularly for a chain. The food is solid, good food.  We had the Spinach Artichoke mini-pizza, a couple beers (PM Porter and Nutty Brewnette), Avocado egg rolls (Always amazing!), barbeque chicken mini-pizza and for dessert, the beignet.  The beignet is fairly new to the menu, and frankly, was nothing more than a doughnut.  We've had beignets before, we love them, but skip them here.  Stick with the pizookie, it's tried and true. It's a good atmosphere.  Fun, lively, with well-placed TVs.  A great place to watch the game.  Yes, it's a chain.  No, I probably wouldn't sit and eat lunch here.  And for dinner, while I wouldn't mind the interior restaurant-area atmosphere of La Jolla's or Newport's, or Laguna Hills, I'm not such a huge fan of the restaurant area of these new cookie-cutter brewhouse things. But the bar.  It just feels right.  The prices at Tuesday Happy Hour are awesome, the service is anywhere from decent to stellar, the food and drinks are better than most sports bars, and the atmosphere is great.  We'll add this to our regular rotation."
Lexi O.,"Sun City, CA",87,114,9,5.0,3/30/2011,"Great food! The potstickers are the best of any restaurant by far! The avocado rolls were also a hit. The buffalo chicken pizza is great and really filling. The kids' menus are great and there are many different options from mini corndogs to mac and cheese. The pasta dishes are pretty good, but I wouldn't say it's their specialty.  I've always appreciated their service; especially when the specialty shots we order at 7 bucks a pop don't come out right -- twice -- and they happily returned them to try and get it right. There was no dispute with any of their staff about it; in fact, the server prompted us to have them try again. The pizookies are oh so good, but order them during the middle of your dinner as they tend to take over 15 minutes to bake."
JUSTIN D.,"Pomona, CA",178,9,,5.0,12/31/2013,I love this BJs.  Manager Nancy is very good at her job.  She is the best!!!
J M.,"Foothill Ranch, CA",95,268,50,4.0,3/10/2011,"I really love BJ's, and I like that I have one not too far from home either.   They've got my favorite pizza, great deep dish, crunchy crusts, with chunks of tomatoes.  What more could a Chicago style pizza lover ask for?   Appetizers- like the avocado eggrolls, and the bruschetta. The soups are also good. I am not a fan of the salads, except for the bbq chicken salad.  I don't like chopped lettuce...I don't know why, I just don't.   The spaghetti is decent, but not the meatballs.  The pulled pork sandwich is tasty. The chardonnay pasta is a large portioned order, this is good too.  I've ordered tons of meals from BJ's and I've never been disappointed.  The burgers, and fries are good too, and so is the beef dip sandwich.   Of course don't forget the pazookie!!!! I like the atmosphere, and for the most part you'll get a good server. So overall, I enjoy visits to this location."
Tom A.,"Corona, CA",0,2,,2.0,4/28/2015,"The food is just so, so but it's the service that really makes me SCREAM. Every time my wife and I come here the service is horrible, unless you like to be ignored of course. Aarghhhhh!"
George B.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",0,1,,1.0,4/27/2015,I have ate at BJ's numerous times at many locations have always had great food and outstanding servous unfortunately not tonight from the time i walked into the doors at the corona BJ's the hostess was not there then greeted us as a bother cause i had my month old daughter with us and i didnt want to take her out of her stroller and we had to walk around to the ramp seemed like a real bother to her then our waitress that served us was also rude i cant even say who the waitress is do to she never even greeted just asked us if weve already decided what to eat as if we should hurry up  i have to say this visit has really changed my outlook on BJ's restaurant well atleast at my home location
Emily Y.,"Long Beach, CA",257,235,5,4.0,12/5/2010,"I might lose respect points for giving 4 stars to a chain restaurant but BJ's is tha bombs!  Where else can you get pretty good deep dish pizza, decent beer and also good apps and pastas? The pizookie alone gets 5 stars from me.  And this is coming from a woman who laughs in the face of chain restaurants. Let me first address the complaints on service and give up my secret for good service - eat in the bar.  Every time I've come here I've received crappy service on the floor but excellent service in the bar. Sometimes I wonder if they put their best waitstaff at the bar on purpose.  What I'll do is put my name down and start scanning for seats at the bar. I usually score a table in 15 or less with parties of 4 and up. Once we're seated service, we have beers on the table in 5, orders coming right up. At this branch, find the two waiters in the bar that are brunette with glasses. I get consistently awesome service from these two. As for the food, it probably depends on what you order but I always end up with one of the following: BJ's Favorite Pizza, Jeremiah Red beer, Calamari rings, the chicken wings (probably my favorite) and the flatbread pizzas and of course the Pizookie at the end. I've tried their pastas and they are pretty decent but the portions are huge! It's total guy food at the end of the day but I always have a good time at BJ's."
Cynthia N.,"Corona, CA",41,41,6,5.0,9/5/2013,"The 5 star rating is really with the service. Always ask for Cassie. She remembers everything, is super nice and is one of the best servers they have. We go often and always try and get her area. Food is good too add the great service and its great."
Amanda V.,"Corona, CA",2,45,52,2.0,2/28/2014,"The service here is terrible. Our waitress basically took our order, left us, had a bus boy bring us our food, brought our check then left us again for about 30 min. We could not get her attention to take our check so we could leave. We ended up paying with what cash we had which meant that we did not leave a tip. They are not attentive at all especially later in the night."
Richard P.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",3,1,,5.0,8/3/2014,"I really enjoyed the water melon salad. On a hot summer day it was light, refreshing and delicious. Only 200 calories. Try it when you  to BJ's."
