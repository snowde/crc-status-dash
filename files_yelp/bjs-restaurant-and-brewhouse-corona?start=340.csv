Tamina L.,"Corona, CA",30,35,4,3.0,4/12/2011,"I do enjoy the food at BJ's such as the pazookie and avocado egg rolls, but the service is horrible. I have been to this BJ's multiple times, and have only found 3-4 servers who don't give an attitude. I understand when its busy and I am with a big group, but I have had poor service even when it is slow. If you're only going for the food, its totally worth it, but don't expect the best service."
Tony K.,"Honolulu, HI",100,250,43,2.0,9/18/2010,Service is not good.  Not that people aren't friendly but that requests are repeatedly forgotten and the servers are too busy to really serve their clients well. I had to ask 3 times to get my sauce I requested and I didn't even ask out server  and had to ask another random server walking around.  The dessert came out and we asked for to go boxes but it took me reminding another random server before getting our desserts.  Overall a very frustrating visit.
Ana K.,"Corona, CA",18,30,29,2.0,6/23/2011,"Ehhhh...can i just go ahead and call myself the ""Meh Reviewer""? Seriously. Ordered the avocado egg rolls. Not bad, but the sauce was a bit spicy and almost didn't fit with the taste of the rolls, if that makes any sense. Had the wedge salad which was rather unimpressive looking and sloppy on the plate. Tasted ok. Meh I say. Ordered the shrimp tacos. Bleh. So small!!! And almost no flavor. The chips that were served with it (which totally came from a bag) were crispy and delicious and the best part of the entire meal. I wasn't expecting a five star experience, but seriously? I feel like I got short changed in quality and service. Meh, I say to you BJ's. MEH."

Lou D.,"Corona, CA",25,31,16,4.0,5/15/2013,You can never go wrong going to BJ's for a good dinner.  Service was great and the food was fine.  The manager even threw in a free dessert as he didn't realize we received it already and didn't want the extra to go to waste.
Nicole M.,"Corona, CA",61,59,1,3.0,11/1/2012,"I have been coming to this one for years now and honestly this place has its hits and misses. Mostly misses sadly. I have seen the staff get newer each time I visit. It is never consistent. It's sad though because I can only mention 2 workers that I can rave about! Everyone else is pretty below customer service. Again, it gets its ""meh"" rating."
Steve A.,"Riverside, CA",42,27,,3.0,11/15/2011,"I'm giving this place 3 out of 5 stars not because of the food. The food there is great. And not because of their bar. They are always stocked (not like Buffalo Wild Wings) and the drinks are always perfect. No no no, the reason that I'm giving this place 3 stars instead of 5 is because when I want to go to a bar I don't want screaming, crying kids there! There's nothing wrong with families. I have one and have 2 kids but when they were little we ate at the restaurant and NOT AT THE BAR! The bar is for adults and not kids or families that bring their kids. WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU, PEOPLE? Another issue that I have with BJ's is the smoking area. THERE ISN'T ONE. If Buffalo Wild Wings had good food that would be the place to be. So, if you want good food and don't mind kids, BJ's is the place to go."
Ahmed F.,"Corona, CA",424,34,69,1.0,6/24/2010,"Manager was a prick... my friends had four shots within like 30 mins and 2 beers each and they cut them off. The said manager said we had too many drinks in to short of a time period, but they are drinkers and didnt even have a buzz. stupid management !!!!"
Bryan T.,"Corona, CA",24,34,2,2.0,8/19/2013,"Just ehh, I don't really like their beers.  Service is alright food is decent.  Nothing special in the slightest that's why no 3"
Sherry C.,"Fontana, CA",3,11,,1.0,10/14/2012,"This location has horrible customer service. I wanted to place a take out order and was placed on hold for ten minutes. I decided to just hang up and order in the restaurant. I walked in and stood at the hostess station for probably ten minutes and not one person came up to help me. One server even walked by, stared at me and walked away without even asking if I had been helped or that someone will be right with me. I'm never coming to this location again. I just assumed the last visit I received horrible service was because I ordered 30 minutes before closing, but I guess their service always sucks. What a waste of my time."
Lauren V.,"Anaheim, CA",99,275,10,2.0,3/28/2010,"Ugh...Just had my ""last straw"" experience here. Wasnt pretty. Let me preface this review by saying that I usually do NOT review chain businesses unless Ive had a remarkably great or remarkably horrid experience there. this was the latter. Another thing I should point out before I bitch and moan is that service is usually hit or miss. You'll either get the nicest most attentive server ever or one that will be rude and ignore you. I have had equal experiences with both. The food is also forgettable. Its from a chain an is on par with TGI Fridays and Chili's in quality. Its about as welcome as a microwave pizza and depending on who you are, that can be a good or bad thing.  So basically its all just average ""meh"" food and service. Only come when you're stuck in south corona and its you just want to get out of the house. So what happened to me this last time to make me so bitter?  A rather LARGE group of people (both in numbers and in physical appearances) were hanging around outside the front doors. they were being loud and were taking stupid pictures right in the walkway.  (yeah, reaaaal classy) Me and my companions were trying to get around them to get inside. Some plump, quasi-drunk, white trash girl with bleach blonde hair looks at us and shouts at the top of her lungs, ""Hey guys! Get out of the way so these poor people can come in!"" We stopped in our tracks and looked at her and she just drunkily grabbed her friends and unfaded at our offenses, utters the same sentence again.  We pulled up in a new model mercedes and were in collared shirts/blouses, jackets and slacks because we just came from a viewing at a funeral parlor. I dont see how we could've been labeled as ""poor""...maybe its because 3/4 of us were brown-- but we had a clean-cut white guy with us..hmmm... Now Im already depressed and really, theres no use in trying to start a fight with a drunken, FAT, white trash girl that already has plenty of backup.  We go inside and mention to the hosts that they might want to ask that  large group to take their party elsewhere as there's people trying to come in and they're being kind of obnoxious. The hosts stare blankly at us and plainly ask again, ""how many?"" Gee, thanks for your concern, guys. This night the servers were uncaring robots who just plain wanted to get us in and out. My beer orders were wrong and I received attitude for trying to correct it, my friend's fruit garnish and drink partially spilled out... We were hounded incessantly for food orders but when they realized we only wanted drinks we were then ignored for long periods of time, even when we attempted to flag servers down to reorder drinks or get napkins. As I said before, I've had hit or miss experiences... but the overall experience of tonight's (3/27/10) misadventure has cast a shadow over this BJ's. The rather unsavory (and RUDE) crowd and unpredictably good or bad service has turned me off completely.  I think I'll head over to Dos Lagos the next time Im in need of a drink and am stuck in corona."
S Y.,"Anaheim, CA",0,93,4,2.0,8/6/2012,"I hate to do it to this place but we didn't have a great experience there and really I want to give them 1 star but I don't think it would be fair.  To sum it up, our server forgot to place our dessert order, then took a guess and put in the wrong order, and 40 minutes later comes and tells us ""I took it off your bill sorry, if you wait 5 more minutes the right order will come out"" and I told her ""It's not about the money."" Which it's NOT about the money, because I would rather have paid the $5.95 and had our dessert, taking it off the bill is not going to give me my 40 minutes back.  Anyway she was completely apathetic, my husband wanted the dessert so we twiddled our thumbs for another 15 minutes during which she didn't even stop by to give us an update on the dessert, finally my husband decided to just leave.  Even just typing it makes me mad again, mostly because of her attitude.  It is unfortunate but one person with bad customer service can ruin it for the whole restaurant (and this serves true for any other establishment where customer service is important, like even your doctor's office or something for example). To be fair, we ordered the avocado egg rolls, watermelon salad, mozzarella and tomato salad, and all of those were truly good.  My husband got the Kwak beer which was great beer.  That is the only reason I will bump them from 1 to 2 stars.  However in general their pizza is gross, all carbs and skimpy on the sauce and toppings."
Julia J.,"Chino, CA",63,262,1851,3.0,11/14/2010,Its a chain restaurant... The service is mediocre - (I think I'm being generous by saying that too) ALWAYS the servers have been friendly - but S-L-O-W ... so I think there's issues in the kitchen! I know this - so my expectations are lowered when the group I'm going with picks BJ's to eat at (it's not someplace I would suggest to dine at).
Cathy C.,"Corona, CA",0,4,,5.0,11/5/2013,"Stopped in for lunch and had a nice time. The food was good,  Our waiter Leo was just great!  I just had to write and share that there are still good servers around. This was our first time here but we will go back."
Lance H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",22,373,36,2.0,5/28/2010,Being downgraded for the following:  Forgot my salad then brought it out later. I did not want it then got questioned a few times about it including the manager. Staff was not pleasant about it.  Pizookie was lame. Do not waste your money.  Server brought check with dessert then came back in the middle of eating and asked it I had paid yet. Really! Table turning bullshit.  Only thing saving them from a ONE star is that the pizza was good on that day.  Get it to go but watch out for their bullshit.
Chris H.,"Sacramento, CA",5,57,33,2.0,7/3/2014,"Well I had late dinner here last night Wednesday. We did arrive 45 mins before closing.  But since they had 6 tables I was ok with it.. we stood at front desk for 5mins and No one said hello or even said site where ever you want. So after 5mins I walk to bar and said is it open seating he said yes I said thanks for letting us know when we first got here lol. Our server was great believe his name was leo. But my pasta was tomato sauce not Cajun style pasta no spice at all, got chicken and shrimp.  Shrimp was very fishy smelling and tasting chicken was dry. Didn't eat ant of my shrimp left it behind witch no one noticed there was something wrong with it. My friend got sampi plate is wasn't good at all. He ate half.. never been to this bjs. And I will most likely not return.  Hope you work on you cooking. Could have been because it was late but my server said pasta would taste better since grill wasn't at temperature for a steak."
Amy D.,"Placentia, CA",204,108,110,4.0,8/28/2012,Great happy hour and service at this location! I come to this location a lot and have never had a bad experience. My favorite thing is the brunch! Soooo good and it is Saturday and Sunday which is awesome.
Alberto E.,"Chino, CA",543,473,1759,3.0,8/24/2010,"This BJ's is a hit or miss for lunch.  Depending on what day it is or how busy they are it can vary.  Today was good, not that many people so service was prompt.  Our waitress, Jenna R, did a good job of taking our drinks and order in a timely matter.  I enjoy the lunch menu at BJ's. The only thing that upset me was that they removed the sliders from the lunch menu and raised the price on them.  I guess the sliders are that popular :o("
Don S.,"Nuevo, CA",0,7,,1.0,5/21/2013,"THIS PLACE SUCKS BAD! My wife, daughter and I waited an hour and a half for our food. No apology was given. All we got was that their pizza station was backed up..... yet 2 tables that arrived 20 mins after us received their pizza before we did. When we finally got our pizza which was the buffalo chicken pizza. It was undercooked very doughy and the chicken tasted of freezer burn. Nasty, not worth the wait nor anyones time. BJs NEVER AGAIN!"
Margie W.,"Corona, CA",78,39,2,2.0,9/24/2013,"I give them two star for the very nice looking restaurant. We sat down and waited for our server about 45 min.  Once she took our order  I think we  waited another 45 min or longer  before food arrived cold to our table.  The experience I described here is not unusual.  The wait is always long, the service never fantastic.  The food pretty much always a disappointment.  Hamburger  was extremely greasy, french fries very salty.  I will probably not be going back there with my family.  I would go back To BJ's for their good beer and drinks, hang out in the evening in the bar area.  The restaurant side is just not that impressive all together.  not sure if the management there is reading yelp reviews but for such a good location they shoudl really try to ""up it"" a bit with wait time, service and food!"
