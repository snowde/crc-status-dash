Lacey W.,"Georgetown, TX",0,21,6,1.0,10/11/2012,"This is the worst Bj's I have ever been to! It's a shame, because I love their food. The service here is horrible! When you walk in no one greets you. We sat in the bar area and our waitress had a horrible attitude, was chewing her gum like a cow chews cud and had no brain. It took 30 min for her to take our drink order and by that time we wanted to order our food as well. It took another 15 min to get our drinks and then our food came an hour after the drinks. The worst part the food was all cold and soggy! When we talked to the manager she had a worse attitude than the waitress. We will NEVER return to this Bj's no matter how close it is to us."
Tobias K.,"Riverside, CA",18,17,7,4.0,10/3/2012,This place is consistently great with their customer service and their food.  Even better is their beers on tap and even better than the regular beers on tap are the seasonal beers they offer.  Their new rewards program is also a nice addition to an already great place to eat and drink.
Mike M.,"Gilbert, AZ",37,75,21,3.0,9/24/2010,Beer Good- Service Very Good- Food ok. Restaurant Vibe Good- Caveman Review
Marisa H.,"Murrieta, CA",19,152,27,3.0,5/26/2012,"Good service but the food was not as good as other locations, such as the one in Temecula. I ordered the ahi tuna salad and the tuna tasted awful compared to the same salad in Temecula. Big bummer, wont be back to this location."
Dan T.,"Corona, CA",26,89,16,2.0,10/5/2011,"Actually more like 2 1/2 stars. Better than the other 2 stars that I've rated but I rounded down because after 3 visits, I'm done with this restaurant. Interior is fine, nice clean and comfortable. But, it is mediocre food and mediocre service that seals the deal for this place."
R. Z.,"Corona, CA",1,138,2,2.0,8/7/2012,Absolutely horrible service.  Mediocre food.
Derek T.,"Sun City, CA",17,51,28,2.0,3/30/2014,"This BJs really was a disappointment.  I think this location is severely damaging to the rest of the BJ locations. If it was not for our server Spencer for doing an excellent job this rating would have been a lot lower. To start of the receptionist were not very pleasant to us or anyone else we watched she spoke to. She had no problem telling all the upset people walking out to have a great day. She was rude to everyone else that decided to stay and endure the long wait. I don't understand why they didn't utilize the open patio seating to accommodate anyone.  We were just by a BJs that had a packed patio in Rancho. Maybe low on servers I guess, but a huge miss on business planning if that was the case. Moving along, the lady that brought us to the table was lost and a bit unwelcoming.  We get to the table to find that the beer selection is nothing like any of the other BJs.  This was the thing that just killed the night. Only 2 IPAs on tap is a sad day, and no other craft beer to choose from.  And now the food..... The quality of this food was nowhere near any of the many BJ locations we have been to. The oil was old and needs to be changed because it severely tainted the calamari we got. My wife got the grilled chicken pasta and it looked like it was from the kids meal with how bland the pasta was. I had the chopped BBQ chicken salad and it  was texturally one note. The kids got some gross happy face mushy Potatoe things. Our server Spencer really did a great job and helped smooth over all the disappointment."
L L.,"Corona, CA",196,25,,2.0,8/14/2014,"This location usually makes you wait longer for everything. Even if you have a reservation, know what you want to order when you are seated, and aren't on your cell phone. I got the mahi mahi tacos last night, they had fish bones in them, and the tortillas were burnt. I only ate one. I didn't feel like complaining because I didn't want to wait any longer. We had to ask a few times to get refills on our drinks. The server was patient with us, but service was still slow. I usually don't go to this location unless the rest of my group picks it."
Natalie S.,"Riverside, CA",86,277,1560,4.0,3/21/2012,"Always enjoyed the various items I've ordered here. The pizzas aren't my top favorite but they're yummy. the cocktails are good and so are the beers. Spinach cheese dip is bomb and the spinach stuffed mushrooms were also delightful. My fiance has ordered the crispy jalapeno burger which he said was good but not great. What I really loved and appreciated greatly from our last visit was our server who was awesome to began with, when we informed him our medium rare burger was very well done, got us not only a new burger but it was also taken off the bill and he told us management offered us dessert. So free burger and brownie, I was so blown away and of course we tipped very generously. I wish I could remember his name, a tall blonde gentlemen fairly young, just great all around. Changed my view on BJ's since my first visit years ago which  resulted in a suspicious added credit card tip after I knew I tipped 20% with cash, everything was fixed. Love their bleu cheese stuffed olives in my martinis also, one of the few places to get them."
Danielle V.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",0,1,14,1.0,8/4/2014,"Yesterday was my second bad experience with this location, and there will not be a third.  I came in with a large party (17 people, called four hours before).  We ended up being split into two tables even though they originally said they could seat us all together.  Then they said between the two tables they could only split our check four ways, which we were fine with.   The server took our orders and said she was noting how the check was to be divided.  The food was decent, but my macaroni and cheese appetizer was watery.  The caesar salad was delicious.  One other person and I only requested water for a beverage, after our glasses were emptied 45 minutes into our visit (right after food arrived), refills were requested and never brought.  Everyone with sodas did receive refills though.   Of course, most of us wanted pizookies for dessert, and the server seemed irritated that we ordered.  Upon finishing, she then came to the tables and asked how the check was to be divided, wth--she said she was noting that from the start?! 30 minutes later, still no check.  We got the attention of the manager and asked him if he knew why our check was delayed.  He told us he'd see what was going on and was back within a few minutes.   The manager simply stated that it's a long and difficult process to divide up a check and we're lucky because it could take up to 30-40 minutes.  Another person in our party told him it had already been over 30 minutes, to which he ignored.  I then mentioned that we were approaching 40 minutes waiting for the check, he again ignored the statement.  He never apologized, did not appear one bit remorseful for the bad service."
Darla G.,"Orange, CA",0,9,4,4.0,1/5/2013,"Place is clean, staff is friendly and the food is good.  Only complaint I would have is that it takes awhile to get the food, but other then that I really like the place."
Charles A.,"Yorba Linda, CA",4,15,13,3.0,1/5/2011,"Ok, I don't particularly like chain restaurants but I must say I like the pizza and the bar area of the newer Bj's.  They have lots of TVs, cold beer and it's comfortable enough to watch a football game and get a bite to eat.  Don't hate the star rating until you try it.  Buffalo chicken pizza and the Grand Cru ate a must try."
Micky R.,"Huntington Beach, CA",2,81,1,2.0,3/19/2012,"I've decided that BJ's is off my list for a few reasons. 1. The only food worth ordering is pizza or burgers & there are many other burger & pizza places to go. 2. Asked the waiter if they could grill the ahi on my salad a little more and he said ""it comes to us this way"" so it's right out of a package I assume. 3. The balsamic chicken taste like it came right out of a frozen chicken bag with bottled balsamic drizzle. The food is always subpar, not worth the wait or price."
Chris M.,"Riverside, CA",0,4,1,4.0,11/24/2012,"Been going every Friday for dinner for 3 months, most menu items are above average.  Service is also above average. For the price, I say it is a hit."
Arm S.,"Culver City, CA",5,15,,1.0,5/15/2012,Sooo disappointed with the food my whole family and guests ordered (total of 8 people)! Should have went In & Out Burger that night :(
Marinette Y.,"Corona, CA",0,5,2,2.0,10/22/2012,Bad service AGAIN!!! Our drinks were never refilled...we ordered boneless chx wings and got boned chx wings...Caesar salad came after our meal! This is the second time we got bad service...food is good but you would think we would've learned our lesson!!!!
Y K.,"San Marcos, CA",0,17,,1.0,4/14/2012,"I ordered my food. Then I waited...Then I waited some more. I started getting restless, angry, and VERY HUNGRY. It took at least an hour for the food to come. The food was not worth the wait."
Bruce T.,"East Jordan, MI",1,21,,4.0,8/30/2012,"This place is a favorite with the locals. Ive been here a few times over the past couple years and have always enjoyed the experience. The beer is great and the steaks are well prepared. Stay away from the Hawaiian mahi mahi, I tried it last time and it was under seasoned and over cooked leaving it dry and almost uneatable."
Sianna D.,"Corona, CA",1,7,6,1.0,4/28/2013,"Came here with some friends, I asked for another menu and our waitress walked away. It seems like everytime I come here the experience gets worse and worse. This place needs to renovate their staff and have higher standards for themselves or they are just going to loose more customers. This location puts a bad name for this company and they need to fix that. I live in corona and I'd rather go the distance and go somewhere else to eat at a bjs. I recommend that they replace the staff with more qualified employees and stop and actually take customers orders and care. We are tipping you for a reason. The service is a huge PLUS and these people seem to not even care. We got here at 10:30, waited till 11 to even order out food? The waitress passed us by like 3 times. And no order taken. Right when we got our appetizers we had no silverware? Who runs this place? Idiots."
Denise A.,"Corona, CA",2,16,3,5.0,10/22/2011,I love BJ's. This is my favorite restaurant. I use to have to drive to Brea. The location here in Corona feels smaller then Brea. I am not sure if it is. The food selection is great. There are many things to choose from. There pizza is really good. I have also had there pasta and salad's. Also really good. They have a huge selection of beer and mix drinks. Make sure you try the Pazzooki. I think I spelled that incorrectly. It is a dessert .
