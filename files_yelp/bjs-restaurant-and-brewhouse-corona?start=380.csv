Brian H.,"Temecula, CA",76,10,,2.0,2/21/2011,"I don't know what it is about BJ's and their service but every BJ's I have gone to has had poor service. Let me preface this by saying that my girlfriend and I stopped at the Corona location on our way back from Joshua Tree so neither of us had been to this location. Despite being quite busy our wait time was relatively short, but our table service is where the real problem was. I wasn't really paying attention to the times but I was watching the NBA All-Star game so I used that for our reference times. We ordered our food at midway through the 2nd quarter. Our order wasn't too complicated, BBQ salad for me, calzone for my girlfriend, and a chicken breast for our 2 yr old. Long story short, it was midway through the 3rd quarter when we got our food. This is after an extended halftime for the show. I know the food time isn't a fault for the server but they know when there is an issue. The part that really bothered me is when the server told us she had checked on our food, this was a lie because we were looking for her to ask about it and noticed her at the register for about five minutes and then walking around to other tables before finally coming to us. Then, it was another 20 minutes by the time we got our food and it was cold. After being there for about an hour and receiving our cold food, we just decided to pay the bill and leave since the 2 yr old was fussy. The real kicker was the two parties that sat on each side of us, one of which had our same server. Both sat, ate, and paid before we had gotten our food. The table with the same server was a family of five with individual entrees. My overall analysis is that while BJ's food is alright, their service is always at an issue."
Mel E.,"Norco, CA",34,86,5,3.0,5/20/2011,"The food is always good but the service leads much to be desired.  We barely saw our waiter and it was a pain to even get silverware.  Just be prepared to complain if it becomes particularly intolerable.  Bottom line is if not for the service, they would get all 5 stars."
Jane K.,"Honolulu, HI",42,25,1,2.0,9/18/2010,Our server rarely came by the table and we had to keep asking other waiters to get our waiter.  The service needs to improve.  The place was busy but not so busy to warrant this type of service.
Ann T.,"Patterson, CA",97,97,1,3.0,11/1/2008,The food is good I enjoy the pizza.   The service is lacking.  I asked them to leave the tomatoes off the pizza but they were put on any way.  I did not send it back because the wait to get the pizza was so long I was not willing to make the people with me suffer.
Debbie H.,"Corona, CA",7,95,13,5.0,5/29/2011,"BEST RESTAURANT EVER!  BJ's is a Corona favorite!  Everything on their menu is fabulous, especially the chicken parmesian!  The staff is friendly and we know each meal will be nothing short of FABULOUS!"
Geo C.,"Corona, CA",20,21,23,1.0,9/5/2012,"This BJ's ssssuuuuccccckkkkssss! It's a shame because I'm a big fan of BJ's food, but this location is THE WORST. This is not based off of one bad visit, this is based off of many visits and I hope it will get better and it never does. I even had corporate give me a $100 giftcard because of one particular bad visit. Bad management and bad cooks. Do yourself a favor and go to any of the other BJ's."
David L.,"La Jolla, CA",57,56,14,3.0,1/3/2011,"About as average as you can get.  BJ's pizza is always good, but some of the other items are...eh.  The soup we ordered had the consistency of a cheese dip and the salad dressing had no taste."
Bobby L.,"Corona, CA",36,33,5,1.0,1/26/2012,"The food here is fine, just like any other BJ's.  However, this restaurant gets one star strictly because of the management.  I'm originally from NYC, so sometimes on Sundays, I like to watch the Jets somewhere if I choose to not watch them at home.  I attended BJ's a couple of times and had a decent time except for one Sunday when I was denied a request to have one of the televisions switched to the Jets game.  I made a simple request to have the Jets game on one TV, as it was the only game not shown all throughout the restaurant.  The server returned to my table and said that he cannot fulfill my request, so I asked to speak with a manager.  The manager came by and repeated what the server said, saying that she can not switch the channel.  I was a bit confused and really taken back by this, so I simply asked why.  The manager, a disgruntled woman, told me that they only have seven receivers and there were eight games on at the time, so earlier in the day, they decided to exclude the Jets game.  I then politely asked if she can switch the awful game between two last place teams that nobody was watching and she replied, ""no, we've already made our decision and it's not going to change"".  I then asked, ""So you're telling me that you're denying an actual request from a guest to switch from a game that nobody here is watching?"".  Her reply?  ""Yes, sorry"" as she walked away.  Clearly, if proper customer service can't even be implemented from the top, then this location is going to suffer.  They certainly will not receive any of my business anymore, that's for sure!"
Thomas W.,"La Mesa, CA",2,6,,4.0,7/12/2011,"I absolutely love BJ's. I am a stock holder and think the majority of the items on the menu are fantastic but on this occasion I ventured off course and tried the chicken sandwich. Not very good and I will be sure to go back to my tried and true deep dish pizza, pizzokie and Jeremiah Red."
Jeff L.,"Murrieta, CA",22,12,,1.0,12/20/2011,"The waitress was OK......we ordered two long island Ice teas, ( which were not good) and an order of stuffed mushrooms... 15 minutes goes by, waitress shows up with two drinks and says the mushrooms will be out shortly and asks for our order...we ordered, another 10 goes by and here comes or salad and soup..we canceled the shrooms and @ 3 minutes later here they come... Btw, did I mention a long black hair in my salad....neither my wife nor I have long black hair...so our lunch order shows up...COLD not hot beef dip sandwich..cold fries..... Long story..... Bad food"
Elizabeth D.,"Corona, CA",38,107,,4.0,4/28/2010,"I've never had good service at BJ's, but the food is worth the longer than usual wait time for your food.  I absolutely LOVE their pizza, and they have the gluten free crust for those with gluten intolerance! That totally rocks.  Their drinks are to die for too (definitely go with the tropical mojito).  My only complaint is the generally slow service and that there is always a line.  But I guess that means they're doing well and staying busy, so I'm okay with that.  It's a fun place with great food, but be prepared to wait awhile for your food!"
Adrian B.,"Corona, CA",0,13,,4.0,12/2/2013,"This place has it all. Overall we love it. So many food options, great beer and lots of TV's for sports. We sit in what I assume to be the family section, quite often. Service is usually good but I think that section is more challenging for the servers."
garbanzo b.,"Orange, CA",87,389,7,2.0,11/28/2007,"So went there and met up with a few friends... the last time I went to a BJ'S was when I lived in Westwood and Pizookie was my middle name... We ordered non-pizza items...but the waiter here SUCKED ASS... he forgot waters, when we had asked him 4 times... he forgot and gave us another tables bill... jeez louise...it was a weeknight..and it wasn't that busy...  Cat, Shan, i'm with you... Service here sucks. We left without a pizookie. That says a hell of a lot."
Cat L.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",194,402,491,1.0,8/30/2007,"Sure they make a mean buffalo chicken and great white pizza and my favorite half white choc macadamia/half chocolate chunk pazookie, but the service is unforgivable here; not to mention, the quality of their food was on the decline when I vowed to boycott this location. And this review isn't even based on a single visit, it's based on a minimum of THREE shitty experiences.  It has to do with the fact that we were left to wait for a couple that arrived AFTER us and was seated BEFORE us because they pulled the race card and griped obnoxiously about waiting so long for a table because they were ""black."" Without any apology from the greeter for making my Asian ass go numb from waiting on their bench for that couple.  It also has to do with the time that we asked for a to-go box and our waiter returned with a box with ""Dusty Malone"" written on it, and instead of exchanging it with a new one after we requested it, he assured us it was ""unused"" and walked away. And the last bone I have to pick with this place is on our most recent trip, the pizza sucked. Especially the buffalo chicken, which tasted SOUR. Why should I put up with their appalling service if their food isn't even up to par anymore?? I would give them -5 stars if I could. This BJ's BLOWS. BIG. COCK."
Lucero G.,"Riverside, CA",0,15,2,1.0,8/11/2013,"Their breakfast was HORRIBLE! Flavorless eggs, old hard frozen potatoes and stale hard bread. They know how to cook lunch and dinner but don't watse your time and money on their breakfast..."
Lena B.,"Corona, CA",54,45,7,1.0,7/3/2010,I give this zero for the crappy service people! Wow stood there like a statue not one person came to greet and when she did she was the biggest snob ever!!! I did not even bother getting seated would not want to waste my money on a snobby place like this ever!!!
The D.,"La Habra, CA",0,11,8,4.0,3/4/2011,I've had a good experience every time I've gone. Service is a little slow sometimes. But overall it's a good place to eat out and relax.
Stewie G.,"Los Angeles, CA",751,144,,4.0,6/30/2011,"great food and great prices. i have never dined in his place, only gotten food for delivery. my Friend works at this location and she swears on how clean and nice the kitchen is.  overall the food is great and tastey. nice selection of beer as well. i recommend this place."
Matt R.,"Orange County, CA",20,419,238,2.0,7/30/2009,"I think even two stars is too generous. There's just nothing good about this place. Most of the food is tolerable, but sometimes it's downright awful. The worst part is, I love beer and especially craft beer. I always say ""you could serve me beer in a paper cup in a lawnchair and I'd be happy."" Nope, not here. First off, I hate the word ""pazzokie."" Don't be retarded. Stop trying to be cute. Everytime I hear that word, I cringe and it makes me like the place less. I had some deep dish pizza here that basically tasted like pillsbury biscuit dough with prego sauce on top, barely baked. It was awful. And pizza is one of my favorite foods. By far THE WORST pizza ever, anywhere, period, hands down. Way to screw up, the un-screw uppable. Anyway, other than the pizza, the food was edible, but not very good by any means. Move along, nothing to see here."
J J.,"Los Angeles, CA",337,195,342,3.0,3/29/2012,"They used to have better service as well as less salty dishes. But now their pizza seems smaller but heavier from salted meats and less fresh veggie toppings in their BJs special. Also, they need to retrain their hostess to be more genuine about customer service. First impressions do go a looong way. I just hope the next time I'm craving pizza and I happen to be around BJ's, I wont' have to struggle walking into the place with hesitation of their poor hostess."
