Amber B.,"Anaheim, CA",0,3,,5.0,10/25/2017,"Boyfriend and I sat at the bar last night and received amazing service from Crystal. She was so friendly and was on top of orders the whole time which was amazing considering how packed the bar was due to the game.  If I return, I'll probably only go to the bar and ask if she is there because she was phenomenal."
Santana M.,"Los Alamos, NM",34,97,64,5.0,9/5/2017,"Just came her to say that our waiter was excellent. During the busy dinner rush, Leo was able to keep our drinks filled and he was a pleasure to speak with. When I arrived at this BJ's, we were quickly seated and drinks and food came out swiftly. It's hard to find a good waiter, but I really appreciated the quality, friendly service."
Andrea V.,"Corona, CA",0,9,,4.0,10/24/2017,"Matt is the best server! He is the only reason I am giving this place 4 stars! He is always happy, energetic, and prompt. When I have any other service the food is good, but the service is less than satisfying. Give Matt a raise!!"
Jessica S.,"Corona, CA",0,2,,5.0,10/20/2017,We've been coming into this bjs for a long time.  Service has always been awful in the dine in area but tonight we had the best waitress!!! She was so personable and on point with her service. It was such a great change. Made our dining experience so awesome!!!!!  Thank you Kaley P. You made our night!!!!
Venus L.,"Fullerton, CA",16,21,11,1.0,3/28/2017,"We love love BJ's but it's our 1st time at this location.  Unfortunately, we are served with our favorite ""Best Beginnings"" platter with a HAIR! Yuck! Totally, ruined our appetite!"
Olivia C.,"Corona, CA",2,27,4,5.0,2/5/2017,Today was a great day for soup!  Our waitress was so pleasant and kind. My mother and I decided to get their soup and salad. The waitress gave the endless special for what we ordered even though they only use that promotion during the week.  Haven't been here in a while and I am definitely coming back soon!
Good E.,"San Clemente, CA",0,43,6,2.0,11/26/2017,"Food at BJ's is OK to good depending on what you get.  One of the issues at this location is always the speed of service and the quality of service.  It takes a long time to get your drinks, food, refills, etc.  The story is always the same, ""we are really busy""; perhaps management should consider hiring more staff.  This is the main reason I don't patron this establishment unless I really have to."
Cindi G.,"Norco, CA",0,20,,1.0,10/2/2017,"We love the BJ's up in Arcadia, CA....so we thought this would be the same experience....it was NOT!  :( We ordered on the phone, ordering 2 entrees for hubby and myself...and a gluten free pizza for my son.  BJ's is our GO-TO gluten free pizza place for our celiac son.  :) We showed up, the order wasn't ready yet...not a huge deal....then when it was ready, they had messed it up....still we're going with the flow...and then I took a little bit of the gluten free pizza and popped it into my NIMA machine to test while they were fixing the goofed up order.  GLUTEN!  YIKES!  So showed the manager the NIMA test results...I think he was sorta in a spin...because he really didn't have anything to say.  I can only assume that our little machine showing gluten caught him off-guard.  So we asked them to cancel the order and just refund us for our order. They did offer to remake the pizza....sort of a joke...if your pizza has gluten in it.....what would make you think that try number 2 would be better? It actually took a bit of declining and repeating that we just wanted a refund so we could go...but they finally just refunded and we left. As much as we love BJ's Arcadia (which has ALWAYS tested gluten free), we will NOT be coming back to this location.  :( Gluten isn't just some fad diet phase.....for those with celiac disease...it's literally poison.  :("
Tina V.,"Orange County, CA",46,74,116,4.0,3/25/2017,Came here on Saturday around 3pm and the place was pretty busy but we were promptly seated. Our server was friendly and offered us the new avocado egg roll appetizer. It comes wirh a sweet tamarind dipping sauce and the avocado egg rolls were warm and creamy with a little kick. I ordered the cobb salad with avocado ranch dressing and my girlfriend ordered the root beer ribs. Both were very good but neither of us liked the slaw that came with the ribs.
Joe C.,"Fullerton, CA",0,27,,2.0,11/30/2017,"I had lunch with friends and had the double pork chop. Disappointing it looked great.. but, very little in the taste department.  Service was ok."
Jasmine F.,"Corona, CA",252,40,37,3.0,7/23/2017,This is just a review for the To-Go service. I live right by this place so if I am super hungry I will order on my way home from work. So far it has been an epic disappointment. Always get my food at least 15 min later than the estimated pick up time they say (yesterday I sat in there for 30 min waiting for it!) Really defeats the purpose of getting it to go. Another lady there yesterday was upset too as she waited 15 min before she could even place her to go order. Won't be trying it again for a while.
Joanne L.,"Placentia, CA",169,14,3,3.0,1/7/2017,"I've had authentic Chicago deep dish pizza and this is definitely NOT it.  The pizza is not bad, it's just very basic.  I honestly would take a Roundtables or even Papa Johns over this. The venue is loud and has tons of TV's in the bar so great for sports, I'm not a sports fan though.  Just wanted some pizza/beer w/ friends.  The other entrees salmon and jambalaya was better. Best of all was their poozokie dessert.  It was a warm cookie with real vanilla bean on it, best to get the ice cream on the side so you don't have to rush and eat it. The food is good, not great.  Dessert is excellent.  The atmosphere is a bit too loud for my taste"
C. T.,"Mendham, NJ",0,9,,5.0,9/7/2017,Great service! Experienced 2 minor issues and in no time the managers were at the table apologizing and comped our dessert (churros-Amazing!) an appetizer and a beer. Unexpected but definitely appreciated. Will definitely be going back.
bilal s.,"Corona, CA",2,90,16,1.0,5/26/2017,"I took my family there. Everything was going great up until the end. I ordered my pizookie way in advanced when I ordered my dinner, because I know my son is autistic and he has his own way of eating food so we thought it will be a great idea as soon as we get done with our dinner pizookie will be served, but nope that was not the case. I had to wait approx. 15+ mins after we finished our dinner. My daughter is sick and I put her on my lap and rude server took away her chair without even asking if my daughter is using it or what not because the resturant has a bigger party. I got so frustrated that I decided to leave and canceled my order because the whole wait was just too long and the whole chair incident happend I just lost it. My son cried home on our way home but it's okay I dealt with it. If someone can please look into the resturant management address this issue to the servers.  Thank you"
Tony C.,"Mira Loma, CA",0,7,,1.0,12/18/2016,"That's for the check in service. There were two in my party. We waited about 30 minutes. I checked up front to ask how much longer our wait was. The guy tells me we're next. 5 minutes later they seated a couple who checked in after us. After a couple of minutes I went up to ask why another couple got seated before us when he said we were next. He said we were both next. Yeah, the guy made a lot of sense. NOT. Additionally once we got seated, the same guy nudged the back of my chair when he was rearranging a table. No apology. I just found out the guy's name is Shawn.  Now I know why this restaurant only has 3 stars. Very unorganized and in my case the person up front is clueless and rude."
David L.,"Corona, CA",0,3,,1.0,5/14/2017,Terrible experience today. we had to ask for the silverware. then one set was dirty. then the replacement set of silverware was dirty as well- as in crusted food particles on it. Also my daughters seard mahi salad had a foil lid mixed in it that she had found when she bit into it.  very disappointing visit today. manager comped the meal and apologised.
Eric P.,"Newport Beach, CA",5,91,36,1.0,6/22/2016,"Absolute joke!!!  Sean was the waiter, bald goat tee manager - beer came twice dirty glass, sons root beer glass dirty, and second time flat. Waiter must of been a Magician  ...  Entree... North shore mahi, Came with a spoon served in the dish... In the dish... Yummy spoon handle, nope!!! Bj's no more - make the drive to yard house... Manger comp the mahi, beer and soda - my brother was with me and bill was still 35 bucks... If you admit your having an issue with glassware how do you still serve?"
Daniel A.,"Riverside, CA",15,4,,1.0,9/9/2017,"If I could give less than 1 star I would.  We waited over 50 minutes and still wasn't seated.  It seems like they couldn't figure out how to put 2 tables together to seat my group of 7, I watched a 5 top of people be seated then a 2 next to it.  It's not rocket science to push those tables together and we could have been seated.  Way to long for silly mistakes like not being able to count."
Nancy T.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",12,113,,3.0,8/19/2017,My husband and I met some family members here for dinner. We were told the wait would be 20 minutes and it was only 10 so off to a good start. The waiter was friendly and attentive. For the most part the meals were pretty good but my husband had fish and chips and said some of the pieces were rather dry.  We sat in a corner where we had to move the chair to get out. We were near the station that had spilled water on the floor and left the mop etc. just laying on the floor where it was wet. I was coming back from the bathroom and one of the waiters was not paying attention and ran right into me and stepped on my toes as I was only wearing sandals. He apologized but it sure didn't make my evening.
P m.,"Fullerton, CA",0,8,2,1.0,10/28/2017,"We frequent this chain and came to this location for the first time.   Huge disappointment and does the chain a disservice.   The salad came out missing ingredients, the pizza was undercooked and the meatballs were raw in the middle.   The service sucked until the waitress went on break.  Her replacement was so much better.  Just hope my daughter doesn't get sick from the meatballs."
