Dana B.,"Corona, CA",78,267,15,3.0,8/3/2009,"I love BJ's pizza, beer, and pizookie's!  I have never been dissapointed with any of their pizzas.  I really like their spinach and artichoke pizza.  It is super delicious!  Their white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie is heaven!  I like lighter beer so I like their harvest hefinweizen.  If you are going to have more than 2 glasses of beer. You should get a pitcher.  Do the math, it's cheaper in the long run and a pitcher is like 4 1/2 pints.  The only problem I have with BJ's is the service.  It seems like every time I go something gets messed up.  They forgot my daughters individual pizza last time.  Then by the time they put in the order and brought it out we were almost done with our food.  Another time they forgot my salad and I had to wait for them to bring it out while everyone else ate.  I love their food sand beero much that I put up with their sometimes crappy service."
Genevieve C.,"Corona, CA",20,25,,1.0,4/29/2012,"I usually don't mind eating at BJ's, the food is ok, the price is not bad and the service is usually acceptable.  This BJ's sucks!  My husband and I went there yesterday and where very disappointed.  I ordered a wild berry mojito that was so sweet I could not drink it.  Then we ordered a Cobb salad with blue cheese instead of feta, tossed and a Chinese chicken salad that took 30 minutes to get out to us.  Neither salad was amazing and the server was oblivious!  We will probably go to BJ's again but not this one!"
Donna H.,"Fairhope, AL",22,232,,3.0,6/5/2009,"We think BJ's food is pretty good.  It's a nice, casual dining place to take a group because of the large and varied menu, especially if you have kids to feed.  On our visits there, the service was good even though the place is usually packed.  My favorite dish is the Angel Hair Toscana with olive oil, garlic, sun-dried tomatoes, fire-roasted red peppers, fresh basil, feta cheese, pine nuts, Roma tomatoes, fresh Parmesan cheese and parsley with blackened chicken or grilled shrimp.  It's a light and healthy dish -- but it's a large portion, so I usually take half of it home.  My husband likes their meatloaf with white cheddar mashed potatoes, mushroom gravy and steamed vegetables."

Tiger V.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,13,,1.0,4/13/2011,"I'm so fed-up with this place, I finally joined Yelp just so I could warn others to go somewhere else! The service is beyond pathetic. After having 2 mediocre experiences over the years here (each time being offered one of their ridiculous cookies as an apology),  my wife and I really curtailed coming here. Then about a year ago, the bottom really fell out on a visit, and we promised never to return.  Until yesterday. 5 pm in Corona, the choices are not that great, so we figured maybe in the past year BJ's got its act together.  Well, we sat in the bar, at one of 2 empty tables. No one said hello, no one gave us menus, no one said they'd be right with us. Meanwhile, people coming in after us were getting served at the bar, and in the restaurant. All the while, the millennial-aged wait staff stood at the reception desk, chatting away.  If you want a broad menu in the hood, I'd suggest Wood River. Good pizza? Oggi's or New York Pizza Co. Cold Beer? Taps. We've learned our lesson about BJ's so you don't have to!"
Shan T.,"Corona, CA",15,73,2,3.0,11/12/2007,"It's unfortunate that Cat L.'s review is pretty on target with regards to the service.  I've been to so many different BJ's and to this one COUNTLESS times.  The service, is unfortunately, inconsistent, to say the least.  I've had acceptable dining experiences here, but probably more experiences similar to the ones Cat L. described.  This is the place to go when it's late and nothing else is open and you crave American cuisine.  The pizza is good, but different.  There isn't much sauce on it and the crust is thick--these aren't negatives depending on your palate.  The food is usually consistent, however, which is why I still give it three stars."
Joy E.,"Lynchburg, VA",0,21,,4.0,8/10/2008,"I've been there several times and have always had good service.  One time when we went I called ahead to put our name in and when we got there they couldn't find our reservation.  However, they gave us the benefit of the doubt and seated us anyway.  They then figured out that the guy that had answered the phone had written down the wrong name (one that sounded like ours).  Anyway, the manager personally came over and apologized, gave us a free appetizer and discounted our meal. Our food came out before our appetizer was gone and they were very friendly with us and especially our 4-year-old. I absolutely love their chopped salads and their pizza crust is great.  I also ordered a margarita there once and it was very good as well. The best part of going there is that we can order a large pizza and a pizzookie, feed our family of 3, and get out of there spending less than $25 (except for tip).  That's hard to do at any restaurant nowadays!"
Jenn V.,"Corona, CA",0,4,,2.0,10/6/2010,I have been here on several occasions and the service is SERIOUSLY lacking. It took forever for someone to greet us at our table and on a few visits food was forgotten. The staff is not very friendly and could care less about their customers. Pretty sad!
Jigga M.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,46,,4.0,4/3/2009,"this place was pretty good. service was really good, i tihnk our guy had a pony tail. i cant remeber tho.  they held on to the credit card for us for a few weeks since my gf forgot it."
