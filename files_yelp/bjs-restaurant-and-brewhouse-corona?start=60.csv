Krystal S.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",38,11,,2.0,8/6/2017,Not impressed. My salad had and inch of water on the bottom and the pizza was spongy and barely had cheese on it. Our waiter was super nice about it but they obviously need to evaluate the cooks. Sorry but not worth it.
Sheri T.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",0,2,,1.0,11/10/2017,"My husband and I went to the Corona location for an early dinner (4:30 pm) and were very disappointed. It took a while to be seated. We were told that the bus employees were on shift turn over. We could see the table that we were finally seated at and never saw anyone bus or clean that table. after being seated we noticed a red glob on the table and asked for it to be wiped down. the waiter removed the blob with a napkin and said he would have a bus come wipe the table - who never came. We ordered blended house Margarita's which came on the rocks. Then ordered appetizer and dinner. As we were waiting we noticed chips on the floor in the waiting area and on the steps down onto the dining floor, after bringing it to the manager's attention he picked up most of the chip on the stairs. Food was just okay. I ordered the parmesan chicken which was a bit on the overdone side but had taken some time to come to the table so I dealt with it. A trip to the restrooms before leaving just continued the dirty overall condition. Food in the restroom, someone dropped skiddles and they had gotten swept into the moldy corners of the tile and under the sink was a to-go bag. The facility was just as a whole in need of a good cleaning."
Jen R.,"Corona, CA",0,29,87,3.0,2/22/2017,This place is always packed that the customer service is going down. The food is very good though and they offer a lot on their menu. It's a nice location by the theater and so convenient to just walk before or after a movie date.
Denice M.,"Corona, CA",62,5,2,4.0,6/10/2017,My family and I had the recent pleasure during a Mothers day  Celebration to have brunch for the first time . The food was cooked beautifully and the service was even better . Our waiter was so personable that I will go back soon . Very often you pay high dollars and service and food is only adequate . This location was wonderful and everything delicious and staff so professional . I would recommend this place for a great experience .
Kassi D.,"Corona, CA",0,8,2,5.0,11/5/2017,"Let's talk ridiculously big menus and awesome chicken. While I think legally you probably need a license to handle that book they call their menu lest you accidentally drop it and start an earthquake, it is very inclusive and houses a great many edible eats. Story time! I have recently moved to Southern California and was searching for a very simple chicken strip melt sandwich that remained elusive despite its simplicity when, as luck would have it, my dear husband suggested we try BJs ( not those kind you dirty minded wanker). Alas our adventure started. We met Zachary, who in all honesty was the best server in the entire history or servers! He was clearly born with super powers that allowed him to register exactly when we needed something and when we were preoccupied with our delicious food.  All in all it was a very satisfying adventure and I would very much recommend it to others. ALTHOUGH ZACHARY IS OURS AND WE WILL NOT SHARE. Please be advised. Thank you."
Daisy M.,"Corona, CA",1,16,1,4.0,7/22/2017,Always a great place to eat. Get there before 5 during the week or expect a good wait. My husband and I love to sit in the bar area as it's first come first serve. Food is always good but service depends on the time of day. Overall food is good
Julie H.,"Oak Hills, CA",34,230,22,3.0,12/29/2016,"The salmon dinner was pretty good, and the salmon was cooked perfectly (not dried out and over-cooked).  However, the grilled asparagus (my favorite vege) was strange.  The asparagus tips had sharp spines on them.... I'd never experienced that before.  But when I tried to bit into them, it actually hurt my mouth.  I cut off the tips and set them aside.  I  showed our server, and she offered to get me another vege, but I declined.  Maybe I should have stuck to my original idea of ordering one of their thin crust pizzas. The atmosphere is quite noisy and loud.  So unless you have a big mouth, you'd better sit close to your dinner companion so you can hear and have a conversation.  Of course, most of the diners I saw were staring at their phones. I'd come back, but definitely would order a different dinner.  The snickerdoodle pizzookie was great."
Will H.,"Corona, CA",16,211,,2.0,11/14/2016,"Hadn't been to this location since June, but had the late night munchies and Five Guys was already closed after the UFC fight.  Here is a brief run down on the good and the downright annoying: 1. As a single I was seated in the back section of the main dining room, but it appears no one had really been assigned to my table, as numerous servers wandered back and forth in front of me with none of them even bothering to ask if anyone had taken my order. When someone did actually notice me, she told me she was not really my server, but would take my order anyway.  How thoughtful.  She said the other server was too ""busy."" 2.  Started with a Watermelon/Basil Margarita that was so sweet and nasty tasting that I only drank a few sips. 3.  Ordered the Triple Decker sandwich which was indeed very good and MEATY. 4.  Fries came out stone cold!  Why does no once notice this fail?  Replacement ones were hot and yummy.  Who is supervising the line in the kitchen to make sure nothing goes out unless it is perfect? 5.  Ordered a large side of mayo for my sandwich and found an 8-inch piece of something purpleish in the bottom of the dish.  I mentioned this to my server, and shorlly a nice man arrived at my table asking what the issues were.  I can only assume he was a manager, but he never bothered to introduce himself.  WHY? To make a long story short, he took off 50% of the cost of my sandwich, but I still got stuck with the full tab for the nasty drink.....Not sure if I will be back until they lure me in with another coupon like in the past for $10 off on a $35 tab.....OR, their 2-for-1 entrees.....There are simply way too many places walking distance away, including Kings Fish House, Panera Bread, Buffalo Wild Wings, Romano's, Chilis etc. that all seem to have less challenges than I have experience over the years at BJ's. I WILL be back for BJ's FAB deep dish pizza happy hour, which is the best thing served there."
Crystal R.,"Corona, CA",1,49,42,4.0,7/17/2016,"Been here many times and the food and service have been great each time.  Last night was no different.  Had dinner with my husband and our two middles... Ordered the avocado egg rolls (our must have each time) and the potato skins.. We were too hungry and devoured both quickly.  Kids ordered small pizzas (great white and BBQ chicken) and we ordered the jambalaya and black and bleu burger.  My burger didn't have lettuce or greens to it.  It was my first time to order it so not sure if that's how it comes...(my opinion is all burgers should have lettuce).  The beer selection is decent (they need to up their ante) if they are gonna compete with Rock N Brews bar.... Love the monkey bread and pizookie!  Our server was great...  One other suggestion- during football season, please turn on the volume so we can watch football!"
Danny B.,"Corona, CA",558,1,,1.0,3/7/2017,"This has always been one of my favorite restaurants in the past, however, the speed of service and the amount of time it took to recieve our food this evening was horrible!  We actually had to cancel our movie reservations just to stay and finish our meal.   We sat down around 7:09 and our entrees didn't reach the table until 7:53. What was supposed to be a 40 min dinner, ended up taking an hour and 40 min.  After speaking with the manager, he apologized for the service and gave us 50% discount on 2 entrees ($14).  While I currently work at a restaurant, I know a $14 is a very small discount when trying to make a guest happy.  We eventually asked for our whole food ordered to be taken care of.  I have never taken the time to leave a review before, but this experience was awful.  Hope they can clean up their act soon."
Lora W.,"Corona, CA",108,85,357,4.0,11/16/2016,"Came here for lunch unexpectedly, it was busy but still able to eat at the bar.  I had a potato with chili and cheese, which was exactly how you would expect DELICIOUS.   The hubby had a black and blue burger, which was good (according to him).   Alexis E was our waitress, she was attentive and friendly and kept up with our humor.  We will be returning, of course"
Jesus Q.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",51,22,30,2.0,10/30/2016,"2-stars for the excellent servers, bartenders, and beer selection Minus 1/2 star for filthy restrooms Minus 1/2 star for the New Orleans jambalaya with fettuccini - very dry, no sauce, no flavor, over cooked seafood- really really disappointing. Minus 1/2 star for patio ambiance. No outdoor TV's.  Minus 1/2 star for Garlic Shrimp penne pasta -  very dry, no sauce, no flavor, over cooked seafood- really really disappointing.   We were a big group of 25.  Other people also complained about their food. Minus 1 star - The garlic chicken tavern cut pizza was actually not cut into pieces and was dry and over cooked... seemed to be the common trait for the evening.  Even the signature Pizookie was burnt!!! Consensus was - no more BJ's for our get togethers.  Hopefully our experience is just an anomaly."
Sergio C.,"Riverside, CA",0,2,,1.0,7/17/2017,I never got my ranch... I'm very disappointed my cheese pizza was not as scrumptious as it would have been with my precious ranch
Tiffany N.,"Riverside, CA",82,3,7,5.0,10/8/2016,Our server Mustafa was great! He was quick and made our dinning experience great! Everything came out perfect and exactly how we ordered! Definitely coming back and asking for Mustafa!
Michelle B.,"Corona, CA",0,4,,4.0,7/25/2017,What there for a beer and ended up having dinner. The food was good and the service was great. Definitely one of my go-to places
Sara Z.,"Desert Hot Springs, CA",38,3,,1.0,7/21/2017,First time here and I definitely won't be back!! The service was terrible drinks constantly empty never how's everything doin nothing bare minimum on the service. Found a long black hair in my salad my portabella mushroom was burnt sent it back and they bring me one that is cold so of course I send it back the third time it comes back it's still burnt and now I'm to the point of not wanting to eat. This is not somewhere I would want to come back to!!!
Diana R.,"Riverside, CA",7,6,,3.0,4/15/2017,Well we ordered BJ'S Favorite deep dish pizza. I was a little disappointed with the toppings. They barely put toppings on this pizza. Each piece I got had maybe one pepperoni piece. Not sure if I want to spend that money mainly on just veggies.
Rayzel M.,"Corona, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/1/2017,The hostess Adrianne is absolutely rude over the phone and continually intentionally hangs up the phone. Servers are otherwise pleasant but the front desk could use a little more politeness.
Charles N.,"Murrieta, CA",307,43,33,5.0,4/26/2016,Celebrating my Baby Girl's Birthday  The service and the food here are great. Chicago Style Pizza at it's finest in Cali.  If you're looking for a spot to take the whole family look no further than right here.  My good buddy Dave Is the guy that made this BJ's happen and has a tremendous staff here.  Stop in you'll be glad you did!!
Alexandria P.,"Chino, CA",81,54,13,1.0,5/22/2017,The service was alright. The ribeye was nasty. It was warm not hot. The steak I asked for it to be medium and it was medium well with NO FLAVOR. I couldn't even finish it. I wasted $23 bucks on a steak that I would of hoped to be cooked better. When we asked for a refill it didn't come till the end of the us eating.  Don't waste your time here.. find something that's same style but better quality. Very disappointed with this BJ'S
