Aj W.,"Corona, CA",0,10,,4.0,1/17/2017,BJ's has always had a special place in my heart service and the food is always tasty. I do realize the portion sizes have decreased and that is mainly due to the company itself taking on some debt and not producing enough income over the past year. It's hard to believe that such a great restaurant like this would have financial issues but they're very consistent in keeping their food tasting good. BJ's will bounce back I have no doubt about it.
Ruth M.,"South Lake Tahoe, CA",2,5,,1.0,5/29/2017,The worst customer service ever!!!!! Did not even bother to ask for a refill on our ice tea!!!!
Kelly C.,"Corona, CA",13,24,4,1.0,4/19/2017,"As a family we have always enjoyed this particular restaurant. However, my daughter went there for dessert. She is 16 with limited income, occasional babysitting job. So she knows what is in her account and where she uses it. With that being said, her card information was stolen. The person bought $130 worth of pizza and charges from another place when her bank called about suspicious activity. Since we knew where it was used, date and time we figured we could report it to the manager. We were never able to speak to him directly. The person on the phone took all of the information we had and said he would call. We made two follow up calls a couple of months ago. NEVER heard back. So if you eat there, be sure to check your bank statements afterwards."
Jackie S.,"Vista, CA",2,10,1,4.0,6/14/2017,"We have dined at different BJs locations in southern California and this location has been the best one. Our server was awesome!!!! I forgot his name, but he was great, my family and I enjoyed our time here, everyone was very nice and friendly. We came on a Sunday and thought there would be a wait time but upon entering we were seated immediately. Food didn't take forever and my kids also enjoyed it! Definitely coming back to this location over the other ones!!!"
Jonathan S.,"Riverside, CA",63,3,,4.0,6/13/2017,"Great service, very friendly. Ordered the Guacamole Bacon burger, would recommend. This location is also very helpful to all."
Brielle O.,"Corona, CA",3,19,,5.0,3/12/2017,"I sat on the patio with my boys this afternoon and Melina was our server, she was awesome. The patio continued to fill up and she stayed on top of refills, checking in on us while giving the same great service to the tables around us."
Stephanie L.,"Eastvale, CA",83,12,6,1.0,2/15/2017,"I love BJ's restaurants but sadly this isn't the best location to dine at. Put our name down they said it would be a 30 min wait. They ended up forgetting to call us to let us know our table was ready. They tried playing it off like we were the next people to be called but it was clear when the hostess came to ask for our name that they had forgotten us and plus all the other parties around us had also already been seated by that point. Food was good as it always is, but the customer service could definitely use improvements. From now on I'll just stick to my usual BJ's in Chino Hills where I know they won't forget about me!"
Blanca G.,"Upland, CA",1,1,,1.0,3/5/2017,"Waited 40 minutes,  they kept passing people that had just gotten there. Horrible service."
Robert A.,"Garden Grove, CA",190,9,,5.0,5/5/2017,Our waiter was Gabriel.  He did a good job helping us.  Our soda was flat we asked him to change it.  Homeboy was hella helpful.  Honestly just felt like saying something positive about someone. Haha gonna go watch Guardians of the galaxy 2. Peace
Clarissa A.,"Rialto, CA",94,6,1,2.0,9/15/2017,"So the hub and I decided to come out for dinner kid free. So he decided on BJ's. Good choice as we both have a number of options to choose from. To be safe we went with pizza. The pizza comes out with no cheese and no sauce. Essentially it was breadsticks with toppings. We ask to have the pizza remade. The waitress response was ""I didn't really want to leave that pizza at your table."" So in my head I think why did you. 20 minutes later a new pizza arrives. We still are charged full price and no manager even stops by the table. What has happened to customer service. Save your money and eat a frozen pizza at home. Kathryn was a great server but the food was of poor quality. If it weren't for Kathryn this review would have zero stars! Thanks Kathryn!"
Mayra A.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",53,33,45,2.0,2/16/2017,"My sister and I were the only ones waiting and when we walked in no one greeted us. We waited about 4 minutes until someone acknowledged that we were there. The food came out pretty fast and our server was amazing but the restaurant didn't seem organized. Specially, the area that's ""self seating""."
Denise W.,"Corona, CA",84,29,2,1.0,4/17/2017,"First time here. Food was very good. Some nice veggie options. Got the avocado egg rolls, salad and Brussels sprouts appetizer.  BUT- for a person in a wheelchair? NOPE! The place may be ""accessible"" but for us it was terrible! They took us all the way around to the far end and we had to go through the bar area (it was very busy and a full house on this day) the server who was taking us led us through but he did not help us get through the people. We were bumping into people!. We had to keep saying ""excuse me"" ""pardon me"" ""sorry"" and could not totally avoid bumping into people. It was terrible and humiliating. That was just to get through the bar with all seats FULL- People were sitting in these higher-up bar tables and seats. THEN we had to do the same thing going through the seating area and bumping into tables and people again. THEN we end up at a booth at the end of this row which is fine we like a booth but it had a step up so it was difficult to get up there for any wheelchair-bound person. (This was in December)      So by now it was a totally terrible and humiliating experience. I will NEVER go back. I wrote a letter a few days later (right after Christmas) addressed to the Manager telling them all about this and asking how would we get in here and to a good seat should we ever come back- In a wheelchair?? I never got any response. I did include my name address, email and phone number. SAD."
Srs A.,"Santa Ana, CA",2,6,9,3.0,4/15/2017,Cool people but needs to pay more attention to the restrooms. Cleaning wise other then that cool place.
Amy B.,"Upland, CA",0,32,14,5.0,4/11/2017,"Food and service here are always great. Love the bar area servers, especially Ashley who we've had twice now. She's always quick and brings you what you need before you have to ask for it. This place is one of our go tos, especially after they updated their happy hour!"
Maribel C.,"Corona, CA",8,6,3,1.0,8/18/2017,"Very disappointed! My family and I have been coming to this BJ'S for years. Their food and service has always been consistent. But last week  I had lunch here with my daughter, I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, but it was bland. Our waitress was very nice and engaging with both, my daughter and I, so I didn't make a big fuss. Today was a different story. Our waitress Kayla seemed like she could care less that we were there, even though it was 4:30pm and we were her only customers. But when we asked for our check, I mentioned to her that I had points in my Premium Rewards Card and I wanted to use them, which amounted to $25 off my check. She came back and said that I only had $5 or $10 off. I explained to her that was not correct and she told me there was nothing she could do. That she could only take the amount allowed by the computer. Well, my husband and I asked to speak to the manager and she said that it didn't matter,  that the manager couldn't do anything about it either. I asked her to give me a minute and come back. I proceed to check an email and my BJ'S app and when I showed her the amount of points her story suddenly changed. She entered my rewards card again and miraculously it worked! I never got the chance to speak with the manager. This girl was totally rude and condescending!"
Crystal N.,"Chino, CA",120,4,,1.0,9/15/2017,"I had the worse service! My 5 and 2 year old got served burnt mini corn dogs you couldn't even bite into it and it took forever for them to bring them back new ones. My food got cold waiting for my kids food and I had to ask for a refill twice. When the waiter was taking my order, he was staring at the football game screen above and had to have me repeat my order cause he wasn't paying attention. The manager took off both kids meals but still!"
Korosh S.,"Corona, CA",0,11,,1.0,6/22/2016,"Horrible service, dirty plates, weak drinks. Short and sweet. Food not bad, so I guess order & pickup to go, don't dine in."
Leon U.,"Ashland, OR",0,63,74,4.0,3/28/2017,"Got the gourmet 5 meat pizza. It was good but a suggestion would be to add more tomatoes sauce. The pizza at BJ's is really fluffy and cheesy, its almost like eating cheese bread with toppings. I give it this rating because of the good atmosphere and good food but there are room for improvements. The beer here is also 5$ plus for a pint so it's on the expensive side. Place is good to take a date."
L L.,"Corona, CA",0,3,,2.0,5/14/2017,"Had a fabulous server, BUT there was food on our silverware, we asked for different silverware and that was dirty!  We get our food and there was foil in my daughter's salad. Took too long to get the managers attention. They did take care of our bill, but would have rather had a good experience. Happy Mother's Day to me, I guess."
Sara M.,"La Mirada, CA",1,24,,5.0,3/26/2017,"LEO LEO LEO! I want to start with- I am a restaurant manager and have managed a couple restaurants. Leo might just be the BEST server I've encountered. As a guest, I've never had such amazing service. He was extremely personable and charismatic while remaining professional and taking care of our every need. He anticipated EVERY need, down to the napkins, steak sauce and even brought two flavors of iced tea because I couldn't decide. All without being asked! It's rare to find someone who cares so much about their guests as he does. He's a true gem in this huge hospitality world! BJs, you've got a good thing in Leo, take care of him! Thank you Leo for a special birthday dinner!!"
