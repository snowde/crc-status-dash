Kaitlin K.,"Brighton, CO",0,2,1,4.0,12/18/2017,"The deep dish pizza was absolutely amazing! So light and fluffy! Would recommend to anyone looking for a quiet place to eat, we came during the afternoon and it wasn't even busy."
Ashley M.,"Corpus Christi, TX",1,65,25,2.0,10/15/2017,"Cons :  Sold FROZEN fish as POKÉ , got to the table still extremely cold .   Shoe string sweet potato fries were not crispy at all ... dry and chewy?? How do you do that  Brussel sprout and kale salad was also very cold as if it wasn't made fresh but siting in the fridge and dressed w/o the option of dressing on the side  They just put some warmed up canned Alfredo sauce on an average sandwich  Pro: oddly the calamari was cooked perfectly"
G M.,"Corpus Christi, TX",6,118,61,2.0,9/29/2017,"Food was good, service was reasonable but i did have a few complaints.  This was my first time visiting this restaurant chain. I may have to try a few more times and update review but here are my issues from this visit. Wood floor was very slippery, I almost fell like greasy or something, over large areas not just one spot. The unsweet ice tea I ordered had just a few melted icecubes floating around and it was warm. More to come on the next visit."
Zohair C.,"Kingsville, TX",268,14,58,5.0,6/4/2017,"It was Sunday around 9.00 pm I was my friend and drove from kingsville and was really excited to eat here as it's been like 3 years haven't had chance to go eat at this place  So I went inside with her waited for host to get us seated all I saw was ignorance and all the staff who passed us totally ignored us then after waiting for 15 min I decided to leave I don't understand they were not even busy as a restaurant operator  I rarely get chance to go eat out and I should not deserve that  Update :) Gm invited us again and we were really satisfied server shanne took care of us and manager on duty easy , professional and polite will be back Pizza's were nice chicken was on little dry side but tasted good pizzokies were awesome"
Roseanna P.,"Corpus Christi, TX",0,4,2,5.0,8/6/2017,One of our favorite restaurants. The staff is always pleasant. Delicious food and great atmosphere!
Roberto G.,"Corpus Christi, TX",0,1,,4.0,10/20/2017,I ate the chicken club sandwich. Finished that and all my fries with one of their handcrafted beers. The time it took me to receive my meal was not a long wait at all (15-20min) consider I had two orders. Food was really good and filled me up. Kinda of a high price on the food but will be going back.
Kelly M.,"Iowa City, IA",0,50,,5.0,6/6/2017,"We were headed to Five Guys.  Last minute we saw BJ's and decided to stop since we can try Five Guys back home.  We are so happy we saw this restaurant.  My family enjoyed their meals.  My husband got the New Orleans jambalaya, my youngest got the spaghetti, and my other daughter and I shared the Chicken, Bacon, Ranch pizza.  The food came out hot and delicious.  The server was a young gentlemen, didn't remember his name.  He was very friendly and very attentive to our needs.   The restaurant and bathrooms were super clean. We would for sure return here if we didn't live many states away.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone.  It was fantastic!!!!"
Adam D.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,4,,5.0,10/9/2017,I ate here for the first time ..I had the Thursday ribs special..the food was amazing..the service was awesome..Matthew took great care of me and my friends..definitely will return.
Elissa M.,"Houston, TX",181,44,170,4.0,4/23/2016,"This place was good! I came here for my boyfriend's birthday and our waitress was very nice and friendly. She helped us navigate the menu and brought out a pizookie for him. We were also able to use the check-in discount to get $10 off our meal.  The calamari and spinach stuffed mushrooms were good, and we shared a medium deep dish 5 gourmet meat pizza. It was sooo tasty, but a little while after eating our stomachs were uncomfortable. I think it was a combination of too many slices and too much grease. Other than that, the food was great."
Kayla T.,"Corpus Christi, TX",190,134,434,5.0,4/25/2017,I love this place they have happy hour 5 to 7 they have great pizza variety of beers to choose from good seating and a rewards program to get discounts on food or free food and a different special every single day this place is one to keep in mind ! They specialize in deep dish pizza but their lettuce wraps or just amazing and eggrolls are truly delightful also their cookie cake thing is so good it's a dessert that's called a KOOzie I eat like a cookie pizza type thing but OMG it is to die for I would definitely try it and on Tuesdays it's only five dollars! And for joining the rewards program you get one free !
Niki B.,"Corpus Christi, TX",13,9,17,5.0,6/9/2017,Another great dinner! Never disappointed when leaving this restaurant. Service is always great. Drinks are always great. Food is the best! I will always recommend BJs.
Kalli K.,"Corpus Christi, TX",9,63,7,2.0,8/5/2017,Their cocktails are good buck the food is terrible. We ordered two salads and they were both really low quality and soggy. We spent 60$ on two cocktails a tea and two salads. It was ridiculous.
Justin B.,"Broken Arrow, OK",645,277,113,5.0,7/14/2016,"As always, BJs delivers with delicious foods and amazing brews.  I have yet to be to a lackluster location and- like edible Pokemon- I wanna catch 'em all. I see a lot of people who go to a BJs Brewhouse and order pizza with soda.  Don't do this.  Get something unique and unexpected, a few steps beyond their amazing burgers.  Try the Balsamic Chicken or the Jambalaya or any of the other amazing entrees.  If you're a little lost in the massive menu, look under specialties which are all on one page, conveniently.  There you will find Fish and Chips to pair with whatever desirable libation you have decided to have.  Check it out!"
Lindsey B.,"Columbus, MS",24,11,3,4.0,8/8/2017,"I've always been a fan on BJ's.. It is a little pricey but most of the time it's worth it. Tonight I tried the potato skins, tomato soup, and chicken Alfredo togo. The tomato soup was amazing, my favorite tomato soup in town! The chicken Alfredo was pretty good, but just a little to bland for me. And the potato skins I am sad to say are not good at all in my option, they are very dry and also lack the cheese and bacon topping. I can't wait to go back and try something else!"
Gil C.,"Spring Branch, TX",172,68,143,4.0,7/29/2016,BJ'S is always a treat. Join their mobile app and enjoy the many rewards.  Usually greatly discount entrees or appetizers and free desserts.   Accumulate points for even more discounts. Tonight. We're deemed a whopping $25 off the total ticket. Yay!
Kb K.,"Corpus Christi, TX",0,12,,1.0,8/3/2017,Ordered from online Pizza looked good from what the internet showed BUT looked nothing like what I thought dominos deeps dish nothing different but bjs is priced higher and burger was gross bread was stale Bacon was rawish.. Churros had no cinnamon sugar on it and tasted just like old grease... I rarely do reviews unless I really had a bad experience so yeah I would definitely not prefer BJ's....
Corpus Christi Vegan C.,"Corpus Christi, TX",0,19,21,4.0,2/18/2017,Kale and roasted Brussels sprouts salad was tasty. Just remember to ask for no goat cheese!
Jazmin R.,"Corpus Christi, TX",1,14,16,4.0,2/3/2017,"All i have to say is wow! The food was amazing and the place looks great! Our server provided the best service. He talked us threw the menu because it was our first time there and they have a huge selection of foods. I had the Deep Fish Baked Ziti although it was a little oily towards the bottom it still kept its great taste. My boyfriend ordered the Grilled Chicken Alfredo and he loved it. He had hoped it was a bit bigger. One thing I didn't love so much were the prices, everything is so expensive but i bet all those dishes are worth it just like ours were."
Robert S.,"Irving, TX",0,5,5,1.0,5/26/2017,Disappointed in the service we received.. Or didn't receive. Sat down for 15 mins and not one server came. We got up and left.
Connie W.,"Corpus Christi, TX",51,7,,5.0,7/5/2017,I just had a chicken Caesar salad but it was delicious! Wait staff real attentive but not overly so.
Tim V.,"Cedar Park, TX",19,257,133,4.0,4/9/2016,BJs is a great place to find consistent food with good beer This was on par and that's what I want out of a chain restaurants.   Now is everything on their menus amazing?  No but always decent.   This one had awesome service on the spot!  Hats off
Mrs. H.,"San Antonio, TX",5,202,901,2.0,2/28/2016,Jambalaya 3 stars- reminds me of something you buy and make from a box or already put together from the frozen section. Shrimp and asparagus penne pasta- bland not worth ordering. Wing appetizers- 5 stars  Chicken tortillia soup in a bread bowl - 5 stars   Customer service - 5 stars
Kat A.,"Austin, TX",35,68,34,5.0,2/12/2016,"I've been to a couple of BJ's and the environment is consistent and the food is really good.  The menu is a little overwhelming, but I think you could eat at BJ's every day for three months and have something different, so if you like variety, and like sports and big-screen TVs, this is your place.  It's also a great place for large parties and groups of friends. I'll also give two thumbs up on customer service.  We had an experience that prompted me to leave a one-star review, but I'm going to give BJ's and the location's manager a five-star rating for excellent customer service. The night we went in, someone had put a news station on that might not appeal to all customers, and we asked the server if it could be changed.  I think she wasn't sure how to handle that type of request, but told us it couldn't be changed.  I put this in my initial Yelp review, and was later contacted by a manager, Jesse, who was very apologetic.  I expressed my opinion that restaurants are usually an escape for people and that news stations with angry rhetoric is really distracting when you're trying to relax...BJ's is always a place where I can go to escape the stress of my day, so I feel that keeping the TVs tuned to sports is a best practice.  Jesse gave me an opportunity to talk about my concerns, reviewed the restaurant's policies, and addressed it with the staff, so I'm revising my review accordingly.   I think sometimes things happen, but when a company believes that customer service is important and works hard to make sure that customers are happy, they've earned a good review.  I am very appreciative that Jesse reached out, and we'll definitely be going back when we're in Corpus Christi again."
Tony S.,"Corpus Christi, TX",15,29,82,5.0,2/29/2016,We sat at the bar and the service was great. The bartender was busy but made us feel important. Jessie the manager was very nice and friendly and went out of his way to prepare a special appetizer for my birthday. Thanks to all. Tony S ******
Rebecca M.,"Vienna, VA",385,337,279,4.0,1/28/2015,"Fresh and delicious entree salads, California flatbread, and pizookies are just three little reasons BJs is on my ""go to"" list!   Despite being a chain restaurant, BJ's offers inspired and healthy creations made from quality fresh ingredients that keep bringing me back.  The roasted kale and brussels sprouts salad is my absolute favorite item on the menu, featuring lovely bits of tender chicken, crisp, piquant onion, salty pepita seeds, acidic and creamy goat cheese, sweet dried cranberries, and juicy purple grapes---all perfectly balanced with just the right amount of tangy dressing. It's truly a party in your mouth! Next on my go to list is the succulent California flat bread with bites of chicken, bacon, and avocado on warm, thin crust.  If healthful, savory offerings are not enough to bring you to BJ's, the dessert menu could make any patron smile with sugary delight. My personal favorite is the peach cobbler with sweet succulent peaches topped with flaky, warm crust. A close second is the pizookie, BJ's version of a deep dish baked cookie served still warm and soft in the middle and topped with ice cream.  The salted caramel variety would tempt even the staunchest dieter with its creamy, crisp, chewy, warm, frozen, cakey and sugary goodness all together."
Michele L.,"Boston, MA",4,32,1,5.0,4/10/2017,"Gluten free bun for the (bison!) burgers. Regular menu indicates gluten free options. Gluten free Berry cider. Gluten free cookie ( pizookie ) for dessert. I have celiac and when i do the usual spiel before a meal ""i need to eat gluten free because of celiac disease and not because I'm on a fashionable Hollywood diet. Oh and a nut allergy and a diary problem "" they have been very accommodating and don't back away in fear."
Jennifer G.,"The Woodlands, TX",25,1,,1.0,6/27/2017,We are visiting from out of town. Stopped here with out two kids (3 and 5) on our way home from the aquarium. Took our waitress about 10 minutes to even greet us and it was downhill from there. She was nowhere to be found for most of our visit and every time she came to our table she either forgot something or brought us the incorrect item. Food was terrible. We have eaten at BJs many times at home (The Woodlands) and this food was nothing close to what we've experienced before. Icing on the cake was a bug in my husband's beer. Gross.
Renee Bryan C.,"Dallas, TX",27,11,1,3.0,5/16/2017,"We visited Friday 5.12.17 about 10:00 PM for a late dinner to celebrate a college graduate. The service was SO slow!  The food, once we were finally served, was good, as usual, but good grief, slow, slow, slow service."
Mars B.,"Corpus Christi, TX",0,3,1,5.0,5/2/2017,"I have been here a few times with family. Which is awesome for me because I have Celiac's disease. Which means I have to eat gluten-free foods. Their Gluten-free protocols are outstanding. Their gluten-free menu options are very flavorful and filling. I order (to share, usally) their fresh mozzarella and tomato salad *it has a sweet balsamic drizzle on the plate*,  Tuscan tomato bisque soup (w/o croutons) it has very creamy texture, finish it with Fire-roasted barbacoa chicken entrée. Perfect balance of sweet, creamy and just a hint of spice. They even have a wonderful gluten-free ice cream cookie dessert. If I could give more than 5 stars I would."
Richard R.,"Lufkin, TX",5,5,,4.0,4/11/2017,Excellent Peruvian quinoa bowl. Chicken was over cooked but excellent flavor. The music absolutely sucks.  Loud corporate rock. May as well be in a Valero bathroom. Pm porter was great. Half price Elsa Malbec was wonderful. Change the music guys. Some guitar singer sound writers would be great. Try Some Jorma kaukonen
Larry P.,"Corpus Christi, TX",15,88,49,4.0,9/20/2016,Great service and food. Lots of TVs to watch your favorite sports  Healthy choices and delicious food.
Ray D.,"Little Rock, AR",735,739,2393,4.0,8/1/2014,"Had a birthday party here for my family. BJ's is holding it down in Corpus. The staff did an excellent job, service was great fast and friendly. The food came out quick, was served hot and had a great experience. They don't have the Red-bridge Gluten-Free beer which other locations do, so to me it was a shame, but the Woodchuck cider is always a good choice. Would come back with friends and family again. Great Job."
Lenny W.,"Corpus Christi, TX",30,5,,1.0,3/8/2017,"Supposedly they had the best blue cheese burger ever and it was awful, frozen patty and dry!! Best burger by far is still Pappas at Hobby airport, BJ's is overpriced and a typical ""chain restaurant"" that will disappear like ""ruby tuesday"", ""carrabas"" etc. below mediocre is an understatement"
Sara P.,"Corpus Christi, TX",263,32,325,4.0,6/10/2016,YES!!!!!!!!!!!! My mouth salivates at the thought of going back. i absolutely love the food here. I have never been disappointed with the food any any BJ's.  The pizza is absolutely DELISH! They have great desserts. It's the place to go if you have a large appetite. It is a little pricey but well worth it.  The restaurant's lighting is dark which I love. The ambiance is soothing and the staff never disappoints.
Frank I.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,30,6,5.0,7/4/2016,"Beautiful decor & building, the food is great you CAN'T go wrong here ordering anything!! Classy restaurant with casual atmosphere - you can wear anything you want. Great service. I had the BBQ Brisket Burger - was AWESOME!!"
Timmy L.,"Corpus Christi, TX",28,4,,5.0,3/1/2017,This is one of my absolute favorite places to eat. My favorite is the Jumbalaya and for desert the macadamia Puzookie. I think the best beer is the Jeremiah Red
Khian R.,"Universal City, TX",92,91,235,1.0,8/6/2015,Ok so the BJ's back home is awesome . This one here in corpus... Terrible! It took an hour for us to get our food and it was so cold my fries were hard and tasted old. Even our pizookies were cold the ice cream didn't melt. We hardly seen our waiter and took forever to get out checks. I usually have a good time here and enjoy good food and service but this was horrible. There was no apology from our waiter. At one point I had to look for him by asking other employees to find him for our table. When he came out with out drinks and sat them in another table my grandmother has to get up and get our drinks. I am seriously disappointed with the service I received here. I would have asked for a refund but it was close to midnight and my daughter was ready for bed. I
Bart F.,"Portland, TX",73,11,1,5.0,2/19/2017,"My family and I ate at BJ's Friday night   We had the best service (Alex) and the food was Excellent    After our pizza was delivered, the manager came by and said he was making us a new pizza as ""it wasn't up to his expectations""    The pizza looked really good to us!   Anyway the manager was awesome as we didn't expect this    We always have a great experience at BJ's and will continue to visit!"
Jeremiah G.,"San Marcos, TX",192,73,266,4.0,9/24/2014,Reverse happy hour is the bees knees. KEEP IT UP GUYS!!  Can y'all throw a in house movie night at the bar though. THAT WOULD BE COOL !!!
G N.,"Austin, TX",13,80,216,1.0,9/20/2016,"Where do I start? So, I'll start off by saying that the customer service wasn't as bad as the food, but, it wasn't good enough to get any repeat business from me. One and done. Started off by waiting 12 mins to get our drink order taken, then waited another 10 mins to actually get our drinks. A cucumber mint water and a water with lemon. Nothing complicated. Our waiter comes back and leaves after dropping off our drinks. I had mentioned to him that it was our first time and asked about a few diff beers but he didn't have any answers for me. Just shrugged and said, ""I don't know."" After another 10 mins he comes back and by this time, we're contemplating on just walking out but we decide we've already waited this long, it'd be such a waste of time to leave and find another spot for dinner since we've already invested 30 mins of our time. Our appetizer comes and that's when he takes our dinner order. By the way, it's a Tuesday night, they're slow. Gf ordered a burger with add ons and I had the chicken Alfredo. To sum it up, the burger and fries had such a bad aftertaste, my gf became physically ill afterwards. My chicken Alfredo reminded me so much of Michelina's frozen dinners. You know the one, ""gourmet meals"" in the frozen cooler at HEB selling for  .98 cents. We did speak to a manager but we had first talked to her about the server taking extremely too long and severe lack of personality, however, when we no one came back to ask about the check, I put the cash with the ticket and left. Never, ever, ever, again will I ever give this place any business. What a waste of $37 and that's cheap for a dinner visit, but no way I'd ever pay to eat here again. There's no excuse as to why the food and service were horrendous, but it's Corpus so, I get it. No excuse, but I get it."
