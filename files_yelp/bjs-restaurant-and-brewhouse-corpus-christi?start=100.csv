Julie W.,"League City, TX",1,99,,3.0,4/28/2014,"Visited last night. Not sure what all the hubbub is about.  1. Their customer service was actually 5 stars. The waiter was very nice. 2. We sat in a booth, but I didn't enjoy the guy sitting on the other side looking over the half fall to see what we're eating or listening to what we were saying. I almost said something to him, but thought better. 3. I'm only giving their food 3 stars.   Had chicken pot stickers w/ soy ginger sauce. Was ok, but I enjoy the California Pizza Kitchen's pot stickers a lot more. I ordered a Grilled Chicken Club w/ string fries, hubby ordered Bacon Cheeseburger w/ wedge-cut fries. The burger was too charbroiled for our taste and my sandwich was a bit dry. The toast was a bit too toasted for me as well. I would prefer Fuddrucker's burgers, to be honest. It's juicier and has more flavor. Would I visit this restaurant again? Most likely not. It wasn't anything special."
Erin M.,"Austin, TX",0,49,2,3.0,12/29/2014,Food is as expected. The curbside to go (I've used it 4 times now) is as long of a wait as eating in the restaurant itself... Not a timesaver so don't use it.
Jaclyn P.,"Corpus Christi, TX",59,41,36,4.0,10/27/2014,"One thing to know! Beer on Tap!!! Plenty to choose from! Really great atmosphere huge menu selection!  I have never been dissatisfied yet! I am with their rewards card program! It can be a little pricey but it's worth it! Cherry chipotle salmon is delicious, always order the tomato and mozzarella salad!  I've had the bison burger which is very great also!! Full size bar the liquor is up to the ceiling :). TVs for sports watching also!"
Miranda G.,"Corpus Christi, TX",0,3,,5.0,8/19/2015,"I LOVE BJ's brewhouse. I go here as often as I can, especially on my birthday. What attracted me to come here was the fact they offer gluten-free options. I have celiac disease, and they have always taken very good care of me while I'm there. My pizza comes out on parchment paper, and the ice cream for the gluten free pizookie is taken from its own separate thing (from my understanding). I've never gotten sick, so that's a plus! You can also get a free mini pizookie on your birthday. I'd recommend BJ's brewhouse to anyone, especially those who have celiac or gluten intolerance. :) Great service too."
Jackie T.,"North Pole, AK",40,9,3,2.0,1/1/2015,"Dirty dishes, I had to go and finally go and get the hostess so we could get drinks after sitting and waiting for 15 minutes (I set a timer) my youngest ordered apple juice and she didn't get that till about 7 min after we got our iced tea. So far VERY VERY poor service. Well it didn't improve! The food was cold, I ordered chicken wings, and they were dry, sauce came in a little tiny cup. My youngest got spaghetti and we had to ask for more sauce, not our waitress, just one hat was walking by because ours was nowhere to be found for about 10 minutes. I will NEVER come here again."
Daniel R.,"Corpus Christi, TX",71,2,1,1.0,12/3/2014,The food was flavorless nasty and not worth what you pay for don't waste your time here...
Nate C.,"Corpus Christi, TX",1,4,2,3.0,8/12/2014,"I'm a big fan of BJ's brewhouse, delicious food, laid back atmosphere and a excellent selection of drinks. However the one constant from BJ's is their poor service. I can say I've been to BJ's over twenty times since it opened last year and come to expect long waits.  Excluding the pizza and appetizers I personally don't enjoy the other menu items as they tend to be bland. The menu is quite overwhelming with choices ranging from steak, burgers, seafood and almost anything you would expect for chili's.  Inside of the restaurant is stunning, beautiful paintings and big screen tvs surrounding the customers. Inside the bathrooms are usually disgusting,BJ's installed the toilets too close to the floor and theirs always ""puddles"".  Overall, BJ's brewhouse is a great place to eat and enjoy beer and pizza. Don't expect to get in and out under and hour."
Linda G.,"Corpus Christi, TX",0,17,7,1.0,2/28/2015,Silverware was dirty. Menu was greasy. They dropped the vegetarian burger. Waiter was nice but it shouldn't take 5 minutes to get your water. I think they had to catch the fish.  Husband was half way through his Asian chicken salad before it came out. Fish and fries were beyond greasy. Think I may use the fish to bait a feral cat trap for trap neuter release. After I take off the breading.
Cheri S.,"Corpus Christi, TX",29,7,5,1.0,11/9/2014,Love the one in San Antonio.    Clean!  Friendly!   However Corpus Christi's rest rooms getting dirtier and dirtier.  Service so-so.  Came in for beer and burger.   Tables dirty.  Waitress's standing around not helping or serving.   Talking!   We had to ask a server to clean a table so we could sit in the bar area.   Maybe 10 people in the Resturant and it's 12:12 pm.  Typical for Corpus.     Sad.
Terry W.,"Corpus Christi, TX",0,7,,1.0,11/16/2015,"Lame. Worst Deep Dish pizza I ever ate, a better name would be ""Deep Crust"" pizza.........Deep dish pizza does NOT mean a pizza with a 2 inch thick CRUST! I'm guessing a franchise headquartered in California doesn't know much about pizza where Little Ceasar's seem to rule in most cities there."
N L.,"Corpus Christi, TX",0,5,,5.0,2/12/2016,We love this place!  Great variety of food and very fast service.  5 stars!  The deep dish ziti is heavenly
Claire C.,"Memphis, TN",0,11,,4.0,1/31/2015,The applewood smoked bacon cheeseburger and fries were delicious! As was the beer on draft. Service needed much improvement but hopefully he was not the norm.
Outtellect G.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,27,,1.0,9/17/2015,Weakest pizza in Corpus! Go home!!!! Booze is keeping this place alive. Nothing unique here and nothing worth trying.
Josh S.,"Corpus Christi, TX",5,62,2,5.0,12/15/2014,"Quite possibly one of the best, if not the best in Corpus Christi. Chain or not, this place does service and food at an excellent style.  Courteous and polite with good food. Definite return visit needed often."
Billy G.,"McAllen, TX",0,58,,3.0,4/21/2015,"Food was ok, drinks were ok, service was ok.  Bathrooms looked dirty.  We will probably be back if visiting the area again."
Marge D.,"Corpus Christi, TX",1,3,,5.0,2/11/2016,"Matt made us feel welcome. Food was great, drinks were perfect We go to BJ's at least once a week knowing the service will be fast and efficient, and food consistently good"
Rosa L.,"Corpus Christi, TX",12,46,57,1.0,9/19/2015,"Now I usually love this chain, however Wednesday night was horrible. First off, they were not even busy, let me just start with that. We had to change tables 3 times due to the fact that the tables are so filthy we couldn't even sit down. The service was beyond slow, in fact we thought they had forgot to tell somebody we had changed tables.  The waiter was so slow that every time he brought our drinks they were really warm. The company is known for their beer so why would they ever serve them warm. Even our food came out all wilted and dried out. None of her food was all that great. Really keep in mind I love this restaurant, their ever avocado rolls are usually some of the best I've ever had. However, when they're all dried out and will team grows not so appealing especially when they start to brown. The pasta headset for so long that was all dried out on top and all the Parmesan was sitting there almost choked to death trying to eat it it was so dried out. I just believe that their quality is really really sleepy now that they've been established in corpus a while. Hopefully, in the future management might come visit this establishment and try to get back on track.  Because I have been to other BJ's and they're pretty good, this one use to be. Highly recommend the chain but not in Corpus Christi."
Liz B.,"Weston, CT",112,57,17,4.0,5/13/2014,"I had heard of this place, but didn't realize it was a chain restaurant. Excellent service and I observed a lot of team work amongst the staff (always great to see that). Place was packed and took us awhile to get through a large menu. Servers were plentiful and ours was really on the ball. The food here is very good! I had the sliders and they were delicious and cooked perfectly. My co-worker had the fish taco and he said they were delicious. We end the night with one of the best desserts on the planet, a pizookie! A deep dish cookie topped with ice cream. The only disappointment was that the beer was not being brewed on site, although they brew their own root beer, which is amazing!!  I was in Corpus for two weeks on business and this was by far one of the best restaurants I visited! I would highly recommend this restaurant because of its great food and the amazing selection of craft beers on tap!!"
Willy R.,"San Antonio, TX",21,10,,4.0,9/27/2014,"Pizza and beer, plain and simple.  Pizza was very good,  and the selection of beer was impressive.  The decor is nothing special,  but that's really the only negative."
Michael L.,"Austin, TX",48,15,1,2.0,8/31/2014,"Came here with the family after a day out and about. 35 minutes after ordering our appetizer showed up - after I reminded the waiter. Oh, and my salad I ordered with my main after the drinks showed up showed up 15 minutes before the appetizer. Food is great as always after waiting 45 min but give yourself time because they are not interested in serving you in any reasonable amount of time. They said its hectic in the kitchen so that is why it is slow but there are no real sporting events and the place is 2/3rds full so while I appreciate the explanation it doesn't mean I have to like it."
