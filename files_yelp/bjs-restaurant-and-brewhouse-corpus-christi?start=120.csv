Keil A.,"Alpharetta, GA",2,26,,5.0,10/1/2015,"Wow. Great beer list that actually comes with great food. Service quick despite the crowd. Their pizza is a light version of Chicago style, very airy crust. Try the beignet and ice cream dessert. Awesome."
Chris E.,"Corpus Christi, TX",0,6,,1.0,4/26/2014,"Me and my wife have been wanting to try BJ's since they opened and finally took the plunge this afternoon. First, we ordered the Lettuce Wraps appetizer and we got 4 extremely small, unassembled lettuce wraps.  Eating them was an outright mess leaving food on the table and sauce on our shirts.  Flavor was good though.  We were left with sticky fingers from the sauce and asked for wet wipes and were told they didn't have those and gave us more napkins, which didn't remove the stickiness. Flavor was okay on the appetizer so we had better hopes for the entree.  We both ordered the Southern Fried Chicken that came with white cheddar mashed potatoes, corn and white gravy.  The two pieces of chicken on each of our plates had absolutely no flavor other than grease.  There was no salt or pepper used on the chicken, or any other seasoning for that matter.  Meat and bland, unseasoned batter and nothing more.  The potatoes were obviously powdered and had a bitter taste to them, which I found very contradictory being served at a ""hand crafted"" Brewhouse.  The corn was frozen and had obviously been sitting for several hours because it was complete mush.  The cream gravy had only a slight cream taste.  We tried to use the salt and pepper shakers on the table to add some much needed flavor to the food, but both were clogged.  We asked for replacements, which were both also clogged.  We opened them up to find that it appeared they have been wiping the inside of the top of the shaker with a wet rag, thereby clogging every salt and pepper shaker they have.  The also clogged replacements were handed to me by a manager as well. I normally never post negative reviews on restaurants, but the food lacks even basic cooking principles.  The lettuce wraps were a complete mess and minuscule for the $11 they cost.  These 2 piece fried chicken plates were $12.50 each and everything on the plate lacked any flavor at all other than the bitter taste from the powdered mashed potatoes and slight cream taste from the white gravy. We won't be returning, which is sad, because I had hoped to sample their beer selection in the future.  This was an expensive lesson in bad food for us."
Derek W.,"Corpus Christi, TX",3,12,5,2.0,9/9/2014,"I'm a big fan on consistency, and so far I havent seen it at BJ's.  1st experience was great...most recent was not great.  Slow service and mediocre food at best.  Their home brews are the only thing keeping me coming back."
John A.,"Southeast Austin, Austin, TX",0,1,,4.0,8/29/2014,"Inexpensive lunch menu, good brew, and excellent wait staff. That was my experience at BJ's today. I would highly recommend it."
Chris D.,"Corpus Christi, TX",3,21,,4.0,1/19/2014,"This place started off a little rough when it first opened. But after a few months they are Definatly on the way up. Excellent home craft beer.  Highly recommend the "" PM Porter"", goes great with their Poke appetizer."
Herman A.,"Corpus Christi, TX",8,5,1,5.0,3/6/2014,"The food is very good. If you decide to head over there, try the buffalo wings and a deep dish pizza. You won't regret it. It also has the largest selection of draft beer in Corpus Christi so that's a huge plus in my book."
Robert P.,"Corpus Christi, TX",10,15,,2.0,11/16/2013,"Order was screwed up, and food was only ok. Dessert took 40 minutes to arrive. Will not return soon, but will give them another chance in the future."
Andrew H.,"Buchanan, MI",2,38,50,5.0,4/12/2014,"Bj's is off the charts and this location is no exception! Home brewed sodas on tap! Incredible deep dish pizza. My favorites are buffalo chicken and the great white! The pastas are also phenomenal. There is not a thing that I have ordered there that isn't good. End the night with one of the best desserts on the planet, a pizookie! A deep dish cookie topped with ice cream. My favorite is the peanut butter or macadamia white chocolate. They will let you do a combo. This place is consistent. Try it!!"
Robert A.,"Corpus Christi, TX",1,2,,1.0,9/6/2014,"The worst wait and service I have ever received. 1 hr wait for a table of 7, while tables sat empty and people with groups of 4 were sat right away. 30 mins for first drink order to arrive. 45 mins before salads were served. 2 hours before food arrived. Will never go back."
Sharkie C.,"Metairie, LA",41,4,1,5.0,4/10/2014,"Service was awesome, our server Clarissa was very knowledgable about the beers on tap as well as the food. I had the avocado rolls, tomato & fresh mozzarella salad, deep dish pizza and salty caramel pizookie. All was great, definitely will come here every time I'm in town"
Kathy T.,"Cameron, NC",10,15,4,3.0,7/10/2014,"Parmesan Crusted Chicken is amazing! White cheddar mashed potatoes are fantastic! Pizookie is the best!! Ate here three times on business/vacation. I would have given them 5 stars, but after the first visit our service went down drastically!  The wait just for them to take my carry out order was over 8 minutes and the server on our last trip took too long to get our drinks/order in and never cleared our table of plates."
Grant L.,"Richibucto Road, Canada",1,134,2,4.0,4/24/2015,"Awesome pizza and nice dive feel to the place! I lived in Chicago for a good portion of my life, so I think I can be a little snooty when it comes to pizza. This stuff is LEGIT! Don't pass it up!"
Randall S.,"Corpus Christi, TX",127,137,,5.0,10/12/2013,"Found this place with my wife back in 2003 in Laguna Beach, CA and ever since it has been one of our favorite places to go' the pizza is delicious and some of the beers are great. Some not so much. The reserve blonde stout that they have right now is next level deliciousness!"
elijah g.,"Fairfield, CA",0,19,6,3.0,2/27/2014,Nice atmosphere comfortable seating. Overall this restaurant is best for its beer. Food is ok nothing special. However I did really enjoy the avocado egg rolls app!! 11$ though. Friend ordered a pizza said it had the quality and taste of a totinos frozen pizza. The crust did look burnt in my opinion.
SparklingCity C.,"Corpus Christi, TX",24,14,,5.0,2/17/2014,Love this place!  I first tried it in the SA area then they opened up here!!! Couldn't of been happier!!! Great desserts too!!
David B.,"Corpus Christi, TX",0,2,,5.0,4/12/2014,Exceptional service....wait staff is well trained. Have eaten at this location four times and have  received consistent good service and food.  Highly recommended for a relaxing dining experience.  Everything from the apps to entrees to deserts are good.
Kyle O.,"Corpus Christi, TX",9,61,60,5.0,10/10/2013,"We just came to Corpus from San Diego and are super excited that BJs followed us out here!  They brew their own beer and it's pretty tasty.  Get the Cheese Burger Pizza! It's not on the menu, but if you know what an In n Out burger tastes like, you'll wanna give it a try!"
Jay S.,"Corpus Christi, TX",0,12,,5.0,10/11/2013,"Went to dinner there last night and it was great. The wait time for your table was quick. The service was excellent. The Oktoberfest Beer was a good choice to drink. Also, the stuffed mushrooms were amazing as an appetizer. The waiters were great and they have this VIP program which we signed up for so we can get discounts and we won't have to wait in line for a table in the future. The food did take a while to get to us but it was due to the place just opening and it was packed. I had the Bold Bleu Flatbread Pizza and my wife had the Biscotti Chicken and it was great. Plus the bar area is huge. They also had the football game on all the t.v.'s they had spread out all over the place. Overall was a great experience and i recommend this place to everyone. I definitely will return there."
Laura M.,"San Antonio, TX",0,4,,1.0,1/3/2015,Called ahead for a 6:45pm dinner. We were finally at our table at 8:00pm. Waiter forgot one persons order-apologized and gave us free dessert. The servers didn't bring another order.  Love all the San Antonio locations-do not hold the Corpus service against other BJ Brewhouse locations. Very disappointed today.
Eric P.,"Daphne, AL",3,27,2,3.0,11/10/2013,"I'm told this restaurant just opened in Corpus.  The locals are flooding it because it's new.  Food was good, but today's Sunday crowd was more than the staffing model could handle."
