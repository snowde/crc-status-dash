Ann K.,"Corpus Christi, TX",0,12,2,2.0,12/7/2013,Music is way too loud!!  We asked them to turn it down a bit!  We like good music and I like loud music but not when I'm trying to dinner with friends.
Cookie N.,"Corpus Christi, TX",0,42,3,3.0,11/29/2013,"After hearing my Aunt rave about the root beer at BJs Brewhouse in Austin, I decided to try out the one here. I believe it just opened up a few/months/weeks ago. As we got to the entrance, we were greeted by our server, and given a good amount of time to choose what we liked. I chose the handcrafted root beer along with the chicken bacon ranch Pizza ( i think I got the smallest size they had, worrying about how much I could eat). Out came my drink! Our server notified me that they ran out of their normal straws, but gladly offered me a bendy yellow kids straw (meh, better than no straw!). I took a sip; it was way too sweet for my taste, or rather than any other generic root beer, but oh well. My pizza was out after maybe 15-20 minutes later. I took a bite of that; it tasted more salty than a pizza should be, but it was still quite edible. Our server was great, but please balance out the tastes in your food and drink."
Andrew D.,"Hollywood, FL",0,12,,2.0,5/20/2014,"Hate to give a 2-star review on this place. From Oklahoma and have dined at BJ's several times and know its success. Wife and I were vacationing in CC and stopped by for lunch. The waitress we had was terrible. She was polite, but it appeared she frequently forgot she was servicing our table. The only thing she did the whole time was initially say ""Hello"" and took our drink and food order. Our drinks were delivered by another staff member, our food was delivered by another staff member, and refills were provided by another staff member. To put in perspective how absent our waitress was - she stopped by and asked if we were ready for dessert before we even got our lunch. Come on now!Additionally, I ordered a hand tossed thin pepperoni pizza - i haven't even eaten a greasier pizza at Dominoes or Little Caesars! Certainly wouldn't expect it from a highly rated place like BJ's. My crust was so soggy the pizza literally drooped down from the grease. Highly recommend BJ's, just a bad experience"
Michael G.,"Corpus Christi, TX",0,4,2,5.0,7/26/2014,My wife and I had a very good experience at the restaurant. We had at pizza appetizer and we order a island sunset and the Jeremiah red. The Jeremiah red was delicious as was the island sunset mix drink. Overall the whole experience was a delight and we will most definitely be going back.
Truth F.,"Corpus Christi, TX",4,13,1,3.0,4/14/2014,Our waitress was horrible.  My food came out very burnt and when I sent it back it was forgotten. I was there with several of my girl friends and they had all finished their dessert when I asked if my meal was coming.  Then our waitress just seems annoyed with us.  After a while I stopped asking/explaining everything to my waitress and when we were leaving I spoke to the Manager. She was very nice and understanding.  She refunded me my money and apologized.
Jay K.,"Corpus Christi, TX",0,4,,1.0,7/3/2014,"Horrible place.   Went there with some friends when they first opened and everything seemed fine.  Food was ok but ambience was good.  Since then it has been downhill.   Went with whole family, 30 minutes to order, another 45 min for food to arrive.  Wife's food burnt and dry (chicken).  She ended up taking pizza to go.   Had to ask to take the burnt chicken off the bill!  Incredible.  Stupidity and short memory made us go there again, this time just myself and my wife.  Again, had long wait just to order food on a not so busy Thursday.  When food arrived, potato skins were cold, dry, with just tiny amounts of cheese.  Returned the potato skins and my wife had just the Pepsi.   No apology offered.  Will NEVER return again.  We are not terribly picky people but do expect some minimum standards and at least a visit from manager and or comp the Pepsi would have been a nice gesture.  We own 3 businesses locally and would never treat our customers like this.   Unfortunately, corpus is one of those places where locals will flock to any new place even with bad food or service.  Only good thing about this place is they have some good beers.   Stay away."
