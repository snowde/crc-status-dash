Mark A.,"Corpus Christi, TX",55,79,10,3.0,8/20/2016,Good place for lunch. Very expansive menu which I am sometimes leery of. More choices doesn't always mean  good in a restaurant. However it works here.  Our food was well prepared and delivered to our table nice and hot. Everything tasted as good as it looked.  Service was great! And that is something that is always sketchy in Corpus Christi. Great beer selection! I recommend you try something new while you are here.  I recommend this restaurant.
Tom H.,"Corpus Christi, TX",51,172,95,4.0,9/7/2015,"First time to BJ's.  Labor Day and it wasn't crowded.  I kinda thought that they'd be busy on everyone's day off.  Bad sign?  Well, based on our visit, it's hard to understand why they weren't swamped at lunch time.  The place is super clean, the atmosphere is very nice and the service was great.  We both ordered 1/2 rack of ribs and loved 'em.  Ribs are typically finger food, but these were so tender that you basically just pulled the bones out and then eat the slab of meat with fork and knife.  The BBQ sauce complimented and highlighted the flavor of the meat instead of overpowering it.  The side were cooked to perfection.  Nothing was over-seasoned or salted. TVs everywhere, comfortable seating, music not too loud...just a very pleasant visit.  We'll be back.  Lots of beers that they brew...have to try a few of them, don't you?  That and pizza sound like a nice second visit."
Saush B.,"Corpus Christi, TX",0,9,1,2.0,6/27/2017,The pizza was nasty. My jalepeno margarita was unable to drink! So spicy!! Sent it back.
Lisa R.,"Corpus Christi, TX",3,30,,4.0,5/20/2017,"The pizzas are really good.  Prices are a bit high.  It's a great place, obviously, for those that drink.  Unlike other places, they are welcoming to those that do not."
Luis T.,"Southeast Side, San Antonio, TX",45,2,,3.0,9/17/2017,"I previously visited BJs a couple of years ago for a birthday celebration. Being that we we were in town for a mini getaway and the fact that the kids were in the mood for pizza I decided to stay away from your typical affordable pies and go with a pizza that had some presentation. As soon as we were sat, we were greeted by our waiter who made no recommendations on drinks so I decided to try something on my own that I didn't end up liking. No biggie, I chalked it up to experience and asked if I could have a different drink. The waiter obliged and for the next 15-20 minutes the previous drink sat at the edge of our table without being picked up. Behind us was another table that had not been cleaned and so I proceeded place that drink I did not like, on the dirty table. 10 minutes after ordering our food, a waiter came out with two bowls of spaghetti. While we did order them, one was ordered with sauce on the side and the other with meatballs, both came out prior to the rest of our food and both dishes were just noodles and sauce. No problem, sent them back. When my waiter was asked for the whereabouts of our beer, he had a perplexed look on his face as if he had forgotten altogether. Again, no problem just a little irritated. When our food finally arrived, the deep dish pizza that had been ordered looked as if it had been sitting out for a while. The cheese while melted was no longer stretching and the toppings had arrived cold. At about this time I was just done. The experience itself discouraged me from asking for a manager because I felt that I was just maybe simply asking for too much out of a place I visited years before. Maybe I'll visit a BJs restaurant again or maybe I won't. Either way, I probably should have just played it safe and gone with the affordable pie next to our hotel. At least then I would have paid 90% less for what I would have spent there."
Richard E.,"Cedar Park, TX",0,184,,3.0,4/28/2017,It took almost an hour to have two appetizers prepared! Not cool.  But overall the food was good and the beers on tap is what makes this place.
Monica P.,"Seattle, WA",44,12,2,5.0,7/26/2016,"So far every experience I've had at BJs has been good. We usually go for lunch and we sit in the bar. The wait staff is really nice and they have a nice selection of beer on tap (not just the local standard bud light).  They have lunch specials on drinks and food. I usually get an IPA or Porter and one of their fit lunch menu items. The Salmon and the Seared Tuna Salad are amazing. My husband loves their Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos (also on the fit menu) so he orders them every time. I will continue to go back as long as I can get IPAs on tap and they have a super delicious low cal menu. Honestly, if you like healthy & interesting food, I'd  definitely recommend this place. If you're looking for something fried and with gravy, you could probably please that crowd too."
Erik G.,"Converse, TX",68,6,,4.0,11/23/2016,Delicious food as always. Service was very good from the moment I walked in. My tea wasn't the best but over all I had a great experience!
Bruce W.,"Corpus Christi, TX",0,19,,5.0,5/24/2017,Awesome service.  Awesome food.  Love their selection of craft beers. Consistent repeat customer.  Love how they get ur rewards info up front!
Scott Y.,"Austin, TX",104,221,546,2.0,12/4/2015,"Ok food, with lazy uninterested servers.  Here are the reasons why they get 2 stars: 1.  The menu is way too big 2.  The server, especially today was lazy, messed up my order and was unapologetic. 3.  The food is meh 4.  The food is overpriced for what you get, pre-processed food."
Angelica P.,"South Side, Corpus Christi, TX",52,6,2,3.0,5/11/2017,I didn't think anyone could screw up a salad..... the chips and guacamole is good. Very fresh
Lou C.,"San Antonio, TX",35,114,765,4.0,3/18/2015,"My dinner was good,even though service level was slower than usual. I can understand that restaurants sometimes have staffing issues & other factors that can affect service. For that reason, I wasn't overly critical. I did appreciate that a member of management acknowledged the long time it took to get my dessert served. I still enjoyed my meal & dessert."
Colleen T.,"Duluth, MN",0,8,,5.0,3/29/2017,This was our first time there but certainly not our last. The service was fast and friendly. I had the turkey burger and husband had special house burger. Both were huge and delicious. Nice atmosphere.
Edward S.,"Corpus Christi, TX",100,267,245,4.0,10/6/2013,"We were fortunate enough to attend the ""soft opening"" of BJs and so glad we did!  We'd never been to one - heard a lot about them, though. Now, I'm not a beer drinker, but our friends have been introducing us to ""crafted"" beers and BJs is the BEST place to sample those.  They actually have a sampler of 4 beers (similar to a ""flight"" at a wine bar).  You can go light or dark.  We did both. My favorite, though, is their own ""Oktoberfest"" dark beer.  GREAT flavor and I can tell I'll be a fan of beer from now on. They had a limited menu for the soft opening - starting off with an appetizer of spinach and artichoke dip with multicolored tortilla chips.  EXCELLENT!  The dip was creamy, hot, VERY tasty with chunks of artichokes.  Their entrée choices were the seared ahi tuna salad, a steak and bleu cheese flatbread pizza, a ""Maui glazed"" pork chop and a roasted turkey breast sandwich.  We tried them all and shared.  The standouts were the tuna salad and the flatbread pizza!!  Get an order each of those and it makes for an amazing dinner for two.   The sandwich was just a sandwich; nothing too thrilling there.....well, except for the seasoned wedge fries that came with it.  The pork chop had a great flavor but was a little tough.   The service is as impressive as the atmosphere.  Of course, this again was their soft opening so everyone's on their toes.  But, we still had a very good experience for our first time at a BJ's Brewhouse and Restaurant.  We look forward to going back soon."
Gerri C.,"Elkridge, MD",1,16,5,1.0,12/10/2015,Waited 15 minutes for a waitress to acknowledge that I was sitting at a table alone... asked if I was helped. I said no... she said she would get someone... um no thanks there are plenty of restaurants on the block that will be happy to wait on one person.  Not a great spot for a traveling sales lady that is for sure! ( Macaroni Grill was very happy to wait on me!)
Donnie E.,"Corpus Christi, TX",0,18,2,1.0,7/29/2015,"Many times I find myself wondering into a BJ's restaurant because I am a sucker for the rootbeer and pazookie. After visiting the Corpus Christi location a few times I decided that it is not worth visiting again. I will break down my last 2 visits: I came in with my brother. We ordered a simple pizza and I got their watermelon starter salad. As it was a starter salad I figured it would come out before the pizza. Well I asked my server after 30 minuets about my salad and she promised me it will arrive before the pizza did. 5 minuets later no salad, pizza at the table. The pizza should have been a pepperoni and pesto pizza with tomato sauce. Well, no pepperoni and no sauce.  Just cheese and pesto. I told my server (who still had yet bring out my salad) and she told me she will bring out a bowl of pizza sauce and I can dip my pizza in it. That is not ok for a $21.00 pizza. Asked for a manager and he said the same thing. I told them I no longer wanted anything and I left. The whole experience took 1 hour. This last time I only came in and ordered a pazookie (I was too weak to avoid the appeal of cookies and icecream) well I sit down and order that and my rootbeer. My server saw I was only planning on spending around 9 dollars. And stopped serving me. 45 minuets pass and no pazzookie. And when it does come out the cookie is cold and there is only a pool of ice cream on top. I told the food runner (a larger Mexican lady with red hair) and she said ""oh well"" and walked away. I let a manager know and he said it didn't set at all (yeah right!) after another 20 minuets I finally got it. And still was not good. Oh well I will not be back anytime soon."
Teodoro S.,"San Antonio, TX",9,64,134,5.0,11/10/2015,"My first time here.  I really like the design and decor .  I was surprised by the size of the interior.  The bar is amazing!  I came for dinner on a weekday.  I ordered the queso &  chips for an appetizer.  I couldn't choose from the wide variety of dishes.. I love deep dish pizza and I had to try it.   Our server,  Valeria was awesome!   She had our drink order filled fast and kept up with the Margaritas.   She brought the appetizers quickly and kept my sweet tea filled.  The food did take long because of the deep dish and it was worth waiting.  I will have to come back to try more dishes!"
Erin F.,"Corpus Christi, TX",58,2,,1.0,8/14/2016,Service was horrible here.  It takes forever to get your food.  The server never ask to fill my drink up.   Then when i got my food it was cold.  I assume because they probably let it sit there until they brought it to me.
Mike G.,"Corpus Christi, TX",29,6,3,2.0,7/18/2016,"Beer is good, service is terribly slow. It's Monday at 5:00 pm and we're waiting way too damn long for two appetizers: quest and chips, flatbread pizza that came cold."
Mary L.,"Corpus Christi, TX",48,2,1,5.0,7/13/2016,"Excellent Food, Great Beer Selection & Service is Always Above & Beyond! Keep up the Fabulous Work!"
