Lexi S.,"Lake Villa, IL",0,5,2,4.0,7/13/2016,"Came here while on vacation and it was great! The menu is very large, so they have something for everyone. Even a small gluten free section! The service was prompt. The only issue we had was when my mom commented the homemade soda was too sweet, the server said, ""yeah I know it is really sweet"" and never asked if there was anything else she could get her. Other than that everything seemed fine, the building looks very nice and we all ordered piadinas and they were quite good. Overall, a fine place to dine and we would go back again!"
Mamajay D.,"Corpus Christi, TX",0,18,,2.0,1/27/2016,"Bleh service. Bad food. I have given this place a few chances and every time, it never fails my order is wrong or they ""forget"" to get our drinks from the bar. I've been to a few BJ's north Texas and this one is nothing like them. Very disappointed."
Ben B.,"Corpus Christi, TX",0,7,1,5.0,6/12/2016,Outstanding food and great Staff! Will definitely go back! Ribs were AMAZING! Great drink specials and selection! My favorite Americana restaurant in Corpus!
J F.,"Houston, TX",1,169,31,2.0,2/12/2016,Poor food and very poor service. Nice and old too. Not very impressed with the service. I think I'll go to Taco Bell instead.
Jimmie R.,"Cibolo, TX",44,282,35,2.0,12/20/2015,"I've been to a few BJ's. It's the only chain I've been willing to eat at more than once. The food is good and the service is usually decent. This particular restaurant had good food. But the service was barely adequate.  Our server was clueless about what beers they had, took forever to even get our drink orders, and longer to get our food orders (a real problem when you've got a 3 year old with you.) The table behind us seemed to be getting the same service. But when they left,  a group of younger people sat down and they received far more attentive service. Here's a clue, kid - I'm guessing the younger table tipped you a lot less than we would have for good service. You weren't bad enough to stiff, but I certainly wasn't giving you more than the minimum.  Beer selection wasn't very good. And their seasonal chocolate raspberry porter was nasty. I stuck with their stout. The food was as expected. Good burgers and appetizers. If the service had been better,  we'd come back."
Rasta R.,"Corpus Christi, TX",96,14,14,5.0,1/31/2015,"Real nice and clean! Bathrooms are amazing and have someone attending, drying counters, and make sure you have what you need before returning to your table! I personally think that was nice!"
Rita R.,"Oklahoma City, OK",32,51,,3.0,3/21/2015,Food was tasty. Our waitress wasn't bad but the manager wasn't on point. A teenager I had with me chipped her tooth on something in the burger patty. After waiting for 15 mins the manager finally came over...just to apologize. Really? Just a sorry?  Not good enough. He said he hadn't had time to look at the ticket..poor excuse for making us ask for him several times. He took off her burger but not her salad. When pressed more he finally gave her a gift card. Corpus just isn't the place for good service or making it better when something is off.
Judy R.,"Corpus Christi, TX",12,2,6,1.0,4/30/2016,"Just had the rudest bartender. We went in to have a couple beers and order pizza, we sat down ordered two Bud Lights the bartender actually told us why are you sitting at the bar. He told us if he opened his own bar he  would have a 3 foot pull handle for bud light and when someone  asks for a Bud Light he's going to tell you to leave the bar. The pizza is good they're not because  if you don't drink the right beer someone's going to be a jerk .worst customer service big guy. No one wants to be harassed when spending money. what a jerk"
Lauren C.,"West Lafayette, IN",1,16,2,5.0,8/30/2015,"YES BJ's (the restaurant) is great! Join the rewards program just because it makes sense. Always be sure to have one of their brews as well. The service at this location is great, all the employees are very welcoming and work hard. Whenever I'm on the fence on what to eat, this is the place because the menu is full of variety."
Brent D.,"Tulsa, OK",38,189,105,5.0,10/6/2015,"This place has many great things!!  The black and bleu burger is great. Lots of bleu cheese. The best part about this place is the craft beer. There is over 10 options of craft beer made here. It's great from top to bottom, blonde to stout."
Sheila F.,"Corpus Christi, TX",24,40,,4.0,3/12/2016,"If I was rating on service alone, it would be 5 stars.  Dena was fantastic and super patient!!  We were doing a girls' lunch but the husband & boyfriend decided to join us and they arrived almost 45 minutes later and it didn't seem to negatively phase Dena at all.  She was on top of refilling our drinks, etc.  We left almost a 25% tip and after I left, I regretted not leaving more. Lost a star as my steak which was requested to be medium, came out well done.  The replacement was a little better but lacked flavor."
Bob T.,"San Antonio, TX",0,16,3,2.0,3/7/2016,I came in at 7pm have been hear over an hour took over 30 minutes just to get a appetizer when it did come out it was burnt told waiter nothing manager never came out . I eat at the one in SA all the time but the one in Corpus Christi really is not worth your time
Marie R.,"Corpus Christi, TX",1,22,3,2.0,10/18/2014,"They have great beers & seasonals I look forward to all year. Everytime I go I'm lucky to have a good server. Why the bad review? The food! I dunno what the hell is goin on in that kitchen. Last time we order chicken wings, they were raw,  I mean salmonella RAW inside. Asked the manager for a shot of tequila to kill the bacteria, he laughed, we were serious. He offered a beer on the house, which he never brought.  Even though that sucked, I wasn't gonna post it bc well, I like their beer.  So we go the other night for a hand tossed pizza & its the last time I'll be eating their food. I've got an iron stomach, I drink the water in Mexico without problem, but I'm done with BJ's food."
Adel L.,"Corpus Christi, TX",1,20,7,4.0,2/27/2015,"I really like the mocktails and pizookies they have here, I always get the orange twist its really good and it has free refills! The food is good, not amazing or gross but standard. I like the tables and decor.Also the one time I got steak they gave me burnt brussel sprouts. bleghh. So uhh you should go...if you have alot of money..."
Misty S.,"Corpus Christi, TX",21,46,40,4.0,1/11/2015,"Came for dinner on a whim and the food was amazing. The menu is huge with a lot of vegetarian and gluten free options, which is hard to find in Corpus. The restaurant itself is huge and they take reservations for call ahead seating. I thought that was pretty neat. On to the actual food. The Parmesean crusted chicken was to die for! It is thinly sliced and topped with a delicious cream sauce (my husband's entree). I had the chicken tortilla soup in a sourdough bread bowl and was sad when I ran out of soup. It was a tad spicy but sooo good!! Also to add to the awesomeness, the root beer and cream soda is made in house and the best I've ever had! The service is the only reason I give 4 stars. If I could give a half star I would to make it 4 and a half. Our waitress was very unfriendly, didn't seem to have knowledge of the menu, and didn't return as often as I would have liked her to. My drink sat empty for a good 5 minutes before I had to ask another server for a refill. She only checked on us once after we received our food and took about 10 minutes to bring the check. Also, when I asked for ketchup for my daughters sliders she never brought it and by the time she remembered, she had already eaten them.  We will be back because of the awesome food and I recommend it to anyone who hasn't tried it!"
Sagar S.,"Austin, TX",0,11,,1.0,9/6/2015,Disappointed. Our server missed our beers. Ordered flat bread which was missing ingredients. Server asked if we are OK with a side of ingredients but din offer to replace the flat bread. She did not bring plates. So we ended up eating from the platter itself. Poor service. We did not get our waters for 15-20 minutes. Shitty service. Did not expect this.
Angela R.,"Corpus Christi, TX",74,44,30,4.0,11/28/2015,"Gosh, this place is just absolutely delicious. I just wish it cost less to go. The pazookie is really great (pizza cookie with vanilla ice-cream)"
Debbie M.,"Corpus Christi, TX",40,69,200,4.0,6/8/2015,"I liked this place. I've heard negative things about it and maybe we just got lucky this time but everything was great. We got here about 8:45, was seated at the bar right away. Bar is very large and comfortable seating. Hooks underneath for your handbag which is always great!  We ordered a thin crust pizza and naked wings with buffalo on the side. Everything was hot and had good flavor. We also got the chocolate pizzookie which was delicious! Really cool place with attentive service and a very nice and happy waitress!"
Lita H.,"Pensacola, FL",1,18,1,3.0,10/31/2015,Been a couple of times and service is a total hit or miss. Food is consistently good but drinks are overpriced.
Amit B.,"Corpus Christi, TX",108,3,2,1.0,5/9/2015,"Dine here only for appetizers, meals suck beyond measure along with having a thumb placed in my plate before putting it on my table. That is not proper serving etiquette. Also main food was bland and dry. First beer we had took almost 25 minutes to come and that was just 3 people. Lousy service! And I am a hospitality major. I know service, where is it at? Not here! Three people served us and it was this lousy. Smh, we even ordered waters with no ice, however they all had ice.. Wow how hard is that! Also I never got my third beer, I'm assuming they were brewing it."
