Ruby R.,"Corpus Christi, TX",34,21,1,3.0,11/17/2015,"I love the food here, it is always above my expectations. The only downside is that sometimes, they take super long with the food or the servers take a while to tend to you. I am in love with their parmesan chicken. I have yet to try their pizza's but my friends say it is awesome."
William D.,"Chesapeake, VA",2,204,188,3.0,7/15/2014,"service was excellent, will say that, and was a really nice facility, clean, spacious and comfortable, if you like beer and a burger probally the best place to get one  but the food..ok, wings cooked fine, but really just had off flavor in sauces, not in a bad way, just not good kids pizza came out cooked incorrectly and was less then spectacular, would compare can get better in grocery store freezer large menu of pub food and american entrees but nothing spectacularly wonderful or exciting, maybe a step up from Applebee's ? would be fair comparison, very few healthy or lighter choices was in a hurry, next to hotel, quality enough considering limited options nearby, served its purpose but not a place we would seek out regularly"
Don K.,"Rockport, TX",1,5,9,2.0,6/16/2015,"We stopped in last Sunday thinking this was a new B & J's Pizza, it's not.  It's a chain from CA.  Nice atmosphere but slow service without that many people in.  We decided to split a pizza but wanted diced tomato's on it.  The waiter told us that there are already tomato's on the deep dish custom build.  The pizza came without any tomato's or sauce from what we could tell and I've seen more ham on Pizza Huts buffet pizza.  The crust and cheese was good but dry without sauce.  The beer and salad was good.  The waiter never asked how it was but if we needed anything.  We won't be back."
C B.,"Corpus Christi, TX",0,69,,3.0,5/6/2014,"Not bad for a chain restaurant.  The beer is good, the food is decent, the prices are fair.  Everybody can find something on the menu that they like. Skip Applebees, Cheddars, Cracker Barrel, Chilis, TGIFridays, etc   go here"
Bryan M.,"Austin, TX",54,30,,5.0,9/4/2015,Great food. Excellent service. I usually go there for happy hour and RARELY have an empty glass.
Cole M.,"Austin, TX",2,206,,4.0,7/9/2015,"I've been a big fan of BJ's for a while mainly because of their draft beer selection.  It's in-house so it's fresh and the servers can pour it nicely.  Other than the beer they have nice apps and some even nicer dipping sauces for the apps, mainly the southwestern sauce mixed with anything.  The avocado rolls are outstanding too.  They have a nice seared ahi tuna salad that will light your flavor candles to boot.  All in all I'd say this is  par for the course as far as BJ's goes.  They have a large menu and do most of the items above average, but stick with the beer and apps and you'll come back again and again."
Brian M.,"San Antonio, TX",34,88,7,4.0,5/28/2014,"Went there for the Spurs game and was pleasantly surprised. Yes, it's in a very cookie cutter version of the strip mall brewpub but it does it pretty well. The beer that they brew are the standard fare from lager to stout and also have a large selection of beer with a full bar to boot.  The service was spot on even on game night which can easily overtax even the best establishments.  As for the food, the menu was huge and I hope to try a few items soon but hope they keep it to the same caliber as the rest of the place."
Logan S.,"Corpus Christi, TX",2,29,6,3.0,3/21/2016,"BJ's is one of our favorite restaurants. We frequent it at least once a week if not more. The majority of the time we sit in a booth in the bar area. We always have great service, and everything we've ever ordered has been fantastic including their beer and cocktails! Every once in a while we branch out and try something new, but usually we stick with the same two things: bacon cheese burger and Mediterranean chicken tacos. We visited this past Sunday and it was not an enjoyable experience. We sat down, our waitress seemed a bit busy which was fine we weren't in any rush. We ordered drinks, a kids grilled chicken with fries, and the sriracha queso dip which was supposed to have the choice of either chili or pork verde. We noticed there was an option for the queso after she took our order and didn't ask us which one we wanted, when I flagged her down and asked her if we had the option she said she went ahead and just ordered it with the chili for us without asking.The kids grilled chicken came out and was cold. We ordered the Mediterranean tacos and a bowl of chili. When our food came out, the tacos looked like they were thrown together, the chicken was cold, the pita bread wasn't fresh like it normally is, the tacos were missing the feta cheese the greek yogurt, and it didn't come with the side of grains like normal. We tried ordering a seasonal watermelon margarita as well and they were out.  Needless to say we were disappointed this time. It just seemed like the kitchen staff tossed our meals together and didn't put much of an effort into it as they normally do."
Heather W.,"Hemphill, TX",3,245,135,2.0,3/1/2015,Well tried this place for the first time. We were not impressed at all!! The waiter was ok... the food sucked.i will not come back to a BJ's
Chloe C.,"Arlington, VA",0,9,,4.0,11/6/2014,"Definitely a fan.  Of the chains, I think they are the best.  I noticed a complaint on service, been here several times and each time the server (different one each time) was excellent.  Way better than I've had at other chains. The food is very good.  Hard to find good American in this town.  I actually think their Calamari is as good as any Italian place in town."
TJ N.,"Corpus Christi, TX",15,2,,3.0,1/14/2014,"Went here for lunchtime with my girlfriend.  We were promptly seated, and they waitress attended to us fairly quickly.  I enjoyed the interior decorations and overall ambience, but that's where my good experience ended.  I ordered the ""handcrafted root beer made in house,"" and needless to say it came out extremely flat.  I think I could've really enjoyed it because the flavor was not bad.  We ordered a couple of appetizers: the calamari and stuffed mushrooms, and two entrees: chicken fried chicken and crispy fish tacos.  It took quite a while (30 minutes or so after we ordered them) to get the appetizers out. Also, the entrees came out immediately after not giving us enough time to eat the appetizers.  The presentation was nice but the food didn't really have much flavor and was under-seasoned.  My girlfriends mashed potatoes were cold. Also another issue was after the waitress brought our food out she never returned to check on us or refill our drinks.  The next time she returned was to give us our check. It took another 15 minutes to get my change after she came for the money.  Perhaps this is just an isolated incident, but we probably won't be going back for a while. Poor first impressions are hard to overcome, but we will eventually be back to give them one more try."
A R.,"Austin, TX",0,39,,4.0,7/4/2015,"No sure what happened, but we went Thursday night and waited for our food forever. We were there at 8:30 and the place was half full.  Waiter was great but out food took way too long."
Jennifer B.,"Portsmouth, VA",1,13,24,5.0,4/19/2016,Absolutely love the the avocado  egg rolls.  If I could I would eat them every for lunch.
Jessica H.,"Los Angeles, CA",501,24,,5.0,4/21/2015,"Enrique made my visit amazing! Fantastic server, goes above and beyond...ask for him. Good food."
Phillip M.,"Georgetown, TX",21,76,28,5.0,5/3/2015,Excellent service. Excellent food. We were extremely impressed. The steak for my wife and the parmesian crusted chicken were great!
Chári N.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",10,4,13,3.0,1/24/2015,The lasagna had too much cheese and not enough tomato sauce. The fried artichoke dip had too much pickle or lemon (whatever made it tart) in it. It seems like the food could be great if they got the proportion of ingredients right.
Tina E.,"Corpus Christi, TX",114,291,348,4.0,2/24/2014,"The food here is very good. Their pizza is super yummy, and one of my favorite dishes is the Parmesan crusted chicken (asks for extra sauce, it's super delicious) with cheesy mashed potatoes. I think my favorite appetizer would be the corn fritters with the bacon aïoli (definitely for extra sauce).  I'm not much of a beer drinker but my husband is. They have a very very wide selection of beers to choose from. I husband and I did try one of their beer flights that was able to let me try some of the beers I was curious about without having to pay full price for a full beer. They also have where each person over the age of 21 can try and taste of beer at no charge."
Amy R.,"San Antonio, TX",1,16,,4.0,7/1/2015,Loved the flatbread pizzas. Have good happy hour specials but alcoholic beverages watered down. Loved there mojitos. Also have sports on the big screen and lots of beers to choose from. Service was good and staff friendly
Jake M.,"Westside, Las Vegas, NV",0,10,1,4.0,6/18/2015,Great food. Great beer. Wonderful inviting atmosphere and always good service. What else can you ask for.
Joelle B.,"San Diego, CA",51,17,1,4.0,4/28/2015,"I love this place for the beer! Only place I've seen Weihenstephan beer on tap in Corpus. The food is good too, but a bit overpriced. I enjoy going for their happy hour appetizers and beer :)"
