Mia K.,"Los Angeles, CA",127,352,317,4.0,8/25/2017,"My first time at this BJ's was years ago. The menu is now like the Cheesecake Factory's. All that's missing is the chapter page. My friends and I had a weekday lunch here. The place was almost empty. Service was slow until after we ordered our drinks. The staff was friendly and I like how our waitress checked in with us asking how our entrees were. I recommend the Enlightened Menu for healthier choices. Healthier as in your dish may have 800 calories, not more than twice that, but Enlightened meals taste good and the portions are large. I had the quinoa, mushroom with shrimp. It was great, so flavorful. There was brown rice mixed in but they surprisingly piled on the shrimp. At Cheesecake Factory, the only healthy item that was tasty was a flatbread and that isn't filling.  My friend liked her Enlightened lemon chicken over rice dish. My other girlfriend got a grilled cheese with fries and loved it. BJ's also has lunch specials until 3 pm (I believe). Their prices are very fair for what you get. It's a nice looking, well-designed restaurant with many choices to please all palates and ages. Hard to resist their Pizookie but they have a mini-one now to reduce guilt. The bar area is cool for watching sports. I like the bright amber panels next to the tv's. There is also a special brunch snack menu on Sundays during the NFL season for indulging or stress eating depending on how your team is doing lol.  Bathrooms are clean and the parking is easier during off hours. Of all the sit down restaurants at the Fox Hills Mall, this is probably my favorite."
Timothy S.,"San Diego, CA",0,32,14,1.0,12/11/2017,"DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE These are the ""lightly"" fried brussel sprouts. They taste like somebody cohort to take them out of the fryer. How did this make it past the staff? So my assumption is that they are either really busy and there is no quality control or they don't care. Either way. I will never ever order from here again. This restaurant is always on the work menu for Grub-hub. I've ordered a couple of things from them before and been disappointed, for reasons I believed to be a result of the delivery process. But this is just outrageous. I still can't believe these made it past the chef and whoever sent these out for delivery. Makes me think about all the other things that slip by. Hopefully not hygiene. Gross!"
Aleasha A.,"Los Angeles, CA",38,5,1,2.0,12/2/2017,"Wow, I regret not checking yelp before deciding to eat here. I've been to other BJ's locations before and I was not expecting this. We walk in, a party of 3, and the hostesses look at us, and continue to ignore us while they're having their petty gossip meeting on the far end of the counter (no one was by the screen inside the thing; both of them were hiding over where the menus are stacked talking away) FINALLY they acknowledge us and get us seated. Our drink and appetizer order is taken swiftly, but when they arrived the server mixed up two of the drinks (both dark sodas but one was clearly marked by the kitchen with two straws in it; whatever, I'll let it pass) Then came time to order our food. Everything would've been fine until it arrived- two out of three orders were plated. Mine!? On a fucking tray. A TRAY. cafeteria style, grimy ass tray. And no excuse given, it was just handed to me. I have NEVER experienced that from any restaurant before. Even Cheesecake Factory has enough plates on their busiest of days, what the hell!? The cherry on top was when the bill arrived. The server slapped the bill on table without a book. Diner-style. Yet, this is not the place where paying up front is expected. This is a RESTAURANT, where the purpose of those books is to -gee, I don't know- KEEP YOUR CARD HIDDEN from prying eyes. LIKE HELL I was going to just set my card out on the end of the table out in the open. Ugh, our server finally got back to the table and charged my card right then and there; I'm not sure if they're trying something new but have they ever heard of table top pay kiosks? PF Chang's and STACKED have them, as well as plenty of other places. I'm not sure if they are just in the middle of transitioning to a more convenient manner of payment, but the overall experience of paying (never mind the rest of the dining) was plain unprofessional. Never coming back here again."
Michael P.,"El Segundo, CA",1018,43,13,1.0,11/29/2017,"WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA .  Now I know that lots of the time in my reviews I have said that I have worked at this establishment which made things worse.  But I have worked as a server at BJs in Glendale and our server Alejandro was by far the most disrespectful, rude, blatantly disengaged employee I have ever met ESPECIALLY when you are a SERVER! That is your job. To serve. I was in a group of about 20 and NO ONE got water refills. He did not ask us if we needed anything we had to go and get other servers and the manager multiple times because we were missing items and order got messed up. It was honestly embarrasing having said I worked at such an establishment that allows their employees to treat their guests in such a way. I HOPE someone from corporate or management sees this.  This was just this past monday 11/27/2017. IT WAS HORRIBLE. one more time.  HORRIBLE!"
Audrey N.,"Hilo, HI",30,38,63,2.0,1/7/2018,"So my dad ordered the sliders. When it got to us, he opened them to put his lettuce and pickles in, but oh my. The patties were so sad looking because they cut a whole patty into fourths. So lame. Also, menu says grilled onions. Asked our waiter to give on the side. He comes back saying it's actually grilled onions that is used to cook the patty for that ""grilled onion taste, but no actual onions my manager said. However I'm having them make new ones for you with grilled onions."" Wth?! Now we've been waiting for like 20mins for the new sliders. At least we won't be charged for two orders of sad sliders.  Also yes service is so slow. I get it, you're closing in an hour. But still. Cmon."
Tony C.,"Orlando, FL",0,14,,4.0,1/10/2018,"I was in the L.A. area on business before catching the red-eye back east. We stopped at BJ's outside of LAX for a light meal and a couple of beers before catching our flight. The food, atmosphere, customer service and price was great! A very nice menu to satisfy many pallets, a great selection of beer, wine and mixed drinks too. I noticed families with children, Millennials at happy hour and diverse group of patrons really enjoying themselves. I had the Seared Ahi Salad and it was fabulous! Wash this down with a BJ's Brewhouse Blonde and you won't go wrong!"
Adrianne R.,"Atlanta, GA",924,239,295,1.0,10/29/2017,"You know what?! I'm all for spending money in the community, and in this area is where I grew up as a kid, went to Fox hills mall too many times as a kid and a teenager. But this area right here is too congested, I can never find parking. I knew it was a bad idea to pick this BJ's when I suggested it to my friends for our last outing and for my sons birthday dinner.  My best friend got there before I did while I was making rounds in the parking lot trying to find somewhere to park. Finally after parking in the covered parking structure and walking too far just to get to the restaurant I went to the reception area and asked the hostess where I could find my party which happened to be right behind her. I walked over and waited because we had a few more people coming, when the rest of the guest arrived we told our Waiter ""James"" that it was not enough room. Oh let me add that when I got there my friend had already ordered stuffed mushrooms.....  So we're moved to another table to the left of the restaurant and it wasn't enough room, so we were moved back to where we were with another small table added. After about 10 minutes ""James"" came to take our order and went to the back to put in our order.  After waiting for about 30 minutes we summoned James again to ask him what was the holdup on our dinner. He said that he would check and walked to another table. Ten minutes or so they come out with our food one by one..... but the kids still had not received their food and neither did my friends stuffed mushrooms ever come out.  Finally the kids food come out about another 7 minutes. We eat and it's time to pay the check. My friend tells them that this order of stuffed mushrooms never came. So that needs to be deleted. Finally we get up and leave walk out after we pay our bill and I go to the car and and we drive off. Five minutes into traffic my son tells me that he forgot his birthday cards with gift cards in the envelopes on the table at the restaurant. Immediately I turn the car around and proceed to call BJ's on the phone. The hostess answers and I tell her that my son left his cards on the table. She put me on hold and comes back and says she didn't see any cards on the table. I tell her Â I'm on my way.  I get there and I show her the exact table that we were sitting at. I have her call James and I'm asking him what happened to my sons cards he says he doesn't know and goes to the back to ask The busboy..... ok now I'm pretty sure James saw those cards when he picked up hid tip off of the table, but he is clueless now? Now I'm pissed because this is not cool. How could someone take a kids gift cards on his birthday. I was so pissed and hurt and so was my son and god daughter because one of the cards was one she had personally made for my son. I believe James or the busboy lied. I will never give my money to this BJ's ever again. I'll go to Cerritos"
Benecia W.,"Los Angeles, CA",31,52,190,1.0,10/30/2017,"I love this place - I truly do! I'll be more specific, I love their tomato soup! However... THE ISSUE: Ordered a flatbread pizza all pepperoni and mushrooms w/ half pineapple - NO SAUSAGE. Pizza comes and has sausage on it. They come get it and says it'll be 5 mins. MEANWHILE, my sister pinches the side of the pizza for insurance. Cool! SAME PIZZA comes back. Someone singlehandedly picks every piece of sausage off the pizza (that they can see), adds more cheese to cover the holes and puts it in the oven. Crust looking very crusty.  The manager comes over to explain they were 'very busy' and they'll bring another; not acknowledging that SOMEONE FRIGGIN PUT THEIR WHOLE HAND Â IN THE PIZZA I'm suppose to eat and removed a whole topping. Listen, THAT IS DISGUSTING on so many levels. I can't possibly wrap my head around the managers caviler attitude. HOW MANY dishes yesterday (10/30/17) evening were treated like that?  So many concerns... My poor waitress, she was so sweet (I think her name started with a 'D.' Cute white girl with a ponytail and a bandana on). Normally, I'm cool with the differences between restaurants and myself; preferences are just that BUT THIS exceeds my limits and I PREFER u not put your dirty little hand in my pizza and try to serve it back to me after I asked for a new one! A whole hand... WOW!"
Katie K.,"Los Angeles, CA",248,20,46,1.0,10/19/2017,"The Food: Â I was not impressed by the food quality here. I ordered the BJ's Classic RIb-Eye (well done), with a baked potato (butter & chives) and asparagus (with no pepper). Â I received the steak medium rare (as you can see), no butter or chives, and pepper on the asparagus. Â I did order a drink prior to the meal, and it was about a 6 out of 10 based on how strong the drink tasted and overall flavor. Service: I had satisfactory service. Being that I'm only 1, they sat me at a small booth fit for 2, even though it was not busy at all (after 9pm on a Friday) and they could have seated me at a more spacious booth closer to the bar. Â The server was very apologetic about my food order, and was satisfactory in checking on me. I was very dissatisfied that I had to wait 40 minutes for my check. I don't think I'll be back to this location.  #PartyOf1"
John C.,"Los Angeles, CA",94,202,91,1.0,11/12/2017,"Absolutely terrible experience, beginning through the end. We are seated and wait 15 minutes before the server shows up. Not wanting to wait any longer nor slog through what we already predicted to be a slow experience, we order everything - drinks, appetizers, entrees - all at once. The ""appetizer sampler"" shows us. It's a terrible visual experience, with sauces spilling over and the food just looking absolutely unappetizing. The ""wings"" aren't even wings. They're just bits of chicken coated in a super thick batter - probably more than 60% of each bite is batter. Â I ordered a clam chowder in a bread bowl as well. There's barely any soup and mostly the sourdough bread. 8 bucks for that. What a rip off. The entrees come out - including a couple of small pizzas. My entree - a ribeye steak - was asked to be cooked in medium. You know, a warm pink center. There's not any pink to be seen. Instead, a grey overcooked piece of meat. Tough to boot, even though they claim to age the beef 28 days. Riiiiiiiiight. Can't get a refill on the drinks either. Get the check, the server is nowhere to be seen nor found. We wait and wait. Then get tired of it so forced to pay upfront.  Are you looking for slow, bad service? Crummy, overpriced food? This is the place for you. Otherwise, stay away. Terrible."
Robert G.,"Culver City, CA",19,39,36,4.0,11/23/2017,Ate at the bar and was served both food and drinks by the bartender. She was very attentive and super nice. The shrimp were made to order as was the fish.
John W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,11,4,1.0,11/4/2017,"One of the worst restaurants in LA. Came to pick up an online ordered food and after I come their to pick. They kept waiting for an other 50 minutes yes 50 minutes!!!! Â  Attender with pony hair (African American male ) has a very bad attitude. Kept me waiting for no reason, my food was already made and was sitting in heat box right in front of me and this idiot tells me.. look I don't cook the food.. it is in making!  .. I was waiting their and he just runs in kitchen and comes out and pulls out the food which was in heat box right at the front.  He just neglected and kept me waiting for so long although food was ready... shame... you have one job and you can't keep it up"
Vanessa R.,"Los Angeles, CA",353,15,8,2.0,11/5/2017,"Why wait 45 minutes to an hour for food?  This was an horrible experience. ""The cooks were back upped."" Â Was what the manager, Gabby said. Really? I ordered Salmon.. salmon does not take THAT LONG."
Je Don D.,"Carson, CA",47,201,262,4.0,1/31/2017,"I had a decent experience at this BJ s. The wait was 10 min to be seated. The waiter was fast and attentive. I watched him during the evening and he was a stand out employee.  Â   The food was good and satisfying.   Pot stickers= delicious   Barbecue Pizza = Bomb.... I love that buttery crust Â and the barbecue sauce is just enough and hickory sweet. Fried Portabella Mushroom = deep fried crust with a good aioli sauce  Pork Ribs= meat falling off the bone with hickory sweet barbecue sauce. The meat fell onto the plate and I was left with a bone. I ain't complaining.   Â  The aesthetics of the restaurant is very balanced between bar and restaurant. Near the bar area there are T.V.s with sports channels. The place can get loud during that time.  Parking sucks unless you valet. This restaurant is connected with the mall, with an outside entrance. Most people are shopping so parking is a struggle"
Angelica J.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,9,,1.0,1/2/2018,"This location has the worst service I've ever experienced. I walked in as a party of 2 and the hostess is laying her head down on the desk area. Confused as to where we should go, we said ""Hi we have a party of 2"" she briefly looks up, looks back at the bar area and says ""are you okay with the bar ?"" We said sure, and she said we could seat ourselves. We walk into the bar area, and there are NO SEATS !!!  Confused once again, we stop a waiter and let them know there is no bar seating but there is an empty table in the dining area we would like to sit down at. The guy literally looks at us and says ""go ahead"". My boyfriend is irritated at this point and once again has to stop another waiter to see if there are any available waiters for our table. He rolls his eyes, and says ""I guess"" and storms off to the front of the restaurant. At this point I was also irritated with the service and told my boyfriend we were leaving. We left the restaurant and will never return again. This location needs to revamp their management and be sure that managers are available on the floor at all times to ensure that employees are AT LEAST doing their jobs. I have never been to an establishment that literally ignored my existence.  I've been to this location once before and it was on a Monday, which wasn't busy by any means and the service was great. The manager actually came to our table to check in a couple of times. I also work in retail so I know when it is busy things get sacrificed but customer service is how you keep customers coming in the door, not the food."
Jennifer P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,11,5.0,11/10/2017,"This is one of my favorite restaurant's in town Â The service is always amazing Mandy our waitress is the best ever And We Veteran's Appreciate the offer that BJ'S has given to Us! Â  Great Food ! Great Service! Â Who could ask for More!!!! Â  YES! I Brought My Crew! 5 of Us. AWESOME!!!! Â  YOU Â Gotta Go Â  i got the Jambalaya Awesome, my friends Â Root Beer Wings! Awesome"
Monique P.,"Hawthorne, CA",142,6,1,1.0,10/10/2017,On Sept 8th 2017 I made reservations for 20 people for a 80th birthday celebration on 10/07/17 I spoke with Kyle. We have celebrated special events at BJ's and have always had such a wonderful experience that my mother choose this location once again. I arrived at 3:30 for a 4pm reservation and was told was no record of a reservation for my group. Â I was told we could be accommodated if we didnt mind being seated on the patio. Â The sun was blinding and extremely uncomfortable but we were told there were no shades we were then told by our waiter (who was pleasant) that he would take our order although he still had to take care of other tables inside. To start off there were 2 dinner salads served about 15 min before the next order. Â There for the orders were brought out in shifts. Â By the time 1st and 2nd shift the 3rd and 4th shift orders were just being served. Â Most of the food was cold. Â There for if our pervious events on a scale of 1 to 10 would have been rated a 9 1/2. How ever this occasion is rated at a 1 or 2. Â The dishwasher broke down so we were not able to get glasses of water they brought out several orders that did not belong to our group. And a steak so tough my daughter broke her tooth as she bit into it.
Amyra T.,"Los Angeles, CA",52,5,9,2.0,9/2/2017,"Been to multiple BJ's location and this one has the worst customer service! Here's why:  1. Waited 30 minutes to be seated when I was told the wait was only 5.  2. Waitress (did not catch her name but she's a blonde young girl) did not come to our table once within a 30 minute time frame. So we eventually got out order taken by another waitress that at first refused to take our order until I said to my friend ""Nevermind let's go"" which cause her to be completely apologetic afterwards. 3. Our first waitress (blonde girl) came back and after we informed her that some else took our order she had a lot of attitude. Later in the night we asked her if we could have some ketchup and her response was  ""Did you want me to tell your server or did you want me to be your server again""  Completely rude. To top it off the food took forever to come out. So in total we waited about 2 hours to finally eat.  Thanks BJ's for a bad night. Always remembering to never come to this location again."
Stephanie S.,"Orange, CA",2,34,1,1.0,8/31/2017,"Just got food to go from a third party delivery service and impressively BJs missed the mark on everything I ordered. Â No dressing, no dipping sauces, missing ingredients from each of the things I ordered. Â The avocado rolls, which I normally love were so soggy, even after a few minutes in the oven they were still inedible, and no tamarind sauce. Â A side salad with croutons from probably last week and no dressing, even though indicated on my receipt was the dressing request. Â Mediterranean tacos missing ingredients, cold and underwhelming. Sloppy job BJs, I expect better especially when I'm paying a higher price to have the food delivered. Â Your staff neglected to take care to confirm accuracy and freshness of the order. Disappointing, I won't order from you again."
Justin L.,"San Francisco, CA",506,163,610,4.0,11/17/2016,"Better than most Bj's I have been to. I went for my friend's 21st birthday and sat at the bar sections so that we could get happy hour specials. We ordered a pitcher of Stella and I had the Late Night Burger. Very filling and jam packed with meaty goodness. They also top it off with a nice over-easy egg on top of the burger. The environment was comfortable. Not too many people but not too little. They had a huge tv screen that showed the basketball game which made the night even more entertaining. The waiter was patient and helpful. Overall, my experience there was good and would go back for a group event!"
Joy B.,"Los Angeles, CA",184,138,153,2.0,4/16/2017,"Super long wait to get drinks and utensils to us, about 15 minutes. Then food took about 35 minutes to come out. When they came, I got yucky looking celery and very sorry looking and tasting Brussels sprouts. Our sever was apologetic but we won't be coming back."
Lenny L.,"Long Beach, CA",52,1,1,5.0,4/20/2017,So I went with my co Workers/Friends/Family and this was my first time. I just wanted to say that I had a fun time the food was awesome and your beautiful friendly waitress Natash E was great and very helpful and made us feel welcomed she knows what hospitality is all about. look forward to going back again.  Keep up the great work!!! -Len
Rhina D.,"West Hollywood, CA",3,20,16,1.0,11/10/2017,My family and I are usually here at least once a month. Today is my husband birthday and unfortunately it wasn't a good experience. We ordered spinach and artichoke dip... it was brought to the table frozen! Not once but 4 times. The waitress said they won't be able to bring us our appetizer as ALL spinach dips are frozen... we waited about 45 minutes for our food too come. then my chicken Alfredo was warm when it came to the table. My husbands food was ok my daughters food came 20 after the 45 minutes we already waited for our food. Overall a bad experience. It will be a while till we return to this location.
Pascha S.,"Inglewood, CA",0,9,5,2.0,11/12/2017,"Ok, I hardly ever have to give a bad review but, my food experience last night at BJ's was unacceptable. For starters, our lettuce wrap was cold and it had two Brussels sprouts and a French fry in it, had to send it back. The pizza I ordered was not even cooked all the way through and it was dry ( no sauce), I didn't even eat it. My husbands spaghetti and meat balls was horrible, the meat balls were undercooked and only had 1 tablespoon of marinara sauce on it. The best thing hung about our dinner was the Dr.Pepper and my Orange cream soda. Horrible dinner experience for our Saturday night..."
Christian R.,"Inglewood, CA",71,5,14,5.0,8/6/2017,"Maddie (Madison) did an amazing job serving us! She was very attentive and super friendly! She also had a great sense of humor! Would love to be seated in her section again. As far as the food goes, the jambalaya was cold and my steak was medium instead of medium rare. Overall we had a great experience. Thanks again Maddie. Â  P.S. Thanks for the A1 sauce"
Ryan J.,"Torrance, CA",0,2,1,5.0,12/10/2017,Came in for a drink after work and Kyle made me the best mudslide ever! He used ice cream instead of regular cream and it was amazing!!
Gerald O.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/3/2018,"Nice location at FOX HILLS MALL,however our waiter Jamie sucked real bad and left us hanging with our take out order not delivered to the kitchen for take out as requested Â to go, but he left out the backdoor because I saw him go. Totally worth firing because of service not rendered and PAID for truly a thumbs down for unacceptable service that was paid for and not performed as promised. Is there any rating less than 1 star, he wins thumbs down, he took the money for our orders and went out the back door!! A hole to go and he went out the door...loser!"
Jas M.,"Denver, CO",0,1,,1.0,1/3/2018,"On 12/12/17 I visited your restaurant while during a layover to Denver. I came in during your happy hour to grab some food for the flight. While waiting I ordered a draft angry orchard, and a pizookie cookie. After 30mins the waitress told me they were running out of the cider so she brought me the rest of what they had. Because it wasn't enough for a full proportion she told me she wouldn't charge me. The pizookie came out fine. Then I also made a to go order with vegetarian pita tacos with the honey siracha brussles sprouts, the avocado eggrolls, and another pizookie cookie that was cookies n cream. She brought me out the bill and still charge me for the draft beer. The first time my waitress brought out the tacos they looked normal, but they were chorizo. I reminded her that I ordered the vegetarian tacos. I also reminded her that I didn't get my brussles sprouts and was still charged for the angry orchard. Â She apologized and told me she would have them remake my order. And she took my cash and receipt. After another 25mins she came back with my change still not including the drink she was supposed to take off and my new tacos. The tacos had nothing but steamed vegetables in them and there were no tomatoes. They had no cheese on them and they were missing the red wine vinaigrette. The pita was also cold. I asked her about the brussels sprouts and the bistro grains and she told me they were the bag. I began checking the rest of my order to find no honey siracha brussles sprouts and no bistro grains and the avocado in the eggrolls were black and the rolls were soggy like they had been sitting out. I tried to wait for my waitress but she was nowhere to be found. Then I opened my pizookie and it was like in a pile . I asked other workers they told me to talk to my waiter. At this time I had been there for over 2hrs and was close to being late for my flight so I left. I don't remember the waitress's name but she was short petite African American female. Â She looked like she could be 18-23yrs old and she didn't seem to have much experience working there. I also don't have my receipt because she kept it when she went to go remake the tacos.  However, on 12/13 I called the restaurant back and requested to speak with a manager. I spoke with the worker in the bar area who told be one wasn't available but she took down my name and number and said she would have a Â manager contact me by the end of the day. After a week went by and no one called I called a local Bjs restaurant to ask for information on how to get in touch with someone who could help. She told me to check online and hung up in my face. Â It has been over three weeks now and I haven't received a call."
Dayana P.,"Los Angeles, CA",580,231,304,1.0,1/8/2017,"I had dinner here today and it was just awful. I have been to other BJs and the service here is so bad. The place was fairly empty, not as busy as it usually is. Therefore, i expected good service. I was wrong. The waitress was very rude and inattentive. She took our order and NEVER came back to our table again. I had to get up and find a waiter (a different one) who could give me the bill. My drink was empty for the entire dinner because our waitress never came.. My food didn't all arrive at the same time. Our side order arrived about 30 minutes later.. by that time everyone was done with the dinner.  The food took forever to come out and it was cold. I will not be returning to this location."
Sandz V.,"El Segundo, CA",0,4,1,1.0,7/6/2017,"These STARS need to have a negative on them!  Bad experience and this is what I wrote to them! Everyone.... watch out for this waitress!!!! Ask for the manager if you get stuck at her table! We work too hard to spend money for this service!  Today during lunch, my guests and I experienced bad service from the waitress by the name Natasha E. We were there today, Thursday, July 6 at 12:40 PM. Natasha E. was very rude, she came to ask us what to order, without introducing herself to us... just basically asked us for our order, and when we kept her there for a few seconds, she walked away from our table as we were talking to her as if she had something more important to do other than to do her job and serve us. She didn't come by to ask us if we needed anything extra, not even to ask if we were satisfied with our meals. It was just the worst. And when she would talk to us, she seemed to be in a rush due to the fact that in the middle of us talking she would be in the middle of leaving. She seemed to have an attitude towards us and especially walking away as my guest started to talk to her about our order BURNED me up! I work very hard to take guests out to eat to your Restaurant and I just feel very upset and dissatisfied that you can allow your staff to treat customers like this!  Do your staff realize that we are their paycheck? Paying exactly $53 in exchange for lunch with a large side horrible service, I would've been better off at In-N-Out. Never have I been treated this bad at a restaurant like BJs.  I really hope to hear from them!"
Jene R.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",10,7,1,1.0,7/9/2017,"The only decent thing here was our waiter, and even he forgot to fill our water. When we first came in we were brushed aside and told it would be a 10 minute wait (usually no problem) or we could look for seating in the bar area. When I went to the bar area I happened to see a bunch of empty tables and booths in the regular area of the restaurant. They didn't even bother to check. When I told the hostess this she said ""if you see a clean one you like you can go sit there"". Neither the host or hostess seeming to care about moving a muscle to move toward the table or reach for a menu. We got seated eventually by the reluctant host. Aside from that the bathroom seemed to be a hang out spot for the waitresses as they blocked the sinks and doorway. And the menus looked and felt like they hadn't ever been cleaned. The food was pretty lack luster. I've been to plenty of their locations and have had a great experience, but this one in particular is worth avoiding."
Sarah H.,"Redondo Beach, CA",912,311,1357,3.0,6/24/2016,"We ordered ahead online so that it'd be ready to pick up. I tried their new avocado bacon lettuce tomato, skinny fries (as in thin - not low fat) and added a wedge salad. You gain a lot as far as ease and convenience but the texture looses something because the warm things get a little soggy due to condensation. Still the flavor a were there! I liked the taste of the sourdough and there was a lot of avocado! Delilah! Â I will have to go to the restaurant next time to get everything when it's still hot and crispy.  Speaking of crispy, the wedge salad was really crisp and everything I hoped for."
Mary C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,7,1.0,8/3/2017,Food was not made as requested. Dessert was burnt and service was horrible. Not a good place to enjoy good food. Also kinda expensive for below par food. Do not go. I guarantee that you will hate your time there
Dr Dave D.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,42,27,1.0,9/30/2017,"Worse BJ's ever ! I ordered jambalaya, the waitress asks me what salad do I want with that ? - I didn't want any salad or asked for it, so I asked if it comes with a salad , which she replied that I don't have to take it... implying once again that it's part of main course and comes as a side dish. So I insisted and asked - I know I don't have to ... I don't have to take shrimp with the jambalaya but it does come with it ... does it come with the salad ? She kept answering ""you don't have to take salad"". I got upset and asked ""just tell me if you charge extra for the salad or it comes free as a side dish ?"". She finally admitted it cost extra. So I said so why you confuse me with stuff I didn't ask for - if I wanted a salad I'd ask for it! And I kept ordering the food - then she just left... in the middle of my order - while I was talking ... and refused to serve us. But she didn't tell us for like 20 minute so we are waiting there for a waiter but no one comes ... Till we gave up and left. What kind of waitress leaves in the middle of an order whiles the customer speaks to her ?? And leaves us to dry ?? If you can't deal with feedback from customers - don't be a waitress !!  You represent an establishment as a waitress - a chain of restaurants - you cannot be that rude to clients !! Period. And what kind of scam is that ? You don't ask ""what salad would you want with that ?"" When it doesn't really come with a salad - you ask ""would you want a salad with that ?"" , that's misleading and she knew it as twice she refused to answer it properly ... until I asked her ""do you charge extra for it ?"" She had no choice but to say yes...  But then she left the table in the middle of my order and just never came back... while we were waiting ... not really understanding what just happened. Super rude and unprofessional!!  I would never expect that from a waitress in BJ's.  I would definitely not go there ever again. Worse service ever !!"
brandon k.,"Cleveland, OH",0,31,1,1.0,10/5/2017,"A decent Thursday night rib special gave way to neglectful service that kept us waiting almost 40 minutes for the included desert and our tabs. Nobody checked on us, our empty dinnerware or our empty drinks.  After 30 mins we asked for a manager. 10 mins later we finally got a preview of our bill and an apology from the manager.  We explained that we just wanted our tab and to leave. While he was gone preparing the bill, our desert finally came out. Not hungry for it, take it back and please just bring our check. Finally, after nearly 10 mins of telling him we simply wanted to pay our bills and leave, we gave up waiting on the manager. We left cash for our meals based on what he showed us and walked out in disgust. Ok food with abysmal service. This place has operational issues that I'm not used to seeing at a BJ's."
Steven P.,"San Jacinto, CA",1,12,1,5.0,7/30/2017,"Every one of these five stars is for Nick. Attentive, not overbearing, anticipating guest needs while still maintaining good face time with each of his tables in the bar, very genuine..  Next time we are in town, we will come back for Nick. Thank you!"
Billy S.,"Los Angeles, CA",277,1,,1.0,10/4/2017,"Usually don't have a problem with bjs... but this location always seem to mess up on something when I'm there.. food, drinks or the service is just terrible. The front desk lady decided to put my food next to someone else's order and of course it got taken with that guest order so I had to wait another 15 minutes. Manager was great, but when I got my order I got home,opened it, and it wasn't even what I asked for. â. Thank you bjs."
Marc B.,"Sacramento, CA",177,751,728,2.0,11/27/2016,"The App Combo was very mediocre. The egg rolls were made of dried up avocado, the spinach dip was fine, the BBQ ""wings"" weren't wings they were nuggets, and the mozzarella sticks were ok. The Chocolate Chip Pazooki was and always is a good dessert investment. I rarely comment on service (and it won't affect my score), but the restaurant either had too few servers or it just doesn't have its stuff together service-wise. Ordered. Waited 25 minutes for water. Waited another 10 minutes, then the manager visited us and said our order wasn't put in and he expedited it. Food came 45 minutes after we ordered, and the App Combo was sub-par (see above). What's weird is that the waitress never came back to our table after taking our initial order."
Mel M.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,39,13,1.0,5/14/2017,"I hate that I am spending Mother's Day writing this but my experience was so disturbing that I felt compelled to yelp them and write their corporate office.  This review is all about the poor customer service. Our waitress Contessa never introduced herself or smiled. She was in a rush and a bad mood. It took about 20 minutes to get silverware dumped in a pile on our table. She then failed to deliver meals in a timely manner (30 minutes) so they were all lukewarm. Soggy sandwich, cold pasta, lukewarm ribs and fries. One meal NEVER arrived nor did the dessert we ordered.  A female manager came to the table with no hospitality skills and made the experience worse.  I read a few reviews and it seems like my experience is typical there. I wish I would have checked yelp before going. How many bad reviews will they get before they take action?  I highly suggest they get hospitality, customer service training and hire managers who can motivate the staff to smile, be friendly, prepare tables, and deliver food in a timely manner."
