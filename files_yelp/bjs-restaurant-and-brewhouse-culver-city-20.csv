Pamela C.,"South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",54,2,,5.0,5/30/2017,"I am a BJ's regular, I normally get the same thing (jambalaya and a strawberry lemonade). But today I dared to be different at the suggestion of a server! Her name is Emilie and she was friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable about her menu. I ordered a watermelon margarita and a Parmesan chicken and loved every bite and sip of it! I will definitely be returning soon!"
Christopher C.,"Costa Mesa, CA",177,74,301,5.0,8/26/2016,"You get five stars for one over all solidified reason... Larry the bar tender , food was good but larry is a cool dude , recomended great beers and over all always tends to me and my fellow co worker when we go for our weekely lunch. Larry is fracking cowabunga!!"
August A.,"Los Angeles, CA",244,19,18,4.0,4/10/2016,"Just your normal run of the mill BJ's. You can't go wrong with anything on their menu. Salads to die for. Our waiter was pretty awesome too. Don't like crying babies? Then don't come here. They lose a star because I had to wait 15 minutes before getting seated, when many tables were open. I don't like wasting my time"
Shauna N.,"Hawthorne, CA",67,221,248,2.0,11/24/2015,My family grew up going to the BJ's in Westwood and were so excited when they built one closer to our house. I am sad to say the quality and the service is nothing like the one in other locations. The atmosphere has always been chaotic. The waiters don't write things down and then mess up your order. I had to ask the waiter what happened to my salad as he was bringing out my meal. The waiters never check back to see if they were right or if everything tastes ok. I have given this location 5 tries because I want it to just be one waiters fault but sadly it has been every waiter I have ever had there. The staff is friendly you just won't get what you asked for. If you are able to catch another waiter walking by and ask them to get your waiter they look at you like you are crazy. The food is good it just sadly may take several hours and come out cold or just not at all what you asked for.
Alexis K.,"Santa Monica, CA",122,103,14,2.0,2/20/2016,"How can a place that is so nasty be so packed!?! I guess when you're hungry and stuck at the mall you get desperate.  You see the pictures of the food on the menu and think, ""That looks good, that looks hard to screw up.""  Think again.  This place is just sketchy.  My drink was gnarrrrrllly.  My salad was rancid and looked nothing like the picture!  Don't put a picture if you aren't going to deliver what's in the picture.  The guy next to me ordered a well done hamburger and it came completely pink inside.  We ordered a soup to start and it never came.  The service is slow and unimpressive.  It's a chain, so I guess they are more about quantity than quality. The chicken tenders were ok I guess, but you could do better at Wing Stop."
Mark M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,2.0,11/6/2016,"Food was good, however the service is seriously lacking. Not sure if it's because they're short staffed or what, but our drinks weren't refilled 1 time. The food didn't come to us the way we ordered it. This place needs better staff or more of them. Either way I don't recommend coming here."
Liz L.,"Brownsville, TX",0,4,,4.0,5/6/2017,The salmon & were great! John was a good waiter. He was attentive. I could have given 5 stars but at the end it did take him awhile to give us our tea.
Maria G.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,2,,5.0,11/17/2016,The food here was good ..I ordered the spinach dip which I love and our server was very attentive ..and always came up to check up on us..I'll say I had good service in this place..will be coming back.
Tae G.,"Los Angeles, CA",101,765,1929,3.0,12/27/2015,"This BJ's is the 'hangout' spot for many. Wait and parking can be a hassle, but service is good. I like the soups in the bread loaf, salads, and spinach & artichoke dip the most. You can't beat a pizookie of any flavor. Today, our waitress, Taj, was excellent! She was friendly, quick, and attentive. She knows the menu well and was on point. Kudos to you, Taj!"
Rasheena G.,"Los Angeles, CA",143,7,,3.0,10/16/2016,"The food at BJ's is delicious.  The service at this location is subpar.  Our appetizer came out after half of our main course was eaten and when our check came out,  our waitress never came to pick it up.  After about 10 minutes of waiting,  I walked it up to the front receptionist to have someone else ring me up.  Maybe it's because it was a Saturday night,  but I was unimpressed."
Alexander F.,"Santa Monica, Los Angeles, CA",33,6,2,5.0,1/22/2016,Come on a Friday night and let me tell you the service was great Contessa and Derek were on top of there game as soon as we were sat they were very attentive and they really took care of us. I've been to a few BJs and this experience was by far the best. Thanks again Derek and Contessa you guys made my dining experience excellent 5 stars!!
Krystal B.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,27,10,1.0,9/15/2016,"This place obviously needs RESTAFFING! The manager Caleb was VERY CONDESCENDING when I asked for barbecue sauce! Please get out of customer service if you are going to be rude when customers make a simple request. Regardless of what you are going through on any given occasion when you walk on stage (I.e., the work place) slap a smile on your face. This place already has 2.5 stars before I left this rating and you would think they would take a hint and STEP IT UP! This is awful. Go to Olive Garden or Cheesecake Factory for a better experience."
Lakashia N.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,69,64,2.0,8/2/2016,Our waitress provided great customer service it was a party of 6. I ordered traditional bone in wings with drizzle hot sauce and ranch. As soon as our waitress bought out our food I did noticed that my wings were old and room temperature I did bring it to waitress attention and then notified the manager. The manager was awesome and very understanding she provided me with a free pooskie on the house.
Tiffany R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,13,,1.0,4/9/2017,"Friday April 7 we decided to try this establishment once more.the food was  fine, until my daughter took her last nite of her hickory brisket bacon burger, she pulled out a piece of gray hair 2 to 3 inches long after it was in her mouth. I'm bald the wife doesn't have any gray hair and my 2 teenage daughters sure don't. We pointed​this out to the waitress who apologized​ and kindly ask if the daughter wanted another one ,we agreed and took it home . Thought everything was fine until the daughter decided to eat the burger Saturday afternoon what did she discover but another gray hair the same as the first, someone preparing food​at BJ's has a problem."
Denise S.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,9,40,1.0,10/20/2014,"There lunch items go 4 $6.95, not $5.95; thats, 2 lure u in.  Plus the food is not good; not at this location.   The one in El Monte is soooooo much better.  Good service & good food.  At this 1 they need 2 FIRE  the alleged ""cook"" & the slow wsutresses, especially the unprofessional one working  up ftont.   She's ridiculous, lil midget. I recommend the Yard house n the Marina;  Excellent!"
Mariecar M.,"San Francisco, CA",16,110,53,1.0,10/27/2014,"I hadn't been in a while and I found out why: the kids they have serving don't know about beer. The food is what you'd expect at a chain like this though, which is to say that it's your standard American fare with wannabe ethic fusion dishes. And just when you think you can order a salad without them messing it up, they bring a Caesar salad that was overdressed and wilted like it had been tossed earlier in the day and put in the fridge. What I did like we're the fried artichoke hearts and the bison burger (surprisingly tasty thanks to the smokey chipotle sauce) the pizookie, of course. But next time at the mall, I'd rather eat at Hot Dog on a Stick."
Chuck D.,"Los Angeles, CA",654,1172,8489,3.0,7/23/2013,"Went here on a Friday night to meet some friends visiting from out of the country & one that is an airline pilot that was arriving at LAX that night. Hence the reason for meeting in the Westside. I agree with other Yelpers in that this place is ""parking challenged"". I drove by and didnt see any spaces near the front of the restaurant available & it didn't look like they would open up anytime soon. There is valet right at the Fox Hills mall entrance closest to BJ's. I drove around back near the pizzeria & other eateries and fortunately found a space at the very corner. We started off at the bar with our fluctuating group headcount... for some drinks & some appetizers (calamari). Calamari was good & plentiful for an appetizer portion but what was with the ranch dipping sauce beside the requisite marinara?? Not necessary IMO. We closed the bar tab & finally got a table after what seemed like over an hour long wait. We arrived at 9pm. We probably were seated around 1045pm? In all fairness, we did not request a table or have the needed headcount til about 930-940, but still... we waited a while. It was friday night, i know. It was busy but not wall to wall packed by any means. I ordered the bacon cheeseburger. I opted for the wedge cut fries... The food arrived in a decent amount of time. It was good. The bread wwas delish. It had a bit of a crispness on the outside & was soft on the inside. Just perfect... I like the garlic aioli that was spread on the bread. The burger patty itself was good, a little dry but I ordered it well so that's what I get. The cheddar cheese was good. I needed ketchup for my fries & the waiter was quick to get that. I asked for a refill on water & that took a long time. I was really thirsty by the time I had to remind him about it... That was a bummer. Decent food. Inconsistent service but a good place to have drinks & a meal with friends. Good luck finding parking. Bring patience."
Cedric C.,"Hawthorne, CA",0,2,,5.0,10/21/2016,Been here a few times and I can say this is by far the best service I have gotten Cystial M was amazing and her recommendation on food was honest and true will come back just for her service again thank you Cystial
Cathie M.,"Culver City, CA",0,2,,3.0,10/20/2016,"Normally love this place but tonight I was terribly disappointed, I made a reservation for a party of 12 to celebrate my granddaughters 18th birthday.  When we arrived we were told that we would have to wait 20-25 minutes when I asked what the point of a reservation was I was told they had other large parties at the same time and we would just have to wait. When we were finally seated around 7:30 we were seated next ro another party that was so loud we couldn't hear each other speak the manager said that there was nothing he could do. I don't think that this experience will stop me from eating hear however I will no longer have a large party. Have to add That our server Jake was really Fantastic,  he was very apologetic and we understood that their was really nothing that could be done. I even got up at one point and asked politely for the group to tone it down to no avail. In the end management did discount our bill and compd dessert . But one of my guests had to suggest this to the manager . Again the wait staff has always Been great and Jake helped to turn the situation around."
Lanisha C.,"Winnetka, Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/19/2017,"I try not to complain but this is the worse BJs ever. After various issues dining in, my husband & I decided to give takeout a try. We attempted to do the ""curb side"" option but after calling several times and never reaching anyone my husband found a parking spot (parking for this area is an entirely different issue) and ran in. After being inside for 10 minutes, he came out to tell me that his meal was ready but mine was not. I was surprised because I ordered a simple salad. Nevertheless he returned, meals in hand about 20 minutes later. Eat here at your own risk!"
