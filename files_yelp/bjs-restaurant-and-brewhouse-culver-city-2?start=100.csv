Brittany S.,"Hawthorne, CA",13,115,51,1.0,4/10/2017,"Waited 20 minutes for an appetizer to come out. My calamari was not fresh and then the wait to get my main order took 15 extra minutes to get back. They had everyone waiting, even people that came here first before us."
Derek K.,"Yokohama, Japan",366,503,1335,1.0,4/15/2015,"Rating: 20/100 pts BJ's is a chain restaurant/brewery that appears in a lot of malls and shopping areas, and thanks to a recent company dinner, I can say I've been to several locations enough times to form my opinion on them. Since I don't drink alcohol, this review is based solely on their food, which, on the whole, I find to be quite deplorable. Their signature ""deep"" dish pizza is a pretty sad affair. Though you may be tempted to order it, don't expect anything fancy. The cheese is rubbery, tomato sauce is absent, and it has a shocking reliance on low quality, high sodium toppings. It mostly ""deflates"" soon after being served, becoming more of a ""kinda thick"" dish pizza. This $20+ dud tastes like freezer food. Actually, I'm pretty sure it is. The spare ribs are almost tasteless, and the NY steak is overly tough. The best dish I've had has been their Parmesan Crusted Chicken. Though it is by no means phenomenal, coming in a light, lemony butter sauce, this was the only dish of the bunch I tried that I could actually chew without my internal ""dangerous substance"" sensors going off. For dessert, their menu touts their ""pizookies"". Although the concept of combining a pizza and a cookie sounds amazing in theory, in practice, it's as disappointing as it is a clumsy portmanteau. They're overly greasy, diabete-causingly sweet, and furthermore, not much resembling pizza. It's just an oversized cookie in a pizza pan with ice cream scooped on top. Pizookie? More like ""fiascookie"". (See, I can make bad portmanteaus too.) But I hate to be completely negative, so in fairness, here's their good points. The servers are pretty awesome, typically being cheerful and attentive. Too bad service tends to be sllllooooow as hell. It's not really the server's fault, though; try as they might, this place is just too huge to swiftly make the rounds. Most of the food is utterly diet-destructive, but the menus clearly state the caloric {mega}load of each item, allowing you to be strategic with how to deal your damage. Also, they have an ""enLightened"" section of the menu, which has some semi-healthy items to choose from. They're open late, and apparently have a lot of beer choices, if you're into that sort of thing. I was willing to give them 2 stars, but took one more off considering their prices. Overall, you're paying for way overpriced freezer food. But hey, if you're here for their bar, you may not even notice. I don't know what ""BJs"" stands for, and I'm fine with that."
Brandon E.,"Compton, CA",74,2,,3.0,7/29/2017,Great place the only thing that bothered me was the temperature was really cold so it made my food cold so only finish half of it
Ricardo G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/24/2017,Horrible service! Took them more than a hour to take down our food. Waiter never refilled the water during the dinner. First time here and never coming back.
Arion R.,"Chino Hills, CA",300,7,2,1.0,12/11/2016,"I've been to this location a few times and have been disappointed every time. Customer service is lacking and the food is mediocre. A few nights ago, I ordered a medium cheese pizza w/no tomatoes, a small BBQ pizza, and dessert. Arrived at pickup time and still had to wait an additional 10 minutes for the cheese pizza. (How hard is it to make?) Once home, I see they barely made the pizza at all! There was dry, burnt cheese in some parts and wet cheese on uncooked dough in others. AND they did not even put the cheese on the entire pizza. I was so disappointed as I was very HANGRY. I wanted to call and take it back, but did not have the energy as it was 9pm. I used to love BJs, but moving to LA has taught me to never eat at the chains."
Shaniqua W.,"Dallas, TX",87,7,,4.0,4/21/2017,The pazookie is always BOMB!! Christian and Contessa are amazing. Contessa gave awesome service :)
matthew w.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,20,9,2.0,10/20/2016,"Been here a few times and the place is just so so. But today, they really dropped the ball. Looks like they had a big party of like 20 and they didn't know how to handle everything. There was a gap between the service side and the kitchen and it really messed everything up. When we finally got seated it took around 15 minutes to order. When we finally ordered it took another 30 minutes... Just to get our salads. Haven't even taken a bit of our salad, and our main course is up. Asked for my steak medium rare, wasn't even cooked. Had to send it back and of course that was anther 15 minutes. By then I wasn't even hungry anymore. It was just a poor, disappointing experience to say the least.  I do want to mention Dareisha for working her butt off to try and satisfy us. It wasn't her fault everything was so out of order, she did try her best. Kudos to you But overall, it wasn't worth the time, the wait, or the hassle. They have a food court here and I'll be sticking with that"
Bill M.,"Studio City, Los Angeles, CA",44,30,138,1.0,8/29/2016,"Arrival was great, the hostess stand gentleman was gracious; however, it was all downhill from there. From the moment we were seated.  The booth was wet, I had to dry my seat. it took 15 minutes for someone to acknowledge we were in there section.  I asked for a new napkin - only to be given attitude.  It took approximately 15 minutes for the waiter to return, ""Alexis"". Condescending and not very accommodating.  We had to wait another 10 minutes for our drinks, the place was not that busy.  Management, a bit of training is needed on prioritizing lots of employees, nonchalant attitude and demeanor.  They brought my appetizer; no plates. I got up and asked the bartender for two plates, he handed them to me, he handed me two dirty dishes. Seriously.  Please  take care of your customers better. Our tab was $60 for two dinners and two drinks. Not wroth the price or service.  Much rather go to Yardhouse or CPK! Warm regards, Not coming back customer."
Matt W.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",1,3,,1.0,11/12/2017,"Super disappointed in the experience tonight. I actually enjoyed the food but the experience and the server ruined the evening. Decided to sit at the bar and enjoy a drink and watch Sunday night football. Ordered a barbecue chicken salad and a beer. After approximately 20 minutes I asked the bartender the status of the salad. He told me it had only been a couple minutes. When I said it had been several minutes he started to argue with me. He then left to check on it. The issue is he had printed the receipt and the time on it showed it had clearly been 20 minutes. It would have been fine if he had just admitted his mistake but his need to argue with me really ruined the night. I shared the story with the manager and did receive an apology. He spoke with the bartender who then proceeded to help everyone at the bar except for me. So word to the wise, if you decide to sit at the bar and don't feel like an argument avoid Nesly R. His service was a complete turnoff and probably won't be back for awhile."
Tyler W.,"San Gabriel, CA",3,5,,1.0,9/9/2016,"This review is about the service (or lack thereof) and not the food. Our server at dinner tonight was extremely disinterested and inattentive from the moment we sat down.  Between my brother and I, we ordered Calamari for an appetizer, The Italian Market flatbread pizza, Garlic Shrimp and Asparagus pasta and two drinks (as well as two glasses of water). My brother asked for no peperoncini's on the flatbread pizza and I asked for no cheese on the Garlic Shrimp and Asparagus pasta.  No plates were brought out for the appetizer, peperoncini's were on the flatbread pizza and cheese was sprinkled on top of the pasta. Had to track down our server to get my pasta sent back (he didn't apologize, but I think the general manager did) and my brother just picked off the peperoncini's rather than go through the hassle of getting another one made. Looking back, it was pretty obvious that our server wasn't paying attention at all when we ordered because we never got our glasses of water as well."
Emali A.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,13,6,1.0,10/5/2016,Negative 1 my experience was horrible service we got our salad but no utensils till 10 minutes later no refills at all it took 20 minutes to get my cheese and 38 minutes for the guy to bring my check smh and the nerve to want a tip horrible horrible horrible
LadyBug M.,"Los Angeles, CA",23,14,32,5.0,3/24/2017,"I love to give these type of reviews!!! Great place for family always busy but waiters are very nice. SPECIALLY BA! Great guy with a big smile and so happy! My 12yr old son asked for the manager because he wanted to tell him that he has an awesome employee. I decided to write it here,hoping  that the big guy sees it and awards him for his GREAT service."
Nicole D.,"Bristol, CT",341,1543,221,1.0,8/13/2016,"I had to go here for a meeting and it was pretty bad...the food was not appetizing and looked nothing like the photos in the menus. It's average, perhaps even below average, bar food at best. It's also way overpriced for the low quality."
Gianna R.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,72,3,1.0,2/20/2017,"In addition to being ignored when I first arrived - the 2 people at the front desk didn't look my way, but spoke with a man who came after me.  Sad face #1 I  ordered a Proseco. The server dropped off the unopened bottle on the table with my friend's drink.  When he returned to the table about 10 minutes later, my guest asked if he was going to open my drink.  He said, he'd be back -- he came back in a few minutes and opened my drink.  Sad face #2 My salad came first - after a few minutes, my friends's ziti arrived - then came my Brussel sprouts, and finally after a few minutes, my friends chicken wings appeared.  Sad face #3 When I gave the server my membership number and advised him that I would like to use my discount, the server put the number on our check but didn't apply a discount. Sad face #4 We arrived around 4:45ish (that's being generous), we didn't receive our bill until at least 20 minutes after we finished eating.  He never came back to see if we need anything...Sad face #5 & 6. This is not the type of service that I would have expected.  It was absolutely horrible.  If this were my first visit...I would NEVER RETURN."
Lessly D.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,10,11,5.0,6/2/2017,First time experiencing BJ's in Culver City. Experience and atmosphere was nice. Although we walk in around noon on a Friday it was already crowded however our server Julius was tentative to us despite the crowd.
Maruko X.,"Los Angeles, CA",1151,1703,12576,2.0,4/1/2015,"Ambiance: spacious and bright restaurant with millions of items on the menu Service: some severs are not friendly, food delivery was slow Food: in general ok   Crispy Jalapeño Burger - *** fried jalapeños, pepper jack cheese, chipotle mayonnaise,Baka sauce, red onions, tomatoes, lettuce and cilantro on a toasted bun. Price: reasonably priced"
Julia I.,"Los Angeles, CA",127,2,,1.0,10/4/2017,"Usually SO GREAT. I always get pazooki's but this time I ordered to-go and they gave my order to the wrong person. They put my order in for priority and still took 30 MINUTES just for 3 pazookis... when we received, they were overly cooked and not proportional. Never doing to-go again!"
Kathy J.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",0,29,,5.0,10/4/2017,"Came here for early dinner around 4:30 on Monday October 2nd. Friendly greeting and we were seated in a couple of minutes. Our server Armando was very friendly and took our orders very quickly. Our drinks, Wine for me and a beer for my son came along right away with our hot calamari appetizer. Delish! We each had a salad, the wedge with bleu cheese for myself and Cesar for my son. They were cold and fresh and crunchy good. Next, I had the fish and chips and my son had a meat and cheese pizza which came on a hot board. It was huge! Fish and chips were great, 4 very large pieces of fish and a very generous helping of hot fries along with a Remoulade sauce to die for! I had to take most of my fish and fries home as I was so full from everything else so I didn't have to cook dinner the next day! Bonus! Armando came by frequently to check that all was well. Very efficient and friendly, good going Armando! A very nice experience, will definitely came back and recommend this restaurant!"
Virginia M.,"Los Angeles, CA",37,313,340,1.0,4/16/2016,"I am a fan of the BJs in Torrance, but since I live in CC, this location is way closer. However, I probably could've driven to Torrance and back in the time it took for me to order and get my meal from this place! Slow service, until it was time for us to pay--then all of our sudden our waitress was passing by every other second. Finally she announced that she was leaving so could we pay now and then stay as long as we needed. How convenient. Saw her 15 minutes later and she was still serving so I'm guessing she just wanted to be sure we were good for a tip (which we were, even though we hardly saw her, got no refills and had to clear the dirty plates ourselves). Mind you, this was around 2pm during the week-- definitely not rush hour. Subpar food. I will not be back."
