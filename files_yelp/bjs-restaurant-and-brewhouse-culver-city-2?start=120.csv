Adenike B.,"Gardena, CA",20,36,2,5.0,5/20/2017,Julius R was our server today and he was excellent ! Tried really hard to make sure we had everything we needed. My husband is very picky & particular when it comes to his food  was very happy with the service & overall experience. Thanks Julius !
Carlotta B.,"Carrollton, TX",150,10,,1.0,12/14/2016,"Is there a way to give a 0 rating?! OMG!! Service is terrible and the wait staff & management team could care less! We have been seated for 20 minutes & several wait staff have passed...no acknowledgement! When we ask for our server, she comes over w/nothing to write on. Oh! Did I tell you we're a party of 6!! Trying to make light of the situation I ask, ""are you going to remember all of this?"" She responds, ""oh yes, I have it"". Needless to say we're still missing silverware, plates & sweetener for the tea!  However, they've brought out 2 of the 3 appetizers we've ordered!"
Brian R.,"Bellflower, CA",81,4,2,1.0,2/4/2017,Absolutely terrible service. Came in as a party of 2 just my wife and I and we were asked to sit and wait for a table during the time we were waiting 2 separate parties came in after we did and we're immediately seated without any wait at all. We brought to the hostess attention which I believe was the manager and she sit us in a crowded corner seat which we declined because we did want to be comfortable.  She did seat us at another table shortly after and we never saw a server at all until we were getting up to leave and go to another restaurant.  I have never had this experience at BJ'S before
Cherise N.,"Pinole, CA",77,161,411,4.0,4/9/2016,"I wish I remembered our waitress's name, but she was amazing!!! We came here for lunch on a Saturday. Wrong move we did, because the mall was packed and we had to park in the parking garage which was already filled with traffic. Womp! We waited about 15 minutes to be seated. I really can't remember our waitress's name, but she was helpful and friendly and gave us a complimentary pizookie (I hope that's how you spell it). I ordered the honey sriracha brussels sprouts. This was amazing!! I even tried making it myself (it was good but not as good as this). My fellow eaters all ordered piadinas. They said it was good. Because it was my sister's birthday she got a complimentary pizookie. We ordered the new monkey bread pizookie to join in on the fun. The monkey bread pizookie was great! It was an overall great experience."
Kathy H.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,29,4,5.0,5/1/2017,"Disclaimer.....I love BJ's so my review may be partial.  That being said I do give bad reviews when warranted.  I hesitated coming to this BJ's because of the bad reivew's..I guess it goes to show that not all reviews good or bad may be accurate.  I have been to this BJ's 3x in the last 6 months and have never had a bad experience.  The food is always spot on, great menu choices and who doesn't love a hot poozoki? The service I have had has always been excellent so no negative review here.  Want to give a shout out to our bartender Mike!  Thank you Mike for your attentiveness  to our party!  Will be coming back for sure!"
Alejandro P.,"Santa Fe Springs, CA",9,3,,5.0,12/17/2016,Was here last night with my friend. We were starving after all the shipping we did. Our server was Kayla M. Great server we had the barbacoa chicken and my friend the turkey burger came out quick and she kept checking on us. We ask to speak to the manager because now a days people only want to speak to mangers for negative reasons. The manager Luis came over I explain how great the food was and how Kayla was great. I told him that we had a great experience. He thank us for taking the time to give possitive feet back. We will be back and will be asking for the same server. Thanks bjs. PS. Bring back the pumpkin pizzookie
Stacy W.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,27,29,5.0,11/28/2016,"I love this place for lunch, alone, with the family, on a date. It's a nice environment close to the mall so you can shop then eat or eat then shop. Big screen tv's all around the restaurant so there is no problem catching a game on the big screen. Customer service is great & the food is always hot when served"
Bill P.,"Inglewood, CA",2,26,,5.0,9/13/2017,The food is excellent My wife and I tried it and its a sports bar / eatery ...the service is fantastic. The Sin City location to me is the bee's knees.
Jon T.,"Fremont, CA",937,879,43,2.0,6/28/2016,"This place is pretty bad, the service is slow and hosts/hostesses are really slow as well. I only come here sometimes because my damn stomach craves their pizzookie. Food is average but honestly for their prices I would expect better"
Mikisha S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,2.0,9/16/2017,"Terrible waiter (Chris) slow and inactive, it's like do you wanna work or not. Speaking low and walking slow! Shit like this makes you wanna walk and never return! I mean fuck get it right."
The E.,"Norwalk, CA",0,9,40,4.0,11/17/2016,Coming here for the first time i was welcomed with a great first impression! The waiter was going to seat me and my family at a table and i asked if we can sit at a booth better and without hesitation he seated us to a booth! i ordered a strawberry lemonade and boy was it sweet and delicious just how i love it ! so i ordered a chicken club and instead of sting fries i asked for a house salad and got it ! super delicious and drenched in ranch just how like my salad . salad and calamari came by real quick . the waiter jose is a very nice guy . When my chicken club the chef accidentally put fries as well. fries were rather stale not a fan of the fries here anyways. sandwhich was excellent . everything was average . pretty decent Bjs.
Azita A.,"Los Angeles, CA",47,75,87,1.0,4/1/2017,"We asked for table for 2 ( Saturday 7:00 pm) and the hostess directed us to the waiting chairs "" there is no wait time for two"". We sat there witting and nobody called us. Then another party of two showed up and immediately were given a table!!! Not sure what to call this. Never will come again."
John Q.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,7,1,1.0,12/2/2016,Worst experience ever. Specially with that server who seem didnt want to work there kimberly g... if u get her make sure u change server. Food took at  least 1hr to come out. They even forgot my lemon thyme chicken when i order it about. They gave me a 25 dollar gift card for theier service. Worst experience ever!!
Jeff L.,"Los Angeles, CA",16,4,,1.0,2/24/2017,"I'm never eating here again and it really has nothing to do with the restaurant initially. Parking is horrible. My wife and I got take out and they have about 10 spaces for the people ordering take out. I waited 15 minutes and not one person came out with take out. Eventually my wife came out with the food and somebody came out with a 12 year old kid, no take out, and drove away from one of the spaces.... I told security about the problem and he said, ""well... we have a lot of restaurants using those spaces,"" which insults my intelligence because what difference does it make. People are parking there and just eating and coming out, not as take out customers but as regular customers.  To add to the madness that this place is, the food was cold and dry."
Alejandro R.,"Fox Hills, Culver City, CA",28,1,,1.0,9/27/2017,"So I walk into this restaurant with my wife and 4 month old daughter, I was going to treat my wife  for dinner and we walked in and asked for a table for two and a stroller and the employee at the desk said that we couldn't eat there do to the fact that we had a stroller. I was shocked that she had the nerve to say that. They wouldn't let us eat at a family restaurant because we had a newborn in a stroller. She basically said that we had to leave the stroller outside in the lobby while we had dinner. So she basically wanted us to hold our newborn daughter in our arms while we had our dinner. If I could give this restaurant 0 stars I would. This is the last Draw. We've had problems here before mainly due to the fact that  they take forever to seat you and bring your food out cold. I've never been treated so badly at a restaurant like the cheesecake factory, he'll not even norms. They lost a customer for sure."
Taisha O.,"Watts, Los Angeles, CA",7,5,1,5.0,4/15/2017,Julius was an amazing server!! He made our night tonight! His service was the best and I will be coming back.
Kerri H.,"Torrance, CA",1489,638,2719,4.0,2/27/2015,"I love BJs but this particular branch is always busy with a very long wait. The parking is not too easy to get to.   But the service is friendly, just very packed."
Christina V.,"Norwalk, CA",30,2,,4.0,4/22/2017,I love bj's! Our server Julius was super friendly and helpful.  The fried artichoke was so good too
Brenan W.,"Inglewood, CA",0,1,1,5.0,4/28/2017,"We came in for my friends birthday, aside of the great waitress we had. Felix the night manager was soooo amazing and took care of our visit and the food and service was amazing man! Thanks BJs Culver City!! Keep up the great work Felix....."
Charles M.,"Seattle, WA",11,1,,1.0,9/12/2017,"Wow, terrible service, poor quality food, no concern for the customer. I have never posted a review before but this place forced the issue. My only question is why yelp doesn't allow a zero rating."
