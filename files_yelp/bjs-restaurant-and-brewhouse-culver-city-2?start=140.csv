Brian G.,"Sun Valley, Los Angeles, CA",0,12,1,1.0,5/12/2017,Been to lots of bj's and I was very disappointed with the service at this Location. The orders were wrong.  Better service and quality from other locations. Spend the time and drive to another location.
Antonia J.,"Woodland Hills, CA",2,4,,5.0,4/9/2017,Stevey's customer service was amazing. I can't wait to come back because of her. She knew the menu very well answered all the questions I had. She made sure to check on us at all times. I seen her moving nonstop and she kept a great attitude the whole time. It's rare I do Yelp reviews but she deserved it!
Jet'aime H.,"Los Angeles, CA",24,3,,4.0,4/23/2017,"My Experience Was Great Thanx To Julius, He Had Great Recommendations Very Skilled At The Art Of Customer Service. If You Want A Good Experience Be Sure To Ask For Julius & Ask What He Recommends"
Tyreese B.,"Los Angeles, CA",63,10,1,5.0,4/20/2017,"BJ's is one of my favorite restaurants where you can kick back and enjoy incredible flavors of food from an extensive ever evolving magazine style menu. The atmosphere is a sophisticated entertainment bar and grill without the pretense of feeling out of place. Anyone can feel at home in this aesthetically pleasing designed establishment. I recently visited the Culver City location with two friends, one in which who have never been to BJ's. We had a little miscommunication with our food order once it came out. My friend's order was not quite as expected but our gracious, exceptional server Natasha saved the day. She immediately asked the kitchen to correct the order. In the meantime, she gave my friend a hearty complimentary caesar salad until his meal came. On top of that, she also gave us dessert to make up for my friend's first experience at BJ's. With stellar, assiduous and amicable servers like Natasha, we will definitely come back to the Culver City location."
Michael J.,"Carson, CA",142,8,1,1.0,3/11/2017,"3-10-17 night shift.  So I had all this time to write this review. This is me being nice. Imagine me cussing and throwing f bombs every sentence.  Walked in on a Friday asking the hostess about happy hour (I know that there isn't any on fridays and Saturdays but doesn't hurt to ask) hostess says that there is happy hour today after 10pm (it's about 10) she told us to go find a seat at the bar for happy hour. Ok cool Got to an open seat waited for 20 mins to get it cleaned up. Waited another 20 mins to find out no happy hour. No biggie. Then waited for an hour for food. In the meanwhile, 2 other groups came in about 20 mins after we got seated and got there food (pizza and other entrees)  and left and paid, before we even received our food (a pizokie and sliders). Finished my water, and Once I got my food it took about another 20 mins to get a refill. The server was really busy and by herself. Can't blame the 1 server and busser. They are well understaffed. Blaming management. And the hostess  (suppressed rage released) like it's the only job you have and you can't even get that right. How does the costumer know more than you. This is why minimum wage should be lower."
Anabell B.,"Westchester / LAX, Los Angeles, CA",5,10,7,1.0,12/19/2016,Basically what other reviews have said. Service is not that good here. I would not recommend this place.
Tiffany L.,"San Francisco, CA",0,3,2,5.0,4/16/2017,"I called ahead within there 30 minute time frame for seating on a Friday night, table was ready for my party of 6 when I got there. Staff was friendly and quick. Great food! Deep dish ziti was awesome!"
Thomas J.,"Lakewood, CA",279,1,,5.0,4/15/2017,Julius was our server tonight. He was the best!!! He was on top of everything and was very quick and friendly. My experience tonight would definitely make me come back!
Bruce M.,"Tarzana, Los Angeles, CA",177,1,,1.0,5/3/2017,"I like other BJ locations, but at this one I ordered no aioli on my burger, got aioli with no cheese so I asked for the correct burger, and our waiter said they would make a new burger. It took so long to return, I figured they had made a new one. When t returned, it had a new bun, but there was still aioli on the mushroom where they had not wiped it all off. The waiter then tried to tell me it was new until I pointed out where there was aioli. I didn't even want another burger after that and went to the food court."
Reggie H.,"Memphis, TN",93,9,32,4.0,9/24/2016,"I had an amazing time at BJ's the deep dish pizza was awesome and wings was extra crispy just the way I love them! Only problem I had was a smell that was coming from beneath my table, it was like a sour stink. The waitress was nice but didn't know how to balance her customers , at times I waited for silverware after getting my food. Also my glass stayed dry due to her not constantly checking on me. I've been in the Restaurant/Club business for nearly 25 years, one thing I trained my employees is customer service to ensure repeat customer and great pay. Over all the atmosphere was amazing and people were friendly. #SayNoMore #FatmacEntertainment"
Alfred L.,"San Francisco, CA",222,2,,1.0,9/10/2017,Been to many BJ's and this one is terrible. Took 45 minutes for our food to come and once it did it was dry and cold. There were only 20 people in the restaurant. Server didn't give us any refills either.
Garrett B.,"Firestone, CO",0,32,32,5.0,1/15/2017,"We had a soccer team stop in here on a Saturday Night.  Exhausted from the day and traveling from another state and with little options in the area for large groups, we called ahead and asked if they could seat 24 people.  Tough sell on a playoff football night.  Erica the manager took our number and said she would do her best to accommodate us by time got there.   When we arrived, a line was out the door, but Erica told us it would be soon. 10 minutes, later, we had our seats all together  in the corner.  Awesome! Next, was Jaime, our poor waiter had to deal with tired and hungry teens. What a job he did!  Fast, prompt service, going the extra miles on everything.  Can't say enough. Superb! The food was great and worked for all. Thanks Erica and Jaime, please give these two some recognition!!!!"
Rebecca M.,"Marina del Rey, CA",0,5,,4.0,7/27/2016,"Sometimes it's just one of those days!! We went in for a quick dinner after shopping tonight. We were seated quickly, and acknowledged by the server.  Our server was covering about 20 tables by herself but was quick to bring us drinks and take our appetizer order.  Our appetizer was inadvertently taken to the table next to us, and the people did not say anything, they just ate it. The waitress realized what happened, so she put in another order for us. The second one was undercooked. We did receive a hot appetizer and our meal.  The manager was table side several times making sure we were happy, taking care of adjusting the bill.  After some confusion it look like they got the server situation rectified.  All three servers waiting  on our area were pleasant and professional. Everyone had a smile.   I want to thank the manager who was extremely kind, patient and willing to go above and beyond to make sure our experience was a good one, considering the problems with our food order tonight. I think the kitchen was just having an off night. The stars are for great customer service."
Jennifer N.,"Hawthorne, CA",178,297,127,2.0,11/18/2015,"BJ's is known for pretty ok food with high calories and sodium where you can watch a game or 2. This place in particular I have been to at least 5x and without fail, the service is TERRIBLE. I can't necessarily blame the waiter as he always looked stressed but behind. I can't tell if this was his fault or not but if it isn't then they are too understaffed. He forgot my sisters salad entirely and my cousins burger came out ice cold. We knew the new one wouldn't come until we were totally ready to leave so he just bit the bullet and ate it cold. My hot sauce came after i was done with my Ziti which i would have bet money was going to happen. My Ziti had to have been sitting under a heat lamp because the noodles were hard on top and dried out. If it weren't for the location we would never keep coming back but we fall for it every time."
Dave H.,"Truckee, CA",555,276,1327,4.0,1/9/2016,"Food was good but drama was crazy.  So.....the place is full, some sort of commotion occurs outside and spills inside.  The dude is bloody and yelling at everone, challenging them to fight.  Culver City's finest arrives and it's on.  The dude is fighting and it takes 6 to take him into custody.  Patrons run out on the bill, total chaos. Waiter was fast and excellent.  Got us beers right away.  I ordered the jambalaya and my son ordered a oizza.  Excellent on both.  We had the siracha baked Brussel sprouts.  Iksy, I'm not a fan of Brussel spruots, but they made them taste really good.  I'll be back again, for the food, but not tge drama"
Gustavo O.,"Newbury Park, CA",29,9,,4.0,6/10/2016,"I had a great experience with Charles last week. My girlfriend and I came in craving good burgers and wedge fries. She got the Chili Burg and I went with the Hickory Brisket. Her fries came out wrong but Charles fixed it right away. The Burgers were great and the wedge fries were everything I remembered (though they could have been warmer). After a small debate we said no to a pizookie but immediately regretted that decision as we made our way toward the door. As if he knew, Charles stopped us on our way out and presented us with a mini pizookie wrapped to go. Wow. Legendary Service!"
Kevin G.,"Warrenton, VA",1,9,3,1.0,8/24/2015,Very disappointing quality.  I ordered the ahi tuna salad and it came with about half of the tuna that's shown in the menu pic.   The roasted brussel sprouts were really good though.
Bruce L.,"Lawndale, CA",0,6,3,1.0,3/5/2017,"BAD, BAD, BAD!!! These folk fail at every aspect of the restaurant business. FYI, doesn't look like they like to clean that much either. STAY AWAY!!!!"
Brandie H.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,19,,1.0,3/3/2017,"I will never eat here again. Ordering Togo, paid for the meal and everything and the staff just couldn't get me my meal. I'm tired of going in there and the front house staff has horrible customer service. I hate bringing that type of energy into Yelp but it needs to be known that this Bj's has the worse customer service in Culver City."
Daniel P.,"Los Angeles, CA",583,3,,5.0,4/15/2017,Julius was extremely polite and very professional with our order and keeping the vibes positive! Deff 5 stars and hope to be served by him again when I come back!
