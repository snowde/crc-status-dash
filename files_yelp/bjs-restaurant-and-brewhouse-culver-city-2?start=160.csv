Damian D.,"Los Angeles, CA",63,17,14,3.0,4/2/2017,Ended up biting a bone while trying to eat my burger but the fries were okay and the customer service wasn't bad.
Rasool D.,"Culver City, CA",133,1,,5.0,4/2/2017,"I love this BJ's it has great service and great food and the location is perfect, the host we're nice and got me seated right away and my server was amazing if you go ask for Alex she is the best!!"
Harmony S.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,1,,2.0,3/26/2017,"The service was painfully slow and inattentive. The food was just okay, although I did like the spinach dip. Probably won't go back though."
Martin G.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,13,3,2.0,12/7/2016,"My family of four decided to have dinner @BJ after shopping at the mall. This was our second time eating at a BJ and after our experience, Now I remember why we rather eat at Olive Garden, sizzler, or island... First, it took about 15 min. for waitress to come to our table and take our drink order. After getting our drinks, we placed our order, which took close to 45-50 mins (and it wasn't busy). Between the initial drinks and the food coming to our table, we sat there with empty cups. Oh did I mention that when my son received his chicken boneless wings (nuggets) the waitress did not bring utensils nor napkins I had to ask for it. Shortly after the first plate my second son received his bacon burger, which he wasn't satisfied because it only had two strips of bacon (and he is only 13), what would he know about food, oh did I mention that I asked again for utensil and napkins a second time and refills. So, my wife's salad and my pasta deep dish plate follow, and Yes we had to ask again for a third time for utensils and napkins! We thought it was just us, but we witness the same service with the two ladies sitting across from us, as they got there meals and sat there for about three minutes waiting for utensil as there food was getting cold.  At the end of our dinner nothing wowed us about the meals we had, in fact we walked away wishing we would of being more satisfied going down the street to island or sizzler . As for the service, I think BJ could follow Olive Gardens, sizzler or Islands table service.  Please understand that this review was base on our experience, but seems like others have had the same issues."
Gwen R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/15/2016,"Lousy!  I ordered via labite and clearly the restaurant knows when it's a take out order. I ordered a steak medium well. It arrived heavily salted, too spicy and BURNT!  It's my fault because tried this once before. Same result. Why wouldn't the restaurant want to have pride in every order?  This is my first yelp review although I've had an account for years. Never again!  Shame on you BJs!"
Izzat A.,"Arlington, VA",89,1323,12,3.0,6/20/2016,This location was slammed and we had to wait about 15 minutes for a table of 3. Floors were pretty nasty and sticky. Service was just okay. Tried a pizookie for the first time and thought it was pretty good. Will keep on eating the pizzokie but prolly won't come back to this location. Not on a Friday night atleast.
Haley K.,"San Jose, CA",499,405,720,2.0,11/22/2015,"I'm not sure if all the bjs are going downhill or if it's just the ones I've been to lately, but this is the second one in a row that's had the same issue. My friend and I got there on Saturday around 130pm. It was pretty busy, but we were seated right away. There were two large parties of 20+ people but luckily they had already been served or were being served so I figured service wouldn't be too bad. I was wrong. We were seated for 10 minutes before anyone came by to introduce themselves and take our drink order. By this time we had already decided what to get. My friend got the mini pizza and salad lunch special and I decided to get the small pizza to have some leftover for lunch the next day. The waitress repeated our order and most was incorrect so we re corrected her. We were hopeful she would get the order right when placing it. Nope, we were wrong. It took about 30 minutes once we placed the order for our food to come out (my friends salad came first). Once the food came out we realized the pizza were the same size, a mini. I ordered a small. I didn't mind it was a mini but I would have ordered the lunch special if that was the case (it was $4 cheaper and came with a salad). We explained and the waitress apologized and asked if I wanted to wait for the small. No I didn't want to wait another 30 minutes. They were nice and ended up giving us $5 off, but service overall was terrible. We didn't see our waitress half the time, the bathrooms were dirty and only 2 stalls had toilet paper.  Basically, I won't be coming back to this location."
Leah A.,"Jacksonville, FL",951,1062,9238,2.0,12/10/2015,"Yes, I know. BJ's is your typical chain restaurant that serves up American favorites, including deep dish pizzas, salads, sandwiches, pastas, steaks, baby back ribs and a gazillion other things on their menu. Plus, you can have beer--lots of it. Yay. They are not mind-blowing. Honestly, it's a good place to go for BJ's Famous Pizookie. I like the original chocolate chunk cookie with vanilla ice cream, but it's hardly enough for me to share. I definitely think they've shrunk over the years. But what can you do? Overall, it's an OK place for a little appetizers with the group to share and drink some beers on tap. I usually get a flight, but again they are run-of-the-mill beers nothing too impressive. Probably won't frequent this chain restaurant except for every once in a blue moon.  Oh well."
Stephen M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,14,12,4.0,3/16/2017,Had this amazing burger with fries and so did my girlfriend. She had got a root beer float and they gave her barely any root beer and ice cream. For $4.25 I expected more. Otherwise great to eat
Lucy D.,"Los Angeles, CA",292,20,32,2.0,9/23/2016,"This BJ's used to be so good a couple of years ago. It used to be one of my boyfriend's and my ""go to"" places to eat when we just could not decide where to go to dinner. The past several times I have eaten there the service has been down right lousey. On our most recent visit - the restuarant was not super crowded - we sat there for 10 minutes waiting for someone to just and come take our drink orders. I hate when that happens and it sours the rest of dining experience. We ended up walking out and going to eat somewhere else. The few times before service was lacking as well in various ways; empty drinks with no server in sight for a refill and waiting too long for our check. Unfortunately they have also recently raised the prices of some of our favorite menu items - the steak. This BJ's has been crossed of our list after too many second chances."
Julie R.,"Fresno, CA",1,4,,2.0,7/31/2017,Waitress seemed stressed. All fries we had with our meals were cold.  Don't think I would recommend this BJ's
Alicia O.,"Lynwood, CA",213,216,188,4.0,10/31/2016,Went here a lot when I worked down the street. Bar staff was always friendly and quick with the service. Their small eats menu was perfect for the 'I want to avoid rush hour traffic' time.
Mia T.,"Southwest, Las Vegas, NV",0,3,1,2.0,9/17/2017,"Save your time and money from this location. They are in a prime location within a busy mall and cannot keep up with the fast paced environment. We were seated very promptly but our server took it amongst herself to greet/serve other tables that were seated after us. We had to get the attention of a manager (who was very helpful) just to get something as basic as water. I've worked in hospitality so I understand it getting busy and not being able to immediately come to a table but if she had even acknowledged us to let us know that she was busy and would be with us in a moment then I wouldn't have been as upset. When she finally did approach us on the request of her manager, she had an attitude for being called out on her mistake and did not apologize..so that already shifted the entire mood of our meal. Long story short, we ended up packing up everything to go within 5 minutes of getting our food because the overall experience was that horrible. The manager was helpful but I don't accept apologies on behalf of somebody that won't even acknowledge that they're in the wrong. This location needs stronger servers who can keep up with their crowd."
Desiree C.,"Long Beach, CA",184,11,,1.0,7/10/2016,"By far the WORST BJ's I've ever been to. Let me start off with the wait time to have a waitress come and assist us. Took about 15-20 mins for our waiter to actually come to our table (we didn't complain). We were never given utensils until 10 minutes after our food was served. Like seriously utensils should be at the table before our food. The Strawberry Lemonade I ordered was merky and foamy and looked more like a michelada then any strawberry Lemonade I've ever had. Gross. I was hoping the Shrimp and Asparagus Penne would make up for it all and boy was I wrong. It was cold and dry, had almost no sauce. Let me mention all the tables around me were complaining about the service, food, and the fact that they too had no utensils with their food.  I love Bj's. One of my favorite restaurants, but this was by far the worst Bj's ever. Don't come here."
Beatrice J.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,2,2.0,2/22/2016,"Well...went to bjs tonight for my granddaughters bithday. The food was good, actually I had the Quinoa Salad And it was fantastic..But the svc was the poorest svc I  have ever experienced...I asked for two checks and it didn't come that way.. she never took the dirty plates off the table. We would ask for something and it took forever to get it..she literally said I forgot.....Rediculous.....just the lousiet SVC I have ever experienced"
Johnay P.,"Los Angeles, CA",84,2,9,3.0,7/6/2016,"Yesterday my friend and I cane directly from the airport craving their delicious soup in a bread bowl, and we encountered the worst service ever. Ashler waited our table and to my surprise she was , snappy, rude, and inattentive. We had to flag her down every time we needed service. Our drinks were refillable, yet we were offered no refills, our desserts were served on a cluttered table along with the desserts being served cold, while promised on the menu to be  hot. My standard's are to be polite, and tip, and it was difficult to do either one. This location always has terrible servicers who seem to tired to smile and be courteous."
Gabie L.,"Los Angeles, CA",32,75,257,1.0,12/16/2015,"My husband and I went there around 8:30ish. Not much busy so we got a table right away. We ordered avocado egg rolls, pizza, and portobello burger. I thought the portobello burger is a vegetarian menu so I got a bite without any doubt when the food came. There was a meat patty in it.. I should ask a server whether the portobello burger is a vegetarian option or not....... Why didn't our server asked me though. Anyway, our server gave plates for us but she put cash (guess that's her tips from other customers so she put them on the plate) on the plate and took them back once she gave the plates us. cash is pretty dirty and that shouldn't be on the plate. I will definitely not come back here even if I'm super hungry.  Anyway, our server is pretty fast and seems professional."
Keisha W.,"Compton, CA",35,2,,4.0,7/28/2017,"Had a wonderful time.  Awesome food!  Had the: Root beer chicken wings,  artichoke spinach dip,  garden salad & Caesar salad,  root beer ribs,  parmesan chicken,  chicken fettuccini Alfredo. Everything was wonderful.  Thank you to Dario and Felix for making our visit special and memorable."
D R.,"Upland, CA",0,16,,5.0,7/7/2017,"Went for lunch, Julius, our waiter, got us in and out quickly.  He made our experience very pleasant; was always a step ahead of us: refilling drinks before we asked and suggesting  substitutes."
Andre W.,"Inglewood, CA",0,12,4,1.0,8/7/2016,"I have been to BJ's many times and I love their foot. The entire menu is great tasting food. Mouth watering and delicious.  I took one of my girlfriends for dinner the other night. And, to start off, the waitress was I guess having a bad shift. Well anyway, we ordered our food at around 7:30. Our drinks came right away so we enjoyed or drinks.  I look at my watch and it's now 8:05 and our food is not ready. I ask the waitress, "" How much longer will it take for our food "". Her reply was, "" Let me go see ""! With an attitude! She came back about 10 minutes later and informs me that the chef is very busy creating and gaining his food making motivation.  All and all, our food arrives for our eating to finally begin. The time was 8:55! One hour and 25 minutes after we ordered!  This damn food was all screwed up! My ladies food was well past done and my food was burnt to a total crisp! My food looked like a plate of charcoal was placed on it!  I immediately summoned the manager to discuss this MF foolishness!  The manager walks over to our table and I display my displeasure in this terrible service and the food! He tells me that he is sorry for what happened and informed me that I could have two free meals of any cost the next two visits. I can really care less about free food so, I refused that offer. I just wanted an explanation why the waitress was horrible and why the chef took so long cooking our food.  The manager explained that the chef is the best that they have and he cooks on his emotional contacts. Chef J always flirts with female customers and frequently while cooking, he will take one female customer in the back and have sex with her while cooking. That's his emotional contact that helps him cook and create.  The waitress is his girlfriend and she get jealous mad and upset at what he does!  I was totally and completely flabbergasted at what I just heard! I was at a total loss of words and completely puzzled.  I have a difficult time seeing a chef cooking and boning while at work in the kitchen.  Very crazy to think about!"
