George V.,"Alhambra, CA",0,71,74,5.0,6/22/2016,"I come here when I've had a rough week. Ariel is an above a well average server. I love it when the server provides side notes on their food items, which is extremely rare and Ariel did this when I exposed my deer in headlight look. Great lunch specials and awesome TV space. They offer two types of fries!"
Bronwen E.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,6,2.0,2/1/2017,"We came for a birthday dinner.  My first time here, had heard they had good food.  Everyone was nice and we got seated right away,  The waiter took so long to come by we were able to order drinks and our dinner.  I like it when you can get a drink in before dinner.  We both had a steak and my toddler son had a corn dog.  The food was OK.  I am not a good cook and even I could have made that steak.  With the service being so slow the food being average and the parking SUCKS I will not be back."
Veronica M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/8/2017,"I haven't been to BJ's in a while and wanted to try out my local one, but I should of gone somewhere else. The service was horrible!!! The food was not hot, but luke warm. Even the beer was room temperature. Our appetizer plates never got picked up. Our server never introduced herself and I left feeling unhappy!!! Don't waste your time at this location. You get better service at chick fil-a. To top it off they gave us the wrong bill."
A P.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,34,14,1.0,5/24/2015,"Not, nope, never, noooooooo way will I ever return! UGHHHH & EWWWW! I've now tried BJ's a handful of times. I would describe my experience with this large chain restaurant as very mixed. I would rate all of these experiences from horrible to just meh... the food filled up the void. This last visit was the ""hair"" that broke the camel's back! Let's start with the overall quality of the food: Mediocre at best. The food is fairly bland and unremarkable. Regarding how well the food is prepared: Poor.  On one occasion, I ordered salmon. It didn't just come out blackened, it came out burnt. As well, the sauce was missing. The so-called roasted asparagus turned into something resembling, inedible, fibrous hay. The rice pilaf was a tasteless pile. Temperature of all of the food was lukewarm to cold. I had to send every single thing back to the kitchen and pray no one hocked up a loogie on what replaced it. The replacement meal was a slight improvement and they gave me a free pizookie dessert. The pizookie was the best part of the whole meal. Oy! Most of the other meals I had here were of similar caliber. Service:  I know others have complained about service, but I've always received adequate to excellent service. Ambience: Extremely noisy! Very loud chatter accompanied by multiple TVs displaying sports events. Now, for my most recent visit, the one that finally pushed me over the edge: I ordered a mozzarella and tomato salad and actually, I was quite surprised at how good it tasted. It was well spiced and the portion was generous. The textures were also interesting, a slight crunch accompanied the softness of the mozzarella and fresh tomatoes. The dish was finished with a visually interesting pattern of balsamic vinegar sauce. Then IT appeared! Just as I was about to enjoy the nearly last mouthful of tiny, cute, round, plump mozzarella balls, I spotted IT! YIKES GADZOOKS, OH MYYYY. There was a curly HAIR resting ever so gently on my mozzarella ball! Oy!  Sheeeesh. Gives new meaning to the word hairball! I called the manager over and the hair convo went something like this: Disgusted diner: ""Hi, do you know that the human hair is one of the dirtiest things on the planet? The guys in the back wear hair nets?"" Manager: ""Yes, we follow all health department rules and regulations."" Disgusted diner: ""Well, I guess one, little hair just snuck out!"" Manager: ""Oh, I'm so sorry that happened to you, would you like another one?"" Disgusted diner: ""No, I don't want another HAIR!"" Manager: ""Is there something else I can get for you?"" Disgusted diner: ""No thank you."" Then, the manager patted my back in a very awkward, creepy fashion I found totally creepy and awkward. Disgusted diner: ""I think you should comp my meal."" Manager: ""Hmmmm."" Then, he walked away. The sweet server returned and said she would speak to him. She did, and he comped the meal. I made sure to tip her anyway, but she was surprised. Wasn't her fault. She deserves to work in a better restaurant. I hope her tips are never lacking or reduced due to poor food. After this debacle, I did choke down some of the mediocre main course, but my appetite hadn't recovered. King Tux, my BFF foodie review partner was very dismayed he didn't get to sample anything. Now, he's really, really pissed at me. Poor guy just didn't understand!"
Mr And Mrs V.,"Orange County, CA",1,36,39,3.0,11/17/2016,Love BJ's but today was disappointing. We ordered the calamari and it wasn't as tasty as other times. The Blood Orange Pom Sangria tasted like fireball. Service from Jose was great though.
Chris G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,49,13,3.0,7/10/2016,"Drinks were quick, no waiting... Don't order the chips and guacamole. More chips than guac to spread. What I'm suppose to do with extra chips that are left?  Boneless wings were great! Club sandwich was good. Portions are ok. Probably wouldn't waste my time or money coming back."
Erik H.,"San Francisco, CA",10,34,,1.0,11/22/2016,"Seated during a not busy time, server took 15 minutes to even acknowledge us. Ordered, informed waitress of a few things to be left off my order due to allergy. Drinks took another 15 minutes for water and one glass of wine. Opened napkin, silverware inside was dirty. Had to get replacement myself, waitress no where to be seen. Food arrived, things requested to be left off were there, one of the items I didn't discover until I bit into it. Spit it out, but damage was done, started swelling.  They replaced my burger with a mostly raw, still wrong order. At least the fries were OK. Bill came, they tried to charge me for two burgers. Had to run and find medicine to not have to go to ER/die. Will never eat here or at any BJ's ever again."
Alex C.,"Los Angeles, CA",134,15,8,1.0,11/20/2016,"First the hostess pretty much pointed her finger and said sit ""anywhere over there somewhere"". I asked her to please direct me and a friend of mine to a booth. She took us to a booth that was still dirty from the people before us. We sat down and it took a bus boy about 6 minutes to finally get there and take the plates and fake wipe the table with a dirty ass dish rag that stunk the whole space up till we left. I can keep going but long story short, fuck this place. Never going back."
A G.,"Norwalk, CT",0,3,1,1.0,6/30/2017,"Service is horrible, our waitress just  ignore us the entire time ask several time fir water just keep ignoring us"
Rayvin D.,"Long Beach, CA",0,2,,1.0,10/8/2017,Worst BJS if I could give 0stars I would! Our waitress had an attitude when she came to our table first off. She was dark skinned with a short haircut. She gave me an attitude when I asked her where the bathroom was! Then after she ordered our food it took forever to come. I have never waited that long for my food at bjs. Then when our food came she set it down and walked off quick so we couldn't even ask for anything. Then she furniture to bring the sauces we asked for so we had to wait 10 minutes to flag her down and ask about our 2 barbeque sauces and 1 ranch. We waited another 10 minutes she still never brought them then we asked another lady and she just walked to the front she didn't even bother to go to the back and get it. Then we asked a guy and said our waitress will bring them. Finally after waiting for who knows how long she finally brought our sauce but she brought 2 ranch and 1 bbq and we tried to flag her down so we had to ask a guy and he had to go get our waitress for us and she finally came and brought us our correct sauces quickly. Then my friend but her burger and it was very rare!!! And I had a piece of wood from what looked like a toothpick in my burger but our burgers didn't come with toothpicks! At this point I was beyond upset and was ready to get the check so of course we had to wait for 15 minutes just to get our waitress to come to our table and while waiting we realized the people next to us got up and left because the customer service was so bad. When she finally brought the check she has an extra sandwich on our meal so we had to wait for her to come back to correct it and of course she had an attitude so we had to wait for her to comeback to bring the new receipt then we had to wait again for her to come back so we could pay. And the worst thing is that this was my birthday dinner so I didn't even get a pazookie because I was so upset and did not have the patience to sit and wait there another 30 minutes to an hour. I did not give her a tip and will never go back to that bjs.
C. F.,"Hawthorne, CA",0,1,,4.0,5/21/2017,"I've visited this particular BJ a number of times. All of the waiters/waitress have been good. But the last time I came Julius provided such great memorable service. He was very attentive and jovial, not to just me and my guest but everyone he was heloi"
Sarah R.,"Los Angeles, CA",427,657,656,4.0,3/25/2015,"I love BJ's.. the food is delicious. Everything I've ordered so far has been good. I love their steaks, French dip and club sandwiches, so good! You kind of have to get a pizookie when you come.. it's a big cookie with ice cream on top. I love it and I'm not even usually into sweets. They also have some delicious strawberry topped beignets that are to die for. This location gets very busy and it can sometimes take forever for you to get your food, but the food is worth it. It's not the most inexpensive option at the mall, but it's a good place to go and unwind after a shopping trip or even on its own."
Susan N.,"Los Angeles, CA",75,107,25,3.0,8/27/2016,"I came in to celebrate my birthday with my bestie.  We were there around 2:30 p.m. and Tiffany was our waitress.  However,  the hostess needs her attitude rechecked as she got extremely unhinged when we asked to sit at another location.  Her rudeness towards us was duly noted.  We sat a good 10 or so minutes with no acknowledgement from anyc wait staff.  My friend even waved her hands to get ANYBODY'S attention.  Her not letting our waitress know was not cool."
Bridgett L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/15/2017,"If I could give this location 0 stars I would. This place is horrible. Forget that the food always comes out cold or COMPLETELY wrong, the staff is rude, unprofessional, and a huge disappointment. Do not come here."
Sandi T.,"Inglewood, CA",148,36,6,1.0,9/12/2016,Disgusting!! I ordered potato skins to go and when I got home to eat them the potato skins were not fully cooked...I threw them away and called the manager...she wanted me to bring them back that night which I wasn't doing since I lived miles away. I told her that I won't be in the area till the following Thursday and she said bring them then ummmmm no I'm not keeping that trash till then I just hung up. This past weekend I gave them another try I ordered a vegetarian pizza and it was so nasty the dough didn't taste fully cooked...I won't go into the details but I WILL NEVER GO TO ANOTHER BJ'
Sarina F.,"Los Angeles, CA",94,101,48,4.0,2/3/2017,"My family and I chose to dine here last night. I have always had an up or down experience at BJ's. Tonight was great. I think our server's name was Jake. He was very attentive to us during our entire meal. He even came back after dropping the check to see if we needed anything else, and this is a rarity. We felt like we could take our time and enjoy everything. For appetizers we ordered the wings with lemon pepper dry rub and the brussel sprouts. I was worried the sprouts might be to spicy, however they were perfectly seasoned with just the right amount of sauce. The wings were a little salty for me. I would skip them next time and order a different starter. My kids had the skinny fries to start. They arrived hot and crisp. The kids loved them. For dinner my boyfriend and I shared the Jumbo Spaghetti and Meatballs and the Great White Pizza. The Spaghetti and Meatballs was my favorite part. The portion was large and the meatballs tasted very fresh. We requested more of the garlic knots to accompany the pasta. The pizza had garlic on it, which gave an amazing flavor to it along with the white sauce on the pizza. Can't go wrong with deep dish."
Raina S.,"Inglewood, CA",0,1,,4.0,6/8/2017,I came in to this location yesterday around noon and it was packed to capacity! My guess is because of graduation plus the normal lunch rush. I have to say though the hostess at the front... I believe her name was Ashley! She was really friendly and moving nonstop but she made sure to get me and my family seated in a timely manner and she did it with a smile despite I'm sure she was stressed. She was the only one I noticed at the front so I'm sure she was by herself. She makes me want to come back! My server was also very attentive. Definitely coming back!
Ashley K.,"Washington, DC",95,243,13,4.0,8/19/2016,"Came here for lunch on a Thursday and was able to get seated right away.  The server was very attentive and fast.  The menu is a little intense because there are so many options - but once you wade through the first 5 pages of just drink options and find the food - there's something for everyone.  I got the Brewhouse Burger with shoestring fries.  The burger was really flavorful and cooked just the way I ordered.  The fries were also very crispy and delicious.  While I didn't order beer, as the name of the restaurant implies - there are a lot of beer options.  This was a great place to stop in for lunch and I would recommend it if you are looking for a sit-down restaurant where you need to get a fast meal."
Tom H.,"Torrance, CA",51,399,8,4.0,3/14/2016,"First time at this location but we've been to quite a few other BJ's locations in the southland.  Came here on a Saturday night with a party of 14, and we're seated under an hour which isn't too bad when you think about it.  I do want to give a shout out to our server, for a large party he did an excellent job.  We even requested to split the check four separate ways and he pulled it off without a hitch.  In terms of the food, everything came fine and I don't think we've ever had a problem with food quality at any BJ's."
Vanessa V.,"Montclair, CA",7,3,1,5.0,5/13/2017,"My mother and I came here today and Julius was our waiter. From the very beginning he was kind and made us feel very welcomed, super quick and attentive. Definitely giving all 5 stars to him! The food and pizookies were also great as well."
