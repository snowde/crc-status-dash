Amber C.,"Los Angeles, CA",26,7,4,5.0,2/22/2016,"Out of my dessert but the manager asked if there's anything they could do to compensate.  Clean,  great music, hot bartender.  Pretty good food.  I ordered the quinoa salmon bowl.  It was really good but was heavy on the asparagus pieces,  with only 2 tips. Strong beer. 95 of 100. Would eat here again."
Serena D.,"Culver City, CA",185,3,,5.0,10/1/2016,"I eat here almost every day because I work in the mall and love being able to order my food and walk right in to get it. My experience here with both the managers and the staff at the take out area is typically amazing. They give excellent service. The one thing they can work on as an overall location is their communication with customers. Sometimes the person working the take out area has to step away to get an order or something else, which I understand. On numerous occasions I've walked up to an empty desk and not been contacted until that worker gets back. It does not hurt the 2-4 people standing around the host desk or passing by to say ""hey just give them a second they'll be right with you"". Stop ignoring your customers, contact them. Doesn't seem like the take out area has support from other areas in the store which seems unfair."
Brandee T.,"Inglewood, CA",0,5,2,5.0,1/13/2016,"Such a great experience today! The staff was friendly and prompt. I tried the new root beer glazed wings and omg they were amazing! They had a sweet root beer smell and taste! I would definitely recommend a visit to BJ's in culver city for a quick lunch break or happy hour go-to! Great menu choices, great staff, great music and great location! Thanks Eugene and your awesome staff!!"
lori l.,"Tarzana, CA",0,11,,1.0,7/12/2016,"BJ's Restaurant in Fox Hills Mall is disgusting! Plates were dirty, waiters serve food with their fingers in the dish, we found plastic film immersed in our glass of water...Avocado was brown and service is horrible.  Hostess is rude and lazy!  The true definition of irony is....all this was happening while the health inspector was in the kitchen with the manager! BEWARE....DANGER....STAY AWAY!"
Cynthia M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,1.0,4/16/2017,"If i could give this place zero stars i would. I was there for 40 minutes at a table without a waiter/server to acknowledge us. My husband, daughter and I were very patient since we did realize they were very busy! The staff would not make eye contact with our table and people that arrived after us were being served their food. We did not receive a glass of water though we were there for 40 min. This has been the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant. Though my husband did notify the hostess twice that we hadn't been assisted yet we still felt completely ignored. We walked out. Do go to this location if you love terrible service."
Jolienne A.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,4.0,4/11/2017,I had a great experience overall. My server named Edgar was very polite and attentive. The chicken alfredo was good for the most part but a little dry. Definitely coming back
Sandy L.,"Los Angeles, CA",149,158,337,4.0,9/21/2014,"BJ's is a good chain sports restaurant.  I recommend skipping the line so sit  in the bar and enjoy one of many sports games that are on.  Hint for the single ladies: There are a lot of guys in the bar area so if you are looking to meet someone, there is a great male to female ratio. May the odds be evah in your favor. Food is good - There is also a ton of beers on tap options. If you go with a vegan or vegetarian you can make any burger on the menu a veggie burger.  Service is good as well."
K P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,1,3.0,3/4/2016,"Had the EnLightened omelet... Very tasty! Its loaded with tender delicious veggies and came with fresh fruit. Only con was the temperature on some items. I ordered potatoes and sent them back cuz the were not hot enough...same with the coffee.  Otherwise, it was a nice meal."
Gigi H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,1.0,9/3/2016,"I really like the food here, but the service SUCKS!!! There is no reason why I should be seated, then 10-12 min later have to go back to the hostess to ask who my waiter is. This has happened on more than one occasion, and I keep telling myself don't go back, but I do. This is the LAST time I will EVER come back!!!"
Paul S.,"Long Beach, CA",28,606,20,3.0,10/25/2015,"This is your typical chain restaurant.  They do splurge on ambiance.  It is quite nice.  We actually came to a pizzeria and ordered salads as our main course.  I have not been very fond of BJ's pizzas, so this is what it's come to for me.  We also tried their home brews which were just OK.  I'm not a big fan, but I don't mind coming here from time to time. ========= Commenting on the owner response, unless you're inviting patrons over for a sampling of these new/old menu items, I would prefer not to fork over large sums of money on a whim.  As I mentioned above, there are some very good dishes at BJ's, but I have not been very fond of the pizzas.  I know that's your bread and butter, but perhaps I just don't like the ""style"" of pizza that BJ's makes.  That's just a simple ""agree to disagree"" happy medium."
Nick C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,12,,1.0,12/10/2015,"I went to this location back on 11/3/2015 for my son's birthday. I was looking forward to celebrating his birthday but our waiter Eric, I believe that was his name, made that impossible. We proceeded to receive the worst service from a waiter I think ever, well it could be worse like pissing in your food or violence right? But no really, like he took 30 minutes to take our drink order, and probably waited another 20 minutes for our drinks, then we ordered our food, which by the way TOOK FOREVER to be delivered and when it got to us it was COLD COLD COLD. Gross! Sadly our waiter Eric, never came to ask us if we were good or if the food was good or if we needed drink refills or anything like that. He forgot our dinner items as well. When it came time to celebrate, hah, the waiter ran by and dropped of a pazooky without even a smile, word, or anything. Now don't get me wrong, the Gluten free pazooky was A M A Z I N G, BUT THE SERVICE WAS T E R R I B L E. I was very distraught when I got home because I thought you know, this was my 14 year old birthday dinner AND IT STUNK. I spoke to Manager on duty that evening at around 10pm and guess what, he couldn't find our table or ticket in the system and although he was very consoling on the service, the gift certificates he himself offered so that we might TRY and come back NEVER CAME. SURPRISE SUPRISE."
Jatinder K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,2.0,9/27/2016,Food is great but the service is horrible. We are given wet plates with old food particles still on there. And when we ask the waiter for different plates they give us attitude. Second if you order appetizers and entrees they bring out everything all at once. The meaning of appetizers is to snack a little before our main course comes. If the main course comes same time as he appetizers then the appetizers are pointless.
Travis I.,"Culver City, CA",1102,473,2443,3.0,1/2/2013,"""Her name is Uneeda... As in: U NEED A waitress like her."" The reason for this visit: To see if they rival their neighbors across the mall, Olive Garden, when it comes to AYCE Soup and Salad; sadly, sans breadsticks... Something BJ's might consider changing to REALLY compete.  Upon our arrival, the hostess greeted and seated us, quickly. The interior was typical of what you'd expect of a modern, trendy, bistro-like eatery such as BJ's. The bar area was quite impressive, and the selection of beers from the tap didn't disappoint (after all, they ARE a brewhouse).  Our waitress, Uneeda, greeted us with a warm hello and a friendly smile. I'm telling you, she looks a bit like a mighty fine, younger Michelle Obama. At any rate, her demeanor was exactly what I'd want if I ran a restaurant like BJ's. She immediately noticed my camera and paper pad and took extra time to indulge the foodie in me. Every single plate or bowl she brought out to us was brought with a smile and an explanation of what was in the dish. Either someone in the kitchen was making our plates super pretty or BJ's has their plating on LOCK DOWN... I was impressed at the little extra plating techniques that helped elevate the dish from a boring salad to a pretty plate. SOUP. - Tortilla: Not too bad. I bit thick for my liking, but not too bad. A tableside pour made it seem extra cool... a nice touch, indeed. More tortilla strips would be good; even if they are cooked in the broth. I felt the flavor of tortilla was a bit muddled by all the strong chili and cumin flavor. ((It DID have roasted corn, which I quite fancy))  - Minestrone: Good. Lotsa veggies, hearty broth, but the rotini noodles were lost on me. I'm a die-hard macaroni fan (rigatoni, penne, etc), when it comes to minestrone. Nonetheless, it was the only soup of which I had two cups.  - Broccoli Cheddar: HEAVY. Very thick and cheesy. If they thin it out just slightly and put about twice as much broccoli in it, I'll dive in and take a swim. A good attempt, but needs refining, in my opinion. (Just an opinion) - Clam Chowder: This was good, but needed to be served hotter. Texture was good, taste was good, but temperature was lacking. And in a seafood soup, you really want that soup hotter than hell. - Chili con Carne: Creamy Chili?!... No thanks. This was the only true fail. The chili was über thick, and had a disproportionate dollop of sour cream on it, which turned the chili into a ""dip-like cream of chili."" This did NOT bode well for me. SALAD. - Cesar Salad. The salad was good, but the dressing lacked punch... Maybe it was underdressed. Not the best place to start. Should've started with a simple garden salad. - Wedge. If you don't like wedge salads, you can kiss my grits, nootch. Typical preparation with bacon, bleu cheese crumbles, tomato, and red onion... Quite delicious. If I were obese, I'd eat a gang of these. - Watermelon & Feta. I can't tell you how cool it is that BJ's offers this salad. Served on a rectangular plate, this fresh and cool salad refreshes you, even on the warmest summer day. A perfect pairing and a definite thumbs up, in my book. (Bring along some candied walnuts or pecans for extra ""pow"" factor) - Caprese. Mozzarella, Tomato, Basil and Balsamic with some shredded Parmesan. Cool plating, good taste. Not the greatest caprese I've ever had, but just the simple squeeze bottle action on the dressing makes a HUGE difference in terms of presentation. Good enough for AYCE, by all means.  PIZOOKIE, ON THE HOUSE. - Uneeda told us that we weren't leaving without trying their signature dessert: the pizookie. It's a piping-hot, pan-cooked chocolate chip cookie with a huge scoop of vanilla bean ice cream on top. I'm not a fan of sweets, but this was absolutely delightful. Hot and cold temperatures having a party in my mouth?... Hell yeah. OVERALL... The food is good. If it weren't for Uneeda's exemplary service, I'd probably have given it two-stars, because chili is REALLY hard to screw up, in my opinion. Furthermore, a less-than-stellar Cesar salad coming from a kitchen that manages to present a delicious Watermelon & Feta salad is gonna get dinged. Lastly, BJ's should consider adding bread of some kind to further sweeten this Soup & Salad lunch special. It would certainly serve a couple purposes: It would fill up customers more rapidly and cost-effectively and it would also increase the competition between them and Olive Garden.  None of the soups or salads I had truly ""wowed"" me (MAYBE with the exception of the Watermelon & Feta salad, which is just shocking to see as an AYCE menu option), but there were a couple that fell short of the mark. Nonetheless, this experience was really made enjoyable by Uneeda. Her shining smile and constant efforts to increase our dining pleasure were the reasons we left with the desire to return. So, Uneeda, I take my hat off AND salute you, for you are the true embodiment of awesome service."
Alexandria L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,2.0,6/21/2017,My original waiter Jamie was great he came approached the table told us about specials and took or order brought my sons food out first which was perfect. He then stated that he would be going on his lunch break informed the other waitress that would be taking over for him but she was busy with other table so we finished our food 10 mins later and she still hadn't come to greet us 30 mins go by and still nothing she was in the kitchen or walking around not addressing us or introducing herself or asking if we needed anything by this time I'm ready to go so I find a manager and inform him of what has happened then she came running to me to get me to stop telling her manager that we were being ignored she came blamed our previous waiter for her to coming to our table and then disappeared I'm now waiting to put my bill another 20 mins go by so I ask for the manager informed him that I have work early in the morning and I'm ready to go he went to go adjust my check in my opinion should have been free since she made us wait for so long or previous waiter is now coming back from his break and asked how everything was and he apologized. Management said he would speak with her I hope he really does speak with her I will not be returning to this location EVER!!!!!!
Jordana L.,"Santa Monica, CA",25,78,26,3.0,8/16/2015,"I don't come here expecting stellar food, but in the past it has been consistent and pretty good. Today, my dish had so much water in it that my pasta almost seemed like soup. It also seemed to have taken most of the flavor with it. When I told the server (who came by when I was half done already), she said that was funny because moat people complain that dish is too dry. Interesting."
Chris F.,"Cerritos, CA",0,4,,1.0,3/20/2017,"Yelp really needs a negative star rating! What a joke of a restaurant. The only thing more aggravating than the rude hostesses and inattentive waitstaff is that glorified saltine they call a pizza. I wouldn't even throw hot-sauce on the damn thing for fear my taste buds would associate that taste with hot sauce in the future. Who knew complaining to the tatted-up restaurant manager about the do-nothing hostess would result in lip service to the tune of, ""We apologize and I will have a discussion with her"" and pizza that tasted like that? Then again maybe that's why it tasted like that! I hope I never find myself west of the 110 and spending money at places like this ever again."
Sarita N.,"Sacramento, CA",94,154,15,5.0,7/8/2016,Great staff and amazing food. The parking was terrible but well worth it once seated. I enjoyed our meal and the atmosphere.
Andrew C.,"Los Angeles, CA",118,156,,3.0,9/22/2015,"I'm a little surprised the overall rating here is so low. I was here the other night killing time before meeting a few friends in town, and I had a perfectly-fine experience. I ordered their top sirloin, and for $15, that and two sides is a pretty good deal (as opposed to the prices for their pizza, which are way too high). The steak wasn't big, but it had a ton of flavor and was cooked well. My sides of choice were fries and a baked potato. Both were a bit on the bland side, but nothing a little salt and pepper couldn't make better. The atmosphere was good. I was seated at a table just off the bar area and took in the football game while eating. One negative note, and this echoes the sentiments of a few other recent reviews: Service wasn't great. It wasn't horrible, but there were one or two times where I had to flag down a waitress and it took a few minutes. Also, someone a few tables down didn't get silverware until after his meal came out. Still, my experience seems better than what some reviewers have had. I wouldn't have a problem coming back at some point."
robin s.,"Culver City, CA",18,80,39,5.0,7/16/2016,"As overworked as our server was and the kitchen was backed up, Makita shined like a star"
Kristina G.,"Riverside, CA",192,90,1083,3.0,6/26/2014,"I've been here a few times now and each time, the hostess's are SO RUDE! Last time I was there, they wouldn't give me a buzzer to let me know when my table was ready. The servers are friendly but the seating needs to be more organized.  The food is delicious but is never hot and is barely even warm..it's honestly quite cold . This last time I was there, the root beer was flat but they quickly replaced it with another drink because the root beer  wasn't working properly? Hmm. Also, when I take home leftovers, they don't give me a bag to place my box in but I see others with a bag.  Order the pizookie! (Even that seems to never be warm hah) I also recommend the grilled chicken pasta with blackened chicken"
