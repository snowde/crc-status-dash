Brisa C.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,17,48,1.0,7/13/2016,"Came for Dinner with my husband, We ordered the clam chowder, Alfredo, and the new beginning appetizers. We put in our order and the first thing that came out was the soup not the appetizer which wasn't such of a big deal. Except.. THERE WAS A STRIP OF PLASTIC INSIDE MY SOUP! Then the main course came which I dont know about you guys but I'm pretty sure the appetizers come out first. So as we waited for the appetizer to come our food was getting cold. We got the appetizer late then we ate that and the server who by the way was the worst person ever to be working at any chain of restaurant. I'm not sure what his name was but he was tall skinny African American when we told him about the plastic he responded with ""oh there's plastic in there huh would you like. New one? Or just cancel it"" with a smirk as if that happened commonly NO I do not want a new one is it grenade or is it all made with plastic pieces inside? So anyways he took our main course to the warmer and then at that point my husband was upset and told the server we will take it to go he brought the bag without a check and it's common sense to bring the check he went about his way to go do something else and by that time We no longer wanted to be served by him or even be there. I was super upset that we would be paying for  a meal we didn't even eat and we were there for just 20 minutes we didn't enjoy our food I didn't think it was worth paying 50+ for an experience of that sort. But the money was not the point the point was that that customer service and the dangers of plastic in a soup is ridiculous what if a child was eating that. So I called the manager over and he was kind abit of a smart ass but he took care of the whole meal for us and that was awesome but I'm not one to complain because I work retail but when it's something that I would never want someone else to experience I will say something. All in all never coming back here again I have eaten here countless times but after this visit I'm sure I will be taking my buisness somewhere else."
Mr. X.,"Los Angeles, CA",40,23,8,1.0,7/30/2014,"EXTREMELY poor service. Was not greeted upon entering. Alejandro, our waiter, was the only server in the area.  Ordered:  Avocado egg rolls (BURNT) Chicken Sandwich (fries were cold, had them sent back) Balsamic Chicken had very bitter spinach."
Daisy M.,"Los Angeles, CA",83,55,138,4.0,8/7/2015,Too many people kind of ghetto. The food is like whatever but the beer is real good all kinds of beer. The desserts r delicious as well. Can't complaint that bad it's inside mall what do u expect. Over all good place to have dinner w ur love ones..
Steven R.,"Arrowhead, CA",0,2,,5.0,7/30/2016,"Came here on a whim and had the best experience ever! And that was all due to the great service provided by Tara. This was the first time we've been to a large chain restaurant and felt like we were in a comfortable local neighborhood restaurant. Great food and great job Tara! ""Stefan"" and ""Man-Erin"""
Lana S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,1,1.0,11/22/2016,"Visited this BJ's last Wednesday, which made me remember why I don't patronize this particular BJ's.  My family and I were satisfied until we paid for our meals.  We asked for two separate checks, which we received with no problem.  The issue was my bill was $66.19 and I paid $70 cash; my daughter's bill was $44 and some change, she paid $45 cash.  We waited close to 15 minutes at least for our change.  We had to ask another server to ask our server to bring our change and receipts.  Our server sent someone else to bring my change ($3.81).  My daughter never received her change.  I think our server assumed we wanted her to keep it as a tip.  However, I had her tip at the table ($10).  I was waiting to receive my change to add the $3 with the $10 to leave a tip of $13.  We asked to speak to the Manager because we had been waiting so long for our change and receipts.  The Assistant General Manager, Felix came to our table.  This is when things went South.  Our server finally came to give my daughter her change and slammed it down on the table with an attitude (in front of her Manager).  I tried to talk to her to let her know I had her tip at the table and I would never leave only a $3 tip.  She turned her back and walked away before I could finish my statement.  Felix the Manager did not acknowledge her rude, disrespectful and abrupt behavior.  When we called it to his attention, he became belligerent with a nasty sarcastic tone .  I will never return or patronize this BJ's again.  I asked Felix time and time again for his Manager's name.  He only insulted my intelligence and wasted my time by never giving me the information.  FELIX SHOULD BE FIRED!  This incident made me remember Felix and the reason why I don't visit this location.  I don't think retraining would help him at this point.  Felix exhibits a god-complex, which is very offensive. He lacks customer service skills, conflict resolution and most of respect and professionalism.  I WILL NEVER VISIT THIS LOCATION AGAIN."
Lucas R.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,35,11,2.0,6/9/2015,"Haven't even got the food yet when I'm writing this, but I already have some complaints.   First off, they didn't have the ales on tap they claimed to, twice. I finally got a bottled Comradeship and they guy brought it without a glass and with the bottle cap on.   After we ordered we waited 70 minutes for two pizzas and a small pasta dish.  We played games on my phone and I've spent $720 on Amazon.   I blame BJ's.  Slightly sarcastic, but yeah. This was crazy.  Every 3rd table was empty too."
Lilly S.,"Brentwood, Los Angeles, CA",57,173,23,1.0,5/28/2015,"Generally I love BJs Brewhouse- the one in Westwood and century city are great. But we were at the mall and decided to try this location. By far the worst location I have been to. Absolutely worst service ever!! Our server never came to check on us. We got unlimited soup and salad and she never came for us to get the UNLIMITED SOUP AND SALAD. She was standing around and talking to her coworkers and gossiping, very loudly.  Worst service ever. No wonder this location got 2.5 stars!!!"
Josie M.,"Los Angeles, CA",143,162,384,4.0,3/10/2016,"There have been plenty of visits I've made here with friends and close ones. Not all my visits have been excellent and because of that I give them 4 stars. This review is my overall experience adding up last nights, and my past visits to this BJ's. My boyfriend and I usually come in around night time due to our busy work schedules, and the restaurant is always busy. The wait isn't very long at all, 0-10 minutes the most to get a seat (except weekends it's a bit more busy than week days. The service is 4 out 5 times EXCELLENT! Waiters ask us if we need refills, and get us our orders correct 100% of the time! I usually start of with a chicken tortilla soup which they bring out fresh and serve in front of you. Then we get our deepdish pizza with no tomato chunks on top (normally they put tomato pieces on top of the deep dish), and a side order of thin cut fries and/or mozzarella sticks. Afterwards our waiter comes back and we order a pizookie. Now, the pizookies come in two different size options: 1= a ""regular sized pizookie"" which is about 6"" I believe, or 2= a ""Pizooke Trio"", in which you get to choose 3 tiny different-flavored pizookies of your choice. Full tummies call for a regular sized pizookie (for 2 people to share) and you can ask for half and half flavors! My favorite is their Oreo flavor and my bf likes their White Chocolate Macadamia Nut, which means it's a win/win for us! Prices are reasonable, and there is a parking area located right outside, or you can park in the mall and walk all the way to it!"
Jay R.,"Culver City, CA",162,52,1,1.0,6/23/2015,"Given all the recent negative reviews... you have to wonder about all the 5 star reviews from people with less than 5 total reviews.  Maybe it's the local labor pool, training, or simply poor management but this location does not operate like a normal BJ's.  As a former employee I am appalled at the level of service and their ability to execute the basic fundamentals of a restaurant.  I provided my feedback using their web portal only to be sparingly acknowledged by the GM Eugene Ochoa.  As someone else pointed out, he's not really committed to service and/or turning this restaurant around.  Sad, because I really like the brand and the food.  Just not this location."
ed g.,"Lawndale, CA",3,17,,1.0,2/14/2017,"We had a big order for the office placed today at lunchtime. 8 entrees. We go pick it up and bring it back to our office. We asked for monkey bread with salted ice cream ,Nope didnt get it. we had 5 dishes with french fries, Ketchup  Nope didnt get it. The chicken salad for 13 dollars does'nt even compare to the picture they have posted on the menu. Half the size for 13 bucks don't bother. the pulled pork sandwich would have been good if we got the extra barbeque sauce like we asked for. Nope  So people don't bother with BJs. Plenty of other restaurants around to go to at lunch!!!"
Rolland I.,"Los Angeles, CA",72,22,56,3.0,5/7/2015,"The Service is  sorta decent and the food is decent. The Servers need a few classes in "" working smarter, not harder"", and ""how not to look, sound, and act ratchet while Providing Customer Service""! The Servers that waited on my party were not ""bad"", but getting a refill of ANYTHING became a Chore!"
Clara W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,9,2,1.0,2/12/2017,Just left and WORSEEEEEE service ever! I had to go ask for service after 15 minutes of waiting for water. Then took them another 20 to take my order. Short staffed and waiters looked stressed
Michaela C.,"Van Nuys, CA",0,66,31,3.0,7/12/2016,"The food was mediocre for BJ's, but seriously, the main problem is the wait. The host or hostess will make people wait even when there is plenty of seating. And the waiters are slow, too. And even the take out is slow. For a big restaurant to service that many people in a busy location, they really need to step up their game."
Santa M.,"Santa Monica, CA",4,115,7,3.0,6/16/2016,Yucky service. Ended up with a tummy ache. Waiter blamed runners for our food being delivered cold. Bad.
Katrina A.,"Inglewood, CA",0,5,2,1.0,8/9/2016,"Horrible curbside service- ordered @ 12:50p still waiting on my food. Called & server had an attitude said it would be another 5 minutes.... Still waiting with no word from anyone. First time ordering curbside from this location, never again. Never received food, decided to leave after long wait & no customer service provided."
Alexa J.,"Henderson, NV",768,68,23,1.0,2/21/2016,"Terrible experience! I looked at Yelp before coming here, and discovered the ""Buy one get one free"" entree, so when we sat down- I asked our server if we could use it. About 10 minutes later, our server came by and said the 2 for $20 offer was not valid until next month.... Which wasn't what I asked him about, so after explaining to him again about the BOGO offer, it took him another 10 min or so until he came back and said the offer was still good. We ordered our food, and waiting for around 30 minutes before asking our server how much longer it was going to be. He said they were just waiting for the pizza to be done... So my husband requested that the food that was ready, could just be brought out to the table (we were all very hungry) Anther server came by shorty after and dropped off 3 of the 4 entrees ordered (including the pizza) and the entree I ordered: fries were cold, which was fine... I was hungry so I dove right in.... My husbands entree: pizza (requested no tomatoes) came out covered in tomatoes. He told the server, and the server took it back to the kitchen. About 5 min later, the pizza comes back to the table, with some tomatoes still on it. Clearly the cooks tried to pick off all the tomatoes, and just send it back to us, which is so disgusting- I can only imagine their fingers digging through the pizza, gross! So back to my entree... I was halfway through my sandwich and happened to look down to a giant black curly hair coming out of the middle. Appetite completely lost and at this point, so I went and asked the hostess if I could speak to the manager. She came back and informed me that the manager was busy on a phone call. We waited another 10 minutes until my husband got up to find the manger. At this point- we just wanted to get out of this hell hole! Finally we spoke to the manager, and let him know about our entire experience. He said he would take care of the bill, and was very sorry.  I would never in a million years visit this location again, and it's definitely put a bad taste in my mouth for BJ's in general"
Emilio M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1350,467,1264,3.0,8/6/2012,"The last time I set foot in to a BJ's Brewhouse was a few years ago and it was the one in Westwood (by UCLA...you know the one). Ive always thought their pizza's to be merely ""just okay"" and the service better than ""just okay"". So walking in to BJs over the weekend, I was going in knowing what to expect and what to order. I had my heart set on their Blackened Chicken Sandwich. Its my favorite and only thing I ever order. Then something went wrong. Terribly wrong. Its no longer on the menu. GRRRRRRR! ""WELL THERE GOES MY WEEKEND!"" I exclaimed to my family as they watched me degenerate in to a pity party on one. To which my wife remarked ""just order something else."". So with that remark...my better half once again (who is the keeper of all the brains and common sense) guides me out of the darkness. I settled for the BBQ tri tip sandwich that was pretty good and served up pretty big. Its served with coleslaw and your choice of waffle or wedge fries. I recommend it.  The service was spot on! Our server was polite punctual and in spite of how busy they were he never delayed on a thing. Overall BJs still has plenty to offer and the service is great. I will miss the Blackened Chicken Sandwich and thats why I'm docking the review a star.  Damn you Blackened Chicken Sandwich...I wish I knew how to quit you."
Sarah V.,"Alameda, CA",3,9,,1.0,7/16/2016,Followed up with the manager over a month ago via email as he requested and never heard back...
Kristi O.,"Los Alamitos, CA",526,45,10,4.0,6/5/2016,"Tiffany was great! She pointed us in the right direction and prevented us from ordering way too much deep dish pizza lol... We got the 2 for $25 deal with Caesar salads, spicy Hawaiian pizza, and chocolate chip pizzookie. We also got a beer sampler with brew house blonde, dos Equis, piranha IPA, and tatonka stout. Everything was pretty good and reasonably priced. It was still a lot of food, so we left with leftovers. He enjoyed the blonde and the dos Equis because of fresher, lighter flavors. The piranha had a rather bitter aftertaste, but it had a good overall flavor. The tatonka had more of a coffee taste than other stouts, but it went down pretty smooth. Overall would definitely recommend this location."
Chris G.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",789,1189,1413,3.0,4/24/2014,"Came here for lunch with 5 people from work.  The food pacing was a little slow, especially considering the location was not very crowded.   This BJ's is part of the mall, but you can't enter it from inside the mall - kinda strange.  I had the lunch special, which was a soup (clam chowder - B grade) and a salad, the food was better than average.  I hope to come back and try some BJ's beer, which I know to be tasty from other BJ's experiences."
