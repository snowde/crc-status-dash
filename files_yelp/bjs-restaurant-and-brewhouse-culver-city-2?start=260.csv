Kris L.,"Los Angeles, CA",199,4,,1.0,7/31/2016,"Came with a group, by far the worst experience ever. Our waitress took our order. Then it took 2hrs to bring our food. Not only that orders had to go back from being wrong. Our waitress didn't check on us at all. Nobody was able to get a refill. We ended up getting a new waitor that told us she went home for the day. Then like magic she is clearing off tables. Which one is it? Just by far the WORST!"
Christine P.,"San Diego, CA",11,50,9,1.0,8/21/2015,"I've been to various BJ's restaurants throughout Southern California and I have to say, this is the first time that I've had such bad service through this chain. Our dinner started off on the right foot because we were seating sooner than our wait time, but that's pretty much where it ended.  Our server was talking in such a quiet voice that I could barely hear him over the people directly next to us. He took our orders in a timely manner, but never repeated our order back to us. I guess that should've been my clue that something might go wrong, but I honestly never expected to have every single item we ordered be wrong. When I called the mistakes to his attention, instead of being apologetic, he began to raise his voice and be defensive. What? YOU messed up my order because you heard it wrong, that's not my fault. If you were confused, you should have clarified with me. I'll be coming back to BJ's, but never to this location ever again."
Yvette S.,"Inglewood, CA",0,1,,3.0,7/12/2016,"Enjoyed my lunch @ bj's staff friendly ,Food was good. I would've given it a higher score but this unstable Lady  interrupted  my pleasant time.  She had no consideration for the other diners inside the restaurant.I don't like to see workers being  verbally abuse by aggressive customers. I plan to go back in the near future love the food"
Marla M.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,5,,1.0,6/27/2016,TERIBLE!! Worse costumer service ever. Long and unnecessary wait. Waitresses are extremely rude. Never ever going back
Brandon C.,"Menifee, CA",58,33,5,1.0,4/22/2015,"THE ABSOLUTE WORST SERVICE IVE EVER HAD AT A BJ'S.  Went in for dinner  on Monday and sat at the bar because the last time I didn't sit at the bar the service was extremely slow. Got there at 10 till 5:00. Put our order in at 4:56. Asked the bartender multiple times to scan the BJ's bar code so I could pay in the app. He blew me off every time. Guy next to us got his food. Girl at the end of the bar gets hers. We keep waiting. Bartender says he's going to check on our food. Then rather than check he takes 2 other orders and talks to another patron at the bar. He never checked. Then the guy next to us gets his food, which was ordered about 10 minutes after we ordered. Called the bartender over and asked to cancel our order because the service was poor. He didn't even try to make it right. He just cashed us out, charged us for the two drinks, and went about with his business. We left at 5:30."
Daniela M.,"Santa Monica, Los Angeles, CA",6,16,1,1.0,11/9/2015,"Service: our waiter was nice.informed us he was new and trying to learn the menu which I could understand.but never table touched and wasn't ever around to find. I feel like the need to properly train them before they throw them out to the sharks.  Drinks/food: I got a margarita and my boyfriend got a beer (bottled). My drink came out first and the waiter let us know that the bartender was backed up. I was thinking ""how does he make a margarita and send it out first and not a BOTTLED beer?"" Anyways, our food came and I got the mini deep dish pizza (it was slightly warm) and my boyfriend got the California club flatbread, which were a bit bland. I'm not the type to complain, I was just really excited for the pazookie! But I never got a chance to order it since our waiter never came by. I was so SAD. I had to grab a different waiter to help us out to get the check. Atmosphere/service: horrible service!hostess was rude as soon as we walked in."
Shena C.,"Los Angeles, CA",30,53,16,1.0,6/10/2016,"On 3/11/16, my ""curbside"" pizza was incorrect.... The young lady asked if I wanted her to make it over.... Because I was pressed for time, I declined and she advised that she would replace my pizza whenever I came back.....  Forward to today, I call to place my order thinking that they would be able to reference this ""credit"" by my name or phone number..... I get lovely ""Eugene""....... He was the epitome of ""NICETY"" aka sarcastic, rude and patronizing......... He wanted me to go through my call list and provide him with the exact day and time I placed my order and hung up while I was speaking to him not once, but, 3 times!  What did I do? I went through my At&t app and found the exact call and provided the information..... He replaced the order however, I'm afraid to eat it because he was such a JERK!!!!  I'm waiting on their corporate office to call me back!!!!"
Rashad M.,"Palmdale, CA",37,3,,3.0,7/24/2016,"I'm giving them 3 stars because the food is usually always good, however the service is up and down. Sometimes the servers concentrate on one side of their assigned area."
Mario H.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,3,,5.0,5/28/2015,"If you make it to this location, ask for Brian as your server. I met a buddy of mine for drinks to catch up after work, and Brian took care of us. He was on point when it came to beer and cocktail recommendations, even though he was one of those high brow IPA guys. Brian we look forward to catching up with you the next time we come in... Sincerely, The Doctah"
Genesis C.,"Valley Glen, Los Angeles, CA",41,72,30,4.0,3/17/2015,"Oh how I love this restaurant! Came in on Sunday and got sat pretty quickly. My cousin and I ordered the Avocado rolls as an Appetizer and Holy Moly! Those babies are good!!! We ordered Beers I got the Blonde which I loved and she got the Lighthouse. I ordered a Burger which was delicious and my Cousin got the Chicken Pesto Sandwich which she kept raving about!  Overall I enjoyed my time here, the food was good and the drinks were good, the only thing that was bugging me was how rude our waitress was, She was pregnant and idk if she was just in one of those moods but that was why we didn't leave a tip. Customer service is always important, my friends."
Ryan S.,"Pasadena, CA",146,423,7,4.0,8/17/2014,"We arrived at about 1pm on a Sunday, for lunch.  This is your typical BJ's as far as looks inside; however, I always think they have a great pub/causal vibe.  We got a booth for two near to a television so we could watch the NFL PreSeason game.  During the time of our visit, they had a wonderful 2 for $22 deal, which included a medium pizza, 2 salads, and a dessert.   We decided to have the buffalo chicken pizza, 2 caesar salads, and a salted caramel Pazookie.  The pizza was awesome and delicious.  The salads were equally great.  The Pazookie -- well I think that goes without saying -- it was awesome too! The meal was great.  Our server had a good and pleasant attitude; however, I believe was overworked and had one too many tables.  He was non-existent at times; however, tried his very best. I give our visit today a 4 out of 5, and would return again."
Natalie F.,"Los Angeles, CA",46,73,798,1.0,3/26/2014,"After several ok-to-good experiences at this location, last night's terrible experience was my last. Why I go in the first place:  Great deep dish pizza, excellent beer selection, lively atmosphere.   What ruined the experience:  Our server was non-existent.  The food and drink took too long to come out.  When it did, the pizza wasn't hot, the pan was merely warm to the touch.  She brought us a container for the leftover pizza rather than a pizza box, and didn't offer a bag to carry it out in.  Our plates took too long to be cleared.  I also noticed this at the table next to us where they stacked their dishes in the middle while having dessert.  In the end, I had to find the manager to ask for the check because we couldn't find our server (she apparently left without letting us know another server had taken over the station). The manager pitched in to help out - she took our drink order after we'd been seated and not acknowledged, served the meals, and brought the check - but this was after we'd already waited too long. The things I like about BJ's were completely overshadowed by poor service and I'll be foregoing BJ's next time in favor of a better overall experience."
Nachaka W.,"Wilmington, CA",115,72,139,4.0,8/20/2015,"I can't get enough of the honey sriracha Brussels sprouts, omg I really love them. The rest of the food is bomb to lol plus my waiter Ernesto is the bomb I love his personality, friendly and funny plus he's cute.."
Kim P.,"West Los Angeles, CA",533,151,574,1.0,2/17/2014,"Horrible! That pretty much says it ALL! How is this place in business? Health Dept. come check BJ""s in Culver City please. They definitely don't have a chef in the kitchen just a few cooks a deep fryer and a large microwave."
Kas M.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,121,149,4.0,4/26/2015,"We came here around 7pm, there was a 30 minute wait for our party of two. My honey ordered spinach artichoke dip/chips, deep dish lasagna, strawberry margarita. I ordered avocado rolls, buffalo chicken wings & strawberry mojito. The spinach artichoke dip/chips were delicious, the dip & chips were just cooked. The lasagna tasted like pizza. My avocado rolls were tasty & my wings were okay, I've had better buffalo wings at Tom's Urban. Our waitress Crystal was very attentive. Our total was $74."
Danette C.,"Studio City, CA",22,111,23,2.0,5/31/2015,"The service was pretty bad last night. It started with the valet. Horrible. We followed the arrows and pulled up behind a line of cars that were just sitting there empty. We waited a few minutes for someone to come to us. Nothing. Finally we walked all the way up to the valet stand and this guy is just standing there lookong at us as we walked up. I asked if the valet was still open and he seemed visibly annoyed that I asked this. He said yes, they were open and then just handed me a ticket and said $7.00. No smile. No pleasant greeting. No explanation. No apology. Nothing. Ugh Oh! And when I handed him my keys I asked,""Oh do you know which car I'm in?"" I didn't think he knew because we parked so far back. That is how many empty cars that were just waiting there to be parked. This dude immediately responds that yes he knew and tells me the make of my car. So my question is...if he saw us pull up why didn't he come over to help us? Initially I didn't know what to do! Leave my keys in the car? Bring them with me? I mean, what the hell!! Next we had to deal with the 2 young black hostesses. It was a Saturday night at exactly 7:20pm. Whoever these two chicks are, they should be fired. As hostess you're usually the first rep for the restaurant. These two girls were sour faced, dry, unpleasant, unfriendly, dismissive and an overall buzz kill. Why are these two working as greeters when they seem like they can't conjure up the energy to freaking give a half smile!?! The worst. I hate bitch set faced hostesses. The girl that actually seated us was nice. Our waiter was Taylor or Tyler. Very nice. But he was overwhelmed. Therefore we were often ignored and got shitty service. He was dealing with a lot of big parties. He needed help. He got very little help. Therefore my party of 5 sat for long periods without getting orders taken...hungry as hell...nobody ever refilled our waters, our appetizer came out and we had no plates or utensils for a long while.  I'm not mad at Taylor/ Tyler. I think he did his best. He had no support. Where were the people to refill water at least?? Damn!! Anyway the broccoli cheese soup had a weird consistency last night like it had been sitting out for too long. But the ahi poke was sooo good. Very fresh.  I tool off a star for the crappy valet when we arrived (although the guys were ON IT and friendly when we left at around 10pm) and another star for the two horribly sour hostesses, and the overall slow service. I like this place. It was packed and the energy was great. But the service needs to improve."
P. R.,"Culver City, CA",0,9,,1.0,7/3/2016,Horrible service. Food took over an hour to get here. At an hour I told them I wasn't even hungry anymore.  Food is good - IF YOU EVER GET SERVED! This is the 3rd time this has happened at the Culver City location. Never coming back.
Martha E.,"Hawthorne, CA",21,48,65,1.0,8/1/2015,"I went to BJs after having a long day. We were told the wait was about 20mins and it turned out to be about 10 mins, which was great.  I ordered a spinach and artichoke dip, it turned out good. My friend ordered cheddar broccoli bowl, there was barely any soup in there. It was mostly the sourdough bowl.  The worst part was that, we also ordered the BJs Classic combo pizza which is a deep dish. We got our pizza and I immediately noticed that it nearly looked like a thin crust and the worst part was that the dough was undercooked. We let our server know and they took our pizza back and placed it back in the oven--now we had to wait even longer to actually eat. They brought the pizza back out and now it was burnt, they saw nothing wrong with it. And to make matters worse, it was still doughy. The manager swung by and said the pizza would be ""on him"". I didn't enjoy it, I just picked the toppings and that's all I ate. This was the worst pizza I have ever been served/had. We got there around l9:10PM and ended up leaving around 11PM. We were all extremely disappointed."
Sebastian A.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,13,2,4.0,7/1/2016,This is definitely my favorite place to go have lunch during the week! I like the quick service and that I can enjoy a cold brew in under an hour!
Eric M.,"Santa Monica, CA",377,426,116,3.0,3/1/2016,"The customer service is great, but the food is pretty overpriced unless they have the $20 special."
