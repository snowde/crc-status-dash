Breann G.,"Atlanta, GA",141,3,,1.0,3/20/2016,"If you like frozen TV dinners from the grocery store, then you will love this place. Only thing that taste fresh and that is actually good, is the Easy Bake Oven cookie."
Khedra G.,"Hawthorne, CA",1,13,1,5.0,10/3/2015,"Our server Mekeea was WONDERFUL! I usually take a very long time when deciding on what I want to eat...especially when faced with a larger menu selection. Mekeea was patient, funny, and truly genuine.  Other than that, the food is good...totally filling. And, as mentioned in most of the reviews, the PIZOOKIE is delish! I had a 2 in one salted caramel and white chocolate macadamia."
Rosalyn C.,"Long Beach, CA",78,15,7,5.0,6/23/2016,"Our Waiter, Jessie L. Was very kind, quick with our service and respectful.  After a hard day at work, I honestly can say I feel better with his kind and calm demeanor.  Our food was great and he brought water with lemon refills promptly.  :)"
Em B.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,29,,3.0,3/1/2015,"The food and drinks always great, when I have been to this location. Three stars are for VA, who is a friendly, energetic, and all around efficient server!  I've been bothered in the past by the (ridiculously) long wait time, but the last time I went it wasn't so crowded, so the wait was only about 20 min. (That was with a call ahead for wait list!) There is a really rude hostess there, who thinks she's the queen of the castle, and bosses everyone around from her hostess station by yelling across the room. Annoying, but comical. The bathroom was disgusting. This bothers me because BJ's is a food establishment that has a lot of business, especially this location, so I would think they would want to keep it top notch."
Trini T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,2,1.0,6/20/2017,the worst restaurant ever!! don't waste your time attending this establishment
Quincy S.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,20,22,1.0,8/1/2015,So last night me and a couple of friends were out and we were hungry so we decided we wanted a deep dish pizza so we chose bj's and when we got there our sever was nice he gave us time on taking our order even when we were indecisive so when we finally chose we had ordered the spinach and artichoke dip for an appetizer which I thought was really good and my friend ordered the cheddar broccoli bread bowl she let me try and it wasn't half bad but it was more bread than soup little to none actually and me and my other friend decided to get a deep dish together and that was hands down the worst deep dish pizza I've experienced the when it first was brought out to us the pizza look a little flat to be a deep dish and when we tried to take it out of the pan which was another battle trying to get it out of the pan and when we finally did my friend notice the dough was still raw even the waiter noticed it as well and took it back then the manager came out and asked us about then he said he'll put it back in the oven so the second time it came out it looked really burnt around the edges and he also had a hard time taking out the slices and the slices were way uneven then eventually he said that he'll pay for the pizza he clearly knew that it was messed up so when we started eating it again the center of it was still doughy so I pretty much ate off the top and I had to order something else cause I was still hungry I had got the carnita fries now those were really good  I'll have to rate the service ie the waiter a four out of five and the pizza the thing we came for a zero  very disappointed
Michelle S.,"Glassell Park, Los Angeles, CA",0,4,2,1.0,1/4/2015,"We didn't get our utensils until we asked for them. We ordered our food, 10 mins later our waitress came by to double check our order, since she forgot. When We got our food, it was cold and undercooked. We asked for it to be changed, yet again the second order was unpleasing.    The service was horrible. There were several employees standing around. We began stacking our finished cups and plates, because our waitress took a long time to check on us. After we confronted her about her service she had an attitude. I've never had a problem with another BJ's until today."
Hash T.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,54,16,5.0,2/7/2014,"When I'm in this area, I'm never let down with the food and drinks. The Lemon Drop Martini at happy hour will make any conversation go from, ""ugh I hate life"" to ""what were we talking about,"" they're the perfect medium. I usually get the delicious Chicken Parmesan. The chicken(real chicken)is perfectly tenderized, the bread crumbs do not taste like they came together packaged in a shipping truck.  The creamy sauce and sundried tomatoes are always sweeet, and the broccoli is always freshly steamed, and the mashed potatoes :P fluffy with just the right amount of butter. I cook from scratch, I know food. These chefs are great!!  Not to compare but, I will, once I was tempted to try Olive Gardens chicken---- bad idea, terrible, hard, gummy, tasted like I bit into a clone, it was a pitiful decision. I went back to bjs like 3 weeks afterwards and it was superb.  So I don't know why people are being so harsh, for the last three years I've gone with many different friends we've always had great service and great food. This is not Houston's where people have fake smiles. These are real people, maybe try talking to them like they are? Also, I'd like to point out maybe the people who are giving bad reviews shopped in the mall for 7 hours and are grumpy consuming monsters secretly screaming ""want food now."" As Barthodemulew Simpson would say, ""Cool your jets man."" In all, never ever had a problem here. When I'm in the area, perfect place to eat. Well priced, freshly made, and generous portions!"
Caves N.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,40,,1.0,11/7/2016,"Went yesterday November 6th 2016 around 9pm, Customer Service was the worst the moment I sat down. When we arrived we waited 20 mins after seated I asked for the bathroom and was ignored. Ordered my drink and she gave the 2 other people with me a straw but I didn't receive one asked waitress and had to wait a extra 10 mins for her to bring one, very rude. Second we ordered our food, another 10 mins passed and she came back and said she forgot my husbands order wow. My brother had 2 Pepsi and she didn't put ice in neither cup. Don't know her name but a older Hispanic lady with accent. The bill came out to 95$ for the 3 of us and the food was nasty with horrible service, was better off eating at the food court inside the mall. Please train your Employees, you lost a customer."
Nito E.,"Hawthorne, CA",257,80,38,2.0,7/12/2015,"I don't know what's going on here but this location just isn't what it used to be.  We waited to be greeted... Waited a lot longer once we were seated and when we got our food, it wasn't worth the wait nor the $$. Only good thing we took from the visit was that a manager took the initiative to take our order after a waitress left us alone waiting over 15 minutes. The problem may not be him but perhaps it's the other staff."
Rosalind C.,"Carson, CA",30,3,,1.0,12/27/2015,"Was here today and the food was terrible.  The brew house burger was dry, the bacon was burnt, the pickles and tomatoes were ice cold, and the bun was stale.   I sent that order back and ordered a mini Italian sausage pizza and it was also sub par with no sauce and over the amount needed of cheese that was clumped together.  The crust was also burned... I have been to other locations and will never return here......."
Denise W.,"Saratoga, CA",224,121,516,2.0,11/10/2013,"This location has THE slowest service ever. Also often hard to find parking. My friend and I come here everytime we are feeling severely drained after a long day/week of school (which is pretty often, maybe once a month or two) because its one of the only places open late around us. There's literally two servers for all those tables, can NEVER flag them down, and the food takes anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour and a half. Whenever we come it's never even busy yet they cant seem to function smoothly. I'd hate to see how it is on a busy night. I hated BJs for the longest time because everytime i went to one, i've tried to order something different in hopes of a better experience from the last. I never once got a decent fulfilling meal. The only thing I thought was worth getting was the Avocado Egg Rolls. Then one fateful day I came across the Parmesan Crusted Chicken, and the Chicken Bacon Ranch Pizza(or Great White sometimes) with my friend. It is the perfect combination of a meal. We split the Parmesan Crusted Chicken which comes with mashedpotatoes and broccoli (they split it to two plates for you), and then share a small pizza so three slices each. If were still hungry we also add a pizookie at the end. Most of the time we eat all this and take home one slice to-go. These two dishes have been the most acceptable to me at BJs and it is the only thing I get now when it is absolutely necessary to resort to this restaurant. (The Seared Ahi Salad is also a recent add on to my OK list.) If only the service was up to par at this location, BJ's would be alright. For now it's still eh in my book."
Mia F.,"Los Angeles, CA",111,6,,1.0,1/22/2016,"Since they opened, I've tried it about and handful of times.  With the exception of 1 visit, I've had only bad experiences. The service is terrible, whether busy or not, the service sucks!  One time it was empty and it still took 20 minutes to order, then another 20 to get our food.  After that experience I emailed corporate about it and they didn't even respond.  Last night confirms I will never spend another dollar in that place (even though I wasn't paying last night!).  Same thing, waited at least 15 minutes to place drink orders.  Our waiter was pretty attentive after that because we mentioned the wait, but it all fell apart at the end. We were brought our bill after we were done eating but my boyfriend decided to have another beer, so the waiter took the bill back. Then he was nowhere to be found for what felt like forever! It reached a point where I went to the front and asked the hostess to close us out.  Rather than her sensing my frustration and taking care of us, she proceeded to take my check and $100 bill and disappear to the back to locate the waiter.  When he emerged from the back, he proceeds to drop drinks off at another table and spends time with them taking orders or something. He then walked away from their table without even stopping by to apologize for the delay or anything.  He had to of known we were pissed because the hostess had given him our bill so I would have expected him to check in with us. Then I spotted him at cash out location, at that point I walked over there asked for my change, it was 10:30pm by this time.  I'd say we got there around 8:30pm. One other thing to note, earlier in the experience, my boyfriend went to wash his hands in the men's restroom, and slipped on the wet floor by the sink.  Luckily he didn't actually fall but went to tell the manager it needed attention and how serious it could have been.  The manager didn't seem to care and didn't even offer to comp us something (not that we needed him to or were expecting it but clearly he wasn't even worried about us possibly complaining the higher ups, which that is next on my to-do list). To top it off my boyfriend ordered the sirloin, which was the smallest piece of meat I've ever seen at a restaurant.  All in all, the food wasn't good, then combine that with the worst service ever, I would not recommend! PS, the pizookie is worth a recommendation!  But get it to-go!"
Marney V.,"Long Beach, CA",23,13,4,1.0,3/31/2015,"I am presently here ... And I will never go back here!! Ever!! Far beyond the other branches -highly recommendable! Kindly ask for water and took waiter half an hour. Then after a few ... I just requested to follow-up our order ... Then the waiter rudely say (volume voice raised) ""what do you mean, I already placed order your oder and nothing is there yet!"" Talking about well mannered scenario. Everyone is tired from work including her, but a little friendly reply defibrs character of the person and image of this place."
Viktoria K.,"North Hollywood, CA",0,28,,5.0,11/10/2016,Thank you Felix for being such a professional and nice manager. But the place needs some improvements at kitchen.
Sage D.,"Compton, CA",79,4,,1.0,2/21/2016,"I was here with friends for my birthday dinner and the waiter Jesse was very rude. He didn't acknowledge a new face at the table, he didn't bring our silverware or ketchup when asked. I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken and the chicken was pink then the manager wanted to argue with me about it saying that it wasn't."
Chava D.,"Culver City, CA",0,3,,1.0,11/5/2016,"Sat at table for 20 minutes, never saw a waiter.  Couple next to us was served, waiter didn't acknowledge us. Generally I'm patient but this was a bit extreme."
Fisseha A.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,37,,2.0,11/16/2014,"One of the managers (short woman I think Kim is her name) is nuts. She was scolding me like I was her child and was threatening to have me thrown out by mall security. Not making this up. My crime was 'talking down to her', 'not talking to her as a person' and some self absorbed drivel along those lines. I was just complaining about the games being switched. I wasn't being a jerk about it. I don't/didn't drink. I didn't raise my voice, didn't even leave my seat. My only crime was having the audacity to argue with this woman on a power trip. I just happened to be there when this chick had a meltdown :-) I just came to watch football, eat some wings and talk smack with other fans. This is a sports bar. May be she had a bad day, but I've seen what I consider to be rude bahavior here before and witnessed nothing like this. Needless to say that was the last straw for me. She was probably hoping for the stereotypical angry black man making a scene followed by her ""see what did I tell you"" reassurance, but I'm afraid I didn't live up. I just ignored her. Security left. Her imaginary power disappeared. Amazes me how some people like her survive in the service industry, let alone move up to become managers. Food is Ok. Larry the bartender is a super cool guy and Andrew and Felix are as good as there are. That's why I gave it a 2."
Witney T.,"Gardena, CA",0,10,8,3.0,5/18/2016,Waiter seemed a bit irritated couldn't get his name because he didn't have his badge on . . . food was good! Wish you had white rice for jambalaya
Monisha S.,"Torrance, Los Angeles, CA",1,8,,1.0,4/15/2016,"Had the Mahi Mahi Tacos...they were great. But I'm not at all pleased with the chips on the side. Looks like they gave me the bottom of the bag? Which isn't appealing at all and a pain to eat. There was no way I can use them to dip them into my salsa, or my guacamole...(which the server failed to bring me after asking twice.)"
