Raquel C.,"South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",14,46,79,5.0,2/9/2015,"First of all, the beer is great! I suggest you get it by the pitcher-full. You can walk it off in the mall, and have an even better time walking around for hours in a packed mall.  The joint was overly filled. We went on a Saturday evening, and the front reception and outside waiting area were crowded. Regardless of that, all of the staff were great and attentive.  We had the bison and black/blue burger. They were both great, but the ""coleslaw"" that comes with the bison burger was dry, no slaw for the cole.  Also, if you are getting an appetizer, try the corn fritters, they are pretty good."
Joshua E.,"Oceanside, CA",1,8,1,1.0,4/15/2016,"Negative stars, what a bad bar experience. This place had no porters, stouts, & anything else I wanted to drink. The bar service was rude & very unprofessional. I really just wanted to get out of here ASAP while my buddy finished his mojito. That mojito tasted like a blind man took a shot at bartending & served him that.  I used to come here a while ago after my deployments & I'm sadly disappointed..."
Noe ..,"Lomita, CA",274,119,17,1.0,10/1/2016,where to start well my wife ad I came last Tuesday for dinner and by far one of the worst experiences ever we only saw our server once not once did we get a refill my burger and fries were cold and my wifes pasta was cold as well when I told the server he got bothered and rudely tells me it looks hot to me I asked for a management team member and they never came so he then takes our food back brings it back says all better all he did was throw it in the microwave guy thought I was stupid I was a prep cook at one point
David C.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,10,,1.0,11/14/2016,"Nothing says we have low standards like ""Is Pepsi ok instead"" It makes you wonder about other cheap substitutions."
Alicia B.,"Santa Monica, CA",130,97,46,2.0,1/19/2016,"Food- average corporate stuff that gets the job done with nothing special. Need a quick meal, it's a doable option. I like that they have an unlimited soup and salad lunch. Service at this location is ALWAYS poor. Every. Single. Time. What can I say- I like broccoli cheese soup.  Popped in today for lunch, hoping it would be quick, and spent 15 minutes waiting to even have a server come by. Had a gal I had last time I came here- middle aged lady with a long dirty blonde braid. Ordered my meal- it was fine. Waited for another 10 minutes after I finished to be able to request a check because my gal was MIA. Got check and she took my card. Waited another 25 minutes to get to back. However, when she gave it back to me my card was not with the receipt. Last time I was here, same waitress, this also happened but I did not notice before I left. Called 15 minutes later and the card had magically disappeared. Today, I noticed it immediately, and waited another 10 minutes to ask her for my card. She acted shocked and immediately pulled it from her apron, profusely apologizing and saying she would never have stolen it, it would have been turned in right away. Hopefully that is true- however, make sure to watch for your card here!!! I certainly won't sit in her station again."
James J.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,14,,4.0,9/1/2015,"This BJ's is in an excellent location. Right off  the highway and in a mall. So the parking is free and plentiful. It's a huge inside eating area, but nothing outside. The layout is nice, there are clean restrooms along with a modern and sleek look at the bar area and dining areas. It's a sports bar so there are plenty of TVs . They also have a full liquor licenses. The food is excellent, especially the pizzas. They are know for them and I have to say they are diverse in what they have to offer. The great white and meat lovers are the best  choices to me. Love this place !"
Ash M.,"Los Angeles, CA",571,58,30,5.0,6/30/2013,"I'm a fan of BJ's. I always stick to what I know which is the small, buffalo chicken pizza with the buffalo chicken wontons appetizers and a red velvet pizookie for dessert! It's when people start venturing out and testing new things, that the service becomes bad. My biggest advice is to stick to what you know!!!  Also, be very very very careful when walking in and out and around this place. You definitely can't ever think you're too cute without tripping, slipping or close to death falling. TRUST ME!!!  Other than that, I give this location. 5 stars! My service is always great. The environment is always positive. And there's ALWAYS someone attractive to glance at!!! ALWAYS!!!"
Henry B.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,17,4,2.0,5/16/2016,After reading the reviews there is a lot of truth about the level of service. When they first opened it was an awesome place but now there has been a change. Service is slow and as I observed slow for others. I enjoy the franchise but would probably continue just going to the Burbank location
Yosxira C.,"Inglewood, CA",43,42,28,4.0,12/11/2015,"Since the last time I've been here, the service has improved! Our waiter was so nice and accommodating! The great white pizza was made perfectly! The chicken was well cooked and the cheese was melted right! Even the refreshers we received met expectations. Lastly the cookies n cream pazooki was DA BOMB.. Had me knowing the meaning of love with each bite.  Overall , VA I believe was his name is the best. I will be back BJS"
Crystal V.,"Los Angeles, CA",19,19,1,1.0,12/27/2015,"Service was OKAY. But food was cold. And my cousin ordered a pasta and it literally didn't have any sauce on it. When we told our waiter, he brought her a super small side of Alfredo sauce. I ordered a sancwhich which tasted like plastic. Honestly sucks"
Larissa G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,3,5.0,5/18/2015,"The food is great! Once my boyfriend had to stand up to a waiter due to his attitude! He was so rude beyond belief!! He completed disrespected my mom! He dropped some of our food! My boyfriend followed him, grabbed him & asked him firm, yet politely to change his attitude. He did a whole 360, LOL!! No tip for him!! Last time I went, the waiter was soooo nice, my boyfriend gave him 20$ something dollars in tip, he was great!!"
Nancy B.,"Culver City, CA",1,116,95,3.0,3/3/2016,"Mediocrity is the best word to describe the food at this location.  We've tried the Barbeque chicken salad, the potstickers, their special Mac & cheese, among others and each dish here was completely forgettable. We've been in at lunch and dinner time but the consistent thread here is just a lack of quality on every level. Service was quite slow when there's a crowd and the place is very noisy. Sunday's seem to be a very busy day with an after church kind of crowd and we waited a long time to receive that same mediocre food which was small in portion and honestly a temperature less than desirable. Too many great places to eat in the area to spend $ here again."
Morgan L.,"Inglewood, CA",5,16,29,3.0,5/13/2015,"Been wanting to try BJ's for some time took my nephew for his Birthday lunch it was very disappointing except for the drinks,the calimari was over cooked the buns were dry on the burgers  and for 40 bucks it should have been one of the better burgers we've had."
Alisha B.,"Inglewood, CA",0,4,,2.0,10/23/2016,"Went there last night the service was terrible, the lady that sat us down didnt check the table before sitting us, the table was dirty, the seat had sauce on it, my glass of water was dirty,  my appetizers were brought after my meal, WTH!  I think they need new management."
Sean S.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,14,4,4.0,5/31/2015,I guess we are more experienced on how to order at BJ's . You order appetizers and when you are done- pizza. That way you get piping hot pizza on your table.  ... And it's not that cold anymore- maybe they listened. Anyway- I do like BJ's
Alexis P.,"Santa Monica, CA",2,13,1,3.0,10/27/2014,"Don't waste your time at a table, you'll be waiting forever... This review is for the bar service...  Sitting at the bar is your best bet because the ""bar servers"" forget about you... All the time.. I went here alone and the waitress asked if I was meeting someone. I said yes but not for awhile.. Before I could get awhile out she turned and walked away!! SMH I guess that means there's no drinking alone at this bar..  So I finally flag her down for a dirty martini and I probably should have kept it clean. I got a glass full of olive juice.. Ehhh  Anyway, the happy hour is mon-thurs 3-7 and sun-thurs 10-close.. And during any big game, its happy hour as well.. Only reason I'd come back.."
Veronica R.,"Los Angeles, CA",217,476,89,2.0,11/23/2013,The food and drinks are always ok. Nothing great nothing bad. But man the hostess and some waiters are so ridiculously bad!!! So rude they swear they're not working at a Westfield BJ's. It's like come on leave the attitude at home. Overall I mostly come here during the day when it's at least more bearable. But I suggest to hop on the 90 and go to the Yard house.
Amit G.,"Placentia, CA",0,3,,1.0,4/21/2016,"I wish I could give this place negative remarks. This is the most horrible restaurant I have ever been too and a nightmare to the chair ""Bj's"". Here is my story. I have been a huge fan of BJ's and specially their avacado eggs rolls , best beginnings and Buffalo Pizza. I can literally eat that everyday. I had many facebook post which showed the check-in in BJ's. So my friends knew i am BJ Fnatic. One of friend was visting from NY and as soon as he landed at LAX he said lets go to eat at BJ's since he wanted to see why I go there so often.  Firstly we order drinks 1 Non-alcholic Pina Colada and one Sam Adams Pitcher. it took forever to drinks to come. First I thought they are trying to bring pina colada and beer together but that was not the case. Even after pina colada came in it took good 10 mins to beer to arrive. OMG next nightmare , the glasses given for beer were wet .. Wait what ? who does that !! I couldnt complain since I was trying to save the name of the restaurant and dont want my friend to feel bad about this.  Ok our appetizers was best beginnings and avocado eggs rolls , which came after 35 mins and they were COLD !!!! As if they just came out of fridge after being kept out for sometime.  Many of the things in the best beginners was not even eatable. Somehow we ate some and couldnt gulp down rest of it. Main entree was Veggie Pizza and Buffalo Pizza Large. The buffalo pizza was dead cold , this was much colder than the entree. I mean seriously guys , first thing which came in my head , this must have sat on the counter for good 30mins for this to get that cold.  The biggest nightmare , the Veggie pizza we order we couldnt eat it in restaurant since we were just 3 of us and we were full so early because of cold food. So when we went home , I was trying to eat Veggie pizza and I found beef piece in it...HOLY SMOKES I dont eat BEEF !!!!!  I had to throw that pizza  out too..  STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE..... Cleanliness is 0 ... The tables were greesy and so was the menu. I was cleaning everything using my towel.. I wont recommend this to anyone..... I have pictures I want to post. I dont know much about Yelp so I will research and post it in a bit.. - Amit"
Daniel L.,"Malibu, CA",19,10,,1.0,3/17/2016,"I have to say, one of my WORST lunch experiences EVER!  I ordered the half sandwich with fries and soup.  The soup was COLD as were the string fries.  The fries appeared old and soggy and the sandwich was, in a word, bland!  I would have complained except I was being taken out by a colleague.  I don't think I will be going back here for lunch anytime soon....or EVER!"
Matthew S.,"Los Angeles, CA",916,28,2,1.0,2/13/2016,"I'm sorry, this place kind of blows. It's always freezing cold in there and the food is mediocre. The burger is ok but nothing to write home about. Their deep dish pizza is low-rent Numero uno. And drinks are inconsistent. I wish it was better bc I live around the block."
