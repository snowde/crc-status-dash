Mary C.,"Oxnard, CA",0,18,,1.0,3/15/2016,"When the very first person who greets you (the hostess) looks and talks like you're a major  inconvenience in her life, then it's already a sucky experience. She was just rude, rude, rude."
Patricia C.,"Hawthorne, CA",3,4,,1.0,9/27/2016,"My family and myself went to dine there. We got there and host/ess were friendly. We sat down and waited about 5 min for our server to get there. Ordered drinks, 10-15 later drinks arrived and got our food order. I ordered a starter salad and that came 10 min after ordering. For our food we had to wait 40 min. In those 40 min we only saw the waitress twice. I don't know where she disappeared to. Food was brought out and mine was missing. Waitress came by 10 min after asking if everything was fine. Told her i didn't get my entree and my husbands utensils were dirty so he asked for another set. 15 minutes passed and nothing, my husband had to get up and get new ones. After 20 minutes the waitress came and said kitchen was working on my food i told her it was ok that i didn't want it anymore. Manager came by, she was really nice. Said they were working on my plate. She discounted my entree and salad. The waitress never came back for any refills or thank us nothing. Ive been in the serving industry for over 9 years and for me this is the worst service ever. I hope you guys train your servers better or management to help around."
Robert M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,42,46,4.0,3/13/2016,Good food. Fair prices. Great selection on beer and mixed drinks.
Bri N.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,34,24,2.0,8/19/2014,"Wow! There is nothing more outrageous than walking into an establishment that runs purely off of customers dining here to be greeted by the rudest, most unprofessional host. My husband and I walked into the front doors and immediately made eye contact with the hostess, Contessa. She turned away from us and stood by the menus and acted like she was taking notes on what tables would be opening soon. Not once did she acknowledge us by a smile, greeting or even a pathetic ""I'll be right with you."" Nothing....I immediately note the time and see how long we have to wait at the front before we are greeted. It took her 3 minutes to stare at tables before walking back over to take our name. They were on a small wait (10 minutes) just because your pregnant doesn't mean you have the right to ignore us and give us your disgusting attitude! I asked for her name because managers need to know how they are treated and will even determine if my family will ever entertain here again. Our server Shawn totally made up for Contessa's poor behavior. He was friendly, timely and our food was great."
Shalia T.,"Gardena, CA",42,1,,3.0,7/5/2015,we were seated immediately even after being told it would be a 20 minute wait that was awesome. After being seated we absent mindedly waited an additional 30 minutes for our waitress. directly across from us we watched a party of 2 finish off their dinner then another party of 4 be seated in their place who then began to order and still no help.  i had to flag down a bus boy to let him know we hadn't been helped. the food was OK; my celery was not hewn but white. the waitress never bought my girlfriend her drink. this is probably my 5th visit to this location and I've never had a problem before. im assuming the waitress was new. She was forgetful and seemed timid. i tried the the berry burst beer it was good and fruity. the Jeremiah red beer had a sparkling wine taste to it.
Mosi O.,"Bellflower, CA",1,25,10,3.0,3/20/2016,This was my 1st visit at this location. Our server was excellent and she deserved the tip we left her. The food selection was great. I had the Mahi Mahi tacos. The only issue that our whole group had was at the end of our experience. We were rushed out because they needed our seats for another large party...2.20.16!
John S.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,60,13,5.0,11/11/2015,"Quality food. The veterans day special was great and the staff was nice. Everything tasted as planned, A+."
Lynette J.,"Los Angeles, CA",36,37,4,2.0,2/15/2016,I love BJs but the service here sucks. The waiter was nice but everything was sooooo sloooooow. We didn't even get the appetizer ww ordered.
Nikkia M.,"Los Angeles, CA",52,42,344,2.0,10/9/2015,I hate coming to this place! The wait is so damn long. I  was told 25mins and it's been 45mins and still waiting. I would leave but what there else to eat around here. I should brought my own snack and drinks while I wait.....
Miranda C.,"Hesperia, CA",117,1,,1.0,9/10/2016,"I'm only giving one star because I have to. This was seriously the worst experience at Bj's I have ever had. First time ever at this specific location. We walked in and got absolutely no greeting from either hostess up front. Which apparently set the tone for the whole dining experience. No server in the whole restaurant was smiling or friendly. Our server, Rachel seemed to have hated her job. She did not greet us, just asked what we wanted to drink as soon as she came up to the table. We ordered and to our food was not even mediocre. Cold fries, super tiny stuffed mushrooms, and cold pizza as well. We did not bring it to her attention however, because it seemed like she disappeared for up to 20 minutes at a time. We sat with empty glasses a good portion of the meal.  Our drinks were refilled once the whole time. After we had eaten, we got asked ""are you done? Or any dessert?"" not friendly at all. But, nonetheless, who can refuse a pazookie? When it came to the table she put the book down and said nothing, we had no clue it was even there. Then she comes back not even 2 minutes later and goes is this for me? When it finally was ready she took it without a word and returned it without so much as a bye, thank you, or have a nice day. Also, during the stay I used the restroom where an employee was standing in front of the sink and playing with her hair while chatting on the phone. I needed to wash my hands and the employee just stood there and didn't excuse herself to allow me to wash my hands.  It was nothing I would've expected at a Bj's."
Alice V.,"Hawthorne, CA",0,8,,1.0,8/26/2016,"I went with my family we order the appetizer  to start but the avocados roll where burn .I told the waitresse and she just look at me and she told me that does the wait they should be, I told her I come here all the time and there not burn there crunchy but not burn...she was like what to you want me to do..and I told her I want you to exchange them she's like I need to bring the manager the manager was so rude...I always stop here for drinks but not nomore ..in the pass i have enjoined but not yesterday even my sourdough bread for my clam chowder was burn....I had to wait for manager, wait another 30min for avocado rolls"
Carlos B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,2,2.0,3/27/2016,I had never eaten here and to start off it was pretty good. The pan pizza was decent. Beer wasn't too expensive either. The thing that ruined the experience for me was dessert. I ordered a pizookie (not sure on the spelling there) and when it arrived the spoons were caked in food. Rather than offering anything at all the waiter took the dessert away and brought the check. I don't want anything for free but I still wanted dessert. That really brought down what was otherwise an alright dining experience.
Mi T.,"Long Beach, CA",90,1002,77,3.0,12/18/2014,"If you know me you know i dislike generic bland food.   But..,i had a pizzone?  I dont know what they call it. But it was a melty cookie with ice cream.  It was soooo good!!"
Lajuene R.,"Gardena, CA",0,10,8,3.0,3/29/2015,"I've been to this particular BJ's quite a few times and I have had some good and not so good experiences. This particular time was ok. It was a bit crowded, but we were seated within 15min. We waited a little while for our food and it was ok. The customer service could have been a little better. I don't want to go into too much detail (but that's the reason for the review right?), but overall it was ok."
David W.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,30,,1.0,2/5/2016,"Man, what a shithole. Now I know why I've never gone to this place before. I had a half chicken club sandwich and wedge salad. Disgusting. The salad was very wet and had no flavor. The chicken was chewy and the fries were stale. I felt bad for the wait staff. Never again. Please learn from my mistake and let's shut this hell hole down, together."
Jennifer W.,"Los Angeles, CA",101,177,125,2.0,4/9/2013,"I want to like this place more than I actually do.  I don't know why, but I always struggle to find something on the menu that I actually want to eat.  This most recent visit, I settled on an individual pizza and small cesar salad.  Pretty good combo.  The cesar salad was good, and just the right size.  The pizza was...ok. And I love me some pizza.  I would rather have eh pizza than no pizza at all.  The crust on the hand tossed 'za was good, but the middle was soggy and limp. I shared a few wings with the girls, and they were good.  We had them put the wing sauce on the size, not tossed, so that the wings didn't get soggy. For dessert, we had the pizookie trio...which works out perfectly if you have 3 people that want the mini sized cookie dessert.  Each person can choose their own flavor and have a perfect portion sized dessert. Our waitress was awesome! She was upbeat, energetic and checked in on us.  We had some issues with dirty silverware...one fork was literally stuck to a napkin, and we got 3 dirty spoons with our dessert.  WIthout us asking or making a fuss, she went to the manager and had dessert comped for us.  So nice of her! Bonus: plenty of free parking (for now) at the Fox Hills Mall Bogus: there always seems to be a wait, especially on the weekends.  We waited about 20 min on a Sunday night at 7pm."
Crystal M.,"Seattle, WA",253,227,2001,5.0,2/2/2014,"Great service and very accommodating.  Always lots if TV and lots of pizza. A must try pizookie!!! Can't go wrong with the triple chocolate. Or really any.  Deep dish is good, free parking, sit in bar to actually hear the tv though."
L J.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,222,20,3.0,10/28/2015,"This location has less of a pub feel to it and for that reason I like it as it seems a little more sophisticated. However, the service here was pretty bad. Our server herself was really sweet and I've been a server so know you often have to wait for the kitchen staff but they need to step up their game because ultimately the server is probably the one losing out when it come to tips."
Julie P.,"Los Angeles, CA",159,242,256,1.0,11/12/2013,"I don't know.  Overpriced for mediocre food.  The waitress was great.  Her name was Tequila and was constantly checking in on me.  However, the girl who escorted us to the table put us all the way in the corner and by the wall.  The restaurant was empty.  I have no idea why she would put us in the most horrible spot.  The restaurant was super cold as well.  BJ's always seem like a good idea at the time.  I wouldn't go back. Paid over $50 for 3 beers, stuffed mushrooms and a small pizza (which was horrible)."
June S.,"Los Angeles, CA",17,32,12,1.0,7/30/2015,"It's really sad to think that the BJ's I once thought was a pretty decent restaurant, is actually a giant chain heating up their signature commercialized freezer food... At least that's what most of their food tastes like. I've been to several locations, like Tustin, Century City, and a few others, but this location is probably the least impressive.  Came here for my parent's birthday because my mom wanted to use her coupon for a free appetizer. We ordered the fried calamari, which came out pretty quickly, though nothing special. I ordered the North Hawaiian Mahi-Mahi and Shrimps, which is kinda like a cioppino with cous-cous. A little salty from the kalamata olives, but I liked it. What I didn't appreciate was that my mom's burger came out more medium-rare when she ordered medium-well. And. My sister's burger first came out medium-well when she ordered medium-rare. She sent it back and the second time around, got a pretty well done burger with rare bits along the edges. She expressed her concerns to the waiter, who informed the manager. The manager came over and apologized, offered her another burger to go and then sent out some free pizookies. There was almost no point, seeing as my sister had already eaten most of the burger because she was that hungry and didnt want to wait for another burger. I appreciate their efforts to rectify the burger situation, but it sorta just goes to show how things are running in the kitchen. Maybe no ones paying attention to the grill? Do they know how long to cook a burger to different degrees? Not to mention, my dad's shrimp scampi pasta was beyond dry. Like, absolutely no sauce to spare. Not even olive oil collected at the bottom. Dry dry dry. He ate it because he's not the type to say something even though he was unhappy about his own birthday meal. I'd avoid this location if you can help it. If you really want some ""American"" food, there's a Five Guys right next door to Forever 21. Pretty sure you can get a better burger for your buck.."
