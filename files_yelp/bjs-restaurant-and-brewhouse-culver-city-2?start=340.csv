Science Lady B.,"Las Vegas, NV",20,24,17,3.0,11/29/2015,I had just arrived in town and stopped in to my favorite location..the waitress Tiffany was great...excellent attitude and lots of attention. It took over 1 1/2 to get our order and the manager brought it to us and apologized which was great..They did comp my meal but I would much rather have my meal in a timely manner.The customer service has always been outstanding and I have been coming to this location since it opened but I hope they get it together...I will say I love the century city location just a bit more..
Nicole W.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,45,,3.0,11/24/2015,"Andrew was an awesome server, he really saved the day and took up the slack. I don't know this first guy with short blonde hair, but it must have been the end of his shift. There was no warm hand off. He didn't bring napkins, a straw, no silverware, no smile. I didn't feel welcomed. I don't make much money so this was a splurge for me."
Kool P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,19,5.0,9/14/2016,This Review is solely for Garrett (spelling ) he is a very positive energy and kind server ! Totally made my experience forget I was at a meat house lol (I'm vegan ) so I was very thankful for the humble service ... Keep it up !
Mai K.,"Santa Monica, CA",192,149,77,3.0,6/30/2013,"My friend and I got seated within 10 minutes, which was nice. Our waiter was pretty attentive. We ordered the corn fritters as a starter -- I would definitely recommend it. It's only $3 for four pieces of H-E-A-V-E-N. I wish we had ordered more of this blend of corn, flour, aioli, and bacon. This aioli was really good! We both ordered burgers -- my friend ordered the jalapeno burger and I got the new bison burger. Both were medium well.  I've never had bison, which is why I wanted to try, but it tastes pretty much like beef, haha. I thought my burger was pretty dry and my friend shared a similar opinion on hers. She only had like a dollop of aioli at the top of her patty, too.  For dessert, I was stuck between the new summer berry/candied peach cobbler and a similar-sounding blend of deep-dish berries, both with vanilla bean ice cream on top. I decided to go with the former, but our waiter ended up confusing the two (understandably..) and gave me the wrong dessert. It wasn't that big a deal since the two are similar.  All in all, this BJs is good. I just wish their burgers weren't so dry!"
Justin W.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,5,,1.0,8/21/2015,"I come to diz location cuz they be smokin' up them burgers I hear about all the time. When me and this ""great burger"" come face to face, we both say, ""uh uh."" The waiter was very rude and careless, probably didn't learn his manners from his mama."
DP G.,"Torrance, CA",0,30,25,1.0,1/15/2016,"Bartenders have a poor attitude. In a bar that makes it or breaks it. I moved to the area 6 months ago and have gone several times to this BJs. Each time I am greeted with disinterest and then treated like I am a bother to the bartenders. They are rude, purposely slow and really overall just kind of miserable. Like they don't want to be there. I can only guess this poor attitude comes from management. That type of thing trickles down. It's too bad because I have always loved BJs... Go to the West Covina BJs and STAY CLEAR of this one."
Daniel S.,"Los Angeles, CA",136,74,43,5.0,4/6/2015,Sit at the bar tables and request Jane' . Very friendly and helpful. Will be back again.
Ivy W.,"Los Angeles, CA",1536,1308,2750,3.0,1/22/2013,"Not a fan of BJ's but we came for a work lunch as it's nearby. Parking is a hassle, so we valeted. Main entrance is annoying and inefficient as it's a turnstile, revolving door. Restaurant is quite large and open with high ceilings, so it's a lot nicer than most BJ's I've been to. Being a party of five, we were seated at a booth. Waitress quickly got our drink orders and brought them. She was short, which could've been mistaken for as rudeness, but she was efficient and got the job done. We ordered two appetizers, one large pizza, and a dessert to share. Spinach & Artichoke Dip Nothing to write home about, nor complain. Very basic. Comparable to the one at California Pizza Chicken. Chicken Lettuce Wraps Didn't try this, so I don't have an opinion. My coworkers all loved it. Chicken Bacon Ranch Deep Dish Pizza  We asked for bacon on the side, but it was pretty good without it. The photos on their menu make the pizzas look super thick and fluffy... which was not how the pizza looked in real life. It was still a thicker crust than how I normally like it though, as I prefer NY style thin crust. I wouldn't mind ordering this again. Chocolate Chip Pizookie Everyone's so obsessed with pizookies, and while I admit they're good, they're not as divine as everyone makes them out to be. What's so special about a warm cookie with ice cream? I don't get it. Since it was also one of my co-worker's birthday, our waitress was kind enough to give her a complimentary mini pizookie. I really like their cookie and ice cream ratio as most restaurants usually skimp out on the latter. Like with all chain restaurants, you really can't expect much. Both service and food were mediocre. Will only come back if I have no say in where to dine."
Tiarra ..,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,2,5.0,9/11/2016,"Mike at the bar was awesome!!! He kept checking on us, made my boyfriend and I great drinks and made sure we were okay throughout our visit!! 5 stars for him! Best employee I've experienced here everrrr"
Bonnie Z.,"Palo Alto, CA",70,154,236,3.0,9/26/2014,"I come to this BJ's a lot because it's close to my work, and they have some pretty good lunch specials. I usually like getting the unlimited soup and salad. The reason I gave this place 3 stars is because the food and the service both vary from day to day, from 1 star to 5 stars...so I'm just averaging it at 3. On good days, the service is quick, waiters are attentive, and the food is very tasty. On bad days, the waiters forget our food orders, the watermelon in my salad is mushy, the clam chowder is too salty...etc."
Mimi N.,"Novi, MI",3,4,2,1.0,11/15/2015,"Last night 6 of us stopped by to celebrate an event that went well nearby. We arrived well past the normal dinner rush, at 9pm.. Grabbed a table in the open seating bar area. 1) We made no change to the seats, but were asked to move 1 chair bc it was 'in the way of servers'. Okay, makes sense, but why didn't one of the many employees walking past move it while empty, before we sat down and had been waiting to be greeted? 2) Drink orders arrive - WEAK. The mojito was sugar water. They also arrived to the wrong people.. We fixed. 3) Order apps with no issue. Delivered, with no silverware - another server helped us out. 4) Apps have been finished for a solid 10 minutes before we have to flag down our server & ask to order. He just stares angrily, opens his notepad and waits. Zero words lol. 5) Food arrives 45+ minutes later.. Watched 2 tables that arrived after us receive their food. This is where we all get pretty grumpy 6) My burger is well done and cold but I'm starving so I stay quiet. 7) Food arrived without 1 order - that one shows up 20 minutes later when we are all done. At this point we've barely had acknowledgment from our server & he hasn't said more than 'sorry'. Doesn't ask if everything is ok, if he can get us anything else, etc. The classic drop & dash 8) We call a manager. He offers us dessert - that's great! The issue is we don't want to wait. He assures us they will be out very quickly. 9) 15 minutes later we flag down our server & ask for our checks, as well as the desserts to be boxed. The apparently cannot do this because they would need to be remade. 10) Check arrives in 1 (WTH?!) - we do the splits 11) Desserts arrive & one is cold.  Overall things went from 'meh' to comically bad. 2 of us have been bartenders/servers for years and had no words to help placate our group. We left tips but the lowest most of us had ever left. The was an entire Server-Kitchen-Management fail. Obviously none of us 6 will come back or recommend this place. Get your sh*t together BJs!!"
Michael S.,"Vancouver, WA",4468,2212,19024,3.0,10/28/2010,"It's a pizza restaurant ... It's a brewery ... It's a bar with late nite happy hour ... It's BJ's and it's in Culver City.   I hadn't been back to BJ's since becoming a yelper, so, this past weekend during late night Happy Hour, we joined the crowd in the bar area looking for deals.  The prices are better than regularly advertised, but still kind of high for the quality. We started with Classic Pulled Pork Sliders with roasted pulled pork, crispy onion strings, and BJ's smoky BBQ ranch sauce made with Jeremiah Red Ale. It comes with a side of coleslaw.  They actually hit the spot.  I liked them. Chicken Tenders with Honey Mustard Dressing came at the same time and didn't really stand out as anything special.  A basic and safe choice, but can't really recommend them. The best deal for happy hour is the mini-size pizza.  We chose a Southwestern Pizza with chipotle tomato sauce, spicy blackened chicken, green chilies, cheddar cheese, diced tomatoes, and cilantro.  It was a cheesy, bready mix of flavors.  Kind of satisfying and disturbing at the same time. For drinks I went with my favorite BJ's brew: the Irish-style Jeremiah Red Ale.  It's more malty than hoppy which is why it tastes so good.  The kick is nice at is 7.3% alcohol, too.  Olivia Z. got a couple Ultimate Long Islands.  She liked the blend of ABSOLUT Vodka, Tanqueray Gin, Bacardi Rum, and Cointreau Orange Liqueur, however, the Tanqueray overpowered the other flavors.  Would have been better with Bombay Sapphire.  We didn't need dessert, but got it anyways.  The Pizookie Trio is for sharing and that's just what we did.  It comes with Three mini Pizookies served with one scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. Our choices: Chocolate Chunk, White Chocolate Macadamia Nut, and Peanut Butter . The white chocolate macadamia cookie was the winner of the three. I'd avoid the PB one altogether next time. Service was kind of slow at times since there seemed to only be two waitresses patrolling the bar area.  More than once we had empty drinks or were waiting on the next food item.  Parking is easy in the mall lot. Despite being slightly overpriced happy hour items with slow service, BJ's Restaurant and Brewery earns a solid 3 stars for satisfying my late-night need for food and brews."
Anne B.,"Long Beach, CA",54,111,5,3.0,1/3/2016,"A friend wanted to hang out on New Years, and we were trying to pick a spot that was halfway between where both of us lived.  We decided to meet for lunch at this mall, and I picked BJ's since I have a few gift cards.  Unlike the last visit to this BJ's, the service was wonderful.  The waitress was friendly and attentive, and we were wished a good day by several employees as we left.  The food was okay; I LOVED the clam chowder, but I didn't like the wedge fries, and I could have made a better pesto chicken sandwich at home (it was good; but I could have done better).  I won't be returning regularly to this BJ's, but I will no longer avoid it like the plague when I'm in the area."
Chase M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,,2.0,11/1/2015,"Food is decent but have had too many problems with this place. On different occasions I have been charged for a dinner portion while receiving a smaller lunch portion, and now I had a delivery thanks to door dash but I ordered 5 things and only one showed up. They claimed that the spoke to us but never did. I was only charged for one thing but it is still unexceptable"
Daniela F.,"Calabasas, CA",32,45,36,5.0,12/9/2015,So decpite  the bad reviews they been have came here with my boyfriend was a bit worried cuz of the area.. but we had no issues. It was a Saturday and it was packed we waited for a table probably for like 25-30mins. They sat us down in the worst table I have t I say. . Lol the only bad thing I have to say . The food was pretty good I had a hamburger  that left out with a food baby lmao I'd wish I could remember the waiters name he was nice and attentive . They had forgot bacon on my bf dish and had asked if he wanted a new dish or to just bring out what was missing . Over all besides the seating it was good
Maria T.,"Los Angeles, CA",151,88,10,2.0,7/30/2015,"Wow, 20 min for waiter to greet us at table and order our drinks. Additional 15 min to get appetizer. Add another 20 for entree. A regular here and usually good service but perplexed by tonight since it's not busy."
Dessilina C.,"Los Angeles, CA",419,65,24,1.0,11/15/2014,"On a date night. Walked in and was ignored by the first hostess. Then was told we will be helped was passed up by another couple. Once seated I noticed we were seated next to two tables of ppl that has a Cough. So waited ten minutes for the waiter, another five or ten minutes to bring soup. And the server only brought out one soup. When two was ordered.  I expect the crowd. I just know when to come and dine. Mind now 20minutes and no one has come to bring the other soup of check on us."
Monica R.,"Whittier, CA",71,12,,1.0,2/22/2016,Service and food used to be better 2 years ago.  Not sure what happened since but now the food is just not good. I used to go to this BJ's sometimes twice a week and now I regret when I do make it back. I was there Friday and it took the bartender 15min (we sat at the bar) to ask for our order (mind you this is during lunch). They appetizers came at the same time as our food (30min later).... just doesn't make sense. Tried one of their new dishes and was flavor-less.  Needless to say I won't be going back.
Liza R.,"Culver City, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/31/2015,"The service is mediocre! They need to retrain their staff. Although they aren't rude, they're definitely not the most friendly either!"
Monique J.,"Inglewood, CA",0,12,3,1.0,2/21/2016,"Chose BJ""s for out girls day out spot to eat. We were seated all the way in the back, and now know apparently that's reserved for buffet style parties. My friends and I were there for a few hours, with no one telling us its a large party using that area and the time of their arrival. The manager came over and was extremely rude. He was so pushy. Kept sending the bus boys to take our glasses and plates before we could even get our tab together!! Our waitress was extremely nice and very accommodating. But the manager was absolutely horrible!!"
