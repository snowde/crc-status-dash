Simone T.,"Los Angeles, CA",169,574,1123,3.0,10/22/2014,We come to this location frequently because it's conveniently at the mall. The food is good I love the corn fritter appetizers and of course the pizookie (triple chocolate). The problem is even though the staff is nice and friendly here the service could be rather slow so we never really get all the attention we deserve and pay for.
Trent N.,"Los Angeles, CA",49,7,8,2.0,6/17/2014,"Welcome to the epitome of failed American dining.  Not only did we wait an hour after we called in to get ourselves on the priority wait list, we also had to wait an extra hour for my friend's deep dish pizza because ""something happened to it."" The food was mediocre.  My friend's burger looked like they shot a cow and the cow fell onto his plate. My fish dish had some awkwardly smudged spicy sauce that looks like a bulldozer overran the plate.  This place only gets two stars because the two hour deep dish pizza was actually a tad satisfying."
Oswaldo P.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,48,31,2.0,8/22/2014,"Subpar experience here at BJ, I feel like this restaurant has run its course. Not enough TV's,  food is mediocre at best.  Last time I come back.  Friday night and the service is extremely slow and the place isn't even full.  Must say the staff is friendly though. Ozzy P out."
Kimberly R.,"SYLMAR, CA",101,155,19,4.0,11/21/2015,I've been to this location several times and the food has been tasty.  Mind you I've only had the pizza and starters and drinks. The service is always friendly.
Marissa T.,"San Diego, CA",1,18,,1.0,5/4/2014,"I was in Culver City Friday night and wanted some late night take out. I found that BJs is open late till 1 AM on Fridays, so that made me happy! (5 stars for being open late). The rest of this review is for their take out service:  I wanted the ability to just pick up my order, and was kinda fascinated with the idea that they will take your food out to your car when you arrive. -- that didn't happen. Called at 9:30 pm for a take out order. Someone answered, but had to ""transfer me to the take out counter"", waited for 5 minutes, no answer. Then finally another gentleman picked up and said ""can you hold?"" And then they hung up after I waited on the line for another 10 minutes. The 2nd time I called, I had already arrived in the parking lot by then, they put me on hold for 12 minutes, then I hung up. Oh my goodness. 1 star for take out phone service as I was never able to talk to anyone to take my order. Since I was already in the parking lot, and I was determined to get a cheese burger, and no one else was open that late, I got out of my car and walked in to the restaurant. The place was semi full for a Friday night, but what appalled me the most was they had 3 hosts standing behind the host bar, and 1 person at the take out counter. And many waiters and waitresses in and around the restaurant.  I stood at the takeout counter for them to take my order. Their phone was ringing and they did not bother to pick up. A couple and a college student were standing by waiting for their order.  We all waited about 35 min to get our orders, because the staff did not communicate to us that out order was ready (I'm guessing it was ready after 10-15 min), even though they took our names. 1 star for lack of communication to patrons. Peeved. After everything it took me  about 50 min (including phone time) to grab a burger at BJs."
Doyle Ray T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,6,2.0,7/21/2014,I took my family here because my wife like a well made desert.   *Time of day: During the World Cup - USA & Portugal *Wait: 15-20 mins *Wait for Food:  Pretty much served on time.  My kids got their food first which was good.  The food was not bad. Service:  Our waiter was professional but seemed annoyed throughout our visit.  My drink was Never attended to or refilled.  I come from a place that customer service plays a key factor of making sure your customer will want to come back and mostly talk about their positive experience to friends and family.   I recommend BJ's management to read: Raving Fans: A Revolutionary Approach To Customer Service.
Noel K.,"Brentwood, CA",141,359,78,2.0,10/15/2014,The food at BJ's defines average.  The service was decent when I dined here on a Saturday afternoon with my family.  We were hungry.  We ate.  Nothing to write home about and it is unlikely we would dine at BJ's again.
Elizabeth Marie C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,,1.0,2/16/2016,"We decided to go here for my sisters birthday and oh did we regret it! I am so disappointed in the customer service this place has, our server was not friendly at all and she was overall rude. I will not be returning"
Ricky H.,"Redondo Beach, CA",38,126,6,2.0,1/27/2016,Stopped by on a tuesday wasnt very busy but for some reason took a very long time to get served ordered a appetizer didnt get it till the food came had to go track down the server for a fork because he took it with my salad bowl and didnt replace it. service was polite when you did get his attention but was around enough
Jo C.,"Westlake Village, CA",97,43,11,3.0,8/16/2014,"I normally don't like to write bad reviews but... This particular BJ's needs HELP! with capital letters and an exclamation mark!  Though our food was fine, the service itself was not fine. I did think our server was nice but she along with the whole establishment need a service overhaul. Food took way too long to come out. Especially since it wasn't busy. This was around 2:30-3 in the afternoon.  Not a big deal but I asked for an Arnold Palmer (ice tea/lemonade) and got an iced tea. My mother did ask for iced tea but had to wait for the server to come back to ask for sweetner. None on table. We were never asked if we wanted drink refills later on. My kid ended up drinking the rest of mine. Had to wait for an order of fries 10-15 minutes after the fact the actual entrée was brought out. No condiments were ever brought out or were asked if we needed them. I ended up getting them myself from another nearby server. Initially, our server apologized for her taking too long to take our order, ""I'm sorry for the wait. I've been dealing with these two ladies who keep asking for stuff."" Really?? Isn't that what you do? And once again, it ain't that busy. Needless to say, it was a disappointing experience. We'll stick to the BJ's we know and love by our neighborhood. Westlake and Century City should show them how it's done. There seems to be a happy vibe at other BJ's but this one...not so much. An aire of indifference is what describes them.  To be fair, I did give them a 3 based on the quality of food which was very good. If it weren't for that, I would've given them a 1."
Diana R.,"South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",12,22,2,2.0,9/20/2015,"I came here with family because we were celebrating my brother-in-laws birthday. We were a group of about 10 people and we were seated very quickly. One thing I did notice was that the air conditioner was blasting. It was very cold in the restaurant. Our waitress was nice and she took everyone's food and drink orders right away. I was very hungry and excited for the food. It didn't take long for the food to come out. My plate was on the table for about 5 minutes and my food was completely cold. It's pretty crazy that my food didn't stay hot that long. It was very disappointing because we payed about 12-20 dollars per dish and our food was cold after about 5 minutes of sitting at our table. I suggest turning the A/C down, it shouldn't have to be that cold in the restaurant. I felt like I needed a jacket."
Ron R.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,34,47,1.0,8/10/2014,"Just out-right lousy... BJ's 6000 Sepulveda Blvd. Culver City, CA 90230 First, after waiting for nearly 15 minutes for a server and growing impatient, I finally confronted the Manager (a short Latino man whose name was never revealed), was huddled up with a group of employees toward the front entrance.  I point-blank asked him if I could get some service because I felt as though"" I were stranded on a desert island.""  He stared at me for a moment seemingly bewildered, and simply said,"" Yes."" Adding fuel to the fire and Immediately thereafter, a very tall woman by the name of ""Mecca""  came to our table who only proved to be agitated, passive aggressive, and quite frankly rude and unprofessional.  She even sought to challenge my complaint by asking me what I meant by saying I felt like I was stranded on a desert island...  Her general deposition was sarcastic, snippy, and dismissive.    Adding insult to injury, the men's restroom was permeated with the smell of urine, the Cesar salad was welted, the deep-dish pizza was served lukewarm, as was the hamburger and fries my kids ordered. Needless to say, I will never return to this restaurant again; the entire staff seems grossly incompetent, the food is below par, and the management it self has simply failed the customer and its staff by failing to lead in every sense of the word...   If I could rate this restaurant on a scale of 1-10, I would give them a score of NEGATIVE TEN (-10)."
Priscilla C.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,2,,1.0,8/13/2016,Terrible customer service. They brought are drinks 30 minutes late. Are order got messed up they took the meal to supposedly fix it and when they brought the fixed meal it was wrong again. Really my meal was quite simple. They brought are entrees when we had finished our food which I didn't want anymore. I'm very disappointed in this service and I wouldn't even put a one star if it wasn't because I had to rate it! Never coming again.
Justine A.,"Wichita, KS",32,149,13,1.0,10/25/2014,"Service was ridiculous. Our server disappeared after taking our drink order. She didn't come back until she dropped off the check. She had 5 other tables besides mine which would explain why. But she completely forgot my table and what we ordered. She over charged us for meals we didn't order. No one at my table ordered a small pepperoni pizza or added avocado to their burgers..but somehow it appeared on our bill. When I told our server , she assumed that I had the pizza! I said no? I had a Caesar salad. She was completely confused.  Food was good. But here's a tip: servers should only take certain amount of tables that they can handled. The one star is for your server and the lack of service my family and I received."
Masanori T.,"Santa Monica, CA",46,113,,1.0,10/10/2015,"So this is supposed to be  supposed to be a sports bar, right? I come here with my son to watch a premiere college football match up, and they say ""sorry we don't have that channel [Big Ten Network]. WTF?  I don't care what conference it is, or that it was my alam mater playing, if you have two relatively highly RANKED teams playing, any self-respecting sports bar should show that gosh darn game. This is America! (Oh and by the way, wings are just about the only edible item on your pathetic menu - when's the last time you took a look at your menu, or cared about the quality of food? 1963?)"
Lauren W.,"Venice, Los Angeles, CA",215,3,3,1.0,8/21/2015,Yikes! This is the first time in 2 years that I've been to this BJ's location. Very big disappointment. It tasted like they zapped every meal in the microwave. My mom's deep dish pizza wasn't warm and it was very salty. My lemon thyme chicken tasted like a frostbit Lean Cuisine frozen meal. We kindly notified the server and he couldn't care less. There's a reason this place only has 2.5 stars... I will not return.
Lauren Milan W.,"South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",32,37,36,3.0,5/27/2014,Came to this location for happy hour... 1. Waitress was non-attentive. 2. Wait time for 2 appetizers was completely ridiculous. 3. Food finally came & was mediocre at best. The only positive thing I have to say about this experience is that the beer selections from the happy hour menu are pretty tasty. The 3 stars are strictly for the drinks.
Maria R.,"Culver City, CA",67,1,,5.0,1/19/2016,Not sure what beer to have? JEREMIAH RED! It's not too bitter nor too sweet rather strong :) one does it for me :)
Steve L.,"Santa Monica, CA",143,1190,17,2.0,11/17/2012,"Definitely wasn't the worst experience, but I can see why there was no wait for getting a table here....  Granted we had the extra need of figuring out what to order with some dietary restrictions.  It was nice that they had a booklet that outlines what items are included, but they don't tell you how to avoid them in your food.  Simple things like removing the cheese, or switching out buns etc, our server had no idea.  Anyway, made our own modifications, hopefully works out ok. Service here wasn't more then mediocre.  Ordered a medium pizza, got a small.  When I asked about it, the server initially took it back, saying sorry.  Instead of asking if I wanted to start with the small, and then have another small added in a few minutes, OR if I wanted to wait for the medium... the server came back with the small and said I could start on that while another would be prepped.  I'm sure he was intending on me getting food faster, but just ask...  Overall food is pretty good.  Don't look at calories here if you feel guilty with what you eat.  Everything looked over the top.  Tasty, but you may want to go on a run, or at least a walk after the meal."
Krissey B.,"Inglewood, CA",122,43,2,5.0,11/30/2015,Came here for a night out with my mom and Brittany b(I think that's the waitresses name) was extremely friendly. She completely went out of her way to assist us and kept checking up on us throughout our meal(unlike many other local restaurants). We will definitely be back as this is my new favorite :-)
