Amit L.,"Los Angeles, CA",133,189,52,5.0,1/13/2013,"Since it's located beside a mall, I figured it would be packed. My party and I had to wait 15 minutes before a table opened up for us. The young lady who escorted us to our table was polite. Our waitress was very friendly, hilarious, and attentive. She knew what we needed before we thought of it. Her focus was on putting a smile on our faces and producing a beautiful dining experience for our enjoyment. Two strong rounds of Buttery Nipples before our appetizers gave me a nice little buzz for food. lol! The Albacore Poké on wonton crisps were out of this world! The stuffed mushrooms were loaded with cheese and seasoned bread crumbs. The calamari was super crispy and hot out of the fryer. The potato skins were light and crisp as well.  The Bacon Cheddar Cheeseburger was huge. I thought the patty was a little dry,  but didn't mind that at all. The garlic aioli went very well with the burger. It was served up with potato wedges...Mmm Mmm Delicious! The menu is a bit pricey but well worth it for an auspicious occasion. I loved the ambiance. All the football games were on all the flat panel tv screens at very corner of restaurant. Loved the bar set up...looked very elegant. Inside the restaurant was clean and the restroom was clean as well.  Parking is a bit of a hassle to find on your own in the parking structure but feel free to valet outside in front of the restaurant. 5 stars all around. :)"
Bryden P.,"Los Angeles, CA",22,43,1,1.0,12/23/2015,"Eugene, the manager replied to my review and asked me to message him. I did, and I never got a reply. It is all for show apparently. I am even less impressed with this BJs now."
Adam T.,"Torrance, CA",163,3,,5.0,7/2/2016,"I don't usually leave reviews, but I had a pretty good experience at this restaraunt. I had a waitress by the name of Amanda who was extremely nice and constantly checked up on us. Will be coming back to this location again."
Stella Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",819,704,512,2.0,10/29/2012,"I bragged and bragged about coming to BJs because I loved it so much. I've always given 5 stars to the one's I've gone to. Unfortunately, I was thoroughly disappointed. 3 of us went at 5:30PM on a Sunday night which was already pretty crowded. We got a booth on the side with very dim lighting. I understand it was busy but our waitress took forever to help us the whole time. I got the jalapeno burger and expected some cheesy, crunchy and spicy goodness. The burger was bland and I could barely find the jalapenos through the 1 slice of cheese. I think it was the bun that made the burger look big. The potato wedges were pretty good and soft but were not well seasoned like they mentioned. My friend got the BJs favorite pizza and claimed it too salty.  I don't know what it was about this location but I'm still optimistic that it can bounce back and give me the burst of flavor I'm looking for."
James R.,"Inglewood, CA",258,16,383,4.0,11/19/2014,I've been here many times before so I am used to the BJ's experience.  We celebrated my son's birthday and had a rather large party.  The servers were great and even the manager assisted several times throughout the night.  The food was great and I always enjoy coming here to eat my favorite comfort foods.
Charlene B.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,3,,5.0,7/1/2015,I liked my waiter Brian. After he gave me my food I watched him from across the room. He was looking @ my table. He looking 2 c what was missing. He came back 2 the table with it b4 my friend had a chance 2 ask. He did his job even after 2 make sure we the customer was happy. So I give him my 5 star rating
Darlene R.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,3,3,1.0,11/18/2015,"Worst customer service ... Got changed twice and only thing they said ""sorry there only one manger in charge""... They never find the problem ."
Candi R.,"Chicago, IL",19,10,17,3.0,6/27/2014,One star for the food one star for the price and one star for the locations and cleanliness (sorry they had to share) anyway I took off one star for the waiter and another for the timeless sorry they don't get to share! OK so where do I begin...There is definitely some glitches in there app they encourage u to download and honey it's simply not worth the hassle. The food and price is delicious and makes up for the waiter who forgets ur there and don't provide u with napkins silverware or water but if u don't mind using your fingers being a little parched and waiting awhile u will be just fine lol the waiter was leaving for the day introduced me to the new waitress and asked did I mind giving him his tip and closing out my bill I hadn't even ordered dessert well i guess I didn't need that anyway lol I guess he did save me a few calories lol. (The brightside)
Crissy L.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,119,6,2.0,1/10/2016,"I should've checked the Yelp reviews for the restaurant before ordering delivery on LA Bite. Doh! I was too in a rush and remembered the food at the Westwood location was decent when I had eaten there a long time ago. Pizza was gross. That's the bottom line. I'm not sure it even qualified as a pizza because it was just bread and cheese, no sauce. It was way too salty (to the point where I almost just threw the pizza away), and the tomatoes they put on top were canned tomatoes. WTF. Canned tomatoes on a pizza? Super gross. My boyfriend got the turkey burger, and he said the texture of the burger was really strange. The patty was mushy... as if the burger wasn't 100% turkey and there was some kind of grain mixed in. He didn't care for it. I would've given the place one star, but the pizookie was delish. Can't beat super fatty buttery cookies and ice cream!"
Amelia G.,"Hawthorne, CA",1,6,4,4.0,12/12/2015,"I came last night for a girls night out. The place was packed with people and everyone seemed to be having a good time. Don't understand why some people were complaining? The place was clean and the service was great. The waiter that we had was great. Don't remember his name but he had a nice Irish accent and also had a gold star on his collar and asked him what was that on his shirt.  He said he received it for great customer service. And he was very polite and gave an excellent service with us too. I've been to other BJs b4 but this one was the best to come too. So would recommend the beer, the food and the great service"
Kaitlyn W.,"Carlsbad, CA",148,69,42,3.0,3/23/2015,"This bjs was..........PACKED.  granted it was this past Saturday night and we had a party of 12 haha so there was a fat chance of getting us in. The host was pretty nice but seemed very overwhelmed. We put our name in then decided to go to the bar to get a drink. It was just me and my cousin and we sat down at a table that was dirty because it was packed and we asked one of the busboys very politely, to come in clear off the table so we may order. It took about 15 minutes for a busboy to come back to clean off the table.  It was another 10 minutes before a sever even came over and I understand that it was busy, I'm a server also, but he only had a few tables in the bar area and was completely weeded.  When he finally came over we ordered 2 berry burst ciders and asked for the check to come with the drinks. He looked at me like I had just offereded him then made a comment that made me feel bad that we weren't staying longer.  But we sat and waited for our drinks,then sat some more, then sat for a total of 15 minutes to wait for her to stupid beers that take about 30 seconds each to pour in it took 15 minutes. We downed our beers got up and left. Being busy is one thing but providing crappy service when you are busy is another. I will never come back here on a weekend, that's for sure haha."
Lisa W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,14,6,1.0,8/21/2015,"Alas, what happened, BJs?  Used to look forward to your deep dish pizza, but tonite you served me a lukewarm, salty, mushy microwave poor excuse for deep dish.  And when I kindly shared the truth with my server (who asked) he said nothing.  If he didn't even care, why ask.  Next time, food court"
Rachelle J.,"Inglewood, CA",3,9,3,1.0,11/7/2015,Slow!! I always avoid this place but the family wanted to come. Of course they never disappoint with the slow service and cold food. Should have done the endless pasta at Olive Garden.
Tony R.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,21,2,5.0,7/16/2014,"I really enjoyed this place! The food was delicious. The beer selection was really good.     I was VERY impressed with Alejandro!  He took such good care of us. Service means a great deal to me and he really was excellent.  He reminded me of what good service looks like. He is such an asset to the establishment. His meticulous care really made the evening special!     Even though the place was very busy,  our food came quickly.      I highly recommend this place!"
Joelle B.,"Granada Hills, Los Angeles, CA",3,1,3,5.0,5/10/2015,I get is Mothers's Day and it was very crowded but they did an amazing job of sitting us very quickly. I will definitely go to this one again. Just to see Jake. Jake is the BEST waiter there!! Whenever you go ask for Jake's section. He is super sweet and knows his customer service. Great experience.
Jennifer M.,"Los Angeles, CA",37,8,4,1.0,5/10/2015,"I had the worst experience. The waiter was rude. My food came out cold 3 different times. My daughter meal did not come with the fries and when we brought it up to the waiter his response was ""I came by several times and asked you if everything was ok"" he made it seem like it was our fault that they forgot our fries. I talked to the manager and she simply responded that she was going to talk to the kitchen. No apologizes or anything. This place is horrible with horrible service and management."
Denise P.,"Cerritos, CA",37,14,42,4.0,2/25/2015,Having a great experience here celebrating my nephew play. The service great our waitress is great her name was Christina.    The manager needs a little help as a manager she will not work with us Kim brown I hope corporate see this. She would not give us a deal because we was a big party :(
Farah R.,"Lawndale, CA",15,71,9,2.0,5/18/2014,"Went into bjs last night with a few friends. We started out as just 5 of us at 7:30pm and by 08:30, the rest of our party joined us (we were a total of 12 people). While waiting for everyone else, we sat at one of the bar tables. After a few minutes, the waiter strolled over, no smile, no introduction, no basic ""Good evening, how are you tonight"" banter... just down to the basic, ""What can I get you guys?"" He looked like he was having a bad day and if anyone was to ask for too much, he was gonna tell them where to go. Bearing that in mind, we ordered. I got a water to start and my hubby got a black and coke. Please tell me why it took 10 minutes for me to get my water? It came after my husband got his black and coke. Last I checked, they don't actually have to assemble the water like an alcoholic beverage.... Now comes the food. We ordered their deep dish pizza, half cheese and half pepperoni. We requested no tomatoes on the cheese portion. It came with tomatoes. We scraped them off. The pizza itself was not crunchy and not very flavorful either. It was a bit soggy on the crust and tasted a bit old. It was also medium warm when we received It, not piping hot like it had just come out of the oven.  We had a little better service when we moved to a bigger table, but we had already eaten by then. If you don't want to be at work, then don't come in cause the attitude really is not necessary. Plus you sure as hell ain't gonna get a great tip. Needless to say, I won't be returning to this BJ's any time soon."
Brian M.,"Santa Monica, CA",21,58,99,1.0,3/30/2014,"First off, horrible service! They always seem to take care of large parties first. I remember calling in to reserve a table for a party of three. The woman said no, we don't do reservations. How do you serve large parties if you don't take reservations?? The hostess area needs a change.  When it came time to order your food it sucked. I got my appetizers first before my drinks. Even then, all drinks weren't served at the same time. On many occasions, it took about 20 minutes just to receive my drinks.  I also felt mistreated. Just thinking of the demographics (people) I felt like the African Americans were getting far more better treatment than I did.  The noise level in this place is loud and most ""fellow"" patrons are obnoxious and annoying.  Don't go to this place. Visit another BJ's, like Westwood location."
Francisco B.,"Crenshaw, Los Angeles, CA",7,3,,1.0,10/26/2014,"Brought my family to have lunch only to be greeted by staff that felt that my baby's stroller is a big inconvenience to them. We didn't feel welcomed at all, this is not the first time we visit this restaurant, in fact, I've been a customer since they opened.  The staff made me break down my baby's stroller and stuffed it in a corner, when we got to the table the high chair was very dirty and sticky. I asked the hostess to clean it and she only grabbed a few napkins and smeared it more. At this point I had enough and we left. We went to Olive Garden across the way here where they are baby friendly.  Management need to work on figuring out where to park strollers since I see lots of families come here to dine. Maybe park them in the big patio that they have available??"
