Bianca B.,"Los Angeles, CA",42,27,3,1.0,10/7/2017,"Zero stars if I could. Ordered a pizza and appetizer tonight. Appetizer was $12 and tiny, but the worst part was the undercooked pizza for $26. The pizza got me sick and the manager offered us a free dessert. Ugh, no im sick now I don't want a free desert. No offer to take the pizza off the bill. Thanks for the $3.00 discount! Never again ewww"
Linda E.,"Inglewood, CA",0,8,18,3.0,7/2/2017,"Delicious brunch!! However , service was slow. The nice thing about it was that the waiter acknowledged it without us saying anything and made up for it by letting us choose a complimentary poozokie."

Krissten M.,"Los Angeles, CA",52,9,2,5.0,10/30/2017,"came in on monday 10/30/2017 for a late lunch with a couple friends and usually i've had average service here, but today our server Julius R was incredible, super friendly, informative, and over all pretty damn great. i will honestly be coming back in hopes that he would be my server again.   shout out to julius r for being probably the best server BJs has."
Jeff N.,"Culver City, CA",2,17,11,1.0,9/1/2017,"Came to try to have a nice brunch before going shopping and it was a fail. Can't blame the waitress for all it. The kitchen and management share the blame as well for this debacle. We were seated after 11am figuring that since they opened at 10am they would be good to go for the day guess not. Ordered coffee and was told it was brewing which is fine. But then is comes 30 min later right before the first half of our food came out. Now to the food. One in our group ordered a simple breakfast of sausage, eggs, and potatoes and some how the chef forgot the potatoes. I ordered an open face burger with a fried egg on top and they forgot the egg. So instead of taking the plates back to get fixed 20 min later a fried egg on a plate and a side of potatoes comes out. Around the same time as my daughter's breakfast came. We all finally start eating when the last person in our group that we thought may have gotten away with no issues finds a long think black hair scrambled into her eggs. That was it. I didn't have the stomach to eat anymore. Her plate was taken off the bill but that was it. Nothing from the manager on duty. Since he/she couldn't take the time to acknowledge issues I will not take the time to consider BJ's a place to take my family to eat."
Leah L.,"San Fernando, CA",1,4,1,2.0,6/14/2017,"Me and my friend had dinner at this location last night. Great service, waiter was very attentive. The reason I'm giving 2 stars is because the burger my friend ordered was horrible. The patty they brought on the first burger was tiny and weird shaped so much so that you could see the bottom bun. In my opinion if I order a burger from a restaurant I shouldn't be able to see the bottom bun through the patty. The second burger, the patty was slightly better, still small and oddly shaped. Extremely disappointed because we go here often, basically a Tuesday ritual for us. The only other bad experience was slow service from another waiter and over cooked mozzarella sticks. I'd suggest checking your food before eating it"
Mike T.,"Los Angeles, CA",468,366,4,4.0,7/10/2017,"I always sit in the bar so I don't know what it's like to get service at a table at this location. Food is always tasty and good. Happy Hour food & drinks in the bar area are great. The service doesn't always knock my socks off, but still 4 stars solid. I like their Rewards program where I occasionally get free stuff and get notified when there are Free Pizookie (Dessert) days or other specials going on."
Patrick S.,"Torrance, CA",1546,415,1722,5.0,3/25/2017,"so good,  love this place. food was great, beer was great, service was amazing, thanks heather!!!!  did the call ahead seating and they got us in as we requested. got some beers, and then ordered our food. food came out hot and fast, tasted amazing, got a free dinner for yelping some pictures. cant beat that. desert was good, service was great, staff was nice and helpful. i go back here as much as i can. thanks !!"
Franklin A.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,37,,5.0,12/14/2017,"We'll service isn't the waitstaff but kitchen mainly they put your order in and guess what wait hoping they read any particulars and succeed in preparing them. AsI don't write reviews that often I have to mention to ask for Contessa the best server at any location I've been to. Has all wanted items there before you even think to ask, not overly pushy on extra items but does mention them if asked, brilliant! Happy hour specials are a bonus! Going there for lunch today join me"
Kalisa F.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,13,,1.0,8/21/2017,"Second time I've been here on the half off pizza day and they gave us the receipt without the discount. When we asked for the discount they went back and gave it to us, but should we have to do that?"
C N.,"Encinitas, San Diego, CA",2,3,,1.0,3/26/2017,"Worst service I've ever experienced. I stopped by with my lil sister I didn't want to eat much just got her a kids meal while at the mall and side for me.  I had a server by the name of Edger was ignored the whole time and double charged for things he brought out on his own without asking. He was rude when trying to correct the check. They shouldn't doubt people for ordering little. I'm all for tipping generously, but not while being treated unfairly."
Allisen B.,"Culver City, Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,2.0,8/5/2017,"So, here's the deal. I've been working in the restaurant industry for over 6 years, so I completely understand not getting 5 star, or even decent service on a busy night. Really, I get it. But honestly, my experience at this BJ's was one of the worst experiences I have EVER had at any restaurant in my entire life.  My friend and I (both server/bartenders) came in on a Thursday night. The restaurant was full, but we sat down immediately. Our server, I don't remember his name, but he was a tall African American fella, came to greet us immediately. He was very loud and almost robot like. Reminded me of a used car salesman. Which was fine. I have my own strange persona that I put on sometimes when serving. We ordered drinks. She got a coke and I got a Sauvignon Blanc. Then he rushed away. Our drinks took 25 minutes to arrive and we never saw our server in between that time. We had to flag down the server in the section next to him in order to order our food! I got the garlic Parmesan carrots (I really only came for the wine and a Pizookie. Yo girl had had a rough day) and my friend got an appetizer. About 5 minutes later, my friend decided she also wanted a salad. We flagged down that same nice server and she ordered the salad with him. Finally, we got our drinks. 15 minutes go by, and my friend's salad arrives. Yay! Another minutes go by. Her appetizer arrives. My carrots are nowhere to be seen. Another 20 minutes go by. Mind you, we haven't seen our server since he took our drink orders. Not once did he come to check on us to make sure we were okay.  I finally flagged down that nice server (kudos to him!) and inquired about my carrots. He profusely apologized for the carrots being lost in translation, and brought them out about 10 minutes later. They were okay. I mean I wasn't expecting much, but definitely not worth the 35-40 minute wait at this point. Finally we're done. We wait another 10 minutes until we FINALLY see our actual server again. He apologizes for the mix up with my carrots and brings me a free mini pizookie (which I was going to get anyway because I downloaded the app) with the bill. When we take a look at the bill, my FRIEND'S SALAD was taken off the menu. The item that came first! She offered to pay for my carrots, which was nice. We never saw that server again. We waited another 10 minutes before deciding to just pay up at the front.  Like I said, I understand if a server is having a rough night, or if it's really busy. I work at a restaurant that's notorious for 25-30 minute tickets times on a Saturday night. But we sat at that table for over an hour and a half and we only saw our server twice. I was never asked if I wanted another glass of wine, my food was completely forgotten about, no one asked how we were doing or if we even enjoyed the meal. I felt like we were totally forgotten about! I was so disappointed. I don't go out very often, and when I do, I want the experience to be worth it. This was definitely a waste of a night off for me.  To any Manager's who are reading, you need to train your employees to pay more attention to your customers. It's really disappointing and embarrassing when you have two girls who know the restaurant struggle get absolutely terrible service. Either you need to hire more people or you need a team meeting. I will absolutely not be coming back.  (Giving two stars because the bathrooms were clean and stocked, and for that nice server who took the time to take care of us even though we weren't his table. Now THAT is service)"
Angie G.,"Los Angeles, CA",83,9,2,5.0,10/13/2017,"Our waiter Charles was so helpful, polite and informative! My family really enjoyed the help and the food!"
Molly R.,"Inglewood, CA",18,3,1,5.0,10/13/2017,Decided to come to BJ's on my lunch break since it's really close. Our server was Charles today and I must say he has great customer service. He made sure that we were satisfied and if we need anything while we ate our meal. Thank you Charles keep up the great work !
Megan R.,"Diamond Bar, CA",153,3,,1.0,10/18/2017,"If I could give no stars, I would. Worst experience ever. Worst service ever. Paid $73 for shit"
David L.,"Moss Point, MS",1,9,,2.0,11/3/2017,"After a LONG flight in to LAX we just wanted a beer and food. So like on many times after our biweekly or monthly flight we went to BJ's. The Server was nice and professional, read our order back to us to ensure accuracy (like any good server would do). Food comes out and I had the wrong entree. Apparently the kitchen mixed it up so, she took the entree back to the kitchen to get the right order. Well, it seems they didn't have my entree at all..! So I had to wait another 25 minutes for my food while my girlfriend waited so not to eat without me so she ends up eating a cold meal. The shift manager came over and apologized - like he should of. Here is why I gave em 2 STARS.. I received my bill they did NOT take off anything for the mix up or the extended wait time. I would of thought with such a CRAPPY EXPERIENCE the management would have done the right thing and at least took some of the cost off the bill. I am a bit salty over this experience, so I feel we will be finding another restaurant to visit on our future returns to LA."
Symphony S.,"Los Angeles, CA",174,99,219,3.0,5/3/2017,Yesterday was my daughters birthday and she turned 9. She wanted to go to BJ's because she loves their Root beer. Who doesn't it is good. But our experience was very mediocre. We were sat very quickly but was ignored for about 20 mins. Servers kept passing us and not a one greeted us. I noticed the section we were seated in was empty so i'm sure a server wasn't assigned. I finally  grabbed a servers attention and was able to get them to take us. I ordered a wine since it was Tuesday half off wine which was cool. Food wise my daughter ordered the kids chicken tenders with fruit and i ordered the stuff potato. The food wasnt amazing my broccoli was under cooked and hard but eatable and my wine came half way through my meal. The young lady who was serving us was polite and helpful. We told her it was my daughters birthday and she said she would get a free dessert. My daughter was excited because we saw two other birthdays were the staff came over and sang with a candle and the dessert. Well dessert came no song no candle and my daughter was a little sad. I sang her Happy Birthday and while i sang the table next to us received the real Birthday treatment. To say the lease our time at this BJ sucked! Wasn't Horrible wasn't Great. They should really step up their customer service and dinning experience.
Monica F.,"Los Angeles, CA",35,188,131,4.0,3/5/2017,Much better. Ordered take out via phone call. The person who helped me gave good suggestions.
Kinshuk G.,"El Segundo, CA",2,45,3,1.0,2/1/2017,"Worst customer service. Ordered takeout and they gave me a half order of my jambalaya. I called to complain to the female manager, who's asking me to bring back the half order which I have already eaten, as I was starving, trying to get me to drive back 10 miles.  The managers name is EMILY.  She didn't do anything To compensate us. She gave us a hard time of even crediting us for the jambalaya. This is the 2nd time at this location and 1 time at the Torrance location where they Fuck Up Take-out. Eat there or double check before you leave."
Chuck L.,"Lunenburg, MA",114,73,1,3.0,9/24/2017,The beer here was excellent but they were out of my first choice. How do you run out of a signature beer? Oh well. I am over it. We just had apps. The spinach dip was amazing! We also got sliders and boneless tenders. There were four sliders. Each contained a quarter of a hamburger. This was extremely weak! It tasted OK. It was just very small. The tenders were shrivelled up chunks of chicken.... God only knows what part the bird it was. It was nasty like KFC! The texture was gross. The flavour was gross. I would recommend this place for a beer and some spinach dip but nothing more. I serious doubt that I would visit this chain again.
