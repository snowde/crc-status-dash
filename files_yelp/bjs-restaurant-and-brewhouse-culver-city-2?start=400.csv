Christa F.,"Redondo Beach, CA",32,23,3,3.0,9/27/2014,"The service here was decent, but I was surprised it wasn't more baby-friendly, especially since it's attached to the mall. It is kid-friendly, though. They had a plastic cup, crayons and placemat for a kid. They have booster seats and high chairs, but they make you fold up your stroller and leave it in the main lobby area. It was a bit awkward, since I'm guessing a lot of people go to the restaurant with strollers. I'm glad I had a friend to hold my baby while I dealt with this inconvenience. Also, the high chairs are very short and the booster seat was sticky. The food was ok, but nothing special. The wait staff was nice, so that's good!"
Guillermo B.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,10,,1.0,1/14/2016,"My Main problem was the host and the waitresses were so busy talking about there personal life, that it took a supervisor/MANAGER to walk over and address them telling them that ""I was a VIP"" and to get me a table. After that we were finally in after knowing everyone's business and who's sleeping with whom. The service was OK the waitress brought out my App and main course at the same time which the soup was cold and my fish and chips had no flavor. My daughter had the pepperoni pizza she told me she didn't like the cheese ""what kid doesn't like cheese"" but she was right it did taste funny."
Scott H.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,38,9,4.0,7/29/2014,"BJs is a great place to go. They offer the highest quality food, and the place has a nice feel to it. My only complaint is twice now they either forgot the appetizer or brought salad and main course at the same time. Manager, who I did not ask for came over, and he  blamed technology. He should be fired as he is an idiot. Its worth going to, Just order your appetizers first, than when you get them, order your main course. Thanks for reading!!!"
Patricia W.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,9,5,4.0,11/8/2015,"Popped in on a Thursday evening, close to 6:00. Was seated promptly - party of 2. Not being too hungry, we decided on soup and flat bread.  We ordered as soon as our waiter came.    We ate our meal and waited more than 15min for our waitress to return - she never returned.  I asked for a manager and Caleb helped us out. While waiting, our waitress finally appeared, and asked us if there was something we needed! Lol    ""How does this restaurant work?"" Do we not eat and pay?  Luckily Mgr Caleb witnessed the conversation. Our bill was reduced by 15%. I just wanted to receive basic, hospitality service.      This is only my 2nd visit to BJ's.  I will say the restaurant was busy, the bar area was full also.    Thank you, Caleb.  Do not give up on this restaurant. We need eateries that offer more than high cholesterol, low substance meals in the vicinity."
Chris M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,2,3.0,6/22/2015,Holy crap they took away the porkchops Best thing on the menu and they got rid of it what were they thinking maybe I'll show up again if they bring back the porkchops
John B.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,16,,1.0,11/5/2015,"Went to eat with family, got seated.  Waited 20 mins and no one and I mean no one bothered to come to our table.  The waitress' came by 10 times had eye contact and yet not one wanted to wait on us.  I always loved the food and the drinks here, but I will never go back to it again!!!!!"
Tyler S.,"Santa Monica, CA",33,20,2,1.0,1/3/2015,WORST. PIZZA. EVER! They claim to have deep dish pizza - it is not. It is as thick as a couple of pancakes. Save your money and time; order dominos. Deep dish pizza comes in a two or 3 in deep pan! This is about half an inch!
Di P.,"Oakland, CA",97,46,,3.0,6/6/2016,The food I ordered was bland and overpriced (a bowl of chili and a small salad with mushrooms and asparagus pieces) but our waiter Jose S was phenomenal.  He was able to remember everyone's order without taking anything down and some of us had had special requests. He was also fast and very friendly.
Danni M.,"Irvine, CA",69,33,28,1.0,6/28/2014,"Not a good experience and a waste of time. Waited over an hour for our pizza.  Ordered the calamari and it fell short of expectations. Not crispy. The pieces were huge and there was no flavor.  Won't be coming back. The waiters couldn't even find the manager...  Don't get the deep dish pizza. If you've ever had real deep dish, you'll be quite disappointed."
Tara B.,"Los Angeles, CA",24,8,3,1.0,5/26/2014,"If you ever eat here, PAY WITH CASH!! They charged me three times for three different amounts and claimed that they have no recollection of doing so. After numerous phone calls with the manager Felix, I had to go ahead and call my credit card company and report fraud.  This not only happened to me, but two of my friends as well. All I can advise is that if you do eat here make sure to monitor your bank account. They definitely have some shady workers here!"
C C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,1,1.0,2/15/2015,"Worst service ever tonight at BJ's. First, there were open seats and unclean tables.  Yet, I was told there was a 30 minutes wait. Then, my waiter stated he was taking a break and passed us off to a waitress who was unresponsive and untimely.  Service was slow and incorrect. I've eaten here several times and have never complained about service before.  Management seemed as equally unresponsive and as baffled as I was about our servers inability to service our table.  I'm disappointed to say the least. I was so affected, I was unable to complete my meal.  The kicker was that tables surrounding ours were as disappointed. I'll have to rethink my dining experience here in the future."
Tricia T.,"Lawndale, CA",0,22,52,3.0,9/1/2015,"Been coming here for several years now so I figure I should leave a review. I definitely feel like the dinner service is more attentive than the lunch service. For some reason, the off days just seem like they're when I come in for lunch versus dinner. The food is always good, so no problem there. But service is sometimes hit or miss. Servers kinda seem like they have too much to do. I've been in the F&B business since I started working my first job so I know sometimes positions withstand too much for what it's worth. But I don't think it justifies the attitude to the guests. Oh well. I'll still come for the food."
Stephanie L.,"Santa Monica, CA",285,676,6,4.0,1/14/2013,"PIZOOOOOOKIE! Pretty much the only reason I come here.  Over-sized freshly baked warm chocolate chip cookie pie thingy topped with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream -- SO GOOD.   If you've never tried it, you absolutely MUST. That is all."
Ed A.,"Riverside, CA",10,112,73,2.0,8/28/2015,"Well, I would have to say I experienced my first bad visit at BJ's. Getting seated wasn't bad but it took 20mins before anyone came by. We were going to order appetizers but by now we figured we would just order. The pizza was a bit under cooked and there was no offer of grated cheese or peppers. To make a long story short, we won't be back to this particular location."
mona f.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,10,,5.0,12/15/2015,"Go here once a week and the food is consistently good, service is friendly and prompt.  Prices are also reasonable.  Great place to sit at the bar and watch a game at your lunch hour."
Chioma A.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,21,6,4.0,9/7/2014,"I visit this BJ's very often. Usually on a Friday or Saturday night after 8pm. My boyfriend and I pretty much order the same things lately. Atlantic salmon (blackened), served with rice and steamed vegetables. Dessert is always a mini chocolate chip pizookie. Bj's blackened salmon is delicious to me. Sometimes I get it over a ceasar salad.  I call ahead for a table these days. It helps reduce the wait time. The staff can leave much to be desired. The servers can be a hit or miss (same with most big franchise establishments). I enjoy the place overall."
Vichea C.,"Lomita, CA",17,126,83,4.0,8/1/2015,"The pazookie is by far the best dessert here. Can't let it sit for too long, otherwise it will harden. Macadamia nut with white chocolate is served warm and crunchy. Strawberry beignet was okay, was expecting it to be better."
Gina M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,11,4,1.0,6/25/2016,So disappointed with the quality of the food..i ordered chicken lettuce wrap not happy and check the lettuce before eating.
Mizraim A.,"Inglewood, CA",1,22,5,1.0,9/29/2015,"Came here again after a really bad experience , in the past decided to give it a second shot , why not , but really really disappointed with their service our waiter took forever to bring out the food and they forgot about my fries , not only they brought them after 45 minutes but the charged for them  , im not exaggerating but i wish upper management starts to do something about this or else they will lose more customers ... Never coming back again well at least for a good while . Ps , ( some customers left without paying , which i think is wrong but due to their slow and bad customer service is bound to happen )"
Jackie F.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,2,1.0,2/25/2015,"Love the environment but we sat for 56 minutes waiting for our order tonight. If you are hungry and don't have a few hours on your hands, do not come here. It was ridiculous and we were never told that the kitchen was slow or apologized to for the wait. It wasn't even like we had complex orders. We were then apologized to and they said they would have it right up. 20 minutes past and so we left."
