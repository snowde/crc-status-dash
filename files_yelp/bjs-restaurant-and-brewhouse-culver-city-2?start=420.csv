Alexis B.,"Cerritos, CA",50,58,386,2.0,6/1/2015,"My boyfriend lives in the area so we end up coming to this BJs location just because it's the only one in the vicinity but our experiences are always either hit or way bad miss.   Maybe part of the problem on this visit was that we came on a Saturday night so it was obviously really busy.  The waiting to get seated part wasn't the problem.  We got seated at a single's booth which was great but the table that we sat at had a drop of water on the table which I noticed when I sat down but just thought 'oh yeah of course they wipe down the tables between customers' but as I was going over the menu I felt a drop of water on my arm.  I wasn't sure what was happening but ignored it until a few minutes later my boyfriend noticed another drop of water hit our table.  We were seated right under the air conditioning pipes (not the actual opening) and figured the coolant was leaking through somehow.  I understood the restaurant was busy and the water only dropped every 15 minutes so I resolved to just move my plate over if my food came.  Out of courtesy we alerted our server (I think his name was Mike) and he said he would figure out what was going on upstairs at Old Navy (-_-) but he never came back and didn't really mention it again.  He was an ok server but seemed very distracted while he was with us--like he was always trying to move on to the next thing.  I didn't really feel like he cared about our dining experience but it was busy so I tried not to care.  But when our food finally came out and he set my boyfriend's burger down and my salmon quinoa bowl and walked away I was a little miffed since we didn't have silverware.  I started just picking out the asparagus with my fingers and eating them until he managed to bring some over (we had to ask as he was zooming past our table).  At this point I was annoyed but still willing to give this location the benefit of the doubt but when I rolled out my silverware from the napkins and saw some dried piece of white food stuck to the fork I was pretty much done.  The rest of the meal proceeded painfully slow and all we wanted to do was get out.  The food was sub-par, the french fries were the only saving grace (which had to come out separately than the burger but at least they were hot).  As far as the new salmon quinoa bowl went, I wish I had stuck with my usual cherry chipotle salmon.  We were so done with BJs that we didn't even order a pizzookie which is usually the primary reason we go there.  We are generally a big fan and supporter of BJs.  There's one in my town that we haven't had problems with but this one has been a bit of a struggle."
Kiani J.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,2,,1.0,11/26/2015,"I do not recommend anybody EVER coming to this location. The staff did not seem to take their job serious, poor service, had to ask for table to be cleared, and for refills on drinks. Spoke with manager Ryan who lacked managerial skills ."
Jennifer I.,"Lake Balboa, Los Angeles, CA",83,49,230,4.0,4/11/2016,"I have always liked to go to BJ's but unfortunately my boyfriend does not so we rarely ever go there.  On yelp I saw they are $10 off a $35 food purchase so we ordered jambalaya and the (blackened shrimp) Santa Fe salad to go.  When I called to place the order the girl on the phone wasn't very helpful and seemed irritated that I mentioned this to Shaw. First she tried to tell me it was expired and then she said I can only use it if I was a rewards member, neither of those were true.  When I came to pick up the food she made me fill out the rewards membership, which I didn't mind to do but she made it seem like I had to do it for the discount, which again was not true.  I got back to the house and we didn't get any utensils, the jambalaya looked like a child size portion and my salad was ALL lettuce & missing onion strings.  Some of this isn't really that big of a deal but it's a combination of it all that was irritating. I decided to call Felix the manager at BJ's a few days later and nicely explained to him the experience I had. He was nice enough to comp us a free lunch.  I was appreciative of his high-level customer service skills and that I didn't have to be a b*tch to get compensation.  Looking forward to eating there again soon."
Breezy Z.,"San Diego, CA",0,55,,5.0,5/17/2016,Kandace was amazing--she went above and beyond to make sure I had everything I needed and that I was happy with my meal. She really deserves some recognition!
Big B.,"Hollywood, CA",2,37,2,2.0,9/13/2014,"Mall food with lacking service and a nice selection of drafts.  What more to say other than a few random observations? The front door staff seemed more like a confused circle jerk than a hospitality service.   The table service was pleasant enough but rather slow and uneven.  Wrong appetizer came out, was sent back, entrees arrived immediately thereafter (delivered by food runner), correct appetizer eventually arrives.  Then for desert, 4-ever to clear the table and get the check. This is where you go to work when you can't cut it at Mickey D's. Food was passable but nothing to rave about.  And a bit pricey for the teeny portions. Party next to us had a Chihuahua at the table."
Tessani T.,"Long Beach, CA",10,22,,5.0,9/9/2015,"Currently still in the restaurant. Jake our server is giving us really good service. He is very helpful, accurate, and its great that he has a great smile with a winning personality and he was kind enough to adjust the cool air flow around us. I'd say ask to be served by Jake every single time I come in. I will visit this restaurant again."
Rashida C.,"Los Angeles, CA",241,21,9,5.0,3/7/2014,I love it here.. Great food... Good service... And I can go shopping afterward because it's apart of the Fox hills Mall
Temenah C.,"Anaheim, CA",393,1040,3,3.0,10/23/2012,"We came here after a wedding because our hotel was literally right next door. I used to love BJ's. I thought the pizza was amazing, the beer was pretty good, and don't even get me started on the awesomeness of the pizookie. No one does a pizookie like BJ's.  I think things went a little south for me because competition just got a little too stiff. All of a sudden there were billions of other places that had awesome pizza and great, not just good, beer. So, I have to admit, it's been awhile since I've ventured into a BJ's. I was quite pleased on my recent visit. Although we just ordered drinks, I was shocked and happy to see their good selection of craft beers. They have Bear Republic, Green Flash, and Stone to name a fiew. They even had a good lineup of Belgians (Hoegaarden, Duvel, etc). Knowing that, I might have been too hard on this old standby. I might have to try this place out all over again."
Jamila H.,"Venice, CA",1,14,7,4.0,10/5/2014,"All the football games are on, it's happy hour slash brunch, and our server was a total sweetheart. Happy Sunday!"
Courtney K.,"Laguna Hills, CA",325,116,86,4.0,3/31/2015,Michael treated us right! We came during playoffs  (March madness) on a Sunday. It was pretty busy too. We ordered 3 courses & lots of drinks. We asked lots of questions too! He answered all of them & would always get us whatever we ordered asap! Food was yummy atmosphere was good (great people watching) & my drinks were strong!
Maribel G.,"Los Angeles, CA",32,20,5,4.0,3/17/2015,Had dinner with the husband around midnight still open.. Our waiter was good check in with us every 10 min that was nice not everyone does that.. The food was good love the sirloan the meat was nice and juicy..
Travis M.,"Kansas City, MO",6,16,2,1.0,3/31/2015,The food was below average and the drinks were very poor quality.  8 people in our group and everyone's shared the same experience.  Save the trip and go somewhere else.
Char J.,"Long Beach, CA",6,67,2,3.0,3/19/2014,"The floors are an ass buster waiting to happen.  I have resulted to considering my shoe selection when we plan to eat here.  If you are wearing heels, proceed with caution.   I have come here a couple of times with friends and family and they do alright.  I like that it's close to the freeway.   The food is okay, the drinks are okay and the service is decent.  I'm just in the middle on this one.   Nicked a star because of the slippery ass floors."
Rob P.,"San Diego, CA",1805,2099,833,4.0,1/22/2012,"I really, really wanted to hate on BJ's when my friends said that we should meet there.  One of them had never been, so she wanted to give it a try.  I hate chains, but BJ's not the worst chain (I think that's TGI Friday's), so I did it. Had a chopped chicken salad that was really, really good.  Also had some of my friend's avocado eggrolls, which were just OK but were made awesome with the dipping sauce.  Kind of weird that my friend couldn't get a Red Bull & vodka (they don't carry Red Bull).  Ahhh chains. Remembered I had a free pazookie coupon in my car and we just devoured that delicious thing.  Ugh, left there so full. No, you're right, none of us got the pizza.  Hmm."
Emily S.,"Dayton, OH",1854,2249,4775,3.0,10/28/2009,"Second or third time going to a BJ's it was not that bad.  The restaurant was pretty busy for a late sunday afternoon.  They only make reservations for parties of 10 or more.  If you have less than that, you may call 30 mins ahead of time to get on the waitlist. I ordered the California Club Flatbread Pizza.  It came with grilled chicken, crisp Applewood smoked bacon, tomatoes and mozzarella cheese. Drizzled with roasted garlic aioli and topped with fresh diced avocado.  Our table also had the Avocado Egg Rolls, Chicken Lettuce Wraps, and Spinach & Artichoke Dip.   My flatbread pizza was pretty good.  I liked it.. but there was A lot.  I gave away four slices. I looked at the menu later.  Each slice was 100 or so calories! I think I may have eaten 5 or 6 slices. These were small 1.5 inch slices though... not regular sized pizza slices. The Avocado Egg rolls were okay.  A little spicy.  I wouldn't get it again.  The Spinach Artichoke Dip was average.  It tasted like any other dip.  It was good.. but it was also good in a bad way.   The Chicken Lettuce wraps were okay."
Eric F.,"San Leandro, CA",743,2526,266,3.0,2/9/2014,"All the usual offerings one would expect with any BJ's.  I can at least speak for the quality of the staff at the bar as they did a great job taking care of my drinks.  I don't know about the servers for the tables, but one can at least rest assured the bar experience will be fine."
Tiffany M.,"Inglewood, CA",59,4,28,4.0,7/28/2014,I am so grateful for Nick The Bartender!!!! He made me the best Strawberry Martini ever!!!! The Jambalya was bomb!!!!! Thanks BJ's!!!!
Beatrix K.,"Culver City, CA",38,10,5,1.0,5/5/2014,"Worst service ever, will never go back. I asked the manager if this was how his waiters usually behaved, and he paused and said, Yes. I couldn't believe it, my friends and I, immediately burst into laughter. The only pro, is that the manager comp'd our entrees. Language barrier or honest answer?"
Lauren O.,"San Fernando Valley, CA",169,567,76,2.0,2/23/2012,"Meh.... I've been to the location of BJ's  in Westwood also and to me the food was about the same--nothing to write home about. I have come to the conclusion that the best thing is their pizzookie which is a freshly baked cookie with ice cream. On the positive side,  the service was spot on tonight, so we were appreciative of that.  Meh, I will pass on this place next time"
Michael C.,"Castaic, CA",357,66,2,1.0,6/23/2015,"Didn't really have a good experience here. As soon as I got here we were put on the list only to be forgotten about as we waited and saw people who came be seated right away. We talked to the guy up front and he has seated us three minutes later and we waited a total 20 minutes. The place we were sat at was extremely cold to the point I was grabbing my arms. The food was pretty good although I think the burger was a bit small. As fast as the waiter had delivered our food, the food tasted like it was sitting for a while as if someone else had ordered it thirty minutes before and left and it was given to us. It tasted good but it was not really fresh out the oven in terms of how hot the food was. We were also given a empty ketchup bottle by our waiter, come on now! Hopefully my next visit will be better."
