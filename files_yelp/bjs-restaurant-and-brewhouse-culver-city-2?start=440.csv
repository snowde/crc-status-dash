Amora G.,"Harbor Gateway, Los Angeles, CA",568,15,5,5.0,6/8/2014,"This place is great so get here before the rush, but still 100% worth the short wait. The mall being right here is a huge plus. Today was my first time coming since they started brunch. I'm not usually fond of Bloody Marys but this was heavenly! The kick and fresh garden pepper garnish yet another plus. My friend got the Jeremiah Red. I ordered from the brunch menu and the service was great from beginning to end. Waitress (cant remember her name but its similar to Judy/Jedi) was kind, quick and proactive- plus, plus, plus. I had an issue with my food being over done, and without hesitation, the big boss, Marcos (not sure if he's the Manager, Chef, Franchise owner, etc. but he came out in a chefs jacket and took PRIDE in fixing the situation to my liking and even offered us a free dessert even though he didn't have to! I must note that being nice and respecting others even when my food isnt up to par will 9 times out of 10 get the problem fixed for you. Something to think about. Thanks BJs... I'll be coming back :) Overall, I"
Ashley P.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,2,,1.0,4/1/2015,"Very slow service. Arrived at 8:00 pm, seated at 8:15, didn't get food until 9:40 pm, which was cold and not made to order."
La Toya T.,"Hawthorne, CA",9,19,,1.0,4/2/2016,"The worse place to go.........Me and my family came to this BJ after leaving a wonderful day at Universal Studios. Mind you I stay near Torrance and NEVER had a issue with the one in Torrance. My party ordered half boneless buffalo wings and the other half plain(fried) as a appetizer. The buffalo wings were  cold like the sauce was cold. Our food arrived after. My nephew kids pizza was hard as a brick and my daughter chicken Alfredo was slopped on her plate like whatever. No presentation at all.......my pizza came and it was under cooked. The bottom of the pizza was white....the plain wings I ordered was buffalo and I told the waitress the first time, ""PLAIN"".........she came back with the chicken but more coated and darker. I told her for the third time plain. Maybe I said plain buffalo wings. That may have caused the confusion. My family heard plain........My sister asked to speak with the manager who really doesn't present himself as a manager.....more like the bus boy......that moved up and it was his first day or a filler in because the real manager called out. He was unapologetic as a manager shouldn't be. I'm sorry that happened to you......what can I do to make this experience better. NONE of that flowed from his mouth. He brought back the pizza and wings and asked how does it taste and I said it SEEMS cooked and I tasted a bite and it was ok but after eating the slice of pizza......it tasted like a box pizza that still was doughy on top like a box pizza. He walked away........no thought into what discount was going to take place. He then came back as I summoned him and explained that I was disappointed in the service and that the only people in my party that had to wait for their food was my daughter and I. I explained that I don't come to this BJ and only came because we were passing this one from a joyous time at Universal Studios. He said ok......I said I normally go to Torrance because I stay out there. He then went to say I stay in Torrance and what part of Torrance do you live. I took that as being sarcastic and told him i stay in Hawthorne.....He then said ok. Unapologetic he was........I asked what type of discount was he going to give us for being inconvenience and he said he is going to pay for the Chicken Alfredo and Pizza. I was ok with that BUT had he been a BETTER manager fill in (I think). I would've probably came back. Not as much but I would've came back.......maybe once to see how the new experience would be. Since that didn't happen.......I'll use my hard earned money elsewhere. One more thing.......don't let the curly out of whack hair full you because IM SURE my pay check will make your eye BUCK Mr. Manager!!!!!! One more thing to add......the plates that they brought for the appetizers were dirty. Chopped green onions and etc......Another thing......I get it was a Friday night and it was busy......that's when your servers give their A game to friendliness and hot GREAT FOOD!!!!!!"
Claudia P.,"Santa Monica, Los Angeles, CA",57,17,10,4.0,6/21/2014,We enjoy coming here. There is normally a long wait but we know this ahead so it doesn't bother us to much. The service is good most of the time.  We like the food and the various selection of beers. Of course my kids love the Pazooki's
Amit O.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,59,4,1.0,3/15/2015,"Worst service ever. Had to wait at the reception to get seated while the receptionist was busy talking to the servers. That's not it, had to wait another 15 minutes for someone to ask for water and another 30 minutes to finally get a drink. The service was horrible. Would not recommend this place to anyone"
Elsy Q.,"Los Angeles, CA",44,28,2,2.0,3/20/2015,"The pizza is luke warm as usual. The sevice is mediocre, we didnt get plates for the pizza. The food and the price big thumbs down"
Steve C.,"Torrance, CA",39,2,,1.0,7/31/2015,"Come here if you like terrible service and food: missing items from your order, waiting 45 minutes for your food, and being ignored by the waiters.  I keep coming back because i love disappointment."
Douglas M.,"Los Angeles, CA",116,157,104,2.0,9/4/2013,"The worst BJ's I have been to. What do I mean by worst? Take your pick! Terrible food, service, experience and crowd. I would come back for happy hour only."
Chelsea R.,"Rialto, CA",56,1,,1.0,4/21/2016,We go to BJ's all the time on different occasions and have always had great service and never had any issuses but tonight was horrible. We came for my friend's birthday dinner and there was a large party and that fine as everyone started to leave here and there her uncle who is mentally disabled just stood against the pillar next to our table and watched the game as the rest of us sat there talking. The Manager Felix processed to walk up to her uncle and ask him questions and he got nervous and ran to the patio section of the restaurant. Felix then tried to run after him and we all told him to leave him alone and sent his sister after him to calm him down. There were 5 of us all letting him know that we had it under control and he would make it worse. Felix then said Okay but went around to a different door to enter the patio where they were. The Uncle came back to us while his sister was trying to tell the manager to leave him and explain his condition then another manager processed to our table. He asked us if he was with us and we all told him (6 adults) that he was with us and that he has a mental health issue and we are taking care of it and that strangers would make the situation worse. By this time the uncle had gone back into the patio area and the new manager then went out there to check it out. 1) He was not a danger to anyone. 2)He had been there with us over 2 hours quietly eating his food and when he was done he stood there quietly and watched tv. 3) It was embarrassing for our family for the manager to make a bigger stink about it then needed. Have they not dealt with someone with issuses or what? He had been there with us since we got there and we spent 300+ dollars on our bill and for us to walk out unhappy and embarrassed is ridiculous. 4) Your staff especially the manager should know how to deal with situations like these. I could understand if it was someone that randomly walked in but He had been there and we confirmed that he was with us.
S C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,102,35,3.0,3/6/2015,"the food.... A+++ the service F----- service is so bad sometimes.. I keep coming back because the food is delicious but every time, they never fail to make something go wrong. This location is convenient for me so I keep coming. Definitely need some improvements though."
Jen W.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,25,17,4.0,5/23/2014,Came for lunch. Can't beat all you can eat soup and salad for under $8. Plus with all the choices you can't go wrong.  Service was good today too! Come for the lunch specials!!!
Jeanette J.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,41,51,1.0,2/15/2015,Horrible service and follow up by manager who had an attitude. Not even worth one star tonight. Horrific dining experience.
Danielle M.,"Los Angeles, CA",697,664,403,4.0,4/17/2014,Service is fast and friendly for lunch. You can normally get in and out of here in less than an hour. The lunch specials are great. It's nice to have a small individual pizza and salad. Both were really good. I still miss the pans the pizza comes in though. They get so soggy so quick.
Armida L.,"Los Angeles, CA",36,8,2,5.0,8/19/2015,We just had a 35 office party there and the staff and managers and food was great!!! Thank you BJs for having the food ready and hot on time!!!
Stephanie R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,1.0,2/7/2016,Went to bjs today because i was hungry. They took us to our table and the waitress did not help us at all. 20 minutes passed by. Ive noticed her looking at us and walking away. I understand its busy but at least let me know you'll be with us in a second. I sat in the right section once you come in the door. That bimbo could of cracked a smile like she meant it. Ive been coming to bjs for so many years and was excited when they opened one near my home but after this experience Im not sure i would come back. The manager should really train there employees well.
Miguel A.,"Santa Monica, CA",14,62,117,5.0,2/7/2015,Great beer selection. Great food selection. Oh and did I mention the free wifi. I recommend the great white pizza and a nutty brunette beer for those over 21 year of age.
Leidy S.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,96,1,5.0,2/14/2015,"I was a bit hesitant to dine here since the reviews are not that good, but we still decided to eat dinner here the other night. We ordered appetizers as our food of choice, we got the wings, santa fe rolls, carnitas fries and sliders with fries. Our waiter Mike was attentive and would check on us even though it was busy. Every thing we ordered was delicious even though i would have liked my wings to be coated in the sauce not just drizzled. I was hoping i would have had room to try a pizookie but I couldnt fit anything else in my belly!!!! Maybe next time."
Justin H.,"Los Angeles, CA",57,29,14,2.0,8/12/2013,"located in Westfield mall, there's a bunch of parking surrounding the restaurant, that can get really crowded on weekends. I guess I came on the wrong night, but the service was really lacking.  This was my first time here, recommended by my friend.  it seems like a really popular place, we waited about 30 min to get a table for 4 on a friday night.  we got seated and placed our orders in. but that was the last we ever saw of our waitress.  our waters did not get filled, the ketchup we asked for never came.  Not to mention a buss boy spilled his tray of dishes onto my friend.  I know this wasn't his fault, however, the way he handled it was terrible.  Rather than offer a towel FIRST to dry off the customer, he attempted to clean up the dishes before his boss could see that it happened. Bringing up the service at the end of the meal with the manager, he asked if there was anything he could do and said that he could pay for HALF of our pizookie.  This was kind of a slap in the face, as he could not even offer to cover the whole thing after all that had happened. Service: 1 star Overall: 2 stars, won't be coming back, if it wasn't for the service I'd probably come back here again bc the food wasn't that bad.  My friends got the pizza, I had the fish tacos, 3-3.5 stars for the food alone."
Mitchell F.,"Woodland Hills, CA",2,33,2,5.0,7/15/2015,"They made us wait 20-30 min, but whatever, it was worth the wait . It was my first time eating here, my bf decided to bring me here , was a bit worried about the food,  ordered a blt  sandwich  it was the shit lol also for my princess  we did a deep dished pepperoni pizza it was good as well my princess didn't want to leave they gave her a coloring menu while we waited for the food,  it took a while for the food but it was good  most  def. Will be back,  a bit too crouded  for my taste but worth it for the food,  every one was pretty nice as  well just sucked having to wait so long not a fan of the door, how it rolls in like old school  hotel lol"
Quisha H.,"Palms, Los Angeles, CA",452,528,935,3.0,7/5/2010,"I love Bjs for drinks and dessert (as said in my review of the torrance location). But this particular location is very hit or miss. Sometimes the service is quick, efficient, and attentive. Unfortunately its mostly slow and not very helpful :/ It also gets a little...""hood"" (sorry I had no better description)  and crowded towards the evening. Parking is also a beast because of all the new develpment in the mall. So be prepared to park further away and do some walking. I prefer not to come to this location but if I'm in the area it will do."
