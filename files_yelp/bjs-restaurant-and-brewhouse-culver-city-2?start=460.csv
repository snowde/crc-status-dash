Charles C.,"Los Angeles, CA",57,48,,3.0,5/7/2014,"This was our first visit to this BJ's although my family has eaten there before in a different city. On this occasion, service from our waitress wasn't the best as we had to wait close to an hour to get served. (Tick, tock.....) Now I'll slide and recognize because it was Sunday, business might be busier than usual, but almost an hour wait? Not cool. When it came time for our orders, our waitress who apparently felt stressed the whole time she approached our table, almost missed a order request from one member of our party and when it came time for our food to be served, another member was given a different meal than what they had selected. So on the service side, it could have been better. A whole lot better. Of course, that's not to take away the quality food BJ serves. It was lunchtime so I had a nice sampling of one of their sandwiches. Their burgers are pretty awesome too, if your stomach can hold out after a long wait. They have an outstanding menu and even though our visit wasn't so great, the meals we ate definitely deserve an A+ each and every time. What I also like about this particular location is that while it's close to the mall, parking wasn't that bad and once you get inside, they have huge screens all around. Just enough to have an excuse for a night out with the guys. So while the menu and dishes were top notch, I hope service definitely improves or it'll be hard to find reasons to show up, and our family loves this place too. I hope on our next visit, we'll have a different result."
Dave W.,"Los Angeles, CA",189,213,44,1.0,10/7/2013,"Went back with the in-laws. We waited 30 minutes for a table at 6:00 pm on Saturday, when there were 20 open tables (4 needing bussed, 4 just open, and 12 together seemingly due to understaffing). That excludes the patio, which I didn't peruse.   Balsamic Chicken Salad was drowning, and the bottom of the chicken had been burned. Their beer is good, however, the advertised master brews were not actually stocked."
Drew B.,"Culver City, CA",363,615,485,1.0,8/10/2011,"3 Strikes and you're OUT!!! Ordered a well done pie to go because when it opened the place was a zoo. Got it home and it was underbaked and raw doughy. Raw pizza dough gross. Wife tooke it back and the Manager couldn't seem to care less. No hook up no apologies just a refund. Went on a school fundraiser night. Waited 30+ minutes w/ all the kids. No problem. Then waited 30 more to get some drinks. Manager came by poured two people extra wine for the tardiness, but what about the other ten people. Clue!? Last time pizza came and was underdone again. Hey BJs turn up your oven or slow down the conveyor or get a new chef or jump in a lake. Have always loved their pizza and enjoyed the beer. NEVER again."
Kieanitria P.,"Inglewood, CA",39,28,2,2.0,2/17/2015,"BJ's needs to work on their customer service. I placed a catering order (for 25 ppl) the morning of the event. Placing the order over the phone was easy and I appreciated the fact that I was told that the sides were small.  I arrived 15 minutes after my scheduled p/u time. The greeters at the front were awful. And one kept interrupting the guy that was gathering and packing my order. It seemed to be a disorganized mess. Phones were ringing, they were taking walk in orders in spite of me waiting for my pre order. The manager did come out to help pack my order and help me to the car.  While I'm not a fan of chain restaurant food, party goers did like the food, hence the two stars."
Rochelle D.,"Bellflower, CA",68,14,,1.0,6/7/2015,This was the worse experience I've had at BJ. The General Manager Eugene Ochoa wasn't good either and our Waitress Briana had the worse attitude and she needs to be fired on the spot. It was my sisters birthday get together and everything from the start was. We had a party of 15 and only one person helped us my husband and mother didn't get their food in time so they canceled their orders. I had to give them a 1 star but if I could I would have given them nothing
Maricel J.,"Los Angeles, CA",322,446,1323,3.0,6/11/2012,came here for early dinner and to watch the nba finals. got seated right away...-server was very friendly.... BUT our order took forever to come!--and they had our appetizers wrong...so waited longer... i think this was the LONGEST i ever waited on my food to come... been to ther Bj's...---this was the slowest service ever!
Daryl W.,"Los Angeles, CA",200,249,19,2.0,3/23/2014,"I only come BJ's for the Pizookie and sometimes they can't even get that right. The hostesses leave a lot to be desired. I think it's a tough job herding all of those people that show up, but they seem ill equipped and even worst with their presentation. The servers and bartenders were pretty great, but again my pizookie was lacking. Tried BJ's brewed beer, just ok. All in all, I'd agree with a previous reviewer, if you really want this experience, and with a slightly tamer crowd, go to Yard House."
Ivy M.,"Los Angeles, CA",54,157,310,3.0,4/20/2014,"My friend and I meet up every so often to catch up over lunch and we almost always meet up at BJ's. Service was sort of a hit/miss, I say this because the first time we had very courteous servers, while the second time when we asked to be reseated in a booth with less air conditioning, we were met with sass from the hostess and a waitress who seemed to be overwhelmed with tables (this may not have necessarily been her fault, but we're still patrons too) Despite this, the food has been consistently good.  The first time I had the roasted vegetable and goat cheese flatbread pizza with a salad, while the second time around I had the stuffed potato with the salad (and the gluten free chocolate chip 'pizookie' for dessert which was quite delightful ^_^) I resisted the temptation of trying the booze in the presence of my friend (she's just a minute or two shy from being legal lol) but I may consider trying the Long Island Iced Tea on my own time."
Mia A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,1,1.0,8/25/2014,"Horrible. There was a gnat in my water my first visit. Waiter forgot half of my order second visit. Plenty of my friends inc. Myself have gotten free meals from corporate due to a less than decent dining experience. If you want bj's, travel to Westwood!"
Jay T.,"Irvine, CA",132,382,56,2.0,5/17/2012,"For some reason, the pizza always tastes better at the Westwood location. I did notice it was much better when I reheated it in the stove the next day. When my family was visiting we came here. There was some kind of mix-up with the bill, so the server took it back and charged us again, properly. My mother (who was dealing with the bill), asked for the voided original receipt, and the waiter couldn't figure out how to do it. So the manager came over and dealt with it, assuring her that the first charge was voided. A few weeks later, the credit card statement came. And there were two charges. So she had to call them. And deal with it again."
KaThy T.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1194,1121,102,5.0,12/17/2014,"Since I have to watch what I am eating for the next month, I opted for the Bison Burger.  I know, it's not that healthy, but it was healthier than the other options.  My friend got the Mahi Mahi with the rice and veggies.  She also ordered the calamari.  I got to sample both her dishes, which were good.  Mine was good as well.  It burger was served on wheat buns with a side of salad which kind of tasted like cole slaw.  Everything was great; we were stuffed to the max.  And we had a pretty cool server who was on top of things during the crowded night we came."
Rey L.,"El Segundo, CA",120,851,1991,3.0,11/16/2009,"I'm always confused when my waiter does not write our order down. I don't know if I should be impressed or concerned. We're not picky orderers, necessarily.  Here's the order... hers - Grilled Chicken sandwich, no mayo, side salad, ranch on the side, thin cut fries... mine - BJ burger, medium, with onions, steak fries, side of mayo, buffalo sauce and bbq (we like dipping sauces for fries). Now, our waiter read all that back to us perfectly without writing anything down, and it didn't appear too convoluted to us.  The sandwich and burger came first with the food runner. We both got thin cut fries. Not as hot as it should've been. No salad for the gf. No onions on my burger. No sauces. No offer for a water order. Luckily no mayo on the chicken. Waited a couple mins and signalled the waiter. I didn't bother asking for the steak fries or onions, but just politely asked for the sauces and the salad. The waiter happily obliged and brought it out expeditiously. He did appear sincere with his concern with why our order didn't come out as we expected.  Now, I will add that this was a sunday afternoon, at the mall. So, I expected it to be busy and we're not uptight about these sorts of things. We got sat pretty fast. The remainder of the meal went off without a hitch. I do have to add, with some hesitation, that the manager came around to a couple tables to appease some unhappy patrons. I will clarify that they had shopping bags and kids so I'm sure the adults were already on edge from coming through the mall to go eat.  I was torn between giving this place 2 or 3 stars. I guess I just don't want some kid to have to be laid off for something that perhaps wasn't his fault. So, I gave it 3. Take it with a grain of salt."
Robert C.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,18,,3.0,7/1/2013,"Well, let's just say there's not much to get excited about here.  With several TV monitors, maybe it works as a Sports Bar (you could be horrible at that and yet still beat out downtown Hooters).  The food's nothing special, but not terrible.  BBQ Seafood or BBQ Chicken are decent choices.  Steamed Veggies are weak - limp, lots of soft squash.  Pizza looked good at another table. Have had no problem with the wait time - usually 5-15 minutes on Sunday early evening - but we are a twosome, and the place is huge.  Their house made beer is just ok - again nothing to be excited about.  To sum it up, this place isn't special, but you won't be highly disappointed if you happen to end up here. Unfortunately, service varies - there are a couple of really good waiters here, and then there's the rest.  We always ask to be seated with...hey wait, if I tell you, you'll have your behind in my seat!"
Eddie O.,"Los Angeles, CA",22,4,2,5.0,3/27/2016,"I decided to come in today on a holiday, wasn't sure if they would be open since the mall is close. But to my luck they were. We waited 15 minutes to get seated. It wasn't a big deal since they were busy. We got our drinks, our food and everything was good. Unfortunately half way thru my cadillac margarita I notice that there was lipstick in the rim of the glass. I was a bit disgusted so I ask for the manager. Luis came over I explain our dilemma. He was really apologetic he offer a new drink but I just wasn't feeling it. He offer other drinks from the bar that sounded good but after the lipstick I didn't want any. He was so friendly he talk us into a pissukey(I think that's how you spell it).. the caramel one was really good I think I'm hook on it. Luis kept checking on us to make sure everything was good til the moment we left. Luis the manager and Teresa the server were great. Thanks for the great experience even after a bump in it... see you next time Teresa good luck..."
Frank Y.,"Culver City, CA",6,58,45,4.0,12/8/2014,"Checking the pizza out here ! The waiter service was good here, the deep dish pizza was okay, just to much dough for me. The Clam Chowder wasn't hot enough."
Jason B.,"Culver City, CA",0,3,,1.0,2/25/2015,Waited so long for my food that I gave up and left.  Waiting an hour for your food is ridiculous.
Anaher B.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,148,,3.0,5/11/2015,"Came here with a friend, food was okay decent. I probably wouldn't go here often just not my type of scene or menu I suppose. Service was okay, the lady was a little rude but otherwise it was decent."
Dee M.,"Marina del Rey, CA",0,3,,4.0,7/1/2015,"I Love, love, love  their Jambalaya. My favorite is the carrot cake cheesecake....the only reason to go off my diet!"
michael b.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",1,9,,5.0,6/29/2015,"Ate lunch at BJ's over the weekend, the food was good, the service was good and the management comped the meal for me and my Make A Wish family--6 of us total after our day-long shopping spree.  We didn't even have the chance to ask for a discount!  Kudos to this location for being so kind and generous and we definitely recommend!!"
Mahogany C.,"Arleta, CA",278,134,253,4.0,8/4/2013,"Great service!  Came here late on a Friday night. This place was filled with lots of patrons but not too crowded. Appetizers and food came out in a timely manner. Our waitress (I think her name was April) was extremely personable and attentive. She ended up with a 30% tip. Which says a heck of a lot these days.  I gave 4 stars because my beer had tiny bug in it (ugh!).....but  once I brought it to her attention, she quickly brought out another .... no muss no fuss I love this location"
