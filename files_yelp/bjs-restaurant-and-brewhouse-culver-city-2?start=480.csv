Anjelica A.,"Long Beach, CA",127,300,469,2.0,5/20/2013,"I love BJ's in general, but this location in particular is lacking in service and quality.  I feel like the Torrance and Cerritos locations have more professional staff and better food.  Came here last night for dinner. We walked up to the hostess stand, and there were 3 employees talking to each other and another customer for a long time. The party in front of us stood there awkwardly waiting to be acknowledged.  Once the hostess finally greeted us and took our names, we all waited about 10 minutes, and then they tried to seat us before the party in front of us. They mixed up both of our parties' names and there was confusion all around.  Did I detect a sharp note in the hostess's voice directed toward us after I corrected her pronunciation of my name? I don't think I imagined that. We were finally seated and our waiter was Sayeed (sp?). My BF ordered the Bold and Amber taster set of beers and the bacon cheeseburger with a garden salad. I ordered the black cherry soda and the build-your-own hand-tossed pizza with pepperoni, meatballs, mushrooms, and roasted garlic, with a Caesar salad. After I ordered my pizza, the waiter abruptly walked away from the table; I had to call after him that I wanted to include a salad too. Also, he didn't ask my boyfriend what kind of French fries he wanted with his burger. The waiter ended up bringing him the Pale and Hoppy taster set, which was not what he had ordered. Also, I think BJ's has changed the recipe for the black cherry soda -- it used to be served in a chilled mug and the flavors of cherry and vanilla really popped in your mouth; last night it was served in a regular class and tasted watery and flat.  My boyfriend's burger came with shoestring French fries instead of wedge, and my pizza crust was overly toasted around the edges but soggy in the middle.   Since we were seated so close to the hostess stand, I could see the employees gossiping there (or at least it looked like that's what they were doing). I'm not against having fun at work, but at one point, It appeared that they were talking trash about another waitress and flirting with a male employee.  The mediocre food, unprofessional staff, and order mix-ups all added up to make it a disappointing Sunday dinner."
M R.,"Culver City, CA",11,140,50,5.0,8/9/2013,"Went back as we had a class across the street it was 5.00 pm so not busy place looked cleaner, Great Server,Oscar made sure we had top notch service.  Food was ok. Salmon Moroccan style was Meh!!  Pizza  was puffy like a doughnut . cheese was a bit funky if it was not straight Mozzarella.  Menus need to be loved  they were sticky. Improved since last visit."
Kristen D.,"Santa Monica, CA",6,10,,1.0,6/20/2015,"Every time I come to this restaurant I get the WORST service. Not only do I have to wait over 2 hours to be served, but the waiters are ALWAYS horrible. They can't seem to refill drinks or check on the tables they wait on. The food is never worth the wait here, ever. If I could give this place 0 stars I would. Manager was unimpressive as well. Absolutely horrible service."
Rickesha M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/16/2015,"I freakin hate this location, everytime I try to give them a chance, they show their behinds. The service is extremely poor, I haven't met a waiter with decent Customer Service skills yet. I take forever to take your order, even if you already know what you want. Tonight's waitress brought our drinks, and then told us to hold on while she turned to the have a coversation with the table across from us (they were seated after us), and then when she finished I tried to get her attention to remind her that we were ready to order, she then againg told us to wait and walked away. This place is all about making you wait til you lose your appetite."
Gabriel C.,"Inglewood, CA",6,17,,2.0,1/2/2015,"Poor service. Went during happy hour, waited 15 min just to get our tabel cleaned and another 20 just to get our drinks and appatizers. They should get more waiters. I don't like to wait that long"
Amir D.,"Culver City, CA",111,271,1,4.0,7/24/2013,"Some of these reviews are so ridiculous. You are at a place that specializes in beer and pizza. Why in the fuck would you get Jambalaya they don't specialize in that? If you want Jamabalaya go to a Creole joint for the authentic stuff. With that being said get the Mediterranean Pizza you cannot go wrong. Plus get the Avocado Egg Rolls off the hizzooook. And if you are truly feeling like a fattie get the Pizookie. Wit that being enjoy some dark brews, watch the game and all the food snobs should just go to  the Hipster joints and have kale chips and sandwiches on brioche buns."
Christy G.,"Paramount, CA",105,2,,1.0,12/27/2014,"The service is terrible and the manager was no help. Switched our drinks after refills, we had to wait a while after our meal for silverware,  they took us to seating that was not available so we had to back to the waiting area.. And they didn't compensate for the trouble"
Lanie G.,"Los Angeles, CA",74,9,22,3.0,3/23/2015,"Very good happy hour and late night happy hour. Not always the best service. Food never disappoints. Huge portions. Make sure to call and reserve a table for big groups or special occasions, as the wait can be pretty long at times."
Lisa W.,"Los Angeles, CA",43,82,16,2.0,5/29/2013,"Run of a mill restaurant chain located in a parking-challenged mall.  Now that this restaurant chain has published calories next to its entrees, it take the fun out of grabbing a beer, some fried appetizers, and some pizza.  It's a heart attack waiting to happen! For those who can look past the calories (e.g. marathon runners or triathletes), there's a great all-American variety of food, including their fabulous pizza and comprehensive list of beers.   Food is good for restaurant-chain type of food.  Waiters, on the other hand, are always seem to be challenged, and service suffers.  Never know where they disappear..."
Nicole B.,"Santa Monica, CA",723,576,391,2.0,2/20/2012,"While the staff here is great, my food is never on point at this location! My drinks were gross AND my pazookie was as hard as wood.... avoid this location especially because parking is horrribleee."
Cheryl N.,"Los Angeles, CA",57,16,8,2.0,7/24/2013,"I like Bj's food which is why I keep coming back. Unfortunately since this place opened a couple of years ago I have to say that the service has always been lacking. From the excessive waiting time for the food to arrive to the staff not being knowledgeable about the menu.  I was here recently and our order was messed up, and my friend ended up waiting an extra 45 minutes for her food to arrive. By then the rest of us had finished our meals. The waiter was very nice and apologetic, but then we received our bill and the wrong item was still on the bill, and we had to wait an extra 30 minutes to gt the correct bill, and get our change to leave. He did not een comp us anything, not that we were expecting it, but it would have been nice.  For a place that it always busy, I would just think that they would have more staff helping wait tables, and more staff in general to help out. I will not be returning for a long time.  On a side note, although our waiter was very nice, the guy who brought out our food was not nice at all. He made faces when we asked for extra condiments, and practically threw the plates on the table. I wanted to complain to a manager, but was pressed for time."
Shaquille S.,"Los Angeles, CA",53,9,2,1.0,4/2/2013,"I really wanted to like this place, but i just couldn't do it I've eaten here twice and both times its been the same problem, The food has absolutely no flavor. My first visit I tried the Stuffed bake potato. The cheese tasted like plastic and the potato was super dry. Today I thought i'd try the pasta, that's impossible to screw up right? Wrong again! Had to be the worst chicken alfredo i've ever had. Would have had a better meal if I stayed home and ate one of those little blue box tv dinners, at least then I would have tasted something. I cant believe so many people i know rave about this place, am I missing something? Maybe if I knock back a few glasses of they're super overpriced house beers, i'll be able to stomach another meal here. Nah, ill just march right next door to Lucille's, they always take good care of me"
Megan M.,"Torrance, CA",18,75,12,3.0,4/17/2013,"I love BJs in general. But this place needs and employee makeover.  Strike One: Hostess is rude. Took her five minutes of avoiding eye contact and walking around her 2ft by 2ft booth to tell us our party of four would be seated when the other lady came back. Strike two: Lady comes back and talks to hostess (straight gossip) for another 5 minutes while the four of us stand there on our lunch hour.  Strike three: Food was not cooked as well as other locations. We sat for 15 minutes trying to flag down our waiter for our bill. We received refills after we had already paid (none throughout the hour we were there.) Not to mention the hostess girls need to dress more professional. Bras hanging out while the rest of the staff is professional. I could have gone to a fast food place if I wanted that view.  Not so horrible that I would say to avoid it, but definitely not up to par with other BJs locations. Definitely not the place to go on your lunch hour. There are lots of other food places that will have you in and out with much better service in this area."
Heather M.,"Castro Valley, CA",5,19,,2.0,4/24/2013,"Been here twice, just to make sure our first experience wasn't a fluke. First visit: food was okay, not great. Was in a group of five, some of our food was cold. The worst part? Our server was borderline hostile. Sighed when we asked for stuff. Overall pretty rude. Second visit: minor success - a nicer server. However she still managed to fly right by our table without checking up on us when we needed her. I had the Thai mango salad, which was good, but my fiancee's burger and fries was cold. And there was a smudge of something gross in his beer glass. We had to ask to get it replaced, which at least the server did without complaint. I'll probably not bother coming back here again."
vanessa r.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,36,3,1.0,2/25/2015,"Terrible service & gave it more than one try but it failed every time.  My last visit starts with being told that out wait time for table for two would be up to 20 min. After 30 min, we ask why we haven't been called when other people that arrived after have already been seated. The hostess rudely replies that our names ""probably"" had been called long ago even though we were sitting in front of a speaker and our device hadn't gone off at all. Hostess says she'll get a table as soon as possible but we wait another 15 min while other people are called and seated. We make another complaint and hostess gets defensive, says she wasn't there when other people were being called because she went to go ""check"" on open tables when there was one right in front of us.  She seats us and apologizes for the wait but never took any responsibility, she blamed it on it being busy. We didn't acknowledge the apology nor did we look at her. She offered to get us started on drinks but after the service, we weren't in the mood so we declined. However, when she says ""my pleasure, the waiter will be with you shortly ok?"" - there's no need to say a 2nd ""Ok?!"" The silence meant we are pissed off and hungry! Never coming back here again."
La Neshay C.,"Ontario, CA",2,31,61,5.0,3/19/2016,"So i must say this is one of the hardest BJs location to find parking at . I don't live in LA so I normally go to the one in Chino Hills or in Ontario but since I was out here in LA to visit my uncle with my dad we wanted to go to a BJs near his house . It took us a long time to find parking but we finally did in the parking structure . We walked through the mall and outside to the get to BJs, which wasn't that far of a walk like I thought it would be . It was kind of weird to me that the wait was about 15 minutes but they had so many empty tables and so many servers working . We finally was called for our table and the host was walking quite fast and we almost lost him because he seemed like he was in a rush. We finally was seated and our waiter came by and greeted us . I must say he was GREAT. I wish I would have gotten his name but I do know he has an Irish accent because we asked him where he is from. He was able to recall our whole order without writing anything down, and we had a lot of stuff just for the three of us ! He even was happy to change my drink to strawberry lemonade last minute because I originally ordered a Shirley temple . I ordered the queso dip w chili which was pretty watery to me but it tasted okay and a bbq brisket and bacon burger with wedges that was really good. My dad had hot wings , clam chowder which was also watery compared to normal but was still good and the root beer ribs which he ate in 5 seconds. Last my uncle had garlic Parmesan wings which were sooo good and the new spaghetti and meatballs . Over all the food was good , I left very satisfied and full and the customer service was great . Besides the host kind of speeding off it was a great dinner . I will definitely be back !"
Nicholas P.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,27,6,3.0,9/26/2013,"The food is great but it is noisy, hard to get a seat without a wait and sometimes the staff are not as attentive as they could be. I have eaten here several times and on two occasions had to send the food back as it arrived cold. Other than that there are many great beers to sample. One time my wife forgot her credit card and by the time we realized it and went back to the restaurant, someone had found it and it was used several times by different people. Odd huh? So to sum up, I would continue to go back there, because, when they get it right, they are great!!"
Melody T.,"Las Colinas, TX",608,639,2746,4.0,1/11/2012,"Stopped for a quick beer and yep they do remember me here!!! Love Erin to death! Keep it up ma"""
Nesha B.,"Hawthorne, CA",259,250,107,4.0,7/22/2013,Place was not crowded at all for a sunday i was shocked since this location is at the mall. im always a fan of Bjs and this location is just as nice as the one in Torrance. I like how the manager walked to my table and asked how was the service and asked if we needed anything. which was great because i had no complaints but then i also noticed how he was walking to all the guest tables interacting which made my visit here even more pleasant.
Ebony B.,"San Diego, CA",116,91,77,3.0,1/21/2013,"I have been a long-time fan of BJ's, ever since my friend introduced me to the Great White. It had been a couple of years since I had been to BJ's, so I gladly returned considering I was way overdue.   I split a Great White deep dish pizza with my friend. Medium is more than enough for two hungry chicks; large would have been good to take home leftovers.  I don't know if it's because BJ's has changed it's recipe, or if it's that all BJ's are not created equal, but the pizza was a tad bit below my expectations for BJ's.  Mainly the crust... it was kinda dry and not as greasy. I guess that's a good thing, but we're talking BJ's, not a frozen diet dinner.  Also, the pizza itself was kind of dry-ish.  It wasn't sink-your-teeth-into-it pleasurable, like I normally feel when I eat their pies.   The thing that saves this BJ's location from getting a lower score is the fact that their other menu items taste the way they should when compared to other BJ's. They have such a wide menu and almost anything you order is guaranteed to be delicious. Everyone talks about their Pazookie, which, if not for that, I wouldn't be trying to make them at home now... but their Baked Beignet is extremely good! With it's whip cream and french vanilla ice cream sitting atop a warm, fluffy, lightly crisp beignet, drizzled with strawberries and strawberry syrup... you cannot go wrong! (unless they prepare this differently, too). I would return to this BJ's again, however, my expectations would be lowered and I would probably get the other items (like a deluxe salad or loaded baked potato) instead of the pizza."
