Sonya Z.,"New Orleans, LA",388,877,10,3.0,7/29/2013,"Haha, I can't believe I'm reviewing a BJs! Well, props to them for being the only place around this particular Culver City area that was serving food around midnight on Friday night. I was at a comedy show with a group of friends and we wanted munchies, but after a couple failed attempts at finding places with open kitchens (like Sara the Wine Bar) we ended up making the trek to BJs. The service was the highlight - our server was very patient with our large group of various orders and a check split 10 different ways. I shared the mahi mahi tacos with my friend and they were definitely edible.  BJs - not the best option, but a solid option."
Nedra J.,"Los Angeles, CA",901,41,66,1.0,10/28/2014,Usually have pretty good service here but went here for a birthday dinner we was told they could help us or sit us together then once half of the party sat at the table and other sat in the booth . To get actual water took almost an hour once the food arrive I had to find a waiter to get my own plate and drink manager didn't help any with service or get another waiter for our party . Never heard any manager tell customers they can't sit together just weird turning money away and not customer service at all . Our waiter did what he could but he was by his self with almost a party of 20 people this manager needs more training in this department .
Audrey M.,"San Gabriel, CA",30,46,13,1.0,10/7/2014,"Very slow service, our assigned waittress didn't even greet us or asked if we needed water when we sat down. Definitely not returning."
Mary R.,"Hawthorne, CA",23,43,42,3.0,1/12/2015,"Boss decided to take us out to lunch and I picked BJ'S. Our waitress was ok, maybe having an off day so decided not to mention her name. She just felt disconnected from her job. I looked around and noticed the other servers attitudes. They were happy and upbeat and seemed to enjoy their customers. Anywho, the manager was very friendly and accommodating. I didn't get his name but he was very helpful. He offered me a free pazooki coupon but silly me I walked out and forgot it. C'est la vie. Maybe next time things will be better"
Marcia W.,"Los Angeles, CA",104,1,,1.0,3/21/2016,Worst service ever!  Restaurant wasnt crowded and they took 20 minutes  to come and ask us what we wanted to drink! And then another 40 mins to bring our food. Then the food was burned and we were missing food that they tried to charge us for! To top it off the manager came to speak with me and gave me coupons for the kids to eat for free but the damn things were expired!i will never be going back
Daveda R.,"Inglewood, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/28/2015,"Worst service and food ever.... I had to pay a portion of the meal cost because I didn't like the main course. Management didn't care about the complaint,  nor did corporate. Never again will my family have any more gatherings at this location (perhaps this company)."
David L.,"Fort Mitchell, KY",3,33,1,1.0,1/15/2013,"So wow.  This is the second BJ's I've been too. I went to the one in Century City a couple weeks ago and found the place to be pretty nice. Good Staff, good food, good service.  Running on the theory that all chain restaurants all pretty much the same I went to this one.  Well I was wrong.  Slow service, although the bar wasn't that busy.  I ordered a cup of clam chowder and a mini pizza.  I got the pizza first. Nice.  The chowder showed up afterwards.  The bar staff was nice enough to take my pizza away to stay warm. It came back 60 seconds later reheated to the point it was goo.  So I tried the chowder, bland with big huge chunks of a chewy tasteless substance I assumed was clams.  couldn't finish that.  The pizza believe it or not (since they heated twice) was undercooked. No one asked nor seemed to care that I was not enjoying my food.  So I ate what I could stomach and waited for my bill. And waited. And waited. And waited.... Lovely. Obviously all BJ's are not created equal.   And now I feel dirty for typing that out..."
Grecia C.,"Torrance, CA",2,14,2,1.0,3/22/2015,"Love the pizza but the service at this location is terrible. Our server lacked in customer service. Our appetizer came after our meal and it was cold. The server barely communicated with us. I hope the customer service problem is resolved here soon. Until then, go to a different location."
Dave R.,"East Hampton, CT",0,117,4,4.0,10/6/2014,"The mojito was good at happy hour, but I didn't eat any food. Quite a crowd during MNF."
Jojuane P.,"Washington, DC",92,77,526,2.0,11/15/2013,"Just not very good bar food.  Wonder how much is just frozen or pre-made from Sysco and thrown into a fryer or oven.  Ribs seemed baked with sauce just thrown up top. Pizza isn't very good.  If you want to hang with friends and watch the game, it's OK. I'd eat before I get there."
Astrid S.,"Los Angeles, CA",101,17,40,3.0,2/7/2016,"We came here for dinner as a second choice because our first choice closed early on Superbowl Sunday night. We ordered calamari and a large pizza (half BJs favorite and half BBQ chicken). Both were delicious and thick. The calamari wasn't bad but it wasn't great; I've had WAY better calamari than theirs. Now about the service.... It's not great. It's slow and almost as if there are only 2-3 servers for the whole place. A couple booth were dirty but supposedly ""ready"" for guests to sit in. I think service needs A LOT of improvement in this place."
Dani Z.,"Culver City, CA",127,278,657,3.0,8/28/2011,"Came with a group of 6...admittedly, the cause of service being poor is 50/50 due to our party (we weren't all there when we were seated and some members decided to wait on the late comer, whereas, I personally would have been fine to not wait) I was seated in the corner and felt like our waitress was in such a rush that I got forgotten. Drink refills took forever, and I had to repeat my request. When dessert orders were taken, I wasn't asked on the first pass. My brother noted that he thought it was funny (not ha-ha) that she came back pretty quickly once the bill was left, and of course, that took a while to figure out among the party and we had to keep sending her away as we passed it to one another trying to figure out our shares. This next part may seem a little too hyper critical, but as we left, the group went to the front and I went to the restroom. In going toward the front to meet them, I decided to cut through the bar area, and there was a very narrow area to walk. In doing so, there was a host walking a party through to seat them. I stepped to the side for the woman in front of him to pass, but he should have allowed me to pass, rather than walking past me and making me wait as the party he was seating followed. I had to wait through 5 people. No, it's not a HUGE deal, but it is a courtesy, and as the host, knowing people were following...he should have had the courtesy of offering me to pass, first.  I wish I could give the evening better props. The food was tasty and so was my sample of PM Porter...but everything else left little to be desired. PS - you can call ahead your reservation, though you may still have to wait a few minutes once you arrive."
Claire P.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,35,12,2.0,1/12/2015,"We went here for brunch with about 8 people. The service was spotty. The drinks took forever and came out at different times. The food was mixed, some was ok, some was cold. We had to ask for condiments 3 times before we got them. service needs to improve!"
Baxter R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,5.0,8/10/2015,We have dined here numerous times!! If this place is under new management or they finally get it my hat is off to you!!! We had a beautiful dining experience here Late Yesterday Sunday Afternoon!!! The service was great and our meal was fantastic!!!! The Rib-eye Steaks are fantasic!!! I never bother to write reviews but felt the need to for you. This place has come a long long way from when you first opened and you deserve the credit now!!!! Good job and our new to go spot often as we can!!! Thanks BJs to a job well done!!
Jade P.,"Los Angeles, CA",32,158,217,3.0,10/14/2013,"I come here all the time because I live in the area the food is always cool and I love the pazookies but tonight this review is strictly on my lemon drop..... It's just ok, not sweet, not really strong, just ok!  I guess it all depends on the bartender. Tonight this bartender gets an average C for this average lemon drop martini!"
Cheryl T.,"Riverside, CA",68,64,807,3.0,11/25/2014,"Let me start off by saying my family likes BJ's Restaurants. We have been to this location several times. The most recent was a few days ago, Sunday evening. They have new holiday menus which we all decided to order from. My daughter ordered the ""New Deep Dish Lasagna. If you look at the photos I've posted, you will see that they skimped on her ""ravioli"". It was so dry (lacked fresh marinara sauce) probably due to sitting under a heat lamp. It tasted much better after we asked for some extra sauce. Mom ordered the House Top Sirloin w/Lemon Garlic Shrimp. The shrimp was good but a little on the salty side. Although the steak was ordered medium, it was received well done, with the burnt side facing down. (I guess they thought if they put the burnt side down no one would notice.) Our waitress agreed it was overcooked, took mom's plate to show the cook & then brought her plate back.  It took a while for mom to get the ""correctly"" grilled steak (cooked medium RARE this time) but at least she was able to eat her Cheddar mashed potatoes & broccoli while waiting. I ordered the blackened mahi mahi & Parmesan crusted scallops with steamed green beans & roasted brussels sprouts. The mahi mahi was spicy dry without a trace of lemon Chardonnay butter sauce. Maybe next time I'll try the grilled mahi mahi. The beans were excellent! Fresh & steamed to perfection. The brussels sprouts were very disappointing in comparison to the beans. Just look at my photo. Service was very good otherwise this would've been a 2 star rating. Please keep in mind this rating is an average of all previous visits to this particular location."
Karla C.,"Inglewood, CA",0,4,,4.0,4/21/2015,"Bjs has some tasty and crunchy pizza to enjoy, recommended:)..my mother loves this place, food, service, and also because its right next to the mall."
Erin O.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,29,,5.0,1/28/2016,"Food is always good. Gotta have the lemon thyme chicken, ribs, thin crust pizza, or jambalaya. Service is always good as long as you're polite. Let's face it, the demographic in this neighborhood can be tough to serve, so don't judge on some of the reviews. Or server tonight, Juan V. was super professional and manager Eugene is a gem. I will always crave bjs and always come here for my fix!"
Ed T.,"Torrance, CA",33,197,27,3.0,9/13/2011,"I've been to BJs a few times and like The Counter, the service is hit or miss. During my most recent visit the service was spot on. Our server whos name escapes me, was most pleasant and made my dinning experience enjoyable.  Now on to the food. We started off with the ahi tuna, which was decent. I've certainly had better quality almost everywhere else, but the dish was still enjoyable. We also ordered the avocado eggrolls, which were also tasty. I decided on the shrimp tacos, wich were worse than Rubio's shrimp taco's. The shrimp were over fried, which made them so tough and rough, I cut the roof of my mouth on one of them.  Overall, I can't say I've found a reason to return to BJ's, especially with Lucille's next door."
Cristina W.,"Beverly Hills, CA",63,102,36,2.0,3/22/2013,"Came here for lunch because it was an easy midpoint meeting spot between my friends and I.  Everything was fine, the server was nice, until they brought the wrong orders out for my friend and I (we ordered the same thing).  We flagged our server down and she immediately took the wrong plates away and said the kitchen would work quickly to make our correct order.  The manager even came out to apologize, which is a nice gesture, but I would have thought they would have at least comp'd us an appetizer or dessert or our soda/ice teas (they didn't offer).  I'm sure if we had made an issue of it, they would've comp'd something, but why do I need to ask for something to compensate for their error? Anyhow, after my correct food came out, it was okay - the sauce was heavy/salty (I got the salmon teriyaki bowl) and I could only get through half of it before feeling like I needed to drink a gallon of water.   If you need a quick bite to eat, this place is okay/convenient with lots of seating.  Not the place for you if you want fresh, healthy food or a supreme culinary experience. Self-parking was a bit tough to find (esp. during busier times) as it's party of the larger Westfield Mall, although there's valet directly in front for you ballers."
