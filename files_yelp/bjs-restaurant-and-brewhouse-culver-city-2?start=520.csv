Kim T.,"San Gabriel, CA",351,874,5765,4.0,8/25/2011,"So my coworkers took me here for my second to last day with the Company, and so it was bittersweet (Happy to be moving on with my life, but sad to be leaving the fun memories I had with this place).... We got here around 12 noon during lunch time, and surprisingly, it wasn't that crowded, and so we were seated in a booth right away. Our waitress was friendly, and attentive, and got our drinks right away. We all had ordered from the Lunch Specials.  Two of my coworkers for the shrimp or fish tacos, which came with two tacos of either choice, some colored chips, and with a side of little salad and some guac and salsa. My other coworker ordered the tomato bisque soup with a whole grilled ham cheese sandwich sliced into four pieces.  I had ordered the Chicken Parmagiana with Spaghetti and two pieces of garlic bread, with a drink of Black Cherry Soda (tasted like Currant, more than Black Cherry).  The garlic bread was yummy, but a little bit stiffed, but the tomato sauce helped soften it. The pasta was perfect - not too al dente and the chicken was the perfect amount of cheese and sauce. Very moist and juicy! Afterwards, we ordered a Triple Threat Chocolate pizookie, and it was so super creamy and indulgent - melt in your mouth perfection. Superb!  Overall, the lunch was pretty good. Reasonably priced around $9.00 a plate, and right portions for lunch time. Good enough to fill the tummy, but not heavy enough to make you so sleepy that you want to take a nap. One star off because the service was a bit slow. Our waitress was attentive when she was there, but disappeared for a while when we needed her for the boxes to pack up our food or to get our change back from paying the bill."
Nelson F.,"Culver City, CA",410,616,1098,3.0,11/16/2012,"My neighborhood BJ's Chicago Brewhouse, another advantage of living close to the nearby Culver City Westfield Mall. Great coming in for happy hour on Sunday afternoon to watch football at the bar, where they have discounted mini pizzas, drinks and other appetizers.  Food quality is decent, pizzas are always good for deep dish Chicago style and they have a great selection of beer.  Service has always been friendly and they have late night happy hour, so I regularly stop by. Pretty dependable when hunger strikes after 10 and I don't feel like making anything myself."
Michael S.,"Los Angeles, CA",34,9,2,2.0,5/6/2013,"My wife and I visited on a Saturday evening because we were in the mood for some good beer.  Although we expected the place to be busy, the wait time was minimal, and we avoided it altogether by sitting in a booth in the bar area.  We assumed this would result in quicker service.  This was not the case as it took a long time for a cheese burger and buffalo chicken pizza to arrive. When the pizza arrived it was lukewarm and soggy. The pizza also has a sweet taste as if BBQ sauce had been used. Our server went on break and her replacement did not come by once to check on the meal. My wife left most of her pizza uneaten and he did not ask if we wanted a box to take it home. After we finished eating he also did not ask if we wanted dessert or more beer. He seemed like a nice enough guy, but for some reason he ignored us. Unlikely we will visit here any time soon."
Sara K.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,9,1,4.0,1/31/2015,I'm not really sure what's with the low reviews here. My boyfriend and I just had a really nice experience. My Parmesan Crusted Chicken was fab and he enjoyed his steak. We were seated promptly and our waitress was great (and offered to bring out more of the lemon Chardonnay sauce because it's awesome). It's not the swankiest place for dinner but I'd come back here again.
Micael M.,"Inglewood, CA",7,71,,2.0,12/30/2014,The wait time for a table has gotten better. The staff for the most part is good. It's really hit and miss. The beer is delicious and the variety is awesome. The Alfredo is pretty tasty but the real star is the pizza and pizzoki
Emily A.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",67,22,9,5.0,8/17/2014,"I enjoy coming to this restaurant.  The staff is very nice. Our waiter VA was very nice.  We came for brunch, wasn't too busy.  Been here on a Friday night and the staff is busy but very friendly. Food is awesome. I love how they have one page for healthy options."
DeAndre E.,"Los Angeles, CA",33,14,4,1.0,11/5/2014,The most bad service I have experience today! Sitting by the bar the waitress take forever they won't even acknowledged you at all! Until is time to pay the bill and to make things worst the waitress had a really bad service never again!!
Mayerlin C.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,4,,1.0,1/7/2015,Horrible Service! I don't even wanna come back here. Food is not that great.  I just don't understand why they make you wait 15 minutes to be seated and there's a lot of tables available and the staff is just waiting around for their manager to tell them what to do. The food wasn't even hot when we got it. I rather pay more and go to Olive Garden!
Robin S.,"Los Angeles, CA",560,683,576,4.0,1/5/2011,"I think BJ's is pretty darn great compared to Cheesecake Factory. One single thing that really pull me back here is their deep fried artichokes, really... and for $2.95 an order? I'm willing to throw my diet out the door for at least a day or two.  I've been here three times and so far nothing is wrong with it... However, if you want to become a regular, don't look at the Nutritional booklet."
Mista B.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,41,13,2.0,12/7/2014,Terrible service and I literally saw a worker wipe the floor and then proceed to use the same cloth to wipe down the tables. DISGUSTING! The food is good but after seeing that I will not be back.
Samantha D.,"Los Angeles, CA",157,4,,1.0,1/30/2015,I just had dinner here and the service is in major need of improvement. It took them forever to come to our table and take our orders and even longer for the food to come out. When our food finally came out (about 40mins later) it was cold and no one came to see if we were doing okay or needed refills. When we asked to speak to a manger excuses were thrown around and they tried to offer us a free dessert. Things could really be improved here
Dave S.,"Culver City, CA",279,19,,1.0,5/9/2014,"not sure if it's because we were here on a Friday night at 7pm but once we got seated, it took about 5 minutes for someone to take our drink order and then another 25-30 minutes before we got up and left as our server never came back. i don't expect great service from a chain restaurant on a Friday but damn, there was none at all. i still like the restaurant but won't be going back to this location again"
Alexa S.,"Studio City, CA",671,310,65,4.0,8/7/2012,"Let's say this about BJ's. I don't know how good the food ACTUALLY is. All's I know is that when you haven't eaten all day and you and your girls have just run nearly 6 miles in deadly beach heat, pretty much anything will taste balls-out amazing. That said... I had DREAMS about the Mexican Tortilla Soup last night. I mean sexy dreams. It was that creamy and luscious. I wanted to take this soup out to dinner and a movie and then look it in the eye and tell it I couldn't wait to call it tomorrow. AND I WOULD call it tomorrow. And then, if it told me it was getting deported back to Mexico, I would take it to Vegas and put a ring on it. Lock that shit down. Now, we had one of those deals where you get certain dishes for a set amount of money. The pizza was only passable. But it's deep dish and, to me, that's just not pizza. All pizza must be NY style or no style at all. The pizookie (cookie with ice cream), while not a dessert person at all, was also yummy. And to be honest, there is something sexy about sharing that with your friend when you're both health obsessed rather than your man, who will eat anything. Pizookie is my new favorite non-sexual religious experience. Yeah, so... Make of BJ's what you will. It's a family restaurant in a MALL. Lower your expectations, kids."
Eduardo X.,"Los Angeles, CA",69,276,,2.0,1/5/2013,"Not really into chain places, and yet I always find myself here whenever a group of non-adventurous people wanna meet for dinner. The service is adequate, the food is adequate, the prices are a tad too high. Dessert here, though, is pretty good. Well, this was a rather uneventful review, LOL.  They're okay, that's about it."
Arleen P.,"Los Angeles, CA",232,99,17,2.0,8/9/2012,"For the most part, you know what you are getting when you come to this chain BJs... theoretically it is a fun atmosphere, good place for drinks, to watch games, or to chill with some decent food.  But honestly, I cannot recount ONE good, smooth outing here...the service and professionalism, pride in business do not exist at this location.  First of all the service and reception desk are 95% of the time rude, and seem MISERABLE.  EVERY TIME, whether busy or not, whether name put in in-advance or not, my party and I are waiting for ridiculous amounts of time and being treated like pests (one time a coworker of mine checking on our table that we had been waiting for over an hour--which happens EVERYTIME I HAVE COME HERE, was called a ""d*ck"" by the receptionist under her breath...and my coworker is very VERY polite and patient.  It was so strange.  The location is convenient otherwise I'm sure it wouldn't have been chosen.  The rare occasion the managers try to make it right, but it's RARE that they seem to be around.  The servers are NEVER around, you wait for FOREVER to be seated and people there act like you are bothering them.  Just get another job if you can't understand basic fundamentals of customer service.    I would never recommend this location to someone unless you want to set aside 4 hours for dinner and be frustrated by poor service.  If you go to another location however, I recommend the mojitos, great white pizza, and traditional chocolate chip pizookie."
Sean L.,"Palms, Los Angeles, CA",1109,175,,5.0,11/13/2012,"Woop. Woop.  Bj's killed it.  Came here a couple times last weekend for drinks.  Look for Keyon (Key) or Sylvia to mix you up a drank.  There are about 300 beers on tap at this place. It's in the Culver City Westfield Mall of the 90. Outdoor entrance only. Unreal set up.  TV's every where. So cool. Like I said...300 tap beers. Endless booze bottles.  Enjoyed a few Colorado Bulldogs, bloody marys, and beers throughout the weekend.  The service is exemplarary. The food looks great. The location is awesome. THE DRINKS ARE EXCELLENT.  Go here and shoot the breeze and watch sports! Great atmosphere. PROS: Fun -Affordable -Late night happy hour -Good drinks -Great service -Good location -TAP BEER Cheers, bro Sean"
S R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,,5.0,12/14/2015,"Well its been over a year since my boyfriend and I have been here due to the terrible service we had received!! Well today we decided to give it another go! It all started off terrible...making us remember why we hadnt been back in so long! But what really changed things for us was how nice our waitress and the manager were about the situation. My boyfriend and I both work in restaurants and understand how it can be! But to be honest it was rather slow and our food took forever!! and then I got mine cold.... but the way in which the manager on duty handled everything was amazing! You dont find that kind of customer service just anywhere!! Nowadays people dont really care it seems when you go out to eat customer service doesnt seem like a big deal. And most managers from our experience are arrogant and dont care to make sure you leave happy they just give a fake apology and are on their way. But I regret I am unable to remember his name, the manager on duty for lunch today, was very very kind and seemed very sincere with his apology and they way he handled everything we really appreciate it. Made our almost terrible experience turn out to be awesome! The waitress was also very kind! Things happen and we understand, in the end, its really how you approach the situation that makes a world of difference. Thank you guys again and we will be back in soon!"
Audrey M.,"Los Angeles, CA",67,29,6,5.0,8/24/2014,"First Time Here...Excellent Service. The waitress Keyla i believe it was her Name . She was polite and very friendly. We order Pizza and Mozarella Cheese Sticks and Beer. It was Really Good, I Recommend This Restaurant. :) i will be coming back real soon."
Emma T.,"Los Angeles, CA",442,222,1415,5.0,7/9/2013,"My staff loves this place, I take them there for a treat and they all vote to go to BJ's They give us special service and stay and talk with us and they very friendly.  I would say that me and my staff are FANS of BJ's"
Drew T.,"Marina del Rey, CA",1,15,,1.0,12/4/2012,"TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!  And even worse management.   Bottom line, I was the only customer picking up a to-go order and 2 different servers and the BJ's manager completely ignored me and refused to help complete my pickup order.  So I just walked behind the counter and left exact change and took my food and left. I will never eat from there again."
