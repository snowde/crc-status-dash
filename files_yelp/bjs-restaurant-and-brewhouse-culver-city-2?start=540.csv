Dth S.,"Los Angeles, CA",33,997,1,4.0,11/10/2015,"i'd have to say that i really dig BJ's! they're so consistent and it doesn't matter which one you're at either because to me they really are all the same... and i haven't had a bad server yet at any of their locations either. the prices are good, the food's consistent, and i really like their beer!"
Eric W.,"West Jordan, UT",79,8,1,4.0,1/2/2015,Been here a few times but usually just by myself. Service for me has been good and the food has always been good. I can't leave without getting a pizookie.
Daniela Z.,"Torrance, Los Angeles, CA",9,97,20,1.0,9/27/2015,this BJ's has the worst service! our server Nicole was too busy flirting away to the guys at the table next to us giving her number and facebook. she looks over at our table but continued to talk to those guys. it took us 30 minutes for her to come to our table and greet us. we had to ask the busser for a new server and the busser kindly found a new server for us and he took care of us. the table next to us had the same problem with the server. the manager was nowhere to be found. Saeed helped us out and he was so nice!
Brandon M.,"Vancouver, Canada",23,8,,2.0,1/5/2013,"Generally, they are okay. They have a serious problem with consistency though, and that is a deal breaker. When your pizza comes back half the times doughy and other times cooked just right, its hard to justify a good review.  Big deal breaker for me lastnight was ordering the Blue cheese burger to go. I ordered it well done, and have been burned by them in the past for doing this so I was a little worried it would be undercooked. I didn't have time to check at the restaurant though, and didn't want to ruin the burger by cutting it in half then letting it sit 10 mins in the car while I get home. It was not well done at all in the center, though on the outside it was dry and burnt looking/tasting.  Bacon was great though, I replaced my patty with my fries and ate it without the beef... Someone just didn't know how to cook a burger properly. And that was my last straw. If you can't cook a burger right, what else are they messing up in there? Don't dare get any kind of seafood, not worth the risk!"
Terri J.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,1/19/2016,"During our meal a RAT ran under our table, ran back out waiter pretended like he didnt see it. When the manager Ryan Nathaniel was notified  he acted like no big deal, and offered a $20 GIFTCARD. The manager Ryan was very rude as if I'm interested in returning  ever."
Sean A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,13,,1.0,1/27/2015,"Went for a walk and stopped by the mall for a bite to eat. Walked in and stood and waited for a seat. We waited, waited a little longer, like fools waited a little for the staff who continued to ignore us. They were busy, but not that busy that you can't take a couple of seconds to acknowledge a customer and say we'll be right with you. We walked out, went across to Olive Garden where we were immediately greeted and seated. They were just as busy. But the staff makes a huge difference."
Sonya P.,"Torrance, CA",194,16,4,4.0,11/21/2015,"I come to this location once in awhile after work. Overall, I never have any problems with the food or drinks. The food quality seems to be pretty good. However, sometimes the service can be a bit slow. Taylor was our server the other night, and he was by far the most polite and professional server that I've had at this location."
Wendy M.,"Tucker, GA",40,49,53,3.0,4/17/2015,"Horrible service, ordered coffee and after waiting a while I was told that he was trying to fix the coffee machine..... Huh Okay? Minutes later it was yeah,  yeah, your coffee it's coming no one at my table had their beverages twenty minutes after being seated.  Clearly our waiter was stretched too thin AND inexperienced with managing the flow of tables in his section.  Lucky for him our appetizer, the carnita fries, landed on the table just before I landed a right cross on our server.  Unfortunately the rest of the meal wasn't as impressive, the deep dish lasagne tasted like it came from the frozen food section of Trader Joes which is fine if I were at home.  My daughter barely touched her pork sandwich, and the broccoli n cheese soup came in a bowl so shallow, it should have been labeled a 'cup of soup'.  The restaurant was very busy and one of the few places open late near the airport aside from bland and generic hotel food.  So for being open I give them an additional star"
Bren H.,"Hawthorne, CA",3,34,9,5.0,10/23/2014,"We have been here in the past with VERY slow/poor service. I used to go to the BJs in West Covina (near my work) which is great. We tried again tonight.  The hostess was polite. Our waiter tonight (Sean? Shawn?) was nice, fun, and attentive. His serving team was fine. It was a little busy but service was good. There were disappointing menu changes but I tried something new (tilapia tacos) that were excellent. My husband had a special order (jambalaya - no shrimp, extra sausage) that came out correct. He reports that it was tasty.  We asked for some extras that came out quickly. I love that they have a variety of brews (including hard cider). The Nutty Brewnette is one of my favs. They were playing good (to me) music but not too loud."
Nikki T.,"Mid-City, Los Angeles, CA",6,67,24,5.0,10/1/2014,"I try not to be so picky but I believe in excellent service. I received nothing short of it last night. I was greeted exceptionally quick & friendly by a woman named Tina. She was so polite & thorough. She made my visit with my family enjoyable. The waitress was also very quick, efficient, and friendly. This may have been my best visit this far. Tina was a breath of fresh air. Thank you very much. I hope you continue to take your job seriously & always keep the customer 1st. We will be back!!!"
Amanda A.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,13,4,1.0,4/28/2015,"WORST SERVIVE EVER! I love bjs and I know the service they are suppose to give. This location is the worst ever!!! they do not welcome you, server is not welcoming. I am not rating this on a one time visit. I went about 4 times to maybe have a change of staff! I even brought it to the managers attention, still nothing has changed. I rather eat anywhere but this location."
Smriti S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,1.0,12/12/2015,"My husband and I usually go to the Century City BJ's and are usually content. Since we happened to be at Fox Hills mall we decided to go to this location - bad move. Our server seemed nice and even though it took forever to get some service he provided us with okay service. We were there for an hour and a half to get a vegetarian pizza and a soup. Talk about waste of time. Anyway, fast forward to the next day and when my husband who is a vegetarian was eating his pizza, he noticed a huge piece of chicken. I called the restaurant so that they understand that when people make it clear that they are vegetarian, the restaurant needs to respect that and be careful. I was actually not that upset when I called the restaurant because mistakes happen but I just wanted to point out that they need to watch out for situations like this. The manager Eugene is a piece of work. He made me feel so bad about actually calling and talking about the issue as if I am only calling to get the refund. I am an auditor and my husband is an attorney so we really don't need to discuss dimes and pennies. So please Eugene, keep the $35 and provide others with better service. It's the customers who help you run your business so learn to respect them. Terrible."
Pier H.,"Los Angeles, CA",238,353,128,4.0,3/5/2011,"I went here for lunch today with my BF.  Initially we were seated at a table for four, but when our server arrived he immediately moved us over to a booth (there were several available).  We had the bruschetta appetizer, bbq chicken thin crust pizza, bacon cheeseburger pizza, and chocolate chip pizookie.   Maybe they have taken note of all the negative reviews because the service was excellent.  Our drinks were quickly refilled and food came promptly.  Like another reviewer said, the floor here is very slippery.  My BF has a foot injury and has to wear a special foot brace.  Between the brace and the smooth floor he wasn't able to get much traction and had to be very careful not to fall over.  Besides that, this BJ's location is alright with me."
Rubi L.,"Palms, Los Angeles, CA",0,6,1,5.0,2/6/2015,I just  want to make sure i leave a review for this great server i had last week when i went in to eat. Sarah was great!! her service was amazing. She has Great Service even though she was extremely occupied with other customers. Her great service was truly appreciated in these times it is hardly ever received!
Gerald W.,"Burbank, CA",21,157,23,2.0,9/19/2014,"Honestly this is the worst B'js I have ever been to.  Extremely rude hostess, waitress had an attitude had a pretty bad attitude as well.  I have been to a few different B'js in various area and this is the worst one I have ever been to.  The food was typical B'js which is the only reason for the 2 stars."
Erin T.,"Venice, CA",17,95,123,3.0,9/16/2014,I love their personal pan pizza. It's always a great lunch special and a great price. It's usually very busy and hard to find parking.
Manny C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,16,1,3.0,1/5/2016,"Great food, not so great service. Our waitress must have been new. She gets 3 stars for effort but never should we wait as long as we did for our food and bill! :("
Barbie M.,"Westlake, Los Angeles, CA",6,2,,1.0,7/17/2014,Horrible service! Just wanted a pizookie to  go and it take about 30 minutes. The hostess seem to busy to care or to help out.
Deisi S.,"Los Angeles, CA",17,14,6,1.0,6/8/2014,This is the worst bjs ever!!!!!!.... we were waiting for a booth because I have back problems we waited for an additional 20mins just to find out we were sitting in a regular table. We asked the waiter what happen and she said we were only 3 people not 4!!!!!!!!..... really you would loose customers for a  booth..... poor customer service waiters don't care just stand there roll there eyes and give you attitude. .... if you don't have g ood customers service you should be  fired..... customers are your check!!!!!!!!
J A.,"Pico Rivera, CA",0,2,,1.0,1/3/2015,I was just there last night. The service was horrible. First things first the environment was not me. The host had an attitude never friendly. She had a mad look at all times including an annoying red lipstick. The waitress was so slow. We received food no utensils to eat. Our desert slammed on our table by the idiot kid that ran out the kitchen as if he was in a rush. Seriously do not recommend this BJ's unless you are African American. They will sure give you the best of the best.
