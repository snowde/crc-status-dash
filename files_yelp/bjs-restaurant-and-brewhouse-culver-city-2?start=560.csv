Tommy D.,"New York, NY",283,198,463,4.0,4/8/2010,"So what if it's a chain??? If it's good...I will pretend it's my mother's business and give it high rating!  I guess the reason for the low rating here is mostly slow service.  That is to be expected at BJ's.  Yelping BJ's for slow service is like yelping the DMV for its attentiveness and waiting time.  Luckily, we had a big party which we got the special event menu for.  Our waiter and his helper were quick to get our drink order and quick to bring the pizzas out.  For ~$15 per person (drink, tax, and tip included), we got unlimited any four kinds of deep-dish pizzas.  We chose the veggie, BJ's favorite, mediterranean, and southwestern.  At some point during the feeding, the kitchen brought out a BBQ chicken pizza which everyone was excited about.  I could tell our pizzas were freshly made and that definitely deserved a star and a cookie.   Since it was a per person menu, it took out the hassle of people trying to figure out how much they owed and anyone feeling cheated if he or she overpaid.  No pazookie this time because we were so full but we got to take home the pizzas that we didn't finish...which was a lot!"
Sean C.,"Fremont, CA",1014,1383,2184,4.0,2/5/2013,"The-e-ee DEEP DISH of the 21st century. Yet in all honesty, it doesn't have the oomph that it used to have for me, since discovering ""Stella Rosa,"" ""Pitfire"" and ""Birba"" in Palm Springs. Having frequented more than a dozen times, the ""corporate"" menu has changed some -- with unnecessary additions that grates more than it could chew -- but the original essence of their best pizza pies (Sweet Pig, BBQ Chicken, Italian Sausage, Sweet Corn) still reign. When it comes to beers, I love the light ones: Lightswitch Lager, Jeremiah Red, Brewhouse Blonde, Harvest Hefeweizen. The Pazookie is a dessert classic, its a huge cookie and ice cream dollop for two, and I am happy about the choice of different cookies. I still like Vanilla Bean on top."

Ruth C.,"Culver City, CA",7,17,,5.0,10/28/2014,"the service was good, the food was good and the waiter looked like by son and even acted like him. It made us giggle every time he walked by. They went out of their way to make us happy, we had ordered something we didn't like and they replaced it without a fuss."
Sharonda W.,"Greenville, SC",69,75,98,4.0,6/13/2012,"This was the first resturant i recommended to my Friends from out of town.. and Model friends who like too eat lo..

Pauline D.,"Washington, DC",8,70,324,4.0,9/28/2014,Service was great and so was the food. We were in time for late night happy hour which saved us money! BJs is always good
Carmella B.,"Atlanta, GA",558,3,,1.0,11/21/2015,"2.5 stars? More like .5 and that's only bc our server had a nice smile. My friend ordered the Atlantic salmon and i ordered a simple broccoli cheddar soup and caesar salad. The salmon was dry and overcooked, the medley of vegetables that accompanied the dish were cold (didn't seem fresh) almost microwaved....the soup was thicker than I had expected but even worst, my salad had bits and pieces of meat in it, I asked for no meat as it makes me sick. Sidebar, we had also ordered a jalapeño cucumber margarita and Royal soda...this bartender made an even lazier attempt than the cook. Drinks were nothing special, poorly crafted and flat. When brought to the attention  of our server, the manager was presented. The manager, Felix then continued to poke and pull apart the salmon explaining that if he puts in another order then ""it will probably come out the same. It won't be to your satisfaction."" He then continued in a manner in which he pressured my friend and I to order a different item off of the menu. Of course we didn't but that's neither here nor there. Customer service means much more than the actual dish. So BJs in Culver City, Westfield mall with Felix as the restaurant manager, you have failed at both. I do not recommend this location."
Jeff E.,"Phoenix, AZ",80,80,1,5.0,8/19/2014,For a busy place I was pleased on the time to order and receive our food. Service and food was ver y good!!
Ags P.,"Chino, CA",215,254,113,2.0,12/7/2012,"I guess I'll be adding onto the countless bad reviews.  One would think, with so many bad reviews regarding service, something would be done about it.  I guess, on a corporate level, these reviews aren't as highly regarded.   Needless to say, it's pretty standard BJ's food, but when it comes down to this particular location, service was horrific.  I called in an order, and it was a STRUGGLE to get my order correctly.  The employee taking my order would talk to me, and someone else (I'm guessing a server) at the same time.  Unbelievably frustrating when I kept asking if the question she was posing was for me.  The only reason why my rating is 2 stars, is because by some miracle, my order was correct when I picked it up."
Darian H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,16,5,1.0,11/13/2015,"If I could give a negative star I would. The situation that happened tonight was beyond repair in regards to them receiving our service again. Charles the waiter all the way to Felix the unprofessional manager has set the bar high for customer maltreatment. They served us some soggy undercooked pizza and as a courtesy they are supposed to make another or a different type for the customer not being satisfied and inconvenienced for that matter. Not the case, they only have her a free pazooki and when she wanted a different pizza made right to go, Felix said no problem we will replace the pizza insinuating he wasn't gonna charge but we get the bill and he said we had to pay. Fact of the matter is his language to convey his message was not clear and he literally argued with us WITH his staff annnnddd they gossiped about what happened with other staff in front of the customers (us and other guests)! There is way more that happened in between but the major issue is they have terrible customer service. Had me waiting 15 minutes for some water and argued with customers. NEVER AGAIN not at this location anyway. Save yourselves"
Elizabeth S.,"Beverly Hills, CA",142,6,1,2.0,11/11/2014,"This only gets 2 because it so happens that I went on a day they were training new people so they weren't very attentive. Other than that, the calamari is great!i tried the spaghetti and shrimp and since  I'm allergic to tomatoes and I forgot to let them know and they kindly redid it. :-)"
Melissa W.,"Los Angeles, CA",119,6,,1.0,9/15/2014,"Really the most disappointing meal I've had in awhile. Service was abysmal. Took the server forever to come and take care of us, and it was slow the entire time. Food was mediocre at best, and not only left a bad taste in my mouth but left me hungry at the end. The best part of the meal was the French fries. I wouldn't come here again for work, with friends or with a deal. Shame on the management of this place, poor management in both the front and back of the house."
Victor B.,"Comanche, TX",1,36,,3.0,7/11/2013,Good service. Nice atmosphere.  Sampled four of their label beers and was not impressed with any of the four.  The deep dish personal pizza crust was blasé but the wedge salad really hit the spot. My recommendation for this  place would be to buy bottled beer and pass on the house taps.
Zandra E.,"Dallas, TX",667,482,78,3.0,4/25/2012,"Maybe even a 3.5.  Okay, so last night my friends wanted to meet up after class and BJ's was chosen because it was close to school, served alcohol and had plenty of food for us to choose from. I've been to BJ's in Dallas and had a fun experience so I was down. So I head up there and OMG, parking was a complete pain the ass! I mean, c'mon, it is in a mall structure?! Parking should not be such an issue! After driving around for forever in a day, I decided to valet instead of burning gas which was $7 (not including tip). I went into BJ's and it was pretty much like every other BJ's I've been to. Nothing special, but it was crowded and clean.  I found my friends and the waitress was super nice and took our orders quickly. Let me just say though, I was not too happy that the bartender pretended to know how to make a chocolate martini and sent me this white crap in a martini glass with a squiggle of chocolate on top that tasted like MILK. Mama wasn't happy at all. I sent that shit back with a quickness and ordered a White Russian instead and they did manage to get that one right (and it was strong). What wasn't right was paying $8 for such a basic drink at a place called BJ's.   The food was typical BJ's food. Pretty good. Everyone was ordering small bites so we could try each other's food. The avocado wraps are awesome and a great vegetarian option. Also, the Capri salad was yummy. Plus, the price point was not bad at all. The great thing I did like was our ability to have a fun, crazy conversation without being interrupted a lot nor being told to quiet down (yes, we were that table). It was awesome. So, for that alone, I have to say I will definitely return with friends."
Esteve M.,"Los Angeles, CA",98,297,66,1.0,6/21/2014,Another horrible experience. They just can't get right here.  Cold fries. Burger over cooked. And messy. Cold fried jalapeño. Nice manager today. He was caring and apologetic. But I decided to have lunch elsewhere.
Sonia N.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,2.0,12/4/2015,"Bad service....didn't get any water, I ordered soup and I didn't even get a spoon or crackers...expensive drinks w a lot of ice a drop of alcohol..not coming anymore..not worthy"
Brad H.,"Oxnard, CA",0,5,,5.0,12/2/2015,"Ok, so the food was ok. It's typical bj's fair. What really warranted the five star rating was my server. His name is VA. He was amazing, ask for him by name! You won't be disappointed!!!"
Lila B.,"Diamond Bar, CA",58,94,295,4.0,1/15/2013,Love the pizza ( supreme) & pizookie's (especially chocolate chunk)....  carry on.... lol
Anna T.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,2,,1.0,10/21/2015,"Really disappointed. I have had great experiences at BJs before. First time at this location and hosted a private event for my co workers. Was a train wreck. They did not set up for the event of 30 people until we arrived. Btw we were contracted so there is no excuse for their failure to prepare. I was told we were getting a banquet room, but when we showed up we were on the patio. We had to push tables together ourselves and demand more tables and chairs. One server kept standing in the back corner and watching the TV.  The other server was instructed to do separate tabs for the alcohol but she made one running tab. It was a nightmare/train wreck. The manager did his best to avoid us. Did I mention we were not provided napkins or enough plates/silverware. I don't usually review places but I am still upset about the lack of care, respect, thought that was shown to myself and my group."
Brandy G.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,8,,1.0,5/2/2014,"HORRIBLE FOOD AND HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!  Waited over 35 mins for our dinner which came out very cold!  My ribeye steak was some thin, burnt, dried out cheap cut of SIRLOIN being MASKED as a RIBEYE STEAK for over $20!! It was so dry and lacked any type of flavor except for the extremely burnt char! Asked for spinach and asparagus for my two sides and was given far beyond less than a normal one portion serving. Literally a tablespoon full of spinach!!!! Additionally, the presentation of my plate was so sloppy! All of it, just terrible!!!!!  Save your time and your gas because this food and the horrible service is not worth it! Beyond disappointed!!!! I will never go back!"
