Janee M.,"Pasadena, CA",40,187,99,3.0,12/3/2012,"I have always been a BJ's fan and it never disappoints.. but this one kinda did :( The food never wavers as always which is great.. but the lady I spoke with only the phone about making a reservation was very rude and when I got there I saw her yelling at another employee. Really?? I always say this, but being in the service industry, I know how hard it is. But when you're a hostess, you'e just couldn't be any easier... just be friendly and that's it. Then on top of that, our waiter was whacky! He never looked at us straight in the face or even tilted his chin up at all. He must have been bored because be refilled our drinks like 10 times.. and before they were even half empty!"
Aida A.,"Los Angeles, CA",239,25,,1.0,4/6/2014,"Well it all started when we messed up and thought yay! BJ's they have great food and beer so we turned around and drove back. Once entering the returning door walked up to an empty hostess counter, when a waitress walked up to use the computer at the podium. She failed to acknowledge us at all was totally focused on something, I waited  about a minute and greeted her .. Well hello there 1st thing she Said oh I am sorry I don't work this section I responded by telling her all I wanted was a hi ... Help there how are ... Thanks for coming in... It's key"
Carl H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,23,1,1.0,1/12/2012,"Wilted lettuce. 3rd time in a row now. I won't be going back for a forth. Waitresses/hostesses (or whatever they call themselves) have serious attitude problems, as if it's the customers fault for their failing acting careers. Regardless, as a customer you do not have to accept terrible food & service. Take your chances someplace else when it comes to this BJ's."
Niks O.,"Los Angeles, CA",646,257,221,3.0,6/25/2014,Came on a Sunday night just for Pizookie's with a couple friends. Was feeling a little under the weather otherwise I would have ordered my normal Jerry Burst. Nothing spectacular.. Seated ourselves quickly in the bar.. Knew what we wanted.. Came out in a timely manner. There's a BJ's closer to where I live but this one is closer to my gf's place so I don't mind coming here too. Will probably come again.
JP S.,"Los Angeles, CA",109,17,46,2.0,7/3/2014,Service is slow at the bar. We've been here for half an hour and have only ordered drinks. We asked if they had something of menu and I think our waits forgot about us.
Bob S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,3.0,9/2/2013,Food was good but it took forever to get our food and water. They definitely need to improve their service. I LOVE deep dish pizza and tons of different choices of food.  Parking is a big hassle there because of the mall. Overall it is OK.
James R.,"Sunrise, Las Vegas, NV",9,3,,3.0,8/3/2014,"Great food but the service is so slow. Waited   Almost 40 minutes for our food after we ordered. Our desert took another 30 minutes. If you have a planned afternoon scheduled, you will need to block 2 hours just to eat here."
Travis H.,"Fresno, CA",60,434,57,1.0,4/25/2014,"This place is miserable! We were there the night of a huge football game and what a joke. Service was terrible, our waiter seemed more interested in who was making a touchdown. Glasses never got refilled and we waited over 30 minutes from placing our order until our salads came out."
April M.,"Los Angeles, CA",873,70,17,3.0,10/15/2011,"Pretty good location.  Parking isn't that great, but their Peach Sangria and red velvet pizzoki are amazing!! My server was pretty forgetful (ie: he forgot my water twice / he forgot that I asked for my dessert to go and brought it out on a plate), and he honestly looked stressed. OH and their floors are soooo slippery!! While we were there this girl bust her ASS on the ground in front of her date! OMG!! Lol *whew* Glad it wasn't me. It's an okay place to go for drinks with friends... just wear non-slip soled shoes. *cheers*"
C.M. V.,"Long Beach, CA",61,25,1,1.0,11/11/2013,"It seems as though we'd be echoing all of the comments that mention slow service and the inability of management to compensate for the wait staff. We went for a private party reserved for the patio area. The expectation (seeing as we were there for a reserved patio party) would be that there would be more than enough wait staff assigned to our large party. This was not the case, and the rest of our visit to BJ's went downhill from there. * Poor customer service overall.  * No one greeted us or offered water to our table. Our table was situated toward a corner of the patio, but was closest to the frequently used exit/entrance of the wait staff. Waitress consistently seemed to make rounds to all other tables except the corner tables.  * Arrived at 7:30pm; wasn't asked about what we would like to order until 8:45pm. When we did ask for water (since it was never offered to us), they still NEVER brought it out.  * Our order of appetizers took 40 minutes to arrive to our table. Our entrees never arrived, and it was 9:45pm when we decided to leave. * When we approached the front desk to settle our bill for the appetizers that we did receive/eat, we also made a complaint about the poor customer service as well as the poor timing of food served. This is where the management showed their inadequacy and lack of personable customer service. The manager, Mike, said, ""When I went in there, I asked everybody how they were doing, and everyone said they were doing great. I wasn't aware that you were not."" A blanket call out to a big party in the patio to ask, ""How's everyone doing?"" is not customer service. Between the two of us, we have over 25 years of customer service experience, and a blanket statement never does and never will ""cover"" all the needs of your customers/clients. Mike apologized about not knowing that our needs were not met and that our experience with BJs at that location was poor. His apology was insincere, forced, and rehearsed. He told us that he would talk to the person who was waiting on us. One of the ladies who waited on us (because our original waitress never followed through) walked over with a plastic to-go bag in her hand. It was our entree that never made it to us. Her tone matched Mike's tone. We're assuming she was a manager or an assistant manager since she was not in a BJs server uniform. Her name is Mecca Tanksly (sp). She said the same thing as Mike stating that she ""asked everyone how they were doing, and everyone said that everything was great!"" Again, we explained to her we shouldn't have to explain to her that despite our table being in the corner of the patio, we should not have been overlooked. She interrupted our complaint with lots of acknowledgement filler phrases that were so insincere and completely translated to why their customer service was the way it was. She apologized with this same tone. When we tried to pay for our appetizer, she said she would take care of it. She offered to give us our entree, but we declined as this location definitely left a ""bad taste"" in our mouths. The next day when we spoke to the other guests who were at our table, they said it was a hassle getting our appetizer and entree removed from the table bill because of course BJ's did not want to create separate bills for separate guests. *We're not asking for anyone to wait on us hand and foot. A simple greet and inventory of our needs when we first arrived would be a standard expectation. They missed the mark. Bringing water without us having to ask at a restaurant of this ""caliber"" would be a standard expectation. They missed the mark. Physically walking over to our table and asking the guests at our table (not just shouting into a crowded party of guests) how we were doing and if we needed anything would be a standard expectation. They missed the mark. Getting our order taken within, say, 10-15 minutes of us arriving and being seated would be a standard expectation. They missed the mark. Receiving our full order within our two and a half hour visit would be a standard expectation. They missed the mark. This BJ's location lacks the depth of management and wait staff and basic customer service skills to earn another visit or a recommendation from patrons. By the way, we told the second manager that we were avid Yelpers, and we always want to be able to make recommendations for the businesses we patronize. She said, ""Oh, I don't even get on Yelp! I don't pay attention to that stuff."" Again, they're missing the mark if they are clearly not caring about taking the time to read reviews and feedback about their establishment and their service. Maybe, they should rethink checking Yelp! and listening and receiving their patron's feedback to continually look for more ways to improve their service and their company's reputation. BJ's corporate office would certainly be disappointed among other things to hear that their own employees don't take time to research ways to improve and deliver quality to patrons."
Antonia C.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,9,2,1.0,3/19/2013,"This BJs blows!!! I've been a fan since I went to one of the first BJs in Laguna Beach, many years ago.  Last Friday was my 3rd trip to this location. Husband and I decided we are writing this location off. 1st the hostess/ waiting area is chaotic. Wait was longer than estimate given.  There are so many employees an Donne of them seem like they are sure about what they are doing or they do not care. There was one hostess who was really sweet and tried to be kind and helpful once we were getting our table.  I could not understand a word out of our waiters mouth. He spoke to the ground in a low voice in a crowded loud restaurant and bar. We just assumed what he was saying. Worst parts coming up - Took forever to get our drinks!!! What the heck happened to the deep dish pizza?!!! Our pizza came on a white dish instead of the big black pan. :(   WTH? It looked like a hand tossed pizza, not a deep dish. It tasted doughy and disappointing. Meat toppings were skimpy. Crust was not deep dish.  If the pizza here was as good as original BJs used to be, I could get over the other problems here."
Tyler M.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,3,8,4.0,8/11/2014,"I had the Macaroni and bacon appetizer.... Amazing!!! The Calamari was OK, a little under seasoned, but the white sauce it came with was really good."
Julissa B.,"Los Angeles, CA",93,3,2,1.0,9/8/2014,Doesn't even deserve a 1 star the waiter was very rude. Never even asked how was the food. And to top that off she finally came and asked if we wanted desert and was rushing us while choosing a desert she said are you ordering or not .
Florence L.,"Culver City, CA",519,515,209,4.0,5/13/2014,"I've been to this BJ's plenty of times and its always been great for me, but I guess I don't come when it's super busy either. The waitress was so awesome to make sure they changed the tv to the Kings game. My bf got their house brown ale and I got a kettle one apple martini. My martini was delish! Good job bartender! I ordered the Cherry chipotle Salmon, which I guess is a new item and seasonal, i think. The bf got the bbq chicken pizza, I was jelly. We had a few beers while watching the game and had a great experience again. They have a large menu and an Allergen menu for me, which is super cool. I'll be back I'm sure and i have no problem with that."
Enisha B.,"WOODLAND HLS, CA",106,249,25,3.0,1/31/2014,"I give three stars for the happy hour specials and some of the waitstaff. The bartender was a it rid and much more attentive to her regulars than the rest of us. My friend ordered an old fashioned and asked for lemons, cherries & oranges to be added and she replied ""yeah, that's how it's always made"". Then she debated with him about this when she brought the drink to him. I ordered a ""slim"" mojito and that was not the case. It tasted super sweet and syrupy so needless to say slim it was NOT. Definitely prefer BJs in Woodland Hills."
Jon G.,"Los Angeles, CA",65,266,24,3.0,7/18/2012,"Came here with my friend the other day. We were basically looking for a place to get food and drinks. I would normally never eat at a mall restaurant, but there really arent a lot of options in this part of town. I had the fish and chips, and my friend had a burger of some sort. Everything was pretty good, and the service was good when we had their attention. Getting that was a different story, but by no means horrible.  We split a pitcher of half cider half beer, which was pretty good, and saved us some money since neither of us wanted to spend a ton. We also split a desert. I think our total was about $20 each, so not bad but not great either. It was a bit loud, so talking was difficult. I definitely think they need to make some veggie options, not just salads and onion rings. Overall it wasnt a bad spot, but there really isnt anything spectacular about this place either. I think they are trying to push a brewery gimmick with house deserts. Everything else is pretty standard."
Marsha S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,16,,1.0,10/29/2013,"Do not go to this location if you require service for a large party. They assigned 1 waiter for a large group who seemed to have an attitude. Wonder why?  After 30 minutes of sitting with no food, drink, or appetizers, another person (position unknown) came over to our area and began to take orders or maybe to add her two cents. She was not warm, just abrasive and inept. Those people never received their drinks nor their food until she came back to ask, is everything ok? No. We don't have the drinks or food orders you took... If you cannot handle large parties...just say so. That is just not good for business. Please retrain  Ricardo and Mecca on customer service."
Anthony B.,"Los Angeles, CA",20,295,137,3.0,6/3/2014,Been here a few times. Consistent with other Bjs I have been too. Decent pizzas and craft beers. I also get the tomato soup and sandwich combos. Its ok.
David h.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,54,,1.0,6/16/2015,Traditional BJs service lacks at this location. The kitchen is slow and yes I know it takes a while for pizza. I would not waste my time at this location.
Pilar S.,"Los Angeles, CA",113,3,2,1.0,9/27/2015,"Horrible service, when we arrived we requested a booth and were told that we had to wait, which was understandable so we did. When it was time for us to be seated we were taken to a table not the booth we waited for, we were told that our booth was given away and we had to wait for another one. When we were seated we waited over an hour for our food and when it came it was the wrong order and looked nothing like what was on the menu. The manager eventually came to the table and offered to help and brought back 2 soups and chips and salsa in which the chips were stale when I asked if he could help us out with the bill by at least taking a $10 appetizer off of my $40 bill, he refused and tried to offer me cupons...pshhh like I would ever go back there. I would give this 0 stars if I could."
