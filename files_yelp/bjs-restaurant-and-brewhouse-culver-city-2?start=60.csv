Nijole T.,"Los Angeles, CA",3080,6372,5149,2.0,1/20/2017,"Never by choice do I end up at BJs. I lalways leave thinking it was not worth worth the money or calories here. We shared a thin as well as a thick crust pizza and a few apps, which were horribly overpriced for the quality and portion size. The thick crust pizza was the best thing here, but not worth the 45 minute wait. The staff was also not the best, long waits on refills and food. Vibe and decor is like any other chain restaurant, loud and cramped. Much better dining options in the area."
Paul James V.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,9,2,5.0,9/16/2017,I just would like to commend Jose G. for being such an excellent server tonight. He made sure that our food came out quick and also checked in on our table regularly. Keep up the good work. The service in this location has been consistently superb!
Nick F.,"Los Angeles, CA",281,17,1,5.0,9/22/2017,Had the Alfredo and the carrot appetizer thing and they were incredible. Desiray and Kyle working behind the bar were incredible. Great service and very pleasant to be around.
Yvon Meow J S.,"Beverly Hills, CA",705,268,1633,4.0,1/16/2016,"We were so hangry and was passing by the mall so decided to try this BJs.  Btw, this is my first time ever to try this chain. Maybe it's a hit or miss with such a low stars review.  We had a pretty good experience that I believe it had a lot to do with our waitress.  She was very busy but she kept coming back to our table and made sure our water was filled and we were fine the entire time! We ordered the soup & salad (lunch all you can eat!! Yay) and the soup was clam chowder for $8.50 and mini pizza & house salad for $7.25.  The pizza is one topping beside the cheese and tomatoes so we opted for sausage.   To our surprise, the chowder was delish, and the mini pizza was cooked just right.  With good food and service, I had to give this place 5 stars with one minus star, parking.  Not only it was confusing and it was hard to find a spot.  So this BJ's is recommended!!"
Janine M.,"Metairie, LA",45,63,19,1.0,1/22/2017,Busboy cleaned the floor and 5 seconds later wiped down a table WITH THE SAME TOWEL! I will not return.
Craig W.,"Inglewood, CA",108,180,189,3.0,3/21/2017,The service was ok it took a little longer than expected. The food was decent. There wasn't anything really flashy that would make me come running back for more. There are to many other choices in walking distance from this place.
Corina R.,"Westchester / LAX, Los Angeles, CA",59,345,202,4.0,7/17/2016,This place is always packed. If we are going to eat here we try to eat at off hour peak times. The staff is very friendly and the restaurant seems to be clean. I was glad to see they offer a lighter fare menu. They post all calorie contents on the menu. I really like that about the restaurant. My only complaint is that service tends to be a little slow. But other than that the food was good and our waiter was very nice.
Justn C.,"Culver City, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/3/2017,Terrible service food took an hour to get here.... Then the MANAGER KYLE MW/30. was inconsiderate and not understanding of the situation his customers were in and provided zero to no solutions to the problem his restaurants created... never going to this BJs again.. would not recommend you coming here...
Patti C.,"Austin, TX",46,18,8,5.0,2/26/2017,"For the price food is good, served hot. Service was excellent. Pasta with shrimp and asparagus with garlic knots is very tasty. My husband ordered peanut chicken with soba noodles and it was very tasty as well. Portions are nice size."
Steven L.,"Garden Grove, CA",171,6,17,4.0,6/11/2017,"Came to this BJs because the trip to Santa Monica from my weekend classes was starting to really make me hungry. The service was okay, my drinks were refilled quickly, but I wasn't told much information about whether the crafted sodas were free refills. They are, luckily. I ordered the pasta & liked how they could accommodate for additional ingredients without charge. My partner got the pizza but I felt it was very unfilling at the time. Maybe some other time, because apparently BJs is known for their pizza! Next time, next time ~"
Elizabeth G.,"Long Beach, CA",0,1,,2.0,11/27/2017,"This was literally are spot to go to until yesterday. The food was great like always. Everything was prefect. Until it came to pay. She brought us our bill. My boyfriend and I  decided to pay through that app because it really more convenient then wait for them to pick up the bill and wait to get it back. The waitress. Ask my boyfriend if the bill was ready to go he said yes and told her we were paying through the app. But she didn't hear and we didn't thought much of it.  We paid through the app and causally walking away from our table 404. While we were causally walking through the mall to get out to the parking lot we get stop by the security telling us to hold up. My boyfriend and I were lost thinking we had to drop something, until the waitress pop up  and telling security  to help her take us to her manager because we didn't pay.  I was shock. That when my boyfriend told her Noo, we pay through the app and she was looking at the recite saying we didn't. I did let her know that my boyfriend clearly told her he was paying through he app. But she was rude and still assuming we didn't. As my boyfriend pull up the history pay on the app she didn't say anything anymore as she was trying to pull up on her system. I told her we can go back the restaurant and said it was fine but next time to let her know all rude.  And left as security only apologize for the inconvenience .   This situation should've been handle completely differently.  But it was not . She didn't even apologize for chasing us down Or anything.  She should've thought to check cause they do have an app to pay or atleast ask us if we paid through the app, instead of assuming that we didn't pay. It was the most embarrassing thing  I ever had to deal with. Because we aren't the type of people to walk away from a bill. Especially when it our place to go to."
Khoi P.,"Sydney, Australia",397,257,849,3.0,6/5/2016,Pretty large pub restaurant at one of the entrances to Westfields Culver City. I happened upon this establishment on my last day in LA with a number of hours to kill before my flight back to Australia. The NBA play-offs were on so this place was more than suitable with their numerous large tv screens. I asked to be seated at a table with a clear view of a tv and the hostess happily obliged.  I ordered a drink and a serving of Sriracha dry rub buffalo wings. These were spicy and well fried with the outside crispy and the inside still moist. I would suggest not rubbing your eyes while eating these as the dry rub is very spicy. The place was doing a pretty good turn over however I was never rushed to finish up and I was able to sit and enjoy the entire basketball game before moving on.
Gus C.,"Los Angeles, CA",32,122,276,5.0,12/13/2016,"It's really hard to give this place a really bad review. The service is great, the beer and drink options are great, and their new menu caters to all tastes. It's really great that they have the $25 for two dinner option, which includes a large pizza. My all time favorite is pairing a pizza with a seared ahi tuna and wasabi salad."
Edith P.,"Culver City, CA",0,1,,1.0,10/18/2017,Worst BJs ever! Costumer service is horrible.The waiter was really rude. The food took one hour to be in our table and when it got there the order was wrong. Not coming back to this Bjs.
Jenn J.,"Lakewood, CA",393,8,34,5.0,4/1/2017,I love bj's I actually just left this restaurant and our server Desmia was awesome. So friendly and accommodating. 5 stars for her service alone
Liz S.,"Upland, CA",131,17,44,5.0,5/3/2017,Customer service at this BJ's location is totally awesome from the time we walked in the door right to the time we walked out they are so nice and friendly here! It was just a quick stop on our way to LAX A quick bite to eat and a drink. My food was awesome thank you BJ's and Kathleen great customer service!
Britney M.,"Carson, CA",17,3,8,2.0,1/28/2017,"Let me preface this by saying that I'm so dissatisfied that I am typing this review sitting at a table in the restaurant.  For an appetizer we had the queso dip. The dip was bland. Some of the chips were chewy, not crispy.  For my entree I had the Deep Dish Ziti: house made meatballs, Italian sausage, diced pepperoni, marinara, cheese and fresh basil. When it arrived it looked like the picture. I was pleased with the flavor on the first bite. However, there was only a hint of Italian sausage. I took a few more bites and, to my disappointment, that's all there was: a hint of Italian sausage. I guess they ran out of meatballs and pepperoni. There were none in the entire deep of the dish.  My mom got the pulled pork sandwich. The hunks of pork were so large I think I heard them ""oink."" And instead of the meat being in the bbq sauce, it came on the side in a little sauce cup that barely covered the sandwich. And the ""crispy"" onion strings were not crispy at all. The fries were lukewarm. They brought her more bbq sauce when she asked but she has had better pulled pork sandwiches at other BJs locations.  There were 4 other people in our party. I guess they were ok with their meals. Or maybe they were just so buzzed they didn't notice the mediocrity on the plates in front of them.  Moral of this story (TL;DR): if you want to enjoy your meal, be drunk first."
Aron S.,"Whittier, CA",0,3,,1.0,10/8/2017,Came just for a pazzookie. Waited an hour. Server kept saying it's coming out. After an hour I told them if it's not coming just cancel and give me the check for my beer. They have me my check and said they don't know what happened to the Pazzookie. Wasted my time.
Brian M.,"Culver City, CA",38,50,,4.0,9/10/2017,"This review covers two experiences with the BJ's at the Fox Hills Westfield Shopping Center.   Experience #1 was a delivery.  I'd rate it a 3.  The fish and chips were a mixed bag.  The fish was good.  Properly seasoned, moist and tender.  The chips were another story.  Cold and soggy.  The salad was a tiny bit wilted but okay. Experience #2 was a visit on a Saturday evening for the prime rib special.  It was outstanding, and definitely a 5.  Salad was fresh, prime rib was prepared perfectly and the rice pilaf was adequate.  The dessert is still in my freezer, waiting for the right moment. I will return."
Lauren Y.,"Redondo Beach, CA",93,203,6,4.0,12/7/2016,Why the bad reviews on this place?? We sat at the bar to watch the raiders game and the Asian bartender guy was so super cool!! The atmosphere was good and our food came out quickly. I ordered from the lower calorie menu and had the lemon thyme chicken with brussel sprouts and peppers (but swapped the brown rice for fries so no longer low calorie). My restaurant companion had the steak and mashed potatoes and a beer. The chicken was really tender and cooked perfectly and the fries were awesome! I would definitely order this again. My diet coke was constantly refilled which was nice. Located inside the mall over by Olive Garden on the Target side.
