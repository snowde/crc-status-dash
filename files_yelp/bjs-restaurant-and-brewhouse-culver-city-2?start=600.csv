Dragoness L.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,23,,2.0,9/9/2011,"In by 9:00..out by 11:48.  Last night was my 20th birthday. As it was mid-week, my sister and I decided to hold off until the weekend to really celebrate but we still wanted to go out and enjoy a nice meal. I wavered between the Rainbow Bar & Grill, Houston's and BJ's. But, I'd been hearing about BJ's for years now and a lot more since this location opened its doors so I decided to go there.  We finally walk in at 9:00 after arriving at the mall about 10 mins prior. The 10 minutes was spent trying to find parking within a reasonable distance. When first make our way through the revolving doors the rather dry hostess summons a server who directs us to our seats. We're then lead, (at a run) to the other side of the restaurant. The floor was slippery and--since I had on heels--very difficult to navigate. (I am not exaggerating, we actually witnessed our waitress and one patron slip and fall at separate times during the night.) After we're seated--quite out of breath from the jog we'd just been lead on might I add-- we're greeted by a waitress (Whom will be referred to as Rihanna's Forehead, or RF) who hands us out menus and disappears. She appears 15 minutes later to take our drink and appetizer orders. We then waited another 20 more minutes for the simple drinks and appetizers to arrive. Then, a chipper waitress named Nadia finally arrived with our drinks...but not the food. After handing us our drinks, she looks confused when we ask about our meals. She had no idea we even ordered anything. There is some discussion, some skepticism and some fact checking and Nadia returns with a manager. We explain that we ordered our food by now nearly an hour ago and had seen neither hide nor hair of it since then.  RF, our original waitress returns moments later, as if on cue with our orders. We were grateful, the manager (a friendly older blonde woman) apologized and skirted off. Shortly, we realized the food was cold. My sister's burger was hard and room temp at best and my chicken fried steak was more chicken fried ..breaded greasy mess. My mashed potatoes were downright icy and my other sides weren't even on the plate. We spoke with RF after calling over a busboy and attempting to locate her. She apologized, brought out my veggies and more mashed potatoes and took my sister's burger away, obviously to be microwaved.  I tasted my food. Both the steak and the mashed potatoes were were bland but somehow over-peppered. I thought the fact that there was cheese in the mash would have saved it but all it did was make it a cheesy, peppery mess.  NEVER AGAIN."
Maya H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,13,,1.0,9/22/2014,"We walked in on a Sunday and did not realize this is the place for large after church groups. The host/hostess had no idea what they were doing, they were like scattered chickens with their heads cut off. People were being sat down randomly without any order. After we sat down we waited 15 minutes without any service not even a glass of water from the waiter. We actually walked out and informed the manager about the lack of service and she just shrugged her shoulders. We decided to have lunch next door to Lucille's bbq. This is the place you go to experience slow, rude and absolutely atrocious service."
Carla M.,"Hawthorne, CA",0,7,1,5.0,9/21/2014,"This restaurant is one of the best! We had amazing sliders, Mediterranean pizza and some wine. The sliders had string fries cooked perfectly.  The pizza had Grilled chicken breast, basil pesto, roasted garlic, Kalamata olives, sun-dried and seasoned feta cheese and sliced peperoncinis. AMAZING!"
Bri W.,"Los Angeles, CA",53,40,,4.0,6/15/2012,"The worst thing about this place was that we came during one of the games where the Kings were loosing. In my Kings jersey I was psyched to be there and hopefully watch them win, unfortunately they didn't but ultimately they still won later. The food was actually very good and it was one of the few times I couldn't finish my food. I had some mushroom burger and my bf had the Cajun jambalaya - both delicious.  The service was ehhh. Out server went on break halfway through so we kept having to call other servers to refill drinks, bring to-go boxes, and get the check.  Overall it was pretty fun to be in the environment with lots of Kings fans and just having a good time."
Tim R.,"Los Angeles, CA",206,85,14,4.0,5/12/2014,"The service was very prompt and polite. I will not, however, order the Chicken Lettuce Wrap appetizer again. While I understand it is an ""appetizer "" and not a meal, for $10 I expect a little more than a soup cup full of the chicken/chestnut/ onion /celery mix that makes up the lettuce wrap. It was facetious to give us 7 large lettuce leaves when the mix only made 2 modest wraps"
Scott G.,"Los Angeles, CA",102,135,27,1.0,5/1/2014,"Let me start by saying I love OTHER BJ's but this one is TERRIBLE! There's something seriously going wrong with this particular one with the quality of food, there must be some kind of BJ's corprate quality control or protocol that they are completely disregarding. I ordered a burger medium and it came PAST well done and more sad and flat than a McDonald's burger- I sent it back but it came back only slightly better but still flat and sad! My Mom ordered a Cobb salad and it looked like 99.8% lettuce and .2% of the good stuff. It was so bad i'll never go back ever to this BJ's. All the other one's I've been to were great, someone needs to call Corporate because this place is giving a bad name to all other BJ's :("
Shannon C.,"Albuquerque, NM",801,647,1222,1.0,12/17/2009,"Brunch is horrible. $6 for white toast and cold scrambled eggs. $8 for a decent mimosa, though."
Christine Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",388,534,511,2.0,10/14/2009,"The other location in Westwood is better. Well maybe it's just opening bugs, but I docked stars for the food also.  Service-Okay bordering on spotty. The wait was estimated 45 minutes, but it turned out to be 25, which is much better. Waiter was nice, but wasn't round much. I was left wondering if we even had one when he didn't come around at first. He basically did the usual stops. Atmosphere-like the other BJ's but more room. The bathroom was out of toilet paper though and had water all over the floor. Bad if the bathroom isn't nice and clean and kept up. Food- Ordered the BJ's fave deep dish pizza and the garden medley salad. Pizza was okay, wasn't too bad, but I wish it had more toppings on it. Salad was most horrible salad I've ever had in years from a restaurant. Yea, so BJ's isn't known for salads, but I figure their other stuff is good and usually loaded with stuff, so prolly the salad is the same way. 9 dollars for slightly wilted browning lettuce that probably came out of a bag, some chopped tomatoes, feta cheese, red peppers, red onion, and then 3 small pieces of artichokes, and vinagrette. A very very sad salad, portion wasn't huge, was decent but I can't believe how bad it was. If they have it on their menu, they should at least use fresher ingredients and put more into their salad! Other restaurants that don't specialize in salad do a much better job and at least chop their own lettuce.  And thats that. I hope the service and everything gets better once they have been open longer."
Justin B.,"Los Angeles, CA",90,130,401,3.0,2/14/2010,"Came in here for a friends 21st Birthday Party and it turned out to be a pretty nice time. I had never been here so I was of course suspect, but it was a pretty nice looking place (though it better be, its brand new!) We had a party of about 15 people and called ahead same day to make the reservation. Our waiter was definitely working the ladies at the table for a large tip, even though an 18% gratuity was added on due to the size of our party. I started out with a Long Island, as usual, while we were waiting for more of the guests to show their faces. needless to say, it held me over quite nicely till more people arrived and we started ordering food. By that time i had finished it so I ordered another along with a Pulled Pork BBQ Sandwich with steak fries (potato skins) The pork was pretty good, very juicy but not as full of flavor as i would have liked. The steak fries were perfect though and i could have eaten a lot more of those. My individual bill came out to about $25-30 for my two drinks and sandwich. our bill for the whole party.. well that was pretty large haha, but i have to say it was a pretty nice place to have our friends 21st b-day dinner. A-OK!"
Jeff H.,"Los Angeles, CA",476,473,1326,1.0,11/3/2009,"Same great tasting BJ's food and good lunch menu prices. Standard BJ's ambiance + decor.  BUT truly horrible food delivery time. It's sad that the manager must be involved at every experience we've had here. To be fair, the manager did make amends by comping one of our lunch items. Don't go here if you have a short lunch break. It will take more than one hour guaranteed. I really want this location to improve, would eat here once a week easily."
Angel M.,"Compton, CA",31,70,19,2.0,11/10/2013,Never again....I should have known better. My first experience at this BJ's was also poor! And how does a large chain like this run out of butter?
Ina G.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,20,4,1.0,7/6/2014,Terrible experience waited 1 hour to get seated they took 2 hours to serve are food. When my family member received his food it was cold.....terrible experience I won't be going their again........stay away...  This place gave me a bad taste in my mouth......stay away...
Sean B.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",0,16,,1.0,9/9/2013,"Horrible service!!!!!!!! As I wrote this  at 10:05pm my family & I are still waiting for our food!!! Our waitress keeps on passing by without giving us refills on our water,hasn't not been back to let us know why the long wait when it's clearly that this bullshit ass place is pretty empty,it doesn't make any sense.Honestly I do not recommend this location to anyone!! But before I leave I will be speaking to a manager!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Alex W.,"Hawthorne, CA",65,12,2,1.0,9/22/2011,"We were deciding between BJ's and Lucilles... gf wanted pizza so we decided to check it out.  We waited for 10 minutes to be seated, expected.  But what we did not expect was for the waiter to take 5 minutes to get to us, then after we ordered avocado rolls and pizza, the ""appetizer"" should have came to us.  After 30 minutes, we had to ask one of the waiters where our food was.  5 minutes later, he comes out to apologize.  When we got our pizza 40 minutes later, we had already asked one of the other waiters to cancel our appetizer, then our waiter comes to our table and INSISTS that we reconsider, as in he asked us ""are you SURE you didn't want the avocado rolls?""  My gf and I were not too happy about this, and we just said no politely, even though both of us were visibly upset.  He even had the nerve to ask us TWICE, as if we made a mistake.   It just made us feel bad.   And the people around us got their food a long time later too.  The fact that he tried to get us to accept the 40 minute appetizer was insulting, and typically when something like this happens other restaurants offer somethign on the house or apologize, but he gave us a guilt trip by saying how he had to go cancel it now and it was the chef's fault for making it so late and he didn't know what was going on.  It doesn't take 35 minutes to apologize for the food not coming.   And to top it off, they made us wait another 20 minutes after finishing our pazookie to give us the check.  I paid in cash and gave a 4 dollar tip, which was quite generous.  I'm usually a big tipper, so to have me tip barely 10% means you did something wrong.  I've been to other BJ's before, but this is the first and last time I'm going to this one.  No wonder it has 2 stars on Yelp. Oh yeah, and we never got a refill on our drinks.  We just wanted to get out of there quickly."
Jameela F.,"Los Angeles, CA",210,3,,1.0,7/22/2014,"Worst service on a Tuesday night consistently. 30 min just to tk our order. I attend a business meeting across the street and will go to BJs after. Meals come b4 ur appetizers, food is cold and it takes forever to get served. I am in the restaurant now. And i was even polite when i complained. ..no urgency. .very disappointing"
Keirsten A.,"Bishop, CA",0,9,1,2.0,7/19/2015,"Slow, rude service. We watched two tables get their food and finish while we still waited. Our server was pushy about us paying the bill before we even got our food. Not impressed"
Claudia Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,,1.0,4/3/2013,"I came here to celebrate my sons 16th b day !!!!! And to my disappointment,  the food wasn't that good and the worst part we waited a long time to get sitted n the service was terrible,the waiters  couldn't handle the volume of customers...not coming here ever again"
Aaron M.,"San Francisco, CA",324,760,78,4.0,12/2/2009,"Whoa why people be hatin on the BJs? They are known for their red beer and pizookie but really the 'za is where it's at.  We got the ""BJs classic combo"" which i think was pepperoni, sausage and shrooms, and it was medium holyshitorgasmic good.  They put butter  AND sugar in that pizza dough or something.  It was so good that we got fresh pizza the next day, but the reheated BJs was better.  Yeah, really, sloppy second BJs are better than non-BJs.  The BBQ pulled pork sandwich was pretty solid also - but watch out - they put cheese on it unannounced! I love the hate this location is getting in their reviews.  Something like ""I hate that it is so good that it is so popular that I had to wait a long time."" Um, OK."
Diana S.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,10,,3.0,9/24/2012,"My hubby and I tried it last week, we wanted a place with good ambiance. Food is ok, get the beer my drink was watered down, the Pzookie's are good. Our waiter really seemed like he was in a bad mood. We got the 2 for $20 deal. That is why I gave it 3 stars.  Parking sucks at this mall."
Hassan W.,"Inglewood, CA",100,17,4,1.0,9/27/2013,Came to get food and leaving. Service was horrible. DO NOT GET waitress Pippa is horrible. I sat in my seat and received no service for about 30 min and was never asked if I wanted water or anything. When I usually come I usually use the waiter Patrick and this is the first time that I sat in here section and must say was so bad that I didn't even order and left Restaurant hungry and irritated with my guest.
