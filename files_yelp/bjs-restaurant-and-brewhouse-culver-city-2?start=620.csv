Stephanie R.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",59,142,952,1.0,3/31/2014,"Disappointed with this BJs, service was horrible the food is all greasy not to mention the prices are to much for the greasy food you receive. The happier hour menu is not a happy hour menu but a greasy selection with high calories.  The Draft beer selection is the only thing worth will therefore my recommendation is go somewhere else and save your time and $."
Angel C.,"Los Angeles, CA",30,28,16,4.0,6/12/2014,"I love this place, yes it's a bit ghetto, but once you get over it it's a cool place to watch games and grab something to eat.. I love the beer selection.  Oh and I hate the parking spaces."
Jason R.,"Visalia, CA",93,123,265,3.0,3/24/2010,"Good place to watch the game.  Any game.  Lots of TV's, good beers, happy hour specials.  Great for groups and kids. The food is ehhh.  My burger was good, but didn't really blow me away.   I'd come back, but it'd be for happy hour while watching some sort of sports game."
Luke D.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,17,,5.0,8/15/2014,"Vibe: Clean and nice looking restaurant.  Service: I've been more than 5 times and only once did we have a low quality serve. Last night we had a very attentive and quick server for a family birthday. Food: Pizza's are awesome, especially the 5 meat, chicken ranch, and Mediterranean. Avacado egg rolls are a new favorite app.  Price: Higher than some chains but better quality food and atmosphere. Worth it."
Phoenicia H.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,4,,1.0,11/10/2014,"Once again, BJ's has let me down. I can honestly say that if I could give zero stars I would, but the star is for our waitress.  I went here with a group of 10 people, and without a reservation, we were seated pretty quickly. The staff was very considerate, considering we didn't make a reservation. After being seated, my friend and I decided to sample their beers. Our waitress was very nice (I can't remember her name), and she kept up with us even though we were all over the place. After taking our orders, we waited the standard amount of time, around 10-15 minutes, for our food to be brought out. My friend and her sister ordered the wings, and on our tables first bites, we realized the wings were not only cold, but they were undercooked!!! Our waitress apologized several times, and brought us new wings, that were fresh from the fryer. I ordered the crispy potatoe skins, which were good, but nothing to write home about. Another person who was with us ordered wings for her meal, and her wings were cold as well. The waitress apologized once more, and brought new wings out again. At this point, I was so done with this place, and I realized why I didn't like it...it's overrated and disgusting. After leaving, my friend and I were literally sick to our stomachs. Oh yeah, my friend's mother found a piece of plastic in her food. I don't think I will be going to BJs in the future."
Arlene T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,9,2,1.0,12/1/2014,"Ok I have tried and tried to give this place a 4th and now 5th chance to rectify their mistakes. Only because this place is closest to work and home. Dining in, ordering for pickup/curbside and today walking in to the bar and ordering ... Each and every time our orders are WRONG. Someone did not put in an order. Someone misplaced our order. Only to finally receive the food and have it be incorrect. And the nerve of the employees to have a bad attitude when asked to correct the order."
tae k.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",158,806,6,4.0,2/24/2010,This is a new BJs that opened recently since the renovation of the Fox Hills mall to a Westfield.  I have been here twice.  Lots of space.  TV's everywhere.  The staff is friendly but I would avoid it when it is busy. Good selection of brews.  My favorite is the Jeremiah Red. I've had the BBQ Chix and the Spinach & Artichoke.  The BBQ was  good but the Spinach & Art was bland.   The pizookie makes it
Micole C.,"Los Angeles, CA",47,230,45,2.0,10/29/2011,Went back 2 days ago in actual restaurant..and womppp..so short & to the point my friend said her lettuce was old lol i know it sounds crazy but she had to send it back. my lettuce in my salad was extra soggy but im more tolerable than here I had the cajun pasta that was really bland...i really expected and explosion of flavors but i was wrong. the worst..the waitress..we literally had to hunt her down to ask for things..whenever we did finally come across her and ask for things she would come back without them ! my friend literally after asking our waitress twice for lemons and her returning twice without lemons...had to walk over to the bar and asked for a plate of lemons smh..  i may give this place one more chance but i surely can pass on it
Dan P.,"Seattle, WA",384,617,230,3.0,4/22/2012,This is in the mall.  Parking is a pain so I usually end up parking in the structure or valet. The food is fairly typical of the BJ's chain.  It's not bad but not necessarily good either.  Our server was fine and attentive.
Joey C.,"Culver City, CA",0,10,,2.0,6/2/2011,"Okay, firstly, A+ on everything. The food is AMAZING. It's moderately priced. It's a good atmosphere, as good as a sports bar in the fox hills mall can be, and the staff is SO NICE. BUT I hate the managers of this place so much, with such a fat passion. They've created of policy of carding ABSOLUTELY EVERYONE NO MATTER WHAT.  This really sucks. I NEVER EVER EVER get carded. NEVER. It's been years. You know why? Because I look old. I look VERY old, to the point where on multiple occasions people have mistook my girlfriend for my daughter. But, religiously, no matter how many times I come here I get carded.  This sucks because sometimes I come from the gym or am late to meet a buddy here, and I don't like to carry excessive stuff in my pockets, like an ID I never have to whip out because I look so old. So many times I've either had to walk all the way to my car or not order beer. I don't know if this is a corporate policy or what but it really ruins my experience. Come on guys, at SOME POINT common sense HAS to trump corporate policy. Otherwise, there is just no point in human civilization."
Mr. Travon B.,"Hawthorne, CA",10,33,30,1.0,3/21/2014,"I came to BJ's with some friends of mine before my flight to New York. I ordered the Grilled Chicken Pasta. As I waited on my meal to come, the server brought the out drinks out then right after proceeded to bring our meals out. My meal was bland,and with no CHICKEN!! I told the server that my meal didn't have the grilled chicken and he said he would come back with it. 25 minutes passed and still no chicken. Once the waiter came back to the table I gave him back the plate his response was ""Oh they didn't bring the chicken out"" NO! There was no chicken and NO there was no apology. Pooooo"
Jesse W.,"Los Angeles, CA",46,9,15,1.0,10/7/2014,"I've been here on several different occasions and each time the service is slower than the last. This isn't reason enough to give such a low rating typically but tonight's experience was the most irritating. We ordered take out and showed up approximately 20 minutes later, I was anticipating a wait. We soon discover our order was not put in and have to wait for our order, now sitting in the waiting area thus negating calling ahead for take out. Also the worker at the take it desk did nothing to figure out what happened to our order we spoke to a man on the phone and all the lady did to ""assist"" was say ""no men are working here tonight"". We discovered shortly after that the already hard to believe statement that not one single man worked at that location was false as we saw several men walking around the location working. Finally got the food and hastily went home only to find out they didn't put the correct toppings on my burger. Never returning to this Bjs location, the last straw for me."
Chuck H.,"Redmond, WA",43,35,,1.0,6/26/2013,"Worst service of any BJ's I've ever been to.  45 minutes for a soup and salad?  That's not ""unlimited"" by any reasonable definition.  Manager was surly and unhelpful.  Terrible staff, terrible excuses, didn't comp anything despite a spectacularly crappy performance."
Kye T.,"Westchester / LAX, Los Angeles, CA",161,59,11,4.0,3/7/2015,"I love B.J's! I was excited to go back after so long. They've always had really good pizza and this is one of the only two places I order beer. Their Double Berry cider is so yummy! It's a mix of Berry Punch Cider and Frambroise & it doesn't even taste like beer! We tried the Loaded Potato Wedges which were tasty and my favorite, a medium size Chicken Bacon Ranch. The crust on their pizzas is too die for, so crispy and you can taste garlic. My son had the ""Create your Own"" meal. His corn dogs and French fries were standard but he did get a good helping of each. The only qualm we have is with the service. I stepped away to the bathroom minutes before my name was called to be seated. I was away for less than 5 minutes and they gave my table away! No apology was given either. We also ordered a drink that never came & it took forever for us to get our bill and cash out. Another server actually had to take our check from us. Other than that, the food was great but I hope we have a more attentive server next time."
Debbie C.,"Hawkins, TX",4,32,,4.0,4/21/2014,"My husband and I decided to try BJ's for dinner and we had a great experience. Our server was fantastic!! Her name is Taj (like Taj Mahal). She was so great and attentive. The food was very good, atmosphere was nice...all in all it was very pleasant and we're happy we finally went!"
Mark M.,"Los Angeles, CA",41,16,2,2.0,7/10/2013,Ok I shouldn't complain but the server was training a new guy and when it all came down they did the best they could of. I like the Thai Shrimp Wraps they dd taste good but I had to wait 30mins for the food and the Salmon my wife ordered looked like it had fallen off the plate and they tried to pass it for ok. I did have to have them remake her dish but after they did the salmon was almost perfect (just needed more spice for my wife's liking).
Heidy R.,"Carson, CA",1,39,,1.0,7/17/2012,"I give the the restaurant a one star. but our waitress 10 stars if I could. Her name was Kaiya? i believe. Well let me tell you. Me and my coworkers waited for about an hour and nobody had come to attend us, not even ask for our drinks. It was around 11pm, we had just gotten off of work and were starved and after that long wait we were extremely irritated. We had discussed how whoever was gonna be our waitress wasnt gonna get a tip, and we were gonna complain. But then Kaiya showed up, and saved the day. Even with us showing her our frustration, she was able to turn the whole situation and apologized for the mixup. She handled the situation very well, and put all of us at ease. She was truly amazing and got our orders in ASAP after all that wait. Her customer service was above and beyond and we appreciated it and we actually changed our minds about the no tipping  :D.... Now...the time before that..we came with a group of 8, which means the tip was already included. The guy that helped us was extremely rude to us [probably because he knew his tip was already there] .. so my recommendation ask for kaiya or dont show up in a group of eight.. and parking sucks butt here."
Jazmyn A.,"Lancaster, CA",2,17,5,1.0,12/6/2013,"The server's name is Steven and he is hispanic, he was the last person to have access to my card as well as my friend's card which was charged. Be aware! I wish I could give this negative stars. DO NOT GO TO THIS BJ'S. They had shady employee's who like to 1. charge your card for 1 amount 5 times. 2. Charge a different amount a few more times 3. Wait until you leave to charge the card again for another amount (the manager admitted that there was no signature for the charge) 4. steal your card information and go on a spending spree after work. BJ's HAS NOT made an effort to reverse these charges as they ""still looking into it"" The Bank statements don't lie. DO NOT EAT HERE, DO NOT USE YOUR CARD HERE, AND DO NOT TRUST THE SHADY ASS PEOPLE WHO ARE SERVING YOU! THE MANAGEMENT SUCKS AND THEY NEED TO DO BETTER. I wouldn't care if BJs went out of business from this particular location. This is the second poor experience I've had with BJ's as a company and I will continue to spread the news. The BBB is next. DO NOT TRUST THAT LOCATION."
Patty O.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,416,,2.0,1/10/2012,"Well like I said in my first review, I would give BJ's another chance when it was less crowded. Last night we went for a late dinner...not crowded at all...got a seat in a booth right away. The hostess and waitress were great-very attentive & took our drink & food order immediately. Then the wait...and wait and wait. It wasn't crowded at all but it took about 30 minutes for our small pizza to come out. And after all that, the pizza came out wrong. It wasn't how we ordered it. The waiter apologized but at that point, I was not going to wait another minute to eat after already waiting 30 minutes (it was 9pm). I won't be back anytime soon."
Rachel S.,"Los Angeles, CA",271,119,80,2.0,1/13/2012,"The food is edible.  I wouldn't come here out of my own will only if I'm invited for a 21st Birthday or something.  I've had better, and would rather go to a mom & pop shop than a corporate owned restaurant that has high amounts of sodium in everything.  I did leave very bloated thanks to the salt and stayed that way until the next morning."
