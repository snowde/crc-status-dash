Eliana A.,"Palos Verdes Peninsula, CA",11,19,3,1.0,6/6/2011,"W O W... There was a punkish styled overweight girl with black hair in the front, I suppose she was a hostess, she had a SKELETON hair clip in June on her head, and she was extremely rude. She didn't even look up at me and my coworkers as we walked in. Then she finally looked up and said ""I hope you're ready to wait."" I don't understand why some people are in this business if they have a ""I hate my life"" look on their face and treat people like dirt while they are working. This is a business! I am PAYING for a service! and YOU my dear are lucky you have a JOB! I was just apalled by her attidue and by her appearance.  Ugh.. well I must say that food was good, but i'll never patronize that specific BJ's again."
Eric M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,27,3,4.0,5/30/2014,"We've been here a couple of times and both of our visits were great.  We had a waitress (Taj) our first visit and she was very attentive, even though it was busy.  Our second visit was almost a mirror of the first and that was on Mother's Day!  Great service, great food and decent prices.  We'll be back!"
Roger L.,"Lancaster, CA",0,2,,5.0,7/2/2015,"Our waiter, Brian, did a great job to make us feel welcome. His suggestions on the menu were spot on. We loved the food. Overall, it was a very positive experience.  It's great to see someone who goes above and beyond to provide the best service possible.  Great job Brian."
Rosie O.,"Culver City, CA",3,33,28,4.0,8/7/2012,We've had a good time eating at this restaurant and they are very family friendly!  At times service can be slow but I'm usually there when you expect it to be busy Lunchtime and dinner time.  The wait is usually not that long I think the longest we have waited is 20 minutes.  I have not had any problems with food everything that I have ordered has worked well for us.  My only complaint is the kids Kraft mac and cheese we order him a side of the gourmet mac and cheese that is freshly made!
Craig H.,"Santa Monica, CA",3,14,,1.0,3/17/2016,"Well with our office only a mile or so up the hill we have tried BJ's time and again. While the food quality is ok, they just cannot serve an efficient lunch or get any order right. In fact the last time we went last Wednesday was the worst you could imagine. My law partner got the soup and salad and I got a turkey burger with a few changes as to the toppings. My law partner got his soup and salad before mine, which is fine, but twice I was assured that my turkey burger was coming out soon. After waiting 45 minutes the waitress asked if my law partner would like another salad and he said he did but not until my food came out. The manager then brought out my turkey burger but would not answer our question as to what went wrong.  Even worse, the waitress never came back to get my lunch companion to get his salad. And when I got the bill they only took my lunch off but not my law partner's who waited forever for my lunch and did not get the rest of his. We left a small tip and left. And never to be back again.  This has occurred time and time again and the kitchen and wait staff are unable to serve a business lunch where we can get back in an hour. We drive 15 minutes each way to La Dijonnaise and get our much better and less expensive lunch and are back before an hour passes. BJ's Culver City is a disgrace. My law partner was so offended that his lunch was not free after having to wait for an hour for me to eat. Outrageous."
Rory C.,"Alpharetta, GA",5,11,,5.0,3/25/2014,"Went there and had a great experience. We had a server, Britt, who is clearly a gem and someone this place should hold on to. She knew her stuff and was on top of every strange request we had. Will definitely return and request her again as our server. Also pizookies are amazing"
Irene V.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,26,8,1.0,8/10/2013,I have been to BJ's before and have never had an issue. At this particular location I had a really bad experience and really bad customer service. Im very dissapointed because overall I enjoy this restaurant for casual dinner. Me and my boyfriend were quickly seated. No waiter approched us to offer drinks or appetizers.After waiting about 30 miniutes I ask a bus boy to please send a waiter since we were ready to order. After waiting another 10 mins no one comes to our table so we get up and leave. I understand its saturday and you are busy but every customer is important. I would have a appreciated at least a glass of water..and just let me know your running late!
Pegah Y.,"Washington, DC",1447,2359,6598,1.0,2/27/2011,"This is the second ""1"" star that i've ever given, and I don't think it deserves even one star.   The experience at this BJ's was terrible.  I have been to other BJ's and every other BJ's experience has been excellent.  However, this BJ's is just absolutely terrible...  I came here with a friend to celebrate her med school acceptance.  We were really excited for a night out.  She ordered a pizza and I ordered a large clam chowder soup.  The soup ended up coming in a very small cup!  I asked if taht was a large and they said that it was.  I can't even imagine what the small cup would look like.  But it didn't stop there - I couldn't even eat the soup!  It was EXTREMELY salty.  It tasted like someone had dumped a bunch of salt in there.  My friend's pizza was much smaller than that size of pizza usually is at the other BJs. We decided to get a pizookie and hoped that it would be better, but it was an extremely small pizookie!  I've had pizookies from the other BJs dozens of times and have loved it every time, but this pizookie was very small!  All the portions at this BJs were small!   The service was absolutely terrible!  it took a while for us to be served and when I told them my soup was too salty, they switched it out but it was still salty when they brought it back!  I really don't think that this is representative of BJ's restaurants in general.  In fact, my very next review is going to be about the BJ's in Westwood, which is absolutely excellent and which I've been going to for years.  But DO NOT go to the BJ's in Culver City.  It's seriously terrible and will most likely be a big waste of your time and money."
Tim L.,"Irvine, CA",115,34,8,4.0,1/28/2010,"Great if you're needing to get away from the office for a bit.  Happy hour Monday-Friday from 3-7pm. Half off mini pizzas, $2 off appitisers, and $1 off draft beers. Come right at 3 and it's not that busy. If you're going to have a late lunch, do it here."
Ellen S.,"Los Angeles, CA",28,86,,1.0,7/1/2011,"Always seems like a good idea to go - I LOVE chain sports bars like this - but this one is BAD. Never ends up being a good idea.  The food is ok, but sooo overpriced. And their ""specialty drinks"" should be called ""especially WEAK drinks."" Usually, the service so bad that it doesn't even really make me crabby, it just makes me laugh."
Daniel B.,"Huntington Park, CA",30,137,13,5.0,10/8/2013,"Came here with 6 college amigos.  We had the BBQ pizza and the Buffalo chicken pizza along with two pitchers of Oasis amber.  Good times, good times..."
Carli B.,"Torrance, CA",19,71,19,1.0,9/2/2013,"If it was possible to give this place negative stars I totally would. I came here with a couple of friends after going to a zombie walk. I was still in my zombie get up when arriving here. After waiting 10 min to be seated we were escorted to table that was in the very back and then we sat down, waited to get an order of drinks but no one came. There was a waiter at the table across from us that had gone back and fourth 4 or 5 times and never once stopped to ask if we'd been helped. We ended up walking out and going to the Olive Garden next door and got great service. I've never been treated so poorly as a willing and paying customer before."
Nolan A.,"Marina Del Rey, CA",0,30,6,1.0,5/9/2014,"Never again. And we used to like BJ's.  Such a shame this was handled incorrectly by the manager Andrew; hence this review. We went here today for lunch on 5/9/14 and got a nice BIG shiny piece of packaging in my caesar salad. Almost a 1/4 of the size of the salad. I mean this thing was HUGE... 4 inches x 2 inches... and metalic on one side and white on the other. Had I bit into this, I surely would have had some mouth injuries, let alone swallowed a piece of it. Thank God it was a LARGE piece and I easily found it. So regardless of the Kitchen oversight, the manager never apologized, never came over to the table to explain and offer anything except taking the entree off the bill. REALLY?!?! I get a big piece of metal and plastic in my salad and all you do is bring me another one? What the hell kind of restaurant is this? Did you really think I wanted another salad after your restaurant horribly decided to ruin a customer's appetite? I'm just sorry I didn't take a picture of it for all the other yelpers (I was without my phone). I think not and I'll never be back to another BJ's.  Time to remove ourselves from the restaurant chains... it's all about the family owned where this kind of stuff doesn't happen... AND if it ever does (would be a first for us), the manager comps the whole meal, offers deserts, entrees, coupons, whatever else in his power, and legitimately tries to fix the problem and make their customers happy. We received no such response from this manager. Grade: F"
Marcelle H.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",24,141,19,2.0,3/19/2011,"Food = meh Service = eh? Imagine if Denny's launched a sports bar franchise. That sums it up completely, but if you want to read further, feel free.  BJ's is a fine place to meet someone with young kids - no need to worry about being loud or spilling things.  The food is ok if you want something deep fried or dipped in ranch dressing. And the 3-year-old I meet here once a month always enjoys her fries and chicken tenders. She also likes the kid's menu and crayons. Her mom and I usually just pick at our food while we talk.  Today I decided to try brunch. The home-style potatoes were deep fried and there were no onions, peppers, or any other vegetables mixed in. Pretty much they were just cube-shaped french fries with some sort of seasoning salt. The scrambled eggs were over-cooked and crispy on the outside. The wheat toast was good, but was served without butter or jam. There was nothing else on my plate - just three tan piles of food. The servers make a show of speaking very polite and formal as if your wish is their command, but I always have to ask for essentials, and wait, and wait. The coffee was served not in a mug but in a bar glass because they were out of mugs, and they didn't bring spoons even though we requested cream and sugar. I did eventually get someone to bring us some jam for my toast, and ketchup - and the water we asked for when we first sat down.  I guess for the price, it's acceptable, and this is why I gave it two stars instead of one."
Danielle W.,"Bellflower, CA",7,6,3,1.0,4/9/2014,This place right here just pisses me off I try to give this place a chance ONE MORE TIME and they blew it if it wasn't for the manager of this place it would have got real ugly our first waiter was coming too the ending of his shift introduced us to our new waitress and that's when all the problems started she forgot we have more food coming out the kitchen we waited sooooooooo long for our food it was cold then she NEVER checked on us no refills for us cold food and when it's time to go we waited to 20mins for a check and 20mins for it to return we wasted OUR WHOLE DAY NEVER AGAIN
Kelly S.,"Los Angeles, CA",64,89,147,3.0,2/6/2012,"I give this place 3 stars not for the food, but for the service. A friend and I walked in and the woman taking take out orders just looked at us but didn't speak. We stood there for 2 minutes before I walked over to her and she told me that the woman working the front was off somewhere and would be back shortly. Just before we decided to walk out  a manager-like gentleman came out and seated us. We ordered our meals and the food was delicious. I ordered the rib eye steak with white cheddar mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables. Delicious!!! My only gripe was I only received what I considered a small portion of potatoes. My friend ordered one of the burgers, but didn't eat the bun so I helped myself to that. Tasty! If you can stand not so good service, but good food give'em a try."
Nathalie C.,"Santa Monica, CA",217,124,,2.0,2/24/2011,"We had a huge group of people for dinner and when my friend was making a reservation they were extremely sassy about taking us. First, all but two of our group were 21, we were going to be spending a lot of money on both drinks and food, so they should have been so happy to take us. When we arrived (with reservations) we had to wait a bit before we were actually seated. I understand it was a Friday night and we were a big group so I'll let that slide.  Once we were seated our waiter and waitress were really nice but they seemed to be really flustered the whole time. They messed up orders, brought the wrong food... I could tell they were trying hard and we were not the easiest group of people to serve, but it could have been a lot smoother.  I didn't give it a horrible rating because they tried hard and I understand their circumstances. I just think they shouldn't have started on the wrong foot when it came time to make a reservation. I probably wouldn't come back here again."
Nipa S.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,31,1,3.0,3/12/2014,Food was really good and parking is no problem. Pizookies  were delish! Definitely would have rated higher of the service wasn't so bad. Recommend If you don't mind chappy service and/or want some good grub.
Kevin S.,"Brea, CA",184,313,35,2.0,4/22/2011,This place has exceptionally crappy service compared to the handful of other BJ's I've been to. This BJ's is part of the Westfield mall in Culver City... unfortunately this leads to inconvenient parking relative to the restaurant location. I'm not surprised to see other comments for this particular location saying the service sucks. 2 stars because the food was on par with other BJ's.
Becky S.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,23,42,3.0,6/29/2012,"Come either before lunch rush or after it b/c the service seriously goes down hill during. Other than that the food is consistent with all other bj's. Yummy & predictable. The lunch specials are an excellent deal. I usually get the 1/2 baked potato & salad combo. The mini pizzas are also a good deal & you don't feel as FAT when you finish one... (i guess i can only speak for myself on that one)... My main & really only gripe about this place is the service. I've gotten a few servers with some attitude - mainly the girls by the way- & recently had to wait a long long time for someone to take our drink order- which is usually a deal breaker but predictably consistent good food is sadly hard to come by these days, so I'll be going back to bj's.  Oh yeah & I heard they do a great brunch so i'll be trying that out one of these days also."
