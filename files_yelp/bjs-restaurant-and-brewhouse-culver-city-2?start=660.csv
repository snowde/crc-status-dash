Johnson N.,"Los Angeles, CA",219,377,258,4.0,4/29/2011,"I have to agree with Henry C. about the average ratings for BJ's.  I've been to many BJ's, and I can usually expect to have good service, good food, and good beer.  As expected, the same happened here.   My friend and I decided to hit up BJ's to watch an NBA playoff game over a couple of beers.  As usual, I ordered the Blonde.. a light and very refreshing brew, specific to BJ's Brewery. To eat, I ordered the Scampi Pasta -Angel Hair pasta with olive oil, butter, garlic, a little lemon juice, and a choice of blackened or regular shrimp.  I went with the regular shrimp. Even though it is a pasta dish, it felt very light because it didn't have some kind of heavy sauce or heavy meats on it.  It was slightly tangy, from the lemon juice and tomatoes, and buttery with a hint of garlic.  I loved the combination of flavors with each bite. The atmosphere was definitely upbeat and fun to be in.   4 Stars."
Crystal K.,"Los Angeles, CA",32,178,15,1.0,1/15/2011,"Alright, I'm going to try to be friendly as possible.  The drinks = great. The food = spectacular. But the service absolutely totally SUCKS. We ordered a dessert, the strawberry beignet (which, by the way, is not a beignet; it's just fried bread dipped in sugar) and it took the server well over 20 minutes to tell us they ran out of strawberry syrup for it. 20 minutes??? For some strawberry syrup??? GTFOH. Whatever happened to common courtesy?  We ended up getting the dessert for free but it'll be a long time before we'll go back there. Diner Beware!"
Beatrice T.,"Los Angeles, CA",303,358,101,4.0,5/26/2011,"Good service, prompt delivery, and I'm in love with their deep dish pizzas. I don't even care about the toppings, their crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside crust is soooooo delish. (Cheeseburger and BJ's are muy bueno) Mango margarita was my favorite of the frozen margarita selection. White peach and strawberry were meh....  Comfortable sports bar setting with TV's all around so that I can see my Sharks lose. Sigh."
Daniel U.,"Los Angeles, CA",237,13,6,1.0,7/6/2013,Worst service ever. It is extremely extremely slow. Got in at 7 pm and got out at 10 pm not because it was really busy but because our server came once every hour to check on us. Food quality was terrible compared to other BJs. TERRIBLE DO NOT GO. #angrycustomer
Karissa M.,"San Diego, CA",11,24,5,1.0,8/5/2013,"I would never give a bad review unless it was HORRIBLE! And this place seriously needs to retrain their staff! I still couldn't tell you who our server was.. and it should never take 7 minutes to bring Parmesan cheese to a table, especially for a place that sells pizza!"
Sokey L.,"Santa Monica, CA",1191,327,158,3.0,12/16/2010,"The bf and I were craving a pazookie one Friday night after dinner and decided to go to BJs. I've never been to this BJ's location before and was surprised that the crowd was very... ghetto fabulous? I never imaged that crowd being in Culver City, but it is next Inglewood. Go figure. We sat that the bar because we didn't want to wait. They have flat screen TVs everywhere along the perimeter. We got the pazookie... A+, like always. They have tons of beers on tab. Lots of different appetizer. Service was very fast and friendly. A-Ok place. 3 stars because their menu is mediocre at best. But everyone knows you go to BJs for the atmosphere and pazookie, not the food. I like their Great White Pizza though. Good crust!"
Eric R.,"Whittier, CA",94,406,19,3.0,12/13/2011,"I have been to this location I believe 2 times with my insignificant other and have had good experiences both times. Their beer selection is awesome right now (winter time) they have some pretty good specialty beers to choose from, don't be afraid to try some new ones. Food is always up to par and I recommend their Ahi Tuna appetizer. Good place to go every once in awhile to get some decent pizza and a decent environment."
Landis S.,"Los Angeles, CA",101,67,6,2.0,7/26/2011,"The first two times I've gone here were great. Granted it was closer to when this location opened but despite some steep prices, my wife and I had a great time out. Food was okay and the wait staff were friendly.  The last two times I've managed to land straight out jerks as servers. It killed my mood and my buzz. I shouldn't have to expect attitude when I go ANYWHERE!!  Hey, if you hate your job... QUIT! My wife was a waitress for several years and there's no excuse for unprofessional attitudes. It's your job to be friendly, A**HOLES.   I will definitely think twice about going back."
Namya S.,"Chino, CA",3,21,6,1.0,8/13/2013,"This used to be one of my favorite places until I ordered to go the other today. My Parmesan crusted chicken was made quicker than the shrimp tacos and they had my chicken chillin in a little oven for 20 minutes. Asked for the manager...he was not accommodating nor understanding that I did not want a 20 minute old order. I explained to him that if we were dining in they would bring our fresh food to the table together. He insisted that if we dine in that it would be under a heat lamp getting ""dried out"" and if he makes me another then my shrimp tacos will be cold. What he should have said was ""I'm sorry, I will remake both of them so they will be ready at the same time and/or I'll discount your meal etc etc"" He never once apologized and was not understanding at all. Will not be returning until it has new management. 1 star for the to go girl being understanding And patient."
Thomas K.,"Palos Verdes Peninsula, CA",191,12,4,5.0,3/19/2014,Had a really great server (James) that was super helpful. Didn't get the brew I wanted but he took care of me. Place was packed when we got here but a table for 3 opened up quickly for us. Prices are higher here but reasonable.
Lisa P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,16,,1.0,4/15/2015,"Culver City location. Plastic tasting fries. Overly sweet bbq sauce that made it taste like its from a can (probably was). How do you ruin potato skins? Even those were like rubber. Cobbler? Microwaved. So gross, rubbery and disgustingly chewy. I was starving and still didn't want to eat it. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. I HAVE NEVER TASTED MORE DISGUSTING FOOD. You could goto a freezer section in the supermarket and get a better meal for a fraction of the over priced food I just got. Never again. 1 star is kind."
Andrew P.,"Los Angeles, CA",28,15,,1.0,1/3/2011,"Never coming back...came in with my girlfriend and walked out 3 seconds later. Service is bad. The people seem to lie about not having tables available..like wtf, I see three empty tables?!?!"
Nicole C.,"Berkeley, CA",0,4,,1.0,8/19/2013,"SAD PANDA. I don't EVER have to write a bad review so this was a momentous occasion. We love BJ's in Arizona, but this location was absolutely horrible. We were seated much later than we were told we were going to be- no biggie, we didn't care.   Our waiter, Alejandro, Ignored us most of the time while talking to his friends at the table across the way.  Thanks to this- our drinks took 20 minutes, our appetizers were never ordered, and when our food arrived a half an hour later (without any of our appetizers ever coming)  they were mediocre and one dish even splattered all over the plate and missing items.   After nicely asking for some couscous they returned 10 minutes later with a dish of cold salmon and more splattered sauce everywhere. The manager, a lady came over three times offereing us a pizzokie and claiming the waiter never told her he forgot our appetizers, or that our food arrived cold and messy. Also, this whole time instead of Alejandro being more attanetive he ignored us. We asked for the check and instead he ignored us for 20 minutes more. When the manager stopped by again she ""apparently"" had no idea what was going on. We said we didn't ask for her and that we wanted to leave and pay. I eneded up never even eating becauase my dish was messed up so many times. After turning down their offer for free dessert (who wants that when we can't even get a meal right!?) they were offended we didn;t want dessert and got in our face asking us why didn't want to try ordering more food. The manager even said ""isnt that what you come to a restaurant for""?! really lady? yea I do, that's why I needed to get the hell out of there and eat some real food at a place with decent service.  I won;t even repeat everything this dumb manager said or this ridiculous waiter did. Guys not all BJ's are alike.  Yup, I said it.  These people need to seriously have their heads examined and understand how a restaurant should be run."
Kay K.,"Pismo Beach, CA",16,217,,2.0,10/9/2013,"There were 3 of us, expecting 2 more, so we told the hostess we were a party of 5. 15 minute wait, no problem. 15 minutes later, they call for us ""party of 4"". We told them we had stated party of 5, had to wait another 10-15 minutes. (We had been traveling for hours through rush hour traffic and were very hungry) Yes it's Monday Night Football, yes the Dodgers are in the playoffs (YAY!!), but only the bar was busy (in my opinion). Our server was nice about splitting our checks (we're in town on business being reimbursed by our employer, makes things easier), we ordered drinks, appetizers, and our entrees by the time our other 2 showed up. So far, everything's maybe 3-3.25 stars, UNTIL we get our food... My mashed potatoes were cold and my garlic bread was inedible, (I didn't send it back because bj's has food runners, which is WHY I HATE DINING AT CHAIN RESTAURANTS!!! I want the person who took my order bring me my food as well!!!  My server was nowhere to be found.) they forgot my one friend's side salad and his shrimp pasta was a mess of sauce and noodles (and hardly any shrimp) and another's chicken salad was a plate full of lettuce and about 5 little bites of chicken. Most of the staff were standing around either watching football or the Dodger game. The last BJ's Brewhouse I ate was was the one in Modesto when it had first opened (about 3 years ago) and it was fun. The only good thing about the night was that the Dodgers won and I got to spend some time out of work with people I work with that I actually like!"
Helen S.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",236,485,,4.0,11/17/2011,"BJ's is always an easy place to go if you can't decide what you feel like.  My problem when I go is I order too much because I can't make up my mind.  My must orders are: stuffed mushrooms, any of the flat bread pizzas, ahi poke, buffalo wings, and the spinach & artichoke dip.  and... you MUST save room for the pizookies.  I always like to get a mix of 2 different flavors.  Most recently, I got the white chocolate macadamia + red velvet...  I highly recommend it! parking can be irritating because it is connected to the mall, but there was no line wait when we came on a Sunday afternoon! yay!"
Dominique M.,"Beverly Hills, CA",1969,373,2503,3.0,10/25/2010,"I love the Ahi poke here! Fresh and delicious. I've dined here once and ordered Ahi poke to go twice...  The first time I was here the world cup was on, and it was so packed and loud. Nice vibe for true soccer fans :) I did admire the beer selection too! Everything else I've had here was just blah nothing special at all. The service not bad but not great either. Worth giving a try yelpers!"
KengiKat C.,"Hollywood, CA",26,139,13,1.0,1/2/2011,"Ok I love BJ's in Westwood, but the one at the Fox Hills Mall or whatever they are calling that place these days, is just the pits. I had to go to that mall because I had two JCPenny gift cards that I needed to use and while there we got hungry and decided to eat at BJ's. Well we should have went with our first mind and drive to Santa Monica so we could eat at ZENGO, but we were pressed for time. First off the service was crappy. Three times the server came back to ask out drink order and once it came it was still wrong. I will say the pulled pork sandwich was good, but everything else was just crap. The silverware was dirty and had the nerve to be all wrapped up in linen. When we showed the server he acted as if it was ok and had no clue as to how to fix it. We had to tell he we wanted CLEAN silverware. Not at all what I am use to from the Westwood location, but I know I will not be going back to this place ever. I dont care if it is the only place open in LA. I got better food service from the Union Rescue Mission and if you read my blog, then you know how bad that experience was."
Shaéle G.,"Mojave, CA",57,4,3,5.0,2/16/2014,Just got served by a waiter named Nick. It was wonderful. He was pleasant and made eye contact. Made sure our table and all the tables around us were satisfied the entire time. This is the first BJs I've been to where I enjoyed my entire experience. Thank you nick!!
Cesar Q.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,4.0,9/16/2012,"Personally I don't know why this place has 2 and a half stars this place is great! The food is great the put sports to watch games and its a fun place to eat with friends and family. The service when I go there is good. Only had one time i had bad service is when I asked this lady for some ranch and the lady gave me a stair and rolled her eyes and never came back with my ranch. But other than that if your gonna come here during football or basketball season, expect a great atmosphere while you enjoy your time with family and friends with great food!  Even though I'm on a diet i will be coming here!"
Robert B.,"Saint Paul, MN",76,28,9,2.0,12/13/2013,I would give it more stars for food and atmosphere but the wait staff and hostesses are TERRIBLE. They are rude and straight from the ghetto.
