Yahance D.,"Long Beach, CA",135,32,36,4.0,11/10/2013,Our server Alex with wonderful she was great!!  She did everything she could to for almost 25 minutes to get the Laker game on. He finally changed it a minute before halftime smh. Food was good tho
N H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,9,,3.0,4/15/2015,"Only 3 stars given because I frequently visit BJ's however when ordering take out check your meals. I ordered several to go orders and 1 was missing and 1 meal was prepared incorrectly. I was reimbursed but I had to make the drive back to the restaurant.  More recently, I sat inside and ordered from the gluten free menu with minor substitutions. After a lengthy wait,  I was told my meal got accidentally cancelled. Then when I did receive my meal,  it was incorrect.  Again I was compensated and given a soup while a waited but the frustration remained."
Amara S.,"Los Angeles, CA",357,266,432,3.0,9/25/2011,"To start off, I'm not the biggest fan of chain restaurants, let alone some place like BJ's. Our server was nice and somewhat attentive. The noise level was sort of a turn off. Places that are loud and play TVs everywhere aren't my cup of tea. We were sat within 2 mins and the hostesses were really nice. The appetizer flat bread pizza was pretty tasty but definitely overpriced. 10 bucks for four small pieces each? EH."
AJ T.,"Leonia, NJ",1,46,9,1.0,1/13/2014,Food is horrible!  This place makes Shakeys taste like gourmet.  Timing is off--drinks served when appetizer finished and meals came out unevely.
Lilly G.,"Ontario, CA",16,24,10,5.0,11/29/2013,Grey service and friendly staff. Finding parkingnwas perhaps the hardest part of our experience however the timely service and delicious food was well worth it.
Kristine D.,"Los Angeles, CA",227,70,2,5.0,12/12/2012,"I like BJ's because they have a wide selection of dishes.  This spot gets pretty packed during big games or right after church.  It's not too bad though.  The longest I've waited to be seated was around 20 minutes.  That night, they were super busy.  Our server was hustling and sweating trying to get everyone's orders.  He and the rest of the staff seemed to be helping each other so that the customers weren't neglected.  It was pretty rad.  Even though the place was full, we didn't have to wait long for our order.  We left a generous tip.  They deserved it."
Hion L.,"Fullerton, CA",469,665,412,2.0,11/12/2010,"I came to this BJs and I think that they were still working out some kinks in their service.  I had put in a pretty large to go order on their website for our office holiday party a week prior.  But something was gnawing inside me to call and confirm.  So when I call the night before, they cannot find any trace of my order even though I have a confirmation number.   Then the ridiculousness of it all sets in.  Apparently when you put in a order on their website it is through their corporate office, even though it is location specific.  The corp office then faxes the order directly to the restaurant.  So I asked the girl at BJs what happened.  She told me their fax machine was turned off.  But luckily she says they can still fill my order. No apologies, instead I was told that I should have called to put in the order instead.  So it is my fault, huh?  When did I get married to BJs?  Only my wife gets to tell me that I am wrong all the time, godammit!  I would have been killed by my coworkers if this had not gone through! Then I follow up with corporate and ask why there was no phone call to follow up.  They stated that there was no need to. But my order got screwed up b/c the fax was off.  The answer - Well, they shouldn't have turned it off.  So shouldn't you guys check to call especially since you have already charged my card? Answer - the fax machine shouldn't be turned off. They did. They shouldn't.  They did. They shouldn't. Wow, I didn't know they employed 4 year olds at corporate."
Pamela S.,"Los Angeles, CA",40,40,18,2.0,11/13/2010,"You'd expect more from a large chain restaurant.  I ordered the salmon teriyaki from the lunch special menu.  I think I was given but 5 or 6 small tiny pieces of salmon and my rice was drenched in teriyaki sauce.  Not worth the price I paid but then again.. who would order salmon teriyaki at a pizza joint?! haha.. my fault! Our waitress Terri was a bit.. hmm.. slow.. probably because she doesn't LISTEN and just brushed us off as if she knew what we wanted.  It seemed I had to repeat myself twice because I can see she didnt process the information the first time.  Only after hearing it twice would she give some indication of comprehension.. Weird.. Parking is horrible here even though it's free mall parking but it always seems full and you have to drive around several times.  I was also surprised that was a wait for a late lunch on a Thursday afternoon but the wait was just 10 or so minutes.   For the OK service and food.. not a recommended place to grab a quick, satisfying lunch.  It was my first time at this particular BJs and don't really see myself coming back for a long time."
Tony X.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,27,,1.0,3/14/2013,"A below average chain restaurant all the way around. Beer taps had fruit flies buzzing around them, the bar smelled like vinegar and the food is unimpressive. BKs in general isn't the best, but its consistent, usually know what you are getting. But this one, not a good place, poorly ran. Went once, never again."
Aryonia W.,"Lawndale, CA",0,3,3,1.0,7/13/2014,"You know the service was horrible if I created a yelp account just to make a review. Where do I even start? I've been here before with one friend and the service was quite okay but this time it was the worst service I have ever had! My sister and a friend came with me and we came in on a Sunday night hungry and ready to have a good time. However that's the total opposite of what we got. I live in torrance and go to BJs over there and never have a problem. Yet this was just sad so we got seated instantly and was sitting at the table for about 20 minutes until we were asked for a drink then we ordered at the same time because it took so long! When the food came 20 minutes later! My sister asked for no tomatoes, no pickles and what do you know? they came with it! My friend ordered a well done burger and it was medium rare!so she sent it back and we tried to give them the benefit of the doubt and get pizookies but they were burnt and and half done too! Even funnier thing is these came before my friends burger did! So we asked for a manager and the waiter got smart so we asked OUR waiter and the General manager came 10 minutes later! So he listened to my sister complain and she said she wouldn't pay for anything because we barely ate and the service was sad. He left to figure out a solution and he decided to cover the bill. Meanwhile when my sister complained he mentioned that he apologized for the experience and that the night was busy and they wouldn't have so many customers if everyone's experience was as bad as ours but based off these reviews doesn't look any different from ours! Point is my friend never ate! My stomach felt some kind of way after and my sister never had to complain like that and I've never had a bad experience but I guess that's life. Will not be coming back here sticking to Torrance. :(  Tip: get it together."
Mot Y.,"San Francisco, CA",275,675,101,2.0,10/15/2010,"The beer here is crap.  The food is just your normal bar type food, but they have plates as well.  You know pasta, chicken a la whatever, but it's still crap.  I have eaten here with colleagues way too many times.  I think the last 3 meals I had here were mediocre at best.   I have tried all of their beers as well and I can make these brews in my tub at home.  Boring!"
maura m.,"Wilmington, CA",4,21,1,5.0,1/5/2015,So we walked in here after being ignored at Lucille's next door. Our server was super sweet and super attentive. The food came really fast and did I mention our waiter was awesome ? I can't remember his name but we love great customer service ! We will be returning :)
Aaron F.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",215,424,,1.0,11/13/2010,"Yes, the food is great. However, this location is the worst experience I have ever had. It also looks as if I am not the only one that has had this problem. My girlfriend and I were seated promptly and waited for 15 minutes before anyone came to us. We kept seeing a waiter looking over at us but never coming over from a distance. It looked as if he was chatting with another waiter for whatever reason.  I had to flag the server to order our damn drink and wonder where our waiter was. Someone finally came over to take our order. We waited literally 25 minutes before we left two bucks for the drink and walked out. Horrible, horrible service. Never going back."
Stan C.,"Marina del Rey, CA",0,16,,1.0,4/25/2014,"Terrible food and service. ""Bison"" burger was flatter than mcdonalds cheeseburger, and the ""slaw"" that came with it was made up of lettuce mix with some added salad dressing."
Bj U.,"Waianae, HI",244,109,15,2.0,8/21/2011,"Yaaay everyone loves BJ's right ?!?! WRONG!  we had gone there because a military buddy of mine is getting out of the army so this was like out good bye dinner drinking laughing night, the drinks came out great no problems we sat at the bar for some time having a good laugh and what not so the rest of our ppl come and we decide to get a table. No one helps us at all, about 20 mins of sitting and staring at each other we decide to flag anyone who works here and is walking right past us... we order our food... it takes Days to get to us..  jesus?! what is going on... our food gets to us and why is there water in my friend plate under his veggies? like literally a big puddle of water? he tilted his plate and there was a mini waterfall enough to fill half a cup? whats going on? not to mention the food he ordered ( dont know what it was) as he explained to me ""Tasts like crap"".... hows that possible? what ever... come here... go sit at the bar."
Lupe G.,"Inglewood, CA",0,8,2,1.0,2/20/2015,"Thanks for a really really bad service Michael S. Don't even bother guys. I came in at 11:20 pm with my boyfriend. We ordered only two beers, one appetizer and one entry and didn't receive it until 12:25 am. I would understand if it was their rush our, but come on! They were already closing!! The place was empty. The server comes back saying. Oh I'm sorry I forgot about you guys, and brings our food all cold that was just sitting there. Even the guacamole that we got was already brown from the top. Not only that but he tells us that we can't order another beer or food because they closed the kitchen and the bar, like come on!! Really??!!!! We had to pay almost $50.00 for something we didn't like. Your horrible attitude did not help at all Michael. Thanks to you we will choose another restaurant that will treat us better. I hope you enjoyed your $1.00 tip!!!"
Victoria L.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,53,13,4.0,12/8/2013,"The menu was a bit limited for non-meat items, but other than that--the food was decent! The staff was super nice. I probably would go back again. I think I like Yardhouse better, but this place wasn't bad."
Ryan B.,"Los Angeles, CA",39,111,123,4.0,8/22/2013,"Very good menu and actually not all that pricy. I got fish n chips and they were delicious. The server was constantly asking me if I would like something to drink but I didn't feel like paying for a drink. It's very spacey and a great place to go either if you're only with one person or if you're in a group. I will certainly be back next time to try something new. Oh and try have wide screens that show sports which is great because I love my Dodgers, Saints and Packers. I definitely recommend BJ's for a date if your date likes it loud and sociable. My only issue is that there are so many people that your food takes forever to arrive. Other than that, pretty good spot!"
Tom G.,"Venice, CA",8,219,20,2.0,1/12/2011,"A generic, uninspired version of the Cheesecake Factory. Had a few hours to kill before a movie, so my friends and I stopped in here on the rationale that we could watch football while we ate. Service was slow, table and menus were sticky, and the food was utterly mediocre.  They got at least one thing wrong per order. And then there was beer.  Despite the ""brewhouse"" claim, I decided to play it safe by ordering a Boddingtons.  Wishful thinking.  The beer was totally flat, and tasted like it had come from a 2 day old keg. Prices aren't high, but it still felt like we overpaid.  Avoid."
Mike H.,"Inglewood, CA",30,43,35,4.0,11/21/2013,"Beer, food, big T.V.s and pizza. Everything you need for a great time. Staff is always nice and rite on the ball. Only wish they had a better Happy Hour, or at least it lasted more than hour. Prices are a bit on the high side for what it is,Food Wise,  but the beer is great and makes up for a lot!!!  See you at Happy Hour."
