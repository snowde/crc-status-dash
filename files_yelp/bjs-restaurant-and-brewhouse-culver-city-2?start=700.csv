Traci K.,"Inglewood, CA",32,234,100,4.0,3/16/2013,"Delicious! I have only been 1 other time, but couldn't remember the experience to save my life! So my husband and I went last night and it was right up our alley! It was poppin for a Friday night too! We like a live crowd that we fit in! Anywho, our waitress was amazing, the food was amazing as well! I had the cajun pasta and my hubby had the jambalaya! YUM! The drinks aren't all that. My strawberry margarita was lacking the strawberry flavor big time, but their signature all star drink the Strawberry Splash was amazing! YUMMY! But my hubby wasn't happy about his ICED FILLED GLASS that was suppose to be long island iced tea! Watered down he said... Sighs..Guess with the live upbeat crowd, they didn't want anyone getting tooooo wasted! LOL"
Jeffrey T.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,35,,1.0,1/9/2015,"Friday evening, January 9, 2015 attempted to place a telephone order.  Called several times (8 to be exact) and the telephone rang with no answer.  Called for the 9th time and the line was busy.  What place of business does not answer its telephone?  Needless to say I dined elsewhere."
Cassandra R.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,1,,1.0,6/8/2014,Okay!! This is the last time I will ever patronize this restaurant. Today I decided to take my daghter and my friend to this place but almost everytime we go they crowd customers and close half the restaurant and they give us a hard time because we always want a round booth. Today we waited 20 mins for the booth we wanted and it was open but the waitress walked right by. I asked if we could sit there and she said no its closed but it was in the middle with two booths on each side filled with people.  When I questioned her she then told me we didn't have 4 people to qualify for that booth. I told her that I didn't want to sit where she sat us I wanted the booth and instead of pleasing the customer she was rude and said we couldn't have it and walked away and so did we!!! I've only been here a few times because of the rude service. We just went to Lucilles next door. They had great service and food 5 star for them. BJ's did not care one bit when we left and I'm glad I didn't spend any of my hard working money there. I guess it's true you get what you pay for.
Brittany S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,2.0,3/10/2015,Came here in Sept. 2014 and the experience was ok. The waiter was really tired and didn't want to serve us. But once he was given his $20 tip in advance his attitude changed. He became very friendly with us. It's really sad that a early tip gave us better service.
Stess K.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,10,,3.0,3/7/2013,"I am pained to write this, but in the almost 2 years I have been eating here, I have yet to have timely service... Why keep going, you ask?  The few entrees that I order on rotation are reallllly good and the location is super close to where I live.  In February I took my boss who was visiting on the east coast and the wait time for every step of the way was almost comical.  I was actually able to leave, drive my boyfriend to work in the far side of culver, return, find parking,  and come back before anything major had happened at the table.  Again, I find the food to be good, but you need to allot a good amount of time, unfortunately."
Alma G.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,19,,5.0,5/23/2011,"I don't know why the bad reviews. My co-worker and I, had lunch here and loved it.  The food was yummy and the service spectacular.  The waitress was very nice, she made us feel sooo welcomed. I will be returning soon :)"
Fitz H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,,3.0,3/4/2014,"The wait was 25 min. No. The wait was 1 hour. Party of six in a less than spacious booth. No thank you. Four utensil/napkins...had to wait for the food to get the other two, after asking a waiter for the extra two. We ordered our drinks and he memorized all of them and brought them to us quickly with no fault. We ordered the food and he memorized that as well, spot on!"
Silvia F.,"Long Beach, CA",164,86,569,4.0,9/2/2012,"I been to Bj's many many times and I've always gotten great customer service. The hostess can sometimes seem bored and rude depending on who is there, but the service I've gotten from the waiters is what has me coming back! One of the coolest waitress' I've had so far is Francis. This woman really enjoys her job. She was so attentive and super informative, but best of all she suggested foods, drinks(alcoholic and non-alcoholic) and desserts. For example, my mom was undecided on her iced tea, and Francis brought her three different flavors without us knowing, Pomergrant Iced Tea, Regular Iced Tea and I can't remember the other, but I expected to get all three charged and I didn't get charged since it was a sample, plus she was being helpful :) you can really see the passion in the woman! She's a very happy person :) the food is pretty delicious, but what I really come for are those delicious pizookies to end you brunch or dinner! I can say I will continue coming here in hopes of getting Francis as my waitress again, but I doubt I'll have that kinda luck lol. So if anyone gets Francis as their waitress, believe me you'll be more then satisfied with her service.  P.S: this place can get packed!!! But the reason for the four star review is because many times they have available seats but they still make customers wait 15mins or more, which sucks when one is super mega starving!"
Henry C.,"Torrance, CA",3328,403,8,4.0,6/23/2010,"Wow!  I'm shocked at the ratings this restaurant has received... an average of 2 and a half stars?  That's pretty harsh...  I guess I'm gonna try to bring this up to 3..... I've always enjoyed BJ's restaurant & brewhouse. I only have had it one other time but if my memory serves me I remember it was delicious tasting deep dish pizzas that they offer.  Although they offer many other things on their menu, pizza has always been the one thing that I go there for...(Oh and the Blondes that they have!  Delicious!  I'm talking about alcohol fellas!) Had a business meeting here yesterday at about 1:30ish.. surprisingly it was still really packed and had to wait for a table to be available.  (The restaurant is not that big compared to other BJs) Once the party was there we were seating immediately.  Overall, the initial service was great as the hostess was really friendly and nice. Once we sat down at our requested seats (Which she got us a nicer quieter corner as requested) we were greeted by the server.  We then proceed and ordered a large half and half pizza that was half BBQ chicken and half Mediterranean.  The Mediterranean side was slightly more salty due to the pepperchinis and the olives but the flavor was pretty good.  The BBQ chicken side well........ it's BBQ chicken!  So it's pretty hard to go wrong there.  The deep dished crust was slightly crispy and buttery which is what I really enjoy in a pizza  (As you can see I'm not really a thin crust fan)  So overall once again I've had a terrific pizza experience here at BJs. The only gripe that I can see having at this location are the following.. 1)  Parking.... for some strange reason, parking is always difficult here.  Ever since Westfield took over the mall (Formally known as Fox Hills Mall), they have renovated the place and it's looking so much nicer!  Perhaps that's the reason why parking were tough to come by.  There is a garage parking but it's wrapped around the other side so I usually don't use that enterance. 2)  Wait time...The restaurant is smaller than the others so more waiting time is required here... so just have to make a reservation or plan ahead... 3)  Waiter...  Although he was accommodating to the party and cordial, he didn't really smiled at all giving the impression that he wasn't really enjoying what he was doing...  I think a smile would have been much better and that's my opinion.  Like the hostess who was smiling all the time it provided a very radiant and warm feeling, but the waiter just killed it... (But he was nice and we left him a pretty good tip regardless) Hopefully this can bring the stars up a little bit... too good of a restaurant to be rated so low."
Tai F.,"Los Angeles, CA",406,822,169,3.0,11/1/2010,"I like  BJs. I like their pizza and I like their pizzookies (I realize I probably spelled that wrong but care very little about it.) But I don't looooove it and I it's very unlikely that I would ever go out of my way to eat at a BJs.  The office staff went last week to celebrate one of my coworker's birthdays. I called ahead to let them know that there would be 9 of us coming and they said they would have a table ready. Supposedly they don't take reservations but this sort of felt exactly like that. And, when we got there, there was a table ready for us. The waitress was efficient and kept all of our glasses full the entire meal. There was a tiny mistake on one of my coworkers salads but other than that everyone seemed to like their meals. I had a mini pizza and a house salad. I might be a little spoiled but the house salad here was just plain bad. It seemed that the greens had been allowed to age in the plastic bag I'm sure they came in and then sort of just dumped haphazardly onto my plate with a few stiff julienned carrots. It was pretty pitiful and I ultimately left most of it behind. The pizza was good they got the toppings right but there was only cheese on half of it which seemed a bit odd. I still enjoyed every bite. Like I said, BJs is fine but it doesn't make me drool and really, that's the reaction food should always incite."
Alexander C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,11,,2.0,1/14/2014,Mediocre King Food is not great but not bad Pizookie redeems
Craig H.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,27,3,3.0,8/15/2011,Good happy hour prices--Decent Beer- Mini Pizzas 1/2 off.. But the wait for the normal restaurant is Crazy- --If you sit at the bar watching a game at happy hour-its worth it. A long wait for a table at this place is crazy--- Food is good when on happy hour special - beside that  probably overpriced. 2 star
Mel M.,"Culver City, CA",1,22,3,1.0,11/16/2014,"I ordered online for curbside delivery. My order was supposed to be ready at 5:30. I arrive at 5:20 and drove around looking for the posted curbside sign as directed. There is not a sign. I called and asked the restaurant and the first person I talked to said there wasn't one and to park either in a takeout spot or in a close parking space, then she put me on hold. It was super busy because it was a Sunday night but I eventually found  a close parking space five minutes later. I was still on hold. Finally someone came back to the phone (a different person) and asked where I was parked. I said I was in a 2 hour parking spot right outside the restaurant. Her response was, ""all the way down there?"" I told her I was literally right outside the restaurant and this is where the first woman told me to go. She told me to move to the mall valet and put my blinkers on, and that my food wasn't ready yet. So now it's ten minutes after my food was supposed to be done. I moved and sat there for another five minutes and she came out. When I got home I noticed that my ice cream was in a non insulated container and right on top of my hot food. It also was vanilla when I asked for chocolate (I double checked my receipt). The cookie was burnt and in a ripped foil covering. They didn't open the vents on the container that my entree was in so the fries were soggy. On top of that, they tasted weird like they were freezer burned. The chicken strips were mostly breading and no actual chicken. Needles to say, I won't be back."
Jackie G.,"Hawthorne, CA",16,6,,3.0,1/13/2013,"So my boyfriend and I decided to go to BJ's in Torrance, but the wait time was 1hr-1hr and 30 minutes. So, my boyfriend decided to go to the one in Culver City, which we can phone ahead and make reservations. When we got there the host gave me one of those vibrating devices and told me it would be 25-30 minutes. Okay we decided to go to the mall to buy something. We went back downstairs and noticed that these two girls who just got there were seated right away. I went up to ask the host if they had called us and said yes we called you a long time ago. Hmmm weird? It didn't vibrate. She said ""Oh it doesn't vibrate."" Okay? why would you give it to me to begin with??? It would of been nice if someone would of informed us we had to stay locked inside with the huge crowd of people! Whatever, we got seated right away and took nearly 20 minutes for someone to come and ask what we wanted to drink. We ordered wings, which were awesome! That night I went safe and ordered fettucini alfredo, and my boyfriend ordered the buffalo chicken pizza, easy celery and onion. We got our food and my pasta tasted like plain pasta yuck! Then my boyfriends pizza had so much tomato sauce,and the sauce was super sweet while the buffalo sauce was really spicy. It felt like we were eating bread with a spicy and sweet sauce, not so delicious! When the waitress asked us how were doing we asked for ranch, thinking it would minimize that sweet flavor. It took nearly 20 minutes to bring it out hmmm i hope they were making it from scratch! Finally we ordered a mini pazzoki best part of the night! When we got our pazzoki the waitress didn't leave the bill, we already knew it would be another waiting game with her! Finally after 10 minutes she brought us our bill, and then waited another 20 to come back with our receipt, since we paid with a card.  Overall the Torrance location is way better! They always get the order right they're fast  their pasta doesn't taste plain and best part their little vibrating thing works anywhere in the mall."
Kelly K.,"Pasadena, CA",264,430,128,1.0,11/6/2010,"WORST EXPERIENCE I'VE EVER HAD IN A RESTAURANT. This place made me so angry it's not even worth a review. But I feel others should have fair warning. We were seated on a Sunday night at non-peak hours so it wasn't busy. A waiter never greeted us. A female manager saw us looking around for help so she approached us after 10 minutes. She took our drink orders and offered a free appetizer, but since we had a movie to catch that night, we placed our dinner order then and there as well. A male waiter came up and apologized (upon orders by the manager). Never saw him again. Our drinks and appetizer were delivered by the manager. The table next to us sat down after us, got a waiter, and got their drinks, entrees and dessert before we got our entree. Since our waiter didn't come back and the female manager was incognito, I approached a male manager at the front. He apologized and went into the kitchen and brought us our food within 3 minutes or so. I asked him if it has been sitting under a heat lamp and he said no. Then a female waitress approached us and asked how our meal was and said she was taking over for the other guy. The food did in fact taste not-so-fresh and we had waited 50-60 minutes from the time we sat down to eat so we weren't even really hungry anymore. We tried to flag down the waitress to give us our check but had to get the manager again and yes everything did get comped, not just the app, but the complete lack of attention from the ENTIRE wait staff in addition to management was abysmal. He offered a free dessert, but why would we want to wait an additional 30 minutes for melted ice cream to be brought to us? AVOID AT ALL COSTS"
Lauren M.,"Los Angeles, CA",131,117,22,4.0,5/3/2010,"My cousin and I came here the first weekend it opened. That was a stupid thing to do. It was an hour and a half wait so we left. Since the night of its grand opening I have been back several times with a variety of different people. Each visit left me one satisfied customer; it's just as good as the Torrance location. :) My first official visit to this BJ's was with my mom. We went during an off day because we figured that since the place was still so new we'd go when it was not the weekend. When we walked in we were greeted by the friendly hostess and were seated right away. I ordered the mini pepperoni, olive, and mushroom deep dish pizza along with a side of Caesar salad. My mom got one of their sandwich meals with steak fries. We both loved what we got and even though the crust of my pizza is reminiscent of Pizza Hut's it's 100x better. I think it's the cheese that makes the difference; it's just so creamy and delicious!  My next visit I went with my cousin and my roll dawg Rosie (same cousin from the first paragraph visit). This time it was a Saturday night and the wait time was a good 20-25 minutes. No big deal. Rosie and I chatted our heads off until our table was called so it was all good. So, we sat down and we both ordered a side Caesar salad to start off with. Rosie substituted the Caesar for her customary ranch and I asked the waiter to give me a side of balsamic vinaigrette. My salad came back already dressed with the vinaigrette instead of being on the side but it's cool; I don't really stress over little things like that. As an entree I ordered the Cajun Pasta as recommended by Rosie (she ordered the same thing) and boy is it good! I really think this dish offers some real stiff competition to my favorite CPK pasta entree, which is the Spicy Jambalaya.  Next visit: I'm back with my mom and sister. We came here about a few weeks ago and what makes this day stand out in my mind is the phenomenal server we had. I think his name is Brad. Caucasian dude of average height, spiky dark hair, with a Boston/New York accent. He is most definitely a Triple Threat in the land of restaurant serving: Efficient, Personable, and Attentive. He's one of the best servers I've ever had in all my years of restaurant dining.  Latest visit: Yesterday I went to BJ's with my good friend to hit up the Lakers vs Jazz game. We sat at the bar facing the mega inch TV and proceeded to order our alcohol. I got the Riesling and she got the What a Peach. Both drinks were good. I ended up ordering three glasses and she ended the meal with two. Now, back to the food. First, we got the pot stickers. They were ok, kind of bland but edible. Next, we shared a small pizza. On her side was pepperoni and on my side was pepperoni, olives, and mushroom. The deep dish was yummy as always. Finally, we ordered the chocolate chip/peanut butter Pazookie (my first time having this thing). I totally get the hype over this dessert. Melted vanilla ice cream and a warm, sweet, and chewy, cookie. Perfect! As far as the atmosphere is concerned it is always nice and chill here. Yesterday was especially fun since everybody was in fine spirits over the game. Also, the servers and bartenders at the bar were on point so service was quite efficient. The only bad thing about yesterday is that the Lakers won the game. Oh well! lol"
Andrea D.,"Los Angeles, CA",586,22,20,1.0,5/24/2013,"I love BJ's in general but I hate this location of BJ. HORRIBLE HOSTESS AND WAITRESSES. I went in last night to go eat dinner with my boyfriend. Once we went in  I already have a bad vibe about the place, we had to wait about 5 mins till the hostess said something to us because they were to busy gossiping. Finally,  the hostess welcomed us and then told us about the happy hours special they were having and then immediately told us to go up the ramp and seat ourself down. I found it really odd to do that because we didnt ask for there specials and i thought they were suppose to seat us. We followed her direction anyways and went up the ramp and tried looking for a seat but there was none open, so we went back to the hostess desk and told her there was no seats and we would like a table since theres plenty of empty booths/tables open at the time. She said okay and then walked away. We waited for about 10 mins and she was no where to be found. So we just left.  There was many waitress there just standing and talking to one another. I was pretty disappointed. They need better service and more professional staffs."
Diana H.,"El Segundo, CA",44,331,4,3.0,4/13/2011,MEH. The food was too salty and just not that good. And I'm not a grandma who complains that food is too salty. I had the clam chowder which was OK. And the Shrimp Scampi which was just gross. The shrimp was mushy - obviously not fresh and it just was not good. The service was good though - everyone was really friendly. And I should have just ordered a pizookie to end my lunch right. Will I come again? NAH.
Corky G.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,110,49,3.0,6/15/2013,Manager not here today. Can tell because the tables around us take literally 30 minutes to be cleared. A lot of empty tables and a 20 minute wait at the door. The only thing consistent is the great service and their teamwork!
Ellie V.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,5,2,1.0,1/18/2014,"Been to this place twice.  Both times got awful service.  First time there, we got a table right away, but everything else took forever.  This time we sat at the bar.  Ordered a drink and paid for it. The bartender never bothered asking if we wanted anything else, or another drink even after our cups were empty."
