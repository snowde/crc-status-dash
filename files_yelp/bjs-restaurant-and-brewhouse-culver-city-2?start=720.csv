Michi S.,"Los Angeles, CA",187,172,126,2.0,3/9/2011,"I went to BJ with a large party on a weekend. so we did have a long wait, (which was expected). Once seated it took maybe another 30mins just for waiter to take our order. Food was great, but it took along time for watier to check on us, etc... service was poor. maybe they need to hire more workers"
Tina-Marie L.,"La Mirada, CA",592,586,357,2.0,5/26/2010,"Dude! I can't believe this BJ's continues to get so much business. I've been here twice, once as a sit-down, another as a phone order to pick-up. Both times, I've left feeling dissatisfied. The first time our waitress left us for lengthy periods of time to fend for ourselves. Normally, you can flag down another waiter/waitress and they'll help you. Oh, not at this BJ's. We needed flatware and instead of just getting the napkin roll, we were told, ""I'll let your server know."" Refer back to leaving us for lengthy periods of time, and I'll just say that the food was mildly warm by the time I had my utensils. Second time, on my way to class, my carpool buddy and I decided to order via phone and swing by to pick it up. Easy order; 1 Angel Hair Toscana with Chicken, 1 Wedge Salad. We get there and her wedge salad is almost non-existent. The existing parts has brown edges. When we asked if we could pay separately, the cashier said that that would be fine. Little did we know we were asking her to divide the Red Sea and she would need Moses to help her divide our check. She input something wrong on the computer, had to call the manager, the manager after laughing at the front with co-workers, moseys her way on down and then says she lost her G-14 Classified Manager Card that will allow her to change the transaction. She apologizes and says she will need to go find her card and then she will return. In the meantime, our cashier starts punching some things in and miraculously gets it to work.  While we were waiting my friend asks why the salad is so small and she mentions that it was an add-on to my entree. WTF?! We didn't ask for an accompanying dinner salad; we wanted a complete salad. Anyhow, 15 minutes later, we were finally out of there. Not... going... back..."
Annie A.,"Santa Monica, CA",45,20,3,4.0,1/15/2012,"After reading the recent reviews on Yelp about BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse I was pretty nervous that our party 12 decided to go there today for lunch.  Despite the recent reviews of this restaurant, our experience was positive.  Our waiter, Luis, was really attentive and gave our group really good service.   He kept our drinks full, food came out quickly and orders were correct.   The only reason they did not get a 5 star rating is because I kept having to stack & hand staff the empty plates from the appetizers and salads that were crowding the table."
Jerome L.,"Los Angeles, CA",337,249,114,4.0,3/13/2011,"Come here for the happy hour and leave happy. Mini pizza was delicious as always per BJ's standards. Cheeseburger sliders with bacon were delicious but I think BJ's needs to buy a clue from Yardhouse and put some pastrami in these babies. Yum! Kamikaze shooters were standard and so was the price. Sangria tasted very bitter. Then again, I don't think I've ever had a good sangria anywhere. BJ's Irish Root Beer is absolutely delicious. Just order the next chance you get. I know what my favorite drink at BJ's is now!  Oreo cookie pizooki with vanilla ice cream on top was excellent. I'm removing one-star because the restroom wasn't as clean as it should have been and I almost slipped and fell on a puddle of water in there. At least I hope it was water. Four stars for the delicious food and the awesome service by our waitress, Anita!"
Natasha L.,"PORTER RANCH, CA",51,22,9,4.0,7/11/2011,"I went to BJs of Culver with a total party of 6. Our wait time was not too bad, couldn't have been more than 25 minutes. But, being a restuarant so well known, how could it not be packed? You don't want to wait, then go to a fast food or buffet. Our waiter was Rich(ie) and he was fantastic. Very sweet, uniform clean and crisp, very helpful. Timed our refills perfectly. Our appetizers were completely devoured, we all enjoyed our food, the drinks for those who drank were great according to them, and my drink? The Strawberry Lemonade? AMAZING. Only two reasons why it's a 4 and not 5: I made my choice of dish mainly due to price (chose one under $10). The food is great, but not -that- great. It would have to be an unique occasion for me to choose BJs if not simply for the Strawberry Lemonade and Pie-zookie. And the tables- they sat us in a booth, and I think that's too tight for 6. It seems all groups like ours were in booths and not smaller tables bunched together even though there were plenty free to do that. Don't depend on the booths too much.....  Still, this particular BJs is my favorite beside the one in Burbank. Clean and attentive, and the Strawberry Lemonade doesn't taste expired or spiked with alcohol, ha. Cheers!"
Princess P.,"Los Angeles, CA",39,273,176,3.0,4/5/2013,"Wow, I am shocked by all the bad reviews. I've come here a few times with my gal pals and we've always had excellent service.  Oooh Lawd those pizookis...I can't!! They are super rich, gooey, and heavily ladened with calories, just the way some of the gals like em. I really love the veggie burger with the garlic flavored bun, omg, so, so ,sooo good!!!  The prices are reasonable, my friend always has a coupon, and they have a bizilion menu items to choose from! :-). The parking is horrible to me but I guess it is your typical busy mall parking!"
Ms J.,"Lomita, CA",0,82,8,3.0,7/21/2014,Enjoyed this location. Have visited 2x after lunch rush and both times had a good experience. Along with good food.
steve L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,20,,5.0,10/9/2014,BJ is the bomb I got good food and great service. Sat at the bar got served right away.arnesto the bartender was attentive and did a good job. My bacon cheeseburger was delectable! Will definitely go back love all the beers on tap!!
Ashlee C.,"Venice, CA",0,10,,5.0,9/24/2012,"I have dined at this location in the mall twice and both times was in awe by the service. The best service I have ever had and both times here. The place is cool and well know coorperate, which is not really my type of place, but the food is fun and good and the beers are good as well. Either way the service from 2 different male servers i had was so helpful nice and fun."
STEW E.,"Marina del Rey, CA",9,47,3,5.0,6/29/2013,"Loved iT! Had a wonderful dining experience WITH THE KIDS!! Great attentive waiter - ERNESTO -, literally every time I looked up he was there! it was fantastic, I was very pleased. I highly recommend asking for Ernesto, he could spot the fact that my ""medium"" steak was a little overcooked even before I said anything he offered to cook another one! GREAT SERVICE!!!"
Christopher T.,"Culver City, CA",63,38,17,4.0,1/11/2011,"I usually only come for happy hour, but the deep dish is great! The beers are awsome! And the prices are good. Bar is always packed even late and the game(s) always on."
Lauren Y.,"Culver City, Los Angeles, CA",197,27,,1.0,5/12/2013,"Having been a waiter for so many years then managing a restaurant, I have extreme patience for customer service. I ordered to go over the phone (put in hold for 10 mins) and was told 20 mins but 45 minutes after waiting I was told only my Caesar salad was done but neither of my pizzas. Even though the manager was standing right next to me, he did nothing. Terrible customer service but great food. I hope other locations value customer service much better than here. Extremely disappointed. The least they could have done is tell all the people after me that it would take more than 15 minutes for their order to be ready..."
Robert G.,"Los Angeles, CA",159,264,24,2.0,6/17/2012,"BJ's has good food, BUT this Culver City location is one of the worst restaurants to goto when it comes to getting seated.  Multiple times we've come here for birthday dinners only having to wait for shy over an hour to be seated every time we've been here.  EVERY TIME.  I sincerely hate coming here to this particular location"
Nino P.,"Culver City, CA",115,165,262,2.0,9/19/2012,"Food and dining experience is average. Staff need to improve on customer service. I just feel some of them are out of control and inexperienced. Waiter messed up our order, slow and was not personable. I don't see myself returning anytime soon. Lots of alternative places."
Mario S.,"Los Angeles, CA",74,329,9,3.0,3/11/2010,"Yes, this place is part of a chain (feels like a warmer version of Chili's), which I usually steer around. But it's good for you business types (I am usually one of those) to get together for beers after work (huge selection). Good bar, appetizer menu, too.  3-stars for all that. The meals are kind of borderline. 2-stars for that. But the service is terrific.  When the waiter noticed me peeling the ham off my grilled cheese (I'm a vegetarian that doesn't do a very thorough job of reading menus), instead of laughing, the guy orders me a fresh, meat-less sandwich AND fetches me refill on my tomato soup.  That was so uncalled for, so awesome."
Elvis P.,"Santa Monica, CA",195,188,44,2.0,3/4/2013,"We decided to stop by this evening after filming in Compton. The waiter disappeared for over 30 minutes and it wasn't because of a crowd since the place was about empty. The food is fine, but when it takes longer to place an order than to eat the shit, it pisses me off. It was getting to the point where we started doing the #rd Rock from the Sun thing with the tip. Put a stack of cash on the table and every time they screw up, the stack shrinks."
Mark M.,"Goldsboro, NC",1,2,2,2.0,11/16/2014,"Good place to go for beer. Great selection on draft. Sat at the bar and service was good.  However, we ate the pizza.  I have had better frozen pizza from the grocery store."
Terenna T.,"Los Angeles, CA",402,171,84,3.0,3/20/2013,"This is a pretty good place. Came here and it fills so overcrowded all the time. The seating arrangements are terrible. Get there early because finding a parking space near the restaurant aint happening, unless you do valet. So if u pass valet and the entryway to the structure, you will find parking on the southside of the lot. This server was great, she was funny and relaxed, which made the whole experience good, since over packed places usually piss me off. The food was good, but what especially enjoyed that made me stop in my tracks, were the Thai Wraps Appetizer, they were great and fresh tasting. So, this is a good place for happy hour, but NO romantic dinners, ever."
Yesenia D.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,2,2.0,7/5/2014,"I love the food but the service is Horrible! I came to this place with my fiancé and the waitress never showed her face other than to present her self. When our food arrived she didn't even bother dropping off utensils so we had to wait at least 10 minutes until the bus boy came around picking up dishes. Afterwards she never came back I saw her laughing and talking around the bar with her coworkers which I thought was very unprofessional! Your getting paid to work not to socialize. The only time she came back was to drop off the bill and even then she took FOREVER to pick up the check and credit card. I honestly didn't even bother leaving a tip I am usually a big tipper but in this case she didn't deserve it. I was really disappointed, the Managers really need to hire or train these people on their customer service even the hostess they come off as snobs that don't even want to work there. I work in the restaurant business so I know how guest should be treated and how employees should act towards them. Sad to say I am not coming back here only because their customer service lacks so much but the food here is very good."
Debbie L.,"Canterbury, New Zealand",0,1,,1.0,11/30/2013,I was not impressed with the Caesar salad I had. First it was brought out as a side salad then a dinner size with the chicken I ordered but it had no dressing on it. I had to go find the waiter to get some dressing.  As a salad it wasn't much for the $12.75 price
