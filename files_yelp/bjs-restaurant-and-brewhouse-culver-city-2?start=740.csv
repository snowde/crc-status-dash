Lauren B.,"Austin, TX",717,429,209,2.0,6/28/2010,"Dropped from 4 to a 2. Yep that just happened.  I was with  the fam and we went to visit grandpa at the cemetery on fathers day and decided to grab a bite afterward and due to the incredibly close proxmity to the graveyard, we decided to go to BJs. Our appetizer flatbread was too mushy... I've tried it before and it was definitely 5 star worthy.. this one, not so much. Also, I was not a huge fan of the shrimp lettuce wraps since each person got 3 or so measly shrimps(arn't most shirmps)... next time I will opt for the chicken.  Lastly, the service was SLOOOOW! I understand that its fathers day but common...  Oh ya, I was taking some stuff to-go and I had to ask for a bag to put my boxes since there were none in their normal place. The waitress had to hunt them down from elsewhere.  To be realistic, even though the experience was not up to par, I will be coming back and the food and service will probably be good..."
Trisha F.,"Los Angeles, CA",82,55,5,4.0,8/1/2012,"I can see how BJs can get a bum rap on yelp-busy waitstaff, over crowded lobby- etc. But I think it's that way with most large chain establishments.  I, however, had a great experience with BJs today. I made a large party reservation and even had to book the buffet. I called numerous times to make sure everything was going according to planned. The managers were always polite and informed. During our event at BJs, the wait staff was fabulous! All my 48 guests were never hungry or thirsty. The buffet was always replenished with hot food in a matter of seconds. And even though we were to only have our event for 2 hours, we went *a little over time* and were not hassled at all. I appreciate the staff at BJs. I know how difficult it is to make a group of people happy, and they certainly pulled it off."
Patty A.,"Los Angeles, CA",356,191,36,4.0,2/6/2013,"I went in for lunch and as usual, BJ's doesn't disappoint. I mean I guess there is nothing tooo special for me when it comes to BJ's. I got a salad and sandwich with water. The prices are reasonable and our server was nice. Overall it was a good experience."
Silvia V.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,20,10,1.0,5/11/2013,The service was terrible. Food was ok. Not worth going back.
Larry L.,"Culver City, CA",57,136,1,2.0,2/3/2013,Average chain food that makes some of the most disgusting pizza I've ever tasted in my life.  Seriously.
Laurie M.,"Inglewood, CA",72,218,108,2.0,4/12/2012,"For some reason I always want to go to BJ's but as soon as I'm there more than 5 minutes I want to gtfo. The service here is terrible! You have to wait a long time to be seated, quite a long time to order, an even longer time to get your food and, finally, an eternity to get the check. Its only saving grace is their pizza. And the pzookies. And maybe their beer sampler. I guess that's 3 saving graces."
Paul G.,"Los Angeles, CA",20,39,4,4.0,9/6/2012,"Pretty good overall. A somewhat upscale place to eat with vague hints of its origins (or alternate identity) as a sports bar, with a series of video monitors near the ceilings and a multiscreen matrix of several video feeds installed over the bar (which I am confident becomes one massive television screen for the major sporting events). The scampi pasta was very good."
Nick S.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",442,142,63,4.0,6/1/2012,"I'm trying to avoid the chain restaurants, but came here by virtue of a business meeting schedule by a colleague.  The client's office was close by, and she insisted even if we didn't like it, the most important attendee was a fan so we needed to oblige him.  (I have to say that in the voice voice of Lt. Aldo Raine - Inglorious Bastards).   I showed up early and the parking situation didn't look great.  There was a garage and my assumption was the walk would take me into some department store labyrinth so I avoided it and the only other close spots were carry out only (at least open spots).  So I ended up parking next to some ignoramus that didn't realize those white lines where the children's coloring book equivalent of what you need to stay in when parking your car.  Needless to say the spot was open for this very same reason so maybe I should have thanked the douche, but I couldn't bring myself to do it.   All this led me with a desire to wash the already sour taste in my mouth out with a cold beer, but the hostess did it with a smile and welcoming hello when I walked in.  I let her know I was waiting for a few others to arrive, but rather than sit around with twirling her hair, she readied a table for us while I waited.  That was pretty cool! The server was a doll, and knew exactly what she was doing.  Convinced all of us to order specialty drinks that we had no interest in (I went with a strawberry lemonade), and then went through the specialty items.  The southern fried chicken hit my salivating glands before my brain had to time to analyze, and it was a great choice!  The lemonade was super sweet, so I had to chase it with a water but that was my only complaint inside the doors.   I wish this restaurant was in a nicer location with better parking, but hey it's a chain.  The service and food was delish and therefore, I'll be back to probably that and other BJ's so to indulge again in no time.  Maybe these chain restaurants have something to them after all..."
Jennifer H.,"South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",5,7,15,1.0,8/13/2012,"I had made a reservation for my birthday on a Monday my birthday was on a Thursday, early that Thursday I got a call to confirm for 8:30 and  when I walked in at 8:10 and spoke to the host and said I was waiting for my party which was 10 of us she said it was fine to just walk in at 8:30 when  I get there the  ""manager or host"" whoever the fuck he was said my reservation was at 8. I was very upset this was the last thing I wanted to hear. People with smaller parties were getting sat like nothing. And here we are with a reservation waiting and waiting. We got a table at 9 then the waitress just walked away like aren't you suppose to offer me a drink?  when she finally decided to come back I asked for appetizers which we never got and she took 15 minutes to get our drinks. It took 40 minutes to get our food by that time I was irritated and over it. I won't come here again with a large party. The food was eeeh could be better! The only good thing about this place were the Very Berry Margaritas! p.s the floor is very slippery!"
Jena S.,"Los Angeles, CA",709,571,260,3.0,3/28/2010,"Alright BJs, you have officially won me (and Mr. Midnight) over.  And no, it's not because of that one bartender that's in the know... but its your combination of a few things that are the way to most everyman's heart: Good Beer & Great Mac & Cheese! After a debaucherous night out we headed to the mall to get something for his nieces birthday.  We both turned to eachother as we walked and said: we want beer! I was hungry too though.  We saw a sign that said ""2.95 bites and samples..""  I ordered some mac & cheese.  We had no idea how orgasmic that was going to be.   The wait. The anticipation... (Why was it taking so long to get our beer & some mac & cheese?) When it arrived, it was a pretty big portion.  He wasn't hungry originally... that was until he saw that it was covered in bacon... and that there were hidden pieces of bacon inside the cheese itself.   Orgasmic!  Definitely will be coming back for more of that. As it was the 2nd time we were here, and we were pleased with what we ordered, the service could be much better. It was a bit slower than I'd have liked but that could have been partially due to the night befores festivities."
Eileen F.,"Culver City, CA",3,45,6,2.0,6/12/2013,Friendly Customer Service. Good wait staff. The food is below mediocre. I live near by and it seems that as time has gone on the food has gotten worse. They are known for their pizzas but often times it has been dry or overcooked. Ive tried different dishes and drinks and they just fail to impress. My recommendation is DON'T BOTHER!
Amber B.,"Compton, CA",12,43,96,2.0,6/19/2012,"I decided to have dinner with one of my friends at this location about a week ago. We arrived on a somewhat busy night. So, I didn't mind waiting 15-20 minutes for our table. We were finally seated & our waiter took our order. I ordered a ""MEDIUM pizza"" and my friend ordered the pasta dish. He brought us our drinks and soon after returned with our food and another waitress. I looked at my pizza and said, ""this isn't a medium. I ordered a medium."" My waiter's attitude completely changed. He abruptly responded with "" YOU ORDERED THE MINI PIZZA!! I ASKED YOU IF YOU WANTED A MINI PIZZA AND YOU SAID YES!!! I REPEATED YOUR ORDER AND YOU SAID OK!!!""  I then explained, "" I heard you say medium and that's why I responded yes."" He haughtily responded, ""WELL THAT'S YOUR ORDER RIGHT THERE!!!!(pointing at the mini pizza on the table) AND ANYWAY THIS IS YOUR NEW WAITRESS, SHE'LL BE TAKING OVER FOR ME!!!""  I assume that it was a shift change and this jackass was ready to go home because he seemed to fly away from us at top speed.  The whole time he was ranting about my pizza the new waitress looked equally as offended as my friend and I. I never once raised my voice above normal speaking level. I just wanted what I ordered. I didn't mind waiting for that to happen. ALEX OR ALEJANDRO immediately went off on defensive rant. I felt COMPLETELY disrespected and the waitress could tell. She began to try to fix the situation and I asked to see the manager.  She went to find him and he shortly returned. I assume she explained the situation because he was completely apologetic and told me my MEDIUM pizza was being prepared as we spoke. My problem was not with the error it was how Alex handled it. He overreacted on a rational person. I don't know where the mix up actually happened. It could have been him not speaking clearly or writing down the wrong thing."
Lee P.,"Portland, OR",17,46,16,2.0,3/16/2012,"Sigh... we were in the mall in Culver City on a retail sales assessment and were starving, so we decided to get something to eat at BJ's.  I'd never heard of BJ's (we don't have any in Portland, at least that I know of), so I was neutral on the choice.  When we walked in it was big, set up with a bar area with a lot of TVs, and then spilled out into a dining area.  My first impression was... oh... this place is like a Chilis/TGI-Fridays/CheesecakeFactory/Applebees/on/and-on/and-on.   ...a chain restaurant with pre-packaged food so they can support the giant menu listing (heavy sigh).  I know this kind of food.  It all tastes 'okay', but very artificial and pre-prepared.  Knowing this, I went with the healthiest option that looked good: a flatbread veggie pizza with a salad.  It was 'meh'... not bad, but 'meh'.  My coworker had a little personal pepperoni pizza and some sort of a side.  He didn't eat all his pizza and didn't want to waste the rest, so he asked if I could eat some.  I tried it and it was like 'POP' in my mouth... a shock of ""FLAVOR"", and that was from just the crust.  Pizza crust is supposed to be a little doughy, yeasty, and earthy... not slap you in the face with zing.  I usually eat a pretty healthy and clean diet, so when I get food with artificial flavoring, especially MSG, it usually sticks out.  This time it nearly slapped me in the mouth.  Blech.  I don't want to eat that stuff.  I can't taste the real flavor and know if it's good or not... it's processed and loaded with enough flavor enhancers that it'll ""taste good"", but it doesn't register as real taste, but more so overly intense and enhanced. All in all, it got us through lunch, but I'm not a fan.  It's 'meh'... and some menu items are 'blech'.  Doubt I'll ever be back to one unless it's solely to watch a game and have a beer with friends. One thing that's always a bummer about these places is that they do have a nice environment... big booths, a cool open bar with tons of TVs to hang out and view.  Now if they could just shake the big corporate supply chain and food preparation and turn it into a local place with fresh, healthy, local, homemade food, I'd be all over it."
Danielle B.,"Los Angeles, CA",95,412,21,4.0,1/6/2013,"They do not take reservations so be careful of when you go.  Our waitress, Diana, was amazing.  We ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken (get extra sauce), Boneless chicken wings, Cobb sandwich, Shrimp tacos, Classic Cheese Burger, Chicken tenders, and the artichoke dip.  The only thing I did not like was the artichoke dip.  I also ordered a Hefeweizen and did not get a lemon.  Why do they want me to try it without?  It was easy to split the bill with others."
Yogi V.,"Gilroy, CA",23,13,31,3.0,5/10/2012,"Extremely Slow service.  Took forever for food to arrive.  For the time it took,the food was so so.   Last time I spend money there."
Daisy C.,"Los Angeles, CA",317,193,540,2.0,2/4/2010,"Food isn't terrible. Not like I've never been to a Bj's before. But waiting 30 minutes for water? pssshht I think not. Really, 30 minutes for water with no silverware on our table. I don't mind eating with my hands, but drinking soup is a different story.  Waiters? Waitresses? Who's who? I don't even know who was serving me. Once the host/hostess sits you down, you won't meet your server until 10 minutes later. I eat like a hippo, so when I don't get my food pronto, I turn into a big baby who needs her milk. Damn my fingers were tapping and our server was NO WHERE to be seen. Yeah the restaurant may seem busy, but it's just a bunch of eaters who's trying to flag down their servers to bring the check.  Sadly, I will return. Not much restaurants around the mall, but hey there's a bird pick tea & herb right when you walk in the mall near BJ's entrance!! yay!!! Love me some Bird Pick. Sorry BJ's. bon appetit."
Jeff G.,"Los Angeles, CA",207,62,3,2.0,12/9/2009,"This place makes me feel like an abused house wife who keeps coming back... ""its alright baby that was the past, I've changed baby, its okay... I wont hurt you."" But every time I keep coming back and its worse than before. Like tonight. 40 minute wait for a table after they tell us 20: check. another 35 minute wait for appetizers: check. Dinner showing up less than a minute after said appetizers: check. The experience was awful, that is until my below room-temperature pizza showed up. Never has any restaurant captured the delicacy of left over pizza so well. ...hey assholes if I wanted cold pizza I could make it myself using my fucking fridge. Anyways as I type this on my phone I'm still here waiting for my check... Slowly slipping into insanity. Tell my mother I love her."
Maryam M.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,23,14,1.0,3/29/2012,"The burgers were AWFUL!! They weren't seasoned at all. Even the manager admitted that the bacon was undercooked! Even with the burgers off the bill, 2 beers, stuffed mushrooms and a single bowl of chowder was over $30!! Never again!!"
Michelle J.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,10,,2.0,11/19/2014,"Okay so I went back to BJ's this past Friday.  Totally different experience.  My mom knocked over two glasses of water that were on the table spilling it all over her lap, on the floor. You get the picture.  We told the server who said he was going to get someone. Five minutes, ten minutes....no one came. My mom, soaking wet,  had to go to the host, who in turn found someone to clean up the mess.  Then my mom ordered the Lemon Thyme Chicken with the Brussels sprouts and I ordered the Mahi Mahi with Pineapple Fried Rice. It wasn't even close to the first time experience.  Maybe a different chef.  The icing on the cake, my pineapple fried rice turned out to be rice pilaf.  We shared this with the manager, who proceeded to look at my plate and said, ""It looks like brown rice to me. They just forgot the pineapple.""  I know what brown rice taste like and it wasn't brown rice.  He did bring me a side of the brown rice and a side of the pineapple....whatever.  At that point, I was done.  He then had a discussion with my mom on how she was probably mistaken the last time she was there because that is how they always serve her dish.  Really????  My mom was so excited to go back there and to share her first experience with my grandmother, who was with us. Very disappointing.  The reason I'm giving them 2 stars....our new server, that took over for the one that let my mom sit in water, was amazing.  I don't remember his name.  He's a law student at UCLA and I believe he is from Texas."
Fanon P.,"Los Angeles, CA",215,388,248,4.0,5/12/2010,"Okay first of all my fellow yelpers  my rating is based on the alcohol not the food here!!! I give the food three stars, but this is about those kick ass beers & lagers they have. Man those things will knock you right on your bum, I  had jerimiahs red mixed with the berry cider.  So good I want to drink that everyday and become and alcoholic because of it! My uncles from England and he loves his fair share of snakebites & what not, if your into that type of stuff this place will float your boat. the service here is really good too. Its nice and spacious and made just for large party's it seems. Okay the food... the pizza doesn't excite me, the pasta is okay but gets boring quick, sandwiches are okay, burgers are pretty good! Apps are good to I had the calamari and it was pretty tasty. Though After one of those Jermiah reds the table cloth will probably taste good too? Hey but its all about the beer here beer beer and more beer. They let you sample all kinds too!  So go there and be a lush! get a snake bite!"
