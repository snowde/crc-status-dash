Eric M.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,14,,4.0,9/7/2010,"My wife and I had a GREAT dinner and drinks here over the weekend. She really liked her fish tacos, and I LOVED my pot roast sandwich (one of their ""Knife and Fork Sandwiches""). I loved every single detail about my food.  We each had one of their specialty beers, which were very good. There was lots of waiters, and our service was very good. Even the music on the P.A. was very good.  We parked in the parking structure of the mall (this restaurant is on the north end of this large fancy mall. There's the option of dropping off passengers at the restaurant's door, or using the valet.  Referring to someone elses review ... If you're afraid of black people, then screw you anyway! I'm an average white guy ... who cares about race! It's a very nice restaurant, and a very nice mall, in a nice neighborhood."
Danielle B.,"Los Angeles, CA",16,11,1,1.0,3/24/2014,"Well according to our receipt our server was ginee. She forgot our appetizer and never came over to say anything we had to stop her and mention it. She said she forgot and we didn't get it at all. When we got our food it was cold and had to wait about 10 more minutes for hot fries and it was another server who helped us with that by asking how out food was because ginee was still no where to be found. She told us we could pick a dessert on the house. Finally when she checked in saying she had already chose a few different desserts for us. Which whatever but like any normal girl I would like to choose my own dessert. Well when we got the dessert it was one of the mini cookies that usually come in threes. We got one cookie and one spoon. So much for the ""few different"" desserts. Nothing was taken off of our bill and the attempt at a free dessert was sort of pathetic. At least give us a whole dessert if nothing else.  We won't be returning."
Meredith T.,"Los Angeles, CA",28,54,4,4.0,5/3/2013,"We had Oscar in the bar area & he was wonderful! Things were taking a bit long but as soon as we let him know we were on a tight timeframe, everything moved much faster. I would definitely sit in his section again."
DL W.,"Los Angeles, CA",94,28,,4.0,1/26/2013,"I know this place has had some bad reviews, but I really wanted a good beer and a little bar food while running a bunch of errands at the Westfield Mall. I sat at the bar where a very helpful bartender helped me choose one of the house beers on special. It was a very lovely red beer. I had the boneless wings with the hot sauce and a Caesar salad. The salad was perfectly dressed with just the right amount of cheese and croutons that weren't rock hard. I liked the boneless wings, too. The chicken was tender and juicy. There was a nice crispy coating. But the sauce about burned my lips off. I'm a lightweight where spice is concerned. I know people who would love that. Still, they were good enough that I nearly finished them. I found the service was prompt and friendly. I really liked the bartender. I can easily see myself returning."
Amanda n Roger C.,"Oxnard, CA",0,6,,4.0,8/23/2011,"My husband loves this place for watcing a game and having a beer. It's a little loud for my tastes though.  But I do like some of their homemade draft beers. Their food is decent. They have flatbread pizzas for 1/2 price between certain times and they are delicious. Could use a little more toppings on them but they taste great!  They have deep fried artichoke hearts that are good too, and I love their Garlic salad dressing and homemade croutons. It's not so great when trying to wait for a seat in the general restaurant area so we usually end up sitting in the bar area when we come here.  I wish there was a 3 1/2 star rating, but I'll round up since they are slightly better than 3 star in my opinion. Just depends on when you go. Parking sucks because it's located in the mall and there's not enough spaces on their end, and who wants to pay for valet at a sports bar?? But overall BJ's is worth checking out, and try the Mediterranean flatbread pizza when you do! :)"
Cathy K.,"Orange County, CA",600,427,77,2.0,10/23/2009,"If ever I'm in dire need of... oh... say a few hundred thousand dollars... this is where you'll find me. The place is a lawsuit waiting to happen. From start to finish, I feared for my life as I barely managed to maintain my balance on the slippery slick floors.  Either they'd JUST gotten a fresh wax job, or the floor must be caked in grease.  I didn't look closely enough to figure it all out, but what's important is, if I didn't possess crazy ninja balancing skills, I would've broken my neck on multiple occasions. That being said... The pizza, beer, pizookie, and service were on par with any other BJs I've ever been to. Again, just watch out for the floors.  Definitely don't venture there unless your feet are encased in hardcore rubber soled shoes. Consider yourselves warned."
May Z.,"San Gabriel, CA",2,90,9,5.0,1/7/2013,"We three girls tried this place days ago, had a great time. We went about dinner time, and waited for like 20 minutes. The staff were all very friendly. We ordered (forgot what exactly, lol) the appetizer combo, a Thai pizza, a dessert, and some other stuff, lol...All very tasty. It's a very busy place, great for friends and family."
Toni G.,"Leimert Park, Los Angeles, CA",26,3,8,4.0,5/2/2012,"Management, servers, host and cooks are awesome! I always have a great time here and the presentation of the food is appealing to the eye and palate. I've been here with my friends, Grandmother, and significant other and it's a restaurant that everyone can appreciate!!!"
Edwin M.,"Los Angeles, CA",29,13,,3.0,6/5/2011,"This BJ's is...ok....? They are ALWAYS busy. No matter what time of day, they are ALWAYS busy. I've tried coming here numerous times and have only gone in once because it's always busy and the parking really really SUCKS. The servers are friendly. They're pretty attentive in consideration with the amount of tables they must serve. It's just like your average BJ's, only probably louder. I'll give this place a 3, but I'm leaning more towards a 2. The servers were the only thing I liked about this BJ's. The wait for everything was average, but when I got my Fettuccine Alfredo, it was cold and it was kind of gross and that is usually my regular dish when I go to a BJ's."
Sue Z.,"Playa del Rey, Los Angeles, CA",474,451,120,2.0,10/27/2009,"Update of that night:  the food here wreaked havoc on my whole digestive system all night. random stomach pains, horrible gas (yep, i said it!). and overall feeling of shittiness. the only other time i felt this bad, was when i decided to have a late crack-ho-bell meal. skip BJ's, and go to cheesecake factory. unless your significant other finds gas sexy..."
Kari S.,"San Diego, CA",78,385,43,2.0,3/12/2010,"We were on our way through LA on our way home and stopped here for lunch. We have been to the BJ's in La Mesa so we thought we would grab some pizza for lunch. Big Mistake!! The service started out pretty good, placed our order for appetizers and our entrees. It took a half hour for out appetizer to come and out and when it did it was cold! We ordered mozzarella sticks and the cheese wasn't really even warm...it was like hard string cheese with a fried coating.  About another twenty minutes later our entrees came out and weren't much better! I had the BBQ Chicken sandwich and my husband had sausage and pepperoni pizza. I think my sandwich was sitting there waiting for his pizza to get done. It was only slightly warm and the ""toasted"" bread was super greasy and soggy. My husband's pizza was hot, but it had tomatoes on it that he didn't order and it had a chemical taste to it! Such a disappointment! Waste of $42!"
Patrick O.,"Redondo Beach, CA",417,607,51,1.0,10/27/2009,"No. Bj's has great pizza and is usually a pretty good fail safe if you should ever desire a chain experience. This location however, sucks. We showed up Saturday night to grab dinner just before heading out for the evening and the place was JAMMED, expected of course as it's still very new. Instead of waiting we opted for the bar because it's first come, first serve - obviously the quicker choice. 10 minutes go by, no table. 20 minutes, no table. 30 minutes, table is about to leave boo-yah!  Table doesn't leave, they just hang out and talk, grrrrrr Then it gets better, this blonde woman who literally just walked in walks up talks to the people whom have seen me eyeballing them for the past 30 minutes and just claims the table.  I'm mindblown at this point, did she just really do that?  So additional friends arrive and then when starting to ask about the table that's leaving behind me this woman has the nerve to get catty with me and say ""That table is ours"". Listen lady, I may be from Colorado but you just made Ari Gold come out full force. ""Oh it's okay"" I say, ""It's not like you haven't seen me waiting here the entire time"" to which she snickers. Well, what's a guy do when cat claws are being thrown at him? He bites back like a rabid dog. I then look at the bartender and say ""Round of beers for that table on me, don't tell them who it's from though""  Heh-heh, looks like her table is now stuck for another 15 minutes or so to which in that time, we all get seats at the bar, I love how Karma works. This place is now on my shit list for assholes, I'll go to the other locations if I'm wanting it that bad."
Tameka H.,"Los Angeles, CA",121,277,50,3.0,2/2/2010,Uuuumm... parking sucks ! Valet dude won't tell you that its full. Expects you to be a psychic. Wait time is half an hour. I got love for BJ's cuz they have good food but this location sucks.
Darla K.,"Burbank, CA",35,50,5,3.0,11/20/2010,"I like BJ's, I go quite a lot with my husband and our friend. We always get the same thing. Their Parmesan Crusted Chicken is out of this world good! I absolutely love it!! My husband always gets the Baby Back Ribs, but the last time he decided to be adventurous and try something new. I don't think he'll do that again! He got one of the Pasta dishes and it was horrible to the point he didn't eat and didn't want anything else.  So I give them 3 stars for our fav dishes, plus the pazookies, but not so great for their other food."
Melissa E.,"Ridgecrest, CA",90,83,57,3.0,8/2/2012,"The service is always mediocre here and I always get the same thing because I'm nervous they'll screw up my food like they did the first time I visited this location. My burger practically got up, moo'd at me, and walked away it was so rare ... I ordered medium done ... so now I only order pizza or a salad. The waiters are young and seem like they have little to no experience. If I'm gonna get bad service I'd rather go to the sushi joint around the corner and get bad service with my delish sushi. IJS."
Charles D.,"Los Angeles, CA",37,49,13,1.0,10/9/2011,"My God. Why me? We went to Target to get some toys and clothes for our 20 month old boy and since it was 6:30 pm thought we'd drop by BJs for dinner. I'd been to the one in Westwood many a time and always had great food, beer and service. We had no reason to expect anything different from this BJs. Good lord, what a nightmare! Things started off promising. The hostess took our name and said it would be a ""minute or two."" That is the last time they were accurate about anything. Eric S., our waiter, a seemingly affable young chap took us to our table and said he'd get us a high chair ""right away."" Well, five minutes isn't too bad. We were willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. Then he told us about the specials and took our beer orders. We asked him for water since our baby boy's sippy cup was almost empty. He assured us we'd get it. After about fifteen minutes our beers came. We asked again about the water. He assured us we'd get it then took our pizza orders. Twenty minutes later our pizza arrives. No water. Our kid eats some of the not-so-tasty and dry pizza and is getting thirsty. I ask the busboy if he would give us water, saying our kid is real thirsty. He says he'll get some ""right away.""  It's been about a f*cking hour and no one has come by to give us water!!??? WTF? Our waiter comes back and we tell him we want water and crayons for our kid. He comes back with the crayons and apologizes for forgetting the water. IS THERE A F*CKING SHORTAGE OF WATER IN BJS' or something??? We'd be happy to pay for extra. Finally, my wife, in disgust, gets up and walks to the bar where -- surprise! -- she runs into our water who, I guess, finally got tired of hearing us request this and was getting our water. She takes it from him and comes back. The waiter comes back and take another drink order from me and says our special comes with a dessert so we ask for the pazookie. By now, we put the pizza away in a box -- not too impressed with it. Very dry. 10 minutes go by. 20. Finally my 2nd beer arrives. Another 20 minutes go by and still not damn dessert. It's been at least half an hour since he took the order. In irritation I get up to the hostess and tell her to cancel our dessert we want our check and want it now. It is now 2.5 hours since we arrived. The waiter comes by fifteen minutes later with a vague apology and a smirk and starts to walk away. I say, ""hold on dude. I'm 45 years old. I've been going to restaurants since I was five. I've been to London. I've been to Paris. I've been to NYC - I've been to Vietnam. I've been to Hong Kong. And this, my friend, is the WORST service I've ever had in my life."" He wants to know why and I tell him about the water fiasco; he has the nerve to say, ""well I met your wife at the bar"" -- what an idiot! I say, ""yes, you did but we had asked your and your busboy FOUR TIMES before you bothered to get it."" He apologizes and says something stupid about the ""system crashing."" Why do waiters always use that excuse? Like that stopped them from serving water?  I sign the bill, see that nothing was comped and give the guy no tip. Thanks for nothing, BJs."
Lok Man F.,"Playa del Rey, CA",77,163,249,1.0,10/28/2009,"Bad experience on a Friday night! My husband and I went to BJs when it was 6pm, but the line was already long. We waited for 35 minutes before getting to sit down.  After we sat down, we waited for more than 10 minutes. Our server has not shown up at all. Another server came by and brought us drinks and took our orders. Finally, our server came by after 15 minutes and told us that he has put in the orders for us.  We ordered calamari for appetizer, a mini pizza, a chili baked potatoes, and a side of caesar salad. After 20 minutes, our appetizer still didn't come! We were so hungry and not happy.  At the end, food was here. But there were only pizza and potato. I told the server that our appetizer and our salad were not here yet. The server came back and told us that those orders were not in. My husband got mad and told him to cancel both. The server knew that it was bad, so he went in and brought us the salad after 10 minutes.  The music was loud, and the room was cold. The food was ok, but not great at all. We waited for that long and we were not full at all.  When we got the check, we saw that the salad didn't count on the receipt. That's the only thing that we were happy about.  Overall, it was a horrible night. I hope this is because the place is new open, that's why everything is horrible. I may go there again after a few months. But that will be the last chance."
Diana M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,6,,1.0,9/5/2014,"I've been to this BJ'S twice, and both times I experienced bad customer service. I placed my order online and once I arrived none of the employees acknowledged me.  About 10 minutes past when I decide to ask for help and a employee said ""just wait there"". Okay, another 5 minutes later I was still waiting. Then another employee tells me to go the bar to ask for my order. (I'm thinking..isn't that your job!. Okay) So I go and ask for my order at the bar and the gentlemen there doesn't know anything about a ""to go order"" and tries to help me with a better attitude. Seriously, it shouldn't take almost 20 minutes to pick up a to go order!!!. The second time I ordered, my BF went to pick it up and was told to wait for the order. His exactly text to me was ""HORRIBLE SERVICE"". Honestly, I've worked in restaurants so I know exactly how situations like these could have been handled better, so I'm not trying to be mean but this locations REALLY needs to improve in their customer service. All my coworkers stopped ordering food from this BJ'S for the same reason. I truly don't recommend anyone to come here.  Luckily for you there's many options near by, so don't worry!!!!"
Bob L.,"Laramie, WY",11,259,6,5.0,11/26/2012,Brought a date here. She liked it and I liked it too.  The night ended a great success! ;)
Jess P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,15,4,1.0,3/29/2010,"BJ's BJ's BJ's...  The first time visit, I went with a couple of friends, horrible service! The guy was ignoring me and even forgot my drink! wow. I almost ate it due to their slippery floors! I don't know why I went back but I did. The second time I went, totally different waiter, horrible service too! She forgot to give us our utensils and hardly came around. I'm not the only one that has experienced horrible service at BJ's, I know other people that have had the same experience. A thing I most add as well, their food isn't even that great! Sorry but got nothing good to say about this restaurant. Never going back again, that's for sure."
