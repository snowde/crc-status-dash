Wallace R.,"Inglewood, CA",50,7,3,1.0,10/23/2011,Found a bug crawling in the salad. Manager took 50% off the bill and offered a sincere apology. Not enough for us so this was our last visit.
K B.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,13,,2.0,6/16/2013,"Like others that have reviewed this restaurant, I have been to other BJ's and I have always had a great experience. But this was not a good meal experience. To be fair, our waitress was very good. She was friendly, considerate enough to check up on us through our meal, and even brought us Father's Day glasses when I didn't know they were giving them out. Where things fell apart was with the hostess, other wait staff and food. First, I walked up to the hostess stand and the hostess and some gentleman were doing something on the computer. Rather than acknowledge me, or let me know they would be right with me, they ignored me and kept doing what they were doing. After several minutes of standing there, they finally helped me. Second, the wait staff didn't seem to know where an order needed to go. One staff member brought another table's order to our table. A waiter brought one of our lunches to a different table. I guess they don't know table numbers or something. And why they didn't bring all our items at the same time, I don't know. Instead, we had three different waiter/waitresses bring us our food at different times. Third, two staff members moved an empty table that was located behind me to another part of the restaurant. However, when they pulled out the chairs to get access to the table, they left the chairs where they were--which was right behind me. I mean directly behind me; I couldn't scoot my chair back to get out. I had to ask my waitress to move the chairs when she came to check on us. Lastly, the quality of the food was below what I am used to at a BJ's. We ordered the calamari appetizer and the portion was small  (not worth the $10 they charge even if it was good -- which it wasn't). I ordered a roast beef sandwich and my fries were soggy because the au jous sauce was all over my plate. One daughter had the lettuce wraps and the lettuce they used just fell apart making it impossible to eat; another daughter ordered the jalapeño burger which was burnt on the edges and only had three jalapeños on it; and then my third daughter ordered fettuccine alfredo which was pure butter. The alfredo sauce was more butter than anything else and the garlic bread was dripping with butter. Totally gross. We will definitely never return here and recommend you never go there either. BJ's corporate office needs to do a makeover here in terms of it's staff. There are some serious issues here."
Don R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,61,,3.0,6/11/2013,"This time I ordered the clam chowder sourdough bread bowl. Excellent, maybe better than the place on the pier in San Francisco. The two beers I ordered to take home were 50% more expensive than last time. Not cool. Otherwise I was happy with my dining experience. I was really hungry and didn't want to wait fifteen minutes to be seated at the olive garden"
Shalene W.,"Los Angeles, CA",16,67,3,2.0,2/20/2010,"The service is sloooooooowwwwww....... Do not go here if you are hungry or in a hurry.  My last encounter at this BJs lasted 4 hours! (1 hour to get a table, 35 minutes to find a waiter to take our drink order, another 30+ minutes before the drinks arrived and they took our food order, ....) The food, the environment, and the prices are good. The slow service and lack of attention to customers is really dragging this place down."
Kat K.,"Los Angeles, CA",1029,413,555,1.0,10/30/2009,"I was sorely disappointed.   Friday night, as expected, drew crowds from all over to this BJ's.  This location is a nice size - considerably larger than the one I frequent in Westwood.  I figured because all the tables were full, and there were plenty of people waiting outside to be seated, this BJ's must be jammin'.  I was wrong.   BJ's has mostly been a reliable chain with great food and decent service.  I figured that this particular location would not be an exception, but the events that unfolded tonight proved otherwise.   It only took us about 20 minutes wait to get seated at 8pm.  When we were seated, a cheery server greeted us and took our drink orders.  Her demeanor was warm and welcoming, though she seemed a little flustered and pre-occupied.  She came back to take our orders shortly after dropping some checks at other tables.    My friend and I sat nursing our waters while we hungrily awaited our food and eyed servers walking by our tables with trays of food for other patrons. Our food did not arrive for an hour.  By the time we had received our food, tables that were seated 10 minutes after us received their food 20 minutes before us, and the fries, BBQ chicken sliders, and pizza that we had ordered were barely warm.  We had just enjoyed our first sliders when the other groups seated after us finished eating and left for the night. Our server graciously offered to have a manager speak with us, to which I agreed.  After discussing the fact that we received food in an hour while other groups were being served much faster, the manager offered to zap our cold pizza in the oven and comp our meal.  She seemed to expect to see me jump up and dance at this offer, but I did not give her the satisfaction of doing so.  I was still eating my fries and sliders cold, dammit. First impressions are important.  While the location can hide behind the name of a good chain or brand, they still have much to prove since they are new, after all.  From a consumer's perspective, it was nice to have a free meal.  But BJ's is a business, and no business should have to comp meals and lose money for the sake of bad service."
Jacob P.,"Venice, CA",38,60,63,4.0,10/12/2012,"We came on a Wednesday, there was a wait. Bathroom smelled like p--. Service was Excellent. Food, beer, delicious. I like things a little sweet so, I feel the orange cream soda could use a little more cream."
Raquel R.,"Los Angeles, CA",347,500,313,3.0,7/16/2012,"Stopped in for a quick lunch while shopping at the mall. The service was a little slow at first but the waiter started to hustle a bit. Mediocre food, nothing special, I had the asian chicken salad and a lite beer."
B M.,"Los Angeles, CA",16,23,3,1.0,8/3/2014,"So I decided to give this place another chance....BAD IDEA! Customer Service was horrible, and everyone seemed confused. Let me be more specific the Take Out service was horrible! Maybe I'm being a bit presumptuous to assume the take out server would be friendly and hospitable, instead I got ""go ahead and tell me what u want."" The food was mediocre, not worth me returning. If I visit or recommend a BJ's Restaurant it won't be this location."
Winston G.,"Chicago, IL",374,771,18,3.0,7/15/2010,"3.5 stars. Good service, decent food - I like their wings and their California club sandwich.  TVs all around, so a good play for sporting events - watched the World Cup final here this past weekend.  I'm going to assume Sunday lunch time is not as busy as some of the other reviews have mentioned.  Location is good, right at the Fox Hills Mall.   You can valet ($5) or park on your own..."
K V.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,5.0,5/5/2011,I lOVE BJS.... The Oreo Pizookie is a Killer... Amazing dessert!! The Thai Salmon...Geeezzzzz... Ufffff Over the Top. I love this Rest... Wowww
Dan E.,"Culver City, Los Angeles, CA",1,24,,1.0,2/15/2013,Worst customer service! They take forever to seat you. Every time I have come here it's the same thing..
Paul G.,"Los Angeles, CA",26,30,5,1.0,2/5/2014,"Most horrible front service people! I arrived before 3pm...Very few people in the place..hostess was who knows where, she finally comes dragging her feet to talk to us...Short overweight latin a girl. She said we could sit by the bar...i normally never like to sit by the bar because you don't get a fast service,  I asked how long the wait, she replied 10 mins, I said it let's wait. 15 mins came and finally she took us to a table right next to the only party of people having a meeting. I asked polite if we could see 2 tables down so it wouldn't be so noisy. She said you can sit in the bar...i told her there are all those tables empty I am only asking to sit further.  She said I would have to wait. I got upset and just sat down in the table she put us at. Pretty silly but man the nerve and rudeness. I have business and if my stuff would ever do this to my clientele I would fire them up on the spot. Learn maners BJ and respect your clients that pay for a service!"
Pam M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,57,14,4.0,7/20/2010,"mmmmm, pizzookie! Not to mention, I have heard that a portion of the proceeds goes to benefit CFF (Cystic Fibrosis Foundation)."
ryan D.,"Marina del Rey, CA",3,40,1,1.0,2/24/2010,"I was so excited when they finally opened a BJs on the West Side. I use to go to the one in Woodland Hills when I lived in the Valley and the food was always good there, very consistent. The BJS beer has gotten better and way more consistent since they dont brew the beer at the locations anymore. This BJs is an entirely different story. I've stupidly given the place four tries. Maybe one out of the four times the food was acceptable. The last time was the last time. Never again for food. I ordered a classic burger and my girlfriend ordered one of their flatbread pizzas. The burger came out totally over done, even the bun was burnt. I told them to make it dry, no mayo no butter on the bread. The bun was saturated in griddle fry. I've worked in a restaurant before and its not butter, ITS GRIDDLE FRY, nasty shit you dont want to eat, and the bun was burnt to shit. I took one bite and immediately sent it back. The server was shocked : WEEEEELLL whats wrong with you burger sir?ummm pay attention and youd know is what I was thinking!!! You literally could squeeze the bun and griddle fry would drip out YUCCCCCCCCCKKKK HORRRRRKKKKK!!! She asked if I wanted something besides the burger, I said no. My girlfriends pizza was the nastiest pizza we both have ever had. The crust is a thin crust version of Celeste frozen pizza you get at the market. She had about 1.5 of the pieces and didnt eat the rest. It had a coating of grease on the bottom of the plate, inedible. Server didn't even ask why she barely touched it..FAIL! Its in the Fox Hills mall. Not really my crowd. Parking is a nightmare. That alone doesnt make it worth going to just to go to BJs. They have one giant screen TV in the bar area thats split into quadrants, not enough TVs for a BJs bar in my opinion. BJs you failed on this location. The food is horrible and the wait staff seems very rookie, thats why you get 1 star."
Martin B.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,3,,3.0,4/17/2013,"One of the best places to view a game -- good people, good food and great beer!"
Frank M.,"Buena Park, CA",180,192,187,4.0,11/9/2009,"The place is nice. I dont have much to complain about. I just know I wont come here often but the place is good. Came here with a group of about 6. They have a good selection of beer as one person had an apple flavored clear beer. It was pretty good. I ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken. Oh man, that shit was GOOOD! hmm. BUT it was packing calories like a mo-fo! but pretty much everything in this place kinda is. A friend had something that looked like a pizza but it was not under the pizza section. It was rectangular shaped and had avocados. Hmm it was the shiznit! I just looked at their website and they have MEATLOAF! haven't eaten that in a while.  The waiters and service was good. not bad. And they were friendly, even one of them got in a picture we took of the group. Will come again."
Ann K.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,69,7,2.0,11/10/2011,"Guess I'm running with the pack. Terrible pizza. I came with a friend who seems to like this place ( I think I need a new friend) bready, no toppings, I don't know what this is but it's not deep dish pizza. Service was just fair, our server was pleasant but had to flag him down for EVERYTHING. I swear he would have never stopped. The wedge salad was OK nothing special.  I truly don't get what the WAIT is about. I would never wait for this again."
Ken D.,"Los Angeles, CA",128,47,59,2.0,9/20/2012,"If it wasn't for the Happy Hour and variety of Beer I would opt not to come to this place. I have eaten at this establishment on numerous occasions with a group as well as alone and every-time without fail the SERVICE SUCKED, NO REALLY it takes so long before someone comes to the table and even after that it takes an eternity to get the food. I think for the most part the management is not attentive enough, they are so busy trying to help out the staff and aren't fully aware of the real problems in the resturant. I would never tell anyone to eat here but as far as the bar I might suggest a quick and ""I mean a walk up a get it yourself QUICK BEVERAGE.'"
Wendy H.,"Fairfield, CA",0,39,1,4.0,1/2/2013,"We were on our way home from the Rose Parade and decided to stop at a restaurant I have always had a good experience at. So we booked the reservation at this location As it is close to LAX. After we booked the reservation I read the reviews that slammed the service and gave the food marginal ratings.  After our experience I wanted to post this review. We had eight in our party. First the young lady answering the phone for the reservation was pleasant and helpful. Second we were greeted promptly with a smile. They gave us a nice roomy table and the service was excellent. Our waitress was so friendly and helpful. She also replaced my salad even though I forgot to ask them to remove the carrots. We ordered appetizers (avocado egg rolls,calamari, and potato skins). The egg rolls were great as always. The Calamari was excellent very tender and seasoned perfectly. The potato skins were just ok.  Personal feet they needed more toppings and seasoning. Everyone at our table was happy with their entree especially the burgers!  The best was ending the lunch with the pazuli dessert. It was simply excellent.  If I am back to the area anytime soon, I will definitely come back."
John D.,"Los Angeles, CA",107,49,,1.0,12/1/2009,Called in to cut my wait time in half. When I got there they said my name wasnt even on the list. I ask to speak to a manager after the host is reluctant to serve me. Waited ten minutes manager doesnt come so I speak to the host and she put me on this list and gives me a pager. I go outside and wait 30 mins. Come back and she said that they already signaled my pager. I told her it never rang. I ask her to just put me next on this list and I will wait right here and she refuses to do so. So I leave. More than an hour of waiting and no food. Very disrespectful to me and my date. I went there once before that and we waited like half an hour for seats. Then we order food which took about 50 mins to receive. People who came in after us got their food before us.  My friend requested some kind of discount being that we waited almost an hour for sauceless pizza. He brings us ice cream on a cookie and expects two grown men to share it. Fuck this place.
