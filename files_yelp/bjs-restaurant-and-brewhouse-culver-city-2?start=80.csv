Masoud R.,"Los Angeles, CA",112,14,2,3.0,12/10/2016,"The food was fantastic, the service was wonderful, we have a great time with our friends"
Nikki J.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,149,118,4.0,8/14/2016,"I always order the mahi mahi with shrimp and red quinoa (instead of couscous). Absolutely delicious!  This dish is a little on the salty side, so try it before adding additional seasonings. I also looooove their watermelon with feta salad. So refreshing!"
Jason L.,"Los Angeles, CA",673,478,951,1.0,8/20/2015,"I've been to different BJ's locations and I've had a good experience at all of them except this one. I called ahead to make a reservation but as soon as I got there, they told me that they were setting up the table. Turns out, we have to wait a whole 20 minutes for our party to be seated. So then, what's the point of a reservation? And it takes 20 minutes to set up a table? I don't think so. When we were seated, it took a while for us to order because our server didn't come around till 5-10 minutes after we were ready. On top of that, our food literally took forever. We were probably waiting a good 25 minutes for our food. Luckily, I managed to down 2 beers in the meantime. I might as well make use of the downtime.  Usually when I go to BJ's, I always order some variation of the deep-dish pizza. I love the thick dough, as opposed to thin crust pizza. This time, I got the Gourmet Five Meat -- medium size. What first irked me was the fact that the pizza wasn't properly cut! They didn't cut it ""deep"" enough!!! We had to spend the next couple of minutes cutting it ourselves. Somehow, the pizza this time wasn't up to par with my experiences in the past. It might have been due to the cold temperature that the pizza came out at. Not only that, I don't think the pizza wasn't properly made....Let's just say the people who ate the pizza spent some time in the bathroom. TERRIBLE. I mean the pizza had plenty of toppings, just not worth the end result.... Fix the service and chefs."
Mary C.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,38,,5.0,8/13/2017,We come for the pizookie!  I like the variety on the menu there is something for everyone in my family.  I love the wedge salad
Rebecca S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,10/9/2017,"Obviously you have to rate at least one star on Yelp but my review is actually a zero. My husband, baby and I came to this location yesterday and left after an hour of waiting for a server. My husband repeatedly got up to ask for a server and staff responded by telling him they knew it was a problem and they were ""looking"" for our server. Then we requested to speak with the manager and the manager never came. Our baby was fussing because we skipped his nap in order to eat out as a family on a Sunday and we frequently eat at other BJs locations without any problems. We never ordered or received water and no one apologized as we stormed out, hungry and irate. Clearly we will never return to this location and we will seriously consider if we will ever return to other locations. I left a voicemail and an email yesterday with corporate."
Alejandra A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,1.0,9/21/2017,"I don't use yelp often, unless I have a horrible experience. Our host was amicable and that's probably the only thing about this experience that deserves the 1 star. We were sat down within 5 minutes which was great. Once seated, I browsed through the menu while waiting for our waitress to take our drink orders. Over 20 minutes went by and my table kept being completely disregarded by our waitress. I understand the restaurant was busy, but it's common courtesy to at least greet the guest that was just sat down in your section and make them feel welcomed. After 25 minutes of seeing my section's waitress walk around assisting her guests I decided it was time to leave. I did not order anything did not even meet my waiter/waitress. Didn't even feel like it was worth speaking to a supervisor. I left hungry and upset. I will not be returning to this bjs. Hands down worst costumer service I've personally experienced."
Ioana R.,"Fullerton, CA",3,21,3,1.0,2/12/2017,"Let me start by saying this review isn't for the restaurant itself, it's for the horrible service they have! I don't usually take time out of my day to complain but this was just too annoying  Our server, Rachel, was very inattentive and rude. She came, didn't introduce herself then the nonsense continued. We ordered a medium pizza and she didn't even bring the little spatula for the pizza, had to get all in the pizza w forks to scoop it out. We only finished two slices of pizza and she comes to ask if we want boxes. She comes to bring the boxes, mind you I'm still eating and my bf across the table is done, and she hands me the box as I have food in my hand then I'm finishing up some fries and she starts moving the plate as I'm eating them... She then comes to pick up the check and I have a slice of pizza on my plate to eat it and she asks if I'm done w it trying to take it... We spent more time waiting to get in than at the actual restaurant, I've never felt more rushed. Horrible hooooorrible service. I've worked in customer service with food as well and although some people can be tough you don't take it out on other customers if you had a bad day... The BJ's favorite pizza though is delicious  Burgers are ok, not mind blowing though"
Meks L.,"Los Angeles, CA",63,94,8,1.0,5/22/2017,"HORRIBLE!!!!! Came here to have dinner with my family. From the start the server was rude beyond words. We ordered a bottled beer and 20 minutes later, he says he still waiting for the beer to come out of the fridge. WHAT? He gives us coffee doesn't offer sugar. He questioned us on everything we asked for. We asked for Caesar dressing, gave us ranch. And insisted for like 5 minutes that we said ranch. Why fight over dressing? We ordered dessert, it went to the wrong table. If you not happy with your job, QUIT. I eventually had to call the manager over and she says ""we been having issues with him"" THEN FIRE HIS ASS!!!!! Avoid this location like the plague. The drive to Downey location will make you a lot happier. HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!"
Jenn R.,"Los Angeles, CA",111,40,21,5.0,1/19/2017,"I'm so confused on why there are so many good reviews of this place and yet those reviewers only give them 3, or if they're lucky, 4 stars! I've been eating at this place almost every week for years (takeout every Monday, Asian Chicken Salad is to die for!) and often for dinner and considering it's such a big place with such an eclectic menu, I've been super happy with the food, beer, and service.  The ""to go"" lady is extra awesome and always has our order ready for us by the time I get there. They'll even run it out to your car!  But I digress. Did I mention I love their food? Besides the Asian Chicken Salad (!!!) I'm in love with everything from their Black and Bleu-house Burger to their Pizookie desert - even their side salad is awesome (it's a good size, has tons of toppings and their balsamic is delish!)!"
Pat C.,"Compton, CA",0,10,6,5.0,8/24/2017,"Never knew this location existed until my best friend pointed it out to me. Other than that I was going to have us all meet for my birthday at the Downey location instead. Since I live near the Downey location but my best friend lives in Culver City off the 10 freeway we wanted a halfway point for both of us so this worked out fine. It was small group of us 4 adults and 2 kids out celebrating my birthday last night over some appetizers, deep dish pizza, beer and the best part some pizookie. Everything went well, we had a great server at the beginning who unfortunately had to go on break right after he took our food orders and left his coworker Kayla in charge the remainder of the time. Kayla was sweet and prompt who complied with all of our requests in a timely manner but the other guy, who's name I can't remember just a short latino guy with a beard and mustache, simply made us feel welcomed. He was cracking jokes and reminded me of that one crazy ass cousin who becomes the life of the all family gatherings. In my opinion!!!! Now moving on to the food... the spinach and artichoke dip was good but not better than claim jumpers, the lettuce wraps were fantastic, the lettuce was fresh and the chicken was cooked just right. The pizza I was disappointed in, this place claims to be Chicago style but I'm sorry not even close hunny buns. I would gladly get on the next flight to Chicago and have a slice of Giordano's pizza instead before I have another taste of BJ's pizza. Sorry!!!!  I give this place 5 stars for the location, the parking and service hope to be back again real soon at least for the pizookie and another beer."
Brandon I.,"Inglewood, CA",28,8,2,5.0,8/12/2017,Excellent service waiter was extremely nice food was awesome had slick smoking pig pizza and Mediterranean tacos and you know I had to get a pazookie with the vanilla bean ice cream finger licking good highly recommend bjs for a good chill experience
LJ J.,"Inglewood, CA",10,182,23,4.0,8/20/2017,My server Christina was good and attentive she was a bit slow at the check time and pay time but it all gucci the food was good ...it's BJ's ....you really can't go too wrong lol I was satisfied overall
Sterling S.,"Los Angeles, CA",30,34,37,2.0,10/6/2016,"So, like the majority of reviews, this one is fueled by dissatisfaction.  My wife and I arrived exactly at 8pm and we seated promptly. There wasn't anyone waiting to be seated with the exception of a sizable party. I also noticed that about 20% of the restaurant was closed off. This tells me that this ISN'T a peak time. It felt like 15 minutes but probably more like 5 minutes, our server arrived. She was pleasant, took our drink order and disappeared into the either. Our drinks took another 10 minutes to show up. Probably because she was fulfilling what seemed like the entire restaurants drink orders. So after our server had distributed four thousand gallons of liquid refreshment, she returned to take our overly complicated order. Wife ordered a chicken something or other and I had the spaghetti with meatballs. Tall order for any chef.  Now seeing how this place had vacant booths and was partially closed off, you would think that the food would arrive promptly. Nope 9pm rolls around and I've decided it's time to have ""that"" talk with the manager. I saunter over to the hostess counter and request the aforementioned manager. I'm told she was paged and would be there shortly. I wait...and wait...and wait for this magical person with all the answers to arrive and eventually, my wife flags me down that our food has shown up. Praise the lord, our food is here. I give up on the manger and go eat my unremarkable food. (It's spaghetti so my expectations aren't that high to begin with).  P.S. Manager never came by to follow up.  We've finished our meal and are finishing up with a Pizzokie, which is really the only reason to go to BJs. We got to witness this mythical manager bossing (she's the boss, right) her staff around in a very unprofessional manner. Kinda like the way a sixth grader treats a fourth grader.  End of meal, we asked the server why it took so long and she said ""maybe it's because we're busy"". I pointed out that part of the restaurant wasn't being used and there are many unused tables. We paid our bill and leave.  We've been to this location several times and the ONLY thing that gets us in the door is some kind of incentive (tonight's was a bogo). It's definitely not worth the wait, the food is mediocre, the service is pretty much non existent.  Unfortunate BJs, you're not that good and you're management reflects that, all the way down to the servers.  (On a side note, my wife said the chicken was juicy...cold but juicy)"
Debi E.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,3,5.0,8/10/2017,"I have driven by BJ's many times but this was my first visit and can I just say I could not have been more pleased. Service, drinks and food was Great! The ambiance and lighting was perfect. Our server, Kathleen G, was wonderful, attentive without being pushy or intrusive. We got the baby back ribs and they were so tender they melted in your mouth. Rest assured I will be coming back"
Jeff S.,"Los Angeles, CA",57,111,58,3.0,12/11/2016,"As with all restaurants attached to a mall(or near a mall) you need to holster your expectations of service and food/drink.   Luckily, if you keep you expectations at a reasonable level you might be pleasantly surprised.  The menu is way to big to actually do everything to perfection, but the dishes we ordered weren't bad. (Ginger salmon & Cobb salad.  If you have a gluten allergy you will probably have to order with a manager.  Also, the name is weird; Just sayin'."
Johnny S.,"Los Angeles, CA",48,1,,5.0,4/29/2017,"Wow, what an amazing experience. After a long week I just wanted to spend a Friday night watching a few sports games and enjoy a nice meal and adult beverage. I was initially greeted by a phenomenal waitress named Courtney who was very personable and seemed to genuinely care about my experience. She recommended the chicken lettuce wraps and tomato basil soup, which were absolutely delicious. I was able to enjoy baseball tonight highlights on one TV and watch the NBA playoffs on another, while enjoying a Jeremiah Red (what else can a man want?!) recommended to me by Courtney. This girl knows what she's talking about! The Jeremiah Red is a delicious Irish red ale brewed by BJs, which I will be ordering regularly in future visits. Weird, but after a long week I feel like a night at this BJs has put years back on my life. Going to have to make BJs a regular Friday night ritual!"
Victoria T.,"Inglewood, CA",181,181,789,2.0,6/11/2016,"Their service and staff I think needs to take some type of personality and customer service courses. For over an hour, no one came to our table to check on us or see if we needed anything. Any items ordered were done because we walked to the bar and got it ourselves. That's so unacceptable. I saw over 20 servers there too. This is why I am sticking to the Woodland Hills BJ"
Asuna F.,"WINNETKA, CA",2,19,14,5.0,5/13/2017,"The service was wonderful! The staff was extremely friendly, always smiling. They put customers first, according to my experience. The food was cooked to perfection, I couldn't have had better Lemon pepper wings in my life. The wait for a table wasn't long, which is wonderful if you're eating for a special occasion such as mother's day. The place is extremely clean and I would definitely come again."
Diane R.,"Culver City, CA",182,47,16,3.0,6/29/2017,I've been coming here off and on since they opened. The service is okay and the food is all right. Just takes a really long time sometimes to get the check. Will come again. Our server was excellent thought!
Tommy V.,"Lennox, CA",52,1,,2.0,8/3/2017,"The worst service I EVER HAD !!! Upon arrival we were seated and sat down and given the menus, good so far, or so we thought. We literally waited about 30 minutes to get any service and it wasn't even busy. We had to ask another waiter for service and yet then we were kept waiting and we had to go to the hostess to ask to get some service. Finally after waiting, we were attended and got some service , thankfully the food was ready fast but even to get some water refilled took forever and our waiter was just talking to people on his other table. We asked for the manager and even the manager took forever and on the bright side we got 50% off."
