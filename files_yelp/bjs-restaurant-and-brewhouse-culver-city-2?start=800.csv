Dawn C.,"Inglewood, CA",20,35,4,2.0,8/7/2011,"I've been here a few times and its the same everytime. The service is bad for mediocre food. It tastes like cafe food instead of quality food. It gets pretty loud especially when a game is on, and there's always a long wait. The very last time, everyone's food came out at different times, the food was warm when it did come, they kept bringing us stuff we didn't order and they charged us for it even though we sent it all back. What should've been a simple family outing turned into a two hour catastrophe; over an hour for everyone to get their food and another hour to get the check and settle the discrepancies. I only like the drinks and the HUGE tv for game nights! And I love no matter where you sit you can see a tv. However I prob won't be going back. I'd rather drive to westwood. No huge tv but they have much better food"
Valley J.,"El Segundo, CA",6,63,,2.0,10/19/2009,"BJs, why are you now biting me in the ass after giving you a 3 star rating?  I was totally trying to pimp you out (which I thought you deserved), but, you came back and kicked me to the curb, didn't you? First of all, you're a BREWHOUSE.  One of your beers should not take 10 minutes to get.  I could see the tap from my seat.  PULL IT! Secondly, you burn your hamburgers.  Badly.  It needed a skin graft. Thirdly, don't close 25% of your seating area on a Saturday evening for a private party that had barely 20 people in it.   Lastly, figure out how to work your paging system for seat assignments.  It was bad enough the dude that looked like a lady tried to break in front of my wife to get a pager.  But then you went and seated him BEFORE us when we had equal party members.  Totally unacceptable. I may come back for the beer, but, I'm going to take the family back to CPK."
Isabella L.,"Culver City, CA",107,425,8,4.0,3/9/2010,"This is your standard upscale sports bar in LA. Definitely a consistent place to go. What I mean is like others chains, you know what you're getting all around: Service: ok/not bad Wait for table: can take a while, but now you can call ahead (and this place is bigger than other BJs) Atmosphere: Fun/can get rowdy (aka you can get drunk and no one will notice) Clientele: at this location I was expecting yuppies, but it was a very diverse crowd in age and ethnicity (plus); also mall rats (downside) Food: pretty good - much better than bar food - pizza is a yes Drinks: love the berry burst cider and overall good selection of brews BJs can be a fun place but beware is you are uptight. It is not for the sheepish."
Henan J.,"Los Angeles, CA",377,406,1169,3.0,5/25/2010,"Cool spot, nothing specifically different from the other locations though. The server seemed to be pre-occupied and peeved...i cant say it was because of our table. Hostess was helpful in finding the right accommodations, TV screens were all on the right NBA game and the crowd was vibrant. Had the Long Island, Shot of Something and The Crispy Calamari. (the drinks and food were GOOD)"
Robert B.,"San Rafael, CA",6,13,,1.0,1/24/2010,"After weeks of hearing how excited my coworkers were that BJ's was opening up just minutes from work, I thought I had to check it out.  First mistake - believing any of the hype - it's not THAT great, and while they have a respectable beer selection, it's not something that sets them apart.  The service was terrible.  We had three different waiters (I'm assuming the first two quit because they knew how badly they were doing) and the manager serve us.  All of them managed to forget to bring one person's food.  In fact, they forgot to place her order all together. We were a group of 5, so it's not like it was huge party. Then when the food came out, they lied, and said, ""oh, it'll be right out.""  Without verifying the order, they didn't know what ""it"" was.    Those of us who got our food were not impressed. It wasn't particularly hot, exploding with flavor, or even what I'd call ""good food."" The small sized pizza was more like a small sized pizza crust, with an extra small portion of pizza toppings.  Think giant breadstick, dipped in cheese and sauce.    The beer I requested, a seasonal pumpkin beer, tasted nothing like pumpkin, and barely like beer. It was weak in the flavor department, though thankfully not flat. Waiting an hour and a half (and reminding them about it 3 times) only made it that much more frustrating.   We ended up getting the ""forgotten"" meal to go, had to ask twice for the bill, and even had to request our cards back after paying.  While the rest of the experience definitely overshadowed any other gripes, the floor was not particularly clean, the tables were certainly not clean, and the atmosphere was more like that of a pub at happy hour - crowded, noisy, and a little smelly.   Unfortunately, there's no 1/2 star rating I can give this place, because that's a little more fitting. They DO have food, and they DO have beer, so I suppose 0 stars would be out of the question."
Evan G.,"New York, NY",220,729,356,2.0,4/18/2010,"I know it's a brewhouse, but the first six pages of the menu are drinks. Six pages. This is not a family album, folks.  It's a restaurant.   The beers are great, though.  The food is OK.  The staff wasn't really interested in getting our orders right or getting things to the table in the right order or at the same time.  Entrees for four of us arrived in three trips a grand total of five minutes apart.  And when the last to arrive is a salad, there's something wrong happening in the kitchen/expediter area. Not a fan."
Shane H.,"Los Angeles, CA",64,44,20,1.0,12/11/2009,"Fail. First couple times we went during lunch close to when they just opened. Both times were reasonable with standard service. Their Lunch Special is priced pretty good for what you get.... but this B.J.'s branch in particular has horrendous service. The food has been pretty decent for a chain restaurant and tastes as expected. The last two times me and my co-worker have been here has been the most terrible service I have ever seen at a restaurant. We are talking nearly 3 hour lunches. Who has time for this? First time, they claimed the computer had a glitch and our food orders never got put in.They tried to compensate us with some Mozerella Sticks after we had been patient for over an hour. I told them that is unacceptable service and we left with a 30 dollar gift card, plus our meals being taken care of, to-go. We felt it was the right thing to do and left with the agreement to give this location another shot. Second time, we decided to use our gift card. In summary, drink order took 40 minutes, food took an hour. Overall lunch, about 2 hours. The waiter tried to blame it on the bartender. Again, the service and wait time is unacceptable by any means. I work nearby and I don't have 3 hours to eat at a restaurant, nor do I think reasonable person does.  Their food is simply ""okay"" and far from being worth the time it takes for them to do anything.  You won't see me... or any of my coworker visit this location ever again. To the manager Liz: Thanks for the effort in getting us to come back a second time. We now regret ever setting foot in the restaurant and your efforts have completely gone in vain. Nice try."
Bob B.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",101,23,1,3.0,2/25/2010,"Beer selection and food here is great.  What prevents this from being more than 3 starts is the service. While the staff is friendly, the service is slow and so is the wait for everything here. This place is crowded from open-close it seems. Not a place for big groups yet, maybe after they have been oprn for a year or after xmas 2010.  Tip-sit in the bar area. no required wait list"
Paula D.,"Flagstaff, AZ",129,463,209,4.0,2/9/2010,"We like BJ's Brewhouse! We came here for Super Bowl Sunday to root on the New Orleans Saints. Yay! We ordered cocktails to start, Strawberry Splash, Washington Apple (Yum!), and BJ's Top Shelf Margarita, then a pitcher of Samuel Adams.  We had the Garden Medley Salad - a huge salad, very tasty and the feta cheese on top was really soft and tasty, made the whole salad irresitable. Then we ordered the Best Beginings Appetizer Combo - the Avocado Egg Rolls and Santa Fe Spring Rolls wer so good! We also ordered the Piranha Pale Ale Nachos. We asked if the jalapenos were hot. They were not so we requested hot sauce. When we got to the bottom of the pile the chili was really good. Next time I am ordering extra chili on top. What is it with jalapenos lately? They have no spice, no flavor, in fact, I am finding them to be a bit sweet. We want HOT jalapenos!! If not, then start cutting some yellow chili or habeneros! It's ridiculous that I have not had a decent jalapeno in so long when ordered. Everything at BJ's was nice. We were seated in 10 minutes. They gave us a booth that was behind the big screen then we requested another table that was in the middle and all the teles were visible. We were happy. I like the way the hostess was nice and friendly. Didn't smile much but friendly upon approach. We want to go back and try the pizzas. They looked really good. We also want to try the Sunday Brunch one of these Sundays."
Eileen R.,"Los Angeles, CA",55,15,1,4.0,4/22/2010,"This is a great spot to meet up with friends either for a bday, a social gathering, happy hour or to celebrate a graduation, a family outing...it's sort of a 'one size fits all'.  The food is pretty good with pretty large portions and the prices are decent.  Being an avocado lover, I usually order the avocado rolls.  I just visited over the weekend and tried the Platinum Margarita.  It looks like a martini, and it is more than delicious.  I ordered two. The service is really good and the restaurant is clean.  Great atmosphere.  Since it's next to the newly renovated Westfield Plaza, (to those of us who have been around long enough, it will forever be FOX HILLS MALL!) you can always go shopping after you eat, and walk your food off."
Hanh S.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,55,5,1.0,5/18/2011,Had to go here for a dinner meeting.  Pretty terrible customer service compared to any BJ's I've been to.  Server was incompetent and rude.  Ended up getting my food to go. Oh and a fire broke lose behind our table and a manager did not come to apologize.
K S.,"Los Angeles, CA",16,7,,2.0,1/5/2013,"Double-check your take-out order. One of my items was completely missing despite the woman going over the order item by item. I realize I should have checked myself, but you would think that if she is checking stuff off that she is actually paying attention. This is not the only location I have experienced this with so it makes me think that BJ's needs to find a better way to ensure that they are putting together the orders acurately,"
Megan S.,"Atwater Village, Los Angeles, CA",351,304,59,4.0,2/24/2010,"Here's a good tip for the next time you go. When you think BJs, think BAR JOINT. The main area crowds really easily because of the restaurant's extremely visible location, but if you have a party of no more than four or five people, have one person scout out the bar tables...you'll probably get lucky. If you have never been to a BJs, TVs are everywhere. They've got to get some kind of discount from Best Buy for these babies, because they are everywhere you look and showing all different sports.  I highly recommend this place for watching football, basketball, baseball, and I can imagine it would be great to watch the Olympics at right now. The bf and I found a table at the bar (luckily) during a late afternoon rush of shoppers waiting at the entrance. We were served very quickly and our waiter was more than attentive even though they were packed.  Starving, we ordered the artichoke dip, field of greens salad and BJs favorite pizza. Way, way too much food for two people. Artichoke dip was good, but the chips were a little stale for my liking. Field of Greens salad was great, and BJs favorite pizza was delicious, deep dish with tons of great flavors and a good topping distribution. I know this place is a chain, but they do things well here, at least in the bar area.  You get a wide range of people here, from the shoppers, to the all girl parties, to families, to couples. Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves when I went, but maybe that's because my eyes had glazed over from the food coma. Parking isn't bad, don't valet - there's no reason to, unless your leg is broken or you are on crutches. Parking is free if you park it yourself.  This is the perfect low-key end to a morning or afternoon of shopping at the new Fox Hills Mall, which has been beautifully redone. Not a date spot with a girl who doesn't like sports or real-people portions, good for a solid experience with friends or family. Again - remember, bar joint. Sit in the bar area if you can. Avoid the wait."
Stacey N.,"Los Angeles, CA",22,25,,3.0,10/13/2009,"Living on the border of Playa del Rey, Culver City, Westchester, and Marina del Rey surprisingly leaves little options for pizza, beer and watching sports.  This is probably why when I arrived to BJ's Brewhouse on a Monday night for some football, beer and pizza there was over an hour wait.  Knowing that getting back in the car would only lead to driving around for an hour without being able to think of another place to do this (besides maybe Tony Ps in Marina del Rey) I stuck it out.  This new BJs is located in the new (renovated) Culver City Westfield mall and I think everyone is excited as I am to add a chain restaurant to a very barren area.   So the real reason for coming here was their claim for a Chicago style deep dish pizza.  I kind of laughed before even arriving because I am from Chicago and have never heard of a BJs before.  I ordered the BJs favorite which consisted of meatballs, pepperoni, italian sausage, mushrooms,  green peppers, black olives, white onions and seasoned tomatoes.  I ordered it minus black olives because black olives on pizza is repulsive.   I guess it was wrong to assume that although sauce isn't listed, it would still be there. It was not. I also could not distinguish the meatballs from the sausage.  The biggest issue is that this was not Chicago style deep dish... nor a deep dish pizza at all.  This is called pan pizza and in my experience isn't even close.  I know this seems like a negative review, but overall I still enjoyed the pizza.  The flavors are good and I had no problem eating half of the pizza in one sitting.  But, this is not deep dish and it doesn't even have sauce - so take it for what it is. The best thing about BJs is the beer selection and I thoroughly enjoyed my flight of beers.  I also had the BBQ chicken ranch salad which was fabulous.  Looking around a lot of the plates coming out of the kitchen looked good so I will come back - someday.  If you want to go I would wait until the hype of a new restaurant in town is over, and I wouldn't  go on a big sports day, and I probably wouldn't order the pizza."
Phoebe M.,"Hayward, CA",593,68,65,3.0,3/8/2010,"*We went on one of the busiest days of the week, Sunday, so please keep that in mind with this review*   I I am a fan of BJ's, but this BJ's is not the best in terms of atmosphere.  The food is great still.  But, the parking is horrible, the location is bigger than others I've gone to so that may be why it took slightly a bit longer for service and food.  Nevertheless, our servers did a great job with trying to keep up with our drinks and get our food ordered, etc.  We have yet to try going on a weekday but the food is still good (ordered the BJ's favorite), the pazookie (oreo flavored) is still great, and the fact that it's located in a mall makes it nice to walk all the food off after!  Just not on a Sunday when it's busy!  =)"
Rima T.,"Inglewood, CA",594,9,5,1.0,6/6/2012,Two friends and I decided to eat lunch at BJs on day we were having a good conversation waiting on our food then suddenly this dumb ass waiter dropped 3 tall glasses filled with ice and drinks down my back. Then he just walked away never came back never apologized we called for The manager 15 minutes later this idiot came didn't care didn't try to help us so we sat there thinking they will give me a shirt to put on nothing like that happend  I literally had to get loud for them to have some sympathy it took them an hour to give me a shirt and comp the food but we still had to pay for our drinks. It took them a whole hour to do something about the situation. A costumer that was there came over to us and told us she saw the whole thing and we wasn't being treated right she even made a complaint. It was crazy the worst restaurant i have been to by far.
Kamika K.,"Long Beach, CA",17,43,7,1.0,6/5/2011,Service was terrible!  Food was only okay compared to the other BJs I've been too. Management is not responsive nor accommodating. Waitress acted like we were an inconvenience to her. And!  Can I just say that when customers are seated it would be best to not immediately ask me what I'd like to drink before my butt even makes contact with the seat. Give me about a minute or two to see what you have. Sheesh!
S S.,"Koreatown, Los Angeles, CA",62,37,3,4.0,4/6/2012,"I always end up going to BJ's when I can't think where else to go. I have tried a lot of dishes and liked most of them. They do have a good happy hour. My favorites include stuffed mushroom, caprese salad, veggie pizza, Ahi salad, Parmesan crusted chicken and definitely oreo pizookie. Service is ok. Generally the restaurant is always  crowded, but servers make sure they take care of you. Prices are reasonable. Parking is easy in the mall."
Cindee G.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,57,38,5.0,6/23/2011,"I love BJs! I am a fan of their lunch specials, and of their mojitos they are delicious and straight to the point! haha"
Scott K.,"El Segundo, CA",6,12,,4.0,1/22/2011,"Of course when the restaurant is located in the Fox Hills Mall, you are going to attract various types of customers. It seems at BJs of Culver City, the less desirables tend to gather there, as you can see from some of these reviews. I make regular visits to this place, so I feel that I am better prepared to review the restaurant than the one-time visitor or the digruntled DMV employee whos boss just told her that she would only get an hour for lunch today instead of two...This review is strictly taken from the restaurant at night or in the early evening. The restaurant itself is very clean until the late night crowd comes and starts pissing all over the walls in the bathroom and leaving their hand towels strewn across the bathroom floor.  You must wade a through a herd of people just to get to the host stand and be put on a wait, its that crowded on a regular basis. The wait seems to vary from a matter of minutes, to up to 45 depending on what time you get there. The host staff is generally pretty solid. There are times when they seem a little tired and unenthusiastic by the end of  the night. But then again, you would be a little worn out too dealing with people swarming around you for hours on end. The service itself is generally good. Some servers are better than others, but I guess its the luck of the draw. They usually arrive within a matter of minutes, depending on how busy it is. I myself used to work in the service industry, so I know how it is. Unless many of the customers that I see, I know that I am not the only table the server is taking care of. Some people think that they are the only ones in the entire restaurant, which leads to a server getting behind on the rest of his/her tables. Most people dont seem to understand that. I know that if Im ordering a well done burger, its not going to be ready in 10 minutes. If my server has a armful of plates, its probably not the best time to stick out my glass and ask for some more water. As long as you stick to the menu and dont turn it into a do-it-yourself salad bar, everything usually goes off without a hitch.  The food itself is pretty good, depending on what you get. Going there to get a steak and expecting it to be like Arnie Mortons, youre not going to be satisfied. When something on the menu says spicy, its not going to be mild. If you dont like seafood, but the dish has shrimp in it.....what do you expect? Its good old fashioned unhealthy comfort food and beer to have while youre watching the game. You want it in 5 minutes, go to McDonalds. You want fine dining, go to Spago's. You want to drink beers and eat wings, go to BJs.....but if you do, please tip your servers. They deal with more than you could ever imagine.....And being a former server myself, I can only imagine what they deal with at BJs in Culver City."
