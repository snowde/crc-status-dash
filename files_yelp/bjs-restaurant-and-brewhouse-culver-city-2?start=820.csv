Joeanna J.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,18,,1.0,4/29/2011,If I could go below one star i would!!! I went here for my birthday and I was VERY disappointed with their food and service! Some of the people in my party arrived pretty late and the waiters hounded me about the extra chairs when they had more than plenty of other chairs available! Before I left I decided to complain and NOT a shocker when the manager made excuses for her rude ass employees! Never going to WASTE my money here again!
Marcello B.,"Inglewood, CA",3,5,,2.0,10/19/2013,"Food and service was good, but there was plenty of left over residue on the eating utensils and the wait was long even though we had reservations."
Victor P.,"El Segundo, Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,3.0,10/22/2012,Over all a good place to eat. We went to watch the football game but not really sports bar feeling to mellow and more like chilled place to relax and eat. But I would recommend the place
Karen L.,"Culver City, CA",1,23,,3.0,3/26/2014,service here is usually great but tonight it was just ok. the attitude of everyone working (expect the hostess taking names) was irritated and annoyed. giving 3 stars because I usually love it here. tonight was very disappointing.
AJ K.,"Alhambra, CA",205,247,20,1.0,3/4/2012,"Extremely Poor service and undercooked pizza, it's sad because my girlfriend loves BJ's. We sent it back and got the exact same result the second time. It took over 15 minutes to flag down our waitress again (even after we asked another waitress to send her over both times) to try and fix it, so I just put cash on the table for my beer and we just left. The really sad part was the beer was even a little skunky, but hell what can you do when you can't even find your waitress for the food."
Kay S.,"Colorado Springs, CO",17,58,4,3.0,2/26/2010,I like the food at BJ's. I like the pizzas and especially the meatloaf dinner. I love the beers and the beer sampler thing they have.  BUT.... This location's parking is absolutely horrible and it's obnoxious to get valet parking.  I will say that the service was pretty good though which is different than my experiences at other locations.
Roger C.,"Inglewood, CA",19,24,1,4.0,1/3/2012,Great mini pizza! Happy hour half off mini pizza..
Shannon R.,"Los Angeles, CA",288,110,2,4.0,1/19/2010,"OK atmosphere and great place to watch ""the games"". I like how the waiter worked with us on splitting up the checks and the pizza is FANTASTIC. Plenty of parking. Becareful, it's a popular place so waiting for a table may take some time. It seems like people come here to pickup dates too, so don't be surprised if you get approached by some cheesy person with a corny pick-up line."
Dr E.,"Los Angeles, CA",16,12,3,2.0,6/14/2011,"So, I brought my cousins to have dinner since we hadn't seen one another in a while. We came relatively late in the night and what a mistake that was. Our waiter wasn't the most helpful, but he tried. The waiter a few tables down from us kept muttering under his breath and cursing out his customers. The waiter behind us said he was going to shove something up someone's ass and it wouldn't be his pen. What kind of service is this? The professionalism went out the door tonight. I'm really disappointed in the service provided tonight."
B J.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,3.0,5/22/2011,Food was just ok. And the server was terrible. The atmosphere was nice! Plenty of TVs for the sport lovers! Maybe i ordered the wrong thing. I just ordered a burger and figured i would be safe. I was not impressed.
Olivia R.,"Newport Beach, CA",80,7,77,1.0,3/23/2012,"It was my first time at BJs and it was not a good experience.  1. Our waitress never brought us water 2. It took way too long to get our beer and wine 3. The salad I ordered  was the saddest looking salad I had ever seen. It was soggy with no flavor and it had some tomatoes thrown on it and a little bit of artichoke. They make the salad sound so wonderful on the menu and it was crap. I make better salads at home! For it being a 10 dollar salad I expected more then just some veggies thrown on a   plate wasn't even full. It was poor presentation and the quality was terrible. It looked like a very sad side salad. Plus it was missing some ingredients which were listed on the menu. It looked like whoever made the salad didn't care one bit. I think while they cooked my boyfriends burger they threw together my salad in 2 min and let it soak in the dressing for a good 45 minutes. I don't ever complain like this or write a review but that experience was terrible especially because I was so hungry and had waited so long for our food. It had no taste..and I sure as hell didn't want to eat soggy lettuce...so I went to subway after. Now that was good!  The waitress told me I wasn't the first to complain about the garden medley salad..so NO I'm not crazy, lol My boyfriend ordered a burger which he thought wasn't bad but not the best burger hes had. IF your going to mess up a burger there's something really wrong. The wait on everything was ridiculous. I don't think wed go there again but I did like their selection of beers. If anything wed go back for drinks. Also, after I returned my salad I wanted to glance at the menu again in case something else sounded good but then i realized I would of had to wait prob another 40 min to eat...no thank you. She never brought me a menu anyway. I had to get up and get it myself.  It was nice of the manager to come over and talk to me about it because someone in the kitchen isn't doing their job back there. I wouldn't want anyone to get their food they way I did."
Krystle B.,"New Orleans, LA",100,196,62,4.0,11/29/2011,"The server was a little weird and acted like she was trying really hard not be be mean to us even though we just sat down.  Other than that, I like the restaurant.  The food is really good and there is plenty to choose from.  Also, its clean and has a nice atmosphere."
Crystal C.,"West Covina, CA",1,20,,1.0,3/19/2011,I love BJ's but this one is horrible. The service was horrible and the food was worse. I thought maybe it was the day I went so I tried it a second time and it wasnt my imagination. DO NOT go to this BJ's. This is a bad one.
N A.,"Marina del Rey, CA",2,4,,5.0,1/17/2014,"I love their spinach and artichoke pizza.  I always order from there when I am craving deep dish pizza.  The Best Beginnings appetizer combo is a great option for three or more people. The ambiance is ok, nothing special- I haven't eaten in a lot but we used to get takeout from there often when I lived in Playa Vista.  So good!"
Carol T.,"Culver City, CA",1,11,18,4.0,10/5/2011,good amercian sized food!  awesome attentive service ! yes i would come back as it is neighboorhood restaurant. huge portions!
Jamie M.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,18,,2.0,2/12/2011,we where there last night and it was crazy  our server was too confused and it takes long time to get our order and showed up with wrong check
Michael K.,"Los Angeles, CA",27,16,2,2.0,2/22/2012,Turns out after I left with my daughter in a separate car that the manager came over and apologized to my wife and son and gave them a free dessert. For that gesture I am upping my rating to two stars. By the way the floors are slippery! I thought someone had spilled something!
dominique m.,"Los Angeles, CA",79,258,100,5.0,11/12/2011,Great restaurant service was a little slow but the food was hott and very good.. i love the cajun shrimp pasta!! great place to go and hangout w. friends or family meals
Kennya W.,"Compton, CA",82,106,3,4.0,10/16/2011,"Been here twice already. First time, the server sucked. My friend made a big ordeal about his service. She got a free dessert. Came here on thursday and we had the lunch special. My lunch was great and so was our waiter. I think I might be addicted to their ceasar salad because I cannot get enough. I've been thinking about it everyday now. Good place to watch sports as well, if you are into it."
T T.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,34,1,1.0,8/5/2010,"Worst Service ever!! The one star is because there is not a zero star option!   I and three co-workers went to this BJ's last night for a work meeting and we received the worst possible service ever!  Our waiter Carl was the absolute worst.  Slow, forgetful, and he did like 17 disappearing acts in our 2 hour time frame that we were there.  The best part was he actually disappeared the last time for aver 35 minutes and when I finally decided to ask for service another waiter came to us and told us Carl had gone home!  Great!  Thanks for the heads up Mr. Carl.  Food was great ONCE we got it but again food is great at any BJ's. At this restaurant your name almost has to be Tyrone or Lequisha for you to be able to even get service.  Absolute worst service and will never return."
