Maggie Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",39,267,15,3.0,10/25/2009,"I'm kind of wishy washy about BJ's.  It's a chain but it's better than most chains.  When I haven't been in a while, I think, ""Ooh, BJ's.""  But then when I get there, the service is kind of crappy and the food is just OK. You've got to love the pizzookie though."
Oliver Q.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,5,,3.0,7/27/2012,"Great food every single time. Just don't expect good service. The servers are all over the place, I dont think they work as a team per se. Just know going in youre going to receive shitty service and maybe be surprised."
T M.,"Santa Barbara, CA",2,3,,3.0,5/10/2014,Good Food. Enjoyed the in-house beer that they produce. Staff was friendly and made me feel very welcome.
Jocelyn M.,"Inglewood, CA",53,431,238,4.0,7/21/2011,"happy hour, half off mini pizzas!!! whooohooooo!! as far as regular hours go, i am not always keen on paying restaurant prices for pizza i can get at half the price, AKA happy hour, LOL drinks at chains tend to be watered down, so i normally get mine straight! its by fox hills, so prepare for the possible attitude and u will be fine. =D"
Wendy C.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,7,2,5.0,4/11/2014,"The deep dish pizza here is great! Love all the proprietary & craft beers on tap. The service is exceptional! a very well trained staff. Great place to watch a game in a good, comfortable & friendly atmosphere!"
Chuck P.,"Culver City, CA",207,32,,3.0,2/22/2012,I like it here - its close to home - next to Gold's to remind me to not go crazy eating and the food is OK - tonight we randomly ended up here - its not overly crowded but WOW is the service S L O W...come here when you are in no hurry
T. M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,91,,2.0,12/27/2009,"Do not call ahead of time, it does nothing and you have to wait forever just to get a table. You would think that if you called for a reservation that you would be seated promptly? Nope, don't count on it. I was soo hungry and ready to go into the mall just to eat.  While we were eating our food, we heard multiple customers complain to servers asking to speak to managers. They need better management maybe?  The best location is on Maui. You can't even tell it's a part of this crappy chain. They have better menu options and their pizza tastes wayyy better."
Kalin M.,"Los Angeles, CA",215,100,22,2.0,3/6/2011,"I will never understand why people like this place..I only gave it two stars because of the pizookie. Every item I've ever had tasted extremely bland! The people that eat here are obnoxious each times I've been here. I would never ever recommend this place to anyone, and I'd never come here unless someone got down on their knees and begged me to."
Alice K.,"Los Angeles, CA",562,397,97,1.0,9/15/2010,"EEWWWWW! The first time I came here was when they first opened, which was great cause I never been to a BJ's and the hype of the Pizzookie was what I was suppose to order, which was great. The service was great, since these new waiters were training and everyone was pleasant and happy they got the job. but last night, as soon as I walked in, I felt the place was just dirty. I know it was late and it was packed because of Monday Night Football, but it just smelled bad. I ordered a berry type martini, which tasted like simple syrup and when you get a martini, it usually looks and taste chilled, this just looked like corn syrup in a glass. My clam chowder was way too salty and they even said they would charge me for sour dough bread, since I got it in a cup and not in the bowl. Whatever.... I think I can afford 2 pieces of bread. I ordered the flat bread pizza. BLAHHH!! took one bite and said, I'll take it to go. Assuming I would eat it when I was starving at work and have nothing else to eat. The only good part of this place was our waiter. Very friendly, funny and just had a great sense of humor. He did ask if we wanted dessert. I wasn't going to risk another bad dish."
Jillian R.,"Brentwood, Los Angeles, CA",40,244,5,2.0,2/21/2011,"The service here was not good for a large group (15). We had a reservation for 8:00 & they sat us at 8:45, but then gave 2 complimentary appetizer platters, which was appreciated. Drink refills were hard to come by and the food came out sporadically. Worst of all, the floor is SO slippery throughout the entire restaurant. Why? I have no idea, but was told that's how it always is--I saw 2 people fall. As far as food, it's your standard BJs fare."
Abbi F.,"Los Angeles, CA",398,211,,2.0,7/29/2011,"The food is generally good for a chain as all things go.  This particular BJ's is ALWAYS packed at any time of any day that you would want to go to a BJ's to eat/drink.  On the up side, the wait staff has always been super nice & attentive.  On the down side, I've had to wait rather an appallingly long time for food on two separate occasions as well as had soup brought to the table cold (which was then returned, followed by a new bowl brought out that was only lukewarm)."
Jeff P.,"Phoenix, AZ",60,897,17,4.0,4/29/2011,Always love the huge beer selection. Great food too. Plenty of tvs for any game.
Mike L.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,1,,1.0,2/28/2010,"Location, location, location, but not this one.  Overall, my family likes BJ's, but this was the first time and last we will ever visit this location, and give us pause in consideration of others in the future.  The service was the worst I have ever received at a restaurant.  We arrived at about noon on Sunday and the restaurant was fairly empty and we sat down quickly.  And sat we did.  We were given kids menu, but no crayons for two year old; petty stuff but could tell where things were going.  Drinks came out relatively quick, but the appetizer took longer than expected and we weren't offered plates in the process. Over the course of the next hour we saw waitress once when she said we go check on food, but then didn't return for 15 minutes only to tell us something was messed up, it was being worked on and that the manger would be out.  Well, in the next bit my daughter was falling asleep, the food still hadn't arrived nor did the manager ever make an appearance.  Finally, we decided to take the food to go and I took my daughter to car.  It was another 15 minutes before the food was ready and my wife could leave the restaurant.  And in that time the manager never made an appearance.   I'd assume not everyone receives the same experience, but after all the wait, not to at least have the manage make an appearance and offer some form of apology is untenable."
London W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,,1.0,3/26/2013,This place is so shitty it took 30 minutes to get barbecue sauce the service is horrible and the servers are very rude don't every come here I would dear spend another penny at this place
Tracie P.,"Los Angeles, CA",22,27,,4.0,7/11/2011,"Lunch @ BJ's on Friday, July 8th, 2011 inside the Fox Hills Mall. It was my first time stepping foot inside a BJ's restaurant and I must admit that I thoroughly enjoyed the entire experience. The crowd was lively and our waiter was attentive and friendly. We had the most amazing appetizer - crispy wontons wrap and for my entre, I enjoyed the mini mediterranean pizza. YUM!"
Lailanie G.,"Los Angeles, CA",329,5,1,5.0,8/6/2011,"I love BJs! This is my favorite BJs that I like to frequent.  Great service, great food, and great for groups.  Wait can be long when it's busy.  Always have had great times here especially during game days."
Jason S.,"Culver City, CA",73,10,,2.0,2/20/2011,"The food is good, but the service and staff are not.  Very slow and bad timing despite the large number of people they have working at a given time.  Sitting at the bar is a better experience if you're not looking for a sit down dinner/table.  The curbside take out is a good option too if you live close by as it will avoid the experience of the servers."
michael r.,"Tarzana, CA",69,118,,4.0,5/23/2011,"Solid food, good bar, always consistent.  Love the pizza and the sandwiches, and the beer is wonderful.  Always busy, but I've always found it's worth the wait."
Crystal E.,"Crenshaw, Los Angeles, CA",44,18,2,1.0,5/18/2013,If it were possible to give this negative stars I would do it in a heartbeat.  This was only my 2nd time going to the BJ's in Culver City and my LAST.  1.  We tried to call to make a reservation -they tell us oh we aren't taking reservations until 9:45pm (it was 8:12pm) we get there and because we had a large party they ask us did we call ahead. Umm we tried to and you told us we couldn't do that. 2. So we talk to the manager because we were told it would be a 45 minute wait and it was an hour and a half.  Sooo the managers response was I can get you all some appetizers to eat in the lobby. WTF??!! Then she says well maybe I can get some crackers! WTF HA!  I could go on and on but I think you get the picture. It was a friends college graduation night that is the only reason we stayed. But unfortunately it a ruined night because of BJ's! But we laughed loud and hard at the absolute foolishness!
Thomas F.,"Santa Monica, CA",3,65,2,3.0,10/16/2009,"It is not my kind of place. I won't come back unless Tricia Helfer invites me. Actually, there were a lot of cuties in the place at lunch time. My friends enjoyed the place a lot. They loved the burger, pasta, pizza menu. Everyone loved sharing large pizzas and pitchers of beer, while looking at a Dodger game on flat screen. The desert of ice cream on cookies brought out special excitement."
