Kunal R.,"Culver City, Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,2.0,10/11/2013,Good place to eat if you have patience to wait for your order. Took us almost 2 hours to finish our dinner.
Natalie S.,"Los Angeles, CA",30,73,142,5.0,6/16/2011,went there for there happy hour and the service was great.Including the food and seating at the bar with booth and tables. The drinks are so good will go back again :)
wendy j.,"Playa del Rey, CA",50,43,34,2.0,5/29/2010,You can watch 4 innings of the Dodgers game without being interupted with your food. We ordered a sandwich and kids corn dogs they took over 40 minutes and the dogs and side mashed potatoes were cold. Plus I was charged twice.  It takes 10 minutes to be sat at an empty restaurant I'd hate to go there when they are busy.
Patrick T.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",35,23,,1.0,10/1/2012,"Arguably the worst dining experience from a service perspective I have experienced. The wait staff was late to the table, they were inattentive to just about everything - we had to constantly call someone over to refill drinks; we even had to flag down a bus boy to clear our table, as the dirty dishes were left in front of us for over 15 minutes after we were done. When they delivered a happy birthday sundae they actually put it down on the dirty dish of the recipient. To top it all off, the bathrooms were a complete mess and had no toilet paper. I could see this for a lower class of restaurant, but when you are shelling out this kind of money for a meal, you expect attentive service and clean restrooms. BJs - your food is good, why are you screwing it all up with lousy service? Train your staff and get someone in the bathrooms to inspect them!!"
Kay G.,"Los Angeles, CA",36,248,48,4.0,2/1/2011,"Usually all of the meals are decent... except for the beer battered fish. Absolutely flavorless and dissatisfying. Pizzas are good, burgers are decent. The lunch menu is delicious, especially the teriyaki salmon. Only get the pizookie if you plan on sharing it. I can get through Chili's molten lava cake but not a pizookie. Haven't exactly had bad service, just slightly ditzy attendants with the to-go department. Over the phone they never get the order correct. Call in ahead to reserve a table, especially on the weekends. We did once and instead of waiting 30 minutes, we waited less than three."
Iman Taliah H.,"Oakland, CA",38,65,15,4.0,3/12/2011,"This place was great all the way around!  Nice atmosphere, quick, friendly staff, and great food!  I had the shrimp tacos which were quite delectable.  Overall it was a great outing.  Our only issue was finding parking."
Fernando A.,"Culver City, CA",8,1,,1.0,6/5/2010,Dinning in is great but take out is a mess. It's too loud and when you go in to pick up your food you just want to run......
Poison I.,"La Puente, CA",10,39,7,3.0,5/17/2011,The lettuce wraps not the best skip it .....friendly staff nice place not my cup of tea but dont mind going
Nahum O.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,6,8,3.0,6/27/2011,"The day I went here was very mellow, there were about ten people in the place. Anyway, the food was really good. I had a turkey club and my girlfriend had a BBQ string pork sandwich. The proportions are really generous. The fries are bomb! And the pazooki was really good. The service was excellent. I was shocked at how cheaply priced the food was. I'll be here in the future."
Bennett Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,15,3,1.0,9/3/2010,"It was a big mistake to wait for 45 minutes to be seated at this place. And as soon as we got our tables, the waiter said that we will have another waiter to take our orders, that took another 30 Minutes to wait.  After he took the orders, we waited for another 20 minutes to check our food so he finally decided to give us bread and butter because it will take more time to bring the order.  The appetizers finally came, but the main course was served after another 30 mins to wait. At this time, our waiter left for the evening, and the other waiter took over to finish serving us. We were 7, and 6 ordered steaks, fish, etc., but the crazy thing was, the person that ordered the salad was the last one to get her food. It was very disappointing.  After the fact that we spent almost close to $200.00 for lousy service and not so good meal.  We will never recommend this place."
James W.,"West Adams, Los Angeles, CA",135,41,10,2.0,6/18/2013,"BJ's Culver City is usually our go-to spot for a guaranteed good meal. I usually get the Hawaiian mahi mahi and the other person in the party gets traditional buffalo wings and we order a half and half pazookie. The hostesses are always amazing as they were last night and they remember our faces and know how much we frequent this restaurant and usually sit in a booth in the bar. Last night we decided to go there after a pretty long hiatus and we say ourselves in a booth after a great enjoyable welcoming conversation with the hostesses around 8:45pm. We sat there in the both for about 7 minutes until our server came over. We even tried to flag down someone who we saw just standing leaning back against the wall by the stairs that lead up to the restrooms, he looked at us then looked away. Finally our server Travis came over. He brought us menus and said he'll be right back. We were like ok...after about 4-5 minutes he returned with waters and asked did we want anything else to drink or an appetizer and we said no thank u we're ready to order. So we ordered the traditional wings and Hawaiian mahi mahi. He left to quickly before I could ask for one more thing. Now we hadn't seen him even walk by to check on us until our food came when I wanted to ask him for limes for our waters. Our food was delicious as always which was one of the highlights of the evening. Then we ordered a pazookie at 9:06pm and at 9:11 Travis came by saying it'll be out in just a few minutes and we were like ok great thank u. 9:26 rolls around and he finally brings it over to us and we were close to canceling it because of how long it took. He said that the kitchen burned the first one which is what took so long...didn't really believe that and would've expected something a little more than a half-a**ed apology. The manager could have at least brought it out since Travis was very slow and we barely saw him anyways. When he brought the pazookie we immediately asked for the bill because if we didn't we knew it would be another 20 minutes before we saw him again. The crazy/funny/ironic part is that once I put the cash down for the bill he came immediately right back. That was the quickest we had seen him return and it was when it involved money. Tsk tsk tsk Tavis!! That's not a good way to receive a substantial gratuity. As we left the hostess continued be a highlight of our dining experience. The server was not an experience we're used to receiving and enjoying while there at BJ's Culver City."
Linda C.,"San Jose, CA",9,17,10,1.0,2/25/2013,"I'm sure We made opinions of the place very clear when we left the place but for good measure... Food: 3-1/2 stars Service: 0 stars management: -5 stars Didn't get upset when the server took all of 10 minutes to come take our drink orders or when she took another 20 minutes to bring them out because she was being chatty with another table.  Was a bit upset when we realized a drink got mixed up but mostly in panic.  One of the girls in group is allergic to strawberries got served strawberry lemonade rather than pink lemonade.  I told her that I needed to get Benadryl for the girl.  I only started getting angry when I had to stand there watching the server taking her sweet time going back to the manager's office. Management: 0. Took another 10 billion yrs getting himself out to the dining area n Rather than helping us find a solution, like call an ambulance.. Or tell me where the drug store is.. Instead he tells us: ""we can't give you medicine.""  I ran over that mall looking for Benadryl. Oh to fan my fury...!!!!! The manager...after the emergency is handled, by others and not himself, tries smooth things out by speaking to us in Korean once he realized we were Korean as well.  Really!????? To that food server: in case ur mgr didn't tell u, u don't take ur sweet ol time getting ur boss. Don't cause alarm to other customers but when u walk, u walk as fast as u can to grab ur mgr when someone tells u a customer of urs is allergic to something u served.  The mgr. Ur answers needed to start with ""we can...I can..."" and then add ""but cannot..."""
Hugo S.,"Inglewood, CA",157,258,77,3.0,2/25/2011,"The food is always good. BJ's always has soooo much to choose from. Pazookie, the best ever.. Good hang out spot with friends."
Michael L.,"Los Angeles, CA",27,8,,3.0,7/24/2011,Food was quick and pretty tasty and the service was also acceptable however the microbrew I just love ! Go for a beer and calzone!
Ed B.,"Redondo Beach, CA",1,38,2,2.0,9/18/2011,"OMG BJ's owners. Help. We were there for the opening and the service was so disorganized we all laughed about it. We went back figuring it was just because it was new. I waited and went back months later and it was the same thing. I have no idea what you are trying to do here with the way you divide responsibilities. Whatever it is, change it. People are really nice but the order is ALWAYS messed up. On the bright side, it has become a bit of a comedic relief. It's also walking distance from our business, which is a very large corporation with lot's of people. Lucille's will probably put you out of business if you don't adapt. Thankfully you have good value (food for the price that is)"
Lisa P.,"Los Angeles, CA",1198,1166,,3.0,5/8/2010,They need a bigger bar area here. I like BJ's but i dont like that you cant have happy hour not sitting in the bar. I went here at 10 at night and it was crowded. Amazed me. Maybe i dont get out much. Anyways our server was great. i just got a hamburger and a beer.
Erika T.,"Torrance, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/26/2012,"We are a fan of Bjs.....but this is the worst experience ever. THe service is bad, the food is bad and cold. Yuck! The waiters are horrible. First and last time we set foot at this Bjs. Never again. Nothing compared to Bjs cerritos or Torrance."
Kenghis K.,"Van Nuys, CA",1,42,,1.0,8/7/2010,"Over priced, small portions, and when I asked what the brewery special was the waitress just pointed at the card on the table. Also given the parking problem it just is not worth your time or money."
G A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,61,30,2.0,6/25/2010,"This place has been a total train wreck since it opened. I hoped that service would become more organized after a few months....no such luck. So sad to say, as I live right across the street from Westfields Culver City and I've always known BJs as a decent spot for a burger and a beer.  Every single time I have gone to this location, we have had issues. The last time was the final straw. Took some friends to BJs for a late 3pm lunch. When we sat down, it took a good 20 minutes to have our drink order taken and the restaurant was not even 25% full. The waitress was M.I.A while we were waiting, and waiting, and waiting for our food. 45 minutes later, our food came out...mostly. One of my friends ordered a grilled cheese sandwich with tomato bisque. All she got was the sandwich. We waited 5-10 minutes for the waitress to emerge from wherever she was to ask for the soup. 10 mins, 20 mins, 30 mins pass! We have all finished our food and the grilled cheese is now a cold cheese sandwich. The waitress would walk by every once in a while to mumble that the soup wasn't ready yet...finally, we flagged the manager to find out what the deal was. The manager was nice and said he would have a replacement for the whole order out in a few minutes and would comp my friend's meal. Thanks, but it was all a little too late. The majority of our lunch was spent complaining about the service and wondering how it could take so long to make tomato soup.   The place is always packed in the evening, especially on big sport nights...so I know this place has gotta be doing well financially. Perhaps this is why there is no incentive for them to improve on their service? Sucks for me, I guess."
D H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,30,,1.0,6/4/2013,"It was pathetic.  The service was slow, the food was cold and the help was, well, not helpful.  I will not return, as this was the second time we had a bad experience.  We will try the one in the South Bay if we feel masochistic again."
