Eboni V.,"Tempe, AZ",1,12,7,3.0,7/15/2011,"Hangin out with friends at the Fox Hills Mall prompted us for a bite to eat and a cocktail. BJ's was convenient. The hostess was not very friendly (no greeting) but she was not rude either, kind of like a ""whatever"" attitude. However, our server was nice and the ambiance was upbeat! The food was pretty good, I enjoyed the Fried Artichokes and my cocktail was delish :). My friends enjoyed their food ordered some to go."
Vincent A.,"Culver City, CA",56,29,,3.0,7/1/2011,"Ok I went back. Much better all around; service, food, everything. My only complaint is the value. Came out to $85 for two of us, though we did get a pitcher and dessert. Will probably be back."
D S.,"Berkeley, CA",0,17,,2.0,6/11/2013,"I've been to this BJ's a few times and really enjoyed their food.  Their fettucine alfredo is one of the best I've ever tasted.  The problem is about half the time I go there, there's an issue with the staff.   When I went for lunch I didn't seem to have a problem, but for whatever reason the rude waiters and hostesses seem to come out at night. One particular time I went to BJ's with a large group.  When the bill came we all divided it up and paid with either cash or credit.  A few minutes later the waitress returned with our money and a new bill saying this was a little awkward but we haven't given her enough of a tip.  For groups of eight of more they have a specified tip.  We were short less than a dollar.  The thing is I looked at the new bill and it was completely different from the old one.  The old bill had been a general bill, but the new one was for groups.  This one actually had a specified tip on it for groups of eight or more, and the initial one did not.  It wasn't a big deal adding in the extra change, but several of us paid with credit cards and had written the amounts on the back of the old bill.  When we explained this to the waitress and asked for the old bill back, she claimed to have lost it.  As a result we had to waste more time figuring out how much everyone was paying again.  It was pretty obvious by the end of the ordeal that the waitress had initially given us the general bill hoping we would give her a larger tip than the one mandated by the restaurant for groups of eight or more, and then traded it out for a new bill when the plan backfired.  If she had simply made a mistake she could have just told us there was a mix-up, but the shady behavior made it clear that was not the case.  Honesty is an important quality I expect from those I give money to, and I did not get it here. In short, the food is good, check out the fettucine alfredo, and if you want to go to this location try to go during the day.  If you have a desire to go to BJ's at night, I'd suggest trying another location.  Also there's not much parking that's very close to the restaurant and you will probably have to park somewhat far and have to walk some."
Jonathan R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,1.0,6/6/2013,"My wife and I went at 4pm on a Wednesday. There was nobody in front of us and it took us about 10 minutes to be seated -1 star. We were seated at a table that had leftover food bits still lying on the table and the seat. I requested another cleaning and nobody cleaned. I requested a second time and nobody cleaned. I requested a third time and nobody cleaned. We had chunks of pineapple, cheese and tomatoes on the table and seat. - 2 stars for lack of consideration, cleanliness and requests not met.  We waited 20 minutes before we saw our waitress and proceeded to order. We requested water for a drink and we were never given a refill until that waitress' shift ended and her replacement took over for the dinner shift. I ordered a Cesar salad and my wife ordered a steak-lobster combo. We waited another 40 minutes for our food to arrive. My salad came at the same time has her food and my salad was warm, wilted and soggy. Closer to the center of the salad pile were more acceptable, chilled bits of salad. It felt as though my salad was immediately prepared and then proceeded to wait under a lamp for my wife's dish to be prepped. -2 star for lack of service and unacceptable salad. My wife's steak was cooked to order and her lobster tail was just slightly over-done but it was still acceptable. White cheddar mashed potatoes were tasty :D We will not be going to this particular restaurant ever again. The baby at the table adjacent to us provided us with some entertainment while we waited for service. +1 star."
Bl T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,1.0,9/23/2014,"We have always loved BJ's. The kids regard meals there a huge treat.   One of us is there several times a month.  So we were happy to arrange a special celebration at BJ's for our father's 90th birthday, inviting 40+ family members for dinner.  It was sort of a Reunion since many of us hadn't seen each other for years.   HUGE mistake.  Somehow our dinner consisted of unsauced pasta with a few slices of chicken on top, wilted Caesar Salad, and melted Pazookies.  That's it.  The bill was nearly $800!  The Artichoke Dip was never served.  What got me was the pasta with no sauce or seasoning. None. Nada. Zilch.  They boiled some pasta and threw it on a platter with NOTHING ON IT.  $800.  The salad wasn't particularly fresh or well-dressed.  We were so embarrassed.  I have been apologizing to relatives for 3 weeks now.  I have no explanation for what was wrong there.  EIGHT HUNDRE3D DOLLARS.  The food should have at least been edible.  It should have included some proteins.  There wasn't even fake cheese sauce!  It was garbage. If you go to BJ's, go for a small dinner.   2-4 people so you can control the dishes served.  Do not go there for an event of any type.  They do not respect their customers.  At all.  I must end this so I can go apologize to some more relatives..."
Patrick M.,"San Diego, CA",17,44,,1.0,11/9/2009,"Awful service.  After waiting for about thirty minutes we still haven't had our names called.  Luckily, someone else who didn't feel like waiting gave us his name to use.  They called that name, then told us to wait another ten minutes.  Finally, we are seated.  We sit there like complete fools, for 10-15 minutes.  No server or any sign of recognition.  It is impossible to get their attention.  And on our way to our table the hostess knocked drinks all over a guest.  I felt bad for her and the wait staff because it was so crowded, but it was just such a bad experience we left.  Just got up and left after waiting almost 45 minutes for a table.  BJ's generally has decent food for a chain so I may go back in the early evening on a week night, but other than that I'll never go back to that particular location."
Phil R.,"Upland, CA",2,35,21,2.0,10/20/2012,"cant complain about the food, service wasent up to bj's normal standards."
Jeremy S.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",2,144,,2.0,10/3/2011,"After one dining experience at BJ's, I will not be back (to this location at least).   I ate here with my family while celebrating somebody's birthday.  The atmosphere at this location is everything I try to avoid while eating out.  Maybe it's the location, a restaurant like this in Culver City attracts the unwashed masses who think that BJ's is a fancy place to eat.   The couple at the table next to us was drunk, and shoved a cell phone in my face, making me take videos of them chugging beer.  I'm not about to refuse a request by a drunk gangster, my life is worth too much.  People here also seem to think it's ok to let young children run around the restaurant making all the noise they want.  Maybe if they were more responsible in general, they wouldn't have those kids to begin with. On to the actual service and food: The servers here are somewhat helpful, but a bit slow to get around to all of the tables and keep water refilled.  The food, however, takes forever to arrive.  After ordering my pizza, I had to wait around 40 minutes until it arrived, even though the server said the wait was 15 minutes.  The pizza itself was the only redeeming thing about my experience.  The deep dish crust was flaky and soft, and the toppings were liberally applied. The beer, on the other hand, was disgusting.   My wife and I shared the 8-beer sampler, with about 6 ounces of eight different BJ's custom beers. The ""Lightswitch Lager"" tasted like rodent urine.  I work in a genetics lab where we use mice in experiments, and I know what rodent urine smells like.  That is the exact taste of this beer.  The porter and the stout were flavorless, and the rest were utterly forgettable.  The only beer I would maybe try again is the Jeremiah Red.   Avoid this location of BJ's in Culver City at all costs!  (Unless you want to share your meal with a few hundred rowdy people with no respect for you or anybody else).   I might try BJ's again in a more civilized neighborhood, but very carefully."
Nikki T.,"Las Vegas, NV",109,340,116,1.0,10/10/2012,"I was trying the seating area for the first time... The waiter acted like he didn't want to be bothered.. and nobody damn smiled. I even asked one of the waitresses was it that bad there??? Either way.. I asked the waiter their opinion on some of the dishes and he acted like he ain't tasted nothing there. What the hell? No smiles- not friendly... OKAAAAY. I just said worst case scenario is I don't like it and you take i back since you have no recommendations. Sorry i don't eat BJ's like that *smh* THEN it wasn't even busy mind you, but his ass was tending to a table with 3 folks eating off one damn party wing plate more than he was me and my child who ordered 2 actual meals. So then after he visited their table at least 2/3 more times and walked off like there was no way in hell we needed something. I'm getting pissed because ONE my child wanted ketchup and I had to ask a host to get it and two, this is the second time I have had to ask someone who WAS doing their job on the tables they have been assigned to bring me some napkins and where the hell are you at??? THEN I asked a passing host where he was, clearly annoyed- looking at my empty azzed cup and she was like OMG (typical of him apparently). I will find him. I said yes please do and find your manager while you're at it- thanks.  I sat with an empty cup for 6 minutes (parched like a mugg)   and yep I turned on a timer- before this fool brought a refill with the bill.. WTF???) OK... Yeah- get your manager. I let her know that their service sucked ass and if he don't like the job he has, in this economy- there is someone who will do it with a smile. This is why people don't like chains.. because folks is comfortable and it makes YOU as a manager look bad.. you need a new staff. I have seen about 2 people smiling here since I got here.. You might want to work on that. Yep.. me and the kid ate for 17 bucks. #goodnight and Sorry, I don't do crappy service, even at a discounted rate... I won't be back."
David G. B.,"Los Angeles, CA",104,4,1,4.0,3/10/2011,"Large food menu, good service and lots of big screen TV's to watch your favorite LA teams."
Janelle N.,"Santa Monica, CA",64,127,37,4.0,10/3/2010,"I've been a long time shopper at the Fox Hills Mall now called Westfield Shopping Center, and was thrilled to see actual resturaunts go up. Yes, the mall and perhaps the area itself is a bit ghetto as other people have stated but it's always been that way (at least for the past 20 years That I've been going). Anyways I pick up my friend from her long flight back to the states and we decide to get a bite to eat. Since I picked her up at LAX and her car was parked in Culver City, she suggests BJ's which Is nestled on the Target/Forever 21 side of the mall. Parking is a gigantic pain as the spots are always all occupied unless you go into the structure which will promise some walking. After a good solid meal, the last thing I want to do is walk! So it's Friday night about 8:30 pm and it's packed inside. The place is reminiscent of a TGIFridays. The wait is about 20 min so we head over to the bar area to have a drink. There are tons of beer selections as well as a full bar (joy!). The bartender made pretty solid drinks for a place like that. We finally get our table and the waitress was super friendly, sweet and attentive. Unfortunately I didn't catch her name but she was a pretty Asian chick. Also, the rest of the staff was friendly as well, greeting us as we walked by. We thumb through the menu which is equivalent to the Cheesecake Factorys menu...we're talking every kind of pasta, chilli, deep dish pizzas, sandwiches, comfort foods, lots of yummy dessert options like warmed cookies with ice cream, and the menu goes on and on. It's tough to choose as there are so many tasty options to choose from! We finally decide to split a deep dish south west pizza and avocado eggrolls for our appetizer. The eggrolls were hot, crunchy and flavorful...they just about melted in my mouth. Yum! The pizza was good too although I might be more inclined to get a classic pizza myself but it was still good. The deep dish are doughy just FYI for all you New York thin crust lovers. According to how many people were in there and how many people I see here while I'm shopping, I'd say this place is pretty popular. Im giving it 4 stars (for now) until I go back and have another taste of it. I  will be back, I liked everything about this place and recommend it to  people looking for a better version of TGIfridays, Cheesecake Factory,  Chillis, Red Robin, Claim Jumper, etc. Not gourmet but it's good ol'  comfort food in a nice atmosphere."
K H.,"San Diego, CA",0,61,1,4.0,9/21/2012,Great food... great service and definitely price worthy for the meals you order and receive.. The pizookie is a must at this restaurant... A must visit when in LA...
leah m.,"Los Angeles, CA",56,22,57,5.0,3/28/2014,the hostess was amazing even know they were super busy! the chicken tortilla soup is to die for so is the pear cider beer blend. there is also a 19.95 special for a 3 course meal for 2. it won't be on the menu but you should ask for it between now and September 30th 2012! parking sucks! And a valet is 7 dollars which is pretty pricey. I'm told you can text when you are ready to pick up your car from inside the restaurant so it will be ready as soon as you walk outside. Otherwise awesome!
Enzo A.,"Pasadena, CA",84,57,24,5.0,3/15/2010,"Good service, good food, great desserts - Oreo Pizookie was amazing!"
Erik T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,1.0,12/2/2011,"This was one of the worst experiences I have ever had at a restaurant. I have been to this BJs before (as well as others) and have never been treated so poorly. When I went to this specific one before, the waiter took a long time (which as a fellow server I can understand since it was busy) and the food was not too good. I go back another day at around 11:50pm. I was promptly seated by the hostess, and then waited 10-15 minutes for the server to get to us. Upon arriving the first thing to come out of his mouth was ""We close in an hour so you might want to get your order in now"". Seriously? It does not take an hour to microwave your food over there, and the rush was unappreciated. We tell him we were not ready to order and so he moves on (to serve the people in the bar as they were the only other people in the restaurant left). After 5 minutes of deciding we were ready to order, and yet again the server takes 15 minutes to get to us, kind of odd for a guy who wanted me and my girlfriend out so quickly. The rest of the night we were constantly rushed to get out and it was extremely uncomfortable. I mean we were eating for 10 minutes before he asked to box up our food. We weren't even done yet! Plus to top it off, the food again was not great. At the end we get the check and I leave a small (but undeserving) tip. As I said, I too am a server so I understand service, and this was not good service. Just to recap: -Don't go in AN HOUR before they close otherwise they rush you out. -Their food is not very tasty. -Be ready to wait a long time for any kind of service (except for the hostesses, I have never had a bad experience with them). It is really not that difficult to do your job servers, so please do it right. Get it together BJs."
Amie A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,2.0,2/6/2010,It's to pricey for the food you get and they give you way too much food. The service was great when they first opened and now the service is slow and gets worse every time I go back. From now on I'm avoiding this place
Kareen G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,3/2/2013,"Your prices are too high. The food needs more seasoning. Your drinks are watered down, and I was disappointed eating at your restaurant yesterday. I would really want to be contacted for a refund."
Philip J.,"Pacific Palisades, CA",94,192,3,5.0,3/4/2010,They gave us pizza while we waited! What a good start! Get the ice cream and cookie dessert too! Plenty of employees which was nice got seated quickly for it being so busy.
Justin T.,"Glendale, CA",14,25,,1.0,12/19/2009,"Worst service I've ever had at a restaurant.  Our waitress was super late to greet us, went on break without telling us, didn't put my order in, so 40 minutes later the manager comes out to say he's sorry and that he'll come out to check on us and make sure everything is good.  The food takes a further 15 minutes to come out, and when it comes out, all of my sides are wrong, and they're cold.  The manager never comes to check on us, so I told the waitress to have him come over.  Five minutes later, no manager, so I look at the door to the kitchen and when I catch his eye, he looks away like he didn't see me.  He spends the rest of the time I'm there ducking me.  The WORST.  Flee from this place like it's on fire.  I'd rather be punched in the face than have to go through that again."
