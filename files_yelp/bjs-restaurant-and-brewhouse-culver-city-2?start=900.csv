Moon C.,"Prunedale, CA",2,135,19,1.0,11/8/2009,"If I could rate the place a zero, I would. I have no clue what the food is like, because I never got mine.  Seated promptly.  Waited on fairly promptly.  Received alcohol fairly promptly.  At that point, server disappeared, and the clock just kept ticking.  After a good 20 minutes plus I still had no food.  Waitress finally cruised by, saying my food would be up ""soon"".  I pointed out that a couple two tables away had received their food 5 minutes before she came by, at which point I was informed that they had ordered chicken (and I hadn't), so (of course?) they got their food right away?  WTF???  I had ordered an appetizer type dish, I might add, that can be served up in 2 minutes.  Server then got uber-sickly sweet solicitous, very sarcastically over-polite, as if I was the one with the issue/problem.  She offered to call the manager over, and then reacted as if she was very pissed off that I said yes, I wanted to see him.  She oozed off.  I saw her one more time, calling out to me that she was ""trying to find the manager.""  Three minutes went by - no food, no waitress, no manager.  I got up and walked out.  Nothing anyone can say, no comp, nothing will induce me to return.  The server was personally insulting to me as an individual.  Apparently, this type of ""service"" is the rule rather than the exception at this BJs.  I hope it goes out of business very soon."
Chris N.,"Redondo Beach, CA",82,56,2,5.0,1/25/2010,I love this place. Their beer selection alone could get me in but the service tonight was exceptional. We went on Halloween and surprisingly we were seated in about 5 mins with a crowd waiting and the place packed. The server paid detailed attention to us and our order. Food was amazing and the pumpkin beer was awesome.
Bruce M.,"Culver City, CA",5,139,22,1.0,10/22/2009,"Read my main Review below !  then ... FYI - Got a call and email from corporate offering their apology for the bad ""experience"" and assurance they would try and make things better.  Dont hold your breath!  But, (and I say this with a big doubts...)  Maybe if enough people complain to them via email from their website, they might, I say might be able to make some improvements.  I'm willing to hope that for the pizza gods and all the hard working folks spending their hard to come by dollars on eating out that they indeed do just that."
James B.,"Los Angeles, CA",21,5,,3.0,7/1/2010,"This BJ's is decent. I've been to 3 of them in total (this one, one in Westwood, and another in West Covina--West Covina is definitely the best out of the 3, but both are much better than the Westwood location). Most of the appetizers and salads are very good. Of course, the pizzookies are excellent. The reason this place only gets 3 stars is because the wait is usually relatively lengthy and the service is pretty bad usually. Occasionally you'll be able to get a good server, but most of the time you'll be waiting for a bit for your food."
Heather S.,"Inglewood, CA",16,57,14,4.0,3/5/2010,Gotta redeem this place because of other bad reviews. I think if your going to this place in the evening or a weekend it's gonna be crowded and expect douchey people to try to get ahead of you and service to not be great. Not bad but not great. Went for lunch on a weekday and I thought the food was good and the service was quick and it was a packed house when we went. The reason it only gets 4 stars is the mid switch with waiters.
Niccolo R.,"Los Angeles, CA",78,57,8,4.0,2/6/2010,"The atmosphere is well lit, energetic, and upbeat.  Food is typical of a brewpub, but they make excellent burgers, salads, salads and offer a good beer selection.  For about $9.50 you can order a dish that will fill you up, and is very tasty.  Plus, the desserts are dope, and the atmosphere is cool because of the hustle/bustle, and nice balance between well lit, yet faded lighting.  I've been twice now and will definitely go back."
April M.,"Los Angeles, CA",50,9,,2.0,11/3/2009,"I have been to the new BJ's in Culver City several times and it seems they are still getting the hang of things. The food was fine.  The service....I have mixed feelings. It seems like the kitchen and wait staff are not in sync. My friend ordered soup and salad and I ordered a salad w/dressing on the side. The soup and salad came up right away so my friend waited until my salad arrived ten minutes later before eating. The wait staff did offer to get a new soup but at that point we just didn't feel like dealing with it. When we were half way through our meal another server took over because the first server was off. The new server introduced herself, fine. Then she came back six times to check in ""because she was bored"", didn't seem to care that it was disruptive.  Then the server wanted to clear the table of dishes and what she couldn't reach asked me to hand to her....seems like odd service. The dressing was in a messy dish and I really didn't want to hand it to her but she asked so I felt obligated.  Young staff. They don't seem to have much experience and then to be out of sync with the kitchen makes for a very bumpy dining experience. Parking is difficult. Plan on parking in the garage."
Andy D.,"South Easton, MA",5,30,,4.0,7/12/2010,"The pizza here is outstanding and the beer selection is superb. The BJ's brews are good, but don't overlook the non-BJ's beers they also have. I could really go for a pizzookie right now... As with most BJ's locations, this one tends to be on the busy side. While you're waiting for a table, just go to the bar and get a nice drink. There are a ton of tv's to keep you entertained while you wait too. I've been to this location more than 5 times and don't think the service is all that bad. It's fair to average when comparing to other large restaurants."
P B.,"Brooklyn, NY",22,45,4,1.0,3/5/2010,"My husband is a self-admitted pizza monster, so while we were in the area we decided to hit up the new BJ's. Such a mistake.  I ordinarily try to avoid chain restaurants, but on this night we just wanted some pizza and beer and thought they might be able to deliver.  Wrong. After a 45 minute wait which we didn't really mind, we were greeted by our server who spoke to us like we were in Kindergarten. I made a trip to the ladies room where I almost slipped and fell on my face when I walked through the door in a puddle of an unknown foreign substance (it wasn't water!). I browsed my stall options to find piss and human fecal matter on every toilet surface. I decided to hold it. The next hour and a half of my life would be the most difficult efforts to stuff my face that I've ever been through. When our food arrived along with our first and only round of beer and water, we were promptly alerted to the fact that there was no silverware or plates to be had. From there, we shared a pizza and tried to get out as quickly as possible. We spent the next hour or so waiting for our check. I'd like to think I'm a fantastic tipper. Having worked in the restaurant industry when I was a struggling barely old enough to drink Angelino, I'd like to think I learned to take pity on servers. Not tonight my dear yelpers, not tonight. I left a whopping $4.05 and vowed to never return to the Fox Hills Mall or BJ's ever again. It's no wonder the wait was so long. Our server came by once to take our order and once to give us our check. We did have a random server bring us our beers. Other than that, we were basically left to our own devices.  The only amusing part of the night was getting to see the patrons dressed up in SUITS like this was some sort of place to be. Are you kidding me? This is BJ's folks, not exactly ""fine dining"". FYI - a small cheese pizza has far fewer calories than most of their salads. Portions are out of control large and equally overpriced, even at this $ level. It's no wonder why America is so FAT!"
Kevin C.,"Henderson, NV",0,26,,3.0,11/13/2010,Good food and nice beers but service sucks! SLOW! Good for sports too as tvs are everywhere!
Dia P.,"Windsor Hills, CA",33,40,27,4.0,11/5/2009,"I really like BJs, they are all great. I mean i always look for the quality, you definitely gotta consider if they are clean or not. ( Get Those Dirty Thoughts outta your head!) lol. I like Their Food, especially their Pizza.. Yummmmm, the best that i have had. It's other great example of a Classic Sports Bar/ Restaurant. i like the layout it's really cool. I just really wish that the lobby was Bigger, because it gets so crowded at times. I believe that this is the exact thing that Culver City Needs."
janet v.,"Culver City, CA",0,20,,2.0,4/26/2011,Why am I not surpised that others seem to have the same bad service.  I stood at the take out window waiting to place my order for 10 minutes.  A waitress was there but she was busy counting her tips and didn't even get eye contact with me until I finally asked is anyone working here?  She explained that the girl was in the back and should be up front shortly.  so I wait and watch this woman count her money.  Finally she decides to go look for the young lady.   I'm still waiting.  So now I ask the hostest if anyone is working here and explains that she's in the back and she will go get her.  (is this woman cooking the meals?)  Now I'm mad and ask for a manager.  When the manger finally comes she makes excuses for why the lady was not at the take out window.  And was more interested in the young lady counting her tips. If you work as a waitress or waiter keep in mind that tips are not manditory! T - To I - Insure P - Prompt S - Service
Theodore P.,"Los Angeles, CA",29,19,,3.0,7/27/2012,"There's nothing more disappointing than to score a table at a highly touted restaurant only to discover that it does not meet the hype. Such flaws can mar an experience such as a boring wine list, errors in presentation, exorbitant prices. Some places exceed your expectations for a lesser price and give solace to an otherwise perilous experience. One such place is BJ's. I'm going figuratively commando as always here in terms of naming assigning it the gastropub. In fact, I will say enshrine it as ""family friendly"" which is not always pejorative term. Perfect lighting, a decent menu. A cheerful and helpful waiter with a generous sense of humor. In LA waiters aren't always as self aware of their other profession. I despise when they pretend it's a novelty to be a an actor rather than just having a great time. We had the best two waiters that demanding NY'ers could imagine. Tried different drinks and oh the food wasn't bad either. I'm not saying what I ordered because I already appear as a fat ass from previous reviews. This is a good mid-week casual restaurant."
Whitney H.,"Los Angeles, CA",237,176,34,3.0,11/29/2009,"The lunch specials during the week are really the reason to go to BJ's.  On the weekend it gets crowded and the service is slow.  The food is pizza, burger, salad American.  Average, do-able, chain food."
Doug C.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,4,,2.0,3/16/2014,"I can see why Yelp only gave this location 2.5 stars... We've been here before, last time was bad, so management took care of us, and gave us a free meal certificate... So, we decided to use them today. And here we go again... The hostess was extremely rude and full of ghettotude! She saw us walk through the door, didn't even acknowledge us, a waitress told her that we were standing there and she said, ""yeah, I know..., she (the other NEW hostess), got it..."" So after a few minutes we were sat..., one minute later the hostess comes back and says..sorry, I have to move you to a different table because there is no server for this table ."" WTF??? REALLY???...anyway the very nice server Victoria took our orders, everything seemed good...until we got our food...let's just say that the ""Oven-Roasted"" Mahi Mahi with stir-fried veggies and pineapple fried rice was more like ""Oven-Roasted"" piece of shit jerky with stir-fried grass and oil flavored steamed white rice! Just plain NASTY!! Our pizza, well let's just say I've had better ""FROZEN"" microwave pizza...this is TRULY PATHETIC because I really like this place. Well the management took care of us, but unfortunately, we ARE NOT coming back to this location...on their WORST DAY, the Westwood location is way better...better service, especially the HOSTESS...ALL of those that gave this place 3+ stars....WTF we're thinking??? Are you friends of some of the employees?? SOB!!"
Jay R.,"Culver City, CA",0,21,,2.0,8/26/2011,"I can't seem to understand this place at all.  I like the chain and have had great times at other locations.  The bummer is that I live around the corner from here.  I go here on my own and with my family.  When I go with my family the service is awful.  The food is always good, but the service and the attitude is completely perplexing.  The greeters seem disinterested when you walk in.  We always go early to avoid the craziness.  We have had mostly bad service experiences.  Sometimes I want to go and serve myself.  Just show me where things are and I will take care of it.  Westfield has sunk a lot of money into this mall, but maybe this wasn't the right restaurant call."
MS F.,"Venice, CA",59,58,,1.0,4/2/2013,"Went for a quick bite today around 3 with my friend. The hostess with dark hair in a bun was no where to be found. When she finally sauntered up to the hostess stand she acted like were imposing on her to even be there.  We asked for a table for two. She looked at me like I had three heads and tried to steer me and my friend to the bar for happy hour. When we said no that we just wanted a table to have lunch she seemed clueless. She left us hanging and proceeded to talk to another couple who had also been waiting for at least 2 to 3 minutes. We were still table less, yet there were several tables and several wait staff walking around and not busy. She then headed toward the kitchen across the restaurant and out of sight again. Where the hell was she going??? On the way out of the kitchen she hugged a waitress who just came in for her shift. WTF???? We are still standing here waiting for a table while she socializes. I have never seen such lack of urgency or concern for a job in my life. She came back and said that it was going to be another few minutes as they had to clean a table. Are you kidding me at this point???? It was time to walk out and we did...Management needs to get rid of this so called hostess! Worst customer service ever!"
Danae H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/19/2012,"i ordered a chicken salad and it came out without even chicken on it. not a big deal but the guy brought me out a chicken breast on a plate as an apology so i had to break it apart into pieces with my hand to put it in my salad. we paid mid meal considering we had hour parking. i  left before my boyfriend so i could go check on the car and my boyfriend said as he got up a blonde worker ran to our table right in front of him and looked at our check to make sure we paid. how rude. i will not be back to this bjs. the one in arlington, tx (brand new) that im used to going to is much better.  this one is crowded and bad service."
Hector A.,"Marina del Rey, CA",9,23,,3.0,2/26/2012,"The beer is the real reason to come here along with a pazooki. The problem with this place has to be with parking, there is nothing nearby. I felt the food was ok, but I remember having better food at other BJ restaurants. I think the staff was great, but the food was just ehh, I would prefer CPK now."
Felicia T.,"Las Vegas, NV",80,276,192,4.0,10/20/2009,"I am used to the BJ's in Westwood. and waiting around forever (30-40 minutes easy) has gotten kinda old. Also my last couple trips there have almost killed BJ's for me. The sliders came out cold, Fries also cold. And Fish and chips were greasy (I understand its fried. I expect fresh out the fryer grease, but NOT sit on the-counter-too-long-the-oil-has-set kind of) grease. Also i always felt rushed eating at this location, to make way for UCLA kids eating in groups of 10 or so. right.  Then i drove by a couple months ago, and it looks like a new location is opening in the new Westfield Mall (used to be Fox Hills mall). Along with a new Target (which is Super Target by the way). Yippeeeeee.. since it is close to work! I love finding new lunch spots :) I stayed off the first 3 weeks after opening, which was smart i think, since i am reading tons of negative reviews on bad service, slow and disorganized staff. Also a friend of mine went, and said the wait was forever. It just opened. So i let them work out their kinks. Went today, deciding i am ready. And so are they. parking is free in the mall structure (hooray). We got there around 12:30. No wait, got seated immediately. Server was very nice and attentive and never pressured us to order. Their lunch specials are great! You can get a half salad/ soup/ sandwich (pick and pair 2) for $6.95, and fries included with the sandwich! Or unlimited Caesar salad with soup (free refills) for $6.95. I ended up getting the Pulled Pork Sliders (comes with regular or Wedge Fries.. Get the Wedges!) $6.95. For that price, you get 4 sliders! Definitely a very generous portion for lunch. And the sauce on it was so tangy delicious, i wanted to lick them off my plate.  Value wise, they've won me over. Table service was very good, kitchen was a little slower. But we didnt mind. The place is clean and there are TV's to keep you occupied.  I didn't get any of their brews this time, since I have to go back to work. And people seem to notice when i come back from lunch wide-eyed, looking too happy and with rosy cheeks. sad.  I've had beer at the other location and i love their Blonde and Piranha."
