Jimmy R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,2.0,6/2/2012,"This restaurant just keeps on letting me down. I'm not exaggerating but this is my 3rd bad experience at this location. I can't seem to avoid this place because my fiance loves their pizza I have to say food is great service very disappointing. For example to day I decided to order curb side pick up too avoid going in to the restaurant. Yet again the service was bad even on the phone. A girl answer the phone and all she said was ""hello"" I had to ask whether I had the correct number or if I was calling BJ's. Second she cut me off in mid sentence by saying ""hold on"" so I'm on hold. When she finally came back on the line she asked for my name and "" what do I want to order"" after I finished placing my order she simply said "" be ready in 20 minutes"" and click."
Chris M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,8,,2.0,2/6/2012,"When ever I come to bj's I usually order the balsamic chicken because it is consistantly good. However, I ventured off the path of delicious chicken after getting made fun of for my predictable order and decided to go with the shrimp tacos... Terrible idea, I have loved the shrimp tacos at almost every place I have ever tried them but not here.. For 10 bucks you get 2 dinky little tacos with shrimp that tasted a little to ripe for my liking if you know what I mean.. Also their house salad is like 4 bucks and its nothing but a small plate of like costco iceberg mix or something... After many disapointing salads and now the shrimp tacos I will be taking my business else where."
ashley c.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,9,,2.0,10/25/2010,"I actually really like BJs for what it is -- good solid bar food.  This particular BJs however, has the most incompetent staff I have experienced.  In the three times I have been there my order has been messed up, things like drinks and sides that should be relatively simple to deliver in a timely fashion have taken FOREVER and it has been a generally frustrating experience.  Please BJs, do something about your waitstaff!"
Kim C.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,26,5,1.0,11/16/2011,"Nothing quite like waiting 30 minutes at your table for a server to take your drink order let alone your food order on a random Tuesday at 2:00 pm when at least half of their seats  are free.  The waitress made eye contact with my multiple times, yet still did not come over to take my order.  Finally, when I flagged down a busboy, he got another waitress to help me who wasn't even working my section.  When my actual waitress brought my food over, she didn't say anything, ask for a refill on my water, and then it took her another 30 minutes to give me my check.  I will never go back to this BJ's.  WORST SERVICE IN HISTORY!!!!"
R D.,"Calabasas, CA",0,7,,1.0,3/14/2012,"Overpriced Chain Restaurant--more so for dinner,but I don't see what the hype is.  Their menu looks like something from the Cheesecake Factory, has a million things on it.  I ordered the Santa Fe Chicken based off of the picture they had.  Well my salad looked nothing like the one pictured.  They forgot about 3/4's of the salad, you would think for $13 you would get a decent salad.  Ridiculous.  Overpriced and overseasoned, and the waiter didn't listen (dressing on the side, etc).  Won't be going back.  Also too noisy!"
mia s.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,3,,3.0,10/27/2009,Went to BJ'S twice since it's opening and the service  is so-so. We ordered the sampler appetizer which was 15 bucks! wHEW. Can we say recession. The selection of beers are extensive and the cocktail list is very basic aqs this restaurant specializes in BEER! Pretty good experience so fqar. Love the big screens so thaat you can watch the game
Danny S.,"Los Angeles, CA",238,40,1,4.0,12/27/2010,"i love the nachos, and the ice cream, the service is good, and the bathroom is clean .. floors are kind of slippery"
Mike W.,"Inglewood, CA",0,7,,3.0,11/9/2009,"Been here twice. Truth be told this isn't the place to go for great food...it's a place to go to grab a beer, see a game, maybe make a new friend, and people watch. It's the new ""Fridays"" since Friday's in the Ladera Center is very played out.  The food here is drowned in butter and salt...seriously...and I eat damn near anything...no diets here...but sheesh, can BJ's possibly make their meals more buttery/salty?? I din't think it's humanly possible. My food was basically a salt lick!! Also, since this place is still fairly new be prepared to deal with long wait times and less than top notch service, but I hear they're ""working on it""..lol... Overall I'd say this place is okay...if you're looking for somewhere to drink beer and be social that is : )"
P F.,"San Francisco, CA",1,43,2,5.0,7/5/2011,"This location is one of my favorite places for happy hour. Yes, it can get crowded, but it never takes too long to find a seat in the bar unless a good game is on. The bartenders/servers are very nice. I once noticed the portions were getting smaller so I kindly suggested they reconsider and management seemed to appreciate the comment and take action. I highly recommend this location for anyone looking for a lively environment. It's also great for late night dining which seems somewhat rare in Culver City."
Ibeth C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,2.0,8/31/2012,Food is great but the service is ridiculous all around.  From the wait to being seated to the food.  Hostess is rude and never checks to see if any empty tables available.  The one we were seated at was free for 15 min until I started complaining and surfing the area for a table.  The waiter pretty incompetent did not place our appetizers nor did he realized he did not until other waiters came to our table with our entrees.  Not only were the appetizers never placed but my jambalaya wasn't ordered either.  My food arrived right when everybody else had finished their meal.  We asked for extra silverware and soy sauce and it took us 4 times to request it to different people because our waiter failed to do his job.  He totally ignored our requests and what's worse never apologized for any of it until the end.  And of course he wanted a tip so he had to apologize.  This place totally moves around the bar and the rest is forgotten.  if you can't run a business don't open it.  It wastes good quality time and good food that people trust to come and find without hesitation.  Customer is first above all especially if you want them coming back.  Never going back to this location so far Burbank it will be.
Danny T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,23,,4.0,7/21/2010,"Great BBQ Chicken Pizza, good mac & cheese! Their home brewed Hefeweizen is very good too, great selection of beer on tap! Parking is tough sometimes since the place is in a mall, but they do offer valet parking. I would definitely recommend going there!"
Jason H.,"Los Angeles, CA",41,33,1,2.0,10/11/2009,"This place had good food but horrible service. The waiters/waitresses didnt know who they were serving, my waiter told me that the restaurant didnt have crushed pepper, then i asked another server and they told me that they did. When I first arrived the host wasnt organized to sit us down in order of arrival and there was a bunch of commotion at the front because of it.  I ordered an alcoholic beverage when we were first seated I didnt recieve it til after I got my food. ANd dont go to BJs if you have an out of state ID because when I showed my out of state ID the waiter had to take it to the owner who had to walk away and do something with it and then they brought it back to me. I have never been through such a security clearance check to get a drink in my life and I am balding so I know I look over 21. I would not suggest bringing a date there unless you want to prove to her how you will yell at anyone to get some service for her. Maybe go to the bar and eat cuz it sounded like they have good happy hour specials and hopefully better service"
prinay a.,"Hayward, CA",2,6,,1.0,3/21/2010,"I was on a weekend trip to LA, stayed near the culver city westfield mall. i have alwasy been a big fan of BJ's. i have to say this was by far the WORST ones ever. When we reached there, i asked for the wait time for a table since it was crowded. i was told 10-15mins. we waited for 45 mins before we got our table, we ordered the drinks and took like another 45mins minutes to just get our drinks, it was just one water n 2cokes. We ordered our food and it took another 40mins for the food. They have very little to no service. i got my food first , then a second waiter got my sisters food, my wife waited another 20mins till she got her food. I have never got this kind of service at any place. it was HORRIBLE. i highly recommend NOT GOING to this Restaurant in Culver city. Also im the guy who left u a penny in tip......but u guys did everything to deserve it too. Thanks"
Natasha j.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,,2.0,10/27/2009,"Not as i thought. I was excited to try a new place that opened near my house. A total let down, just like the Planet hollywood Casino in Vegas over the weekend but thats another story. The floors were worse than the Grand lux, Any woman that wears heels thats been there knows what i mean, they were way to slippery my friends had to hold me just so i could walk to our table, And walk out. I understand that they were fairly new and the place would be packed but they took forever with the food and drinks. the drinks were strong so if your trying to get tipsy, bj's is perfect for you. Also, I ordered calamari, huge mistake, it was terribly dry, un seasoned, it totally tasted like rubber, and it made me sick. My friends ordered a appetizer sampler which was good, not great, the same thing you'd get from anywhere else, so we all shared that since we were scared to order anything else. I also ordered a dirty martini, another huge mistake. plus it was late and i saw teens there, why didnt this place have a curfew, lol. I'm thinking about going back,(if i have anyone to go with since every1 hated it) hoping that this was just a first-timers fluke."
Che Mari M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,5,,2.0,9/5/2010,Hmm....where to begin... service not so good...confused on who my waiter was. They changed ever 5 seconds. The pizza was good but could have been a deeper dished. The pizookie at the end was a nice treat. Question is...will I be back?
Jennifer H.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,56,,4.0,7/6/2012,"I am picky and I was really worried about this place after reading all the other reviews, but I have to say that our experience was definitely not like most reported.  We had some relatives in town and everyone was coming from different directions.   With the Wilshire ramp off the #405 closed I thought that this would be an easy place to meet and the food should satisfy the kids as well as the adults.  I am a healthy eater and wasn't too excited about what I say on the internet but I can occasionally put up with a night of unhealthy eating.  The only thing we didn't like was that they didn't take reservations.  You could call an hour or so in advance.  I don't remember the exact procedure but they explained it over the phone and we had a table waiting after following the instructions.  Our waitress was friendly and helpful.  Not everyone arrived at once but she brought drinks for those who ordered first and then came back when another group arrived.  I was pleasantly surprised to find some healthy options on the menu and even happier when the food arrived.  I had an Seared Ahi Tuna Salad which was delicious.  The kids seemed happy with their pizza and mozzarella sticks.  Other entrees sampled included pasta and fish dishes.  Everyone was pleased with their choice.  Drinks were refilled in timely manner.  We weren't rushed and our waitress was attentive to just the right degree.  The restaurant wasn't too noisy and the restrooms were clean.  Parking did take a little time, my suggestion is don't try to park outside, go directly to the indoor mall parking.  Yes, you'll have to walk a little but then you might not feel as bad about ordering a dessert.  BJ's isn't on my regular foodie list, but I would definitely come back in a similar circumstance."
freshkidd T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,,1.0,7/28/2010,This BJ's has really bad service. It's so bad to the point we didn't even sit down. The hostess just walked around like there wasn't three different parties that need to be seated. I got so pissed that I didn't even want to eat there anymore. A lady was even walking around looking for her waitress to take her order. WOW!!!
Jason L.,"Chino Hills, CA",56,8,,1.0,3/12/2012,"dont go here at all.. go somewhere else and eat... they have one the worst staff and management.. i came here for my girlfriend's birthday and our food came 40 minutes late where everyone else got their food, so in totally we waited like an hour and 40 minutes for fcking good.. our waitress was horrible too.. AVOID THIS PLACE"
Gina N.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,18,,1.0,3/23/2012,"I've been to this BJs location quite a few times, mainly because its nearby and convenient for me and a few friends in the area. I like their beer and flatbread margharita pizza. Unfortunately, THEIR SERVICE SUCKS!!! Some of the worst service I've ever had. Long waits for everything, including something as simple as a napkin and water. The waitstaff has an attitude, not everyone but its more likely you'll get a shitty server than a nice one. Not to mention some of the crowd here can be just as rude as the waitstaff. I had a guy in the bar area tell me I had just sat at the booth he was waiting on. Well the bar area is open seating, no names on a list type of thing. The ladies sitting at the table before me offered the table as they were getting up. How did I take his seat? It's like a parking space scenario, get over it. He proceeded to be rude as me and my son sat at the table. Real classy folks at this establishment."
Marcus R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,2,2.0,11/18/2009,"I made a reservation for my wife's birthday at 8 pm, guess what?? One hour later I got my table. the staff ishorrible, really horrible,  they bring you beer first and the glasses after 30 minutes, actually and the end we were having fun to see how bad they are.... The beer is ok, price is really good, I had a party for 10 people , I order few appetizers and enough beer and I spent $ 200 , it wasn't bad, dont worry about tip because they are so bad you won't pay a lot, and about the next day is totally true, a lot of gas going on, stomach pain but you know you get what u Paid. ...Good Luck"
