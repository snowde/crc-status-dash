Brennan M.,"Spring, TX",1,85,29,5.0,12/13/2017,"Although BJ's is known for their pizza and pizookies, the hamburger is the all-star MVP here. This may be me being biased because I'm a burger guy, but these are usually cooked to perfection (and order) and topped with a fluffy white cloud of a bun to complete the ensemble. The sidekick? Sweet potato fries. What else? Well, to be fair, they recently added those when they booted wedge fries off the menu. Their house-brewed craft beer is on point, but no one will blame you if you order an ice cold glass and a bottle of Michelob Ultra because that beer is a burger's best friend. And if alcohol isn't on your list, they have Diet Pepsi which the only diet soda you should drink because it's Aspartame free.  All the food is good though. The staff is almost always nice. The place is always clean. Just go eat here."
Chef C.,"Irving, TX",0,26,8,2.0,1/3/2018,"We only visit BJ's once a year, for a yearly holiday get together. But each time the restaurant is beautiful, the food is great, and the staff is always friendly.  This year the staff was super accommodating with us and our guests. They let us set up early, and decorate our seating area before our guests arrived, and they gave us a nice area away from everyone in the main dining hall, which always makes us feel special.  However, despite the food being great, and everything else being five star, on this last visit I had to use the restroom and my goodness was I shocked! The restroom was not clean! In fact it looked forgotten. You can always judge a restaurant 's dedication to cleanliness based on the restroom and after stepping inside the restroom I'm not sure I want to come back, truthfully. Two of the toilets were broken! I'm talking about that flush handle being completely lopsided and questionable looking. Like, ""Ooh, is that a splash zone risk?"" Yeah. It was crooked and janky. Flat out busted looking. This meant there was only one loo for all the women (I'm sure staff included) to utilize! How in the world is a business to function with only one available loo for the female guests and employees to use!? And, folks this is a HUGE restaurant. This isn't some mom and pop small restaurant. This is a chain!!! I would have told the staff, but there wasn't anyone around the restroom. So what do I do? I flat out refused to ""use it"" and sat back down with my family and friends. But, I must be honest, after coming back to the dinner table I simply forgot to tell our waitress about it. We were eating anyway, I didn't want to disgust anyone.  Well BJ's you may have delicious food, but your bathroom's are atrocious. I'll be rethinking our holiday party plans as well.  There's no excuse for an unsightly bathroom in a restaurant."
Kelly T.,"Addison, Dallas, TX",228,122,163,3.0,10/11/2017,"3.5 Stars I haven't actually dined inside this location yet. I've just ordered off of DoorDash. I usually just order pizookies because they are BOMB! The monkey bread one... Wow... You just have to try it.  However I tried the gumbo the other day because my friend suggested it to me. It's a huge portion! I shared it with my boyfriend for leftovers the day after. They give a bunch of protein. It's a lot of spices. I wouldn't order again though.  I'll stick to just the pizookies! They're worth it. Sea salt caramel, cookies and cream, monkey bread are my go-tos."
Jenn B.,"Denton, TX",112,63,79,2.0,7/28/2017,"We arrived at 11:45am there was one couple ahead of us.  It took the people at the counter 3 minutes to even acknowledge us. Then we sat at the table for over 5 minutes and had to go ask for someone to bring drinks. They aren't super busy. This place is notoriously S-L-O-W.  We are giving them another try (4th visit) and they are living up to it. The food is GOOD!  All of it!  But I can't keep coming here and go back to work late every time!  We also brought a new person with us and he won't come back because of the service.  As usual the food was good!!!!  The server was nice but still slow.  The strawberry margarita on the rocks is TASTY!  One ordered the fish & chips and loved it. Two had bacon cheeseburgers with fries and I had the bacon, chicken, ranch piadina.  It. Was. Delicious!  And filling!   So, if you aren't starving or in a hurry I recommend this place. If you are in a hurry - I'd skip BJ's.  PS I know this is a ""brewhouse"" but I'm in work lunch!  The strawberry margarita was NOT for me!!!!"
Shalise G.,"Addison, Dallas, TX",101,93,68,5.0,7/27/2017,"I was craving a burger and was recommended to come here. Who knew on Wednesday's they had loaded burgers for $10 with unlimited fries! Soon as I walked in I saw this at the entrance of the door and immediately was excited. On top of that, it was also happy hour. We started off with the queso dip which was included in the happy hour and was $3. It had a slight kick of spicy and was delicious. Then I ordered the Portobello loaded burger. When it came out I was shocked at the size, it was huge. Split it in half, then took my first bite. It was amaze balls. I ordered a side of bbq because it seemed like the sandwich was missing something. This went perfectly with the sandwich, and I can't wait to return.  And customer service was good as well. Our waitress welcomed us as visitors, little does she know we live 5mins away and will probably be frequents."
Raeesa H.,"Dallas, TX",73,102,166,4.0,9/18/2017,"Went here on a Friday night right before closing (12:30 am) after Pete's Dwelling Piano Bar. The waiter was so nice to serve us even though we were a big group of people and their kitchen was set to close. The food was good as usual and we had some great service! The pizzookies always steal the show here - we got a trio of churros, chocolate chip, and salted caramel for the table. Amazing!"
Alex D.,"Dallas, TX",14,134,,3.0,11/3/2017,"Took a co worker here for lunch one day. The place was pretty dead and very quiet. The service was good and we started with the spinach/artichoke dip $10.25 which was pretty good, very cheesy. We split a small BJ's favorite deep dish pizza $16.50. The pizza was just okay, the toppings were good but the crust was not very crunchy or substantial. The sauce was also very plain and flavorless. For a Chicago style pizza I like a thicker sauce and theirs was very thin. They have a gigantic menu so I may go back and try something else but it doesn't bode well for their signature dish."
Autume A.,"Holladay, UT",609,95,41,5.0,11/8/2017,Hands down best thing on this menu is the Oreo Pizookie. I can't enough of this dessert. It's a chocolate cookie with a soft center and slightly warm so the vanilla ice cream melts on top. The Oreo Whip Cream is also fantastic. I've also had some of the pizzas and they are great too.
Manuel V.,"Wichita Falls, TX",1,27,97,4.0,12/3/2017,"The greeter was good, she informed us we could seat ourselves outside and a waiter would show up. It started off rough as we sit at a dirty table and it took 15 minutes until I  returned to the greeter to get a waiter and someone to bust the table. After returning to my table 5 minutes later it was taken care of. We chose outside as there was a fire and heated canopy's for outdoor seating. Shortly after the waiter AJ arrived, placed our order and this is where the night progressed and was worth the hassle of waiting. If BJ's reads this they should really give the MAN a RAISE or PROMOTION due to his attentiveness and ability to give every table he had the best Customer Service one would expect. If it wasn't for AJ this would had gone in such a different way and AJ THANK YOU for your Service for doing a Job that others would had given less than half the effort you gave. Our orders were the Tomato & Basil pizza as well as 2 of the Pepperoni Pizzas."
John R.,"Dallas, TX",0,5,,1.0,10/30/2017,Ive been going to this BJs for years 5+. Went last night to eat and watch the World series. Got my food with A shoulder length hair in it(Seriously)! My server was good.(she didn't bring the food out) She informed the manger this is where the ball was dropped! The Manger (Zach) I had to get his name from our server.... Did nothing but gave a Vague Apology (Amateur hour)? didnt comp the meal (Really??????) -Bjs is now dead to me...
Hunter M.,"Carrollton, TX",82,1,1,2.0,5/16/2017,"My family arrived at this location for Mother's Day expecting a long wait time but were genuinely surprised that there was not a wait for a party of 11 When we arrived at the table there was one server whom took our drink order, and didn't return for at least 20 minutes to take our meal order Whilst having AMPLE amount of time to look over the extensive menu I sprung for the boneless wings. Might I say that this was a major disappointment. The sauce that they were coated in was grainy, and the pieces of meat were over breaded and slightly overlooked.  Once we had finished we were surprised that with low volume it took our server 30+ minutes after we had all competed our meal to return to the table Needless to say I do not plan on returning to this location any time soon"
Pam D.,"Addison, TX",153,619,1091,4.0,12/30/2016,"I'm normally not a fan of chain restaurants, but I love coming here. The menu, while extensive, has something for everyone. Even if you're on a diet!  We've never had to wait long for a table and we're usually able to get a booth, which we prefer. If you sign up for their rewards program, you'll get priority on the wait list (if there is one) and the hostess will already know the table style you prefer.  My favorite menu item is their pizza!! I usually get the Sweet Pig (pineapple & ham & tomatoes). When my husband wants pizza too, we're able to get a large and get completely different toppings on each side, which is nice. I also like all of the appetizers I have tried.  We enjoy the variety of beers. The BJ's house beers are fine and relatively inexpensive - I usually order the Hopstorm unless there is an interesting seasonal. We noticed yesterday that you can order beers in pitchers! We have sometimes had issues with servers coming back to get our order for a second round, so a pitcher is a great compromise. Also new is their BJ's app, which basically ensures you talk to as few employees as possible. Fine by me! You can pay your check on the app without requesting it from the server. You can even have your orders for food placed and in their system as soon as you are seated at the table so the kitchen starts preparing them - in case you're really in a hurry.  BJ's also hosts beer dinners, which we haven't been to yet but we plan to go soon.  They have enough TV's to catch a game, but you may want to make sure the host knows what you're trying to watch. The only time I've seen them pipe in sound is for the Cowboys games."
Isra A.,"Dallas, TX",0,24,,5.0,11/2/2017,"I came here to redeem my free pizookie offer and had to get it taken out because I was in a hurry. The take out area is seperate which I really like because other restaurant setups can get awkward.  The server quickly took my order without any hassle or attitude. I ordered the oreo one and it was ready to go in 5-7 minutes. I was wary about how they would pack it but it was packaged perfectly and a lot of fun eating outside.  The pizookie was absolutely AMAZING. I get why people rave about them now, and will 100% be going back for more. I was worried that it would be too little but ended up being exactly the right amount.  This place is going to become a regular!"
Jon K.,"Chapel Hill, NC",28,4,,1.0,5/25/2017,"I normally don't complain about the service at restaurant but quite honestly, this is the worst customer service I've had in quite a while and I felt compelled to dissuade people from coming here. Came out with a large party.  Took an hour to get our order and another hour to get our lukewarm pizza.  Actually, I wouldn't call it lukewarm. It was pretty much cold, and let's not get started with the drink refills. Definitely not the service or quality I expected from a BJs"
Kristen S.,"Dallas, TX",59,6,,2.0,6/2/2017,"It a rainy night but still no excuse. Within 10 minutes of arriving I saw one man slip and fall to the ground and a girl slip just after. The staff needs to keep up with wet floors since their slate entrance is ruthless. When leaving, I slipped on my crutches due to the exterior black cement. I'm all for atmosphere but this is idiotic."
Tokyo C.,"Garland, TX",30,189,467,5.0,4/30/2017,Our server John P. Was excellent. We are part of the loyalty program and took advantage of the bogo free entrees. Enjoyed the salmon quinoa and pork chop. Took awhile to get our Brussel sprouts appetizer but Server was good about addressing that. Awesome customer service. Thank you
Cris W.,"Wynnewood North, Dallas, TX",8,1,,5.0,7/9/2017,"To the generous family who took care of my check yesterday  thanks a million!  You did it anonymously. I don't know who you are, but I will always remember you kind gesture.  Thanks again from my heart!"
Kaelie P.,"Garland, TX",0,19,77,5.0,7/5/2017,"Amazing place with more of an upbeat atmosphere and pizazz than most places. More than you'd expect for somewhere with pizza, pasta and sandwiches or steak. They definitely have an incredible layout with tables for smaller parties that unfold at the edges for extra elbow room, booth style seating for dates (2) or groups (7) and sets of tables together (8+). Chairs are padded and comfortable for long durations. They have season drinks for the different tastes throughout the year. Also the usual beers and soft drinks. Try the deep dish pizza, half off large prices on Mondays, for a real treat. The pizookies are absolutely divine and everyone should try. The sample version is just a little two much for two grown adults."
Beverly S.,"Irving, TX",16,8,4,3.0,1/30/2017,I enjoy the relaxed feel and food. The prices are reasonable. Visited this place 01-29-17. The waiter was polite but I wished he could have been more attentive to our table. Our food took quite a while to come out and our dessert seemed to take forever. Around 30 minutes. The restaurant was not extremely busy so I'm not sure what was taking the food and dessert as long as it did.  Overall is a good place to go I rated three out of five due to the long wait for the food and dessert.
Shawn M.,"Abilene, TX",44,18,19,4.0,3/18/2017,"BJ's Brewhouse located in Addison, TX is a chain that I would call a mix between Cheesecake Factory and Chili's.  Atmosphere: BJ's has a very well lit, modern space with comfortable seating and a nice layout. We sat on the patio this visit due to having gorgeous 80* weather in the middle of March. The patio has very comfortable seating and plenty of umbrella coverage to keep the sun off our backs. 1 Star Service: We were the first customers to enter the building and the hostess gave us the run of the place. She let us choose wherever we wanted to sit. As mentioned, we opted to enjoy the beautiful weather and eat on the patio. Our waitress promptly came to the table, gave us all menus, took our drink and appetizer orders, and promptly returned. She gave us plenty of leeway to take our time and decipher the vast menu. When we were ready she took our order and quickly refreshed our drinks. Food was out in a jiffy. She was very pleasant and addressed the kids as if they were just as important as we adults. 2 Stars Food: As is typical of a large chain, the food was well thought out and was presented well. All of the sauces/dressings were pretty decent and the food was brought out hot and cooked just the way we ordered it. We ordered the pulled pork sandwich (daughter though it was great, I thought it was acceptable,) a Cobb salad, which my wife thought was quite good, and I ordered from their ""Enlightened Menu."" I chose the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos. I ordered them with the greek yogurt crema and the red wine vinaigrette on the side. It arrived exactly how I ordered it. This is one of the freshest dishes I have had at a large chain. The cucumbers were nice and crunchy with juicy diced tomatoes and well seasoned chicken. There was also feta but it was scant. The pita was a bit doughy but still tasted fine. All in all, I give the food 1 star.  ------------------------ My rating system: Up to 1 star for atmosphere (Let's face it, I could eat Franklin BBQ on a dirty napkin while sitting in the bed of my truck.) Up to 2 stars apiece for both food and service (these are the two things that will either drive me away or reel me back in)------------------------ My rating system: Up to 1 star for atmosphere (Let's face it, I could eat Franklin BBQ on a dirty napkin while sitting in the bed of my truck.) Up to 2 stars apiece for both food and service (these are the two things that will either drive me away or reel me back in) 1 Star-Wouldn't let my dog eat here 2 Star-Below average-usually something really struck me as being bad and I doubt I would ever return.  3 Star-Average-Might come back. Might not if there are better options.  4 Star-Above average-will definitely come back and try something new. Probably had great service as well.  5 Star-Phenomenal-Will definitely return for such an amazing experience."
Drew B.,"Bedford, TX",0,3,,1.0,10/5/2017,"I've heard the food is good here, but unfortunately I sat at my table for 10 minutes without any help. Not even a ""hi"" or getting me started with a drink. Not a good experience."
Brooke N.,"Dallas, TX",0,11,,5.0,11/25/2017,"Besides the fact that the food was amazing, there was exceptional service. I had a gift card that had been given to me as a gift that had not been loaded correctly so it said $0 on it. When this issue was brought to the managers attention, she comped the amount that the gift card was supposed to be for! The waitress was also great. Overall, amazing trip!!"
Scarlet F.,"Dallas, TX",126,60,26,4.0,8/29/2016,"I've been to this place twice and I'd say, for a chain restaurant, it's really good. For starters, I can really appreciate how they keep the place really clean and fresh even though they handle a lot of traffic. I've been to the location in Addison twice and each time, the floors are clean, tables are clean and fresh and the bathrooms are well kept.  On my most recent visit, I ordered beer glazed ribs and season wedged fries. I absolutely loved the ribs, the may be my new favorite. I had the lunch portion, so it was about 6 ribs and the rest of the plate in fries. The waiter suggested a seasonal peach drink and I thought it was a good suggestion, but it wasn't prepared well... It was really really tart and hard to drink, but hey... I never waste alcohol, so I drank it.  On both visits I received really good service. The food was good and the overall experience was good. It's pretty much what I expected both times."
Bill N.,"Allen, TX",314,52,7,2.0,9/24/2017,"Ok, very poor service today. Lots of help but no one helping. Finally got up and went over to server station where two people were standing and talking. Reached over the glass and got my own ketchup. I ordered a burger with no bun and no fries but ordered a salad. I told server to bring out salad with meal. So they bring out the salad early and then we waited for food too. Bring out my burger with a bun and with fries. It's like they didn't hear a thing I said. My wife asked for mustard to be brought out with her sliders but noooo! This just goes on and on."
Susan B.,"Grand Prairie, TX",4,107,2,3.0,7/23/2016,"I gave BJ's three stars, but that's actually A-OK in Yelp terms.  I enjoy coming here for lunch with friends.  The service is always good, even at a busy lunchtime.   I went this last Thursday for lunch with a friend and had the lunch special with a mini ham and pineapple pizza along with the feta and watermelon salad (the salad had a little up charge because it was a specialty salad).  I loved the salad and would order one for a main course if they offered it in a bigger size.  Refreshing greens and watermelon along with sprinkles of feta and pickled onion.  The dressing was just right and lightly applied.  The pizza, though, wasn't as good as I remembered - came out barely warm to the touch and didn't have much cheese.  A little disappointed in that. My friend had a dinner salad (good) along with the new bacon, avocado and tomato grilled cheese and she loved it.  I was full or would've tasted it.  The new piadinas look good and I would definitely try those. Good service, pretty good food and a great drink selection - both alcoholic and non-alcoholic.  I'll always be back for a nice lunch and good venue."
Liz T.,"Irving, TX",99,282,217,4.0,8/21/2016,"Food was hit it miss. My fried chicken was excellent, but I thought the much-raved pizza was sub par. Still, everyone else liked it, so I think I must just be missing New York style.  The real problem was the timing: we were on lunch break and the food took over 40 mins to come out. While I might come back for dinner, I wouldn't risk getting fired over lunch. Pokestop on premises."
Eric M.,"Dallas, TX",80,115,31,3.0,12/15/2016,"Anytime you see a menu as thick as a phone book (ok, I am exaggerating), you have to wonder if anything can be great. The new vegan lentil soup was great! Loved it. I ordered it with the unlimited soup and salad lunch special. I chose the caesar salad, which wasn't bad. But no one ever asked if I wanted a refill so it was limited by that. It's a good place for a big group because there is something for everyone."
Shannon S.,"Irving, TX",52,165,187,4.0,6/5/2016,The staff here was really nice. We enjoyed the Berry Burst Cidar and BJ's pizza. I think this place would be a nice happy hour spot during g the week. You could watch the game and have a cidar. I alsonliked the fact that they had free wifi which let the kiddo watch YouTube while we ate.
BigMouth H.,"Carrollton, TX",0,7,,3.0,8/2/2017,"I love their chips and queso.  I tried their ribs and mini california supreme pizza. Ribs had lots of meat in and mini pizza was good. Also, was soft.  Service was slow and the waitress forgot twice about what we asked for. I think it was just only our table but other tables seemed not having problems like we did."
Shy T.,"Austin, TX",0,169,1,3.0,10/8/2017,Went to BJ's after the fair. It was good as usual. We had the avocado egg rolls and the California Cobb flatbread. They never disappoint when it comes to these two dishes. Will definitely be back when in town.
Dana And Danielle C.,"Carrollton, TX",45,33,77,4.0,6/23/2016,"The menu is very expansive and can be somewhat intimidating! But we'd definitely recommend the pepperoni flat bread, spinach salad, and the pizookie!!  ***Update*** My sister and I went to this location on 6/21/16 to take advantage of free pizookie day! We ordered queso for an appetizer and a half and half pizza to share for dinner. After receiving our queso, it had green onions on it although we had requested they be taken off. However, we overlooked this and picked them off.  Our pizza arrived shortly thereafter. It looked amazing and we couldn't wait to dig in. Unfortunately after we started eating my sister pulled a long hair out of her mouth that was not hers. It even have cheese baked on it!  We called the waiter over to tell him about this and he said sorry. He offered to remake it, but we didn't want to take another chance. He then brought the ticket over and told us to have a good evening.  We were very disappointed that a manager did not come over to offer apologizes for having hair in the pizza and even more disappointing was that we didn't get, to get nor were offered our pizookie; but the main issue here is the hair in the pizza, which is completely unacceptable!"
Jessica T.,"Dallas, TX",164,24,19,4.0,7/4/2017,"BJs is definitely one of my favorite places to go to with friends! Im the type of person that gets the same few dishes each time I come. Yes, Im one of those haha. If you are looking to split a meal, I would get a deep dish pizza. I love most of their toppings but my go to is gourmet five meat and BJs favorite! Very filling and my favorite go to pizza spot! Check it out!"
Mike S.,"Dallas, TX",55,291,1379,4.0,9/15/2015,"I like this place because: - Large selection of meals  - Menu indicates Calorie count - Excellent food  - Friendly staff - great for a date, small group, or office outings"
Jt J.,"Irving, TX",21,14,8,1.0,9/25/2017,I odered my steak well done.  They burnt the rolls & my steak was way to pink to eat it!  I feel bad for the waiter staff.  They try to do everything right Jeff is great but they get blamed when the food isn't right!
Hugh J.,"Dallas, TX",0,43,,2.0,4/10/2017,Arrived around 5 on Sunday. The place was about a third full. We were greeted nicely at the door but that's where the nice bit ended. We were seated in a booth and we waited and waited. Then after about 20 mins someone called Logan came to the table. We ordered some chips/salsa a tea and a water. Then waited and waited for another 10-15 mins then Logan ambles back and drops off the drinks and Chips/Salsa. The first thing we noticed was how greasy and oily the chips were. They weren't very nice at all. We gave our main order to Logan and he disappeared for another 20-25mins. Our drinks were empty and I had to ask another server to re-fill the drinks. When my pulled pork sandwich arrived the coleslaw was missing. So Logan says we will make some fresh just for you. I did tell him it was supposed to come with the meal but it seemed I was speaking Japanese. Then eventually the coleslaw arrived but I had already finished my sandwich so we left asap.. On the outside it seems like a very nice place but there seems to be training or something that these people are missing. We won't be going back here..
Randall R.,"Sachse, TX",216,257,62,2.0,12/26/2015,"Normally I would be reluctant to rate a restaurant based on the experience at a large (100 people), private room party, but it was not my first visit, nor was it the only disappointing one. Soft, cold, salty, chewy pizza.  Red Baron out of the oven would beat this mess. Rounding out the disappointment was an under-sauced spaghetti and the blandest meatballs ever served. The second star was earned by attentive service and prompt, frequent refills of the iced tea - I go plain, but several of my dining companions suggested the sweet tea would go great on pancakes and had to water theirs down 50-50. WIGB?  Only to ask for directions."
Paulo P.,"Sarasota, FL",0,57,52,1.0,8/17/2016,"Service was ok but I got flat beer 2 times order same appetizer and chips was so oily could eat I complain to the manager and promise fix and bring me another one he change but bring another just bad like the last one, and I decide to not order nothing else. I will not came back for sure and I not recommend this place"
Sumeet K.,"Plano, TX",44,71,18,5.0,4/16/2017,"My go-to place when it comes to a nice laid back evening with good ambience, great service and top-quality food. Their enlightened menu options are amazing. Love the north beach mahi mahi and shrimp. One of my fav healthy food option. Highly recommended. :)"
Brandi V.,"McKinney, TX",218,5,,2.0,11/12/2016,Went in after working a double to enjoy some drinks and food with the boyfriend to get below mediocre service. We chose to sit at the bar since nobody else was. Ordered shots then the female bartender(she didnt say her name) walked off..didnt offer appetizers or drinks or food. For being her only guests waiting 5+ minutes to come check on us is pretty ridiculous.  She did take off two drinks orders to compensate for my boyfriends veteran discount($12.95).  Food was delicious as always. Just wont be sitting with her again.
G C.,"Lewisville, TX",0,2,,1.0,4/19/2017,"One star for a decent bathroom.   Service was crap but maybe the waitress had a lot on her mind. The food didn't look anything like the menu. Okay McDonald's  Just pushing orders out of the kitchen. Even missing ingredients. Like, avocado egg rolls literally JUST had avocado in it, no cream cheese or whatever else. Just unseasoned avocado. Like why don't I just eat one out of the refrigerator at home. Literally just wrapped avocado in an egg roll sheet and fried it.  One thing I can't stand is going out and wishing you stayed home. Bj's is usually good but I'm from cali and maybe the standards of restaurants are higher. Nice try but Never again. Bland, Cheap, and just LAZY. No bueno"
