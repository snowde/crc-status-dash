Joey P.,"Dallas, TX",5,47,38,4.0,5/31/2014,Really enjoy it here. Good selection and very good food. The orange cream soda is absolutely fantastic. Service is also good. I would definitely eat here again.
Jim M.,"York, PA",86,216,15,4.0,6/14/2015,Very good dinner. I had the blonde crafy beer and it was very tasty. Highly recommended
Dena F.,"Dallas, TX",922,1036,254,4.0,7/27/2009,"A keeper league this year...geez.  Met with the planning commission of our annual fantasy football league to set the rules for the upcoming season.  Yes, I'm the commissioner--meaning no one else wants to mess with all the computer crud.  Aftter a couple of the amazing Berry Ciders I didn't mind the appointment. We met at BJ's in Addison.  We sat in the bar and ordered chips and salsa, burgers, fries...and I really liked my burger.  The fries are the super thin crispy ones.  They taste a little sweet to me which is probably why I kept eating them even though I was full.   I have to admit I'm a little confused about the low reviews.  I'm a burger and fry snob and I thought they were good, not the best I've ever had, but good.  I'll gladly go again. Which is more than I can say for the league if I get tenth position in the draft AGAIN.  I've had it twice in four years.  Grrrrr......"
John P.,"Denton, TX",38,142,1,4.0,4/19/2012,"One of my new favorite watering holes. It's semi upscale, the beer selection is amazing. The food was just as amazing, I had the Parmesan Crusted Chicken, it was heavenly, made somewhat like a german wiener schnitzel. love this place!"
A C.,"Dallas, TX",71,30,5,4.0,5/30/2014,"I used to go to BJ's in Tyson s Corner, VA all the time. Moved down here and checked this one out. They had my favorite BJ micro brew, ""Nutty Brunette"" on draft and the bartender, Trina, was awesome to talk to. Gave me all kinds of tips and recommendations for places to go in the area. Great service, great beer, and an attractive restaurant/bar layout. I will definitely be back."
Brittny B.,"Dallas, TX",70,10,7,5.0,5/3/2014,Jeff is the best server! The food here is amazing but Jeff's service made our experience even better!
Connie J.,"Dallas, TX",11,35,6,1.0,4/25/2014,"Love the food BUT the waiter I had was a jerk! We had called ahead to see if they were still doing a special I'd heard about, I was told they were via phone, arrived to find out they weren't and then the waiter had the nerve to tell us several times that he'd have to speak to a manger because they really don't make exceptions once it's over as if we were a nuisance. He made me and my family feel like we were lucky they did us that favor. I felt insulted and haven't been back since. Shame people like him can take business from an otherwise good restaurant."
Josh M.,"Springfield, MO",2,4,,3.0,5/20/2014,"I normally really like this place. Pretty good for a chain. I don't know if it was because I ordered food at 10pm or just the cooks, but my food was really bland. I ordered the cherry glazed salmon and everything was mushy , kind of weird. I have it a 3 star because my server, Jorge, was great. Very prompt and respectful . But c'mon!!! It's a 14 dollar plate , put a tad but of effort into it!"
Terry W.,"Grapevine, TX",15,112,4,3.0,6/13/2012,"First, my wife had the Ahi Tuna salad and it was incredible.  I had a mini pizza and the Scampi pasta.   My pizza was greasy and not very appetizing.  Everyone raves about the pizza, but I do not get it.  Go to Mellow Mushroom Southlake for pizza and you will not be disappointed.   My pasta was dry and flavorless. We go the Baked Beignet dessert and it was good, but it was better at the Hurst location."
Niki S.,"Murphy, TX",31,208,,3.0,5/4/2012,Have been to this location several times and it's pretty calm compared to other Addison bars.  The parking situation can get a little crazy- lot was full even though the bar was not which leads me to believe the patrons of surrounding establishments are pirating the spaces.  I appreciate that BJ's does not have the smokey ambiance of most Addison bars.   The staff at this location are very nice and do make an effort to make small talk with each customer.  The flatbread margherita pizza is delicious- I seriously want the recipe for their sauce.  Will definitely consider BJ's next time I want to watch the big game.
Jessica V.,"Richardson, TX",147,194,973,2.0,2/27/2014,"BJs rarely has decent food but it's not great. There's a lot of better restaurants in the area for the same price point. Id suggest going for a drink with some small bites at most. Their cream soda that they brew is pretty tasty though, besides that it's never a restaurant I choose to go to first."
Jean W.,"Celina, TX",14,48,9,3.0,6/6/2015,Mahi Mahi tacos were very good but not much fish in them. Brussel sprouts were burnt but Mgr did remove them from our bill. Caritas green chili fries...too many fries that got soggy and not enough chilies or meat. Luv bjs but some items are a disappointment
Delilah D.,"Dallas, TX",0,30,,2.0,6/4/2014,"Eh, it's another Humperdink's. Larger, yes, more menu items, yes, but not inspiring at all or true to the description. My hand crafted beer, to be really honest, was flat, and not icy cold. I hate flat, cool beer. The food, saaaalty. Normally, we have to drink gallons after pho, but boy were we surprised how long it took to rehydrate. Kind of snuck up on us.  Also, greasy. The worst part, the music. It was so loud, and such a bad selection. You know, the kind of songs that are not great to begin with, and get louder and louder to compensate, that kind of loud. There were like 5 people in the whole darn place, and we could barely here each other. That's just ridiculous. Tom Thumb has better music! No excuse. So, nope, nope."
Rachel W.,"Dallas, TX",267,258,,4.0,2/24/2014,"This location on BJ's on restaurant row is super popular, and is always busy. Sometimes the wait staff is slacking, but the food is superb. Good here for lunch...great lunch specials."
Kenny F.,"Raleigh, NC",85,44,10,3.0,4/8/2012,Irish root beer is great.   The lettuce wrap app is fantastic.  Pizzas are mostly good.   Do not skip over a pizzooki!  You've been warned. ;)
Stephanie P.,"Dallas, TX",234,196,9,2.0,9/12/2011,"I met up with some friends here to watch a football game. We only chose this place because we knew it wasn't going to be packed. Isn't sad that we can guarantee this place won't be busy? haha, er.. I was there for almost 2.5 hours and saw the waiter TWICE. For you non-mathematical people, that's approximately 1 visit for every hour and fifteen minutes I was there.  I got there late and ate left over pizza that my friends ordered before I got there. It reminded me of Red Barron's frozen pizza but I actually like Red Barron pizza. Thank you BJ's for successfully doing something I can do at home."
Pablo M.,"Dallas, TX",9,15,17,4.0,3/5/2014,Driving by on a busy traffic nightmare I pull in for a bite around 6:30 PM on a Wednesday and the place was rocking.  Found a spot on the bar. The selection of beers are great and not to pricey compare to South Florida. I order the avocado egg rolls (amazing) plus an order of chicken wings.  Just enough flavor and heat to make them one of my favorites in town.  Overall got to bring my BB for a nice meal.  Love the ambient and will come back.
Nene S.,"Dallas, TX",0,10,,5.0,7/30/2015,Never had a bad experience here! I tried everything on the menu and not one was bad. I come here a lot!! Avocado rolls are a must have for appetizer !
Fregilia L.,"Houston, TX",200,385,91,4.0,1/8/2014,This place has some really good food and they are not stingy with the selections either. Everything we ordered came out Big and lots of it. I almost felt as if I should have ordered from the kid's menu so I could have a normal serving. I ordered the shrimp scampi....I swear this is like my favorite dish to order anywhere. I tried their fried mozzarella sticks and they were heavenly. They even make their own root beer which is very tasty. The space is pretty big and I can tell this place probably gets super packed during game season. Our waitress was amazing and smiled the entire time. She made sure we had refills and that we were happy. I appreciate that especially since her section was so busy. If I am back in Dallas I am definitely going to check out this place again and maybe order something different.
Sherrie G.,"Dallas, TX",1,17,,3.0,3/25/2016,"I went here with a singles group on Tuesday. We had reservations for 20 people. I was the host. I was ecstatic at first because a) our table was actually setup and ready when I walked in and b) because they said they'd assigned two waiters to our table. I thought this would be wonderful. That was short-lived however. We had to flag down and beg for every drink we got even though the two waiters were constantly at the register directly behind us. Not once did they bother to lean over or come around to see if we'd like another drink or ask how we were doing. They missed opportunities all over the place as we were all ordering alcoholic beverages and many would have liked dessert menus after the meal. But none of this was offered. We were brought checks without anyone asking if we'd like something else. We felt like we were being dismissed. I could understand if we were a young, rowdy group who was ordering nothing but water and salads. But we were all financially sound, mature individuals ordering full meals and craft cocktails and wine. Why we would be ignored, then dismissed was a mystery to me. It was their loss. And for the record, the food was only average, nothing special in any way. The alcohol was watered (not saying that because of the other problems, but that was my first problem with them). I REALLY hate writing bad reviews but our group will not be using this restaurant in the future."
