Jonathan S.,"Houston, TX",213,152,68,3.0,11/16/2015,"BJ's is always good. Doesn't matter where you go. I was impressed with how quick the service was for nine in the evening on a Friday. We got there with a party of seven and we were able to be seated within ten minutes. In the mean time we went over to the bar to grab a drink, and again even though it was packed we got our drinks within about five minutes. Plus, the bartender was letting us try some of the other seasonal drinks there. We sat, ordered our food, and were eating within 20 minutes. The server was really nice, and helpful. Food was good, but I felt like the Bacon, Chicken, Ranch pizza I got was lacking on the toppings. However, it was good none the less. The waiter was awesome and gave us the $10 off coupon that is on here even though our bill was $33 instead of the $35 minimum. Pretty good guy. I really appreciated that. I think all the foreigners loved it, and we are probably going back. BJ's just never lets you down."
Allison Y.,"Houston, TX",441,238,151,4.0,1/29/2013,"Came with a big group and the staff was kind enough to split checks. Our server was super friendly and came back often to check on us. We were in a rush, so he brought out the checks with the food. Props to him! Gave him an extra tip. I decided to go healthy with the Mango Thai Chicken Salad. Yummy! Fresh ingredients, very light, and good variety of fruit + veggies + meat. The sandwiches and burgers that my friends got were decently sized portions. Feedback from them was generally good. Nothing that blew our minds, but not a bad place to come back to. Bottom line: Decent quality food + drink selection. On the pricey side, but you will get good food for your money."
Donna D.,"Addison, TX",26,11,30,3.0,8/6/2015,"BJ's has a giant menu! Although half of it is alcohol, it can still be pretty overwhelming. Anyway, out of all of those choices I have always loved the appetizer avocado egg rolls. They're usually great BUT...of course on my first and only visit to this location I was very disappointed. They were filled with far too much of the creamy, spicy sauce and the rest was with tiny, squishy, overly ripe avocados. :( I couldn't take it, so I sent it back for some fried Mahi Mahi fish tacos, which were awesome! I'm still sad about my go to dish turning out so awful, though."
Jess H.,"Plano, TX",0,9,,3.0,1/17/2016,"The BJ's in Lewisville puts this one to shame!  The service has been bad multiple times (I love the food so I go back hoping for better).  But the root beer, which I love, even seems to have went downhill also."
Elizabeth E.,"Addison, TX",0,2,,5.0,2/24/2016,"We eat at BJ's several times a month.  They have a very large menu, but I have my favorites: Pot stickers, burgers and Roast Beef Dip.  Join their loyalty program, you get coupons and each visit earns points towards free food."
Monique C.,"Dallas, TX",1,30,15,2.0,8/29/2014,Well let's start out with the greeting when we first walked in. The hostess with the short black hair cut to her chin with bangs never  acknowledged we were standing there while she pretended to be busy. After five minutes she looked up no smile or anything and asked us did we want to sit at the bar. We said no we would like to be seated. She said oh ok well if you sit at the bar someone will come give you a menu. So at that point we realized she didn't want to seat us and went To seat ourselves by the bar. The food and service was good at the bar. Then when we left no goodnight or thanks for coming she just was talking with a coworker as if we never existed. She is the first impression I have of your business and my first time being here was not a good experience. Greeters smile and greet it can't be that hard to pretend to be nice even if you really aren't. That's your job.
Denise V.,"Dallas, TX",14,149,43,3.0,6/30/2014,"First visit at 11 pm last night. Nobody was monitoring walk ins for seating. We stood there awhile and I finally caught a female server's eye and asked if we were supposed to seat ourselves. She said 'wait a min' and came over and looked at a computer screen, so I asked again 'are we supposed to seat ourselves' and she snipped back some short remark and then seated us. My daughter remarked that she was rude. She was.  Party of three. We wanted finger foods. Male server took drink order. Them we wanted to order food right away becuz hungry. I started by asking for calamari. My friend was about to order but server said he would put calamari in and come back for food order. I said we r about ready. He repeated he would put calamari in first and walked away. I had to get up to follow him and tell him that, no, we don't want calamari out first  and want to order all appetizers now so all come out at same time.  Friend has to ask for coffee refill. Food was pretty good...enjoyable. But service stank."
Elizabeth G.,"McKinney, TX",6,12,2,4.0,1/29/2016,I had the Brewhouse burger and fries the burger was a little too pink for me and the fries were delicious.  The service was excellent.
Cara J.,"Dallas, TX",0,4,6,3.0,3/12/2015,For a mass produced get them in and out the food is what is expected.. I've never had a problem love coming to watch the games and since BWW is always so crowded this is a better scene for me.. What I do like that was changed in the last year is they have gluten free options which is important my child has celiac and they even have a gluten free cookie for dessert so she is able to enjoy all things pizza and pazookies.. So they get 3 stars wavering on 4 and we will of course be back
K C.,"Bedford, TX",32,73,60,3.0,10/26/2014,"I paid 42 bucks for a pasta dinner, drink and appetizer. It was really over priced. I was expecting amazing food. It really wasn't. I get people like the pizza, maybe should've gone with that. The woman waiting on is was great tho. Food came out a little slow for a Wednesday night. All in all average. Like a pricier chili's."
Maxwell S.,"Fort Worth, TX",1,3,,2.0,7/13/2016,"The person who seated us informed my party (of 4) that it was happy hour, handed us the separate happy hour menu and pointed to us the happy hour specials. However, our waitress informed us she could not honor the happy hour prices (it was for the bar only). We asked her to inform the person up front (who seated us) of his error. She told us it was actually the manager, who has been ""doing this all day"" & also seated another party at the table next to ours and informed that table that it was happy hour as well! On a positive note, the food was pretty good (reason why I am giving 2 stars). I am hoping you can resolve this confusion for the restaurant staff to provide better service & keep us customers happy."
Kris V.,"Carrollton, TX",0,6,,1.0,8/4/2016,"I've eaten there about 4 times and every time I wonder why I go back. This is the last time, no more . Service is always slow, food is not hot and usually not good. The chicken Alfredo was incredibly bland. No flavor at all, took 2 bites and sent it back when the waitress finally checked back. I do not recommend, there are so many better restaurants in Addison."
Robin C.,"Dallas, TX",4,4,,4.0,4/22/2014,Went there last night for dinner and drinks with some friends.  I will admit I am a frequent visitor here and I will continue to visit this restaurant.  The food is always delicious and my beer is always served cold.  The waitstaff is ever friendly and smiling. If you're looking for a place to hang out with your friends after work and not spend a lot of money for good drinks then this is the place to go.
Michelle H.,"San Antonio, TX",45,820,6542,5.0,3/18/2013,"Their turkey burger is delish!!! Wasn't dry and bland---but this time the top bun was a bit burnt. It was ok, still good!  Love their pizzas and flatbreads too. Delish! They don't skimp out on the toppings either.  Good variety of beer, but can be a little overpriced compared to other bars.  I've liked everything I ordered here so far.  Huge menu with good food and drinks----perfect combo."
Jennifer S.,"Phoenix, AZ",903,3906,46,4.0,8/6/2014,"I ate lunch here for the first time this week and really enjoyed the experience.  The server was super professional, efficient and friendly.  The atmosphere is nice...nothing extraordinary as you are in a chain restaurant.  My food was delicious - the Mediterranean chicken pita tacos were so tasty with a side of seasonal bistro grains.  I will definitely come back again for the same lunch!"
Elizabeth P.,"Dallas, TX",159,4,,5.0,2/5/2016,"I absolutely love this location. The wait staff is always very friendly and attentive, they are always open later then most places which is awesome when I get out of work early cause I work in a bar. The food is always awesome they have in house crafted sodas which are super yummy and the Parmesan crusted chicken is to die for!"
Franklin C.,"Dallas, TX",89,65,23,3.0,9/29/2015,Nice restaurant to go to late in the evening. Menu has wide variety from pizzas to salads to sandwiches to steaks. I ended up getting a pizza and salad to go along with it. 3.5 stars for the food and service. Price point was higher than expected for the quality of food that was received bringing it down to 3.
Shirley B.,"Dallas, TX",68,103,780,3.0,9/16/2012,"I love the service. The menu has lot's of interesting items. I haven't figured it out yet,   it's something about the place that makes me want to just go in and have a seat, and eat. I have a hard time deciding what I want every time."
Marilyn M.,"Dallas, TX",463,436,115,4.0,4/30/2012,"Yes, it's a chain, but one of my favorites. Craving a salad, checked out their menu on line and saw some new items.  So, off I go to this nearby spot with my Kindle in hand one late Sunday afternoon. As always, greeted by a friendly smiling hostess and taken to a comfy booth.  Cody, my server, promptly appears and welcomes me to BJ's.  He suggested their featured beer, Oasis Amber, his favorite, and I go with his recommendation.  And, yes, it was just 'delish; light but with a nice degree of depth.  And, I love the tall slim pint glasses that present the tasty brew. not to mention.  FROSTY COLD ! I had the BBQ Chicken Salad which consisted of tomatoes, corn, green onions, black beans, jicama, cilantro, mozzarella cheese, BBQ sauce and iceberg lettuce; I added sliced boiled egg.  I ordered the special BBQ ranch dressing on the side.  This humongous salad was made even better by the topping of  lots of crunchy, sweet onion strings.  The presentation was beautiful, so much so  I really hated to dig into this bowl of goodness  But, of course, I did. And, there were flavors galore, all blending so well for a scrumptious result.  And, that BBQ Ranch dressing? Whomever came up with this combination is a foodie genus.  Absolutely yummy! A side of BBQ sauce was also included.  The greens were cold, fresh and crisp; a generous portion of the tender, moist chicken and assorted veges made this a meal that could have easily been shared by two people. I also requested some garlic bread and Cody told me they could make some ""pasta bread"".  Those carbs were simply delectable.  Lightly toasted with Parmesan cheese, herbs and garlic. Crunchy and soft at the same time.  I could have easily eaten all 4 slices but used a modicum of self control.  (Surprisingly, there was no extra charge for this added item.  How nice!) I really enjoy BJ's.  The service, atmosphere and food is constantly consistent.  I've always had a good experience regardless of what food items I have selected; and the enormous variety of  menu options always fulfill my cravings of the moment.    All the servers seem to have the same philosophy of customer service which is ""treat the customer well and they'll return"".  And, I do, and I will :) It's a great atmosphere to sip on a cold brew and get a few more chapters in the book behind me."
Andrea R.,"Carrollton, TX",391,290,32,4.0,1/3/2013,"I'm back on the BJ's fan club.  I cannot promise it will be long-term, but right now I'm loving it.  I am actually loving it so much that I've gotten take-out.  Whoa.  It's the Hawaiian Mahi Mahi, it's got me.  BJ's has some new ""EnLIGHTened"" menu options for the more health-conscious folks (I try!).  Thai Chicken Mango Salad, Creole Tilapia, Chicken a la Fresca, Mediterranean Veggie Pasta, just to name a few!  I will probably try them all, but for now I'm addicted to the Mahi.  If you're a fan of deep dish pizza, this is one of the few places that you can get it in the area, and it's good! I've been lucky to get good service the last few times I've been to BJ's.  It's a great place to watch sports, and has a small patio for outdoor seating.  I can see from other reviews that I'm not the only one with a love/hate thing for BJ's, so hopefully it will stay on my good side this time."
