Ilexa S.,"Dallas, TX",119,31,20,2.0,8/23/2015,"Pizza was very good! We got the deep dish and were able to split the toppings!! However, service was a hot mess!! Now I was brought a very hot cup of water to wrap my hands around but she was slow too many hanging around doing nothing."
G K.,"Arlington, TX",5,24,9,1.0,5/20/2015,"Alexander Y was our server tonight and he was horrible. Don't go here.  The food was ok, avocado egg rolls were the best but overall a horrible experience!"
Jaclyn C.,"Frisco, TX",0,11,,1.0,11/20/2016,"Worst experience at a restaurant in Addison definitely goes to BJ's Brewhouse. After a 12+ hour day at work, my boyfriend and I decided to order BJ's to go. Placed our to go order at 9:47pm online. Get to BJ's at 10:11 to pick up our order. Mind you, it was an appetizer, entree, side salad and bread bowl soup. We got inside and swiped the card at 10:17pm. 20 minutes later, the to go server tells us that they were out of bread bowls and that's what was taking so long. He asked my boyfriend if that was ""ok"" and offered a free appetizer or pizookie. The other part of our order was just sitting in their warmers for the last 20 minutes. After demanding to speak with a manager, they had the audacity to try to give us the food that was STILL SITTING in the warmers. The manager refunded the card and supposedly made us a new order of food, but after getting home, I realize that was not the case. The mozzarella sticks taste like they are under cooked, my salad that I specified ""no onions"" had them on it and my boyfriend's Fish & Chips were soggy. The only thing that was somewhat decent was the Broccoli Cheddar soup, but honestly, who can screw up soup?!? Even though we got a refund, this was an experience that I never want us to go through again. BJ's in Addison, you will never have our business again and definitely ruined our Sunday night after a long day of work."
Misha B.,"San Jose, CA",35,15,4,4.0,10/1/2015,The waitress was very crappy but the food was amazing. The cocktail and flatbread were savoury beyond belief. I loved the food here. It also came out relatively quickly even though the place was packed on a weekday. Yum!
Jessie R.,"Plano, TX",52,60,52,5.0,8/6/2014,Find myself going to dinner at this location a lot when friends come to visit. BJs is one of those places that has so many different food options that it can easily keep everyone in the group happy. Something for everyone. Very cool environment too!  I have been here three times so far and have never had a service problem. The servers always do a good job. I went to a different BJs recently and it seemed so chaotic and disorganized and it took us forever to get seated. This one seems to have their stuff together.  I love the cream soda and I'm a fan of the burgers here. I tried the Cajun chicken pasta and was not too impressed with it. The sauce was not what I expected at all. One of the highlights for me and one of the reasons my friends love this place is the dessert. The pazookies are the best! They are all good!!!
Debbie C.,"Great Falls, VA",22,96,13,3.0,9/2/2015,"The food was plentiful, tasty and the staff is very nice. It wasn't easy for the to accommodate my food allergy, but after several attempts I found something safe to order. The wait was a little long for the food, but we enjoyed an appetizer and sports on the televisions. We will absolutely return to BJ's."
Kristen D.,"Plano, TX",189,561,79,4.0,11/12/2012,"I have been here on many occasions for lunch and dinner.  Their food never ceases to amaze me with flavor.  I recent;y tried the new Thai Pot Stickers.  They were super fresh with a nice fried batter. We also ordered a deep dish pizza, which was good as always.  My only complaint on the pizza is that they do not spread their toppings well.  They all seem to be in the center, but the crust is so incredible.  I think here dessert is a MUST.  The pizookies are original and super, SUPER amazing.  Most recently;y, I had the oreo pizookie.  The hot cookie and ice cream are just a great taste.  They are cooked to perfection and served warm. Their service can be hit or miss.  Sometimes, they are quick to seat but not quick on taking care of you and vice versa. The tables are cool and it has a well-lit pub feel."
Vee V.,"Dallas, TX",0,18,4,2.0,4/18/2014,"I ordered a pizzokie trio and the ice cream was served melted. Our waiter was  very sweet to try to bring us more, but the manager informed us that the refrigerator was not getting cold enough for the ice cream to set. Melted ice cream =Unacceptable. By the time the second batch of ice cream was served (melted of course) the cookie had hardened! I now know why I've never frequented this place before..."
Alyssa R.,"Dallas, TX",0,2,,5.0,6/23/2016,"Everytime I go everything is excellent I think our servers name was Stan? But he was amazing kept checking on us and everything he's so kind, great service. Will definitely be coming back :)"
Glen P.,"Carrollton, TX",13,65,27,5.0,7/26/2014,"Great selection of crafted beers. Wife enjoyed the Peach Margarita. Bone-in NY Strip was cooked perfect. Great level of marble, juice, crust and flavor. Almost too much cheese on the baked potato.  Green beans were flavorless, but tender not mushy.   Killer Gormet Mac 'n' Cheese, but would prefer penne or elbow to rotini. Wife had the BBQ Chicken pizza and was very satisfied with it. Her Watermelon Feta salad didn't have noticible dressing but they brought her an extra dish of a nice balsamic."
Peter H.,"Richardson, TX",567,453,522,2.0,6/19/2012,"We went during the half off mini pizza happy hour.  I never really tried BJ's except for their cream soda so i had no idea what to expect. The boo and I ended up ordering 2 mini pizzas, the shrimp angel hair toscana and the grilled pork chop specialty.  The pizzas are deep dish style and was okay.  I would have preferred the toppings to be a bit more cooked.  The angel hair toscana was a bit bland for my boo's taste, salt was definately needed.  The grilled pork chop came with a nice mashed potatoes, green beans, and apple chutney.  The pork chops were small but it's expected.   I would honestly just go to BJ's for their happy hour pizzas, their menu items seem a bit lackluster."
Deb P.,"Bedford, TX",3,53,8,1.0,1/26/2014,"This was by far my worst experience at a restaurant in a loooong time. Our food arrived before our drinks! Our drinks were not correct. Then our dinner arrived (soups) and one was cold. Everything was wrong with this meal, drinks, appetizer, dinner.  The service was even poor. The manager did come talk with us and gave us our soups for free.    I have had some good experiences here but due to this experience I  likely won't go back."
Stefanie L.,"Dallas, TX",2445,950,1677,2.0,1/23/2014,Ive been to a few different BJ's restaurants but this was my first time to this one. I have to say I wasnt impressed. Service took quite a while just to simply get waters. I started with a wedge salad and it was pretty pitiful. The lettuce portion was maybe the size of the palm of my hand. A little dressing was drizzled on and they basically tossed a pinch of onion and tomato on and called it a day. For my main course I ordered the balsamic chicken. I assumed Id get a chunk of chicken breast. Nope. I got two little chicken medallions and WAY too much balsamic sauce. They try to distract from the small chicken portion by tossing a ton of fried onion strings on top of it. The guy next to me ordered the bruchetta and it was pretty pitiful as well. It was 5 giant squares of bread with a teaspoon of topping on each. He had to ask for additional topping and oil. The topping to bread ratio was not even. This is definitely not a place Id choose to ever go for food. Maybe Id consider grabbing a drink and watching a game but that would be the extent of a return visit here.
Morgan G.,"Addison, TX",325,66,140,1.0,1/4/2014,"Just went here and ordered salmon off the gluten free menu. It came with a lemon sauce. I asked if it was gluten free and was told yes... The girl told me it was fine for me.  I am now reacting. I called and was passed to the kitchen, I asked the guy and he said, ""no, it's not gluten free because it has butter in it..."" I say, butter doesn't have gluten in it..."" Silence. He tells me he's getting the kitchen manager. A few mins later I'm taken off hold only to hear two women talking in the background... ""You have to talk to her,"" ""I don't want to, she's going to be pissed."" This goes back and forth then a guy with a thick Hispanic accent comes on the phone and explains there is a lot of flour in the sauce...there's nothing he can do but tell me the ingredients, so I hang up. My boyfriend calls back only to be on hold for over 10 minutes. He is on his way there now. This is SO IRRESPONSIBLE. They have an entire area dedicated to gluten free cooking and THIS is what we get.  Oh PS, our waitress had already double checked to make sure the cider I had was gluten free...she was well aware."
Renee C.,"Dallas, TX",787,187,276,3.0,4/20/2012,"I came in here for a super light meal. And by super light, I mean I just ordered their stuff mushrooms and a water (didn't plan on having alcohol that night) - probably a server's worst nightmare knowing my tab was going to be so small. Oh, well... Stuffed mushrooms were delish! The order came with 6 small mushrooms drizzled with some sort of pesto sauce. Mine barely came with any, so I had to ask for an extra side of it because it tasted so good. Service was pretty slow and inattentive, by the way. I just don't think it's necessary for me to turn my head side to side and eyeball hunt for my server to fill my water which has been left empty for an X amount of long minutes. It wasn't even busy. It was 11PM on a Thursday night. Aside from the food and service, I have always liked the ambience of BJ's. This was my first experience at this particular restaurant, and I've been to a few other locations. The look and feel have always been the same. Their large TVs illuminate the whole restaurant making the environment feel alive. That is always a plus."
Kelly R.,"Little Elm, TX",0,2,,1.0,6/11/2016,"Terrible service-terrible service-lettuce floating in beer-forgot appetizer-Millennials are going to be the death of me, they don't understand service. Guess that's why the bar was empty at 7:00pm on a Saturday night. Oh they brought the appetizer out last then charged me for it. Used to like coming here-good pizza and beer, deff going to shit"
James B.,"Firth, NE",0,26,3,5.0,11/12/2014,Stopped for supper. Had the bacon double cheese burger which was great. Brew selection and taste was great.  Cost was actually cheaper than I expected for such a nice restaurant.  Highly recommended.
Michael P.,"Dallas, TX",1,22,31,1.0,8/28/2015,"Service is horrendous!  Complained to the manager and he tried to help, but the damage was done.  Orders were mixed up, food and drinks took forever, drinks were not refilled.  Food was good, but I won't come back here again!"
ViJay K.,"Addison, Dallas, TX",488,513,3836,3.0,7/13/2012,"They usually been consistent with good food and service. Lunch and dinner. They serve a lot of people and have it down.  Lately the service has been lacking.  Not as attentive and slower even when it's not busy.  I know it's not an off day for the server as it's happened a few times now.  The pizza is really good.  I love the sandwiches, baked potato and soups too.  You can order off the lunch menu all day.  Don't waste your taste buds or dollars on the steak.  Not impressive.  Looks like it came from Luby's or Furr's.  This used to be the go to place..."
Wayne L.,"Nashua, NH",17,94,3,4.0,6/1/2014,Good food  a great staff and a excellent selection of beers on tap.  The pizza and seafood dishes are excellent
