John S.,"Merced, CA",0,7,,1.0,8/9/2015,"Called does not deliver, even though the site says it does. Hate wasting my time calling places to ask for delivery that list a delivery service only to have the employees tell me they don't deliver."
D B.,"Little Elm, TX",7,26,2,5.0,4/4/2016,This is our go-to place when we can't decide what to eat or if everyone wants something different. The new appetizers are really great. The Brussel Sprouts are a must get!!!  I had the pink Cadillac to drink and it was fabulous. Everyone had different entrees and they were all great. The TVs are everywhere so a great place to be when sports are on!!!
Tiffani C.,"Plano, TX",12,13,,4.0,6/3/2014,"I am only giving BJ's 4 stars. I usually enjoy sitting at their bar with a blonde beer in my hand, chowing on some pizza and going into sports overload when I try to watch all the sports games going on at one time.  However comma tonight you all ruined it. It was a Tuesday night and my best friend had been in the hospital all day following surgery. I was tired and wanted a salad to go and a beer while they made my food. BJ's menu describes their ""Cobb Salad"" as, ""Romaine and iceberg lettuce, roasted turkey, Applewood smoked bacon, feta cheese, tomatoes and avocado tossed with creamy garlic dressing and oven baked seasoned croutons."" Ha. First off, the salad I had, I'm not even sure it had romaine lettuce and I'm positive the ""roasted turkey"" was nothing short of a poor quality lunch meat. I found 3 small pieces of feta and the avocado was brown and borderline bad. Oh, and no croutons.  I'm sure I will continue to come back as a  dine-in only patron. This was my first and last time to order something to go. There is no defending this other than maybe it was the ""Tuesday Night Cooks.""  Next time, I'll go to McDonalds and pay half the price for a salad that probably tastes better. If management actually pays attention to these, please be happy to reach out to me and I will be happy to send you a photo of the garbage your kitchen put out."
Jeff H.,"Murphy, TX",69,105,115,5.0,4/7/2014,"Love the deep dish pepperoni pizza here.  And even though I am not a dessert person really, I never come here without getting a p'zookie. It doesn't matter which kind of cookie you get. They're all good. You can even get a combo to try more than one. The ice cream on top is a great combination to the delicious cookie.  The beer selection here is also very well rounded. From micro brews to craft beers to all the domestic and import staples. My all time favorite beer is Chimay - Red and this is one of the few places that carry it."
Dave B.,"Sacramento, CA",15,16,4,2.0,11/21/2014,"I wish this wouldn't have happened because I love bj brewhouse, what I would have liked to have seen was some better customer service. The manager and his team are not committed to a good customer experience.  Service was terrible and the food was sub par. I would not recommend this particular bjs to anyone."
Stephanie D.,"Dallas, TX",12,23,24,2.0,6/3/2015,"I have visited this specific location a few times and have never had any issues until last night. :/ My girlfriend and I decided to stop in and have dinner her last night and had a not so pleasant experience.  We got seated promptly and our server came over and took our drink order, that part was okay.  It was when the food came out when we started having problems. We started with a order of Calamari which for $10 you would expect a bigger portion than what was presented to us but, we overlooked that and continued with our dinner.  My girlfriend ordered the  North Beach Mahi-Mahi and Shrimp dinner and I ordered the Garlic Chicken Pesto Tavern-Cut Pizza.  Now this is where the issues started. Our food came out and we began eating.  The Mahi-Mahi and Shrimp dinner my girlfriend ordered came out looking more like a soup.  She kind of gave it a face but didn't want to bother with sending it back so she started eating it.  The Mahi-Mahi was so overcooked it was almost a tough texture to chew and the Shrimp did not taste fresh at all.  Now at this point we decided to flag down the waiter and tell him our issue and return the dish.  The waiter understood took her dish back and let her order another dish (Seared Tuna salad) which she was pleased with when it arrived.  On to my dish, the Garlic Chicken Pesto pizza.  I started eating my first slice, no problem it was great.  Then I got to another slice...there happened to be CELERY on my pizza which totally threw me off mainly because I REALLY don't like celery!  I thought it was a fluke accident but as I examined my pizza more I continued to find more celery on the pizza.  At this point, I really didn't have much of an appetite left anyways so I just let it go.  I did ask the waiter when he came back by if celery should have been on the pizza because the menu didn't state this and he himself looked at the menu and didn't see any mention of the celery.  He did offer to have it remade but, at this point we were done eating and ready to go home.  I boxed up the remainder of the pizza (basically the whole pizza because I only ate two slices) and we paid our tab and left.  He attempted to say the celery was from the Pesto but I knew better than that.  All in all, the staff was great and very accommodating.  The food however this go round...not so great.  I feel like it was a waste of spent money last night for something we didn't really enjoy."
Rayce W.,"Nashville, TN",0,17,1,2.0,5/25/2015,This place is basically Chili's with a brewery. Food isn't bad and their in-house beers are pretty good. It took forever to get our food. Be sure to bring a jacket though because this place is freezing. We politely complained to our waiter about the air twice only to have the ac still blowing arctic winds down our necks.
Jennifer H.,"Dallas, TX",22,38,9,1.0,12/11/2014,I barely go to this restaurant but one day my partner and I decided to go somewhere different for a change. I decided to order an appetizer chips and salsa found a piece of hair  on the plate. I was so disgusted and I spoke with the manager she offered me a free meal but I just decided to leave.
Anne A.,"Dallas, TX",150,224,136,1.0,2/23/2015,"I used to love coming in here and they had one of the best pizzas around. I guess they changed their pizza recipe to very lightly sauce, as you can see in my pic it looks like no sauce at all. This makes the pizza very dry and hard to eat with the thick bread..even though the bread is delicious. I don't think I'll be having a craving for their pizza any time soon. When we were seated, it took over 15 minutes until we grabbed a waiter and had him take our order. He did  apologize and said that they were busy and that our waitress will be back to take our food order. He came back later to check if she did her job, and found that she didn't, so he adopted our table. I realize you have your busy days, but when it takes 2 hours to turn over a table you may need to consider better training or getting rid of that waitress who never came over. On the other hand their pazzookies are amazing as always!"
Rae C.,"Fort Worth, TX",92,308,31,4.0,8/7/2013,"BJ's is really good at being consistent at all of their locations. For a chain restaurant, I think it's pretty damn awesome. For starters, they have a wide variety of their own beers which are all tasty and delicious. They have a pretty rockin' happy hour that includes half-off mini pizzas. I don't know who decided to call them ""mini"" because they are definitely big enough to share. And if you don't want their beers, they have a bunch of other tasty stuff on tap! They have one of those insane, Cheesecake Factory style menus that has a bazillion choices. I have no idea how these places manage to make so many different things well, but I always like the food I get. The avocado spring rolls, the angel hair pasta, the tomato soup, the pizzas, and most recently their mac & cheese have ALL been good!  Speaking of the mac & cheese, I'm loving this new small bites menu they have. It's always enough food for lunch but they are each under $5. The fried artichoke is a particular favorite of mine. Yuuumm. They are also super patient with my picky, making-substitutions, changing-everything-up ass. However, unless you sit at the bar (and I mean directly at the bar, not just in the area), expect the service to be a little slow. I've never seen a BJ's waiter look like they were in too big of a hurry, but it's always worth the wait."
Steven M.,"Collinsville, TX",6,4,,1.0,5/29/2015,Arrived at 5:45 on a Friday. Was seated immediately. Waited 15 minutes and still no waiter so we walked out.  Can not comment on food since we were unable to order anything. The pictures on the menu looked good though.
Charis S.,"Plano, TX",474,247,470,4.0,1/7/2014,"For starters, I had a glass of Chardonnay and a bowl of tortilla soup, which was delicious.  Very plentiful and savory, good chunks of chicken and tortilla chips, a good, thick broth, I enjoyed it very much!"
Kate R.,"Dallas, TX",80,421,62,3.0,8/30/2011,"Boy, I come here a lot. Oops? Anyway, R and I stopped in here before going to see Fright Night last Saturday (really good movie, btw: go see it. If you're a geek like us, you'll laugh as much as we did).  BJ's advertises they now have Whole Wheat pizza crust. I asked our waiter about it and he was honest. I appreciate that. He said that he prefers the regular crust... but he'll eat the whole wheat one when he orders the Veggie pizza (it's standard on the Veggie pizza and optional on all the others). It's like when people just prefer white or wheat bread for their sandwiches.  I thought I'd try it. Why not? I just got a mini cheese pizza (sans tomatoes) on the Whole Wheat Crust. It wasn't bad. It didn't have an overpowering/gross whole wheat flavor to it (as some whole wheat crusts or pasta are wont to do), and was decent overall. Later, my stomach was sad. Seeing as this was the only thing I had really eaten that was out of the norm for me, it had to be the whole wheat crust. BJ's and I apparently go back and forth on what's going to upset my belly.  R ordered some wedge fries to munch on before her mini (extra cheese, no tomatoes) pizza came out. The fries took forever to arrive and weren't terribly fresh when they did. The place was kind of busy (at about 530 on a Saturday) but not so busy that we expected old fries.  Overall, I know we'll be back: It's on the R-approved foods list, which is short. The whole wheat crust is worth trying, but I'll probably avoid it in the future since it appeared to not agree with me too much. Oh well. Maybe I'll give it another chance!"
Rebecca B.,"Addison, Dallas, TX",1172,146,42,2.0,3/29/2013,"Um...I've been to this BJ's about 7 times, and this is an ""overall"" critique.  The food always sounds better than it really is.  The drinks are better if you sit in the bar area. This particular time, my mojitos were weak, the waiter forgot my aoili, the toppings on my pizza weren't cooked, but the bottom of my pizza was burned.  Overall, it seems that an important person somewhere at the top just doesn't care enough about the details.  There's a lot of potential, but something isn't working."
Lily M.,"Dallas, TX",573,839,1171,3.0,1/3/2012,"I came here for lunch the other day.  I had the avocado egg rolls for an appetizer and they were ok.  I love avocado, but I felt that the rolls had an overwhelming amount of avocado for me without enough flavor to enjoy, so I wouldn't want to order this again. They have a lunch special menu and I decided on the half grilled chicken pesto flatbread pizza & salad option.  The pizza/salad combo was just enough for one person and the it was good.  I have nothing to brag about from BJ's, so I do plan to go back again to try some of their menu items, since they have so many."
Daisy C.,"Dallas, TX",69,348,10,2.0,12/21/2011,"Their Happy Hour mixed drinks are $1 off, but they should be free because they SUCK.  The mojito tasted like they forgot the simple syrup, the lime juice (lime garnish doesn't cut it),...and the rum!!  I may as well have ordered a club soda with two mint leaves in it.  And the mint is supposed to be muddled! The margarita tasted like margarita mix on ice, and it probably was because I tasted no tequila, and it was exactly the same color as the mix that we buy at the store. The flatbread was good for half price at happy hour, but crappy drinks...?!  That ruins the whole point of happy hour!"
Angel S.,"Carrollton, TX",17,12,3,4.0,10/29/2013,"usually not a fan of chain restaurants , but BJ's is an exception. I have been to the location in Addison twice for lunch and both times was greeted by a pleasant hostess and served by  a cheerful waitress by the name of ""Planet"". The two times I have been there I have also noticed other repeat patrons. Obviously the place draws regulars. Planet was attentive and helpful, recommending the Santa Fe salad which was delicious. Ive also had the tomato bisque both times. Tastes more like a bisque as opposed to the normal canned tomotoe soup you tend to get at restaurants.  The Menu is diverse, so much to choose from. Even for picky eaters like my high maintence four year old. I recommend the BBq chicken pizza , avocado rolls, calamari and pot stickers as well. Def plan on frequenting this place!!"
Andrew H.,"Irving, TX",57,8,,1.0,6/28/2015,This place sucked. I walked in for take out as a new customer. The people were nice but the food sucked. I asked for a rack of ribs clearly and never received it. The food I did receive that I did order was just not fresh. I felt like crap after eating the food. The worst part was how expensive the food is. I will not ever go back.
Dean T.,"Columbia, MD",0,47,1,2.0,9/18/2013,"Too bad we can't give half stars. I would have like to give this place 2.5 stars.  I didn't have anything extraordinary. I had chips/salsa as an appetizer and the chicken fried steak for my entree.  The chips were unbelievably salty. I don't mind salty food, but these were even too salty for me.  The chicken fried steak wasn't especially good. It was soggy and the steak itself was bland.  The white cheddar mashed potatoes were good as were the fries. The service was a bit slow and my appetizer came out with my entree. (A big no-no) And lastly, this is mind numbing. Why would you stock the place full of 60"" HD TV's and then have them all playing standard definition (analog) stretched stations? This is just head scratching."
Meghan E.,"Allen, TX",4,137,2,3.0,2/25/2015,"Eh so so. Was coming here often, but then they pulled some things off the menu, and everything else I just wasn't impressed with. It is good for a quick bite at lunch. I've never been for dinner because it's just not a place that crosses my mind that I  have to go back to. Service is always quick and good, but the food is just ehhh.. like I said so so. Not so impressed by it."
