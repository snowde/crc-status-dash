Amy B.,"Dallas, TX",322,672,474,3.0,11/11/2011,"2nd time here and it was fine. Friendly staff, but drink orders took a while to get to the table, and all the food was delivered backwards. For instance, the appetizer came 3 seconds (literally) before the entrees. My salad came 4 minutes after my entree. Maybe it's their secret plan to get you to drink more beer prior to eating.... Whatever the reason may be, my friend (self-proclaimed beer connoisseur) ordered a flight of their beer and he thought they were great. The food was pretty good. We all ordered sandwiches/burgers. The California Burger was really greasy and on garlic bread (weird?) but I still ate it so I can't complain too much."
Reza P.,"Dallas, TX",8,7,,5.0,7/14/2015,"I take my clients to this place almost every week.  Great environment to take your clients to, decent service, and the noise is manageable when talking business with your audience.  Their burgers are awesome.  Would recommend this place if you haven't been here before."
Merlinda I.,"Dallas, TX",171,75,100,2.0,3/15/2013,"BJ's was a staple in college, as one of the few feasible date restaurants in Norman, OK. This is where I fell in love with the avocado eggrolls and Jambalaya, which I've also had at the Lewisville location and it was just as fantastic, but didn't get it on this occasion. We stopped in with a party of 3 at 9pm on a Thursday for a late meal and the hostess mentioned that happy hour was going on in the bar ($2 off apps and $1 off drafts/cocktails), so we gladly steered ourselves to the last empty table. Our waitress took slightly longer than the time it took each of us going to the bathroom separately to greet us and then I think immediately wrote us off when only 1 out of 3 ordered alcohol. Apps: Cheese sticks - good, they were well...cheese sticks not much to say. Calamari - meh. Tuna Poke - yummmmyyyyyy! mmmmm! Cup of clam chowder - could be from a can but it was one of the best clam chowders I've had in a while, definitely recommend. Mains: Deep Dish Jalapeno and Pepperoni Pizza - we usually go for BBQ chicken pizza here, but this was highly undercooked and just not delicious at this location on this particular night. I've never not loved their pizza so this was highly disappointing. Turkey club - didn't try it but it got the thumbs up. The server who brought our apps was awesome and clearly excited to be there, our waitress hated us and only came to our table if we specifically called her over. With all of the options on the ever so populated Beltline road, more misses than hits will cause us to not return to this location."
Robert L.,"New York, NY",213,209,153,2.0,2/12/2013,"BJ's... one word, at any BJ's, anywhere, Pazookie! So I've always wondered what brings me back to BJ's time after time.  So I decided to write a Yelp review to help me organize my thoughts. It's not the salads... it's not the soup... it's not the entrees... it's not the pizzas... it's not the appetizers... albeit the Avocado Egg Rolls aren't bad.  OH I KNOW!  One word, ""Pazookie!""  Anyone who's been to BJ's and had a pazookie knows what I'm talking about.  BJ's is never one of those places you'll find yourself craving at random times.  It's one of those places you drive by and say to yourself, ""hot damn... pazookie would hit the spot right about now,"" and no matter what you do, images of soft fresh baked cookie dough topped with ice cream will be running circles in your mind till you satiate that hunger with a pizookie party platter, which comes with all the flavors BJ's offers and is large enough to serve 5! One last thing, maybe it was just the day I was there, but the floor felt rather oily.  If you're ever feeling the need to bust a solid moonwalk, this would be the place."
Roger H.,"Frisco, TX",5,12,,1.0,7/3/2013,"This is our first time to the BJs chain. Granted there was an event for the forth that may have slowed service, but the service was not the issue. When finally the food came out, our party was sadly disappointed.  Our son ~5 had pizza that smelt like Pam cooking spray. My wife's salad was okay. I had Mahi Mahi tacos, that looked like they had been under a heat lamp for 1/2 plus hour.  Our friends had the chicken sandwich,  which came out cold, potato wedges were ok. And he had the double patty hamburger with bacon plain. It came out with fixings and cheese. By far this is the worst food experience I have had in a long time.  Wish we went to Taco Diner next door."
Miranda F.,"Richardson, TX",188,12,7,1.0,4/7/2015,"I used to be a fan of BJ's...before I worked there. Most of the food is microwaved or dumped directly from a bag to a pan under a heat lamp. The pizza is decent but way over priced. The kitchen takes forever to make anything you order. The dishwashing process is disgusting, to say the least. When I worked there I refused to use anything but the to-go cups and utensils. Maybe other locations would be better, but I'll never eat at a BJ's again."
Shams B.,"Richardson, TX",65,513,80,3.0,1/14/2014,"I hadn't been to one of these places in a while, and while I had a great server I didn't think the food was as good as I remember it being (for a chain restaurant). I had a crispy jalapeno burger and it was exactly what I would've expected from a Fridays, Chili's, etc. No better, no worse."
Pam C.,"Dallas, TX",26,21,42,1.0,8/6/2014,Poor food quality.  We have always been BJ fans but not here. Mahi overcooked.  Rice was either frozen and reheated or overcooked. Mushy. No flavor. Chicken pasta was bland. Sauce tasted like something out of a jar.
Hessam R.,"Dallas, TX",17,115,62,4.0,1/3/2015,"My steak was awesome, but pizza was salty. Wait time was long but we were a large party and it was expected for a Saturday night."
Patrick S.,"Miami Beach, FL",8,42,19,2.0,1/14/2015,Service was great but the food was sub par.  Not worth the risk to try it.  Go only if you want beer.  Too bad
Brooke R.,"Austin, TX",174,194,9,2.0,9/13/2013,"God, I'm high maintenance.  I get so sad when a friend suggests a boring chain ""casual cool"" restaurant for dinner.   I live in freaking DFW, a Mecca of wonderful places *I'm looking at you Whiskey Cake, Libertine, Stephen Pyle's, Kenny's Woodfire Grill* .....and we go to BJ's??  Anyways, it was, you know a BJ's. You basically know what to expect when go. The food tasted mass produced, because it is.  To their credit, our server was friendly and prompt.  I had Chianti and some Parmesan chicken thing, and everything was edible.  WAIT! I did inhale a Macadamia Nut Pizookie.  Jesus H. Christ. It was worth the calories and better than the soufflé I had at the freaking French Room, which is odd!"
Rasesh P.,"Irving, TX",3,57,2,3.0,8/21/2014,"Been to this place few times now and being vegetarian I thing they have one of the best veggie patty burgers in town..They will substitute veggie patty(black bean) with any burger of your choice..not a fan of their deep dish pizza though...I have tried deep dish pizza few times and mine never looks like the one in their menu....over all its more lively, a bit noisy place...just like yelp A-OK"
Dirk N.,"Dallas, TX",0,637,144,5.0,8/28/2011,"BJ's is awesome, but the service can be iffy depending on the location you go to. We graced this location at the start of our honeymoon. I got my go-to choice at BJ's: The Buffalo Chicken Pizza. It was great as usual. My wife chose some chicken and tomato angel hair pasta dish and it was one of the few meals we've had at BJ's that we weren't very impressed with. For dessert, we got a free Pizookie after the server found out it was our honeymoon. It was awesome as usual."
Susan T.,"Dallas, TX",35,2,,1.0,2/14/2016,"The restaurant and the service were awesome.  The Shepard Pie is awful.  If you like half cook onions, it the dish for you.  Every fork full was onions.  The dish may have been good but will never know.  This is the 2nd try at BJ's and it will not be a 3rd if I have to choose a restaurant.  Such a beautiful place that had awful food."
Penny G.,"Dallas, TX",0,1,,5.0,2/11/2016,Every single item I've ordered from BJ's has been terrific. It is truly one of my favorite places to eat.
Meg S.,"Houston, TX",109,168,73,3.0,10/30/2013,"This place was fine and dandy, nothing out of the ordinary to report either good or bad. Parking is out of control though. You'll see on my check in that I had to walk quite a ways from the north 40 to get to the restaurant.  We had part of the back room sectioned off for us for a training. The servers seemed a little put out by us and after they brought our food, we never saw them again. The food was solid. Again, what you'd expect from any BJ's. Next time, I need to get a pazookie!"
Austin S.,"Dallas, TX",52,11,,4.0,3/18/2013,"The atmosphere here is pretty good. The music is at a good volume, and everyone appears to be enjoying themselves. I came for lunch on a Tuesday and about 75% of the inside tables were taken.  The service left a bit to be desired.  Both myself and my companion have been or are currently waiters, so we understand what good service is and how difficult it can be to exceed expectations.  But with that said, the service was not impressive.  It took about three minutes to be greeted by my waiter and another five minutes to receive water. If it is on the menu, I always feel personally obligated to get the fish and chips.  The ubiquitous British dish did not disappoint.  I opted for the shoestring fries, which were well seasoned (if a little on the greasy side).  The fish was moist inside and crispy outside, and seemed designed to pair well with malt vinegar.  I would certainly consider getting it again.  Overall, it was a reasonably good experience, and I'm sure I will be back."
James J.,"Richardson, TX",0,6,,2.0,8/15/2015,Well the service sucked.  The manager was worse.  It took well over 40 minutes for our food to arrive.  We spoke to the manager and all she said was it normally takes 20 minutes for the food to come out.  It took sooooo long our friends had to cancel their order. All the manager said was I hope you come back. Well we won't ever come back. We told waitress prior to ordering that we were in a slight rush and she understood.  Like I said we won't ever come back!!!!!!
Giordan C.,"Dallas, TX",69,53,14,3.0,7/29/2014,"So me and a group of friends went here to use a buy one get on free coupon. It was a slow night not really packed at all. So it takes a lil bit to get greeted but no biggie. He takes our orders nothing difficult get a mushroom app and lemonades, we also ordered our meals too we got pizza and a pasta.  So 15 minutes later not in a big rush for the app but once 25 minutes passed we started to ask what was going on the response was"" it should be coming out now"" 5-10 minutes it finally comes out. It was good but not worth that long wait. Then the pizza and pasta came out about 15-20 after that, which I can't understand since I know it doesn't take that long. And then to top it off the pasta wasn't even hot.  So of course we ask for a manger and tell her what happened she tells us sorry and she doesn't know why that happened. Really wasn't too helpful at all. Then when the waiter comes back he tells us it's her last day on the job, so her attitude and unwillingness to help made sense. At the end of the day she took an item off our bill which really didn't matter since they knew we had the coupon. Not too happy about the situation. Bottom line for her to be a manager her customer service should have been much better. Maybe things have changed since she has left not sure I'll find out tho."
Autumn S.,"Denton, TX",30,108,232,5.0,10/25/2012,"One of my fav places to eat, large variety on the menu and large proportions. I've tried a lot of things here and never had any complaints. Good dessert choices as well. Laid back atmosphere."
