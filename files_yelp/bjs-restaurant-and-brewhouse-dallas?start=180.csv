Miranda J.,"Frisco, TX",84,151,27,4.0,11/16/2012,"Have the Pumpkin Ale...it's delish!! I've been to this location several times and have never left dissapointed. Great pizza, great beer, and a great selection. The one and only complaint I have about this place is the service is often slow regardless of how many people are dining. But, it is a pretty darn big building and I've seen how spread out sections can be. All in all, a great place for lunch and dinner!"
Keita H.,"North Wilkesboro, NC",98,11,,2.0,5/22/2014,"I went to BJ's on Tuesday May 20, 2014. I was really excited to go to BJs since everyone was saying this was the place to go to. I first ordered a glass of Malbec that was brought to me in a lipstick stain wine glass that I had to send back. I then decided to try the deep dish vegetarian pizza since this was one of their specialties. However, I was very disappointed. My food came out cold and the pizza was not good at all. I will not be returning to BJs anytime soon."
Tonya S.,"Addison, TX",22,43,11,1.0,2/20/2013,"Awful. Awful. Just awful.  Over fried, dried-out, stale food. Bad service (lady with short dark hair). Horrible lemon martini. Don't spend your hard-earned money here."
Arthur C.,"Farmer's Branch, Dallas, TX",6,20,31,4.0,9/13/2013,"I've been to BJ's a few times already, and I've found this place well above average. You'll get decent food, beer, sports, and a decent service; I don't know about you guys.  Pizza, burgers, even the Jambalaya is pretty good here too. The avocado egg rolls are to die for, and I'm also amazed how a glass of Jeremiah Red pairs really well with a pulled pork sandwich. So, if I had a choice between Boston's, or BJ's, I recommend this place. ;)"
Eddie C.,"Dallas, TX",9,4,2,4.0,12/3/2014,Servers were cool we watch the Mavericks double o.t. Mavs over Bulls 129-127. Food was okay. My friend ate pasta Parmesan
Scott D.,"Columbia, MD",0,6,,5.0,1/20/2016,"Had an incredible time at BJ's in Addison tonight because of our bartender Tara. She was unbelievably kind, attentive, and thoughtful. She went the extra mile to make sure that we were enjoying ourselves! Our food was delicious as always, but she really made an impression that I had not previously experienced at this location before. Go tip her well!"
Sameer M.,"Dallas, TX",280,358,14,2.0,2/22/2013,"I hate to give this a two star review but I cannot see how it can be any better. The service was excellent. The calamari was gross. It was frozen overlooked and poorly breaded. The Piranha  pale ale was weak. Like Natty light weak. The deep dish, which is more pan style than deep dish was mediocre.  The highlight was the pizzokie. It really doesn't get better than that."
Grant D.,"Garland, TX",16,7,3,1.0,4/24/2014,"Got food poisoning from the artichokes on the pizza.  When I asked the manager for a refund or a gift card he refused.  I would not call that a good example of customer service.  You've been warned, do not eat the pizza.  Eat at your own risk."
Brooks H.,"Dallas, TX",9,40,31,2.0,5/3/2014,"This place is massive. The menu is massive. If you're massive and want to get massiver, come on in. May I suggest a generic appetizer to go with your overpriced novelty drink & 90s top hits musical experience? Try the dick-avocado fried rolls."
Sarah R.,"Rowlett, TX",31,29,49,2.0,12/23/2014,"Was not impressed with the food, especially considering the prices. We called ahead and the manager who answered was very unhelpful and said we would need to go online (we were 5 min away) my gluten free pizza was over priced and tasted like a microwave meal. My friends lunch pasta was watery and she couldn't finish it. I am not one to knock on restaurants but I will not be coming back here. One positive, the hostess was bright eyed and friendly! Despite our conversation with the manager, she was looking out for us."
Chris H.,Hong Kong,173,602,2109,1.0,1/19/2010,"My own personal hell that is chain restaurants on Beltline, exhibit A:  BJ's restaurant (NASDAQ: BJRI)* Upon ordering, I couldn't help but be skeptical of my pending blackened chicken sandwich.  At $10 for the entree plus a side of fries, it would either be an extraordinary deal, or a plate of pure stodge.   Unfortunately, it was the latter - the blackened chicken was depressingly insipid with no discernible level of spice.  The pounded out bit of poultry protein sat underneath a mound of yellow-ish iceberg lettuce (iceberg lettuce should not be meant for human consumption) and two greasy slices of bread. The side of fries were simultaneously soggy and mealy.  Speaking from experience, it takes an extraordinary amount of apathy in the kitchen to produce fries of this flaccidity. For what it is, there's not much else that I can grouse on.  It's mediocre chain food at reasonable prices.  Case closed. *  I find it perverse and amusing to eat at restaurants that are publicly traded."
Bill B.,"Dallas, TX",102,580,1772,3.0,4/23/2013,"BJ's is the type of restaurant you need to be prepared to spend some time from the time you enter until you leave. You will start with one of the largest most complex menus anywhere at this type of a restaurant. There were approximately 26 pages, more or less. Finding the page from which to decide was the first challenge and then finding the item on that age was the second challenge. I have no ideal how they manage to keep all of those products fresh and ready to serve. There are dozens and dozens of entrees. When I commented about this to the waiter he replied, I agree and about like the Cheesecake Factory. Well after several minutes of reviewing and getting over the initial shock our group attempted to regroup and place an order. By the way the prices are not inexpensive at this place so expect to pay a little more for what you get. I ordered the chicken fried steak which came with a side order. The steak was rather small fro the price ($13.50). In fact I had one a few days later that was two to three times larger for about $4 less. Go figure! While the steak was good there was nothing about it that one could say it was outstanding or fantastic. Another in out party had the Parmesan Chicken and they liked it very much. The service was good bot no more than just good. You know at exactly the 15%  tip level. I like this place and will, eventually get used to the menu and prices."
John S.,"Anchorage, AK",382,276,685,4.0,7/20/2010,"Superb pizza and menu overall. The interior is huge, lots of Panasonic plasma TVs for sports, cool decor, and a huge, varied menu. And what chain has hardwood floors throughout? This location does... My kids loved this place too. Excellent fun folder with crayons."
Chris L.,"Dallas, TX",194,878,245,3.0,8/22/2010,"Our family visited yesterday since my folks were in town. It was all our first time there. Ambiance The dining area is huge. There are lots of tables but it's definitely bustling during peak weekend hours. It has a familiar sports bar type environment. The dining area is open air. There aren't that many walls or dividers. You can typically see one end to the other. It's very family friendly and warm and inviting. Service  The service was alright. Nothing impressive. The waitress was friendly and was attentive despite the busy hours. The wait staff and the backend kept up with orders. I would definately recommend the call ahead process. The wait time on saturday at 7:30pm was 30 minutes. I thought she was joking but she was serious. We called ahead and my family only waited 10 minutes. This was during a preseason cowboy's game as well.  Food The menu is a potpourri of many many things. Almost too many things. My concern is the large menu would mean lower quality in food and taste. The waitress recommended the pizza. It seems like they specialize in their pizza. Our family ordered various items: Capresi salad, Gourmet Mac & Cheese, Thin Pizza, Chicken Fried Steak, and the Fried Chicken Fingers and an individual pizza.  The food quality was alright but nothing spectacular; maybe above average. The food doesn't taste fresh; it seems like it was probably mostly frozen food.  Prices Prices were moderate. The portions are generous for certain plates. Especially the chicken fried steak.  Misc/Takeout Seems like the restaurant chain also provides takeout. We didn't actually order takeout."
Jared C.,"Euless, TX",5,13,67,4.0,12/7/2010,"BJ's has always been a favorite. Ever since I tried their slow roasted BBQ pulled pork sammich, I've been coming back for more and more. The menu at BJ's is comparable to a Cheesecake Factory experience. Pages and pages of menu items to choose from and plenty of desserts to accommodate that after-dinner appetite. You won't want to pass up BJ's Famous Pizookie. It's a freshly baked medium sized cookie topped with a couple scoops of vanilla bean ice cream. You can choose from chocolate chunk, white chocolate macadamia nut, peanut butter or oatmeal raisin walnut. They also have a Pizookie Trio where you can mix and match the cookie bottoms. All of their salads are delish but definitely try the BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad topped with a special BBQ ranch dressing. Mmmm so good. Plenty of tables in the restaurant. Depending on when you come, it seems they usually seat couples in booths on the outer edge, which is nice because you have your own private area to spread out and take in everything that's going on. They have tons of TVs (see Champps) to catch a few glimpses of the game. It's not uncommon for this location to get very busy on a Friday or Saturday night."
Joe P.,"Dallas, TX",1123,26,31,4.0,1/3/2013,"Best Turkey Burger (except for Prime Bar) in Dallas. This is delicious food.  Management needs to be re-trained, two servers need to be allowed to find other less demanding work, the rest would be much better with some simple training. Thus they lost a star to poor service three out of six visits over two years."
Scott M.,"Stamford, CT",226,181,96,3.0,11/16/2009,"Last couple of visits to BJ's Restaurant were with a group of over 20 people (gotta love birthdays with Pizookies).  As far as I can tell this is a good test of service, seeing how far they'll go to earn their tips - especially if 18% is already included in the bill.  I'm personally not wild about that but if they earn it, fine. I have mixed feelings overall about this restaurant.  Usually the service is good although the last visit seemed to be a bit slower.  I won't hold that against any of the servers since it was busy for a Thursday evening and they have no control over the speed of the food prep.  Drinks, maybe.  Much of the food here is pretty good although some isn't too impressive.  As others have mentioned, a lot of items are pricey here. The pot roast did not come out of a crock pot here and there were a lot of bites with gristle in them - just average, nothing more.  Personally I'm not crazy about any of the deep dish pizza here.  Maybe it's my preference for thin crust, but I did like the flatbread appetizer pizza with italian sausage.  The chicken potstickers are also worth a try but it's advisable to go easy on the sauce unless you love it salty.  The Santa Fe salad with grilled salmon has the highest marks so far.  It's also a good choice for whoever also wants to enjoy an appetizer or dessert without ballooning out of their normal shape.  The salads were amply sized, the veggies were fresh and the salmon didn't have a lot of unnecessary seasoning - just simple and good. For anyone who hasn't tried a pizookie, it isn't a bad idea to split this diabetic nightmare with a friend as it can get filling pretty quick.  Also, there are some out there that might get turned off by the gooey, almost underdone texture (in the middle) - and of course there's ice cream on top of that.  If that's not a problem it's definitely better than some dry birthday cake."
Rakesh S.,"Plano, TX",1,22,,5.0,7/9/2015,"A NON-SMOKING place in Addison that's quiet with minimal wait times, a ginormous menu with something for everybody, pizookies and solid brews.  I hit the like button."
Michael B.,"Addison, TX",1,10,,4.0,8/6/2014,"Great place to hang out with family & friends. Varied menu, good selection of craft beers, various brews & wine, full bar. Ample seating. Food is tasty. Several styles of pizza. Lots of entrees & sandwiches too. Signature dessert is the pizookie: a large freshly baked cookie topped with ice cream. Worth a try."
Deepak J.,"Irving, TX",0,6,,1.0,8/2/2015,Extremely slow service. Was waiting for more than 20 mins for someone to attend to us. Even asked the front desk but that didn't help either. Eventually left without being helped for water or food.
