Jessica M.,"Oklahoma City, OK",302,206,548,5.0,11/11/2009,I just love their personal deep dish pizza and double chocolate pizookie. sometimes I swing by all alone just to eat one and I don't care!
Emma G.,"Dallas, TX",106,82,,4.0,2/14/2011,"Gosh, this name reverts my maturity level right back to around the age of 12. Whoops. People get realllllly confused when I say ""what about BJ's?!"" or ""BJ's would be great!"" or ""have you tried the pazooki at BJ's?"" (side note: the computer recognized ""pazooki"" as an actual term. I was totally expecting to see the red sguiqley underneath it and I didn't). Actually, the pazooki needs it's own mini paragraph. Oversized cookie, baked fresh in a massive pan, served to you IN the pan with a mountain of ice cream on top.  I'm not usually a ""chain"" type of girl, but they brew their own beer and soda, which is ALWAYS a  huge plus. On top of that, their food isn't half bad at all. I got the grilled cheese and tomato soup one rainy afternoon and it was absolutely delicious. If you're in the area and not looking to take any chances, plop down in a booth here, order an ice cold root beer (or grown-up beer) and enjoy."
Michael D.,"Anaheim, CA",14,18,2,5.0,3/1/2014,Wasn't expecting much but was surprised.  The food was good for the price our server was excellent.  I liked the wide open feeling of the dining room.
Aliyah K.,"San Antonio, TX",244,430,294,3.0,4/21/2011,"I love, adore, would walk miles for - BJ's pizza!  Now that that is out of the way, let's review.  BJ's has something for everyone, both on the food menu and drink menu. That is why it is a great place when you don't want to make an effort to find the newest, freshest, hippest place in Dallas to dine and just want to eat with friends or family, drink and be satisfied.  BJ's has fit the bill a few times during trips up to Dallas.  The food is consistent - pizzas are awesome, the spinach artichoke dip is as salty and creamy as one would expect from any American chain, the salads are a bit too picture perfect but tasty none the less, the giant stuffed potatoes are truly gigantic and the gourmet mac and cheese is friendly enough to get along with anyone (I wish there were MORE chipotle and garlic although that may turn off quite a few BJ's diners).  Service at this location is hit or miss, as many other reviewers have mentioned. Perhaps it is the 'waiter mentality' and the allure and siren song of Beltline Road lined with bars and their reverse Happy Hour and Industry Specials that make the waiters want to finish their shift and take off as soon as possible. My qualms? Slow to refill waters, slow to bring check, slow to inquire about 2nd or 3rd glasses of wine, clean set ups never being delivered - you get the picture.  BJ's has got it all figured out, food that makes you happy in an atmosphere that reminds you of something, somewhere else. I just wish the service were more consistent."
Beckitta F.,"Dallas, TX",47,78,3,3.0,2/3/2012,They have this really good mozarella and tomato salad.  Very tastey!! The pizza was better than I expected I'm not a deep-dish fan unless it's a the DJ! anyway drinks are a rip off we're in Dallas not NY!
Mia D.,"Dallas, TX",1,2,,5.0,5/4/2014,The food was amazing as always! Our server Jeff Z. was the best part of the experience even though it was a busy night he took care of us!
Candice W.,"Dallas, TX",28,19,11,2.0,2/11/2014,"Food was good, but the service was awful. Our order was wrong, the waitress spilt a glass of ice cold water all over 2 of us and one of the waitresses was a complete bitch... I will not be going back! They should have offered to buy dessert or comp an app, but they didn't even apologize for their service."
Ana S.,"Dallas, TX",54,16,4,3.0,2/13/2011,"I've always been a fan of any place that brews their own beer...come on, speciality beer and great food go hand in hand.  There really isn't any complaint about the food or drinks served here, but the service is rather spotty.  You're either lucky enough to get a great server and have a great experience or you're sh*t out of luck and it feels like you're the leaper of the group and tossed to the side, forgotten.   ....our experience there last night followed the latter.  I understand, it's restaurant row in Addison, crazy busy, long waits BUT when you do a call-ahead (45min prior to you arriving) and then when you get there you're told its a 20-30min wait ...whats the point of calling ahead??   Also, our server will NOT be receiving server of the year ...we had to wait 15 min for water...yes...water for 3 took 15min...oh and did I mention my water had a used splenda packet in the glass and it took me another 5 min to get the attention of a server (not ours mind you...he was MIA), a starter salad never came out and when we asked about it our server gave us attitute saying he put in the order and that it would come out...oh it did, after the entree was served... Great food (I love the Honey Crisp Salad), even better beer (the blonde is my fav)  BUT just don't go there on a weekend ."
Jill S.,"Zachary, LA",0,1,,5.0,4/15/2015,"Great service and awesome food. We needed to eat in a real hurry,  and we were able to order using the app and get our food shortly after sitting down. I appreciated this as an alternative to fast food."
Ryan N.,"Washington, DC",78,134,2,5.0,10/29/2013,"I had the Pumpkin Ale and the Southern Fried Chicken.  Both were unbelievable!  Also, the SFC has a perfect portion for lunch. Great service and great food."
Rob M.,"Frisco, TX",69,225,2,2.0,9/10/2013,"Oh BJ's... it's not that it was bad, but it wasn't good either.  Their beer is just fine, but the food seems like what I should have expected from a chain restaurant.  It was solid and OK.  But I don't spend my life searching for OK.  Shrimp pasta was mostly spaghetti noodles I could have boiled at home."
Ashley M.,"Dallas, TX",70,10,6,5.0,3/31/2011,"Great service from Ashley P!!!  My friend and I chose BJ's after a looooonnnnggg day of car shopping. We sat in the bar which is normally a no-no for me (bad experience with bar service) but we took a chance. Server Ashley came over right away and was very attentive the entire time! :) I had the tomato bisque soup in the sourdough loaf of course and my friend had the spaghetti with blackened chicken. I ate light because I couldn't leave without having the chocolate chunk pizookie!!! The dessert satisfies alllllll of my chocolate cravings ever!!! Great service, great food, will def be back as soon as I am feeling naughty again. :D"
Kacie C.,"Dallas, TX",179,51,1,5.0,11/11/2010,"As for brew pubs in Dallas, you can't get any better than BJ's! I just wish they would open one up in the 214 area. With their abundance of beer selections...from micro brew to imports to plain jane domestics, they have it all!  Their menu has a bit of everything. Almost as overwhelming as Cheesecake Factory with so many choices. However, unlike Cheesecake Factory, BJ's chooses quality over quantity. I normally get the scrumptious Turkey Cobb Sandwich that comes with tasty wedge fries. Love those!!  Last time i went, I ventured out and ordered the Chicken Parmesan. O....M.....G....the BEST chicken parm i've ever had!! Highly recommend ordering that if you have a hankering for some italian.  Thinking about it makes my mouth water and wished they would open one in East Dallas. Please BJ's, I know you'd have me as a regular if you did!"
Jade S.,"Dallas, TX",769,185,181,3.0,6/20/2013,"We came here during lunch it was busy but or waiter was quick and friendly.He had our food out right away,brought us a sample of their seasonal beer and was very consistent the whole time.If your looking for excellent food at a reasonable price and need to be in and out Bj's is the way to go!"
Dan D.,"Dallas, TX",279,453,298,5.0,5/7/2011,"Last week I was in for happy hour.  We met friends and sat in the bar, I enjoyed reduced beer prices and appetizers."
Tony M.,"Woodstock, GA",188,268,93,3.0,9/19/2008,"I went there this week Wednesday with folks from work, yes, even my boss!  So, here's how it all went down... First, the greeters tried to steer us to a table that was too close to the smoking section.  When we asked for one further away from the smoke, they incredulously suggested the table immediately to the left of the first table!  We were there at 5:20 on a Wednesday.  The whole place was practically empty.  We had to be persistent in asking for two tables far at the other end of the floor. Fortunately, we were served by a wonderfully attentive and friendly waitress who, despite her arm being in a cast, did her best which was better than most at other restaurants.  We gave her a big fat tip. Now, the appetizers were many and varied.  Something for everyone.  I especially liked the fat avocado eggrolls.  YUM-MEEEE!  The onion strings were fun.  And the chips had to be freshly-made that very hour, they were so corn-crunchy good. Drinks, I had two.  First it was the Poisonous Caramel Apple.  Yes, that was the name.  Lots of pineapple juice in it, it was refreshing but I didn't order it a 2nd time.  I did order something called A Drink Like That.  Now, that is a drink.  I could taste the silliness with every strawful.  =)  I did stop at two drinks because, after all, it was a work affair. Now, entree, pay attention: the pot roast was D-vine.  Really, really good.  A little fatty on the edge but it was mostly thick and beefy and was perfectly complimented by the cheesy mashed potatoes and brown gravy like grandma (on my father's side) used to make. Dessert, well, I got talked into their signature cookie only I went with a brownie and ouchie.  It was sweeter than sweet and heaped with ice cream and whipped cream.  Way too sweet for even my sweet tooth but it might be your thing.  TIP: if you think you might not finish it, when you order it, you can ask for it in an aluminum tray and it's easier to take home than to scoop it out of the metal tin they serve it in. Parking was ample when we got there.  Lots of great sports on many huge flat screens.  They have lots of beers if that's your thing.  Vast menu. I will be happy to go back, especially if the boss is buying again!"
Bill S.,"Dallas, TX",81,348,33,3.0,4/24/2011,Our default dinner/drinks location in Addison.  Whenever my wife and I can't figure out where to go we end up at BJ's.  The service is always good.  The menu has a good variety so it should please most groups.  Their seasonal brews are usually worth trying.
Paige D.,"Rowlett, TX",3,66,8,4.0,2/5/2014,I wish I could remember our servers name because she was just outstanding! We came with a big group for a birthday and she was so kind and helpful. Very professional and organized with such a big group! I love their pizzas and the healthy alternatives they have to make it fit your diet plan such as the whole wheat crusts. Everything I've had here is delicious and decently priced. This place is great for special occasions and dates.
Arjun M.,"Sugar Land, TX",61,32,,3.0,7/2/2011,"Went here with a group of 8. Let's get to the point: I ordered a steak, it was perfect. No complaints, it was cooked to perfection and tasted amazing. Tried others' fish tacos they were better than average. The pizza was OK, but if you want pizza go to Grimaldi or Coal vines. Now one person ordered the ""new"" ""mediterraneon"" pasta. It was freaking terrible. No sauce, no flavor, nothing closely related to mediterraneon. Was so disappointed, sent it back. They took almost 35 min to bring out the new order, my friend sat there hungry and felt bad taking the food everyone offered her in the meanwhile. This was very disappointing.  Then they had the BALLS to charge us for pasta?!?! Are you kidding. We talked to the manager and removed it. Keep in mind that only like 3 bites were taken out of the pasta, it's not like we ate it and then sent it back. Final thoughts: order safely. Do not experiment, like I said steak was great, fish tacos were good, pizza was OK, and pasta was terrible, (I tried a bit from everyone). Oh and I forgot the best part, the beer. Beer was really good. Which is why I will give this place a solid 3."
Anthony A.,"Lancaster, TX",265,549,1832,5.0,2/10/2011,Great deep dish pizza and appetizers.  Desert are very good.  Very nice spot for drinks or just to watch a good sporting events.  The Menu is very diverse and has many new items no  the menu that are worth trying.  I highly recommend this restaurant.
