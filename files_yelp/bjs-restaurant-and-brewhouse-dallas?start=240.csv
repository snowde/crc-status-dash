Bryce K.,"Carrollton, Dallas, TX",16,26,,5.0,5/19/2013,Great restaurant. Chris F is an awesome server has always taken great care of us. Ask for him! Good food good people
Roni B.,"Euless, TX",337,552,242,3.0,1/16/2013,we've been here many times before...so it wasn't just spectacular...service could've been alot better!! any time i have to get up and go get anything i've asked for...yea i have a problem with that! the appetizer didn't come out hot...it literally came out barely warm...wth!! there were plenty of servers and even a manager present...not sure why this was not a pleasant dining experience!!
Seri V.,"Grand Prairie, TX",12,56,6,3.0,7/20/2010,"My girlfriend and I decided to sit in the bar area so we could just eat and chit chat and not feel to be rushed on out by the restaurant patrons.  We didn't know that we came during happy hour (3:00pm) and decided to order some food.  I ordered the Mediterranean pizza which had all the dressings that you could die for (olives, goat cheese, chicken, etc) and she opted for some avocado sandwich.  Anyways,  I thought the pizza was going to be $10+ but it turned out to be half off during happy hours!! WOO!  So moral of the story, if you want some good food to go with your drinks, BJ's has half off pizza's during happy hour!  Other than that, I think their food is okay."
Taylor M.,"Birmingham, AL",59,227,29,5.0,1/30/2013,"I give them 5 stars for the cookies and cream pizookie alone -- it is so SO SOOOOO good. I want to find a reason to order the extra-large pizookie and eat it all by myself. I have been here twice now with large groups, and the service has been great and they split the checks for us. I like the reward point system they offer (free pizookies!?). Great restaurant chain that was new to me before moving to Dallas. Love it!"
Darren B.,"Frisco, TX",0,9,,4.0,8/16/2013,"I make the drive to BJ's from Frisco, rather than visit the nearby G Biersch. Mainly because the food is better. The beer is probably a notch better at Biersch but not the burgers and thin fries. I've never had poor or slow service but I'm usually not in a big rush. I pair the Hopstorm with the crispy jalapeño burger and its amazing. The pizza is pretty good although I like Boston's in McKinney a little better. All in all, like the reviewer said below, they have an incredibly big menu, decent service and good beer."
Steven S.,"Arlington, TX",138,225,32,2.0,4/19/2010,"Waitress - 3 Stars Food - 3 Stars Hostesses - 1 Star Am I just a little upset about the seating time and the vacuum-headed hostesses? Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes! (Here I throw a hissy fit!) This is a corporate American big-time food chain. It they can figure out how to induce money out of cash strapped Americans still reeling after a recession, they can damn well figure out how to organize and train hostesses to seat their customers properly and more importantly, promptly.  This was a large place, I noticed the capacity was close to 300. There didn't seem to be many in front of us when we bravely strode up to its front doors. We had six of us. The hostess immediately said, ""20 minutes"" (Are they all trained to lie without blinking?) It was more like 45 minutes before I finally confronted them about our wait. Then, as I was leading our group past the hostess stand, I overheard one of them saying what a ""jerk this guy was complaining about waiting 45 minutes"".  Anyway, thanks for letting me get that off my chest. Not like anything will change, of course. I doubt if BJ's management reads their Yelp reviews.  The food was as usual. The place was nicely decorated. The noise level made talking across the table difficult. The pizza was a little pricey. $24 for six slices. So, why did I go there? Well, I didn't pick the place, but I didn't speak up for myself, either. Well, I guess we lemmings get what we deserve."
Nick P.,"Wylie, TX",47,28,,2.0,5/28/2013,"While the food here is normally pretty decent, the service leaves a whole lot to be desired. The daytime bartender spent more time talking and shooting the breeze with other employees, than she did actually serving.  As a hint to the bartender - NO, most people (inlcuding the poor guy whom you directly told the story to) do NOT want to hear about your son needing an attorney for his accident. I personally heard the story told three times in 30 minutes.  NO - I dont want to hear you talk to other about what you did, who works tomorrow and what book you are reading. Chat is great - as long as it is appropriate, and directed to the customer.  You work in an area that is heavily steeped with professionals, who will run in for a quick bite to eat. They arent your average diners - they dont have all day for you to finish your story, to another emplyee. You may make a bit more money, simply by being a little more attentive, and a little less absent. Last but not least - to corporate:  You'd be surprised that most people know how to do rudementary math. Printing ""Suggested Gratuity"" 15%/20% at the bottom of the ticket is not only insulting, it is extremely tacky."
Tempie H.,"McKinney, TX",4,59,15,4.0,2/12/2013,"My husband and I had dinner here last night. Our waiter was really nice and brought our drinks promptly. We both decided that the Piranha Pale Ale Chili & Cheese Giant Stuffed Potato sounded good, so we each had one of those. I was  a little surprised when they brought our meal. Yes, the potato was ""Giant"", but I was expecting it to be ""stuffed"" with chili and cheese. It had  a good amount of melted cheese on top, but the chili came in a tiny bowl on the side, along with some sour cream. The amount of chili couldn't have been any more than a 1/4 cup. The ratio of potato to chili was definitely unbalanced. I thought it tasted good, but I did feel like for $9 that there should have been more chili. Overall though, I do really enjoy dining at BJ's, so I will be back."
Alice T.,"Plano, TX",109,46,33,4.0,3/7/2010,"Started off with BJ's Irish Root Beer, which is their handcrafted root beer, whiskey, irish cream, and butterscotch shnapps. It was my second time ordering this drink and I was kinda skeptical of it this time because there was a chunky film on top, which I guess I didn't notice when I had it before. It also tasted flat and there wasn't enough whiskey. The bartender assured me the film was due to the irish cream curdling in the root beer, but gladly remade it for me and it was better the second time. Still had the chunks, and it still tasted flat, but I guess it was better with more whiskey. This drink was much better at the Lewisville location. We ordered the large Mediterranean Pizza and it came out in about 20-25 mins. It had chicken, olives, artichokes, pepperocinis, all that good Greeky stuff. What I like about their pizza is that they don't over-do the tomato sauce. It's not the kind where the top layer will slide off and you'll end up scooping it up with a fork. Also the crust has good flavor and texture, and it's not too bread-y. The large was perfect for 4 people, and we didn't even have appetizers.  My friend had the Balsamic Glazed Chicken and I got to try a bite. The chicken was moist and flavorful, and perfectly cooked. It was refreshing to try after having poorly done and overcooked chicken so frequently from other restaurants.  Overall the food came out good or better, and our server was quick and helpful. They lost a star for the drink."
Nikki W.,"Summerland Key, FL",0,49,,4.0,6/8/2013,"We really enjoyed this place! Huge menu which I like, but feels like a chain which I don't like! All in all it's a good place to stop for a beer and a bite. I will definitely be back!"
Dan P.,"Richardson, TX",122,56,25,4.0,10/25/2010,"My favorite place to grab a good meals with friends! Pro-  The pizzas are amazing, all of them to be exact. The Derek's meatloaf is the best meatloaf I have ever tasted & for $12.95 it's the best deal ever. The handcrafted beers add another great element to Bj's concept of a brewery as well. Great place for birthday party as well, usually the waitstaff are very efficient. Cons: The pastas aren't worth 14-16 bucks, way overprice. The long wait on the weekend does get annoying sometimes."
Steve M.,"Houston, TX",74,217,41,4.0,12/27/2009,"Another chain restaurant that is consistent in both quality and service.  I have been a regular customer at their california locations and was looking forward to dining here again.   This time my friend and I shared a Mediterranean pizza. The pizza was very good,  and is probably the closest thing that I have been able to find to a thick deep dish style of pizza.  I also tried their home brewed root beer and black cherry soda.  The root beer was flat and didn't have a great flavor.  The Black Cherry soda was a lot better, but it was also flat.  I wonder if the carbonation machine was not working properly or this is how the drinks are. Service was great and the overall experience was excellent.  We even managed to get a 2nd dessert for free from some error in the kitchen.  How can anyone complain about that ?"
Melinda D.,"San Jose, CA",197,145,12,3.0,1/5/2010,"There is still smoking in the city of Addison, so my sister and I set out to find the least smokey bar with a decent beer selection on Beltline to watch the A&M bowl game.  BJ's was our last stop and it won over a few other bars/restaurants.  It had large enough TV's so that we could watch the game, and their house brews along with the additional taps and bottle list was quite impressive...for Dallas. ;-)  (Sorry, living in Southern California has made me quite the beer snob.)   The service was good, our waiter was attentive enough and made sure our beers were full during the game.  The food was just like any other BJ's, it's fairly consistent.  This may not be a bar I'll frequent when I'm in town visiting family, but at least I know they have good beer."
Gena T.,"Irving, TX",23,17,,1.0,1/31/2014,"Lunch was AWFUL.   We have a 1 hour lunch per our company policy and this was a disaster today.   1st, the waitress rolled her eyes when we sat, then she didn't write any of our orders down.  I ordered a steak salad and asked for no potatoes or bell peppers.  Our order took 45 mins to come to the table and guess what i had.  Potatoes and bell peppers.  Then I told her not to worry about sending it back, until I started attempting to cut into the steak.  The steak was all fat and no meat and I couldn't cut into it because they never brought me a steak knife.  So the manager came out, he apologized and comped my meal, which was fine. Then we mentioned the long wait on our food and his excuse was- it's Friday we're busy.  Sorry-I worked in a restaurant in college and we were told on lunch hour to get people in and out because of short lunches.  This excuse was unacceptable and I will never go there again due to the bad, long service and wait time and the pittiful excuse we got from the manager. Our lunch was then 2 hours."
Larry D.,"Houston, TX",1139,123,6,4.0,10/24/2012,"Great food, HUGE selection of both beer and food.  Plenty of TV's to watch the game.  The service is hit and miss, but it's never been BAD.  Sometimes just a little better than others.  We've never had to wait for a seat, but we also eat pretty late.  We'll continue to visit once a month or so."
J. B.,"Dallas, TX",0,3,,1.0,10/7/2014,"I went to BJ's a few years back and brought my niece and nephew - ages 6 and 9 at the time.  Both are very well behaved.  Once we were seated, a group of three guys (in their 30's) came in and said to our waitress - ""Hey, wait on us first - we'll give you a bigger tip!""  REALLY???  So, the waitress went over to their table and took their order and then came over and took our order - if it was up to me, I would have just left, but the kids wanted to stay.  We ate our dinner, which was less than enjoyable for me - food is just fair.  Of course, since we were treated so poorly - waitress never came back to see if we needed our drinks refilled, etc.  Those guys at the next table were correct - bet they DID leave her a better tip - I left nothing and will NEVER return."
Robert C.,"Dallas, TX",31,18,,3.0,3/15/2010,"Continuing with my newbie attitude with DFW, I've been to the BJ's location in Tukwila, WA several times.  Most of the times while there, my friends and I would get our favorite waitress and received great service, but when didn't get her, we had anywhere from craptastic to good service.   Here has been a continuation of decent service that I expect.  I haven't received any problems with service as mentioned in other posts (even with packed nights), but there's always a possibility.   I normally get the BJ's Favorite (pizza) here capped off with a pizookie.  I haven't tried anything else at this location, but I generally get the half-chicken, parmesan chicken, and chicken fried steak.  All of which are decent, but nothing special.   However, for the price, it's pretty good eats. The highlight is the beer.  Fresh beer.  Good beer.   While it's not the best beer in WA or Oregon, it's probably the best beer I've had in Texas... ever."
AnnonyMouse M.,"Dallas, TX",0,14,1,1.0,5/30/2013,"So annoyed I signed up for yelp just to write a review. First of all, SLOOOOOW service. Last two times I've been there, we've sat around for 20 mins before someone even took our drink order. We didn't get out of there in under 2 hours. Not cool for a lunch crowd. Second of all, the person who took our reservation is super rude. Told me he was ""doing me a favor"" by ""squeezing me in."" I'm sorry that my coming to your restaurant is doing you a favor. We'll be sure to go elsewhere next time!"
Deff G.,"Dallas, TX",32,111,1,4.0,10/22/2010,"In a sea of mediocre medium priced chain restaurants, this place is truly a shining beacon. The mixed drinks are always on point and their beer selection is on par with an actual Pub devoted solely to better beers.   The food selections has always been VERY consistent and always delicious.  You really can't go wrong here.  They know what they are doing and they do it well. This is our full on standby restaurant when we can't think of any other place to go.   SUGGESTIONS Beer:  Their Grand Cru (seasonal - around xmas/new years) Apps:  Pot Stickers or Avocado Egg Rolls or Sliders Meals:  Pretty much anything.  I know everybody freaks out on their pizzas but they have wonderful chicken dishes to sandwiches to pastas.  Heck, their ribs are good too, but I was disappointed that they didn't offer a wet towel or something of the sort to clean up with.. resulting in my walking across the restaurant with bar-b-q sauce all over my hands to clean them in the restroom.   anyways... good place.  very consistent and have been a regular since they've opened."
Katherine S.,"Fort Worth, TX",2,23,9,3.0,10/8/2009,"Alright ... there we were at BJ's. I hadn't ever eaten here and really hadn't heard of it before - but per recommendation of the person we went to lunch with, we tried it.  We ordered the spinach artichoke dip as an appetizer and it was deliciously yummy! That alone was worth the trip. For our main meal we split a California club type sandwich and it was tasty as well. They also had a good kids menu and all the food that we ordered came out hot and delicious.  Oh, and lets not forget, they serve the little skinny shoestring fries which are crispy bits of goodness. Problem -  1. The service sucked! The waiter was never anywhere to be found. My drink hit the bottom several times and since my sandwich was spicy it would have been nice to at least have water available. After about 10 minutes of enduring a burning esophagus, I flagged down the nearest person and asked for a drink refill.  2. The menu is huge and overwhelming. I like to go to places that have a variety but not too much. It gets overwhelming and stressful trying to make that decision. They have a big menu like Cheesecake Factory - which unfortunately whacks a star off the rating. (I like small menu with chef specializing in each item)  I would like to go back and try their pizzas.  They all looked really good!  Overall ... A-OK!"
