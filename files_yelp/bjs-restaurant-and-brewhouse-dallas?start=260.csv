Jim M.,"Dallas, TX",25,11,1,2.0,7/22/2014,"I am a big fan of BJs but this location was below expectations. As always there were 3-4 young women working at the front desk and we were quickly shown to a table. Great. Our friendly but too quiet server introduced herself and we ordered drinks and appetizers, then had to wait too long to order our entrees. Not a big deal. After about a 20 minute wait, my partner's entrée came out. It was delivered by a server who came from the front of the restaurant, not the kitchen. Strange but OK. After 10 additional minutes waiting for my entrée, with no check in from our waitress, I asked to see a manager. My entrée came out and the other entree was taken away to be ""remade"" since it was now cold. I had to ask for a pizza server since none was left by our waitress; the manager returned with one. My entree was a chicken bacon and ranch pizza, my partner had jambalaya. The food itself was really good, to be fair, but the service was poor - it seemed that the kitchen was not doing any favors for the servers last night. Two other observations - a diner at a neighboring table sent his pizza back because it was wet in the middle, and we noticed 3 servers standing around doing nothing while we waited for our food. Having worked at a restaurant before I can't ever recall having time to stand around and do nothing... I doubt we'll return to this location of BJs but I have had good experience at the north Fort Worth location, so I'll go to that one."
Victoria W.,"Allen, TX",176,29,,5.0,3/1/2012,Was great food and nice people. I had never been to a BJ's and was surprised the lunch was so cheap. Would definitely go again.
Arturo I.,"Dallas, TX",12,35,13,4.0,6/1/2014,"Went there for my birthday. They have a great craft beer selection made by them, and the food was very good. The food is a bit pricey. Service was friendly."
J.P. M.,"Keller, TX",185,25,11,2.0,2/26/2012,This place is the slowest place on earth.... Really bad service Unbearably slow with the food I swear...when my co-workers ask me where we should go to lunch I don't even make suggestions anymore...I just say as long as we don't go to BJs...I'm good! That is pathetic... Atmosphere and pretty good grub are ruined by meh service and the slowest effing kitchen on earth.
Anne R.,"Dallas, TX",0,11,,5.0,3/29/2013,"As long as you don't come when its super busy, you should get really great service. I love to eat here anytime my business takes me near addison.  Can't wait to go back!! Ps. Make sure you save room for a Pizookie! SO GOOD!!"
Brad B.,"Austin, TX",47,133,32,3.0,6/7/2012,"Like many other chain type places the service can be hit or miss.  Some of the entree's that I've had great success with are the pizza and the French dip, both have always been very tasty.  Now for the beer- Very, very tasty.  They tout their own beer here and I love the Jeremiah Red.  They also do a great hef and while I'm not a fan of IPA's my hop loving friends sing praises about this one too.  Be careful though, most of the beers have a higher alcohol percentage and the red is 5.7% or something high so as quickly as they go down the effects kick in.  BJ's is basically the new age chili's with better food and beverage choices.  Very similar to humperdinks....   It's a good safe work lunch place or a spot to hang out in the bar area for good conversations."
Kareem A.,"Plano, TX",36,148,40,2.0,7/20/2009,"I went here last night with my wife, and just like the past five or six times I've been here, I left wondering why I even came here in the first place. They have three things going for them from my point of view, their homemade strawberry lemonade (the best, absolutely), their pizzas and their pizookies.  Everything else is a MAJOR disappointment. I've tried their pot roast, burgers, New York strip, balsamic chicken dish, chicken alfredo and other immemorable entrees and they all just plain suck, especially for the price they charge. Last night the bill was $60 for the two of us... it was worth $20 (at most). And the service is ridiculously slow after 9:30pm when the main dining area closes because they have one person waiting on everyone for the remainder of the night. Am I coming back?  Most likely.  But I know I'll end up disappointed... again."
Sanjay R.,"Dallas, TX",0,4,,3.0,6/24/2014,Phone lady Maddy was rude.  Sorry I disturbed you at work! Next time I'll just guess when the kitchen closes.
Shashawn W.,"Lewisville, TX",119,205,34,4.0,4/16/2012,Good service. Order was correct. Waiters were pleasant.
Stephanie R.,"Dallas, TX",29,145,5,2.0,7/7/2009,"I think I am officially done with BJ's Brewery.  Time and time again we have been stumped on where to go eat and somebody brings up BJ's because the menu is so big and they have a bit of everything, but when we leave we are reminded about why we vow to never return: craptacular service.  This last weekend we were there about 4 pm and ordered a few pints and some salads. Usually I'm a 'hold the whatever' kind of girl, but because our waiter was already so surly I just kept things simple and had my meal as is. He still seemed put out.  We got our food pretty quickly, but the people at the next table that ordered before we did still hadn't received their food by the time we cashed out. Not cool.  FYI since they are in Addison they still have a smoking section, which is partitioned off from the rest of the restaurant with a glass half wall. It didn't seem terribly smoky when we were there, but at peak times that wall doesn't do much to keep the smell out of the main dining area."
Ryan M.,"Dallas, TX",36,24,5,5.0,6/27/2009,"Easily in my top 3 fav restaurants...Easily. I do have my favorite menu items; however, have never had one thing that didnt taste amazing. Unless you are just a thin crust type of person, this is the best pizza in Dallas. I know all of you have your hidden neighborhood pizzerias, and are anti-chain...but dont really care. I would put myself against anybody on this site as the healthiest eater; however, if I had a last meal, this pizza would be it (or Babe's Fried Chicken).  My other entrees of choice are the slow roasted chicken or one of the massive salads with blackened salmon. Dad always gets the Jumbalya and Mom gets an open faced sandwhiches (tried both and its just ridiculous). In conclusion, close your eyes, point to something, and enjoy."
Dan G.,"Dallas, TX",81,216,32,4.0,2/11/2012,"What the underlying theme at BJ's? Service. I have never had a good experience here with the service and its not always that they are slow but more that they just don't want to be there. I am not sure if the management is making them mad and grumpy with hot pizzas ion the back room that they are forced to smell but not eat? That would make me grumpy! I usually get the pizza at Bj's. Its great, fresh flavorful, just good! Its a deep dish style of sorts but it not super doughy and they stack it with toppings!  They have a great beer selection as well being that they do brew their own! I do find it  a little on the loud side however."
Scott S.,"Lindale, TX",5,38,1,4.0,9/2/2012,Nice atmosphere. Service was prompt and polite. The beer selection was great and the weisen I had was yummy. Good food choices and I enjoyed my meal enormously. I'll be back.
Rachel W.,"Dallas, TX",35,72,2,4.0,5/15/2009,"I'm a fan because BJ's (the couple of times that I've been there) has awesome, awesome service. The food is pretty good. I've had their sliders, nachos, pizzas and salads before. I don't have any complaints about those.  But the service is always wonderful - and let me tell you why.  My husband and I were there for dinner last night, enjoying ourselves. The manager came up to us (actually, we didn't know he was manager until later) and asked us if we would ""make a deal"" with him. We sort of laughed and he continued -- he said he would give us a free dessert if we moved tables.  I was impressed. He was able to take a somewhat negative situation, and he made it fun (and hey! free brownie a la mode.). That takes something. It wasn't just that we got something free. It was that he was SO friendly and SO appreciative of us moving just five feet away.  We'll be back to BJ's. (Sidenote: the beer is pretty good, too. My husband liked their hefeweizen alot.)"
Claudine B.,"Bedford, TX",225,39,71,4.0,11/1/2010,This was my second time coming to this restaurant but a different franchise. I loved the Tuna Poke Appetizer. The crispie triangles they had with it were a perfect accompaniment. The Miso Salmon was a favorite of the Manager and I loved it too.
Megan A.,"Phoenix, AZ",10,101,4,2.0,7/25/2012,"Okay, we've tried this out a couple of times. Although the seared ahi salad is pretty good and the avocado rolls are too, the rest of the food is just mediocre. I honestly think my husbands multiple request to come here is solely based on his love of their homemade rootbeer."
David A.,"Dallas, TX",0,10,1,4.0,10/29/2012,"The service is usually fairly slow, but we had a great waitress this time. The spicy meatball pizza is great, and of course, if you like desserts, don't forget to get a pizooki."
Alex L.,"Denver, CO",176,821,392,3.0,2/9/2009,"This place is hot and cold.  I haven't been in quite some time and it really isn't the first place I think of when I go out with my friends.  We have had many times where the waiter is just a bumbling idiot.  They either forget requested items or they turn their shift into a fraternity party with other coworkers while ignoring the customer.  I would naturally give it four stars but being that the service is a hit or miss, I had to drop it down a notch.  The quality of food is excellent as well as their desserts.  The only thing I would stay away from is their pastas.  I have had their sandwiches, salads, pizza, soups and other entrees and they are very tasty.  The environment is more inviting than some restaurants but pricing could definitely be better."
Rich L.,"Dallas, TX",143,237,49,2.0,11/5/2009,Meh.  I think my experience may have been tainted because I sat in the smoking section.  But I found the menu overwhelming so I just asked the waitress for her favorite and got the turkey sandwich.  I thought it must be something out of the ordinary since she picked it out of everything but it was extra average.  I was jealous of my friend french dip. The Hefeweisen was good doing down though.
Walter E.,"Chesterbrook, PA",32,75,4,3.0,5/2/2011,"Not much to say, the food , service, and surroundinks are average. The menu is extensive (think Cheesecake Factory) which is a little annoying, I don't need that many options! Their home-brewed beer isn't to bad either. Not much else to say...try it, don't try it...it doesn't matter because the place just isn't memorable."
