Rebecca G.,"Allen, TX",61,303,641,3.0,6/15/2011,Great sandwiches. Really good pizza. Sante fe chicken salad with chipotle ranch is terrific. Oh...avocado rolls & sante fe spring rolls are amazing. Good for groups either taking back to the office or eating there.
Lauren T.,"Dallas, TX",589,274,1,4.0,7/23/2011,"Listen up: BJ's has some of the best pizza ever. If you like deep dish pizza... this place is heaven!!! And no worries... they have yummy thin-crust  for you deep dish haters too. Their dessert pizookies are also SOOOOO good! (For those of you not familiar with BJ's slang, pizookies are these cookies they bake in a deep dish, yes... like a pizza, that are made-to-order and piping hot with ice cream and caramel...or whatever else you want... dripping down the top!). The menu is HUGE (probably equivalent to the size of Cheesecake Factory's menu), and there is really something for everyone. As for the pizza, you can pretty much order any kind of pizza you could possibly dream of, and they have every topping imaginable to choose from. If you can snag a booth in front of their ginormous TV screen, this is also a great place to watch a game. I've spent at least 2 or 3 times at this place for 3-4 hours straight watching a sporting event and running up a large tab. Haha. The waiters are cool, and I've never had a bad experience with any of their locations. Maybe it's because they give us deep dish fans a whole lot of love, or maybe it's those darn pizookies... but for whatever reason, I just adore this restaurant!"
HP W.,"Addison, TX",11,108,,5.0,2/16/2011,"Just went with my husband for Valentine's Day.  Was the BEST!  We had a salad, followed by a deep dish pizza (with everything on it) followed by a Pazooki.  If you've never had a pazooki, you've gotta try one.  I swear my husband says it's one of his top 5 desserts of all times!  We got the white chocolate macadamia nut cookie (that was gooey on the inside) topped with vanilla bean ice cream.  SOOOOOO amazing.  You HAVE to try it!!!"
Elena I.,"Plano, TX",19,13,12,3.0,11/1/2008,"That's just it a-ok. Not too bad, boring even. Too big to be cozy. But nice inside. We sat in a booth near the bar area. The food was okay - nothing extraodinary. The strawberry martini I had was really good! The waiter was nice and attentive.  Overall it's a ok place to go to for a change."
John J.,"Carrollton, TX",0,6,1,4.0,4/7/2014,"Friendly staff, menu is huge! They had everything from that poppers, pizza to pazookie. Great prices and they have their own brews ($4.00) after 9th sweet"
Kevin M.,"Irving, TX",72,4,,2.0,3/16/2011,"The food isn't bad, and the beer is good, but the internet service is limited to the management staff.  Why?  I am sitting at a table, consuming copious (enough) amounts of beer, wanting to work, and cannot use your internet.  Why the hate?  Why the dark-ages style service?  Sadness.  Deep, foreboding sadness."
Joanna G.,"North Dallas, Dallas, TX",2,11,3,1.0,2/10/2012,Cockroaches all over the main seating everywhere!  Manager said it was the weather/season. We will never eat there again.
Just K.,"Dallas, TX",55,241,2,4.0,8/11/2008,"A great place to go for lunch.  It is very much a bar atmosphere with televisions all around.  If you are into sports, don't bring anyone with you who will be annoyed when you stop listening to them because you are watching tv! I was very happy with the quality of food and the portion size for the price.  I got the salad and sandwich combo.  The salad comes out first, which may not be a good thing if everyone doesn't get this since you may be eating alone while your companion waits for their meal to arrive.  The portion of the salad was very large, which initially made me think that they brought me a full size salad and not the combo (the waiter confirmed with me that I did indeed order the combo so I dove into it quickly while my hungry buddy watched me eat since he ordered something else).  The sandwich comes with a side of french fries.  Oh, I forgot to mention all the choices you have with this.  You have a choice of three salads (side, wedge or ceasar), two kinds of fries (thin or wedge) and probably six different sandwiches.  I think my whole meal was only $8 and it was delicious. The pizza looks really good and I need to go back to try it."
Kari S.,"Denver, CO",8,24,1,4.0,1/2/2009,"This place has a good pizza. It is somewhat of a deep dish pizza and they have different types. I have tried a few and liked them all. My fave is the Great White pizza with chicken, mozzarella cheese, and Alfredo sauce. I opted out the tomatoes and mushrooms.  They also have a really nice Berry Berry Cider. It is a good sized glass that is nice and sweet.  Sometimes the place can get loud if there are alot of games going on. My only problem is they have never shown a Dallas Stars game on the big screen when I've gone."
Sarah B.,"Fort Worth, TX",143,187,12,4.0,7/10/2008,"Haley failed to mention that happy hour would include 30 ""out to get laid"" twenty-something aggies.  Upon arrival, we rescued her from the group and set her gently beside us at the bar, where the appetizer nachos, as aforementioned, served as dinner for all three of us.  The bartender was a sweetie pie. Dinner and drinks for 3 people = $27.  Rock on, BJ's.  Rock on."
Rachael M.,"Dallas, TX",238,447,109,3.0,5/22/2009,"I'll recommend this place for two things: the pizza and the beer.  I'm definitely a fan of building my own pizza, so that is a nice fallback on the menu.  If you have a big group, build one for the whole table.  Go for the chips & salsa or advocado egg rolls for appetizers.  The egg rolls seem fresh, but can get a little messy.  The fish tacos are decent, though the breading is a little thick for my liking.  The sauce and salsa that come with are winners, however.  Most of the pastas I've tried were overcooked & chewy with subpar sauces.  I can heat up stuff out of a jar at home, thanks.  They also have a beer sampler that I recommend.  You get to try out a lot of their signature brews and figure out what you prefer before order a whole glass.  And you can share it with someone just in case you don't like one of the flavors Service is very inconsistent at this location.  There seems to be a high rate of turnover, so most of the servers I only see once or twice.  I've always had a hard time getting refills or other small things I needed.  A lot of the time, the check gets slapped down on the table in passing, so I have to stop them again if I want dessert or something to go.  I think this place is best left for watching sporting events or grabbing a drink."
Sarah D.,"Dallas, TX",389,81,444,4.0,11/28/2010,"Ok so BJ's and me have a love hate relationship. Somedays It's really sweet the mood is good the food is yummy and the service is great! But on the other days it's bad reeeeaall bad! I have been here quite a bit so I've had plenty of time to figure this place out! All in all it's a pretty good place I'd compare it to Houlihans or an upscale chili's..it is usually almost always busy and there is usually always a wait! Try sittin at the bar it's way more fun and entertaining than sitting in the main room....a bunch of seating and TVs to watch..The drink and food menu is huuuuge! They do have these amazing pizzas, a ton of different burgers, sandwiches, salads, and a freaking billion other things... I actually had salmon here one time, and trust me I know my salmon and it was Yummo...plus they have  really good platters for sharing! Beware...sometimes this pretty decent grub takes forever to come out, and the waitresses aren't always the nicest chicks in the world, but its definitely worth trying! I recommend this place for a casual outing.. how bout a game day or before a movie;)"
De'Von G.,"Allen, TX",4,17,5,5.0,6/3/2012,"If you are in the mood for anything and I do mean anything, I'm pretty sure BJ's has it. My gf and I have gone to this place a number of times and have never had lousy service. Our one bad experience was when I ordered the cod. It was gross and I would advise everyone to stay away. Anyway, their menu has a great variety and the atmosphere is great. I really like the patio seating too."
Caitlin K.,"Red Oak, TX",17,8,3,1.0,10/14/2013,"Extremely poor service. My husband and I went there for dinner on a Monday night. The restaurant was fairly crowded but we were seated right away. We waited 10 minutes after being seated before our server even greeted us. By then we already had our orders ready. We waited another HOUR before our food came out! Whether they were short-handed or they dropped our food (which is what I think happened), our server never returned to our table to let us know why our food was taking so long. To make it worse, the manager went by all of the tables around us asking how everything was..but conveniently skipped ours. She must have read it on our faces or already knew the situation because I can't think why else she'd pass us up. Once we received our food, mine was fine but my husband's California club flatbread was basically bread only. Our server returned with our check in which we paid full price for everything. We weren't looking for a free meal or anything, just an apology or explanation. We got neither. We will NOT be visiting this restaurant again."
Matt D.,"Addison, TX",43,284,25,4.0,6/28/2011,"One of the best chain restaurants out there. I've been to many BJ's and they have all tasted the same. Everything on the menu is good and their handcrafted beers seize to be beaten. If your looking for traditional American food at a decent price, definitely recommend."
Joseph F.,"Addison, TX",0,3,,1.0,3/13/2012,"I was sharing the nacho platter with a group of acquaintances and I have felt nauseous and sick since I left the restaurant.  Will never go there again, I recommended you stat away if you care about staying away from e-coli."
Ami P.,"Dallas, TX",122,62,,3.0,9/23/2008,"They serve alcohol, so it's not that bad of place. However, it is kinda boring. Both times I've been our waiter hasn't been very good.  The food - eh."
K. K.,"Dallas, TX",2,21,,4.0,6/5/2008,"I'm surprised no one has mentioned their baked potatoes! It was the first thing I got when BJ's first opened and something I can always go to when I'm unsure of what to get. Most of these carbalicious beauties come with alfredo sauce inside and in a little dish on the side; it may sound odd and way too rich, but it's an interesting replacement to the usual butter and sour cream. They certainly aren't good for those watching their waist line, but they're a great menu item to splurge on and I think it is safe to say they're one of the best items on their menu. The potatoes are huge and generously stuffed with various toppings; my favorite is the grilled chicken potato which comes with fresh florets of broccoli, chunks of grilled chicken breasts, and melting cheddar cheese some of which drips along the tasty potato skins which I love to eat [one of the healthier things about the potato, haha]. I've also tried the Garden Vegetable Potato and Blackened Chicken Potato, but Grilled Chicken is my staple. The menu has many selections, some of which are mediocre, but I think the stuffed potatoes are always a delicious option. I've tried the pizza and I find it to be way too doughy, even if it is deep-dish, Chicago style pizza.  [Old Chicago, which has been Pappa's Pizza and now Rock House Grille, still has my heart with its deep dish pizza...it was delicious and is now just a memory. :(] Their bruschetta appetizer is very good and great to share with friends. Their signature pizookie dessert [pizza cookie cooked in a mini deep dish pan] comes topped with melting ice cream and is a tasty treat if you aren't full after your huge meal; the mix of cold ice cream and warm cookie that is crispy outside and doughy in the center is the best part."
Kevin S.,"The Woodlands, TX",114,198,42,3.0,5/14/2011,BJ's is a pretty decent place to eat at when you have a few people who cant decide or agree on one thing. The Avacodo eggrolls are probably my favorite thing about this place.
Angela D.,"Memphis, TN",6,10,,5.0,8/11/2013,Great as usual.  Tried a red velvet pizookie for the first time.  It was really good.  Def enough for two.  Can't wait to go back!!
