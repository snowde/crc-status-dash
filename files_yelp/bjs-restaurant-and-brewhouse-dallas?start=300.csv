Tila O.,"North Dallas, Dallas, TX",57,31,12,4.0,8/5/2011,"Their flat bread pizzas are perfect in my book! I've tried all of them except for the the california one. .... I'm not a fan of their seared ahi tuna salad. Their ahi tuna didn't taste fresh; it tasted ""fishy"". That's not good. So stick to the pizza which is what they're good at. And their beer isn't bad either. Try the Nit Wit - ""a traditional Belgian-style witbier. Unfiltered and spiced with orange peel and coriander."""
Arman A.,"Dallas, TX",8,5,1,4.0,6/26/2011,"They have alot of scrumptious food you can choose from , the environment is amazing , their service is usually good except when they're really busy, which isn't good! Other than that it's awesome"
Jennifer C.,"Maple Grove, MN",208,483,44,4.0,9/14/2010,"I've been to BJ's twice and I like it.  The ambiance is nice and the waitstaff are ok.  The restaurant is freezing cold so bring a sweater.  I like the bacon cheeseburger pizza and love the bbq chicken salad.  My hubby had the parmesan chicken and enjoyed that.  I will definitely go back, it is quick, inexpensive, casual American food."
Adri A.,"Dallas, TX",198,224,110,4.0,7/5/2010,"My review is for Tuesday late night happy hour ;-) Normally, I hate chain restaurants but i LoOVE  the california flatbread pizza here..  you cant beat half price glasses of wine during tuesday happy hour and half priced appetizers !

Aimee Z.,"Wylie, TX",677,661,18,3.0,12/9/2007,"I've said it before, and I'll say it again. WHERE ARE THE DAMN SUGAR CADDIES?!?!?!?!?! What the heck is with these restaurants hidding the sweet n low where you have to ask for it?  And, yes... I ordered water with lemon... What's it to ya? I still want sweet n low.  It's called free lemonade because I'm not about to pay $1.60+ for a glass of tea that it costs you less than $0.02 to make. Ok, well... after sitting in traffic for over 2 hours and paying $30 to go to Holiday in the Park for 3 hours and only get to ride one roller coaster and stand in line for an hour for gyros and another hour for funnel cake, Jenn and I decided we wanted something for a late night dinner.  We first wanted Blackfinn but were not willing to wait 45 minutes for a table. So, BJs it was. Jenn ordered a Roma Tomato Basil and Italian Sausage Thin Crust pizza that looked pretty good.  I had a Turkey Cobb Sandwich without lettuce and Steak Fries. Our waitress certainly had her mind on something else besides work.  It was a total inconvenience to her to bring me a sugar caddy and some more lemon.  Hello! If I ordered water with lemon, and I squeezed the lemon when you brought the glass to me... I will probably need another lemon when you FILL UP THE GLASS WITH LEMONLESS WATER.  Um, duh! My Sandwich had a lot of turkey on it.  The bacon was fresh, hot & crispy.  The avocado was creamy and buttery but still firm.  But the menu said there was going to be blue cheese on my sandwich.  If there was, my tastebuds couldn't find it.  There was this white stuff on the top bun, but whatever it was... it wasn't blue cheese. I really wanted a pizza, but I wanted to make my own... but I HATE deep dish pizza.  They only offer two pizzas thin crust, the rest are deep dish.  I had been to another BJ's location before and shared a deep dish pizza (it was a date, I wasn't about to say anything).. and it was ok.. but just way too much bread.  I do remember the chocolate chip cookie pizza that I shared with that date... but I'll just file that under ""memories."" As another person mentioned... the check wasn't split when the girl brought the black wallet to the table.  I put down some cash and Jenn's card and asked her to split it.  She brought back my change with two $5s and a $1.  My guess is... she only wanted $1 for a tip. Jenn and I have noticed before that it seems to be hard to find late night eats in this area without long waits for tables.  It's good to know that BJ's is there in a pinch... but... hopefully we'll have a more attentive waitress next time."
Jeannine K.,"Chicago, IL",0,122,,4.0,2/22/2013,Came back to try to gluten-free pizookie. Delicious! So nice to have a good gluten-free dessert option. I will definitely have again.
Jennifer G.,"Dallas, TX",344,608,123,3.0,12/10/2007,"BJ's is alright. I don't think it could be my first choice for Dallas/Addison dining, but when I do go its tolerable. I've gone for lunch a couple times - once we had excellent service and once was just alright. The food is usually decent. Not great, but decent. This past visit was my first ""late night"" visit to Bjs and I got the thin crust sausage pizza. Very impressed. That pizza and the potstickers are my favorite things at BJs thus far. Our server this time was pretty unattentive as Aimee already described to you. Overall - if its late and I don't want drive through and theres a huge wait at Blackfinn then this is my place. :)"
Shaun D.,"Carrollton, TX",35,38,,2.0,9/18/2011,"I want to like this place, but I just can't. I have been here four times and every time I walk out unsatisfied with the experience. The speed of the wait staff is slow and the food is simply sub par. I guess that's the compromise you make when having such a huge menu selection."
Kelicia C.,"Euless, TX",283,307,262,4.0,7/3/2010,"I like a good beer. You can ask all my girls, and they will tell you that I am in love with a good beer on a hot day. I also love to try different beers and we went to BJ's on a whim, and I was sold the minute I walked in. The location in Addison was swanky to me....I dunno why, but it was a very nice set up! I ordered the chicken alfredo baked potato which was so yummy, and I wouldn've ever thought that combo up, but it worked! The menu gives you recommendations on what beer to try with what type of dish, so I had the nutty brunette, which was delish. I think I would only have that type of beer with dinner, and when I go back, because I will, I will try one of the lighter brews. Of course, I couldn't leave without a pazookie, which is vanilla bean ice cream on top of a fresh baked chocolate chip cookie. QUICK TIP:: most desserts are for two people, but if you don't want to share, then ask for a kid size pazookie, it's half the price, half the size, and just enough for you!! YUMMY!!!  Really great place, really comfy booths, HUGE!! So i loved it.....I think you will to!"
Rick K.,"Dallas, TX",48,21,,4.0,1/30/2011,"Pretty dependable place, with something on the menu for everyone. Very nice beer selection. Sometimes, the food is a little slow, but not today."
Bobby M.,"Atlanta, GA",272,92,4,4.0,10/26/2010,"Great, inexpensive spot for a quick bite to eat. I work in Addison, so I enjoyed grabbing a salad and a pizza for less than $7. Bring your friends."
Matt A.,"Frisco, TX",5,50,1,3.0,12/17/2010,"This place to me is bi-polar...sometimes it's good and then not.  I like their pizzas, but drink prices are steep and happy hour is a joke.  I liked the decor 5 years ago, but now it's getting old.  Staff seems laid back and maybe a little too much.  I was such a fan of this place 5 years ago, but they have fallen to a maybe list and only if I have a few extra wasteful bucks."
Mark N.,"Cary, NC",3,10,,4.0,12/31/2005,"I love BJ's for one reason: a nice selection of microbrews. They don't change the beer menu very often, but I like what they have, and I think there's at least one beer for every taste. My personal favorites are the hearty Jeremiah Red and the hoppy Piranha Pale Ale, but for less adventurous palates there are some good wheat beers and a lager. For manly men there is a porter that puts hair not just on your chest, but the palms of your hands as well. The food is stock brewhouse, with burgers, pizza, comfort food, steaks, and so on. I find the pizza to be pretty high quality, and the burgers are decent. I enjoy the fact that they offer a veggie patty, as I am the lone vegetarian in the group. You can find an entree for over $10 if you try, but it's pretty easy to stay under that. I would give BJ's 5 stars, but they have one serious shortcoming. Since they seem to long to be a sports bar as well as a brewhouse, they have a pretty big bar. Addison is happy to allow smoking in the bar, and guess what? You get lots of second hand smoke everywhere in the restaurant. Experienced smoke-haters know that the staf always says ""oh you can't even detect it anywhere but in the bar"", but we also know that this is total crap - you can smell it everywhere. My wife in particular detests it, and can even pull off a migraine headache if it gets thick enough. My favorite is when being seated - we tell the hostess that we want to be as far away from the smoke as possible. Half the time, she then puts us adjacent to the bar -separated by nothing more than a four foot plexiglass barrier. Hello! I know she hasn't graduated from High School yet, but surely distance is a concept that can be understood by even the GRE crowd. Yes, the drinking crowd at the bar is just not happy unless they can blacken their lungs, and I understand that. But a five-star restaurant will spend the big bucks to completely isolate that noxious component of their clientele, and BJ's just hasn't managed to pull it off. I don't know how much it costs, but it's important to me. If it's not important to you, you have absolutely no reason not to love BJ's."
Glenn S.,"Dallas, TX",203,333,1,1.0,9/24/2006,"Restaurants With Bad Service for $100 please, Alex! First off, let me state that BJ's is a successful chain that provides tasty food and decent beer uniformly in numerous locations in many states. BJ's Beltline is not a joiner, however. It is a rebel destined to follow the beat of its own drummer. From the joy you experience when you walk in and get to wait for the hostesses to finish their conversation before they acknowledge you, to the jubilation you feel when you bite into a burger that is overcooked , yet mysteriously ice cold, you are aware that this location yearns to set itself apart. Whether you visit during the busy Addison lunch rush or a random weekday evening, you can be assured that BJ's Beltline will be doing everything it can to show your business means absolutely nothing.  Seriously folks, I have been here about half a dozen times over the last year, with the last being a Saturday at 3:30PM with no big sports events on TV ,and I have yet to get a good meal. If you want to drop $5, grab a beer, and peek at the game, you could do worse, but grab a Whataburger on the way over or you'll be sorry."
Katrina T.,"Dallas, TX",12,25,,4.0,1/18/2011,"Great variety of food. The burgers, pizza and even the salads are good."
April P.,"Dallas, TX",0,2,,1.0,9/12/2014,"I ordered curbside online for pickup at 11:15 am today with an order of their soup and salad lunch special and a turkey burger with cheese (which I paid extra to add cheese to my burger). My friend gets there at 11:20 am to pick it up and not only did my friend have to walk in because no one was coming to the curbside pickup, but they didn't have our order ready! My friend had to wait there until 11:45 to get our order. When she spoke to the manager about her frustration, all she received was an ""I'm sorry"". I am a restaurant manager myself and I have been taught you should try to rectify the situation. I'm saddened to see they didn't try to correct their mistakes. So my food got to me at noon, and like I said, I'm a restaurant manager too and was not able to eat before we started getting busy at my restaurant, so I had to eat a cold burger and then also come to find out, they did not put the cheese on my burger....the icing on the cake! Thanks BJ's.....I love your food, but I will not be returning to your location for anything in the future!"
John B.,"Dallas, TX",6,18,,3.0,3/24/2007,"I have several things to say about this place, some are good and some are bad.  First they call themselves a brewery but their beer is outrageously priced.  Second I have had bad service there on multiple occasions.  It appears to me that splitting up a ticket is a bother for the waiter/waitress.  When a bunch of young people are at your table you better expect a split check.   Ok, now to the good.  Their food has always been pretty good.  The pizza is very good and their sandwiches aren't bad either.   This is a place to go and eat lunch and have A beer."
Kelly D.,"Dallas, TX",0,2,,1.0,3/26/2013,Order an item off the LUNCH SPECIAL menu and they were not able to get this item to my table for well over 30 minutes. And when the food did finally arrive it was cold in the center. I am not impressed and the tempting commericals that are on TV right now are not what is in the restuarant.
Christine S.,"Carrollton, TX",0,2,1,2.0,3/25/2013,I used to love this place..but lately the service has been the worst. I had lunch on Sunday. Ordered the grilled chicken pasta...IT was the worst dish I have had in a restaurant in a long time...very bland and cold. Told the server and she did nothing except take my full plate of food . The bill came and they did not take it off . We had a tab over 160.00. worst customer service on the planet...too bad because I have had great food there.
Charles R.,"Middleton, WI",3,33,,3.0,8/16/2010,"BJ's is one of those chains that strives to be a more upper-class version of Applebee's.  The menu is 14 pages full of safe, reliable dishes and contains something for almost every taste. Oh yeah, they also brew their own beer and soda, which is cool. The food is good, but not outstanding.  I tried the country fried steak, which was a huge portion (two steaks) but oversalted.  It came with ""white cheddar mashed potatoes"" (the cheddar was undetectable) and veggies.  I don't see how anybody could eat that much food; I finished one steak and only a few bites of veggies but was nauseatingly full.  On another visit I tried the chicken tenders (yeah, I know chicken tenders are for kids, but I wasn't feeling very adventurous, plus it was cheap), which were pretty standard.  The problem was the fries, which were cut so thin that the potato-to-surface-area ratio was all out of whack.  I could taste no potato at all.  The wedge-cut fries would be a better bet, I think.  I also tried a bite of my companion's deep dish pizza; forgive my ignorance, but it tasted exactly like a Pizza Hut pan crust.  Not worth it. On both visits the waiters were talkative bordering on annoying.  One of them seemed mostly genuine, but the other one had a very fake positive attitude.  Both of them commented on every item ordered.  I think I would have preferred non-talking waitpeople to these guys.  The loudness of the dining room also made it a struggle to hear everything that the waiters were telling us, and to make our orders heard.   Probably the best part of my entire experience was the Pizookie (PIZza cOOKIE, get it?).  The ""deep dish cookie"" thing is becoming a trend in these types of chain restaurants, but it still hasn't gotten old for me.  Give me another five years and another hundreds chains jumping on the undercooked big-cookie bandwagon and I'll probably have changed my mind. Overall, this place is good.  But this area of Addison is completely chock-full of restaurants (most of them not as crowded and many of them locally owned), so why you would settle for BJ's overpriced, mass-produced food is a mystery. Look at that.  I didn't even make a ""BJ"" related joke."
