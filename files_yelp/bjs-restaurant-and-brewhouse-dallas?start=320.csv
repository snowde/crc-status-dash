Sandra D.,"Grand Prairie, TX",0,11,,2.0,6/27/2014,"I  had an opportunity to visit this restaurant yesterday and unfortunately it was not all that is was cracked up to be  it wasn't anything more then a sports bar. The drinks were very high priced, I had a few Long Island Ice tea's 10$ and change per drink but you wont realize it until they bring you the bill. They don't have any price's on the menu  where u can see the price of the drinks. I ordered the balsamic glazed Chicken and when it was brought out to me it looked pretty but the taste was awful the chicken was over cooked and dried out and to top it off there was a hair in one of my onion strings. My daughter had the pasta alfredo  with shrimp added in they didn't have enough sauce on the noodles and they were over cooked. The waitress Taylor was good at what she did and we told her boss thet she did a good job but the food was not worth the price at all. I would not recommend this place to anyone because of the hidden prices concerning the drinks and the menu."
Le E.,"Fort Worth, TX",124,356,42,3.0,6/29/2009,"hubby and i had weekend lunch at bj's. there was a little confusion as to what type of food was served here. we heard the burgers were great from dad-in-law and for some reason we thought it was a bbq place. to our surprise, pizza was the staple here. there are a variety of other entrees to choose from as well...pasta...sandwiches.  i opt for the chicken honey mustard salad and hubby gets the pizza with bacon and pepperoni. the portion was pretty huge for the salad. the greens were chopped in tiny pieces along with the tomatoes. i love salads that are cold and crisp and this one definitely falls in that category. the chicken was battered and fried and split into strips. my hubby's pizza looked amazing, it made my salad look all healthy. it was deep dish and i love deep dish pizza. the crust was crispy as were the bacon and pepperoni. it was cheesy goodness...and i only had a small piece.  service was mediocre. there was a little wait after our meal was done and paying the bill. the moment you would spend looking around the room and people watch. i normally don't go out for pizza. but glad i gave bj's a try."
Dean F.,"Red Oak, TX",0,23,,4.0,12/9/2010,Have been here a few times and have enjoyed it every time. They make really good pizza and have a good selection for lunch. you can also stay up to date on sports while you eat with the TV's they have.
Katherine W.,"Plano, TX",1,47,10,1.0,2/14/2010,"I've been to another BJ's once and the experience was not nearly as bad as this one. The service was slow, and the food was nasty. the chicken from the chicken fettucine alfredo tasted like Tyson's grilled chicken. And the pizza that ""supposely"" was made fresh (as told by our waitress) came with cold pepperoni. would never go there again."
Tim D.,"Lubbock, TX",126,7,6,4.0,8/24/2010,Awesome. Wish I saved room for the pizookie
Joe R.,"Andover, MA",0,15,,5.0,6/22/2010,Been to one in Aurora CO and now Addison TX. Excellent beer selection. Santa Fe Spring Rolls are delicious. Tasty entrees. I'll watch for this restaurant anywhere I go on travel.
Haley B.,"Austin, TX",90,138,24,5.0,10/24/2009,"We love this place! The beer is amazing, the only thing that frustrates me is that I always fall in love with the seasonal beer, and by the time I go back it's gone and I have to fall in love with the new one. They have a pumpkin beer now which is delicious. The pizza is awesome, last time we had some alfredo thing and it was really delicious! The atmosphere for me doesn't really do it, I prefer a more casual setting, but there are plenty of TV's for my husband to watch the game."
Stephen W.,"McKinney, TX",167,88,33,2.0,11/27/2011,"Went here with my cousin when he had to come to Texas for some training. First time I been to one that wasnt packed, odd. We grabbed a table near the bar and waitress took our order promptly. We got our first round of brews and the food came out later on. For the first 20 min the waitress was checking on us but then dissapeared for about 20 min and I was wanting another brew so we grabbed another one who assisted us....20 min later, still no sign of regular waitress.....once again we grabbed another one and asked for check....at that time here comes the regular one with check...needless to say....no big tip! Really enjoyed the seasonal pumpkin brew though and the food has always been great at any location I have been too. .....So far, out of the 5 locations I have been too, only 2 were disappointments....I'll still never get over the service I had in Lewisville with the waiter that had obviously been sniffing some cocain."
Elena C.,"Plano, TX",0,7,,4.0,7/19/2012,"I have celiac disease.. if you don't know what that is : it's basically where i can't have wheat of flour. Bj has a gluten free pizza which is really good and you can still add all the topping you want like a normal pizza. BUt the last time i went, our waitress sat us down and order our food and drinks but the drinks came out thirty minutes later and our food came out an hour later. The place wasn't really busy but my favorite part was the gluten free pizzokie. I love it! Its a hot out of the oven chocolate chip cookie with ice cream on it! yummy! That totally made my night... :)"
Todd W.,"Dallas, TX",222,233,238,4.0,7/27/2011,"little pricey but both my meals there have been great. i had this amazing ""chicken marsala"" pizza that wasn't available the 2nd time i dined here ... but wow... i dreamed about this one... lol ... i'll definitely come back."
Casey W.,"Fuquay-Varina, NC",6,7,,5.0,12/22/2009,Let's just say if I was in Addison this very moment I'd be heading to this place.  I loved all their beers and they have the best New Orleans Jambalaya I've ever had... all other places pale in comparison!
Catherine G.,"Richardson, TX",12,97,14,4.0,5/7/2011,"Ok let me preface this review by saying I LOVE the pizza here, specifically the BJ's Classic which has pepperoni, mushrooms, sausage and tomato on it. I have never had ""real"" Chicago pizza but it's thick crust, greasy and delicious. Drink specials/beer selection is always on par. Strawberry lemonade really tastes like they have a strawberry fairy in the back just churning it out. Basically, it's just great food!"
Jalynn S.,"Dallas, TX",0,3,,2.0,2/28/2012,"Where to start...the only reason we decided to go to BJ's is because of the large selection of food. Because we showed up a little after 8 there wasn't any wait time which was good, since the last time I went to BJ's, I waited a whole hour before being seated. What really made BJ's a two star experience is the waiter. God bless him but he was in another world. I asked for regular lemonade, he asked if I wanted pink or strawberry, I repeated that I wanted regular yellow lemonade and he bought out pink lemonade. The person I was dining with originally asked  for tea and water, after 2 full glasses of tea and 20 minutes later we flagged down a waitress and she poured half a glass of water. I ordered a chicken pasta plate which was BLAND! Half the broccoli was softly steamed and the other tasted and felt raw. The waiter bought out the wrong book for the ticket, inside were tickets throughout the day which included people names and credit card numbers. Our waiter once again went MIA, at that point we should of walked out the door, but it was Sunday night, and we had nothing better to do anyways. Ten minutes later he showed up and apologized. Even though he was absent-minded he was very kind, so we still tipped him the usual 20 percent. It was okay, 2 stars from me."
Chris G.,"Dallas, TX",99,202,8,4.0,6/9/2008,"I don't get why there have been bad reviews. From what I've seen of them I can say this, ignore them. They are complaining about burgers and other nonsense. This place is great for two reasons; their beers and their pizza. It's delicious. Don't waste your time on anything else. Well other than their awesome appitizers and desserts. For your main course though, stick with the pizza."
Emalie A.,"Coppell, TX",47,109,5,4.0,4/29/2009,"If you have a dirty, immature mind like me you will be giggling walking into Bj's, hehehe. My husband and I only come to Bj's for the deep dish Veggie Pizza. I have no clue if their other food is good or not, but this is one of the BEST deep dish pizzas I have ever tasted. To drink I get their Strawberry Lemonade which is delicious as fuck! Just look around at the other tables and you will see a lot of people (mostly women) drinking this shit. MMMMMMMMM! Oh and yummy beer too!"
Jess A.,"Carrollton, TX",49,107,8,3.0,4/8/2011,"Good food, good service, and good beer. This is a very solid, reliable place to get Americana food. I'd call them a step up from Chiili's, TGI, and Outback.  I've tried the fish n' chips, the open-face chili burger, and one of the burger melts. The portions are almost too big."
Eko T.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,3,1,4.0,1/22/2012,"Good steaks, nice atmosphere and great beers!"
Trace W.,"Allen, TX",5,6,2,4.0,10/14/2009,"Great pizza! Good lunch menu. Nice atmosphere.  If you're not a pizza fan, try the soup, salad, or sandwich combo.  You get two of the three, and you pretty much can't go wrong."
Meridith H.,"Dallas, TX",115,439,,2.0,7/11/2006,"Blah...that is how I felt about my burger.  It was so overcooked, it was virtually inedible.  However, the apple crisp dessert wasn't bad.  Although I like the seasoning on their fries, I am more of a thin fry girl, and the steak fries just don't do it for me.  Some of the other menu items are better and I am sure I will go back, but next time, I will probably just get a salad and dessert!"
Al D.,"Denton, TX",0,14,,2.0,6/8/2011,"First off, being a homebrewer myself I love brewpubs a lot; assuming the beers are interesting and good.  I didn't try all the beers but the handful I did try did not impress me; they weren't bad but I've had and brewed a lot better.  I didn't really like their style of pizza but I am more of a thin crust kind of guy.  The garden salad sounded good but ended up tasting like something you might get at Denny's.  I can make a better veggie burger at home.  I should have tried the angelhair pasta; sounds good; if I ever go back because someone else picks BJ's I'll try that.  Nothing was bad but nothing was great either."
