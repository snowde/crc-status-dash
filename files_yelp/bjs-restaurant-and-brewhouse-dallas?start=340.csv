Bryan A.,"McKinney, TX",2,34,,4.0,12/18/2006,"We have visited this particular BJ's quite a bit and everytime we have a good to great experience.  The pizzas are always hot and tasty, but my favorite is the Meatloaf Sandwich...wow.  It sounds small on the menu but this thing is HUGE.  Our waitrers / waitresses have always been attentive and of course the microbrews are pretty darn good too.  The location in Plano (by Collin Creek Mall) is great as well."
Ted H.,"Addison, TX",4,79,12,4.0,1/3/2006,Advacado Egg Rolls are  great.  South West spring rolls also very good.
Russ T.,"Parker, CO",0,28,,3.0,3/17/2011,"I visited BJ's on two consecutive nights while in the area on business. The Pork Chops were mighty tasty, but the raw and chewy green beans went mostly untouched. The Irish Red Ale was so good it bought me back the following evening for what was sadly a most uneventful New York Strip. Flavorful, but tough as nails. On either night, including St. Patrick's Day, it was easy enough for a single diner to belly up to the bar and get a drink and some semi-peaceful nosh."
Charles T.,"Grapevine, TX",0,26,4,1.0,12/7/2012,"Have been to this location twice as a company happy hour, the first time the wait staff argued over who would wait on us, today a group of 13 came after work. The wait staff was real quick to say we could not put 2 tables together as they were 2 stations and she reminded us she was leaving in 15 minutes (read: don't want to risk my tip to the next server). When we moved outside the new waiter was obviously having a bad day and was rude and slamming things down. He never came back with the drink order and when we asked about it he said he had ""other tables right now and was busy"". It was painfully clear that the staff makes you very aware as a customer that you don't matter. We finally had to get the manager who had to take the order because the waiter never came back. The bar staff was attentive however and make good suggestions regarding the selections. Overall the servicer is horrible and I will never go back, which is a shame because they have good food and an awesome beer selection."
Karla M.,"Dallas, TX",35,49,14,4.0,6/2/2008,"So I was attracted by the ""Chicago Style Pizza"" on their sign.  The first time I went I was not sure if I wanted to order a pizza or not because I was very hungry and did not want to be disappointed.  I had a meatloaf sandwich and my hubbie had the Cajun pasta and we both had strawberry lemonade, it was all very good.  At the end of the meal I asked the server for more lemonade, when he brought it he handed us each a ""to go"" cup filled with fresh lemonade, I thought that was cool.  After going to BJ's a few times we finally decided to order pizza, it was good but not really Chicago Style.  Other items we have tried are the crisp thin pizza appetizer cilantro pesto and fresh basil with Italian sausage, avocado egg rolls, bruschetta, angus roast beef dip, they all very good.  I also like that you can order a sample or micro brews.  I will continue to visit BJ's but not specifically for the pizza."
