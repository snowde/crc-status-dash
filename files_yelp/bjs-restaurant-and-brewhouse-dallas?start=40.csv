Bob M.,"Carrollton, TX",1141,201,156,3.0,2/22/2017,The food was really good and the waiter was good at keeping us in drinks and food. The music was just so loud you could barely hear the person across from you and the thermostat was set on 42 degrees. We requested that the music be made a little lighter and the first two times the request was made it was ignored. So if you like a freezing-cold loud place this is the place for you. Otherwise get the food to go because it's pretty good stuff.
Ashlee S.,"Dallas, TX",98,225,103,5.0,6/22/2016,The two times that I've been to this location Ive gotten takeout. The guy working takeout is very friendly and helpful. He always makes sure i have utensils and napkins and anything else I might need. The restaurant is very clean and lots of parking. Both times the food has been delicious! Will continue to go here.
Dunn J.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,1,1,4.0,9/11/2016,"Good Beer, Good Pizza, Good Atmosphere.  Visiting from Minnesota and we know about good craft beer, and these guys do it well.  Pretty quiet on a Sunday night so hard to tell how it is when they are busy, but our experience was very good. Good service, tasty food, and delicious beer.  Thumbs up"
Sephora H.,"Dallas, TX",78,33,1,4.0,11/13/2016,Good drinks and great food! This is my first visit to the chain and was a great introduction to Texas! The food came out quickly and was delicious. I will definitely be back for the food and rewards program.
Connie A.,"Addison, TX",56,18,3,5.0,1/16/2017,I come here often to watch sports with my boyfriend. Always great service and you can find something new to try everytime
Stephen W.,"Garland, TX",1,10,9,1.0,3/6/2017,"Luckily, we had an amazing server, their ""immigration walkout"" was a pain. I wanted real food. Management said we could only have flatbread...screw any company that can't maintain while enduring a walkout. Sorry, at least throw a discount to the customers for the severe inconvenience. This was total BS. I just wanted to take my girlfriend to a decent pizza and we get screwed over. Seems fair. Appreciate it BJ's, won't be back, we'll just go to Taste of Chicago"
Mike F.,"Richmond, TX",32,9,,1.0,2/17/2017,"I sat in the bar area for over 15 min. Had to go to the bar to order a drink. Then my friend showed up. He waited for over 10 min. He too had to go to the bar to order a drink, After 30 min. They showed up with menu's and told us all we could order was pizza!!! I thought Sugarland was the only BJ's with crappy service.. Starting to think it's standard SOP for all the BJ's..... Not in a hurry to go back."
Jeff L.,"El Granada, CA",32,282,9,3.0,6/18/2015,"Super nice bar tender took good care of me and I had a salad and tortilla soup later night.  Overall this is exactly what you'd expect and I like that Yelp's 3 stars is a-ok, because that is exactly what this was. The kitchen stays open late here and they have a full bar, if it had been earlier in the night (I flew in late) I would have probably been finding a local BBQ type joint, but this hit the bill."
Debbie H.,"Houston, TX",0,6,,4.0,1/31/2017,"Even though the menu is vast, the food is great!  All but 1 in our group of 21 really liked their food.  We were accommodated well with only a 30 minute heads up. Our team of 2 servers were excellent and organized, even with our separate checks (only one minor mix up which was resolved immediately.)"
Jonathan L.,"Blessing, TX",2,1,,1.0,9/25/2016,"If I could give less than one star I would. It had so much promise! Sat there for over 20 minutes and no one came to say hello sorry we are busy nothing...so on the way out we dropped off the menu to the host stand and she scoffed and said ""well okay..."" on the way out the door she yelled ""see you later!"" REALLY BJ's?! Probably won't be back...been to BJ's around the country countless times. Bj's Addison you need to work on your customer service!! I'll be sharing my experience with all my friends who live near by also!!"
Neha M.,"Garfield, NJ",800,1048,369,3.0,4/27/2015,"we came to this location after my birthday dinner, just to get some pazookies.  It was about 9pmish on a Friday, but it was not a terribly busy time. The waitress messed up on a pazookie, and then got some items mixed up on our bill.  Nothing that really upset us or made us complain to her.  I just like the location near my house more."
Amanda B.,"Dallas, TX",0,1,,2.0,10/10/2017,"This was my second time dining at BJ's restaurant. The first time, I dined in the restaurant. They brought my girlfriend the wrong dish. They were were super nice about it, and brought out the correct one within a relatively short period of time. They didn't say anything, but it was deducted off the bill as well. Both meals were delicious. This time we decided to order out. We initially tried to do delivery, or curbside order but it would not take the 20% coupon that was advertised online. We tried calling but were told because it was a third party, they could not help us. I played around with the site a little bit and realized if I did a regular take out order I could go inside to pay.  I had no issues with picking up my order and receiving the discounted price.  Unfortunately, my order was incorrect. I ordered a cheeseburger with chili/tomato/gf bun/medium rare. What I received was a plain bacon cheeseburger, well done and hopefully a gf bun.  I was very disappointed as these burgers are not cheap, especially with the add-ons. It is a huge difference to me between a medium rare burger and a well done burger.  I would be hesitant to order out from BJ's in the future."
Ashley W.,"Kansas City, MO",0,8,,1.0,7/12/2017,Horrible experience at this BJs with my coworkers. Went for their burger special. My food was OK but they forgot to add grilled onions as I had requested. My coworkers on the other hand was disgusting. The guacamole on her burger was brown and tasted very warm/old/ rotten. Her burger patty was near raw. When she commented to the waitress about it she wasn't that apologetic and didn't send over a manager to speak with us. It took forever to get our checks and when we finally got them they were incorrect. I don't recommend going here. There are plenty of local places that are much better.
Kevin S.,"Dallas, TX",27,179,39,3.0,4/25/2015,"My daughter and I enjoy going here. We both get the same thing-either pizza or burgers. Both are pretty good most of the time. I do think the pizza might be a little overpriced.  I usually have good service here. Some nights it can get pretty busy, especially in the bar area."
Beth E.,"Dallas, TX",132,19,,5.0,9/7/2016,"Every time I have been to Bj's the food has been great! Their chicken tortilla soup is by far the best I've ever had. The food is always quick and correct,and I can usually find a half off coupon so it's great food for super cheap!! Tip you waiters lol :)"
Jeff N.,"Dallas, TX",5,32,87,3.0,6/25/2016,"Went here this evening for dinner with friends. I've never had an amazing dining experience here; however, I have never expected it to be the highest quality in food as well.  The atmosphere and decor is what one would expect from any large chain restaurant franchise i.e. Friday's, Chili's, etc. It also hasn't changed in years, so in my eyes it may be time to freshen up the look of the restaurant.  Service was good. Our server was prompt, polite and courteous. Food came out in a reasonable time frame and she was good about checking with us.  The food is where things could use some improvements. We had several of the veggie apps like the portobello mushrooms, artichoke bites, and Brussel sprouts. The artichokes tasted kind of sour and the Brussel sprouts tasted and looked burnt. I had the ribs and they were mediocre. They were dry and tasted and looked like they were sitting under a heat lamp all evening. Wasn't terrible but definitely not amazing either.  I would still come back here for a nice casual dinner hanging out with friends but if I'm planning on looking for an amazing meal, this won't be on my list of tasty dinners to try."
Jim P.,"Grapevine, TX",1,44,8,5.0,5/22/2015,"Have visited several BJ locations in the DFW area and all of them..yes all...have great wait staff and maintain a wonderful refreshing selection of their own as well as leading brand craft beers. Along with a great beer selection they have a fully stocked bar and make great recommendations when asked as to a specialty mixed drink. I have tried both multiple times.  Happy Hour apps are a great buy along with their wine, beer, and mixed drink selections.  A sign of a great restaurant is the capacity loading - I have never visited a BJ location where it wasn't packed and usually a quick wait.  Job Well done! I would recommend BJ at any location for a visit..."
Mike B.,"Dallas, TX",1,35,24,1.0,10/25/2016,I'm a fair person but tonight I ordered takeout and apparently the quality and presentation of their food disappears after 10p. Their server thought it was humorous that my order was screwed over. They seem to me at least not to prioritize a patron's experience in their establishment. Try TGIF is down the street and open late as well.
Monique S.,"Dallas, TX",43,124,123,4.0,2/12/2016,Visiting out of town and came in here on my birthday (Feb 4th) for lunch. Sat at the bar and i believe her name is Trina was very nice. Food was great and so were the drinks i had. I even got a free birthday cookie with ice cream on top. Service was great. I would come back again. Relaxed atmosphere too.
Jim H.,"Westerville, OH",26,336,45,4.0,3/8/2015,"I'm a fan of BJ's and have dined in a number of other BJ's but I really want to compliment the staff at this BJ's.  We walked in without any reservations and asked if they could accommodate a party of 12-15 people -- we weren't even sure how many were going to show up.  The staff was extremely professional and TOTALLY UNFLUSTERED by our request.  They immediately started pulling some tables together (granted - it was a Tuesday night and they weren't packed but they handled our request with the  utmost professionalism).  Our party did ultimately include 15 people and they assigned 2 waiters to handle our group. The wait staff concentrated on  drink orders and appetizers first and then moved to our dinner orders. The staff was attentive and took extremely good care of us. The drinks and appetizers came out promptly and our entrees followed without any delays.  With a group of this size - suffice it to say we ordered a variety of entrees ranging from salads to pizzas, to burgers, etc.  Everyone was well pleased with their meal and with the service. I'm still impressed with the staff's ability to handle a party of 15 without any stress or fuss.  Thanks."
