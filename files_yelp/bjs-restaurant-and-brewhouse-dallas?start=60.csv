Sunny H.,"Richardson, TX",0,2,1,1.0,1/22/2017,"Service was very slow, and waitress was late in getting our orders. My group ordered jambalaya, large pizza, and a ahi salad. However, the salad was missing the avocados, the pizza was VERY cold, and our jambalaya ended up going to another table. When we addressed these mistakes to our waitress, she gave us an attitude. Not only that, she said that she would bring it right out, but she never came and we had to ask another waiter to bring it out (this was before she stopped by our table 5 times EMPTYHANDED). I understand that the food mistakes were not the waitress's fault, but it's more upsetting when the waitress talks back at her table."
Al R.,"Carrollton, TX",28,205,29,5.0,2/25/2015,"Stopped in for an early dinner. My wife and I ordered the potato skins and potstickers. Both were very good! The potstickers had good quality meaty centers with a slightly firm and crisp outside! The potato skins I have had before and are awesome. They do something extra to make them crispy on the outside and soft inside!  The Chicago style 5 meat pizza was very good. Cooked perfectly with an amazing buttery crispy outside edge.  My wife enjoyed a salad with chicken that was a pretty large portion even for a dinner meal. She enjoyed the flavor and everything was fresh.  You can't go to BJ's without getting the cookie dessert which is always awesome! The server was very attentive, pleasant and followed up just enough to be helpful and not intrusive."
Steven J.,"Richardson, TX",1,39,41,3.0,9/21/2016,"It's BJs... The food is good, but not great. It is a consistently good chain restaurant that in my opinion has locked down a three star for the rest of my life in terms of quality. Even if your waiter sucks- the food is 3 stars. I guess you could go and have an absolute blast with your friends and then drunkenly rate it 4 stars. With that being said I love BJs... I'll be back... but I will probably rate it 3 stars again because that is what it consistently delivers."
Vlad I.,"Austin, TX",1,14,,2.0,9/13/2016,Sat in the bar area.    They were not busy and I want to preface this by saying I have been to several BJ's prior to this.   Ordered an appetizer-20 mins go by and the waitress tells me they messed up the order but we're going to remake but need time to prepare it.    30 seconds later the order comes out fried behind belief.   Hardly edible.  I said apparently they thought frying it I recognizably would cover the mistake.   Next entree shows up 10 seconds later like if the order was done right how could I eat and digest quick enough.    Well That order was messed up too.  Wish I could have told the waitress but she was in the back for 10 mins.  I recommend BJ's.    Just not this one.   Really bad experience when you have so Many other choices    Just my .02
David H.,"Plano, TX",0,10,2,2.0,4/6/2017,"The service was so slow despite the fact that the restaurant was less than 1/2 full. We waited a long time before the waiter came out, and a long time before the drinks came. I had to ask for my drink again, my entrée came out at 45 minutes before my salad. When asked for salad, it came wit the salad had dried out. I had to ask for the soup. So, my food came in reverse order. It took my wife and I 1 hour 20 minutes to get our lunch and get out of that place. The ribs were burnt. The Jambalaya was dried. It was such a disappointed experience. I will not come back to this place and perhaps BY restaurants."
Stephanie B.,"Fort Walton Beach, FL",0,1,,1.0,4/5/2017,Waiter was pre occupied with hostess instead of tending to his tables. Order a medium well steak and got a rare steak.  Worse BJ's I've ever been to.
Pam S.,"Dallas, TX",214,1,,5.0,10/3/2016,Love coming here! Food and service is always great! Ask for Jeff he's an awesome server and Cameron the manager is a blast to talk to
Judy J.,"Dallas, TX",0,3,,1.0,9/30/2016,"I've loved this place since it opened.  Their Asian Chicken Salad and Onion Rings were a religious experience.  I've had many business lunches, dinners, high school reunions there over the last decade or so.  My last two times there were so sad.  I even Asked the manager about the food-- were these ""off days"" or did the menu change?  Unfortunately it was the latter.  I won't go back.  So sad.  It's so unusual for an old fat lady to have preferred that Asian salad to anything else on that (old) incredible menu!!  I'll really miss it"
Ada C.,"London, United Kingdom",137,562,222,2.0,10/11/2014,"Got takeout from here while at a work meeting.  The clam chowder was gloopy and clearly the condensed stuff from a bag. It was also very salty.   The Cobb salad was a sad mixture of the usual stuff (avocado, bacon etc) but on a bed of thinly sliced iceberg lettuce. YUCK."
Karylin P.,"Dallas, TX",0,3,,1.0,3/3/2017,I love Bj's but the service at this location is terrible. I've gotten bad service here multiple times and the managers just stand around and don't really do anything to help.
Carson S.,"Las Colinas, TX",236,42,9,4.0,8/9/2015,Good location and great service. Ordered to go and showed up within 10 minutes and my order was just finishing up. Had a nice conversation with the to go staff and the food was great. Wish I could have stayed at the bar but still I recommend this location!
Johnson L.,"Dallas, TX",169,121,90,4.0,10/2/2014,"My boss decided to come here and treat us for lunch, which means is a free meal. Every time I came here I always order a root beer since they brew their own root beer. But guess what, the waiter told me that they run out of root beer that day:(. So he recommend me to get the cream soda. So I will have to get that instead. Well, the cream soda was sweet taste pretty decent. But I am sorry I like the root beer better.  So now let's go to the food. I am feeling a little bit too hungry so I order the jambalaya. The last time I have jambalaya was the fried jambalaya from state fair. Well this one is good but can't compare to the fried jambalaya from state fair. I don't think anywhere in Dallas will have better jambalaya then state fair. So this one is serve on a big plate, have shrimp, chicken and rice. The spice level was just enough for me. So overall, this jambalaya to me is really good. But Next time anyone go to BJ. You have to order their root beer or their beer because it taste so good since they brew their own."
Dee D.,"Dallas, TX",0,11,,1.0,3/5/2017,"Yoo this the worse pizza I've had in my life. No hyperbole. I bought the large BJ's favorite for like 30 bucks. Shit was a bready moist pile of the first word in this sentence. They said it was supposed to be Chicago style, it tasted like Toastinos (or however u spell it.) They need to close this restaurant ASAP b."
Carrie O.,"Carrollton, TX",0,4,,1.0,2/4/2017,Usually this place is on top of things but tonight couldn't have been worse. Hostess talked down to people as they entered. The wait staff is unaware of people around them. Our waitress literally had no idea what she was doing. Asked if I wanted a side salad with my entree salad. Then completely forgot to bring the food out. Had to ask multiple times for refills. Then when the manager came over didn't seem to care. So I will not return here. Thanks for the gift card but I wanted to food and experience with my family.
Gen H.,"Dallas, TX",1,15,3,1.0,2/18/2017,Didn't even get to try the food at this location because our server never came to our table after we were seated. The hostess didn't listen to the question I asked when we walked up the counter and gave me a random response but greeted the older couple that came in after us very warmly and sat them down BEFORE us. We were sat in the back corner of the restaurant where the only tables that were frequented by a server were full of people not of our color. I'm never coming back to this location as it seems the color of your skin matters more than the color of your money.
eric m.,"Dallas, TX",246,59,21,1.0,6/14/2015,"I've had terrible service before but BJs just broke a new record. We had a party of 15 people along with a reaervation, they didn't have a place to seat us when we got there and we all had to sit at the tables at the bar It took at least 30 minutes before ordering our food and then another hour after ordering before receiving our food.  Not to mention we never received our appetizers and two in our group of never received their entree.  I couldn't see this chain staying in business in too long, granted the food wasn't half bad, nothing special but not bad. But due to the service I definitely will not be going back"
Michelle-Juan T.,"Carrollton, TX",5,8,,5.0,7/4/2016,"Full tummies, and happy faces were the end results of bringing my children here for dinner. It was quit a comfortable and relaxed atmosphere,  and the food was (for my children) very enjoyable. I originally brought them here to collect on an awarded meal my son had received from school.  Left with two full children, and an achievement award pin they gave my son, along with a couple of great jobs, and high 5's. We will definitely be returning."
Johnathan B.,"Dallas, TX",72,18,2,1.0,7/19/2016,"If you want to deal with servers that that throw your ID down once they check it and gossip about you to other employees when you question them about their service then go to this location. I left immediately, never again."
Yesenia H.,"Dallas, TX",14,20,9,1.0,5/14/2016,"Worst customer service ever! First, the hostess did not speak to us, so we were confused as to where we were going. Second, the waiter was mute as well. He did not make eye contact and instead of verbally responding to something he would just nod. Third, I told the manager about it and he did NOTHING! He pulled the waiter aside and gave a slap on the wrist. Food was great, but the service was horrible."
Sohail H.,"Addison, Dallas, TX",211,19,43,1.0,4/11/2015,Had a really bad experience last night ! First had a piece of glass in my drink !! Server never got us plates when the food came and for desert instead of asking they had no vanilla ice cream he brought us chocolate ice cream which messed up entire meal !  Was always a fan of bjs but this experience was horrible !
