Justin P.,"Hurst, TX",176,15,2,4.0,3/29/2016,"BJ's is one of my go-to American fare restaurants. I previously worked at the location in Plano, TX. Some of my favorite menu items: pizza (of course), roast beef dip, burgers, honey crisp chicken salad, the flatbreads, and beer. They have some great quality beers for decent prices. Currently, at least some locations are giving 20% off your check if you pay through the Mobile app- which is pretty cool. The service is generally good, wouldn't say I've had anyone outstanding or terrible, just average. It can get pretty busy at lunchtime but they are prepared for it and food generally comes out just as quick, if not quicker, than dinner or off-peak times."
Steve P.,"Sachse, TX",0,6,1,1.0,4/3/2015,"Absolutely the worst service ever. Waiter dumped an entire glass of ice water on my lap. Manager came by. Inquired about my phone, which also got soaked. Only offered more towels. If I wasn't with a group, I would have walked out immediately. Slow service. Awful waiter kept walking by and touching the check, which was in full. Just an absolutely embarrassing lunch."
Ashley G.,"Dallas, TX",1,12,2,5.0,12/20/2016,"This review is about the manager (although BJ's pizookies are the bomb) that was working today, 12/20, at around 12pm. I went in to buy a gift card.... why during lunch I don't know. :) It took forever because it was lunch time, and there were some new trainees. People were getting upset about the wait time for their pick up food and I was getting a tad frustrated about the wait time to buy a gift card. The manager came out and helped fix everything for everyone. He looked crazy busy and was helping move things along faster and was just so nice! Not just nice because that's what you do...just genuinely a nice guy. I've been out of the service industry for a while now and sometimes I tend to forget just how crazy things can get and what a thankless job it can be... especially during the holidays when people can be even worse for some reason. Thank you manager today! You are awesome. I hope the rest of your day was less crazy and that you get a huge bonus and raise in 2017!"
Albert C.,"Deer Park, TX",0,5,,4.0,6/22/2016,"Good atmosphere, the drinks were great, food was pretty good too. Server was very attentive. We were a party of 8, drinks were refilled timely and apps came out on point."
Cynthia C.,"Austin, TX",227,462,269,3.0,1/30/2014,"If you like long waits for average food & service, this is your place.  Parking on a weekend  night, is... horrendous.  Large group of us were told that it'd be a 15 minute wait. After waiting over 30 minutes, we decided to take matters into our own hands and found ourselves tables at the bar.   Anyways, food was consistent with the other BJ's chains. Pizza is nice & greasy. Other food was on par & decent. Shoestring fries if you like those :)  Best tip ever: COOKIES & CREAM PIZOOKIE. delicious!!!  They have happy hour & late night happy hour (after 9pm)  for those who are interested :)"
Cyril R.,"Dallas, TX",0,5,,1.0,6/8/2016,"This location used to be pretty good. I don't know what happened but the waitstaff are now racist and lazy. The kitchen is incapable of not mixing up orders between tables. The hostesses are all indifferent and rude. Also got fraudulently charged $30+ for food that my table did not order. Thanks for forcing me to cancel my credit card, BJs! Never returning to this location."
Christopher L.,"Princeton, TX",2300,644,44,3.0,12/16/2014,"I went in with pretty low expectations.   The couple of times I have been to a BJ's it has been really loud and the food and service less than stellar.  We were here for a (work) team holiday lunch with 12 people, so noisy was going to be a problem.  Instead, we found ourselves seated in the room separate from the main dining area which was relatively quiet.  We had a couple of different wait staff helping with drinks and food, and all were attentive and polite.  One of our party had the wrong food delivered (his went to another table or something), so it was not a perfect service since we all kind of waited for him to get his dish replaced.  My food was good, a double burger with one beef and one turkey patty along with thin fries.  It was nice of them to accommodate the mix of beef and turkey, and the flavor combo was much better than either by itself.  All in all, an OK experience."
Lauren O.,"Addison, TX",146,20,5,1.0,1/21/2015,"Glad the pizza was good because the service wasn't.  Went to dinner with my boyfriend (as usual) and the dining experience started out great! We sat down immediately, our app came quick and the drinks were constantly full. I ordered a salad to start, a burger for my entree and my SO got a pizza.  The food came out, minus the salad. When I asked about the salad, the server looked caught off guard, and it was obvious it was never entered in so, I told him to not to bother...and my burger was wrong. When I brought up what the burger was missing, the server had a rebuttal.  As he began to head to the kitchen to get the missing cheese and onion. I had to ask him to take the plate with him, I didn't want a cold piece of cheese on my burger, I wanted it melted, like how it comes when you order a cheeseburger. By this point I wasn't excited about my dinner anymore. I asked another server to let our server know, that I no longer wanted my burger that I had sent back. Simply because I came to dinner, with my boyfriend, to enjoy the experience together. So, I decided to just help my boyfriend eat his pizza.  The manager came over to deliver the burger. As he kept trying to put it down in front of me, we kept telling him ""no thanks."" He kept persisting it would be it would be free of charge, we said ""no thanks"" again and he just walked away.  That wasn't the point, I would gladly pay full price and I understand mistakes happen but don't make the customer feel like it was their mistake when I in fact placed the order right and half of my meal didn't make it out in the first place!  Moreover, while he was there and as a manager, the least he could have done was offer us a second share plate (since the two of us were eating off one small plate) or a refill on our drinks that were empty and from that point forward we were ignored.  It wasn't until moments later our server finally came back with new refills when we asked for a box and the check. When he brought the check back he finally made mention of this mistake after disappearing for some length of time.  When he dropped the check he offered a free dessert on him. Nice gesture, however, we aren't the type of people that are out for a freebie, if you make a mistake during the course of the meal apologize for it and make it right.  I felt belittled as a customer I asked for my burger to be made right. With the response ""well this is how it's made"" when I asked for it to be modified when I first ordered. What is the point in even taking my order and I didn't ask for anything crazy! No tomatoes, add cheese and onion! The whole way it was handled by the server and the manager was a joke and I'm super disappointed in this restaurant."
Javier M.,"Plano, TX",2,35,6,3.0,4/10/2016,"I had the chicken barbeqoa It was kinda spicy and the flavors are ok. Not the best tasting food for me. The service  was ok, and the place was freezing."
Lynn B.,"Tacoma, WA",0,4,,3.0,10/18/2016,I've always had a good meal at BJ's. The service is always quick and friendly. When we stopped at this BJ's the service was a bit slower and the food was decent.
Kelsey C.,"Olathe, KS",269,534,224,4.0,4/3/2015,"great staff here, pretty good food. We enjoyed the frito nachos (but it's suuuper small) and the southwest egg roll appetizers. I really enjoyed the hefeweizen and their skinny fries. The California burger was just OK."
Eric J.,"Fremont, CA",95,446,475,4.0,5/10/2012,"Huge place! Great atmosphere. People of all ages, shapes and sizes really seemed to be enjoying themselves.  Of course, I love the fresh brewed beers! Very nice selection of bottled beers as well. The menu has a little of everything! I had the Cajun pasta with shrimp which was enough to feed 2 to 3 people! I ate most of it and had the rest for breakfast the next day. The service was excellent."
Julie H.,"Dallas, TX",48,27,24,2.0,1/10/2016,Service sucks here! Waited 40 min just for our appetizer. We came on a Sunday afternoon. It's shouldn't take that long.
Jon L.,"Addison, TX",197,243,248,2.0,10/22/2015,"Made the mistake of getting there an hour before closing, and you know what that means: servers wanting to make sure you're out of there quickly. Ours made it clear that he had had a long day, and it showed. The ahi poke app was quite good - fresh and decent portion for the money. Then things went downhill. Our deep dish pizza did the impossible: it made Cici's Pizza look generous with tomatoes and cheese. BJ's veggie pizza is basically bread and green peppers. You need a microscope to find sauce, cheese, tomatoes, or any other toppings. Then when we went to order dessert, our waiter was AWOL. When he finally arrived over ten minutes later, he said since it's a couple minutes past closing, the kitchen can't make any Pazookies for dessert. I have a hard time believing that their equipment was shut off and inoperable so quickly, but whatever, customer service comes last, I guess. In their defense, my kids like their burgers and salads and said I was a fool to order the pizza - everyone knows it sucks. Why didn't they tell me this beforehand? Cuz they're kids - ugh! Besides, what was I doing in a place with a three star rating? I should know better than not to trust my fellow Yelpers, especially when there are over 250 ratings."
Judi H.,"Dallas, TX",0,9,,1.0,10/30/2016,"I love their pizza, and some of their salads, but apparently they have no interest in single people dining by themselves. I went into BJ's in Addison at 2:30 on a Sunday afternoon. There was hardly anyone there, and I got seated immediately, but no waiter came by to bring me water or take my order. I was OK with that, because it was obvious they were short staffed; however, after approximately 15 minutes, 2 groups of people (one with 7 people, the other with 8) came into the section where I was sitting and as soon as they were seated, they got immediate service. When I made eye contact with the waiter who had taken the orders from the first table and was now on the second table, he said, ""Look lady, we're short staffed and I'll get to you when I'm done here"". Needless to say, I didn't wait. They need to get their act together, and to do what other restaurants do, which is to provide service in the order in which you're seated."
Reba G.,"Dallas, TX",567,688,556,3.0,6/3/2013,"Do not come here if you are going on a lunch break, you will be gone for a very long time.  Service takes forever. On the plus side, they have a HUGE menu with everything you can think of.  The menu is extremely overwhelming, but their pizzas are pretty good.  I ordered half an order of the chicken flatbread, and it was pretty good.   This is a cool place to drink at with your friends though."
Anna W.,"Plano, TX",3,10,1,5.0,2/27/2016,"Great variety of items on the menu. Everyone in our party loved their selections. I have Ahi tuna salad, which was awesome. Great, fast service!  They were quite busy tonight yet we got seated and served very quickly. Our teens eat there often and were the ones who made mom and dad try it. Will definitely return."
Drew F.,"Dallas, TX",11,1,,2.0,3/18/2016,"Front of house leaves a lot to be desired. Young kids who don't have much concern for their establishment, we waited 10 minutes to be seated in a half empty house. The one waiting the table was better, but only slightly. The food and drinks are of course good, they're a well established chain. But they failed whereby hey should have tried hardest."
Philip C.,"Frisco, TX",88,157,,3.0,1/24/2013,"I don't know, I can't say I am a huge fan of BJs food but they have stellar service and a very good sized menu.  I have been there a few times for birthdays and meet ups, and they do have a nice offering for big groups of people. The Pizza was decent, great beer selection, salads were sub part, appetizers were quite delicious though.  The burger was ok... I mean just overall the food was just sub par decent.  Nothing to get too excited over.  If anything I think the restaurant has good service and I usually respect establishments that can successfully take care of a table of 10+ without too much complaint, and I have been there about 2-3 times with tables of that size. I view them as a Cheese Cake factory with beer instead of Cheese Cake.  They don't really have a big specialty when it comes to food, but they make a TON of it.   Actually I take that back, CCF is pretty effing delicious. As a side note, when I was in college I was in this business class where people had to pitch business proposals.  This one girl named her Dry Cleaning delivery ""BJ Services"".  You can't make this crap up.  So now whenever I see BJ all I can think of is that poor girl choosing that poor business name and I can't help but laugh my ass off."
Jeanine B.,"Plano, TX",0,9,,2.0,9/14/2016,"Nice place - huge - bright and clean.  Ordered chips and queso as I thought it was on the $3 happy hour - learned later those HH Specials are only if you are sitting at the bar??? Why was that card in the table menus?  Did not see that fine print - misleading.  Had Caesar salad - stick to bar food here - friends had salmon - OK - not great.  Not cheap - $15.95 for a salad with chicken.  The worst part was the SERVICE!   This was probably some of the s l o w e s t service I've ever had - took forever to get a drink, ice tea refill , the check - I won't go back here - they need to get it together!"
