Sanford L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,20,1,5.0,11/29/2017,"I am never disappointed in BJ's service and food.  I eat at the one in Coral Springs Fl. and the one in Daytona when we are up there to visit. The Pizza are great, and there Deep Dish Ziti, you have to try it,  GOOD TO THE LAST BITE! The staff are friendly and helpful. You got me, love the place at either locations."
Nora M.,"Port Orange, FL",163,156,571,4.0,11/7/2017,"I like this place, it's like good bar food. And their pizza is one of my favorites, especially the buffalo chicken one. Yumm. And they are the best during happy hour. Mon-fri: 3-7 & Sun-mon: 10-close in the bar area. Most of the appetizers, flatbreads and mini pizzas are half off. And I love appetizers, so I usually order 3-5 of those and get to take some back home with me. With the huge verity for a foodie lover, I'm happy. lol The atmosphere is pretty nice and casual. And it's great for meeting up with friends.  I'm a regular here, and I recommend that u try it at least once."
Tari T.,"Orange City, FL",11,26,4,5.0,10/2/2017,"The decor is as provocative as the menu. Lots to look at and talk about. The hostess greeted us with a smile and the VIP question. Seems if you sign up with the app you can earn points. And with our first time trying and signing up with the app we gots us some freebies! Hubs got the portobello mushroom burger and he was near tears. His burger came with a as-big-as-his-burger mushroom on top, which was grilled to perfection. I got the buffalo bbq burger and it was amazing. Our beers were dark; Porter and Tatonka.  Both amazing. Porter was smooooth. Tatonka was a smidgeon sweet but hoppy. Loved them both.  Our freebie was the Pizookie. Salted Carmel. But the choices were difficult. Monkey Bread Pizookie would be our next pic. But there's something for everyone. OMG amazing!  Taylor our server was the best. We couldn't make up our mind about the dozen choices in beer and she let us test a little shot of them. She was friendly and helpful and just a joy to chat up.  For our freebie dessert we chose the Salted Carmel Pizookie. There are just no words for how awesome it was.  The place was clean and comfortable. This was a delightful experience."
Stef B.,"Ormond Beach, FL",49,73,93,5.0,9/3/2017,"I came here for dinner one night because I heard great things about this place - I was excited to try since we have none in NY. It was pretty busy for a week day night but my dad and I got seated right away. The inside has lots of seating available. Between my dad and I, we got beverages, two entrees and dessert and it all cost us under $40. I was prepared and had a coupon for a free entree with purchase of 2 beverages. Check out their website before coming here because they will post coupons and specials that they have. The food was better than I imagined. Several vegetarian options - I got the veggie tacos with a grain salad - so delicious and fresh. My dad got a chicken dish which he really enjoyed.  Then of course we had to end the night with a trio of pizookies (that's what everyone comes for). We got the chocolate chip, peanut butter and the monkey bread. Each one is topped with ice cream as well. My dad and I surprisingly liked the monkey bread the best. Overall, great food, excellent service and environment, and fair prices if you come when there are specials. I definitely will be coming back again!"
Don V.,"Hinckley, OH",0,8,4,2.0,1/5/2018,"Went with local Daytona Beach friends who recommended BJs. Not that impressed  My BJ draft beer had a good flavor but was flat.  Our friends burger patty was so thin we joked that it was like 4 White Castle patties connected together.  Each meal of four came out at a different time.  Food tasted OK, but nothing I'd rush to have again. After 4 weeks dining around the area, this was the low point."
Jim B.,"Hampstead, NC",39,25,80,4.0,12/24/2017,Nice place with lots of different menu choices. Anything from hamburgers and tacos to pizza and prime rib. Nice bar area with a nice atmosphere.
Sharmain R.,"Altamonte Springs, Orlando, FL",42,73,286,5.0,9/30/2017,"It's been a while since I visited this location on my way to the beach.  As usual, BJ's never disappoints me.  I was able to seated right away during the lunch hour.  I was greeted by my server shortly after being seated.  The service was quick and efficient.  I had the lunch special of half soup and half flatbread.  The Chicken Tortilla soup is delicious.  And the California Cobb flatbread is scrumptious.  And of course, who can resist having a Pizookie, right?  However, I decided to try something different.  In all of my BJ's visits, I have never tried the Baked Beignet.  Soooo.............................this definitely is a tiebreaker.  It was to die for!!  I don't know which I like best now.  It's either the Monkey Bread Pizookie or the Baked Beignet. Can anyone help me out??  I need a tie breaker. Love ya to pieces, BJ's!!"
Christopher C.,"Conshohocken, PA",166,1315,6419,3.0,6/6/2017,"While I'm not a huge believer in Gordon Ramsey, I do buy into one of his most basic ideas that you see him talk about on TV all the time.  It's really hard to be all things to all people when it comes to a restaurant menu.  Better to do ten things well then do a hundred things half-assed.   Clearly BJ's didn't read that memo because it's a little weird to be given a menu that has page numbers on it due to the sheer size/volume of what your being handed.  This is the War and Piece of restaurant menus.  I don't know how many entree items are on the menu but I read an article online that said the chain cut just their entrees down from 181 to 150 three years ago.  150!  And that's just the entrees!  Holy Crap! So we came in just before nine on a weeknight and overall the restaurant was fairly dead.  Lots of TV's everywhere with everything on them from college baseball to hockey to basketball.  Add in music turned up fairly loud and ripping A/C and this is definitely not a spot that you're going to be having a quiet intimate conversation at. The best part of the meal was the service.  It was solid from front to back.  I chalk part of that up to the restaurant being dead but overall our server was very good.   As for the food: Spinach and Artichoke Dip - Overall fairly flavorless.  Lots of chips while the dip was mostly a greasy/oily/room temperature/flavorless mess. Small Cheese Pizza - This is the ultimate ripoff at over eight dollars.  Four small micro slices.  In the real world you could get a pizza twice the size for the same price. Cherry Chipotle Glazed Samon & Spicy Peanut Chicken with Soba Noodles - The people who ate both of these were very happy with both the flavor and the large portion size. Shrimp & Asparagus Penne - You would think that these things would work well together but honestly I'm not so sure about that.  The marinara sauce is so strong, acidic and bitter that you can't taste anything else.   The other issue here which needs to be discussed are the prices.  The food is way, way overpriced for what it is.  Like I referenced earlier, over eight dollars for a small four slice pizza with the other entrees being over sixteen dollars a piece.  I guess that would be good if everything were great but it's not.  Some portion sizes are really large while others are very small.  Some things have good flavor while others taste like nothing.  That's a lot of dough for food which is this uneven. Within the last year close to home a BJ's opened up about thirty minutes away.  I haven't been there yet and honestly after seeing what this location is about I'm good with not hurrying over because the menu prices are high for what you get and I honestly think that they would be smart as a chain to cut down maybe half the menu. While not horrible, our experience at BJ's wasn't a great value either.  Three stars all the way."
Simi W.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,5,,5.0,1/1/2018,"I was visiting Daytona on vacation. Normally we go to the BJ's in Dublin, Ca that's in our neighborhood....the wait there is painful. Food is mediocre. But this location in Daytona, Fl was the bomb:) I ordered the crispy jalapeño burger with fries....and they were amazing!!! The wait was less than 10 minutes too. Great service!"
Melissa N.,"Orlando, FL",2394,466,1774,3.0,3/11/2017,"BJ's is pretty good. It's a little more upscale than your regular chain restaurant.  This location is spacious and trendy. I do like the modern bar. They have an extensive specialty cocktail and craft beer menu. Even though I didn't try anything, they all looked interesting. They can make almost anything vegetarian, if you ask. We shared a vegetable flatbread. It was okay. I think I would re-order it next time I visit.  We paired it up with a super salad. I would have preferred a different dressing instead of the apple vinaigrette. Overall, not bad. 3 stars."
Ken S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,1,3.0,12/29/2017,"The picture of the menu did not look like my actual burger.  They really skimped on the cheese.  The waitress did not come soon enough for me to complain.  I spoke to the manager and he was very nice.  They want to make sure your experience is great.  The place was very busy, the taste was great."
Emely M.,"Palm Coast, FL",28,13,1,5.0,11/24/2017,Tonight was our 1st meal here and we ate at the bar Ashley the bartender made sure everything was amazing i highly recommend eating here and taking Ashley's recommendations A+++++
Catherine B.,"Daytona Beach, FL",6,13,,3.0,9/14/2017,I have been here several times for lunch if you go for a early or late lunch its not so bad but peak times or holidays be prepared to wait. the wait staff is friendly but not always great about knowing about the meals or how they are cooked or ingredients important if you have allergies. beer is great. generally the music is way to loud for myself and often I have to talk really loud for my friends to hear me or the wait staff. The food is great and reasonable but some days just not worth a wait in the heat outside. parking is often a issue at peak times. you may have to park a ways from the building
Aldo B.,"Vacaville, CA",2,3,,3.0,11/24/2017,"Let's see where I start, food at BJs is delicious and quality is consistent. But there's seems to be a disconnet when either you make an online order on at the restaurant. Quick example today, ordered a BJ's Favorite Pizza extra pepperoni. Tou guess it, no extra pepperoni"
Bvibum E.,"Atlanta, GA",0,63,4,1.0,2/19/2017,"Small portions, large prices. Side of asparagus consists of 6 skinny stalks. Deep dish pizza had basically no cheese. If you are going to charge $20 bucks, ya might want to have a little quality control. Shaking my head wondering how in today's economy they can charge premium  prices and skimp on the food"
Matt Z.,"Daytona Beach, FL",0,68,70,5.0,11/29/2017,This restaurant is fantastic and has never disappointed us. The menu is abundant and the beer is cold.
Ashley B.,"Creedmoor, NC",15,7,2,5.0,11/10/2017,Excellent customer service. Great atmosphere. Great food. I will most definitely visit again. Oh  try the avocado rolls. They are to die for.
C. L. R.,"Donnelly, ID",1,23,14,1.0,6/13/2017,"Even though I read reviews about BJ'S service, or rather lack thereof, hubby and I decided to give it a try.  Well, sad to say I can't review the food because we never got waited on.  Simply unacceptable.  Will never go back."
Patricia L.,"St. Augustine, FL",258,244,1434,5.0,8/20/2016,"We love BJ's!  We love the atmosphere, the menu, the wait staff and the prices!  This place is huge, so even when the parking lot looks full...you can probably still get a table.  Don't forget they have a more than ample bar! We normally try things from the Small Bites Menu since we normally only need something small when we go there.  Everything is delicious.  Our personal favorite is the Honey Sriracha Brussels Sprouts.  I love Brussel sprouts anyway, but to take a perfectly healthy item and make it so ""apply to the thigh good"" is amazing!  Even if you don't like these normally...give them a try, you'll get addicted!  We get them every time we go! On our last visit we ate a little more than normal...again!  My husband had a burger with fries and our son had a cheeseburger...both were absolutely delicious!  Their fries rock!  I, however, had a pizza and it was amazing! The wait staff is wonderful and perfectly attentive. They seem to have that perfect ""thing"" down to make sure you are never on empty drink wise.  And they don't come to see how your meal is when your mouth is full.  BJ's everywhere seems to have this in common. OK...drum roll...they give a uniformed discount and they have a free rewards program.  Both are reasons alone to return again!  Of course we'll be back...we love the Honey Sriracha Brussels Sprouts too much to not go back. Honey Sriracha Brussels Sprouts - YUMMY!  Apply to the thigh good!!!"
Woody W.,"Ormond Beach, FL",0,9,,2.0,6/18/2017,"We are big BJ's fans and have enjoyed many a visit - including last year at this very location on this very day - Father's Day. I wish that were true this year, but it's not.  Where to start - we had to wait 15 minutes despite there being ample empty tables - and arriving at about 445 pm (pre-dinner rush). Once seated, we enjoyed reviewing the menu, and again, and again, and again. It took. I less than 10 minutes to get just our drink order taken... not to mention another 10 to get the actual drinks.  We ordered an appetizer at the same time as our meal - because we'd had plenty of menu review time. Strongly recommend the Brussel Sprouts!  Half of our table was served about 5 - 8 minutes before the other half. And, it was the adults served first - a big mistake than anyone who has ever even been near a child knows. But, at long last we all had ""food."" I use quotes because my son's and I who each had burgers enjoyed something more of a charcoal briquette on a bun - well-done ain't got nothin' on these burgers!  We got to listen to the table behind us complain about speed and quality and got to watch the manager do virtually nothing about it - look no further than her for this locations speed and quality issues. Folks will follow a leader and rise to meet their expectations - but this leader wasn't leading.  We had to wait for drink refills (iced tea and water - not exactly complicated) twice during our meal. And, our salad/appetizer dishes were left at the table until we asked for it to be removed well after main dishes arrived. We never did get empty glasses removed from the table - they just kept stacking!  We ordered dessert because their Pizookies are awesome. And we were greeted by our bill before we even got dessert delivered to the table. They made a huge to-do about getting our rewards information before we were seated, but didn't ask to use this before bringing the bill.  We will be back to a BJs, but not this location.  And if you get sat in Lora S's section - grab a newspaper, because you are gonna wait! After we settled-up, I asked to speak with the manager, Vivian. I reviewed the entire contents of this review with her. She acknowledged these were problems and let me know that she ""just needs to give her servers some extra help tonight."" At no point did she offer to make things right or repair the relationship with this customer. As I said before - very poor leadership that results in very poor service and quality. Avoid this location!!"
Paulita D.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,1,,1.0,9/26/2017,"It is a shame that the service is so bad! The food is decent but I haven't been lucky in getting an take out order right. Ordered a customized burger with broccoli. Order came out without the vegetable and wrong cheese. Ordered a salad with mushrooms and asparagus, it came out without asparagus. I have given a few opportunities, I'm done."
Gigi S.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,2,,5.0,11/25/2017,The manager ryan Friday evening was such a wonderful in individual.  He wanted us to a nice meal and accommodated us to every level. Thank you for your kindness. Our waiter was just as amazing Joseph m.
Sally V.,"New Smyrna Beach, FL",0,4,,2.0,8/30/2017,"I will start by saying we come here fairly regularly bc we like the beers.  Very disappointed with the food this visit.  Not only was the food slow. It was wrong all attempts and they never got the meal correct.  And knowing this, no manager ever came out nor was our raw pizza (after 2nd attempt and over 45 mins.. we boxed it up) comped.  Don't expect the food to be what the menu says.  This isn't the first time we had incorrect food here, just the most annoying time bc of how long the food took and no manager came out And the fact I paid for a raw pizza they re-made twice.  Bartenders were good. I felt bad for them."
Summer C.,"Oak Ridge, NC",546,18,10,5.0,12/6/2016,"After looking for a local place to eat while visiting over the weekend we found, BJ's thinking it was a local family owned place. Have to be honest it is the first time I was happy it was a national chain! I am a ""foodie"" my nature and generally do not become wowed by food very often. I was almost speechless while eating my Kale & Brussels sprout salad the explosion of flavors was amazing!  My husband had the flatbread and loved it as well...we enjoyed our food so much that we broke other rule of our own, we went back the very next day for lunch! The second day did not disappoint either, the food, service, location and ambiance are all top notch.  We were so excited to find that we have one here in North Carolina!"
Killy C.,"Orlando, FL",2,10,21,4.0,2/5/2017,Loved it!! We had a large group of 35 friends that had dinner at this good looking restaurant. The service was awesome. 3 waiters handled our group and they all managed to handle everyone's request in a professional and effective way.. their Cream soda and the orange cream were amazing. Their ribs and the chicken alfredo were awesome. The only reason I didn't give them a 5 star rating is because I didn't like the pizza that much.  Overall i  Highly recommend this place.!!
Sherima R.,"Daytona Beach, FL",1,11,,4.0,4/17/2017,Great appetizers and Bloody Mary. Entrees less desirable. Service can be slow at times but it's better than other restaurants. It's ok food
Matt F.,"DeLand, FL",6,64,11,2.0,3/5/2017,"I'd never been to BJ'S before but my wife had raved about the Oviedo location so I figured we'd give the one in Daytona a try. I'm giving two stars instead of one because of the BJ'S phone app which allows you to schedule on the wait list via phone and our flatbread pepperoni appetizer which was pretty tasty. Everything else went downhill from there.  First our server took ten minutes to get to our table, slow service and not very busy so I was surprised by that. We ordered and had a pretty decent appetizer but our dinners were another story entirely. My wife and I ordered prime rib sandwiches with fries. They were very small and just meat, nothing else. The fries were buried in salt. Now I like salt. I use it all the time but between the massive amount of salt on the fries, sandwich and au jus it was almost inedible. I actually left food on my plate and this was a small order that cost me $16.  My son ordered a burger which came out prepared incorrectly. My wife and I are done and my son still hasn't eaten. After 15 minutes a new burger comes out burnt and nothing melted on it. We asked for a manager at this point. The manager was apologetic and comped the burger, appetizer and threw in two desserts. I'm glad because those meals, drinks and appetizers which were sandwiches and fries would have cost us 67 bucks not including tip.  Our server, by the way, never refilled our drinks. I had to ask another server to do that. The table next to ours  gave up on getting service and walked out. This place needs some serious revamping of their food and server training practices."
Bret S.,"Royal Palm Beach, FL",0,34,2,1.0,4/2/2017,"Just a HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!! Sat at the bar, ordered drink and asked bartender to turn on game I wanted to watch. She forgot and I had to remind her. Drinks were VERY WEAK. Ordered a queso dip with ground pork as a starter. Bartender ordered plain queso which was wrong. When I told her, she went in back and brought me out some microwaved pork. Of course I sent it back. She then orders me the chili dip instead and that was just disgusting. I paid for my drink and left. I would give ZERO STARS if it was possible!!!"
Jeff R.,"Port Orange, FL",29,59,116,4.0,8/9/2016,Constantly good food and good service  Never any problems   .  Kinda pricey but happy hour is cool and a good value  I love going there with my family
Gerry V.,"Port Orange, FL",77,26,7,2.0,5/28/2017,"Really off their game tonight. Brought the fam and the food was not good at all. We normally have a good experience but tonight it just did not seem the kitchen cared at all. No reflection on the wait staff,"
Bobbie R.,"Sacramento, CA",89,362,926,4.0,2/19/2016,This is a chain restaurant.  Same as all others which is good. Always get pizza and a side salad cause it's really good.  A big plus is it's location across the street from Daytona International Speedway.
Sean S.,"Tucker, GA",56,18,,5.0,5/2/2017,"Loved this place.  I was visiting and didn't have a great read on the restaurants in the area, but I was blown away by the atmosphere, service, and beer selection.   It's sort of an upscale sports bar with really good service, lots of space, and a huge menu.  I will definitely go back whenever I am in town!"
Dave O.,"New Smyrna Beach, FL",651,2365,8182,3.0,2/12/2015,"I've been to this location several times I've never had a bad experience they have all been about the same. Even though they always seem to be busy I've really never had to wait to be seated or for my server to arrive and take the drink order. So tonight was more of the same its always been consistent and that's why I've returned time after time. Our server tonight was really on top of her game very attentive, great personality and made sure everything was exactly like it was ordered. One think I did like about my visit tonight was the server repeated our order back to us before walking away and offered up a few tips regarding getting the sauce on the side verses having the kitchen add it the entree.  The calamari was tender and fried perfect, the shrimp tacos were filled with shrimp the shrimp were rather small but plentiful the other ingredients seems fresh and they were assembled very neatly not thrown together. The Roast Beef Dip (French Dip) was a great choice the roll was fresh and filled with a nice helping of really tender beef served with a rich au jus, Un des meilleurs que j'ai eu dans un temps long."
Pamela R.,"Daytona Beach, FL",20,5,,5.0,4/29/2017,Great food good price and wonderful service I'd go back many times very nice. The place is clean and neat
Jan T.,"Deltona, FL",0,15,,5.0,8/6/2017,Our favorite place by Daytona speedway. They have the best management and staff. Menu has something for everyone. Kids love the Pizookies. I enjoy the perfectly concocted drinks. Bathrooms are always clean. Always seated quickly and comfortably.
Jack K.,"Daytona Beach, FL",0,1,,4.0,3/31/2017,"Stopped here with my wife for a late lunch yesterday  the bar staff was very personable and knowledgeable about the menu as well as the many beers on tap. The only negative I found was the drink prices were quite high, but the food was very good and we will stop again"
William M.,"Chesapeake Beach, MD",16,1,1,4.0,2/22/2017,Ashley our bar tender was a super hero. This place rocks.  I usually do not go to press rated lower than a for on yelp.
Carol D.,"Ocala, FL",0,2,,5.0,3/8/2017,Exceptional in every way! Our server was very attentive and even offered us to go drinks. Our food was hot and delicious. My grandson and I enjoyed our meals and will definitely recommend BJ in Daytona Beach to all our friends and family who visit Daytona.
Aisha A.,"Deltona, FL",27,21,8,1.0,5/11/2016,"i went to this location on Saturday 5/7 with a group of 12. Let's just say from the minute they seated us things were off to a bad start. First off, they wanted to seat 12 people plus a baby sling at a table for 8. They then open the flaps for the table and add 4 inches making another attempt to seat us there. Mind you this was around 1030PM and there were probably only 4 other tables of guests. Then they gave us a server who was highly incapable of taking orders and bringing our food to the table in a timely manner. She would bring 2 or 3 appetizers out at a time right after the previous set of plates were empty. In this case, we werent really able to eat as a group and some of us ended up waiting for others to get their food to the point where ours was so cold it was inedible. We are very unsure of what her issue was with getting drinks but everytime someone asked she'd either ignore them to where we would have to hunt her down for a refill or take the glass with a pompous attitude and roll her eyes before coming back to slam the glass on the table to show how annoyed she was. She miswrote two of the orders at our table and when approached about it she just looked at us like we were speaking an alien language to her and she did not know what was going on. No apology or anything. Upon bringing the new meals back she had so much attitude dropping it on the table she almost hit the guest in the side of her face with the bowl. At this point I was highly irritated and could not deal with her snobbiness any longer. I requested to speak to a manager. I have never seen someone learn their please and thank you that quickly! The manager came over, comped two meals and that was about it (we didnt care to have anything comped but if you dont like to serve people then just dont do it!) Now comes time for our checks. You'd think it would be a breeze? It took her 1 hour to print 7 checks. Not to mention 3 of them came back wrong twice and 1 out of those 3 came back wrong 3 times. I feel sorry for those in my group who paid via card. You should have seen how fast this girls hand kept swiping one card again and again at the POS. Needless to say, this is one restaurant that we will not be making the mistake of visiting again!!"
DJ C.,"Cedarville, OH",0,2,,3.0,5/3/2017,"Good Food, slow service. Love this restaurant but very unimpressed by their service. Yelp is currently making me write a longer review so yadda, yadda, yadda"
