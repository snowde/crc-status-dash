Jason J.,"Green Cove Springs, FL",4,5,3,5.0,7/7/2014,"My Family went to BJ's tonight for my Birthday. I had the appetizer wings with extra hot sauce (not that hot). My daughter got the kid chicken fingers which could easily be adult portions. The other members of the table all got burgers. Every meal got raving reviews. We have been to this restaurant 7-8 times, and never had a bad experience. Looking forward to our next trip!"
Aaron G.,"Port Orange, FL",3,36,9,4.0,6/2/2014,I'm a fan of their burgers. Their bison burger is a great choice if you're looking for a healthier option. But bottom line is I've never been disappointed with any of their burgers.  Their deep dish pizzas are really good too. You definitely can't go wrong with the BJ's favorite. Great mix of flavors.
Linda S.,"Daytona Beach, FL",0,7,1,5.0,6/17/2015,"Love this place....their menu is huge, the food is always wonderful and the service is great....my waitress Katy was SO nice!!!"
Wayne B.,"Newark, DE",12,15,,5.0,4/10/2016,"2nd time here. Same experience as last. Been to the Kissimmee and Cupertino locations. Great beer selection, had potato skins, gluten free pizza and mahi tacos. All good. Service great too! Can't wait for the one that is supposed to open at Christiana Mall near us"
Jackie P.,"Saint Louis, MO",0,5,2,5.0,3/6/2016,"So far so good! Adam is our server. He's on top of his game. We were seated within 5 minutes...they said 15-20 minutes. Adam took our order within 5 minutes. The building is beautiful inside and out. We ordered deep dish pizza, small, and sirloin with roasted Brussel Sprouts. Our food came out in 15-20 minutes. Very pleased so far! The pizza is SUPER delicious! The steak was very good along with the veggies.  Too bad there is no BJ's Brewhouse in St. Louis!"
Jade A.,"Palm Coast, FL",0,5,,4.0,6/10/2015,"Driving by, I always thought this was a glorified sports bar but once inside, it's a very nice looking restaurant. The menu is large with tons of good options. There really is something for everyone here. I'm vegetarian and had no trouble finding good food. The Brussels sprouts are the bomb! Service was friendly and drinks were good too. I enjoyed this restaurant a lot. A little pricey but worth it."
Dana T.,"Lutz, FL",36,39,3,4.0,1/7/2015,Saw they had lunch specials AND had craft beer. Got the Oasis Lager and it's good. The bartender Ashley was patient and very personable. Decided on the BBQ slider with chicken breast. Chicken was moist and flovorable. Enjoyed it.
Mel M.,"Lakeland, FL",16,22,12,1.0,8/31/2014,Not very good. It's truly nothing more than bar food..beer taps are dirty gave my beer a sour taste.
Troy F.,"Orlando, FL",10,5,,1.0,8/18/2013,I'll add more after I leave however I was blown away at the price the waitress told me for a rum and coke. I thought maybe it was a mistake so I went to the bar and asked the bartender what it cost and it was actually $1.50 more than the already outrageous price the waitress told me.  I've been here before and it was awesome but even the food prices are way above what they should cost. Not sure if there was a recent giant increase in prices but $10.50 is ludicrous! I live down town Orlando and even at the most popular bars and clubs it doesn't even come close to this place.
Tony P.,"Elmhurst, IL",0,12,4,4.0,2/15/2015,Wow! What a menu! They have a dish for every taste bud. Mexican to pizza to sandwiches to appetizers. I had the pear cider and it was refreshing and delicious. Upscale decor in a bar type atmosphere was pleasantly surprising. The booths are huge and the food was tasty not great. Four star rating was more for the decor and the drinks and less about the food.
Penny L.,"Daytona Beach, FL",5,31,15,2.0,1/18/2013,"Not a place to visit if you only have an hour for lunch break! We were there for 2 hours to eat 4 salads, no apps, no alcohol, no desserts. The service is as slow as molasses. Here's the scoop: We ""called ahead seating"" for 4 guests for 1:30pm, but still had to wait 10 minutes to be seated when we arrived, even though we noticed lots of empty tables while walking to our seats. We all ordered salads for lunch, one guest ordering the ""unlimited"" soup/ salad which would later become his demise.  Good luck trying to get refills on empty drinks, let alone another serving of unlimited soups/ salad.  The salads came out sporadically instead of all together, being spaced about 2 minutes apart each. That's strange and annoying. Waitress had to be asked for refills instead of being proactive.  Overall - the steak salad was nice, but not enough to entice me back to poor service."
Darrell M.,"Shoreham, MI",0,3,1,5.0,4/11/2015,"Very good restaurant and excellent service!  The night my wife and I went, the restaurant was busy and our waitress was clearly being slowed down by a specific table of 2 that were taking much more time than everyone else.  Still, she hustled to make sure the rest of the tables were taken care of.  My wife didn't find exactly what she wanted on the menu, so she asked if they could make a salad the way she wanted it and without hesitation the answer was ""no problem"".  Both of our meals were exactly as we ordered them and were terrific.  Would definitely visit here again."
Wendy S.,"Daytona Beach, FL",0,1,,4.0,4/1/2015,"Stopped for lunch and hubby had Veggie pizza since it had Brussels sprouts, asparagus, artichokes n much more. Best veggie pizza ever. I've never tried ahi tuna so I tried the salad. Although I love sea food to me this had no flavor so when the waitress asked I told her an she brought some yummy shrimp instead. The rest of the salad was outstanding. Service attentive but not overbearing. I'd definitely go back."
Sadi H.,"St. Augustine, FL",4,17,,4.0,10/29/2014,This place was perfect for us as a family of 6 to stop & eat for lunch. And while on vacation it was the best selection & cheapest bill. Kids loved it. Will be going to a BJ's again.
Ray S.,"Port Orange, FL",12,88,4,4.0,6/2/2013,"I've been here on several occasions and the food has always been good. I can testify to the clean and neat atmosphere, the great selection of beers, soups, salads, appetizers and their amazing burgers. Another favorite is their Blonde fish & chips made from real cod (and not Swai or Tilapia.) I will admit that the service can be iffy at times but that's usually during their peak service hours so I usually plan to arrive there just before or after those periods. That said, for the most part of my experience, the staff has been helpful, attentive, extremely friendly and they deliver your menu selections quickly and efficiently. Bon Apetite! ""Life's too short for bland food, bad wine, weak coffee or cheap whiskey."" RS"
Ryan B.,"Burlington, VT",15,72,1,5.0,9/23/2014,"I visited Daytona Beach twice for business, and both times I went to BJ's Brewhouse. They brew all their own beers. They even brew their own soda. The Rootbeer was AMAZING! The food is decently priced, and excellent. The atmosphere is that of a brew pub. Try the Peanut Butter S'Mores pie. TO.DIE.FOR!!!"
Joni B.,"Daytona Beach, FL",0,3,,5.0,3/5/2015,"Excellent food and bar.   I'm very picky.  Go at happy hour for a great deal.  Anyone that gives this less than five stars do not know food, drinks or atmosphere and should stay at Denny's."
Stephen S.,"Gaithersburg, MD",6,25,8,3.0,11/4/2014,Happy hours are dope. 2 dollar beers. Service always funny. Thistime this hung over guy had odd mannerisms. Could have been high. Hard to tell these days. Dude was decent. No one was there to seat us when we walked in though. Good ole Daytona.
Raul A.,"Titusville, FL",0,6,,2.0,1/17/2016,"Went for our first visit to a BJ's R&B and sadly it is likely the last. I ordered the Mahi Tacos and although tasty, they were the smallest that I have ever had at any restaurant. The value is just not there, After peeking at some other plates go by I noticed the same thing with the others. Also, the service was very slow and inattentive."
Jessica J.,"Daytona Beach, FL",359,431,570,2.0,6/12/2012,"I am going to have to reconsider my original review.  My pizza tasted so burnt and it was way, way, way tiny for the price.  I was actually surprised at the size.  I know it was a ""mini"", but it must have been a toddler's mini.  It just wasn't good.  When I go to this location, I always leave feeling that my food was mediocre at best."
