Paul W.,"Mechanicsburg, PA",28,66,45,5.0,3/1/2013,"Great food! Great beer!  Great location!  Great service, most of the time.  You can't really go wrong here unless you only like Coors Light and hot dogs!  Walking distance to the track, lots of good craft beers on draft and exceptional food.  What aren't you there yet?!"
Laura D.,"North Charleston, SC",38,50,4,2.0,7/23/2015,"Good ambiance.  Good service. Food sucked. Front of the house did well with what they had to work with... but the kitchen staff needs training.  There were 2 shrimp pastas on the menu. Based on the servers recommendation,  I went with the one with broccoli  in it, she said the other was bland. this one was too. I ordered it with blackened  shrimp. When it came out... it was clearly  not blackened. I mentioned  it to the server, who was polite, and said ""yeah, that's clearly not blackened, I will be right back."" When she returned, she said ""the cook told me that it was blackend, but it fell off when he was cooking  it, so he threw a little more blackend seasoning on for you.""  The cook had sprinkled some old bay or whatever  over the dish. Ramen noodles would have more flavor. Seriously.  The mozzarella and tomato salad was good. That's hard to mess up. My bf had the parmigian chicken. He said it was crap. Box mash potatoes and a piece of chicken that looked like it came from a toaster oven. The sauce was... not good. Poor execution by the kitchen, good front of the house staff."
Sheyla K.,"Rahway, NJ",0,5,,1.0,5/3/2015,"I have never been to a more disorganized establishment. They poorly manage larger parties, serving food randomly and even cold. Dishes are dirty; I received a mug with dried food on it, my friend received a soda with food floating in it, and our entire table's silverware had soap residue. I had recently attended with a large party and had gotten a waitress who acted as if she hated the place. She rolled her eyes, was inattentive, and failed to complete additional task. For example, a straw was asked for and it was 30 minutes before she had come to our table. Meanwhile she was clearly avoiding the table and bad mouthing this group to her manager, as she indicated by blatantly pointing at the table. Additionally, a glass had been spilled on the table and as I tried to call a waitress, I was ignored. After flagging down a bus boy, he had given my friend a towel to clean it himself. This establishment's attitude and restaurant are equally disatisfactory and it is not worth the time to visit."
Stacey L.,"Port Orange, FL",0,25,,5.0,8/9/2014,"I have never and will never have anything other than the deep dish pizza. It is sooooo very good that I don't want to try anything else and be disappointed because it isn't as good as the deep dish. Now I do recommend asking for extra sauce on the pizza because when they say on the menu light sauce, they mean it. And then there are the pizookies. Oh holy bejesus are they delicious. I've tried all of the different flavors and while they all are tasty my favorite is the cookies and cream. It is to die for, so save room for dessert"
Edward J.,"Daytona Beach, FL",62,471,314,4.0,2/15/2012,Super tasty beer. Pizza is pretty good. Place looked like it was going to send me to the poor house but the bill wasn't bad.
Michelle M.,"Orlando, FL",28,6,2,5.0,11/16/2013,"My husband had an appointment at Eyeglass World right up the street, so we decided to have dinner close by.  He has been to BJ's with his kids a few times, but we had never gone there together.  What a surprise and delight our experience was at BJ's!  We got to our seats just in time because not more than 10 minutes after we arrived, a huge group came in and the lobby was bustling with people and activity.  Luckily, the place is big enough that it absorbed it all and we were still very comfortable and could hear one another talk.   We ordered our glass of wine and within a few minutes our waiter, Dustin, brought the wine to us and remembered to bring the extra cup filled with ice.  I know it's sacrilege, but I like my white wine ice cold!  I decided on a ribeye with baked potato and veggies, and Mike was getting a pizza.  When I ordered, Dustin suggested the two for $35 menu since the ribeye was already on there and, on it's own, was $19.99 so this was a great deal.  You get a salad or soup, the entrée plus two sides and dessert to share.  Mike decided to get the ribeye as well, mine medium rare and he medium, both of us with a baked potato with butter and sour cream and I chose the winter veggie mix, while Mike chose the green beans. Dustin brought our salads very quickly, both with ranch dressing.  The plates were loaded up with the greens, tomato, cucumber, croutons and the ranch dressing.  Oh my, their ranch dressing is delicious!  We both ate every bite of our salads and sipped on our ice cold Chardonnay.  The restaurant was hopping and their waiting area was filled the entire time we were there, but folks seemed fine with waiting and were seated reasonably quick.   Mike and I both commented that it felt really good that there was no rush with getting us in and out of there, just a nice leisurely meal in a place with great atmosphere.  Their bar area has a huge TV in it's center which was playing four different channels, showing various sports events. Our food arrived fairly quickly and it looked delicious.  Steaming baked potato with luscious looking veggies and a lovely ribeye steak.  As we cut into our steaks, we both noticed that they were very rare, barely even warm center on my medium rare, and Mike's medium was almost more rare than mine.  We let Dustin know, and he immediately scooped up our plates and told us he would get the steaks cooked up a bit more and get them back to us as quickly as possible.  Within a few minutes, the manager came up to our table and apologized for the steaks and let us know they were getting them taken care of in the kitchen.  So polite and apologetic, we were very impressed!  Within about 5 minutes, our plates were returned to us with steaming hot steaks, a new baked potato and steaming veggies.  Both of our steaks were perfectly cooked and absolutely delicious!  I don't know what kind of rub or marinade they use, but the taste was as good if not better than Ruth's Chris and Flemings.  Every bite melted in my mouth!  The potato was huge and the butter and sour cream, along with fresh chives was a great accompaniment to the steak.  On top of that, my winter mix of cauliflower, broccoli, fresh carrots and butternut squash was to die for!   As we were sipping our wine, and enjoying our delicious meal, the chef comes to our table and apologizes for the initially undercooked steaks.  We told him that we understood and the steaks they sent back out to our table were delicious and we were extremely happy.  He apologized once again and quietly disappeared as we continued to savor our meal. Dustin then came back to the table and asked if we were ready for dessert.   We had pretty much decided right before then that we were going to skip dessert since we were so full, and already taking home half our steaks and sides to have for lunch tomorrow.  Dustin was like, ""no way, you gotta try this dessert!  You won't regret it! ""  We acquiesced and boy, did we make the right decision!  This stuff was manna from heaven, let me tell you!  A deliciously warm brownie with a soft center (similar to ""dump cake"" or molten lava cake), with peppermint ice cream that melted perfectly along with the bites of not-too-sweet dark chocolate brownie, and the crushed peppermint candies gave the dessert a lovely crunch and so much flavor!  I don't typically eat dessert, and neither does my husband, but we ate EVERY single bite of this dessert. We joked with Dustin that ""we didn't like it at all!"" and he hung out with us for a few minutes and joked about his recent honeymoon in Key West and food and restaurant experiences -- he was just a great guy!  You must ask for him when you go to BJ's!  He was a hoot! Needless to say I am sitting in my sweat pants and baggy shirt and savoring my delicious meal and wonderful experience at BJ's ... Mike said that we should go back soon and I said ""tomorrow?  After all, it will be Funday Sunday""!   . Go soon!  You won't regret it!"
Margarita K.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,14,,3.0,2/13/2014,"Eh.. Foods bland and over priced. Went in about 4x gave it a couple tries still haven't like it. I want to like it. Huge inside, lots of drinks to try, very nice decor (a lot different from the other shitty run down places in Daytona Beach) which is y I want to like it. But I wouldn't go back until their food starts to actually have some taste..  2 and half starts."
Franklyn T.,"Flagler Beach, FL",10,125,46,4.0,1/7/2014,"Came by to celebrate my mom's birthday, and ordered tons of food and drinks. Our server was polite and helpful in regards to the various menu options available. We waited a bit for our food, but nothing too complain about; chipotle avocado rolls weren't as spicy as I wished they were. I enjoy coming to BJ, and will definitely be back."
Josh W.,"Bedford, TX",15,31,7,4.0,4/11/2014,"Good burgers and beer selection.  The menu is quite large, but I always end up getting a burger and a beer for some reason.  The burgers are cooked properly, juicy, and those thin cut fries have some kind of magic sprinkled on them because they are just delicious (and addicting!).  They have a good beer selection, too, and I am a fan of IPAs so I usually go with one of those.  Overall a great spot."
Beta T.,"Daytona Beach, FL",0,1,,3.0,1/23/2013,"If it wasn't for the food it would of gotten 2 stars. Place looks cool but, the seating is too small and the wall wasn't high enough for privacy. Better service at the bar.  Wait staff is so slow its depressing:( Waited 30 minutes for a pitcher and two shots of tequila Jose silver. A pitcher of there own beer is 17 freakin dollars!  ?????  Waitress also tried to charge us for Jose Gold tequila on the bill. Had to call over the manager to change it after they made us wait another 15 min after we were clearly done. The Food: The Jalapeño Burger was freaking awesome! Fried jalapeños, pepper jack cream cheese, chipotle mayonnaise, Baja sauce, red onions, tomato and lettuce. Good steak fries:) All and all I thought bringing someone for there birthday here was a good idea. I guess I was wrong. I won't come again, maybe ill do take out lol."
Victor G.,"Pierson, FL",5,243,91,3.0,5/28/2012,Service was bad took 30 mins to get our drinks and another 15 for our appetizers. Food was ok nothing to write home about.
Bryan P.,"Ormond Beach, FL",17,85,3,3.0,9/12/2013,Food is average in quality and overpriced. But they do have a great beer selection . there quarterly beer tasting are the shining star here.
Howard B.,"Madison, CT",0,22,,5.0,3/22/2015,"My wife and I just finished dinner and what a good dinner it was. This was not our first visit to this restaurant. This time my wife had the Cherry Chipotle Glazed Salmon, good size portion and great taste. I had the New Orleans Jambalaya. It does have a good spice kick to it but you still get all the flavor. Our waiter ""Brian"" was very knowledgable and explained the items on the menu and the many beers that they have on tap. We both look forward to returning the next time we are in Daytona."
Emily F.,"Pensacola, FL",98,51,8,4.0,12/14/2013,"The beer is great. Very good quality. The food is ok. I expected more because of the price. I had a cup of chili and it was great. My New York Strip was tough and our stuffed mushroom appetizer was bland. Dessert is always a good choice. The chocolate chunk is my favorite and coming in close second is cookies and cream. I want to try their pizzas, I've heard good things. Service is slow but there is always someone walking by if you have to get someone's attention. Overall I would go back. But probably for lunch or appetizers. Their entrees aren't worth the money."
G A.,"Rockaway, NJ",2,29,38,4.0,4/28/2014,Loved the orange soda which are all home made. If you have a sweet tooth you won't want to stop drinking this! I ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo and wish I could have had room for a second plate-sooo delicious. The waiter was kind enough to bring even more Parmesan cheese I sprinkled on top!
Karen G.,"Palatine, IL",12,102,6,4.0,10/14/2013,"I was treated to BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse in Daytona Beach before a flight out of FL.  I really enjoyed the great service, good food and atmosphere of this restaurant.  I grabbed a rewards card so I can come back with friends and family and get my points.  The clam chowder was delicious, my half chicken sandwich was done well and I have no complaints (for a change).  I will be back......."
Buck J.,"Daytona Beach, FL",116,150,51,4.0,7/25/2011,"Have visited BJ's three times. Didn't expect much the first time, but very pleasantly surprised. Has the feel of a high end sports bar like Yardhouse without as many TV's. That's great if you are on a date, not so good if you are hoping to catch a game. But, you won't be disappointed by the food, and, as someone else mentioned, the size and diversity of the menu will remind you of Cheesecake Factory. But, CF can't match the selection of beer, bottles and tap, plus about a dozen of their own microbrews. Great place for lunch or dinner!"
T Y.,"Daytona Beach, FL",0,9,,5.0,4/6/2015,Frequent this establishment often. Always great service at the bar! They have a nice selection for late night happy hour and everything I've tried on the menu has been quite tasty.
Beth H.,"Charleston, SC",10,14,,2.0,4/4/2013,"The pizza tasted like it was a frozen pizza and one of our group said we would have done better to have actually gotten a good frozen pizza.  So, we will not be coming back here again."
Tim H.,"Charlotte, NC",23,196,86,4.0,2/18/2013,"We eat at BJ's every time we are in SO CAL, so I was excited to see them across from the race track this past weekend. Just like out west the Pizza was great and so was the Blonde Ale!! The only thing I would say the Hostess guy was not very friendly at all and sorta rude, but the waitress was nice and on top of things."
