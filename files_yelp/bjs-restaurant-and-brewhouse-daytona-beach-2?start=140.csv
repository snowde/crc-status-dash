Susan W.,"Palm Coast, FL",37,11,18,1.0,7/14/2013,Had to review this place!!!! This is our second experience and the food and service overall was terrible. Waitresses were good but their runners were disconnected. The only reason we came back is because the manager gave us a gift card for poor service the first time. Will not come back . Place looks great but rather drive  the hour for Cheesecake Factory.
Lynn A.,"Rockaway, NJ",0,13,1,1.0,9/6/2013,"Will not return. Here for lunch, food for just one of our party of 3 was served then the other 2 of us had no food for another 20 minutes. No apology or explanation was given, even though we expressed our dissatisfaction and asked that it be shared with the (apparently nonexistent) manager. Blackened shrimp tacos when finally served     had little flavor , hardly any blackened seasoning on shrimp and the shrimp were cold. Avoid wasting your time and money here!"
Mike D.,"Philadelphia, PA",59,404,29,3.0,7/18/2010,"Brand new in DB is BJ's.  Came here, sat at the bar and had some beer and food.  The food here is average but the service was good! We had the avocado spring roll appetizer and I had the gluten-free thin crust pizza.  The appetizer was full of avocado, very hot, and as satisfying as an egg roll could be.  The pizza was full of toppings but the sauce was suspect.  The redeeming quality was the bites full of toppings.  Any time I had just the crust and sauce I was left feeling like I had just eaten ketchup and bread.  While there is a pretty decent beer selection, stemming from house brewed beers to tasty imports, the food is still chain quality.  Come here for the beer and stay for the food that accompanies it."
Kicked The Dog Y.,"Dallas, TX",1,28,4,4.0,9/29/2013,Decent place.  Nice.  Clean.  Good staff.  They have a small portion app menu for the single patron.  I had salmon for dinner.  It was overcooked.   they remade it correctly.   Much appreciated.   Worth giving the place a try.
Anthony G.,"Palm Coast, FL",35,27,37,5.0,3/11/2011,Good place to eat. Nice atmosphere & good service. CALAMARI!!!! You got to get it. Superb. Not too pricey. Prices are comparable to Applebees.
Sarah R.,"Port Orange, FL",0,26,,5.0,7/13/2014,"This place can definitely be expensive but after my first experience here I will definitely be returning. The atmosphere is nice, the food is great, and it's one of the only places in the area that offer house-brewed beers. After looking over the extensive menu, I finally settled on the Crispy Jalapeño Burger. It has huge, perfectly cooked, topped with lots of delicious toppings, and served up with a mound of seasoned potato wedges. As for the beer, I tried BJ's Harvest Hefewiezen and Wyder's Pear Cider which were both delicious and fruity without being too sweet."
Jamie D.,"Napa, CA",50,125,75,5.0,10/31/2010,Love everything so far! Ahi Poke Appetizer is awesome! Service has been attentive and friendly.  It's not just for BEER!
Stacy D.,"Boca Raton, FL",29,7,,1.0,9/9/2014,Worst pizza EVER!!!  Got deep dish pizza to go and  Pizza was so salty we couldn't even eat it. Sauce was brown and crust was just big bread (not deep dish at all).
Andrea B.,"Washington, DC",0,10,,3.0,8/30/2014,"Very good food, especially the half pound cheese burger  which was cooked to perfection!  The steak fries were nicely seasoned and not greasy. Would have been a better experience if not for the extremely slow service. It took too long to get our beverages at the start and that was only the beginning. Then another long wait for appetizers followed by yet another long wait for the entrees and  still another long wait for dessert. And we came in the middle of the afternoon, not the height of lunch or dinner hour. If this was an evening dedicated to dining out it would have been okay but nearly 2 hours for burgers in the middle of the day was way too long!"
Valerie J.,"Salina, KS",100,52,4,3.0,6/21/2012,"The service here is absolutely horrible but the food is so good, we can't help but to keep coming back. Okay, so the service isn't always horrible. But if you go at lunch and you need to get back to work, don't count on that happening within the standard lunch hour. Sitting in the bar area has helped, but if you go in a group of more than 4 people, you're pretty much doomed. Lunch specials are a great price."
John W.,"Orlando, FL",0,30,6,5.0,1/1/2014,"Stopped by on the way back to Orlando. Great experience and excellent food. We tried the 1/2 price appetizer deal and wow was it great. The sliders were great, the mini deep dish pizza (Great White) was outstanding, and the ahi tuna was a surprisingly large amount.  These would have been just as satisfying at full price. We will definitely be back. In addition, Angel was our waiter and he was great...very knowledgeable and very cooperative."
Cynthia S.,"DeLand, FL",4,32,2,2.0,11/8/2011,"Well, we stopped here for lunch while out shopping in the beach area. A new chain here in FLA. Go here for the brews and steaks - nothing else. The manager is ever-present but the hostess NEVER SMILES and gives orders to patrons, ""Stand here!"" Did it matter? No one else was in the foyer! Won't be back."
Cece C.,"Rochester, NY",66,178,345,2.0,6/18/2011,"I went here about a month ago and was not impressed. I use to work at another location so I was excited to check this one out with all the new additions to the menu. Upon arriving wait was not long and had a nice atmosphere. They did not bring my son a kids menu... I had to ask for one. The waitress was terrible..We decided on appitizers and when we told her we'd like to order some she said ""one moment"" and we didnt see her again for like 5 min.She laid the check down without asking about dessert . We had to find her when it was time to go. I had a calzone which was terrible...the only thing inside was sauce and a tiny smidge of ricotta in one end.Booooo BUT my beer was aweome!! lol I recommend the Hef with a splash of fremoit YUM! Also the portions are big and other food I have had there is pretty good.A lot to choose from."
john k.,"San Bruno, CA",24,54,74,4.0,2/10/2012,"Place was busy, but then again it was Saturday night and the big weekend for the Rolex 24 Hours at Daytona. We were a group of 10 and sat outside. I have a BJ's next to home, but this is where the group decided to go. If you been to BJ's and like beer, its always gonna be good. The food was consistant with what i had before and the beer. The service was good and all the food came out the same time."
Kevin L.,"Dover, NJ",3,8,,5.0,8/13/2011,Everthing was excellent! My pizza came about perfect and there were no complaints with the rest of my party. Excellent bar atmosphere with tvs and great designs. Booths were very comfy also. All around excellent.
Carpe D.,"Miami, FL",0,3,,5.0,5/6/2014,"I celebrated my mom graduation at BJ's Restaurant in Daytona Beach.  I have been to many restaurants from Tallahassee to Miami.  I have to honestly say this restaurant deserves 5 stars in food presentation, customer satisfaction/service and awesome price.  Thank you to all staff members who made my celebration a one to remember.  I am still receiving thank you emails to guest who attended the celebration expressing how much fun they had.  Thank you BJ's for providing my family and friends with a lasting memory !!!!!!!"
Amanda J.,"Bartow, FL",2,40,2,4.0,1/31/2014,"We've stopped here twice on our way home from Jacksonville.  Though the service is slow, the food is very good, beer selection is phenomenal, and dessert is the best part.  Highly recommended if you're not in a hurry."
Trish D.,"DeLand, FL",16,82,,4.0,5/28/2011,"The best part about BJ's is Wine Down Tuesdays and they have some really good appetizers. We really like sitting outside here and have had great service on 3 different occasions in the early evenings.  ( It's just too bad they don't have a covered outdoor space so there could be ceiling fans during the hot weather.)  The flatbreads are tasty and the salads are really good, too."
kelley s.,"Sanford, FL",163,214,103,5.0,5/6/2011,"Oh man, what can I say...BJs is ggggreat! HUGE menu, something for everyone and it's always super tasty! They also have a HUGE selection of their own beers including multiple CIDER!!! (the pear is my fav!). I always get the avocado eggrolls...my mouth is watering just thinking about them...  awesome atmospher, great for big groups, awesome food and drinks...hello?!?!?! why are you still reading this and not out the door to BJs?!?!?! :)"
Dennis L.,"Dover, NJ",3,24,,5.0,8/23/2011,"What a place!   The head chef and brew master are both awesome.  Both the food and beer was excellent. This combination is hard to come by but these people can pull it off. We had a party of four that ordered 4 appetizers along with two beer samplers , one of the light and ale beers and the otherof the dark beers.  All were excellent. pletny of great beer choices on tap as well.   Main courses were all much beetter that were expected.  Decor is modern and plenty of HD tvs for the big games.  Great place to hangout!"
