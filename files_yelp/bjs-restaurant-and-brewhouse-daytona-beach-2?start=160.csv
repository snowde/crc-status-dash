Michelle S.,"Port Orange, FL",1,9,,4.0,1/13/2012,"Great food and beer menu! A little issue in the time management dept. when there is a crowd, but it is truly worth the wait."
Jeremy D.,"Winter Haven, FL",26,11,8,5.0,6/25/2011,"I tried it on a whim with family while on vacation and we were all very impressed, even the service was top notch. We all ordered something different so we could try a variety (menu is pretty big and you will want to try different things) and they were all awesome. Hamburgers were great, gumbo was awesome (spicy like it should be), even loved the fish taco! As a result we came back later that week and was just as impressed after trying more new items. The salads are loaded with flavor and the cookie-n-ice cream dessert is worth getting every time! Can't wait till next years vacation to try more new things here for lunch or dinner."
Changsu Y.,"Bradenton, FL",0,2,,1.0,11/21/2011,"This is my 3rd and final visit to this facility.  I've been to many BJ's across the country and it is one of my 10 go to places.  Always dependable, good atmosphere, and reasonably priced.   I first went to this facility 2 years ago and I was not going to visit this place again because of non service and VERY SLOW to get anything.  Anyway I visited again 1 year ago because it is BJ's and maybe things have improved.  I let the waiter know what happened during my last visit so I got a much better service but the food was very salty so they had to remake the food.   I just visited again today and I will NEVER return to this place EVER or someone slap me.  No service was VERY SLOW, brought the food salty again (no where to find the waitress so I asked the receptionist to find our waitress and she said OK I will find her OK!!! and stared at me. I went back to my table and she proceed to do whatever she was doing and ignored me.  Finally when I was about to go around looking for the waitress, the receptionist went to look for the waitress).  After that fiasco, the waitress passed by our table several times but failed to see if we needed anything like refilling the empty cup.  We go to nice places because of atmosphere, nice food, good service, and value pricing.  Atmosphere = 10, Value Pricing = 10, Nice Food = 4, Good Service = 2.  That's my 2 cents..."
Dan L.,"Dover, NJ",2,2,1,5.0,8/15/2011,"Came here after looking at all the reviews and they are all correct. This place has some of the best food in Daytona. When we arrived we had to wait twenty minutes for our table. They don't have a big waiting area so we were standing. After ten minutes one of the wait staff comes out with a free sample of pizza slices for everyone. Very nice gesture. When we were seated I was able to watch the football games with no problems. All of our appetizers came out in a timely manner and were all excellent. Angus sliders were great, but the Tuna Poke was my personal standout. I had the  jambalaya and it was spicy and well seasoned. The others in my party also had great meals as well. The grilled breaded chicken was another really good dish. Defiantly will come back."
Kim H.,"Ormond Beach, FL",37,202,113,4.0,8/21/2010,"It is a nice resturant with an encyclopedia for a menu much like cheesecake factory,(in size volume only) but not quite as daunting. HUGE variety of beers.  I really liked my fish tacos and the prices are pretty good. Service was meh but it is new.  I will be back."
Valerie B.,"Eustis, FL",3,58,3,5.0,7/18/2010,We were there on opening day and the food was great. I would actually say it's almost better than other chain restaurants like Longhorns (which is what it reminds me of). The servers were nice and attentive. The food came out hot. Refills were in abundance. Pricing was very reasonable. Definitely a place to go to.
Don L.,"New Smyrna Beach, FL",450,210,13,2.0,8/1/2011,"Potato skins were very good, crispy and great flavor.  However, the jambalaya tasted completely burned.  The deep dish pizza was all crust and lacking on the toppings.  Pretty much just typical bar-type food."
Craig E.,"Jacksonville, FL",47,58,5,2.0,9/11/2011,"Stopped at this chain restaurant on a trip, and it was conveniently off I-95.  Very impressive looking place, but underwhelming regarding food and service.  Prices are on the high side for what you receive.  Servers kept reciting scripted dialogue that included ""what would you like this evening"" or ""have a great evening' - even though it was 11:45 am.  With very few people in the place, our simple order took at least 20 minutes to arrive.  Aside from that, we ordered a turkey burger and a special italian chopped salad that sounded great on the menu with cheeses and italian meats.  The turkey burger was fine, but the salad was mostly lettuce with a nice vinaigrette dressing and a few bits of mozzarella, salami,olives,etc. - very small bits to say the least.  No bread sticks, or bread, or in fact - anything on the side - or to munch on before the order arrived.  There were a couple of good chunks of fontina - there should have been much more stuff for a salad priced between $10 -11.  The turkey burger was over $10 also.  Basically, the food was ok.  Nothing particularly special, and over-priced for some very basic items. For a $30 lunch including soft drinks and tip, we could have done better at Fridays.........."
Jill T.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,14,,3.0,11/12/2011,They were off tonight; in & out after agonizing 2.5 hours. Long 30 minute pauses between courses with no anticipation of needs meaning servers came and left without removing obvious dirty plates; never spontaneous water replenishing; salmon very small in portion as well as the ahi tuna and no to the pizza as too much crust and scant toppings. of course the beers- no complaint there. Conclusion is food is so so yet service extremely lax.
ron e.,"Wall, NJ",0,18,,3.0,4/9/2011,"We arrived at 5PM on a Wednesday- before the dinner crowd.  We were a party of three and were shown to a table- when we asked for a booth-(there were many available) the hostess gave us a very unhappy look. Our waiter was friendly and tried to be our good buddy. He took our order and brought back our drinks- we waited and waited for our salads. Finally our waiter realized that he forgot the salads and went to get them. He came back and said the salads were delayed because they were baking fresh croutons(  sure or did they open a new bag). Within minutes of getting the salads our entrees arrived- we wound up eating both salads and entrees at the same time. I had just finished my entree (still had a fork in my hand) and my wife was still enjoying her meal when our waiter arrived to clear the table and ask if we wanted anything else. When we indicated that we were not interested in dessert he whipped out the check and placed it on our table and said no rush on the check. (my wife still had half of her entree left to eat) During our meal he returned numerous times to ask how we liked our ""brewskies) He kept pushing the drinks- since I am old enough to be his father I really didnt like being treated as a college buddy. It could be he was rushing us out to have another group seated or he was just not schooled in taking good care of a customer. The food was just ok- nothing to write home about. I think that a good restaurant experience depends on a good waiter and we really felt rushed by this young waiter. I am now not inclined to go back with that experience fresh on my mind.I hope the manager sees this review and instructs his staff that return business is  more important not just the fast tip for that one evening."
Sixnine M.,"Daytona Beach, FL",0,17,,3.0,9/22/2010,"new place so some slip ups-speaking of which watch out for the flooors are VERY slippery,saw one lady fall-otherwise was good food and service is so so for now"
tess w.,"Lawtey, FL",0,10,,2.0,8/7/2010,"I went there for lunch yesterday. It seems the locals are still checking out the ""new place"" because the wait was horrible, about 40 minutes when they said it would only be 10 minutes. Yes, we should've left after the first 20 minutes went by, but we were also checking out the new place.  The waitress was too distracted, the food came out and looked as if it had been dropped and just thrown back on the plate. We ordered ""lunch size"" portions that were smaller than I'm used to and bland. I had the Cobb salad and my friend had the fish tacos, the salad had 99% lettuce with a minuscule amount of ""other"" ingredients, the tacos were better, but they should have added more chips or something on the side of the two very small tacos. The only good thing was that the beer, it's $3 at lunch time and it was very good. So we decided if we ever go back, it will be just for the beer and eat somewhere else. Maybe after the newness wears off in a few months it will improve, but it won't be on my rush back to list. For a chain Restaurant I would rate it average; the food and beers at Ruby Tuesday's down the street are better without the wait."
