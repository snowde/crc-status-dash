John C.,"Ormond Beach, FL",258,1256,3001,4.0,6/28/2015,Went here for Fathers Day dinner to meet family.  Consistently good food and service.  I was expecting a wait but we were seated quickly.  I had a sirloin with vegetables that was very nice.  Other had salmon with rice and my son just had the desert trio.  All looked good and the drinks were nice.  There is seating outside if you bring your dog.  It is in the shade of the building after 1pm.
D N.,"Poplar Grove, IL",5,44,,5.0,1/4/2017,We love the food!! We tried the chicken wrap appetizer and two mini pizzas. Favorite pizza was the spicy Hawaiian chicken.  They have great happy hour specials on food and drinks. Our server Claira was great too!
Nick L.,"Manchester, NH",2,21,,4.0,7/3/2017,Great restaurant! Modern location with a great choice of food and drinks. Very reasonable prices and great quality food. Servers are attentive and knowledgeable regarding menu offerings.
Chris V.,"Albany, NY",21,90,10,3.0,4/11/2016,"This was a cut above for a chain restaurant.  Our server was very friendly and helpful, really good.  Good beer selection.  most of the small pizzas were a hit, but we were disappointed by the flatbread one."
Rhonda T.,"Middletown, OH",0,1,,4.0,6/12/2017,Everything we had was delicious. Ordered calamari for the appetizer.  We had pizza for dinner. Got the BBQ chicken pizza and the buffalo chicken pizza. Service was really good.
Yarko K.,"Toledo, OH",22,62,27,3.0,2/16/2016,"We come down every year for the Daytona 500, and BJ's has become a trusted place for good food. Normally, they tick all the marks, this year, not so much. While we did stop in the week prior to the race, it was not even close to packed, so our experience cannot be chalked up to an overwhelming amount of customers.  The root beer glazed ribs appetizer were delish. Sweet and tangy, with just the right amount of heat. Yum! Their flatbread pizza appetizers are normally homeruns, especially the really unique ones (sadly several have been dropped from the menu) but this time we stuck with the tried and true pepperoni extreme. Unfortunately it was extremely blah. Couldn't make out the different cheeses, and the pizza itself wasn't crisp. The crust wasn't raw, it just wasn't thin and crispy.   As for our entrees, another ""meh"" performance. The spaghetti and meatballs were good. The meatballs tasty and well seasoned (love that they include some Italian sausage), the sauce decent. My companion had teh ham turkey club ... what a disappointment. The lettuce was limp, edges were browning (UGH). The tomatoes were tasteless, and the entire sandwich was soggy. Bummer, because the sourdough bread had great potential, but it was too soggy to enjoy. I'm afraid BJ's is slipping into the rut of chain restaurant mediocrity, which is a shame. It used to give the independent places in town a real run for their money."
Heather S.,"DeLand, FL",0,10,,5.0,12/19/2016,Went in for some dinner after doing some Christmas shopping all day which we all know how exhausting that can be. We were greeted by the hostess who was super sweet and offered the bar top as first come first serve if we did not want to wait. We sat up by the bar in a booth and we're quickly greeted by an amazing server named Nick. He was attentive but gave us our space we never waited long on anything he was very knowledgeable on the menu and overall was just pleasant to be around. We throughly enjoyed the food and will be back to see him!
Becky F.,"Altamonte Springs, FL",65,159,262,4.0,9/22/2016,Nice fresh food . Accommodation of my low salt diet. Really great service.  Nice clean restaurant.  Will return.
Peter S.,"Deltona, FL",0,9,,2.0,5/30/2017,"Tonight was the first time at B J's. 12 of us went to celebrate a family member graduating.  5 of us ordered the rib eye, 3   of them had to go back. Instead of rare to medium rare they were raw to medium raw with a cool purple center. I would have been embarrassed to put the asparagus on the plate like they did. The mashed potatoes were good. They had little bumpy things in it that made me think they were homemade. Looking back I should have taken a closer look at those bumpy things. The beer was good, glad I picked the one with the higher alcohol content. The service was slow and we had to ask for refills. If you go to there motto page it says ""it's because of you we're continually striving to make sure every moment you choose to spend with us counts. But above all we know people come here to make their good times better."" If only management would read their own site. The part that really amused me most was were they say ""We want BJ's to be a place where the moment you leave is the moment you plan on coming back."" With cooks That can't cook a steak and slow servers?  I gave it two stars because I may in a weak moment go back. Maybe they had an off night, but a number reviews say the same thing. How many off nights can you have before the place is closed?"
Kasie B.,"Daytona Beach, FL",0,2,,3.0,5/9/2017,"I usually get takeout for this restaurant, but I was shopping with mom and she was craving a bison burger...So please forgive the butthurt response to horrible service ....So.. in we went, the front staff were apparently self-occupied and it took abit to capture their attention to be seated. If it had been busy with customers or staff, a delivery, or anything other then the girls watching television for 15 minutes, this would not been  mentioned.... Once seated our waiter was lovely, however.. when the food arrived it was all wrong, no appetizer, no salad for me and our burgers came 5 minutes after.shortly followed by the bill...so boo, no enjoyment time.. Mom's minus- her fries she ordered, and accompanied by a crazy amount of spicy coleslaw she didn't order..So, just to clarify.. yes, the coleslaw comes with it, it was substituted. To give credit where it's due, the food we recieved and wanted was very good as usual. It's just sad and unfair to the kitchen staff that things are so disorganized on the front. The DM.,GM., and front manager, seriously need to get with the floor staff and instill proper training. TAKEOUT is still a fantastic option till they sort it out!!!"
Qianlin L.,"Gainesville, FL",2,30,102,3.0,10/24/2015,"Come here once a week. Clam chowder and stuffed mushrooms are always my favorite. I like the happy hour it's really a good deal. Last night there was a guy server he was really nice, however, last week I came here with boyfriend, a black female server who serve us at the bar she was really rude. Keep ignoring us. Is it because we order not a lot food at the late night? Just because we ordered not a lot so we deserved the bad service? I was so disappointed that night. Anyway, it depends on what kind of server you get, food is great here."
James D.,"Belcamp, MD",6,35,52,5.0,11/8/2015,Enjoying my retirement from the military and stopped off in Daytona. Found this restaurant and decided to drop in. BEST DECISION EVER.  Ordered some lemon pepper chicken wings as a side and those were the best wings ever. This 0lace really cater to you as a guest. The deep dish pizza was FABULOUS.
Jim V.,"Ormond Beach, FL",2,34,,1.0,1/9/2017,This place has really gone down hill.  The last couple time were the pits.   Today I was there and it took over 45 minutes to get a bowl of soup..... the server came back after 30 minutes and said they ran out and were making fresh soup.   So during this hour and a half ordeal I never saw a manager nor did the server offer one even though I complained as to how absurd it was to take so long for soup.  We won't be back!!!!
Debbie K.,"Charleston, WV",42,34,55,3.0,9/28/2015,I am an odd eater since VGS so with being said I can only order certain things.  Today for lunch had broccoli cheddar soup its was okay nothing special but my options are limited.  Hubby had burger & fries he also said okay.  The menu was huge & several things I would have liked to try but not today.  I would not mark off my list.
Julie D.,"Wilmington, NC",380,1200,1382,4.0,7/25/2015,"We wanted to have dinner here because we are getting this restaurant in our area and wanted to try it out in advance.  That is the reason that some of these negative reviews did not detour us.  And our experience turned out to be a really good one. When we arrived, the parking lot was packed and we had to do a complete tour of the parking lot to find a space.  We were greeted and seated right away.  The restaurant interior is very large with lots and lots of seating.  We requested and got a semi circular booth.  Nice.  The best part was our service.  Our server could not have been more helpful, full of information and even gave his opinion, when we asked.   And attentive.  Incredible service for this type of restaurant. We started with a wedge salad with bacon and blue cheese.  Big enough for two to share.  Loved it.  And then we ended up ordering a pizza with a super thin crispy crust called The Spicy Pig.  Oh, yeah.  It has thinly sliced ham, smokey bacon, pineapple (my fav on pizza) and jalapeños and yummy cheese.  Loved this!  Delicious!  Really loved this place!"
Rita R.,"Port Orange, FL",0,23,,4.0,1/27/2017,The food was very good and more than enough .Was able to take home and have another meal or snack
Jyme N.,"DeLand, FL",11,4,,1.0,5/22/2016,"We were ignored at the door, ignored at our table.  We had to ask repeatedly for drink refills and our dirty dishes piled up at the end of the table. Our pizza came out wrong and we were handed a check for 2x the amount we ordered.  My husband said we will never go back."
Sonda J.,"Walterboro, SC",90,10,13,4.0,6/19/2016,"Stopped on the way to Orlando. Food was good,place was packed and our server was attentive. Deep dish pizza looks amazing."
Cynthia W.,"Ormond Beach, FL",4,2,,5.0,7/8/2016,"Food and service always great, my boyfriend and I visit here often. Friendly and pleasant staff, always a pleasure dining here! Great atmosphere!"
Bryan S.,"San Jose, CA",6,144,5,3.0,6/12/2016,Pretty good food. A decent lunch stop with a lot of options. But when a restaurant has a lot of good options it usually means that none of them are great.
