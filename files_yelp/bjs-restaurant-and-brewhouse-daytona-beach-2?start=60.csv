Paul C.,"Fern Park, FL",0,2,1,3.0,2/7/2015,"Service was great! Our waitress, Brittany M, was very attentive and detail driven. Brittany addressed all menu questions thoroughly and always had beverages topped off. Other staff members assigned to other tables would offer assistance to our table without a prompt. Food quality was mediocre and not cooked as requested.  Bottom line: I would only return for drinks and appetizers."
Ticia L.,"Waterbury, CT",51,15,1,5.0,3/13/2016,Fabulous service - great food. Everything was piping hot and fresh- definitely worth the 5 star rating. Waitress Brittany was outstanding!!
Courtney W.,"Daytona Beach, FL",50,337,195,2.0,2/25/2016,"We've been here twice, with very different opinions. The first time was early feb and we ordered pizza, wings, and root beer floats and everything was amazing, even the service was spot on. We even ranked it in our top places giving it 5 stars.  We went back the other night, not even a month later and things were just wrong. Our server was friendly at first but with every request we made she grew more and more resentful bordering on rude.  I ordered the root beer float again. Last time I had 3 floats, once price. This time the waitress wouldnt refill my float and when I asked why she said that I would be charged for the ice cream. No idea, so I said no but now fuming that she refused me something that I know I was able to have, having had it not 2 weeks prior. My husband ordered the brussel sprouts with his burger and I got friend chicken. We ordered the wings again too. The wings came out fast but the sauce was off, way too much tobacco to be edible. 2 mins later they bring out the brussel sprouts... we're confused why they're out early but ignore it. 3 mins later our meals are out... now we're pissed. Our waitress comes over like ''oh good everything here'' and we remind her that we ordered it to come out separate, that our dinner will be cold by the time we get to eat to eat it.'' her reply ''oh that's too bad, enjoy!'' Manners really were her thing, we'll leave it at that. The brussel sprouts were burnt.. like char broiled and bad so we sent them back. My friend chicken was wonderful and my husband enjoyed his burger. It was the one that had pulled pork on top, he inhaled it.  I really hope someone contacts me so I can go over this with them. I hate bad service but bad service paired with issues with food cant be ignored."
Virginia P.,"Miami, FL",396,82,350,5.0,1/25/2016,Their Jambalaya is delicious (and spicy!)! Love this place and all the deals they give you if you join the free rewards program.
Steve M.,"Daytona Beach, FL",1,34,,3.0,6/8/2016,I'm not usually on the fence with a review. A place is either great or not. BJ's was ok! The food was not Park Avenue but better quality than fast food. Our waitress was a doll. Very flirty and helpful. Would probably go back.
Dave L.,"Orlando, FL",0,8,,2.0,2/12/2016,Steak was tough thin fatty and greasy not worth $22. Go to outback or longhorn.   Cooked right Med rare.   Good fast service even though packed.
Toí D.,"Ormond Beach, FL",0,6,1,4.0,4/6/2016,"This restaurant/pub was exceptional. The food was great, I've been here multiple times, have no complaints. Their food is always fresh and made-to-order they're clean. They have exceptional service, and did I mention that the desserts are heavenly!"
Jose S.,"Plant City, FL",7,60,5,2.0,11/14/2015,"I usually have a good time at BJ's Brewhouse. Not today. If you want a waitress that doesn't smile, ask for Deborah. If you want to wait for 15 minutes in between her checking on you, ask for Deborah. She sucked. She made us wait waaaaaayyyyyy too long for drink refills, taking our order, taking our dessert order etc. we asked for a few minutes to decide what we wanted and it was a bad idea. She took at least 15 minutes to come back. Same thing with the dessert. But she waited 2.2 seconds to come back for the credit card.  I'll think long and hard before I go back."
Shannon H.,"North De Land, FL",203,161,481,3.0,4/18/2013,"My coworker and I stopped here for lunch today and this was our review The good:  We started out with Chicken wonton appetizers and Mozzarella sticks. The Chicken wontons come in tai or buffalo and you get 3 for about $3.00. We ordered the Tai ones and they were very good. I can tell that will be a dish I'll crave and go out of my way to get. The Mozzarella sticks were the best ones I've had from anywhere. They were crispy and flavorful as well as the cheese was nice and melted on the inside.  For lunch, I ordered half flatbread pizza (Black and Blue style) and my coworker ordered the Chicken Alfredo. My pizza was delicious! It had steak, Portabella mushrooms, red peppers, Mozzarella cheese and Blue cheese. It looked like it would be bland but from my first bite I was blown away by how well the blue cheese topped everything off. I'll definitely recommend it.  For dessert, we had a coupon for a free ""Pizookie"" Its basically a cookie baked in a small pizza pan and topped with ice cream as soon as it comes out. OMG talk about melt in your chair, roll your eyes back, and hold it in your mouth to savor the flavor!!! AMAZING! The Bad: I ordered a sweet tea and I received an unsweet tea, our waiter didn't come check on us, so I had to ask another waitress to get me sweet tea. She was very nice and pleasant but then my tea was pretty much Sugar water. I'm very particular about my sweet tea (Its the south in me) and its an honest mistake and a matter of preference.  We asked the waiter for boxes and he only brought us one box and I had to wait for my box for about 10 minutes because he got too busy taking everyone else's orders. My coworker liked her Chicken alfredo but said Red Lobster is way better. When I asked her what would make her lunch better she said its bland and could use some salt and other seasonings. She wasn't impressed. My pizza came with a side of salad and it didn't hardly have any dressing on it...order extra!  The appetizers were way better than the actual meals."
Samantha B.,"Springboro, OH",0,10,,4.0,10/4/2016,"Went here yesterday with a friend for a quick lunch. The restaurant was practically empty, so our service was probably quicker than usual. The food was pretty good too."
Michelle L.,"New Smyrna Beach, FL",0,8,,5.0,2/16/2016,"Chris was great! He didn't rush us, and was quick to refil our drinks. The food was amazing, as usual! Try the Mediterranean chicken pita tacos!"
Kate F.,"Brentwood, CA",40,3,4,5.0,3/4/2016,"I have been a long time customer of BJ's. I would like to take the time to say how AWESOME Brian is. He was our server at lunch today. He is highly knowledgeable, friendly and just an absolute pleasure. He definitely attended to all our needs. We never had to ask for anything. Please give him a pat on the back for being not only an all around nice guy and incredible server, but for being incredibly knowledgeable about the menu. He was an A+ in my book."
Rachel A.,"Manhattan, NY",541,43,141,3.0,9/19/2014,"Overview: After two morning flights, me and the group I was with were in town looking for a quick quality place to indulge. BJ's was up. Went for lunch and decided to order there soup and salad lunch special. Positives: We had a group of 7, which the hostesses were able to accommodate immediately, seating us very quickly. Our waiter was very friendly and informative about the menu. The beer choices were very robust and the food was good, but not anything special. Negatives: The biggest problem I had with BJ's is the menu size. They have everything from pasta to pizza and burgers to seafood. The menu can seem very overwhelming with nothing that stands out. The server took a while to get to us and take our order. Once the food was brought out to us, we were looking around to figure out how we could start eating. We were never given any utensils until after we asked. Verdict: BJ's seems to fall victim of an identity crisis. A place that is ok in everything and great at nothing. I would recommend BJ's so a group of people that may have very different food cravings, but would not recommend BJ's to a group that may not know what they crave."
Keri L.,"Ormond Beach, FL",15,10,10,4.0,1/26/2016,Calamari is a little over cooked and way too many tentacles! New jumbo spaghetti and meatballs was tasty. A bit spicy but I like it. Honey loves the fire roasted barbacoa chicken. As always love the Chandon split!! Monique is awesome!!!
Anthony N.,"Lincoln, RI",0,4,,2.0,10/12/2015,"In Dayton Beach for a college visit.  Thought we would try BJ'S  reviews were pretty good, however it was just another chain. Service was slow.  Upon entering no one was at the reception desk.   Once seated it took just about 15 minutes for a server to come to the table them another 20 minutes to bring water and drinks. Same with the meal and the food was not hot.  If you order a draft beer they put put a 2 inch head. Server did not even offer dessert. Not good... I would not come back."
Kelly H.,"Orlando, FL",771,346,383,1.0,12/5/2012,"I will start off by saying that I like BJ's overall as a restaurant (at least with my experiences in the Orlando area) but this particular BJ's was not up to par. My sister, cousin and I came here for lunch and were told to stand by the wall and we would be seated next.  Next thing we know, two parties who came in after us were being seated first because they forgot about us.  So as soon as we said something the manager made sure we were seated immediately. Once at out table, we were greeted by our waitress, Jessica.  She was very quick with us and didn't give off the best impression.  Once our orders were in, we sat and waited.  We finished our sodas at one point and were not refilled for about 10 minutes, and when she would bring us refills, the cups were not completely filled.  My cousin's beer did not come to the table until 20 minutes later.  My sister's food came out first and she was halfway through eating by the time my cousin and I got our food.  When I received my food, the chicken fettucini alfredo, it was cold.  I asked the waitress for hot alfredo sauce so I could poor it on to warm up my food and she pawned it off to another waitress and had an attitude.  The alfredo sauce never showed up after waiting 15 minutes for it and everyone at my table had finished their meals.  Jessica was very inattentive, rude, pawned everything off to other waiters, didn't apologize for anything and was an overall terrible serve.  She also kept my change assuming it was her tip....which is was not. We spoke to the manager and he was great.  He took my food and my cousin's beer off the bill and gave us all mystery gift cards to use the next time we come in that could be worth anywhere between $5 and $500. The only good experience I had was with the manager.  He at least knows how to make things up to the customers, although he needs to hire better staff."
Brian K.,"Appleton, WI",0,2,,3.0,7/8/2015,"We have been to this location 4 times and each time the food has been excellent. Their beers are decent and the craft sodas are excellent, especially the orange Cream soda. We have had various pizzas,  burgers, fish tacos with Mahi Mahi, and the Parmesan encrusted chicken ( my favorite so far). The food has kept us coming back. The service , however, leaves a lot to be desired. We always get seated in a reasonable amount of time. The wait staff is hit or miss. We have had something messed up on our order every time we have been here and the last time we went we didn't bother complaining about it. The food never comes out together and the salads and appetizers sometimes make it out after the entree. The food is 5 star for the price, but the wait staff and servers need some training."
Dori B.,"Ocala, FL",4,7,1,5.0,10/11/2015,Great Atmosphere wide menu selection the food was really good! Will definitely be back
Eric W.,"Toledo, OH",5,12,5,5.0,7/28/2014,"Stopped here for lunch. Extensive food selection, almost overwhelming. The bison burger was delicious. The atmosphere was very clean, sophisticated and modern.  The waitstaff was very friendly and attentive, our food & drinks were delivered quickly and it seems like our server was very knowledgeable about both the food and beer selections. BJs has a very expansive selection of private label beers and craft brews. No doubt a discerning beer lover will find something to their liking."
Myles C.,"Deltona, FL",17,17,10,1.0,7/16/2015,"Over priced, extremely small portions. Waitress was very  inattentive. Your money goes into all of the decorations they have not the portion size."
