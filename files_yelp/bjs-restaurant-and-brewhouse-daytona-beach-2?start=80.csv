Matt S.,"St. Augustine, FL",63,515,58,4.0,6/14/2015,"While the wife and I were in town for a NASCAR event, we decided to stop into BJ's for some dinner and drinks. Very easy to get to from 95, plenty of parking, and there's plenty of seating available, so even if it's busy, it won't take long to get a table. We grabbed a seat at the bar to check out their beer taps and grab some grub. Bartender was great, and service was awesome. I'm always impressed by the selection of draft beers at BJ's, and their house drafts are pretty tasty, although I usually grab a Sam Adams. The menu is pretty impressive, offering a lot of different appetizers and main courses, including a few items you wouldn't expect to see at a place like this. We just ordered a couple of appetizers, and the food came out fairly quickly, it was fresh, and most importantly, very tasty. Every time I've visited a BJ's I've had a very good experience, the service is usually great, and the food has always been good. I especially enjoy the quality of the drinks and the draft beer selection. You expect this to be some kind of sports bar but it's far from it. Great place to have lunch, dinner, or stop in for some drinks and hang out. Nice atmosphere, good food, great drinks, and great service. I will be stopping by again."
Joseph H.,"Tacoma, WA",367,204,122,3.0,3/27/2013,Ok so this place as far as food goes is nothing special. They have really nice sports bar food. Offer Pizzas which are not bad but not amazing. There sandwiches are pretty tasty but again nothing amazing. They have some pretty good salads i will say. My favorite thing about all BJs across the country are there beer and appetizers. The both of them are pretty good. I have been to lots of BJs across the country and this place is just like the rest....chain food dinning......so its pretty much always the same.  The service was nothing amazing or special either and thats why i have to give this place a just ok 3 star
Beth N.,"Blacksburg, VA",0,4,,4.0,7/1/2014,"Good food, decent beer, decent service. My husband, 10 month old daughter, and I stopped here for dinner on a Monday night. We were seated within a few minutes, though I could tell the hostess and waitress were not excited about an infant in the party. The atmosphere was typical for a sports bar - but not too loud that you couldn't converse, music was fine, lots of tvs to watch, a bit chilly for shorts and a short sleeve shirt.  My husband was very disappointed by their beer menu. They list many specialty beers and seasonals, none of which were available when we stopped. They didn't have the first two beers he tried to order, even though they were on the menu. He ended up with a beer sampler of their year round brews. The IPA was pretty good; rest were mediocre, but he has pretty high standards. We ordered the appetizer sampler and a small deep dish pizza, and it was more than the three of us could eat. The avocado rolls were our favorites. The spinach and artichoke dip and mozzarella sticks were pretty classic. The other rolls on the platter tasted like spicy Taquitos (not in a bad way). We also had the Chicken Bacon Ranch pizza, which was very good. We would definitely get it again. The server warmed up to us after she realized our child wasn't a screamer/food thrower. Other servers stopped to say hi to her, too. I would say this place is not ""family friendly,"" but certainly ""family tolerant."" Overall, we thought it was a little overpriced, but the food was very good quality. We would stop here again."
Debbie A.,"West Milton, OH",12,8,6,5.0,11/9/2015,"The made on premise root beer is the smoothest and most flavorful I have ever had, a true craft root beer.  Also love the fantastic chicken bacon flatbread!  Highly recommend it!"
Joana G.,"Columbus, GA",3,6,,1.0,3/13/2015,"Went to BJ's tonight (party of 7). We were seated right away. Sat at our table for 30minutes, at least. We were never offered drinks or appetizers. After 15 minutes 3 of us walking in at different times asking to be served and still got nothing. It took us getting up and walking away for someone to ask us what was wrong. By that time, half of our group was too upset so we left and went across the street."
Justine C.,"Turtle Lake, ND",19,16,34,4.0,12/15/2014,Nice place with lots of beer and food to choose from. Been to the one in Huntington Beach Calofornia and they have great pizza!!
Charles T.,"Port Orange, FL",18,5,1,3.0,5/16/2015,"Been here a number of times. Good food and service, but a bit pricey. Beer is expensive and their in house craft brews aren't anything special. Still worth a trip once in a while."
Jackie S.,"Daytona Beach, FL",28,325,329,1.0,3/16/2012,"The atmosphere of BJ's is incredible, it is very spacious inside, and has a trendy metro-feel to it.  When I asked our server about what she would recommend from the menu and her only suggestion was a mixed greens salad.  I had the Baby Back Pork Ribs entree, with the mixed vegetable and a baked potato. My fiance had the New York strip steak, which arrived overcooked, with a Caesar salad and a baked potato.  My entree arrived ahead of my fiance's and it was cold, the baked potato was undercooked (it was still hard in the center), and the mixed vegetable was mostly broccoli (which is okay, but not what the server said it would be). When my fiance's steak arrived, you could tell immediately that it had been overcooked, he had requested it to be cooked medium-rare, it arrived past the point of well-done. Our server really didn't seem to care that much since she stated, ""I told you to get the salad."" Seriously? You've got to be kidding me.  Overall, the meal and the service are deserving of ZERO stars. I can honestly say that I don't think I will ever return."
Emily E.,"Port Orange, FL",3,58,,2.0,5/3/2016,"In the past, I've eaten here and the food was terrible. I tried them again this past week and the food was great but the service was down right bad. Our server seemed very interested in the table next to us, so interested that we were forgotten. She never asked how the food was, and waited over 15 minutes just for a refill. She spent most of her time hanging over the table next to us. The manager hovered at the other table as well speaking with those customers. When I presented a coupon that I found on their website, I was told that I had to sign up for their rewards program to redeem it, even though it doesn't state so on the coupon or website. We told the server that we didn't wish to speak with a manager we would just sign up and move on with our night, but she sent the manager over who just made matters worse. She wasn't interested in hearing what the website/coupon said. So I just told her that we filled out the rewards information and we needed to leave. Not worth coming back to this location. It seems very hit or miss."
Jill D.,"Waterford, WI",0,13,,4.0,6/16/2016,"This pizza was really good- we ordered the deep dish, and we ate all but 2 pieces between 3 of us. Our 2 younger kids had the chicken tenders and they really liked them- gobbled them right up. The root beer machine wasn't working- really wanted to try the root beer."
Jerry w.,"Tucson, AZ",0,31,21,3.0,5/2/2015,Very nice restaurant the food is excellent and the service is great. The only recommendation I have is to have the staff in clean crisp ironed uniform. Our server looked as if she just rolled out of bed wearing the same outfit from yesterday. The staff's look is important when you run such a nice establishment. It's worth addressing ! Otherwise it would have been 5 stars.
Brooke L.,"Denver, CO",8,34,2,1.0,4/10/2016,I am extremely disappointed in the level of service we received when visiting Daytona. We called a week in advance to make a large reservation for a big party. Our reservation was given out to another party so we were stuck outside on the patio. We were given 3 or 4 servers that we barely saw and took an unnecessary amount of time to get drinks. It took us 45 minutes to get our food and we had to go in and recruit another server to get us refills because we never saw our servers after food orders were taken. There was no communication for the untimely manner that food arrived at the table. When we asked to see a manager we were told we couldn't because he was cooking. Well if they were short staffed that should have been said early on... we would then understand the food arriving 45 minutes after ordering.  I'm very upset because this was a big dinner and supposed to be be a happy and pleasant experience for me and my kids. I could not be more unhappy with this establishment and the company as a whole. I will be contacting corporate.
Kim W.,"DeLand, FL",238,305,19,4.0,12/25/2013,"Lately we have mostly come here for happy hour. The deals change and the servers never seem to know what the specials are. I guess there is a high turnover. The food is good. I like the calamari. For happy hour it is usually 1/2 price. I also order the ahi tuna salad, which is delicious and huge. They even give you a decent amount of tuna, which at some places is not always the case. The fish tacos are also a good choice. The menu is huge, so you should be able to find something to your liking."
Theresa G.,"New Orleans, LA",11,13,,4.0,8/27/2015,"I moved to Palm Coast in the summer of 2013, and it was during that summer that I first went to BJ's.  I can't remember the food, but I can remember the dessert hence my 4 star rating.  I got their version of beignets..and to completely honest I was prepared to hate it and judge it harshly.  I'm from New Orleans so I KNOW beignets.  However, it..met my expectations.  They had their own spin on beignets..and they were damn good.  I went there again specifically for that dessert.  So I am unable to knock it.  It's great!  I'm sure the food was good too but 2 yrs later all I remember is the dessert.  I remember the waitress is the one that recommended it.  So obvs great service and kudos to whoever she was.  I liked the atmosphere too.  But mostly...mmmmm BEIGNETS.  I'm surprised none of the 60 plus pics on this site had that dessert."
Jerome K.,"Chesterton, IN",4,62,109,4.0,4/29/2015,Great atmosphere and across the street from the Daytona Speedway.  Try the brew house burger and shoestring fries.  Very good service to accompany the good food.
Sara S.,"Ormond Beach, FL",16,55,9,3.0,5/23/2015,"Service is good, food is ok nothing spectacular. It's a chain so it's predictable. The pizza is good, everything Else I've have had there is average."
Leanne W.,"Riverdale, NJ",131,4,2,4.0,8/10/2015,"This is one place I can't get at home!! Therefore BJ's is a must-stop dinner spot when in the Daytona area. We sat in the bar area and the waiter was extremely attentive from the beginning. He described the specials. I ordered the Cherry Glazed Salmon, which was cooked to perfection and was delicious. They have so many craft beers and mixed drinks, it's hard to choose! Plus, it's a good spot to watch a ball game!!"
Terri S.,"Altamonte Springs, FL",3,55,2,4.0,6/8/2014,"Delish!! A friend of mine and i stopped here and we just loved it. We had an appetizer plate for lunch and it was all so amazingly delicious. There is one in Orlando that i definitely want to go to (i live there) because i hear how good the hamburgers are. The Pazookie was AMAZING..we got chocolate all around.... I do not drink so did not try the beers, so unfortunately, i can't comment on that."
John A.,"Flagler Beach, FL",0,14,,2.0,3/15/2015,Big and modern restaurant in Daytona Beach. Getting a seat was confusing as the server did not know where to seat us in the only half full restaurant..  My burger arrived almost cold. I did not sent it back deciding not to create any issues. The meat was bland and did not hold together...it was all crumbly. The baked potato I ordered was fine.  We waited over 10 minutes after the check was given to us  for the waiter to return. We finally got up and went to the entry  greeting table by the door to pay. They too had difficulty finding the waiter.  Last time we waste our time at BJ's Restaurant.
Daren G.,"Houston, TX",5,34,,1.0,5/10/2015,Great service when you wait 20 minutes then give your table away despite being there and acknowledging the buzzer.  Then telling you it will be another 20-30 mins for a table. Too much choice around to accept poor service. See ya.
