Laura R.,"Highland Village, TX",0,10,12,4.0,10/16/2017,"The food and service is great here! The problem is.. their website is lacking. We live not 3 blocks from here and when we go to the website you can't order delivery (which is an option). When we choose our address it states..""No delivery within 100 miles"". Really??  Recommendation to corporate... This location has awesome service and food! If your website gives the option for delivery (which it does) then you had better offer it or take it off your website."
Alisha S.,"Rowlett, TX",142,92,125,4.0,10/22/2017,"Celebrated a friend's birthday here. I ate dinner before I came, so I decided to get a cookies n cream pizookie (I'm always down for dessert). It was soooo good! I love the concept of pizookies and this one did not disappoint! It ended up being half off too, so I only paid $3! Service is the only reason why I knocked a star off because they were a little rude."
Bill Ruff T.,"Quinlan, TX",22,168,78,5.0,8/7/2017,"Had lunch here after looking at a travel trailer. The bar was a great place to sit. The food was hot but the fish frying grease needs to be changed more often. Craft beers are great. Easy on and easy off for parking. Place was clean and well organized, restrooms were clean and nice. Staff is friendly and polite."
Geoffrey G.,"Denton, TX",109,258,350,3.0,6/9/2017,"BJ's is a great place to go watch a game and have a drink!  Other times it's a really loud, average bar/restaurant.  They have a great selection of beer on tap.  They make a lot of their own beers that are pretty good.  It is a little pricy compared to all the local craft bars in the area. Food is pretty decent.  They seem to be making an effort to get some more healthy options on their menu.  We tried the roasted cauliflower and the beets.  Both were good, but prices are a little high.   If you are going for a nice dinner or date, than this is not the best place for you.  This is a loud and busy place that's much better suited for watching a game or going out with friends.  They have a ton of tvs all around the restaurant."
Sarah W.,"Fort Worth, TX",43,13,1,1.0,12/17/2017,This place is terrible. I don't get it. They over cooked my chicken tenders and everything was average.
Angela E.,"Denton County, TX",85,84,78,5.0,9/17/2017,I've always had great service at this location. I've only sat in the bar area but I still get great and fast service. Food is great! I've had 2 of the different pazookies they have. I can't wait to try more. It always looks busy but going to the bar area I've never had to wait. Staff is very friendly and place always looks clean. Make sure to check their daily specials. Monday is half off selected pizzas!
Raheem F.,"Garland, TX",5,28,33,4.0,11/28/2017,"Came here for my best friend's birthday a couple of weeks ago and our experience was good but not the best. The waiter wasn't very friendly and didn't seem to be having the best day and it was very apparent by the service we received. Food wise, I split the jalapeño crispy burger with a friend and it was quite disappointing. The whole burger tasted unsalted. The meat was bland, the fried jalapeños were tasteless and the burger was just flavorless. The fries were pretty dry as well. I also shared the chocolate chip pizookie with a friend which was the highlight of our visit here. It truly is what Bj's does best. I think I'm just going to stick to ordering desserts here. Overall, my best friend still had a good time with us and she didn't let a bit of bad service ruin her night."
Rox R.,"Highland Village, TX",57,85,294,4.0,2/14/2017,"This joint is in my rotation. I like coming here after a hard day's work for a good drink and grub and just unwind. They have a wide selection of  . Though I'm not really a beer person I would have a beer every now and then. Not to mention they have a huge menu. So there's always something for everyone to enjoy. Servers are great, friendly and knowledgeable. Definitely be back again...."
Greg B.,"Denton, TX",18,33,54,4.0,1/26/2017,"This place has surprisingly become one of our new favorites in Denton. That also has a lot to do with the great location right next to the Cinemark and the times that they're open. They stay open until 12am most nights. The service is usually pretty good, although there's been a couple instances where we've waited longer than usual just to be greeted by the host and given a table. I'm talking several minutes of looking at open tables and for assistance with no acknowledgement of our existence.  I'll say though, they've definitely made up for it with the delicious food and drinks we've had here. We typically get our food pretty fast after ordering, and the waiters that have serviced us have all been outstanding and friendly. This restaurant has an enormous menu, so much so that you might be overwhelmed by the vast amount of entrees and drinks offered.  They surprisingly have really tasty boneless wings with several sauces to choose from. On this particular night I had the Spicy BBQ sauce, which I've had here before on my wings and they're very good! Super crunchy, hot, and full of juicy chicken with the perfect amount of sauce slathered on them. Their root beer glaze flavor is also delicious. Ariel went with the Mediterranean tacos, which she loved! She also loves their sandwiches. They also have delicious pizzas and desserts. Particularly the pizookies and monkey bread! Even though we've been several times, there's still so much on the menu to try, which we both look forward to very soon!"
Adrienne T.,"Denton, TX",0,23,7,4.0,11/2/2017,"Great service!  Love the daily specials. Had the brisket and bacon burger- mmmmmm!  One of the best burgers!  Great atmosphere, great service, great food!"
Judy R.,"Denton, TX",8,149,,5.0,10/31/2017,+Love the selection of veggies. -cheddar cheese couscous is my favorite...no wait the beets with feta cheese...no wait I think 1 I like the cauliflower best. NO time to decide? Just point and order. You won't go wrong with any selection.
Magnus L.,"Denton, TX",95,603,258,3.0,5/14/2016,"I like the variety they have on their menu, you have to be a picky eater to not find anything you like on their menu. Their Atlantic salmon is one of my favorite dishes here. Really good flavors and it's supposedly not farmed which is great.  They sometimes get a little busy at night but they usually get you a table pretty quickly."
Tiffany K.,"Shady Shores, TX",85,25,8,1.0,2/26/2017,"I was here for lunch today with friends, it was a busy, understandably so, it's a Sunday. I orders the lemon thyme chicken. A lunch size portion of herb-roasted chicken breast seasoned with Big Poppa Smokers' Desert Gold Rub. Served with brown rice, sautéed red onions, fire-roasted red bell peppers, tomatoes and roasted brussels sprouts in lemon thyme sauce. Sounded good & looked good too. I was brought a bowl with brown liquid with two pieces of chicken, not oven roasted, look like it was boiled. No bright colored oven roasted peppers or Brussels sprouts. It was a brownish collard sauce with mushrooms and and over cook brussels sprouts, couldn't find one pop of color in the whole plate, look disgusting. I took a bite just to see it could taste good ? No I politely called the waiter over and told him that there was no way I was going to eat... Go ahead and just bring me a turkey burger, he apologized and said yeah doesn't look right. The turkey burger shows up looks great cut it in half? Something doesn't look right it's raw. It's raw???  i'm so glad I did not take a bite of it. I was shocked that any cook whatever do that, my 14-year-old nephew knows how to cook a turkey patty and he knows that you can't lay it on the grill for one second. In my heart I honestly feel that it was done to me on purpose because I sent the first plate back. I wished I would've taken a picture of the first plate of food, it was disgusting looking. Very rarely do I send my feedback or complain but when I am paying $13 for a lunch that looks nothing like what I ordered I'm not going to just eat the cost and throw in the trash. I'm now feeling so upset that anyone would do that! The manager came over and apologized saw the raw turkey burger &  acknowledged that it was raw. She asked if I wanted anything else ?   No thank you.  she took it off my bill and we left. I love BJ's in Louisville. I've had nothing but problems with the Ditton store and will not be going back there."
Lily H.,"Denton, TX",0,1,,1.0,10/13/2017,"I just went here yesterday, with a group of 9 friends. Terrible service from our waiter, Collin, I believe. Three of my friends were wrongfully charged 3$ each for food they did not order. Told the waiter and he acted upset at us. He did not change any of the checks, and took too long to even pick the checks up.  Also took very long on refills on drinks. Very upsetting, especially since the friends had to end up paying 3$ each just because our waiter was rude and stubborn. Will not be coming back to this location."
Kelly S.,"Galveston, TX",0,54,,3.0,12/7/2017,"The service was great but why on earth would we want to sit in a section where someone is giving a training class with slides and a mic?  It was very difficult to have a conversation and not be distracted.  If you are going to let someone use part of restaurant for an ""event"" then let them have a room or section and don't sit other patrons there."
Cc C.,"Denton, TX",0,10,1,2.0,9/20/2017,"This was one of my favorite places for meals with the family and on birthdays and special occasions.  I had the deep dish single pizza and a wedge salad.  The salad tasted like the lettuce had not been washed, but I ate it anyway.  Within an hour of leaving I was so sick and threw up.  I called and asked for the manager and was told he would call me back because he was not available.  The next day still no follow up. I called again and tracked down the manager this time insisting to speak with him.  He said he was busy with big groups and hadn't had the time to call me back.  He insisted that his food didn't make me sick.  I was extremely disappointed how the manager handled the issue and I will never go back."
J D.,"Denton, TX",0,330,4,4.0,6/29/2017,"We do carry out here a lot....and they tend to get things wrong. Missing cheese on a burger, missing side, really bad cut of meat, etc. I think this last trip is the last for a while."
Robyn A.,"Denton, TX",179,50,54,4.0,11/30/2016,"It doesn't matter what I get here, I know it's going to be fabulous. The food is incredible. I love their beers. Service is pretty consistently good. My only complaint about this location is the acoustics in the building itself. It is LOUD. It doesn't matter if it's Saturday night or Wednesday at lunch, but I know there isn't much that can be done about this."
Regina B.,"Charleston, SC",23,27,1,3.0,6/17/2017,"Love the food, friendly, helpful staff and they have a great Bourbon selection. However, the music is so loud and manic it feels like an arcade. Couldn't wait to get out. Would have stayed and had a few drinks, but man was it chaotic."
Sam W.,"Milford, PA",0,30,8,4.0,6/16/2017,"Good beer and draft selection. Definitely worth a stop if you're looking for some quick food and some beer. It gets pretty busy here at times especially during the dinner service. If you come later it's usually a better experience. Atmosphere isn't too bad for a bar either. I recommend this place to anyone traveling through Denton, TX."
J R.,"Dallas, TX",0,11,,2.0,6/28/2017,"$12, 13 or even $16 for a salad?  Really? So, I ordered the Top Sirloin, though mine came out more like a mushy, run over by a fork lift sirloin.  On top of that, I had not even finished my salad when the entree was presented. That is DEAD WRONG!  No excuse for this as the place was only about 15% full, though not surprising when one looks at the menu prices.  Note that the sandwiches on the ""Hoagie Rolls"" are mostly bread in their pictures.   Our first time back in more than a year and all we noted were inflated prices. No thanks and will not be back for overpriced food that is marginal at best."
Edie G.,"Henderson, NV",115,1,,2.0,7/19/2017,"We usually have a great experience at our local BJ's and frequent it up to 3 times a week. Tonight we ordered a burger medium and it came back very rare and the bacon was undercooked as well. Good customer service would dictate comping the corrected meal, but it was not. Also we specifically came in for happy hour, but were over charged. When we questioned the price, it was not corrected. The policy should be honored by all staff. Poor customer service. It is unfortunate as we have several nearby restaurants to choose from and will not be regular customers anymore."
Nancy C.,"Lake Dallas, TX",0,7,2,5.0,9/27/2017,Great food and and a fun atmosphere. I love their light menu. Food tastes like it is packed with calories but it's not. Great place to go to watch a football game and have dinner.
Puro S.,"Dallas, TX",3,105,165,1.0,7/31/2016,"Food: 2/10 (+2 for stuffed mushrooms) Service: 3/10 Value: 5/10 Ambience: 6/10 TL;DR - Huge mistake coming here. Hope you all have a better luck. Came here with my family. The place was not overly packed, but it took the server 10 minutes to take drink orders and 5 min to bring them. We confirmed we wanted the appetizer out before the main dish when asked, but lo and behold -- everything came out at the same time 20 minutes later. My sirlion was tiny and was definitely almost well done instead of medium rare. I didn't want to wait another 20 minute for another puny piece of meat, so I ate it with disgust. It came with 5 pieces of asparagus and tasteless mashed potato all for ~$16 I believe. Glad I didn't order the $22 ribeye. The salmon dish looked nothing like the picture. It was barely half the size. The shrimp pasta dish was not good I'm guessing because only the shrimps were eaten, and we didn't take the rest of pasta home (mostly untouched). The price is definitely on the high side for what you get including the poor service. I would recommend sticking with appetizer and maybe burgers for this place. Anything else would just be throwing money away."
David H.,"Keller, TX",1,5,,5.0,1/30/2017,"This place. It's the bomb. dot. com. For a chain restaurant, they've done something right. From the soothingly corporate interior, to the delightfully kitschy beer selection, BJ's is everything I could hope for in a chain. Their half price wine night is on point, and the pizookie is not to be missed. Dynamite."
April P.,"Lewisville, TX",3,9,47,3.0,8/14/2016,"BJ's is usually decent. May have just been the night. There was a 45+ minute wait. The A/C was broken,  it was crowded and hot. They ran out of menus so our entire party had to share one menu. The sweet tea wasn't sweet and the sodas flat. Our appetizers arrived nice and hot but that was just about it. Luckily those were free with the Yelp app offer. The food was rushed and under cooked. Our waiter running around like crazy."
Keith W.,"Denver, CO",21,145,10,4.0,12/31/2015,"Nice location next to cinemark 14. Food is a bit pricy but worth the price along with the sheer variety of drinks.  Kinda crowded on weekends,but the have a nice texting system in place to compensate."
Hannelore L.,"Denton, TX",229,18,6,4.0,1/11/2017,"This is a place where you can go at any time and eat anything. We like it here - sometimes it is rather noisy. Foods we have eaten: ribs, salads, tuna, pizza, brussel sprouts (my favorite) and so much more. The Pizookie makes for a nice dessert to share."
Elizabeth P.,"Denton, TX",0,11,,5.0,7/26/2016,"I love there food and drinks,  really like there desserts the chocolate chip one is amazing. They have great alcohol and happy hour. Love the half price wine"
Tray H.,"Decatur, TX",57,3,,1.0,1/8/2017,Just recently ate here and the waitress was very rude towards us when we asked another waiter for help and was giving us a lot of attitude and made us feel really uncomfortable! Very unprofessional but it was handled accordingly by the manager! Food was great though!! #notip
Jolene C.,"Denton, TX",18,18,27,5.0,2/26/2016,"Our server Joi D was amazing. Very pleasant and sweet. Both me and my husband got the Ahi Tuna salad, and at first we thought there was less tuna on it until we realized it was just cut thicker. (We assume it's portioned or weighed out per plate.) We both agreed we liked it better cut thicker, it seemed to have a better taste that way. Anyway. Great job, we love eating at our Denton location and it's amazing every time and we are never disappointed!! Thanks for the coupons too!!"
The D.,"Denton, TX",0,46,1,4.0,11/15/2016,"Food is excellent depending on whos cooking haven't figured that one out yet, good atmosphere. Sports TV but not too overwhelming, like some of these places service is up and down but a decent place to eat for the family Denton needs more restaurants up scale type in this vein"
Dave C.,"Flower Mound, TX",1,25,7,3.0,8/28/2016,"Average. Fat belly beer crowd. Service ok, food is basic. Menu same as everyone else. Very limited in Scotch, Bourbon, Wine options. Nice trim. Still lower class atmosphere. If you like cool, upscale, trendy or hip this is not it."
Riley L.,"Denton, TX",128,176,58,4.0,2/8/2015,"The beer that BJ's actually brewed is really good, but it's all over $5.25 a glass, so that hurts. The food was pretty good, but it was about the same level as Chilis, TGI Fridays, and Applebees. Service was great though and we had a really good time just sitting and talking. Didn't feel rushed at all and continued to get good service the entire time we were there. The beer is worth a try but it's expensive and the food is on par with all the other chains, but there is a huge selection of everything. I think this spot is just fine for meeting up and chillin with your friends if you don't feel like going to downtown Denton and hitting East Side or Oak Street Draft House"
Stephanie A.,"Wylie, TX",0,1,,1.0,5/13/2017,"WORST EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE. the other night me and my family went out for dinner to celebrate. Our serve had a awful attitude, he acted like he didn't care to be at work or even to take out order for that matter. He brought out the wrong food then proceeded to tell me ""well you ordered this."" Then the whole meal went on just like that. Our drinks were refilled only after they were empty, and after we made a comment it seems he stayed away from our table as much as he could. Just a bad attitude. Terrible service. I talked to a manger he was very polite and he made me somewhat want to return but just warning you if you get a server named Reid I suggest you ask for another server."
Scott W.,"Denton, TX",87,17,,5.0,9/25/2016,Been there a few time. They have Great food and Awesome service. Love taking my wife out to eat here.
K P.,"Hays, KS",18,3,,4.0,6/9/2016,The menu (food and drinks) is huge! Service was great and we had a nice time. Jakob was a great server (June 2016)
Yolie F.,"Denton, TX",4,19,52,5.0,9/22/2014,The handcrafted beers are great!!! The staff are great people and very attentive!!! The food is great!!!  So close to home ...perfect and dangerous!!
Minh T.,"Denton, TX",0,75,,1.0,1/20/2017,"Had not been back here in awhile so wanted to try them again.  It was around 8:30 on a Sunday, we were seated right away.  Service was friendly and prompt but the food was to die of and not to die for.  The calamari was drenched in oil. Then came the entrees and they were just basically reheated food with the Barbacoa chicken and a personal pizza.  Both entrees were not even heated thoroughly and were just lukewarm. Overpriced to pay for pre-made foods. Bad business model."
Josh-Daniel S. D.,"Lewisville, TX",76,25,2,5.0,7/19/2015,"The menu has a lot of variety.  They're a brewhouse, so half the menu is alcohol.  Still, there are a few well behaved kids, and they fit in fine. For this visit, I ordered blackened salmon.  The waitress was very knowledgeable, and made a good recommendation.  The salmon was properly cooked, and had great flavor.  I've tried several places, and everywhere else has been overcooked.  Here, it's still moist and flaky. My wife is allergic to wheat and dairy, and BJ's has an allergen menu.  It's kind of limited and difficult, but the waitress understood well and had recommended modifications to normal items. Timing is average - not rushed, but not slow.  Waitstaff never left us hanging, and drinks were refilled before empty.  At delivery, the runner asked if it looked right.  Half way through, the waitress verified it tasted good.  At the end, the manager verified the whole experience was okay. Overall, very pleased, and we were in and out in less than an hour, during lunch, on a Sunday."
