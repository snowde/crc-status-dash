Bill S.,"Corinth, TX",3,12,,4.0,8/1/2016,"My wife and I really enjoy BJs, great menu.  My wife loves the fish and chips.  My only problem is I have yet to have a pazookie, to full after the meal.  Service is always great, and the beers are fun to try."
Scott M.,"Aubrey, TX",16,59,19,5.0,8/27/2016,We had a great time at BJ's. My wife and son picked me up from work and we decided to go somewhere nearby. BJ's has always been one of our favorite spots to eat and this location was no exception. They were great! The service was excellent and the food was amazing.  I usually get a burger when I go to BJ's but I felt like something liter this time. I got this bacon chicken ranch wrap and it was really good. I recommend that you go check them out.
David H.,"Corinth, TX",1,13,3,4.0,1/26/2015,Yummy  The food here is good.  The atmosphere is awesome. The service staff is superb. Have a great takeout service curbside. They have a tremendously large variety of beer. The happy hour specials are really good and worth it.
Saskia W.,"Corinth, TX",23,3,,5.0,3/21/2016,"BJs Brewhouse is a staple favorite of our family since we first moved to DENTON over a year ago. The food is great, atmosphere is family friendly yet great for a couples night out. The staff is always pleasant and courteous. Consistently a great experience every time we visit which is why we keep coming back."
TP L.,"Lewisville, TX",35,2,,1.0,7/6/2016,Came in late one night and went to the bar. My buddy went to the restroom. I ordered a drink. Buddy came back. We both waited for him to be served. I wanted a menu so was going to hit the bartender up for one when he took the drink order. No one really there as far as customers. Bartender kept walking by real fast like he was really doing some important stuff and talking to staff members at end of the bar. Maybe there was a problem I don't know. We waited a while. I finally put a ten dollar bill on the bar for my beer and we got up and left and went next door. Very odd.
Anna D.,"Denton, TX",78,125,2,1.0,4/13/2016,If you are gluten free avoid this place. I have given up on all BJs because of cross contamination issues. The service here has typically been subpar as well. If you can have gluten and don't mind crappy service head on in.
Deborah H.,"Corinth, TX",37,19,1,5.0,2/14/2016,We visited this restaurant for lunch.  We were promptly seated in a booth.  Waited on immediately.  Ordered drinks and appetizer which were great!  The atmosphere was nice.  The location of this restaurant is very convenient right off of Highway 35E S. In Denton.  I know BJ's can get very busy for dinner service this restaurant has ample parking for those busy times.  I would highly recommend visiting this particular BJ's.
Deborah D.,"Argyle, TX",0,6,,4.0,6/13/2016,"The menu is large, different from normal bar food and the food is tasty. We had a great waitress too! Definitely going back again! A little pricey, especially mixed drinks. Although, the atmosphere is classy, yet still kid friendly."
Lorena M.,"Midlothian, TX",0,26,1,5.0,2/5/2016,"The menu has so much variety and the atmosphere is great for any occasion! There's truly something for everyone. If you're wanting some comfort food, you can indulge in that or you can choose one of their lighter options. I've tried the gluten free pizza, but you could never tell! It was delicious and I continued the rest of my night without any unnecessary bloating or discomfort. I hope that's not TMI."
Danny E.,"Dallas, TX",43,8,11,5.0,2/2/2016,"I feel like the rather low rating of this restaurant reflects the typical yelp bias against franchises and chains.  This location in particular has stellar service and an awesome atmosphere. No need for me to recommend one dish or another, pick anything. They've been serving the same menu for quite some time now and have perfected the food as much as is possible at the price point offered. The place is packed virtually every night. Obviously there are hundreds of satisfied repeat customers. I'm one of them."
Matt B.,"Denton, TX",0,19,,5.0,1/31/2016,"This place is great. The food is a little pricey, but you're paying for quality. The staff is always super nice, friendly, and cordial. The beers that they brew themselves are the best."
Kelly R.,"Magnolia, AR",30,10,35,5.0,3/15/2015,"Great location, outstanding customer service with a lot of class, smiles and authentic individual personalities! This is the best BJ's I have been to! Had the wedge salad, was crisp and garnished beautifully. Had the Italian Market Thin Crust pizza..... Great choice! When in Denton TX..... STOP AT BJ'S PIZZA!"
Rene F.,"Denton, TX",0,37,2,4.0,12/8/2014,"Went there for a second time after a round of golf and ate in the bar area. My waitress was outstanding consistently checking on me, my drinks and appetizer arrived promptly.  The manager also checked on me and we had a great conversation regarding the company's customer service philosophy.  I've had a great experience each time I visited so I will certainly return.   My only issue was the Cajun Pasta could have been better because it didn't have that Cajun taste I expected but everything else was very good.  Sorry I'm from New Orleans and I'm very critical when it comes to Cajun food."
Mr I.,"Denton, TX",13,3,,4.0,11/14/2016,"Our experience at dinner was not about the food but all about the service.  Our server Bailey was incredible.  I would eat here every night because of her. Thank you for hiring her.  Now, do all you can to retain and promote her so she is a permanent fixture within the BJs  family of restaurants."
Meghann P.,"Dallas, TX",18,6,1,2.0,9/6/2015,"The Long Island ice tea was amazing. So was the home brewed cream soda. I loved the calamari, husband wasn't crazy about it.  The reason I'm only giving two stars, it took 15 mins to even order drinks and appetizers, another 15 mins to order two cheeseburgers and then over an hour to actually get our orders. We never received our food before we talked to manager to cancel our orders. We plan on trying it again, next time when we've got more time to spare, but we ended up late to our movie."
Lorna M.,"Valley View, TX",0,14,1,2.0,11/6/2016,Went for dinner for my birthday wasn't my 1st choice but the restaurant across the highway was swamped. We were able to get seated right away ordered the same steaks we usually order at the other place and was expecting a larger steak for the price. Steak was dry an salad was not nearly as good we don't drink but the tea was ok. The waitress was the best part of the dinner. We will not return
Alice N.,"Garland, TX",0,7,,3.0,9/24/2016,"My party reserved ahead of time, and the restaurant made us wait for more than an hour. It was ridiculous because other parties walked straight in, while my party had to wait forever (granted, our party was huge). Food was actually decent but I didn't see the rave about pazoookie. Like it's literally and cookie with cake, but it was still pretty good."
Tami W.,"Denton, TX",0,6,,5.0,4/24/2016,We were there to celebrate birthdays for my daughter and my husband. The food was great as was our waitress; she even reminded us that they got free deserts for their birthdays!
Misty D.,"Argyle, TX",38,273,186,5.0,10/16/2014,"This is a new location for BJ's.  Unlike lots of other BJs, they only have 3 TVs behind the bar playing games, but we didn't feel like we were missing anything.   The food was delicious, I think the pepperoni dip is only there for a limited time, which is sad, but hurry in to try it!  The servers were attentive and nice.  It's really easy to join their rewards program and earn free stuff, but they're not by any means pressuring anyone to do so like can be annoying at other places."
Jeromy J.,"Denton, TX",0,8,,5.0,10/9/2016,"At first it was a disaster, food came out cold and took 45 mins. Then the manager stepped in and apologized and said there was no excuse and he would handle it. He handled it very well and the rest of our experience was great."
