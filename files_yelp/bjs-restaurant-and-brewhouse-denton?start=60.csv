Clint W.,"Denton, TX",19,47,,3.0,6/18/2015,"I like that they make their own beer. It's not great, but it's not terrible either. Which pretty much sums up BJs in general.  They have an amazing app that makes curbside delivery easier than ever. You can also reserve a table (for a specific time) and pay the bill (using apple pay), all from the app."
Daniel W.,"Weyers Cave, VA",0,9,,1.0,6/29/2016,"This was my second try at a BJ's restaurant. My first experience was at a location near Fort Worth. That one had a cold, pretentious air about it with mediocre food and less than happy wait staff. It took me three years to try another location. I am in Denton often for work and usually struggle to find something different for mealtime. This location being new, I thought I'd give BJ's another try. Bad idea. Waiter was a fuzzy, less than enthusiastic guy who had the tone of ""I hate being here"" in his voice. When he finally plopped our drinks on the table he said ""I'll be back in a minute"" and walked off. He returned about five minutes later to ask if we had decided.... Um... While waiting for the food to arrive I noticed ALL wait staff was moving in half speed. I had plenty of time to notice that this place had the same cold pretentious atmosphere that I hated about the first BJ's I had been to. After several minutes the waiter returned to say he didn't know what was taking so long and the manager would offer us a salad or soup. I replied that I just wanted our order. Another several minutes later the waiter passed by and said the food was almost done. When I initially sat down, I checked and answered an email. That was at 12:08. At 12:45, still without lunch, we got up and left. For the manager of this location, if you feel the need to reply to this, understand that this experience has lost two customers permanently."
Kim B.,"Fort Walton Beach, FL",74,15,,4.0,9/19/2015,I absolutely love their arugula beet salad- it's what brings me back again and again. The Parmesan chicken is pretty yummy too .  The wait staff was kind and attentive. We did have trouble with a medium rare steak being well-done but it was replaced with apologies. Really try the salad. It's worth it!
Tony J.,"Flower Mound, TX",98,34,25,4.0,2/16/2016,"I really like BJ's the service and food are always very good and very consistent.  They have a huge menu.  They make really good pepparoni pizza and also a great selection of salads.  The blackened fish taco's are one of my favorite selections.  Great selection of craft beers as well.  If you go there for lunch, get there early they are always packed."
Doug P.,"Denton, TX",13,7,13,4.0,12/19/2014,Our Denton BJ'S is smaller and fantastic if you can get in.  Staff is always super great as is the food.  Love the place at lunch too
Ray A.,"Denton, TX",7,195,249,5.0,7/21/2015,The flat bread pizzas/calamari appetizer/ big size tv's/ awesome tasting Jeremiah Red. What else does one need. I can't wait for football season!!!
M Y.,"Garland, TX",1,6,,4.0,10/19/2014,"For a newly opened chain restaurant I will have to say our food and service was fantastic!! We are not usually chain restaurant people, it was a last minute bite before a late movie.  I will say my only critique was the servers menu knowledge. Not that she couldn't describe them all, just that she could not attest to the taste or quality. I will say they have a vast menu, however I would feel they would at least to a staff tasting of featured items....."
Krystal K.,"Denton, TX",25,8,,1.0,10/15/2015,"Poor service.  Mediocre food. Took our waitress 15 min to bring our drinks.  The glasses were empty more than full.   Husband and i ordered full rack of ribs to share with baked potato and salad.  I had to stop two other waiters before we even got salad dressing.  Baked potatoe was so old it had separated from the skin and was, so hard from being left in a heating lamp.  Our waitress never come back to the, table except to bring our check. We flagged down another waiter to take the potatoes back.  Ribs were ok....that was the only decent part of the experience. This was their their second chance we tried them n about 7 months ago and it was even worse.  Husband got sick from the fish. They are close to our house and with all the construction it would be nice  to have dinner without 2 hours in traffic. Hopefully better luck when bone daddys opens"
Thomas E.,"Denton, TX",28,16,,2.0,5/26/2016,"I've been here at least 10 times since they've opened, and I finally realized that I had no reason to go back. I have yet to find a dish on the menu that isn't remarkably bland. Sadly, the food is not half as bland as the service. I'm fairly certain that one of the requirements to serve at this restaurant is to have as little personality as possible. Even a rude server would be an appetizing breath of fresh air in this drab Bermuda triangle of sad service staff. The pizza is probably the best menu item even though it's about 80% crust, 20% toppings. This location doesn't offer the thin crust pizza option that the nearby Lewisville location offers so prepare to chew some bread. They do offer an extremely thin ""Tavern Cut"" pizza on which the ratios are a little bit better. I'd say this one's about 35% topping, 10% crust, and 55% I'm still hungry. All things considered, I just couldn't possibly recommend it."
Sharon P.,"Denton, TX",93,1,,1.0,3/20/2015,"I would have loved to try the food and beverages however we were never seated and left after waiting for 45 minutes; we watched people who arrived after us be seated before us.  The host staff states they sent me a text that I never received. The host staff never walked out to the seating area to call my name, either.  When I asked about seating I was told we would be the next table that was seated however another party was seated before us so my party left.  I feel that the host staff needs to be trained to ask for the party in a reasonable amount of time if the party does not show up after being texted.  I was very disappointed since I have not visited BJ's Brewhouse in several years and I was looking forward to dining there."
Herlinda G.,"Denton, TX",17,3,,5.0,2/23/2016,"Monique took great care of our order. The food was delicious as always. The BOGO coupon made it even better.  We always enjoy this welcoming place where the food is consistently delicious and the menu gives us plenty of choices.  It's not always easy to find a delicious bison burger, but BJ's delivers every time!"
Emily T.,"Denton, TX",1,5,,2.0,5/29/2015,"Low quality, yet high prices. My pasta and salad were good but my boyfriends on the other hand tasted like the rice you get in jail. Seriously not worth the prices"
Briauna B.,"South San Francisco, CA",71,3,,5.0,4/30/2016,"I have never had a bad experience at this location. I mostly sit in the cocktail area, and the servers were always helpful with honest opinions of the food. Everyone is friendly and food is good."
Stephanie H.,"The Colony, TX",36,461,57,5.0,1/10/2015,i like this place because the pizookies are really good. i like the chocolate chip pizookie. this place is reasonably priced and is great for groups.
Curtis H.,"Lewisville, TX",8,35,10,4.0,6/11/2015,"Good food. Fresh. It's easy to forget this restaurant because it's fairly new. Service is spotty. As I sit here waiting for my check to be corrected and tell my wife ""I wish wait staff could remember that I ordered my tea with lemon and that means refills would be nice to have a lemon too"" we'll come back."
Josh P.,"Lewisville, TX",134,26,4,5.0,3/18/2015,"I always love this place, and am excited this new location is open in Denton. We had the stuffed mushrooms, and deep dish BJ's favorite. Of course with a Jeremiah red, all topped off with a chocolate chip pizookie!  They are selling discounted movie tickets as well for the theater behind the restaurant. Food was good, and service was good! Thanks!"
John P.,"Denton, TX",0,4,1,2.0,6/30/2015,"I have always loved BJ's and did this one too until recently.  The food has taken a turn for the worst, the service is nonexistent, and have been out of a couple of my favorite beers more than once... that they brew mind you.  I ordered the fish and chips my last visit and it came out over fried with grease running out of it. I tried to power through it, but was just too nasty. The frys were all clumped and stuck together and over cooked and extra greasy.  It is obvious there has been a management change because the place is poorly run now.  I used to take my family of 5 there weekly, but the last several visits have been completely disappointing.  It's unfortunate because we really enjoyed this place.  The service? Well below average. I would contribute all these deficiencies to gross mismanagement because I know BJ'S is good.  Really disappointing."
Mark B.,"Denton, TX",0,3,,3.0,12/10/2014,"Our 1st time to this new location in denton our waiter was very good the food not so much, we both had chicken fried steak which was greasy, had too much black pepper and not enough gravy, mixed veg was uncooked. We will go back after they've been open for a while."
Alisa S.,"Denton, TX",46,31,31,3.0,2/14/2015,"Although I usually enjoy this place, I have to say that they are very proud of their wines, and we are not talking about ""fine"" wine either. A glass of Barefoot is $6, same price you can find this entire bottle at your local grocer. I do not recommend BJs as an idea for ""just a drink"". I give it 3 stars because their wine prices are insane."
Jim B.,"Dallas, TX",74,79,7,3.0,10/28/2014,"Normally I'm a big fan but tonight the food quality of my dish was not up to par. But since all the other times I've eaten here the food is always outstanding I'm definitely going to give them more chances.  The chicken for the balsamic glazed grilled chicken was very overcooked, dried out with a burned charcoal flavor. However I will say the calamari was absolutely fantastic and that's what kept my rating from being lower than 3 stars. There were 8 of us and the server did a very good job keeping our drinks refilled and being attentive to our needs separating our checks and getting our payment done quickly. The pizza looked outstanding I'm definitely going to give that a try next time."
