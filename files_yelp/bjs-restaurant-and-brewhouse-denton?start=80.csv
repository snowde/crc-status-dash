Amy S.,"Carrollton, TX",287,25,,3.0,10/1/2014,"Good food mediocre service. We got more attention from other servers and the manager than we did our own. Our entrees ended up coming out 15 minutes before our appetizers which was irksome but it was delicious nonetheless. Our server brought our check about 5 minutes after the food came out but we wanted dessert. You can't go to Bjs without getting a pazookie! So we ordered it through the manager because I'm pretty sure Alexandra (our server) wasn't gonna come back until we were ready to pay. Overall it would have been an almost perfect experience if only we had had a different, perhaps more experienced, server."
Jimmy J.,"Denton, TX",3,18,1,3.0,1/29/2015,"Food (2 stars): I was unimpressed. I haven't been to many BJ's to know if this place is serving the standard quality. The menu is quite large with a plethora of options. On this trip I was with the whole family and was able to sample a variety of the menu. First, they have a great beer selection. Tons on tap and more in bottles. Their house beers are around $5.50 a pint and roughly a $1 cheaper than any other draft. I tried the Brewhouse Blonde and Harvest Hefeweizen. Both were very good. For an appetizer we ordered the Carnitas Fries with Chile Verde. The whole table agreed the Chile Verde did not taste that great and really ruined the fries. Also the cheese seemed to be the first thing added to the bowl because it was all melted at the bottom and not on the fries. I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger; it was just ok. Red Robin and Chili's make better burgers and for the $10 price tag I expected more. The bacon and cheese were cut thin; I could see through the cheese to the burger. The lettuce was completely wilted. If they put mayonnaise and their ""signature burger sauce"" I could not tell as both buns were dry. My wife ordered the Chicken Fried Steak. The meat was very tender and tasty. The breading stayed together and did not fall off but had little flavor. The country gravy had a good consistency and flavor but they didn't serve enough on the steaks to have with every bite. The mash potatoes were dry which made the fact that they were served without gravy even more obvious. The boys had the Kid's burger and chicken strips. The boys all agreed that they were good. The lettuce for their burgers was served on the side, so it was nice and crisp; wish they would have done that for mine. Facilities (5 stars): Being new, this place is very clean. Walking in the dining room is laid out well with the bar area on the right and tables on the left. The bar itself is an artistic focal point with lighted shelves illuminating the well organized bottles of liquor. There are several TV's located through out the bar and restaurant; not to many to be in your face but just enough so you can watch from any seat. Booths are comfortable albeit a little tight. The bathroom is clean, but laid out rather odd and 1 of the 3 automatic faucets did not work. The parking setup is the only issue and it's minor. There is minimal parking in the front, so we had to park in the back and walk around. Service (4 stars): We had good, but not great, service. The restaurant was probably at 60% capacity. We wanted to sit in a booth and one was available but had to be bussed. It took about 5 minutes to have the table cleaned; not a long time at all but considering I didn't see them cleaning any other tables before ours made me question why it took so long. Our server was attentive and kept the boys' sodas refilled quickly (one of my major markers on quality of service, my glass better not be empty). Orders were brought promptly and issues (missing ranch) were resolved with speed. Value (2 stars): For a mid-week dinner out with the entire family, a couple beers, and an appetizer our bill after tip was around $70. This is on the high end of what we look to expend and for the quality of food not a good value. It would have been nice to have some happy hour specials. Overall (3 stars): I like the layout and look of this BJ's. The beer was nice and cold! I'll be back to sit in the bar and have a few drinks, but the family agreed we probably will not be back for a dinner."
Joe G.,"Argyle, TX",0,20,,1.0,4/12/2015,"The worst margaritas ever.  The skinny margarita was so sugary there's no way it had less calories than their regular.  Also, it has a funky flavor.  Orange maybe.  And the bartender kind of told me I must be stupid if I don't like it.  So that was fun also.   All of their margaritas use sweet and sour.  Not fresh limes.   I tried their traditional house margarita and their top shelf as well.  They were better than the skinny but, again, the sweet and sour mix over powered everything.   All of them were awful!!!!   We would have ordered food but left and went elsewhere.   This entire business seems formula based.  Whether mixed drinks or the food.  I really think it's more of a glorified beer joint.  No good."
Carlos m M.,"Denton, TX",9,10,,2.0,11/23/2015,"We have eaten at this BJ's several times and in general have had decent food and service. However, last week I ordered their Kale and Roasted Brussel Sprouts salad and discovered halfway through the salad that it didn't have any kale at all nor did it have any romaine and very few Brussel sprouts. Instead the salad was full of Arugula and I guess they thought I wouldn't know the difference. I mentioned it to the waitress and she did nothing about it. Normally I would have asked for the manager, but we were a party of six and I didn't want to embarrass our friends. The next day I wrote them an e-mail using the website and so far I have not had the courtesy of a reply or acknowledgement that they received it. Not good customer service, especially since we are a member of their loyalty program. Will not be back very often from now on."
Karson P.,"Denton, TX",121,5,,5.0,10/26/2014,Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. My group of friends and myself love going after we get off work and we always get super cool severs and awesome food. Love this place!
D M.,"Denton, TX",0,2,,1.0,10/25/2015,The waiters and staff was friendly so having said that lets get that crap out of the way and move on to what's important. I signed on to Yelp just because of this restaurant. the steak was horrible the baked potato was horrible and how can you mess that up I have no idea my wife got very sick because of the steak and potato. the steak tasted like it had been cooked on a 2x4 plank but yet it had burnt marks from a grill surface and completely burnt all the way across the bottom and had no juice whatsoever  completely dry . we think the potato must have been left out for hours because it was almost pink on the inside. I had a pumpkin pizookie that was pretty good but I bought a large chocolate chunk pizookie for my daughter and took it home and the cookie portion was cooked to a crisp. this is the second time we've been there and the second time we ask for a gluten free menu which is so small and printed out on regular paper you can't even see it not even the waitress could see this or read it. We pointed out the condition of the steak to the manager and he said quietly alright I'll let the Cook know never offered to fix the situation or replace the steak and we were still charged. I will never be going back nor anyone in my family and I would recommend that you not either.
Nate A.,"Denton, TX",8,11,,4.0,6/17/2015,"One of our favorite spots to go out for dinner. The menu is HUGE with more options than you could choose from at one sitting. Apps are good, entrees very good, and the desserts are the bomb diggity. A little on the pricey side but the quality is over all really good. Would recommend."
Caffeinated 2.,"Irving, TX",3,15,6,3.0,3/14/2015,"Arrived at 9pm on a Saturday night and had to wait fifteen minutes for a two top. Once escorted to the table,  noticed that there was still food residue on the table top.  We mentioned it to our hostess and she said you can ask the server to take care of it.  A little surprised. We ordered drinks and some water for the table.  My water arrived with something green floating in it.   Our server wasn't anywhere to be found so had to wait until she returned to take our order.  We placed our order - Cherry Chipotle Salmon and French dip steak sandwich.  We saw our server only when food was being served.   When the food arrived it look good.  The Salmon was very good but didn't have a lot of the chipotle sauce as they advertised.  All the couscous was lemon tasting as someone added a lot of lemon to the dish.  Overall it was good.  As for the French Dip, it looked appealing but aft r a fe bites we realized the sandwich was actually cold.  We couldn't find our waitress so my date continued to eat his sandwich being hungry.   After almost completing his dish, our server appeared.  We asked if the sandwich was supposed to be hot.  She said yes and got the manager.  We told him the same thing.   He said he would notify the kitchen and offered to make another sandwich.   Considering my date ate most of his we declined.  It was nice to see they remove his entree from the bill when we checked out."
Charles H.,"Denton, TX",38,9,5,2.0,2/7/2015,My second time at BJ's and I am still unimpressed.  The food is ok but not worth the cost.  Who puts parsley on pulled pork sandwich?  Trying to present the food better than it is?  I doubt I will be back.
Anne B.,"Denton, TX",5,8,,4.0,10/3/2014,"We went to this new location last Sunday.  Everything was great from the drinks to desserts.  The Peach Sangria was refreshing and actually packed a punch!   The pizza great and the Salted Caramel Pizookie was TO DIE FOR!!  We were all happy with our choices.  Service was friendly and efficient, atmosphere fun!  Welcome to Denton, BJ's!"
Gary S.,"The Colony, TX",0,9,,1.0,7/15/2015,"WORST. SERVICE. EVER.  Our party of six went in for lunch at about 1:45 on Tuesday 7/14/15.  They were not busy at all.  Yet, it took us about 15 minutes to get the 6 glasses of water we ordered.  About another 15 minutes to get our order placed.  I didn't time how long it then took to actually get our food (salads, sandwiches, & pasta dishes) but it must have been at least 50-55 minutes!  My wife had ordered an Asian Chopped Salad without the Won-Tons (gluten-free) and without the onions.  Her salad came with Won-Tons anyway, so it had to go back.  Another 15-20 minutes waiting for a replacement.  The replacement (3rd salad now) had no Won-Tons, but was loaded with onions!  Since everyone else had finished eating by now, she tried to eat it anyway, but gave up after 3-4 bites.  When our waitress finally appeared with the check, I complained about the salad.  The waitress was rather flippant about it, and said she would tell the manager.  About 10 minutes later, she reappeared with the check and said the inedible salad had been comp'ed.  No sign of the manager, no apologies, nothing!!!  So, we wasted about two hours getting a simple lunch that only 5 of our 6 guests could eat, and getting angry about to boot!  BTW, this was for a birthday ""celebration,"" which made it even worse! We will NEVER visit this BJ's again!  We had visited two others before, and they were great, but the one in Denton is awful!  AVOID THIS PLACE!!!"
