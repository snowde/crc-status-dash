James B.,"Miami, FL",150,163,335,4.0,1/7/2018,"I ordered the double bone in pork chop and it was absolutely delicious and the portion was very large. For $16 .75 it was a great value. Plenty of white fleshy protein. I was very impressed with the portion. It is slow roasted in a sweet rub and two sides. I ordered the cheddar mashed potatoes and the honey sriracha brussels sprouts which were also very good. Paired with their IPA, which was also very good.  Left pretty impressed with my meal."
Valentina J.,"Miami, FL",0,5,,3.0,1/5/2018,"This restaurant is beautiful. Super well decorated. The food was super good. Our server, John, was an absolute sweetheart. Making sure we were comfortable at all times and i will for a fact make sure I ask for john again next time. You're probably wondering why I put 3 stars. The hostess were the worst hostess i have ever met in my life. They completely ignored us when we walked in, we had to continually say ""excuse me"" for them to turn around and give us an awful attitude. Also,  the hostess who walked us to our table didn't even talk to us. Awful service when it came to the hostess. Sad."
Odanys V.,"Miami, FL",0,38,3,1.0,12/15/2017,"Been here twice before I posted this review and each time it has sucked. The first time we came it was busy, we had ordered an appetizer that never came and was part of the bill. Got a dirty wine glass that took forever to change- my partner ended up drinking all their wine before I even had a sip. Second time- went with a group and it was a slow weeknight, three entrees delayed due to the waiter's mistake. We were told that our food would be out in ""5 min tops"". It came out 25 min later when most of the group was ready to go, so we sent the food back. To add insult to injury, our bill which had the subtraction of the sent back food, had an addition of an entree no one had ordered- when asked the waiter told us ""oh the manager forgot to take that off""- but no one had remotely had anything similar to the item. Drink service slow, paying the bill is slow. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone, your paying for crappy service and your patience will run thin."
Michael B.,"Coconut Grove, Miami, FL",25,54,290,4.0,12/7/2017,"Some of the best brews in town are served here. Bj's makes their own beers ranging from light lagers to dark stouts with seasonal specials. Must try the Jeremiah Red. One of the best beers I've had ever and I find myself craving it randomly through the week. Located in the same lot as Miami International Mall.  Also you'll find and endless menu of American Style entrees covering their specialty Deep Dish-Style Pizzas, Pastas, Loaded Burgers, Salads, and a  health-conscious Menu as well. Gluten-free and a couple of Vegan options available as well. To top that off restuarant serves a unique dessert called a ""Pizookie"" which is a fresh baked cookie with vanilla or chocolate ice cream for anyone with a sweet tooth.  Casual dining experience with friendly servers, humongous TV located behind the colorful bar (cool location to watch sports games),great spot to cater just about any special event... lunch specials Galore and a Happy Hour you can't beat."
David L.,"Miami, FL",249,206,443,3.0,1/4/2018,"Came out here to BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse to celebrate with a group of friends that arrived in town to have pizza and brews.  The pizza was alright and nothing too special about it, we ordered the meat lovers and it does come loaded with a bunch of toppings which was awesome but the taste is just OK.  We also unfortunately had some trouble with our order, we actually went ahead and put in the order via their app and our orders got mixed up with another table.  The issue was handled by the staff in good manner and they actually hooked it up with an extra pizza on the house which was pretty cool.   Would I visit again? Not really, but let me say that they do have some awesome, delicious brews out here! My favorite is the award winning Jeremiah Red! An Irish red ale that is about 7% that goes down so smooth and can be paired perfectly with your meal.  I would say it's worth the trip to the brewhouse just to try this red ale out!"
Mark M.,"Niagara Falls, NY",136,1018,6165,4.0,9/26/2017,Went here tonight for dinner and there was only a few minutes of waiting for a booth. It's a big location and feels great inside as the decor is super modern.  We ordered salmon salad and a Cobb salad. Both were really fresh and tasted excellent. Unfortunately it took about 30 minutes to get the entrees to our table.  Waitress was very busy but did her best. She apologized later for the wait which I respected. The manager Bianca came over to also apologize and packaged the rest of our meals together.  I will certainly give this place another try and hope for quicker meals.
Cassandra T.,"Miami, FL",141,85,165,2.0,8/27/2017,"I've been to this place quite a few times, their menu has a great variety and their desert cookies are honestly i think one of my favorite desserts.  Last two times i went my experience was not pleasant.  Lunch- the server was completely missing. i mean what was supposed to be a 30 min lunch turned into an hour because we had no idea where the heck he kept going? we asked him for napkins and they never came so we asked some one else for napkins after waiting about 15 min and the napkins were right behind our booth? The food i ordered looked ABSOLUTELY NOTHING like it did on the menu, in the menu it was a quinoa bowl and the bowl was full, i got half my plate full and the food didn't even look appetizing in the least way. Given that i had been here a few times before i didn't think to write a review because i know they have done better and decided to let it slide.  But then we came again... We got there at about 11pm to have their dessert... we walk in and there was no hostess.. we were there for so long that a line started to form behind us ... eventually about 10-15 min later a lady comes out and starts seating people. We get sat and no one comes to greet us... we just started talking to ourselves and eventually the waitress showed up , we placed our order and we were left alone until we were done with our dessert, then came the game of trying to find the waitress to get the check. Something that should have been a maybe 30 min experience turned into over AN HOUR (not exaggerating because we looked at the time when we got there to make sure they were still open) so i guess my suggestion for this place is to do take out ? i tried lunch and dessert and i was unfortunately not impressed. i don't know what has changed because like i said we have gone previously and never had a bad experience."
Rafael B.,"Miami Beach, FL",22,71,122,4.0,11/9/2017,Had a great time here watching the Heat game. Enjoyed nice cold beer which is very important. Had the Brussel Sprouts as appetizer which was DELICIOUS & and the double cut pork chop with brown rice and black beans. Very satisfied customer. The waitress was super nice and every the bus boy (Jamel) was very attentive and nice. Definitely will return.  Reason i didn't give 5 stars was because the rice was a little over cooked (hard) as you can see in the photo. I still ate it bc i was hungry lol.
Lucia P.,"Miami, FL",29,103,52,3.0,9/14/2017,"I wish I tried the Pazookie (the monster cookie with ice cream) but I hadn't yet because I've been here only with my volleyball team. The place is nice, a little dark and the menu is pretty huge.  I tried the California chicken club which was very yummy and then I got the mahi mahi and shrimp which was horrible to me. It was over cooked and it came with a weird broth which is the sautéed for the shrimp that I did not like. The service was okay, I felt the waitress was either stressed, annoyed or it was just a bad day for her.  I'll definitely come back to try the dessert tho!"
Manny M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",5,86,238,4.0,6/4/2017,"Definitely a great place to meet up with friends and/or with family to celebrate any occasion or just for fun. Food was good, service was good and the environment is alive.  I've been to two separate BJs and this is my favorite place, because the service provided is better and the quality of the food is standard."
Gabriel T.,"Miami, FL",704,207,1000,4.0,3/23/2017,"I'm not going to talk about their great food, the amazing drinks, good services or nice location.  I want to mention the unbelievable APP where you can order ahead, select everything you want so its save you time when arrive. You can also earn points with the reward program and can pay with the APP too! I go here a few times per month because it's close and very convenient.  My only suggestion will be to improve the WiFi. But this isn't enough to take a star off."
Rolando G.,"Miami, FL",304,209,373,3.0,1/25/2017,"I came here for a group dinner and was let down within the first five minutes. While waiting for my party to arrive, I walked up to the bar to get a beer. I order a Yuengling and was asked for my ID. I show the bartender and she looks at it weird. She then asks for a second ID, I show her my credit card and another ID. She walks away for 5 minutes to speak to the manager - mind you, this is my real ID. She comes back after a while and finally says ""sorry for the trouble, my manager is really strict, you're fine now"". There was no courtesy from the manager for this very weird misshapen and that's an oversight.  As for my group dinner, I had a lovely pizza which was great, but my waters never came and I'm huge on having something to drink all of the time. I'm not impressed and hoped it had been a better experience from such a nice place..."
Nancy A.,"Miami, FL",656,393,280,3.0,11/16/2016,"Its a chain. and as every chain, you know what to expect. A-ok beers and drinks. Mediocre to A-OK service and excellent desserts.  Yes I'm a sucker for their cookie a la mode concoction.  I think the place is a bit dark, and it does work for big groups."
Arshba K.,"Miami, FL",4,8,11,4.0,8/24/2017,"BJ's is a basic chain restaurant that is always a safe option if you make spontaneous dinner plans with someone. The waiters at this branch have been nothing short of kind and knowledgable.  For appetizers I've ordered Avocado Egg Rolls and Mozzarella sticks. The Avocado egg rolls are something you don't want to miss out on. I think those were the best Avocado egg rolls I have ever eaten, the roll itself is very meaty and tastes amazing.  Recently, I have discovered my all time favorite entree to get at this restaurant. The crispy Jalapeño burger but instead of meat I substituted it with a salmon fillet. It was so delicious. Definitely recommend everyone who loves salmon to try that burger."
Grace S.,"Miami, FL",0,5,7,5.0,10/28/2017,"This was an unexpected surprise! My husband and I are here for a date night and can't be happier with both the food and service. We started out with a house salad each, I had The Bj's Atlantic Salmon with broccoli and rice pilaf! Absolutely amazing, so juicy and flavorful. I'm using a web pic cause I forgot to take a pic... my apologies. But I'm not exaggerating when I say it's one of the best salmon I've ever had! Our server, Jordan was excellent!! He's very attentive, knowledgeable and fast. Loved our whole experience... Thank you all!"
Michael O.,"Arlington, VA",1,16,36,4.0,7/29/2017,"After refining my rating process, I had to downgrade the review of BJ's to 4 stars.  They scored as follows: Cleanliness: 4/4 Service: 4/4 Honesty: 4/4 +0 Bonus stars I grant bonus stars to establishments that go above and beyond my 3 main categories to deliver outstanding food, beautiful presentations, or stellar service. Since BJs is a simple restaurant they did not provide outstanding food, artistic presentations, or stellar service. But, as YELP says for 4 stars, ""Yay! I'm a fan."""
Angelica G.,"Miami, FL",2,7,23,5.0,1/29/2017,"AMAZING HAPPY HOUR SPECIALS! I love this restaurant!  Whenever my family and I come in we always get awesome hospitality,  great service, and the food is amazing!  The hostess are extremely friendly and efficient, they usually are able to sit us right away.  Our server John was attentative and very helpful in assisting us with our dinner selection.  Luckily we came during happy hour. . They have AMAZING HAPPY HOUR specials!! Half off appetizers,  $2 domestic bottles,  $3 wines,  $4 call drinks and $1 off they're handcrafted beers!  We ordered a few shareable appetizer,  I definitely recommend the avocado rolls,  boneless wings and the crispy Flatbread nachos! So delicious!  As far as beer recommendations I definitely recommend trying the Blonde and Jermiah Red. This will definitely be my new drinking spot!  The atmosphere was fun and enjoyable."
Yany I.,"Miami, FL",0,29,8,5.0,11/9/2017,"Sat by the bar and Daniel took very good care of us.  The food was amazing and Daniel was on top of everything.  He was multitasking and taking care of all the customers in the bar.  After asking for his name, he mentioned it was his 2nd day on the job.  So far so good!"
Kendra A.,"Miami, FL",122,102,88,5.0,11/12/2016,"Here again for lunch with the parents. Awesome time. Nino treated us very well, she is a great server!"
Antonio R.,"Miami, FL",97,74,265,3.0,6/30/2017,"Solid Three Star Chain restaurant.  To start, the Avocado Egg Rolls were huge and a nice way to satisfy long term hunger. My New Orleans Jambalaya came with all the Cajun Spice hauled off to one side of the plate, making it not very spicy, but I was okay with it. My step-dad's Pork Chop was probably cooked at super high heat because the exterior was charred and the inside was white and dry. And it's not cool to hide Wasabi in the middle of my mom's Tuna Salad. The Trio Wookie for dessert was the best part of the night, but I got a really full-feeling after I devoured those. I guess that's me to blame.  It's a brewhouse. Come here for the beer first, food second."
Franky F.,"Miami, FL",2,38,51,5.0,10/14/2017,Great food and reasonable prices. BJ's pumpkin ale beer is delicious. Tastes exactly like pumpkin. Perfect for the season.
Daniella C.,"Miami, FL",40,88,331,4.0,10/27/2016,"I love BJs I've come already about 3 times. I went last night for dinner and drinks with my boyfriend and some friends. I ordered the California flat bread which was good and their lentil soup. Unfortunately, the avocado on my flat bread wasn't ripe, I couldn't even put my fork through it, so I mentioned it to my server and she brought me ripe avocado right away. My bf ordered the calamari and it was so undercooked he couldn't eat it, so my server had the manager take it off the bill. The waitress was Jennifer, she was really attentive and very nice. I liked her very much. Everyone else's food was great and I enjoyed our drinks as well. The only thing I could say is that I would've liked to have been visited by the manager. I will be coming back, as I have been for the past few months. Thanks :)"
Isamala G.,"Miami, FL",332,91,6,3.0,5/3/2017,This place is very pretty not going to lie. Service is 3 stars when I say they don't care what you order or if you have a special request they charge you like wtf. I order a flat bread with no dried tomatoes but to sub it for some avocado. I got charge 2 dollars for literally 5 pieces of avocado. Then the flat bread was burn to a crispy but cold as a rock. Also order a bake potato and it was so gross
Daniel P.,"Miami, FL",11,9,5,4.0,9/18/2017,"I came here a couple of weeks ago;Food was great and loved there vast variety of food. Sort of like Cheesecake Factory, but nothing compares to that. The service was great and no wait time. Nice spot for lunch if you're in the Doral area."
Tonia G.,"Pompano Beach, FL",57,32,15,2.0,3/22/2017,"I came at 11, just as they were opening. I went to the bar and ordered a salad to go. I was told it would be ten minutes. I waited 25 minutes to get a salad to go!!!  Why????"
Diana R.,"Miami, FL",18,15,6,3.0,9/15/2017,My 4th time here. Love the place but this time was too loud. The server we had was very nice but too slow. Too many tables for 1 person and she really tried hard to serve everyone accordingly . I always eat the Avocado egg rolls and today will be my last. Not good at all. But my broccoli cream soup was fantastic. Spent too much time in this place than I needed. Won't be coming again
Marissa J.,"Hollywood, FL",33,471,1430,4.0,5/11/2017,"We went her for lunch, we made the reservation online to make sure that food was ready before we arrived. The food does not get cook until we arrived, the guacamole mushroom were delicious. I order the salmon with vegetables, friends order burger, half ribs, chicken tacos, meatball lunch. The food was delicious, and our server was fast."
Angel M.,"Miami, FL",60,20,9,4.0,8/26/2017,Killer burgers and the wife loves the salads everything is fresh which is great. Happy hour has good deals come check it out
Glo S.,"Miami, FL",1,4,1,5.0,5/25/2017,We came here tonight to celebrate the birthday of our friend and I have to say this restaurant has the most attentive staff I have ever seen. Christian was our server and he went out of his way to make sure everything went well his service was quick and impeccable. The food is amazing and the manager also went out of his way to seat us in the best seat possible. We are having the best time thanks to the staff of this restaurant.
Tiffany D.,"Hialeah, FL",180,3,7,1.0,7/26/2017,They lost our debit card... I mean come on. How can you do that. And on top of that service was terrible. Horrible.
'Janet G.,"Miami, FL",27,13,8,4.0,8/23/2017,"The staff is always friendly, the prices are very reasonable, the food is good, and there is never a wait. I have no complaints!"
Adolfo R.,"Miami, FL",2,50,,2.0,2/18/2017,"I had never been to this place and went because I was given a BJ's Restaurant gift card for Christmas. Let me begin by saying that it took them a long time just to come ask us what we wanted to drink. To the point where I told my family that if no one came by 2:40 PM (it was 2:36 PM), we would leave. Two minutes later, someone (not our designated waitress) finally came over. I ordered a Shrimp & Asparagus Penne, and it had approximately 6 or 7 small shrimp. As for the flavor, it was OK. Nothing to write home about, as they say. The kid's spaghetti should be named the toddler's spaghetti. It was literally eaten in about 2 or 3 minutes, and not because it was delicious, but because there was so little of it. It's highly unlikely I'll return to this place. P.S. There was a LaCrosse game (perhaps the championship) on most of the TVs... I never knew LaCrosse was so popular."
Fiorella M.,"Miami, FL",170,82,129,4.0,6/5/2016,I came here spontaneously craving a burger and was surprisingly pleased. I ordered the bacon guacamole burger and it was delicious. I loved the chipotle sauce that they used and my favorite part were the crispy cries.  Our waiter was nice and accommodated us even When we wanted to sit in a bigger booth(it was just 2).  Overall i was pretty satisfied.
Murali K.,"Arlington, VA",1,181,,3.0,11/1/2017,"Decent brewpub, but nothing too impressive.  The menu is pretty extensive, so you could easily spend two months eating there every night and not eating the same thing twice.  The dessert menu looks pretty good, but I didn't try any of them.  Maybe next time."
JEREMY D.,"Kendall, FL",24,11,7,4.0,7/14/2017,Love the food choices....a lot of variety and good quality! Deep dish pizzas are my fave! Well put together drink menu and beer list (including their own beers as well as nice rotating craft selection) Service is good and attentive.
Heidi M.,"Miami, FL",164,114,404,4.0,6/11/2015,"I am a fan of this microbew chain. I have even hosted a birthday dinner or two (one with 30+) at this location. The salads and pizzas are really great crowd pleasers and the chicken marsala is super tasty!  As for the beers, the Jeremiah Red and Amber Ale are full-bodied and go with a variety of foods. The Hefeweizzen is fruity and has a delicate wheat flavor bringing up the rear. They also have a full bar and most major beer labels in bottles.  They also have a menu that can please just about everyone. Even their lighter options are full of flavor and always very satisfying. The mahi mahi is my favorite when I feel like I should save my calories for a pizookie (I'll get to that later). The fish is firm and served on a bed of sauteed rice and crisp vegetables. All of it is topped with a sweet and tangy sauce that provides the right balance of flavors.  On this occasion I ordered the spinach and artichoke dip and was not impressed. It was flavorless, cold in the middle, and made with so much cream cheese that our chips would break when trying to scoop some out, I would not order this appetizer again.  For my entree I got the Parmesan crusted chicken with mashed potatoes and broccoli. The chicken was topped with a lemon butter sauce, perfectly pan-fried, and juicy.  The kitchen is very fond of their cream cheese as I believe that a fair bit of it is in their mashed potatoes. They are a bit heavy, but this is how my mama makes them and so I really like it :)  The broccoli is only lightly steamed and seasoned. Definitely needs a dip in the lemon butter sauce for added flavor.  I tried the ahi tuna salad and thought that it had a perfect ratio of dressing to vegetable. The tuna was just seared and very fresh. Watch out for the little mounds of wasabi on the side of the plate, but otherwise a very refreshing and filling salad. For the piece de resistance we got a salted caramel pizookie. It looks like an over-sized easy bake oven cookie but it is full of hot gooey, buttery, nutty cookie. Topped with two scoops of vanilla ice cream, salted caramel sauce, and chocolate chips, the cookie was inhaled within minutes. Though this one is good, my favorite is still the peanut butter. However, I have had them all and there isn't a bad one in the bunch!  In all I had good service, tasty drink and food, all in a very nice location. I love BJs Brewhouse and will keep coming back for more!"
Timothy M.,"Miami, FL",0,1,,1.0,10/21/2017,The food is good but the service just plain sucks! I walked in and sat at the bar and the bartender nodded his head and placed a coaster on the counter. I guess speaking is not an acceptable form of communication. After a while he comes to take my order while I was on the phone speaking to somebody once again nods as if to ask me what I want. Maybe he's blind and can't see that I'm on the phone but whatever. I pointed the phone out to him and he rolled his eyes and walked away shaking his head. Overall one of the absolute worst experiences I've ever had with customer service. I don't know what his name was just that he was bald  and needs serious help on how to treat customers!
Kateleen L.,"Miami, FL",407,10,1,5.0,7/14/2017,I love this place! It was quite empty but the food was so good. I really like how the menu displays the calories for every single thing especially the alcoholic drinks. I think the tomato and mozzarella salad is a must side especially because it's quite large and unique!
Emm O.,"Miami, FL",100,55,16,5.0,4/2/2017,"Ive been going to BJ's for over 3 years now. Needless to say, ITS GREAT!!! Fast and friendly service, amazing food, and good beers. Im not much of a drinker, but the beer selection and quality is awesome. I keep comimg back for a reason!"
Silvana D.,"Miami, FL",0,1,,4.0,8/27/2016,"We came to Bjs to celebrate a friends birthday.  We were a large party, I thought it was great that they were able to accommodate us quickly.  We started with drinks and appetizers. Our server Christina E. was very helpful and attentive. I wanted a beer and so Christina recommended Jeremiah Red, great choice! I had the California Chicken club, it was amazing! Really loved it.  Overall, I had a great experience. I was pleased by the food and service. I would most definitely go back to have another Jeremiah red. Thanks again Christina!"
