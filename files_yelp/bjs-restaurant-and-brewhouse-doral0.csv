Brent C.,"Miami Beach, FL",0,9,,1.0,11/14/2014,"Typically a great place to eat with this time being the exception.  From drinks to meals this was a subpar experience.  To start my glass had a chip in it which cut my mouth, and the waiter Javier went missing for a majority of the night. Manager only seemed interested in getting me to fill out an incident report and didn't come back after the report was filled out. My bun was hard and cold as we're my fries, the sandwich and fries next to me were the same. Waiter asked if we wanted dessert we said we would think about it bc we wanted another drink so he took that as bring them the bill. Bad service bad product Def won't be back."

Jason G.,"Miami, FL",12,17,1,1.0,3/23/2015,"This place is an over priced Chilli's, the food isn't anything special. The beer sucks!  Horrible management, all the employees were great but the managers are real jerks."
Victor G.,"Miami, FL",61,10,,3.0,5/7/2015,"Had the deep dish pizza, wasn't bad but not great either. Wife's pulled pork was average as well. Like the beer selections and big menu but haven't found anything great in my 3-4 visits."
Mariel N.,"Miami, FL",47,5,16,1.0,2/12/2014,"Went here the other day with a group of friend and had to wait over two hours because they forgot out reservation.  Service was ok, food took a ridiculous amount of time to get to us"
Ashley C.,"Miami, FL",49,17,7,5.0,4/28/2015,"Love the food here, especially the pazookie! Family friendly. And a huge selection of dishes to choose from."
Dan M.,"Miami, FL",38,122,2,1.0,3/4/2013,"It was run of the mill food and, well the service was crappy 2x! We arrived and got seated right away. We were sat down next to a large group 35+ and I knew they were going to forget about us. Well they did. No worries after about 15mins of good convo with the wife, I got up and looked for the manager. I mentioned to him my concern and he said go back to your table and I will send someone over. Well 10mins went by and no one showed up. He finally decided to pick up the slack and take our order (which he should have done from the beginning). The food was just alright. If anything the avocado rolls are worth TAKE OUT!.  Never going back check out the review for The Falls location."
Cristina G.,"Miami, FL",9,33,10,1.0,9/27/2014,"I must say that when I first tried this place I loved it!!!! But the last time I went it was so different. The appetizer took forever, the food came out cold and took a long time to begin with. My boyfriend got a salad and it was full of water mixed with dressing, gross!! He had to send it back and didn't eat at all. The only good part of this was how nice the waiter was in trying to make our experience more pleasurable. I'm so disappointed because this was my favorite place but now I'm afraid to go back. :("
Evelyn C.,"Hialeah, FL",10,7,,1.0,6/7/2015,"Horrible, lousy. We had a party of 5 ..1 Chicken Salad, 1 small great white deep alfredo sauce dish pizza without tomato sauce or tomatoes 2 burgers (1) plain, 1 noodle alfredo.  It took them 45 minutes to bring the pizza and chicken salad. The pizza had tomato sauce had to be sent back. The rest of the food took 25 minutes longer. When it finally did arrive the burgers were hockey pucks (we asked for medium rare). They were sent back. Didn't want anything else. Then they charged $15 for a small pan pizza which the menu said $10.95. And we were charged $15.95.  When I called them back I was told they changed the prices 2 weeks ago and haven't changed the prices on the menu's. Our opinion is DO NOT EAT THERE, the waitress was very nice, but the food is HORRIBLE."
Walid S.,"Newport Beach, CA",8,40,23,3.0,3/8/2015,Thine restaurant is like you go to Denny's the are ok but the drinks not at all. I did order a Mojito and the have nothing of alcohol is like you drinking a limonate. The service are good.
Jacki F.,"Maryville, TN",30,7,,3.0,7/7/2013,"Like most of the other reviews I have to say that the food is great!  The kids meals are a great deal.   However like most of the other reviews I have to say the service sucks!  The first time I came to this location it was fantastic...great food and service.  The second time service was slow, food came out wrong..manager was less then helpful.  The third time waiter was better but still not great. Overall I will be back just on days I have an overabundance of patience :)"
Liz R.,"Miami, FL",0,10,11,4.0,2/25/2015,"I love coming here there food is good i love the California burger, & one of their chicken pizza!"
david t.,"Miami, FL",4,23,,1.0,11/20/2014,Waited twenty minutes a for Splenda .. Ice tea is sour .. Didn't bring soup and took forever for lunch .. Food mediocre.
Bill T.,"Lake Mary, FL",30,10,,2.0,3/25/2015,"Service was slow, got there at 5 pm, ordered a side salad and was shocked it was so small. Ordered the thyme chicken, both came 15-20 minutes after ordering, thought I should have had a few minutes to enjoy the very small salad, but really not the issue. Chicken was not very flavorful, but rice mixture was tasty. Main dish was more than appropriately sized. Not a horrible dinner, but nothing I would come back to..."
Katherine R.,"Miami, FL",0,10,1,1.0,6/1/2013,"Hostess was rude. My food was cold. Waiter got two orders wrong. I spoke to one manager and he didn't do much, then a lady came to our table, maybe a manager, but didn't say anything about the situation. Waiter got the bill wrong.  Overall I don't think I'll be coming back."
Victor A.,"Miami, FL",20,10,1,2.0,12/8/2013,"The place is good for thier craft beers, happy hours, and ice cream cookie desserts. I came here for dinner on a Sunday night. Called ahead to ensure no wait. Got there and they never wrote my name, but there was no wait, so they saved themselves. Started off with small bites: spinach stuffed mushrooms, mozzarella and tomato salad, and the fried corn fritters. The appetizers were very mediocre and lacked much flavor. For the entree I had the grilled mahi mahi fish tacos with fries. The plate came out room temperature and had them reheat it. The service was slow and the place was not that full. Overall, I wouldn't recommend it unless you wanted to drink and didn't care about the food quality."
Karolyn M.,"Miami, FL",37,28,186,5.0,10/24/2012,My new favorite spot for a comfy atmosphere close to my home with delicious pizza and crafted beers. Been here twice in one week. It just opened Monday so the food takes a bit of time but the servers are great. Will be back for sure.
Angela G.,"Miami, FL",13,34,751,5.0,6/3/2013,Very nice place from Chicago! Had the jambalaya and was delicioso! The deep pan pizza too. Very generous portions and great service by Katherine :)
Matthew O.,"Bryce, UT",30,265,11,3.0,10/27/2012,"We decided to give BJ's a try after reading a couple Yelp! reviews from some of the other locations.  We went to this location early Saturday afternoon.  The servers and hostess were very nice and professional acting.  They seated next to a large group in an otherwise empty restaurant.  The hostess seemed a little surprised when my wife asked to sit elsewhere.  A few minutes later she seated a family with screaming kids near us.  I hate that.  Oh well, on to the food.   If Pizza Hut, The Cheesecake Factory and Gordon Biersch had a baby together, it would be BJ's. We ordered the avocado eggroll thing and was very happy with it.  My wife ordered some sort of fish tacos and seemed pleased with her choice.  I ordered a deep dish pizza and was fairly happy with it. Although, it tasted exactly like a pizza from Pizza Hut.  Good thing I like Pizza Hut.   Aside from having to listen to someones screaming kids, I enjoyed BJ's.  But, I'm not sure I'll be back any time soon."
Armando L.,"Cape Coral, FL",46,173,197,3.0,5/2/2013,"Food was good for a chain style brewery restaurant. Service could have been much better, but sadly, typical for Miami customer service."
