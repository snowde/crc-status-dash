Lourdes E.,"Bedford, MA",2,43,21,3.0,6/23/2016,Better than the first time I went. The waitress was trying her best but the appetizers and food came out all in different orders. My son was done with his meal before the rest of us got our meals. And the ketchup came once he was done. The Caesar salad looked like the lettuce had been sitting out for a while. The flat bread pizzas and the clam chowder soup was very good.
Jashira M.,"Miami, FL",29,87,202,3.0,8/14/2015,"It's a very nice restaurant. It has a big revolving door for you to go through as well as handicapped accessible doors. It was a short wait and we were seated. The booths offer outlets for you to charge your phone which is cool. They have many different beers for you to chose from if you drink. They also have a bar of course. The menu offers a variety of options for appetizers, meals, and dessert. The men ordered the steak and enjoyed it very much. However there were no utensils brought to our table for the salad before the meal or for the meal itself. We had to request them. I ordered the chicken Alfredo pasta. It was good but the broccoli was very undercooked. It was almost raw. The dessert we chose was the pizooki (I think it's called). Right before the dessert came we were notified there was no vanilla ice cream. It was still good with chocolate ice cream though."
Jen S.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,37,25,5.0,4/11/2016,"When you find yourself on a business trip and just trying to get a quick meal BJs is a great choice. I came with my colleague and we were literally starving. Michael, our server, brought us a few garlic knots to tide us over.  Honestly food was ok not amazing but Michael's service made me want to keep coming back.  I work in a customer centric environment and would be lucky to have someone like him on my team!!"
Cynthia H.,"Miami, FL",15,3,,2.0,6/20/2015,"I just came here with a couple of friends and sat at the bar. The bartender was much more focused on two girls, giving away free shooters. He hardly interacted with us, so it felt like his only mission was to impress the girls with his ""skills"". He also gave the two gentlemen sitting next to us free shots as well.  Honestly, if this was done at my job, the bar manager would see this as unacceptable and also point out the lack of integrity.  If you're going to give the bar away, make it less obvious. It shows a lack of professionalism.  I was very unimpressed with my visit and may think twice about recommending this place to people."
Rich G.,"Beverly Hills, FL",0,5,1,3.0,1/23/2017,"Sat at the bar and watched NFL playoff game. Service was dead on, glass was never empty. Food was good. About what you would expect from a chain. Price was ok. Would recommend. Typical chain but good."
Miami G.,"Miami, FL",3,83,,5.0,11/27/2016,"Visited BJ's for a family dinner and loved it!  The hostess was very nice and personable, our waiter Emiliano was EXCELLENT and attentive to our table at all times, he knew the menu very well and made great suggestions.  We started with drinks - mojito, strawberry mojito (a must), the top shelf margarita (another must) were all good.  Could have been better if they all had less ice, but we are not complaining.  The california club flat bread and boneless chicken wings were both good appetizers and they are good for 3 people to share (we were 4 and it worked out fine).  The golden beet and arugula salad was very good and perfect side portion.  Now to the big entrees- ribs were excellent served with mashed potatoes and asparagus, the spaghetti and meatballs was also very good (big portion) and so was the ahi tuna salad.  I recommend any of these dishes, all were great!  To end the meal we ordered a peanut butter smores pizookie!  If you love peanut butter, chocolate and marshmallows then do not pass up on ordering this dessert.  Served with vanilla ice cream on top and good to share up to 4 people (word of caution, it's a sugar overload!).  Truly enjoyed the place, service, food and ambiance and I highly recommend it and it's inexpensive to boot!"
Adriana B.,"Miami, FL",0,12,,2.0,1/10/2017,"The first time i ever tried Bj's Restaurant & Brewhouse was in Orlando. To say the least, I fell in love. Their food and drinks are soooo tasty. My husband and I realized there was one in Doral and immediately headed over there for some dinner. We have been to this location twice and it is nothing like the location in Orlando.  The first time we went, i ordered a soup, and my husband ordered a burger.. it came out raw! That time, our server was very accommodating and helped us save money for our experience.  We recently went again and although the food was fine this time (my bread bowl soup barely had any soup, but whatever) the service was terrible! We were having to look around for our waiter whenever we needed something and even had to shout out for him sometimes. When he would come to our table he always seemed in a hurry and not attentative to what we needed at all.  Didn't ask us if we were ready to order, ever. We had to tell him we were ready and it almost caught him by surprise.  The food also took a while to get there as well. I probably won't eat at this chain anymore unless it's in Orlando. Shame because i love their soup :("
Murielle D.,"Miami, FL",17,40,48,5.0,7/26/2015,"BJs has a wide selection of meal items. They have the lighter fare, burgers, wings, pastas and sandwiches. The food has consistently been good here. The last time I went there, the burger was a tad overcooked and I was disappointed, but the waiter gave us free dessert! They have great beer which is another great aspect to this place, it is a brew house and my favorite beers are their stouts and porters. The nutty brewnette is also great. I highly recommend this place!"
Claudia V.,"Miami, FL",0,2,4,5.0,7/1/2016,"Excellent customers services, the food and services are both very good. General manager front international mall very kind and helpful ."
Kate V.,"Miami, FL",58,22,28,5.0,3/12/2016,"Great food, good beer, drinks are reasonable and worth just the right amount of alcohol.  The variety of food is amazing,  something for everyone.  I have had the California club with the tortilla soup and fries and it was amazing.  The risotto with the salmon and asparagus is delish  add well. Don't leave without trying their desserts!"
Yolymar I.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,4,4,5.0,11/1/2015,Love this place! Came here for the first time last night and had to return today!!! Yesterday had the deep dish pizza and today the rib-eye and the spaghetti and meatballs. Also again amazing service by Diana!! We loved the food!! Will probably be back tomorrow.
Adriana M.,"Miami, FL",145,49,226,3.0,6/15/2015,We came to BJ's because we were in the area and wanted to grab a quick lunch. The service wasn't the best but the food was ok. If you like deep dish pizza they have a few good different selections. I like spicy so I went with their new Spicy Hawaiian Chicken pizza. Their crust was really good. My boyfriend went with the BBQ pulled pork and French fries which he said was ok.
Sonia C.,"Miami, FL",14,92,257,3.0,3/26/2015,"Good food, service, atmosphere.  Great place to eat with family or hang out at the bar during happy hour with ur friends. Love coming here!"
Omar P.,"Doral, FL",0,4,,2.0,11/26/2016,"The patio is rarely available, either due to lack of wait staff or ""not being ready"" host did not make the smallest attempt to prepare a table, ended up going to another restaurant with a very pleasant patio, will not return to bjs.."
Carlos R.,"Miami, FL",64,91,58,2.0,6/7/2015,Not impressed at all.  Pros -our waiter was polite and quick -the place was kinda packed but we were able to be seated right away -prices are not bad -pretty good selection of beer Cons -it was too dark to even read the menu easily -we ordered a deep dish pizza... I did not find anything special in it. It tasted like a 10$ pizza not a 23$ pizza. -It was a little to loud -there is nothing special about this place. Overall I was not impressed w this place and I doubt I'll be coming back.
Jorge M.,"Miami, FL",1,14,23,5.0,2/14/2015,"What a great place, my wife an I Love coming back and will keep coming back in the future. The blonde brew is awsome! !!!"
Jenessy A.,"Miami, FL",129,233,716,5.0,12/27/2013,"Not only is happy hour amazingly great here but they also have late night happy hour for the night owls. Half of wine on Tuesdays which is my favorito! This specific locations has the best bartenders too. Engaging and entertaining.  Things on the menu:  Flat breads are all really good especially the spinach one. Stuffed mushrooms are a must try. The mac n cheese is delish. I had the jalapeno burger the first time and it was amazeballs, not so much the 2nd time at this location. Overcooked and distasteful.  Egg rolls are perfect, with a pinch of spice.  The bar is quite complimenting, they have an extensive bar selection that includes lots of picks I don't usually see in other bars.  One thing I do love about this place is that on every occasion that I have been here I have never had to wait to be seated. It is never overly packed. Maybe because these places are crazy big."
Leslye L.,"Miami, FL",258,140,343,5.0,4/17/2015,Everything about this restaurant is great! From the customer service down to the food. I recommend everyone try's the Avocado Egg Roll appetizer.. You'll thank me later! In advance you're welcome :)
Laura E.,"Miami, FL",8,34,14,5.0,1/15/2016,"I enjoy my visits to BJs and it's been a regular place for my husband and I because of the food and happy hour. The guacamole burger, honey siracha Brussels sprouts, and pizookies are just a few notables. Pretty much all the appetizers are great, especially when half off at happy hour. We will continue to come here for the beer events, food and service as BJ card members."
Rebecca R.,"Miami, FL",223,105,257,3.0,2/26/2016,"While many of the people I went to school with work here and it makes me feel bad to poorly review their establishment, this restaurant is not at all what it could be. They have the possibilities to dish out great food, customer service and drinks, however, they don't push to reach their potential. I went with my boyfriend for our lunch break and while we were happy to get in and out in an hour, the service was rather mediocre and the food was as well. We started off with the guac and chips which were good, the guac is definitely fresh and chips are chips - can't complain there. However, the guac has pretty big pieces of jalapeños, which was an unpleasant surprise for me, so beware! For our entree, we ordered the Mahi Tacos, which are really good! We also ordered the Fettucini with Chicken and Broccolli. Avoid it. The alfredo sauce is tasteless, the chicken is bland and the pasta was too tough. Not at all recommended. Considering it was lunch hour and they were fairly empty, our server was less than attentive. We even had to ask another server for our bill after waiting for 15 minutes (which you don't want to do when you're taking a 1HR lunch break from work.) All in all, this place has good potentional and I wish the staff would realize that and step up to the plate."
