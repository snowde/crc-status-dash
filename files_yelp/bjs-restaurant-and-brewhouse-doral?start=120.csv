danielle h.,"Miami Beach, FL",2,15,,1.0,4/13/2016,Extremely rude servers Anna and Stephanie. Very disappointed in choosing to come here tonight. Only giving one star bc we have to.
CJ R.,"Miami, FL",64,71,125,4.0,5/10/2015,"After many disappointing experiences we finally got a good experience!!. Well good takes forever and it seems like that is the norm, service was very good. Our waiter was nice and very polite! I had the soup in the sourdough bread and as always was very good, this time I did the combo with the wedge salad which honestly was a bit disappointing but I guess that's their way so who am I to comment about how simple it looked. I am glad we finally had a good experience at this restaurant!!!!"
Lety A.,"Orlando, FL",1,16,52,5.0,1/30/2016,Went here for lunch today and I ordered the mini cheese pizza. Of course they screwed up my order and brought me chicken cheese pizza. I asked them to change it to what I had ordered. I must say I didn't make a complain or anything. I'm assuming the manager saw me eating my bfs food because I was starving came to our table to apologize and didn't charge me for the pizza... Which was very nice since I didn't make a complain or anything.
Andy D.,"Key Biscayne, FL",1,55,4,1.0,10/30/2016,"If you like BJ pizza in Orlando, don't come here.  It will ruin the experience for you.  The service is slow.  On a Sunday afternoon around 2pm, took 50 minutes for us to get our food.  We had ordered an appetizer, but the waiter forgot about it entirely.  The BJ standard of no notes by waiters doesn't work well here at all.  The kids pasta is awful.  The pizzas are ok, but not up to the BJ normal standard.  This restaurant seems to have problems with its drink lines, they often taste weird."
Mike Y.,"Miami, FL",79,94,65,5.0,2/26/2016,"I went to this location for the first time today with coworkers. We were served today by one of the best servers I have had in a long time. I don't know where they found Diana, but this is a dynamic server. She is attentive, friendly engaging and knows the menu. Without Diana, I would still have had a great lunch, but because of her.. I had an amazing lunch."
Tracy A.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",91,364,231,3.0,3/12/2014,"Went here with my coworkers for a team lunch. New place. They can seat a lot of people. Didn't have a beer since it was a business lunch.  I had the luncheon size chicken salad. It was a good size and it was pretty tasty. My coworker had the scallops and said the lime sauce was really good.  Service was spotty. She was pretty attentive but I won't vouch for her knowledge of food. When asked if she had cracked black pepper for the cesear salad, she replied ""No, but we have crushed red pepper"" Ummm...no thank you."
Anna K.,"Miami, FL",29,29,1,2.0,11/27/2016,"Came here as we had heard good things about it. We knew it was a chain but the menu seemed decent. The service however was another thing. It took over 10 mins for anyone to even come by to take our drink order. The sever seemed distracted and kind of uninterested. We ordered our meal and he didn't deliver it, he passed by briefly so we were able to ask for condiments but he didn't come by until we were basically done. We were out of drinks by the time he did and then had to wait for him to find water. The food seemed decent, we got wings but the service was a let down. When we left there were at least 5 people at the hostess station and not one said goodbye or thanks for coming. Not sure we would come back"
James M.,"Miami, FL",2,22,24,4.0,8/2/2015,"Go after 10 PM and enjoy drinks and appetizers 1/2 price.  They close the kitchen sometimes before 12 do make sure you get you order in. The ahi poke tuna is wonderful. They have really good burgers, they are huge. The wait staff and service is hit or miss. But its cool to go in a group and hang out"
Damarys H.,"Miami, FL",145,22,57,5.0,12/17/2013,"I am surprised by the poor rating this restaurant has received on Yelp. I visited last night for the first time, and I have to say that it was a great experience! I was very impressed with the design inside and out. My rating is based on the fact that we sat by the bar (which is very large and has great waiting service), their large selection of craft beers, their cleanliness, and their happy hour specials (half priced appetizers and discounted drinks). All of those aspects were excellent. I had a great time watching The Heat/Jazz game and later the Ravens/Lions game... no need to look around for which TV is playing your game, squint to read the score, or sit uncomfortably like you sometimes have to do at Flanagan's or the Ale House. So, the bar (area) experience... excellent. All those three star reviews seem to be exclusive to the general dining area and I can't speak for that. Its well worth the visit."
Marian P.,"Miami, FL",88,86,107,3.0,3/26/2015,"Lots of variety on their menu! But do not come here if you're trying to eat healthy! Their ""light"" menu is all ""UNDER 795 CALS""  DO come here to indulge :) Their stuffed mushrooms are a MUST! Oh, and their pizookies (cookie + ice cream) are AMAZING! They also brew their own beers and have delicious drinks! Customer service is good and you can earn points with your visits, which turns into prizes :) (free dessert, etc)"
Yoyi V.,"Hialeah, FL",0,16,9,1.0,4/15/2016,"Went to this location for dinner. Awful service. We ordered I appetizer, 2 entrees, 2 drinks. We got the entrees before the appetizer which arrived 20 minutes later. The waiter didn't bother to offer an excuse about the issue, never passed by to ask how was the service/food, never inquired if we needed anything else, never refilled glasses of water. Worse service ever. Restaurant employees take for granted tips and don't care about providing quality service. Neither will I return to this place nor I will recommend anyone"
Tony B.,"Miami, FL",311,11,4,4.0,11/30/2015,"BJ's might be a chain but I have to say the food and service is always on point. My girlfriend and I go to BJ's quite frequently and can honestly say we have only had slow/bad service one time and it really wasn't our servers fault as they were short staffed and he was waiting on what seemed like half the tables in the restaurant. Now comes the food, they constantly update and add interesting and new dishes to the menu. I highly recommend Sriracha Brussels Sprouts! Probably one of my favorite appetizers that they have. They just added Root Beer Glazed Wings which were pretty damn good! They have some healthy entrees on the menu which are really good but last night I had the Rib-Eye and was pleasantly surprised. I normally get the Fire-Roasted Barbacoa Chicken from the healthy portion of the menu and it one of my go to favorites. They have an outstanding beer selection."
Lorena O.,"Miami, FL",29,9,17,5.0,12/16/2014,Showed up with a party of 10.  The service was great as was the food.  They initially didn't have the beer that we wanted but they brought out samples of all similar options to accommodate our request.   They ended up getting the beer of choice.  I loved the lunch specials.  Affordable and decent size for your money!  I love their grilled chicken stuffed baked potato tgat comes with steamed broccoli and cheddar cheese with a side of Alfredo sauce.  I got that with a wedge salad no blue cheese crumbles or dressing but got ranch instead. Their desserts....Amazing!  Musy try if you haven't and if you are in the area for Happy Hour you should stop by.
Saad A.,"Hialeah, FL",1,12,6,5.0,4/24/2016,"We walked in and were seated right away. Our waiter was awesome, he suggestions were very accurate. Even hooked us up with two drink for the price of one. Loved it, would definitely go back."
Elizabeth Y.,"Key Biscayne, FL",55,29,24,3.0,2/6/2016,"Solid HH and a great value if you're in the area. Drinks were very good...pleasantly surprised! They have an extensive selection of brews here. The service was also very, very good. Our waiter was very attentive and they even brought us complimentary shots at the end of the meal. Food is good for a chain restaurant. Tuna Tartare was lacking flavor, but the fish was very fresh. The Sriracha cheese dip was addictive. My son loves their mac and cheese. Would definitely return if I'm nearby for HH....they have great specials!"
Glenda C.,"Miami, FL",161,182,473,3.0,5/13/2013,"Atmosphere is noisy, especially if you are here in the weekend.. That doesn't bother me and I expected it, but just to mention it's not a place for a quiet dinner.   Now to the food, pizza tastes like Pizza Hut but with no tomato sauce...Which is fine, I guess. I like Pizza Hut... however it definitely is not the deep dish pizza I was expecting and I did miss the tomato sauce. It should be called pan pizza. I also had the chicken wings with the sauces on the side. They were ok. Typical chain restaurant boneless wings, nothing out of this world.  I was annoyed that there was no soap in the restaurant (of course I let them know). I wondered how do the employees wash their hands? and felt very grossed out by this.  I guess BJs is another option for a chain restaurant. The menu is extensive and it has a lot of different items depending on what you are in the mood for. I would probably visit again to try some other menu items."
Melvin M.,"Miami, FL",0,23,3,4.0,3/12/2015,"Pretty solid spot. Has a wide range of food and cool place to just eat and relax with friends.  Service wasn't exceptional, but not too bad.  Take-out is also available which is pretty quick (max 15min)"
Michelle H.,"Miami, FL",59,55,88,4.0,2/14/2015,"Yes! Yes! This place is good. Not only do they have a varieties of beer and drinks, they also have the BEST Avocado Egg rolls ever! The servers are always pleasant.  I wouldn't call myself a regular but definitely go often. Those who have never been should already be on their way there."
Megan K.,"Farmington, MI",0,383,,4.0,12/6/2013,"I flew in from Detroit and earlier in the day, I saw this place while going to the International Mall. I had settled on dinner at a tapas restaurant. I drove there and was told it was closed so I didn't want a lot of hassle, so I just went back here since I knew where it was.  Overall, I was really impressed. The hostess wasn't particularly friendly when I asked where the bar was but the bartender who was crazy busy, was really attentive. I ordered a glass of wine and the Parmesan chicken. Everything came promptly and the chicken was very juicy and perfectly fried. It came in a cream sauce with basil and sun dried tomatoes. The potatoes it came with were also delicious.  I'm not from the area so I can't say I'll personally be back but I think it's a good place for weary travelers to go grab a quite bite and a drink for a reasonable price."
Jacky G.,"Miami, FL",85,140,454,3.0,5/20/2013,"Came here for a work function and I didn't find anything worth coming back for except the dessert. They call it pizookie. Its a dreamy, just baked, soft, guey, cookie with ice cream on top. The cookie is not served the usual way. Instead, it's actually baked & served in an individual cast iron mini pan right out of the oven. They have a ton of different cookie flavors too! The place had a good vibe, it was clean, and very big but the service was awful. Again, just go for dessert or for beer, I guess, since it's a ""brewery""."
