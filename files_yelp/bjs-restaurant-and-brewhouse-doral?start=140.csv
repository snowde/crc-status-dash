Raquel G.,"Miami, FL",0,9,,4.0,10/9/2016,"I've never had any problems with bad or rude service here! Depending on the time of day, it may take a while to get seated and served but they always are apologetic and nice if they know the service is slow. Our server recommended a great beer to us and even brought the sample to see if we liked it. The food is great, diverse american fare and I haven't been disappointed in anything I've ordered yet! We always get the pizookie trio, if you aren't a big fan of loud spaces then this might not be for you but we always love coming to BJ's to dinner and a movie."
Ellena L.,"Miami, FL",11,90,8,4.0,12/27/2015,"Was hesitant to come to this place after I was told by someone that it wasn't great, but I decided to give it a try, and thankfully I was pleasenlty surprised. I have been back twice in the last two weeks and the service has been good consistently The Santa fe eggs rolls are are delicious. I ordered the chicken parm the first time which came with white cheedar mash potatoes, and the second time I had the fried chicken. Both entrées were declious. They have a great drink called the Pink Cadillac. Looking forward to coming back soon."
Ratchel D.,"Miami, FL",340,419,737,1.0,2/18/2013,"I visited the restaurant a week ago with 5 of my friends.  -Waiter was nice, but not knowledgeable (he also did not check on us often for refills/food arrival/etc) what i mean by nice is that he wasn't rude.  -It was a Sunday night and it was pretty active. Service was EXTREMELY slow. -My husband order a salad which arrived to the table 20 mins after  the other meals (yes, salad took longer than steak). -My friend requested A1 sauce, took about 10 minutes to get it, once it arrived, food was already cold.  I spoke to the manager and while apologetic, he didn't really asked me what I though would be a good solution, instead he began ""comping"" things for my friends (for my husbands inconvenience).  My husband and I had separated our checks from the rest of the table so it really was not helpful for him to solve our issue by discounting things from the overall bill. I had to walk the manager through the reason why him comping my friend's appetizer was not going to help. At the end my husband and I were relieved from paying for our meals (his salad was packed to go) and I was not charged for my sandwich ($12 value).   -We ordered dessert and it took about 25 minutes for it to be served (the discussion with the manager about poor service had passed, you would think they would step it up but no).  Once the bill came, it had not been separated as requested at the beginning of the evening. I had to review the bill and there were two items that did not belong and a third item which we were charged for but was never  brought out.  The food it self was tasty and the local has potential...service needs a revamp, ASAP!"
Nelson R.,"Miami, FL",0,8,,2.0,10/4/2016,Service was horrific. Food was almost as bad as the service. I will never go back again. What a waste of beautiful restaurant.
Arturo B.,"Miami, FL",285,350,4101,4.0,2/26/2013,"I love BJ's excellent happy hour specials. The venue is nicely decorated and there a plenty of TV for all sports fans to enjoy. The blonde and hefeweizen are my favorite beers here. I enjoy the crisp flavor on the hefe. Order with an orange. It makes a difference. I usually alternate between both.  For food, the black and blue and the vegetarian flat breads take the win. We usually visit every two weeks after work to relax or watch a Heat game with brews and food.  Good times!!"
Jonathan C.,"Houston, TX",26,46,21,4.0,2/5/2015,"This is by far the best BJ's I've visited from the choices available in South Florida. There's plenty of parking, friendly staff, and ample seating inside.  My last visit there was for my best friend's birthday celebration. Our hostess was very friendly about informing us with the wait time for a table for 10 people, and we took all of 15 minutes patiently waiting for a large enough section to free up for us to sit at.  I won't go through what everyone ordered, and will instead explain what I got. I first ordered the ""Drink Like That"", which was voted most favorite for that particular restaurant. It was very yummy at first. However, when I took a sip after tasting the calami I ordered as an app, the aftertaste made me think of play-dough - it had the same exact taste, and was also kind of slimy when drinking it with food.  After not touching my drink, the waitress asked me if there was something wrong with it, which surprised me since she was serving a rather large group of people. She very quickly replaced my drink with some sweet tea, which helped get rid of the play-dough aftertaste.  My food was great, on the other hand. I ordered the rib-eye prepared medium-rare, and it came out delicious and flavorful. I'm very glad I went with it. Everyone else was very happy with their orders as well. All in all, we had a great experience and our waitress was amazing! The reason this review didn't get 5 stars is mostly because there lacked a certain exceptional quality to the food and atmosphere. Everything was great, but it didn't quite add up to five stars. It's still a favorite, and I can't wait to go back!"
Roxie G.,"Miami, FL",48,52,17,4.0,9/15/2014,"Their happy hour special is great. From 5 to 7 Monday thru Friday you get half off appetizers, flat breads, and mini pizzas. House wine are 4.00 and they have drinks and beer specials as well.  Happy hour is at the bar only so it does get pretty packed. Get their early to make sure you grab a table. The bartenders are on point and you will not wait long to order your drinks.  All the appetizers we tried were delicious. The sample appetizer is the best bang for your buck.  Appetizers are regular size so they are great for sharing.  Well definitely be back soon."
Melissa M.,"Miami, FL",8,14,,4.0,1/22/2015,"Came here for a quick bite to eat not sure of what to expect.  Hubs and I ordered the same plate, fettuccine alfredo with chicken/broccoli. Plate comes with toasted bread.  I got to tell you, it was satisfying. I've had an issue lately finding a good plate of alfredo since lately I can't stomach anything too garlicky.  Service wasn't bad, a little bit slow at first, but it was new years eve that day. We actually were seated upon entering. So overall I rate this place 4 stars just cause I was satisfied with the dish I ordered and the service wasn't awful."
Vanessa H.,"Miami, FL",198,6,,1.0,8/3/2016,"Poor service! I can't believe I waited 20 mins to be served!! First they tell us, ""your sever will be right with you"" waited 10 mins just to be told our server is ""weeded"" out. Whatever that means..."
Amir A.,"North Bay Village, FL",33,6,4,4.0,12/2/2013,This place has one of the best lunch specials in the doral area. The soup and salad unlimited is only $7.50 For a comfortable restaurant that's a great deal. The tomato bisque is excellent so is the wedge salad with tomatoes bacon and blue cheese. Service is spotty but so is everywhere else.
Andi T.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",299,164,119,4.0,12/2/2014,Food pretty decent.  Started as pizzeria- their personal pizza is awesome. Try the meat lovers if you want your mind blown.  Great service at this location.  Sit in the bar if you want super quick service.  Tomato & mozzarella salad one of the best appetizers.
Alex B.,"Miami, FL",56,217,50,3.0,8/6/2014,"I actually like this place and have only visited this location (Doral) however I have to admit the last few times have been average. The service is getting slower and the food quality is getting worse, for example water & utensils seem to come out right before your food arrives, the flatbreads & pizza are coming out with less ingredients (meats, veges etc).  I plan to send an email as soon as I can to corporate so they are aware and can make improvements (hopefully)."
Nathalie P.,"Doral, FL",9,8,6,2.0,7/22/2015,I like the Cheesecake Factory much better! This is just a more expensive version of it... Avocado egg rolls are better at cheesecake too...
Jessie M.,"Miami, FL",17,37,31,5.0,1/1/2016,We are new parents of a 7 month old baby so it's pretty hard to find places that are welcoming to us in a genuine way. We came on New Year's Day and I expected bad service but the hostess greeted us right away and seated us very quickly. We had the baby in the car seat and she brought us this contraption to put the car seat in and it was perfect! Our sever Aileen was super sweet and very attentive. I expected bad service because of the holiday it was quite the opposite. Food was delicious and beer was great. Had a very chill and yummy start to the new year.
Sabrina C.,"Miami, FL",370,698,193,4.0,11/22/2012,"Great new addition to my hood. Unfortunately I'm not a beer fan, for those who are, this is def a great place to try; I heard the pumpkin beer is quite tasty.  The menu is extensive, and they do have a lot of vegetarian friendly options. This time I tried the avocado rolls and they were so good!  The bar has happy hour prices til late and all appetizers are half off! A great deal!"
Tony B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1,25,1,2.0,1/21/2016,"Hmm, it is bad when You serve craft beer and the waitress does not understand ""Sculpin"" when discussing an IPA. The bartender serves a ""Stone"" saying, ""I think this is it."" No one bothers to tell the customer they do not understand what you ordered. The burger was tasty though not fully dressed. The potato wedges were underdone.  At least the burger was decent. It is a shame how bad this chain store is. I visited a location in Calgary, and it was great. I'm not interested in visiting this store again until the staff is properly trained."
Liza D.,"Miami, FL",7,9,1,4.0,7/6/2014,"I remember the days when the wait was forever and a day...when calling ahead was a necessity.  Those days are long gone.  I haven't had to wait at all the last few visits.   Anyway, I'm a creature of habit.  Boring I know!  I've been having the seared scallops with asparagus and rice.  Delish!!  I'm on a diet - again.  So last night, I ordered two sides of the asparagus instead of rice.  The scallops were delicious - as they always are.  The asparagus however....I think someone had an oops moment with the pepper.  My mouth was on fire!!!!   We did have mozzarella sticks.  Are you supposed to have mozzarella sticks when you are on a diet??  Probably not.  I'll start again Monday.  They were delicious.  My 6 year old daughter loves them.  Whenever I ask her if she wants to go to BJ's the first words out of her mouth are...mozzarella sticks!!!"
Cesar O.,"Hialeah, FL",0,36,2,1.0,1/17/2016,Went in and was told to wait. I waited for 10 minutes while they cleaned a table. Another couple walks in and was given my table. They were not even there for two minutes. Walked out and won't return. The problem is that they hire kids without proper training.  BJ's...Bad Judgement.
Miah L.,"Miami, FL",235,192,289,4.0,10/15/2014,"I've been here a few times over the last few months; the food is always tasty and service is quick. Sometimes - too quick. Last time we were there, the appetizer and our meals came out at the same time. It wasn't the waitresses fault though - without us even complaining, she had the manager comp the appetizer. The deserts are amazing and I love the parm crusted chicken. Great selection of beer also which is served super-chilled. I haven't been there for lunch but the menu totes some great priced deals. Great for a dinner date or to grab a bite with a large group. Versatile and clean!"
Katia A.,"Miami, FL",54,42,4,2.0,1/6/2016,was not impressed by this restaurant's food. There are so much better american places to eat. Wouldn't recommend. And Will not go back.
