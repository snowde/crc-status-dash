Virginia P.,"Miami, FL",396,82,350,5.0,9/27/2015,I love this place. Great food with lots of options and they're always sending me deals via email. Whether you're looking for comfort food or something healthy there are options here. My go to here are the Brussel sprouts snack and the quinoa bowls but I also love the Jambalaya. They have gluten free pizza and pizookies too!
Mike E.,"Miami, FL",76,97,5,2.0,1/2/2013,It's a chain with chain like food and chain like everything...the beer was MEH and everything about it was Meh... The service was good... meh.
Cyn B.,"Miami, FL",0,23,31,3.0,11/16/2014,This is like the 3rd time I've come here.  The food is okay and the service is okay. I'm not too crazy about the food. My friend had the chicken Cobb salad and the chicken looked like cubed ham...I mean come on for the price they could've thrown in some real pieces of chicken tenders.  We also had the potato skin platter which barely had any toppings. I had the chicken dumplings which were actually decent.  My first choice to eat was la carreta but place was packed. Since we were starving we landed on this place. The drinks are really the only thing worth coming here for.
Brittany A.,"Miami, FL",1,13,4,1.0,8/21/2015,It was my anniversary.  I know that yelp pays for positive reviews and I hate it.  The waiter cursed at me he said I'm just F***ing with you.  He served me the wrong drink I asked politely if he could change it and told him it wasn't his fault.  He took a sip of my drink through my straw to verify that my drink was incorrect that was really creepy.  I wasn't lying and then he said yea it is watermelon martini not strawberry mojito.  And he was just FUC*ing with me.?  Oy vey i am so creeped out by this experience.   I have never ever not left a tip.  Ever in my life.
Ana G.,"Miami, FL",70,85,91,4.0,11/19/2012,"Ay! Ay! Ay!  I am in trouble.... this place is awesomeeeeeeee... I thought it was going to be another trendy place with ok food, but boy o boy.. the beer alone won me over... I had the BBQ chicken pizza,,, yum,,, it was perfectly cooked, great portion.  My friend had an Angus beef blue cheese burger with waffle fries... to die for, very juicy, ,the cheese was not overwhelming, we all know blue cheese can be powerful, but it was just right...amazing..amazing..amazing..and the burger was hugeeeee...  The beer selections were great, I ordered the sampler which brings I believe 8, they were perfectly cold and tasty (I know, girls describe beer tasty lol). My waiter was very friendly and very open with suggestions, I will definitely go back, maybe to their new location located at the Falls Shopping center.... TIP: if you want a quiet dinner with your significant other or you simply want the noise level as a reasonable tone...sit outside, it is nice, cozy and more private...  I am a fan!!!! :)"
Diana R.,"Coral Gables, FL",523,143,6377,5.0,7/24/2014,"Let's call this place a high end sports bar with a to-die-for dessert menu. Hands down you have huge plasmas all over the restaurant and lots of beer choices on tap. We were 5 going for an early dinner on a Saturday, but thanks to my reservation on OpenTable there was no problem getting seated right away. I got to savor everything from sirloin steak, BJ's Brewhouse burger, ribeye, and my own dish...chicken bacon ranch deep dish pizza! We tried the spinach and artichoke dip, which was just right. Finally, we couldn't forget dessert. Was there even room for it at this point? Yes! The s'mores dessert can be shared, but do you want to? Or better yet, do you have to? I'll leave the choice up to you."
Ian G.,"Miami Beach, FL",32,51,,4.0,8/13/2014,"What?!?!?! What the hell is wrong with my co-workers. They are obsessed with the Moe's right down the street.  Then, one day, I decide to try out BJ's for lunch. If I didn't order a beer with my meal (don't think you can get that at your local burrito shoppe) my bill, including the tip, would have been cheaper than a Moe's burrito, and a lot better (got the southern fried chicken). Definitely going to be coming again to try out their pizza!"
Javy L.,"Miami, FL",105,36,22,4.0,12/4/2014,"It's normally hit or miss with this location, but I've noticed majority of the 'misses' are a thing of the past. Lately, the service has been quite appealing, with managers walking around asking how everyone is, to the waiter staying abreast on specials, menu recommendations, and dietary info. I have no doubt that I'll be back. This is full functional as a place to get brews and apps with friends, or a place to go on a date. Give it a shot!"
Abigale T.,"Auckland, New Zealand",5,11,15,5.0,2/2/2015,"Absolutely everything I want in a restaurant.  Good quality food. Fantastic customer service. Wonderful ambience and all around happy people in patrons, servers and staff.  Anna is one of the managers and she is a delight. She helped me ordering because I was a little overwhelmed.  Jose is the take out waitor and he was exceptional as well. Very excellent place for families and friends. Will go back anytime."
Angel G.,"Miami, FL",4,6,2,4.0,9/1/2015,The bison burger is very good. The fries are great. Sweet tea is good. Our waitress was nice. Download the app and you don't have to wait to pay for the food which is freaking awesome. Earn a point for every dollar you spend but not on liquor.
Sayda T.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,11,6,1.0,10/8/2015,"The worst experience in my Miami so far. We went to this restaurant on Sunday night, we jumped from one table to the next cause tables were smelly greasy n crumbles all over the seats. The waiter was rude, the food was horrible. We order the jambalaya rice, not a good choice. my sister ordered salmon, she didn't like either."
Marco A.,"Miami, FL",37,14,8,3.0,1/3/2016,"Best part is the variety of beer that is available. The food is good and the appetizers are great. Pizza is decent, don't go in expecting a real deep dish this left me hungry so I had to order more. Service is great! Our server was quick and the hostess was very polite."
Jorge S.,"Miami, FL",431,44,25,5.0,9/28/2015,"2nd time dinning at this establishment and I loved it. I always take my dates/friends/coworkers etc. The place so charming, the food is excellent and quick. The staff is young and fast and very friendly. Love it here..... and I was sober. ;-) Highly recommend it."
C M.,"Miami, FL",2,188,383,3.0,7/10/2014,"To start the place is nice and comfortable. Now the why I give three start is the food nothing of the ordinary menu, typical franchise food. Is not bad but I have taste it better in other places. The service is one of the why I give three start too. Mayra was real nice (our server) and keep us with the food coming at the right time. The dessert was OK nothing to really arise our expectations.  Well if you like craft beer and big flat TV's this is the place to go."
Jersey G.,"Miami, FL",1,33,1,4.0,9/21/2015,"Can't tell you how excited we were to see BJ's in Miami! This is a favorite from back home in TX, and yesterday we had a late lunch/early dinner, and they did not disappoint. Our waitress was excellent ( will have to look at the receipt for her name), and so was our food. Had to skip dessert (which we love there) because we were stuffed. Will be back for sure!"
Cescilia A.,"San Francisco, CA",57,115,46,3.0,1/25/2013,"Over rated. The beers were nothing special (got a beer sampler of all the beers they offer) The food reminded me of my horrible attempt at cooking (this is why I go out to eat) The menu was almost as big as the cheesecake factory. I seriously counted 3 full pages of pizza, i don't even think that pizza hut has that pages to offer. The place was packed, and our poor waiter seemed like he had just ran a marathon."
Gabriela O.,"Miami, FL",3,4,20,3.0,8/8/2014,"My daughters steak was great. Really good sized portions. Service was ok. My Mahi Mahi was bland, no taste what's so ever. The tortilla soup was good. The strawberry sangria also bland. Overall nothing special."
Dayana M.,"Hollywood, FL",7,9,,5.0,9/7/2015,"Favorite restaurant for beer and salmon. My fiance and I love it. Good atmosphere, great food, awesome place for chocolate chip cookies."
Monica B.,"Miami, FL",364,121,71,3.0,4/5/2014,"This is the type of place you go based on convenience more than because you are craving it. They have curbside pickup and everything could be ordered online (for those anti-human contact days, which I have often.)  BJs is ok food. It is not great food and it isn't gross food, but its just ok. The menu has a lot of variety and i think to an extent, that is the issue. They have so many things, they don't do any of them particularly great. EXCEPTION: Those pesky million calorie pizzokies. those are goooood!!  They have an appetizer happy hour and that would be the only time I would recommend the place.  They get 3 stars and not 2 because this is where I had my first date, so it holds a special place in my heart. Good ambience and energy ;)"
Lily S.,"Miami, FL",73,13,6,3.0,9/27/2015,"Everything was just okay. Food didn't have as much flavor as I expected from reading the reviews. Would recommend if you're only going for a drink because it's very loud. Service was good. Both are similar, but I prefer Cheesecake Factory. Don't think I'll be going again."
