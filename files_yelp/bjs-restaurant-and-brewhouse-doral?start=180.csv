Phuong O.,"Arlington, VA",13,360,1163,2.0,12/2/2013,"There were at least 12 of us here and my man ordered his drink and it never came. We waited over 30 mins before giving up and walking ourselves to the bar to get one. The chick at our table got her beer 15-20 mins after ordering it. It wasn't even a busy night, this was on a monday night. We ordered some boneless bbq wings and that was ok, it's more like breaded chicken bites than wings. I had a few calamari and that tasted so bland, a few people ordered mozzarella stixs, burgers, pot stickers, and other crap that didn't even look appealing. Other than their crafted beers... I think the food here sucks! just look at the pics that people posted on yelp... it doesn't look fresh at all. Observation mode was on when I was sitting there with the group, their food didn't look all that great when it came out. You know that look/drooling feeling when your food comes out and you're ready to devourer it? well it's not the case here."
Christian S.,"Miami, FL",2,6,,2.0,4/22/2016,"This is the fourth time I visit this place and probably the last time (unless I sit at the bar). I went for lunch with my wife and my one year old, our server's name was Christian, he started by taking our order and completely forgot about our appetizers, my wife's chicken was undercooked and it took them about 15 minutes to prepare a new dish (when her dish arrived I was already done with my plate) and it was delivered from a different server. Nonetheless, I really appreciate the fact that someone from the kitchen staff came to apologize for the inconvenience. Our server paid very little attention to our table, never offered a refill and I had to call him to ask for a second beer, since he didn't approach our table . After we finished with our meals (I should say after I finished with my meal, since my wife's appetite went away after waiting so long and ended up taking hers to go), we were ready to order desserts, however we were waiting for about 20 minutes for our server to come to our table (during this time my wife went to the car to picked up the diaper bag, changed our daughter and came back to the table) , when the server finally came to our table, after chitchatting with his co-workers we decided not to order any dessert as we were very frustrated with this experience. Finally, we did tip our server the 15% they suggest, not that he deserved it after the type of service he provided us; however in my opinion this is something that can be avoided and changed with the right management, supervision and better training. As far as the food, it was ok, the best is the beer selection."

Norman R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",18,42,,3.0,5/9/2014,"As a whole, BJ's isn't great, but it's not bad either.  This location is generally pretty good. The service is better here than at other locations, but it's consistently a little slower than others.  I recommend this place for a casual, predictable dinner in a group because of the diverse menu."
Antonio T.,"Miami Beach, FL",14,9,9,2.0,7/19/2015,"This place is a joke. Drinks were terrible, i asked for another one and they brought me something different. The food took forever to get here and it was bad. Server seemed indifferent when i said the pasta was very spicy and offered us some alfredo sauce that never got here. Needless to say, I wont be back. :)"
Javier R.,"Miami, FL",1,6,2,3.0,7/18/2015,About 15 to 20min to get our appetizer. Spinach dip appetizer came with bad quality chips (the leftovers). The entry came 2 min after the appetizer... Our waiter was nice and I have to admit it was a busy Saturday night.
Elizabeth S.,"Washington, DC",0,5,4,1.0,1/31/2015,We were seated 20 minutes and they gave us utensils and menus but no one has come to take a drink or food order. We will wait another 5 minutes and then leave to somewhere where they know how to treat customers .
Lisette O.,"Miami, FL",7,30,5,5.0,5/20/2015,Anything on this menu is DELICIOUS!!!!! Perfect for a date or just to dine with friends.
Sergio F.,"Miami, FL",117,55,33,4.0,3/29/2015,One of my favorite restaurants ! Customer service stinks though. It's always very slowwww. The food is great though! I personally prefer the pines location. Make sure to sign up for a bjs brew house rewards card! It's always a great feeling when you have a free pazookie!
Nikki R.,"Miami, FL",38,33,2,1.0,12/22/2014,"Horrible service! The silverware was filthy, the manager came to our table to apologize and brought us a new set of filthy silverware! The table behind us had the same issue. I will never eat here again."
Tony T.,"Miami, FL",22,45,1,4.0,6/6/2015,"I've been here a few times and I've had good a good experience with the food and the friendly staff each time. The ribs are absolutely mouthwatering and succulent! The food sometimes takes a while to arrive, but it's definitely worth it!"
Adriana P.,"Miami, FL",3,32,35,3.0,8/19/2013,"The times I've gone to BJ's I never had a problem with service and food but the last time I went was bad when I entered the place. I made reservations for seven people: five adults and two children. When I  told the hostess and I made reservation, she simply said that my name was not on the list. How could that be if I called them around twelve and I arrived at six? In six hours you didn't have my name written down for the reservation? Unprofessional and the place wasn't even pack on a Sunday night! There were a few empty tables and booths!  Then I asked how long did my family and I have to wait and she stated ""at least an hour"". An hour when there's barely a full house?! Called the manager and spoke to her including an elderly couple who was having the same issue as I was. The system with the timing and making reservation is bad.  Apparently we had to wait for fifteen minutes and we got seated. How hard was that? Our server Annie was great! She had everything memorized and got our orders right. Finally! Something that we need especially here in South Florida: a good server."
Adam R.,"Miami, FL",56,44,1,3.0,3/30/2014,"If I had to boil down this review to one sentence it'd be ""It's like Cheesecake Factory, but worse."" However, because I don't have to do that I can continue onward!  BJ's food is just alright. I've eaten here about 10 times, and each time the food is always good but not great. It's always good enough to not make you regret having to come back when a friend wants to go here (unlike Chili's which is always terrible). I've had pastas, pizzas, burgers, sandwiches, and pretty much whatever else they have. You will try in vain to find something that is exciting to eat and you will fail. BJ's has two things on every other chain restaurant: They brew their own beer (in addition to the normal stuff on tap) and they have a massive TV screen behind the bar that you can pretty much see from everywhere in the restaurant. The massive TV screen is great for watching games, and they can even break down different games into different sections of the TV. Every bar that can afford it should have one. The beers on the other hand are much like the food in that they are perfectly okay, but they just make you want something better. The service at BJ's will of course vary wildly since they have so many employees although whenever my friend wasn't my waiter, the service has been kind of terrible. The happy hour specials they have are also pretty good because they include alcohol AND food and they're during the early afternoon and past 10PM.  All in all, it's just an okay place. You'll probably eat here because you're at International Mall for some reason or around the area and you will argue with whoever you're with about what to eat and then before you know it, you're seated at a BJ's."
Emily S.,"Norfolk, VA",0,2,5,5.0,7/11/2015,Great food and decently priced!  Everything on the menu sounded delicious. Would definitely eat here again!
Lina P.,"Miami, FL",1,42,17,1.0,8/6/2015,"First time here, after Sitting For Fifteen Minutes We Were Trying To Wave A Waiter Down To Take Our Order THE  steak was not cooked the way I ordered it and sent it back and still was bloddy AND Chevy,  Was Not Impressed, It's MORE Of A BAR AND Appetizers Kind Of Place"
Annie B.,"Miami, FL",2,74,42,3.0,8/3/2015,Even though it seemed my waiter was having a bad day. No eye contact at all and was bothered by questions that had to do w the menu. The food was surprisedly good. It was four of us all our plates where delis. My fav dish was my fish tacos.
Mauricio V.,"Miami, FL",7,48,33,5.0,5/4/2015,Sat outside this time. Not recommended but sure was a good time. Good food and with awesome brew. Chilling
Claudia J.,"Miami, FL",278,403,675,1.0,4/28/2013,"Service was bad, our server had too many tables!!! we were ignored!!... not until we asked for the server for drinks, plus the server either was having a really bad day, or his personality does not go with a people person serving - definitely NOT! Food is meh.... I don't even remember what I had, yes it was that memorable!  It's crowded so be ready to wait and ready to call out for your server several times."
Nancy O.,"Coral Gables, FL",683,242,292,4.0,6/25/2013,"I went to eat here for their 10:00 p.m.-close happy hour. This was my first time at this particular location. I am deeply in love with the chicken pot stickers. The kitchen staff definitely makes them to the right texture and temperature. They offer $1 off their drafts which include their house brews! I always choose wheat light beers similar to blue moon. Therefore, I went with their hefeweizen house brew. Staff if helpful with selection and will gladly help you select your meal.  I didn't get a chance to try a Pazookie, a hybrid between the pizza form and a cookie; baked. three appetizers was enough to fill me up with no room for dessert. Hope you have better luck!"
George I.,"Miami, FL",8,59,3,3.0,2/16/2015,Safe to say I like this place. I say come when you have an itch for beer. Since they craft their own beers.The food is good but not spectacular. My only complaint is they claim to make deep dish pizza but it was thinner than the pan pizza you get at Pizza Hut. The taste itself isn't good. Other than that get ANYTHING else and you should be good.
