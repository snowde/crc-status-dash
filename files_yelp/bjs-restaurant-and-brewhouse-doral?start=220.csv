Jessica B.,"Miami, FL",251,257,,4.0,7/28/2014,"Came here for dinner with the family and we were seated right away.  My brother in law started with the clam chowder bread bowl which was delish, then my husband had the chicken avocado with fries ( really good), i had the lighter fare scallops (tender)with brown rice and asparagus with the tomato/mozarella salad (awesome) and my b-i-l had the angel hair pasta with shrimp and tomatoes(great).  We ended the night with a white chocolate and salted caramel Pookie cookie.  Over all great food, the only draw back was that the waiter brought us the bill and we hadn't finished  our dinner and didn't even have our desserts yet so that was quote uncomfortable."
Natalie M.,"Miami, FL",35,6,1,2.0,10/26/2013,"You know those places where you go once and from then on you have a ""regular"" that you order on every subsequent visit? Yeah, BJ's is not one of those places where you find that. I've visited this BJ's half a dozen times - each time ordering a different dish - and have been really disappointed on every occasion. In my experience, the food lacks any real taste and is rarely cooked properly.  Its saving grace is the beer selection and the service."
Yami A.,"Miami, FL",0,3,,3.0,2/16/2014,"This place is pretty and all, but the food was mediocre. My mom and I ordered the Salmon Teriyaki, expecting a fillet, what we got was a salmon chop chop... It was a cup of rice smothered in teriyaki sauce with nine tiny pieces of salmon mixed in the dish. This dish was $18 for something that hardly had any salmon at all. The only thing that I did enjoy was the Parmesan crusted chicken my boyfriend ordered and the selection of imported beers was great too! They're actual brewed beer was nothing out of this world. Overall, the restaurant was decent."
Raul V.,"Miami, FL",0,25,2,2.0,11/17/2013,"Beware of this place. We went for lunch and the waitress overcharged everything on the bill thinking we wouldn't catch it. Think again. We spoke to the manager and you just couldn't help it but feel he was in on it too. Always check your bill before paying it and keep an eye on the advertised prices in the menu.  Regarding the food, it's been pretty good. I like the pizza and their desert is amazing. You have to try their pizookie. (I think that's what it's called)."
Jocelyn P.,"North East, MD",86,116,90,3.0,5/9/2013,"So even though we had a terribly awkward experience here I still have to love this place for having awesome service....ish... We ordered white pizza but here apparently white pizza is actually regular pizza with chicken and mushrooms. So we expected a pizza with white sauce because that's what we wanted and its what the menu said but after sending back it back two times, having all the waitresses and a manager agree they thought something wasn't right, and waiting like an extra hour we have up and were too hungry so we just lived with it because the kitchen insisted that white pizza had red sauce and looked like grilled chicken pizza with giant hunks of mushrooms garlic and some sausage type object. After all this mess they gave us dessert on the house so we ordered the three pizzookie platter and when that came out it was the wrong order. I couldn't help but bust out laughing but we didn't want to send it back again so we just ate it and left.  Everything we ate was good and the staff on the floor was awesome we just never got what we ordered. So at least they seem to be trying."
Robert F.,"Miami, FL",22,65,37,2.0,8/3/2014,"We've been to this place now like 3-4 times. I can't see myself going again for some time. The food is simply like any other chain sports bar and/or restaurant. The Avocado Egg rolls are average at best. We asked for the BJ's Specialty Deep Dish pizza with extra sauce and it had almost NO sauce. It was almost as if they confused it for No sauce. I just haven't been impressed at all with the food every time I go here. The only reason we've gone back is because it's near the mall when we're shopping. There is one thing I will say, the service has always been good to excellent. This last visit we requested outside and were seated promptly.  Our server was very nice."
Victoria A.,"Atlanta, GA",707,50,33,4.0,8/23/2014,"Always enjoy the food here! The first time I went, my server was terrible... And I'm not a harsh critic. However, that was long ago and I'm not one to judge an entire restaurant based on a single server. Very clean restaurant which is always a plus. If you go, ask for Alexandra C. To be your server, she's so sweet, funny and attentive!"
Jeremy S.,"Miami, FL",0,27,,3.0,6/3/2014,"I see a lot of BJ haters on Yelp, but I find it a very good happy hour place.  Appetizers are cheap and the beer selection is very good.  Service is friendly but slow.  All in all, a suitable place to celebrate the end of a workday."
China F.,"Miami, FL",2,12,12,4.0,6/17/2013,Mahi mahi tacos with sauce on the side ... U cant go wrong with that ... Delicious!   I come here when i'm undecided on what i want to eat.... they have a little bit of everything .... and then some ..
Tom S.,"Miami Lakes, FL",2,2,4,5.0,2/20/2015,"Their steak seasoning is very good, pair it with the horseradish mash  and a Jeremiah red-- you won't regret it."
Felix J.,"Miami, FL",263,137,128,4.0,11/28/2012,"I like it. Beers are great and menu is VERY extensive. I signed up for the rewards program and that has a few bugs in it and sometimes I don't get the credit. Other than that, I've only had positive experiences in the half dozen times I've been here."
Ryan M.,"Miami, FL",0,6,,3.0,9/5/2013,"Service wise I have never had any bad experiences at this restaurant, however they do have their good and their bad days when it comes to both flavor and portions. The last time I went, I ordered the teriyaki salmon dish, there were only about 6 or 7 small bits of salmon on top of a pile of rice drenched teriyaki.  For such a great location and it could be better."
Albert S.,"Miami, FL",65,10,8,4.0,9/19/2014,I knew I should keep coming back hoping for better.  I went to the opening of the place and especially in the last two visits (my office is nearby) I have to say that the service and quality have both improved greatly.  Skip the salmon though.  It is terrible.  Tried it once in Tallahassee and gave it another shot here in Doral.  It is just a BAD BAD recipe.
Keila C.,"Miami, FL",17,6,4,3.0,9/14/2014,"Staff was friendly, appetizers were good. My entree was just okay. Am I coming back? Eh perhaps.. Not sure"
Marky M.,"Bethesda, MD",0,3,4,5.0,9/12/2015,"Amazing service!!! First time I had been to a Bj's. I was greeted by the house and there was no wait. I was sat near the bar.. In the booths.. It was pleasant. My server Jorge came within seconds of sitting down to greet us. He was so energetic, funny and charismatic!!! from that moment I knew it was going to be a great experience. He suggested some drinks to start and describe beers we were interested in. He was very knowledgeable on everything we asked. He suggest we start off with a sampler to see which we liked best.. And an appetizer.. Avocado egg roles.. They were amazing. He then came back to check up on us within seconds of getting appetizer.. And we asked about diff food items and then we ordered. He accommodated our needs due to certain food allergies.. After our entree he offered and suggested diff deserts.. We couldn't leave without trying the pizooki ... Amazing to say the least! We will deff be coming back. Hopefully Jorge can be our server. He definitely made a difference in our experience. Very up beat and funny."
Grecy A.,"Miami, FL",8,19,22,4.0,8/4/2014,Great place to come for Happy Hour with friends.  Great food and drinks while you chat and watch the game.
Juan P.,"Miami, FL",23,24,1,1.0,10/19/2014,"This is the first time I come to the Doral location.  I've been to the location by the Falls several times and it's great!  The same cannot be said about the Doral location.  The ONLY positive thing about this place was the food, the service...well they have A LOT to learn.  We were about 5 minutes away from this location and i called ahead to see if they took reservations or a call ahead list because we were a large group of 12.  After going through the auto attendant, a live person answered and I asked the girl about the call ahead list their recording stated.  She said that the call ahead is only for a group of 1-6 guests.  So i told her we were a large group of 12 and she said, ""you can't do call ahead, you just have to come in on a first come first serve basis"".  I said ok and asked for the wait time, she said ""well right now there is no wait so if you come now it will not be a long wait at all"" I told her ok that we were already on the way and very close by.  When we get there we are told that the wait would be an hour because we are a large group and they had a group of 16 that had called ahead.  We were shocked.  We told the girl that we were told that the call ahead was not for large groups and how could it be that another group larger than ours did a call ahead reservation?  The girl could have caught several flies with her open mouth...she didn't know what to say.  This started my experience on the wrong foot.  We complained and the manager came out to apologize and said that the group before us had a reservation...HOW CAN THAT BE IF WE WERE TOLD THEY DON'T TAKE RESERVATIONS!!!.  Whatever, we waited and about 45 minutes of waiting we were seated.  As soon as we sat down a server came by and said that he was not our regular server but that he would take our drink order so we didn't have to wait to long for our drinks while our regular server attended to other guests.  I thought, well that's nice of him.  we all ordered our drinks.  I ordered the ever so complicated drink order of WATER.  The drinks of those that ordered beer got their beers right away but those of us that ordered, as i said the ever complicated drink order of water, never got our waters until about the time that our food got to the table...RIDICULOUS!  As i mentioned at the beginning the food was good, we all enjoyed the food but the service was SUPER slow and made my night frustrating.  After dinner the server took FOREVER to come and ask if we wanted dessert (which i did and was looking forward to it) but by the time she FINALLY showed up I passed on the dessert because by the time she got to the table and asked I figured it would take another 20-30 minutes to get the dessert and i just wanted to get the HELL out of this place.  If you want to go to eat at BJ's then i HIGHLY recommend to stay clear of the Doral location and drive to the Falls location where we have never had any issues when eating there."
Manram R.,"Miami, FL",2,160,11,2.0,12/2/2015,"Not impressed , salad was ok and desert was ok , but the 2 star rating is for the poor chicken Parmesan that tasted frozen and not very fresh. The bj by the falls has never had this issues. So the harsh review may be due to the standards of the other bj in the falls but still that's the point of chains to taste the same."
Jessica P.,"Miami, FL",6,33,21,3.0,6/29/2014,Food is good but a little tooo pricey! Our bill was for 70$ and it was 2 adults and a child. Service was okay nothing out this world.
Alejandra C.,"Miami, FL",7,25,11,2.0,3/4/2014,"Servers are not good at all! I have been there 4 times , always different servers but same bad service ! Why do I keep going ? Because my friends love it and the food is great !"
