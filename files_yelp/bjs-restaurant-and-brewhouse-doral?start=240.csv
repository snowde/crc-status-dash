Aileen C.,"Miami, FL",0,10,,5.0,9/24/2015,"3 Years ago I read my dissatifcation about BJs, just last year i went back to try out the pizza. I wish that woud've been my first option that way I wouldn't have to come back to update this review. With that being said, the pizza was delicious and their sandwiches too. Either they've improved their menu since 2012 or... they changed the chef. Keep it up!"
Katrina B.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",676,120,1,4.0,4/17/2014,"BJ's has a great selection of appetizers and locally brewed beers.  Prices are very affordable as well!  I went last night after work around 7 p.m. and was surprised by the crowd, I really thought it was going to be empty.  So if you like bar seating, like I do, I would try to get here before 6 pm on a weekday."
Eli S.,"Miami, FL",0,5,1,2.0,10/16/2014,Honestly I thought this place would be better but they have alot of work to do when it comes down to their service...very sloooow we waited for our food for about an hour or longer I was started to think they forgot us. They kept bringing the drinks which by the time the food came I couldnt even see it...
Suzie B.,"Miami, FL",6,25,,2.0,12/23/2013,"I have visited this location a few times and have to say the service leaves a lot to be desired. The first time, they completely left my husband without a meal, as I think they forgot to enter it into the system.   The next time, we were with a large group (around 20).  We had called to reserve a table the day before.  They reserved a section outside for us but that meant splitting up the entire party into 5 different tables.  When you reserved a day ahead of time for something like this you don't expect to be told the entire party will sit in 5 separate tables.  When we asked to move, the waiter said ""sure, but the only reason I came in to work tonight is because of this party and if you move I will lose the opportunity""  Like that's our problem?!   I just went to lunch there this afternoon because it was the most convenient location for the time we had.   We ordered a beer and a margarita.  The waiter completely forgot to put the drink order in and we got our drinks half way through our meal.  We had ordered them with the food and appetizer and it took us reminding them and then they finally brought it out.  The food is pretty good but just brace yourself for less than impressive service."
Luis Pablo A.,"Miami, FL",92,24,53,4.0,1/10/2013,"Good food, great service, good price! a real good place for hanging out and for Family"
Lisandra H.,"Miami, FL",11,10,1,1.0,11/30/2013,"Pizza tasted like pizza hut's pizza, fries were like steak and shake, burger was worse than McDonald's And the pasta tasted like it had been out for days.  The Angel hair was also chopped up like if it was leftleftovers from others plates, i couldn't eat it. I'm not a picky eater and I'm never going back there again. To add onto the bad food, the service was even worse, we waited over 30 minutes for the check and finally gave up and went straight to where the cash registers were asked for the check and paid there. Avoid this place"
Jorge M.,"Miami, FL",14,6,2,2.0,5/24/2014,"I went into BJ's brewery with high hopes as  I'd heard some good things from friends...guess I'm never listening to these friends again.  The food looked nothing like the pictures, which would have been okay if it at least had some flavor , which of course it didn't. The avocado egg rolls were bland, the burger was dry and the pizza was just terrible (who messes up pizza?).  The restaurant itself was nice to look at, and the service was great. Too bad no amount of water refills makes up for the terrible mush they try to pass off as food."
A N.,"Miami, FL",0,16,,3.0,9/18/2015,"Been here a few times and it's really a hit or miss. Last time, my server was Robert and he was very attentive and professional. The food is tasty, but a bit overpriced, and I've had to send food back before because it's been cold or the steak was overdone. It's a cool place, but it's also pretty dark inside and very loud."
Maple P.,"Miami, FL",0,21,47,3.0,10/3/2015,"Made a reservation and got seated within 5 minutes of our arrival. The lighting is horrible when we got seated. We got seated at 6:30pm. To look at the menu, I had to raise the menu up to be parallel to my eyes since the lighting was so horrible we couldn't see any of the words on the menu.  When we got seated, 10 minutes passed with no waiter passing by to take our beverage orders. The manager came up and kindly offered to take our beverage and appetizer orders. The waiter (Wess/Ress?) came later to give us our drinks. We ordered the fire-roasted salsa with tortilla chips. It is not fire-roasted salsa. The salsa is COLD. We also got the crispy calamari, it toke 30 minutes to get, but came out okay. The breading fell off a bit while dipping it into the sauce and breading was overly soaked in oil. Around 7:15pm more lighting was turned on. I got the Cajun Pasta. The sauce was like a blend of red spaghetti tomato sauce and Alfredo sauce, which I found to be sour. The two pieces of garlic bread that came with the pasta was amazing. Crispy, buttery, and well seasoned, I loved the taste of it. The chicken was really chewy, seemed to be over cooked, I could see some parts were burnt. When we asked for the check, it toke over 15 minutes for the waiter to come back with our check. The waiter wasn't around for another 10 minutes to pick up the check and another 10 to come back with the credit card and receipt. Service was slow (food was slow to arrive and waiter seemed to materialize after stopping by our table) and the food was average quality. Nothing worth spending the $250 we spent for our party of 8."
Ivette R.,"Miami, FL",268,1047,251,5.0,9/1/2014,I love this BJ's BREWHOUSE because it's close to my work and is way better than the one in the falls.This BJ's has fast service and great food and our waitress was nice
Maria A.,"Miami, FL",14,17,1,4.0,5/24/2014,"Been here a few times and feel it is a safe choice that will get you an okay meal, at okay prices. It is simply that, ok. They have a large menu where you are sure to find something that calls your attention. Their ""enlightened"" items are a good plus for those wishing to eat a healthier ootion. However, at least this location is loud and too dark for my taste."
Juan M.,"Miami, FL",26,9,2,4.0,7/18/2013,"Food is great, but the service is hit or miss. We had to ask for a new server after ours started arguing with us. They assigned a new waitress and she was perfectly accommodating; the way service should be. They have a beer for everyone, so give the samplers a try. Also, their happy hour has weird rules, like only applying at the bar on some days or at all on other days. Every staff member gave a different answer."
Roberto G.,"Miami, FL",18,35,,4.0,10/20/2013,"Better than other rest chains. Good service , the menu extremely large , prices as other American chain restaurant . Good environment , you can repeat..."
P L.,"Doral, FL",0,10,1,1.0,4/18/2015,"So this is about the same time 10th time we come to BJ's. I came with my family (group of 5). For appetizers we ordered crispy calamari and the avocado egg rolls. They both tasted all right BUT, definitely not how they have in the past. They did get to our table very quickly. We then went on to order the deep dish pizzas that I had heard good things about. I ordered the chicken ranch one and my boyfriend the gourmet five meats. My dad ordered the BJ's special and my mom the Italian flat bread one. We began to eat when right away my boyfriend takes a long hair out of his mouth. It was disgusting. There was a hair inside of his deep dish pizza. We told the waiter right away and he apologized and said he'd call the manager. A few minutes later the manager came by and she also apologized and offered to get the same plate again but we decided that we did not want to wait again so we just ended up sharing mine. Gotta say I am disappointed, I know it can happen anywhere but we did not expect it here. Won't be coming back. Our food took a very long time and definitely not worth eating with a HAIR on it."
Kristen M.,"Miami, FL",0,13,4,4.0,6/3/2015,New and clean restaurant added to international mall. Very clean with good service and a decent menu
Valentina S.,"Miami, FL",0,1,,1.0,7/8/2014,"I'm honestly not one to do surveys, call managers or in order words complain about my visits to restraints, I rather just not go back. But this time....I've had enough.  I made a yelp account just for this.  My first review...here we go.  I've had about 4 occasions where I've had a horrible experience at this BJs. I stopped going for about a year because of it, but this past week my friends invited me, and I decided to give it another chance.  The wait wasn't as bad. I think the girl taking our names could have been a little nicer, but hey it wasn't horrible, so that didn't bother me. My friends and I say outside for about 10 min until we were called in, then lead to our table by some other girl.  We say down and started looking thru the menu, I had been there a couple times before so I knew kinda what I wanted. Out waiter came by after around 5 min and took our drink order. Everything seemed to be going pretty good... We he brings our drinks, I ordered a cream soda. It was good, but it had no ice. Don't get my wrong, the soda wasn't hot...but it wasn't cold either. A little ice would have  been nice. But whatever, no biggie for me.  He then took our orders. Both my friends that I was with are vegetarians, but I'm not. So I got a chicken with mash potatoes and broccoli. My other friend got mac and cheese (she asked for no bacon) and the other girl got the mushrooms.  About 45 min later our good comes. It felt a lot longer then it really was...I still think 45 min is a lot to wait but whatever. At least the food is finally here. As soon as he set my friends plate down with her mac and cheese, she notices it has bacon on it, and just tells the guy if he could get her another one with no bacon. It's cool, the guy takes it back. As she's waiting for herac and cheese I start eating my chicken. It's pretty good. Then I go to eat my broccoli, and my fork wouldn't pierce through it. Weird. I tried again and it was super hard. Upon further inspection.... I got raw broccoli.  Seriously.  Like it still had that white residue on it, shows that it hadn't even been rinsed or anything.  They bring my friends mac and cheese back, still had bacon. We let them know about my broccoli situation and they said they were gonna give me another side. Never came. We asked to speak with a manager. He didn't speak much English, but explain that my friends mac and cheese was delivered to the wrong table (three times?) and that he was sorry about my broccoli. They never brought the extra side. The only person that ended up eating was my friend with the mushrooms.  It saddens me because this place has so much potential, but the service is so bad. Like I said, I been there many times before, but stopped going because of the service. I won't be going back here ever again, maybe to another BJs location, but never back to this one."
Wendy H.,"Miami, FL",75,93,20,1.0,4/21/2013,The best tip I can give you is to stand up and walk out.  The food was terrible.  4 entrees returned for being absolutely gross.  The Manager was so nice about it that we felt bad but it was just terrible food.
Frine L.,"Hialeah, FL",119,7,1,1.0,9/6/2013,"I wouldnt know where to start... Ive been to the Pines location 3 times and the last two times were horrendous! The guests i took for dinner thought i was an idiot for picking the place. Today my husband and i decided to try the new location in doral, he's a beer drinker and i like ciders so we decided to give it another chance. Dinner started out bad but spiraled into worse very fast. The managers do not have any training, neither does the sarcastic staff. Dont even think about ordering the same drink twice, each time it looks and tastes different. We had to go to the bar to get water, while our waiter pranced throughout the restaurant. Will never ever visit either one, and will make sure to tell everyone I know!"
Krystina S.,"Miami, FL",82,20,,3.0,7/30/2013,"The beers are great and the bar knows their drinks. But their food is somewhat overpriced, though good in general. Your best bet is ordering just appetizers with your drinks."
Megan G.,"Miami, FL",9,40,,4.0,5/8/2014,"I've been to this restaurant 8-9 times, and I always find the same problem: slow service. They always take forever to bring the food to the table (time of day does NOT make a difference.) Drinks, I've tried Margaritas, and honestly, I don't like how they make them. The food is good, can be greasy sometimes but overall, it's not bad."
