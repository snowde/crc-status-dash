Debi C.,"Gilbert, AZ",18,45,3,1.0,6/25/2013,"I love all the BJ's locations so I as VERY disappointed when we came to this one. I don't know what was worse, the food or the service in general or our server.  Nothing good to say at all.  We will never return to this location. But I do recommend you try their other locations"
L D.,"Hialeah, FL",0,2,,1.0,7/14/2013,"This place was terrible. Where to begin?  I ordered a Magic Hat #9 beer to drink along with someone I was eating with. When the waiter finally brought our beers over I noticed the two looked different. When I tasted mine it turned out they had given me Miller Light or Coors Light. I notified the waiter so I could get the right beer and he came back empty handed, saying they were out of the beer I ordered. Clearly the bar tenders had given me some random beer in the hopes I would not notice the difference. Sorry, I did! On to the food, which all came out entirely cold. Not to mention the one order they got completely wrong and had to be sent back. After 15 minutes of waiting for the order to come out correctly, I had to call the waiter over to check on the order. Miraculously when he returned he had the right dish in hand.  Nobody apologized for the mistakes, nobody came to the table to ask how everything was, nothing. I rather eat at McDonalds and get hot food and far better customer service. Horrible service, horrible drinks, horrible food. Count this place out."
Green L.,"Homestead, FL",1,117,,1.0,6/24/2013,"I went in today for lunch and some dumb little girl was at the hostess stand, she had a little attitude problem and she seemed to get upset when I requested a booth, my point is that if you are working a ""service"" job, especially as a hostess, all you have to do is be nice, smile and listen, it's a simple job, there is no room for snobby little immature attitudes in the work place. I am not surprised though, the service at their Falls location sucks too. They should hire more mature people."
David F.,"Miami, FL",0,10,,1.0,5/25/2015,"I've been here twice. The first time: food was not very good, everything was overly salty. The service was pretty bad also and almost did not leave a tip. The second time was about the same except this time I did not leave a tip because I was ignored. This experience made me join Yelp!"
Mavis J.,"Atlantic City, NJ",0,35,3,3.0,1/16/2014,"Always loved BJs but do NOT order the Parmesan chicken!! Tasted like cardboard! Mashed potatoes tasted like box potatoes! Service was good, but would never order the dish again! Stick with Salmon!!!"
Stephanie N.,"Miami, FL",230,88,29,5.0,1/7/2013,"So glad they opened one of these closer to my house! Boyfriend went in on a Friday night and were seated within 15 minutes. We had heard the portions were big, so we decided on nachos (appetizer) to share and chicken wings. The nachos were HUMONGOUS and the wings were surprisingly juicy as hell and perfectly cooked. For entrees, we were so full that we decided to share the bacon cheeseburger. Needless to say, we were stuffed to the gills. Although we were full, I decided to give in on a mini oreo pizookie since pizookies are what drove me to go there in the first place. I was not disappointing. The cookie was warm and gooey. Cant wait to go back and try more."
Brett H.,"Rochester, MN",68,320,,4.0,1/21/2013,"Great atmosphere as every time I've gone (3 times now) its been packed. The food is good. I've had the pizza, boneless wings, and sliders. Good selection of beer and enough tvs to come and enjoy the game. A great ""after work"" spot."
Ximena P.,"Miami, FL",150,60,10,2.0,12/24/2012,"Never coming again. Came with a group and it literally took an hour for them to split our check, and they still couldn't split the check."
Alex F.,"Miami, FL",21,9,,3.0,2/16/2015,"Food is ok,  place is nice but pricy. Cheesecake factory across the street offers a lot more for around the same price."
Mandy R.,"Coral Gables, FL",11,6,5,5.0,3/29/2014,"The service was great. Dan, our waiter, was great and friendly. The appetizers were a perfect portion. We had the flatbread and potato skins. We also had the chocolate cookie  dessert, it was very good!  Will return!"
Oscar P.,"Miami, FL",0,15,12,1.0,2/24/2013,"Management removes negative reviews, so I hope somebody reads this before its removed. Save you money, stay away from this place. Microwave food, poor service, loud, crowded, etc., etc."
Christine T.,"Miami Lakes, FL",165,81,16,3.0,3/12/2013,"For a brewery, I was disappointed in their beers. By far the best is the Amber ale, the IPA was too weak and the pilsner might as well have been water. I had a sample of the beers for less than $7, which was nice but I have to say the Titanic on US 1 brews better beer. This BJ establishment is fairly new and the inside is nicely decorated and has a good flow/setup. I ordered the sliders which were ok....nothing to rave about. I had the potato skins which were definitely worth going for. It is so hard to find good potato skins in Miami. Crunchy but not burnt, cheesy with copious amounts of bacon. Perfection for me. I definitely need to try the pizza next time since they have some fame for that and see if I change my rating then."
Eliecer O.,"Alexandria, VA",276,203,143,2.0,9/19/2013,"Well I went on a busy Thursday today. Chairs were removed from the bar and mined to tables. I asked one of the employees if I could pull a chair and she told me she had not punched in and I should ask the bar tender. She walked away. I waited to get take care of and was not, so I left. The greeters noticed and said nothing either. Poor, poor customer service. Very disappointed. I went to Buffalo Wild Wings instead."
Mario S.,"Miami, FL",2,20,4,2.0,1/31/2014,let me try it like this from a scale from  1 to 10: Atmosphere ..........................  9 Hostess  ................................  9 Waiter    ...................................1 Sliders.  ...................................9 French fries .............................9 Flatbread California pizza ......1  tuna.    .....................................7 Calamari. .................................6  strawberry lemonade.............  8 ***pizza took long time & was warm with no cheese on it!***
Dave C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,19,,2.0,7/2/2013,"Food was okay but they really botched the end of our order.  Manager came out and was apologetic.... Stuff happens; good place , but tonight was not their night."
Michael O.,"Miami, FL",0,45,,2.0,1/18/2013,"I've been here a few times for lunch.  OK, I've never seen so many waiters and waitresses work in one place, ever.  I'm not sure if this is the training program for all wanna-be BJ's staff, but it's wild.  A different server will serve you your drinks, then appetizers, then main course, dessert, etc. They have a very large menu which does mean that nothing is really great.  I've had the avocado egg rolls which are good and a burger.  Ok micro-brews. Sat outside once and was invaded by ants.  Hopefully they've exterminated them by now. Think Applebees or Chilis except that it's called BJs and serves ""micro-brews"""
Lisa B.,"Miami, FL",0,15,3,3.0,3/25/2013,"This place is very average. It feels like it's trying to rip off a great microbrewery in Boca Raton Called Brewzzi. We ordered nachos, a pizza, and a turkey burger. Nachos were pretty bland and just kind of gross, pizza was super greasy and turkey burger was just ok. Service was devent. Had drink called snakebite which was a pear ale or something and guiness.. Was almost undrinkable. Weird combo. Anyway I would probably never eat here again. It just reminds me too much of Brewzzis, which makes it that much paler in comparison. There are better places to spend $65 pre-tip for two. Enjoy."
Mercy T.,"Miami, FL",0,1,1,1.0,2/20/2015,Went to eat at this restaurant  with my husband and had to wait 20 minutes for a waiter to come ask us what we wanted to drink . Best part having dinner with cockroaches crawling on the table. We call the manager and all he had to say was that he was sorry
Monica C.,"Miami, FL",2,7,,1.0,12/11/2012,NEVER AGAIN! Went in a group for a friends bday. Most orders were wrong. Appetizers were forgotten. Plates were never taken off the table. They even managed to forget a couple rounds of birthday shots! You would think their goal is to make you write a bad review. Accomplished. Don't waste your time.
Carlos R.,"Miami, FL",1,2,5,4.0,2/23/2013,"Bartender was attentive, food was good but it does take a little while as other reviews point out. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars."
