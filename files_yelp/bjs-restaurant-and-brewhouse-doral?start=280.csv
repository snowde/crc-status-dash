Luis M.,"Miami, FL",0,3,,2.0,4/7/2013,"Have tried twice, both experiences were horrible. From service bringing dirty plates to just disappearing all together.  Food was average at best."
Kevin O.,"North Miami, FL",13,3,,3.0,1/10/2013,"I went opening week and service was poor, but I did not hold that against them since it had only been open one week. So I went back two months later and it was still sub standard. It's a shame because the foods good."
Tati M.,"Miami, FL",78,24,30,4.0,4/10/2013,"i have been here a couple of times and i have to say that i have always had great service and the food has always been quite good.  I came here for lunch yesterday and ordered the Santa Fe salad with shrimp and the Tomato soup...YUMMM (that's what i usually order when i go for lunch). Their was a mishap with our tomato soup; they gave our soups to another table and we didn't get them till' after our salad so our waiter charged us the soups as small but gave us the large ones. On another point, i like that the manager came around each table to make sure everyone was ok with their order. Overall our experience was satisfying and will definitely be back!"
Nick S.,"Washington, DC",0,11,,1.0,10/4/2013,"This is the worst food ever.  What they serve is insulting. Not fresh, pizza was probably tombstone frozen pizza or worse. The beer is ok but not returning until i see better reviews"
Javier L.,"Miami, FL",57,33,12,4.0,7/17/2013,"If you love beer, thus is a great place. They brew their own beer. Food quality is great. Family friendly. By far the best deep dish pizza in Miami! They only down side is the service, it can be a bit slow. But everything else is great."
Guillermo R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",208,126,32,4.0,4/20/2013,"Awesome beer. Good food. Better than the average chili's, Applebee's and the likes..."
Kari L.,"Miami, FL",4,37,11,4.0,9/9/2013,"I've visited BJ's out in California and was so excited when I found out there was one in Miami. I've been to this location twice and both times service and food was good. Maybe I've just gotten lucky! Love that they do call-ahead seating. The desserts are always good, especially the cookies and cream pizookie. Sometimes the food is hit-or-miss. I've had to try a variety of things and about 80% of them are good... I'd say main dishes are better than the appetizers. Overall a nice place!"
Niniva S.,"Miami, FL",0,43,,1.0,6/2/2013,"Horrible service, dirty plates, cold food. The place has reasonable prices, but I have to say, you get what you pay for."
Steven P.,"Miami, FL",0,4,,5.0,11/6/2012,Heard through a friend that this place just opened up so My wife and I decided to try it out for lunch. Jenner the bartender took care of us and I must say I was thoroughly impressed by his overall knowledge of the menu. He recommended the pumpkin ale beer which was amazing. We shared an Avocado egg roll appetizer which was mouthwatering and went great with my beer! Overall We loved BJ's and will definitely come back for more! A definite must try in Doral!!!!
E R.,"Ruskin, FL",1,4,,2.0,1/5/2015,I was staying in Doral 2014 from March to June and never got a bad meal or service.  The I was staying in Doral from September to December.  I looked forward to the same great food and service but consistently did not get it.  The only reason I have kept returning is because it's convenient to my hotel.  The service has usually been good but the food is just meh to uh huh. One night I even sent my meal back since it did not taste good at all.   I've tended to want to do take out but often times I get no answer when I call so I go some place else.  I'm just not thrilled with the place.
Mandy G.,"Miami, FL",37,78,2,4.0,12/1/2012,"It was my first time at BJ's and I had a really nice experience. The waiter was awesome - very attentive. The atmosphere was a little loud because there was a game going on, but still very pleasant. We tasted a few beers before making our selections. The brews were good, not excellent, but definitely good for the price. Since we only had appetizers I can't comment too much on the food, but I would gladly back to try some of their other beer and spirits along with the food."
Phil B.,"Miami, FL",18,9,,1.0,9/8/2013,"This place has terrible management/owners, We waited 20 minutes for a table... thought we would get some drinks from the bar while waiting.... After being ignored for a long time we just decided to wait outside. Once we got our table things just got worse, we never got any drinks until we almost finished our meal. The waitress was great. The bar was terribly understaffed... only 2 bartenders for this (over) packed place. I went to an unapologetic manager who was no help. Finally got a drink just as we finished the greasy over-priced burgers. NEVER AGAIN. STAY AWAY."
Sebastian V.,"Miami, FL",110,1,,2.0,9/8/2013,"The food isn't bad, but the service is completely terrible. I went with a party of 6 and they sat us down in a table that barely fit us. It fit only 4 people. How did we know that? Only 4 sets of tableware were set. We asked for 2 more sets and they completely forgot to bring it to us. Plus, the food took forever to get to our table and there wasn't even that many people. Overall, good food, terrible service."
Cristina P.,"Miami, FL",14,118,31,4.0,12/2/2012,"Great addition to the Doral/Sweetwater area.  Beer is great and the food is pretty good also.  The staff is friendly.  Came on a Saturday afternoon and it wasn't packed at all, despite the parking lot being nearly full.  I would assume this was because the restaurant is located in front of International Mall and it is the holiday season.  We had the buffalo chicken deep dish pizza - it was very good.  Would definitely go back to try other brews and different food as well."
Luvenia V.,"Miami, FL",1,7,,1.0,8/25/2013,"We wanted to celebrate my husbands 43rd birthday so we chose BJ's Brewery; well bad choice; we sat there for 15 minutes and no one came to even say HELLO! Another table sat after us and they were taken care of, this is when we decided to get up and leave..:-( not good!!!"
Carla P.,"Homestead, FL",4,1,1,1.0,2/7/2013,"My family and I had the worst experience ever. The waitress took for ever,she had a nasty attitud,all of our steaks were raw...I mean not pink but bloody like if they just placed it in the grill for 20 seconds. We had to return the food to the kitchen,and only God knows what they did but by the time she brought it back we werent even hungry any more. The place is all about being curious to visit a new restaurant. Our experience was HORRIBLE,we will NEVER go back."
Priscilla B.,"Alexandria, VA",1,6,1,2.0,5/9/2014,Does BJ's close at 12AM or 1AM on Fridays? I went to the Doral location on Friday at 11:30PM and the hostess said they were closing at 12AM.
Dreiver D.,"Miami, FL",0,4,,1.0,6/24/2013,"Horrible hostess, very rude, extremely slow service- Food is not that good and overpriced- Went there to watch the Heat Final game- That was a mistake- Their TVs are too far from the middle tables- The sound sucks- They dont have that many TVs- And a couple were not working. This is place is BAD- go to Doral Alehouse, or Carolina Alehouse- Much better choices to get some food and watch a game."
Pepe D.,"Miami, FL",5,17,38,1.0,2/25/2013,"2/24/13***CAUTION****BEWARE ***Think before dining at this place..worst ever..we are regulars eating here and every time we go our experience gets worse...today was the icing on the cake...after waiting 30 min to be seated, we ordered our food waited another 30 min for food to arrive, server who brought food said he would be right back with silverware ...15 min goes by no waitress, no server, no silverware, finally we grabbed another waiter and asked for silverware, he found our waitress instead of just getting us silverware!!!!.To be told they where out of silverware??? By then our ""gourmet frozen tv dinner""  was COLD the manager came apologizing..are u kidding me, how am i supposed to eat my food???  He stated he would remove the food from the bill, no Einstein i want to eat my food...with silverware, not my hands...I'm not asking for handouts, unless u have silverware!!!don't waste your time...poor inexperienced servers and terrible management...alot of helpers and no help...considered yourself warned!!!"
Alex H.,"Miami, FL",99,29,2,2.0,10/3/2013,OK beers. Horrible food. Worst Chicken Limone Pasta I've ever had. Tasted like straight up lemon juice poured over the pasta. The avocado egg rolls where just that. Avocado filled and fried wontons. Whose stupid idea was that? Just bring an avocado and a spoon instead. I will say the waitress was nice and tried to please as much as she could. Poor girl. Go work for a better restaurant.
