Bob J.,"Miami, FL",20,42,23,1.0,1/29/2013,"Where to begin on my nightmare lunch. We were seated in 5 minutes as promised but then waited close to 20 minutes for one of the many members of staff and managers that walked passed us to acknowledge our existence. We ordered a soda, iced tea, beer and our food. Our salads came out first then the two soft drinks finally my beer when the salads were finished. When our mains came one dish that had chicken in it came with no chicken until we asked. The deep dish pizza I had, tasted worse than a Pizza Hut pizza, which is pretty sad. I really had my hopes up for the pizza. The sausage was cheap and so was their ""5 cheese"" blend. The crust was also really soggy and not crunchy as it should be. When we were only half way done with our food we were asked if we want dessert. We said no and I ordered another beer. A while later our check arrived at the table and then my second beer. I am not one to complain when I dine out and I hate to give bad reviews but eating lunch here was bad experiences stacked on top of each other without the staff even acknowledging the massive mistakes and bad service. I have eaten at other BJ's and had good experiences but this one was just awful."
Cristy S.,"Miami, FL",22,13,43,1.0,4/21/2013,Coming here I wasn't expecting anything amazing but I wasn't expecting to be completely disappointed and leave hungry. Food was below average . I ordered the BBQ Chicken Deep Dish Pizza and it wasn't a deep dish at all and you could barely taste any BBQ. It tasted just like a Pizza Hut pizza with some dry chicken and some tomato sprinkled on top. Took 2 bites and couldn't eat the rest. My husband ordered the Chicken Alfredo which he had sent back b/c the chicken was so dry and the pasta was cold and looked like it had been sitting on the window for quite a while. We definitely wont be coming here again. $90 bill on crappy food. What a waste!
Rickie G.,"Homestead, FL",15,133,10,4.0,8/23/2013,"Went here just as they opened with a group of 26, without calling ahead.  Didn't mean to do that, it was an impromptu lunch b-day lunch.  The waiter was awesome and the manager, I think she was at least, helped out a lot to take care of all of us.  The food was pretty good, no one returned a plate or mumbled a complaint.  Upon finishing there was no rush by staff to kick us out even thought the place was getting packed with the normal Doral lunch rush.  Will be back again, but just a table for four please."
Lulu P.,"Beverly Hills, CA",8,105,8,1.0,6/5/2013,"Sunday, 3:30pm, lunch date.  #1 crowded, loud, and very dirty.  Even the floor outside was dirty.  Waitress was nice, but disappeared in the middle of the meal and never returned to check on us.  When we asked for the check, someone else brought it. If there was a shift change, we should have been told.  The beer:  too generic tasting, not a true brewhouse.  The food:  boneless wings were good, scampi pasta was absolutely HORRIBLE.  I have never tasted pasta that bad, and it is hard to get pasta wrong.  The pizza was decent. The cider: refreshing taste, no bite to it. We didn't try the dessert.  Thought this place was a bit over priced too.  Our bill was what we would normally spend if we had brought our 2 kids with us.  Don't think we will be returning.  Why is this a shame?  It is a shame because they have a prime location and they could really have made it better.  And also because they donate proceeds of the desserts to a very worthy cause. Sorry...hope the manager reads it so they can get it right."
E J.,"Miami, FL",12,98,59,1.0,4/10/2013,"It's unfortunate to say that although the food was alright (nothing out of this world, but that's okay, it's just a brewery) the costumer service was HORRIBLE. It took 20 minutes just to get silver wear after the salad arrived; which we were unable to eat until we had forks. Then they forgot the rest of our food, which were only appetizers for their happy hour special. 45 minutes later they send our appetizers to the wrong table, then they take it back after the wrong table touches it and try and serve it to us. We were appalled. After speaking with the manager he apologizes and proceeds to make us new appetizers which still get taken to the wrong table. Complete incompetence working at this restaurant. Finally we get our food after over an hour and only get a half off discount. Don't recommend it because of the service and wont come again. We were even here while the restaurant was less than half empty, so there are no excuses! My colleagues and I are usually very easy, but not when there is a huge lack of customer service here."
Erika C.,"Hialeah, FL",2,10,4,2.0,12/16/2013,"We decided to come here for dinner on a Sunday night to take a break from some Christmas shopping. We were seated right away. However, it took 20 minutes for them to take our order and then another hour for them to bring out our food. When the food arrived everything was cold and soggy. And then it took another 20 minutes for them to re-cook our food. The cold soggy pizza that was originally brought to us was then reheated and served as an appetizer."
Morgan C.,"Miami, FL",2,56,,1.0,12/11/2012,"Well I came in after hearing great things about this place and first of all the staff doesn't know the menu. They haven't even eaten all the food or tried any of it. I alsed the bartender for recommendations and she didn't have a clue. She recommended the bake potato and I mean what a disappointment . It's sauce , a very little small portion of sauce and , an even smaller portion of cheese on a potato the size of a 12 inch shoe. Wort food ever . They didn't even apologize or send a manager over . What a disappointment."
Katie W.,"Miami, FL",46,115,68,3.0,1/13/2013,"The first time I went to a BJ's Brewhouse was in North Florida, but it's a chain so they're all basically the same. Went to this location not to long ago hoping to get another glass of their seasonal Grand Cru. Unfortunately this location stopped selling it, but I know other ones up north still are so I'm not sure why this one stopped early. If you do end up in a location that is still selling it, try it! It's a delicious 10% APV Belgian beer. The food here is fine, nothing spectacular but satisfying. I had the buffalo chicken wontons at the N. Fl location and they were just okay, but their watermelon salad was very good, but I wish they'd put just a bit more watermelon in it. I tried some of my bf's pizza with bacon and chicken and it was actually pretty yummy. When I went to this location with my bf, I had the jalapeno burger and it was actually pretty good, but no where near as spicy as I thought it would be. Overall, this is a pretty decent place for some satisfying food and a good pint of beer."
Danny L.,"Miami, FL",127,15,3,4.0,5/14/2013,Good food . I liked the dark sports bar atmosphere.  The house beer isnt all that much to brag about but worth a try if its your first time .
Kathryn E.,"Hialeah, FL",1,17,1,1.0,9/18/2013,"I've given this location three shots. The first time our service was great, our waiter offered us free dessert if we gave our email for their membership club but our food wasn't so great. I had gotten the cheese deep dish pizza and my boyfriend got one of their burgers. The burger was bland and the deep dish pizza was even worse. We ordered the potato skins which were awesome and we got a pizookie and a beignet and those were good too.  The second time we went in a bigger group and order chicken tenders, potato skins, calamari, and other appetizers. Our waitress this time asked if we weren't ordering too much food. I've never gone to a restaurant and was asked that. This last time was last night. We told each other this will be our last time if it isn't good and everything sucked. The service was okay but our food once again was for the price, no good. I got a strawberry pina colada and that was even bad. Never again."
William M.,"Miami, FL",3,27,,4.0,10/31/2012,"Good food. Awesome place to watch a sporting event at the bar, or just to go eat dinner. They brew their own beers and have good specials."
