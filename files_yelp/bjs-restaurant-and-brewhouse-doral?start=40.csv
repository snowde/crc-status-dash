Samuel H.,"Riviera Beach, FL",1,25,11,4.0,6/25/2017,"So we come here usually every week and sometimes twice a week. It's a great place, awesome food, decent prices and great service. Unfortunately today the hostess completely blew it. We told her party of 7, six adults with one child. She put us in a six-person booth. With 7 people. Her explanation was she would put the extra chair at the end of the table. Let me just add something here guys: it was 1145am in a nearly empty restaurant. So now we have six of us cramped into a booth, and one adult at the end of the table in a chair because the child sits between mom & dad. I love this restaurant, but the inexperience and lack of training of this hostess just made this a waste of my time. Please correct it. The hostess either needs to ask if a six-person booth is ok for 7 people or make a better decision to put a 7-person party at a larger booth/table. Thanks."
Michelle S.,"Miami, FL",70,35,6,5.0,3/1/2017,"I've since gone back countless times and to my surprise, the service has been friendly and welcoming. They've really upped their training game, or maybe I'm coming in during slower times. Either way, I'm happy. Swing by for great service!"
Moe P.,"Miami, FL",127,157,1858,4.0,4/20/2016,Was seated fast  Its not only 420 but also hump day. I dont want cook wednesday. Plus a heat game. The food was delicious and fast.  I recommend and will be back
Amy L.,"Homestead, FL",2,65,56,5.0,10/10/2016,Nino is an excellent and sweet host! Gheency is a good server!! Their Mediterranean and Spicy Hawaiian pizzas are both delicious! We had the Brewnette and Stout and both were fabulous!!
Vanessa G.,"Miami, FL",29,32,21,3.0,8/15/2016,The last time I had dined at BJ's was over 6 years ago. I have been wanting to come back here for a while so we decided to come dine Saturday night. I left with mix feelings. First the positives: I really like the fact that you can do call ahead seating. You could even order ahead! Once we arrived we were seated right away. I really liked the atmosphere of the restaurant. The food was delicious! We ordered the fried calamari and the baked avocado egg rolls. The avocado egg rolls won my vote! They come with a soy sauce but taste much better with ranch. For our entree my husband ordered the full rack of ribs. The meat fell right off the bones! He loved it! I ordered their Gourmet five meat deep dish pizza. It was soooo good! I ordered the small size which was more than enough. I shared and even left a slice. Four our daughter we ordered the chicken tenders with fries. I feel like it was a very good portion for children and it was not expensive. She enjoyed it. For dessert I ordered the Triple Chocolate Pizookie made with Ghirardelli. OMG... absolutely mouth watering! A must try!  Now for the negatives:  The service was not so great. We arrived at 8:30pm and left at 10:30pm. Not by choice. The service was very very slow. It took the waiter over 15 mins just to bring drinks to the table. Once he brought them he quickly disappeared again. We waited another 15 mins for him to show up to order appetizers and our dinner. That's just 30 mins in waiting for drinks and to order food. Not off to a good start. The appetizers came in like 20 mins then we waited another 20 mins for the food. The worst part was the wait for the dessert. 30 mins. I was about to pay and leave. Glad I didn't though because it was delicious! Once the dessert came he didn't even give my husband a chance to speak. He left and came back in 15 mins. Well he really didn't come back my husband had to hunt him down just to receive the check. The food is pretty pricey. So I expected better service for what I was paying for.  If it weren't for how good the food & drinks were this place would have received 1 star. Step up your service game!
Ale D.,"Miami, FL",7,11,,2.0,5/22/2017,"Have to admit that when I arrived my expectations were high because I attended one BJ's at the falls mall and ate and excellent calamari, but this time was not the same, no tasty, flavorless, not even salt, very disappointed this time!"
Coralin Z.,"Miami, FL",0,12,16,5.0,4/14/2017,"Where do I begin! I eat out all the time but I can't remember the last time I had service as great as this. My server was Michael and he was amazing. He was so attentive and courteous and just generally an awesome server. On top of that the busser, Manolo, was really awesome too! Very sweet and so accommodating. I'm definitely coming back several more times! Thanks for a great time :)"
Azais C.,"Miami, FL",128,89,77,4.0,10/21/2015,"Bjs has pretty decent beers and tons of happy hour specials for both food and drinks. Granted, if you have dietary restrictions (vegan), it's less than ideal, but the kitchen was willing to work with you. I ordered a vegetarian flatbread pesto pizza without cheese that was absolutely delicious. Also, try the guacamole and pair it with their Harvest Hefeweizen; you won't be disappointed.  Peak hours are Friday and Saturday night. It's like a South Beach night club in there with lines running back to the parking lot, so be patient."
Judith M.,"Davie, FL",19,71,92,4.0,12/11/2016,"BJ's has a pretty good variety of beer and cocktails.  The waiter we had was extremely knowledgeable. Food came quick and was delicious. This is a step up to other sports bars as you don't get the roust crowd you get in other bars. It's spacious, clean, big selection of food and drinks, and lots of TVs."
Jorge B.,"Miami, FL",53,105,422,5.0,11/1/2014,This is one of my favorite places right now. Here are a few items why:  Great selection of drinks/ beers  Great selection of appetizers.  Good ones  Great selection of pizza. Four types  Have a smart phone app and it's great to use  Offer reward program for their customers  Friendly staff  Great atmosphere  Great location  Awesome bar  You can sample the beers for free  You can seat inside/outside and watch sports  Their sirloin steak is AWESOME
Alexandre H.,"Miami, FL",255,253,121,5.0,5/16/2016,"I came here 3 times after my last review, and I'm happy to report that BJ's is doing a great job. Our food was very good and service was really outstanding, what a change from 4 months ago! Kudos to all the staff. Thanks to our waiter Christopher too, you did a great job tonight. Cheers!"
Mayra R.,"Miami, FL",41,8,,3.0,8/19/2017,"Food was good.  Not overly impressed with cleanliness it smelled ""musty and damp"".  Our waiter was not attentive we had to ask for refills for our tea and then came back with tea and no ice.  Don't think I'm coming back any time soon."
Rafael S.,"Miami, FL",19,138,55,2.0,1/28/2017,"Perhaps the Beer... Food is low quality and taste is questionable. Asked for a lemonade that was not good. Service although friendly is not efficient. Hostess was a pro, but that's it. First time and last..."
Mario A.,"Miami, FL",3,7,7,3.0,9/9/2016,"Good food , great beer ,  chicken tortilla soup has always been my favorite dish ...."
Katrina A.,"Homestead, FL",0,12,5,1.0,3/26/2017,"Only gave this location 1 star because my boyfriends burger was delicious. My salmon & rice pilaf on the other hand was room temperature- not hot or ""fresh"" tasting at all. Tasted and looked  more like something that was taken out of the microwave. Service was EXTREMELY SLOW. I didn't even re order an entree cause it wouldn't have gotten to me in time. I wouldn't come back or recommend this location."
Yvelin R.,"Miami, FL",1295,413,2255,4.0,7/2/2015,"Good food, competitive prices, ok service (never outstanding and sometimes very slow) and usually busy regardless of time. Place is quite big and I like the look and feel of it. Nice selection of beers and menu items. Their lunch specials don't disappoint. I'm not big on sweets, yet I can't leave without have a pazookie (yummy)."
MICHELLE C.,"Plantation, FL",2316,2081,4444,4.0,6/13/2014,"When we are in the area we so enjoy coming here.  The restaurant has a very large dining area, big bar area and a lovely outside terrace.  I have never seen a restaurant that knows how to seat guest so quickly.  They have this down pat with super gracious hostess.  After several visits to both locations I wish we had one in my neighborhood. The menu reminds me of the Cheesecake Factory, it is very large with so many great options. You want pizza, steak, sandwiches, salads, apps, yes I am sure you can find something. The beer selection is fantastic and they offer some nice cocktails and drinkable wine. The avocado rolls are delicious and so are the stuffed mushrooms. My daughter ordered a Sirloin steak, and I chose a single deep dish pizza.  Her steak was very good.  This is the second time I have had their deep dish pizza and I so enjoy it.  The dough is delicious, plenty of cheese and ingredients in a  light sauce, which I prefer. Sure this is not Chicago deep dish pizza but hey I am not complaining, this pizza is awesome! Service is fab, prices are reasonable, very fun atmosphere, and I really enjoy their food here.  The beer flights are a great way to try several beers.  They have a good happy hour at the bar with drink and food specials. Fun place!!"
Janelle G.,"Medley, FL",123,21,7,5.0,2/19/2017,"The baby back ribs are to die for! It has this sweet barbecue sauce that is so good! And the jambalaya is pretty spicy but so worth it. The desserts as well are amazing. They just added this monkey bread dessert, and its super yummy!"
Isabel S.,"Doral, FL",0,1,,5.0,3/12/2017,"Great environment, drinks are amazing and food is great! Try the Alabama sunset and the BBQ salmon! :)"
Tanya B.,"Homestead, FL",35,44,25,5.0,1/1/2016,"As usual, BJ's Brewhouse does amazing!!! This visit was a little different though!! Christine and Bianca (hostess and manager) had to wait the table because of two big parties that were previously seated. The service was infallible. I found out later that Bianca was waiting multiple tables for the same reason and she's a manager!! At the end of the day, we were never in need of anything. Our food came out perfectly and our drinks were never empty for long. This is my first trip to the Doral location and now I love both locations.  Food wise: I had the Shrimp Alfredo (listed as chicken but I subbed shrimp). Sauce was seasoned and thick enough. I had enough shrimp that I ate some during the meal and still had some to take home. Bianca also gave me another garlic roll!! (Score!!!!)  I love with BJ's Brewhouse!!!"
