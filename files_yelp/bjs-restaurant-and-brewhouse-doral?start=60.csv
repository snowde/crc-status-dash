Melissa H.,"Hialeah, FL",141,44,15,3.0,1/2/2017,"Came in to BJs to use a gift card that was gifted to me. I came in thinking l wasn't going to have much selection since im trying to eat on the healthier side, but I was pleasantly surprised. As an appetizer I split lettuce wrap tacos, and had a delicious salad (The Santa Fe)."
Valerie C.,"Miami, FL",62,6,11,5.0,9/6/2016,I've came here multiple times and they never disappoint. The dining room is huge and nicely decorated. Music volume and temperature is always appropriate and the service is always courteous and friendly. My boyfriend and I were greeted by an outgoing curly haired hostess and even went over the specials and made sure we were comfortable before she left. Our server was Manuel And he checked on us often and make sure every aspect of our experience was perfect. And we saw a male manager and a busser walking around the dining room. The Parmesan chicken and the loaded burger was delicious. The server forgot my tomato mozzarella salad but he brought one within 2 minutes- best server we've had by far. Thank you BJs and keep the momentum going. Will be back soon :)
Patricia M.,"Miami, FL",6,114,84,4.0,12/20/2016,Good Service. The food is good. I haven't had anything to knock my socks off yet. It's a nice sports place to go and watch a game and have drinks with friends.  It's good for large parties and family dinners.
Barbara B.,"Hollywood, FL",0,6,7,4.0,8/8/2016,"Great food, friendly servers. Nice atmosphere. Clean bathroom. This is one of the few restaurants in the US where I've been to where they use salt sparingly. Really pleasantly surprised. The wings were great, the ahi appetizer was amazing. The mozzarella sticks not to salty, just right. The chicken Alfredo was excellent. The shrimp and asparagus pasta was oke, too many hard asparagus stems.  The desert triple chocolate cookie and ice cream was absolutely delicious."
Marcos B.,"Miami, FL",0,30,33,3.0,4/2/2016,The place looks great but we decided to go on Easter Sunday and they did not have staff on hand and they took a long time to take our order. We where a group of 14 and when we where served our meal they forgot two of our orders and two of our friends   left without eating. Like I said nice looking place but staff was overwhelmed.
Annette N.,"Miami, FL",4,3,3,1.0,1/26/2017,The worst place ever.  The service was terrible.  Waited 30 minutes to get served after being told it would  be 10 to 12 minutes and after waiting 30 minutes were to it would take much longer and inky order salads.  I DO NOT recommend anyone to go to this place.
Jacqueline M.,"Miami, FL",701,301,6217,4.0,5/2/2014,"BJ's is like a Cheesecake Factory menu but with a brewery feeling to it. I've been several times and always find myself conflicted over what to order. The menu is quite large not only for beers and cocktails but also for meals.  This particular location is located right by the International Mall. First time I dropped in was for happy hour and most recently went in for lunch. My server ""Diana"" happened to remember me from about a year ago!...ummm....not sure if that's a good thing since I don't remember acting up on the first visit, but needless to say, she's Awesome! We told her we were pressed for time so things needed to be a bit speedy and thankfully this was not a problem. They have a few good lunch specials. I ordered the southern fried chicken and mashed potatoes since I was really craving that comfort food. Diana made suggestions, was funny, quick and really on her food game. I remembered her service on my prior visit and she hadn't lost that pep which was nice. Food came out quickly, was a good portion and I had no complaints but the best part for me always has got to be their pizzookie! Pizzookie ordered was half white chocolate macadamia and half chocolate chip. It comes out in like a mini cast iron- warm and delicious with two scoops of vanilla ice-cream. It is by far my faaaaavorite dessert for a restaurant in this category.  Super happy with pizzooookie, my food and my server Diana!"
Krys P.,"Miami, FL",301,935,2833,4.0,3/22/2015,"This review is for their beer dinner, which they host once a quarter at some of their locations. I've tried BJ's at other locations, and while the food is not bad, neither is it outstanding.  However, when Yelp posted about they a beer dinner featuring Rogue Brewery beer, at a reasonable price of $30, I figure it's worth trying.   The dinner offers a tasting of 5 Rogue beers and 2 of BJ's own brew, through a four course dinner.  The flatbread pizza is quite delicious but the cajun chicken pasta has mushy noodles.  Dessert is their famous Pizooki, which is a cookie a la mode.   The event is quite well prepared, with powerpoint giving info about the Rogue Brewery and their beers.  There are trivia questions to help engaging the diners and providing conversation starter (strangers are seated family style at big tables.)  Service is very good - the guy pouring the beer really knows about the stuff, and when one lady didn't like her pasta, they offered her a different entree at no charge. They are very generous with their pour, and don't mind pouring seconds (though i can't even finish my share!) Will most certainly keep an eye out for their next beer dinner.  It does sell out at some locations, so do call ahead to RSVP."
Jacqueline A.,"Miami, FL",0,10,8,1.0,7/11/2016,"Bad service. Went for lunch with my kids - usually we go for dinner and it's always awesome. This time was really bad - not sure if the waiter was new or what , we sat for 10 minutes before anyone came to the table , food was equally bad. My son ordered sliders, he brought them with no cheese , and no fries.  I had to ask for the fries that should have come with and also ask for cheese , he an attitude about it. I didn't leave a tip which I hate doing and haven't been back since. I refuse to spend $60-$100 for bad service."
Nikki A.,"Miami, FL",10,4,,1.0,6/8/2017,"My experience at BJs today was unbelievable. I am a regular customer and what happened to me today (and to many others I'm sure) is ridiculous. I ordered my lunch between 10:45AM and 11AM to pick up at 12PM. I arrive on time, and there is no one ""available"" to assist me. There were three young ladies gossiping at the hostess area, and none of them even attempted to ask if I needed help. There was a gentleman that looked like he was off the clock that headed towards the back to tell someone I was waiting. I waited about 5 minutes, but keep in mind that I'm on my lunch break .. every minute counts especially since I have to drive to pick it up. She approaches me giggling, and tells me "" we have no wifi."" I look at her confused, asked her what does that have to do with my order ? She told me that they will not receive any orders online and that my order technically was never placed. This young lady didn't even offer me a solution or even apologize for the inconvenience. I received a confirmation notice, but if the location wasn't accepting orders there should've been a message on the website. I wasted 30 minutes of my break going to this restaurant to not EVEN EAT. My break is only an hour and I had to figure out what to eat with the time I had left. I am furious with the unprofessionalism that was displayed at this location. Never AGAIN."
Grace B.,"Washington, DC",170,122,437,4.0,5/22/2015,We took mommy here for Mother's Day; this was my second time. I was famished and I left the food took forever to get to our table. The waiter recommend delicious drinks but I wasn't feel that we'll so I can't comment on the food. my mom had the salmon and she was in love.
Keri D.,"Long Island, NY",958,148,583,4.0,1/10/2015,I'm surprised this location is new reviewed higher. On a business trip I stopped here for dinner with a coworker. We had a flight of the house beers. All were good. The Ahi avocado appetizer was well worth the price for the amount of tuna you get.
Carolina G.,"Miami, FL",0,1,,1.0,6/9/2017,"Terrible food , horrible customer service. I threw up all my food don't come here please save your money"
Ingemann N.,"Manhattan, NY",13,129,13,4.0,9/18/2016,"This was an accidental visit as we needed to stop on our way to the Keys.  The food was good and fresh, the service was friendly, and the beer was good (my wife was driving). Only complaint would be the space is big with bad acoustic.  This is the 2nd BJ I have been to and so far the quality has been consistent."
Joann S.,"Miami, FL",145,102,93,3.0,1/8/2016,"I've been to BJ's exactly 3 times. Once in San Diego, CA on a date night. And twice in Miami, FLz for a birthday party and another for a lunch date. Unfortunately, I wasn't too impressed either time. I'm not a big beer person so I cannot comment much on that end. But my food selections were a bit spicy for my taste. The dessert wasn't anything out of this world and I am a huge dessert person so that was a little unexpected since I see this place is always so packed. Good things are that service has been great all times and parking is always available. The waits are never too long and they allow you to bring in a cake for birthday parties. They allow RSVP's so for a person who loves to plan ahead it's perfect for me. I hope their menus in the future get a little better."
Hildy n.,"Miami, FL",18,4,,5.0,10/2/2016,Excellent service and got to eat gluten free pizza. Gluten free beer is also available. Will definitely be back.
Julia E.,"Sarasota, FL",0,31,3,3.0,4/23/2017,"I debated giving this place only two stars but I really think we just came on a bad night. Our waiter was very young and very eager, also very polite. He was not in a hurry and had a poor memory, he did at least continually apologize for not refilling drinks in a timely fashion etc. the prices were decent. The floors were very slippery so not a great place for flip flops or heels, think tennis shoes. The ambience was nice enough but it was very loud which was surprising because there wasn't very many people there. As far as the food goes, everything was acceptable. Nothing was amazing but chain restaurant quality food (compare to Applebee's). I ordered a bowl of soup which didn't get brought to the table, when I asked for it they said they had already put the soups away for the night (even though they had 2 more hours before they were closing), and that I'd have to wait a minute. I said fin. Then when they brought the soup the edges were hard and burnt, it was clear they had heated it in the microwave without even stopping to stir it up one time or clean up the disgusting burnt edge of the bowl. I was pretty disappointed."
Johanna e.,"Miami, FL",83,10,6,5.0,9/8/2016,"Pizookie!!!!!! Gotta have  dessert! This place is so much fun, food is great, ambiance is always on point! AND they donate proceeds to non for profits!"
Daniel R.,"Miami, FL",22,334,104,3.0,1/24/2016,"Bj's Brewhouse is a good choice for casual dining.  I found the food to be above average but I can only rate vegetarian options.  The ice tea needs help right now, it doesn't stand out and I feel (since I have been here a few times) that it doesn't keep a level of consistency.  Just like the name implies it also has a bar area.  Traffic at this place can vary, I would avoid it during the Friday night to Saturday night time range unless you are willing to do a line.  My waiter was attentive but we found that the amount of time to bring food out was a touch on the slow side.  Desserts are way too sugary for my taste.  Pizza and burgers are the dominating choices here.  Portions are generous and the prices are reasonable.  It reminds me of Cheesecake Factory.  The menu is just as large.  If you want a non-pretentious choice this will fit the bill nicely."
