Nicole Q.,"Doral, FL",194,3,1,5.0,10/8/2016,"Best beers and happy hour deals. Waitress Christina is a lovely person and took care of us really well, excellent service!"
Carlos D.,"Miami, FL",1,33,41,4.0,9/4/2016,"The service was good, the food was good it's a glorified bar with glorified bar food I mean what more can you expect BUT for the most part me and my boyfriend had a good time best sports bar we been too so far....."
Jacquie N.,"Miami, FL",170,306,484,4.0,7/29/2015,"Good place to stop for lunch. Especially when I need a few minutes to chill out.  Trying the shrimp tacos today along with their house HopStorm IPA.  I prefer to pony up to the bar, as I'm often solo in this part of Miami. Have always felt welcomed, even when they are jamming."
Terry F.,"Miami, FL",0,2,,4.0,4/1/2017,"The wifey and I were staying in Doral and we had a hankering for a good burger. Wasn't sure about this place but decided to go based on some of the positive reviews that we saw on yelp. We arrived around 5:45pm on a Saturday and were seated immediately. The place is very spacious and looks good for a burger and beer joint. Lots of choices to eat and drink. They have a huge selection of craft beers and the menu has everything. My wife had the bacon guacamole deluxe burger, and I had the hickory brisket and bacon burger. Man.... they were both very tasty. I love the hickory flavored BBQ sauce that flavored my burger and my wife loved the kick that the jalapeños and pepper jack cheese gave her taste buds. Both burgers came with a ton of crispy fries. That and a couple of good craft beers to wash them down. Service was on point and and very quick. Burgers were on the table within 15 mins of us sitting at our booth. Only complaint I had was that I felt that the place was a bit too dim for me. Other than that..... when your in Doral and you want a place to eat a great burger and drink a few brews and watch a game .... then this is a good choice."
Lexi V.,"Miami Beach, FL",19,4,1,4.0,9/16/2016,"Food was great, waiter was great! Only reason I'm giving four stars is because the hostesses were extremely rude. I complimented one of them saying I like their shoes and she responded with yea. But the waiter was really great. Brian was awesome!!! Positive attitude and very nice guy! Definitely I get him when I come back!"
Cesar L.,"Charleston, SC",87,304,305,1.0,11/3/2014,"Here we go visiting BJs again forced by the family. Again, same issues as last time, although things seemed to be worse. It was Sunday and the place was not completely full, yet we had to wait 20 minutes to be seated. We noticed many empty tables outside, which we initially requested.  Got an outstanding service by Anthony ""Tony"", although things not always worked his way. We asked for hot sauce with the boneless wings and it finally arrived after we finished the appetizers. The salmon and the chicken fettuccine were actually tasty. So why one star???, this place is not remotely what it was months ago. I believe the biggest problem they have is a lack of leadership. They have a large group of youngsters and nobody clearly in charge. I'll do my best not to return."
Carl-Frederick F.,"Miami, FL",292,173,165,2.0,10/12/2015,"Honestly ...if it wasn't for the beer and the good waitress ,this place would have gotten 1 star.I've been to other Bjs .the pizookie is a hit but I just tried the so called 'deep dish pizza ' and I must say its a disgrace to pizza and the word deep dish.Felt like I was eating a slightly worst version of pizza hut .For that price and that restaurant's reputation I had higher   only advice Change the pizza menu to just pizza and get rid of the deep dish ,making Chicago look bad.good beer though."
Lissette L.,"Miami, FL",13,27,68,3.0,7/8/2016,"Located in the Doral area within minutes from MIA airport. This is a great place for beers and appetizers. They have happy hour specials until 7 pm and again from 10 pm until closing except Fridays and Saturdays. Tuesday is half price mojitos and martinis. The bbq wings are rich in flavor and the lettuce wrap is ok. If you enjoy desserts, I recommend the pazzoki, a warm chocolate chip cookie topped with vanilla ice cream! Our waiter was friendly but did not know the happy hour schedule and charged us full price! Not a good customer service"
Katy S.,"Chicago, IL",486,333,383,4.0,1/10/2013,"So I didn't eat anything but dessert here so my review is based solely on that and DRINKS!  ~The ""pizookie"" is seriously orgasmic. I had the white chocolate one and it was great. We actually ordered the sample one which came with three different pizookie's which was perfect for our party since there was three of us. I tried both other pizookie's (red velvet & chocolate) and both were good as well.   ~As for drinks... I wasn't going to come to a brewhouse and not try their beers. I like light, refreshing beers (i.e. corona, sea dog, miller, dos equis, etc) so I asked the server which one of their signature BJ's beers she recommended me to try. She recommended the LightSwitch Lager,Brewhouse Blonde, Harvest Hefeweizen, and the BJ's Jeremiah Red. For me, the winner was the Red and coming up to close second was the LightSwitch Lager! Suprisingly tasty beers at a reasonable price (btw...we had gone for happy hour). ~My friend had a mojito and she said she really liked it.  ~The appearance of the restaurant is welcoming. Very big, clean, and the bar is gorgeous.  Overall, I really like this place and WILL be returning, especially for happy hour. Plus I can't help myself to chuckle every time I say the restaurant's name ... me and my dirty mind :/"
Lacey C.,"Columbia, SC",335,556,173,4.0,12/28/2012,"I will say this--I did not know what to expect from this place. I mean, it's a brewery--but it's a CHAIN.  Like, corporate, like run by The Man.  But I will say this new (summer 2012) addition to Doral is not too shabby.  Sure, some of the beer stands out (the Belgian-style Camaraderie) while other plays back-up (the ho-hum pils), but none of the food I have ordered disappointed me.  And they have a great patio.  And Doral has a major MAJOR shortage of decent patio dining. Try the beer sampler (great value) or the addictive deep-fried artichokes with lemon aioli.  I also love they have ""snack size"" appetizer plates.  Perfect!"
Idy V.,"Miami, FL",1,9,15,4.0,9/12/2014,"My husband and I decided to try BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse because we saw it get build and were curious. When we arrived we noticed everything was clean and the restaurant itself looked nice. Our wait to be seated was about 10-15 minutes. When we sat, we ordered the chicken won-ton and caprese salad as appetizers. The won-tons were delicious, the caprice salad was ok, For entrees we ordered a pepperoni pizza, it was very thick and the flavor? Great. We also ordered the BJ's Classic Rib-Eye 14 oz with mash potatoes. 14oz? More like 6oz, or at least that is what it seemed like. The mash potatoes were delicious, we actually ordered more. The waitress was ok, she took our order pretty fast, but we had to wait about 30 minutes for our food. We then ordered our desserts and this is what really took our time, we ordered the pizookie trio because we wanted to have a taste of different desserts, (White Chocolate Macadamia Nut,  Cookies 'n' Cream, Triple Chocolate made with Ghirardelli) after the 30-40 minute wait, our order came, and it came wrong, we were given two white chocolate macadamia nut, and one no cookies 'n' cream, no triple chocolate made with ghirardelli, we informed the waitress, and she brought out the correct one, and let us keep the wrong item at no additional charge (30 minutes later) At this point, we just asked for our check, because we were going to be late to our movie. To sum it up, service was too slow, the pizza was great (they're known for their pizzas), the steak? I've had better, and the desserts were really good."
Sebastian B.,"Miami, FL",300,1,,5.0,8/28/2016,"On Saturday I attended a birthday dinner around 9pm. Birthday dinners sound chaotic enough especially since this was a huge one with 21 attendees. We were attended by 2-3 different servers and I got Christina E since I was placed around the end of the table. Right away she was already recommending drinks since I had the menu open. Very attentive she recommended the 'Tickled Pink' drink from what I told her I like. (I like strong fruity drinks). It was absolutely refreshing and delicious. I ended up ordering what I always do, chicken flat bread. Honestly the best appetizer BJ's has on the menu. Always prepped to perfection with it being nice and crispy. Christina brought it right away and with a second drink I had ordered. These are the type of servers all restaurants need. Was able to split the bill at the end perfectly and cleaned up asap. I am very impressed and will be returning soon!"
Gabriel R.,"Miami, FL",219,3,,1.0,8/26/2016,"IF I COULD I WOULD GIVE THIS FACILITY NEGATIVE 5 stars Terrible service.....we went to celebrate two of our friends birthday. We had two servers and my server quickly got our drink order and asked if we wanted any appetizers. I ordered a water and the spinach dip. Waited 45 minutes for my dip. The other side received their drinks and their appetizers after the order 10 minutes after me. Then I had to ask for my dip and the waitress (Christina E.) thought it was brought out. Then we ordered the entrees. I ordered a salad and the California club flatbread. Salad came out fine. I waited an hour and half for my flatbread and nothing. When I asked Christina, she was somewhat indifferent in her response to that it hadn't come out. Mind you she never came by to see how we were doing or if we needed anything. She came back and told me that my flatbread was taken to another table. I asked to speak with a manager. The manager came by 15 minutes later. I told him the situation and was told that I wouldn't have to pay for either the dip or the flatbread. When the check arrived the salad which was a side salad ended up being $4.05. ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING?!?! For a salad that was the size of a normal side salad. NEVER, NEVER, NEVER COMING BACK!!!"
Shaawn A.,"New Orleans, LA",243,68,17,5.0,6/11/2016,Love coming here for the half off large pizzas on Monday special as well as swinging by for a Pizookie whenever I'm in the area.  The staff is friendly and fast.  I like coming to this location in the Miami area.
Janet R.,"Hialeah, FL",13,14,14,4.0,11/4/2015,"It was my 1st time at this restaurant, and I was provided with good service. The hostess and server were attentive and friendly. The place looked well kept. I wish I could give this place a full 5 stars, but I can't because of these two reasons: 1) The menu had too many items listed, which makes deciding on a meal overwhelming. I like simplicity. 2) I had a Bacon-Guacamole burger. It was good but it wasn't wow! I'm not sure if they're food specialties are burgers, but I would have to give it another shot. Overall, I would go back to try another item because judging them based on one plate isn't fair. I rate them 4 for now."
Stephànie G.,"Miami, FL",93,36,20,3.0,7/5/2016,"The servers/service could be a little better and more quick, I haven't had great expirience with that. The atmosphere and setting is nice, great selection of beers but the food is very expensive. I guess even though the food was good, it didn't match up with the slow servers we've gotten for the price we pay.. just pick up in that area and it'll seem all worth the price."
Sabina C.,"Miami, FL",0,10,,4.0,1/23/2016,"Great service, an amazing variety of food and drinks. However we were using the flashlights on our phones to read the menu, im sure the ambience they were going for was great, but if I cant even read my menu then somethings wrong. And when asked if we could lighten up the olace we kept getting passive responses like ""ill talk with the manager"" or ""of course, well work on that"".  While the variety of food offered is amazing, the quality is ""so-so"". The dios were cold, the baked ziti was 90% meat 10% pasta. But admittedly there were some great appetizers (pot stickers, avacado egg rolls)."
Gaby M.,"Miami, FL",30,26,,3.0,4/27/2016,"Food and atmosphere is nice but service needs improvement. Also their dishes and aroma need to add some hygiene. However, still fun place."
Rocio P.,"Miami, FL",60,76,,4.0,6/15/2015,"Nice place to grab lunch or have a fuzz free time, experiment with beer (hello, two color beer), colas and a few other fluids in between.  Their menu is LONG with options for every taste. We tried the brussel sprouts, fried calamari, mahi mahi tacos, cali sandwich and the beignet for dessert. Everything was good and definitely satisfied our hunger.  Service was on point.  This is no farm to table place (although technically...: I believe they brew their own beers?); this is an old school, all american chain restaurant, so pls keep in mind when sizing up your expectations. Yet, compared to others from its kind, they are definitely above average. Good eats!"
Carlos M.,"Miami, FL",13,92,136,4.0,8/31/2014,Great dessert but food was a bit salty! Live the ambiance is wonderful! Music and waiter are awesome  Enjoy and drink now be back to update!!
