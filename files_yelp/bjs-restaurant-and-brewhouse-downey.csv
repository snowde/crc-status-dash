Rayshawn W.,"Paramount, CA",820,560,2232,4.0,11/9/2017,"It's that time of year again where Pumpkin Spice reigns supreme and BJ's has jumped on the bandwagon.  This is my preferred location and still remains to be so. I've never had bad service here. I stopped in to catch a Dodgers game and to grab a couple of appetizers. Fried calamari and stuffed mushrooms are my go to but instead of calamari I went ahead and tried two flavors of wings I haven't prior. The Nashville Hot and Exxxxtra Hot Buffalo are decent but the original hot & spicy buffalo still remains my favorite of the sauces.  On to the Pumpkin Spice aka Spiced Pumpkin. BJ's has conjured up one crazy mix of a drink with Rumchata, Mount Gay Black Barrel Rum, BJ's Pumpkin Ale, and pumpkin puree. A bold mix like that deserved a try from myself. The result is a taste that's as crazy as it sounds lol. I couldn't pin point an individual flavor in taste except for the pumpkin. All others served to give an odd but somewhat strong flavor. Enough of it would probably knock you on your back haha.  The Dodgers took a loss that night but hey, the food and service was good as always. Just another chill night at the BJ's Downey location. Dinner 10/18/2017"
Jessica L.,"San Diego County, CA",187,11,17,1.0,12/19/2017,"I've been a loyal customer to BJs since they opened in Downey and I've really never left unsatisfied or felt like I had bad service. Today, I went to order take out and wanted to use my rewards points for $25 off. When I requested this, the cashier named GLORIA M asked me if she can see an email or proof showing that I had the points to be eligible for the discount. (I wasn't mad yet) But, BJs has the entire thing on their computer system and I never had been asked to look for an email or code online. They literally print out the total points FOR YOU. She insisted that I needed a code and made me look for my email and online account to show her proof I had the eligibility. During the entire thing, she kept giving me attitude and was being rude giving me looks and all. This was frustrating because after several minutes of trying and failing to find proof I had enough points, she just went to the manager and asked for help. The manager showed her how to redeem on the screen and EASY and DONE. What should've taken a minute to order took 10 minutes. Even till the end, she was like ""next time, you still need to show us the code to redeem your points""...there is NO code. It's not even over here... Once I got my food, I wasn't even surprised to see that I got chicken instead of the shrimp I ordered. When I took it to the counter, she insisted I ordered chicken. She faulted me when she got the order wrong....why did I have to be the one to blame for the wrong order? I had to wait another 15 minutes so that I could leave with my correct order.  Yes, not even funny but it's not over yet... She was also discriminating customers? While I was waiting for her second try at my order, I noticed that she offered other customers water while they wait...but she never offered or asked me neither the first or second time.  When my correct order came out, she didn't even bag my food for me. She just placed it on the counter after announcing that my order was out and I had to bag it myself. What place makes you bag your own food order, whether or not you use the same bag...?  Thank you Gloria M! Thanks to you I was able to stay at BJs for 40 minutes to delay my family dinner so that I can feed them with half cold and half warm food!  I've never ever felt so angry with customer service here or at ANY BJs ever. But this was just the worst... Really really really deserves 0 stars, but unfortunately I have to at least leave 1."
Silvia H.,"Anaheim, CA",2,12,12,2.0,11/6/2017,"I placed an order online for take out to be ready at 3:30pm. I was waiting in line to pick up my order but the cashier was on the phone for over 10 minutes and the other woman next to her simply said ""we will be right with you."" Thankfully a nice man jumped in and started to pack my order and help check my order out. I ordered a 2 flavor pizookie which was sad looking and after my 15 minute wait in their lobby and 2 minute drive back to work, my ice cream was melted.  My chicken tortilla soup should be called Tortilla Soup as there was 2 tiny pieces of chicken in it.  My ranch dipping sauce is unbelievably salty ... how do you get ranch wrong? Lastly, my fries.. how are some soggy and others undercooked? That is a hard inconsistency for fries.  Anywho, I had higher standards. That is all."
Jasmyne G.,"Carson, CA",3,64,204,4.0,12/26/2017,"I wanted a gooooood Cesar salad so I decided to come to Bjs in Downey. After shopping and finding all the after Christmas sales, Bjs was my first choice. Everything went great, fast seating and my salad and pizza came out pretty fast too. It wasn't crowded at all and my waiter was good and made sure I had all I needed. I was thinking about getting a pookie but I'm stuffed lol. The environment was great and not to loud. Parking on the other hand was horrible but the service on the inside made up for that. I've been to a few location but this one is by far the best."
Mannee G.,"Maywood, CA",1,15,5,4.0,1/8/2018,"Enjoy coming here to eat and have a couple of beers. There is a variety of food and they have there own beer, my favorite is the blonde.the monkey bread pizookie is also very good especially with vanilla ice cream."
Mark T.,"Los Angeles, CA",501,177,805,5.0,7/29/2017,"Came to this location randomly on a Friday night only because our first 3 choices of places to eat had an outstanding wait time. BJs is always a great choice when you're looking for great food, exceptional customer service, and an assortment of drinks, let's not forget they  have a nice selection of desert as well.   We were seated in 8 maybe 10 minutes tops. Our server Xochitl or however you spell it? So-she is the pronunciation I believe was perfect. She recommended a few items on the menu that we couldn't go wrong with choosing. Not only was she very personable, her level of service was astronomical in comparison to other locations I've been to.  Our food was freshly made, our drinks(non alcoholic) kept coming, and the pazooki was life."
Kathryn L.,"Whittier, CA",160,5,4,1.0,1/8/2018,"Disappointed in this place. It's my first time here, I'm in a group of 6. Me and my friend went to the ladies room only to come back to my half eaten food gone from the table. Not a good first impression."
Alexandra S.,"Montebello, CA",46,2,,1.0,12/27/2017,I wish I can give this restaurant a zero star rating. I waited 25 minutes to get seated and then another 25 minutes before I walked out. Within the 25 minutes I didn't have a waiter ask me if I wanted something to drink or if I needed more time to order.  Customer service here needs to be improved.
Edgar R.,"Norwalk, CA",261,3,1,5.0,12/27/2017,"I come here frequently and I love replace I love the food the drinks and especially the service teams. although I have had a handful of servers for multiple occasion Lupe made my experience today phenomenal! to go ahead and anticipate every single one of my needs is a very impressive skill and i have to give him 5 stars for that. I will always keep coming because of him for lunch, and as for the night crew I will always come back for that one server whose name I don't know how to spell but I'll try my best Ifeth. Thank you!"
Ben L.,"Long Beach, CA",855,313,3464,2.0,5/30/2017,"I came with a large group and was able to try many different appetizers, including the ahi poke, root beer glazed ribs, sampler platter, calamari, stuffed mushrooms, and buffalo wings. The apps were all right, the best being the ahi poke. It came with crispy chips to contrast the soft tuna. My experience overall was disappointing. Everyone in my party received their entree, and they brought me a top sirloin instead of the ribeye I ordered. By the time my ribeye came out most of my group was done eating, while I had just begun to eat. It really put a damper on the whole vibe. Unfortunately, that wasn't the worst part; the ribeye was awful. It must have been select or canner grade. It was tough, chewy, and low quality. I didn't expect a Mastro's quality steak, but c'mon, I can make a steak at home much better than that for $24. BJ's claims to age their steaks 28 days. I can guarantee this steak was no where near that level. Fortunately I had a tomato soup before the ribeye. It was all right, very tomatoey, and not too creamy. The beignet dessert tasted stale. It's like they served us an old one that had been made hours before and sat around. I probably won't be back, but if so I definitely will never order the ribeye here again."
C. Dyan C.,"Downey, CA",116,128,587,3.0,6/8/2017,"After years of excellent service and food, we have come into a night of issues.  We ordered pizza, steak, and ribs. The soup was cold, the Caesar salad had no dressing, and the croutons were stale.  My pizza crust was soggy and limp.  My son's steak was the size of a small burger.  My pizookie cookie was delicious. The one other time we had issues out of the perhaps 60 times we've been to the restaurant, we let the manager know that my prime rib was gray when I had ordered it rare. The manager explained that the oven knob got hit or turned by someone and that all of the prime rib was like that.  Since I had mentioned it to my waitress I thought that something should've been done about it. Other than giving an excuse that is. I should've refused to accept it and sent it back.  This is why we did not say anything to the manager last night."
Ricardo C.,"Downey, CA",1,40,80,2.0,11/28/2017,Came in for lunch with friend and family portions mediocre soup and salad. Had to ask for bread what you see in the picture is what I got. Let's see how the sirloin steak turns out.. well sirloin cut minuscule very good bake potatoe. But for the price. Don't waste your time and money. Had to ask for more bread place was almost empty
Omar A.,"Cerritos, CA",9,2,3,1.0,11/11/2017,To start. This is the first time coming to this location.  And most likely is gonna be my last.  We're regulars at the Cerritos location.    Our food was bad. The chips were reheated  and stale. our stuffed mushrooms looked hours old just reheated in the hot plate . Our spinach artichoke dip was cold.  Our food gave my wife a strong stomach ache.  The only highlight of our visit was our waitress (Cheyenne).   She was nice and helpful    But we honestly mostly likely will not becoming back.   The food was not good at all.   The pictures show my greasy and stale chips  the second picture shows what is suppose to be ours stuffed mushrooms
michele f.,"Long Beach, CA",55,24,12,2.0,10/25/2017,"The hostess was awesome and the food is great and a fair price.... Here is why I won't be back.  I went to lunch today as I often do and sat at the bar so as not to take up a table for two or four. After a reasonable wait, maybe 5 minutes I was acknowledged and my order was taken.  There were 5 people at the bar area in an area that seats roughly 15 people. There were three very lovely ladies sitting to my left  who where taking up a staff of three people. Great service. For them.  So I wait for my small pizza. (My $16 small pizza) 15 minutes, 20 minutes, 25 minutes. After 30 minutes I signal my bartender (who  was busy doing bartender stuff with the ladies) I had not heard from him since he set my place setting 1/2 hour prior.  I inquired as to the status  of my $16 small pizza.  Here is the thing. I realize the kitchen gets backed up.  I get it. I am in retail for God's sake. Things happen. But....to be ignored, for 1/2 hour without so much as a ""I will go check on your order"", ""it's will be just a few more minutes"", ""do you want another glass of wine"". Unacceptable..  Icing on the Pizza? I ate one quarter of the pizza and inquired about the check. Oh my credit card was charged in record time. But  I was not offered a ""to go"" container for the 3/4 of my remaining pizza. Maybe there is a minimum charge before BJ's offers you a ""to go"" container? There is a reason the word  ""Service"" is used in the Food Service Industry.  I spent a great deal of money over the years entertaining clients at BJ's at the Stonewood center.  No mas."
Rose B.,"Los Angeles, CA",52,478,1780,4.0,7/29/2017,"Not bad. BJ's Downey always makes me happy. I love the large bar area, lots of table's & lots of room. I'm so glad we ate her for dinner. Steven our server was great, he thought I was a kid tho & brought 3 kids menu's... I guess it's a good thing considering I'm an adult!  We ordered potato skin's, avocado's rolls, root beer wings, man those r bomb. But I don't eat meat anymore so I will just say order these you meat lovers.  I opted for veggie pizza. It was good. Esp for not wanting salad but other option. This so worked. I got the mini and only ate 3 out of 4 slices & I was stuffed.  Great service food was fresh and delicious for a fun Saturday. $$$  BJ's is always a good go to."
Stella P.,"Fullerton, CA",58,34,127,4.0,8/17/2017,"I got there around 1pm on Thursday. They were pretty busy.. about 10-15 min wait time. Since they are located in busy shopping center, finding a parking space was little challenging..  Great lunch special!! I liked their pick two menus..ex) you can get half sandwich with soup or salad & it was only 8.95? ( under $9)."
Raul P.,"Whittier, CA",1,26,2,5.0,12/26/2017,Great food and our waitress Angelica was amazing! This was our first time at this location and we really enjoyed it and highly recommend it!
Mary U.,"Pico Rivera, CA",79,3,,3.0,12/29/2017,"I'm thinking of sticking to the lazy dog after last night. Wrong drink order at the bar,took forget to take our order. The girls at the entrance should smile instead of mad dog"
Andrew P.,"Long Beach, CA",138,341,761,3.0,6/30/2017,"Came in last night with a friend to watch the Angels/Dodgers game in the bar area. Our original server (whose name we never got; he was a long-bearded guy with plugs in his ears) took a while to get to our table to get drinks. When he did take our drink orders, he took our food orders as well since we wanted to do some appetizers. We ordered 2 waters, an order of Buffalo wings, and a mini deep dish pepperoni pizza. Almost 15 minutes pass by, and no sign of our drinks. We couldn't really find our server anyways, and when we did see him, he would be talking to people (friends) that he clearly knew at the bar (he gave one of them a hug). Mind you, our server never asked if we wanted our wings drizzled or with the sauces in the side (every BJs I've ever been to, they've asked, except for last night). He never brought napkins or plates either for our food.  Our food came out moments later, and we had to ask the lady who brought it out about our drinks. She apologized and then Adrian (another server in the bar area) brought waters out for us.  We also bothered him for some extra ranch, napkins, peppers for the pizza, etc.  We felt bad, but we felt that our server was nonexistent and needed better service. Adrian quickly brought out our needed items and asked if we needed anything else. Eventually we saw him again, and flagged him down for a pitcher of beer. At this point, my friend and I asked Adrian if he could just take care of us instead since our other server was never around (again, could see him talking to one of his buddies). We explained to him that we would prefer him over the other dude since he wasn't taking great care of us and providing the proper service. Without a doubt, he made sure that he could take care of us, and did an amazing job.  He was always on it for the rest of our dining experience, and was super friendly. At the end of the night, he handed us our bill and told us that he took off/discounted some items from our bill due to the inconvenience and unfortunate service. He apologized and said that it definitely wasn't BJs' standards and he felt bad. Overall, Adrian was just super great and we were glad to have the pleasure of him serving us in replacement of the other guy. I don't know if it was maybe because we are two young adults who he (our first server) may have just assumed we weren't going to tip well, or maybe he wasn't a good server...... not sure, but jokes on him because we tipped Adrian over 20%."
Wei C.,"Los Angeles, CA",70,54,55,2.0,7/20/2017,"BJ is sometimes the restaurant that we go to when our mind is blanking about where to go eat. It's opened at 9 pm, it's really close by the house, it has some assortment and variety of food, and they have beer. The wait wasn't so bad, 20 minutes and they were going to text us when a table was available. About 30 minutes later we went in to ask about our table. They said that they were going to give us the table from a party who wasn't showing up. We went to sit down and I was shocked and angered that there were a lot of empty tables, especially for 2, in an area by the left hand side of the entrance. They literally had us waiting for a table when there were so many at their disposal!  I really wanted to speak to the manager. Maybe it was a building occupancy issue. But then why put more tables than you can sit? But I let it slide because it was a late dinner date.  We ordered our usual: California flatbread and the chicken tacos."
Jamie H.,"San Diego, CA",19,7,5,1.0,12/10/2017,"Service was horrible, our servers got switched out and then we were sitting alone waiting for someone to check on us. When speaking to the manager about our issues she just nodded and didn't do anything to help us or make the situation better. It seems like they don't care at all about customer service they just want people to eat and leave...."
Cecylu M.,"Whittier, CA",2,71,61,1.0,9/24/2017,First time here and last time here. Salad was premade. Chicken wings and clam chowder were good. Pasta with shrimp definitely not worth the price.  Kids pizza is not good. Olive garden would off been a better choice. And service is extremely sloooow. I do not recommend.
Cassandra M.,"Downey, CA",0,8,1,2.0,12/20/2017,"Food is OK, the young ladys are snobby and rude though. Especially the hostes. I will not be returning to this location again."
Armando M.,"Pico Rivera, CA",49,128,169,5.0,5/8/2017,"Weve been coming here for a few years now. We love their wings and their selection of beer! I've also tried different things like their spaggheti and meatballs. It was pretty damn good. The kids like the wings and their pazookies for desert. I recently had a very good experience with their staff. My wife left her iPhone 7 behind on the table. We went to the mall after dinner and she noticed after about an hour later that she left her phone. We went back and spoke to the manager there and told him what happened. He asked her a few questions and returned the phone. To be honest, I thought that phone was a gonner. Their employees are honest and I'm greatful for that. The staff is awesome here!"
Tony D.,"Huntington Park, CA",105,295,847,4.0,2/8/2017,Always enjoy going to BJ's Restaurants. Service has always been great for my family and I. Keep in mind I only come here when it's not that busy. I avoid crowds. Servers are always helpful and friendly. Although it seems they changed one of my favorite appetizers. I always get the ahi poke and the last time I ordered it it was prepared and served different. I hope it didn't change for good and maybe it was just a rookie cook. One can only hope. lol
Peter N.,"Pico Rivera, CA",12,24,18,5.0,11/22/2017,"Tonite we are changing up a bit, I'm having a Hickory burger with Applewood Bacon and fries My Wife is having a Sirloin with Bake Potato and Asparagus on the side. Both the dinners were different from our usual order but we have had good luck with food at Bjs. Looking forward to dinner."
Brandy M.,"Bell, CA",1,5,14,2.0,9/13/2017,"Wish I could have enjoyed my soup  I tried to eat it even though it seemed a whole lot ""oilier"" than usual. I gave myself a stomach ache. Sucks cause I enjoys their soup. Must of been a bad day for the Tomato Bisque!"
Angelica P.,"Downey, CA",44,1,,5.0,12/1/2017,"12/1 Big shout out to our waitress ""miriam"" she has great customer service, amaizing and positive attitude, and so helpful with the menu, she really knew the menu, very informative on deals of happy hour. Havent had service like this! food came out very quickly and was so good. every plate was delicious."
Hector P.,"Downey, CA",8,25,6,1.0,8/13/2017,Never had a problem with this restaurant but came in at 4pm and sat down with my family at the bar only to find out that there was only one server for ALL the tables. Don't blame the server just bad management. One server for 10+ tables is really bad! Whoever the manager is during this time (never saw one) should be trained a little better.
Lisette G.,"Downey, CA",31,14,13,1.0,9/25/2017,"So I came in for a birthday dinner celebration. My daughter chose this location to enjoy a nice family dinner. We ordered chips and guacamole which took a while to get. We order three top sirloin steak dinners ($23). All medium well. We received burnt steaks instead! Talk about to quality control. It amazes me that someone can serve these and think it's ok. They even smelled burned. Anyways, of course I asked for medium well steaks and sent these back. My granddaughter was too hungry to wait so she ate hers which was the less burnt of the three. Our waitress didn't bring out the steaks and promptly took the steaks back. Needless to say I'm very disappointed. The wait was just too long for my taste. Paying over $100 for a party of 5 with no alcohol, you should at least enjoy your meal. Sucks when half our table is finished eating and two of us are still waiting for our food. Our waitress was great but the kitchen staff needs a lot of improvement. With so many places to choose in Downey, you would think that management would keep better tabs on the kitchen crew. By the way this was a Monday evening. 3rd pic was replacement steak which was much better."
Ronnie V.,"Downey, CA",5,11,22,5.0,6/19/2017,"Oh man! It's been almost a month since I should of posted this review and feel terrible I didn't do it sooner. I had dinner with my girlfriend and we got the pleasure of Tim as our server for the evening. It was a busy night yet this guy didn't miss a beat. Friendly and very informative of the extensive menu. Offered good recommendations for us both we kept ordering. He was friendly, good sense of humor and always checked on our table. That's what customer service is all about. Thanks Tim for being our server."
Tina H.,"San Bernardino, CA",177,347,2227,4.0,5/7/2017,We have come to this location with our kids a few times it's very kid friendly. Kids can defiantly be kids so go a head a let them be loud! all of or food came out at a normal speed:) so it wasn't to long to wait for a table of 7  We all enjoyed our food half of the family liked the pizookie and some didn't care for it. But all of our meals were to our liking no complaints here. Staff are usually very friendly and very helpful! (We have got a bad apple ever once in a while but not to many!) That's are 1 point deduction for a few bad apples. Other than that we are happy customers:)
Joseph W.,"West Covina, CA",2,8,,5.0,11/8/2017,"Every time me and my family come here, the place is always filled with people but we still get to sit down and enjoy our dinner. The place isn't very loud like other restaurants and that's what I like about it. Also the food is delicious and we don't have to wait that long for it and when we order dessert, we always get their famous pizookes and they are very warm and delicious and they never disappoints all."
Daisy H.,"Bellflower, CA",0,41,117,5.0,5/28/2017,"We love coming to BJ's! the food is great, the ambience is fun, the booths are clean and our server Michelle was very attentive and patient with us and our kids! Bty this place is very spacious, it doesn't feel crowded even when they are packed, it's family friendly,  the restrooms are a bit small but very clean."
Geri J.,"Seal Beach, CA",6,5,3,5.0,10/21/2017,Our server Ken handled our 20 person party in a friendly and professional manner. Drinks on time and kept filled. Food came hot and correct. He always had a smile and remembered all our diet cokes and mine with cherry. Great experience. We come here often.
Marlene R.,"Downey, CA",6,5,2,1.0,5/12/2017,"I'm not one to yelp bad reviews but I want to share my experience at BJ's because it was poorly handled. I ordered a salmon salad and I noticed a dead fly in my food. I immediately let my server know and he was very dismissive of what I said. He walked away and said ""Well this is not our fault"". I expected him to come back or the manager to my table to address the situation but NOBODY ever came to apologize on behalf of the restaurant. My server Daniel T just dropped off the check and didn't acknowledge what was going on. I am truly upset with the service at this restaurant, let alone the hygiene that takes place in their kitchen!"
Jen S.,"Downey, CA",5,2,4,3.0,9/24/2017,"Great pizza, but wanted to get on the brews that are exclusive but out of two that I wanted, they didn't have both... Missed out on two more beers from me. Left early."
Bobbie M.,"Riverside, CA",112,66,,5.0,4/7/2017,"My friends & I went there for lunch yesterday & were fortunate enough to have ""Denise"" as our server.  She was very attentive and friendly explaining the menu when we asked questions.  She is definitely an asset to BJ. Anyone goes there ask to sit at her table."
John S.,"Downey, CA",61,343,2081,1.0,3/8/2016,"The 2016 YELP 500, Review #019:  Ordered a turkey burger. Rather than have it like it is on the menu. I just had the waitress write down and read my order back to me.  The order was as follows: Turkey  burger. Add cheddar Lettuce, tomato, pickle. I do not want raw onions but... Add grilled onions... and by grilled I mean, if the Downey, California Fire Department shows up, then you guys did it right. The woman wrote all that down and somehow it came out wrong.  BJ's screw up number.... umm. Sorry but, I lost count. A member of their management team comes out removes the burger from the bill, subtracts 25% from the overall bill and still gives us the burger done right but, I had to take it to go or be late for a play in downtown Long Beach.  I am so tired of being disappointed by this chain... Really... Portland, OR... Beaverton, OR... Clearwater, FL (about 4 or five times), Citrus Park, FL. I mean, what is it about a turkey burger that is so difficult. If someone knows, PLEASE tell me.  Oh and giving me a gift certificate for $25 doesn't  make things better. .. I don't  want to be there again (My friends  were going so I was stuck in a group of pro BJs ppl that had no idea the extent of my burger woes) Well I am at the play""Closer Than Ever"" ... and I a starving... can't wait to eat later... I have a double Fatburger in the fridge. .. BJs burger will be given away to  a homeless person right after this show (if I can find one in Long Beach)."
Pooh Y.,"Downey, CA",0,10,,1.0,10/2/2017,"BJs as a franchise is awesome. I have been to this location many times but tonight was just awful. The food is always great but service is what makes or breaks the experience. Tonight was not busy but the wait for food and drinks was outrageously long. The server Yanira was rude and unattentive to our party of five. We asked for our checks to be split into three and her attitude went south. Our drinks took longer and longer to come out and when asked about a promotional deal, she was not happy. It's not like she is paying for the free pizookie, BJs is. All I can honestly say is that tonight would have been a descent night if we had a server who actually would do their job without such a bad attitude and a smile. Even a fake smile would have been fine with us."
