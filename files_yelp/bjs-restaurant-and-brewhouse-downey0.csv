Annie N.,"Fremont, CA",441,56,87,4.0,7/4/2014,"I absolutely love their happy hour menu!  Happy hours are Monday- Friday from 3-7PM and Sunday- Thursday from 10PM- Closing.  You have to sit at the bar area to order from their happy hour menu.  Their signature deep dish personal pizzas are only $6.   I always order the BJ's Favorite and the Barbeque Chicken! Both so flavorful and delicious! Their Pizookies are AMAZING! They definitely get me drooling, so it's a must when you go!  Although it's just ice cream on a cookie, I can never make it as yummy as BJ's!"
Alex G.,"Whittier, CA",27,54,43,3.0,10/5/2015,"Great food, takes me way back. Service okay. Had a great start at the full bar and transferred to a table once my lovely wife joined. My service was slow but pleasant."
Brandy N.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",216,45,105,4.0,3/10/2016,Second time here and nothing has changed. Great service and good food. If you haven't been to BJ's you gotta try it
Suzanne V.,"Montebello, CA",119,47,925,4.0,9/24/2014,"Great place to come if you have time to kill. The food is great, but the service is a little slow.  If you are in a hurry during the lunch hour, you should call in your order ahead of time. Otherwise, the food is worth waiting for.  I had the fried chicken lunch special, the chicken was nice and crispy and very flavorful. Perfect portion size for me. My husband had their spaghetti with meat sauce. The noodles were cooked perfectly Al dente."
Jeannie K.,"San Diego, CA",182,15,8,5.0,3/28/2016,"You often go to restaurants for consistent, quality service. It may not be mind blowing every time but it's good enough. BJs is one place I go to for excellent service and it's primarily because of one of their bartenders / servers - Cayla! Not only is she genuinely friendly, but she's knowledgeable and knows how to make a mean recommendation! She also goes out of her way to make your dining experience unique. Her authenticity makes you just love her and connect with her. That's a trait that can't be taught. She makes me and my friends feel welcome every. single. time. BJs is such a gem in downey and it's because of people like Cayla that make their customers feel special. We can drive anywhere and eat anywhere but we come here because of the people who make it memorable. Nom nom nom."
Adrian R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/2/2017,The worst BJ's I've been too. Doesn't look or feel clean. Customer service isn't great either. Decided to just walk out.
Eileen F.,"Downey, CA",0,15,8,5.0,8/16/2016,"Great food, great service, amazing desserts! BJs does brew its own beer as well as sodas which are mega bomb. Puts our sodas like coke to shame. I can never get enough of the oreo pazzuki(I'm pretty sure I'm spelling that wrong). The pizza here is also great."
Joanna F.,"Bell, CA",73,56,164,5.0,6/9/2015,"Had lunch here today and all I can say is WOW! They are spot on now! Servers were on point, food was amazing and the beer was good & cold! There;s the BJ's I know & Love! So glad it's back! I had the new Grilled Salmon on a bed of Quinoa and asparagus, I asked for Brussells Sprouts to be added too and they said no problem! It was Fantastic! So glad the service and the food is back up to par. I will definetly recommend this place again, and I suggest you try the Salmon! It's Lovely! :)"
Damaso A.,"Paramount, CA",9,13,8,1.0,7/3/2016,"I gave 1 star for the service which was good, our waiter was nice and brought our food and drinks promptly. The main reason we were at BJ'S that night was for food, the food was horrible. My spinach artichoke dip was disgusting, my baked potato taste as if it fell in a sink full of water and microwaved, and my steak was not only dry as a bone but was overly seasoned. I literally cringed to swallowed the piece in my mouth and that taste haunted me the whole ride home"
Bee's S.,"Maricopa, AZ",14,39,48,5.0,6/17/2014,"This place had great service for 15 guest. The two young ladies who attended us were outstanding! I believe in service and we received great service. Above and beyond. Great conversations and recommendations.  Five stars for great service, food was great. Ate pizza and ribs. Had some drinks too ;)"
G L.,"Northridge, Los Angeles, CA",1,19,,5.0,12/25/2016,"What a nice location! Went in for brunch and the food was delicious ( I had to have pizza for breakfast) !! Our waitress was so nice and was on top of everything, will definitely be coming back."
Phoebe B.,"Torrance, Los Angeles, CA",5,54,28,5.0,5/26/2015,Me and my friend came here because Acapulco closed at 10 but I'm glad we ended up inside. We sat at the bar and Demetrio was awesome. He was really helpful and super nice to us!  If you haven't tried any of BJ's own beer the Nutty Brunette is a must try! (If you're into darker beers that is). Overall I'm glad they were open until midnight and the happy hour prices were great! For 4 drinks and appetizer we only ended up paying $17.
Cindy B.,"Bell, CA",434,289,243,5.0,3/5/2014,"I love BJ's!! (good thing I'm a female, otherwise, I would have looked liked a perve and it wouldn't of had sounded right. Ha!) Ok, this place is always packed and loud but that doesn't stop me from coming. I love their Jeremiah Red beer, their Balsamic Glazed Chicken and their pizookie (Heaven!). I always try to get a seat at the bar section but the majority of the time it's pretty hard especially when you have Dodger/Laker games. Anyhow, I strongly suggest you give them a call and have them add your name to the wait list (if they have any that day) because waiting time for two can be 10-15 mins, I can only imagine how long it'll take for a big party. Pros: Good food Plenty of TV's to watch the games Good alcoholic beverages Good food Pretty good service (depending on your server, obviously) Cons: Pretty long wait time Loud Parking can be a bit hectic"
Helen F.,"San Francisco, CA",70,62,,3.0,7/8/2015,Went for a lunch with coworkers. The atmosphere is great for outings but the food itself is very average. I wouldn't come here to eat fine American cuisine but if you need a place to go for large groups and celebrations BJs has you covered
Karla S.,"West Valley City, UT",17,3,,1.0,3/9/2016,"Our waitress took long for a simple thing as refills, kept forgetting what each individual ordered , wouldn't spilt the bills for us. Trying to figure out the bill for 15 plus people became a headache when we asked initially for her to spilt the bill she just walked away and ignored the request to let us figure out the bill. As a waitress I was disappointed by her customer care and willingness to help."
Monet S.,"Van Nuys, CA",133,10,5,3.0,6/15/2014,"We love BJ's and chose this awesome place for father's day ""Brunch"". Our first ""Brunch"" at Bj's. We got there fairly early and was seated quickly, our server was efficient and polite. the issue here is that we ordered said Brunch which is basic pancakes, weird bacon , and some eggs. Cool no problem, except it took over an hour to get our food. Sure it was a little busy, I've seen worse, but over an hour twiddling your thumbs at the table was not cool, and pops was not happy. After patiently waiting we found a manager and she offered to see the issue and we never saw her again. The food came out mildy warm and the whole experience was just blah. No one was happy this day, sadly. We get it, it's a Holiday, and busy busy, but really over an hour for pancakes and scrambled eggs? Not cool BJ's.  Fyi we tipped our server as usual, he was awesome. Tip to the 'raunt, have more cooks on father's day, some people do actually love and celebrate their dad's!"
Jesse A.,"Long Beach, CA",410,66,107,4.0,1/25/2016,Celebrating my sisters 22nd birthday. The food was great and the service by Aliza was perfect. Give this young girl a raise or promotion. She is going places. Also gotta love the nachos and chicken Alfredo here :)
Elle E.,"Downey, CA",0,12,,5.0,7/11/2017,"It's been a while since we had it but i remember the sweet pig pizza is very tasty. The root beer glazed rib appetizer is delicious but the regular sauce they put on their racks of ribs can be kind of spicy. The rib-eye steak is great. We order it medium rare and it is seasoned well and cooked as we like it. Their wedge salad, which is an old fashioned favorite that they do right, is great with plenty of blue cheese and bacon etc on top. We're beer drinkers and usually get their hefenweizer (i'm sure my spelling is off) but this last visit i gave my liver a break and tried the iced tea, it was okay...just iced tea...i missed the hef, it's a great beer. They have weekday deals and their $10 burgers are creative and filling. I like the fries; they seem to have changed over the years and now they look like they have a crunchy coating on them but are very soft and potatoey inside. We usually go on off hours and sit in the bar section and can say this location has attentive, informed, cheerful servers who never fail to enhance our meal. I would also recommend joining their loyalty program. There are tons of bj's so wherever you are you can tuck in for bite and the points add up quickly. As well as they send you info on new beers coming out and promos like buy one entree get one free."
Pablo S.,"Los Angeles, CA",113,53,83,4.0,3/14/2015,"I visited this location for the first time this past Thursday night. I was conducting a meeting for work and I chose this BJ'S for driving convinience. So I arrived early because I needed a large booth which worked out because I ended up getting a big booth away from the loud happy hour crowd. The staff was nice by making sure I got the right size table for my meeting. The other thing was that the staff had plenty of patience with our 2hr meeting. We ordered pizza, pazookie and avocado egg rolls. The pizza was good and not greasy at all. The rest if the food was good. I really want to thank the staff for accommodating my meeting and for coming out with great food."
Alex T.,"Downey, CA",0,5,20,5.0,1/3/2016,"Great services!! First BJ's I've had great service.  I have been in several locations but never with service like the Downey location.  My food, drinks and my server Gerardo were great!! Will definitely come here again just for the service....."
