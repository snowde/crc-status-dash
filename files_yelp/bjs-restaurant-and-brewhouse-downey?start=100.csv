Darlene T.,"Los Angeles, CA",514,8,4,5.0,3/6/2017,"I love BJs food, great pizza/apps/pizookies, even better service! We got LUPE ""Fiasco."" He was just the best and super funny. Enjoyed it all tonight!"
Manuel V.,"Yuma, AZ",150,154,75,5.0,6/19/2016,"BJ's is an excellent place for pizza, fresh beer, wine, and mixed drinks as well as a variety of other dishes. The entire staff is professional and make your eating experience a memorable one.  You can also come to BJ's for most of the live sports! There's also plenty of parking spaces throughout the entire Stonewood Mall complex too."
Jennyfer R.,"Bell Gardens, CA",0,14,2,2.0,4/8/2017,"Came in at around 10:30pm with a party of 11 received 2 orders of bone in hot wings by a waitress named Heidi she asked who had ordered the wings I notified her I asked for boneless wings thinking my order was wrong and she replied ""that is not what I asked"" completely rude and uncalled for, will definitely drive an extra 15 miles to another BJ's to avoid this. Heidi; sorry you were having a bad day/night remember to love your job no matter what it . Am I asking for too much?"
Marvin J.,"Downey, CA",0,9,6,5.0,3/10/2017,Came to bjs cause benihanas was a 2 hour wait. Everyone else in the restaurant was under pressure but our server Valerie was amazing! So attentive and made sure we were satisfied. Thank you!!
Kevin O.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,5.0,9/2/2017,"We've been coming to this location for around 3-4 years now and last night's experience was by far the best. Our waiter (I believe his name is Lupe) helped us out and he had the best customer service we've experienced in a very good while. Very attentive, quick, helpful, respectful and kind. Really enjoyed last night's dinner!!"
Jakeisha G.,"West Covina, CA",155,178,60,5.0,7/25/2016,"Aside from the the wait for a large party, this BJ's has really good service.  We had a party of 10 and the entire evening flowed nicely.  Only small complaint was the lukewarm soup, it was still very yummy but it should be served at a hotter temperature.  I ordered the chipotle salmon but this time is was very spicy.  I did not have any problem exchanging my meal for something that fit my tastebuds.  Our original server left early (I think her name is Laurel) and another server took her place.  Both were excellent! BJ's runs some really good promotions and we will be back."
Montserrat D.,"Temecula, CA",86,8,,5.0,4/22/2017,We received outstanding customer service by our server Gabriel. The food was delicious. Definitely recommend this BJ's location.
Chuck C.,"Downey, CA",0,7,4,2.0,12/23/2016,"Server Yvette you must avoid. She never gets any order correct, that's why you must double check before you leave the building. Plus make sure you call a BWW manager if your food takes an hour to get ready."
Lisa T.,"Azusa, CA",71,8,3,3.0,10/14/2016,"This used to be one of my favorite BJ's to visit. However, I was less than thrilled when our server, Juan, failed to refill our water we waited our entire visit for, failed to clear our table of used dishes to make room for our dessert, and made us wait an absurd amount of time for our boxes to take our leftovers home.  I tried to take into consideration it was dinner time and busy, but every single table in our area had their used dishes taken away before ordering any dessert. I'm only giving 3 stars instead of 1 because Juan wasn't rude and the food was good. I won't be returning to this location."
Eva G.,"Long Beach, CA",11,53,63,4.0,1/21/2017,"I like the food here it's very delicious, the place is clean and usually not a long wait to get you seated. Service is friendly but they take quite a long time for the food to come out. I love the pizza and the pizza cookies they are so good."
Luis A.,"Doswell, VA",7,1,,4.0,4/14/2017,Have been to other BJ Brewhouses and pretty much all the same. Not a bad place to have a beer and meet friends. The difference is usually the service and at the Downey Stonewood location we had a good meal with good beer and awesome service from our server Gabriel.
Gabriel C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,5.0,2/24/2017,Our server Michelle was awesome!!! She was very friendly & a huge help. Great attitude & her communication skills were on point!
Jennifer S.,"Portland, OR",666,562,1974,1.0,8/13/2014,"(UPDATED on August 17). Ugh. They disappoint me. Then, they make me believe that they're okay again... only to disappoint me again. Fool me twice, shame on me. Today, my boyfriend and I ordered salads for take out around 9:00pm. In the one time in the past, they put the dressing in a container inside the salad container. We, unfortunately, didn't think we needed to check our meals before we left. (We were sooo hungry!)  Guess what? They didn't give us any dressing. NONE. Zilch. I would've rather had a salad pre-mixed with dressing than a salad with no dressing at all. $30 for salads... salads with no dressing. I know. $30! Ugh.  That's it. I can't even look at this place. It's taken me on an emotional roller coaster. I'm sorry, Downey BJs, but our relationship has ended. - - - UPDATE:  So, I was invited back by the manager after above fiasco. Unfortunately, they didn't do any better. It took almost an hour after we ordered to get our food. I was informed the take out person is new... but an hour? And they almost forgot to give us a sandwich. They tried to be really nice about it - offering beverages, etc. Still. By the time we got home, our take out was cold. Ugh. I'm sorry. I wish I could fix my review, but then, it'd be a lie."
Gaby R.,"South Gate, CA",0,2,,5.0,8/23/2017,Timothy M. Really stepped up tonight and made our family dinner a great one! Great service all around and he was really attending to all my family's need thank you Tim for your great attitude and service!
Roberto H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,5.0,8/23/2017,Timothy made our family dinner! He was so attentive and truly a great server. I've been coming to this location for years and have not had such a great customer service experience!
Alex S.,"Norwalk, CA",0,1,,4.0,8/23/2017,Went to BJ's in Downey tonight. The food was awesome Timothy did a great job bringing our drinks and food over. He was on point anticipating our needs. Had a great night with the family at BJ's. Thanks!
Lea L.,"Los Angeles, CA",219,138,81,3.0,5/26/2016,"Meh... Was taken here on a date. It was ok. He should of just listened to my selection. Firstly, I had Brooke and she was amazing. Great server and attentive. She helped me pick out my meal. Which in hindsight is my fault. I am so picky but I will say the Parmesan Chicken tasted well. However, one piece was nicely browned while the other was barely golden. I actually wasn't sure if it was the chicken. Long story short I got sick from it. Kind of knowing the chicken wasn't done.  Other than that, my margarita was the bomb. Wish the fruit wasn't frozen so I could actually eat it with my teeth chattering.  My date enjoyed his food as well. He is simple to please. I will try again and see.."
Raul O.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,14,1,4.0,3/25/2017,"Enjoyed the place. Good food and good beer. Also like the fact they are open till 1am. Great for dates, family and groups. Next time Im going to the bar section. Woot woot!"
Stephanie A.,"Los Angeles, CA",157,113,326,1.0,10/17/2014,VERY disappointed with the deep dish. It is a lie. Don't order it please. I see the manager walking around but he clearly avoided us. I tried to get his attention it was a no go. So the only good thing here is the beer not even the pasta. The calamari is subpar. The beer is great! On the plus side our server Danny was amazing!! Service is awesome here so that's why I give a star!
Keesha G.,"Downey, CA",68,2,,4.0,2/23/2017,"Took my kids to have a bite to eat.  Tim our server was so very welcoming and had a great attitude.  He is definitely an asset to have there. I  will return just because of him. My kids thought he was so cool and down to earth..... keep up the good job Tim""theredbullking"" thank you for the great experience at BJ'S my favorite place to eat.!!!"
