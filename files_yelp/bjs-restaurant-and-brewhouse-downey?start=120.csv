Rosie R.,"Compton, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/16/2016,"PLEASE IMPROVE. I have been here plenty of times but I will never return. The past 2 times were terrible. It took a long time to get drinks, our appetizers were brought Out at the same time as our entree. The server left all the empty glasses and extra plates on our table for our entire dinner. I had my 2 year old son with me so having the plates clear is important for me to enjoy my dinner. Of course my son wants to throw the plate on the floor. He is a toddler! Either way whether my son was there or not plates should be cleared. Don't bring me another glass of water with out taking the empty one! We told the server we were sharing an entree and he only brought one plate, and took a while to bring us another so my husband and I are eating from the same plate sharing the steak knife.  The cherry on top was that our steak was over cooked.  When the server asked if everything was okay, at the same time my husband and I said no. They called over the female manager that just apologized and said she was removing our appetizer for us. Like she was doing us a favor. We didn't want the appetizer anymore because we wanted it BEFORE our dinner. My husband is a manager of a sports bar and I am a server. We both know that the server could have done better but the manager should have handled the situation better. I am writing this review so this restaurant can improve the quality of service. They have lost a family that frequently visited this place and most of the time enjoyed the food."
Kenny G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,19,,5.0,2/1/2017,I  been to this B.J restraunt several times. This is actually the first time I have receive best in class customer service from the bartender Marissa. Once we arrive in the bar she immediately acknowledged both of us with a smile:) . She introduced herself and also mentioned the HAPPY hour specials with a smile:). We stay for several hours and did take advantage of the HAPPY hour special that she continued to push. Marissa treated both of us like kings in a castle. We will both definitely be back with our friends and family. Her looks match her personality; just a beautiful person all around and very professional:) I witness her engagingly with all customers:) She is definitely a keeper:).. I came here before and bartenders were not friendly and seemed annoyed when I would place my order Thank you BJ's for improving your customer service
Mayra G.,"Gardena, CA",0,2,,1.0,8/15/2017,Worse experience ever. Service was horrible 1st  I had to ask my server for my drink more than two times before she brought it to me. Secondly I order a burger with sweet potato fries. When my food was brought my fries were cold like if they had been out for hours and old not freshly made. I had to wait another 15 minutes to get new ones. After that I had to wait again for me to get a refill on my drink. After that my husband and I order a mini chocolate chunk dessert and it was never brought to us. The server brought us the check before even bringing the dessert. We waited 20 minutes and asked her what was going on and how much longer it would take. Well I guess she never put in the order and said it would be right out. Well that never happened. I asked her to take it out of our check and she had an attitude about. Her response was well it's being made if you don't want to wait for it someone else can take it. What type of customer service is that???? So instead of taking it out the check she gave me a coupon for a dessert next time and said it will be out. I didn't want a coupon We waited another 10 and nothing came out. We finally left without our dessert and without the dessert being taken off our check. By the way this is the rude server who we had #0316a Citlalcoat. Never again will I come here.

Celeste R.,"Santa Fe Springs, CA",146,3,,4.0,3/8/2017,Love coming to this location and so convenient because it is right by the mall. I have had Aaron as my waiter for a few times now and he is always great. Great service every time I have him. Definitely coming back!
Christine V.,"Laguna Hills, CA",194,232,492,4.0,10/18/2015,"Pizza delish, pumpkin ale delish! Chips and salsa yummy. Perfect early dinner for a Sunday and everyone's here watching football and cheering. Good thing I got my cardio in because I had a slice of pizza! I'll always come back!"
Andrea G.,"Wilmington, Los Angeles, CA",74,20,4,5.0,10/23/2016,"Service was amazing! Gerardo is the bomb. Very patient and helpful. We had a large group, a lot of kids which can be challenging but he was super amazing! Food was perfect! Prices were great thanks to happy hour! Couldn't have asked for a better night! THANKS GERARDO!"
Darla D.,"Hawthorne, CA",293,10,10,5.0,3/3/2017,This is my favorite pizza place in Whittier. I  can't but stop by for slice when I'm in the city.
Phillip H.,"Lakewood, CA",94,5,7,5.0,8/7/2016,"So, it was late Sunday Night, I had such great service I figured I'd give it another go even though it was slightly out of the way.  Luckily I was seated and greeted right away.  When I got my menu, my waitress (Luckily Melinda, the same cute Blonde from last time I was here) suggested the Late Night Burger!  How fitting so I figured I'd give it a try!  All I can say is delicious!  Could be a tad spicer, nothing a few Jalepenos that my waitress brought me didn't solve!  WTG Melinda's and BJ's."
Brianna L.,"Santa Clarita, CA",122,1,,1.0,2/3/2017,"This is the worst service I've had at any restaurant not just a BJ's. The food came out in different orders. I ordered last and my food came first before I even got my water. They forgot two peoples meal plates, they were never brought. I would not recommend this to anyone and would not come here again."
Victor C.,"Monterey Park, CA",0,9,1,1.0,7/7/2017,Service was decent but the food tasted worse then getting tacos from China town probably just as bad as getting Chinese food from a Mexico. My pork chop was dryer then the Sahara desert.
Kelly B.,"Los Angeles, CA",482,250,5,4.0,5/27/2015,This place is pretty standard. I was seated right away and got my drink and food pretty quick. This place is not really good for wine. They have some basic stuff but mostly budget wines. This place is better for beers- they have a pretty good selection of beers and their mixed drinks look pretty yummy. They have a pretty large selection of low calorie foods so you don't feel like you're missing out on all the yummy action. I ordered the portobello burger with skinny fries that was delicious and not too greasy. I kind of loved that it came in a tin tray.
Christian E.,"Canyon Country, CA",118,25,2,3.0,1/22/2017,"Had dinner here with my family last weekend and whem we were told the wait qould be about 20 mins actually took over 45 mins. People with the amount as our party would check in after us and get seated before us. Once I complained to the hostest, she claimed that they had done a phone ahead feature and therefore were a priority. Only reason we waited was because we were very hungry and couldn't wait another hour somewhere else. Food was good but the overall service just simply sucked!"
Tae G.,"Los Angeles, CA",101,765,1929,4.0,8/29/2015,"I always enjoy coming to this BJ's. Service is attentive. Food is always fresh and hot and drinks are good. I love the clam chowder and yummy bread loaf. The mashed potatoes and avocado egg rolls are some of my favorite options as well. Who could go wrong with any of the pazookie options?! I try talking myself out of getting one every time I eat at BJ's!! Lol.  Parking can be a hassle because BJ's shares the lot with surrounding restaurants, stores, and the mall. But, get there at a reasonable time and it's not so bad. Even better, sign up for Paint Nite here. Otman is an awesome instructor!!"
M V.,"Long Beach, CA",0,3,,5.0,7/26/2017,Denise did an outstanding job. While I have been here a few times this was my wife's first venture into BJ's. Food was excellent. Service was even better. Hats off to Denise and her trainee Ariana.
Shelley C.,"Los Angeles, CA",470,646,455,4.0,8/10/2015,"BJs is great as always. Strawberry lemonades, steaks, salads, apps, pastas, pizzas, they are all so good.  Service here was quick and easy which I liked, and lots of parking. Didn't have to wait at all!"
Victor G.,"Commerce, CA",62,5,,5.0,1/30/2017,I come here often and the bartender Candice is always really nice and very attentive and funny. I like the atmosphere. The food is great. Definitely will recommend this place.
Christina V.,"Whittier, CA",0,1,,5.0,6/17/2017,Got off of work early and wanted to have a drink and eat something small. Courtney C. recommended the cous cous mac and cheese and it was delicious and just the right size! She also recommended that I try Angry Orchard and I love it! New favorite! Thank you Courtney! Definitely coming back!
Adrian I.,"Bell Gardens, CA",0,4,1,1.0,7/3/2017,"The pizza leaves a very strong and nasty odor on your hands and mouth, it smells like burning plastic. The bacon hamburger has a sour taste mainly the buns but the meat was not cooked right it was cold form the middle. The soda sucked it was 90% ice I took one small sip and I finished it I could not stand to be in the restaurant one more minute that's 50 dollars I will never get back"
