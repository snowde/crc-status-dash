Linda L.,"Los Angeles, CA",497,349,855,3.0,3/14/2015,1 check-in I decided to order take out one night since I wasn't in the mood to leaving the house with NY babies just to go eat. Ordered 2 entrees and a side salad. Pick up time was at 6pm but my husband ran an hour late. They were kind enough to give me a courtesy call to ask if I would still pick up my take out order. I assured them I am just that my husband was running a bit late.  So my husband picked up our take out. First thing I asked was for my salad. Apparently it wasn't packed in. Again another disappointment that my take out order wasn't given the entire order. Upset I called the store to asked if its possible to have a refund over the phone for the missing salad because I did not want to have to go back to pick it up. Manager apologize and was kind enough to give me two options. Either get a refund by phone or he can send me a gift card for the amount + a gift. I thought why not I can wait. The salad was well under $4 anyways. Sure enough. I received the gift card in the mail. The manager had written an apology for the mistake and given me a small gift to go along with the refund of the salad. Though I was pleased with the incident. I'm very pleased with the service. They did the right thing to assure the customer would be happy. The food I ordered came delicious and warm still even though my husband ran an hour late for pick up.
Cindy P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,5.0,1/14/2017,"I've been to this BJ's on several occasions and never have I had such exceptional service as I had tonight, Michelle M gave the best service hands down  The island smash was so delicious!"
Lori A.,"Lakewood, CA",55,5,,5.0,1/14/2017,"Had a great birthday luncheon this afternoon at BJ's thanks to our waiter, Anthony C. He provided us exceptional service with a smile and did his absolute best to make our lunch a wonderful experience.  He corrected our order, after a misunderstanding, promptly and courteously. Food was great and we will definitely request to be seated in his dining area next time we visit BJ's. Shout out to you Anthony C!"
Karina V.,"Los Angeles, CA",118,125,190,4.0,3/6/2016,"I've been here a few times and it's hit and miss with their service but when we came on 2/25 Daniel was our server and he was great, he made sure our cups were always filled brought out the condiments we asked for. Great service overall. The food was good, you can never go wrong with their Ahi Salad, my son ordered the brisket burger which he really enjoyed."
Miguel A.,"South Gate, CA",87,1,2,1.0,9/18/2016,"Went in today because I was craving a steak. Made a reservation thru the app. Wich is very convenient. I ordered the Rib eye medium. 40 minutes after we were still waiting on our food. The people next to us wich got there after we did got their order first. When we finally get our food, my steak was so over cooked it looked like a piece of charcoal!!! I spoke with the manager he said he would bring me out another steak. 20 mins later the second steak came out and it was even worse!! The steak was completely black! So over cooked that it wasnt even tender just a hard piece of steak!!! I was extremely disappointed and angry! I didnt even try to eat it!! I just asked for my bill and asked to speak to the manager again! I payed! Waited for about 10 minutes and the manager never came! As I was leaving I noticed the manager just hanging around the bar area. I used to love going to BJ'S but after this experience I will never take my family there or recomend this location to no one!!!! If I could give it zero stars or even negative stars I would! I will post the pics of the steaks just so you guys see that when I said the steaks looked like a piece of charcoal, I wasnt exaggerating or lying."
Joe M.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,2,,5.0,7/7/2017,"Last night had dinner with family and friends. Had a marvolous time our server Courtney was wonderful at explainig the menu items. Recomened a watermelon mojito and she was on point so refreshing and delicouse. Our server made it a good exsperence, we will defanitly be back."
Alyssa V.,"Whittier, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/18/2016,only gave one star because I had to! WORST customer service the waiter forgot about us plus waited over an hour for our meal! ended up asking for the check for our drinks & left! ridiculous wait I am never coming to this location again!
Michael P.,"Paramount, CA",47,23,21,2.0,3/18/2015,"I am writing my review based on our visit last night (St Patrick's day). So I give it two stars based on the fact that we were sat very quickly and the staff who dealt with our issue was very courteous.  Let's see, where do I start? Ok so we sat down and ordered drinks and an appetizer. Everything seemed to be going well, we put in our dinner order and I asked if my ribeye steak could be butterflied to avoid it being burnt. As soon as the food came out, there were two issues, the steak was too charred and it was a New York steak. So the server said I'll get you a ribeye and make sure it's not burned. She offered a soup while I wait. I said sure I'll take one. Let me also add, my parents ordered a burger and it said it had green leaf lettuce. This burger had the nastiest clumps of ""lettuce"" in it, when we brought it to the servers attention she said ""umm ok do you want another burger or what?"" As if there was nothing wrong with the lettuce. My parents just said ""bring us fresh lettuce and we'll eat it."" Lettuce never came. So everyone is pretty much done with their food, when the soup arrives. Didn't look at all appealing. The. She says ""oh your steak should be right out."" Steak came out and it was charred on the outside and very undercooked inside. This is an issue I have every time I order steak at BJ's, I guess I should follow my servers advice and ""find a new plate"" Thanks for reading."
Kelly P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,23,,2.0,11/15/2016,"I'd go elsewhere or find a different BJs. Went there yesterday with a friend. He ordered a jambalaya and I ordered soup in a bread bowl with salad. My salad was the first to come which was fine. However, once my friends jambalaya came, I waited almost 15-20 mins before I got my soup bowl! It was taken to the wrong table and nothing was done about it until we asked our server. The jambalaya was cold by the time my food came.."
Zulima T.,"Cerritos, CA",1,17,7,2.0,7/2/2017,"Came here last night with the boyfriend for date night. Now, we always go to the Bj's in Cerritos but I convinced him this time to change it up and go to Downey instead. His exact words were ""I don't like going to Downey because they always have terrible service there."" We get there and order the avocado eggrolls. Eggrolls come but with no plates. My boyfriend asks the waiter who dropped off the eggrolls (who is not our waiter) if we could please get some plates. He literally did not stop walking from the moment he saw my boyfriend talking to him. He didn't even turn to look at him. He heard my boyfriend ask for the plates and kept on walking. We looked at each other puzzled and he said ""Did that guy just ignore me right now?"" I saw him just look over and keep on walking. I was furious. Our regular waiter comes with the plates and I ask him who was the waiter that dropped off our eggrolls. He says his name is Steven. I told him what happened and that we were very upset. The manager comes over a few moments later and says he heard we had an issue. We explain what happened and he was very apologetic about it. Our food arrives and the girl who brought out our food brings us the wrong pizza. First, she looked completely lost not knowing which table to go to. I suspected that would be our food and when she gets there it's the wrong kind of pizza. Our waiter comes and apologizes saying she made a mistake and that the correct pizza was right there the whole time. We were almost done with our food and a family comes to sit at the table behind us. They ask that waiter Steven something and again this asshole just walks by without responding to them. The lady turns to her husband and says ""Did you see the way that waiter acted?"" By now we're already getting our bill and about to leave. The manager was kind enough to comp our appetizer for the inconvenience. This review gets 2 stars because our waiter whose name I did not get was great and the manager was very nice. However, that dick Steven should not be working there as he has to deal with the public and he is obviously not fit for the job. Don't think we'll be coming back here."
Stephanie G.,"Norwalk, CA",0,11,3,3.0,12/29/2016,"Service was average. Our dinner was delicious, but waitress didn't come around as often as we'd liked. Restaurant was also not busy at all. I needed a refill of water for awhile & ranch as a side that I would have liked at the beginning of our meal. Other than that our visit was ok."
Martha S.,"Long Beach, CA",0,10,4,5.0,6/4/2017,I come to this BJ's all the time. I love the deep dish pizza and the pasta. But last night we got a new server (her name was Rainey) and she was so awesome! She made sure our drinks stayed full and she had a handle on the menu. She made our experience that much more enjoyable. I hope we get her every time! Thanks for the great service!
Rolando L.,"San Diego, CA",2,3,,1.0,6/4/2017,"If there was an option for a 0 stars I'd definitely give it to this place. I had stopped coming here for a while due to poor service but my brothers came from out of town and they wanted to go so figured what the hell. I usually don't write reviews but this time I felt compelled to do it. So we were a party of 7 and were told by the hostess the wait was between 15 and 20 mins, when I entered my phone number they texted me an approximate wait time of 40 to 50 mins, ok no big deal we decided to wait and it actually was more like 20 min wait. We got our table and NO ONE came to say hello, take our drink orders for 10-15 minutes,  are they serious? We decided to walk out of there and that's the last time I'd be going. Very disappointed."
Maribel S.,"Torrance, CA",0,3,,5.0,5/3/2017,"I just have to give Ifath, Girardo and Vanessa a HUGE shoutout for taking such good care of us. The food was delicious, the drinks were amazing and the service was hands down the best we've ever received. We will certainly be going back...soon I hope!!"
Karen P.,"Whittier, CA",76,11,9,5.0,4/30/2016,"Chris Miller is the reason to come here! From the moment I sat down until walking out the door, he anticipated my needs. Had my food before I knew I was hungry and had just realized it... He is management material. Where is his raise? Manager Larry? Where is his raise?;) $$$$."
Brian G.,"La Mirada, CA",6,17,19,1.0,9/26/2016,"Horrible experience, living in Downey there are several choices were to dine. It started with no silverware, no menus, no refill on drinks.  A 15 minute wait to get the check and once the check came a 15 minute wait to pay.  The food was terrible how can restaurant mess up a Cesar salad.  Stay away!!!"
Joe S.,"Norwalk, CA",0,3,,2.0,12/3/2016,Food was good but honestly the service is horrible. Ask for two cokes because they only come around to take your order and bring food. Forgetting to refill your drinks.
Ralph E.,"Whittier, CA",35,76,35,1.0,8/9/2016,"No drink refills, waiter disappeared and we really received the worst service ever.   Come on guys, I have a party of 13, please pay attention to us."
