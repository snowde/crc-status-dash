Alex M.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",119,388,1757,4.0,3/28/2015,After a little league game we went out to lunch. Because it was a hot day out on the field we wanted to sit in an air condition building with some cold beers. We walked in and my fiancée was already in a booth. We sat down and placed our order after seeing the menu. I had the California chicken sandwich with wedge cut fries and my fiancée had the seared ahi tuna salad with extra wasabi. You also can't go wrong with any beer you choose. Food was good as always. Before our meal we had buffalo wings and mozzarella sticks. Those never disappoint. Staff was very nice and waitress was always on point and would check in on us from time to time. Would go back again to eat or even just to drink some beers.
J B.,"Maywood, CA",0,11,2,5.0,10/10/2016,Raymond was very helpful and friendly. He made me and my guest feel welcome. Atmosphere is very relaxing i enjoyed  my food. I will definitely comeback again.
Justin A.,"Beverly Hills, CA",42,163,12,4.0,9/15/2016,Came here for some pizza since I was craving it . The waiter was very nice and food was pretty good too ... liked the craft sodas and pizookie
Rostin T.,"Anaheim, CA",0,5,,1.0,10/17/2016,"Sat down for 25 minutes, nobody spoke to us, we left. Probably the worst bjs I've ever been too. At this point, I'm only writing so this becomes a damn review because it deserves to be one. All we wanted was a damn pazookie so my girlfriend could end her birthday the right way damn it!!!"
Michael C.,"South Gate, CA",32,6,,5.0,9/2/2016,"Our waiter Robert was on point and went out of his way to get us an offer we asked for. Patient, and attentive. We were seated in a intimate area in which made my time more enjoyable with my main squeeze."
Sara E.,"Baldwin Park, CA",1,30,3,2.0,11/3/2016,"I do love bj's food. It's amazing. Which is why I decided to come here for a women's night with my mom and grandma. Sorry to say we were so disappointed. The food was delicious ,as always, but it took 45 minutes after we ordered to receive it. When I asked the hostess if maybe they were short handed, she responded ""well you asked to have a booth, were not the ones that put you there"" customer service at its finest."
Dennis M.,"Orange, CA",1,19,5,5.0,5/2/2016,Customer  service I received from Gerald was absolutely best that I received from BJ's. Best thing about my visit is that I don't have to ask him for anything he was bringing drinks without me asking for it. Food was amazing as well 10 stars for you Gerald
Lizza L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,25,2,4.0,9/13/2016,Love this place!  We usually sit at the bar for drinks and grub and staff is always really nice and helpful.  I have yet to visit and have a bad experience.
Caroline G.,"South Gate, CA",0,5,,4.0,4/29/2016,"I had a great time, we were seated fast and the food was great. I loved my waiter, she was the sweetest and very helpful. The only thing I did not like was the wait for the food. It was over 30min for a salad.  I would come back again though :)"
J. G.,"Downey, CA",0,1,,5.0,4/1/2017,"Went Friday night to our favorite spot BJ'S, and first time we experience great service from a server that wasn't even our server! Her name is Jacqueline! Next time we will request her!"
Jesse A.,"Mid-City West, Los Angeles, CA",24,25,18,3.0,5/9/2015,"Came here for dinner the day before Mother's Day. The place was busy.  Decent food, and good prices. Good place for families or watching a sporting event. *Unfortunately, they do not except reservation's. The host told us we were next after waiting 40 minutes, but called two parties before ours. :/."
Sergio Z.,"Monterey Park, CA",4927,521,7192,4.0,9/14/2014,"Today I took my wife to her favorite beauty salon Helen ' s hair and nails she deserved it later shopping the things for house.   We were feeling very hungry we decided to come to BJ'S restaurant brewhouse in the Stonewood center in the city of Downey. We call if they have any specials they did the deal is 2 for $22 it's a salad, pizza and dessert for $22 that's a good deal before we reach to BJ'S.  The person the phone says would you to put you name on the list we sat yes it save us time and plus finding parking on a football Sunday that's crazy but we found parking with no problems.  We waited but it went fast to be seated right away wow this BJ'S is always pack with football fanatics and people who shop at Stonewood.  The meal we order was the 2 for $22 the style of pizza was deep dish we got the Ranch chicken bacon. They brought our deep dish pizza it looks so good my wife and I got a piece of the deep dish wow amazing good it's was so gooey cheesy good that's the way I like it. I order a a pint of their limited beer I got the  Field day IPA it's really good it wasn't heavy light with a good flavor.  Finally dessert we order the pookie it's a bake cookies in a deep dish with a scoop of Vanilla ice cream it was so good after being in this heat. Overall we a nice time at BJ'S hopefully to come back again."
Abigail C.,"Azusa, CA",0,11,6,4.0,4/23/2017,One of the best BJ's I have ever gone to. Their servers are friendly and you always have fast service. Food is always done really well. One of my favorite places to go to around here.
Jason G.,"Downey, CA",105,8,30,4.0,1/9/2016,"This has to be one of the better BJs I've been to. There is a sense of atmosphere in this one.  Lots of background noise, a great bar to start up chats with random people with. The food is also a hough point of this place. Only issue is staff sometimes takes awhile to get to you once seated. So it can be hard to get someone's attention when needed.  But still a great place for lunch and dinner."
Roger B.,"Downey, CA",0,7,,5.0,3/24/2017,Our server Valerie was fantastic! She delivered service with a smile from start to finish. Our family really appreciated her checking in and making sure our drinks were re-filled and and making good beer recommendations. Extra kudos for showing me how to use my membership points and redeem my free PIEZOOKIE!
Dre C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,1.0,3/21/2017,The service is very poor. The bar tender David is very unprofessional and races. I paud my bill and David chased me down in the lobby  for his tip...asking if I paid my bill!...another bartender... stated I paid my and left a tip. Never returning...
Mm M.,"Downey, CA",0,3,,1.0,4/15/2017,"I went with a week ago and ordered 2 steaks which sounded like they would be good as described on the menu. When the food was brought to us, the steak was stringy like the piece wasnt really meat but muscley :/ I was hoping it would be a good cut since it was 20 dollars a steak."
Randi J.,"Riverside, CA",27,18,3,4.0,9/21/2015,Me and my boyfriend did the two for $25 deal. We thought the food was great the price of alcohol Is expensive as predicted. Our problem was that we were seated before the people next to us and they got helped first...  Then we ended up getting our main course before the soups we ordered. Overall it was a great experience and our goofy waiter made it extra entertaining.
Mari N.,"Fullerton, CA",0,1,,5.0,3/11/2017,"I went to BJs this Friday and had a wonderful experience due to my server! Even with the big party in the patio, he still touched our table any time he could. He helped me find the right BJ beer and was very knowledgeable of their menu. I Will come back just for Gabriel!"
Vicki E.,"Brawley, CA",82,201,62,4.0,7/23/2016,Friendly service and the noise level at this location was bearable. Dinner was served quickly and exactly as ordered. Nice to be able to pay on your phone if you have the BJ's mobile app.
