Juan K.,"Santa Fe Springs, CA",0,4,,1.0,8/16/2016,"TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!!  Came to this location with office group today.  My plate came out 25 minutes after everyone got theirs.  The server never stated why it was taking so long.  He just said he was waiting on my plate.  When the plate finally came out I sent it back since everyone was almost done eating.  The manager came out to tell me he would not charge me for the plate, but I didn't accept and told him to take it back.  I didn't go there to get a free meal.  I went there to have a good dining experience with my office group and this location clearly failed to provide that!"
Ramiro O.,"Whittier, CA",0,2,,1.0,3/31/2017,They didn't bother to get me a free pizookie when I downloaded the app. Why advertise when you don't follow thru?
Megan R.,"Downey, CA",109,11,4,5.0,9/3/2016,"walking into BJs today I was eagerly greeted by Leanne, she was so nice & kept a good conversation while walking to our table we wanted a booth instead of a table & she figured it out as fast as possible, we were sat at a booth with a great server named Matt he was helpful took our order fast & brought us waters without us even asking I didn't hesitate to give matt an amazing tip! I will be returning to this BJ's but strictly for him and his upbeat attitude, and awesome service."
Kirstie V.,"Long Beach, CA",6,68,6,4.0,7/17/2016,Good food and service...only problem was they gave me chicken on salad instead of shrimp :/  However whatever the seasoning is on the blackened chicken was SO good! The brussel sprouts appetizer was nice and extra crispy. Def a fan :)
Jay M.,"Whittier, CA",0,11,,1.0,8/10/2016,Place is only good when at Bar other than that restaurant service/Staff is unbelievable slow an not attentive whatsoever. Me an my family took my neice there for her 17th Bday with a party of 10 and they didnt even fill our drinks or waters up once until we finished our entire meal.... will not be going back.
Erik B.,"Sacramento, CA",49,3,,5.0,3/24/2017,"My wife and I love coming here. It's funny, we always sit in the bar and usually get the same waiter- Chris Miller. His service is great and he always lightens the mood with some humor. Good times, good food, everything you need right around the corner."
Ashley S.,"Lynwood, CA",0,19,,5.0,8/27/2016,Came here for a lunch with my husband & nephew & we had great service ! Our waiter Anthony C deserves a shout out for his service.
Lisa S.,"Long Beach, CA",1309,1836,312,3.0,7/25/2015,"I used to be a fan of the pizza at BJ's, but on this last visit, I feel like there was way too much bread for the amount of toppings. There was a (very) thin layer of meat and cheese blanketing fluffy and oily dough. Don't get me wrong. I like bread, but I also like cheese and meat. After two pieces, I (along with some other friends) got extremely sleepy and wanted to take a nap. We were attending a work event in the patio area, and it was really hot. There were ceiling fans humming away lazily above and windows were open, but the whole place was pretty warm. I was unfortunate enough to sit in the sun for a bit (there wasn't much seating anywhere else by the time I arrived), and I was uncomfortably sweaty after 30 minutes. I had to move inside. There was plenty of room there and around the bar, and I wish they would have let us move inside. That would have been preferable. Actually, they weren't all that happy with members of our group flooding the bar area. They wanted us to order with the server in the patio. However 1) she had too much to take care of on her own, and though she was doing a good job, people wanted more service, and 2) it was too hot out there for many. I also heard that they weren't offering happy hour prices in the patio, but I didn't get a drink, so I can't confirm that."
Jackie G.,"Irvine, CA",0,3,1,1.0,9/20/2016,"Last night I decided to have some dinner with my friends. We arrived and we're interested in the bar area. Knowing the bar area is self seating from the many times I have visited this restaurant , I see a booth becoming available, and ask for it to be cleaned to be told by the hostess in the front that the party standing next to her phoned ahead for the booth. I was very confused by what she told me because being a premier member I've attempted to call ahead for a table to be told that parties of 9 or more are accepted for reserved tables. I don't understand why she said they phoned ahead if that party arrived minutes after we did and I heard the young lady ask for the booth once we were already standing next to it.  The hostess needs to be properly retrained, I understand the concept of self seating but honestly do not believe she does.  Definitely a disappointing visit last night"
Shauri S.,"Bell Gardens, CA",0,2,,5.0,3/20/2017,This BJ's is awesome! Out of all the times I have been here this last time was above the rest. I met my family there a little late but my waiter Gabriel was really cool about it!! He took our orders and confirmed it with is and checked up on us the right amount of times. We had a small problem with a drink but he fixed it up without a complaint or attitude. He apologized and replaced the drink! I also have a 4 month old who is exclusively breast fed but didn't have a blanket to cover him but I was not told a word for breast feeding in public. It made me comfortable knowing I could feed my son. Thank you Gabriel for being an awesome waiter and thank you BJ's for being so awesome
Madison C.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,,5.0,3/19/2017,Well I have to say that Gerado Roman was an AMAZING server.  There were 7 of us and for some reason 1 person in our party received their meal a later than the rest of us. They were very accommodating and Thomas the Mgr. was very apologetic and humble.  We will totally eat here again and will request Gerado Roman! He even made a rose from a paper napkin.. Namaste.
Jenni M.,"Downey, CA",425,683,2351,2.0,3/15/2013,"So I went here with my husband because he & a co-worker always stop by one of these if they are having a late afternoon lunch. This was my first time in this restaurant. It was the evening of February 26, 2013 at about 6:30. Place was not really packed at that time. If I liked beer, I'd probably have something to say about the selections, but I don't. I just know that my husband likes the Jeremiah Red beer.  So, a key notes... The hostess & our waitress were friendly & got the job done. Restrooms were decent. The avocados on my California chicken sandwich were green and fresh. The fries I got were the super thin, crispy ones. They were good.  Now for my seemingly harsh critique... I hoped for much more roasted green chiles (I noticed they spelled it ""chilies"" on their menu--say what??) than they put on it, but I'm not where near Hatch, New Mexico, to school them on the glory that is green chile. The chicken was cooked fine, but the sourdough bread was saturated with grease. Ultimately, I was totally turned off by the fact, though, that my first set of silverware was dirty. The leftover food on the fork surely would've been too easy to see as they were rolling them up because I saw it before having even unwrapped the napkin. Then there was something floating in my lemonade that shouldn't have been there. Maybe it was like pepper or something, but how the heck did it get there? Review #131"
Jose M.,"Whittier, CA",234,3,2,5.0,8/18/2016,Great service. Food didn't take long to arrive. And the waitress Jacqueline G was the best. She was really nice and always bothered to check up on me and my friends. Thanks a lot we had a great time!
Roxy H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,,5.0,3/10/2017,Typically don't leave reviews but our servers was absolutely phenomenal!!!!!!!!! Her name is Vali!!Thank you for taking care of us! You are the best!!!!
Maite M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,20,18,3.0,2/13/2016,"The good thing about Bj's is that they are open very late where most places here in Downey are closed by midnight. I love their avocado/chipotle eggs rolls with the sweet sauce ( little hint of spicy, but good ! ) The 3 star rating is really only for the second dish we had which was the Calamari. It was too greasy and not crunchy at all but a bit rubbery and the 2 sauces that came with it just did not compliment the Calamari. One seemed or tasted like a thick ranch style dressing but the consistency of sour cream and the second was a marinara that had no real flavor to it. Really disappointed and we huge Calamari fans, we order them at any Restaraunt that provides them on their menu. Otherwise service was pleasant and quick."
Junior S.,"Downey, CA",70,6,2,5.0,9/7/2016,"BJ's has arguably one of the best steaks I have ever ate in the United States. For the Price and wide selection of beers and mixed drinks it's always an option for me on the weekends. I've been to the BJ's at the stonewood mall, but this last visit was more than just good food and drinks. My waiter really was The Best I have EVER had While While eating and drinking at BJ's. STEVEN was his name he was so attentive to our table disparate the Lunch Rush my drinks were getting Refilled without being asked to. The food came out fast and Service Was EXCELLENT. Thank you Steven I look forward to seeing you again"
Mariel O.,"Downey, CA",83,72,589,1.0,8/26/2015,"Probably one of the worst experiences I've had at BJ's. This is the kind of restaurant I would definitely make reservations for during the weekend because it can get really busy during dinner time but I did not think it was going to be this bad on a weekday. Not only did we wait about an hour and a half for a ""45 minute"" wait time, or have at least five parties of 6+ people get seated before us even though we got there before, but they also charged us DOUBLE the amount of the check we signed for. I understand that in some transactions it shows up as two charges on your bank statement and one might get voided once one goes through but no, not in our case. It was a single transaction charged for double the amount. Like the time to at least get seated wasn't bad enough. Thankfully our bank was very helpful and guided us through making the correction."
Manuel E.,"Downey, CA",31,4,8,4.0,8/25/2016,One of my favorite places to eat.when I'm craving pizza. The food is amazingly good. And the service is awesome.
Marc R.,"Bellflower, CA",173,12,4,2.0,7/30/2016,Ok the food was good but the service was garbage we had a party of 6 people we got our plates one by one. I don't understand why we got shitty service was it because we where dirty maybe but my money is still green just like everyone else around us so I'm going to pay their $216 bucks but I will never come back acting all nice after the fact they have fuck up never again sad to say will I be back
Eric C.,"Hawthorne, CA",679,4,1,5.0,6/17/2016,Megan was an amazing server she paid specific attention to detail and has an amazing attitude. I could not get enough of the mini pizookie.
