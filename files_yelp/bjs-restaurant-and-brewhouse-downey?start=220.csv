Daisy M.,"Downey, CA",0,42,,4.0,9/29/2015,"I celebrated my teenage daughters 17th bday here last Spring,  & was not disappointed. She asked that we celebrate it here :0) It was my 1st time here, & we're happy with the outcome. Friendly,,smiling staff. Good food,  Clean & spacious bathrooms. Clean & sanitary restaurant. Fun, upbeat & hey, NO complaints!!! She felt like a princess with our servers' job well done!!! Ohhhhh, when we walked in with her cake I brought in, Hostess even offered to place her bday special cake in the fridge while we dine... & so it'll be fresh when it's time for our dessert :0) Hey, now that is awesome customer service!!! You see, we don't ask for much. Will update on my next visit."
Claudia L.,"Los Angeles, CA",31,4,,5.0,10/29/2015,Great pizza! My favorite is the BJ's Classic Combo pizza... Recommend trying it.  They also have a huge beer selection. You can't go wrong.  Service has always been great.  Check out this BJs!
Joseph P.,"Norwalk, CA",1,14,2,1.0,9/10/2015,"I tried this place for a second time and left assured as to why I will never come here again.  Getting seated was no problem.  Our server said she was going home but actually on break.  Anyway, we got a new server and he was pretty cool.  Food took a little long to come out but I guess as long as its clean and fully cooked it's no problem.   Now the issues I had.  When the food finally came out, the plates were being practically dropped onto the table.  I thought I was the only one who noticed it since I kept quiet but someone else later mentioned it as well when we were leaving.  Maybe he was having a bad day but I could care less.  You're at your job buddy.  Do it right.  I tried to overlook it but found him placing certain plates down as if they were supposed to be floating on clouds at other tables.   Next, we had 10 people at our table.  When we left, pretty much all the cups were only left with ice.  Server seemed like a cool guy but it would've been nice if we could have gotten some refills and didn't have to flag down servers in other areas.   Just wanted to leave the place already.  Asked for the check and togo boxes.  Of course the guy we asked was not our server.  Our server can attend to a small table of 2 have a conversation with them and be resting with one knee on the seat but can't seem to find his table of 10 in the middle of the restaurant.   Our group left unhappy and regretful for coming here.  Overall it was a disappointing experience with poor service.  As for the food, we didn't finish it and boxed it up to get out of there."
Vickie M.,"Whittier, CA",1,8,1,5.0,5/11/2016,"Amber and Vanessa were awesome! They both served us with great pride in what they do. I couldn't have asked for better service from both of them. These two young ladies are great assets don't loose them. Alot of other times that I've visited weren't great experiences,  but when Amber helps our table she's great! Thank you for having them here!"
Jonathan O.,"Los Angeles, CA",35,16,9,5.0,4/10/2016,"Lovely! Everyone here was super nice, and smiling and attentive. I was so taken aback! Definitely will be coming back! Thanks BJ's"
Fernando R.,"City of Industry, CA",49,5,,5.0,4/22/2016,Decided to stop at bjs with a group. Ended up getting to bjs an hour before it closed. The waiter Christophe was amazing. The kitchen wasn't able to make most of the food we ordered because we got here so late but he was really cool about the whole thing. He explained everything that was available in a very nice manner. And we even had trouble getting some of our food with the kitchen because it was closing. But he managed to make the situation better by letting us know what happened. Highly recommend his service if you visit BJs
Stephanie C.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",1,31,9,5.0,5/6/2016,Shout out to our waiter Chris! Such a friendly chill ass dude. He definitely took care of us. Been to this bj's a few times and always has been a blast. Thanks for an awesome cinco de mayo! Ménage e trios best wine here! Blonde house beer is pretty good too. Buffalo bone in wings are a must every time we come here. see you again soon bj's :)
Tiffany A.,"Whittier, CA",136,22,3,4.0,5/24/2016,"Service is always great, same with the food. I love the siracha Brussel sprouts. My favorite drink is the black velvet, half berry burst cider and half porter. Happy hour is decent, join the rewards club, they always have good deals if you're a member."
Antonio C.,"South Gate, CA",29,8,150,5.0,7/18/2015,Breakfast might be something people overlook when they think of BJs. Its my new favorite spot for breakfast on the weekends!
Jesse C.,"Downey, CA",72,669,2043,4.0,8/24/2012,"You just can't go wrong eating at bjs. They've got loads of options to choose from. So many beers to choose from and a decent selection of mixed drinks. There's something at bjs for every one in my opinion. During my recent visit I had their dinner for two offer and it was great. Low on the cost and you get a starter salad or soup, a specialty pizza, plus a dessert to share. The service was exceptional, I can't complain. Although our pizza was a little dry I still enjoyed it. 9 times out of 10 you'll leave happy. Just go."
dawn c.,"Downey, CA",398,54,61,1.0,3/21/2016,"We went to BJs in Downey on 3/19 in the late afternoon. My 14 year old spilled her water and was profoundly sorry, the man who finished cleaning  the water did not acknowledge her apology and stammered away with the empty cup and rag. She never had napkins replaced or cup refilled.  The server could have been more attentive also. We were looking for her a few times and we had to ask someone else for drink refills. It seems like the rudeness runs amuck in Downey. We did not have a pleasant experience at Stonewood Mall or this restaurant at this location."
Kevin T.,"Downey, CA",23,8,43,2.0,4/7/2015,"I never had a bad burger before, until I ordered one here. I had a brew house burger. Had some sort of black tar that they pass as sauce. Complete ruined my day. The beef was tasteless, somehow they ruined bacon, and the lettuce tasted really old. My waitress was annoying too.every time we communicated it's as if she tried too hard to serve me and it seemed like she was begging for a nice tip. As if they weren't paying her enough. Just a strange interaction. Besides that they have 8 tvs, all on the same channel but there's no big game on. The table was sticky and it seemed like the entire staff was unhappy working there. The only thing worth going to bjs for is the pizza. But this is Downey. There's about eight way better pizza restaurants here.  Anyway, I give it 2 stars maybe because I'm too nice."
Patty R.,"San Dimas, CA",0,1,,5.0,4/16/2016,"Last night had a great time. Thanks to Michelle. She kept our drinks filled, made sure we had what we needed and was very friendly. Always moving. If you go there ask for her. Food was good too. Garlic knots were great toasted sourdough and clam chowder was great. Pizookie was awesome."
Betty R.,"Torrance, CA",0,2,,1.0,4/13/2016,"I just order take out I've never ben so disappointed like tonight I order the balsamic chicken, and one, it was cold and two, they did not place the glazed onions this is bs never shall I come or order at this BJ's again.  #pregnantangrylady"
Christina L.,"Downey, CA",38,8,3,2.0,3/14/2016,"I frequent this BJs in Downey a lot, and unfortunately the service here is greatly deteriorating. There are a few diamonds in the rough, but the bad servers far outweigh the good. Our server today was definitely on the bad side. We waited for our food over an hour, never received refills, appetizer and entrees showed up together, food was not hot, and my order was wrong. After waiting so long, I decided to just eat the incorrect order instead of waiting even longer for the correct order. After being there for more than two hours, all we wanted to do was pay and go home, but our waitress was no where to be found (again). This experience has definitely made my family and I reluctant to go back."
Dom P.,"Los Angeles, CA",58,19,,1.0,11/15/2014,"What a waste of time eating at this place. Long waits for mediocre food and lousy service,  1hr wait for the food to come out and to top it off they don't check their utensils before giving them to their guest.  My kid got sick from eating at this place, bad chocolate milk!!! Never again eating at this waste of restaurant.  Horrible horrible waiter! !!!! *** Horrible *****"
Joseph B.,"Malibu, CA",1,74,8,4.0,9/7/2013,"Came here Friday to have a cool drink and watch the Dodgers play. I sat at  the Bar as the booths and tables were occupied and since I was by myself, sans wingman DCR, being a conscientious, sentient being I didn't wish to monopolize seating that was intended for more than a single customer. Anyhow, Stacy was the Bartender and very attentive. Again, the BJs employees at the Downey restaurant truly comprehend customer service.  A customer walked in and sat next to me. He kinda resembled my wing DCR. I'll call this customer Mr. Oblivious. Anyhow, small talk ensued. he talked about getting ink of  a Unicorn with Patrick Swayze on the back. Creepy (this was the first omen). The Dodgers were winning, I ordered a second one.  Then....Mr. Oblivious receives a phone call. He starts talking while he is sitting at the Bar. His volume grew to the decibel level comparable to sitting front row at a Metallica concert. I discretely asked Stacy for some cocktail napkins and stuffed them in my right ear (Mr. Oblivious was sitting on my right). As his volume increased, I covered my right ear with my hand and still, his conversation was deafening.  The game was in the second inning when he received the call. When he ended the call, the game was in the 7th inning. All the customers around him were giving him evil looks, one Latina was saying a prayer hoping for some divine intervention to end the call (like the battery dying on his White Galaxy S3). The white phone should have been a second omen. How many 50 something, non metro, males carry a white phone???? Finally, the conversation ended. Hallelujah. Thank you Ms. Latina for beginning the Novena. Some of the highlights of the conversation (that  everyone in the bar was able to hear) were: The name of the caller - Sally and her relationship to Mr. Oblivious Her latest gynecological test results (she is okay, just a routine test, no UTIs) A Tamale recipe (the proper method to stuff a Tamale) The new iPhone 5 S/C The weather (SoCal heat wave. Really?, thanks for the update Genius) Sally's grandchild's bout with diarrhea (a young child should not eat salsa and chips) Miley Cyrus twerking at the VMA A recent sighting of a Pod of Orcas off Malibu Retirement Account options (401ks, Keogh/Roth IRAs, CDs, Mutual funds) The Kardashians new addition Nori West Aaron Hernandez' not guilty plea President Obamas options for Syria Favorite Reality TV shows (at this point my ears began to bleed). Thankfully the call ended. Mr. Oblivious  looks around and notices that I have napkins stuffed in both ears. ""WAS I LOUD?"" he asked From the other side of the bar area, Stacy, the bartender, responded, ""NO, BUT PLEASE SHARE SALLY'S TAMALE RECIPE WITH ALL OF US"". I finished my beer and left.  Kids, Today's experience of rudeness was probably on par with ""water board torture"" Thank you Mr. Oblivious, tell Sally that the entire restaurant wishes her grandchild speedy recovery with the bout of diarrhea... sigh, FML..."
Gaby V.,"Los Angeles, CA",73,107,126,4.0,2/14/2014,"Absolutely love the Nutty Brewnette, and raspberry lemon drop martini.  2pm lunch specials still available, and lots of seating available at the bar area. Ordered the avocado eggrolls and the corn fritters. Pretty good, not amazing."
Youlanda W.,"Lakewood, CA",0,7,,1.0,9/26/2015,"BJ in Downey, unbelievable. I ordered avocado egg rolls on 9/20/15, and the this came out, see pic of eggrolls.  The plate had food over it, the sauce had cilantro in it, and it's not suppose to, the egg rolls were not fresh and placed in the microwave to cook instead of being fresh and fried to order. The wait was out of this world about 40 minutes. I asked speak to the supervisor, and she took the plate, and said she would bring a fresh ones, the were the same ones, and the plate looked as if they just wipe it cleaned and put the egg rolls back on the plate. I will never, ever, ever, ever go back to this restaurant. If you wish to be served like this than BJ's in Downey is your place."
Jesse L.,"La Mirada, CA",104,29,10,2.0,4/13/2015,"Only writing a review to lecture them on their ""Fresh mozzarella and tomato salad"" or a shittier version of the Caprese Salad. Up your portions, use less balsamic vinegar, more olive oil, FRESH basil (get that dried shit out of there!), and use cherry tomatoes (sliced in half to soak in more flavor from the vinegar and oil) If your going to use large tomatoes, at least cut them small enough to fit in my mouth. And skip out on the parmesan cheese, it only dries up the salad even more, or use FRESH parmesan.  Also salt & pepper to taste."
