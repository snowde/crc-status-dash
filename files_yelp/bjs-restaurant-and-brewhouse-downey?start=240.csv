D S.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,80,78,3.0,3/27/2015,"Service was great and our food was delicious as usual-- had the Parmesan crusted chicken sandwich off the lunch menu which wasn't very good, definitely doesn't beat the actual parm crusted chicken entree from the regular menu."
cesar l.,"Downey, CA",0,7,,2.0,11/15/2016,"One of the few kitchens that stays open till midnight.  The avocado rolls are amazing, but other than that ???.  Chicken Alfredo was bland and dry, A dry Chicken Sandwich and the Mix Drinks are not impressive...  Stuck to beer instead....  This is the 3rd time, we're unsatisfied with the food and mix drinks......."
Esmeralda P.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,31,5,5.0,4/5/2015,"Always great service. I come here maybe twice a month and I usually get a burger, salmon or pizza. Today I got the Atlantic Salmon and my brother got the BJ's burger. Thinking since it was Easter we would have trouble with service or getting seated and we were wrong. We got seated within 5 minutes of walking in and got our food pretty fast as well."
Genesis R.,"Whittier, CA",15,3,4,2.0,11/21/2014,We have been waiting over an hour and still have not gotten our appetizers. Very disappointed in the service here. *update  So we got to our food finally after one hour and 15 minutes And it was not worth the wait. Had to ask the waitress to take our food back it had no flavor and quite bland to be honest.
Veronica H.,"Downey, CA",7,1,,1.0,11/21/2015,"This is no way about the service. This review is about strictly the food, with that being said I can move forward. I decided to take my mom and myself out to dinner last night, even though the food has been a bit disappointing the last few times we still decided to give it another go. To my dismay they no longer serve the shrimp scampi or the shrimp lettuce wraps (which to be honest is the only reason I come here) So I decided to order the parmesan crusted chicken, I've ordered it before so I thought it would be a safe choice. My mom got the jambalaya, Boy were we in for a sad surprise. it was it god awful... like I literally have no words on awful this was... My chicken tasted like burnt cheese and the sides were a hot mess, my moms jambalaya tasted like they dumped a full bottle of allspice all over it... It was simply awful..  I have this bad habit of not complaining so I just asked for the check so we could go.  The service was good but unfortunately that cannot make up for the lack of crap food. This restaurant has definitely gone down the hole these last few years. Thank god for the new Cheesecake Factory in Cerritos because, I simply cannot bring my to come back."
Carlos M.,"South Gate, CA",0,1,,4.0,4/17/2016,"At first I was put off by the hostess, who's name I did not catch, but I was pleasantly surprised by my waiter, Chris Miller's  professionalism. He was quick, friendly, and was impressively  knowledgeable of the menu. It's refreshing to see someone who seems to enjoy their work."

Juan M.,"Montclair, CA",111,302,214,4.0,11/16/2014,"This review is for my visit on Thursday, November 6th. This is only the second BJ's I've ever been to, and so far, this is the best one because it is bigger and better lit. A few of us came by after the Long Beach VA Marine Corps Birthday cake cutting ceremony to throw back a couple and continue celebrating the birth of my beloved Corps. We got there, and the young lady told us at the front it'd be about 20-30 minutes and it was probably only about 15. We had leftover birthday cake and asked if they could store it for us and even though it wasn't in a box of its own anymore (it was what was left of the top layer) they were more than willing to store it for us, BUT did tell us that they couldn't be responsible for anything that happened to it since it wasn't covered. We thanked them anyway and decided to keep it with us. It made quite the conversation piece as people walked by our table to admire our ""unique"" cake, which was really, nothing more than an octagon shaped cake with the topper missing and a big ol' dent in the center. Anyway, more people decided to come join us, and we advised the wait staff, and they were more than happy to move us to a bigger area, probably because we still hadn't settled in and ordered anything yet, but I still that thought that was very cool of them. Moving on to the service, I can't complain. ALL the servers were very friendly and outgoing and it felt more like a backyard bullshit session than being in a restaurant. My only complaint of the night was that we had ordered some shots of Patron and a shot of Jack for the non tequila drinker and while the staff was very accommodating in chilling the shots per my compadre's request, when we actually did the shot, which looked like doubles by the way, we found the shots to be watered down, which probably explains why they looked so big. Now, some people might be fooled by this, but a table full of Marines and two Navy corpsmen know when their hooch has been hijacked!!!!! : ) This calls for like a free app or beer or something on our next BJ's visit, BJ's!!!! You guys deserve a do over to correct this discrepancy! HA HA HA..... As far as the food was concerned, no complaints there. Perhaps it was the good company, but it felt like the food came out right away. I ordered some bomb ass carnitas con chile verde fries and honestly, they could give Alberto's a run for his money! The deep dish pizza Doc ordered was good, although it wasn't very deep in the dish. Deep on flavor though. They even reheated it for us when the stragglers finally arrived to the party. Beer wise, I had the Oktoberfest and it was outstanding. Doc's husband got one of their beers closest to a Bud Light and he enjoyed it as well. If I lived closer, I'd probably come here more because of the outstanding service. Thank you BJ's for taking care of us veterans!"
Andrew  P.,"Bell, CA",27,19,15,5.0,1/29/2015,Finally came again to this BJS and can't believe how great the service was. We got Tiffany as our server and she was on point compassionate about her job you can tell she was into her tables the need behind the need. I guess every BJS has their all stars and at this particular location it had to be Tiffany because even though you can tell she was exhausted and tired she was still giving 100% great customer service. There is nothing more you can ask for with timely responses she got my beer and dinner correct just the way I like now I can honestly say I wouldn't mind coming back to this location. Come to think of it looking at my last post it was the same server who provided great service the last time which made this location a great location to come to!!
Romel E.,"Montebello, CA",6,24,36,5.0,12/7/2014,Came here with my gf last night. I had a sweet pig individual pizza and their stout beer. My gf had a chicken dish. I ordered a pazookie and was glad that my gf didn't want any (more for me)! Everything was delicious! Good service too. The waiter brought my gf water every time her cup was empty. Good night of good eating!
Faye U.,"Compton, CA",0,1,1,5.0,4/12/2016,"First time at BJ's in Downey & was very IMPRESSED by the atmosphere, let alone the SUPERB services rendered by our waiter: Mr. Gabriel! I will gladly be returning to the Downey location versus Cerritos! Thank you again Gabriel. My family truly enjoyed tonight! Much appreciation! #BJ'sInDowneyRocks"
Aniela L.,"South Gate, CA",69,13,1,1.0,1/3/2016,"This use to be my favorite place because on Monday they had my all time favorite berry mojito for $5! I've been back and the service at this place is horrible! I don't want to blame our server, she might have been really busy but it took about an hour to get our food. When it did arrive it was cold. Some waiter dropped off our bill and was full of attitude- I was pissed! Their berry mojitos will always hold a dear place on my heart... We had a good run."
Abraham Z.,"Santa Fe Springs, CA",166,6,4,1.0,11/10/2014,"I ordered wings with bone and they gave me boneless, no big deal. They fixed the order but when I got my new wings my ranch had a huge knot of hair in it. Told them to take it back and just did not eat. Will probably not eat hear again. Servers and managers have a little bitch attitude. Yall wanna tip get a real FUCKEN job. PS yall server some stale bread"
Monica G.,"Los Angeles, CA",418,60,141,5.0,6/3/2013,"Fast service tonight! My waitress was sweet, fast, and helpful! The Mediterranean pizza is delicious!(order it with a side of ranch and add Tabasco!)  The avocado rolls are super yummy with the sweet sauce they serve it with :) I can't wait to go back and try the calamari! And lastly, the famous pazookies! I tried the Oreo one a few days ago and it was incredible! Warm chocolate cookie with 3 scoops of ice cream and ONLY 1,000 calories lol (not kidding, I looked it up) Tonight I tried the original pazookie and it was just as good! :)  If you're going on a date I would recommend asking for a booth indoors :)"
Vianka A.,"West Covina, CA",253,208,369,3.0,11/13/2014,I've never had anything from bjs besides soup and salad!  With that said I've had their clam chowder and in two different locations tasted the same. The bread bowl and ceaser salad is what's keeping me coming back.  The piranha chili ale soup is to dye for I love the style and I wish I order this every time
Nora V.,"Pico Rivera, CA",42,28,,2.0,3/28/2016,"My family and I hadn't been here in a while--at least six months; the last time we were here, we waited a while before receiving our food. So, we decided to give it another try.  It was Easter Sunday, and surprisingly it wasn't crowded at all--we were seated immediately upon arrival, so we thought we had made the right choice. We didn't. After our server took our order, we got our drinks, and patiently waited.....while others nearby, who arrived after us received their food. I wish I would've timed it, but I'll say about 45 minutes before we finally flagged down our waitress (who seemed to be avoiding eye contact with us). She just said, ""your food's taking long, huh?"" She offered complimentary soup or salad, which we accepted.  Our food arrived soon after that. None of us complained to each other, but I know I was very disappointed. I will avoid putting my family through that again."
Peggy H.,"Sacramento, CA",244,202,621,4.0,9/16/2015,"When the General Manager of a large restaurant chain takes the time to monitor reviews on Yelp, and respond to customer concerns-that's impressive! In my opinion, this type of exceptional customer service is reason to bump up the stars on a review. Now, that's exceptional customer service! I'm pleased knowing that customer input regarding restaurant operations truly does matter, and any deficiency noted will be addressed. Thank you, BJs Restaurant, my dining experience at your site has just improved."
Julia V.,"Paramount, CA",81,11,6,3.0,2/24/2015,"We usually go to bjs in Cerritos for wings and pizza of course! But we were near stone wood, so we decided let's give it a try. Here is how that went: Ordered wings: Received wings with ranch drizzled on top (this never happens at any other bjs we've dined at) Had to send the wings back because my husband doesn't like ranch. We were given another set of wings with ranch two more times. Finally we got our wings, but then they had no buffalo sauce on them and they came dry! Haha At this point we were so hungry, we just decided to ask for a lot of extra buffalo sauce to put over the wings!   Lastly I order tomato bisque soup that tasted and looked like pure oil with tomato juice. I couldn't even eat it.  I only give this place a 3 because the pizza and wings were cooked properly and tasted good, plus the server was trying to be helpful as much as she could, I guess. But next time defiantly going back to Cerritos."
Curtis G.,"Downey, CA",54,1,,5.0,4/14/2016,"Love this place! Imma try to make it my new spot for Thursday when I see my daughter. She love the garlic bread, I'm a pizookie type of guy myself. And make sure you ask for Tiffany as your server man that waitress is awsome!!!!"
Mayra D.,"Bell Gardens, CA",0,14,,1.0,7/15/2015,"I remember going to different BJ's restaurants as a kid/teen. I always had a blast eating there with my family and the food was always great This place was horrible in my opinion. I brought my boyfriend here four days ago (his first time too) When his pizza arrived, it was such a dissapointment. Even school pizza tasted better. I ordered some mahi mahi fish crap that had no flavor. The only thing we enjoyed there was the strawberry lemonade and the gluten free pizzooki (not even sure if I even spelled that right) The service was good, it wasn't too loud, but our food was dissapointing.  The only reason why I would come back is for dessert only."
