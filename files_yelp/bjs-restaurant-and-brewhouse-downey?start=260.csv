Chito O.,"Downey, CA",0,35,18,4.0,11/18/2015,"Great food and good atmosphere would recommend after some shopping or before. Really nice and close to my house so real convenient. Also, can not forget the beers on tap are worth the visit alone!"
Lola C.,"South Gate, CA",0,6,1,4.0,4/11/2016,Brook was super nice and helpful and kept checking on us to see if everything was fine.
Nallely G.,"Bellflower, CA",175,16,20,2.0,3/5/2015,"I had been craving their delish pizookie all day. Was not in the mood to dine in so, went with take out. The cookie I received was burned! So, asked for a new one .. Only to find out that the second cookie was completely raw! Horrible. I love BJs, but really?!"
George B.,"Downey, CA",21,57,4,2.0,8/23/2014,"THIS BJS SUCKS!!!! I have my gf working for the one in Cerritos so, since we get discounts, we go to BJs all over the place. Downey, Cerritos, HB, Irvine, Culver city. Usually we're both pretty happy with it BUT.. the one in Downey?!?! NOPE!!!! I have been there 5 times cause i live close but every single time something happens. Maybe they forgot my food, maybe we waited on silverware for 15 minutes after the food was on our table, maybe they messed up the order, maybe my soda needed a refill 20 minutes ago.It is always something going wrong with this BJs. RIDICULOUS!!! I only go back for the discount!"
Alondra S.,"Bellflower, CA",28,12,5,1.0,3/14/2016,"This is the second time i try to come eat here, the first time i was really craving the food so we came and i believe it was a Wednesday and the wait was an hour. That's ridiculous we left and came to the one in cerritos wait time 5 min , today i went again, because its closer to our home, again 1 hour 10 minutes, came to the cerritos one again , wait time 20 minutes. Im just going to stop trying"
Paula C.,"Signal Hill, CA",21,54,284,1.0,9/26/2015,It was an hour and a half until closing and i felt so rushed to eat and drink a beer.  Im not going back to this location.
Josh R.,"Portland, OR",2,14,,5.0,8/8/2014,"Holy Mary mother of God these people are AMAZING. I come here ALL the time because the service is great and because one needs a place to take the lady cougars. You'll want to ask for James or Jose because those guys will show you a good time. One night, they were filming a commercial or human sacrifice or something while I ate my Fresh Atlantic Salmon. The place is nearly always full of damn fine people and the food is sex in the mouth. No wonder they call it BJs, this needs to be the standard for all BJs -- nay, all oral sexual endeavors in general. 5 stars, highly recommended. It's the BJ everybody deserves."
Jill C.,"San Jose, CA",73,91,216,4.0,9/12/2014,Love the service.. We waited 20 minutes for out table they're giving out slices of pizza for people who's waiting.. manager and our server always check on us if everything's okay.. Food came not too long.. Less one star for our pasta shrimp scampi cause it's over cooked but they take that out in our bill since we didn't finish it.. Over all 4 star thanks for the good service  definitely coming back to this location compare to other location
Ditzler R.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,9,3,2.0,1/26/2016,I was not pleased with my food or service. The pizza was delicious. But the avocado rolls and the sauce was not cooked and served good. The sauce looked like it was used and served from someone else plate. The waitress kept pushing us to get dessert when we weren't even have way through our dinner.
Meia C.,"Long Beach, CA",4,33,9,2.0,1/23/2016,"Called ahead of time for a party of 20 mostly kids under the age of 8yrs old, was told at 530 the wait would be 1 hour... currently it's a hour and 15 min later and still waiting with very hungry.  THANKS TO YOUR ASSISTANT MANAGER CHRIS for coming and helping out. We would have still been waiting for another hour leave it up to your hosteses in the front.. Our waiters we're even better!"
Liz N.,"Downey, CA",66,40,5,1.0,12/6/2015,"Pretty bad service. We waited about 15 minutes before someone came and got our drink order. When they brought our food out, we had no utensils. Each time our server came to our table she apologized. The group next to us were complaining that their cups were dirty, and also complained that they hadn't yet taken their order. There was a family near us that got tired of waiting and walked out. Horrible service. We won't be coming here ever again. Moral of this story, don't eat at BJs.  The end."
Krystal N.,"Gardena, CA",1,46,30,1.0,5/22/2016,"I frequented this Bjs several times in the past I even had my sons 16th birthday dinner here where I spent tons of money on food and drinks! Today they sat us on the covered patio after about 5 mins...it was a slow day nobody waiting and plenty of empty tables...I thought this was weird because they never asked us if we preferred being seated inside or outside. In addition to that there was a private party going on, on the patio and they just sat us out there like we weren't paying customers and didn't deserve to be seated inside where there were clearly seats! The private party was looking at us crazy like the uninvited guests we were! It was 23 mins before the waiter came to our table to ask us if we wanted water! Water?!?!?? We have been sitting here 20 mins we wanna order!!!!!!!! We just got up and left it was clear we weren't welcomed here I would even go as far to say it was because we were BLACK! Did I mention it was only 2 of us? Anyway we won't be back and I plan on sharing a fb post in regards to this specific location!"
Steve W.,"La Mirada, CA",429,79,186,5.0,10/20/2013,"Incredible experience as always. Service was excellent, the waiter was very knowledgeable about all the beers. I selected an expensive Belgium beer that was awesome! Food was delivered super fast and was absolutely delicious.  This location has less of a wait than most. We'll definitely be back."
Ruby T.,"Whittier, CA",0,4,,4.0,6/30/2015,Good service and good food! Love this place  Thanks Alex :) service was awesome  He didn't forget anything
Jilma B.,"Santa Fe Springs, CA",96,110,128,4.0,11/21/2015,"I have been coming here since the first days of opening a few yrs back.  We keep coming back because we are happy with the service, their food, and drinks!  My main dish is the Fried Calamari and Tutunka!  My new favorite dring now is the Jalapeño Margarita, Top Box!"
Brent S.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,4,,4.0,5/17/2015,"I often come here for lunch as I often work in the area. I find it to be a quick, delicious, and a fun place to come. I generally sit in the lounge and often have the pleasure of Dahlia serving us. On just my second time in she remembered my beer choice from my first visit and asked if I wanted that this time (keep in mind I'm very attractive so I'm easy to remember). Nothing is perfect so that's why they don't get 5 stars, and also it's a chain so it's not going to get a Michelin Star, but for people who have realistic expectations it's a great place to visit."
Jasmine M.,"Los Angeles, CA",30,20,7,4.0,10/3/2014,"First time eating their Jambalaya, and it was great. Pazookie is always on point. My husband had the burger, and asked for ""well done,"" but he felt it was overcooked. The wait is long, so I suggest calling ahead or using the BJs app. It makes a big difference."
Nelson F.,"Hesperia, CA",13,7,,1.0,7/10/2014,"Horrible service and the worst food I've had at a BJ's. Our waiter had no personality and no urgency to help us. Her attitude was as if she tried to call out of work and she couldn't get anyone to cover her shift and had to come in. It was 10 pm, so I tried to cut her some slack but if your employees can't perform at 100% their entire shift, don't stay open late."
Araceli M.,"Culver City, CA",3,30,43,3.0,7/18/2014,"They have awesome happy hour, good prices, plenty of options to choose from and tasty drinks. HOWEVER...... make sure you ask for the happy hour menu because they try to trick you into ordering from the regular menu while the happy hour is going on. AND they never warn you about happy hour last call.. Other than that this place is great for regular dining and good laughs.  P.s Happy Hours is ONLY in the bar Area."
Tracy M.,"Huntington Park, CA",34,21,157,5.0,7/16/2015,"Had a dinner date with my boyfriend here last week. Waited about 10 minutes to be seated, after that our server Melinda took our drinks order. My boyfriend asked if they had root beer and she informed us that BJ's actually makes their own! Along with a few other flavors of soda which included cream soda, black cherry, and orange cream. I asked her about the watermelon mojito and she informed me it was super good and refreshing. Man was she right! I couldn't believe how delicious and super refreshing it was. I would've had 3 but I decided not to overdue it lol She then without asking, brought us samples of the other soda flavors. Which was awesome of her! Our food came out in a timely manner, and was soooo delicious! I had the ravioli with sausage and pepperoni, it's definitely my new favorite dish at the moment. Dessert was delicious as always as well, and my boyfriend and I just sat there talking the night away. We were never rushed and Melinda always remained attentive. She was even sweet enough to snap a picture of us when I asked her to. Overall the entire experience was great. Excellent service, super good food, couldn't have had a better time. Thank you for everything Melinda!"
