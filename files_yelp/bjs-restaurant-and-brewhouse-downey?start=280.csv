Nicole P.,"Whittier, CA",56,35,23,2.0,12/27/2015,"When I do forget how terrible the dining service is and find myself in here I am quickly reminded why I stay away, I always get 120 waiters and all equally blah. I just don't understand. ANYWAY this time I wanted the food but not the mediocre service so I ordered online for pick up....BIG MISTAKE....upon arriving at the mall I was unable to find parking ANYWHERE the 4 spots designated for BJs takeout were taken after I circled for a half an hour I called the restaurant to see if I could just stop by the designated spots and if someone could come out (since I saw online you also offered curbside service) I had the exact payment in cash...I was told no, that I could stop directly in front of BJs and BLOCK heavy mall traffic and run inside I explained that I would not feel ok with doing that to the public! What kind of person does that. I digress. Anyway she put me on hold for several minutes and then told me I could go to an alley behind BJs and park there. I didn't feel comfortable with that either but it was a better option then blocking everyone! Luckily on the way over there some of your takeout spots opened. Unfortunately the bad experience did not stop there, one of my hamburger buns was literally drenched in VINEGAR so gross, and the mustard and mayo I requested was not on the burger so I ate it with one bun and no condiments and the Brocc Cheddar soup bowl I ordered was more of a cup. Such a ripoff. Not worth the trouble whatsoever."
Laura C.,"Bell, CA",95,76,49,5.0,8/7/2013,"Food: Something as simple as a turkey club is perfect here. Love their thin & crispy fries.  Broccoli & cheddar soup is great here but I believe only served Sun-Tues. Pizza is bomb, I personally prefer with the tomatoes on top, my bf doesnt though so more for me!!! Chicken marsala is ok. Drinks are pricy; Strawberry lemonade is great if you have a sweet tooth. Obviously the pazooki is a must for dessert (cookie with ice cream on top);my favorites are chocolate chip and red velvet. We have had issues with waiters spilling drinks etc., but for the most part they are as pleasant as possible although it is often overcrowded."
Vanessa P.,"Bell Gardens, CA",3,8,11,5.0,1/29/2015,"I give Downey BJ's five stars because every time I come the service here is excellent. Staff is always on their feet although most of them don't smile and look like they want to go home or they're annoyed. My food only took 7 minutes from when I ordered it which is not bad at all. And tonight my night was especially made because we scored such a friendly server whom I wish to serve us again next time, Tiffany! Her customer service made my day so if you come to bj's next time ask for her!"
Ambar R.,"Paramount, CA",5,104,142,2.0,11/1/2015,I love the service here never had a bad experience.Unfortunately 10/29/15 I ordered the clam chowder bread bowl and got good poison. Lesson learned.... Go to restaurants for their specialties(i.e.:bjs=pizza)
Ashley M.,"Montebello, CA",61,54,145,4.0,9/24/2013,First time here  They took almost an hour to bring my food while my while family already had there food it's a Tuesday night I didn't think it would be this crowded but I guess since they have all verity if food it's always busy especially with the mall being in the same plaza over all my food was very goo and our waiter was very nice and consistent in checking in us and making sure everything was okay I wish I knew his name
Oscar L.,"Long Beach, CA",187,81,3,2.0,11/9/2015,"Despite having great service and sports atmosphere, the overpriced food items still leave a lot to be desired. A soggy flat bread pizza and Ahi tuna with no accompanying Soy sauce or wasabi is just a tragedy. The Slip and slide restroom wasn't so much fun either. They get 2 stars for good bar service."
Sergio G.,"Norwalk, CA",43,32,2,4.0,7/16/2016,"Always impressed and appreciate the overall service at this BJs everyone is attentive and food is on point for I order. Sometime I get lucky and get a really good waitress's and bartender combo who are able to make some special requests, which makes my visit even better."
Amber V.,"Whittier, CA",165,22,2,5.0,11/18/2015,"First off let me say how much I LOVE this restaurant. Parmesan crusted chicken is my favorite meal in the world. Potato skins aren't bad either ;) me and my 5 friends went to happy hour on a Tuesday around 545 and found seating right away. Our server was amazing, her name was Raquel, highly recommend. She was fast, offered refills before we had to ask, accommodated different bills and rewards cards and did it all with a smile, never once seemed annoyed or overwhelmed with our group. She was on it, anything we needed she had already anticipated and had it ready. This was probably my best experience at bjs so far, everyone at my table recognized her amazing service, thanks Raquel!"
Dee W.,"Paramount, CA",227,368,146,5.0,11/25/2012,"ALWAYS GREAT SERVICE & GREAT GRUB!!!!! Drinks could be a little stronger, but I guess I'll just bring my flask next time!!!!"
Alex C.,"Montebello, CA",0,5,,5.0,8/20/2014,Wonderful service!!! Best food!!! It's honestly my FAVORITE restaurant.  Bjs never fails!!! I always order the gourmet Mac and cheese!!! Aaaand the buffalo chicken pizza... Can't forget the best part!!!... Pazookie. Hot cookie with ice cream!!! Yum!!
Jessica A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,2/22/2016,First time going and I honestly thought the service would be better. Spent 15 -20 minutes waiting for each drink ordered. (I had 2) and the beer Guinness was really watered down and tasted more like coffee than beer. After about an hour or so my friends and I left. Definitely not worth what was paid. Never going again.
Carmen R.,"Downey, CA",113,11,31,5.0,7/27/2014,"Place to be on a summer night,  food and drinks are great. I can get full just off their appetizers."
Steven C.,"Los Angeles, CA",23,61,57,4.0,11/15/2015,Don't be afraid of their brunch! The breakfast is awesome. Have a mimosa and enjoy NFL Ticket on Sundays.
Gwyn S.,"Bellflower, CA",0,18,,1.0,1/14/2016,"I'm giving a one star only because I have to.  Customer Service sucks atnthis establishment. My co worker treated me to lunch today and preordered on the phone for pickup and was told it would be ready in 15 minutes.  When she arrived the order wasn't ready and the fries were missing and the person assisting her said fries didn't come with that special.  Another co worker and son also went today and walked out after 15 minutes of waiting for someone to come their the table. What is it with this restaurant seems like you don't  have enough staff to assist patrons? Employees and managers need to be trained properly so you don't miss out on customers,mm just saying!"
Herbin M.,"Bell Gardens, CA",0,17,,4.0,5/31/2016,"Try a beer called snakebite I was surprised of how good it was, plus it looks really cool!"
Noe ..,"Lomita, CA",274,119,17,1.0,10/18/2015,My wife and are currently here sat  at our booth for over 10 mins no one ecen offered us a drink or took our order I had to get up and and ask for a manager to finally send us a waitress who was a host smh this is ridiculous
Jazzy V.,"Whittier, CA",54,100,304,5.0,4/20/2014,"There are FEW times where your drinks come out in under two minutes! And our server, David, was ON POINT! With me being extremely indecisive, he had to come around like 3 times before he could take our drink orders.. BUT each time he came by, he was just as courteous and patient as the first time. And he didn't disappear for a long period of time like most servers do. The timing was pretty perfect and I feel it was perfectly well spaced out! It's a kinda creepy-genius-this-guy-is-brilliant kind of thing. Enough time to leave you alone and think, but not too long to make you wonder if he got kidnapped or something (let's be real, here. You're all familiar with servers going MIA while you make your decisions.). Anyway, we seriously got our drinks (a beer and a strawberry mojito that will make you experience true love.) within 2 minutes! On a Saturday night! With a full house! It was fantastic!! Our appeteaser (stuffed mushrooms) was scrumptious! And came out at a decently quick time. Then we decided to also get some boneless wings to devour before ordering some food! They have a nice variety of types of sauces for the wings, and we chose an order of the teriyaki and an order of the garlic Parmesan. My goodness, those wings were delicious!!! The teriyaki had a slight kick of spiciness, yet sweetness, and had a very unique flavor, and the garlic Parmesan ones were really good! By this time we ordered another beer, which AGAIN came to the table in like a minute, and we also finally decided on a pizza.. Half buffalo chicken, and half 5 meat! Everything was so great!! Our food, and especially our drinks, came quickly and finished quickly, haha. David was really REALLY attentive the whole time, but definitely not too constant, making sure we were doing fine and that we had everything we needed. I was seriously blown away by how efficient he was!! When I was offered to have my water refilled it took like 30 seconds for him to come back with some. That rarely happens! I'm used to choking on my food and almost dying before getting my water refilled (at least at other places, but certainly not here tonight!!), and again, I'm sure many of you are familiar with the horrible service most people give. But not here! It was SUPERB and awesome service from David and great food. And that mojito!!!!!! I can't get it out of my head! Fresh muddled strawberries and mint, mmmm mmm mmmmm!!! It's a must try if you like fresh drinks with a slightly sweet note! Shoutout to David for being so efficient and friendly! When I go back, I will request having him as our server!! Happy eating! And drinking ;)"
Richard C.,"Santa Fe Springs, CA",227,68,15,3.0,11/15/2015,"This restaurant in general has enjoyable food, great selection of drinks, and a relaxing and fun atmosphere.  This particular BJ I've been coming to for years with family and friends, and each time has been a great time.  Eat light before coming if you want the best of their appetizers like calamari (highly recommend), their pizza, their delicious sandwiches or burgers, and their drinks.  Service is also on point every time, as well as polite and occasionally funny!  Though I almost never go into the mall it's located at, this BJ restaurant is still great."
Rell E.,"Los Angeles, CA",352,239,45,4.0,5/2/2014,"The server had a bit of an attitude, but I got over her really quickly once I saw the gluten-free friendly items on the menu. :) yaay! Gluten-free pizookies on the menu! Even gluten-free pizza, hooray!!!  I ended up ordering one of my faves, the BBQ chicken chopped salad which is gluten free anyway. Next time I will try the pizookie and pizza, can't wait! Also impressive was the handcrafted soda options made with beet sugar and natural flavors. I ordered the root beer.  I'm so used to places having the same old soda fountains sweetened with high fructose corn syrup--YUCK!!!!  So I'll be putting BJs back into my lunch break rotation for sure! Good job!!!!"
Evelyn V.,"Whittier, CA",0,3,,5.0,4/15/2016,Marisa was a great waitress. She made mine and my friends experience great. She made us feel welcomed and kept making sure we were good and needed anything else which I loved. Very friendly and funny
