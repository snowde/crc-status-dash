Susan G.,"Long Beach, CA",0,1,,5.0,11/8/2015,"Went here today for brunch and football.  The menu selections, while not extensive, were solid.  My husband had the pancake combo, and I have to say, the pancakes were spot on. Fluffy and tasty!  I had the two egg combo and, when it came to our table, the eggs were hard (ordered over medium) and the sausage was cold.  Our server, Natalie, was really swamped (in fact, she was the only server I saw for a while, but, as it wasn't too packed, not a problem, especially since we weren't in a rush), but she took care of it very quickly, with a smile and a promise to make it right.  Well, she certainly did!  My plate was back very quickly, delivered by a manager, who was also very nice and apologetic.  It was perfect!  Thanks to Natalie's great attitude and excellent service, we will definitely be back for brunch!"
Danny S.,"South Gate, CA",4,4,,1.0,11/5/2015,"Worst customer service I have ever experienced. The waiter was so rude, he showed no interest in wanting to serve us."
Andy T.,"Bell, CA",24,73,35,4.0,6/29/2014,My waitress went outtah her way to make sure i enjoyed my first time at this place so i guess they deserve the rateing food was great lots of flavor really good hand crafted sodas
Janelly B.,"Encino, Los Angeles, CA",2,5,9,1.0,3/30/2014,"1 Star! Terrible service! The server was ridiculously unmannered, she was always forgetting what we asked for. She would smile, roll her eyes and turn away. Our food was brought out an hour-and-half late and cool. I've been to a few BJ restaurants and I've never been treated like this!  We were given TWO $25 gift cards and mind you there were five of us. We weren't looking for a hand out, the apology simply wasn't sincere. LESSON 1- Don't throw money at people!! We left the gift cards on the table! I will not be returning, it's no wonder as to why they have poor service. It's the management!"
Moe S.,"Breistroff-la-Grande, France",3,69,4,4.0,8/13/2015,"I love this place, there food is good but there pizzas are great!, they have a very big variety so it takes time just to look through the menu itself, the service was very friendly and helpful when asked, but they don't really check up on us very often, the place is nice and comfortable booths over all nice place to eat"
Yuvizela M.,"Bell, CA",95,29,55,4.0,6/29/2014,"MMMmmmmm Bj's... Love their flat bread appetizers, love all of their apps actually. Love the pizza, love the beer, love the atmosphere. Just all around awesome place.  Now, this BJ's in particular is located outside of the Stonewood Mall, so if you go during lunch rush good luck with parking. The service here is great on weekday afternoons, not so much towards closing or the weekend rushes... Sometimes they have their ups, but not as often, from what ive experienced.  Sometimes me and my family just go to BJ's for dessert. PAZOOOKIES! A Pazookie is the best desert ever, warm delicious cookie topped with delightful ice cream. NOM Nom NOM!!! Yea. 10/10 would definitely recommend. Get the Party Pazookie if there is more then 6 people in your group. ^___^"
Alejandra T.,"Downey, CA",7,26,20,5.0,8/18/2014,"Food is always on point! Our waiter was a little on the not so friendly side, but Emily who job is to deliver the food to tables was Awesome!! Super friendly kept checking on us and also very funny. My husband and I wanted her to join our party great customer service Emily!! Make this girl a waitress please!"
Tonya S.,"Downey, CA",16,1,,1.0,12/20/2015,"Came here tonight for my husband's birthday. Service was great but the food was so disappointing. We spent a lot of money ($70!) but walked out hungry. Our favorite, the avocado spring rolls, have changed drastically- much smaller than before. We ordered 2 pizzas, both came out lukewarm at best, one of them had hardly any toppings and no cheese!!! This place used to be a favorite of ours! I mentioned these problems to the kitchen manager who just said ""thanks for letting me know."" I didn't get the impression that he really cared about our experience. It kind of ruined my husband's birthday dinner, we just wanted to get out of there. Not planning to return."
Karen H.,"Bellflower, CA",0,3,,1.0,6/21/2016,"Worst service of any BJ's I've been. Management is poor and unconcerned about complaint. Orders were wrong, salads came out with no dressing . requested dressing several times before it came. Waitress very rude after we spoke with manager."
Jacqueline O.,"Huntington Park, CA",0,7,,3.0,11/27/2015,"I never have any problem when i dine in.  the problem is when i order to-go.  my husband love the pizookie.  we usually order one once a week.  and i noticed that there is a pattern.  every time we order one 1-2 hours before closing time, they always screw up the cookie, we've had over baked and under baked cookies! and on top of that, there is an inconsistency with the amount of ice cream we get.  they really need to fix that."
Jasmine M.,"Long Beach, CA",128,43,26,4.0,3/29/2016,"I love this place at happy hour, me and my friends will come here and just wreck it from 3-7 we find us a seat at the bar and make sure to enjoy a couple beers. I think I have come here more just to drink than I have to order food. The bartenders are super funny and are ready to serve you up another drink as soon as you are looking empty. I enjoy it when my bartenders give suggestions or tips on what to try or how to get the most out of your money. One of the bartenders asked if we wanted to try mixing beers and I thought to myself well that doesn't sound good. But whatever we went for it and it was pretty good, I can't remember what it was of course but it was a mix of two of their brews all the workers knew about it so it must have been an insider things. Also, we were a couple beers in when the bartender mentioned to us that it would be a little cheaper if we were to order a pitcher which would give us about 3 and and half beers and that way we could just go and chill for a bit. So we tried that, I appreciated that tip. I think we were really into trying a couple different brews though so we just stuck to ordered our beers separately. So anyways if you want to have a chill afternoon and drink some beer for cheap this happy hour is the way to go I just like the overall look of the bar itself too like the area surrounding it is so inviting it makes me want to stay longer!!"
Luzia D.,"Lynwood, CA",11,35,42,5.0,5/29/2014,"I went to this location with friends. Tgeir service is great. I honestly don't remember our waitress name name. I think it was stephanie she had red hair and was very nice and driendly. She had freat customer service. We went on a busy Friday night and eventhough it was busy she still managed to be checking up on us to see if we needed refills or anythings else. Their food is okay and their dessert and drinks are delicious. I'm giving this place 5 stars because of our waitress. She had phenominal customer service. Restaurants should have more people like her. She was outgoing and she seemed like if she enjoyed her job. I really wished O could remember her name. You should definately try their pizookie. I have only went to BJ's a few times, and I always get the pizookie for dessert. Its a must."
Cindy G.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,5,,4.0,10/1/2015,It was out our first time here at this restaurant and it was a awesome experience! Friendly staff and great service! Plus the food was amazing!
Sarina F.,"Los Angeles, CA",94,101,48,3.0,3/16/2016,Ate here about two weeks ago. Food is always great and my husband and I visit different locations all over Southern California. Our server was very friendly and gave great service. There were a few things that happened out of her control. We ordered appetizer and entrees and he ordered a cocktail. The drink came really late like literally 30 seconds before the food. The food showed up and we didn't have the calamari delivered yet. He ordered ribs and I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. The calamari came after the food. Our server offered to take the appetizer back and off the check if we were unhappy that it didn't come first. We told her it was ok. I was not looking but my husband took a bite of calamari and a black long hair had been breaded inside and he pulled it out. We called our server and she immediately apologized and even offered to buy us dessert from her own money. We declined because the restaurant should do that. Not her. It was absolutely disgusting. One of the managers (seemed like from the kitchen) came out to our table and apologized and they took the calamari off the check. However we had left some of our asparagus side from the ribs on the plate so that got thrown away (we were sharing). The ribs however were tender and juicy and my spaghetti meatballs were a nice portion. It was enjoyable because I was with my husband and the rest of the food was great but we didn't really think it was handled properly.
Jay R.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,10,1,5.0,4/29/2016,"I come here very often and I had the pleasure of meeting Gerald. He is awesome, I will be ask for his section now!"
Steve L.,"Santa Monica, CA",143,1190,17,4.0,3/5/2012,"Came here with the family, forgetting that there was a Lakers game on... Figured it wouldn't be too crowded for lunch at about 2:30... Luckily the game was heading into the 4th quarter, and we didn't have to wait too long. This seems to be the meet up spot in Downey now, as it looked like EVERYONE was here.  Parking made it look a bit like that too.  Servers were all pretty nice, though they were a bit on the slower side with most things.  Something about our group of 6 must have made it look like 5 as we only got 5 of everything.   We eventually all got what we needed, had plenty of good food too.  If we didnt' have a birthday cake waiting at home, we would definitely have had a pizookie... Another day... :)"
Shawn T.,"Harrisburg, PA",0,2,,5.0,9/18/2015,"5 stars for service alone! I travel for work a lot! I'm alone , so I sit at the bar. The bartenders were all amazing! Very informative about the beer be the menu. I've eaten here twice so far and will again, as I'm here here for another week. The food is very good, ms the beer is great! I recommend the Jeremiah Red. It's unbelievable!"
Eli L.,"Downey, CA",45,41,11,3.0,8/6/2015,This place is aight. I like the pizza there. And the cookie ice cream thing. Other than that it's an okay place idk tho
Sigi M.,"Whittier, CA",94,30,86,5.0,1/4/2014,"The staff was great food was delicious. Amanda, Omar and the Mgr Lisa were amazing, great hosts. Thank you thank you for making my moms bday celebration a good one for her. Sincerely  The Morales-Garcia Family"
Uncle L.,"VALLEY VILLAGE, CA",228,98,,2.0,5/8/2014,"Ate their on Cinco De Drinko. Service was abysmal, took 20 minutes for our order, about a half hour to actually get our drinks. We both got a simple appetizer and each one took 20 minutes each. (Spinach/artichoke dip, and calamari) It was busy for a Monday but not insane busy, and even after it died down the waiter just systematically ignored our table for whatever reason. Would make eye contact, and then just look away. It's too goddamn bright in this BJ's too, I don't like the atmosphere, it was like a surgical theater. I generally like BJ's and the food is good, but this location stunk."
