Maria B.,"Downey, CA",117,367,217,2.0,2/9/2015,"This Brewhouse serves up TERRIBLE SERVICE! I've been reluctant in writing a review because I want to like coming to BJs. I enoy the sports theme bar atmosphere but the service staff is really just not up to par. I have a better time at Elephant Bar. This our third visit and my daughter asked for a pepperoni pizza with no sauce, THIRD TIME THEY BRING THE PIZZA with extra sauce no pepperoni. How hard is that people? Now we all have our meal except my daughter waiting for her pizza - that wasn't even rushed apparently. We gave it our third and last shot."
paige f.,"Whittier, CA",14,124,47,2.0,5/2/2015,Slow service. Got an order wrong and it took forever to bring out the correct one. Pizza is ok. Avoid if you can.
Patrizia R.,"Temple City, CA",86,52,259,1.0,5/16/2015,"I would give this location no stars if I could. Let me tell you our HORRIBLE (10X) experience in this particular BJ's. The first time BJ's was a disappoint considering I've/we've always been a fan/s. I believe this is a long overdue review since this nightmare happened last Mother's Day, May 10th. I wouldn't want to think that Mother's Day happens to be a very busy day or that weekend per se has been very busy which explains why the service & everything about it was poor (not even mediocre). That should never be an excuse for any establishment after all. The negativity of this visit was just one after another. It's like being shot with a series of bullets until you end up being completely dead since the situation never got better & they weren't able to alleviate the situation either. So here it goes: - We're a group of 6 & 4 of my friends have already placed their orders except for me & my husband. Server took them all & told her that ours will be to follow as I do not intend to eat anyway. Just deciding on what to drink. - Server came back a few mins later & my hubby placed his order too. Told her I still needed time since mine was just a drink & she could proceed with the rest of the group's meals. She asked too if she could go on & have everything ready for the rest of them & the response was clear as sky, ""Yes go on & have them ready"". - Server came back with my hubby's meal (which btw was placed at a later time than the rest of the group) & took/noted the drink I've decided to have. - Server came back with my drink but still without everyone's plates. - Hubby was almost finished with his meal when the rest of the food came (40mins tops).  - My friend who was extremely hungry by then b/c of the tremendous amount of wait time, received his order of Shrimp Alfredo WITHOUT SHRIMP or anything on it for that matter, just the white sauce. - Extremely disappointed b/c of this my friend called the server & told her about the plate w/o anything on it considering they had to wait for THAT long. My friend continued with her tirade mentioning that she doesn't understand why me & my hubby got ours first when we placed ours way later than theirs - To make matters worse, the server who obviously wasn't trained to provide favorable customer service, argued that the reason for the delay was because we (my hubby & I) took so much time to decide on what to eat or drink - (she was pointing at us) - Was too tired & defeated to react & tell her that she was told to proceed with everyone else's meals earlier on - She should realize herself that the proper way of dealing with customers is NEVER to blame them for their establishment's inefficiency anyway - All of us were on the same page. Too tired to care or bother. We weren't the irate customers who would've lambasted the catty server - Dinner went on peacefully & nobody talked about the failed shrimp alfredo until my other friend found a TOOTHPICK in her salad! Luckily she wasn't like me who normally doesn't look at what she's eating & would continue on poking leaves & ingesting it in her system. (I wish I took a picture but we were so defeated, disgusted, dumbfounded by what we saw & didn't realize the picture could've been handy for Yelp) - Luckily she took her time to eat & looked through what goes on in her plate. Otherwise she could've ingested a sharp toothpick (used? hope not) & God knows what's going to happen in her stomach  - We called the manager to complain. Told them about the series of letdowns. He apologized & told us that he sort of knew about the situation b/c the server told him that she felt that the whole dining experience already started off on the wrong foot. (Of course we were all like? What kind of an excuse was that?) - My friend no longer needs to pay for the disgusting salad she had but her nightmare didn't end there. She took my glass of water earlier & just when she's about to consume all of it, she found a dead bug floating in it!! DISGUSTING on so many levels! I was lucky she wanted my glass as I would've ended up drinking the entire thing w/o realizing there was a bug in it!  - We called up the manager UHHGEN.. & this time, we told him that none of us are going to pay for this dinnernightmare we just went through. He apologized & said he'll see what he can do. When he came back, we only paid for the alcoholic beverages my hubby & I had. - I wasn't happy that we still had to pay for something. I honestly feel that their establishment did not deserve a single dime from us. I thought if we complained about terrible customer service b/c the server BLAMED our drinks for the delay of the other meals, then our whole bill will be entirely free!  - And to add more insult to injury (while everyone in our group is still in the heat of the moment) our server came back acting as if nothing happened (no apology whatsoever), asked us if we WANTED BOXES! We were like what?! Box for the salad with a toothpick in it? Are you serious?! Haha that was dumbTERRIBLE"
Jennie C.,"Chino Hills, CA",52,76,44,2.0,3/20/2016,"This is a tough one. I went here as part of paint nite. I love BJ'S so I skipped out on dinner so that I could eat and drink here. Bad mistake. Paint nite has about 20 people there and two waiters to service all the people. I understand that the poor waiters are overwhelmed but as soon as we got their we asked for the happy hour specials, the waitress mumbled through them and I didn't want to be rude so I asked her to repeat them. My other friend couldn't understand her at all so then she asked a question about a special, the waitress Danielle asked us ""are you going to listen now?"" Ugh yes we are. Whatever she never smiled and then a nice make waiter was switched with her. Enough not to tip her but it only got worse. We got our drinks and food almost at the end of the paint session, many mix ups with our food but the worst was when another friend asked for a spoon like 3 times, never got it so she stood up and went searching for one, a random waiter Andrew Ponce goes up to her and tells her ""here is your fucking spoon."" How rude! Food was delicious and my beer was nice and cold but the service was horrible. I worked in customer service for years so I really expect good or decent customer service. I'm glad the chino hills one has a better staff than Downey."
Alex F.,"Downey, CA",0,6,,5.0,5/6/2016,"I like this place overall. Been here serval times but rarely do I write a review. Only reason why I am writing one today is to give feedback to our wonderful server Dylan. My girls and I walked in, got seated faster than usual. The only problem with that was that we waited around 25 min with no server until Dylan noticed us and asked if we had been served yet. Since we told him how long we waited and that we were upset he said he would be more than happy to serve us for the rest of the night. The food was great and our drinks were on point. Thanks to our server we were able to get the BJ service I had expected. Dylan you were amazing & I hope that by this review you get a bonus for the excellent service you provided since we saw how many other tables you served aside from us. Good job!"
Stephanie T.,"Long Beach, CA",2,10,,3.0,8/28/2015,"We came for my best friends birthday dinner and our server was horrible. She took forever to bring us water and was not attentive at all. Vanessa G did not take care of us and she even got one of the orders wrong. She also took forever to check how much money my gift card contained, took forever to bring the boxes, and brought out our desserts super duper late! Don't recommend her! Other than that the food was great!"
Luis R.,"Long Beach, CA",0,13,,5.0,10/16/2015,Great service at the bar. Alec the bartender is very knowledgeable and always recommends the best beers. Service in the general dining area is pretty hit and miss.
Daniel R.,"Bell, CA",75,1,,1.0,12/28/2015,"This place has a huge service problem. I've tried to enjoy a meal here on three separate occasions and I have been met with frustration and disappointment. My family and I came to here for my sister's birthday because we were hungry and Lock and Key didn't open until 5pm. I thought ""Maybe it'll be different this time. Maybe we will have decent service."" I could not have been more wrong. The beginning of our meal was met with average service. Then the servers switched out for lunch and we stopped being served. We ordered two pizzas and they arrived at the table without silverware or plates. My entire family sat in silence as we waited for a someone (anyone)/59 bring plates so that we did not appear to be savages. I even contemplated getting up and grabbing the damn plates myself. The server kept apologizing and offering excuses but I didn't come here for excuses. I came here to celebrate my sister's birthday. My sister had turned 21 and we ordered a lemon drop shot. 30 minutes later, a lemon drop martini arrived after we had finished our food. Do not eat here unless you want to sit at a booth for an hour while servers ignore you and bring you the wrong food."
Maria B.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,26,2,1.0,3/14/2015,"The appetizers were brought 5 minutes before the food... :( I had to ask the waitress about the Pepsi refill as she forgot, the worst part is we ordered a vegetarian lasagna and they mixed them up, so one of us didn't get the food until everyone was finished and the other didn't get any sausage on their lasagna. It was a stressful dinner and I think the chicken Parmesan is processed......will never return. They didn't even comp the late mixup lasagna......they comped the cheaper dessert and saved themselves money, this place needs Chef Ramsey....and the waiter that brought the food out was really sweaty....yuck :("
Jesus G.,"Los Angeles, CA",16,38,30,4.0,4/19/2014,"It was my first time going to BJ's and I must say it was pretty damn good. I had the Bacon Cheeseburger with Wedged Potatoes. I also had a Piranha Pale Ale which was pretty damn good. I saw they had a double IPA, next time I go I'm definitely gonna try that one!"
Beth A.,"Los Angeles, CA",34,18,48,5.0,2/15/2015,Tiffany was our server and she was amazing!! We will definitely be coming back to sit In her section! Oh and the cantina chicken tavern cut pizza is a must try!!
Erica B.,"Bell Gardens, CA",40,56,64,2.0,2/13/2015,The ambience in this place is terrible. It's so loud you can barely hear the person in front of you. In addition to that the service isn't very well thought out. Most restaurants bring  a new glass for every new drink you have instead of reusing the same one causing the waiter to have to reach over and grab the glasses every time this is exceedingly annoying and distracting. The food is okay but not worth the annoyance.
Miguel R.,"Los Angeles, CA",643,894,860,4.0,9/25/2011,"It is what it is.... Beer food and guffaws and guffaws and beer food....maybe even a cackle or two....I never cease to look around for these public displays of beer cheer when I come to any BJ's. Blame it on the beer.... Four stars for great customer service. The host was really cool. Really enthusiastic and friendly. Like as if he were BJ himself! Is there really a BJ out there? Or is BJ the name of some millionaire's dog maybe? Anyway, the server was really cute and nice. I'm sure her attractiveness really sells stuff for BJ him/her/itself. Minus one star for sitting us in the back haha!!!! The place was not full. I do notice when I get seated way in the back and far away from windows....ugh!!!! Plus the TV was behind me and the nearest ones were too far or were not at the right angle.... There was a really good soccer game on too...ugh.... The food is always good to accompany your beer with at any BJ's. However, I am no fan of American beer food so I am not really rating that. I won't even bother.   It is what it is...."
Susie P.,"Baldwin Park, CA",0,6,,5.0,4/19/2016,"I frequent this BJs a lot, so I'm always happy when the new menu items come in and always saddened by the ones that leave (Cajun Pasta). But today I don't want to talk about food, I want to talk about service! I had the lovely pleasure of being helped by Adrian. I was completely BLOWN AWAY with his service and sincerity. It's not very often that someone takes the time to actually get to know you. He had me laughing the whole night and made sure that I was always satisfied when he went to go check on his other customers. I could even hear the other people laughing right across from me so I know I wasn't the only one. By the end of my visit here at BJs I was saying goodbye to a new friend, but it won't be too long before I get to catch up with him at BJs again. Thank you Adrian, and the management staff for hiring such a delightful person. I hope Adrian moves to a 5 start restaurant, because that's where he truly belongs."
Mark B.,"Downey, CA",356,61,348,5.0,2/4/2014,I just had another awesome dinner at BJ's tonight server Henry Eric Shannon and Marissa totally awesome today I would say wow for my ultimate dining experience
Denise Q.,"South Gate, CA",3,9,5,4.0,6/14/2015,"Great food, great drinks, good service and good price. This is a nice place for a first date, for a special event or just to hang out and unwind with friends over some drinks. The place has a great atmosphere and everything is very clean. The wait time is a little long but that is expected on the weekends. I recommend this restaurant"
Catherine J.,"Downey, CA",35,23,6,1.0,9/1/2013,"This review is based on the most recent dining experience I had with my family. Previous experiences were always great but this time around my mother found something in her food that caused her to bleed.  When we got to this location, there wasn't much of a wait and not very many people. We were a party of six and we were seated in the middle of the aisle where two tables were pushed together. There were plenty of booths open and we felt incredibly squished in-between this aisle where customers were passing through as well as the servers.  We asked for a booth but apparently they were saving them for some customers that just walked which in that case, we should have been seated there first.  Anyway, on to the food. We all ordered different items but I'm going to speak specifically about what was found in my dads portion of onion strings. Now, my dad had not tried his onion strings yet but my mom grabbed the first bite of the finger food.  As she bit into the onion string, she bit into something hard. Then she spit out what she was chewing and revealed what looked like a piece of rock. As we looked closer, it had the color of ceramic so we thought she might have just broken her tooth. She was still complaining about a pain in her gums so I decided to accompany her to the restroom. That's when she pulled out another piece of ceramic that was stuck in the back of her gums. Then she started bleeding. We made sure to check if it wasn't a broken tooth and it wasn't so we returned to the table and I called the manager over.  We showed her the piece of ceramic and the damage that had occurred to my mom and she went to the back kitchen to speak to the staff. Once she left, we found more pieces of ceramic on my mothers plate and kept them to show the manager. When she came back, she told us it looked like a piece of tooth and we told her it wasn't because we already checked to make sure. We told her it looked like pieces of broken plate because the color of the ceramic was the same color as the plates that they use to serve their food. We told her that she should be aware that they are discarding broken plates right away and not serving anything to a customer if something had been broken.  She made my mom file a report because there was blood involved and she comped some of our dishes for us. We hope to never find anymore hazardous material in our food or to any other customers as it could potentially kill someone if they swallowed a piece of broken ceramic.  Be aware of the onion strings."
Alex M.,"Laguna Hills, CA",7,54,14,5.0,4/8/2015,Been to many BJ's before & this one was a great experience.  The staff was extremely friendly & the food was perfect.  Will definitely come back again
Patricia D.,"Big Bear Lake, CA",29,9,1,1.0,6/3/2015,They have good food here but the service is horrible!!! The waiters passed by you  a couple of times and ignore you. I should've learned my lesson. They did this to me 2 yrs ago and they did it to me again. I gave them a chance but their service really SUCKS!
Nicole H.,"Glendale, CA",0,15,6,3.0,5/31/2015,This place is all over the place. Yesterday we made reservations for 7pm and when people arrived my party told me they said the reservation wasn't until 7:30 and that's that I had gone early in the morning to drop off a cake and we told the host that it was for 7 pm. Also we spoke to the manager asking about how we can split the check and etc and they told us they can only split it 2 ways. When we were there they said it didn't matter how we split the check honestly most frustrating thing ever. Seemed like everyone was on a different page here.
