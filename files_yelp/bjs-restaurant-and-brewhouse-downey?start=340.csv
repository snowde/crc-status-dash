Craig C.,"Los Alamitos, CA",8,13,,1.0,11/20/2014,"I've been coming here since it opened. Food is always consistent and I put up with the average service. Yesterday is my last day there!  I had a business meeting there. After we were sat, it took 30 minutes to come and take our drink order. We had to complain to manager twice just to have someone take our order. To top it off, we had our bill ready to pay for 20 minutes until they finally picked it up when we could get our waitresses attention. Manager didn't care to apologize in person."
Ro M.,"Bell Gardens, CA",0,3,,1.0,5/1/2016,"Customer service is just terrible, our waiter was just terrible, didnt even stop by to check if we needed anything, our drinks were empty and we had to stop someone elses waiter to get serviced. Then the waiter finally showed up and said he was going to take a break and brought us another waiter who was going to take over. Never recommending this place."
Mr. M S.,"South Gate, CA",0,3,,3.0,6/28/2015,A 3-star because of the drinks/food but they need to work on customer service!!   Waited for 10mins before I had to wave down a bar tender for drinks.
Antonious W.,"Bell, CA",6,17,,1.0,3/14/2016,"I went in here on Friday afternoon around 3:30 with my gal and this place had some of the worst service I've ever received. First off it took about 15 for us to have our order taken and that was only as a result of me flagging down the bus boy who was nice enough to take our order. When the waitress finally graced us with her presence and confirmed our order she left without asking if we wanted drinks, which i later had to flag her down for. Our order was simple...queso dip and chips, two coffees and the Pizookie trio: peanut butter, salted caramel and monkey bread. The queso dip made it to our table along with our two coffees that were accompanied by four cute little creamers. (Four creamers for two coffees...really? ) As for the Pizookie trio...at least they got one out of three correct, and my impression was that it's a common mistake because the waitress knew which flavors they mistakenly included. Maybe Bj's name comes from the fact that their service blows. I can't even imagine how terrible the service must be during their busy hours."
erick P.,"Los Angeles, CA",44,28,,2.0,9/28/2013,"Horrible experience, was there on a thursday night we called in ahead and checked in with them when we arrived. They said it would be a 15-30 minute wait, had not been here in a while so we decided to wait it out. what was  a 30 minute was 70 minutes wait instead. Around the 45 minute mark I went back to see if we were close and by the looks on their faces we were not even on their list (despite having the pager). We stuck it out and said we would be next, it took another good 20 minutes.  Our food experience was not so great either. We were greeted by a very rude waiter. The food took forever for only 4 us and just a pizza meal.  When our waiter left on break our waitress Shannon was much more attentive."
Aaron A.,"Downey, CA",17,18,1,1.0,4/6/2015,"I went in today for lunch... the bar section was fairly empty and they still managed to take approximately 40 min to bring me ""hot wings"" that were crispy burnt. When I showed the bar server; she said it would take some time before I could get my order again. I guess the cooks woke up in a bad mood... NEGATIVE 2 STARS"
Phyliss L.,"Paramount, CA",19,17,13,1.0,4/3/2015,Made a phone call to see if they had call ahead seating. A recording assured me that it was accepted until I spoke to your hostess    Who informed me that service was for party's of three. Not thirteen as what I called for.  4-3-2015. Thanks BJ's
Jocelyn G.,"Flagstaff, AZ",8,79,54,4.0,11/1/2014,"Food was really good! However, we waited over an hour for our food. The restaurant was busy but an hour wait seems a little extreme. Our waiter was really nice though and gave us free breadsticks lol"
Daphne N.,"West Covina, CA",0,1,,5.0,3/26/2016,"My family from out of town and I went to this location. The food was decent and the atmosphere was mediocre but what really made our visit enjoyable was our server, Rocky P. She really made our stay enjoyable and really kicked our visit up a notch. Well be visiting very soon."
Diana M.,"Downey, CA",98,64,30,5.0,2/15/2015,I love bjs no matter what locations there alcoholic drinks are always on point there food is delicious and appetizers are really good. That homemade cookie with ice cream thou yum can't get enough of that.
Jackoo A.,"Downey, CA",9,13,,2.0,9/15/2014,"i really love their food but they have really bad service, every time i go i tell myself  it's going to be better service this time but nope, i really want to say they give bad service due to the fact that they are always busy."
Lyzz M.,"Victorville, CA",0,13,10,2.0,11/23/2014,"This is my first and last experience at BJ's because I'm never going back. When we arrived it took us 40 minutes to get seated. After we were seated it took 15 minutes to get our waters and 30 minutes to get our drinks. We ordered about 45 minutes after being seated. The service was so slow. We got our appetizers 45 minutes after we ordered. We ordered the Ahi Poke and Vegetable and Goat Cheese flat bread pizza. We got our food 15 minutes after our appetizers and it was most definitely not worth the wait. My friend ordered lasagna and I ordered the Cajun shrimp pasta. Horrible. Her food tasted like it came out of a can and mine was so bland and had no flavor at all. I actually asked the waitress to take it back and all they did was add more sauce. It was really bad. We ordered a total of two piña coladas, two appetizers(the best part of the meal), and two entrees and it all came out to $60. The service was horrible and so was the food(except the appetizers. Those were really good.)."
Eder P.,"Los Angeles, CA",357,608,122,4.0,6/16/2011,The only bad thing? The wait time to be seated and the hordes of brown folk at the bar being loud cause they can't afford cable and wanna seem cool. Other than that this place is awesome. Servers are always happy and the food always comes quick.  The drinks are always awesome. Never a dull one in the bunch. I've never ate anything that I regretted ordering either.
Kristina B.,"Los Angeles, CA",164,62,1,2.0,10/28/2014,"I came here last night for dinner and waited 15-20min for a table for 2. Once seated, we waited another 10min for our server to show up. Lucky for us, we had a TRAINEE! Nothing I love more than an already slow service about to be even slower. We ordered everything all at once to make it as easy as possible on us. My water came fairly quickly. My friend ordered a Perrier, which took about 5min to get (really people, all you're doing is opening a bottle and pouring it into a cup). Our food came, which was typical BJs quality, so no complaints there. Overall, our experience was extremely slow and I won't be going back to that location. I understand that everyone needs to be trained, however, your dinner rush is NOT the time to do so. Stick to training during opening and slower times."
Adriana A.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,6,1,1.0,11/2/2014,I always come to bjs and have always had great food but tonight I had a chicken Caesar salad and it was rotten and the manager still charged me for the rotten salad  I wouldn't come to bjs anymore
RoRo P.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,178,4,2.0,3/9/2015,Horrible BJ's. Their service is extremely slow for seating and service. Their staff on a Friday night was very sluggish and unfriendly. Definitely not coming back ever!!!!! 2 stars because their food was not too shabby.
Wendy F.,"Bell Gardens, CA",0,11,5,5.0,2/24/2016,"The costumer service here is great every time I go!!! The servers offer great tips on appetizers and drinks, they are quick, and they check up on you often without being annoying. The drinks are also really good every time I go. Really recommend this location."
Maury R.,"Fullerton, CA",116,5,4,1.0,5/9/2014,Way to slow of service. They actually forgot to bring me one of my appetizers and still charged me for it!!
Ariel M.,"Huntington Park, CA",331,443,198,4.0,12/9/2011,"I LOVE BJ's. Their food, service, and ambiance. I thought I already reviewed this place but, what the hell.  Parking is horrific at this location and now that the Wild Wings spot has opened up, it's even worse. This is a large location though and is always packed on a game night. You can call ahead which is great to place your name on the list but sometimes you still gotta wait.  The outdoor seating is comfy for all weather, well except windy, but they cover the sides with a clear plastic tarp so it downs;t get too hold, and they have heated lamps in the ceiling.  Food's really good overall. I've had nachos, pizza, tomato bisque, salads, sandwiches, plenty of beer variety, oh and that hand crafted Root Beer is really tasty. So this place can actually satisfy any hunger and they have a great variety to eat and drink from. The service is really good too. After all the times I've been here I've never had a problem to harp about."
Terry M.,"Lynwood, CA",131,187,511,4.0,11/10/2013,"My family and I usually come on Sundays and we've never waited more than 30 min. The waiters are nice and thorough. The food is always tasty. It's a big place so noise level is a little high but it's not something that would keep me from coming here. The restrooms are always clean. I'm glad they put this restaurant in this location. Now they have a rewards plan too and we just got a coupon for 19.95 for 2 people, drink, entree, and desert."
