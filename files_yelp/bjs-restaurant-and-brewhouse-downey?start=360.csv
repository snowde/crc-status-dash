Isaiah M.,"Montebello, CA",1,10,6,4.0,3/15/2014,"So I tried one of their new dishes. (Lemon Thyme Chicken) It was hard as a rock..but I was so hungry I kept eating it.. thinking it was gonna get better...then gave up and left plate. .waiter noticed and asked if all was ok. I told him actually no..and described the issue, with no hesitation he switched it for a salmon plate..few seconds later to make sure I was taken care of."
Don K.,"Long Beach, CA",27,47,11,1.0,2/7/2015,"The girl at the reception area needs to choose another profession, customer service not her forte.  In fact her attitude was so bad we left.  Never been to BH's before, not sure I will again!  Great first impression!  Ok, so we stayed.  WRONG DECISION.  I ordered a club sandwich, he asked ' what s that? '. When it came it was all over the plate.  I asked for ranch for the fries, that never came.  When the waiter poured water into my 1/2 drank Mountain Dew, he said, oh, let me get you another one... Never materialized.  We did get the dessert menu after we said we didn't want dessert.  Unbelievable."
Veronique B.,"South Gate, CA",26,106,287,4.0,11/3/2013,I enjoy all there drinks especially their beers. There food is ok. I really love the Grill Chicken ala Fresca delicious for 500 calories. It's a great atmosphere always full house. I don't sit in the restaurant section I'm a bar kind of doll.
Michelle D.,"Long Beach, CA",38,6,5,1.0,2/19/2015,Made an online order and ended up with NO food. Less than one star for extremely slow curbside service. What a joke!
Andrea M.,"Iliamna, AK",29,1,,1.0,5/20/2015,First time here me and my boyfriend ordered chedder chesse bread bowl. We both got sick from our stomach never go there again.
Tania B.,"Downey, CA",12,16,8,4.0,11/27/2013,"FOOD: Margherita Fresca Flatbread, Bone-in Buffalo Wings, Spinach Artichoke Dip. All really good, our favorite appetizers here. DRINKS: BJ'S Blonde (how many? We lost count.) Then Jameson/7ups for me and Jameson on the rocks for Al.  SERVICE: Above Average. Our server's name was Karen. We had gotten her once before a few weeks back and she seemed much nicer and more attentive then, but either way, no complaints this time either. She was on top of our drinks making sure we had refills when we were running dry and constantly asked if we needed anything, she even asked us once if we were having a good time. How lovely of her to ask :) SUMMED UP: Every BJs I've ever been to has provided a pleasant and memorable dining/drinking experience, but the Downey location is my all time favorite. Love the super high vaulted ceilings, stone walls and huge bar area. Not to mention it holds major sentimental value for me, even more so now."
Roland L.,"Los Angeles, CA",1269,660,6682,3.0,1/10/2011,"BJ's Brewhouse in Downey is located at the Stonewood Shopping Center. If you've dined at any BJ's, the environment will be familiar to you. Generally friendly staff, from the Maître d' to the busboys. I would like to apologize to all who have rated BJ's or any equivalent restaurant higher than my 3 star rating. Restaurants of this calibre, in my estimation, cannot really be reviewed any higher. If you've read some of my reviews and noticed some of my ratings, one would perceive me to be inconsistent. Not so! I will rank a hole-in-the-wall located in an unpleasant part of town higher based upon what they offer with respect to the specialty of the art of their cuisine and at times, value. I have had fabulous meals at restaurants with lower Health Department grades than B, or even at some places people wouldn't even dare set food in because they have a numerical grade, being on the cusp of closure! So why only 3 stars? BJ's fall within a generic restaurants category. I suppose if I were a connoisseur of (handcrafted) micro brews, I would rate this place higher, but I'm not one to consume alcoholic beverages. Having dined here in the past because friends couldn't settle on anything else, I've tried the pizza, flat breads, avocado egg rolls, calamari,  stuffed potatoes, salads, burgers, pizookies, etc...nothing that I would say, ""wow! I need to be here every day/week!"" food is A-OK. Service, again is generally good. Facility is clean. My menu was a little gross, as each page was sticky! :-/ At this visit, I was with a group of 20. Several pizzas and appetizers were on order. As a side note, I'm quickly determining that pizza in today's vernacular bare resemblance much closer to focaccia! If I want pizza, it has to be thin crust. If I want thick crust, I'd order focaccia. I'm tired of seeing these super thick, deep dish pies labeled as ""pizza"" and thin crust being labeled as ""flat bread""! Maybe I'm a bit critical, but I needed to vent! I ordered the Field of Greens Salad with Chicken along with a bottle of Pellegrino. They only stock one size of Pellegrino. I was surprised that the bottle was the tiny 250 ml bottle! As for the salad, it was tasty, but may have had too much dressing, at least for my tastes. My final thoughts....BJ's is a perfect place for teeny-boppers and 20 somethings, strapped for cash wanting to feel grown up. I'd venture to say they cater to the same demographic whom consider The Cheesecake Factory the pinnacle of culinary excellence! If you do a little investigating, you'll be surprised to find just how many restaurants there are around you offering a more excellent dining experience at a similar price point."
Veronica P.,"La Puente, CA",21,3,5,1.0,4/17/2013,"I was very disappointed today, I've been here before and it wasn't too bad. Today was bad, I walked up to the hostess and asked how long the wait was, she said 30 min. I said oh not too bad and gave her my name. As we were approaching the 30 min mark I started noticing that people who walked in after us were being seated. I approached the hostess again and asked how much longer the wait would be, she gave me a blank look and said you didn't give me your name and I thought you went to the bar. I said no, I gave you my name right after you said the wait was 30 min. After looking around she finally said you will be seated shortly. There is no way she didn't see me waiting. I was standing by her station and we made eye contact.  The only good thing about this visit was the peanut butter pazookie"
Maria W.,"Bellflower, CA",1,17,1,5.0,2/6/2015,"My Husband and I had an early dinner here yesterday and we were very impressed. He had the baby back ribs that fell off the bone and were juicy. I had the chicken pot stickers. I asked if they had balsamic vinegar and the server immediately went to find out for me. He not only brought a ramekin of the vinegar with my pot stickers, but included another one to mix with the soy ginger sauce. I was very happy and they were delicious! I had a glass of the Australian Shiraz which was outstanding and my husband had a Jack and coke....overall a very impressive and relaxing meal with great service."
Amy P.,"South Gate, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/8/2016,"Worst service ever, I went on Sunday feb 6th and I really hated it, I won't come back to that place anymore, my food was cold, my kid asked for Mac and cheese and that looked nasty, seriously it was the worst experience ever, and the mngr didn't even apologize for the situation, plz ppl don't go there"
Lina F.,"Los Angeles, CA",46,157,190,4.0,4/4/2013,"It's local so I come here often but not too often because it gets pricy. I get the lunch special usually, salad and soup or sandwich and salad. The pizza is great but I don't order it all the time because I always bust out of my outfit when I finish it. Great beer love the blonde and Jeremiah red. Attire is casual, but at night you can go dressy because a lot of people are there looking for a date. It's a good date spot. Service is okay, sometimes really slow when it's busy."
Alburrito G.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,6,,1.0,9/27/2014,Been here several times and service has been average. The last time I was here it was terrible. Went in on a slow Sunday evening got seated quickly but then no one came to ask is for our drinks. Waited 15min and still no one served us. Walked out and haven't been back since.
Wizeguy X.,"Newport Beach, CA",7,50,27,1.0,9/11/2014,"Hard to believe the service here could get any worse, but it has. Don't bother with a phone in order, it will be wrong. Don't eat there in the restaurant, most of the staff is just rude and doesn't know the menu. But don't worry, you can always go to Cerritos or Brea or Orange or Long Beach or Huntington Beach or Google another location. Good luck!"
Hugo C.,"Downey, CA",17,4,,1.0,2/22/2015,Bad service in the bar area. That chick mess it up for all the employees in the bar area. Bad customer service and lazy. She was just waiting to get her tip. Avocado egg roll look good in the picture but when i got them they look nasty. So I told the manager that I was not going to pay for that and how can they serve that to a customer. I know they wouldn't have eaten it themselves This happen on 02/22/2015 @ about 5 pm
Alberto M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,11,1,1.0,2/16/2013,"I did not have a good experience. It was not super busy, a Laker game night is busier. We were seated and a manager-type eventually took our drink order because our waitress never showed. She finally showed and asked if we wanted to have anything to drink. We told her someone else took our drink order. She left.  When she finally came back, she took our order and walked away. After about 10 minutes 1 out of 2 drinks show up and she promises to bring back the second. The second arrives, brought by someone else. Then our food came, tasted fine.  Mid-way through the meal, finally flagged down a manager-type and asked for water and a second drink from the bar.  Our waitress never showed up again. We finished eating and  flagged her down as we received the second drink from the bar. I told her to take the second drink off the bill and bring me my check, I was fed up with the service... and thirsty (never got that water).  Honestly, I just walked in because I wanted a light meal (had a sandwhich and no fries) but wanted to finish it off with a Pizooki...which by the end of the bad services, I did not feel like having any more.  Horrible service."
Jasmine C.,"Dublin, CA",650,430,616,3.0,6/12/2011,"I don't really like writing reviews for chain restaurants and places, but just wanted to say that happy hour is Mon-Thurs 3-7p and weekends I believe it's reverse HH at night? Can't remember the weekend days since we went on a weekday. But anyway, who doesn't love BJs? :) I love the avocado eggrolls, BBQ chicken and Great White pizza, as well as the PIZOOKIE. Duh. I still like the classic chocolate chunk cookie + vanilla best. And mini pizzas are half off during happy hour =) but apparently at THIS particular BJs you can't get happy hour prices if you sit down. You gotta order at the bar...which is kinda retarded. But oh well. Just a note for anyone yelping to find out about this location. The one in Arcadia doesn't discriminate! You can sit down at a table and have your happy hour foods. Sheesh. Would have given this branch more stars if this rule weren't intact...it's really spacious, new and clean, though!"
Andrea C.,"Phoenix, AZ",49,58,112,5.0,2/20/2013,"What can I say?  I love BJ's... Good pizza, good beer, good pazuki, drinks are loaded, and their baked potatoes are to die for. Sunday evening wasn 't too packed which is a good surprise and our weitress was super friendly."
Jason G.,"Downey, CA",35,3,4,3.0,3/29/2015,"Food here is really hit or miss.  Some days they're good,  others that ain't.  But avocado rolls are usually spot on. The bar is fully stocked so ask away. You may need to tell them what's in the drink if they don't know it but they'll get it."
Linda N.,"Long Beach, CA",323,144,147,1.0,9/10/2014,"Service blows. I sat at the bar for happy hour. We didn't get menus for 7 minutes (I timed it). I had to walk to the host and grab them myself. There wasn't a server in sight. I think they're also the cooks because there wasn't one server on the floor. We finally got a server to come to the table (now 15 minutes in). Food was basic. The sweet big personal pan pizza was soggy. The avocado eggrolls were not crispy. I don't even want to speak about the burger. They were in the kitchen for a while. The food looked like it was sitting under the food lamp for a while. 20 minutes later Mirella  (the waitress, i don't know how to spell her name) came back to ""refill"" our water and drop off our check. We were going to pay  with a card but she took so long to come back (she probably went to go pump water from the well) that we just paid in cash. She got like a .18 cents tip. She shouldn't have gotten anything. It was the worst service I've ever received."
Hector A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,,5.0,2/17/2016,"Amazing service!! We were celebrating my uncle's wedding and in total we were a group of 16. It was last minute and were already told that we would most likely will be 1 hour wait. We were ok with that since we never made a reservation.I noticed that one of the hostess and other co-workers were working and organizing a section to sit our whole family, The restaurant was full and they got it done within 20 minutes. The food we ordered came out quick. Our servers were very polite and attentive. Food was great. I would like to mention Yanira for her excellent service and great attitude and the whole staff that made this experience a great one."
