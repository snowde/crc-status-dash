Isabel S.,"Bell, CA",34,90,67,1.0,4/3/2013,"If I could rate this place a 0, I would. I've given this place 3 chances to impress me or at least not to disappoint. Last night's dinner was the straw that broke the camel's back. I ordered the Tuscan Chicken Limone with angel hair pasta and must I say the pasta had absolutely no salt it was so bland and flavorless. I had to pour the bottle of pepper to give it some type of flavor. Even the raspberry iced tea was bland. I don't know what it is about this chain of restaurants that just can't get things even decently tasty.  I WILL NOT GO BACK THERE AGAIN!"
David C.,"Paramount, CA",0,13,,3.0,3/13/2015,Food is always good beer is nice and cold but the service at the downy one sucks first time I went to BJ's there it took an hour at the table just to get service second time I went we waited 40 minutes for our food and they weren't  even packed then we never got a refill and we needed more napkins didn't get that till the end we needed more silverware we ask the different waiter did the survey all I got her response was sorry come back soon miss me with all that 10% or a free appetizer on your next visit would've been nice I will just drive to Cerrito's for now on
Mel Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,1,1.0,7/13/2015,"This place is a joke along with management! Ghetto and unprofessional managers who lack listening skills. Here I am complaining about how shitty the food is and asking to be remade, instead of going to the kitchen to get me my damn food, he was scolding the waitress near the restrooms. Smh never coming back here again"
Stephanie M.,"Whittier, CA",42,34,3,1.0,7/31/2014,"Single star for the nice server. According to the hubster and the toddler, it was my fault, I chose the chain.  Boo hiss never again :-("
Nakelii G.,"Downey, CA",0,10,,1.0,12/5/2015,"Horrible service!!! Took 25 min to even be acknowledged after being seated... Took 4 waiters to get ranch not to mention my food came out 20 min after all my family had theirs and I only got a club sandwich!!! When spoke to the manager and told him food came out late he said ""wonderful"" EXCUSE me how is that wonderful!!! I live so close to bj but I rather drive to Cerritos and get WONDER service there!!!"
Karen C.,"Pico Rivera, CA",3,4,,5.0,12/3/2014,Great food and customer service. Need I say more?  Thanks Chris Robles for the great service.
Aaron M.,"Lakewood, CA",235,53,6,5.0,12/3/2014,Was in there last night for a friends birthday party and I just wanted to say that Demetree(no idea how to spell that name) the bartender was really awesome. It's nice to come across bartenders that know their stuff and give awesome service.  He was really cool and helped me decide what beer I'd like out of their house brews.. Thanks for the great service..Cheers!
Lu C.,"Downey, CA",1,9,,1.0,8/11/2015,"I went to BJ''s Downey for lunch today and was not happy with their service and food. Let me start by saying we arrived there around lunch time walked straight to the bar and sat ourselves down. We were approached after a couple of minutes by a server and were asked if we were ready to order and we were so we did, that was the end of our good experience. I ordered the soup and salad, I had requested extra cilantro and avocado on my soup and neither happened when it arrived I asked my server that I had ordered extra cilantro etc. and she's basically arguing with me that I already have extra on my soup needless to say I told her to bring me more..she did finally. My kid ordered the kids Alfredo/broccoli pasta and it had a big hair implanted on the dish next to the pasta I called over the manager and he agreed to make another one  which but at which point I was already done with my meal. They had the audacity to charge for my kids meal in spite of the huge inconvenience. What I failed to mention was the fact that it was my sons birthday and with all the time wasted we had no time for his pizzokie which he was looking forward to. Needless to say not going back to Bj's anytime soon."
laura m.,"La Habra, CA",1,10,,2.0,1/9/2016,Drinks are good and there is such a wide selection. But the service is horrible especially on weekends. Waited over 40 min for appetizer and it was the wrong one. Then they brought our dishes one at a time so we could eat in stages and not as a group. So not coming back to this location.
Ravi M.,"Downey, CA",108,104,1,4.0,4/24/2013,"BJ's pizza is pretty standard fare, but they get an extra star for being really nice.  You already know the food, and the main courses themselves probably get only 3 stars, but the pizookie dessert is really spectacular and the entire review gets an extra star bump just for that. Parking is obviously ample since it's Stonewood mall and the service was pretty fast during a busy lunch hour. The pizookie is great, the service is well above average, and the beers are actually high quality.  I'm looking to try a beer flight during my next visit to a BJ's. I've heard great things about their ales."
Evelyn V.,"Los Angeles, CA",368,289,566,5.0,4/2/2011,"The food on most chain restaurants is usually good but BJ's is by far the best chain restaurant in town and the customer service is awesome. I have never had anything I didn't like from the buffalo chicken pizza drizzled in ranch, bar-b-que chicken pizza, great white and my new favorite...grilled chicken pesto with parmiggiano reggiano sprinkled on top. Avocado eggrolls, club sandwiches, chicken pasta and many things. But don't forget dessert even if you're full take it to go!!!! Pizookie is delicious, they can give you two flavors of cookie and do halfs, they have mini ones too if you're watching your diet. I feel like I'm advertising but BJ's deserves it."
Cherie D.,"Downey, CA",57,15,19,5.0,9/21/2014,"Great service!!!  Our server @ the downey location was Chris.  He was attentive,  knowledgeable about the menu, always remembers me when we come in.  They also have happy hour all day when pro football Is on on sunday."
Mici R.,"Sanger, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/16/2016,"Food was pretty good as usual. We were in town visiting from Fresno and got in kinda late but fortunately BJ'S was still open. However service was terrible. Our waiter disappeared halfway through our meal, never came to check on us or ask if we wanted to order pizookie (which originally we wanted to do) it wasn't until we were finished with our meal ready for boxes and brought boxes until we were asked if we wanted to order pizookie. Naturally we said no because we're aware pizookie takes a while and it was already approaching 11 p.m. After he dropped off the boxes he disappeared again for 15 minutes before coming back to ask if we wanted additional boxes we said no and he told us he'd bring back our bill. It wasn't until 11:28 until he brought back our crumpled up bill. By the time we got out of there it was close to 11:45. Pretty ridiculous if you ask me, waited 45 minutes after being done with our meal to actually be able to leave. Major disappointment and thumbs down."
Eric V.,"Los Angeles, CA",61,85,121,3.0,8/26/2015,"The food was really good! My group ordered a couple of things and just ate family style. Ordered a veggie pizza. Hit the spot. Pie was tasty and the bread was good. Also ordered the chicken club with some fries. That blew me away. The chicken was grilled to perfection. Ordered a chicken salad, which was fresh and tasty. It had corn and beans which gave it a great taste perfect for the summer. Just is. Our appetizers were good. Calamari was fresh and it was not chewy. Now comes the bad part. I would have given this place 4 stars, but the hostesses sucked! I don't know what it is, but good looking hostesses who spend half their time talking to their friends who work with them instead of greeting people and making them feel welcome is my pet peeve. It would be nice to walk in and be greeted, instead of waking in and waiting to talk to someone to be seated. I really don't care about eye candy at the front door. I care about feeling welcomed to a place that I am going to spend my hard earned money."
Timmy S.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",503,1624,2998,3.0,4/30/2010,"I met a friend here for dinner last night and was impressed with the interior - very nice compared to the BJs I've been to elsewhere. And not as crazily crowded as the one near me in Cerritos. I had a house salad and mini combo pizza which were both very good. BJs seems to be consistent at every location so my meal was just as I expected. I also got a margarita which was surprisingly well made. As with every BJs, the service was excruciatingly slow. If there was a cross between a snail and a turtle, the newly created creature would be instantly hired at BJs."
Juan Z.,"Huntington Park, CA",73,67,10,5.0,8/17/2014,This restaurant is the best and this was my first BJ's restaurant visit when I celebrated my sister's birthday. First of all the hamburgers in this restaurant was the best burger in this restaurant especially the fries. I would like to try out the pizookie again when I get to visit again.
Dolores L.,"Santa Fe Springs, CA",1,11,2,5.0,5/24/2015,Awesome pasta! Very beautiful inside! Customer service is great! A little pricy but well worth it.
Dodie V.,"Whittier, CA",82,28,4,2.0,1/9/2016,Extremely poor service today. Ordered Piranha Nachos and they were horrific.  Tortilla chips were as if someone crushed them up with their hands. Little to no chili  / cheese  -slathered w/ warm sour cream.  Waiting now more than 45 minutes for our entrées - salads !!!!! Was just your typical salad with mostly lettuce - not a lot of anything else. I had the Santa Fe Salad and substituted w/ Cajun Shrimp. Shrimp good but  cold. Probably prior made and refrigerated.  May or may not be back. Totally not worth the money we paid for our meals. Server was Cynthia A. Not her fault the kitchen items were not up to standards.
Carlos C.,"South Gate, CA",20,39,19,4.0,9/5/2014,"I like this place, I like their food and the ambience.  If you want to watch a sport event this is a great place to be. The servers are friendly and very nice. I recommend it for bday too. They give you a free pizuky."
Chelsea D.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/2/2015,"This is by far the worst restaurant I've ever been to. I visited this restaurant on a Sunday for brunch with my boyfriend , I ordered a deep dish pizza . Half ways thru the pizza I found a piece of glass . I little too late since I had already put it in my mouth and bite it. I immediately spit it out. We got our waitress and called it to her attention , although we got some kind of discount on our tab I find it unexceptional. This is by far the worst incautious restaurant I will never be eating here again."
