Mo G.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,13,,1.0,11/25/2017,"Horrible service!  I didn't get her name, but it was horrible service. It was slow and was disappointed about the service. I wouldn't return to this restaurant. I expected more of them."
Thomas C K.,"Santa Rosa, CA",17,263,10,2.0,4/6/2017,"In one word: terrible! . My wife ordered a thin crust pizza and instead got a pizza where the dough was at least 1"" think. The drinks were ""stuffed"" with ice cubes resulting in a watered down experience. I ordered the barbacoa with cauliflower - the waiter explained that the barbacoa was not meat but simply a sauce. Well, the dish contained small pieces of chicken, no barbacoa sauce and not cauliflowers but pieces of cucumber. I know we should have returned both dishes but we were in a hurry. This restaurant will never see us again.!!"
Jennifer M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,1.0,8/13/2017,"It was my first time yesterday trying this place out, I ordered the house sirloin steak with mashed potatoes and Mac and cheese. Never again will I come here! The service was very blah and I order my steak medium well, my steak was overly cooked and the Mac and cheese was not good at all. The Kraft Mac and cheese from a box is 10x better. I didn't enjoy my food at all, it was nothing to what I expected and I wouldn't come here again. Not worth what my friend and I paid for."
Jessica T.,"Long Beach, CA",603,113,222,5.0,8/8/2016,"BJ's is one of my favorite go-to restaurants when I am craving American food. This location is big and clean. I've been to BJ's in Cerritos and Del Amo Mall and they all look the same. Service is always good at any BJ's location I have been to. If you had to try one thing I suggest their deep dish pizzas. It is so mouthwatering and delicious. The bread is so plump and fluffy. My favorite flavor is the BBQ chicken. I also love getting the pastas here, the garlic bread that comes with the pasta is delicious as well. If you want to try an appetizer I suggest the avocado egg rolls. For the beer, I tried the tatonka stout (8.5% alch) and it was great.  For dessert try the pizookies! They have multiple flavors and seem to have a new flavor on the menu every so often. The pizookie is a freshly baked hot cookie with icecream on top. It is the perfect combo. The cookie smells so fresh and every bite is amazing.  If you come with a big party there may be a long wait, so I suggest calling ahead and making reservations. Also, if you come here often you should sign up for the BJs rewards program. You accumulate points after every meal and can get discounts or free pizookies depending on your point value."
Alicia N.,"Downey, CA",0,1,,5.0,9/26/2017,"Our Server was Gerardo tonight, excellent customer service! He was so attentive to our needs and just a great personality overall. We have been here many times but today our visit stands out. It's people like him that deserve the reviews, doing your above and beyond. The food was delish too. Thank you again BJ's will be back soon."
Jessica O.,"Arroyo Grande, CA",32,182,105,4.0,2/27/2017,"I was honestly completely shocked during our visit at this BJs location. I've been to several other locations and never had such a great experience. Our service was amazing. Angela was very attentive. She brought refills early, extra sauces before we even had a chance to ask and even had a stack of napkins on our table before our food arrived. When you eat out with 4 kids you never know what kind of service you'll get. Sometimes children turn a server off and they try to ignore the kids completely, not Angie! She spoke directly to our kids and let them order for themselves which they LOVED. She had a smile on her face the entire time and never appeared frustrated even though she had several tables in her section.  We ordered an appetizer sampler, large deep dish pizza, BBQ chicken salad and a guacamole burger on special. Everything was very good and cooked exactly how we ordered it.  The only unfortunate thing is that we don't live in the area and the BJs closest to us has never been impressive. If you live nearby, definitely eat here! If you've previously given this place a lower review, you're sitting in the wrong servers section."
Eddie R.,"Twentynine Palms, CA",41,110,311,3.0,6/15/2017,Stopped in here for lunch today. The BJs salad was excellent I had Bacon ranch wife had Lemon thyme chicken mine was OK hers was on the salty side. The tea was also excellent .all in all I think what we picked for lunch was just the wrong choice for this day . I will eat at BJ's agin and not even think about this one time .. have ate at other BJ's and always was happy but anyone that's comes to bjs must try their salad .... also the service was very good .....
Enrique R.,"Los Angeles, CA",23,3,,5.0,8/23/2017,"Timothy M. Was such a great server! I wish more were like him, he made our dinner experience a 5 out of 5 ! Will return just because of Tim!"
Lopez L.,"La Mirada, CA",0,7,,1.0,7/2/2017,"If I could give them a 0 I would. I went with my family today ( Sunday around 4 pm). Party of 4 with 2 being kids. After 45 minutes they were still working on our food. The worst service , I had to walk out . I asked to speak to the manager , Leo , and he never made it to our table . Won't be coming back to BJ's again . You lost a customer -"
Jen C.,"Downey, CA",0,11,3,5.0,11/10/2017,I took my family for lunch today. TIMOTHY WAS our server and was beyond excellent. He was very attentive and actually took the time to talk to us. We received the best service in have had there because of him. Would definitely go back because of him.
Johanna A.,"Long Beach, CA",9,22,17,5.0,1/15/2017,"Came in during the crazy football season. Place is ok on time if you don't mind waiting. Staff is nice but one guy is super welcoming, Tim. Funny dude too!Helped us out explaining then bjs points and remembered us from the last time. Made us feel like regulars for sure. Good job BJs."
Karissa L.,"Temple City, CA",342,305,742,3.0,11/29/2016,"I came here with a group of people from work on a Sunday night. Food was so-so. The buffalo chicken pizza I ordered wasn't as good as the ones I've had at other locations. This one was way too dry and not very flavorful. Our server was very friendly but his service was kind of slow. It took forever for him to bring our check out and when he did there were extra charges on there. We asked him to fix it and he disappeared for the longest time before coming back with the correct check. He also took his sweet time getting us boxes....I think he might've been new. But at least he was always friendly and checked up on us throughout the meal. Overall, there are better BJ's locations."
Charles R.,"Sylmar, CA",49,224,43,5.0,5/29/2017,"Nice and very spacious BJ's. First time visit to this location. Service was good, drinks were great but food should have been warmer. Big plus for opening until 1:00am on Fridays and Saturdays. Restaurant appeared well staffed on this Saturday night and there was plenty of parking."
Caligirl S.,"Long Beach, CA",4,42,57,5.0,2/19/2017,"The chocolate chunk pizookie is a great dessert to have after your wonderful meal. I also tried the berry burst cider and it was delicious, it's reminded me of Stella Rosa. It was sweet but not too sweet. For my meal I got the quinoa bowl with salmon.  They have other options like chicken, shrimp and vegetarian. There's plenty of parking  because it is located next to stone wood mall.  There are other restaurants nearby as well. Happy eating!"
Mahya J.,"Los Angeles, CA",92,328,328,3.0,6/28/2016,"This location is ok! I got seated right away as it was a Tuesday I guess.  The service needs to improve though.  The decor was okay and it took forever to join the rewards program.  I liked my food, but the steak was a bit dry. Even though I got it well-done, they should add moisture."
Jessica R.,"Cerritos, CA",475,25,6,3.0,2/3/2017,"Three stars mostly for the service. The workers were very friendly and prompt and helping me out.  The food however was pretty mediocre. Would I go back again? Maybe, but it wouldn't be my first choice."
Liz O.,"Long Beach, CA",191,33,40,5.0,11/7/2016,"Had Anthony C as our server for lunch time today & must I say he was super attentive and speedy! My sister and I had half bone in buffalo wings and lemon pepper, a delicious tortilla bowl ! I recommend the deep dish ziti bowl I had today it was perfectly cooked and brought out as soon as we were done with our appetizer ! The staff here is always friendly and joyful!"
Alicia E.,"Downey, CA",174,52,45,2.0,6/9/2017,I have been to this restaurant more than enough to attempt to give an adequate review but today was probably the last time we go. I would rather drive to a farther one. There service is terrible. It took over an hour to get food and it was not that busy. They looked short staffed and not aware of customer service at all. We had to wait to get napkins and silverware while we sat and picked at our salads with our hands...by the time we got our food is was cold and we barely got refills on our water. This place needs to seriously work on customer service and timing of food. Our server acted like we were bothering her every time we asked for more water or something
Laura S.,"Bell, CA",5,52,59,4.0,7/14/2017,"Boyfriend and I come in to this particular Bjs very often. You can't go wrong with Bjs. Recommend the buffalo chicken pizza. The Paloma drink is really good. If you are a Bjs frequent consumer, download the app and earn point it is very convenient."
Esmeralda R.,"Long Beach, CA",9,17,2,4.0,7/8/2017,"Ok so where do i start, our waiter was kinda horrible. He wasn't friendly, he didn't check up on us, and my burger had waaaaayy too much pepper on it (that's not his fault), so since he didn't check up on us, I was forced to wait til he walked by(10min) when he finally came by, I wasn't hungry anymore so I told him I wasn't satisfied. So his sneaky little self took off the cheapest thing on our bill so he would get a bigger tip LOL. You can't play me boo. Good try! So I called the manager over and he took care of us, free pazookie and all. Idk the managers name but he wears glasses and he's a sweetheart."
