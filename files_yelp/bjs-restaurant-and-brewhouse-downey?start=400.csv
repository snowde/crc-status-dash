Jenn G.,"Huntington Park, CA",18,30,1,3.0,8/2/2014,"I've been here on several occasions &, it's sad to say, that the experiences have been getting worse & worse every time. The food is okay, nothing special really. The service is slow and not very good. On today's visit, the server got 3 things on our order wrong, seemed like the only thing he was on top of was refilling drinks. All in all, I'd go back just because there are not many options in the immediate area but I would not go out of my way to visit this location again."
Cynthia A.,"Long Beach, CA",417,535,108,3.0,6/28/2012,"Parking was a mess! That alone made me want to leave but I do love BJ's just not this location so much. Very crowded, our seating was by the cashier for the waiters so I constantly was hearing their gossip and gripes. Our waitresses were nice, except for one took forever to take our order because she thought the other one had taken it...communication is key! The food was delicious as always. Tasted the new watermelon salad and I was in love. Such a perfect and refreshing salad for summertime. I'm a fan of their small bites plates because they are a good size for a great price. The buffalo pizza is my favorite, usually order a mini and a small bite (stuffed mushrooms, mozzarella and tomato, or bruschetta). Pzookies are a must, the sampler is the best bet if you're sharing."
Nicole U.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",192,685,219,4.0,3/27/2012,Great service and ridiculously priced lunch specials. My meal here was cheaper than a drive thru visit to Carls Jr.
Hidbigo S.,"Corrales, NM",0,34,,4.0,9/15/2014,Eaten at BJ in several cities. It is Monday night football and after 11 minutes of waiting i had to flag a waitress. Had to walk to the bar to get my own beer. Never had a bad experience until this visit. Absolutely terrible service.
Marbel M.,"South Gate, CA",0,1,,2.0,12/12/2015,Went to this bjs location on a Saturday night for a few drinks and sat at the bar. I usually enjoy seating at the bar butt this time around I did not enjoy seating at the bar at all. First the bartenders were not friendly or welcoming at all. They never asked if we wanted more drinks after we were done with our first drink. The bartenders seemed not interested In taking our food order. They even seemed annoyed that we asked for sides. The food was good and it came out right away after we were able to place the order. No complaints about the food. Good customer Service overall at the bar was lacking.
Alma B.,"Bell Gardens, CA",0,4,,5.0,1/14/2015,"Love the pizzas! Black and blue burger! Everything I get here is delicious. I always sit in the bar area, their happy hour is awesome. Bartender service varies but David is always friendly and fast."
H G.,"Huntington Park, CA",57,11,2,3.0,8/2/2014,"The service and quality of food at this place has gone downhill. Today, our server got our order wrong three times. The food was mediocre had the turkey club sandwich which was very bland and the BJ's Pizza deep dish crust--the crust was not as crispy as other times and didn't have an even distribution of the toppings. I counted TWO MUSHROOMS in the overall pizza. Overall nothing special to keep me coming back to this place. Don't think I'll be back again."
Allan B.,"Midland, TX",163,133,161,5.0,2/23/2012,"Last night I took my wife for dinner and we decided to give BJ's a try. I am so glad we did. The place is great from the inside, the lighting is just perfect. The greeting was welcoming and friendly. We requested booth seating and this was accommodated with pleasure. We enjoyed great dishes, the Calamari was fantastic, the deep dish pizza was very good, the chicken fettuccine pasta was a little below average to our taste because it was rather dry. Then we tried their signature dessert the Pizookie!! It comes in different flavors, and we tried the triple chocolate Pizookie, it was just exquisite and very tasty! Definitely worth a try.  Advice: Give BJ a try!"
Gloria D.,"Norwalk, CA",110,9,4,3.0,4/18/2014,Pretty busy last tonight! Service was a bit slow but overall food was great! Took our server a few minutes to come get our drink and order but then again she probably had a lot of tables.
The ..,"Huntington Beach, CA",1,7,4,5.0,2/2/2014,"Tip of the day: if you're in the mood for alcohol and dessert, try a pizookie with a PM Porter beer. Big thanks to my server Tiffany for this tasty recommendation."
Vanessa S.,"Riverside County, CA",0,9,1,1.0,8/23/2015,"Ok so let me start off by saying I've been to multiple locations of bjs and I've never had an issue, until this past weekend at the Downey location. I went on a Friday night at around 9:30, my boyfriend got us a booth at the bar section and the waitress seemed very nice, a few minutes later she came to tell us she was done for the night and a waitress who's name starts with a ""D"" was gonna serve us for the remainder of the night, ok fair enough. She asked if we were ready to order and we said we needed a few more minutes. She didn't return for about 20 minutes if not longer. She hardly even made eye contact with us so we couldn't wave her over. Once we made eye contact with her we waved and she took our order. When the food came, they didn't give us utensil or napkins so we waited about another 15 min for the napkins and utensils. We really felt like she was purposely avoiding us. We thought maybe it was because it was only the 2 of us at a booth and that annoyed her, I really don't know. That night we were there from 9:30 to 12 am, we would have left earlier but an hour if not more was spent by us waiting to get service. In the time we were there the waitress only stopped by our booth 4 times, all 4 times because we had to wave her over. This girl made it so difficult just to get a beer. She would walk past our booth and wouldn't make eye contact with us or asked if we were doing alright. I've never experienced this at any other bjs. We weren't rude or obnoxious, we sat quietly at the booth so I still can't figure out why she would be avoiding our booth. And no, it wasn't overly busy that night, it was a regular Friday night type of crowd and we noticed everyone else at her section was getting served. I'm very disappointed especially since I love the bjs franchise. Not cool bjs, not cool at all."
Frank R.,"South Gate, CA",0,18,,1.0,2/14/2014,I ordered two pizzas one hand tossed and deep dish. The pizzas were very salty especially the deep dish with extra pepperoni. The pizza was also not hot was very lukewarm. We had one large and two small's with three drinks total price 68 dollars.  I would've rather had an 8 dollar deep dish pizza at Little Caesars.
Angel C.,"Downey, CA",0,10,2,2.0,6/13/2013,"So, we had a high school grad that decided he wanted to eat here. Let me start by saying that the hostess said it'd be a 30 minute wait. Of course, an hour later, our large party started getting frustrated because we were told they were waiting for two girls to finish eating  to clear up an area for us. Surprise, surprise-- they finished and then sat another party that arrived after us there. As we asked why that happened, the manager told us they honor reservations first. Wtf, she could have said that before pissing us all off. The staff simply doesn't know how to communicate clear expectations with their clients. We were finally seated in two separate areas. Our waitress was ok but seemed too stressed for a large group. I personally had to ask 3 different employees, including the manager, to change a channel to the Dodger game.They all said yes and never did. I hate to be an AHole, so I let it go. Other TVs away from us had the game going. So this is what prompted me to write this review and knocked a few stars down in the service department. The manager did send some courtesy avocado egg rolls after we ordered. That was kind of her; she later did come to apologize about the fiasco. However, you can't excuse poor service because the restaurant is busy. Later, we got a different server to replace our first, and he was great! He even brought out complimentary deserts for our graduate. I was at one star at the time. The food was average. My cheese and tomato pizza wasn't any better than Pizza Hut's, but the beer and wine was good. The prices are reasonable as well. The environment was clean but I personally don't like to be surrounded by cholitos, so I'd go elsewhere. So if you want great service here, don't get your hopes too high. As for the food--simply average.  Two stars for food and service."
April P.,"Whittier, CA",0,14,4,1.0,8/14/2015,"First, my 2 friends and I (2 African-American and one Hispanic) were being led to the rear of the restaurant. I objected and we were told we could sit in the bar area, as there ""weren't any servers"" in the middle of the restaurant. We were seated in the rear of the bar  10 minutes later, that area was full of other customers. Second, one fork was filthy, it was replaced by a second filthy fork. These dirty forks were replaced by plastic utensils. Then the server took a long time to bring crackers, which should be readily available and not take over 10 minutes to get. Then, the manager comps a dessert; which had a hair in it! The manager offers a coupon for the same dessert which had a hair in it! The whole time, the server is barely coming around to check on our table. The manager then gives a small discount and offers gift card....NEVER AGAIN! The restaurant was full of white people who seemed like they were all very happy with their experience. I'm only giving one star because I have to."
Elsa M.,"Bellflower, CA",25,10,,1.0,4/6/2014,"Horrible service!  Their ""5 minute"" wait was actually well over 20 minutes.  Long time to get seated,  long time to order, Long time to get our food.  At least let me know you're running behind,  I would be more understanding and not give a 1 star review.  :p. The BJ's in Cerritos is 10 times better!"
Megan D.,"Norwalk, CA",1,1,,1.0,11/11/2014,"We had the worst service. We waited 10 minutes to be seated. We then waited another 15 minutes to order drinks. We waited an hour for our food which was cold when we got it. I ordered soup in a bread bowl got it in a regualr bowl. (Wasnt too big of a deal). But he did replace it. He then charged me for two soups and an extra loaf of bread, when i told him about it he argued.  I will probably never come back to this bjs. They have terrible service. We got here at 10 and didnt leave till 1. It was a terrible experience."
Dominique S.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,50,84,1.0,3/5/2013,"I did not have a good experience at this location!! It was not busy AT ALL . We were seated our drink order was taken. 35 minutes later our waitress showed to introduce the shift change and new waiter - it got better we, I mentioned I would pay for drinks and leave he took our order and served us promptly.  The ""manager/Chef comes out and asked ""what my problem was"" blank stare** really, well nothing AFTER we ate FINALLY and sat waiting for 45 minutes to have our order taken, watched as other visitors were seated, ate and left. The new waiter proceeded to give us a free pizzookie for the inconvenience...thanks but no thanks I rather have better service."
Lise H.,"Downey, CA",0,4,1,1.0,8/2/2014,"Waited 15 minutes for someone to take my take out order. Once it hit the 25 minute mark I left. No one acknowledge my presence not even the simple ""Someone will help you shortly, I'm sorry for the wait."""
Pearl F.,"Huntington Park, CA",120,46,26,4.0,6/2/2014,Everything on the menu is good make. When they say do you want dessert you must say yes!!!! The Pizookie is the
