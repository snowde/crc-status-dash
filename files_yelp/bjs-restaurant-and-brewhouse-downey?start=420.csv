Anthony K.,"Los Angeles, CA",262,31,53,4.0,10/20/2010,BJS special brews are good if you want to try something other than the commercial imports.  Around this time they have a brew called Pumpkin Ale which is smoother than the Sam Adams seasonal  Octoberfest. The Pot Roast sandwhich is really filling & the potato skins never fail as a compliment to good beer.
Luis S.,"Huntington Park, CA",1,19,,5.0,7/19/2014,"I'm still salivating excellent food and service, had the Chicken Tortilla soup in the sourdough bread.  Hoping to go back soon, the place is positively delightful."
Judith S.,"Los Angeles, CA",294,57,24,4.0,3/1/2014,"The food here is awesome. The ambiance is soothing, dimly lit, there are a few big screens but you're not bombarded by them,  it is busy...not the most intimate place to dine, we were placed in the middle of the room. It was cold and I wanted something warm and soothing. The chilly bowl in the sourdough bowl really hit the spot. There was an issue with my daughter's pink lemonade drink. She said it was too tart but other than this it was a fine dining experience. Our dessert, the first time I'd ever tried a Pazookie (sp?) was heavenly. You can pick your combo of cookie and ice cream. You honestly can't go wrong whichever you choose. The cookies are warm and the ice cream is fresh. Thank you for a wonderful date night with my lil fam bam BJs."
Jennee O.,"Huntington Park, CA",16,4,8,2.0,12/17/2013,"I would not suggest this location to anyone unless they like waiting a long time for their food. I came here for my birthday to eat with friends and not only did they took a long time to give us our food , but lack of customer service. The way the waitress attend us was in a nonchalant way in where I felt I wasn't welcomed."

Sarah B.,"Altadena, CA",0,6,4,5.0,7/7/2015,Ok so I've been here over a dozen times on business.... It's...... Unfortunately the only chain .... Legit restaurant I can count on to take the handful of customers I have in Downey..... It saddens me to say that out of those dozen times I've crossed my fingers and hoped for the best.... Regarding service.....(because I made the bad decision trying other places not chain...) but I can say with all certainty... Right now on July 7th at 430pm... This is the 3rd time..... Chris..... The bartender at the bar is AMAZING!!! Thank God!.... Because I'm getting a Tone of customers from this area! .  Thanks Chris! Hopefully next time I'll get ur mid day weekday schedule when I know I can come by with confidence!
Victor O.,"Pico Rivera, CA",0,2,,5.0,10/6/2014,"Good service, great food, and amazing features would be just a few words to describe this amazing food joint. Very nice interior and the style if the entire restaurant is nice and casual."
Joyce Q.,"Lakewood, CA",15,21,30,1.0,6/1/2014,"Ok where do I start. I love Bj's I go to the cerritos location all the time for brunch and love it..kudos for cerritos give u 5 stars. Downey on the other hand seriously there was no one here so ordering should be easy, I ask for water.....how long does it take to pour water? 10 mins I don't think so, well that's how long it took me to get my water. Then brunch. I ordered like Cerritos as always .....French toast it came 30 minutes later and I was starving then it didn't have powdered sugar on it and barely any maple syrup to last me. I didn't complain because I didn't want to get my food spit on....I'm sure you've thought about that before too. Lol.. waiter never came to see how we were doing really. So needless to say I'm never coming back to Downey again ....I love you BJ's cerritos"
William M.,"Baldwin Park, CA",252,439,155,3.0,1/8/2012,"Birthday dinner number 4 - the last group of friends. Driving into the mall parking lot, I knew this wasn't goin to be good. Oh and the Lakers are playing. Finding parking was a nightmare. Circled around like for 10 minutes. I just decided to park closer towards Macy's and walk over. Walked in and it was a full house. Good thing my friends got there early and were already seated. Sat down and the waiter came to see what I wanted to drink - I asked for a coke and he thinks hes funny and says ""ok 1 jack and coke"".   Placed our orders and it took awhile for the food to come out. I went with the Texas Style Chicken fried steak. Dry....not enough gravy....mash potatoes were ""warm"" at best. Service was good til our waiter went on break - his replacement ""Sam"" (very pretty girl) didnt really show up much. She kinda disappeared.  Food - could've been better. Service - was good with our waiter, but not with his replacement. Atmosphere - bunch of Laker fans, which I am not. (I dont support guys that are ""accused"" of raping women and cheat on their wife."
Priscilla C.,"Whittier, CA",106,58,90,3.0,4/19/2014,"came here last nigh with my lovely sisters and when we where seated i told the waitress that t was one of my sisters birthday i said she is the only one with blond blond hair welll she forgot -_- that sucked and then when we ordered something to drink to start with we ordered the  8 beer samplers i forget the word they use anyway the waitress reccomended a couple of her fave well those couple were horrible and then she say ''ya i didnt like those either but everyone else did!'' i wanted to say then why did you reccomend them if you dont like them your self lol hello we asked what were you fave. any way also the calimari was defibately not fresh ,BUT the pizza was sooo good and the waitress was pretty but thats it ."
Marcellas B.,"Buena Park, CA",3,1,,1.0,6/25/2014,Service was slow slow slow. Sat at my table with empty glass for 20+ mins and they changed my waiter/waitress 4 times during my service. Potato skins came out burnt and food was only okay. Wouldn't recommend this Bj's.
Lorraine M.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,2,,1.0,6/15/2014,they have the worst service ever! They brought our entree before our appetizer and didn't give us utensils and we asked about 4 different perople to bring some and when they finally did they still hadnt brought us are appetizer. When they finally brought the appetizer after me having to ask about 5 times it was cold like if it had been sitting there. I just ended up telling the waitress to box it up and bring us the check which they also took forever to process. They were so inattentive that I probably could of just got up and left with out paying and they probably wouldn't have noticed.
Kirstie M.,"Downey, CA",7,12,2,1.0,5/6/2015,"The worst customer service experience I've had with a restaurant ever. My boyfriend and I came to the location about 1045p and waited about 15mins for a table which was not a problem to us at all. We were seated and our first round of drinks came quickly. Our server did not come to the table for about 15 mins before he took our order which again was not an issue. Our server came back 10mins later and said he lost his checkbook that had our orders in it and needed to take them again. At this point we were a bit frustrated with the timing of everything. It had been about 30mins in and no food and our drinks were empty. I ordered a salad and requested that it come prior to our food. 45 mins had passed and our server was no where in sight. The restaurant was not crowded and there seemed to be a good ratio of servers to tables. The server finally came back after 20mins and said he was so sorry about the wait and that he would check on the food. He asked if we needed refills when he saw our empty cups. He came back with refills like 5mins later and said nothing to us. A table of four that was sitting across from us that was seated about 15mins after my boyfriend and I received their food first and one of the plates was exactly what my boyfriend ordered.  at that point we had been waiting for almost 1hr 30mins for our food. We were very hungry and did not receive the best customer service. I am fully aware that BJs is not a fine dining restaurant but, the expectations is that a customer can at least receive their food in a timely manner. I ended up stopping the server and telling him that we are just going to pay for the drinks and leave. There were three servers in the front just laughing and talking to each other while a few tables were patiently waiting for their plates. The server came by maybe three times max. To make matters worst the server was like I talked to my manger you don't have to pay for your drinks and did not show face. I myself am a manager and work in an elevated customer service environment and I make sure that when there is a situation that I personally rectify the situation and ask the customer if there is anything further we can do. The manager never came by or wanted to speak to us. My assumption is he was the only older guy wearing a blue collared shirt that was hanging out in the front of the restaurant talking to the hostess. It was by far the worst experience I've had at a BJs. We ended up walking down to Buffalo Wild Wings and had a great experience there! Needless to say I am very disappointed with the locations along with the customer service aspect of it and don't think I will return to this location again."
Karina G.,"Santa Fe Springs, CA",0,6,1,1.0,9/8/2014,Horrible Service!! The waiting process was very unorganized. Employees need to be trained to handle large groups per table.
Andy L.,"Los Alamitos, CA",8,48,6,4.0,3/20/2014,"Came here with a couple of my friends and had a great time.  I ordered the jalapeno burger and the meat patty was nice and big.  It definitely satisfied my hunger for the night.  Love love love their pizzookie.. used to not be a fan of ice cream with cookie, girl friend introduced it to me once, now i can't leave BJ without eating the pizzokie."
Cecilia L.,"Placentia, CA",0,16,,5.0,12/19/2014,Because it is the Christmas season holiday parties my husband & I were expecting a wait but we're quite surprised that we were seated within 10 minutes. Our waitress came by introduced herself and apologized before hand for any delay but we understood IT'S CHRISTMAS!  She serviced us sooner than expected and we were very pleased. We also spoke with the manager Allie Newman very nice gentleman  just to let him know that the service we received was exceptional considering how busy they were.  We've been to BJ's on several occasions and never had a bad experience.
Eric K.,"Norwalk, CA",54,9,2,1.0,12/22/2013,"This is literally the worst location I've ever been to. Slow service, no server knows what's available and the place feels dirty. Add in a touch of ""who's table is that"" from the staff and you've got an awful restaurant. Avoid if you can."
Daniela A.,"Lynwood, CA",1,29,25,4.0,7/16/2012,"man this place gets packed! It could be worse, waiting at buffalo wild wings looks awful."
Julien A.,"Downey, CA",0,3,,1.0,8/14/2014,"Placed order online at 7:30 they said it would done at 7:45 and I thought wow that's some great service.  But I was wrong....so, so, so wrong. I get here at 7:45 and they ask my name and my order. I pay and then they start making my meal. It is now 8:15 and I'm still waiting. ...ugh"
Lori V.,"Downey, CA",0,1,,5.0,8/14/2014,My partner and I flew in from SC and have never eaten at BJ's.  It was really good.  Our service was excellent!  Heather was our Server and Emily was our Food Runner.  They were very friendly and professional!
