Stephanie G.,"Huntington Park, CA",0,2,2,5.0,5/15/2014,"Bjs is a great place to go with family and friends.  Every time i go to Bjs I receive great service.  The food I have tried here is the pasta, pizzas, and some appetizers. They were pretty good, but the pazookies are a must!!!"
John V.,"Pico Rivera, CA",1662,310,548,4.0,8/8/2013,"Great atmosphere and great selection on the menu.  I had the Great white deep dish pizza which was really good , Nugget had the patented Spaghetti in marinara sauce which she devoured, grandma had the spinach and artichoke deep dish mini which she almost polished off and the wife had a dish with chicken in a balsamic sauce?  Overall great food, service was a little slow but not to the point of annoying.  Calimari was tasty but could have used some flavor in the batter.  It was a little bland so the marinara dipping sauce was a definate save.  Mozzarella sticks as usual were pretty good and had to fight the nugget from eating them all.  Last but not least, make sure and bring a jacket just in case Bj's is an ice box.  That night We were there it felt like it was in the 60's."
Gloria R.,"Downey, CA",506,455,2299,1.0,2/16/2012,"First off let me start by saying I love to come to BJ's Restaurants and I have been to quite a few. I am not sure why I continue to frequent this particular restaurant. Each time I come to this restaurant I have encountered such poor service and incompetent servers. The wait time is horrible even if you call ahead and they give you an estimated time you will still have to wait the time they tell you when you actually arrive. So there is no point in calling ahead. Today my son and I decided to come because we haven't been here in quite some time and figured something should have changed since our last visit but no it is still the same. We decide to sit in the bar area in a booth as suggested by the hostess as service would be quicker. But no, we sat at the table for 11 minutes (yes, I timed it) before I had to go and complain before we were even greeted or offered drinks. Seriously? 11 minutes that is ridiculous!!! So finally they send someone over to greet us and apologize. We ordered our drinks and food as my son always orders the same thing. But the food takes even longer which is surprising since the place was practically empty. The food was overcooked and dry. Very disappointed:( My son didn't even finish his food. I will remember not to come to this particular restaurant again due to continued disappointment."
Vanessa A.,"Bell, CA",59,36,18,2.0,12/18/2013,"This place... I'm always so torn. The food is pretty good but the service is just, ugh! It always seems so packed and understaffed. I feel like the waiters just forget about you and it takes forever to actually get your food! By the time you get it, you're just like ""I guess I'll eat this""when in reality I just wanna get up and leave. I went once and they were actually out of silverware!! Whoever actually ended up with silverware at our table had to give up either a fork or a spoon so that everyone had something to use. Another crazy thing! My friend ordered some chicken dish that I guess usually comes with 2 chicken breasts and the waiter came back saying that they ran out of chicken & only had 1 breast so if she'd like something else. Keep in mind this was probably after more than 30 minutes of waiting for our food. RIDICULOUS!!"
Lina F.,"Lakewood, CA",1152,447,1258,4.0,6/24/2013,"This place is good, and service is quick but it's loud in there.  Lot's of chatter goin' on but the foods great!  I've been here several times before so i know the food's great, the drinks are great, everything is great."
R S.,"Lake Forest, CA",0,70,,5.0,8/5/2011,"I booked my sister's bridal shower here last month, and I cannot express how happy I am with the outcome!  The manager was very helpful with all the arrangements.  We were able to reserve the semi-private area inside the restaurant (perfect, because it would have been too hot on the patio outside).  Our guests absolutely loved the food in our pre-set buffet (pasta, four kinds of pizza, Asian chicken salad).  The staff was extremely attentive, coming by at regular intervals to ask if we needed anything, and consistently providing refills without having to be called over.  I really liked the way all the waiters/waitresses went up to my sister and congratulated her.  They even provided boxes so that I could send the guests home with the leftovers. I would absolutely recommend booking a party at this particular BJ's.  It's easy for guests to find, there is ample parking, and the management makes the process very easy.  We were able to come in 30 min. ahead of time to set up decorations.  They did a great job seating other customers away from our party, to the extent that they were able to. Thanks to everyone at BJ's in Downey for making my sister's bridal shower such a fun and memorable event! :)"
Kat R.,"Norwalk, CA",38,40,6,1.0,4/2/2012,"I came here for my friend's birthday dinner with about 10 other people and this is the worst BJ's I have ever been to. I found something in my drink and the waitress didn't replace it at all. I waited at least 30 mins and didn't get it replaced till I asked for a replacement. My friends also asked for a refill on her drink and they didn't refill hers at all. ! They did not include the side sauces we asked for and asked AT LEAST FOUR OR FIVE TIMES till they finally got us the sauces.  When we ordered pizookies, they got our orders wrong and asked ""are you sure you didn't order this?"" -_____- the pizookies were so hard eugk."
G K.,"Downey, CA",98,11,41,1.0,11/20/2011,"I came with a bunch of friends for a late night dinner during Happy Hour.  I started off with the Fresh Mozarella and Tomato Salad which I typically love but they overdid it with the mozarella on top. My boyfriend ordered their infamous root beer but much to his disappointment, they ""ran out of chilled mugs."" Therefore, they brought out the root beer on ice, diluting its goodness.  Next to us, we had a large party finishing up their food. Our waitress drops a dressing container on the floor which explodes over to our side, splattering my boyfriend's $200 pants. She apologizes once (only once) and informs us that she will let the manager know. (side story: another waiter spilled an entire platter of melted Pazookie ice cream on my bf a couple months back) We order the rest of our food. The large party next to us has a drunk idiot who is yelling at his friend to leave the restaurant. For about 20 minutes, he yells out, ""HEY YOU! GET OUT! GET OUT!"" Servers and managers just walk on by, not dealing with this unruly customer. Then, he creepily stares at me and tells me to stop smoking. I don't know what the hell he was on, but I wanted to punch his Raider loving face in. Long story short, the Happy Hour mini pizza was good as always. The manager NEVER showed up until we approached him, the manager didn't comp us for the soiled pants, and drunk lunatics ruined our potentially decent meal. I hate this BJ's."
Nae M.,"Bell Gardens, CA",13,24,,1.0,5/31/2015,"Went there once, the service was horrible. The server kept forgetting to bring us basic things like napkins and refill our sodas.  He forgot to add toppings on our pizza like Pepperoni, and marinara so we got a dry pizza with cheese. I mean, how do you forget that esp when that's what we ordered. There was no Manager anywhere in sight so that place is not well kept together. Then I thought to give it a second chance and go back  Month later with my husband, It wasn't a good idea, super long wait. There was only two of us as apposed to there being other parties of 5 and 6 waiting. We waited 20 mins and saw they were seating people That came after us. What is that. The ladies there were just talking with other Co-workers, so unprofessional. It wasn't the best tasting pizza, it  was bland and was missing ingredients like garlic. it took 20 minutes to get us refills and get bacon on a burger, by that time, we weren't hungry anymore. I wouldn't eat there again."
Rudi L.,"Orange, CA",169,21,34,4.0,2/22/2014,Love this place. Great pizza and beer! Nice staff and nice atmosphere but since its close to the mall it can get pretty busy.  Overall I highly recommend it. :)
Brittany G.,"La Mirada, CA",99,5,,5.0,5/29/2015,I like to have a beer with friends on the weekends occasionally and when we decided to go out this lastime we decided to hit up the bjs in downey. We ordered a deepdish Mediterranean pizza and i got the harvest hef it tastes just like bananas! The bartender stacy was really friendly and made us laugh i believe i will be making this a regular hangout now.
DeanJ J.,"Irvine, CA",4,20,1,5.0,7/16/2014,"Loved their food, excellent ambience , service was great . I certainly know its teh Best BJ's I ever been in LA so far(tried more than 15 so far)."
Kimberly F.,"South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",176,7,,5.0,11/28/2013,"I Always come here to watch the games, have some great food and delicious drinks, great customer service and waiters are all friendly. love the bartenders!!"
Jonathon V.,"Norwalk, CA",1609,19,117,5.0,11/2/2011,"The Food is usually always good here. Burgers I'd say are there specialties(along with their beer!) and they also have some pretty good chicken and pasta dishes as well.  Service at this location is usually very good. I never have to ask for a drink  which is biggest thing when it comes to service! If your in no rush and want some great food, drinks perhaps watch a game...then this is one the best places to come! ...and don;t forget to try one their pazookies!  the Bomb!"
Japen G.,"Anaheim, CA",182,402,559,4.0,7/25/2011,"Location, Ambiance, and Service was Great! For now I give it 4 stars because we really didn't get to try their entres.  We came for drinks and ended up getting the Fried Artichokes.  Which was really good! As for the ambiance, definitely love the decor and feel of this place.  Much better than the Cerritos location.  This place has a more classy feel.  I think I compared it to feeling like you're in a Cheesecake Factory restaurant.  They have less TVs so I am not sure if this would be a good spot for sporting events. The service we good was pretty good.  The waitress was very patient and didn't seem like she was rushing us.  She recommended and even played along with some joking around. I will definitely will come back to actually try some of the entres to give a good sense of comparison to that of other BJ restaurants."
Jose N.,"Downey, CA",1,9,4,1.0,6/16/2015,"Terrible service.   The restaurant is kind of empty and for good reason.  After asking for beIN sports channel, the waitress agreed (nobody else was around in my section to watch the tv anyway).  Of course, nothing happened.  Service took forever in true Downey style.  Don't know why I came back here. After a year nothing has improved."
Irene O.,"Long Beach, CA",98,58,154,1.0,7/16/2013,"not happy with the service. it was around 9pm. I ordered a pazookie and the first time it came out rock solid, my spoon could not get through to it and the second time they went to remake it the dough was not cooked. also ordered jambalaya, that had a decent flavor but plate was very small for price. i'll stick to the location in Cerritos. thank you very much"
Bri C.,"La Habra, CA",166,15,1,1.0,1/18/2015,Probably the worst service I've ever had like even worse than McDonald's or something me and my girls literally waited 20 min just to be helped after we were seated then they take another 20 just to bring us water. The food was super cold I was in disbelief cause usually bjs is really good but this one was absolutely horrible I will not be returning to this location!!
Kimm G.,"Downey, CA",6,6,,2.0,3/12/2014,"Terrible service, they waitress took so long just to take our order, and she took forever just to bring our drinks. I love BJ's, but this is ridiculous."
marlon e.,"Los Angeles, CA",666,798,128,4.0,2/1/2011,Walked in here asked for a BJ and they kicked me out! no not really... Random night and I need some beer!  Every time I go to BJ's I confuse it with yard house I'm always looking for the long list of beers!!!  Anyway the appetizer that we had kinda blows but the beer is good... That's all I can remember cause I passed out!
