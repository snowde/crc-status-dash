Jose C.,"Bell, CA",1,5,,5.0,2/27/2014,Had a late dinner here and everything we ordered was delicious. Our waitress Shannon was super friendly and kept checking on us often. She definitely did a great job!
Rob Y.,"Pasadena, CA",120,345,878,2.0,11/8/2009,"I was invited here the other night for a get together.  I am familiar with the BJs, but this specific new one seems like less of a brewery and more of corporate blandness.  The decor reminds me of a hotel lobby or PF Changs.  Granted, it was obvious that they spent money fixing up the place with the nice 103"" HD Plasma TV, but this place really lacks distinct character.  Moving along, the food was ok,  the beer was good and the prices were reasonable.  The power went out briefly during the Laker opening game (shame, shame, we know your name!).  See my picture!   Bottom line, go here for beer and to watch the game."
Gracie R.,"Downey, CA",103,117,39,4.0,4/8/2011,"Service is always nice , the location is by the Stonewood mall Its a great ala carte place if you don't  feel like eating at the mall food court.. They have selection of alcohol which is awesome I super love the Thai Salmon good selection of appetizer too!"
April J.,"La Puente, CA",10,11,1,2.0,12/28/2013,Still waiting for dessert for 10 minutes now its crowded and it should be.more helpers hmm
Kim N.,"Buena Park, CA",234,229,15,2.0,6/11/2011,"It's a chain, I know not to expect much. Still I must ask, why???? Parking is insanely crowded. It's part of a mall, there should be plenty of parking in that giant ass lot! They said the wait for 4 people ('twas a Friday night) would be 20 minutes. Turned into 40 minutes. They finally seated us, server greeted us readily enough, but took a long time to bring drinks and apps, and forgot the settings. Dessert also took forever-I know it's a made to order pizookie, but come on!  PS my margarita was awful (but I at least enjoyed the seasonal beer). I feel that in general, cocktails are not good here, but I do like their beer selection. The good things (about BJs in general): wings, beer, pizookie. For those, I do put up with everything else."
Jamie S.,"Downey, CA",9,6,,5.0,4/28/2014,"Love to go here at least twice a week.  GERADO is our perfered server, he is great.  We have had other servers and all are just as good.  Very fast getting your food and drinks out.  The pizza is the best I have eaten by far. They have a drink called ""a drink like that"" which is my favorite.  Their house beers are great too says my kids dad."
Estephany A.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,27,2,4.0,1/21/2015,My boyfriend and I frequent this Bj's when all else fails. Meaning we weren't able to make it to LA. This place has an excellent selection of beers that my boyfriend enjoys and they most recently added framboise lambic beer. The happy hour menu is good and the customer service at the bar is excellent!
Amanda C.,"Norwalk, CA",0,8,,1.0,1/16/2014,"This review is for my visit last Monday night. Although I expected it to be busy, what with football and everything, the restaurant was surprisingly pretty empty. Despite that, the service was HORRIBLE, nothing compared to my other visits and definitely upset my family and I.  We sat at the bar area and at first our waitress seemed attentive and friendly, but this quickly changed to her being forgetful, rude, and neglectful. She messed up our drink orders twice, ignored our table to chat with and kiss up to (for lack of words) the two tables on either side of us, completely ignoring us and making it so we had to flag her down repeatedly. To make things worse, she argued with us when we asked to have something changed because she didn't tell us everything when we asked her specifics BEFORE ordering it. It was clear we didn't know about it when we asked her specifics, and I found it unprofessional of her to not be clear initially, be argumentative when we told her she didn't tell us, AND to try her best to make it our fault so as to not have to change it. And when she changed it, she STILL messed it up! By then, we had had enough. My boyfriend and I always love to tip (and generously, might I add), but even he was upset when I suggested leaving a tip, flat out pointing out that she had been sucking up for it from everyone else and didn't need it from us. I felt bad, but he was right. I'd suggest going to the cerritos location instead. But if you really have no other choice, just avoid the bar area if you can and opt for the dining area; I've had better service in the dining area from a trainee there, and that's not saying much."
Dianne P.,"Downey, CA",150,8,11,1.0,5/3/2013,The worse place every! Speaking of the Downey location. We have got back 3x in the last month and half and each time it has been the worse service. From getting our order wrong to a bug in my salad! And the nerve of the manager to say I put the bug there! I hate bugs like I would carry bugs with me! Won't be going back to the Downey BJ's! Will try the Cerritos location and see what happens!
Kathy W.,"Redondo Beach, CA",213,545,113,4.0,6/4/2011,"Every BJ's I've been to has been good.  Today we had a selection of lettuce wraps and the pizookie trio (the cookies 'n cream one is AWESOME!).  Awfully messy, though, wish they would offer the moist towelettes without having to ask for them."
Cindy R.,"South Gate, CA",33,34,5,4.0,7/16/2014,"i love bjs. (noooo not like that you sick pervs) lol. i love their beer selection. i either get the sampler they offer, or the belzbuth (french beer thats 13%) but yesterday night i decided to try their new limited time beer called the the hopper scotsman (something along the lines) VERY GOOD!! i love darker beers. IPAs, stouts, you name it. im open to new ones all the time. i just like the taste. although some people dont like the hoppy taste or bitter taste, I DO!  moving on to food, i love their avocado rolls. their tamarindo sauce is BOOOMB! pizza is good as well. wings are okay. they have this sandwhich/burger thats not on the menu that i love called the honey mustard chicken i forgot. but i recommend it. i like their pasta and their bjs burger. my brothers GF got the california one. GOOD! had no idea you can switch your actual fries for a loaded baked potato. ill keep that in mind next time i go."
Daniel M.,"Downey, CA",23,144,49,5.0,5/28/2011,"My new favorite place to eat.  This place is absolutely awesome. Great atmosphere, great service, great food.  The whole place is ummm GREAT!"
Maricela L.,"Los Angeles, CA",26,38,124,1.0,3/11/2013,We went here for my daughter's b-day and  I expected more from this place since there was people here waiting to go in I was like it must be good nah!!! To me it was too expensive for the yucky food well at least my food SUCKED! I had the chicken marsala when we got our plates the were not that hot they got cold right away and the noodles had no flavor. So definitely not going again.
Mrs L.,"Norwalk, CA",0,7,,2.0,3/21/2014,"Went to lunch with my fav grandson!  We were seated quickly and our drink orders were filled in a good time and accurately.   BUT it went downhill from there... We both ordered the Bison burgers with a wedge salad and an appetizer of Mozarella sticks. My wedge salad came, but by grandson's did not.  I asked about it and waitress said it should be coming soon.  Well my definition of soon was apparently not the same as hers!  it came more than 10 minutes later -- plus we still hadn't received our appetizer!  Hello -- did our waitress notice?  No! My burger and the waitress grabbed by salad plate -- Hello, I'm not done with it; she didn't even ask!  Where was my grandson's order? Why can't they grill 2 burgers at the same time? and our appetizer? As my grandson's burger arrived, the waitress did not offer us any condiments; we had to ask for them and we also had to ask again for our appetizer.  She left to check on the appetizer and came back with the answer ""the kitchen lost the order"" hmmm.  She offered to still fill the order if we wanted which we did (WHY?)   The appetizer arrived luke warm -- probably was sitting waiting for her to pick up and deliver to our table!   Waitress didn't offer any reasonable explanation nor did she offer to comp us anything.  Not good!  I gave her a minimal tip -- she was nice and cordial just lazy and non-attentive! Been here before at night with a large group and was treated exceptionally well!"
Misterychef f.,"Los Angeles, CA",19,39,18,1.0,3/18/2013,"This place is ok... I guess . Been here a couple of times, the best thing on there menu is the beignet and pizzokies. Food wise there avocado rolls are there only best , pastas:bland no taste huge lack of flavor, steaks:fatty and old, don't get me started on the drinks. When I first started to come to BJs I would always get a strawberry mojito, well the last time I went (almost 1 year ago) omg I felt like throwing my dam drink at the dam bartender! It tasted like if he just threw ice mind leaves and maybe half of 1 crushed strawberry and a load of club soda in a cup! Yuck !! We'res the liquor ? The mint and sweet strawberry flavor ? After that horrible experience I've never had another strawberry mojito from this place again. Other than that I rather eat and spend my money somewhere else"
Karen G.,"Paramount, CA",56,80,14,5.0,5/23/2011,"I've been going to this place many times but have never got the chance to write a review. This place is great, so many food and alcohol selections.   I went here with the boyfriend yesterday and got... Stuffed Mushrooms (about $4.00) DELICIOUS! Gourmet Mac n cheese (about $4.00) also DELICIOUS! Medium 2 topping pizza, mushrooms and green pepper ($18.00) I do have to say the pizza was ok, i've tasted better so i'm not really a big fan of the pizza here. Drinks:  vodka tonic $6.50, sex on the beach $7.50, white russian (less then $8)  I had 2 drinks, (really really good by the way for whoever was the bartender) and i was already feeling good. If you're a fan of the sex on the beach, don't get it here, its made and looks a lot different then the original sex on the beach.  We didn't sit at the bar as it was packed so we waited about 10 minutes around 10 o'clock for a table. If you're still up for dessert you MUST get the pizookie.  It's soooooooooo good!!  I've tried the Avocade eggrolls before and those are delicious too.   If you haven't tried this place yet, go try it!"
Troy H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1041,827,183,4.0,9/30/2010,"I stand corrected!  Credit is given where credit is due.  Tonight's experience was a total 180 turn!  After looking for a table in the bar, we found one that had just gotten up. A food runner quickly got a busser to clear the table, and we were sat, with our server, Shawnie, waiting to hand us menus.  She promptly brought our beers over after we decided what we wanted, and they were Ice Cold! Excellent.   We ordered a few appetizers: Artichokes, flatbread pizza, and sliders. All were cooked properly and came out promptly.   During our whole visit, Shawnie checked in on us, and after chatting, brought out our next round of beers Ice Cold!  Honestly, I have never been a fan of this chain. But after this visit, I seem to be re-evaluating my stance!"
Pascualy D.,"Lynwood, CA",50,12,2,4.0,1/15/2014,"Always a great experience when coming here. Servers are always on point, and the menu has everything you can think of. My personal favorite is the ""grilled chicken potato"". Drinks are also great, they probably make the best tasting cadillac margaritas. You also have to try the bjs blonde beer."
E A.,"Fullerton, CA",4,39,,1.0,6/16/2014,"Went on Father's Day 2014 and the yes it was busy but things started bad from the beginning. we were told it would be a 10 minute wait. We waited 20. no big deal except we were a party of 4. they sat parties of 6 and 8 before us within 5 minutes. then we were seated and had our order taken. we waited 1 hour for our food to come.  I was not happy that a table of 4 got seated when we did and they ate their food and were gone within the hour we waited for our food. The next table that sat next to us during the 2 hours we were there got seated and had their food in 35 minutes. I started timing table to see if it just wasn't us. Sure enough people around us were coming in and out and we were left to hang. I guess our money is not as green as everyone else's. I asked a lady who looked like a manager to check on our food because we hadn't been served in an hour and she just said, ""that's unacceptable."" Really? Good thing I said something otherwise people are left to fend for themselves. We went to BJs because Acapulco's was packed next door. The wait there was long! Now I know why BJs was a short wait. Terrible service."
