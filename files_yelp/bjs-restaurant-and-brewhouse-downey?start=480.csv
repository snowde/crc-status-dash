Michelle L.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,20,10,3.0,6/20/2011,"Tried the Saturday Brunch. No wait, they opened at 10 & at 10:30 we were the first people there thus seated immediately. We were a party of 7 but the hostess gave us only 1 brunch menu so we had to go ask for another.  Our beverages came quickly but we waited forever for our waitress to come back to  take our order. When the waitress finally came back, she was very unfamiliar with the brunch menu which she repeatedly told us. As we ordered, she peeked over our shoulder reading the item to find out what side items came with the meal. When my dad asked for wheat toast, she said ""I don't think that comes with toast."" He pointed it out on the menu and she felt the need to once again tell us she was unfamiliar with the menu.  If someone is unfamiliar with the menu, should they be repeatedly advising customers of that? No. Should she be waiting on more than 2-3 people? No.  When the food came, another young lady assisted her in delivering our plates. Not very good service on that end either. When I told her she had my plate,  instead of walking around the table to place it in front of me, she decided that handing it across the table,  crossing over the heads of 2 people, was a good idea. She just passed it over to me! This is ridiculous. How can you cross a plate over 2 heads? How difficult was it to walk a few steps over and place it on the table, which I'm sure they must have been trained to do??? I looked over at my sister & we both said ""What the..."" Overall the food was decent, as to be expected from BJs. The staff could use a little more training. We still left a generous 20+% tip, not because of the excellent service, but I think we felt bad for her!"
McQueen Q.,"Montebello, CA",4,105,18,5.0,7/28/2011,I love this place... The long island are the best!!!!!
Y. C.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,34,1,3.0,11/20/2012,"Four stars for service, and two and a half for food which is just average with the exception of my meal last night.  I ordered a steak and asked for medium... it was well done, sent it back and got another well done to replace the well done Aargh! .  I didn't want to wait any longer for something else and was hungry so I shared my BF's Salmon dinner. That was a tad overcooked also but not nearly as bad as the steak. The waitress was really nice and attentive and felt bad that I didn't get what I wanted. The manager came over and apologized as well and mentioned he took the cost off my bill. I should hope so! I didn't eat it.  I can't say I won't be back because I like hanging at the bar but I will never order steak again. I'll just save that for a real steak house. This place is more for simple meals like burgers and pizza."
Rain F.,"Reno, NV",247,711,906,1.0,7/31/2010,"This is another one of those establishments that have a ridiculous wait time but doesn't really serve food that's worth waiting for. I've already heard and read bad reviews about this chain in general. I was hesitant to try it and even more so when I was told that there's a 35 minute wait. What?! I wasn't that hungry anyway so I decided to stay and get this BJ experience over with. A table opened up in the bar area so we decided to go for it. By the time the server came over, we were already ready to order. Got a deep dish pizza. I wanted to see how it'd stack up against the Chicago deep dish that I liked. After almost a half an hour wait, the greasy fluffy mess they so called a pizza finally came out. Actually, it wasn't so messy since we opted to not have the chunky sauce. The first bite was a disappointment right away. I finished off my slice since I was already hungry. All this time our server vanished so we had to order from another server. I wanted a Midori sour. Waited for a good ten minutes or so when our server came by and place my drink to the table next to us. WTH! Good thing the other table refused it and told the server that it wasn't their order. First sip. Hmmm. There was something off with the concoction but I couldn't quite figure it out. I don't drink regularly but I know how my Midori should taste like. It looked like it with its signature green color but didn't taste quite like it. I liked it anyway because the alcohol was strong. One star for messing up my drink yet still making it taste good."
Gilbert D.,"Huntington Park, CA",1,5,,2.0,8/29/2013,"Good food, bad service. Been here many times and I can almost swear that something has gone wrong every time, but today was the last straw. Attitude problem."
Daisy G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,4.0,1/28/2015,I've never been disappointed with the service here! The servers are very friendly. I love their Southern Fried Chicken and their pizza! One of my favorite places to have dinner with my family :)
Damj S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/18/2016,"Food was okay, but service is another story,, got there at 12:30 my sister had already gotten a table for us walked in, sat our drink order was taken.  First round was water for us all, being that we all come from at least an hour away.. We were all hungry.  We placed our order then,, it took a long time to start to see any food, first the soups and salads together. Would have been nice to get the salad before the soup while we waited.  Then 5 min later one kids meal comes out nuggets with fries, then 10 min later fries but no Mac and cheese, then 5 min later baked potato and chicken Alfredo no Mac, some more time goes by pizza comes out.  Poor kids were starving and they had to wait till the end when the spaghetti and meat balls and baked potato comes out.. No drink refills we didn't even see our server.. For a long time.. So the people with soup and salad were not able to enjoy their meal with us because they got their meal first and the server was not around to get them seconds. Finally the server comes around with water only, no refills for kids drinks or anything, soup and salad was requested at that time and boy that was a long wait for it come out.  We also order dessert for the kids and wow that took long too, Then some friends were walking into the restaurant we invite them to join us, they ordered soup and salad,, we order dessert to keep them company, our dessert took long too, and some people got the pazzokie first and one person got it once everyone was long done with their dessert their food took long to come out and when it did they were not given any napkins or forks so another wait, they needed more soup and salad could not find server, finally she comes out and we have to request seconds, which took to long, that they had to go and take it with them, they were in a lunch break.. Wow I will never go to this location for lunch because I won't have enough time.  Next time I visit this location I will have to eat something before getting there maybe some in n out or something, because they the time I get any food I will be hungry again.."
Sim G.,"Whittier, CA",300,96,79,4.0,8/8/2012,"One thing i know is that I fucking hate the stonwood mall with all my might....BUT! this bj's is quite fancy looking (maybe because its new)/ Food is great, service is great. SO glad is not as trashy as the mall its located in yaaay!"
Jessica C.,"Los Angeles, CA",377,970,2230,4.0,8/2/2010,"I like this BJ.. so much better then the one in my area of Burbank.. since we did arrive late to stay at Golf and Stuff to play arcade games, we could only order off the appetizer menu after midnight.. ( booo) I was so hungry too but had to settle for calamari. It took forever for our drinks to be served to find out the waitress was being trained, she should had been trained to not drop my calamari on me or the floor, when I got home I found 3 pieces in my purse. They do last call at 1:30am I think it was since we stayed for awhile,  Other then that I actually want to come back to this one.. small little surprise for me.. I ran into a "" friend"" I hadn't seen in 7 years.. this planet is getting too small for me."
Michelle G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,93,64,4.0,8/13/2014,"Love the pizza's. You can build your own. I've tried BBQ chiquen, buffalo chicken, and chiken Alfredo pizzas. I thought the chicken Alfredo would be gross but its tasteful. Delicious spinach artichoke dip! Good heff beer. The service in my experience has been a hit or miss. Expect it to be super pack on Friday nights."
Laura G.,"Bell, CA",177,217,459,3.0,1/9/2013,"The menu is deceiving. The pizza is tiny and thin. The lemonade is delicious, and you have to ask for a booth if you want one, or else theyll seat you on the regular chairs."
Diana C.,"Downey, CA",23,12,,5.0,7/18/2012,"My boyfriend and I love this BJs.  We can bring kids, or come hang out at the bar.  Even though the food price is a little high, the food is well worth buying."
Gretel C.,"Altadena, CA",5,22,1,3.0,6/13/2013,"BJ's pizza is semi good, last time I went I asked for the alfredo pasta they took a while to serve us, and when we finally got the food my pasta was cold. The only thing I do love from BJ's is there Pizookie that's the only reason I would even think about eating at BJ's for there dessert nothing else, there customer service is average but they are all very nice and for that they get an extra star."
Nicole G.,"Berkeley, CA",15,80,,4.0,12/5/2010,"So what if it's a chain. This has become my and my bf's spot. Obviously nothing fancy and not my typical 4-star place... but there is something about the atmosphere, their not-so-fancy-shmancy food (which is a good thing in this case), and the fact that we can chill and watch a game or two, that does it for us.  every waiter/waitress we've had has been great and really friendly. i've only been disappointed with my food on one occasion (some salad that was extremely boring), but other than that, the drinks, food, and pizookies have kept us satisfied!  for me, the pizookies are too sweet. cookies plus ice cream make me feel like death so i eat a bite or 2 of my bf's. i've recently discovered their rootbeer floats :) they make their own rootbeer! even though i dont drink soda, i do make an exception for one of these every now and then! again...i'm usually anti-chain restaurants and 4-stars may seem high for a chain....but it's really not just for the food!"
Brunett Z.,"Gardena, CA",4,32,4,5.0,2/3/2013,"Yummy! I love this location. Baked potatoes are amazing. Bar is amazing. Must try drink is ""A drink like that"""
Sashin N.,"Downey, CA",269,54,10,1.0,4/27/2010,"This place needs better management, and better wait staff.  For some odd reason most of the servers have attitudes, and/or forget your orders.  On the brightside they have decent happy hour, and wine tuesday specials. I would steer clear from this place during popular games."
Jeremy F.,"Paramount, CA",0,3,,5.0,11/10/2013,"Great food service and extra friendly Shannon the server was on top of things ask for very fun and,knowledgeable of what to get she offered us a great micro brew Bj's own quick came out quick swell as entrée. Thanks be back for sure!!"
Mary S.,"Downey, CA",0,1,,2.0,11/8/2011,"Food is good! But if you're going with a large group, and I mean, more than 4, beware.... Went with a group of 10, on a Friday night. Waited 1hr, for a table. It was our girls/cuzns nights out, and we were joking around, waiting on others from our party to arrive, so we made the best of it. Waited 25 minutes, just to order our food, waited another hour for our food, (We ordered a bunch of appetizers) and after she brought our bill, it took another 30 minutes to take our payment. ...and please save me with all the eye rolling, waitress!! I know some people make it hard on servers, but me and my cousins, were so friendly, and tried to make it so easy on her. I won't be going there any time soon. At least not to the one in Downey."
Michelle E.,"Downey, CA",31,37,,3.0,2/27/2013,"meh, i really don't care for BJ's food. It's not bad it's just not a restaurant that would be my first pick to eat at. Their ranch is a 4/5 stars though, add that to anything and it instantly becomes better. What sets BJ's apart are their beers and pizookies!!! I love love love their Jeremiah Red, and you can have it mixed with their Berry Cider Burst which makes for a lighter fruitier drink. Love that you can order a keg from them (i think you need at least 1-2 weeks advanced notice) The quality of the beer is top notch for the price. If you  haven't had a pizzookie its a fresh out the oven cookie the size of your face with a scoop of ice cream on top. HEAVEN. the red velvet and white macadamia nut are the shit. Service is always usually prompt and friendly even though its usually super crowded and some of the items are a little overpriced if you ask me.. *WARNING* their floors are slippery AF! I can't tell you how many times i've almost eaten it on those damn floors. Idk what they wax them with but good God."
Jesse R.,"Monterey Park, CA",215,84,39,4.0,10/22/2012,This place is pretty good and the price is  not bad.  I enjoy the fast service and how they tend  to remember your name. Hmm  im not  sure if that is good or bad on my part.  But all kidding aside the service staff is nice and  very helpfull.  The manager  does take a interest and walks around greeting everyone and listens to  your ideas.  The  prices are good and the portions  good as well. The only wish  for  is  raise up the volume  on those home games  please
