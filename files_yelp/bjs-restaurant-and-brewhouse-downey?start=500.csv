K B.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",3,13,,1.0,8/3/2014,"I wish I could give this place zero stars. My drink order took 25 minutes! My food took an entire hour. I only ordered a mini pepperoni pizza!!!!!! Seriously, wtf?!?! Service was the absolute worst. So angry!!!!"
Chloe P.,"Downey, CA",0,10,,5.0,11/2/2011,"I go to this BJs alot and love the food. The service is OK usually. Tonight I went with my mom and some friends. Had a salad and avacado rolls and cream soda. Nomnomnom. We had a new waiter in training help us.  His name was Aaron and I kept singing ""Aaaron, Oh Aaaron"" in my head all night. What a cutie. He made our night.  I definately reccommend."
Keith B.,"Yorba Linda, CA",8,14,3,2.0,8/19/2012,"Just don't go for Brunch. Sunday morning NFL games in this restaurant have never been great, but in this season, they are worse than ever. A group of 5 went on 9/11/11 and this is what we found. First, there is a new corporate policy of no audio of the NFL games. Instead you get to hear the standard background music just loud enough to make it hard to hear those around you. That makes watching the games difficult, but what is excruciating is the poor service and general ""why are you making me work"" attitude of the staff. Some examples include : We never played the audio of the games. Otherwise everyone would be trying to get their games on. -oh you haven't decided yet? -when the food didn't come out, the manager was nice but the waitress would not accept reponsibility and just put it back on us saying ""well I kept asking if you needed anything..."" terrible. -when asked if the coffee could be warmed up, the waitress tried to convince us it was hot because she burned her hand... nonsense. When we asked about their amber beers, the waitress said they didn't have any. When we looked at the menu and picked one she tried to explain that ""that beer is only amber in color"" WHAT? Until they change their policy on the NFL audio and hire new staff we will not be back."
Ramil M.,"Los Angeles, CA",149,130,17,1.0,9/4/2012,"Worst Bj's ever! I've dined here couple of times especially for bball, and football, sub par service at best. But what really broke the camels back was the curve side order last night! Got a great white, chkn Marsala, mac n cheese, and all tasted like Styrofoam! it was so bland, how can you create chicken Marsala without any flavor...seriously?! Will never order anything from this location ever, following everyone else to Buffalo wild wings for now on."
Yogurt G.,"Long Beach, CA",0,20,,5.0,11/6/2014,"Awesome first time experience eating at BJ's. The atmosphere is very open and nice. The greeters/hosts instantly greeted us and made us feel welcome. On a Tuesday afternoon, we were seated at a booth right away. We ordered a deep dish pizza with pepporoni and sausage and it was so delicious! It was nice, hot and thick. Of course you have to order the pizookie, the original pizookie is the best and you will definitley feel full after leaving! Our server was helpful, attentive, and friendly. I cant wait to return."
Patrick A.,"Downey, CA",5,9,57,4.0,5/2/2010,"I have been a fan of BJ's since I was turned onto the Brea location.  When I heard they were going to add one to the Stonewood mall I was afraid that it would be the ""crammed into a mall space"" situation like the Montebello store. I was pleasently surprised to see that it is a corner space with a lot of windows and nicely laid out. The menu has a large selection ranging from standard bar-food (sandwiches, wings, nachos) to salads, extra large potatos and their famous deep dish Chicago style pizza.  Everything I've had has been good to very good. As this is a brew-pub I must make mention that their house brews are all tasty but this location in particular also has an impressive collection of non-house brews on tap (european, belgian, and american micro-brews). This is a great place to come after work but be prepared to wait if any basketball or football is on."
Shawn G.,"Tampa, FL",0,5,,3.0,8/13/2013,"Decent food and service, not a very good atmosphere. Was in town for work and was hoping for a little more action at happy hour."
-Aida P.,"Downey, CA",158,17,,1.0,6/4/2014,"NO STARS! I will never go back to this place. If you like hairs in your food and rude waiters, this is a place for you.   Today, I went for happy hour.  Order the flat bread pizza, it was ok but when my friend found a hair in the pizza I just lost my appetite. The manager came over and apologized and asked us if we wanted anything else.  Well, I wanted the check but my friend was hungry and so we order the sliders and the spinach dip.  The sliders were very dry, almost choked.  They never brought us ketchup or any kind of sauce to put on the sliders.  The ordeal  continues, when Alex our waiter brought us our drinks, he spilled my drink all over me and never bothered to come back to check if it had been cleaned.  So we asked him to clean it up and bring us some ketchup, well that really made him so mad that when he brought us the ketchup,  he slammed it down on the table and angrily wiped off his mess.  As Alex was cleaning, my friend told him thank you and he didn't acknowledge her so she told him again, she told him 3 times and just ignored her. I thought he was rude.  I think there are plenty of places to eat in Downey but BJ's in Downey will not be on my list."
Ray E.,"Santa Monica, CA",222,119,9,3.0,8/9/2012,"BJs BJs...you know, for a spot that is the in middle of Downey with very little to choose from to satisfy the seasoned foodie..you don't do a bad job. It provides what you would expect from a typical BJ's menu, but what I was impressed with the most was the take-out service. They had a spot where you can walk-in, make the transaction, and peace out! Back to your oh-so-lovely 9-5 routine. It is also a lot faster and more clean-cut than the other take out 'chain' like options (Elephant Bar/Chili's)."
N M.,"Whittier, CA",6,26,7,5.0,1/4/2014,"Excellent service... Omar & Amanda were excellent servers!  Lisa the manager was beyond accomodating to our large party reservation. This was our first time hosting an event here,  and it definitely will not be the last!"
E H.,"Shaker Heights, OH",2,52,,4.0,2/26/2013,"Good Stuff.  Came for lunch with two others.  Two of us got the unlimited soup / salad ($7.50) and one got a pizza with all the toppings ($14.50).  They kept the soup and salad coming and a special order (I like my wedge salad without bacon) was no trouble. The food is fresh and delish.  Not what I would call healthy, but I suppose that is more about my choices (clam chowder).  I have noticed you need to be there for lunch before 12:00 because it does get really busy."
Perla V.,"Carson, CA",65,2,,1.0,2/20/2013,"The service wasn't bad but i wasn't great. However the food was. the soup was served sloppy and it was poring from the side. My cajun pasta was served sloppy. On top of that  it didn't  taste like anything, the chicken was good, but the pasta was so plain.  I really wish i would of gone somewhere else."
Isaac A.,"Whittier, CA",62,11,10,4.0,1/2/2012,"Besides the rough start to our nieces postponed birthday lunch. The end results to our lunch was satisfying, and great. Thanks to our waiter, Brandon, and manager who's assistance at the end of our dining experience."
Kim G.,"Pico Rivera, CA",175,853,122,5.0,11/21/2009,"Came here today for my pops 76th birthday..  We were going to sit in the dining area, but we found a booth at the bar.  So we sat at the booth, which was good, since we didnt have to wait 20 minutes to get seated. Our waitress, Jessica, was very attentive. That was a plus. Kept the beers coming, and the soda's refilled. Props to Jessica, since it was a busy night. Now we ordered, BJ's signature pizza, and it was very good. Then again, i love there pizza. Since this place is fairly new, I didnt notice anything out of the ordinary (bad service, power outages, etc.) Everything seemed to flow.  We ordered some chicken pot stickers, that were also good. My mom's ordered the chicken fried steak, and I must say it was rather tasty.  Now since it was my dads bday, we did get a free bday piezookie (I think thats how you spell it), which was very good, and warm...mmmmm. Would I recommend. yes.  Just if you do get there, expect a wait.  We thought it was bad when we got there at 630pm...  We left at 830pm, and there was people waiting in hordes, inside and out."
Diaz J.,"Downey, CA",167,35,4,1.0,5/27/2012,"Wont be coming back here. They messed up our order, they took forever and never brought us any refills. The place was dead and the service slow. I would hate to be here when its busy."
Sonia R.,"San Francisco, CA",11,23,1,1.0,9/9/2009,"I understand that this place just opened, and that maybe the majority of their staff is inexperienced... but come on. First, the spacing in the restaurant is very crammed.  There is a section of individual tables runs down the center of the restaurant... but because they're crammed in the middle of the booth section, it doesn't leave much room for someone to walk past this.  Best part of this is, you HAVE to walk through it to get to the bathroom at the other end.  It feels like you're walking down a movie theatre aisle;  you don't want to give your butt to someone to squeeze on by, but you don't really have any other choice.    Second, I'm not sure if they were understaffed, or if the waiter just didn't know how to manage his time, because the couple at the table next to us saw him about 5 times before he even decided to check up on my table.  I sat through my entire meal without anything to drink because our waiter never followed up with us.  NOT cool.    Third, its located at the Stonewood center in Downey.  This place already has enough commotion going on with the Acapulco restaurant in one corner, and the Olive Garden in the other.  The parking lot to this place can barely cater to those going to the mall and those two restaurants mentioned, and they add ANOTHER restaurant? Not a fan, if you can't already tell."
Fern X.,"Los Angeles, CA",23,181,325,3.0,2/10/2010,"When my girlfriend whispered to me, ""I'm going to take you to BJ's for your birthday!"" I got so excited until I carefully went back and analyzed her statement completely because the only word that went through my mind was BJ's. After carefully researching via the World Wide Web, I discovered BJ's was actually a dining restaurant and well established across America.  So we ventured on a Friday night and at first glance the presence of the restaurant can be a little overwhelming but you'll get used to it since hundreds of germ-filled citizens will be surrounding you. Since we accidently didn't have reservations, we were handed some sort futuristic contraption that would repeatedly blink red, implying that an empty table was suddenly liberated. The menu looked ordinary so I wasn't blown away by their selections. The food although was exceptionally delicious - it better have been considering it's Bruce Wayne expensive there! When it comes to the appetizers, one necessity I'm going to add is to try the astonishingly delectable Avocado Rolls. You will NOT be disappointed and I will take that advice to my grave! All in the all, the experience was definitely worth trying at least once but next time, we'll just go to Ihop which can never be beat."
Fernando M.,"Los Angeles, CA",57,50,2,4.0,7/31/2014,"pretty damn good place to eat and hang out...service and prices and food were better then expected, cant wait to try this place again"
Leslie A.,"Downey, CA",22,80,6,1.0,3/27/2012,"seriously, this location is so ghetto. Parking is a nightmare. The food tastes the same as other Bj's so I much rather go elsewhere."
Maria R.,"Bell, CA",27,8,1,4.0,5/30/2014,"I really like this place for lunch. Great service and great food. Good lunch specials for under $10. Unlimited soup and salad combo, can't go wrong with that. They have pretty tasty non alcoholic mocktails. Peach berry iced tea is my favorite. I've never had an unpleasant experience with any of the servers here, always prompt, polite and check back on me."
