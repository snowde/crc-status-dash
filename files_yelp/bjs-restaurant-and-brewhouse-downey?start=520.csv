Ed A.,"Downey, CA",0,18,3,1.0,5/17/2012,"Terrible service, hair in my cajun pasta will never return to this place. Management needs to change and needs to keep staff on their toes."
Michael A.,"Monterey Park, CA",1,50,5,5.0,11/19/2013,Great service and great food for happy hour price. They helped my girlfriend with crutches. Server was very attentive. I will return to this location.
Sandra P.,"Downey, CA",0,24,,1.0,6/4/2011,"I visit BJ's quite often, I've been to Cerritos, Brea, Huntington Beach and never had an issue ...  Sorry to say that the Downey location really blows! Just got home and figured I better type this out since I'm still miffed!!  First off we went to the ladies room, which had not been cleaned...toilet paper dispensers empty, trash can overflowing  but they were kind enough to place a roll of toilet paper behind the toilet...EKK!  We got seated and waited and waited and waited till someone came over and took our drink order then we waited and waited and waited for her to come back and take our food order. Once we got our food we had to ask for plates (ordered Pizza) and they brought us little appetizer plates because they were out of regular size plates...they were busy but not busting at the seams busy!! I asked for a side of ranch and I waited and waited and waited...note to people bringing out food, don't ask if you can bring me something if you're not! Our waitress came over to let us know she was going on break and someone else would be taking care of us...ya right! What really nailed the coffin shut was the wonderful manager! We brought all the above to his attention and the fact that the booth we were sitting at had dust bunnies and that most of his staff is  busy standing in the corner yapping and we said ""it's not up to BJ's standards"" to which he apologized for but also said a smart @ss remark ""if we weren't up to standards we wouldn't be so busy."" WOW!! Really???"

Fran T.,"Bell Gardens, CA",0,11,,4.0,8/23/2012,"I come here alot, love the atmosphere, the people are very nice. This is a good place to grab a bite especially drinks, they hook it up! Love coming here to watch a game."
Tony W.,"Lynwood, CA",20,5,2,5.0,11/11/2012,"Great potato skins, awesome pizza!"
Tony G.,"Downey, CA",92,105,9,2.0,11/13/2009,"This BJ's has a much better beer selection than any other one I have been too. They carry their own beer which all of their restaurants do, but they also have a decent selection of some other craft beers. They carry Stone, Firestone, and Fat Tire. This is the best part of this place. I have been here a few times since it opened and every time I come here the service is always sub par.  On this particular night i came i with some friends and we sat on one of the outer tables by the bar. We sat there for a few minutes and no one came to help us or let us know that they will come help us shortly. So we went up to the bar and ordered our drinks. My friend ordered some food which took a long time to come out. When he finally asked the bar tender the food came out promptly. The food was cold and it felt like it was just sitting out there and they had just forgotten to bring it out. The service here is horrible I would not recommend come here to eat, well at least in the bar area. I would come back for some drinks at the bar. They also have a huge TV which is usually playing whatever game is on at the time."
Sam A.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,9,,2.0,4/19/2014,"i love the food here... cant go wrong with any pizza but the service in this location sucks!!!  wrong food comes out, not all the food come out at the same time, refills take for ever, etc."
MeAndHim C.,"Los Angeles, CA",50,71,46,1.0,10/6/2013,I wish I could give this place no stars. This was the worst experience I've ever had. When I got there I went and sat at the bar while I waited for two coworkers. It took my coworkers about half an hour to get there and while I was waiting no one came to ask if I wanted anything to drink.  When they finally got there this server came up to us and asked if she could start us off with something to drink. I said I would like a pink lemonade. One coworker got a strawberry margarita and the other got a blue moon and we ordered an appetizer and pizza. She come back with two blue moons so we kept one and told her she was wrong. It took her about  20 minutes to bring the right drinks and our appetizer had yet to come out. When she came we asked where it was and she was like oh you ordered an appetizer ?  We were mad but we let it slide and told her the appetizer. A few minutes later a bartender said that the computer was supposedly broken and needed our appetizer order. We were furious so we went and talked to a manger and explained to him that we didn't want anything free but that we were servers and that the service was so bad so he said he would bring our appetizer out. After we ate our appetizer she came and dropped our bill off without even asking if we needed anything. So we asked where our pizza was and her face was in complete shock because she had forgotten. She took the bill and left and had a different server come to us and say that the computer was broken and that they needed our order again so we told the manager that we weren't going to pay for any of it and he said that it might have been because she was having a bad night. When we walked out she was outside smoking and laughing. I will never come back. The service here is always bad
Kat M.,"Downey, CA",68,113,26,4.0,5/16/2011,"I always get the California Chicken Sandwich with wedge cut fries. I used to work in the mall, so I would dine here often. I still eat here when I'm in the mood for table service in a chill environment. They have a huge selection to choose from like pasta, pizza galore, burgers, sandwiches, stuffed potatoes, soup, meatloaf, etc., Also, they have a nice bar and many delicious drinks to choose from. If you like avocado, the avocado rolls are a must."
Diana S.,"Montebello, CA",3,3,,1.0,3/22/2014,"Never coming again worst service ever didnt get my food until an hour later by this time my appetite was gone , manager came to apologize . I think it might be understaffed so safe yourself a trip ."
Donald P.,"Downey, CA",262,39,32,5.0,9/5/2011,"A few nights ago we stopped by the BJ's in Downey for another one of their amazing gluten free pizzas. Just like before, the pizza was fantastic! At the end of our meal, the waiter came by and suggested a ""gluten free desert"". I was blown away, and asked him to repeat himself LOL! It is called a ""boozokie"" or something like that, kind of a cross between a cookie and a hot fudge sunday. So here is the deal, you must tell the waiter that you have a gluten intolerance, and they will create a boozokie that is gluten free. It was fabulous!"
Casey O.,"Pico Rivera, CA",46,8,,1.0,1/25/2011,"Not only was the service terrible, when I forgot to get my card out of the book they drop checks off in, the server decided to keep my card and go next door to the Alcapulco's and blow over a hundred dollars there and more than that the next day at Starbuck's. This is the shadiest staff I have ever encountered in a restaurant and they made an awful first/ last impression. ZERO STARS."
Grace V.,"San Jose, CA",125,112,45,4.0,7/19/2011,I am only rating their Happy Hour.  Healthy appetizers and a great beer list=FANTASTIC!!  Try not to come with a large party last minute.  They'll be mean to you and it will ruin the good times.
Oliver M.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,23,,4.0,1/4/2012,One of the best customer service in town! Only problem with this Bjs is the fact its always super busy. But the crew is super nice and do their job well. And the food is tasty like at any other bjs...
Valerie T.,"Downey, CA",107,70,27,5.0,1/19/2011,"Agh! I love this place. Everything I've tried, I like. Their lunch special items are pretty sweet too. I usually get the chicken teriyaki plate. I looove the mini bruschetta. The avocado egg rolls are mouthwatering and I love the dipping sauce. The santa fe spring rolls are good. The kids menu is great and mix & match too for my picky little monster princess. I always get great service their. Once I went for my birthday on a Saturday and I totally forgot that lunch special was only mon-fri. I mentioned that I forgot and without even assking her to,she went and asked the manager if she could allow us to order lunch special items @ lunch special prices and the manager said yes! Awesome! I've gotten this waitress twice I'm going to get her name next time and write a nice quicktip about her. Oh,and the buffalo chicken pizzas friggin ridiculously awesome. I LOVE YOU BJ'S."
Liz M.,"South Gate, CA",21,19,5,4.0,5/31/2011,"Their avocado egg rolls are an absolute must. Also, their artichoke and spinach pizza is so good, I don't even mind the bits of onion in it."
Aaron B.,"Cerritos, CA",677,72,2,5.0,7/22/2011,This is a restaurant i love to go to during lunch breaks which is right down the street from my office  . The service is good and so is the food.
Irene G.,"Moreno Valley, CA",1,7,,1.0,11/26/2012,"Went Sunday morning before noon and we were a group of 15 and the service was awful. Since we were a big group they started us off with 2 waitress and within 15 minutes in the second waitress went on break and never came back till 2 hours later. The staff did not communicate to one another which is why everything came out wrong. My Dad ordered the Chicken Marsala which I guess the manager stated (2 hours later)that the kitchen ran out of Mushroom but like I said ""Communication"" the waitress never made this aware to us and my dad oh so loves mushrooms waited for someone to fix his order but It never happened so after waiting and the waitress given us the run around that the manager is on his way I had to get out my seat and approach the manager my self and let him know what is going on. He did apologized and did give us 3 Pizzokie and took off my Dads Chicken Marsala off the bill. I just don't think that was enough for the miserable time we had to go through with our families. Dont get me wrong I love BJ's but this place has been the worst experience I have ever had."
Zayka Z.,"San Francisco, CA",182,116,145,3.0,4/4/2011,Your aver Joe type of place... Reasonable pricing ok food.... We frequent this place cause we love the outside patio and with kids who don't sit still we don't have to worry they'll wonder off....
