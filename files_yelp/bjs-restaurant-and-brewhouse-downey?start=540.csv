Em M.,"Downey, CA",1,18,3,2.0,11/11/2011,"Usually a good place to eat, but this last time the food took forever (half hour plus wait!), our order came out wrong and the waitress tried telling us we were wrong! Like if we had not eaten there before.  Definitely an attitude problem which ruined our dinner. The only redeeming act which warranted keeping the two stars - the pizookie we had for dessert. Oh yeah and the manager who came over to our table to apologize.  Definitely won't be coming back for a while."
Claire G.,"Long Beach, CA",252,89,79,3.0,3/8/2011,"The stuffed mushrooms are good, but not as tasty as the Cheesecake Factory's stuffed mushrooms.  The spinach & artichoke pizza is delicious!   The new berry crumb cake was a little on the sweet side, but still berry good!"
Chris R.,"Downey, CA",0,3,,1.0,10/6/2013,"Literally one of the worst restaurants around.  My wife likes this place and frequents it often.  Until recently she went 3-4 times a month.  I beg her not to go because every other time they screw up our order.  And it's take out!!!! We are not taking up space in their restaurant.  Today we called 4 times, the first 3 times we were on hold for 3-5 minutes each time.  We ordered and items were not correct, sauce on the side, napkins, etc.  I mean this isn't difficult.  We order food from the brain trust at this location, they repeat it back but fail to get it right.  Now I have screaming kids who can't eat the food.  Try Islands or someplace that actually trains their employees!!!!"
Ric J.,"Downey, CA",96,71,42,3.0,1/23/2011,"I was expecting better. The place is loud, not good for business meetings. Service B-, food B-, price C+. Could have been better. Nice design of interior."
Laura M.,"Cerritos, CA",4,114,,3.0,12/16/2012,"I used to like their tomato bisque... but the last few times I ordered it... the oil was clearly separated and floating on top (gross!)... but I have to highly recommend the Ahi tuna salad. Ahi is fresh, they use dark leafy greens, include large slices of avocado and the dressing is amazing. It is very very good. That's what I now order every time!"
Queen G.,"South Gate, CA",0,5,,3.0,9/16/2013,Came to have a nice time sunday night and they just take really long with their service. However the pizza is so good. 3 stars for effort. Their gratuity is ridiculous. I shouldn't have to tip you what you ask for. You're already getting paid to work. If I want to tip you I will and the amount that I want to.
John V.,"Downey, CA",68,8,,4.0,11/18/2010,I come here quite often and never had any major problem. It pack during the weekend but it what you expect when it a mall.
Jgjgjg J.,"Santa Rosa, CA",209,85,8,4.0,9/24/2009,"thats right, I'm reviewing a BJ's! go ahead rolls your eyes, but this place is def. an underdog, and i always go with the underdog. always. i really dont know why everyones hating on this spot. GRANTED, it IS in the stonewood shopping center... and it IS IN DOWNEY. butttttt they still have bomb ass heff, the foods decent, and the avacado egg rolls are ok! the main screen above the bar is super nice. its not your cheap ass projector looking thinger ma bober. its got a crisp clean look to it! the servers were pretty chill and everything was legit. i'm definitely a fan, and since its close by, ill be here again!"
ed v.,"Santa Fe Springs, CA",15,74,5,4.0,5/26/2010,"The whole menu here looks delicious, very satisfied with the food, the pizza is ahmazing! I also go the Black Cherry Soda that they make there, it was also ahmazing. :) Oh yeah and the Pizookies are ahmazing as well! :P The cookies are sssssooo good!, and the ice cream is just right. My coke did take awhile to get refilled tho :/ and the prices are a lil high too."
Erika D.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,18,12,3.0,3/14/2010,"This place is nice. My boyfriend and I went just last week during the week. Nice atmosphere, and nice staff. The only complaint I have is why don't they serve Energy Drinks??? That's all. Good place to watch a Laker game at, but always call in advance if you want a table."
Yadira R.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,42,38,4.0,4/15/2010,On the weekends it's a bit overwhelming but at my job we go there to celebrate coworkers b-day at out lunch hour and it's great we love it.
Ash M.,"Cerritos, CA",33,55,12,4.0,4/7/2011,customer service is always great except when they took $5 without asking so that was their tip hope they needed it as bad as they took it and also the portions are usually enough to share or keep for another day the bathroom is usually clean and if you dont like your drink theyll usually take it back and off your bill
Monica S.,"La Puente, CA",41,18,3,4.0,3/28/2010,"I was impressed with the building, pretty nice for a BJ's. Had to wait for a table when it was obvious that there was tables available. But since I've worked for restaurants my whole life so I know it was a server/table ratio situation. Well we should have waited longer to get a better server. The food was good, my only complaint was the service. A little on the slow side and she totally forgot my hubby's beer! Other than that a great time."
Edgar G.,"Huntington Park, CA",0,1,,2.0,11/17/2012,Only good thing out this restaurant is the beer!!! They need to cut down on all there menu choices and  make there food more tasteful...quality not quantity...only reason why beer taste good is cuz it gets delivered done already
Antonio C.,"Downey, CA",6,62,,2.0,9/3/2009,"It's BJ's so it's undeniably good, but maybe since it's new the vibe is still really cheesy and packed all the time, anyway i think it'll age well"
Freddy P.,"Norwalk, CA",2,14,2,1.0,6/19/2010,"I only gave it a stare cuz it is BJ's and it made me. Don't get me wrong, I love BJ's. Just not this one. I've been a patron for over 10 years. I don't know maybe I am a little bias because I think the Cerritos location is best in So Cal area. I have been to many; West Covina, LB, both HB, Torrance, and this one. Here, the service is crap. I think it has one of the smallest bar areas of them all. The other customers are so so, you have mean mugs and cold stares. All in all just not a happy and friendly atmosphere. Better times at dive bars. I even asked the waitress what was up and she said she didn't like here either and that she used to work at the cerritos one; wished she could go back.  Two poor thumbs down!"
RYAN R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,4/10/2011,"Service was very bad, I ordered two pizookie's.. Had to wait half hour for one and the server (DENISE) was very rude and forgot about the other pizookie had to wait another half hour just for a pizookie... Very poor service for a restaurant, our server didn't even apologize for the mistake and the delay.."
John S.,"Placentia, CA",2,76,,4.0,6/2/2011,"Similar to other reviewers, I have been to this place for many time - happy hour or dinner.  Yesterday a group of 10+ came for happy hour...bar was crowded, we were seated at the dinning area.  We were able to get happy hour prices on our drinks!  Semantha was our cute waitress that helped us...she was attentive to all of us!  I will be looking for her service next time when I visit BJ...."
Arturo D.,"South Gate, CA",1,5,,1.0,9/21/2011,No need for a long detailed review waitress was slow finished my drink and literally took an hour for a refill (NO TIP FOR HER!!) their computers crashed so they had to hand write the receipts to my surprise they had me add up the total haha I guess they weren't too good at math.. Never going back to this particular bj's. NO STARS!
Marilyn P.,"Huntington Park, CA",21,23,6,2.0,4/11/2010,I think this restaurant is OK. I did expect better EVERYTHING ;( The hot wing are great.
