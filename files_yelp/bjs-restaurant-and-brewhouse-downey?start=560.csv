RHONDA S.,"Downey, CA",1,2,,1.0,1/6/2015,"went to the downey bj's for lunch to go on 1/5/15.  i usually order the pizza and salad and that's what i should have stuck with.  i ventured out and ordered the chicken pesto sandwich; which the taste ok but it was a little dry, like nothing on the bread but a little pesto and a little melted cheese and barely any chicken!  the presentation was horrible just a little half of sandwich floating in a box that was way too big for the size of the sandwich.  it was the same with the side salad, there was barely any lettuce in the container it looked really sad!  for the price it definitely was not worth it.  they have gotten really skimpy with the to go lunch portions.  i begged my friend to come here because it's usually okay (portions and price).  she was very disappointed with what she ordered as well, which was the chicken quesadilla, it was made with a corn tortilla that looked like the size of a taco shell!  she also had a medium size container that contained a spoonful of beans.  needless to say, she sarcastically thanked me for making her come here and said she never wants to come here again!  unfortunately, i have to agree i was very disappointed as well!"
