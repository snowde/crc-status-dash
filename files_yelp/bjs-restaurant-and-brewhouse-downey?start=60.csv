Jenny S.,"Buena Park, CA",1,18,14,3.0,5/7/2016,"Came in as a group of 12. We got sitted pretty quickly. I think their food choices are okay but over priced. I got a burger (forgot the name, I think bbq pulled pork) with a cole slaw and crispy thin fries on the side. Generous amount. I couldnt even finish the whole burger. Taste was mediocre. Only downside was that our server was not attentive. My friend had to keep on looking around to find our server to get her drink refilled. Towards the end, she even raised her hand to get his attention. What are we, elementary school kids trying to ask if we can go to the bathroom? If you are a server for a big group like 12, you should check more often, not just abandon us. Once again their food was okay. Not that decent. Its just same for all the other BJs locations. I was never too fan of them but my friends insisted that we come here for a get-together."
Aurora L.,"South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",23,12,,3.0,7/20/2017,"The appetizers and their pizzokies are so delicious. The entrees in the other hand are just okay, not bad but it doesn't wow me either. The service was good and it was clean."
Frances A.,"Norwalk, CA",104,1,,5.0,3/11/2017,"Went to have a few drinks and some appetizers on Friday around 6pm with family and friends. Our server Gabriel in the patio area was excellent, he was very attentive, he was quick with his service, and he was the most energetic server I have ever encountered at BJ's.  Unfortunately, the food runner delivered our appetizers to the wrong table (no fault to our server). We had to wait another half an hour for our food to be sent to our table, but while we waited Gabriel made sure to refill our drinks and accommodate us as much as he possibly could."
LM C.,"Downey, CA",18,35,29,3.0,1/3/2017,"Only three stars. Disappointed with the food. Had the shrimp penne which was tasteless mild sauce flavor. My companion had the jambalaya and it was also la. King flavor. Could it be that the lunch cooks are not as skilled as the dinner service ones? The service was decent, that's why 3 stars is appropriate.  Really did enjoy the top shelf margarita"
Jose G.,"Lakewood, CA",196,13,7,4.0,3/7/2017,"Nothing but good things about the BJ's in Downey and their staff!!!  It is my #1 choice for lunch on a daily work week.   I probably know their whole menu front to back and have tried every single dish they have to offer.   My favorite being their newer Brewhouse Classic Tavern Cut Pizza paired with their house Hefeweizen... you can never go wrong with this combo! My only complaint is that the quality of their food has been on a decline as of the last 4 years. Still, one of my favorite places to go to for lunch and/or drinks!!"
Ness D.,"Norwalk, CA",0,17,6,3.0,7/4/2017,"Do not use their delivery.  PLEASE READ IF DINING IN OR USING DELIVERY. Delivery person never asked me to sign a receipt, so I will be checking my bank statement. Ordered full ribs with 2 sides. And some pasta. One of my sides was missing. I called the manager to see what he could do. He said they will make me a brand new one. I said the side is fine no problem. He insisted. He asked how soon I could pick it up. I said i asked for delivery for a reason. He said he can email me a $15 coupon. I agreed. It was $25. Thanks! 3 stars because those ribs are bomb. And the card was nice."
Nora S.,"Anaheim, CA",137,13,,4.0,2/5/2017,"Ambiance is really nice for family and couples. Server names Megan is amazing, mature, and professional. She was speedy and responsive when I ordered the wrong thing (my fault, not hers).  The food in general is ok, but lamb shank fell off the bone; delicious!"
John A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,1,4.0,8/7/2017,"Stopped by the Downey area place and we were not disappointed at all. Staff was extra friendly and the food was delicious as always. Veronica, our waitress even provided my kids with a fresh fruit snack while they waited for their food. Thank you!"
Jen F.,"Los Angeles, CA",150,122,24,1.0,10/9/2016,"The food and cocktails at BJ's aren't of good quality. I guess if you enjoy beer, you'll be safe. But besides that, you'll be disappointed. Everything is so salty or over sauced!!! The pizza's are soggy and hardly contain toppings.  Anyhow, sometimes I'll meet friends here because they like it.  Service and food are always disappointing.  From the host/hostess to the waiters, it's never a positive experience.  You can tell they don't like their jobs.   In the early days of this location opening there was one waiter that was excellent!  He could make you forget how bad the food is.  I don't see him anymore, he prob moved on or works a diff shift.   The last visit really made me unhappy and I emailed the customer service contact. I got a generic reply telling me to give them another chance. I did and that will be the last one. Eating out is expensive and I will spend my money where it's appreciated."
Jannie M.,"San Pedro, CA",1503,408,1089,4.0,6/16/2015,"I came here like 20 minutes before 7 which is the time that happy hour ends.  It took them 15 minutes for them to take the order.  That was the only issue it did take long but once the order was placed the drinks were served fast. We did order an appetizer which we thought it was going to be out first than our food but no it came out at the same time. I did like that they kept checking in on us but at the same time not being pushy, they were really nice."
Fred M.,"Norwalk, CA",0,3,,5.0,10/25/2017,I do takeout on a regular basis. The only time it gets 5 stars is when Mark helps me. He's always friendly and even knows my name when I walk in. He even stores the salad I order in the fridge because I love my salad cold. Order the blackened salmon here. So good on a cold salad.
Klarissa M.,"Santa Ana, CA",539,6,,5.0,4/8/2017,Adrian Lopez & Chris Miller made the night a great one. Amazing customer service from both of those gentlemen thanks for returning our phone  I'd give you 10 stars if it was possible
Gina G.,"Los Angeles, CA",209,66,165,2.0,3/2/2016,"My boyfriend and I were looking for a place to eat and I suggested BJ's since we'd both never been to this place before. We arrived and walked into a small section specifically dedicated for take-out and only take-out. I guess we weren't paying much attention when we walked in and missed the fact that there are two entrances and both entrances are for two  different things. The man behind the counter cleared our confusion and led us to the hostess. We totally felt like dorks.  Our nice hostess asked if we were okay with sitting in one of the booths to which to we replied with a yes. I really liked that she asked us first instead of just sitting us anywhere. Im pretty sure this was mostly due to the fact that it was a slow day and most tables were unoccupied anyway.  Our waiter took no time to head towards our booth. He was attentive the entire time and kept the refills coming. To start off we ordered the avocado egg rolls appetizer. The egg rolls were all right. I wasn't too fond of the overly mushy texture but my tastebuds enjoyed the flavor; the tangy sauce was amazing too. For our entrees I ordered the Hickory Smoked Brisket and Bacon Burger while my boyfriend tried their new Baked Deep Dish Ziti. My meal was merely okay. It was full of flavor but there was not much of a wow factor to it. My boyfriends Deep Dish Ziti on the other hand was phenomenal. I kept sticking my fork into his plate (sorry not sorry). Half way through our meal our waiter informed us that he was leaving and that another waitress would be taking over. The waitress was just as attentive as he was. Awesome customer service.  Our appetizer and entrees took quite some time to come out. Hunger doesn't know patience and neither do I. I didn't understand why our food was taking so long since it wasn't very busy that day.  I don't know if I see myself returning to this location again. I see a lot of reviews raving about pazookies and other dishes so I'll keep that in mind, but theres definitely better out there."
Briana A.,"South Gate, CA",0,9,,4.0,7/14/2017,"4 stars just for our server chriss! Excellent hard working server. Me and a friend went for lunch today to catch up and Chris's didn't even mind that we were taking forever to put in our orders! He was super attentive and quick with whatever we asked for. Also, other servers were checking up on us too! Food was average. A little over priced for the quality, if you ask me! But nothing to complain about! Thank you criss for the outstanding service (and he seemed super busy) !!!"
Rene H.,"Costa Mesa, CA",19,23,11,5.0,1/9/2017,"OK so here's the deal, I'm going to be a daddy. My girlfriend has so many cravings right now and I'm more than happy to accompany her, with her request. So we are at BJ's and we were fortunate enough to get a server by the name of Miriam.not only did she mentioned to us that we can have multiple chicken wings barbecue flavored, bone and bone out etc. I thought that it  was phenomenal for us to give us many ideas since it's so hard to satisfy cravings. After three drink changes she still had a smile and I must say that this place is amazing I have the clam chowder bowl. And she had three different varieties of chicken wings. Two thumbs up BJ's. Miriam you rock."
Adrienne V.,"Cerritos, CA",9,1,,5.0,4/22/2017,We come here often and receive great service but tonight we got exceptional service from Cortney! She was very attentive and knew what we needed before we had to ask. Thank you Courtney for exceptional service!
April Y.,"Buena Park, CA",260,525,245,1.0,5/3/2015,"I've been to numerous BJ's, and this is by far, the worst one.  My family and I get here on a pretty busy night- NFL Draft and, Ducks playoffs, and Clippers/Spurs Game 6. We were expecting to catch the various games on TV while we were there. Upon entering, we noticed there was only ONE screen in the bar and just a few TVs around the restaurant. The one screen showed 4 different channels, but the NFL draft was shown larger than the other 3 channels. The smaller screens were barely visible from the bar, so we requested our server to change the setting to make it all the same size. Once the screen sizes changed, it was so much better. However, due to the higher bar tables, it was so hard to see the games because of the heads blocking our vision. This location really needs to add more TVs throughout. It's a pretty small location, but there should be at least two more TVs in the bar. What is a disappointment.  On top of that, our server at the bar was awful. He barely came around to check up and did not smile once. However, we ended up with another server when our original server went on break. This new server was awesome (1 star for his service and kindness). It was a drastic difference."
Jess G.,"Downey, CA",347,347,1551,2.0,4/14/2015,Their burger is alright. It was salty and some patches of the burger were extra saltier than other patches of the burger. I don't think it was worth $7.75.  During a weekday lunch rush they didn't have anyone at the take out counter yet they had 3 hostesses at the hostess/seating counter. I had to wait for one of the busy servers to notice me and give me my order. How to fix the problem? Train one of the 3 hostesses kickin it at the hostess counter to also do take out orders and that would take a load off of the servers. This wasn't the first time I've had timing issues with this BJ's location. They're either understaffed or being managed by time insensitive managers. Another time I went to dine in during a lunch break and actually had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. Another other time I was there for 3 hours on a Saturday night with a large party. This BJ's has been here for 2+ years so I don't know why they haven't worked through their system of doing things.
Ryan M.,"Orange County, CA",910,912,3408,4.0,4/2/2015,"I don't often write about big chain restaurants, but when I do, only because I have to recognize them for their service. This is a special one. With my girlfriend and I having a busy day in SoCal, we decided to eat at a general restaurant. We didn't want anything fancy, but something safe. With a good track record, we dined in at BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse in Downey. Located at the north segment of the StoneWood Mall near the Food Court, you'll find BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse. I always loved the name BJ's. More particularly because of a TV series called, ""M*A*S*H*. There is plenty of parking at BJ's/StoneWood Mall. Unless its Christmas Season, then worry just a little. We walked up to the entrance of BJ's and I saw two doors. One regular swinging door, but I saw a REVOLVING door. OK, when I come to LAX or when I am ever in New York, I will always want to go in & swing around. Once we walked into BJ's, I noticed how huge it was. Tall ceilings & huge dining areas. They were even hosting a little party in the patio area.  We checked in & requested a booth seating. The staff gladly found one for us. I love that they did find a booth, but it was one of those for like six plus people. More room for us to feel comfortable. Our host for the evening was Melinda. We started off with drinks. My gf ordered Lemonade ($2.75) and I ordered a Club Soda ($2.95) with a glass of water with lemon. Not sure why Club Soda is a little more expensive than regular soda. I didn't even have a hangover since I don't drink. I should have just ordered a Sprite. When Melinda asked us if we were ready, my gf answered before she finished her question. Let's say that we were very hungry after our busy adventure through SoCal. She wanted to start with an appetizer. She ordered the Flat Bread Margherita Pizza ($9.50) with no tomatoes. We would order our main meal a few minutes later. I know my gf loves this flat bread very much. After inputting the appetizer in, Melinda gave us a few minutes to look over the main course. My gf and I were discussing what she should order. I had my eyes set on a salad. She had two options for herself. It was either the BBQ Chicken Pizza or the  Shrimp Scampi Pasta. I told her to order the Shrimp Scampi Pasta because we had the flat bread. When Melinda came back, we started our order. I had no questions about my order. I ordered the Barbecue Chicken Chopped Salad ($12.95) with a separate side of Honey Mustard dressing. My gf asked Melinda about her preference, but ultimately my gf went towards the Shrimp Scampi Pasta ($16.50). Once we placed our order, the flat bread came. Great timing for two hungry people. Just think of it as a small version of a pizza. Love the cheese & the small thin crust. Don't forget to add the Parmesan cheese. I had finished half of my Club Soda and Melinda was already on top of it by getting me another glass. About 10-15 minutes later, our food arrived. Like many other Yelpers, we took pictures of our food. My salad was delicious with the mix greens with the onion rings with the barbecue sauce. Also, I loved how every time I munched into the salad, there was one ingredient felt like I was eating an apple. I am not sure if it was the lettuce or an ingredient I am not familiar with. Dipped both the onion rings & chicken slices with the honey mustard, it made the meal more spectacular. As for my gf's dish, she tried the Shrimp Scampi Pasta and was already feeling nauseated with it. She had me sample it and the taste was very bland and dry. According to the menu, its supposed to be ""Flavorful shrimp tossed with delicate angel hair pasta in a light blend of olive oil"". The pasta felt like the oil was never there and the pasta felt like it was poorly cooked. She couldn't deal with it and flagged down Melinda. My gf told her that this dish was just not right at all. I had to agree with her. So, my gf wanted to have her dish switched with one of her two choices. It was the BBQ Chicken Pizza ($15.25). The male supervisor or the Shift Manager came by our table with a sincere apology & would get the order taken care of. The Shift Manager came back & personally delivered the Deep Dish BBQ Chicken Pizza. He apologized for the food preparation. The final test: My gf's enjoyment. I didn't get to try this out, but my gf loved it. We were back to high spirits with the dish. Although her food was not originally done right the first time, it was making sure the customer was taken care of. When it was time to check out, we saw that Shift Manager took off the order for the Shrimp Scampi & comp'd the BBQ Chicken Pizza. Now, this changes everything for my reviews. I don't write reviews for big places, but service like this requires recognition. In a perfect world, things should be done  with one shot. However, we live in a realistic world. We learn from our mistakes & we make the situation even better. Thank you BJ's! Yelp...I Live, Breathe, and Share my Reviews for everyone to read. Come Join Me!"
Brian L.,"Downey, CA",83,27,7,3.0,11/13/2016,"Here we go... As always (At least how I've seen it), good group effort to bring out appetizers and salads. The skins and mozz sticks were tasty. Our server had a pleasant demeanor and although we were disappointed without the berry cider, things happen and he was apologetic about the issue, which is quite appreciated. I usually do a refill test when I eat, my thing is that a customer's drink (at least the non alcoholic one) should never go empty and if it is...ask each time about refills or handle business if they're using the restroom. We were only asked about refills towards the end, so our server missed at least 3-4 other opportunities to inquire during our visit. Anyways, the issue rarely occurs at this location, but it is good to remind people every now and then to ensure that such an epidemic of no refills doesn't occur. Got it? Good."
