Matt C.,"Bellflower, CA",297,224,320,5.0,7/19/2015,"We like to visit BJ's on Tuesday because it's ""Half Price Wine Day."" Today we had Cayla as our waiter. We love the Watermelon and Feta salads so naturally we started with those. Cayla delivered our wine and poured it for us. She maintained our glasses by stopping buy with her excellent, non-intrusive service. We were in the mood for pizza again and had the flatbread pepperoni which was excellent. We ordered another bottle of wine and Cayla poured it throughout as expected. We come to BJ's fairly often and find the service hit or miss - but usually okay. Cayla is definitely a cut above the rest. She pays attention to the details.  The restaurant was very clean and the food was very good and the service was EXCELLENT."
Rou M.,"Irvine, CA",131,340,216,4.0,4/5/2016,"Came with a big group for work lunch.  Everyone liked their food.  Service was fast. We tried the mixed appetizer with avocado spring roll, some type of chicken roll and breaded cheese sticks.  I personally had the kale brussel sprouts salad with blackened salmon which I really liked.  A good mix of sweet and salty and not too heavy.  The salmon was delicious.  Someone else had the bison burger and it was delicious.  The steak was too fatty apparently.  I tried the unsweetened tropical tea and it's refreshing.  A few people got the strawberry lemonade which is pretty popular here.  They only have green and black and tropical tea as unsweetened."
Mari A.,"Downey, CA",1,40,10,5.0,5/6/2017,Celebrated my baby's baptism at BJs. The food was excellent! $4 mimosas and bloody Mary's. The wait staff was very accommodating when we had more guests than were invited. They were very attentive and we never had to ask for anything. Thank you BJs for helping us celebrate!
Azure H.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,3,,5.0,6/13/2017,"Went in on Sunday with my family for my birthday dinner. Tim was our server, and he definitely made sure we all had a blast! And gave us great drink recommendations lol awesome service! Definitely be back"
Patrick G.,"Pico Rivera, CA",0,22,1,4.0,5/20/2017,If you like chili's you should like this place as well. The food is always endulgent. Don't bother going if you want to count your calories. Great selection of homemade brewsky's. Lots of t.v.'s for multiple sports. The deepdish buffalo chicken pizza is my favorite and the giant pizookie is so sinful.
Chris G.,"Downey, CA",1,28,,1.0,6/8/2017,I keep coming back trying to give them a chance but the service is terrible every time. The hostess were rude and lack communication and the Manager needs to speak to his customers. Shirley the waitress was attentive and we appreciated it.
Kelsey B.,"Downey, CA",0,1,,5.0,2/26/2017,"Amazing customer service provided by Lizbet definitely exceeded our expectations! Food was great, & pazookie to die for! Definitely recommend! I would ask to be seated in Lizbets area!!"
Alyssa N.,"Stanton, CA",1,1,,5.0,3/16/2017,Natalie was me and my husbands server today and she did AMAZING! She is extremely friendly and hospitable and helped us to enjoy our time so much more! We will definitely be coming back to this location
Hannah B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",35,90,73,2.0,4/15/2017,"The bar staff are very friendly and on top of their stuff. Unfortunately after we were seated it all went downhill. There was no refills of drinks. I ordered a BBQ chicken salad that was completely dry and maybe had two stripes of BBQ sauce on it. Worse part was I had to ask three people for silverware so I didn't get to eat my salad until around 15 minutes after I got it. Our waitress was really unfriendly and made us feel like we were being a hassle even when we asked to pay. She took about 10 minutes to return our card after she took the bill and when she brought it back she handed it to my husband and said ""there you go"" and walked away. No have a good night, no thank you, nothing. The BJs in Cerritos, Orange and Huntington Beach have friendlier staff so I advise you to go there."
Dee R.,"Downey, CA",51,255,589,2.0,2/24/2016,"I have been here at least 100 times but I don't always update my review because it's usually the same: food is mediocre, service is mediocre, it's fairly noisy inside, wait times are never very long, if even a few minutes at most, so nothing much new to report each time unless I have a major issue.  Today I placed a to go order, well, two separate orders, actually. I spoke to Chris. He was very nice and accommodating. Lolly took my order and was also very nice over the phone. The problem lies in the fact that I called and placed the order at 1:36. Lolly said it would be between 10 & 15 minutes. I get here at 1:50. I park in the designated area and call. They place me on hold for a few minutes and Chris comes back on the line. He says Lolly will bring my order out momentarily. FIFTEEN minutes later and I am still sitting in the car like an idiot siting for my order. BAD SERVICE. Boooo BJs."
Enrique F.,"Orange, CA",108,50,25,5.0,1/6/2017,Me and my girlfriend went in today during the busy lunch hour and we got helped right away by a young man we sat in the bar area great service and food was perfect !! He recommended the strawberry mojito and we loved it thanks we will be back soon!
Jonathan D.,"Lakewood, CA",1,3,15,5.0,5/23/2017,I had the prime rib dip which was good but a little on the salty side. The mango IPA was delicious and very refreshing. The service made up for the meal. Our server Liz was awesome. She was very attentive and helpful.
Renee L.,"Downey, CA",11,47,19,1.0,4/30/2017,"Super slow service. Asked for extra napkins but never got them. Asked for extra silverwares, they were still making them?!?!?! How is that?????  It's middle of Sunday. They should be used to the crowd."
Andrew G.,"West Covina, CA",0,2,,5.0,2/13/2017,Great service. Only came for a few beers and apps. but Candice R. remembered to ask us about our reward points and brought us everything in a timely manner!
Claudina A.,"Pico Rivera, CA",40,20,21,5.0,4/1/2017,"Had a great server today his name is Chris Baker.I must say he was a outstanding waiter he was talking to us about the new order system they are using and we were impressed on how fast. We recived our appetizers and drinks he was on point .. Love it we go a lot to BJS it's one of our favorite resturants.  And if we keep receiving service,like this I will be there every weekend food was great as well as the drinks and we,head a awsome waiter thank you Chris for the outstanding service you gave us today looking forward to my next visit..."
Jaime A.,"Pico Rivera, CA",136,1,,5.0,6/17/2017,Food was amazing although I only got a sampler.! Service was fast and on point. Thanks Courtney! We will definitely come back!!
Marisa R.,"Downey, CA",0,1,,5.0,9/16/2017,"I give this BJ's five stars JUST because of my amazing waitress Angie! She was great, very helpful, very friendly and overall just outstanding. I would go back just for her and the churro pazookie she recommended. Left her a good tip and a nice message on the receipt because she deserved it. She was even sweet enough to run out to the parking lot just to thank me!"
Sal V.,"Pico Rivera, CA",78,6,,5.0,3/13/2017,I took my family out tonight and had a great experience because of our severe Joe R. He was very cool and pleasant to us and really took care of us during our dinner. Our pizza came out quick and hot and great. He made sure we had our refills. Hopefully we get him next time we go. I usually don't write about servers at all but when you get a great server like him you make an exception.. thanks Joe!
Steve E.,"Montebello, CA",0,25,2,4.0,9/12/2017,"Great place to call in food and pick it up. They also have this great seasonal beer called the Grand Cru that I try to get when it's available. Would have been 5 stars, but the don't watch their pick up parking places to make sure random people aren't parking there instead of the actual customers."
