Pasha R.,"Fremont, CA",51,2,,5.0,8/10/2017,"This is one of the few brew houses I've visited that had food as good as, or better than the beer. I ordered the Mushroom Swiss burger and was amazed that they had a full mushroom cap instead of cut up/minced mushrooms sprinkled on it. The burger was perfectly cooked to order (medium rare) and the grilled asparagus was perfectly seasoned. The beer was also amazing. I ordered an IPA and the wonderful waitress asked if I'd like to try a few different drafts before I ordered the one I wanted.  The waitress (I forget her name) was amazing. She did her job above and beyond the standard I have come to expect. Super polite and detail oriented to my order, while at the same time, extremely friendly. It's as if she was the hostess of a dinner party. Even after the check was paid for, and I kept talking to my friend; she didn't rush us or imply that we had to go. Truly a phenomenal experience.  I will definitely be coming back. Although, the standard has been set. ;) 5/5"
Tom O.,"Hilliard, OH",1,19,6,1.0,10/29/2017,"BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse #bjsrestaurantandbrewhouse Tried the call ahead while on the way there... got transferred to mgr phone because of 5 adults three toddlers and and bounced back to counter... arrived at 5:25 pm and was acknowledged as call in group and was told by host I'm going to get table set. 10 mins later came and asked name and text # as he said it was never inputted. As we wait, larger groups going ahead. Then host says he is getting manager. Manager never came. Now going on 6:12 I ask again why other tables going ahead of us? Host replied they had reservation in which I responded as did we as you recognized a half hr ago! He stated three high chairs was the issue so I said make it two and a booster.  Host then states yeah we are a bit short handed....I see what seems to be the manager and he proceeds to place blame on other manager who left he said, great, another excuse I said. The manager proceeded to walk away and not want to deal with the issue.... really? I'm about to spend over a hundred dollars and you don't want to figure out how to seat us? Ok we left and went to Bob Evans who was more than happy to accommodate all of us! Not happy at this BJ's by any stretch! You outright blew it!!!!"
Jamie H.,"Grove City, OH",23,6,2,2.0,9/18/2017,"I would like to start off by saying that I have been to this location several times in the past and have had little issue.  On Friday, September 15th, 4 of us went to this location around 7:30 pm.   It was crowded, but putting ourselves on the preferred list helped.  We only waited 15 mins to sit.  Well, that was the only quick thing of the evening.  Our server walked by and said that he would be right with us.  Almost 20 minutes later, he finally took our drink order as well as our food order.  I have to say I do not like the electronic ordering they have moved to.  I feel like writing the items down and then putting them in the system would be faster.  The food ordering alone took forever (compared to how long it might normally take).  We all ordered regular menu items and I ordered the asian chopped salad with no onions. So then......we wait........ I wish I had kept track of how long it took because it felt like an eternity (especaiiyl since we were already so hungry).  Yes, it was a busy Friday night, but it was just ridiculous.  When the food finally arrived, he brought me the entirely wrong salad (something with tuna).  I was very unhappy at this point.  OH and also unhappy with the skinny margarita that tasted like fresh lemonade.  I tasted a hint of tequila at the beginning and then it was just lemonade.  I promise I am not exaggerating.  I would've complained but it would've taken 30 minutes just to get a new one.  I promise I do not like cocktails with too much liquor in them-it was like there was none in it.  So when my salad came out wrong, I was pretty upset.  I didn't complain.  OH and my son's cheeseburgers had no cheese.  We realized there was a mix up but the server tried to argue with me about it. When my salad comes out 15-20 minutes later, it is perfect.  So so good.  That's why this review has 2 stars and not 1.  Thank God for that salad.  And after we finished, the server didn't even ask if we wanted to have dessert (which for me was fine since I was full but my friend wanted a pizookie).  We also realized it would've taken forever so we just paid and left.  I do enjoy this restaurant, but I might wait a while before deciding to go again.  Horrible experience."
Tracy W.,"Greenwich, OH",9,74,42,2.0,1/4/2018,"I ate here with a small group last evening for a business dinner. I must say I have been to BJ's several times, and have always thought highly of their menu selection and service. Tonight however the service was horrible and the food was not up to par. For a midweek evening, they were not extremely busy. Our waitress seem to have too many tables and was running around trying to keep up with the demands. There were five of us in our group. We each got our drink orders which was all simple as well as an appetizer which came out in decent time. We then ordered our entrées and some came out OK and some needing attention, however we had to wait for our waitress to come back. The rice mixture was extremely dry and we requested something different which did not come out until we were all done eating. We even told her to not bring it since the meal was over however she didn't listen and brought it out anyway. A couple of us ordered the small steaks which were just OK. We all thought overall the food quality was just not that great tonight. Our group has eaten here several times over the past few years without issue but something seemed off tonight. I'm not sure if they were understaffed or what but it seem like every time we turn around we had to wait for something which should not have taken but a few minutes to take care of. Even our bill we received was wrong and belong to another table which really topped off the night on a wrong note."
Brandon L.,"Columbus, OH",38,550,12,2.0,1/3/2018,"The most recent experience, via take out, was disappointing. It wasn't too long that we had to wait....but the chicken seemed like it had been sitting under the lamp for a while. And the pizza? Pricey, sparse on toppings and a bit undercooked. Sure, ive had fairly good experiences dining in. I've had fish n chips, and pasta. Maybe you should just avoid the pizza and the chicken? The parking lot is always crowded."
Scott C.,"Hilliard, OH",10,65,244,4.0,9/21/2017,"Love BJ's. I have been there 3 or 4 times I have got pizza every time would like to try other things but there pizza is to good to get anything else it's delicious 1 of my favorites in town and that's saying something because I'm a pizza fanatic and we have a great pizza scene here in central Ohio. They are also a brewery and there beer is delicious and also have a great craft beer selection besides there own, service is excellent and the place is just really cool!"
Kevin C.,"Columbus, OH",1389,247,1105,5.0,6/12/2017,"If you like pizza, you should try BJ's pizza.  It's deep dish and loaded with toppings. They have lots of different pizzas to choose from as well as many other delicious meals.  We had a large group and everybody ordered something different.  Everybody was happy with the service and the taste of the meal.  I ordered the CHICKEN BACON RANCH PIADINA - Filled with seasoned, grilled chicken, smoked bacon, ranch, tomatoes and BJ's signature five cheese blend. With ranch for dipping. I added a bowl of Piranha Pale Ale Chili, and to drink I ordered the BJ'S ROOT BEER. There were several different flavors to choose from and since refills were free (which was really nice as I have had to pay per glass at other restaurants) my next drink was the BJ'S BLACK CHERRY SODA. My meal was excellent, the service was great, the server was prompt with the order and taking and refilling the drinks."
Emma B.,"Columbus, OH",5,24,54,2.0,7/29/2017,"So let me just start this by saying that we've been to this BJ's before and had always had a good experience. Today, however, was extremely disappointing.  We were seated quickly on the patio by our request since it was 75 degrees and sunny. We looked through the extensive menu and decided we wanted nachos as an appetizer (nachos aren't an actual menu item but they can make it on request since they have all the ingredients to). They came pretty quickly, though there was a bit of a mix-up when the nacho flatbread came instead of actual nachos. This was understandable because, as I mentioned, nachos aren't an actual menu item.  Anyways, the nachos (when they came) had little taste and were not very appetizing at all. They were OK except for the chili sauce, if you could call it that, which drenched all of the chips. The sauce had no spice, or taste for that matter, to it.  After we ate some of the chips because we were pretty hungry, we had to return them. Our server was very nice and apologetic about it. My dad's chicken tortilla soup (which I tried) was the definition of so-so. It tasted pretty good but was lukewarm which made it unappetizing.  I got the ""enlightened"" Mediterranean chicken tacos and they were disappointing to say the least: just lacking flavor overall. The grains that came on the side were even more flavorless than the tacos. And I agree with another review which highlights the ridiculous cost of the food, because my pretty small, devoid-of-flavor tacos were around $10.75. That's pretty ridiculous.  By and large, BJ's has let me down. I'm not sure if this was an abnormality, or if they're changing for the worst. But one things for sure- I won't be rushing back."
Mike N.,"Clarksville, TN",65,376,517,4.0,3/5/2017,"Although it was very crowded for Saturday lunch, we found our seats right away at a high-top table in the bar section. Otherwise, the wait for table in the dining area was 15-20 mins per maitre d'.  Service was very prompt by Michelle. She was very attentive and courteous all through our meal. I appreciated her great customer service. I found poor customer service increasing in an alarming rate these days even at a very nice restaurant.  As for food, Portobello Swiss Burger was exceptionally good per our son (except pesto sauce since he is not a big fan--I tasted it and found it extremely salty). BJ Brewhouse Berger with applewood smoked bacon and cheddar cheese was also very good. I liked their potato wedges since they were well seasoned.  Perhaps due to the crowdedness of the place, I felt it was very loud. We had to listen to each other carefully to carry out our conversation over lunch.  Overall very good experience with good food and very good service."
BJ H.,"Portsmouth, VA",11,105,39,3.0,9/30/2017,Nothing bad and nothing good to say.  Everything was just ok.  Good place to take the fam but don't expect an gastronomical delight.  It is truly a solid 3 Star place.
Peter G.,"Columbus, OH",209,52,89,2.0,4/5/2017,"This place is alright if it wasn't for the ridiculous prices for some of the menu items.   We came here twice, once for burgers and another time for pizza night. The first time was decent to good in rating.  We got the mozzarella sticks which were about $9 since they looked delicious in the picture and description.  We thought the price was a bit high but we really love some good mozzarella sticks.  They came out and to our surprise were just lukewarm.  The cheese was not stringy in the middle and they tasted like they've been sitting out.  They had a good coating although the entire experience was ruined by the temperature of the food and the high price tag. The burgers were good, although I got the bacon guacamole burger and I thought I had managed to remove all of the spicy stuff from the burger when ordering.  I would have never known this burger was spicy in the first place as there is no mention of spicy anything in the description.  Anyway, the burger comes and it turns out even though I removed jalapenos and the pepper jack cheese, it was the guacamole that was spicy as well.  I would have not ordered this burger if I knew the main ingredient on there was spicy.   My partner got the hickory brisket and bacon burger which was a whole other story.  That was actually a very tasty burger and the barbecue sauce they used was also very good.   We finished with their famous chocolate chunk ""Pizookie"" which is what saved this place from getting a 1 rating.  It is basically a freshly baked cookie in a ""skillet-like"" tin as a dish.  It was delicious and the chocolate chunks were big and plentiful.   On to our second visit for the pizza night..... Oh....where to start with this one?  Well, we came in and it was decently crowded with people ordering pizzas. First off, the deal is for half off a large pizza....which honestly brings the price down to exactly what it should be priced and what it's worth.  We got a deep dish pie and added a few toppings of pepperoni and mushroom.  The pizza came out and was hot although you could see that they were skimpy with the cheese as there was many red spots of sauce all over the pizza where cheese was missing. Here is the main problem with the pizza.....it just had zero flavor and didn't really taste like anything!  The sauce had no flavor, which could have turned this tasteless pie into something decent.  The toppings were scarce and also didn't have any sort of seasoning or flavor.  The worst part is the bill came out to about $20 for just this pizza!!!  And that was half off!!!  I think $20 is actually overpriced for this pizza, I would have been furious if I had ordered this without the special!!!  Overall, I think I give this place another chance just because of their pizookie's.  Also, they have coupons on their app if you have an iPhone although I don't think they work with their weekly specials.  If you're going to come here, please make sure you're doing it on a weekly special night so that you don't end up wasting your money for some mediocre food."
Carla D.,"Columbus, OH",23,93,41,4.0,5/12/2017,"I've never been to BJ's until tonight. I'm not really into chain restaurants as the quality is always lacking. I agree with others that the menu is overwhelming; it's literally a book. A heavy one.  We started out with chips and guac, and they were delicious. The guac is thick and chunky, full of very fresh avocado.  I ordered a small house salad and the vegan lentil soup. The soup was amazing!! I asked for the recipe but naturally they wouldn't give it to me. :) Service was quick and friendly, even at 6:30 on a busy Friday night. I'll be back for that soup!"
Q-Tay S.,"Columbus, OH",11,47,61,5.0,5/6/2017,I've been to ALL the locations locally. No complaints. Aways good service. Food is delicious. Lunch menu is reasonable. Just wish they'd serve some of the lunch items for dinner too. I love the quesadillas on the lunch menu but can't get them for dinner.  They also took the chicken bacon ranch pizza off the menu when they changed pizza crusts. Which was disappointing b/c it was by-far my favorite meal there. They offer it in a deep dish option but it doesn't taste the same or have the same white sauce.  I have tried other items and have found other options.  I crave the pizookie. It's amazing. Especially the oreo flavor. Just typing this review my mouth is watering for one.  Also don't miss out on the deals by joining the rewards program. I've gotten money off of meals and free desserts w/ my points. It's great!!!  We've met here w/ large groups and they're always accommodating. It can get busy so try the call ahead seating option. Or download the BJs app to your phone for seating options and other rewards.
Greg M.,"Strongsville, OH",42,193,413,2.0,4/18/2017,"Came in on a Tuesday night for dinner.   Best thing this place had going for it was half price wine. Ordered the Murphy Goode Cab. It was very good, and outstanding for $5.25.   But that's where the praise stops.  Sat at the bar.  Barmaid had blue hair. Was friendly enough, but not very attentive. Cup ran dry for what seemed like ever before asking for another.  Food came out reasonably quick. Started with the chicken tortilla soup. Decent taste, but had to go on a search and rescue mission to find the chicken.  Had a half slab of ribs and roasted Brussel sprouts. The sprouts were cold when brought out from the kitchen, and very dry. No one ever asked how the meal was, so Yelp became the only outlet.  The ribs were ok. They were hot (yeah), and tender, but lacked any smoke flavor and were much smaller than baby backs I buy from Costco. Sauce was ok, but nothing special, and they only sauced 4/5 of the rack (I'm assuming the cook's hand was holding the rack while he brushed the sauce on and never bothered to finish the job.) Never offered desert (not that I need it) and asked for another glass of wine so I could write my review.   Already had the check, so now I have two."
Kevin S.,"Cleveland, OH",0,15,,4.0,11/29/2017,"I have been to this location several times and I have been to some of tbe other locations. The food is always good. It's not great, but good and very consistent. The menu is huge and has something for everyone. The deep dish pizza is very good. The Thai Peanut Noodles are very good, but a little small of a portion. They have decent burgers too. The beers are pretty good. The bar is a great place to sit and watch sports."
Wendi S.,"Columbus, OH",0,4,,5.0,10/24/2017,"This is one of the only places that can cook a steak to perfection. The Brewhouse Blonde beer is excellent, but if that is too light for some, they have darker choices as well. This visit our server was Catherine, and I have to say it was probably the best service I have ever received. So head here, get your steak and brew the way you like it and ask to be seated in Catherine's section. You won't be disappointed!"
James L.,"Chicago, IL",0,9,,1.0,11/12/2017,"The curbside pickup is one of the worst experiences I have had. On Friday Nov 10th my family decided to order from BJ's for a curb side pickup. I decided to take one of my kids while my wife stayed at home with the other. Since I was planning on staying in the car I did not put a coat on my child even though it was 20 degrees outside.  After arriving 5 minutes early I called. After 10 minutes of the phone ringing I figured no one was going to pick up. I then called my wife and explained the situation. We already paid for the food online so could not just drive away. She then got into her car with my other child and drove to the restaurant. Since patrons who were eating at the restaurant took all the remaining curbside spaces she had to park across the lot and bring my 2 year old to my car so she could sit in the car with our other child and I could go inside. During this 15 minutes I was waiting I continued to keep my phone on and it rang for a total of 25 minutes. I then went inside and noticed 2 servers filling pick up orders. There was 1 person in line. They immediately asked me what I was to pick up. The phone was ringing non-stop and ignored the whole time. In the 5 minutes I was up there waiting for my order to be brought out no one answered the phone, it just kept ringing. Taking advantage of someone hanging up I called with my cell phone to carryout and it immediately rang and stopped when I hung up. This verified to me my calls were going through. In short. NEVER use the curb side pickup. Your calls will be ignored while the servers stand inside with a 2:1 ratio of people in line and servers. Also NEVER pay for your food upfront. This way you can always leave and just not pick it up if no one answers the phone. UPDATE: After the response below on 11/19 I emailed the listed address on 11/20. It is now 12/6. I have not received any response. After 16 days I do not expect a response from the company."
Jaime M.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,100,49,4.0,7/25/2017,Great restaurant!  Have been dining at BJs from West Coast to East since 2001.  This location has it together!  Great service and food!  We sometimes do Curb Side and love that they have it available! The cauliflower tacos are my favorite!
Kara S.,"North Olmsted, OH",26,11,,3.0,12/11/2017,Sat at bar and got great service! Food was just okay though. Pizza was served barely warm and fries were not freshly cooked. Have been to other BJs and really liked. This one was not on par.
Matt P.,"Flemington, NJ",0,2,,2.0,11/5/2017,"$14 for some iceberg lettuce with two chicken strips cut up to look like six. Great service, but that hardly makes up for it. They should be ashamed to charge what they charge for what they serve. Don't waste your time or money here."
Steve M.,"Freeport, IL",2,32,34,4.0,10/5/2016,The beer is truly awesome. The food be a little careful but the pizza was great. Appetizers just so so. Calamari was less rings and more tentacles not my fav. Wings served with ranch...really?  BC with chicken.  Overall really good and I'll be back. For sure for the Jeremiah Red. Shit that good.
Aaron S.,"Hilliard, OH",69,4,,2.0,9/15/2017,"This place looked promising when we pulled into the parking lot, it was packed. However, this could be the most unremarkable pizza I have ever eaten. You can do just as good buying a frozen pizza and saving $15.00 of the $22.00 medium pizza I got.  Maybe the other stuff on the menu is what gets people to come...it certainly isn't the pizza!"
Annie K.,"Dublin, OH",7,40,30,5.0,9/3/2017,Get the pizookies!! They are so delicious but worth the money. Great place conveniently near the mall so you can go there afterwards to walk off the calories. This place can get pretty loud and noisy sometimes with TVs playing everywhere
Esha B.,"London, OH",146,3,1,4.0,9/10/2017,My first experience eating there was yesterday I had a take out order and I love the way it is set up the food was delicious  the people are nice I'm actually going there again today to try something different love it
Matt B.,"Waverly, OH",54,6,2,3.0,9/2/2017,"Ribs were good but definitely not fall off the bone, go for the creamed corn if you like ginger, the loaded baked potato was drier than the Sahara -- great service though!"
Jake L.,"Holmes Beach, FL",1,24,5,4.0,2/17/2017,"You know that feeling when you show up some place and learn that it's totally not the type of place you thought it would be? Well, color me baffled when I walked into this place. What a wonderful place, with awesome food and a great atmosphere.  And The beer blew me away."
Cassie K.,"Columbus, OH",83,8,,4.0,9/4/2017,Food is great. Best brewed cider I've ever had. Portions are good for the price. My only complaint is that the revolving door makes the restaurant VERY cold in the winter.
Arlee S.,"Columbus, OH",9,35,28,5.0,7/14/2017,This place is always amazing and good food with a great atmosphere.. Gets a little busy at times but usually goes pretty fast..
Chandra H.,"Columbus, OH",0,4,1,4.0,8/5/2017,Went in for dessert with a friend. Mmm pazookies!  Really enjoyed the churro pazookie. Got it in s trio with the peanut butter and chocolate chunk. Order came quick and everything was good!. The staff was attentive and friendly.   I always have a good experience here!
Johnson Y.,"Hilliard, OH",0,80,20,4.0,8/3/2017,"The dine-in experience is perfect.  It's a little pricey, but the food is all great, the service is great, and there are always specials and rewards discounts.  Carry out is another story.  The orders are constantly incorrect and it takes a long time to pick up your food if you go in to the carryout counter... let alone try the curbside pickup.  They take forever outside and by the time they come out your food is cold.  Managers try to make it right with gift cards and that's nice, but I'd rather them just be quicker and get everything right."
Lauren O.,"Provo, UT",60,60,3,2.0,5/16/2017,Met up with some girlfriends for dessert and apps. We do not drink and the minute our waiter found out he was hurrying us through. Appetizer (spinach artichoke dip) was very bland and the cookies were just ok. We'll head elsewhere next girls night
Joni R.,"Delaware, OH",21,2,,4.0,1/26/2017,Had dinner at BJ's last night.  Parmasion crusted chicken dinner.  Very good!  Highly suggest it. Served with mashed potatoes and brochli. Yum
Jay R.,"Aurora, IL",143,10,3,1.0,5/3/2017,"Tried to make a reservation for a casual business dinner, and was rather rudely told they don't do reservations, and only do call ahead seating 30 minutes beforehand. Meanwhile their Yelp listing says they DO take reservations. I've been here a dozen times before, but won't go back again."
Robert R.,"Newnan, GA",0,3,,5.0,10/7/2017,Great place to eat before Ohio State games! Our waitress was great and gave us great information as we were from out of town! Definitely recommend!
Amanda D.,"Columbus, OH",31,80,217,4.0,5/22/2017,Cool place. Great pizza and desserts. Lots of awesome specialty drinks to choose from. They had a few great flat bread and salad choices for lunch as well.
John R.,"Groveport, OH",4,23,10,5.0,10/15/2016,"Came in here with 6 people, four adults and two kids ages 2 and 7 months. We were seated promptly and a server was with us immediately. I got the Shrimp and Arugula tacos. They were very tasty, though I recommend substituting the grain bowl for something else. I did the House Salad and it was very good sized, and was quite good with their vinaigrette. Everyone was pleased with their orders, and service was fantastic. Huge shout out to Seth P, he was a rockstar. I have had luke warm service AND food here before, but this time was just how it should be. I would not hesitate to come back if there was a chance we would be dining in Seth's section."
D J.,"Columbus, OH",62,18,,3.0,9/24/2016,"This is my first trip back in a long time, and it's still wildly inconsistent service and food.  I usually end up going to meet others who chose this restaurant. Overall, I could never recommend anything past the bar.  Bar service is typically good, but table service is usually a long wait, and the food is all over the range of temperature. Only the pizza has ever been too hot to eat, while everything else has been sitting a while.  It tends to be on the over priced (but often double portion)  spectrum of restaurants like Chammps and Cheesecake Factory, but of these, I have never had the abandoned with bad service experience in Chammps. For BJ's, the Tuttle location is worse than Polaris...probably because there is no walkable competition for the Tuttle location.  Pizza can be good, and usually they can accommodate large parties, and the restrooms are clean.   Servers are nice, just often slow, or at worst, absent."
Brian R.,"Dover, OH",11,5,3,3.0,4/27/2017,Waitress and atmosphere was great.  Food was average.  Didn't leave me wanting to go back anytime soon.
Tara P.,"Hilliard, OH",2,15,1,5.0,2/18/2017,I got the barbacoa cauliflower pita tacos without corn or cheese. They were amazing. So good. Our waitress was named Jess and she provided perfect service. Cheerful. Knowledgeable. Attentive while not being overbearing.
Remard C.,"Dublin, OH",9,19,,4.0,10/2/2016,"Great for the entire family with a diverse menu. We go about every 2-3 months and have never had a bad experience.  Also, the custom beers and carbonated beverages are great.  One other tip, make sure you download their app so you can get on the waitlist early, earn points, and get discounts."
