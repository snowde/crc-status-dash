Tim S.,"Canton, OH",65,359,63,3.0,12/16/2013,"3.5 stars. This is a brew pub with solid food and a good selection.  They are obviously known for the beer and it's not amazing but it satisfies and it's nice to try what they have available at that time.  I have been happy with their flatbread pizzas especially.  This feels like a nice place to roll up to with a couple buddies, split a few apps, have a flight of beer or two and be on your way."
Garrick G.,"Hilliard, OH",28,2,,4.0,6/5/2012,"Good food, great beer selection. Service was okay. I've been here several times and never left disappointed."
Steve F.,"Hilliard, OH",18,100,240,4.0,11/14/2011,"Beautiful building...I had a few appetizers with friends, all were decent.  Really enjoyed the crafted pumpkin beer.  Plan to return soon for a more well rounded meal."
Scott D.,"Columbus, OH",28,9,2,3.0,11/9/2011,"Food is good but service isn't great and they do not have wifi, hello it's almost 2012 get it together. Returning to the service, My waitress was obvioulsy challanged becasue she had no clue what the specials were for the day, she had to go find out and told us it was $1 off drafts I then asked her about the food specials that I saw on the table tent menu, she replied, ""ohh those are specials I guess also"".  When our food arrived she dropped our bill automatically.  I told her we were going to eat more and have drinks and watch the NFL games so she then took the bill.  About an 30 minutes after we finished our half priced mini pizzas and had a few more beers, I ordered another mini pizza.  She put my order in and then came back within 3 minutes and handed me the bill again, I then asked are you leaving or something?  Which she said she wasnt but I felt rushed and not welcomed when we were ordering plenty of food and drinks.  I then just told her to box my food up and that we were leaving.   I pulled the manager aside and asked why she had dropped my check off twice already before we had even touched our food and recieved the 2nd portion of it.  He stated that is what they do during lunch, I told him it was Sunday people are in here to eat and watch games and it wasnt very good for bussiness in my opinion.  Also they had no wifi in the place and have no plan to have it for their customers, well BJ's is out for work lunch work meetings.  I will give  BJ's a 3 star becasue this location is fairly new, the food was good, and the beer was good also. I hope BJ's can get it together for my next trip."
Steve-o B.,"Rochester, MI",0,6,10,4.0,2/24/2015,"I really enjoyed both the atmosphere, the food, and the service at BJ's so much so that I had gone back again the next night to catch a round of drinks with my mother when we were in Columbus for my brother's wedding recently.  Unbeknownst to us, the house merlot was $10.50 per glass, which was quite the shock when I got the bill.  This is 50% more than the typical price of a glass of house wine, so I addressed my concern w/ the manager on duty, Colleen, who was very apologetic and agreed that the price of the merlot was too high, but explained that ""corporate"" sets the pricing.  She did offer to make amends for this by picking up the tab if we were to come back to dine there again later in the weekend.  We took her up on this kind offer and had a light lunch at BJ's just prior to departing Dublin, Ohio to head to the airport.  Colleen made good on her offer to pick up the tab and I greatly appreciated this gesture!  I fully intend to visit BJ's again next time I come back to Dublin!  Their new thin crust pizza was very good, but so too was everything else we'd tried!  The chicken tortilla soup was also outstanding!  BJ's has a huge selection of food from which to choose on their menu as well as a lineup of good ""house"" beers at reasonable prices!  I would definitely recommend this place to others!"
Charles O.,"Fairfax, VA",4,8,2,3.0,12/4/2011,Wide variety of draft beer.  Service was average.  Food was also average.  I had a burger that was charred more than I prefer.  I would go again for the beer and plenty of televisions for the sports especially while my wife is shopping in the mall.
Miss J.,"Canal Winchester, OH",48,54,,4.0,6/9/2013,"Food is great, but a little pricey. Love the maui pork chops with the roasted potatoes and steamed green beans. Pizookie is delicious too. Would have given more stars but the wait was awful."
Will C.,"Grosse Pointe, MI",19,5,,4.0,4/9/2013,"Great food and good beer.  Pizza was good but the food was a tad too salty which is not surprising of a ""chain style"" restaurant definitely will go back. Beer selection is killer and anybody who likes beer will see it's a great selection. Something for everyone"
Lisa k.,"Lewis Center, OH",10,19,,5.0,8/5/2012,Service good. Food good and was great seeing the manager active on the floor. KUDOS!
K B.,"Charlotte, NC",3,322,8,2.0,10/23/2012,"We went to this business on Friday, October 19, 2012.  The design is cool and inviting.  The people, service, was something totally different.  I was extremely impressed with the homemade root beer, it was a little too sweet.  I ordered the Miso Salmon, red peppers, snow peas, rice and another vegetable.  Although the salmon was moist it had no flavor to it.  No lemon pepper, or zesty lemon, or any other seasonings that would warrant paying $12.95.  I recieved a nice size piece of salmon, but the snow peas and red peppers amounted to 8 pieces at best.  If I return it will be on someone's else's tab."
K M.,"Bountiful, UT",0,21,,3.0,1/10/2013,When we arrived place looked packed and thought we would never get in but to my surprise we were seated rather quickly. Never been to this restaurant but my co workers love the place. I ordered a burger. Food and service was good.
