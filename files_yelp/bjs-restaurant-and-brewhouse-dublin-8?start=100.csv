Jenny P.,"Minster, OH",36,9,,3.0,10/10/2015,"Had a small hawaiin pizza, pulled  pork sandwich, and mozzarella sticks.  The food and drinks were good, but the reviews talking about poor service were correct.  Our server did  not talk with us, had few recommendations when asked, and did not the menu items.  The menu was extensive and there were lots of thungs that sounded good.  Our food was served in a timely manner, but it was at least 15 minutes after we were done when we finally asked for a box and a bill from a different server.   I would probably come back,  but i would not hurry back."
Brian F.,"Hilliard, OH",328,285,10,3.0,5/10/2013,"I went here last night.  I'd been to the other location once for a birthday and came away pretty happy.  Last night was no different.  We had the avocado egg rolls to start, and my friends thought they were extremely spicy.  I thought they were just fine, but I like spicy food a lot, so I may not be the best judge.  I liked them and would order them again.   I also had one of their Porters.  It was good, don't know if it was anything special, and it would have been nice if I would have been given the dollar off for happy hour, but, apparently, that's only good for the bar area.   I got the boneless wings.  They were good.  They were around $10, which seems a little pricy for what I got.  I did enjoy the taste, and they were definitely spicy enough to catch my attention.  Next time, I will probably try the spiciest wings they have though.   Overall, it's a good place to meet up with friends or grab a bite to eat."
Jean V.,"Bellville, OH",36,22,98,5.0,1/31/2016,No way to go wrong here! I had the North Shore Mahi Mahi & Shrimp and I just wish there was enough left for lunch tomr! The California flatbread is also a fav!
Teri D.,"Powell, OH",113,702,50,3.0,11/17/2012,"It's a chain, the food is the same at all of them which is basically ok, our server was very nice though and took extra pains to make sure nothing was in my salad that I was allergic to.  That was very nice.   My only complaint about this place is getting in and out of it is a bit of a chore as you have to deal with everyone coming in and out of the mall.  It can get dodgey."
Andi M.,"Galloway, OH",38,32,6,5.0,7/10/2016,"Great lunch! We were by the Tuttle Mall and decided to stop in for some lunch. So happy that we did. I had never been here for a meal, only for the Pazooki, which we didn't get today but I highly recommend! We arrived about 2 and were immediately seated. Our server,  Dante, came within 5 minutes and took our drink order.  He was back with our drinks quickly and we were ready to order food. I got the Portobello Swiss burger and my boyfriend got the Guacamole Bacon burger. We both got potato wedges. The food took a little longer than we had thought but Dante was great about refilling our drinks and letting us know that the food would be out soon. The burgers were amazing! Cooked perfectly and definitely fresh. The wedges were good as well. Dante continued to refill our drinks (I was really thirsty) and came back to check on us regularly to make sure everything was good. We have been so frustrated about the lack of good food in the area so this was a breath of fresh air. To have great food and great service nowadays seems to be rare but we had an excellent experience there today and we will definitely be back! Great job BJ's and thank you Dante!"
L C.,"Columbus, OH",5,62,6,4.0,11/17/2015,"Came in for lunch today with a group. Servers were nice and attentive. However there was a mix up with the order.  So I waited for the revised dish and I guess because they were trying to turn it around quickly they didn't cook the pasta long enough (or reheated the first batch too long) and it came out hard and just couldn't really be eaten. Kind of a bummer, but here's the thing that turned it around - without a complaint or an ask, the manager took it off the bill. Such great service that it's hard to leave unhappy! I know the beer is good and and the atmosphere is nice, so we are sure to be back now."
Will P.,"Columbus, OH",161,355,58,3.0,3/26/2013,"I like the little pizzas   This is a great happy hour and lunch place to go.  Drink specials are awesome and the personal pizzas are discounted.  Speaking of personal pizzas, they are very delicious.  Great portion size, packed with flavor.  Versatile enough to enjoy for a sporting event or date night"
Meghan R.,"Downtown, Columbus, OH",6,37,,1.0,6/26/2016,"I'm writing a couple months after my experiences b/c I've tried to give them a chance to make things better with me. This has not happened. I have two separate occasions, the last two times I was there. There was a hair in my food the first occasion. Working in the server industry I know this happens although we all think it shouldn't ever happen, well it does. Without hesitation the server apologizes and takes the food. At this point I'm assuming I won't have to pay for the meal since there is hair in my food. I was wrong. She brings me another meal and makes me pay for it.... Wow. On the second occasion, since I'm not going to let this one incident stop me from giving it another chance, I get food poisoning. After waiting for almost an hour, we eat as quickly as possible bc we are now late to work. About a half hour later I'm so sick. I call to let them know what had happened b/c I don't want anyone else getting sick. They take my payment information and contact information, as someone will contact me again. No one contacted me. And again, I assume I will not have to pay for my meal that gave me food poisoning since they asked me all the payment information. Well nothing happened. I sent an email to corporate. No one contacted me back. I will def not be going back again, at this point the chance to make things right has passed."
Shelly M.,"Alameda, CA",26,16,2,4.0,6/21/2014,"We stopped for drinks following a wedding rehearsal.  It was a Friday night and we didn't have reservations.  The place was packed!  We preferred to sit outside, but the hostess informed our party that the patio was closed for the evening due to the weather.  She asked a manager-esque character and he also denied our request.   However, after much pleading, he folded.  It was no longer raining after all!  (On a related note: The air conditioning units above the bar were trickling more condensation than mother nature.) The experience was mediocre, but it definitely could have been worse.  3.5 stars."
Mark B.,"Columbus, OH",0,12,,5.0,6/17/2016,What a wonderful dinner! Seth did an excellent job as our server with suggestions and fantastic service!
Steve B.,"Orient, OH",30,29,3,3.0,11/19/2014,"Lazy Tuesday evening dinner with some friends (7 of us in total), was super busy... Service was ok, if a little slow, food was pretty average in my opinion. This is the second time I've dined here - I don't think I'll be back... I know it's a 'sports bar' or whatever it claims to be - but hearing a conversation from across the table was virtually impossible... (especially with screaming babies at the next table!)... Overall I rate this place as average. It's a shame the food wasn't 'exceptional' as then all the rest would seem insignificant..."
Laura J.,"Royal Oak, MI",43,227,5,3.0,11/26/2012,"We stopped in for a Sunday afternoon lunch on our way through Columbus and had a fine lunch.  We chose it mostly because my husband's initials are BJ.  My husband had a hamburger topped with chili that was really good.  I had a stuffed potato that was also great.  I recommend that you skip the side salad as it was yuk bagged lettuce.  Other than the salad, it was a great lunch. I didn't enjoy our server very much.  She spent a lot of time trying to sell extra items to us and no time bringing things that didn't add to the bill.  It was like she was trying a little too hard to do all of the selling that they taught in the training class and as a result she didn't seem sincere.  She brought mustard for my husband's hamburger about half way through the meal, and only refilled my water after I was completely done eating.   Still, service aside, we'd go back if we were on a road trip and saw the sign from the freeway."
Marissa C.,"Columbus, OH",58,418,33,5.0,8/29/2012,"This was our first visit to this particular location, but we have enjoyed the chain before.  Although it looked quite crowded when we arrived around dinnertime, we were pleasantly surprised to find ourselves seated right away.  The server was attentive, and although he forgot to bring out a drink initially, was quick to fix the problem. My husband and I decided to try the two for $19.95 deal, which turned out to be a great choice.  We each got a salad, which is then followed by a medium pizza and then the signature BJ's dessert, a pizookie, to share.  I went with a House Salad and my husband with the Caesar.  Both were pretty standard, a nice way to start the meal.  For the pizza, we went with a sausage and mushroom on gluten-free thin crust.  It was delicious as always, and there was no upcharge for the toppings or gluten-free crust.  It was our first time trying the pizookie - it was amazing!!  We had the gluten-free chocolate chip, and it was soooo delicious.  It comes out warm and gooey in its own little skillet, topped with vanilla ice cream.  There are several other varieties, too, for those who can eat gluten.   The restaurant itself was very nice and clean.  There is a cute little patio outside, although it does face into the mall parking lot.  We really enjoyed our visit here and would definitely come again."
Long T.,"Dublin, OH",0,3,,5.0,8/3/2015,"Great food, great services! Just love this place with many selections. I personally like the avocado egg rolls."
Jim A.,"Hilliard, OH",8,1,,5.0,1/18/2016,Sara was very friendly and was able to offer options when my favorite menu item was no longer there.. And also offered beer to go with each option. Would definitely ask for her section again
Aaron D.,"Upper Arlington, Columbus, OH",0,5,6,1.0,1/16/2016,"Called ahead for seating an hour in advance, still had to wait over an hour to be seated. Food is mediocre at best. Go spend your money somewhere else."
Doug O.,"Columbus, OH",118,272,2,2.0,5/1/2012,"The food here is pretty good, and the beer is pretty well done, but the service was awful.  My wife and I each ordered a drink with our food and the server IDed us.  I understand, that's her job, even though we're nowhere close to 21.  But when we had out of state IDs (we're pretty new to Ohio), she freaked out, nearly wouldn't serve us, and then said she had to consult with her manager before she could serve us.  The manager came over and gave us our IDs back and served us, but was very wary of us.  He served us the rest of our meals, as our original server never returned, and he seemed completely on edge the entire time. It was a strange experience where we were made to feel bad simply because our IDs were from out of state, which was uncalled for since I'm 32, balding, and fairly weathered looking.  Which is too bad, because otherwise I think we would have enjoyed our dining experience."
Josh K.,"Mount Vernon, OH",5,131,20,3.0,4/24/2016,Overall his was a good experience. The place was very clean. The service was above average. I go a burger with no bun and they added portabella mushroom with out me asking. It was VERY good. The fries were just ok. The kids got ribs and they thought they were fantastic. Also had a wedge salad and it was average at best. The other thing we ordered was a entree salad with ahi tuna. That was very good.
Cathi H.,"Delaware, OH",2,17,,1.0,3/1/2015,sitting here on a snowy Sunday night. probably 10 tables in the place and the food is sub par...again! I ordered a side salad that literally had 4 pieces of lettuce! and an Italian pizza with no toppings!   dont get me started on the dirty glasses!   last time for us...won't be back.
Melissa G.,"Bellefontaine, OH",1,11,8,5.0,6/26/2015,"This is the best place I have ever eaten! Great drinks, food, and service! I can't wait to come here again! But for now I'll have great dreams."
