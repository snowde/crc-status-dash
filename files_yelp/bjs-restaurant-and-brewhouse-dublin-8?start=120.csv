Charlene S.,"Dublin, OH",68,3,1,5.0,10/25/2015,We have always had a GREAT experience at ANY BJ's we go to. The staff at the Tuttle Crossing store have ALWAYS been the best.
Elizabeth A.,"Reynoldsburg, OH",0,2,,5.0,11/30/2015,"Amazing food and atmosphere. I've tried the calamari rings, pizza, chicken Alfredo and sirloin steak. Everything was delicious except for the steak. It was heavily seasoned with salt & pepper. Yuck."
Jesse G.,"Henderson, NV",0,57,10,4.0,9/14/2015,I actually love this restaurant and went there twice within 4 days. Convenient location to the mall and hotels. Food and beer choices are awesome. I will say we were underwhelmed with our dinners this time. The sirloin steaks we had were not good. Mine tasted old and my brother's was very dry. All of the other food was good and the service was good.
Steph L.,"Gahanna, Columbus, OH",1,1,,2.0,10/31/2015,"Usually this is our go to for a wonderful meal from start to finish. Today however left a lot to be desired from the rude hostess, the slow service and cold appetizer the list goes on. Very disappointed."
Chris M.,"Dublin, OH",2,40,2,1.0,12/27/2014,Went for lunch. Bad service. Lettuce in salad was all brown and wilted. Soup came out cold. Won't return.
Leslie G.,"New Albany, OH",1,9,,5.0,4/3/2016,So much variety on the menu in the way of food and drinks. Just love it! I like having the app and the waitlist check in. They were even accommodating when we were having a larger party. The brussel sprouts were great.
Toni B.,"Trenton, FL",31,33,21,2.0,7/24/2015,Party of 4...all but one had excellent meal. shrimp Scampi was over-cooked. Service was horrible. Our waiter took our order and brought our check. Otherwise we were ignored. Disappointed as it was our first time dining there. Jamal apparently had one table too many and I think it was ours.
J B.,"Port Washington, WI",1,17,,5.0,9/22/2013,"While in town for an OSU game we were looking for something for dinner and stumbled on this place. Great selection of craft beers and a pretty extensive menu and the place was busy which is always a good sign. Both of us ordered from the lighter side menu one salmon and one mahi mahi. Both dishes were cooked well and more than enough for a meal. No real need to worry about not enough to eat. As far as beer, the Jeremiah Red was my favorite with the seasonal coming in a close second with Oktoberfest. One last thought- try the pikoozies for dessert you will not be disappointed, we split a regular size half chocolate chip half peanut butter, GREAT dessert! Will definitely stop again next time in town."
WrenchinAllDay ..,"Hilliard, OH",0,25,,4.0,7/5/2015,We went for lunch right at opening on a Sunday. The restaurant wasn't busy and was fast to seat us. This was our first time here I enjoyed the atmosphere of the place location is weird but not impossible to deal with. We were impressed by the menu it takes 5-6 pages just to get through the drinks and then the food section was just as many pages lots to choose from. We ordered a burger and a pizza to split and we enjoyed all the food but the burger was a little under cooked for how I ordered it but not inedible. Pizza was good and a nice change of pace getting a good deep dish in an area of the country where thin pizza is dominate. Over all we liked it and plan to return.
Halley A.,"Youngstown, NY",0,2,1,2.0,7/1/2015,"Food was good but service was not! Took 15 min get my wine and water with lemon (water was served with no lemon). Plate was dirty or something when my salad was served or salad was prepared hours before it was served. It has a very ""chain"" restaurant feel. Waitress never asked if I wanted another drink."
Cindi B.,"Hilliard, OH",1,25,3,2.0,11/21/2014,"Was there for lunch today, restaurant was busy, but bar seating was available, we waited at least 10 minutes before someone came over. It then took another 15 minutes before we even ordered. We were there for over 1 1/2 hours, glad we were not on our lunch break. The food was awesome , they need faster servers!!"
Stacey R.,"Dublin, OH",1,6,1,4.0,8/8/2015,Had dinner with a group of coworkers this is our normal spot that we choose to eat out at when we have aargh group. Service is always hit or miss. Food was good not the fastest we have ever received our food. I got the Parmesan crusted chicken and a white chocolate macadamia pizookie for dessert. I will certainly go back it's decent food for a decent price .
Eric L.,"Wesley Chapel, FL",4,6,2,4.0,10/31/2013,"I'd never heard of BJ's before, but decided to visit while in Columbus on business. The deep-dish BJ's Favorite pizza was flavorful, with a tender crust that was still robust enough to pick up - no fork needed, except for the toppings that tumbled off in their plenty. My only complaint might be in the onions' power - their strength tended to beat the other ingredients into hiding. I paired the pizza with a Jeremiah Red Irish ale, which was well-crafted, but lacked anything to really distinguish itself from any other amber or red ale. It was satisfactory, but wholly forgettable. I finished with a macadamia nut Pizookie - a deep-dish cookie with vanilla I've cream. While delicious, and the perfect finish to my meal, it really should be shared by two or more people. I learned later that the dessert was well over 1,000 calories - more than the rest of my meal combined. Service was excellent, prompt, and professional. The food was fresh and hot, with excellent flavor. I would both recommend the restaurant and return if I find myself in the area."
Nikki R.,"Dublin, OH",1,17,5,2.0,1/3/2015,"I've been here multiple times and have never been too satisfied with the quality of the food. On my last visit I had ""Deep dish lasagna"" and the description said it had Italian sausage in it. I only found one piece of sausage in it and it seemed to just be ravioli with sauce on time. On my previous visit the service was mediocre too. The only thing I like at this restaurant is the wide variety on the menu, the environment, and the dessert."
K C.,"Hilliard, OH",26,6,,5.0,4/19/2016,"Great atmosphere and great food! I have been here several times since we moved to Dublin, and it has been wonderful every time. Service is perfect. Food is so good! Try the monkey bread dessert.  It's very addicting - just like mama used to make."
Mel S.,"Dublin, OH",9,48,2,3.0,3/17/2015,"A friend of mine loves to go here for happy hour.  So I have been here quite a few times.  I wouldn't say that it is an amazing place or anything really sticks out that I would rave about.  However, the last time I went there (2/26/15) the service was great, drinks were perfect, and food was good.   It is a good place to check out if you haven't been there before.  Not sure I would go for dinner but if I do, I'll update my review."
J. P.,"Galloway, OH",0,31,7,2.0,6/27/2015,"Went here last night with some girl friends. We had salads and a flatbread pizza that were delicious. Apparently, though this is a Brewhouse, you can only have two beers, because our waiter pretended like he didn't hear me when I asked for another beer and continued to offer me water like I was drunk or something. That was really disappointing because I LOVE draft beer. I was with my friends and we were being a little loud, but I was certainly not over-served with two beers in the 3 hours we were there. I ordered a buffalo chicken pizza to go for my fiancé. We were both disappointed when I got home and the $25 pizza he was looking forward to had NO CHICKEN! Surprise! Wing sauce and celery only! Not impressed. 2 stars because the food we did have that was prepared correctly was really good. Everything else, not so much."
Colby C.,"Granville, OH",0,12,2,3.0,3/6/2015,Better than Applebee's but not by much...happy hour pizza was 6 out of 10...beer good....lighting was little bright for a pub....take the kids not the date.
Bernie D.,"St Louis, MO",53,226,,4.0,3/13/2013,"This place is a 3 star restaurant with a 5 star beer selection.  Most micro brewery restaurant will only serve their brewed beers, but BJ's has a number of other brews on tap along with their own brews.  I enjoyed their pirahna pale ale. The menu is very expansive, tons of selections.  Reminded my of the cheesecake factory menu.  So big that by the time you get to the end you've forgotten what you like at the beginning. I really enjoyed the creole talapia and a must try appetizer in the Ahi Poke.   Service was good.  Definitely a place where they are ""pushing"" everything.  As in as soon they handed me my menu ""Hey can I start you with appetizer X?""  My only complaint is that both time I ate here my appetizer came out at the same time as my entree.   The atmosphere is definitely nice, good music at a level you can still have a conversation, a clean bar, 4 big screen TVs to watch the game, and in an area filled with a million chain restaurant a place I will definitely come back to."
Marc S.,"Germering, Germany",49,188,65,4.0,2/27/2013,"Good food, place is most of the time pretty packed. Used to eat the burgers there and they are good. The beer they make is delicious. I recently discovered that I have to eat gluten, nut, egg and lactose free and guess what.... they have a gluten-free menu and they offer a gluten-free beer. Nothing else to add. Would go there anytime."
