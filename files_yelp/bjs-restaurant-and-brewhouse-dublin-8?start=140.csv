John D.,"Galloway, OH",0,7,,3.0,5/25/2015,"First time @BJ's. Nice menu with many choices. Southwest rolls were a great appetizer.  Steaks were cooked well. A little too much salt in the seasoning,  baker a little undercooked.  Tortilla soup was very good.  Prompt, not over bearing service. It's definitely a go back."
S B.,"Dublin, OH",0,32,,4.0,3/13/2016,"Due to its packed status, it's a favorite in the Dublin area.  Their menu is expansive, and the selections are outstanding.  Good energy.  The servers are highly trained to move fast and know the menu.  Every dish I order is good tasting - a bit on the pricey side but worth it.  If it weren't such a loud restaurant, we'd eat there more often.  Oh yes, my husband likes to watch football on their numerous big screen TV's."
Jeff K.,"Trotwood, OH",16,146,31,2.0,6/19/2013,I went here and got the salmon and grilled shrimp with mixed vegetables and risotto.  I ordered the blackened salmon and it was cooked to my liking.  Done but it remained moist.  The shrimp on the other hand . . . . the risotto was ok and the veggies weren't overcooked.  The menu reminds me of the Cheesecake Factory menue from the standpoint there are MANY options to from which to choose.   I hot a house-brand beer that had a good flavor.  The heferweizen.
David B.,"Cleveland, OH",56,338,26,4.0,3/7/2013,Wow... Food ROCKED!!! Beers were flowing like water and I just tipped my head back!!!! I had about a million ales and also offered a double IPA and wow....Tasted like a Dortmunder but not...More subtle and not NEARLY as dangerous!!!! Woke the next morning a bit worn but no headache and that was a bonus! So in a nut would I recomment BJ's ABSOLUTELY~!!  I LOVE BJ's!!!!!!
Kim W.,"Columbus, OH",0,5,,1.0,10/12/2015,"First two beers that we requested off the menu were not available, so started off poorly.  Ordered the California Flat bread and received a flat bread with little to no chicken, a few globs of tomato and no avocado.  When the waitress came by to check on us, I pointed to the flat bread and she said where is the avocado....yes indeed she did!! Then she asked if I wanted her to bring me slices of avocado to complete the order.  Needless to say, I declined, and asked to have it removed from the check.  Won't be returning to this location. Poor service, poor food, poor selection."
Steph L.,"Northwest, Columbus, OH",11,23,3,3.0,3/16/2013,"This restaurant looked great from the outside, and was nice on the inside.... But the food leaves a little to be desired.  Pros: great homemade root beer Cons: uncooked fries (how hard is it to finish cooking fries?)            Subpar burgers Overall wont be coming back"
Lynn D.,"Dublin, OH",9,147,1,4.0,8/22/2013,Good pub food and a terrific selection of beer.  Got here at happy hour and still managed to find a shaded place in the patio.  Looking forward to returning and trying more of the interesting menu
George H.,"Murfreesboro, TN",0,10,3,2.0,1/2/2015,"Kitchen staff struggles but food was tasty! Need to work on the plating, I sent dish back due to the look and feel that the staff placed food on a dirty dish. I was assured that what looked like the remains of old salad was in reality the garnish! Needs better oversight of kitchen staff and wait staff should monitor presentations before they are brought to the table. Good Luck!"
Russ S.,"Grove City, OH",0,8,,5.0,2/21/2016,"I have never had a bad experience at BJ's. The restaurant is clean, the staff is friendly, and the food is always good. I eat here often and I often recommend it to friends."
Ryan S.,"Worthington, Columbus, OH",12,57,40,4.0,8/31/2013,"BJs has a huge selection of food. If you haven't found a favorite and especially if you're hungry, this can lead to not being able to decide on a dish and inevitable frustration almost. Once deciding you really can't go wrong though. They have delicious food and everything from appetizers to their sandwiches, salads (crispy chicken salad rocks) and awesome pizzas are sure to please. Drink menu is also extensive with a variety of draft beers, BJs own brewed beers and great cocktail creations.  BJs can get pretty busy sometimes so if you see a long line they do have first come first serve seating in the bar area. If you're really smart, they also allow call ahead seating which can cut your wait time down once you arrive.  They have a frequent dining card that's pretty good and their email list gives nice additional benefits like free apps and free pizookies (if you don't know what those are, make sure to order one for dessert, you won't be sorry).  Ryan"
Tls K.,"Dublin, OH",32,157,8,2.0,9/8/2012,"We've been here several times.  The chicken tortilla soup is fabulous.  I strongly recommend the french dip sandwich, deep dish pizza and the black cherry cola.   On the other hand, we feel this establishment is overpriced.  I tend to dine here on my company expense account but not personally.   Be careful in the parking lot; it was poorly designed and drivers seem to speed through risking a collision with a pedestrian or another vehicle.  For safety, please back into your parking spot."
Jeff R.,"Atlanta, GA",14,32,6,5.0,9/26/2014,Went here tonight with some new friends.  Their clam chowder in the bread bowl was excellent.   I like how they made the bread bowl crunchy.  Excellent food and service.  I also like their mobile app.  We were able to use the app to put us on waiting list for seats. It was also nice to be able to pay for the food with the app.  We definitely will be going here again.  :)
Christopher V.,"Minneapolis, MN",11,14,,4.0,7/19/2014,"I visited BJ's multiple times while in town for business and enjoyed experience!  They have a diverse array of their own local brews plus a full line-up of national and regional beers. The food menu, like the beer, has so many options that you're bound to find something to your liking.  Try the Atlantic Salmon dinner or the turkey bacon sandwich for lunch.  Both are great!  Excellent service as well!"
S.E. M.,"Powell, OH",0,3,,5.0,8/9/2016,"I went to dinner with a party of 8 and had a great time.  We enjoyed drinks, shared some appetizers, and each got a different entree.  All of us enjoyed our food.  I had mahi-mahi with shrimp, one of their lowest calorie items, and it was wonderful.  The man to my left had glazed chicken, and the guy on the right had the jambalaya. After finishing, we shared ice cream & cookie desserts, and they were scrumptious.  Most of us had appetizer/dessert coupons which were quickly and efficiently handled.  Our server did an outstanding job.  Friendly and attentive.  Drinks, including refills, were quickly provided and were great.  Food came out as ordered and very timely even though there were 8 of us.  He provided separate checks as we'd requested.  Many of us were first-timers, and all said they couldn't wait to return.  By the way, I asked about gluten-free items as my wife is gluten intolerant.  The waiter brought me a copy of the separate gluten-free menu and suggested I take it home so my wife could look it over.  I will definitely be back here again!"
Charlotte C.,"Dublin, OH",116,23,5,4.0,6/21/2014,"I really enjoy the atmosphere,  the large variety of choices,  fair prices, and the amazing pizookie desserts."
Esther M.,"Toledo, OH",5,8,1,3.0,6/26/2014,"I ordered the roast beef dip sandwich, and it didn't taste as good as I had hoped. The horseradish sauce that came for dipping (kind of) redeemed the flavor. Their fries were delicious, though. I'd come back and try something else (like the black n blue burger) and see how it tasted before I make any concrete conclusions about this restaurant."
Tina G.,"Cincinnati, OH",67,157,46,5.0,5/25/2012,"Not a true soda queen anymore but since they offered unlimited refills of their handcrafted root beer, cream soda, orange and black cherry sodas, we tried all four of them!  So refreshingly clean-tasting.  Aside from that the food is good.  Avocado rolls.  Lemon Chicken Pasta and salad of a fried chicken kind seemed to have taken a back seat to the sodas!   I haven't tasted the beer yet. ...... More later!"
Steven W.,"Memphis, TN",0,2,,4.0,12/17/2015,"BJ's really understands what good quality service and great tasti g food is all about. Traveling on business is how i came across this wonderful place. The staff is always inviting and professional. The food is amazing! I had the ribeye last night, and it was cooked to perfection! I also had the tomato and mozzarella salad, and the balsamic dressing was incredible! I am determined to tey everything on the menu each time i travel back to Dublin."
Erol P.,"Dublin, OH",3,16,10,4.0,10/14/2012,"Stopped in yesterday after we visited the Casino.  I have been by it a million times as I get off the 270 exit and heard some positive reviews by friends and family.   I wasn't really hungry at all but I did have to eat something, you know what I mean?  My wife was hungry for lunch as it was around 3:30  and we had just left our first visit to the Columbus Casino BTW I won on the slots.  Anyway, wife ordered the Ma-hi Taco and a house salad, I just ordered the Calamari appetizer - not being that hungry. I also ordered a glass of wine and was ready to order another when I decided to check out their beer list.  My appetizer was very good, my wife said the taco was okay.  However I am thinking we were just skimming the surface here and not knowing what to order. Like their pizzas and many other items I can think of.  The ambiance is excellent, the service very good. The mural on the back wall of farm workers and wheat is a nice mural and reminded me of other similar murals I have seen, has a good effect.  Our waitress when asked said to try the Jambalaya, I definitely will on my next trip when I am hungry.  Her service was very good, attentive and fast. Although have to admit the place was not that busy when we were there but it doesn't matter. She was very helpful as well.  Now about that beer list - I am not much of a beer drinker at all. Every now and then, like 2 times a year I drink beer. Well I think that is about to change - I ordered a BJ Blonde OMG what a wonderful tasting ice cold beer. It was truly excellent. Here I am thinking about going over there right now for another glass or try something else. They know beer!  What a nice neighborhood establishment, I know we will be over there many more times. I am lucky I live close enough to be there in 5 minutes,"
Kate Q.,"Columbus, OH",26,77,1,2.0,1/12/2014,"Not impressed.  This place had an affinity for iceberg lettuce, too much salad dressing, and deep fried food options.  I've read that there is a gluten free menu, but one was never made available to me tonight - even after I told the server about my food allergies.  The food was mediocre at best and the service was OK, but nothing wonderful.  The only person at our table who LOVED their meal?  My two year old.  She was a happy camper with her chicken fingers and smiley face potatoes (yes - they have round fries with smiley faces on them.  Toddler heaven.).  All in all, this is a great place to take a child for typical kid food, but not a place that I would want to visit again."
