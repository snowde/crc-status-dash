Kristin J.,"Columbus, OH",3,19,12,4.0,4/14/2014,"I went there for the first time yesterday and wish I would have tried this place sooner. I tried the spinach artichoke stuffed mushrooms and LOVED them and they were only $5. My husband had the clam chowder bread bowl and said it was the best he's ever had, the bread had so much flavor like garlic bread. The kids meals were a good size and $5.50 each including their drinks so not too bad. The only disappointing thing was the deep dish pizza that was not at all what we expected. It's ""California style"" according to the waitress which means they don't put sauce on it just a few and I mean very few tomatoes sprinkled on and the pizza tasted identical to Pizza Hut except for the tomatoes. I asked for a cup of marinara and poured it in top then it was better but I'd never order that again!! My husband also tried their house made root beer and said it was great. Overall a good experience and our waitress was really nice."
Lindsay J.,"Hilliard, OH",0,7,,4.0,11/18/2015,For a chain - I give this place two thumbs up. It's best to go and share a bunch of appetizers & pizza while drinking their brews. Can get very crowded on weekends but fairly decent during the week. The avocado egg rolls are so delicious - even people like my boyfriend that hate avocados will enjoy these tasty little treats!
Tim A.,"Columbus, OH",0,29,2,4.0,8/6/2014,"Great restaurant, HUGE menu.  Would've earned a 5 star rating, but my sirloin was a little tough and our bill was provided before desert arrived.  Overall, I highly recommend giving it a try!"
Karen W.,"Columbus, OH",51,419,148,4.0,1/9/2014,"Stopped in here on New Years Eve for lunch with some friends from church. Didn't know what to expect, but the service here was phenomenal. I believe our waitress was Kim. Anyways, we had some appetizers and we all ordered our own meal. The food was prompt and very delicious. We will definitely be back again soon!"
Brandon Heights Yelper S.,"Columbus, OH",30,49,18,4.0,2/27/2014,Nice chain brewery / restaurant that does it all with a book length menu. Quality is pretty good.
Mai T.,"Hilliard, OH",0,1,,5.0,11/2/2015,Rainy day outside but we had a wonderful dining experience inside!   From salads to main dishes... Everything so tasty!!!!
Mika T.,"Columbus, OH",91,37,,4.0,11/11/2013,"I love the atmosphere of this place.  It is always busy and bustling with business professionals and classy people of all ages.  First off, I must say that they have an impressively huge menu.  They have everything from pizza, pasta, and steak to seafood and light entrees plus much more.  Flavors also range including American, Asian, Southern and Creole. I am able to come here with my picky boyfriend who will only eat pizza and bar style food, find something for him to eat and also find myself a nice gourmet meal.   The Hawaiian Mahi Mahi is absolutely delicious for being on the low calorie menu. It doesn't lack in flavor like most light dishes.  I also have to mention the balsamic glazed chicken.  A-m-a-zing!!! The glaze is spot on and not too strong.  The whole plate has a great balance of flavor and I usually always end up getting it even after spending a long time perusing through the large menu.     The reason for my 4 out of 5 stars is because they frequently mess up the dishes.  I'm assuming it's because they are always busy, which I can understand, but when there is a mistake they need to compensate for it somehow.  One night I went there with my boyfriend, waited a long time for the food, got the food only the realize my chicken was badly burned on the underside, sent it back, waited a long time to get another one, and ended up eating it after my boyfriend was done eating.  After all of that I was only slightly irritated because the food did taste good the 2nd time around but when the waiter never gave us any sort of reimbursement for the looooong time we waited and I became VERY irritated.  I hate it when managers are too stingy to discount/comp a meal when it's warranted.  Do they really not want to lose a few dollars in order to ensure future business with a customer?  Not a smart business practice!  This wasn't the only time either that they messed up the order and didn't compensate for it.   Anyway, aside from occasional mess ups, I will continue to come here because the food is indeed DELISH!"
Sally S.,"Upper Arlington, Columbus, OH",0,17,2,3.0,8/16/2014,"Disappointing Cobb - Ordered takeout and assumed the Cobb would have grilled chicken. Instead it was topped with unsavory deli-cubed turkey (I think). So awful! My son's burger and fries were top-notch, hence the 3 stars."
Febre Z.,"Columbus, OH",6,45,12,4.0,10/1/2011,"A 10 minute wait becomes 30, a 30 minute wait turns into 1 hour. The wait to eat at BJ's is only a testament to Tuttle area's desperate need for new and better dining experiences. If anything, the receptionist just needs to be better at estimating or more honest about how long the wait is going to be. The ""squeaky wheel"" seems to get the oil... DON'T BE A SQUEAKY WHEEL! Call ahead. BJ's is known for their pizza, which is an awesome treat especially when they're nice enough to offer samples of it while guests waited to be seated. The layout of the place is also pretty smart. Come in, get your seating transponder, and head right to the big open bar for their draft selections.  Of course it's within your right to load up on more pizza once you get seated, but the rest of their menu is definitely worth exploring.  Call ahead. 'Typical with places like Cheesecake Factory, Champs or Spaghetti Warehouse, the entrees come in portions for 2, but not to worry. A recommended course: - order a handcrafted beer - grab one, or two (if splitting) of the SMALLER appetizers - eat HALF of your entree (awesome dishes like the New Orleans Jambalaya or the Parmesan Crusted Chicken) - box the rest - then finish with a Red Velvet Pizookie for dessert If you're lucky, you will leave with pain from fullness and joy from tastiness. Oh and.....call ahead."
Chris B.,"Dublin, OH",0,17,,3.0,8/9/2014,"Cheap lunch, huge menu, iffy service.  If you go during lunch hours during the week you can get decent service but going for dinner or any other time of the week forget about it. Lots of the wait staff seem very young or inexperienced. More importantly there seems to be a disconnect between management and table waiting. It took my friends group 15 mins to get drinks and 45 mins to get appetizers for dinner. On a positive note, did I mention the menu?  Beer selection is fairly decent as well."
Shoesoffnrun R.,"New Hyde Park, NY",27,191,48,4.0,12/31/2013,"I was away on business in Ohio and stopped here for a quick bite. It has the family friendly ambiance of a basic chain, but the food is much better."
Steve D.,"Columbus, OH",39,12,1,3.0,10/7/2011,"From beginning to end: Act I - The Waiting Game 7:00 PM - check in on a busy Friday night and we are told that it will take 30-40 minutes to seat two. 7:45 PM - check with front to see how much longer it will be to seat us.  We are told that there are seven (no, wait...four! - this is how the conversation really went) parties ahead of us and it would be another 20 minutes - 1/2 hour.   7:53 - Have a brief discussion with the better half as to whether we should take off to Macaroni Grill.  Just as we decide to turn in the buzzer, it goes off and we are seated promptly at 8. Lesson here:  Hostess - be HONEST!  If it's going to be an hour, tell me it's going to be an hour!  If there are seven parties ahead of me, do not change stories midstream and tell me it will be four!   Act II - Table Service and Food  - The waiter took a little longer than usual getting us our water.  -  BJ's prides itself on its rainbow (IPA - Dark Stout) of handcrafted beers, but 4.95 for a pint is a touch steep.  That is about the price you would pay for something from CBC at their restaurants (CBC or Milestone 229) and those are fresh from the brewery.  The beer was fine for what it was, though. - The food is entirely satisfactory.  It is filling, it tastes good, the portions are huge.  I especially liked the menu entry for ""tiny"" appetizers, because it meant that the wife and I did not have to ""settle"" on one giant appetizer to share and could get two smaller ones:  ones we actually wanted. - Observation:  I know this is a new restaurant, but the waitstaff looks like they are absolutely on the edge of panic the entire time.  Second observation:  the menu is HUGE, and features a veritable globetrotting feast:  Mexican, Italian, French, American, etc.  I prefer restaurants that pick a niche and do things well. Act III - Denouement BJ's is on par with Cheesecake Factory (especially because of the 20-page menus at each).  You will get good food there, it will cost you about 15 bucks a person, you will be full, and you will likely take leftovers.  There is nothing there I would go out of my way to eat, but if someone suggested it, I would go again - PROVIDED that the host / hostesses and the rest of the front of house learned what they were doing.  I watched people leave mid-wait, which usually does not happen if you honestly inform people and customers can modify their expectations accordingly."
Michael S.,"Mentor, OH",3,42,3,3.0,6/23/2014,"Had dinner here last night and while the atmosphere was pretty ok, the food was so/so.  The waitress, who was real great I might add, gushed over the deep dish pizzas.  So, since the menu is Cheesecake Factory size, I decided to give the Five Meat pizza a try.  Lots of meat on top, decent crust, but otherwise flavorless - needed way more sauce and cheese.  So, if u order one - ask for extra sauce!!  The beers are pretty good, not too many of the nasty overpowering IPAs.....  Would give it a try again."
Stephanie P.,"Dublin, OH",53,284,35,3.0,6/16/2012,"Full disclosure: I was only here for drinks after a movie. I'll be back for a try at the food another time.  We stopped in at after 11 on a Friday night for a drink or two after a movie so we could continue the discussion/argument about said movie.  The place was pretty empty, there were a couple groups in the bar area and some people on the nice looking patio. We sat at the decent sized bar, which got immediate points because they have hooks under the bar were I could hang my purse (why don't more bars do this?). The bartender was quick and good, although she did try and steer us towards the lighter beers. I had their stout which was pretty tasty, smooth with a good coffee flavor. My friend had the blonde which he enjoyed. I tried the Irish red later and it was a nice, well-made beer... would be nice to have on the patio.  Overall, it was nice. The service was good and it felt pretty comfortable. I'll definitely pop back in for dinner and see how the food it."
Nijole T.,"Los Angeles, CA",3080,6372,5149,4.0,1/27/2012,"We went right when they opened and for a chain it is really very nice here! The service is good and the food above your average standard chain restaurant fare! Exstensive menu that made it so hard for to chose, I would recommend going with a bunch of friends so you can sample as much as possible. Not being as fortunate, I did the usual and talked my husband and son into ordering as much as possible and the vegatarian options were left up to me. We started with the best beginnings combo featurung Spinach & Artichoke Dip, Mozzarella Sticks, Avocado Egg Rolls and Santa Fe Spring Rolls The men enjoyed the cheese sticks while the rest was all upto me and I did not mind one bit, all was delicious and really a huge platter, this is one combo really worth the money! I also had the potstickers which were great as well. My husband had the gourmet mac n cheese which was very very good, rich and gooey just like it is supposed to be! With that he had the Piranha Pale Ale Chili Cheeseburger, it was really like they stated a true knife and fork sandwhich, while it was good, it was a bit messy and soggy for him. I had the whole wheat pizza with Flame grilled Portobello mushrooms, balsamic vinaigrette marinated oven roasted mushrooms, caramelized onions, fresh thyme, parsley, Fontina cheese and a drizzle of balsamic glaze which makes me want it all over again just reading this, it was so damn good and right up my alley! Along with that I had the seared Ahi salad with their amazing sesame dressing.  Needless to say we were pretty stuffed the rest of the evening but it was well worth it! One of the top dining choices at Tuttle, great for the family, there really is something for every tastebud!"
Alex G.,"Knoxville, TN",8,21,1301,4.0,2/24/2013,"Good food.  Nice atmosphere.  The Spring Rolls appetizer - nice start.  Deep dish pizza very good.  Chicken Bacon Ranch pizza - nice.  Peanut Butter Pizookie, a hot half-baked cookie topped w/ ice cream, completed the meal.  Only challenge is if you're on a budget.  Our meal w/ individual pizzas, spring rolls & shared dessert = $44 w/o tips & drinks. But wonderful for a date or special occasion."
Jeffrey S.,"Dublin, OH",18,89,36,3.0,7/22/2013,"Beer selection and appetizer selection are very good. Better than most places.  From there it goes down hill a bit. I sampled each plate at the table and my selection seemed to be the best but everything was average.  At the table we had Risotto, Seared Ahi Tuna and I had the Chicken Parmesan. Nothing was bad but nothing was great. The server was good but not great. Just an average experience in taste and service.  The bill was a little above average in price."
Angie K.,"Columbus, OH",75,232,136,3.0,9/13/2013,"Pretty impressed that they have a 575 calorie and under menu. I got the chicken salad with peppers and jicama and it was very good. Everytime I come to a BJ's brewhouse there is a wait, this one wasn't as bad at the Polaris Location. Our Wait was only about 5 minutes."
Mike C.,"Hilliard, OH",54,250,45,4.0,1/9/2012,"I really really like BJ's Brewhouse. I would come here more often, however it gets a bit pricey especially coming as a family. They have an absolutely enormous menu, it always takes me several minutes to figure out what I am in the mood for. Everything I have had here has been good, especially the burgers. The beers are pretty good as well. They have a couple solid year round offerings such as the Jeremiah Red and Tatonka Stout (served on nitro, yum!). The seasonal beers really shine though. I have thoroughly enjoyed the Grand Cru as well as the IPA. They offer most of their beers to go in ""growlers"" which are half gallon jugs. The service is always fast and friendly and the building is a nice, open atmosphere. I like the upscale warehouse theme, which seems like it would clash but doesn't. It is a little tricky to get here due to the mall traffic, and you have to immediately change lanes and turn in order to get there from 270. Overall, for a chain restaurant, I highly recommend BJ's."
Gary A.,"Westerville, OH",50,14,5,4.0,10/15/2013,I visited BJ's for the first time two weeks ago and have been back two more times since. An amazing array of brews and a wide menu. I've found the quality and value to be very good and plan to return.
