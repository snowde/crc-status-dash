Traci P.,"Hilliard, OH",0,10,,5.0,6/20/2015,"First visit: food was hot and fresh and service spot-on, however, this was during slow work week pre lunch time. Second visit: parking lot was packed, busy Friday dinner time. We were seated within 15 minutes, service, and food were outstanding! Will definitely return!"
J K.,"Dublin, OH",0,3,,4.0,6/3/2015,"Called the phone ahead seating and when we arrived early found an open table in the bar.  The wait staff was friendly even though she was extremely busy.  The lighter fare menu has some very flavorful dishes that are satisfying.  Of course that left room for a pizooki....  I know.  But it was delicious,"
Laura C.,"Columbus, OH",116,248,2,3.0,11/3/2011,"Came here w/ my parents as they had received a gift card. We sat on the patio as it was an Indian Summer evening. While it was nice to have a patio option, you are pretty much sitting in a mall parking lot which is bizarre. They could add some planters around the patio area w/ trees/bushes/flowers to help give a better aesthetic and not be starring at a JCPenny sign and massive asphalt parking lot. Some LED lights around the fencing would be neat too. I noticed they had heaters out there, so presumably you can also go out on the patio in the fall? Foodwise, have everything you could want for sit down bar food. Portions are GIGANTIC (I had a pasta dish - I think it was cajun chicken something or other). Had leftovers that lasted me for 2 additional meals. I'm a fan of leftovers, so definitely get your money's worth. If you don't feel like having leftovers, highly suggest you split your meal when it comes to the pastas. My mom said the place overall reminded her of Champps, in a good way. Beer was yummy too. Service was good - knowledgeable, eager, friendly staff. Was a little hectic as they were pretty busy and had only been open less than 2 weeks. I've been back w/ a friend and we had vodka drinks at the bar on a Monday night. Fantastic sized drinks and typical prices. I thought their bar display was pretty nifty. Lots of bros w/ their bros watching Monday night football on what seems to be good TVs. So might be fun for checking out dudes w/ your lady friends but the dudes just might be too into football to really care!"
Ron D.,"Galloway, OH",4,37,6,2.0,3/21/2013,I stopped in yesterday afternoon for lunch. I went to sit at the bar and actually passed right by the bartender who was talking to another employee. The bartender kept talking to the employee and didn't even acknowledge me as I walked by. Five minutes later he came over to me. I ordered the Avocado egg rolls and was disappointed. The spicy sauce was good but the egg rolls were very bland. I think Avocados should be cool and fresh not warm and mushy It took the good Avocado flavor away. I had a house red beer and It was flavor-less as well. Nice place but I dont need to go back anytime soon. Other workers there were at the end of the bar talking about a St Patricks day party and using very foul language. Ill pass.
Michael D.,"Columbus, OH",72,42,9,4.0,10/28/2011,"Love this place!  The food has always been very good, and the portions are great.  I always have leftovers to take to work for lunch!  I have avoided going during the busy times and always have great service.   The pizookie is very good, but it is actually a copy of a dessert that I had previously at ESPN's restaurants.  The ESPN version is better (and bigger).   If I am at Polaris, this is one of the few places I would go to."
Mike N.,"Dublin, OH",2,14,,1.0,6/1/2014,"We went in for Happy-Hour it seemed that ALL the bar and wait staff were at a ""Customer Service Meeting !!!!!    Over priced drinks---- Bad service------Sub-Par food. We will not be returning."
Gil C.,"Wilmington, DE",1,9,,4.0,9/16/2013,"They have a pretty good/wide selection of food and beer. Their booth seats are very comfortable. Also, they have many TV's inside, so it is a good place to eat and watch a sporting event."
Tony C.,"Grove City, OH",2,31,8,4.0,7/6/2013,"Everything has really good flavor. Server wasn't great. Tortilla soup was best I have had, chicken noodle was excellent, flat bread pizza was great!"
H K.,"Columbus, OH",0,36,,3.0,5/8/2013,"I prefer local, but i have to admit, BJ's is pretty darn good.  A great variety of food to satisfy any palate.  I like the grilled Mahi fish tacos.  Beer is good.   Service is spotty - sometimes great, sometimes not.  Consistent quality in the food is to be appreciated."
Wayne B.,"Dublin, OH",28,21,,5.0,7/13/2012,"Food and service are great.  They also have terrific beer.  On one visit, service was a bit spotty and I just mentioned to the manager.  He insisted on comping me the entire meal for 4 people.  I said that was not necessary, I just wanted him to know because I really liked the restaurant and wanted them to know.  He absolutely insisted and apologized for a less than perfect experience.  This is the type of service that makes you come back."
Tipper T.,"Marysville, OH",1414,236,648,5.0,11/14/2011,Great food / atmosphere .... Big Menu ..... Great Handcrafted Beers ..... And finally another place to dine at Tuttle ! 5 Meows !
Patty B.,"Dublin, OH",8,35,1,4.0,8/10/2012,"I have eaten there 3 times and ordered from them via Cafe Courier delivery. i have tried several different menu items. all have been very good in terms of both quality and quantity. Good ""stick-to-your-ribs"" type of food. The service is equally attentive and efficient regardless of whether I am with others or solo dining, a factor that I always make an extra effort to note. I'm not much of a beer-drinker but I have enjoyed the beers I had there. It's close to home and prices are reasonable so I will definitely be back."
Troy S.,"Dublin, OH",0,5,,4.0,5/5/2014,"I came in excited to try the pulled pork. The BBQ sauce was of the smokey variety, but still tasted great. Definitely made up for it with the fries. They were very thin shoe strings but not overcooked or over seasoned. Pretty good beer selection which made it nice for me. As someone who doesn't really like beer, they had a 5 oz taster option so I could find one that I liked. The menu is huge. Can't wait to come back and try the pizza. The pictures in the menu looked amazing. Staff was very nice"
Angela N.,"Chicago, IL",63,46,17,4.0,12/16/2012,Been here twice in past week and great as usual. Sometimes menu is overwhelming so I just make the waitstaff suggest good stuff. Love the nutty brunette! My fav brew!
Jeremy H.,"Fuquay Varina, NC",98,322,174,1.0,3/3/2012,"Let's just start this off by pointing out the obvious.  This place wants to be a cheaper Cheesecake Factory.  Fact:  The food and service is nothing like the Cheesecake Factory.   My wife likes to eat here as they offer some Gluten Free options including a gluten free pizza.  Gluten free restaurants are few and far between so those few that offer a menu for the Celiac crowd get business even if the food and service is awful. My biggest beef with this place...parties of 5.  That's right, does your party include 5 people?  If so you are fucked!  They have 2-3 tables specifically for parties of 5.  So if you get there and tell the hostest you have a party of 5, you will see parties of 4, 6, and 8 come in, give there name to the hostest 20 minutes after you, and get seated 20 minutes before you.  Absolutelyfreakingridiculous!  I complained to the manger immediately as I'm not your typical hipster girl yelper who sees Yelp as a place to get revenge after the fact.  If I have a problem with a place, I let them know, to their faces, immediately.  Just think of how the quality of Yelp reviews would increase if you had to speak with the manager about your experience before reviewing?  Anyways, the manager said he'd see what he could do...which was nothing.  No putting a chair on a table for 4, no giving us a table for 6.  We will never go here again because of this. Also the food just isn't good, nor is the micro-brew beer and I've tried most of them.  Pretty poor excuse for beer.  I know for a fact the last three times we have came here, our food wasn't prepared right, or it just didn't taste well.  You're far better off going to the Cheesecake Factory, it will cost you a few more bucks, but it's going to be on another level."
Chuck G.,"Cable, OH",0,6,,4.0,9/6/2013,Great service - each had the roost beef dip sandwich and fries very good will definitely return.  Pizza and homemade root beer next with cookie and Ice cream dessert
Ryan S.,"South Haven, MI",0,17,,4.0,3/29/2013,"BJ's is good.  I love the large beer selection and their own brews.  I've always had really good meals here, too.  The Jambalaya was very good and the Fish Tacos were delicious as well.  I'll definitely continue to go here.  Only problem is that there is frequently a line."
Heather B.,"Key West, FL",37,2,9,4.0,10/21/2011,"I was very impressed by the building and the decor.  It's amazing how much $$$ went into this restaurant.  Anyway, we were lucky and found some seats at the bar to watch a little football, have a beer or 3, and some dinner.  It was great!  The food, the beer, the TVs.  The only complaint is that the bartender didn't really know about the beers and she wasn't overly friendly.  She wasn't rude, just reserved, concentrating maybe.  Anyway, I will definitely make this a place to visit often."
T S.,"Columbus, OH",0,4,,3.0,3/15/2013,"Your typical Max and Ermas, Ruby Tuesdays, Fridays type food. Not bad, not great. We had the mini meatballs for an appetizer, not bad. I Had the California burger, way  over cooked. The Daughter had the Blondie fish and chips. Not bad, not great. Might go back if someone else is treating but that's the only way."
Drew S.,"Hilliard, OH",0,6,,5.0,7/5/2014,Great food. The Red beer was delicious. Try the stuffed mushrooms and the bacon corn fritters. The mahi tacos were also very good.
