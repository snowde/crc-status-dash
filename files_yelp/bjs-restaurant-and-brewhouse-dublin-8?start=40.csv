Katie K.,"Columbus, OH",0,27,3,3.0,3/22/2017,"NOT SUITABLE FOR GROUPS GREATER THAN 6. (Which is very strange since the restaurant is large and could easily accommodate large groups.) We attempted to make a lunch reservation, however they do not take them. We then put our group on the waiting list, via their website. We were not notified until after we arrived that they do not take waitlist groups larger than 6. I'm not sure I understand why this information was not communicated prior to our arrival, (especially since I gave my name, phone number and email address). The place was empty since we arrived early, yet it still took them 15 minutes to squeeze us into an eight person table. (Keep in mind their were extra tables around that they could have fit us in more comfortably.) Other than that, the food was good and hot. Our waitress did a great job with our group. Had it not been for the poor hostessing and seating, I would give this restaurant a higher rating. No manager came to check on us or our meals."
Mike L.,"Casselberry, FL",0,5,,1.0,5/11/2017,Matt the manger didn't handle any situation that we had. 8 guests walk one of them had a birthday. His girlfriend her steak came out not the way it is suppose to get cooked. The second round came just the steak no sides. My food had a piece of hair in it. I did not get competed for it I had to pay for my meal. Even although I did not eat my meal. Matt the manger came out drilled my friend girlfriend on how we should have handled the situation. It was all unpleasant... Thank you for the unpleasant unproductive unprofessional services.
Rebecca L.,"Dublin, OH",67,61,16,2.0,7/13/2016,"I give this place two stars because a. i love their beer and have never had a bad experience at the bar. Also, as a whole i enjoy the Polaris location a lot.  However,  I work right down tuttle and frequently order from here. I will continue to do so now and then because its convenient and they offer a reward system which i like. They mess up my online to go order, without fail, every time. I usually order the lunch specials--ones that come with a side salad, etc--every time i have to say ""uhh hey where is___"" to which every time the person goes ""well did you want_____?"" um yes...its a flatbread and salad combo i obv want the salad.The manager isn't very friendly by any means. There is no consistency with quality when it comes to ""to go orders"". Its always just slopped into a to go container and tossed around and then given to me. They always forget chips with the office orders of fish tacos, or give a whole 3 chips. Sometimes the tacos will be full and sometimes there's barely anything in them. When eating in i have gotten fries instead of chips with the fish tacos, but when i placed the online order and just asked for cole slaw instead of chips the manager told me that chips aren't considered a side and charged me 3.50 for a side of coleslaw which i just paid because i didn't want to make a fuss.  I got a burger once and the onion straws were so stringy i couldn't chew them down to swallow--not sure what the deal is there. I lost my appetite and only had fries that day for lunch. Basically i've ordered everything off the menu and im disappointed 98% of the time with the quality of the food AND staff. Yesterday i got the BOGO and finally had my ""im done"" moment. i got the chicken pita tacos and the bottom of the to go box was full of so much grease that the pita was absolutely dripping. i couldn't even pick them up. The second entree i saved for dinner that night--the chicken was under cooked and pink in the middle. The brussel sprouts were to bitter and under cooked i had to spit them out.  Like i said, i really like BJs as a restauraunt but you do not want this location. I plan on visiting for soup and salad only from here on out if i need a quick work lunch pick me up"
Barb C.,"Columbus, OH",39,39,28,4.0,2/24/2017,Other than  being way too loud to carry on a conversation.  I love this place.  Food is fun and tasty!
Romina M.,"Columbus, OH",0,20,46,3.0,10/15/2016,"American food restaurant. Some beers made by this corporation and you can choose imported beer too. I asked chicken and the taste was good, the rice was a little bit dry. The place is next to the mall and have good parking spaces. They have a Pokémon Go Gym so your kids can play. Summary: if you want a regular meal on weekend, this is the place."
T P.,"OH, OH",12,52,13,1.0,2/20/2017,Overwhelming menu. Extremely slow service. Plan to be here for at least 3 hours - food just doesn't come out fast and servers never come around. Not sure why this place is so busy all the time - there is nothing special about this place. And the Pizooki? Nothing special - just a tiny little warm cake with vanilla ice cream on top. I guess people fall for the cute name.
Audrey E.,"Columbus, OH",8,51,4,4.0,1/12/2017,"You can't go wrong with BJ's, the variety and quality is unmatched. I'm a fan of their red ale and I've had everything from tacos to the Ahi tuna salad to the pazookies and appetizers. The service is great and they allow call ahead for parties of certain sizes. I try to have every girls night here!"
Mirabelle L.,"Columbus, OH",134,247,1370,3.0,7/23/2015,"Had an okay experience. New Orleans jambalaya was decent, yet the service was extremely slow...it took a really long time for us to get food..."
Chris R.,"Galloway, OH",6,5,1,1.0,1/9/2017,"The food was overcooked, cold and very slow service...because they were too busy watching the game on TV. Out of 8 meals in our party, only 2 were good enough/correct enough to eat.  Worst part was management couldn't care less. Out of the hundreds of restaurants in Columbus, we will take our money elsewhere to restaurants who value customers."
Beth A.,"Temecula, CA",17,97,264,3.0,7/8/2015,"I have eaten at the BJ's at Polaris and wasn't terribly impressed but that was years ago so back in town with 5 others to feed we decided to give this location a shot.  Receptionist was great our waiter not so much, very slow service, made a few requests with our food order and none of them happened. The Calamari was awful and the majority was the multiple tentacles and they were over cooked, dessert was asked without chocolate ice cream and it came with chocolate ice cream. We closed the restaurant so no time for do overs... Food was decent service not impressed"
P S.,"Columbus, OH",0,48,9,4.0,11/6/2016,"This place is pretty busy especially on weekends, but we went there on a Sunday. the wait was a little long, even the food took longer to come but the food was good! We got a deep dish pizza, burger and mushroom appetizer. All the food was good! definitely coming back!"
David D.,"Dublin, OH",1,36,1,2.0,4/27/2016,"....boy this menu is big... That is not a good thing. They do everything a little sub par. I have gone here enough to know that you should just order a sandwich or burger. Many times the food is poorly seasoned and bland. The deep dish pizza lacks sauce and cheese that usually drenches a deep dish pizza. If you like beer, they do have a wide range. I can always find one that I like. I have only gone back because friends invited me and I value them over a sub par overpriced meal.  Servers are usually great though!"
Amy R.,"Columbus, OH",0,34,,4.0,11/24/2016,"Classic BJ's! We like taking the kids and having a casual meal. The waiters are really good at this location. We come for the pizza and are never disappointed. Few people can really make a good deep dish pizza, but BJ's can."
Jim N.,"Hilton Head Island, SC",0,4,1,2.0,4/24/2017,Do not get cauliflower tacos. Ground into fine dice and is the equivalent of 2-3 florets. Can't even taste  it.
Dave S.,"Dublin, OH",72,100,547,4.0,11/16/2013,The food was wonderful! Portions were plentiful.  The quality was great I got mahi and scallops and mahi was fishy but it's suppose to be now the scallops were amazing not tough or rubbery like most places or over cooked! Service was Good they didn't mess Anything up but I will be returning thanks
Cristin S.,"Columbus, OH",219,161,572,1.0,11/4/2015,I was very upset my last trip at BJS. We came during lunch... We were promptly sat. And no one came to our table for 20 minutes. Since we were on lunch break we had to get up and leave and go to Wendy's to make it back in time. My sister was so disappointed because she really wanted to try the pazooki. I know lunch time can be busy but we watched 3 different servers walk by without saying a word. And then there were two at the computer just standing there. As we walked out the hostess asked if anything was ok and she seemed shocked no one had even visited us.
Marshall A.,"Columbus, OH",1,25,1,5.0,8/31/2016,"Excellent food every visit so far! Huge menu, lots of choices. Fantastic beer selection. Definitely one of my favorite ""go out to eat"" places."
Wendy S.,"Dublin, OH",13,54,16,3.0,2/28/2016,"It's hit or miss here... I've had food that was downright terrible, and then sometimes it's great. Service is inconsistent too... Kind of annoying, since the menu is great. Drive a few extra miles and get the one on Polaris instead."
Heath D.,"Columbus, OH",97,172,130,2.0,12/13/2015,"Why do I keep doing this to myself. It's like I forget how unbearable the service is...every time. Tonight was another example. Took forever for the server to come to us the first time. Food was slow in coming out. Fries were barely warm and rubbery. Finally tracked down a passing server to get that taken care of as our food was dropped off and our server had not stopped back to even ask how it was. About 15 minutes later he did ask how we and a table across from us was....they had been waiting for nearly ten minutes for refills. Ugh. The brisket burger I had was slightly burnt, but to be honest, it was still crazy good. Would've been great with some hot, crispy fries, but such was not in my future. I won't be back. Love the food usually, and love the craft beers. But I can't pay these prices for this bad of service."
K C.,"Grove City, OH",0,37,,5.0,10/26/2016,Omgosh this place has the best dessert EVER!  They are called pizookies!!  They are ooie gooie cookies with ice cream over top and omgosh are they fantastic!!  Heaven in your mouth!!! Their pizzas are also great!!  We love the BBQ chicken pizza the best.  The homemade sodas are also fantastic!

Anyways we are highly impressed with this restaurant and will definitely be coming back!!
