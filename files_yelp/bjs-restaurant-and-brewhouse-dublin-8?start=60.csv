Susan C.,"Hilliard, OH",2,8,15,3.0,7/3/2016,"Great food but the service, not so much...  And God forbid you call the place because there is no guarantee that whoever answers the phone can even hold a conversation let alone sound professional and answer questions."
Kimberly M.,"Baltimore, MD",1,15,2,4.0,2/17/2017,"The staff are very friendly and efficient. The beer is very good as well. Love the food, haven't had a bad meal. The menu is extensive and they have many types of food!"
Van B.,"Hilliard, OH",6,3,,2.0,4/5/2017,"Food was good, waitress was very good, but front desk staff leave a lot to be desired.  Half empty restaurant, and they want to seat us by the restrooms or the kitchen.  This is not a restaurant where it is an ""honor"" to sit in the kitchen at the chef's table.  Seat customers there when place is busy, otherwise, it's insulting.  So is the indifference and attitude when you request a different table.  If there is a place that exhibited more of ""it's an effort to say hello and to seat you"", I haven't experienced it in a while.  Columbus has too many good restaurants to put up with that type of attitude.  Be a long time before returning.  Kat B."
Jessica R.,"Columbus, OH",84,92,84,4.0,1/2/2015,"Everyone is bound to find something they like on their menu. It's huge! And so is their drink list. Awesome selection of beers, along with their own selection made by them. The food is always on point. Not a bad chain to try!  Try their avocado egg rolls. You will not be disappointed."
Aaron C.,"Lancaster, OH",27,105,2,2.0,5/12/2016,"Out of all the pizzas I have had in this town this place ranks near if not the bottom of the list.  I ordered the gourmet 5 five meat deep dish pizza to go.  When I went to pick it up the people were nice a little slow but nice.  Once I arrived home I opened the box up to what did not appear to be a deep dish pizza.  I would compare it to the thin crust pizza donatos has.  The meat was ok, the sauce was not great and for a pizza that is suppose to have multiple different cheeses the cheese was lacking greatlyl.  It's bad enough there are not many good restaurants in this area, sad I have to add another one to the list."
Kevin B.,"Daytona Beach Shores, FL",46,97,33,4.0,7/13/2016,"After getting sick for some odd reason and writing my review. I received support from the company. I have not yet returned to this location but because of the thoughtfulness of the company, I updated my review. They do have a good company."
Mandi S.,"Columbus, OH",68,201,20,3.0,7/31/2015,BJ's is similar to Cheesecake Factory - a lot to choose from and it's all good.  Don't go if you are indecisive.....like me. :)  The food selection is bountiful and the beer selection is great.
Cammy B.,"Columbus, OH",52,1,,1.0,3/31/2016,"CHECK YOUR FOOD BEFORE YOU EAT IT HERE!!! Came for a Mom n baby dinner with a girlfriend and her son tonight. We got our appetizer and drinks just fine, and ordered our food. She got a bacon cheese burger with wedges, her son got corn dogs, my daughter mac n cheese, and i got the bacon guacamole burger. It took a little bit, but it came out hot. I've never had that burger before, and still haven't because there was a foreign object in my burger.  I saw a jalapeño hanging off the side of the bottom bun. Not a huge fan, so I took them off.    Putting my buger back together, a spot of white caught my eye. You know those packets that say do not eat that you find in new bags, shoe boxes, hats, etc? There was one in my food. Alright.. No need to freak. I didn't take a bite yet, and it's my food not my child's, so, ok. I waited tables for 10 years and majored in Hospitality Management at OSU. Weird stuff happens. Flipping out isn't gonna help things go smoother. Waived over our server (after a few tries, being over looked by the manager I'd soon speak to, and passed by another server) and show it to her. She said Eww and picked up the whole tray, taking it back to the kitchen, leaving me the only one at the table with no food, and no offer of something in the mean time.  Eventually, the manager, Michael (according to our server, who I had to ask because he didn't even bother to introduce himself, and didn't have on a nametag (no one does here)) came over. He bends down to the table and begins by saying that the packet doesn't come from food service packaging. Well thanks for pointing that out. Clearly with my industry experience I would have no idea of that. His tone was accusatory, so I asked him a question. I'm sorry, I'm trying to figure out if you're accusing me of putting that in my food. He immediately backpedaled.. Well.. More like side stepped, and tried to cover it up. Oh no, he says. ""I'm not accusing you of anything. It's just that those aren't found in food boxes and wouldn't be in the kitchen. I don't want it to happen to another guest. I can bring you another burger, or the menu and you can pick something else?"" Nope. No thank you. I'm good. He leaves the table. My friend has lost her appetite. We let the kids eat, pay, and go.  I have NEVER been so angry leaving a restaurant before!! Not only do I not get to eat my dinner because of foreign matter in my food, but when we involved management, it was basically blown off and blamed on me!! This place is horrible!!!"
Brittney F.,"Columbus, OH",57,44,19,4.0,8/1/2014,"Despite having to wait for over 30 minutes with having call ahead sitting, the meal was great!  I had a BBQ chicken deep dish pizza mini size :) very good and filling! Their regular pizzas are also very tasty.  The menu is literally a textbook...so much to choose from! I would recommend their pizzas out of everything though.  The best part of the meal? The pazookies! Omg I swear I could eat one of these every day! Fresh out of the oven cookie topped with vanilla ice cream, how could you go wrong?! Recommend the chocolate chunk and peanut butter :)  The service? It was pretty good for the most part! One of the orders got messed up but they comped a dessert because of it, which was very nice of them! (And we didn't even complain)  I'd love to come back here for a small meal and try a few of their tasty cocktails and brews!"
Erin C.,"Northwest, Columbus, OH",0,2,,5.0,9/2/2016,Suzanne is the best I will never sit in anyone elses section. This place is so lucky to have het she is hard working and makes sure the food is always right
Remy D.,"Dublin, OH",6,39,7,3.0,8/13/2016,Decent food at a decent price. Haven't found anything here that's mind blowing that I absolutely have to come back for. The times I've been was never my choice
Steve S.,"Columbus, OH",15,34,1,5.0,7/13/2016,Food was great . Ron was our Server and he was awesome. Prices were nice selection was awesome.  Lots of different draft beers all good!
Sam U.,"Hilliard, OH",1,14,,2.0,3/19/2016,"When you show the waitress the uncooked bacon on your California Club, and she responds 'ooh yuck', you know that your meal was subpar. Then, once your waitress knows, and you share it with the manager too, you think that you may get a little something for the inconvenience. But no. Needless to say, we won't be back anytime soon."
Han K.,"Berlin, Germany",47,10,1,2.0,7/31/2016,This place is salty and pricy for the food I get. I'm. Never full after lunch meals. If I'm paying $12+ I better be full.
Lauren K.,"Dublin, OH",52,22,6,1.0,6/3/2016,"Tried to get dinner here because this BJs has a patio and it's nice out. Got a drink at the bar while waiting for a table and the bartender saw that our table was ready and walked past our cars waiting to pay three times before she actually ran it.  Got sat on the patio and our server didn't come up to us for about five minutes. Fair, because we already had drinks but we were hungry and wanted an app. Ordered the app and another round of drinks. My fiancé asked what rotating taps they had and the server said ""Haha, I don't know, we have like six rotating taps."" Didn't even list them off. My fiancé then asked which BJs rotating tap was and the server answered, ""I don't know, a ginger something."" Ok? Thanks for the info.  We put in our food order and barely had finished before we were asked if we wanted dessert. We said no. The food was great, it's rarely not. Shortly after that she brought us our check without even asking if we wanted it. My fiancé and I would've had another beer had she asked but it was pretty clear she didn't want us there anymore. We put our card in the check and it was at least another 5 or 7 minutes before she came back to run it. In this time I waited for another side of the sauce for my food that I asked for (got the avocado egg rolls) and never received that. She clearly didn't want us there! I've worked in the service industry before. I served for a few years. Tonight was NOT busy. There was no excuse for this awful service.  We've had way better service at the Polaris location. Ask for John V. He's the best."
BARBIE G.,"Columbus, OH",13,2,,3.0,6/25/2016,"While our lunch service was painfully slow (I gotta get back to work people). Our server was definitely mailing it in. Everyone has a bad day, right? This was hers. Well thankfully, our sriacha brussel sprout app helped pass the time. Crispy with a nice kick - great for sharing. Our reluctant sever was slow to refill our drinks, despite the blazing sun on the patio. However, we were satisfied when our salads were finally delivered. More brussel sprouts with the kale salad, add salmon. Asian salad with blackened chicken. Both were delicious. While the service could be improved, the food is pretty consistent."
Jay P.,"Hilliard, OH",26,92,1,4.0,7/20/2015,"Just had lunch here today and had no complaints. The service was good, the food arrived quickly and the large screen TV was showing the final round of the golf tournament.  We ordered the avocado spring rolls as an appetizer and they were fabulous. Our waitress said they are the #1 appetizer on the menu and we believed her.  For lunch I had a ham, turkey and bacon sandwich. It came with a side salad and had Swiss cheese and a slaw of some kind on it, it was all very tasty. My companion had the buffalo bacon burger, with wedge fries. His plate was HUGE! What he really liked though was the black cherry soda they offer, which is house made. We did not have dessert, as we were stuffed! This was my first lunch visit but it will not be my last. We did not stay long enough to learn who won the golf match, so please keep that information to yourself until I can get home."
Carol S.,"Dublin, OH",30,20,8,5.0,5/15/2016,Always wonderful food. Jennifer was our server and provided exceptional service in spite of the fact that she was also waiting on a very large party nearby.
K E.,"Hilliard, OH",0,8,,5.0,7/5/2016,"We have never had a bad meal here. The drink menu is very extensive, the menu has something for everyone and the pizzookis are to die for!! In addition the service has always been superb!"
Alex K.,"Columbus, OH",82,7,,3.0,3/11/2016,"Atmosphere: this is pretty run of the mill. It's a huge space with a bar on one side. We came on a Thursday night and the place was packed. Think Cheesecake Factory (I'm pretty sure this was founded or is owned by the same people as Cheesecake Factory) overall the lighting is good, it's not too loud and is pretty comfortable. 4/7  Service: My wife and I were late and were seated with our party promptly. The wait staff was polite and attentive. Once again due to the nature of the establishment, they were well trained and almost mechanicals in their operation. Don't expect anything above and beyond it is what it is. If you are looking for knowledgable staff about beer, go to a real brewery.  4/7 Drink: I started out by ordering a Black and Tan. The restaurant uses their own Brewer pale ale on the drink (I suspect it is really a contract brew and not made by BJs). My drink tastes fine, but I was disappointed by the pour. My favorite part of a Black and Tan is the visually striking contrast between the Guinness and the other beer, however my drink was poured too roughly and the two beers were muddled together. Next I ordered their light lager, feeing in the mood for something crisp and refreshing. Being the restaurants proprietary beer, I figured the brew had potential. Honestly, it may have been one of the worst beers I've ever had. I'd rather shotgun a lukewarm can of natty ice that I accidentally left un refrigerated in the sun for a few days (but that's enough nostalgia for now sorry).  I passed the light beer off to one of my dining companions who also declared it an abomination (but managed to consume it in its entirety) I then went for a bottle of the list. They had a pretty good selection of Belgians. For the wine-o's out there, the wine is reasonably priced and they proudly pour 7 oz (be careful ladies)! Also you can get a mini bottle of Chandon for 9$ (we did duh).  3.5/7 Food: this menu is huge and eclectic, lots of pasta dishes, sandwiches, burgers etc. there was not a whole lot for vegetarians here and I found some the selections interesting (half the food would not pair well with beer, the supposed theme of the place). I went with fish and chips which was average. My wife got salmon and quinoa which looked alright. Prices were reasonable. Everyone was happy. Truly nothing special though.  3.5/7 Overall: if I want craft beer, there are at least twenty cooler places in Columbus. If I want pub fare, the food here can easily be topped. What this establishment does achieve is providing a good place for a group of people with a wide range of tastes. I don't think it is going to blow anyone out of the water but pretty much anyone can eat here, feel comfortable and find something they'll like. 4/7"
