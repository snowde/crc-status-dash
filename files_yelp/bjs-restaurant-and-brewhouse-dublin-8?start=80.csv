Henry G.,"Dublin, OH",0,8,,3.0,7/1/2016,I used to visit the Tampa location years ago and wasn't really impressed with any of their menu items. When I came to Ohio I heard about all the fuzz and the long lines at the Tuttle location. I've visited the Tuttle location a few times and nothing on the menu (except for the beer selection) seems to impress me. I'd stick to beer and appetizers. I know they also have some cheap lunch specials and the place isn't crowded for lunch at all.
Ripudaman S.,"Columbus, OH",102,8,,2.0,3/12/2016,"The ambience of the place is really nice. Can't say the same about the food although the in house beers are really nice. The food that i ordered or my friends ordered was not so great. It may be a case that we ordered wrong things. The beat thing was Avocado rolls and the pizookie in deserts. I ordered ribs, Brussel  sprouts, spinach stuffed mushrooms and their speciality New Orleans Jambalaya and all of them were disappointing. We almost left the food untouched. The two stars are just for the beer and we tried light switch lager and harvest hefeweizen."
Jeremy Y.,"Hilliard, OH",0,1,,1.0,3/13/2016,No BBQ lunch platter? This is now the second menu item you've pulled that I would order. Tried a steak a while back as well that was no bueno. Will not be returning anytime soon.
Joseph S.,"Galloway, OH",8,115,56,4.0,2/17/2016,"Every time I go to the mall, this place is packed. I can see why. I ordered the pizza, but when I saw what others around me ordered, it looked delicious. The pizza reminded me of Pizza Hut in the early 90's when some locations had a oven and not those conveyor belts. Trust me, that's a good thing. I want to try this sandwich I saw that this person ordered in front of me, but the pizza was so good I may get that again. The only thing I hope is they clean the lamp shades above the tables closest to the bar. They were very dust and looked disgusting."
Mark K.,"Columbus, OH",182,1929,1240,3.0,3/20/2012,"I was prepared to be disappointed, knowing it was a chain and reading a few of the other reviews.  And: I wasn't.  Low expectations?  Maybe.  But it was a good experience. The service was very good.  The place is pretty nice.  I tried the root beer first, and it wasn't bad.  Not great, but pretty good: a mellow blend of herbal and sweet, not too carbonated or overly sweet.  Next I had a flight of beers.  There doesn't seem to be any sort of sampler on the menu, but you can get 4 good-size beakers of whatever you want.  I tried the Hefeweizen, red ale, ""Abbey Normal,"" and porter.  All were good, not great.  I particularly liked the red and the abbey-style.   Lots of good stuff on the menu, but I didn't want to go overboard.  Tried the fried artichokes and the avocado egg rolls.  The artichokes were really good, and came with a ranchy dipping sauce.  The egg rolls were also good, with large fresh chunks of avocado and a blend of other ingredients.   Don't know if I'll be back soon, but that's not because it's bad- just that there are so many better places out there.  Plus, I'll admit, I was a bit disappointed in the root beer.  I had hoped it would be good enough to justify taking some home, and coming back regularly.  Nah.  But it's worth trying."
Carmen P.,"Columbus, OH",18,14,14,5.0,7/11/2015,This is my second time to this restaurant in the same week. Employees were really nice and our waitress was always checking on us and making us feel like home. I love the Santa Fe with grilled salmon salad. I even brought my baby the second time with no issues. I definitely recommend this place!
Michelle S.,"Canal Winchester, OH",26,95,7,5.0,3/14/2015,"Every time they have a seasonal beer I try it and it never disappoints. I love that the staff knows their stuff and makes selections so much easier. A good mojito is hard to find in Ohio and theirs are pretty good. A bit on the sweet side though. If you came to drink, you're at the right place! Don't forget to order the gourmet Mac and cheese. They serve it nice and hot, it's so flavorful full of bacon and cheese. Goodness in every bite. Their entrees are pretty good too. I really enjoyed their lighter side of the menu such as the bbq bison burger and fries... Their  prices are decent. In a nut shell this place has a great atmosphere, drink selection, and reasonably price good food. Bonus! You can take home their beers if you love it that much!"
Angie K.,"Philadelphia, PA",15,228,368,4.0,4/11/2015,"Get the jambalaya! It's really good. It says it comes in a spicy sauce but it's really not saucy or that spicy. However, it has amazing flavor and a good proportion of meat to rice. But make sure you save room for a pizookie. Seriously you can't go to BJ's and not get a pizookie. All of the flavors are soooo good."
Linda E.,"Columbus, OH",21,96,9,2.0,12/22/2015,"(the following review is for their whole online ordering experience only, as our restaurant experience was great) Well weird... had a strange experience with BJ's tonight. We didn't eat in, we got take-out, using the online ordering system (which needs some serious work). I'm not going to go into detail about everything we ordered, but a couple of items were missing/forgotten and my flatbread pizza (the California Club) not only had minimal ingredients (where was the avocado???) but I found tiny slivers of plastic in it!?!?!? I was like wtf??? I pulled them out of my pizza to make sure it wasn't just hardened pieces of cheese, but nope... it was very thin strips of white plastic. In my fricken pizza. How that could happen is beyond me, but it was there. That alone has turned me off from ever ordering from them again. I realize accidents happen, but how plastic makes its way into food is baffling and I'm not taking the risk a 2nd time. Sorry. It appears they don't take as much care on their take-out orders as they do on orders placed in-house.  Also, I'd like to add that their online ordering system p'd me off a tad. I wanted, at first, one of the entrees, but didn't want the sides it came with. However, I discovered that with the online ordering, you can't swap sides. If you delete the sides the dish comes with, that's it, you're done, you don't get to pick something different in its place. You can take away, but you can't add. So if you want a different side, you have to order it separately, meaning you have to pay for it separately, so I decided against that entree because I'm not paying $15 for one piece of fish when I have to add - and pay extra for - the sides that I want.  Speaking of sides, there are no pictures and no descriptions of the items. Side dish of avocado.... okay, um, is that a whole avocado? A half of one? Avocado spread or perhaps guacamole? Side of bacon... how many slices? A side meatball... are we talking just ONE meatball here? For $2.95? You guys really need to be a little more specific.  Also, it would be nice to have the date and time you've chosen to pick up your order displayed on the ""review and submit"" screen. I wasn't sure if the system had recorded the pick-up time and I was a little nervous about hitting the submit button. The pick-up time was correct, but I didn't see it until I received the confirmation email. In other words, if you forget what pick-up time you chose or you want to make certain the time is correct before you hit submit, you'll have to start all over again. Or do like I did... hit submit and pray the correct pick-up time was received. Not cool. All information, including the customer's requested time for pick-up, should be on the final screen before you submit the order. We may eat in again, but no more take-out from BJ's."
Tyricia W.,"Belleville, MI",1,5,10,2.0,5/7/2016,Food is always A1 which is why I'm sure this location is still in business. I visit this location monthly which is why I forget how horrible their takeout/curbside service is. Every time EVERYTIME I order curbside they don't answer the phone so I have to go in their website causes problems when u check out...and the staff isn't rude but the aren't polite. It's this is constant with EVERY visit!!! Gotta find a new one
Ness S.,"Dublin, OH",80,468,276,3.0,12/22/2013,"Positives: Nice atmosphere, good drinks, a good place to go for a laid back night out.  Mostly pizza/burger type of place although they have other items on the menu as well. But better quality then say a Buffalo Wild Wings type of place although not as fun on game night.  Negatives: the burgers are just average plenty of better places in the Columbus area, although the pizzas are not too bad.  I'll try it once in a while but nothing stands out."
Danielle S.,"Manlius, NY",8,15,3,4.0,6/16/2015,My husband and I went here for dinner our first night in town. We saw how many cars were in the parking lot at 8pm on a Monday so we hoped that meant this was a good place and boy did they not disappoint. My husband had the bison burger and I had a roast beef sandwich. The beef was tender and had little fat. The aujuis and horseradish complemented the sandwich nicely. We ended with the chocolate chip cookie served with ice cream and that was so delicious. We really enjoyed our dinner and would go back if we come out here again.
Walt S.,"Columbus, OH",177,397,66,4.0,7/27/2013,"BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse is a very nice place for lunch.... but... BUYER BEWARE!   Arrive before 12 Noon on a weekday or suffer the consequences of a lengthy wait.  A good sign that the food and service is good.... but I hate waiting. The food is above par at BJ's - and the servers will listen to you if you've got something you'd like to try.  EXAMPLE:  There are three salads on the lunch menu:  garden, cobb, honey crisp.  They're all chicken-based presentations.  Me?  I asked for blackened salmon as a substitute on the cobb salad and it was a good lunch portion and the salmon was cooked to perfection.  My co-lunchers got a personal pizza (cheese) and it was consumed with glee while the other got a gooey-looking chicken sandwich. One thing that was on the ""weak"" side was a side - chips and salsa.  Of course, what can you do to make that app better than most?  Dunno.  But industry standard corn chips (yellow and red) with a small cup of a sauce that was a mix between salsa and marinara sauce was disappointing. BJ's is pushing what a lot of restaurants are pushing these days and that's craft style brew.  A full menu of what's being poured is front and center in the servers' minds and that's cool.  But beers during a business hour lunch?  Uh.... c'mon.  But maybe I'm the prude. I like their interior presentation.  The bar is cool looking.  The patio is smallish and not all that good looking since seated there you'll be looking at Tuttle Mall... but it's summer and you're outdoors. Try BJ's.  You'll enjoy it, I believe."
D H.,"Hilliard, OH",43,23,17,4.0,3/25/2016,Great atmosphere and a large menu with a lot of choices. Great beer and food with good low-cal options.
Mary B.,"Columbus, OH",0,13,,1.0,10/19/2016,"My server, Sarah, was rude, passive aggressive, and all around a nightmare to deal with. I understand the place is busy, but I'm still a paying customer and I was pleasant with her throughout. This pleasantry was not reciprocated. The food is not good enough to make up for crappy service. If you're looking for good food or good service, you'll be twice as disappointed."
Bruce H.,"Cleveland, OH",0,3,,3.0,10/24/2015,"Good atmosphere, good service, good food.  If you're looking for the local pub this isn't it, but what it is is a reliable modern American brewpub chain.   The house brew list is long and varied.  I enjoyed the IPA.  Food wise my wife loved the honey siracha brussel sprouts.  We had a deep dish pizza which was more crust than toppings, but everyone including the kids enjoyed it.  We all agreed we would go back"
Taner P.,"Columbus, OH",10,53,5,4.0,8/30/2015,"Always but always good service, decent food and smile on the faces that welcomes you here every time you think a place to eat and spend quality time with the loved ones. Been to all of them in Columbus, número uno reason for me to revisit this chain is Consistency which is the main success reason in restaurant business. Go ahead try it. The only reason it is 4 from 4.40 is that it is chain and nothing that I have eaten is out of this world."
Chas M.,"Cleveland, OH",91,802,795,4.0,8/5/2014,"Huge restaurant and huge menu.  Kind of reminds me of a Cheesecake Factory.  Servers were all very cool without being stuffy.  Food was good but the beer was suprisingly good.  Most chain places have over-processed, watery brews but this place had super full flavored beers.  The Imperial Stout was almost too much.  But Im a big boy and I drank it with a smile.  That explains the naked pushups in the parking lot I was doing after three of them bad boys..."
Lynsey L.,"Marysville, OH",0,11,,2.0,3/19/2016,"A large menu leaves you with plenty of choices and we would go here more, unfortunately majority of the people you talk to on the phone here are rude and not helpful at all. Tried to get on the call ahead list and we got a snotty short response to our number of guests. We may not know your reservation/ call ahead policy there is no need to be rude. So again very disappointed because we like going to places where everyone can get what they are in the mood for but we won't be spending our money in a place where the staff isn't exactly welcoming or helpful with information."
Sara H.,"Columbus, OH",0,7,,5.0,9/16/2016,"The service from welcome to wait staff is very warm and friendly- food top notch, however too big of portion for me - that's ok - leftovers for Monday at work- this is our third trip and we will be back - Haley (I don't know if I spelled it right) is top notch."
