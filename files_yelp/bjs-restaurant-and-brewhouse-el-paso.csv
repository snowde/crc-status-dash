Ashley S.,"El Paso, TX",2,10,9,4.0,12/17/2017,"Usually a little slow but tonight was quicker than usual. Their soups are really delicious but normally arrive on the lukewarm side  Tonight I got a mini pizza, and its totally worth any wait. I've had Chicago deep dish pizza, and this pizza definitely is a good substitute for El Paso"
Estefany M.,"El Paso, TX",26,185,177,3.0,11/10/2017,"Dined here on a Wednesday night. The restaurant was very empty with just a few tables with customers and a few individuals at the bar. Our waiter was great, he was very friendly and informative, providing information about their main dishes and his opinion/suggestion on menu items. I ordered the Peruvian shrimp quinoa and my husband had the seared ahi salad. In addition we ordered two alcoholic beverages with a mojito and a BJ's Irish root beer. I enjoyed the mojito and thought it was very good! As for the BJ's Irish root beer, I was not a huge fan. It was too sweet for me personally. As for our main entrees, the ahi salad was delicious, fresh and super healthy! My dish- the Peruvian shrimp quinoa, was also delicious! The mixture of quinoa with shrimp was fantastic- it just had an excess of lemon for my personal taste.  We finished our dinner with the pizookie with churros- a seasonal special! It was delicious and highly recommend it if you are an avid fan of churros- like myself! Overall, service was good, I was unhappy with my alcoholic beverage for the amount I paid for the BJ's Irish root beer was not worth it, not tasty. Save your money instead for a desert. I thought the Desert was much worth it in comparison to the drink."
Jay B.,"El Paso, TX",66,220,325,3.0,8/13/2017,"Some people would describe BJ's as a high end Applebee's or Chili's. Me? I'm not so sure. This is actually a tough review for me to write because BJ's has always been one of those places to me that...doesn't quite fit a perfect little slot. Plus, I think it's a bit pretentious to call them ""high end"" anything. But...let's talk about this in detail, because it's not like this is a bad restaurant or anything. Truth is...it's actually been years since we last visited BJ's. We're fairly certain the menu was given a major overhaul since the last time we visited (which must have been sometime back in 2006 or so). I couldn't even tell you what I ordered back then. But I'm certain it didn't compare to the hand pulled turkey dip, which was freakin' phenomenal, btw! I was impressed by the fact that they used carved turkey rather than thinly sliced turkey. The horseradish was a nice touch, too. Not too overpowering at all. But before I could have the meal, I ordered some clam chowder. The wife also got her favorite: the tortilla soup. Wanna know what these two bowls of soup had in common? Whilst they both tasted good, they were also both unfortunately served lukewarm. My question is: what the hell happened?! It's as if all the soup warmers in the restaurant were broken and they decided to have some kid toss it in the microwave in the back; only they put it in there for 10 seconds instead of 30. I'd have sent it back to get a much warmer portion, but by then...the main course would have already arrived and I wouldn't have wanted any more soup at that point. Such a shame. I was a little surprised to see that the decorum hadn't changed much at all since I last visited this place. Then again, they *are* technically a chain. They have a revolving door out front. I don't think I've seen many restaurants with revolving doors, but okay. Not a deal breaker for me...just...weird. Once again, I have to point out the delayed and dubious service here. Though not outright bad per se, it seems more like...hit or miss. Towards the beginning, the server was alright. But it initially took 10 minutes after seating before we were even acknowledged. And then at one point during the course of the night, it took ages to get refills for our drinks. Not sure why this is such a huge problem. Perhaps they're understaffed, but I wouldn't know. I'm not the manager. Ultimately, the prices for what's served here seem reasonable. I'd recommend BJ's to folks who are looking for gastropub food that's slightly different from the typical neighborhood family restaurants such as the aforementioned at the beginning of this review. Still, I don't feel as if they compare even remotely. I would certainly go back and try one of the burgers or maybe even the fish n' chips. For right now though, I'm giving BJ's 3 lukewarm bowls of clam chowder out of 5."
Brian M.,"El Paso, TX",1155,1121,7050,4.0,12/1/2017,"As a New Yorker from the city (Manhattan!!) I refused to and rarely ate at chain restaurants until the Army brought my ass to El Paso because I'm a proud supporter of local businesses. However, after being stationed at Fort Bliss for over 3 years, I think I've eaten at every chain restaurant there is in America lol. That being said, my first encounter with BJ's was on Veterans Day. I was never in America during the months of November (Deployments hello??) so I figured it would be the perfect time to snatch one of those Free or Discounted Veterans Day Meals and picked BJ's because the menu online looked decent and I didn't want generic Applebees or Chili's bullshit. Well guess what? Turned out to be a success!! Seriously never knew this place was a chain until I looked it up on Wikipedia! The food was contemporary, above average, although slightly hipster. The place has a nice vibe too. For occasional drinkers like myself, they even have their own version of Sparkling Sodas (I always get the Cucumber Mint one which is light and refreshing). I came back the other night for dinner and it was consistent and satisfying. Definitely one of my favorite 'chain' restaurants in El Paso!!"
Charles Y.,"Chicago, IL",259,216,216,4.0,7/17/2017,I called for reservations and was told no same day reservations. Im not mad about that...I was just expecting long wait time and trying to get over...LOL We went on a Friday night so I was expected a 30 minute wait. Nope we were immediately seated and only a portion of our party was present! Server for the night did a great job. The food was on point. I had combo deep dish and it was so good I was happy to have some left for the next day. If you looking for a deep dish pizza in El Paso then this is it. If your a thin oven baked kinda person then there is some good alternatives in the area.
Jose D.,"El Paso, TX",0,23,27,3.0,6/20/2017,"Today's visit was a bit disappointing. My wife and I went for a late lunch. Our menus were dirty (almost every page) with old stuck pieces of ""whatever"". I had to comment to our server. The salmon was excellent. The Parmesan crusted chicken was less than attractive. It tasted stale as if the chicken had been in a freezer for quite some time. The ceaser salad was good (not much can go wrong here). We also had desserts to see if we could salvage lunch and fortunately we did. I would come back as I've had better experiences here."
Eddie G.,"El Paso, TX",0,14,13,2.0,6/18/2017,"Well, previously, the description of this restaurant from me has always been good and satisfying.  But today on Fathers Day has been not an exciting event for myself.  The wait time was respectable and seating was nice from our waitress. The establishment cleanliness is a 3 out of 5 today sad to say. The drinks we all ordered were made nicely with no complaint. But ultimately, the reason for eating out was a letdown- the food was not as good as it normally holds as for a higher ranking. The Shrimp and Asparagus Penne was very sad and disgusting! The mini pizza I also order was good as always. All around, the food was below average. The steak was not cooked to order and was bland. The ribs were underwhelming. Their ""premium sides"" weren't worth the money. Makes me think they have new cooks or the current cooks just don't care about sending out good food anymore?  The only reason I'm rating this a 2 star is because the waitress actually tried to help. The manager came to the table but the visit was so brief, I was not able to give him my feedback. I'd rather send my friends and family to Cheddars next time as I will be certain to spread the word to the 1000 members I work with. Word of mouth can be very impactful!  Definitely very disappointed in this establishment.  We will not return."
Cindie B.,"El Paso, TX",103,28,10,5.0,6/9/2017,I have no idea why I waited so long before coming back because this place is the BOMB. large restaurant so we didn't have to wait on a Friday evening (impossible with little kids) and the food is AMAZING. Best fish tacos (grilled) I have EVER had. The prime rib special on the weekends is a great deal (comes with desert and the cut is huge) and super delicious. My kids love the spag and meatballs and fun to try the flights of beers. will not wait so long before going back.  thanks to BJs for another great experience.
Jen S.,"El Paso, TX",73,185,114,3.0,4/3/2016,"BJs feels pretty corporate, like they copy and pasted the restaurant design and menu from a catalog.  The beer menu was equally as bland.  BUT...the pizza was great!!"
Laura A C.,"El Paso, TX",45,135,238,3.0,11/15/2016,Good food good atmosphere. I had the Parmesan crusted chicken and it was awesome !  Drinks we had to send back twice because the bartender didn't know how to make a simple old fashioned.
Savannah R.,"El Paso, TX",47,11,13,5.0,2/26/2016,"Our server, Vanessa, was absolutely fantastic. My best friend and I, were the last customers to leave because we were having such a wonderful time talking to her. Regardless of her many tables, she managed to tend to every single one of them, kindly and in a timely manner. We ordered the turkey burger and the portabella mushroom burger (being a vegetarian), along with deserts, and an amazing brussel sprout appetizer. We loved everything so much that a to go box was not needed, and being surrounded by wonderful people and superb decorum, encouraged us to stay and finish everything off.  Loved this place, and we'll be back soon!"
Lisa C.,"Honolulu, HI",1,31,27,4.0,10/7/2016,"I was meeting a friend for dinner and she arrived before me. She informed the hostess that I have a service animal (thinking she should, but she didn't really know better either) and the hostess sat her in the very back table stating it was to keep kids away from my SD. When I arrived I was a bit confused by learning this since my SD is my responsibility and I do not require ""special seating location far from all other patrons"" when I go anywhere. I've never been out to eat and had anyone go under my table to attempt to pet my dog. That is just awkward and I am very capable of correcting someone or addressing a parent.  The table was round  and awkward for my SD to tuck under since she had to try and curve her body around the bench and table leg. We made it work though. The server was nervous and asked if my SD bites because she is afraid of dogs. I'm sorry but if a SD bites it probably isn't really a SD to begin with. I tried not to be snarky in responding to her since she didn't know any better (apparently) and that was that. I prefer to educate rather than be rude but I was already irritated for being seated near the kitchen under the excuse of ""kids"" might touch my dog.  Aside from the SD issue, the food was amazing. I ordered the baked ziti and it was delicious!! I believe we had nachos for appetizer and that too was very good. So 5 stars for the food, 4 stars for the service. Please teach your staff to ignore service animals and unless special seating is requested by the handler do not take it upon themselves to think we want to be isolated from the rest of the restaurant patrons."
Levi K.,"Fort Bliss, TX",16,26,3,4.0,4/17/2017,"Good business. Food is BJ quality, service is always friendly and we get our food pretty quick."
Jill M.,"Arlington, VA",302,56,302,4.0,11/12/2015,"Our waitress Natalia was helpful accommodating and amazing. The menu is gigantic- my friend took 30min to read thru it. They offer turkey patties for their burgers, which is a great healthy option. They have a great beer selection- I recommend the flights. It is mostly a grill- but actually the mahimahi tacos are made incredibly well. We went on a Thursday night with a large group and had a great time. Also- we also came on Veterans Day and they had a great deal for vets and had good service."
Charles W.,"Grandview, MO",30,4,,4.0,4/8/2017,"This is one of the best eateries in El Paso. The ambiance is excellent and their decor is top-class. Their service is amazing, especially if you have a gluten allergy. Their food may be hit-or-miss based upon what you pick, but it is good the vast majority of the time. Servers were always attentive and polite, even during peak hours. Highly recommend."
Jaime P.,"El Paso, TX",0,2,2,3.0,3/14/2017,"Great atmosphere.    Gets very busy on weekend.  Food was always good here, but I was disappointed in the quality the last time I went.  Beer is good.  Lots of choices.  It can be a little more colder with the drafts."
Isah K.,"El Paso, TX",48,149,459,5.0,8/25/2014,"A wonderful beer dinner tonight. For $30 you receive a food course meal that has been paired with a variety of Goose Island beer. No samples. These are practically full glasses of beer.  This is a great way to taste beer, mic and mingle, sample some BJ's meals and learn a little beer history. If you can catch a beer dinner event it will be worth your time and money."
Kristy F.,"Fort Bliss, TX",56,2,,5.0,1/29/2017,Ryan was our service he was very personable and gave excellent service! Food was great!
Monica J.,"El Paso, TX",18,37,347,4.0,2/20/2016,"Our family loves BJ'S so we are regulars.  The menu is extensive with a combination of lunch and dinner portions, the service is always great, and the food is freshly delicious.  The ambiance is also casual yet refined.  They also bring you a cookie with ice cream in your birthday.  Oh and don't forget their reward program- it's a great perk."
Zizo23 ..,"El Paso, TX",0,2,,5.0,12/5/2016,Great selection of food and drinks. My to go place after work. Carlos/Steven are amazing!
Eddie P.,"El Paso, TX",21,122,290,4.0,6/6/2015,"I always enjoy coming to BJs because of the environment. I feel like I'm not in El Paso. I know sometimes a lengthy menu is painful to look through but their menu is full of good stuff. Most of the appetizers are really good. I've sometimes had my full meal of appetizers. Must try the avocado egg rolls and the corn fritters. The drink menu is extensive as well and the best part is that they brew their own beers. I usually go for the Jeremiah Red which is a red Irish ale. They are famous for their Piranha Pale Ale which is actually featured in a dish as part of the chili. The pulled pork sandwich is always really good and it's really big too so beware. On this particular visit I ordered the New England Clam Chowder on a sourdough bowl......amazing. Definitely a must try. Their pizzas are really popular too and have so many options of toppings and crusts as well.  However the wait times at BJs always extend longer than predicted. I got there early to get a table for 7, they told me 25 minutes and we waited an hour and a half almost. We ordered our food quickly but it took another hour to get the food. I always think it's due to high volume of customers but even when it's dead I've had to wait a little longer than my butt sitting in the chair likes. The service however is great and the food always makes up for the wait."
Tanya Y.,"Chicago, IL",1420,699,3712,4.0,8/21/2013,"People forget BJ's is a chain restaurant. Think a better, high quality Chili's or Applebee's. As you might guess, BJ's is my first pick when choosing between chains. This BJ's feels very open with its 3 different areas (bar, main dining, and a dining area past the window/doors) and its high ceilings. TVs are conveniently placed around the restaurant, usually showing football, baseball, basketball or tennis. Watch your step when walking to the main dining area - I've seen at least 3 people trip and fall on the stairs. There are larger booths that could probably seat 4-6 comfortably, but they also have booths for 2. The smaller booths are roomy enough for sitting, but if you're ordering a lot you may have to start condensing plates. And even though BJ's is higher priced, anything you would wear into a Chili's is fine in here. In a huge chain like this I don't expect a culinary genius to be in the back preparing my food, however I am never disappointed with the dish I receive. In fact it usually exceeds my expectations. The last time I was at BJ's I ordered the Fish and Chips. Delicious. The fish was cooked properly and perfectly golden brown all around. I'm pretty sure their batter is made with one of their own beers. When getting any dish here with fries I almost always order the thin, crispy ones but if you like some more oomph to your fries they do have waffle fries I believe. Some of their dishes are a little different than what you'd expect (i.e. the Mac and Cheese comes topped with pieces of a cheese cracker...perhaps Cheese-it's or Goldfish), but the menu does outline the dishes so you shouldn't have any surprises. The menu is extensive so you're guaranteed to find something you like.  It seems like they have endless amounts of drink possibilities. Yes, it's a brewhouse so you can order many different beers and specialty drinks (some that change with the seasons), but they also have specialty sodas (I love the cream soda) and other drinks worth a try or two. All the staff is really nice and knowledgeable. I almost could've given this BJ's a 5 star, but service isn't always the fastest. The fact that they have no problem to immediately rectify any issues you may have without making it a huge ordeal is almost redeeming though. And although it is a chain, this is definitely somewhere you should try when in EP if you haven't been to one before."
Angela P.,"El Paso, TX",29,2,,2.0,1/30/2016,"Okay let me start off by saying we have been here before and the service was good and so was the food but DO NOT come if you have a party bigger then 4. We had a 10 top table and we were treated like crap since we walked in. We waited over an hour and a half to be seated, to only get a table by complaining to the host.  Once we were seated we waited 15 minutes before we got our drinks and placed our order after we waited about 20-30 minutes. As the food was coming out one order was wrong which is not bad for the party size but then they burnt the steak another person in the party ordered and tried to bring it 20 minutes later after everyone was finished eating. After that they brought the bill and tried to give us a discount on it instead of stating that they were at fault and compensating. And for the wait no one a apologized and the company did not give a rats ass.  The server herself is the reason this gets another star because she tried and she took care of items on the bill to make up for the lack of the company. We will probably never return, just because the company sucks."
Raquel M.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,2,2,1.0,3/11/2017,"Worst service I have ever experienced. The waitress did not take any of the appetizer plates nor empty drink cups off the table. I used to be a waitress and understand being busy. HOWEVER, there is no excuse for ignoring your customers. She did not ask how our food was nor take the empty entrée plates off the table. I spoke with the manager and  he was apologetic for the unsatisfactory service. I appericate his candor and that he did not make excuses for his staff. The manager gets a 5 for that his staff a 1."
Edmond L.,"Orlando, FL",23,180,373,1.0,11/10/2014,"Ate here back in July with a buddy.  Food came out quick, accurate and service was good.  It was a weekday and we went for lunch so it was pretty slow.  Pleasant experience. Flash forward to last Friday, November 7th.  Came here with a party of 6 for dinner.  Server, forgot his name but he looked like the scientist from Terminator 2, failed to write down our orders and decided that he could memorize 6 orders from memory.  Okay, we'll see how this turns out... I said to my wife, ""he'll probably be back a couple of times.""  A couple of times was an understatement.  Despite coming back to the table about 4 times, he still go the orders wrong by bringing the skinny fries instead of the wedge fries.  Mother in law ordered a half rack of ribs with mashed potatoes.  Her food came out cold, potatoes tasted like they came out of a box.  Friend ordered a full rack of ribs, they were flavorless.  The food was sent back.  Mother in law decided to get a burger instead since my 2 buddies who joined us got burgers and they didn't mess those up.  Friend decided not to chance it and just ate the chicken wings she ordered as an appetizer. What about my food?  Remember how I said the server failed to write down our orders and waned to memorize everything?  He forgot to put my order in...  In all, I got my burger 1 hour after sitting down.  And he brought skinny fries instead of the wedge fries I asked for.  I just about lost it.  If it weren't for the fact that I had a light breakfast and an MRE (Meal Ready to Eat) for lunch and was starving, I would've just asked for the check and went to Taco Bell or some place cheap where you would expect them to mess your order up. Manager came over, apologized profusely for the cold food and orders being wrong.  I suggested to him that maybe the server should have a pen/paper to write down orders. The only good thing that came out of it was that my food, my mother in laws food and my friends food was not billed. Also, parking was sorely lacking.  Restroom was clean, though. My first experience here was good but the second experience here was bad enough for me to not go back again.  After driving from the west side and hitting traffic on I-10, it turned out to be a 1 hour commute.  It's simply not worth taking a chance again."
Kimberly R.,"El Paso, TX",5,19,14,5.0,2/27/2016,Everything I've ordered so far has been amazing! Love the deserts and the sampler plate. Tons of space and a really great atmosphere.
Sal H.,"El Paso, TX",49,48,95,5.0,5/3/2014,Seating is usually quick with minimal waiting. Great place for good food and drinks. Try the calzone!   Staff is attentive.  Booths are specious and kids are welcome to the restaurant. Great place to come and watch games. Bar area is good.
Michelle E.,"El Paso, TX",11,99,39,1.0,8/23/2015,"The server was nice, but wow was she inept.  It seemed like every time she went to the kitchen, it would take forever for her to come back! She would come back with a tray full but nothing that should have taken the time that it did. There was just a lot of little jacked up stuff!  The poor table behind is waited forever for their food and the baby was getting irritated so the dad banged hard on the table to keep the kid happy(understandably) but it was super annoying to us. Why someone didn't bring something for the baby to eat is my question???? The manager came to the table behind us and in front of us, but not a word to us. I will not come back. One star is actually too much."
Carmen L.,"Chaparral, NM",1,45,71,2.0,8/8/2015,"We checked this place out the first week they opened and never went back.  Overpriced- service sucked- food not worth writing about.  Thought we would give it another shot.  GUESS WHAT... Overpriced- service sucked- food not worth writing about... Well, with the  exception of a stuffed mushroom appetizers with a pesto-garlicky type drizzle over the top.  This was good.  Really good.  I dipped by steak in it which is the only flavor it had."
Sam T.,"Farmington, MI",85,63,32,4.0,7/22/2014,"Came here for a pre-meeting lunch with some colleagues; then a post-meeting brew later on.  I had a sirloin steak with veggies and mozzarella / tomato salad. Everything was delicious. The steak had the house rub which was slightly salty, so without further seasoning by me, it was fine. The veggies had a heavy hand of butter, but I ate them all :-) and finally the salad was amazing! It had a balsamic vinaigrette that was perfectly portioned on the salad for a nice kick.  For the beer: fantastic! I had 2 flights (4, five oz samplers per flight) and my favorites were the red and the Hefeweizen. Close runners up were the IPAs.  We had the same nice girl before and after our meeting. She was attentive but not over-bearing; exactly what a server is supposed to do.  Honestly I have no complaints."
James S.,"El Paso, TX",45,1,,2.0,5/21/2016,Draft beer was hot. Slow wait staff. Pizza was good. Had to ask for cold beer and it still came out hot. Had to wait 20 minites for a new beer. The salads came out with no dressing. The pepperoni extreme pizza is awesome.
Nicole O.,"Mansfield, TX",0,36,2,3.0,11/12/2016,We normally LOVE bj's back home. Our food was good however the appetizer and meal came out at the same time. Our waitress was very slow and we waited on her more than she waited on us. Giving 3 stars because food was good but service was lacking.
Kyle W.,"Kansas City, MO",2,7,3,2.0,4/22/2015,Server was nice but service was very slow. We waited about 15 minutes for a water and an unsweetened iced tea. Order apps and those took about 20 minutes to come out and you could tell they had sat under a heat lamp for a while. Meal was decent. We have had their food before in other cities and it had been much better. Maybe it was an off night but I was pretty annoyed with my experience.
Olivia T.,"El Paso, TX",0,7,4,5.0,7/5/2016,"Great service! Brought my hungry toddlers meal very quickly before the meal. I had the Parmesan crusted chicken it was great, and the mashed potatoes are amazing!"
Jasmin G.,"Austin, TX",72,14,3,5.0,12/30/2015,"I love this place, I don't normally do chains but they have great brews and amazing food. Writing this review is actually making me crave their food! stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer is a must because they're so cheap. My favorite entrée is the Parmesan crusted chicken breast which is flattened and cooked evenly. They drizzle a lemon butter sauce on it which is to die for and their mashed potatoes make it feel like home. I recommend it"
Chanel C.,"Austin, TX",533,9,,3.0,11/28/2015,Service was pretty disappointing I was sitting by myself in the booth and the server only came by twice.. The food and beer were okay. The veggie pasta was a little cold. Maybe I should come on a different night. The avocado rolls were also pretty disappointing. I never got asked for a refill or how my food was. I gave 3 starts because I've been here before and the bartender was great.
Sheena T.,"Nashville, TN",373,608,1468,4.0,12/18/2013,"This place was pretty solid!  A large group of us came here after my sister's graduation, and we were luckily able to get a table for all of us on a busy Saturday night without a reservation. Good thing the restaurant is so huge!  I really enjoyed that they have delicious house wine for around $5.00 and a great beer selection (obv). We ordered the avocado egg rolls, and they were OK, a bit rich for my taste, but I loved the spinach artichoke dip. It was SO good and not greasy like most of them are. I loved it!! I had the chili as my dinner and it was pretty good. Not super memorable but not bad either.  Our waitress was excellent and kept our drinks full and plates cleared. Can't beat that!"
Elle L.,"New York, NY",17,52,49,1.0,11/21/2014,"I would rate their service a 0 if I could. I was quoted 1 hr and 20 mins. They kept changing our waiting time. Finally they tried to move our wait time to 3 1/2 hours!!! Their hostess's were extremely uncooperative, had a horrible attitude, and were gossiping the whole time. I spoke to the manager and he explained that they had been refilling our tables that we were waiting for?! I we were waiting why were they still sitting??! RIDICULOUS!  I will NEVER come to this BJ's"
AR R.,"El Paso, TX",56,3,,5.0,2/13/2016,The food is OUTSTANDING! This will definitely be a place that we is when we leave El Paso. My wife and I both had the burgers and hands down this is the best burger I ever had. I will definitely recommend this place to everyone.
Mark M.,"El Paso, TX",18,21,,4.0,11/19/2014,"My first time visiting was a Saturday for an early dinner. They have several televisions on the walls so it was easy to keep up with the college football scores. These weren't loud though, so conversation was still easy. The screens didn't take away from the sharp modern look of the place either. Cool vibe in there!  The menu was huge! I ended up getting the Alaskan salmon, and my date had the lasagna. Both were tasty. Service was fine. Nothing above and beyond, but no issues or problems either. Overall, this is a nice place, with good food and nice surroundings. I'd recommend checking it out."
