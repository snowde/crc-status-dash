Ted B.,"San Antonio, TX",0,22,1,2.0,10/9/2015,Ordered the fish and chips and it was over cooked and smelled like old grease. Service was good and quick.
A B.,"TX, TX",0,21,1,2.0,7/4/2016,The food was awful and the drinks weren't much better. However the manager was very apologetic and nice. But given the overall experience I won't be back anytime soon.
Chelsea S.,"Navarre, FL",0,4,,3.0,12/31/2015,"Great food but extremely poor customer service. My husband and I spent quite a few dollars at the bar watching football and the bar tenders acted too busy to ask us what we wanted, to refill our water, refill our beer and take our order. They lacked the customer service skills required to get good customers to return to bars like this one. Extremely disappointed in this one."
Sean M.,"Las Cruces, NM",0,8,,1.0,6/1/2016,Just got done eating and the service was terrible. Our waiter was busy talking to other people at the bar than getting drinks or even seeing if we need anything else. The only time we saw him was when he first brought our meal out to us. The food was not that good. The pizza was oily and my dad's meal was a little bit burnt.
Nomadic T.,"Yuma, AZ",0,198,19,4.0,1/4/2016,Seemed like a good BJs. Bartender Ashley was really nice and accomadating. Deep dish pizza was good as were the stuffed mushrooms. Very Berry and the Seasonal Octoberfest were great crafts.
Beto H.,"El Paso, TX",216,74,54,4.0,3/16/2014,"Came in tonight not really hungry but wanting something to drink to unwind. Then a miracle happened when I opened the menu and seen pictures of their food... You guessed it, I got hungry! So I told myself, ""Self, you deserve the juicy California burger with avocado and green chile"". So i ordered it with the Pomegranate Sunset drink (extra strong). The food was delicious and the drink was relaxing. I topped it off with a Caramel Salted Pazookie. I left this place winning and satisfied with the service."
Gera N.,"El Paso, TX",1,7,,4.0,10/16/2015,Awesome brews. Good food and great service everytime. I like this place. Kid friendly is always a plus
Camey B.,"El Paso, TX",0,2,,1.0,9/6/2015,"Went there on a whim with my husband. Although our waitress was very nice, the food was terrible. I ordered the brisket burger with crispy fried and he ordered the black and blue burger with wedges. Neither of our burgers where Cooked to the correct temperature. My husband's looked as though someone had sat on it before plating it. My bacon was burnt to charcoal and my fries were stale. The BBQ sauce that they put on the brisket tasted more like syrup than BBQ. I had to pull my burger apart to even try to finish it. I had worked in restaurants for 10 years before joining the service. I know what happened to our meal in the kitchen. BJ's is a chain restaurant. They have a free meal for vets and service members on Veterans Day. We will not be going. For the free food. There really is no excuse."
Vonnie S.,"Los Angeles, CA",97,328,519,3.0,6/27/2014,"It's a BJ's, what can you say?  Like most locations this one was large with a ton of TVs and a gigantic menu.  We came here around 9pm on Fathers Day.  The place was not crowded at all and was actually surprsingly empty. For it being this empty, our service was a tiny bit slow.  Our waitress had a large area to cover and she had a large party of 10 to take care on her own as well. The portions of food are plentiful and I had enough pasta to last for two additional meals.  I ordered the Shrimp Scampi pasta with extra shrimp and my husband ordered the chicken limone.  Both were good.  We were a little less impressed with our appetizer (tuna poke sashimi) but this was El Paso after all and I seriously doubt if they fly their fish in fresh every day.  The tuna was the right color but had none of the traditional poke flavors you'd expect.  Not a bad place to go when looking for options to feed several taste buds."
Michael M.,"Mason, MI",11,9,22,4.0,11/4/2014,"Have had 3 really nice experiences in the last week at BJ's. Although the house craft's were a little bit of a let down, Alise the bartender made the best dirty vodka martini I have ever had!!!!!! Jambalaya was absolutely amazing, Mahi-Mahi was fantastic!! Deep dish pizza came out under cooked and doughy but Alise immediately allowed me to choose another entrée (Jambalaya) . Best service I have had in a long time!!! Jeremiah Red was good but the Brown ale was not."
Albert K.,"El Paso, TX",402,775,1882,5.0,10/24/2009,"I was very excited to find out there is a BJ's in El Paso, I've been a fan of their pizza since I first visited the Dallas location and enjoyed a nice weekend dinner at the Burbank BJ's. Chicago Deep Dish pizza is my favorite, and honestly I've never had better than BJs, the El Paso location is no different.  I'm not a big time beer connoisseur, but the beers are pretty good IMHO.  I also recommend the potato skins app, they're yummy! One thing I really appreciate about this BJ's over other locations is the atmosphere, it is, for whatever reason, just a little bit above sports bar casual, which makes watching the game here a little more enjoyable (READ: folks aren't as rowdy).  Huge screen with multiple games, and they all combine to make a MEGASCREEN for Texas Longhorn games, understandably so.  Hook 'Em! \m/"
Casey G.,"El Paso, TX",2,19,,2.0,10/11/2015,"We were so excited to finally try BJ's after hearing great things about the chain. I think our first major mistake was trying this restaurant in El Paso. A lot of the food seemed pre-prepared and came out cold. I got the seared Ahi Tuna salad and the tuna was completely cold. My husband got the shrimp tacos and said the shrimp tasted precooked as well. Green beans came out completely raw and were sent back twice, only to be microwaved until they were chewy and shriveled up. Almost everything we ordered had something wrong with it. We won't be back to this particular restaurant."
Victoria S.,"Austin, TX",187,212,994,3.0,1/2/2014,"This is strictly a happy hour review: Drinks are a GREAT deal, but food is a HORRIBLE deal.  From 3-7 every day, all of their in-house beers and you-call-its are $4! I got Sapphire and tonics, which are usually $11 drinks, for $4! Martinis and mojitos are $5. I had a Lemon Drop and it was surprisingly fantastic.  Food, on the other hand, is awful. We ordered a deep-dish pizza which was all bread and didn't even come in a deep dish or any dish for that matter. We also ordered the boneless wings, which ended up being soggy little nuggets that were nearly inedible. For $6 each, these were a big bust.   Point is, try to make it in by 7 for the great drink specials, but definitely order food items off the regular menu."
Jerry R.,"El Paso, TX",1,23,13,1.0,5/24/2015,"Service is really slow, waitress had little to no knowledge of the food on the menu. Appetizers were mediocre with little to no taste. However, I ordered a steak and it wasn't bad. Balsamic Glazed Chicken and Parmesan Crusted Chicken were ok. I really liked the white cheddar mashed potatoes. Would I go again... Probably not."
Daniel W.,"Portland, OR",18,320,1649,3.0,2/9/2011,"BJ's is ok.  We go here when we aren't feeling adventurous and just want a decent appetizer and a cold beer.  Service is always just OK.  Hostesses are about as interested in their jobs as can be expected of teenagers.  The waitresses overuse the term 'guys' to the point I want to smack them.  We used to frequent the BJ's in Burbank until they put in a Gordon Biersch and then there was no reason to go back to BJ's.   The one thing I have to really complain about is the 'deep dish' pizza.  This is absolute garbage.  The crust is about 1 1/2"" thick and the toppings are the same quantity as a normal pizza.  Just because they serve this abomination in a deep cast iron pan does NOT make it a Chicago deep dish pizza.  While I am not an expert in Chicago deep dish, even the biggest chain pizza in Chicago makes a real deep dish pizza.  You can check out the pictures on their website ( ) or at a Yelp location( ) and decide for yourself.  Or better yet go to Chicago and try one!"
Rocky M.,"El Paso, TX",18,5,6,5.0,2/12/2015,After reading some of the bad reviews for this place I can't believe these people went to the same place we go to. Me and my wife and two sons go at least once a month and we have never had a bad experience. The beer is FANTASTIC the food is tasty and the atmosphere is hip but not over the top. I always get some sort of burger and their all great. My wife orders off the lite menu and swears by the avocado salad. My kids usually get burgers and fries as well and swear they are the best in EL Paso. The bill is always under 50 and my wife and I have a couple of beers with dinner so it would be even less for non drinkers. This is our go to place in El Paso and we not out of towners we live here.
Stephen S.,"El Paso, TX",0,1,,2.0,3/11/2015,"Used to be a favorite. Last two times service has been terrible. Waited at least twenty minutes to get served. Food finally came before the appetizers, waited for silverware. Ordered an extra beer with my meal that came after we were done. This is supposed to be their specialty. Might not be coming back. Sad."
Amanda S.,"Lufkin, TX",104,12,4,2.0,1/1/2015,"Meh. All of our food, appetizers and entrees, arrived at the same time, and then it took the wait staff 5 more minutes to bring utensils. Flatbread with all the pepperoni arrived so greasy that whatever crispness it had was completely ruined. The worst part: I  hate to confess this, but I actually sent the Mac n Cheese for my son back to the kitchen and ordered a different meal for him. The macaroni arrived to our table still in the rectangular shape used for the refrigerator/freezer packaging, and it was beyond leftover congealed. I know these things are reheated, but seriously, you can't even be bothered to stir and properly reheat the dish?? Very disappointed, even for a chain. I have had good experiences at other BJ Brewhouses, but can't say that I will be back to this location."
Jessica A.,"Minneapolis, MN",1200,710,870,3.0,10/16/2010,"After living in SoCal for 7 years, I've learned to like BJ's. I travel a lot, and don't necessarily like to eat at ""chains""... but BJ's is an exception! :)  Besides their pizookie dessert, they are known for their deep-dish pizza and ales.  But on to my experience... I arrived around 5, solo diner -- so headed to the bar area. Packed! In fact the entire restaurant was packed. (I found some parking behind the restaurant.) Happy Hour specials were: $1 off drafts (i believe) $1 off cocktails $2 off appetizers and some others i can't remember Not terribly hungry, and thinking I would save room for the pizookie, I ordered the BBQ chicken sliders with fries. OMG! They were huge... and very, very tasty! Needless to say, not enough room this time for dessert.  Great food experience.... but service fell short. I think my server in the bar area must have had too many tables personally.... Next time, I'll go and actually sit at the bar - -hopefully being in the bartenders face will give me a better experience.  Margaritas were good! :)"
