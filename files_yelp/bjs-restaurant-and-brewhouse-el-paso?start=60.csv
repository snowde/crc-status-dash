Jeannette M.,"El Paso, TX",0,8,5,1.0,7/23/2014,"The Service was EXTREMELY SLOW, although, the restaurant was NOT busy ... The baby back ribs were undercooked and super tough.. My second attempt.... There will not be a third..."
Tameka J.,"Wyncote, PA",7,119,,3.0,9/27/2015,"Popped in during happy hour after a long flight to El Paso.  Service was a bit slow at the bar, I think they were changing shifts when I arrived. It the menu at this place is like 10 pages and I'm always concerned when I see a large menu because they can't possibly do everything right.... I ordered the avocado egg rolls, they were surprisingly good but the sauce that came with them was waaaaayyyyy toooooo sweeeet! I also ordered the ribs with root beer bbq sauce, good try but the execution ,missed the mark.  The ribs were tender but the sauce had an artificial taste to it,thus making the entire dish unsuccessful. Ordered the Siracusa wings, they were tasty"
Nicole A.,"El Paso, TX",0,7,,5.0,11/5/2015,"The menu is huge, so pizza isn't the only great thing on the menu. However, the flat crust pizza is amazing. Also love their lighter meals with calorie count posted on the menu. Service is generally very good."
Ivan B.,"Tallahassee, FL",689,380,129,4.0,7/10/2012,"I really like this place. I came here with my dad just to try something new and it was actually nice. It reminds me of Yard House because of the whole brewery thing. I did not try a beer though. I ordered a pizza after seeing somebody else have it. That thing was so huge! I usually never have deep dish, but this one was so good! The place is kind of pricey though. The atmosphere is nice and good for groups to chill after work and watch some sports or chat. I want to come here again and try something new, definitely a beer too!"
Diane M.,"El Paso, TX",1,7,,2.0,10/25/2014,"We definitely would not return! Worst bartender ever! my husband ordered a makers mark and coke. We were told they ran out--this is at 6pm on a Friday. The waiter told us they had crown royal and woodford reserve. We love woodford reserve so we chose the latter. Then the waiter returned apologizing stating they didn't have that either. I ended up ordering a strawberry mojito and it was terrible. Completely watered down, absolutely not what it should have been. They must have been out of mint too but didn't tell me. We ordered water for the rest of the night and will not be returning. We live on the west side and it was not worth the drive."
Loren W.,"Vero Beach, FL",166,150,60,5.0,9/6/2014,Thrilled with the Parmesan crusted chicken. The Creamy garlic salad dressing was outstanding and the service was top notch. All around a great place!
Bob R.,"Trivoli, IL",0,20,,4.0,8/2/2014,"Wide menu, good food, nice selection and variety of beers. Cilantro lime scallops were pretty good for seafood in the desert. Friends had big burger and parm chicken, all very happy. Nice atmosphere. Service a bit slow/casual, but saw other servers hustling and attentive. I'll return, many things on the menu I'd like to try."
Seth M.,"Las Cruces, NM",2,4,,5.0,7/19/2014,This is one of my favorite restaurants. I have eaten here many times and not ONCE have I repeated an order. The food is always amazing and the staff is usually great as well. The food is great and they care about my mother's gluten allergies as well. Overall I would never tell anyone to NOT go to BJ's.
Taylor A.,"Atlanta, GA",145,640,45,4.0,10/5/2009,"Everyone likes BJ's. At least everyone in our group did. Yes, yes, we all know guys love BJ's (because of the beer selection), but surprisingly the two girls we were with loved BJ's too! Hopefully you're in El Paso for work, and don't actually live in this god-forsaken land, but either way BJs is a good place to have a nice meal. I was in EP for two weeks for work and this is the best place we went to. Very easy to get to as it's right off Highway 10. They have a tasty beer selection and an extensive menu with pizzas, burgers, and some great larger entrees. The atmosphere is like a classy lodge with a slight sports-bar tint. The seats at the bar are great for viewing games, and the other tables and booths are for a more refined dining experience. I had the parmesan chicken and it was crispy and juicy with great sides. Two other's got the BBq bacon pizza and were enjoyed. They brew their own beers. Ask for their seasonal selections as those are usually the best ones. At under $5 for a pint the price is right too. I just wished we found this place before wasting our time at Cattleman's."
Stephanie D.,"Louisville, KY",3,27,16,2.0,1/15/2012,The con? - Your average franchise with higher prices & better decor. The pro? - Plenty of tv's to watch your favorite match-up & a good beer selection.
Mike B.,"Southlake, TX",6,93,,3.0,8/19/2012,"Atmosphere was not great as staff was camped out in bar between shifts and being loud. Food, specificall the pork chops were excellent. Desert brownie was dried out and bland. The BJ's brand is usually excellent, however this location was average at best!"
Jake E.,"Claremore, OK",95,129,75,4.0,3/16/2014,"Have been to the ABQ and El Paso locations. Every time, the food was wonderful. If you visit them, a MUST HAVE is their Pizookie! It. Is. AWESOME. Cant wait to go back!"
Donald H.,"Killeen, TX",2,12,2,2.0,8/22/2013,"Nice looking place just like all their chain restaurants, bad service, our waitress was more worried about flirting with a co-worker than her job. All our food and drinks were slow to arrive.  Bj's really needs to step it up in all realms, even their new IPA needs a lot of work. Oh and if you call yourself a brewery you should make sure someone on your staff knows something about beer."
Marley B.,"Seattle, WA",23,92,2,4.0,12/15/2011,"Good local beer, awesome desserts, and a fun atmosphere!   When here on business trips, we tend to frequent this place both for casual lunches, after work drinks, and formal dinners with clients. It's vast menu and varied crowd make it appropriate for just about any occasion.   They have a great selection of brewed-in house beers, local favorites (including 3 different types of Shiner Bock! woo!), and a full bar with in-house specialty drinks. The food is consistently good- if you're undecided about what to get, the flatbread pizzas are delicious!  Be sure not to miss the Pizookie- their signature dessert. Meant to be shared, I devoured my entire one myself and didn't regret a second of the ooie-gooie chocolatey goodness.  Service is good as well. They're awesome about splitting checks (even with  big parties) and they seem to do a great job handling special requests.  The 6-screen tv in the bar area is awesome, but I wish they would choose a different news channel than Fox News.  I guess it's to be expected in Texas."
Jana T.,"Lorsch, Germany",94,94,16,1.0,6/2/2013,"A group of us went to the El Paso location on Friday night, 645pm. We were 7 and our waitress was Jennifer. Food was great. And that is where it stops for the good. The service was truly the worst I have ever seen there. It started with incorrect drink orders went on to extremely slow refills. We only had appetizers and wanted a few to go orders. I had asked for some balsamic vinaigrette for my flatbread. It took two reminders and 25 min to get it. By that time the flatbread was cold. While waiting, another waitress brought me some soup which I declined to receive because I wanted to finally eat the flatbread (still waiting remember) and did not want cold soup. The to go orders put in by separate waiters because Jennifer seemed totally overwhelmed. The manager came to us several times, saying he would see what was going on. When one lady in our party asked for a dessert, Jennifer wanted to bring us the checks before we had more drinks and dessert. Who does that? We declined saying we were not ready for the checks (you realize we said checks as in plural) and she insisted that it would be easier later. Really, who cares, make your system efficient and quit rushing us. By the time we were ready to leave, she forgot to put in another to go order and it took another 1 hour and 10 minutes for us to receive our checks. We finally left at 2145 after a few drinks and appetizers. When we told her now horrible the service was she slammed the pens on the table saying she can't do more than one thing at a time. The manager also made medicre attempts at remedying ghe situation. Jennifer never apologized knowing that her service was the worst ever and the manager told me that he had another waiter tell him that Jennifer would be in need of help with our group. I asked him why and he actually incenuated that we were problem customers because he thought we were a party who must have been there the week prior. I have no idea where he got that idea but it had been a good 5 months that I had visited BJs with any friends. Jennifer got zero tip from us because our dissatisfaction was purely based on her horrible service and the manager needs to get a check up for not making it right and making poor escuses."
Heather J.,"Des Moines, IA",130,563,259,4.0,10/26/2009,"BJ's is one of a very few food chain restaurants that I like and usually get good food and customer service at any location. I tried their new thai shrimp lettuce wraps...delicious and one of their flatbreads..again delicious.  I always get my standby wildberry cider, which lived up to my memories of times past.  I forgot that they also have some pretty decent mojitos as well, hopefully I will remember next time around."
Thomas B.,"San Antonio, TX",7,25,53,4.0,7/7/2014,My wife and I decided to try something new for dinner...BJ Restaurant & Brewhouse. Let me tell you the food was excellent and the service was great....the food came out in a reasonable time. Recommend for the entire family...adult and kid friendly environment!
Sean D.,"Lakewood, CA",8,5,,5.0,3/25/2014,"Great service and good food! Went with my wife and kids, kids food came out first like we requested, and everything was delicious! No problems with anything.  Drink menu is very versatile and have many different beers on tap, from their own brewed ones to other craft beer!  Little pricey but overall a good night out!"
Katrina M.,"Austin, TX",2,13,,2.0,12/13/2011,"Soup is cold and yuck!!!   The salad is also swimming in salad dressing!!  The staff was very sweet, but the food is aweful."
Erin M.,"Austin, TX",0,49,2,2.0,10/9/2013,"Food good for a chain, service and detail attention subpar. I gave this place another shot for takeout after the first couple orders were botched, and again, botched. Waited outside at 630 pm for 15 minutes when the food was promised to be ready when I arrived. Forgot utensils (hmmm... Out of towers order food to go?!), forgot dressing, pazookie was burnt, toppings for chili forgotten, egg rolls overdone. It's the little things in service which make a customer choose one restaurant over another, and this one makes me choose differently."
