Tina H.,"Tucson, AZ",4,11,54,1.0,9/4/2013,"Took an hour to get our drinks (2 Pepsi!), appetizer arrived after the dinner, food was edible, but not worth the 1hr wait to be seated & another hour to be served!  To top it off the waiter kept bring us the wrong bill! So another hour wait just to leave!!! Never going back there! :("
Christian M.,"El Paso, TX",5,20,4,4.0,1/6/2014,"The food was slow to arrive and when it finally did arrive mine didn't make it until quite a few more minutes later. But they made it right, I got a free dessert out of it. The food is always delicious and service has never been a problem."
Lia Z.,"Hickory Hills, IL",0,46,,5.0,2/9/2013,"My husband I have been here a few times and I love this place. Although its a chain restaurant I really do enjoy all the food they offer. Most of their prices are reasonable. I wouldn't suggest getting their sampler platter it was pretty skimpy for $18. If you ordered 3 appetizers separate I feel like you would get a better deal. My husband really enjoyed their ahi tuna little appetizer plate. Mac and cheese was ok, would not order again tho. Watermelon and feta salad is out of this world. I enjoyed their deep dish pizza, but that is because I'm from Chicago and don't really appreciate paper thin pizza. Their white chocolate almond raspberry pizooki is an absolute must! The coolest part of dinner was their rootbeer and cream soda served in a frosted mug, awesome and delicious!"
Misty E.,"Fort Worth, TX",31,22,26,5.0,10/14/2012,I love this place! I've only been here since Aug 15th and I've been there quite a few times. The regular margaritas on the rocks are great and the alcohol sneaks up on you lol. The food is outstanding. The full rack of ribs I was expecting to be something like chilis or cheddars but no...they were huge and hanging over the edge of the plate. The baked potatoes are huge. The desserts are delicious!!! They have smiley face fries for the kids and mac and chz too! The pizza here is great as well!!!
Nicholas V.,"El Paso, TX",10,115,5,4.0,9/24/2010,"Great beer selection and huge menu.  To me this place is great for someone that likes Applebees or Chili's but is looking for a little more variety.  You get the same chain comfort with a better atmosphere, food selection/quality, and a better bar."
Amanda G.,"El Paso, TX",12,45,87,1.0,7/5/2011,"Awful place...My husband and I walked in and the hostesses were engaged in conversation amongst themselves for 5 minutes before they even asked how Many people were in our party. We sat down at a dirty table, in uncomfortable seating/arrangements the waitress who took our drink order not only didn't come by until we were seated for 10 minutes but had someone else  bring our drink order, which was incorrect; after glancing at the menu for sometime and not seeing our server comeback to take our order we got up and left. I will never set foot into that restaurant ever again."
Jenna L.,"Florence, AZ",35,369,88,4.0,7/22/2010,"I have eaten at BJ's in CA and AZ, and this one is just as nice.  Location is kind of crazy to find on gateway in with a BUNCH of other restaurants/ shops.  Very nice building, plenty of parking.  Friendly staff at front of house and server.  Had Avacado Eggrolls, Mozzarella Sticks for apps.  Yum.   Small Caprese salad and mini Spinach and Artichoke pizza for dinner.  We all shared the Pizookie Trio for dessert.  OMG!  Yummy cookie flavors with ice cream on top.  We loved peanut butter cookie w/vanilla ice cream and the triple chocolate.  We also had the cookies and cream - good as well!  Between 8 of us we didn't finish them all! Microbrews good as other locations.  Overall, great experience!"
Ann G.,"Blythe, GA",1,267,1,4.0,3/27/2012,"I really, really like this place. Unfortunately my stomach tends to disagree with me. I'm SO FULL whenever we leave! I can barely get out the door. That may be because I can barely get in the door, but I digress. I usually order the broccoli soup in the bread bowl. They really should just break down and call it a broccoli cheese fondue. It's VERY thick and VERY cheesy, so if you're looking for a thin broccoli soup, go elsewhere. I've enjoyed everything I've had there, though, and we've been four or five times now. Service is sometimes a little on the slow side, but they're friendly!"
Ivan T.,"El Paso, TX",47,64,46,3.0,11/7/2013,"I have been to BJs on numerous occasions and have always enjoyed excellent, friendly service and delicious food. My favorite dishes to order are their pizza (Mediterranean is THE BEST) and their Parmesan Crusted Chicken. I recently tried their margaritas (Peach and Pomegranate) and they are delicious and fruity (they do not skimp on the liquor here, folks). My only problem with BJs is that during my last visit the waiter was rude to my partner and I towards the end. He all of sudden did not like that we asked for a split check. Also, he forgot to add the points of my check to my rewards card and was hard-faced when he said good bye to us at the end. Fortunately I spoke to the manager after the experience and he was very attentive, and assured me he would speak to the waiter. I am wanting to try out new, local places, so very likely I will not be back at BJs in a while for the sake of experiencing different restaurants. Avoid this place on weekends since it gets extra packed (sadly, it seems it's the ONLY trendy place here in EP, so everyone and their mother goes there for dinner on Fridays)."
Happy J.,"Glendale, AZ",17,192,15,1.0,3/23/2009,"The host, who was leaning over the reception desk, was on the telephone when we arrived. Our entrance wasn't acknowledged for several minutes to a point where my companion said if no one noticed us quickly we would leave. We decided at that moment to eat in the bar area. As soon as we started to walk to the bar, the host decided to get off the phone.  We escorted ourselves to the bar area and sat at a tall table. It took a few minutes for our server to greet us and even longer for our soft drinks to arrive. It was my friend's birthday, which I mentioned to our server. She had a blank look on her face and asked if we wanted an appetizer. Obviously, either she or the restaurant don't make a big deal about someone's birthday. We ordered the nachos as an appetizer and they had a strange taste and informed the server of this. She apologized but left the uneaten food on our table after taking our dinner order. When dinner arrived, our server took the uneaten nachos away. Portions were small and the taste was okay. We had to flag down a different person for drink refills. My companion noticed our server spent as much time texting on her phone as she did using the cash register. That was also a reason it took a while for us to get the final bill. Both of us were surprised to see the appetizer off the bill as our server never mentioned she would do this.  We had heard of BJ's Restaurant and had never visited one until this visit. Overall, we're not planning to visit this BJ's restaurant again."
Michael C.,"El Paso, TX",8,36,11,4.0,4/2/2012,"Well we did go at 3- pm on a monday which is not a busy time. Seating and food was prompt. Shrimp tacos, maybe there should have been a third taco?  There was a good amount of shrimp on each. The wife's fish and chips were good, hard to mess those up, really good sized portion. Atmosphere was nice, normal expected for a chain. It's way up on the hill so be ready for the El Paso wind."
Jenna W.,"Colorado Springs, CO",58,113,8,4.0,1/13/2012,"I was a little nervous to go here due to the previous reviews - I was not expecting much.  I went with a big group (reservations of course) and the service was very friendly, they were clearly prepared for us, and everyone seemed moderately pleased with their food.  I split the lettuce wraps with a girlfriend, as she had a fussy infant and we were not sure how long we would be able to hang,  The price was a little rediculous ($11 for an app? Of mostly lettuce? Hmm) but it was good- of course we ran out of insides long before we ran out of lettuce lol. I think it was a good venue for the event and I will be back, maybe not constantly, but I have not been scared off completely.  (it reminded me of Rock Bottom Brewery a little bit)"
Paula W.,"Hixson, TN",55,5,,5.0,2/10/2012,This is a great place for lunch.  They have a very nice gluten free menu.  The coffee is wonderful.
Rachel W.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,25,,3.0,1/12/2012,"Went back this past December for a quick bite to eat, sat at the bar and just went for a burger, keeping it simple this time and it turns out that's the way to go. Beer was still good, burger was good, fries were good.  It was still A-OK but now I have more confidence in their food and wouldn't hesitate to go back, whereas I was hesitant to go this time. Still wouldn't name a place BJ's...."
David R.,"Hot Springs, AR",28,511,195,5.0,11/21/2011,5 stars for Pumpkin Ale.  Food gets 3 stars.
Chris V.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",0,6,,4.0,6/26/2011,Came for lunch out of town work. Flatbread pizza and salad w pale ale. service is always awesome food very good huge menu
Richie P.,"Sugar Land, TX",1,14,14,4.0,2/19/2011,Food was excellent!  Appetizers were awesome!  Matter of fact you could just go there for the appetizers and be satisfied and full.  Deserts were excellent.  I will say the service was a bit slow due to a huge party that was going on.  Other than that that.  i highly recommend this restaurant.
josh e.,"El Paso, TX",16,13,,4.0,12/22/2010,"BJ is where we go if we're in a big party (15+).  Would definitely recommend for major events as the seating capacity is large.  Staff is usually well informed and courteous. Honestly of the 20+ times i've been to this location I don't think I've ever had a complaint... Peronal Faves: Miso Salmon, Parmesan Chicken, Chocolate Chip Pazookie and the Top Shelf Long Island!"
Jessica Y.,"Chicago, IL",31,254,24,4.0,1/21/2009,"Apparently there are BJ's Brewhouses in Dallas and Houston, but this is the only one I've ever been to and I had to put it on the ""yelp map."" The thing that put this meal over the top for me was the pizookie. Yeah, so it's a horrible name, but it might be the best dessert that ever hit my lips - and I dine with A LOT of people that love their dessert. The cookies and cream pizookie is out of this world. A huge chocolate oreo cookie with three scoops of vanilla ice cream and oreo flavored mouse a top. I'm a fan of under baked cookie, but this was in the same ballpark, with a much better texture - you have to try it!  Otherwise, I think the big draw of this place is the huge menu and the neighborhood atmosphere. My friends , the El Paso natives, tell me it's always busy at BJ's, and I can understand why. It's just a well thought out layout and an unpretentious atmosphere. There could be a few more TV's, but you can definitely go here with a group and have a great night.  About the menu, it seems like they are big on the pizza - Friends recommend the buffalo chicken, which I must admit is pretty darn good even though I'm not normally a fan of spicy food. There is also a great selection of salads (I had the BBQ chicken chopped - reminded me of CPK - another favorite!). There's also the standard appetizers, potato skins, nachos, etc. And a great mixed drink menu. Even though I didn't try the beer, I do know that, DUH, they brew their own. There's a lot of info on their brews on the website - they look like they are pretty serious about it!! On a side/slightly related note, I saw the Dallas location had a brew/food pairing night, maybe they have these in El Paso too?!? Another bonus on the location, there's a cute little shopping center surrounding it. If you live in El Paso, I'm probably not telling you anything you don't know. If you're just visiting, head to BJ's for a great meal and a fun night."
Rachel E.,"Springfield, MO",0,1,,5.0,7/21/2011,The service is sloooow BUT the avacado egg rolls are AMAZING!!!!!  Worth the wait!
