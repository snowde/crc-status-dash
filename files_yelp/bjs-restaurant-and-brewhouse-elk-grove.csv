Aya E.,"Sacramento, CA",415,217,423,4.0,12/17/2017,"My party of 4 and I stopped by for an early dinner around 4pm and it turned out to also be Happy Hour (3pm-6pm). You have to sit at/by the bar in order to buy from their Happy Hour menu. I started off with the calamari (~$12) as an appetizer. As my main dish, I got the BJ's Brewhouse Burger with fries ($6) + cheese ($1.50). The burger/fries combo is part of their Happy Hour and for $6, I must say it's a super good deal! I was also in the mood for a light drink so I went with the Kona Big Wave pint (~$6). Service was decent but the food was really good! It was definitely more of a comfort/cheat meal but it hit the spot, so I can't complain! BJ's is a good spot for large groups and because they have such a wide variety in their menu."
Jef T.,"Elk Grove, CA",4,1,2,2.0,12/31/2017,"I ordered the Chef's special on the menu and enjoyed the meal very much. However, come to realize that once my credit card charge was processed, that the waitress charge me more than I indicated. I am very disappointed with the level of integrity displayed. I did not speak with management as I did not want the miss to loose her job. But the temptation of extra tips is certainly an unjust action.  In sum, be wary and pay with cash."
Karli D.,"Elk Grove, CA",91,340,768,3.0,12/14/2017,"So, this restaurant is just a convenient place to eat at times simply because it is open late and they have craft beers.  I am not a huge fan of this chain restaurant but it hits the spot on occasions.  Usually I either get the chicken bacon ranch deep dish pizza or the chicken tortilla soup and house salad combination.  The staff is so-so and sometimes there is a long wait for a table (try to grab a spot in the bar area as it is open seating).  I do think the happy hour is decent and they also offer happy hour during all pro football games which is a major cost-saving plus.  Overall, just mediocre food and service."
Kali D.,"Elk Grove, CA",461,391,3860,2.0,8/27/2017,"Again I have tried so many times with BJ's but they always seem to fail us. I received an email advertising a 6 pound wing special for the Mayweather fight, for $28. I thought this was a great deal and I placed my order online. About an hour later I received a call from a manager at BJ's wondering when I want at the wings?? Well let me think... The next day when the fight is going to begin like I put in my order? She proceeded to tell me that the order was already made due to their error in the system, basically my order was the fourth one done this way. So she update my order to reflect the next day at 5:30 for curbside pick up and apologized. They donated all the orders to EGPD. Fast forward to the next day, we arrived at 5:30 on the dot and pulled up to the curbside space. I called the phone number to request they bring out my order, I was advised it would be a few minutes. OK we can wait but when our wait turned into over 10 minutes I started to get frustrated in 104 degree weather. I gave it another five minutes and hobbled my butt into BJ's. I was so pissed and hot that I think I let a cuss word fly out and demanded to speak to the manager. I explained how could you make a order the day before but you can't make the order on time today? Also all these folks are sitting curbside in these heat, that's not good for us or our cars. She apologized and said they were a bit overwhelmed and gave me $30 in BJ's gift cards. Basically my wings for free.  I'm only giving BJ's two stars instead of one because they donated the wings to our local police department and they did seem apologetic. Ugh!!!"
Shyelle S.,"Sacramento, CA",137,11,,1.0,1/9/2018,Had the worst service ever by Jacob. This waiter sucks. Not only is he super slow but he's rude. We ordered drinks and he was in another room eating pizza. Once our food came it was brought out by another lady and he didn't come check on our table once. Then at the end of our dinner we asked for drink refills boxes and he disappeared again. He finally came back to our table only to ask if we would like boxes. So he pretty much forgot about our refills too. I understand that when it's busy people can forget things and Im totally okay with that..but the restaurant was super slow today. When he gave us our check he threw it at our table. He was the worst waiter I've ever had and i will never return to this location thanks to him.
Lexie M.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,15,18,1.0,12/20/2017,"Ordered sliders with bacon and cheese and they came out the first time with no meat! I didn't want to be ""that"" person sending my food back while it was extremely busy but there was no hamburger! The server took it back and came out about 20-25 minutes later with another plate of sliders and I should have expected this for sending it back, I PULLED A HAIR OUT OF MY MOUTH ON THE FIRST BITE I TOOK. Didn't eat the rest of my food, the server took I back, and I didn't get to eat after waiting for a total of probably an hour and I had to pay for this ""meal""."
Jay K.,"Los Angeles, CA",231,315,569,4.0,6/7/2017,"I'm a fan of BJ's I can't help it. The experiences have ranged, sometimes the food is so overly fattening I've been left with a tummy ache and other times I've had really memorable experiences.  I came here for my brother's graduation and used the app they suggested to be put on a 'waitlist'. It's not really a reservation since you can't do that unless you have a party of 7 and over, but it's somewhat like priority seating?  Obviously being in a small town where the HS is from Elk Grove, a majority of the kids and families actually ended up back in EG at this BJ's. It was PACKED. Wow, I heard the waitress say the wait was upwards of an hour and thirty minutes, but because we had used the app around 8:00 and gotten to the restaurant around...9:40 (?) we were actually seated within about ten minutes. Parking was a hassle because of how busy it was, but normally it isn't.  Our waitress was great, super friendly and accommodating to my family. Major plus for her.  We started with calamari, which I unfortunately stayed away from because ya know diet. Meh. And then we also had the avocado egg rolls, which my mom and dad both love. They were pretty spicy, at least for me. Good though! I also had a virgin mint mojito, because no calamari but I will down a glass of simple syrup.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their food. I got one of what seems to be their newer bowls, it had salmon and quinoa in it with veggies. It was actually not bad! Loved the salmon and ended up pretty full. I didn't finish all of my salmon, but did some decent damage. The brother had his lovely spaghetti and chicken thing, mom had a burger, dad had a mushroom vegetarian burger thing and my aunts had dishes I didn't try and forgot about. The important part is, no one sent their food back and everyone was happy.  We ended the night with two chocolate chip pizookies. They have some sort of Wednesday deal where the original ones are half off. I didn't hear anything she said after that as I furiously decided which one I wanted to buy for 50% off. I'm glad we got two, we have the family members who just want a taste, but seem to consider half of a dessert 'just a taste'. Having two satisfied four people well.  Overall, great experience. It also helped that the atmosphere that night was exciting.  A lot of families celebrating graduations for their kids. While it wasn't our first option, I am glad things went well for us."
Kelly L.,"Sacramento, CA",303,50,96,3.0,5/19/2017,"I've been to BJ's countless times for all types of occasions. Just to eat, birthdays, dates with friends/SO, etc. However, I have been going less frequently because the service here is increasingly inconsistent. Sometimes the service is great, sometimes the service really sucks, like really sucks... This used to be the go-to spot for birthdays within my friend group but I'm really glad that we out grew that.   One of my favorite dishes here is the Southern Fried Chicken (pictured). I also really like their Jalapeno burger. Too bad they don't have the crispy thin fries anymore!!! (or that's what they told me last couple times I went, I'm heartbroken). And of course, who doesn't love their pizookies! I'm actually really craving one now that I'm thinking about it!   Those dishes are the main things that keep me coming back, but I usually just get all of those things to-go now a days to avoid the inconsistencies with this particular location. But BJ's as a whole is a good place for lunch/dinner. Be sure to sign up for the email/club. They often do buy one get one free entrees and free pizookies with purchase! So if you like BJ's, be sure to get on that. And on their rewards system! I always forget to tell them to add my points when I pay! Oh, another comment - I do like that they're open late. Sometimes I don't want to go for fast food but most restaurants are closed. So I've had a few late dinners here. So that's a plus."
A F.,"Sacramento, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/29/2017,"Went in for a quick bite around 8pm on 12/27/17 waited very long for my food was told almost 30 mins later by the waitress that my barbacoa tacos couldn't be made because they ran out of the ingredients(why did they take so long to tell me)???? to make matters worse the waitress still brought me the bill to pay for the drinks me and my gf ordered which should of been free to us as a courtesy due to their terrible service, I did not tip and I could of made a a rude remark but I am not that kind of person, I have had bad service in the past like overcooked or undercooked food but nothing  like this from BJs , this locations cooking abilities and services are decling which I have noticed over the years that I have been coming here, I will never return here again"
Ninarae N.,"Elk Grove, CA",448,187,201,1.0,4/5/2017,"i was extremely disappointed tonight by our server Dennis who complained to my friend that he didn't receive enough tip.  tip is optional, it's not required and a server should never complain about how much tip they receive. it's completely rude. we come here all the time and it totally put a damper on our night. hope management sees this."
Frankie X.,"Sacramento, CA",0,19,14,1.0,11/16/2017,Where is the minus stars review??  This is managed horribly. I called to order a couple of pizzas today about 440pm. The phone was answered quick enough but because it was for pick up I was transferred to a different phone. After waiting for about 5 minutes I hung up and called back. I explained what happened to the person who answered and she apologized and transferred me again.  OMG!!!! It happened again!!!  I'm so glad Chicago Fire is close by so they are the ones who will get my business.  I've been to many BJ Restaurants but I've got to sadly say that the service at BJ's in Elk Grove is HORRIBLE!!
Harvey K.,"East Bay, CA",4844,490,2799,4.0,3/8/2017,"I had a pretty good experience at this BJ's today. So a few of you know that I'm a basketball referee. For California high schools, their version of March Madness (state playoffs) is here. My crew was assigned to a game in the Sacramento area yesterday. Our original plan was to go to Stagecoach Restaurant for our pregame meal, but we arrived 15 minutes after their closing time. BJ's in Elk Grove became our backup plan at the suggestion of one of my crew mates.  This BJ's is located in a big shopping center right off the Laguna Boulevard exit of Highway 99.  We walked in at around 3:30pm and the restaurant was pretty empty. We were prompted greeted and seated by one of the hostesses. The interior was very clean and the design appeared very similar to other BJ's locations that I've been to.  One of the servers came by with menus and took our drink order. Since we were kind of in a hurry, we quickly ordered: - Broccoli Cheese Soup (small, $4.75) - Chicken Club Sandwich ($11.75) - Late Night Burger (Wednesday special, $10) - Hickory Brisket and Bacon Burger (Wednesday special, $10) - 2x Diet Pepsi ($2.95 each) - Root Beer ($3.25) Food didn't take too long to arrive. I had the brisket and bacon burger and it was pretty decent. The patty was cooked to a perfect medium and seasoned well. It was topped with chopped brisket and two strips of bacon. The light bun held together despite the heavy ingredients. The fries were crispy and delicious. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. My two partners liked their food as well. PQ, who had the broccoli cheese soup and Chicken Club Sandwich, told me both were very good. ES, who had the Late Night Burger, appeared to like his food as well. His burger came with a fried egg, bacon, and pepper jack cheese. A liberal amount of chile verde was also a part of the burger. ES told me he loved the sloppiness of the burger!   Service was very good. Two servers constantly checked on our needs and refilled our drinks. With T/T, the bill came out to $56. Not bad for three people! I'm usually not a big fan of chain restaurants but my experience at this BJ's today was a pretty good one. But with that said, it is unlikely I will return to this particular BJ's because I'm not from the area. BONUS MATERIAL: - Major credit cards accepted. - Large parking lot on site. - Daily specials available M-Th."
Nick S.,"Sacramento, CA",39,77,113,4.0,2/25/2017,"My go to place now for anything really late night in Elk Grove. We went here again last night an hour before closing on a Friday night and there was plenty of seating with the choice of the bar or booth. Though it had plenty of seats, it was still decently filled with people. Never really have to worry about parking since the lot is huge, unless you like to park close.  This night, service was great and the mixed drinks we got were awesome. We had gotten the strawberry freeze and a strawberry mojito. The freeze was sweet and yet the alcohol was a hit still. The mojito was also very good, could sit there and order a ton without realizing we would get drunk. I got my usual California chicken club which is always a hit for me. The chicken is moist and the avocado is fresh. I usually get extra sauce in the sandwich but this time it came with a perfect amount. The other order was the bj's house burger and was pretty good itself if you didn't want bacon or cheese. I'm only knocking a star down because the pizza hasn't been tasting as good as it used to be. The usual bbq chicken had very little flavor and chicken itself.  If you're looking for a late night place to eat in EG, this is probably one of the few places that's opened."
Pamela T.,"Sacramento, CA",8,18,,2.0,1/6/2018,"Always giving this location the benefit of the doubt but they always seem to fail me. Especially the hostesses.  Every. Single. Time. No acknowledgment. Nothing. Today in particular, boy and girl flirting in front of the waiting line. Food always takes forever to come out. Server always takes forever to get to us as we wait to put our order in. Menus are always sticky. Get your shit together BJ's."
Sabrina C.,"Sacramento, CA",22,2,1,1.0,10/2/2017,"We ordered an office lunch today since our office was extremely busy EVERYONE of the 8 people were disappointed.  I ordered a salad some of the lettuce was brown not too big a deal but the huge cobb salad came with 1oz of dressing for $13.25.  2 people ordered a half pizza salad combo and bj's staff LITERALLY THREW both the halfs in a box together which was for 2ppl whom got to pick out of the same box. Not fair having two hands in the same box trying to sort out the pieces that kinda had cheese on them. 1 person only received salad dressing btw.  (I was not able to include pictures, bj's should be ashamed) 1 person ordered a salad instead of fries with her order - was not received. Everyone else their food was cold including the fries, all also feel like the food quality was poor and ""day old at best"""
Francisca T.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,2,,1.0,12/30/2017,"Worst service on pick up today! Used curbside, called n the lady said she will be right out. After 20 minutes I called back n I offered to come in and she said yes because they're busy. Went inside n the cashier looked at me funny when I said it's curbside pick up n I told her I've been waiting n I was told to come in. She grabbed my pizza and said the other cashier had to ring me up (wth) I had to wait till the other cashier came back from the back. And worst...the pizza was cold. Ordered online at 539, picked up at 629. Why offered the service when you can't do it?"
Ad G.,"CA, CA",0,237,406,4.0,8/27/2017,"Went for lunch surprise they have a bunch menu. Glad I stuck-with my first thought lunch. In addition, the two guys next table order brunch and negative comments on their meals!!! My thought BJ's is not known for waffles, pancakes , bacon, eggs,...don't order!    My meal was good, pricey, and customer service was nice."
Winnie T.,"Novato, CA",358,485,2262,4.0,6/27/2017,"*Make a reservation! It was packed on a Sunday night *Great for couples, dates, small and big groups, family, friends, kids (kids menu with coloring pencils) *Large deep dish pizza can probably be enough for 5-6 small eaters *Prime rib for $27 all day Sunday, and Friday and Saturday evenings (includes 2 sides, soup or salad, pizookie of your choice!) *Bar area is seat yourself with the same menu Treated my family out for my mom's birthday! They have never been to a BJ's and I haven't been to this particular location. It's hard to find a dinner location that we haven't tried and that can accommodate of a group of 13. Our waitress, Kimberly, was awesome!! She was so patient and friendly. The restaurant itself was super busy, so our receving our food and trying to wave the waitress down took a while. She was always either serving, taking orders, or assisting customers. Give her a raise! I would definitely come back to this location because of the service I received from her. The meal took roughly 2 hours, which is a little too long for me. The five meat deep dish pizza was dish! The prime rib was tender and juice! + their own beer, perfectooo!"
Udochi M.,"Elk Grove, CA",3,4,62,1.0,11/19/2017,"I'm literally here at BJs right now and I reserved a table of 25 for my brothers surprise dinner and a table for two for my friend and I. Obviously I was taking my brother and I would not be there in time, but when my friend came to be seated she was greeted with attitude and disrespected. Luckily a nice waiter named Nadine came and attended her. We were then seated without any menus and a server. A nice waiter came and attended us and let us know that are server was LATE! We waited 45 minutes to be seated and to take our order. Right now I'm completely annoyed. To be continued..."
Michelle Z.,"West San Jose, San Jose, CA",52,42,106,4.0,11/3/2017,"Pizooki! That's what I always come here for. I really like that they have the trio because all of the pizookis are good so it's nice to get three different flavors. I used to not like the food here but as time went on, their menu had extremely improved so I wouldn't mind eating here. My favorite if I want to eat healthy is the shrimp quinoa bowl. It is citrusy and the sautéed red onions and mushrooms really brings the flavor out. The burgers are pretty good as well. They also have the best mozzarella sticks and are my favorite. See the below pictures."
Karrie M.,"Lodi, CA",0,1,,3.0,11/20/2017,"My friend and I go here more times then we can remember, we both work in the restaurant industry so we get that things happen and take a little longer than usual sometimes so we don't get to upset. The other night we went and asked to sit in Daniella's  section as she is our favorite server. The host that sat us must have been new because he sat next to her tables but not her section a male server picked us up, again we had no problems with this, a little irritated but nothing to nag on.  However the service we got from him was mediocre, we opened the silverware rolls we got and we have 2 forks but no knives, when we had asked for a knife it was not brought to us we got our drinks and he took our order, we got potstickers and sweet potato fries to begin with. Those took about 10-15 min to come out. The fries were cold, our drinks weren't refilled until our entree's came out so we were sitting with empty cups through out appetizer portion. Onto the entrees, my friend got the BJ's Favorite Pizza and I got the Honey Crisp Chicken Salad.  My friend loved his meal although again slightly cold, my salad had so much lettuce and only about 3 chicken strips, I had asked for no tomatoes or cucumbers but that was on the salad when it came out. The salad in it's self was good, the honey mustard dressing was so good.  When the check came my friend paid with card and I paid in cash. The server ran the card at the table then went to get my cash back from a register, and didn't come back for about 10 min.  Not the best service we've had but nothing to stop us from coming back just hoping we don't get that server again."
Tre M.,"Elk Grove, CA",1368,99,198,5.0,5/17/2017,"***************est.1978*************** Soooo... this was a last minute dinner suggestion from my wife who didn't really want to deal with the busyness of BJ's, but still wanted her fave from there. Happy wife, happy life= off to BJ's. As stated in my check-in, we decided to use their curbside to go service. ""Friendly, quick, and complete and accurate order"" is my wife's mini review of our experience tonight, and she's right. Though we usually eat in the restaurants dining room, we may have to use this to-go service on exhausting days, days when BJ's is ridiculously busy (most every day), or just to keep our sanity in a pretty loud restaurant. The next time I dine-in, I'll be sure to capture pics. Overall, the service here has always been stellar, both for to-go and dine-in. I suppose that your feelings about any establishment can be affected by how good or bad the employees service is. Today, the service was outstanding! Support local Elk Grove businesses, small and chain alike."
Dimondz Y.,"Southeastern Sacramento, Sacramento, CA",22,4,1,1.0,12/20/2017,"So disappointed, so came here for a company dinner had three waitresses and still was horrible services. Some coworkers didnt even get their food. Though who ordered first were served last. Three hours just to get food. Than our waiters forgot items and mixed orders up. Manager was supposed to come out and talk with us and never did. Definitely will not be back."
Yousaf Z.,"West Sacramento, CA",154,36,80,5.0,6/29/2017,Always a good time!  I've been here on multiple occasions and its been great every time! the service is great and the food is even better. the wait time could be a little excessive at times but its well worth the wait. As always try the Pizooki! Enjoy!
Aisha S.,"Sacramento, CA",0,2,,3.0,12/19/2017,"VERY GOOD HAPPY HOUR ! Also 1$ Long Island all month of December. Server Jess was horrible and unorganized we literally sat her like 5/7 minutes and never even asked us what we wanted to drink. So by time she came over for the drinks we knew what we wanted to eat also.  Food comes out they also have really good appetizers but, JESS never came and asked how are food was. I work at restaurant also so I know how I get when I get busy but, she only had 4 tables in her section. Also she checked on the table behind us and in front but never us once but when are food was almost gone. I had to get up and ask the host for  another drink ! HAPPY HOUR GETS 5 star jess 1  star."
B F.,"Burlingame, CA",0,5,1,4.0,8/11/2017,Had a night out with the family. Greeted promptly and politely. Seated within 20 min. This was about 5 PM on a Friday night.  Server was prompt and polite. They were able to accommodate our requests and our food came out promptly.  Had one small problem with the fries that were brought out.  They were cold. I politely let or server know and she took the cold ones away and brought out hot and crisp ones.  Had a good time. Will definitely go back.  PS We really enjoyed the avocado egg rolls!
Jason J.,"Sacramento, CA",239,143,194,2.0,9/17/2017,"I rarely ever write a bad review but my recent experience at BJ's was awful. It started once me and my family walked in. There were a several people waiting in front for a table, it was safe to assume the hostess was trying to figure out where they were going to accommodate them on the floor since it was a larger party, but all I ask is to be acknowledged. Luckily once everything was sorted out, she was able to take us to a table and apologized for the wait. Once we sat down, our server greets us a few minutes later. He grabs us water while we look through the menu, and everything seems like it's going pretty smoothly. Side note: we arrived at 11 with a movie at 12:10, which is down the street, and we already lurched tickets with assigned seating.  We put in our order a few minutes later and patiently waited. BJ's is notorious for the long wait for food, but I've accepted that and enjoy the food. I was looking looking around and realized that everyone was getting their beverages and food way before us and we sat down and ordered several minutes before. I ordered a Bloody Mary, and probably wouldn't have received it if I didn't remind our server, because I don't think it takes 30 minutes to make a cocktail. I honestly think our server forgot to input our order and it didn't help the situation that he was completely ignoring us. If the kitchen is backed up, or you forgot to put in our order - whatever - let us know what's going on! I've never walked out of a restaurant in my life, but that experience was not acceptable. We left $10 to cover my Bloody Mary and left. Tip: COMMUNICATE"
Andrew H.,"Elk Grove, CA",36,73,58,1.0,3/10/2017,"Blown out! Wait times are awful. Hostess is rude. Service is slow. Incredibly slow. Everyone here is overworked and doing three peoples job, and because of this, they constantly mess things up.  Food is just ehhh. It's better than boiled cat food. Probably not worth the wait, but hey there's a wait... so someone likes it... so maybe if I drank thirty or so beers it would make up for the wait, bad service, and sub-par food.  Couldn't find the manager. Probably lost in the back somewhere trying to figure out how they failed so miserably in the food service industry."
Melissa C.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,66,48,2.0,9/18/2017,"SERVICE: It's usually a hit or miss... never consistent. We don't dine in anymore because of the long wait... to get seated, to order, to get drinks and food, everything is a long wait so we just avoid that by ordering take out. Even when ordering take out, there is no consistency.  FOOD: We ordered take out twice in a two week period because we were given a gift card. Both times I ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken and a Burger but had two very different experiences.  Parmesan Crusted Chicken: The first time, the chicken was cooked perfectly and came with a side of their lemon Chardonnay butter sauce to top it off with. The second time, the chicken was burnt and I couldn't even finish it because of the nasty burnt taste. Maybe if they had given me a side of the lemon Chardonnay sauce that it's supposed to come with but had forgotten to give me this time, I could have possibly covered up that nasty taste but it's not likely that it would have helped. Burger: We ordered a different burger both times and they were average. Again, both times the burger tasted burnt even though we requested they be cooked medium well.  Oh well, I didn't really have high expectations so I'm not too disappointed but it is frustrating to pay for overpriced unappetizing food."
Byron M.,"Rocklin, CA",3,24,11,2.0,9/21/2017,Called for a to go salad.  Ordered the Chkn Derby Club.   Got back to office.  Looked picture perfect until I uncovered the top layer.  Discovered old brown moldy salad and the salad core.   See pics so sad!!
S C.,"Elk Grove, CA",1,27,8,5.0,9/30/2017,"I dont know why most BJ's are always around 3 stars. We ordered: Strawberry Lemonade (Beverages) - Way better than just the plain lemonade. Lemonade (Beverages) New Peruvian Quinoa Bowl (BJ's Enlightened Entrées) With Salmon Build Your Own Pizza (9"") Classic Topping Options (Small): Pepperoni  The meal was perfect! We ordered from door dash around 11pm and received it around or before midnight."
Shelby C.,"Elk Grove, CA",453,18,33,5.0,11/11/2017,"Before reading my review, I want to give a disclaimer that I have been here so many times I've lost count. I've had both good, bad, and great experiences. Today was a GREAT experience. Today we came here to celebrate Veteran's Day. We were a party of 6 with 3 children (7, 8 & 13), 2 adults (myself and my boyfriend) and a senior (my boyfriends father). Both my boyfriend and his father served for our country, and seeing as though BJ's has had the ""Buy a Hero a Beer"" campaign along with today's Veteran's Day special, I thought it appropriate to bring him here because there is always something good on the menu for everyone. When we came here, I had initially called 1.5 hours before we arrived to put our family on the call ahead list. When we arrived however, we were NOT on the list. I initially got a little flustered and upset, because there was a lot of people waiting and I didn't want to make our family wait a tremendously long time. I showed the hostess my call log on my phone that showed my phone call to the restaurant, and the duration of the call so it shows I was on for a couple minutes. She went ahead and accommodated us and placed us on top of the wait list so that our wait time would cut in half. Fortunately, the wait ended up being even shorter. We were walked to our table and sat properly. The only thing that I should've suggested to the hostess was to try and find a table a little closer to the front so my boyfriends father wouldn't have to walk very far (he has trouble walking far distances or standing for long periods of time). As we were seated, we were greeted within about 30 seconds of sitting down by our server Kristiane J. She has served us before and was very sweet. She took our drink order immediately, and was patient even when myself and a couple of the kids were hesitant in placing our drink order. She came back with all of our drinks, which filled up an entire tray because my boyfriend and I asked for water on top of our beverages. I know how difficult and stressful it can be working in a busy restaurant and making a trip with a heavy tray. She also did great and remembering who got what drink, then kindly took our food order. My boyfriend and I ordered the boneless wing appetizer with the root beer glaze and Nashville hot sauce. Both were AMAZING, and the Nashville ones were AMAZINGLY PERFECT! I seriously love that flavor and so did my boyfriend. They were perfectly battered and filled with a good amount of white meat. I was extremely happy with this dish and look forward to having it again. For our entrees, my boyfriend and his father ordered the Mandarin Orange Porkchops, our oldest ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger, and our 8 year old ordered the kids Mac and cheese with fries. I ordered the sirloin with asparagus and white cheddar mash potatoes. The food took a little while to come out, but not so long that we were getting upset or concerned. Our waitress did an amazing job updating us about the status of our food, and even triple checked when she walked by and noticed nobody and brought us our food yet. The only issue we had was with my sirloin, which I ordered medium-well. When it was first brought out, it was OVER well-done. We could tell immediately before I even cut it open. I was honestly not going to bother sending it back, because I've worked in the restaurant industry before and I know how sending food back can frustrate the flow of the restaurant or the servers and cooks. However, the food runner insisted I ""get what I am paying for"" and kindly took my dish back. When it was brought back out later by Kristiane, it was actually at a medium-rare level, and had to be sent back again. I FELT TERRIBLE and I told her that. She said no, please don't worry. You deserve to get what you paid for. She ran my food back, came back within a few minutes, and the steak was cooked was a good well-done level. I wasn't going to fuss anymore (I was hungry too), so even though I wanted a hint of pink it was still good enough that I could eat it (the first time it came out, the steak was extremely dry).  Kristiane also went out of her way to check for another promotion to honor my boyfriend and his father, in which vets receive a free dessert for having the BJs app on their phone. She also checked on our food regularly, refilled our drinks at the perfect time, and got us boxes so we could take leftovers home. While my son was boxing up his food, he dropped most of his fries on the floor and she insisted to get us some fresh fries to replace the ones he dropped. I was truly happy with her exceptional service, and it made for a great day especially to have a nice day out for Veterans Day with our two vets. I look forward to having her again as our server, and truly recommend Bfs for anyone because there is always something for anyone with their versatile menu."

Ryan V.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,10,1,1.0,12/6/2017,"Ordered the bacon guac burger and best beginnings. Was told 20 mins for the food to be ready for pick up and got there a few minutes after that. Order wasn't ready for another 30 mins. Took 50 mins to get my food done. Mozzarella sticks were fried too long all the cheese was gone, food was cold and the avocado was sour.  Was told my order was held up by the artichoke dip.....worst excuse since that's a appetizer item. Usually like BJ's Restaurant but they did horrible this go around."
Gail P.,"Sacramento, CA",71,35,6,1.0,11/17/2017,"I just ordered the schrimp pasta plate for 17$ and it was terrible. Pasta was cold, schrimp was dry and the sauce was not on point! I literally could have made that plate at home for 3$ I feel like I just got ripped off."
Butterscotch B.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,20,45,3.0,2/14/2017,"Chicken Peanut soba noodle was savory and tasty. It was beyond what I though would taste like Pad Thai. Chicken pieces  in the dish were flavorful, tender and moist. The flavor saltier from soy sauce, not too sugary, and hint of tabasco kick. Would recommend this over the Peruvian Salmon quinoa rice dish  I had-Salmon was bland. Ordered big kid's meal -chicken Alfredo pasta, came with steamed broccoli and garlic knot bread. Hefty portion and worth the $6.95, came with 10 Oz of milk. My son ate more than half while the rest my hubby finished."
Victoria D.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,20,1,2.0,11/20/2017,"Don't order to go. We were told our order would be ready at 6pm, still hadn't received our food by 6:45. Food was cold and some items forgotten, so we had to return for those items."
Dan H.,"Sacramento, CA",1,10,5,4.0,6/20/2017,Nothing special about another corporate restaurant.  But we came for happy hour and sat at the bar area.  Food was fresh and good this time.  The server made a difference.  He was very nice and attentive.  The Jeremiah red draft beer did not disappoint.  Be back to drink more.
Vicky B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",641,446,1327,4.0,7/11/2016,"I'm not a chain person, unless it's a quick salad from Rubio's or CPK but will say I had one delicious dish this evening.  Gosh I haven't been to BJ's in years, landed in Sacramento late and needed food, I myself would have picked up a quick salad from trader joes or whole foods but had a hungry guy with me also.  We looked at what was open and Mimi's Cafe popped up, as we excited the freeway, we immediately got in the lane to turn left into BJ's. We immediately received a beer & a wine, I had the Pinot noir and it was delicious, my boss had an interesting IPA which was being featured which he said was good.  A few appetizers looked delish, especially the Brussel spouts and the ahi tuna but we were both so tired, we went straight for the mains.  Funny after flipping through a bible sized menu, we both decided upon the same dish so 2 mahi mahi & shrimp dishes it was.  I can't remember the exact name but it was mahi mahi, shrimp, coucous & tomatoes in a delicious yet light broth.  The meal was perfect sized, I didn't leave hungry or full, just satisfied. I travel a lot for work and I'm constantly eating out and needed new places to add to the list and now I have a new spot and dish!"
