Zaheem B.,"Elk Grove, CA",104,204,178,1.0,10/3/2015,"This restaurant taken a fat dump in the past few years. I've been eating at this place since it opened, and I used to enjoy every experience. Now it is quite normal to have an order messed up and be told incorrect wait times. It's seems like a lack of leadership, proper training and experience are to blame. The last time we visited, my sister ordered a vegetarian version of a chicken sandwich. My sister does not eat meat at all, but she was almost finished with the sandwich when she realized they did not take the bacon off the sandwich. We told the manager (Vanessa) about the mishap. We were not looking for the item to be taken off the bill, since the majority of it was eaten, but what would have been sufficient is a simple apology. Instead we received an explanation on how we were at fault."
Beverly B.,"Wilton, CA",10,68,54,5.0,4/12/2016,The rib eye has to be the most juicy amazing steak I have had..I have to say my taste buds were in shock..really a brew house with amazing favor steak you can cut with a fork...yes...no kidding...then to top it off add my hubz getting his rib fix..he order a full rack and hoped for decent ribs..what he got was pure magic falling off the bone heavenly bliss..seriously we eat for more than feeding our body..feed your taste buds and soul. If your eyes don't roll back in your head it ain't worth eating...just sayin
Phillip K.,"Kamiah, ID",2,118,51,3.0,6/26/2016,"Excellent food and friendly staff, but took waaaayyyyy to long to get a burger!?!?  Over an hour. My wife got a salad and it was 2nd to last out to the table. Wow.  Almost 2 hour visit for lunch. Otherwise would've rated 4.5 stars."
VeeVee N.,"Fresno, CA",60,624,11973,3.0,6/9/2014,"Came here on a busy Friday night w/ a large group. The wait time was long, but expected. We arrived at 6pm and weren't seated till a little after 730pm.  We were seated, but it took a minute for them to figure out who our server was going to be. A girl in our party was noticed by an old friend of hers, who was a server, and he offered to get us started. With our large party it took a while to get our drinks. We tried some 'hand crafted' soft drinks like Root Beer and Cherry something or other. I took a few drinks of my Cherry drink, but it tasted like it was made w/ a sweetener. I do not like artificial sweeteners, so I asked him if I could have a Pepsi because I did not like the sweet after taste of this drink. He came back w/ the same drink!!! He thought there was something wrong w/ the drink and that I just wanted a new one. My regular pepsi did not come out till I was almost finished w/ my meal. We ordered 3 apps...mozzarella sticks, and some boneless buffalo wings in Maui Sweet & Garlic Parmesan. We ordered these two flavors cause there were kids in our party and didn't want anything spicy. We were very disappointed when we bit into the Maui Sweet and found they were incredibly spicy, even for the adults. What was even more disappointing is that on their menu it states that the boneless wings are served w/ 10pcs...however we only received 5-6 pcs. Our appetizers came out at separate times, our waiter comped one of them because it was so late...just came out right before we got our dessert. The mozzarella sticks are not bad, but they aren't good either. They are way different from the traditional fried mozzarella that most people are used to getting. The breading was strange and had ZERO flavor at all. The only thing that made it edible was drowning it in Marinara sauce.  The boneless wings were good, had a nice flavor, crunch an the chicken was good. The only bad thing was that they were waaaay too hot to enjoy. I cant really do hot stuff, but others in our party that do even complained about how hot they were. Didnt get a chance to try to Garlic Parmesan since they brought them out just right before dessert. Service in between was hit and miss. There was also the earlier confusion of not having a designated waiter, and the kid that had been helping us was apparently not supposed to and so 2 managers came out and scolded him right behind our table. I think that was tacky on their part, there is a reason why they have an office or seperate place in the back...hell, go yell at him in the kitchen. Shame on the management though for not having a designated server for us. This boy tried to help us when he saw that nobody else was...so kudos to him. I felt bad cause he worked so hard, and then another person came in and took over...I hope she split the tip w/ him. Our food came out an everything looked delicious. I ordered the mini Chicken, Bacon, Ranch deep dish pizza. I am no longer going to order pizza from here, unless it is the regular hand tossed variety. Their deep dish is a joke. Basically you are praying for a disc of bread sprinkled w/ a few toppings...totally not worth it. The tomatoes that were on top were like the ones that you would get from taco bell, there was barely and bacon or ranch. I asked for an extra side of ranch because there was no detectable amount on my pie, and I never received it. It was a waste of almost $11 for a giant loaf of bread...NEVER A G A I N!!! Another person in our party ordered the Balsamic Glazed Chicken and it was so delicious!!! They were served on white cheddar mashed potatoes, although you couldnt really taste the 'cheddar' at all. The chicken was cooked to perfection and the crispy onion strings on top were a nice touch. The plate was very aesthetically pleasin and almost looked too good to eat. I wish I would have chose this as my entree on this visit...I def will next time. For dessert we had the Peanut Butter Pazookie. I think I am also going to hang it up where this is concerned. The Pazookie always takes longer than the other desserts, but every time I order one it comes out w/ some parts undercooked. I have maybe had it one or two times where it was fully cooked. I just don't like biting into what's supposed to be a cookie, and end up pretty much eating cookie dough. The flavor is not bad, but probably wont be something I order again. The girl who stepped in to help us really brought her best game and had no problems. I think the management really needs to step up their game and get their teams organized, thats what they are getting paid extra for. I think one of them should have at least apologized to our table...they were already there chewing the one server out, so why not say 'Hey folks, sorry for the trouble...' I mean our party spent almost $300 there. The food here is typically good and there are plenty of choices #flagproof"
Gary Y.,"Castro Valley, CA",63,31,1,2.0,7/6/2016,"I had never had above average experience with BJ's and this is again a server problem. The chain really needs to focus on server training.  This time we get a friendly server but gets our order wrong multiple times, forgetting what we ordered or put in a wrong side order."
Dave S.,"Elk Grove, CA",89,20,32,5.0,11/1/2015,We had lettuce wraps for the appetizers. Baca tacos and the Ahi Tuna salad for the main course. Everything was superb. The service is always excellent even when they are slammed. Keep up the great work !
Terri H.,"Elk Grove, CA",77,13,,4.0,2/10/2017,"We love BJs in EG for its casual, family atmosphere and many fun food and beverage choices. We can also catch a game on one of the large screen TVs. The trick is to get there just before 5 p.m. on a Fri or Sat to get a good seat and quicker service. The pazookie cookie is the bomb!!"
Christina H.,"Elk Grove, CA",92,57,41,5.0,9/22/2016,Today was very nice. We had happy hour in the bar. Our server was Kim. We have had her wait on us a couple of times before. She's so sweet & always makes us happy. The food was yummy too!
Anna T.,"Sacramento, CA",31,16,3,1.0,5/30/2017,"WORST SERVICE IN MY LIFE. Waited 10 mins at the front and the hostest NEVER showed up. We saw at least 5 or 6 workers walk right past by us and not one person acknowledged us. Finally, my fiance called the to go order number (he actually got a hold of someone!) and told the person on the phone that we've been waiting to get seated. The person my fiance spoke to hung up the phone and rushed to us right away, but at this point I was pissed AF so I wasn't going to eat there anymore. But before I left I asked to speak to the manager who, believe or not, was standing across from us the while fucking time!!! This bitch couldn't  careless about what I had to say... she was all like ""ohh sorry, I'll talk to my team about this."" I was like we'll you better look at the mirror and talk to yourself too because you are just as bad. I saw you looking over at us and you didn't say one thing to us either. She knows I just busted her out & apologizes more and says she had a crazy to go order to deal with and blah blah blah. Anyways, I don't want to be ""one of those people"" but I really do think it was a race thing. The staff was primarily white and my fiance and I are Asian. I don't ever really feel like I've been mistreated because of my race, but I do think sometimes people look at Asains as ""pushovers,"" like they aren't gonna speak up, well not today bitch, not today! Never coming here ever again."
Tabassum L.,"Sacramento, CA",4,66,,3.0,6/8/2016,This was the first BJ's Restaurant Location that I tried. I had gotten a Shrimp Taco which was ok. The Pazookie like always is very delicious!  The reason I give a 3 star is because I am not very fond of their food so it's not really a Restaurant that I crave for.
Cathy P.,"Jackson, CA",28,1,,1.0,1/28/2017,"First of all, waitress forgot my sides... when I let her know , she just offered to put it to go .. since she can't take it out of my bill since is a s de dish of my meal.. and my husband baby back ribs were extremely dry with a drizzle of bbq"
Aimee D.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,2,,5.0,12/19/2016,"The food was very good, I recommend the Cajun Jambalaya. Honestly the food here isn't always satisfying but I would agree that the time and day of the week of which you go determines how well the food may be. Visit today was satisfying."
Anthony B.,"Elk Grove, CA",1,40,1,2.0,10/16/2016,"Every time my wife wants to go here I cringe. The service is hit and miss. The food and drinks are pretty standard but you can really loose a whole night just by stopping in to eat. Wait is not worth what you get and when you try and sit in the bar area you can get over looked. The strange thing is, you can go at lunch or an off time when it is not so busy and still get hit and miss service. I never choose to eat there, but if the wife chooses to, so be it."
Sean S.,"Sacramento, CA",0,11,1,2.0,7/20/2017,"Haven't been here for years, tonight the family decided they wanted to eat here. The waitress we got was a bit ""Lost""at times but that wasn't the problem. I ordered the classic ribeye med-rare and it came well done. That was couple cook beyond what I'd asked for. Worse part was, they tried to kill me with salt ""overdose""! It seems as they took all the salt from the salt farm and put it on my plate. So  I asked for new steak to be cooked med-rare and no salt on my food. After 10min later I got my new plate of food, this time I didn't have to worry about dying from salt Overdose, but damn the steak was nasty enough to make me loose my appetite. They took a frozen steak, dipped it boiling water and threw it on the grill for a minute. You can see the whiteness from being boiled and you can taste the water squirting out as you chew. I made a mental note to self, "" Never order steak from this place again if I'd ever come back!"" Eat at your own RISK!!!"
Cheryl D.,"Stockton, CA",51,30,,3.0,1/22/2017,"Three stars because service by Vanessa was excellent!! However, food was not the best. My husband's ""new"" chile verde burger had too much bread, not enough filler; and my turkey burger had no lettuce (seems a basic ingredient for a burger). Also the gluten-free bun was falling apart. Red Robin has better GF buns."
Venus V.,"Long Beach, CA",0,8,6,1.0,7/2/2017,"I was in town on vacation and my partner and I decided to grab a late dinner. The wait time was short and food was great as usual. However I was really disappointed in this specific locations customer service. I myself work in customer service and I know what is expected. It was busy and our server had a table of about 20 people however he prioritized that table and left his other two (we were one of them) unattended. When he had a chance to take our order he never introduced himself and was very rushed. I had to ask another server in the area to bring a dressing to us and she did so very quickly which was very much appreciated. One other thing was hearing him murmur under his breath how he was ""so fu***** ready to quit."" It took him about 20+ min to check back and when he asked if anything else was needed I stated I had asked another server for it yet he decided to bring the dressing and finally act like our server. He then again returned to ask if we were interested in dessert when we stated no he ran off while I was asking him to please bring the bill. This was one of the rudest experiences I've had at a BJ's restaurant. We currently have been waiting  for about 30 minutes for the bill to be brought."
Nancy M.,"Sacramento, CA",34,12,,5.0,6/30/2017,I give 5 stars to the waitress Vanessa. She was so sweet and so attentive. She got shorted by another customer so we gave her a big tip and she tried to give some of it back...said we made a mistake. She deserves more than 5 stars in my book!! The food was good too :)
Brock B.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,1,,4.0,1/15/2017,"I do not know what the policy for getting a hair in food here is but i was pretty sad at the service i recieved after i found one in my food. my server was a nice guy so ill give this review 2 stars but all i was asked is if i wanted it remade, which i did not really want. Then i got the bill and it was full price and the server said i promise this one doesnt have one of my hairs in it. Will not be eating here again but i will probably go for the beers because they are good for that. Edit: changed to 4 stars for quick response and professionalism from brandon in resolving the issue. Very much appreciated."
tina w.,"Sacramento, CA",319,36,189,5.0,3/24/2015,Whenever we come we sit in the bar area! In SARAH'S section. She is definitely one of the reasons we keep coming back. She's always out going friendly and remembers all our drink orders. To top it off she even  knows my BJ's card number by heart!  Our bill normally is 70% drinks haha so we keep her busy. Thank you Sarah!
Sakura V.,"Sacramento, CA",68,9,1,5.0,12/4/2016,Went there last night at after work for a bite and drink with my coworkers. I think we were the last table for the server. His name was Douglas. He was an amazing server. Ordered my drink from him and got it just like that. I'm a regular there and I never get fast service like that. All of our food came out quick too. So we gave him extra tips. One of the best server. Ask for him.
