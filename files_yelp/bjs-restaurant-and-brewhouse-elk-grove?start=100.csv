Mady N.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",8,27,8,1.0,10/29/2017,"Kind of disappointed because the service here used to be good. My fiance and I was meeting family for a late dinner around 830pm. Our party arrived before we did but when we told them were meeting for a bday party the host told us they were in the back. I thought a hostess walks their guests to the table ? She just pointed and told us to make a right. We sat down and our waitress seemed really rushed to get our orders. About 10 minutes after we had ordered she gave us our bill and asks if we could take care of it. We didnt even get our food yet! I didnt pay until i ate. We ordered 2 burgers with sweet potato fries. Both orders came out at the same time and our waitress apologized to us and said ""they will bring out another side of fries"" i had a burger fries on my plate and my fiance's plate had a burger and ONE french fry! (Kind of disrespectful) a new batch of fries came ojt 10 minutes after, but we had already had enough. The waitress never came back for a water refill after asking her. Everytime i tried to talk to her she seem to walk in another direction as if she didnt want to listen. The only thing i enjoyed was the company of my family."
Ben A.,"Elk Grove, CA",88,1,,1.0,9/1/2017,"Quite possibly the worst service I've ever had. I've been here multiple times and the bartenders always treat you as if you are simply money to them, always chatting behind the bar and checking their phones instead of serving you or other people at the bar. I've waited 5 minutes plus with an empty glass. Multiple times have I ordered a pizza and it has come out with the wrong toppings (an hour after I ordered) to be sent back and have me leave the bar because I'm not going to wait another hour to get a pizza.  The food is good, don't get me wrong, it's not great. that's why I come here, but because the service is TERRIBLE, I will not be coming to this location any more."
Kim F.,"Roseville, CA",253,70,77,4.0,1/15/2017,"Great place to watch a game, enjoy tasty food and sip yummy cocktails. The wait staff is very attentive to ensure your food is to your liking and your beverage glasses are never left empty until you say no more."
Blake L.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,5,,5.0,8/16/2017,"I've never had a problem with this place when coming to eat here. The service has always been on par and they don't take to long for service considering how packed it is 24/7, the food here is great, every item on the menu is good, you could get everything and won't be disappointed, I like getting the pasta in the metal bowl and that's really rich and creamy"
Tom M.,"Penryn, CA",0,7,,5.0,11/2/2017,"We came here after a long day of soccer.  Our wait was not long and we were quickly greeted by our waiter, Michael.  He got us our drinks and the nachos were soon at our table.  Everybody liked their food, but the best part was Michael.  I honestly think he was the best waiter we have ever had.  He went out of his way to make sure we had everything we needed and made a point to actually talk to us.  He was polite and friendly.  At the end of the meal he even shook our hands before we left.  I was so impressed by his kindness and it definitely made for a nice meal.  Great job Michael!!!"
Deepika V.,"Sacramento, CA",0,2,,1.0,11/8/2017,"The food was ok,  but the service not. We were seated then forgotten. Our server left her shift and didn't notify another server to cover our table. We weren't even asked to be served any drinks. Other customers were being seated and served around us,  but no server thought to even ask why our table was empty. Eventually my friend had to get up and go find a server to ask that our orders be taken."
Shayn A.,"Sacramento, CA",33,58,5,5.0,6/18/2017,"I love BJs and especially the one in Elk Grove. We usually go at least once or twice a month. Their rewards program is one of the best around. I always use the preferred wait list via the app. and it is so much less of a wait than what one may usually experience when just walking in. I went to the one at Arden Fair on Thursday and it is not nearly as good as Elk Grove. Food is consistent and always tasty. Menu is extensive with lots of choices. Service can be hit or miss, but last night we had our best server ever at BJs, Stacey! Stacey was fantastic. She was a great combo, she got us everything we needed, was attentive,  made conversation (but not too much conversation), and always anticipated our needs. She was like one of the family! She made my daughter's pre-14th birthday dinner/pre-father's day dinner so awesome."
Hoang L.,"Sacramento, CA",42,3,3,1.0,8/20/2017,"Tonight I had the worst experience at a restaurant that me and my wife love! Our server Nick took our order for drinks and appetizers, and never came back to take our entrees order. After 30mins of waiting for him to come to take our order, he finally came and ask us is everything ok. And left again, seem like he was more worry about his other table. Me and my wife decided to leave so we can go somewhere else to eat, because we were hungry.  We wanted our ticket which took another 20mins to get. I wanted to pay the bill at the front counter so we can leave.  Nick was being rude and said we had to give him the ticket only. Seem like he just wanted to get his tip. Me and my wife go to BJ at least twice a month because we love the food there, our server ruined it for us."
shirley c.,"Elk Grove, CA",20,3,5,1.0,6/4/2017,"I called your restaurant at 10:30 to find if I can get on your call ahead list. Your host stated she can put me on the list, but I need to download your app and preorder. I explained to her we were a dental office and on our 1 hour lunch break but also celebrating my bday. I enjoy the menu at BJs and wanted a fun lunch experience since it was my choice to pick a place. I downloaded the app, had an awful time getting my coworkers salad order in, took 3 different try's and she had to pick a different item since none of the 3 salad choices were avail. My order was in by 11:55, and our dine in time was for 12:15. Part of my party arrived, they were seated and given menus, after our office Mgr tried to explain we already preordered and asked if the food was ready for 12:15. The host was confused and didn't know what was going on. I arrived a couple minutes after when Dennis the waiter comes to get our drink order. My office Mgr said, its Shirley's bday today. He didn't make any eye contact or acknowledge what she said. He continued to ask for drink orders. I leaned over and showed him my phone with the order detail and asked if the order was fine, he waived a piece of paper and said I have this. Never looked at me or answered my question, he was so rude and impolite. We did not see him until 12:44 when our food and to go boxes were set down on our table. He left and came back in 5 min to give us our tab. Nobody at our table had any time to eat our meals, nor were we asked if we wanted anything else, no acknowledgement that it was my bday, we were rushed, and honestly it was the worst experience by a BJs restaurant and their employees! It was awful!! I left there apologizing to my Drs, the ofc manager and the rest of my coworker for the behavior that your restaurant delivered. I am not the type of person who complains but this experience left me annoyed and very upset.  You are a chain in the food  industry of very competitive restaurants and should be more attentive to your customers to run a successful business.  Shirley Sent from my iPhone"
Lacy P.,"Sacramento, CA",29,45,6,2.0,6/26/2017,Two stars for our super nice server. Otherwise everything else was not good. The hostesses were all rude. The food was bleh.
Harry V.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,1,,2.0,8/16/2017,"This restaurant used to be one of our favorite spots to go to, but has recently gone down hill the past year. Average wait time to receive our food is usually around 1 hour. One time we just decided to leave after waiting over 30 minutes to receive our waters. The people that work there are friendly and just trying to do their job,but whoever organizes the logistics and order of the kitchen and service is extremely inefficient. Will not return."
Charles H.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",15,54,15,3.0,6/29/2017,"Anyone who has eaten at more than one BJ's knows that quality of food and service varies drastically from location to location. In this instance, I'm afraid food comes in at a subpar level. I had to cauliflower tacos and the stuffed mushrooms. Neither one shootout very much with the exception of the fact that the tacos were inundated with low quality cheese underneath the cauliflower. Service wasn't bad but the food was so mediocre that I am afraid I would not visit this location again any time soon. If I did, I would limit my choices to perhaps dessert and of course beer but I'm not even opening the menu."
Joanne R.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,8,3,3.0,7/25/2017,"Shout out to my server Kevin!!!!!  I'm rating HIM a 5/5. I'm giving the restaurant a 2/5.  Kevin was one of the best server in the restaurant. He's very friendly, remembers everyone's order, and every informative of the timing of the order.  He had a very very busy night taking another party of 10+ , 2 tables of 4 and my table of 15. He was running around trying make sure everyone was taken care of but was struggling. I appreciate his service during my time here at Bjs.  I'm giving the store a 2/5 because there was no manager to help him out. There was no one to clear out the table for dessert. No one was helping him make the experience better. I don't blame my server for the poor experience I blame the manager for not helping him out. The poor service reflect the manager on duty. I get it you were busy but to make your shift easier, making sure your employees are good makes the experience better which makes your shift run smoother  I wish nothing but the best for the server Kevin. I will request for you as my server again! Thanks Kevin"
Minh T.,"Sacramento, CA",1,31,5,5.0,7/14/2017,UPDATE: Still my favorite restaurant and services are getting a lot better since my last bad experience.
Raquel V.,"Sacramento, CA",14,98,140,5.0,6/22/2017,"B's is really good for a chain restaurant. The me u is extensive a variety of choices, beverages and desserts. Service is always very good. Dominic at the Elk Grove location is AWESOME. He goes over and above to make sure his customers are well taken care off. If your at the ELK Grove location ask for Dominic's table."
Tina H.,"Elk Grove, CA",121,24,3,3.0,12/29/2016,"My coworkers and I always come here to grab a bite after our shift, so I know the menu really well. I just wished they had more pasta options! I really miss the cajun pasta they had a while back. I decided to take my family here for dinner around 6:30pm on a Thursday night and it was jam packed. I was told by the hostess that the wait would be around 30~40 minutes and that I would get a text when the table for 4 would be ready. 25 minutes pass and our table is ready. My family and I got Samuel as our server. He was great, it took him a while to get our drinks, but I totally understand since it was pretty busy. He checked on us several times throughout our meal and was overall a patient server, just a little forgetful (we didn't get a to-go bag and had to ask for water refills).  My family and I ordered a variety of items on the menu. For the appetizer we got the boneless chicken wings with sriracha dry rub and crispy flatbread nachos. I found the boneless chicken wings to be like a better version of chicken nuggets, but more crispy and a little bit on the salty side. The crispy flatbread nachos were amazingly good for something that didn't have meat at all! For the entrees, we got the clam chowder bread bowl w/ a side of caesar salad, fresh atlantic salmon, new orleans jambalaya, and the parmesan crusted chicken. The clam chowder bread bowl that my little sister ordered had less soup than we anticipated, it was mostly sourdough bread. My mom liked the fresh atlantic salmon and my dad enjoyed the new orleans jambalaya because of the dish's spices. I thought the jambalaya would be more on the soupy/saucy side, but it still tasted good. The entree that I did not enjoy was the parmesan crusted chicken. The chicken was not crusty enough, was kind of on the dry side, and just lacked flavor, so the price of $16.50 for that dish was steep, however the mashed potatoes that came with it was so good though! Every time I go to BJ's, whether it's with friends, coworkers, or family, the food is decent and the portions are pretty big. The service is average. Overall, I always enjoy coming here to eat and catch up with friends. And when I drink, I get the strawberry splash because it tastes like jamba juice with alcohol :)"
Sondra T.,"Elk Grove, CA",535,51,117,2.0,4/19/2017,"I've come here many times and it's always been a hit or miss, however my most recent experience was absolutely ridiculous. Upon arrival, there was a lack of hosts at the front. It took a decent amount of time for us to get seated. You could easily tell that they were short staffed. Once seated, we had some time to look over the menu. I was starving so everything looked good, neither of us could decide what we wanted for our entrees, so we just decided to start off with an appetizer. The appetizer arrived, and we were ready to order, however our server was nowhere to be found. I'm a very understanding person, however 30 minutes passed and there was absolutely no sight of her. It took my angry mother to walk around the whole establishment to finally find her, which I find absolutely ridiculous. At that point, we didn't even want to eat there anymore. We didn't want to have to wait another additional 20+ minutes for our food to arrive. The server apologized and the manager came out to tell us that she's comping our appetizer. Funny story though, I saw the manager come out 15 minutes prior to apologize to another customer for something else. I take it that they're having an off night."
Risya L.,"Elk Grove, CA",286,570,753,3.0,4/15/2016,"Still only three stars, on two occasions my co-workers and I have ordered online and our orders don't come out correctly but still taste delicious so that's the third star *note to self if you make any modifications on your online order they do not receive it.  Twice I've ordered the enlightened menu Mediterranean chicken tacos with a change of side and I only get just the tacos...and my friends who are nice enough to pick it's don't know or assume our order is correct. I will say this the first time the manager on duty was nice enough to to send me a $15 gift card but my friend who's order was also messed up never heard back. They had the wrong ice cream flavor and her mushrooms were un-edible because she asked for one main ingredient to be removed. Another confusion is I ordered curbside pick up a different day, but where the heck do you go for the curbside pick up, good thing I went in so they again didn't give me what I ordered and had to wait. Starts to get frustrating, trust me if we had the time to wait and dine in we would or place an order there just to be sure everything is right we would. But I thought the online idea was to help those who don't have time on their side and need to pick up something quick. *Sigh"
Sarah C.,"Sacramento, CA",1,17,1,4.0,7/21/2017,"The wait and hostess service are amazing, and the food is good. We went there tonight because we wanted dessert and coffee. The Pizooki is amazing, but they cook them in aluminum dishes, which is a problem. Second, the coffee/latte is probably the worst I have ever had in my life, and when I asked the server, she said they know but no one in management cares. Just avoid the coffee and order a way over-priced but yummy cocktail instead. They also have great beer."
Matt M.,"Elk Grove, CA",240,25,,1.0,10/20/2016,Terrible service. I usually can get over bad service if I enjoy the food. My waitress forgot to get my food order so it was hard to get past this time around. I tried getting her attention like 3 times and ultimately gave up. I picked a pizza up from somewhere else on the way home after watching the game.  Not a good place to watch football on Sundays either. Hard to see the TVs if you have a booth. 1 star well earned.
