Sarah K.,"Elk Grove, CA",41,76,1,4.0,3/29/2017,I used to love and eat at BJs all the time when I first discovered it 16 years ago in LA. But the past few years I've been living in states where there was no BJs so it's been awhile. I do think the quality (or maybe novelty) has gone down. The Monday pizza special is pretty amazing though. A large pizza for $14? Can't beat that. My favorite is a half great white and half BBQ chicken. And of course the best thing on the menu: the pizzookie.
Jay M.,"Elk Grove, CA",20,1,1,2.0,7/25/2017,Just bought a pizookie to go and they forgot the ice cream -.- should have checked before I left
Pete R.,"Elk Grove, CA",1,4,,1.0,9/11/2016,"I brought friends from Central America here today for brunch. An hour into our conversation we realized no food yet. I had to ask another employee where is our server? The server said he was waiting on another egg (which never came). By then our coffee cooled off and again I had to ask another employee where is our server?  There was a noticeable buzz kill with the atmosphere infected by the lack of service. I felt embarrassed as their host to bring them here. I'm usually a good tipper, but it goes both ways. I left a dollar.  A few months ago I was here with a local friend. We sat at the bar on a Saturday for lunch. I completely finished my meal by the time he received his order. It was no fun eating alone. Management offered a tepid sorry, but no comp.  One time is excusable. Two times is a bad pattern. Luckily, there are plenty of other places to go because BJ's anywhere is erased from my list."
Kathy H.,"Sacramento, CA",38,96,127,3.0,4/5/2016,"My friend and I decided to come here for late lunch. As I walked in, I was not greeted at all. A guy in a suit greeted me while walking towards the kitchen to see if someone had help me, I told him no. He apologized and got my question answered right away. My friend and I sat at the bar, he ordered a few items on the happy hour menu which was very good! Service: I thought the service was horrible, so hard to get someone's attention to order and ask for refill. I'm not too fond about the service, but whatever  I will probably come back to try other food."
Esther U.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,16,74,4.0,10/17/2017,"I love their pizza and the choice of beer.  When we have been at BJ's we always leave satisfied. I am only giving a four instead of a five because the waitress mixed up our breakfast order and our dirty dishes were not picked up when we were done eating.  We like the friendly environment, so we will eat there again."
Kevin G.,"Davis, CA",0,14,5,2.0,4/9/2017,Went on Friday night. The wait was short at 10PM and the restaurant looks very nice. I went to the bar and got a beer during the wait. It was exceptional. That is all that is good about this visit. Would have given one start if not for the great beer. They have a great selection of beer. We were sat at our table and never spoke to again. My wife never got water so she had nothing. After half an hour we got up and took the menus to the hostess desk and told them we were never checked on and now leaving. They were ok bye. Must be something that happens all the time. Do not go here. They do not deserve the business.
Heather S.,"Sacramento, CA",29,92,114,3.0,6/17/2017,"I'm  on the fence about this place. It was my first time here, my sister said the food is usually on point. I guess tonight was an OFF night because the wings were cold, no ranch, the salad was mediocre the soup was okay, the medditerrrean tacos were great. The saving grace was our waitress, who did a wonderful job. I will probably give it another go, because I know every cook has off days."
Koid S.,"Sacramento, CA",347,33,13,1.0,11/7/2016,Ordered 3 burgers well done. told him cut them in half  to make sure they are well done if you have to. 2 of the 3 were pink burgers. We sent them back. 10 minutes later he comes back with 2 more burgers. Well done right. started eating. pink pink pink. how hard is it to cook a burger well done? who eats raw ground beef?  Not unacceptable!
Tony S.,"Emeryville, CA",0,6,,4.0,7/3/2017,"I've been to this BJ's twice and all the food was excellent, and great sides selection. so rarely do I order a glass of red wine and is it served at the perfect temperature, sounds stupid but this made me so happy, I really enjoyed that Malbec. The service was good time wise and the interaction was mostly pleasant. Great dim lightening, roomy comfy booth seating.  I recommend."
Jeffrey E.,"Wilton, CA",0,16,1,2.0,7/2/2017,"BJs does not have bad food for being a chain. They have a big problem with service and their ordering system. When you order rather than writing down orders they use these gadgets that send the orders directly to the kitchen. Very cool for kitchen efficiency, but results in poor customer experience because depending on order flow in the kitchen you can, and I've experienced, receiving the main course before the appetizer. If you don't mind this, queue up and enjoy; otherwise, go line up elsewhere where food and service is worth the wait."
Gigi P.,"Elk Grove, CA",151,23,18,5.0,6/22/2017,I think our servers name was Shannette? She has cool green nails with a daisy on her accent nail. Lol. She did a really great job serving us even though it was really busy. She gave off a really positive energy too. :)
Adrienne H.,"Elk Grove, CA",321,37,40,3.0,11/27/2016,The deep dish pizza was relatively cheap on half-off Monday's (~12 for a large deep dish after discount). However we were disappointed that the deep dish was just a thicker crusted pizza - its not the expected Chicago deep dish where you have to eat with knife and fork. The flavor was good though. The avocado egg rolls were yummy but definitely overpriced- $9 for 6 pieces
Stephanie A.,"Elk Grove, CA",380,281,466,3.0,3/4/2015,"First of all, I just wanted to mention the service was great. Our server was very friendly and attentive and had a good sense of humor. When it comes to service, we have nothing to complain there. 5 stars for the service.  3 stars for the food, mainly. We got 2 deep dish pizzas, and it just wasn't all that great. I wouldn't really consider their deep dish pizzas as ""deep"" enough. The depth of it was just like normal pizza. The pizzas came or at warm to room temperature almost and just wasn't HOT enough at all. Despite the temperature, the bottom of the pizza was dark and slightly burnt.  I would probably never get pizza from here again but I'm sure there are many other delicious dishes here, just not the pizza."
Juliana C.,"San Diego, CA",660,242,3280,3.0,2/3/2015,"I like the food and the atmosphere, but OMG... don't come here the day after Christmas! Everyone was here. It was nice that they are located right next to the Hilton Garden Inn where we were staying. But it was ridiculous, and we didn't even try to sit in the restaurant area. We ate at the bar. The bartender/our waitress was nice. It was really busy so she was constantly on the move....  But a quick lunch it was not. I ordered the California Club flatbread pizza, which I have ordered before (not at this location). It was not great; it was really bland and dry. My bf ordered the chicken parmesan sandwich, which was really tasty. Glad the bf knows to order something I would enjoy just in case... I liked that better than what I ordered. ;P  They have craft sodas you can always get a sample of and the root beer is always good. They also have a Black cherry soda, that I'm always tempted to get...my soda weakness. Get it for the extreme sugar rush."
Nick B.,"Elk Grove, CA",1,9,,5.0,7/13/2017,So many haters on here baby let me tell ya BJs is the best restaurant I've ever had. (Even better than apple bees which I love) best food ever thank u staff at bjs Elk Grove 4 making me feel welcomed each and everytime
Dennis M.,"Sacramento, CA",2,43,16,4.0,5/21/2017,What can you say about BJs.....Brewhouse that is...the food is always spot on...service is always good .. always has about 15 or so beers on tap.......a great place to either hang at the bar or have a nice family dinner
Jenn P.,"San Jose, CA",173,62,9,1.0,8/13/2016,"DO NOT ORDER CURBSIDE PICK UP.  If you do, check your order before you leave.  We dined-in and ordered the Honey-Crisp Chicken Salad and it was delicious.  We were hungry (but busy) one evening and decided to do curbside pick up for the same salad.  When we got home, we opened it and it was OLD iceberg lettuce (with NO ROMAINE like it stated), the chicken tenders were not crispy, had literally a few pieces of stale almonds, and ratio of other toppings was non-existent.  The dressing they gave in the little container was only filled half way.  It was 95% old iceberg lettuce and 5% of the toppings.   Obviously they do this because most people don't check their orders since they do curb-side because they ARE in a hurry. We had to use things we had in the fridge to add to the salad because it was honestly so bare.  Two salads for $27, WHAT A RIP OFF.  Wish we could get reimbursed.  NEVER coming here again."
Shelley S.,"Elk Grove, CA",29,17,,4.0,9/17/2016,More GREAT service at BJ's Restaurant! Server Vanessa always makes sure our burger is made right. What keeps me from giving a 5stars is the fact a certain person in the back ALWAYS makes the burgers wrong. For some reason he never makes the burgers the way described on the menu. Vanessa is aware of this and always checks in on us even if she is not our server. Another server that is always so sweet and on top of it is Breeanna V. Love seeing her when we come in and also gives a wave to us even if not our server. BJ's has a great group working with them making grabbing a beer & burger so much more enjoyable..
Jay S.,"Emeryville, CA",2,64,4,1.0,3/19/2017,The location I use to go too was San Bruno that was over a year ago.  The service is hit and miss.    And the food in my opinion is not as good as it use to be.
Taylor B.,"Sacramento, CA",14,3,,1.0,5/15/2017,I literally had the WORST experience ever tonight. It was my moms Graduation day and we chose BJ's over everywhere else for dinner. First let me start off my saying our waiter DJ was AWSOME!! But the Service part that he couldn't control was horrible. After my family decided on what to order we patiently waited for an hour for food we never received after waiting 15 min for a Pepsi.. I decided to just get the food to go considering I waited so long to eat I wasn't t even hungry anymore. I called over the manager to inform him what was going on and he proceeded to let me know how it was not ok and assured us that hey we're bagging up our food. After waiting a additional 30 min for our food we decided to just go ahead and leave with out that food. My mother not only had to drive all the to Roseville with out food but her graduation dinner was completely ruined.. THANKS BJ's
