Ada W.,"Sacramento, CA",40,3,7,1.0,5/15/2017,"Bad quality service, dirty plate to share, dirty cup to drink hot water, no service on Bar section. Bad!"
McKenzie R.,"Elk Grove, CA",12,9,,4.0,6/23/2017,"There food  is great, especially their chicken sandwich! The waiters are really nice. But, it's always so noisy and it takes a really long time for the food to come out."
Lyn G.,"Sacramento, CA",106,119,88,4.0,9/16/2016,"My daughter's 6th grade class held a fundraiser dinner here last night so we decided to go. BJ's is always busy, which is a good sign you just have to be patient. I went online and placed our name on the waitlist which helped a bit. To the lady who complained that you got there before us and we were seated first...umm try the waitlist and maybe you'll get seated faster.  Food is ok, in my opinion. I ordered the french dip in which the bread was burnt. My little kids got the kids cheeseburger meals and the the meat was enough for just one bite. What the heck was that about? Hubby and my oldest daughter ordered a sirloin and they were happy with their meals- aside from getting an empty bottle of A1 sauce :/  And all our fries were cold and hard.  Anyway, they were busier than normal tonight. I don't think they were prepared for the families coming for the fundraiser. I overheard a server tell a customer that they didn't know why they were busier than normal. Communication between managers and staff maybe lacking? Who knows! All I know is that it was a long wait for our server to come to the table to introduce herself, a long wait for our drinks and appetizers, a longer wait for our food. When our food finally arrived, they forgot our ranch and we got an empty bottle of A1 sauce.  I get they were busy and maybe over whelmed, and normally service is better that's why the 4 stars. I won't let one night prevent me from returning.  The hostess, servers, and manager were all nice, and that's always a plus."
Dina C.,"Elk Grove, CA",31,3,,1.0,6/20/2017,"So tonight my family and I went to BJ's to celebrate our 20th anniversary did not want to travel too far for another restaurant so chose something what we thought to be nice in our area. When we got there the greeting hostess was very nice. However the hostess that was assisting in seating had a look on her face like she hated her job. The actual hostess that sat us assisted in cleaning the table so that we can be seated and she was very kind. Our waitress then came over and took our drink order and she to was kind. We placed our order with a couple appetizers and then our entrées and proceeded to wait as you would expect for the appetizers to arrive. The restaurant seemed to be understaffed as it took so long for us to get our appetizers to arrive and when they arrived at the table were lukewarm at best, as if they were left in the kitchen for some time. We then realized we did not have utensils or napkins or even appetizer plates and we had to ask for that as well. Upon inspection of the silverware we noticed spotting and food particles left on some of the utensils. When our meals arrived my sons plate which was hot wings should have been hot from the heat and not from the sauce but they two were lukewarm at best the fries that accompanied his dish again barely hot. The chicken on my salad as well as the shrimp on my husbands were also under temperature. We did not complain only because it was so late and felt that a complaint would only delay our meal that much longer.  I would not suggest returning to this place and I'm very surprised of the number of people who are constantly waiting to get in. Although the price is not astronomical it is a little higher than your average restaurant and you would hope that you get what you pay for and clearly on this visit we did not. So, although I am sure in the grand scheme of things it will not matter that we will not be returning to this restaurant but it is sad that our experience could not have been better. Sadly this place has gone way downhill over the last couple of years."
Ibrahim G.,"Sacramento, CA",0,3,1,2.0,9/30/2017,"The food was ok, I asked the waiter if they sing for birthdays she says no we don't get paid to do that, I was simply asking a question, yes or no not what they get paid to do I'm a service advisor for a really big dealership in Sacramento I can believe she said that to me! That would never fly at my work place!Very unprofessional and rude probably will not be going back because of that. and not to mention my bill was over $250.00 , so they lost a good customer, I'll take my business to the north location if I ever do go back. She clearly needs to be retrained. Very unsatisfactory for such expensive prices.!"
Nu H.,"Elk Grove, CA",129,68,88,4.0,1/13/2017,"I come here a lot for my vegetarian buddy.  Basically, because their pizzas are bomb.  We came during happy hour so got half off the drinks and pizza.  I like their tavern cut pizzas, its thin and tasty.  It's just a perfect size.  I ordered their Garlic Chicken Pesto as my friend ordered the margharita pizza.  Omg, also their Brussels sprouts are delicious.  I got super full from just eating all that, Very very tasty i must say!"
Liz D.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,3,,5.0,9/28/2017,"Tonight we came in with a group of 7 and had the honor to having Danielle P as our server. She did an amazing job keeping drinks full and appetizers on order for us as our group slowly trickled in. She gave the whole table several drink options and was very well versed with the beer selection. She was nice and patient enough to split our tab 7 ways!!! Which was amazing of her. Where does that ever happen. She had a great attitude and kept us happy the whole night. Also she mentioned there was a fundraiser for children and families effected by the recent natural disasters, which we all gladly donated to. Service was 10/10. I've been around to BJ's a few times but never had a server go out of their way the way Danielle did! Thank you so much for the service and an amazing dinner!!!"
Colleen W.,"Sacramento, CA",521,324,425,1.0,7/1/2016,"I'm done... Tonight was my final straw. Called as I walked out my front door (15+ minutes away) to put our name on the call ahead list. I was told I was being transferred to the hostess station... So I waited and waited and waited and waited... Kept looking at the call timer on my phone which reached 12 minutes before I hung up, that and I wasn't far away by that time. I called again and right away someone answered, she took my information, said nothing else and hung up. No 'hey make sure you check in when you get here' or 'it's a 15-20 minutes wait,' nothing! So we arrive and wait 25 minutes before I go up to check on our status and am informed that I was supposed to check in. The guy was nice so no fault on him but he checked on times and told me it would still be another 10-15minutes... Yeah no! I'll permanently taking my business elsewhere."
Katie P.,"Elk Grove, CA",294,90,169,2.0,8/11/2016,"Ehhh not a fan. Bad service when I eat in, order to-go and curbside is the worst. Food is typical chain restaurant style but they try to cover it up with ""seasonal"" words on the menu. Should probably only give 1 star but added another one cause they stay open late and if you need a place to go for a quick bite and drink late then it's your long option around EG. Oh ya and the Salted Carmel Pazooki gets 5 stars !"
Michelle B.,"Elk Grove, CA",11,72,11,1.0,8/13/2016,This place has gone down over time. I use to love their food. Their pizza never has enough cheese on it so pockets of dough is all you get. I ordered a steak medium rare and it came out medium well. The broccoli was barely cooked so it tasted like a salad topping.  The chips are super greasy. I have had alittle bit of everything here and I've concluded that nothing is overall that great. If you want a drink stick with the beers or wine. The bar drinks are super sweet and barely have any alcohol in them.  The only thing that is good is their pozookie's. The peanut butter smores one is amazing.
Lyrics W.,"Sacramento, CA",0,17,10,3.0,12/4/2016,"I'm only giving three stars because customer service is great however this is the 3rd time that I have visited and have had issues. The 1st time we came, we waited an hour for our order to be taken, and another hour for it to come out for a party of 3. The second time we were given dirty dishes, and cold food. Today we waited an hr for our food that was once again served on dirty dishes, and the only hot item that was brought out today was the dessert. I suggested visiting the Arden location if you want hot food, and clean dishes. My favorite appetizer is avocado egg rolls, and the lemon thyme chicken. When it's served hot at the Arden location. Also, the managers came out and personally apologized each time and did try there best, to make sure we left happy."
Parminder D.,"Elk Grove, CA",2,9,5,4.0,2/11/2017,I come here all the time with family and friends. Their  customer service is always good for the most part. Their food is good but the pizza kind of fell off from when they first opened but I still love it. I would recommend this place to everyone.
Kristen K.,"Elk Grove, CA",110,50,123,4.0,7/11/2016,"We go to BJ's often and I was surprised to see its overall rating was 3 stars. However on a busy Friday night I realized it might have to do with how hectic it can get. They told us the wait for a party of 4 would be 15-20 minutes but we actually got a table in 5 minutes max. The food was great as always but it took a while to get there since the place was packed. There wasnt much time for the waiters or waitresses to check on us after serving our food but they were still polite, even as we made our way out the door. Other than how busy it is, BJ's still serves great food with good service."
Cassandra D.,"Sacramento, CA",135,15,10,1.0,9/12/2017,"Omg please stay away. We had dinner here last night and the service wasn't great but the food was horrific. My husband and I both ordered the rib eye because the menu had so much going on that we figured they didn't do anything well and let's face it how can you screw up a ribeye. Especially one they felt they could charge 27.00 for. Well let me tell you, they did it. My husband's came first with the rest of the tables meals, myself and one other person in the party waited a full 15 minutes before our plates were delivered, which of course made everyone else's food cold because we are civilized and wait for everyone to be served before we eat. Back to the steak. It was ordered medium rare (both were) it came and it just looked dry. Not the kind of seared so it's juicy inside dry, but shoe leather dry (at this point I look at the ""loaded"" baked potato that consists of a slot with some cheese, sour cream and bacon bits shoved in it, it wasn't even cracked open just slit) he cut into it and it was this wierd dayglow red. But when you touched it it felt like a well done steak. It chewed like a well done steak, so the only thing that we can figure is that they must add some sort of food colouring to the meat. Mine was no better except the colour was a little more natural. We didn't eat 3 bites of it. The server never asked how it was and seeing how this was not our birthday celebration we didn't want to make a scene. However after shelling out what amounted to about 80.00 after tip for a meal we couldn't eat I thought maybe we should warn people off.  Seriously, maybe this place does something well but it ain't the meat."
Jsmn Y.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,3,1,2.0,12/7/2016,"I've never had a pleasant experience at BJ's besides good company but it was provided by me so no win win here.  The last time I came here was on a Monday night and it was pretty packed but I had to flag down my waiter and didn't receive my beer on time with my food so it wasn't as appetizing. The food is prepared way much better at the Arden location, which is odd because they stay busier. At least the cooks there know how to season even with a full house."
Ros A.,"University City, San Diego, CA",540,269,761,3.0,11/15/2015,"What started off to be a good overall experience ended up to be a long frustrating one.  To start off we ordered calamari. I wasn't too hungry that night so I ordered the soup and salad combo. I chose chicken tortilla soup and Cesar salad. For dessert we ordered the pizookie trio. Everything up to this point was good. Food was as expected and service was good.  After our server brought our check, we were pretty much left on our own. The check came quickly after the dessert came out. We put our card in and continued to finish dessert. After maybe 15 mins or so, the waitress hadn't come back to pick up the card to run it. We decide to wait a little longer and keep chatting. Another 10 or so mins past and still no waitress. The restaurant had gotten busier, but to not come back within almost half an hour is a long time! We decide to take our check to the front and have the cashier run it. Everyone was running around. When we finally find someone we tell them our waitress hasn't come back to run the card and we've waited awhile. He takes the bill and card to the back and comes back to tell us only the server can run it, so he gave it to her.  Another few mins waiting at the front, we haven't gotten our card or receipt back. I see a guy, who looks like he can be the manager and asked him for help. He too was running around that I had to come back to him again and remind him we were still waiting for our card. Finally we were able to get our card back and sign.  It was such a long time waiting and such a hassle to get our card charged. Everything was good until the restaurant got busy and it seemed like everyone, including the manager, was too busy to help."
Andrea S.,"Sacramento, CA",7,13,78,5.0,1/29/2017,We ended up sitting in a booth at the bar and our server was VANESSA and she was awesome  good service and always with a smile every time she came to check on us......Vanessa good job
Zoriah M.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,3,,4.0,5/22/2017,"The food at BJ's is not amazing, people go for the reason that people buy Beats it's not that they are absolutely the best but that the name is familiar and popular. The food don't get me wrong is delicious but it's nothing special. Their Pizookies are amazing. There appetizers are appetizing but just like the entrees are nothing amazing. Often times they are much to packed."
Khan L.,"The Pocket-Greenhaven, Sacramento, CA",72,5,,1.0,6/28/2016,"Let me start of with saying that this rating is due to the horrible server (Chandra A #191) that we had. Food is consistent with all other bj's. I do not wish her to get fired but she defiantly needs to be retrained.  Came here yesterday for dinner with 3 other friends and I would say it was a normal day. They had a good number of tables filled, but being super busy was defiantly not what had cause these errors to occur.          First she stopped by our table and asked for our drink orders.  While one friend was still decided on her drink, she just walked away without saying a word. And when she did come back and my friend had ordered an alcoholic drink, the server did not even card her. Which we didn't really care as my friend is 27, but she was definitely not doing her job.  After we had placed our order and the food came, she never returned to check on table. We had to ask other servers for assistance. Which they were glad to help but it was not their job to serve our table.  When she final came to ""check"" on us, she had the bill and asked if we would like anything else. We had ordered a pizookie at the beginning with our meal. When we reminded her of this, she just said ""oh yeah."" Also at this point we had ask her for two to go containers and one soup container.  She then came back with the two to go containers, and the bill before our pizookie even got to our table. We also reminded her of the soup container which she stated with an attitude that she's getting it.  We had 2 gift cards and asked to split the rest onto 2 credit cards. Which should be roughly around $20 each. She then returns and states that the machine ran most of the bill ($45) on my card and the machine was not taking my friend's card. Asking my friend if she had another card. At this point it was only $5 so I just asked her to charge it all to my card, which was not a big deal. My friend then went online to reviewed her card history and the card that was ""declined"" had already been charged. It was the one that had been charged the $45, which her bank probably froze the second time she tried to swipe it for an additional amount.  And if she had split the bill like we had asked, we don't understand how a $45 bill would have been charged. It would have been $20, and the other $20 was declined.  When she finally came back after charging our cards, we confirmed that my friends card was charged the $45 and mine was charged $5 (our names and last four of the card numbers are on the receipts, which she could also had seen to realized that she had charged the same card that she stated was declined) Also at this point we still did not get the soup container, which we asked for again. When we saw a few minutes later that she was assisting a different table we asked a different  server who got it right away for us. She never came to apologize or I don't even think she remembered/cared that she forgot it AGAIN. When she finally came with the pizookie and I was in the middle of packing my meal. She then picked up one plate from our table and proceeded to grab my plate from my hand (when I was still packing) when my friend had her empty plate right in front of me.  And as we were sitting there finishing our pizookie and chatting she came back to grab the bill from under my hand and just walked away. I would think the proper thing to do would be to ask for it. But I guess not for her.  Her rude attitude definitely ruined our night and made us regret going there."
Isaac G.,"Sacramento, CA",177,2,,5.0,4/30/2017,"On this past Friday, my wife, son and I went to BJ's. We had the privelage of having Kevin as our server. He was amazing and I highly recommend Kevin as a server. Our toddler received his food within 10 minutes of us being seated. When you go to BJ's ask to be seated in Kevin's area, he is an exceptional server."
