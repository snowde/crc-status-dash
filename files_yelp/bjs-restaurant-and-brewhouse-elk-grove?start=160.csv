Maribel I.,"Elk Grove, CA",5,45,16,3.0,3/4/2017,"Love this place but then again it depends on the cook because when I got the jambalaya one time it was not good at all. They made it like a soupy dish which was gross. And I asked the server if they changed something with their jambalaya cause it's not the same as my previous orders he said no. I'm just not gonna get that dish anymore based on that experience. I like their calamari, steak, burgers, avocado egg rolls, and too many more to list. Don't forget to try the pazookies! My favorite is the white chocolate macadamia! mMmMm..."
Sarah W.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,23,1,5.0,9/20/2016,"I don't write reviews on Yelp too often, but wow.  I stopped by BJ's today with my mom and kids. I used to go to this restaurant quite a lot when I was pregnant because I craved their wedge cut fries but never found it particularly good overall, just generally okay. Baby loved those fries though!! Today I was in Elk Grove and it popped into my mind so we went in. Our server was AJ and honestly, there are not enough compliments that I can give him. It wasn't just the best service that I have ever had at BJ's, it was probably the best service I've had at a restaurant EVER. And I eat out a lot.  AJ was super sweet to the kids, took his time to engage with them and listen and make them feel special. It was really kind and thoughtful. He was prompt, brought us everything that we needed, refilled drinks so quickly and when my mom asked for a small lemonade to try, he brought out a regular sized one. When we were done, he came to the table and asked my stepson if he wanted a pizookie. For free!! I just could not believe it. Our day was made. Seriously, I left thinking what a wonderful person he was as we were all so uplifted by him. Please give him a pay-rise or a promotion or something because he is the BEST!  Food was really good too but I would for sure go back for that service. Incredible."
ann s.,"Sacramento, CA",6,156,74,1.0,8/5/2017,We decided to give this location a try again and discovered that the BJs app still doesn't work. The app states this location is closed. We called in our order and spoke to Michaela who sounded as though we bothered her. She seemed uninterested when we informed her the app isnt working. I asked if we upset her somehow and she changed her tone however...its a tad late. It really sucks because this location is close to home. Kinder staff and perhaps a working app can really help...maybe next time.
Rolando B.,"Sacramento, CA",2,13,,1.0,3/17/2017,Now it went to 1 Star. I called day after i put my review.  Hostess said manager will call u and nada after a week. Don't think i will recommend this place for our company
Pravin L.,"San Francisco, CA",75,81,52,4.0,6/27/2016,"I give it a 4 star for the beer! Jeremiah Red and Blonde are just what we needed on a hot thirty Sunday evening. Came here with wifey and friends to celebrate two birthdays. Appetizers were good as we ordered my favorite chicken wings and also an order of the calamari...both were on point! Did I mention the beer was good? For my meal...it was the Lemon Thyme Chicken...healthy and delicious. For our desert, we ordered the pazookie...cookie and ice cream are a great combination. Overall it was a good experience...it's def loud in there. Our hostess was very nice and was cheerful. I would def go back for some Brewhouse Blonde and chicken wings...and also catch a game. :)"
Doug G.,"Lincoln, CA",242,268,356,4.0,11/18/2015,"This ""chain restaurant"" (which does not feel like a typical chain restaurant) has a number of very good, lower calorie options as well as some very tasty fried food (and/or more caloric good stuff). Huge menu. I like the Lettuce Wraps (Chicken or Shrimp).  The Seared Ahi Salad is marvelous and I frequently order this with a cup of the Chicken Tortilla Soup (super good).  You might also like the Lemon Thyme Chicken. The California Chicken Club is worth a try, but .......................all this being said, I most highly recommend their Double Deluxe Burger. Make sure you also have the French fries (catsup, muster & hot sauce ... of choice).  Decent wine selection and of course, a lot of beer to have fun figuring out.  Good wait staff service.  Nice surroundings. Noisy as the day progresses along with long wait lines mid-day on Sundays."
Matta D.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,43,26,4.0,4/30/2017,"I always have a great experience here. Even on a busy night, food is out pretty quickly and is always delicious! Servers are always happy to correct anything that isn't to your liking. The only downside is that the beers and food are inconsistently cold/warm. And the floor is extra slick in the step down area... I always have to hold on to hold onto my husband as we walk through so that I don't slip. But, everything is always good! One of our go-to restaurants."
Ann C.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,2,,2.0,4/30/2017,"THIS PLACE NEED TO GO GET SOME MUSHROOMS FROM WINCO, their stuffed mushrooms are so tiny and dried, most importantly they need a new chef!!! FIND A NEW CHEF PLEASE!! All the foods came all dried up, veggies are ridiculous! All the veggies looked like they ran out and pick some out of the trash to cook it, just gross, just nasty looking. I rather go to Cheesecake Factory even though I live 1 minutes away from Bj's. will not return to this place, I gave them enough chances. Not anymore."
A P.,"Sacramento, CA",0,9,,1.0,8/24/2017,"Terrible service-male waiter who never brought our pizookies that was togo.We told him we will wait up front and he said he will bring it.We waited for 45 minutes when i asked them to refund me so we can we can leave.Then lady said let me go check and came back 20 minutes later.When asked what was wrong, she said""oven has turned off.""And our male waiter just ignored us.It seems that the quality of food here is getting worse every time i come here and now i can say the same about their service."
Jerrie W.,"Sacramento, CA",14,4,,5.0,4/5/2017,"My husband and I love this place!We really like the white peach margarita.The avocado egg rolls are to for for,must try!!!!!"
Vanessa M.,"Elk Grove, CA",275,74,238,5.0,9/21/2015,"I love this place simply because they serve just about anything and everything You could ever want! Seriously, their menu is as thick as a Stephen King novel. BONUS: they have a full bar and about 20 different tvs with sports and such on!  I love their salad variety! My kids love their fried calamari and burgers. Ohh and the ice cream cookie of course! If you go there on your bday you get a free desert.  Tip of the day: make a reservation if you can, especially on the weekend or be prepared to wait."
Lucy M.,"Sacramento, CA",190,331,2191,4.0,9/12/2014,"The happy hour menu is fantastic here! Its economical and the food menu has full sized portions not ""mini"" happy hour sized plates. I  am here, with my colleagues,  enjoying the food and drink specials. I ordered the Irish Pear. Which is a blend of pear cider and BJ's  signature Jeremiah Red.  It's delicious and refreshing. A well balanced medium bodied libation with a ""green apple/crisp pear"" finish. The perfect drink for a warm fall September day ....You've got to try this! Unfortunately, however,  I dropped my review down by one star because my colleagues and I sat at a dirty table for 10 minutes before the bus boy finally cleaned it off. Other than that our dining experience was pretty good here and you should come and check it out :-)."
Monet B.,"West Sacramento, CA",0,5,,2.0,3/30/2017,"Terrible customer service. When we got seated, it took about 15 minutes before we were approached for drinks, by then we were ready to order. I asked for my burger to be well done, when it came to the table the meat was very pink. I couldn't send it back or mention it because the waiter didn't come back to ask how everything was going, he finally came back more than a half hour later. No one asked if we needed refills or offered to go boxes."
Vanessa K.,"Elk Grove, CA",30,3,1,1.0,12/27/2016,"Unacceptable service.!! I'm absolutely infuriated after what I have witnessed tonight. I'm not too sure what our waitress name was because she had never introduced herself. Not only did we wait an HOUR to get our drink (we ended up having to leave because, we never received our drinks), but our tab was also combined with a nearby table and was unapologetic with the whole situation. We had 3 servers ask what drinks we wanted even though we have told them 3 times. No, 4 times because we had to stop another waiter to ask where are our drinks???... another thing... I noticed that a couple that came 30 mins after us had gotten their drinks, appetizer and once they got their food... I had completely lost it... i have a gift card to this restaurant but I'm afraid I'm going to have to regift it because I will not be returning."
David W.,"Orange County, CA",109,76,248,4.0,5/10/2016,"I'm usually not a fan of restaurant chains, but I must admit, BJ's of Elk Grove has yet to disappoint me in regards to food quality. I use to come here often when working in the area. Came back to visit in March and the place hasn't changed one bit. Food is still consistently good with awesome presentation as you can see from the photos I've posted. I've been to other BJ's locations but none of them have been as consistent as BJ's of Elk Grove in regards to quality of service and food. I'm not sure of whether BJ's reheats premade entrees or not. But whatever they're doing here, they're doing it right to set themselves apart from other BJ's locations. Oh yeah, their mojitos are tasty too!"
Esmeralda S.,"Brawley, CA",64,4,1,5.0,3/27/2017,"Stayed at the bar after a long day of training and had a great waitress named Rebecca. Her first night working the bar and she was amazing! She was attentive,  got our sometimes complicated order right and was just perfect all night. Even made sure we had a safe way home!."
Michelle C.,"Elk Grove, CA",1098,190,245,3.0,5/3/2016,"I come here pretty often since there aren't a whole lot of options in Elk Grove to have happy hour.  My main complaint about this BJ's is that they're very inconsistent.  The service is hit and miss and so is the food.  I can't count how many times I've observed the host staff and wait staff huddled up in a corner talking like they have no care in the world.  I have never been in ""AWE"" over their food but it's decent enough (except the one time I found what looked like a hair from an indiscreet place ~ it took me forever to go back).  Judge for yourself."
Steve S.,"Elk Grove, CA",71,30,,4.0,3/24/2017,Always great and friendly service.  Gets busy on weekends but usually something open in the bar area.  Can't resist the pizookie!
Gloria L.,"Irvine, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/8/2017,I always wait forever (as in more than half an hour) for either my food to arrive or to be seated. Not sure what the fuck is wrong with the kitchen or wait staff. This place is always a last resort for me.
Danielle F.,"Elk Grove, CA",464,43,14,5.0,2/3/2017,"Raven and Courtney are the reasons my friend and I started coming here again. They are super friendly and give great service. My friends and I have had some terrible service in house here before where we weren't made to feel welcome and vowed not to come back. But then we started to just sit in the bar and always seem to get amazing service. Raven and Courtney are always knowledgeable about the menu and any changes and can always provide recommendations.  The menu has a great selection, and their drinks are great. Definitely recommend sitting in the bar."
