Jeremy C.,"Elk Grove, CA",30,71,5,4.0,2/15/2017,"For a chain restaurant, it's as good as you expect. I was expecting a little more consistency, but after ordering the seared ahi salad a few times, it's been a little different; I.e. less fish, smaller pieces, etc. Beers are good."
Sheelam J.,"Sacramento, CA",0,1,,4.0,9/2/2017,Food was great and the drinks was off the hook. The wait has 45 minutes and the same place is very overcrowded.
Jenny L.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,21,3,5.0,2/18/2017,"I love the happy hour. I always get the root beer glazed wings, a pitcher of 805, and a mini deep dish BBQ chicken pizza, mozzarella sticks and their clam chowder bowl is bomb!!!!!!!!!!! They have a good app too which let's u know the deals for the week/month. Also it let's u punch in ur table number to collect points and for every 70 points, u receive 5.00 off ur tab. :) Their food is better than cheesecake factory in my opinion. Love it."
Amy T.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/10/2017,"Never thought I ever do a Yelp Review but this place absolutely deserve a 1-Star. Came here last night at 8:30pm 8/9/2017 for my friends birthday dinner. I approached the host stand and told them I here for Josh's party. Then she asked me how many people. I told about 40-45 people. She goes ""oh, they're not all here yet"" looking confused because our reservation was at 8pm and if my party haven't been sat yet I would've see them sitting in the lobby or outside. But just to make sure I asked her again ""so you haven't sat them yet?"" Then she goes ""I JUST TOLD YOU, THEY'RE NOT ALL HERE YET"" with an attitude! In that exact word and in a rude demeanor. I'm like okay, super annoyed, I just started to walk outside to look for my party. Before I got to the door a different host came from behind and asked if I'm part of Josh's party. I told her yes. She said I already sat your party. Wow. Not only was the first host rude but she didn't know what shes talking about. I get it, people makes mistake, it was a miscommunication which I totally understand, but her attitude is what did it for me.         Btw miss Rude was tall, light skin, wavy, curly hair and was sitting people all night. Wish I gotten her name. But seriously if you don't want to be there and work there then go home. Stop giving people attitude for no reason.  HORRIBLE. THUMBS DOWN."
Inessa C.,"Elk Grove, CA",204,6,,2.0,1/28/2017,"We were having dinner for my sisters graduation. Service was good, however my sirloin came out burnt. Was very disappointed. Hope next time it will be better experience."
D W.,"Sacramento, CA",20,54,42,1.0,2/12/2017,The waitress we had was awesome! But the food killed it.....I ordered the two egg breakfast with scrambled eggs. What I got was two over easy eggs (cold). The ham was good do but cold. The potatoes were bland and cold. This was for my daughters birthday and the food was bland and cold.
Ken R.,"Elk Grove, CA",1,20,,3.0,12/13/2016,"Bro, it's a BJ's. You don't need to read a review to go to this place. I do have soft spot for their homemade cream soda. But don't tell anyone. Shhh."
Ryan O.,"Elk Grove, CA",86,11,,4.0,3/19/2017,Great food and good beer selection! Have only had one bad experience other than it being crowded a lot and that was when our waitress prolly bagged my wife's coach shades that we left on the table
Kate J.,"Elk Grove, CA",4,38,10,3.0,1/9/2017,Let me start out with a positive. The only positive for this location. The food is consistently good.  Now for the negative. Every time we've come to this location the service has been mediocre to poor. We usually don't dine at peek hours either. Today we came right after the lunch rush was over and before the dinner crowd. Maybe 60 people total in the restaurant. Our waitress Nadine started out promising. After she took our orders that was the last we saw of her until she brought the check. She never checked on our drinks or checked on us at all. When she brought the check she forgot to deduct the coupon I had told her about prior. (Which is ok) but that took another 10 mins before she got back to us. I even asked for a refill on my daughters drink and she forgot. I had to go up to the front desk where Morgan I believe had outstanding customer service. She offered us drinks to go and went to talk my husband about the bill. Also the table next to us had to wait a good amount of time before a server showed up.  I understand people/restaurants get busy. This is a constant with this location though and it wasn't busy.
Jennifer M.,"Sacramento, CA",195,46,35,1.0,1/21/2017,"Yet another bad experience with this location. Did  call ahead seating. Get there and check in. Told 10-15 minute wait. After 20 minutes of waiting and saw everyone arrive after us get sat. Then I overhear the same hostess I checked in with mention that my party hadn't arrived, I approached her. Then I'm told they'll clear a table for us. Then when our table to ready instead of calling my name she points to another group. Guess it was a sign when I walked in and no one was waiting (6:30pm on a Saturday night)."
Kristina P.,"Folsom, CA",0,2,,4.0,9/29/2016,I stopped by for the first time in three years last night with my family. Both food and service was good!  My last experience was horrible and I told myself I wouldn't come back for awhile. Our server was rude and my food was cold. Not tonight. I'm glad I gave this place another shot. We will be coming here more often!
Sheila E.,"San Jose, CA",0,28,16,1.0,11/20/2016,"Never again! We traveled from San Jose to Elk Grove and our hotel is walking distance. We ordered take out and my husband picked up the food and we had plans to eat it in the room because we were tired from the drive and have a grumpy two year old. I ordered a baked potato with the works and they forgot the works and gave me just a baked potato. Then when I went in to slice the steak I requested medium and it was over cooked and dry as hell! They forgot my fries too and the Brussels sprouts were rubbery and not crispy! I know my husband probably should of double checked the bag to see if everything was there but why should we? We didn't even bother to go back and complain. Sadly, I threw away the food and went to Leatherby's across the street... SO.MUCH.BETTER!!! The food was great and the ice cream sundae I ordered made my night so much better!  I hate you BJ's, but thanks to you I discovered Leatherby's."
Adam S.,"Elk Grove, CA",1,9,27,1.0,7/24/2017,"Bj's is over rated why I keep giving this place a chance is because my wife loves it. So as I agreed to give it another chance we walk in and there is no wait, I ask the hostess if we may have a booth he says give him a min. So I sat on the waiting bench, another party walks in he calls us both up at the same time he gives menus to the manager as he proceeds to walk us to a table section when I remind him I requested a booth, he says oh. As we walk to a booth section there was the other party sitting in our booth. He then seats us in a dirty booth which needs to be wiped down still. At this point I'm ready to go because it's all bad already from the jump but I say I'll give it a chance and wait til it got wiped down. I then go to sit down and the boot seat is just all broken, there is no reason a franchise like this should have broken booths. I then tell my wife I'm done I don't want to come here anymore and that she can eat here with out me anytime and I wouldn't be butt hurt. My other experiences here were bad food and service, how do people even keep coming back here has me clueless. The place is boo boo."
Hena A.,"Sacramento, CA",16,34,76,3.0,6/30/2016,"Back when BJ's first opened, I loved their food. Now, not so much..it's actually the last place I'd go. Good place to catch a game at though if you get there early. But the only reason I really still ever go is for their pazookies! I haven't been in a while so not sure if they still even have it but their s'mores one was the yummiest dessert ever!"
Crystal T.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,4,,1.0,7/19/2017,By far one of the worst experiences I have ever had in a restaurant. It took 10 minutes to be greeted and another 10 for our waters. We ordered pizza and salmon. We had to ask for silverware and pre-drops.  My boyfriend ordered a side of brussel sprouts with his salmon and he was charged the appetizer price. Our food was cold but since at this point we had been there an hour we didn't want to say anything. Our server tried to make up for our terrible experience with a free dessert. Wasn't worth the 25 minute wait. It was cold and hard. It wasn't even just our server that was less than stellar but every other server who was working. 7 servers walked by our table with plates stacked up and plates on other tables without cleaning them up. They clearly had their sections and that's all the cared about. I work in a restaurant and attitudes like that is a big reason why we probably had a less than enjoyable experience. Never again will I return to this establishment. A waste of a nice date night sitting in BJ's for over 2 hours.
Sammy N.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,24,11,5.0,7/9/2017,"We went for a dinner and got Jalapeno burger,calamari and chicken wings. The burger was a little dry at first and then Brandon W. Replaced it with a better batch. He was very accomodating and helpful, Cody was also very nice and always checks on us. I am extremely pleased with the service and and the food. Not to mention the burger was taken out of the bill.  will definitely be back."
Greg S.,"Elk Grove, CA",1,12,2,5.0,2/7/2017,"I don't understand people with 1 star reviews for restaurants like BJ's I been coming here for the last 7 years and service always good, yes you'll have one pons time something doesn't go well but overhaul this place is good, some people cry over get wrong order or something like that so what it's like they always perfect."
Susannah L.,"Elk Grove, CA",47,30,1,1.0,11/6/2016,"Before meeting a bunch of friends at BJ's, I called to see if they used MSG in their food.  I get horrible headaches, feel dizzy, and get sick to my stomach when eating this food additive.  The woman on the phone said they used none.  She answered so quickly that I was suspicious and asked the waitress when we got to  the retaurant.  She checked with the chef and told me that I could have only plain chicken and brocccoli.  My husband ate calamari and tortilla soup and got a horrible headache all the next day.  We don't want to go back.  In addition, the place is loud-it's hard too hear the people right around you.  Ugh!"
Aicha N.,"Sacramento, CA",2,4,,5.0,10/15/2016,I often come here with my boyfriend and although there was a long wait it was totally worth it! Most of my experiences here have been pretty good but today was the best. Our server Paige was all around great! She made sure to check on us frequently even though it was pretty packed. She was so incredibly friendly and made sure to chat with us. If we could have her as a server every time we would. Food was great with even better service. Definitely will be back soon.
Jasmine S.,"Sacramento, CA",0,12,,1.0,2/3/2017,Didn't really feel welcome. I walked in with a group of 8 of my cousins celebrating their mothers birthday after her passing.. the host was friendly but the wait staff instantly rolled their eyes as if they didn't want to deal with us. Won't be coming back..
