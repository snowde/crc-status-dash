Maria C.,"Elk Grove, CA",8,10,4,5.0,11/16/2016,"We came to Bjs as a group of 12 and wanted 3 different tab and was expecting just ok service but AJ change that perception, best service we got, he's friendly, patient and polite.  Definitely be asking for AJ each time we are here"
Rondayn S.,"Elk Grove, CA",24,68,10,2.0,6/2/2017,Normally one of my favorite places to eat. But today not so much. It took 30 min to get our appetizer then my salmon came uncooked. I sent it back and it came back worse than the first time. The waitress said the manager would be over but he was a no show.  I ended just eating appetizer and ordered a pizookie. Sadly no salmon which is why we came to BJ in the first place! They did comp the meal I never got and dessert.
Nicole Shad R.,"Sacramento, CA",115,9,,5.0,12/18/2016,One of our favorite places to eat. We stayed in a hotel next to BJ'S for 2 months when our house flooded. Bj's became our kitchen. The employees new us by name and would have our order ready for pick up promptly. Thanks all for your great service.
Chris W.,"Melbourne, Australia",118,13,3,3.0,12/16/2016,Not bad for a chain. Seems so busy most of the time. The service is good and the food was fair.  My son likes the burger and fries..
Natisha R.,"Elk Grove, CA",21,50,76,1.0,4/24/2017,"I had placed an order online, and it said my order would be ready in 20 min. I decided to go 15 minutes later than the time promised just to give them more time since it was a Saturday. When I arrived, my order was still not ready, and the employee did not even have the courtesy to apologize for the inconvenience. In fact she had an attitude the whole time she processed my transaction. While my promised time was 7:45, I arrived at 8am, I had to still wait for my order for another 30 minutes. After  30 minutes of waiting I decided to go talk to a manager, and explained him the situation. The manager instead of apologizing for proving the worst service ever, had the decency to ask me for my email address so that he can email me a coupon. Like honestly dude, you think we are that desperate for a cheap coupon or free food. I turned him down and just asked him to give the food I ordered. The manager himself does not seem to live up to customer service, ethics, and professionalism, so how can we expect him to manage his employees. While I had originally given BJ's a full 5 star; however, majority of the  reason I give restaurants receive 5 star is mainly because of their service. Well, today BJ's did not match up to its service, it was the worst most terrible service I'd received; therefore, I am giving this place a 1 star just for their food, but a zero star for service."
Gregory S.,"Lodi, CA",34,127,16,4.0,12/6/2016,"We have been to the Elk Grove restaurant several times and will go back again. Service can be a bit slow but never so slow that we have been unhappy with it. The wait staff has always been pleasant and, sometime, entertaining. The menu is varied enough that I can always find some thing I like at that moment. What I like most are the hours. BJ's is open later than most of the restaurants in the area so it is a good place to go at the end of the day. If you a wandering around the Elk Grove area late in the day wanting good food, visit BJ's."
Mimi G.,"Elk Grove, CA",2,61,2,5.0,8/30/2017,i'm obsessed with their mojitos! its sooo soo good! can't taste the alcohol and then i'm drunk! love their spicy jambalaya! but the place is always so crowded i hate goin there as there is always a 30 min wait
Courtney H.,"The Pocket-Greenhaven, Sacramento, CA",23,1,,1.0,9/2/2016,I dont even want to give one star to this review. After the experience I have had at this location I will not be back to dine in or even order pickup. My boyfriend and I were enjoying ourselves and our dinner until my boyfriend pulled a huge piece of plastic out of his mouth from his mashed potatoes. Our waiter sent the manager over and I am appauled that anyone would hire someone so rude as the head of their customer service. He never apologized and he was extremely unpleasant to the both of us. I have never been spoken to like that by anyone let alone a manager! I come from a background of working in resturaunts and customer service and its unbelievable to me that he would even handle a situation this way. Won't be back ever.
Sahar Y.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,4,2,5.0,12/1/2016,I love coming to this Bjs! Today we decided to bring my mom for her first time here and we had a few complications at the beginning but Sammy (manager) and Vanessa (server) made sure that we left the restaurant happy! Sammy even gave us free pizookie coupons for our next visit! Thank you guys so much for your nice hospitality!
Katrina F.,"Elk Grove, CA",552,232,446,4.0,2/12/2014,"This BJ's is so much better than the one in Natomas.  This Elk Grove locations is always clean with friendly waitstaff and the good food. The servers always make sure you watch your step when entering the dining area and are typically good about asking if you are ok with the table you are being placed at.  We hit this place up after Arena Cross this last weekend and Joanna was our waitress. She was great! She was attentive and gave great beer recommendations!  BJ's overall is a 4 out of 5 overall, my only complaint, hence the 4, is I've had them forget to put an appetizer in more than once. Otherwise a great place for food and drinks with friends!"
S T.,"Monrovia, CA",611,51,208,3.0,4/3/2015,The atmosphere of this restaurant is wonderful but unfortunately the service always sucks. Excellent BJ's favorite pizza is amazing! But the Alfredo with broccoli and chicken was sort of Dry I rather get a salad then to eat the pasta! The dessert menu is so good ice cream and cookie how can you not
Sonia S.,"Walnut Creek, CA",59,1,,1.0,9/30/2017,"If I could give a negative 5 for a review I definitely would. We came here for my graduation and after waiting 25 minutes my name was called for our table of 7. When I went to the host (Ashley) for my seat I was asked to wait another 5-10 minutes as they didn't have the menus /utensils ready. I waited and once my name was called again I was seated at a roomy, booth in the back near the mirrors. After my remaining party arrived we were asked by the waitress (Lindsay) if there was any way we could relocate to another booth as there was a person who had a reservation and it was their birthday and they sat at this particular booth every year. Out of kindness we were ok to move and Lindsay told us our appetizers and bazookies would be free for the inconvenience. It turned out to be a falsification that a party requested that booth for their birthday; this was said in order to get us to move because of an error made by the host (Ashley) of incorrectly seating us. On the way over to the other booth, my friend slipped and fell on the floor onto her back and hit her head on the floor. The wax on the restaurant floor was uneven and even those of us wearing flat shoes felt the floor was slippery. All the diners around were absolutely shocked yet no one came to even help. Not a single waitress came for at least 2-5 minutes (this is all on camera). We were told a manager (Morgan) would come by to take care of us. Morgan's attire matched that of the other waiters so we had no idea that she was a manager when she came to check on my friend. Morgan offered an ambulance, initially my friend declined because she wanted to try to sit down and see if she felt better. Immediately, Morgan came out with an incident report (we find out later that someone falls almost everyday at BJs), which probably explains the speediness of the incident report delivery. After about 15-20 minutes an ambulance was called to check on my friend because she felt dizzy and was in pain. The ambulance said the charges wouldn't be covered and that cost would need to be worked out with the restaurant. Another manager (Stuart) had came out to check on us and told us the cost of the ambulance would be covered. Mind you, we have another waitress (Kalani) by this time. Kalani asked us in an angry tone why we had called the manger over to our table and it had nothing to do with her, she wasn't aware of the fall as she was just handed our party as one of her tables to serve. Our new booth was crowded, in the dark and near the entrance and we deeply regretted agreeing to move tables. Once we told Kalani that our friend had fallen, she informed us that the waiters wear non slip shoes. When the ambulance arrived, the paramedic even commented that the floors are slippery. Kalani tried to serve us food while the ambulance was present and we asked For her to take it back as we are dealing with the paramedics. Once we rejected the food, Kalani gave our party a really dirty look and walked away with a really unprofessional attitude. Stuart (manager #2) came by again but argued that he was doing all that he could to take care of us and we expressed otherwise. Stuart himself told us that people slip and fall all the time here and I asked him how that was okay or acceptable and ""what if it was an old person - they would have probably fractured a bone."" Stuart also refused to pay for the few drinks we ordered  because he stated CA laws prohibited him from covering the cost of the drinks. We all wanted to split the bill and he said ""what a mess!"" and I spoke up. I told him that none of this was our fault , it was their fault for the unevenly waxed floors, and instead of making us feel like a burden, it's the company's responsibility to keep paying customers happy whether it's 1 card or 5 cards that we pay with. I also told him that his team lacks communication and synchronization as the host's mistake lead to the shifting of tables. We had to ask him for our vouchers for the bazookies and as he walked away he made a comment under his breath of ""Oh, God!"" This was an absolute disaster and the poorest, most uncoordinated customer service I've ever experienced at BJs."
Karen N.,"Sacramento, CA",80,121,245,2.0,7/9/2016,"The bathroom was GROSS! All the garbages were overflowing, the facet I used was barely attached, and the soap spigot was totally just hanging there! I just don't get why there were SIX people at the Host Station, yet not one of them could have emptied the trash from the cans or from all over the floor. I totally expect to die of food poisoning next, but I was starving!!!"
Alicia N.,"Fremont, CA",1307,161,640,3.0,1/26/2015,I'm not a big BJ fan. Their food is okay . I would only go here if my friends decide to go here or if I'm craving their pizookie .  The macadamia but pizookie was so effn delicious !Actually all their pizookies are but my favorite is the macadamia nut one . I would give this dish 5/5  !
Mia-Aurelia A.,"Cottonwood Country, Sacramento, CA",58,81,53,4.0,9/6/2016,"I have had consistently positive experiences at BJ's, though the Laguna location is the one I dine at most often. BJ's does tend to garner a wait on evenings, especially during the weekend, but you must remember that it's only places in Elk Grove open past 10! The menu has something for just about everyone, it's spacious, and there's a bar, so why wouldn't it be popular? Anyway, the service is always friendly and attentive for the most part--it can get very busy & a water glass may go unfilled for a while, but alas. The food is tasty. I like the turkey club with those crispy thin-cut fries. The gluten-free pizza is really bomb--you don't need to be GF to enjoy it. My favorite item is the bone-in chicken on the appetizer menu & I sometimes order it as a meal. The only miss has really been the baked pasta, which was on the salty side. Pizookies are always good, though I'm still annoyed the company did away with the apple crisp one. I like the salted caramel, though. Overall, the Laguna BJ's is great & I will continue to visit."
Anterica S.,"Sacramento, CA",1,12,6,1.0,5/20/2017,So I just did curbside service and because I wasn't parked in the designated parking area and didn't call the number to let them know that I was here I kind of got reprimanded for it the problem that I have is that the curbside service parking spots are full of people who are eating inside of the restaurant so there was no where to park I go ahead and I order my food and I specifically put that I'll be in the handicap parking spot because the curbside service is full and I'm told well I didn't get it so next time Park in the curbside service and call the number well you don't have to worry about it being a next time cuz I'm not coming back out to this BJ's oh let's not forget to mention that it's 91 degrees outside.  I've never had anybody be so rude It's upsetting and frustrating because it's not my fault had I known that I would have tp desl with the parking I would have gone inside and order my food so this will be my last time being here probably might want to go to the one in Natomas or any other BJ's for that matter. Food is great! Just won't do curbside!!
Cato Takho K.,"Sacramento, CA",148,28,42,4.0,6/7/2015,"This location has one of the most crowded yet efficient way of organizing and seating folks. Sure you're crammed next to another party of 10.  But never did our server forget to come check on us or refill our drinks. Very nice service.  Date night with the girlfriend after work. She got the Barbados chicken atop rice pilaf and beans sprinkled with feta and I got the parmasean crusted chicken.  Her's was good but mine was better.  Their parmasean crusted chicken is one of their best item ever!!!! Very moderate in health. Roughly +/- 1000 calories. Comes with 2 crusted chicken breast resting over a scoop of parmasean mashed potatoes topped with a drizzle of melted parmasean sauce and dices sun dried tomatoes and chopped basil. Very well priced and this goes great with their hefeweizen. This place is well organized, speedy with their food and really good customer service. Only reason for the lack of 5 stars is because we were seated next to a huge table of 10 and there was an overwhelming sense of claustrophobia.  But will visit again. When it isn't THAT busy."
Jessica L.,"Lacey, WA",2,40,95,5.0,3/11/2015,"Came here on a Saturday night to celebrate my friend's birthday. The place was packed and we had to wait a little before getting a table, but it was definitely worth it! The atmosphere was great and our waiter had a nice sense of humor! I got the Atlantic Salmon with no veggies. For dessert, I ordered the pizookie (chocolate chip with vanilla icecream on top)! Ohmygod, that thing was heaven!  If you come here, be sure to check their pizookie's out!"
Cecy A.,"Sacramento, CA",0,1,,5.0,11/16/2016,Tonight our server Vanessa was fantastic she made sure she got our order right and always checked on us ! Thank you Vanessa.. Always ask for Vanessa!
Mayy V.,"Sacramento, CA",0,2,,1.0,11/13/2016,Most terrible customer service ever!!!!!! The manager of this place needs to train his/Her employee better than this.
