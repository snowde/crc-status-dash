Kasie W.,"Elk Grove, CA",151,181,89,5.0,11/22/2013,"I am a BIG fan of this location! The Place: is always clean, organized and crowded-- which speaks volumes! I've also noticed several regulars, which means that locals are so pleased with the service they receive, that they continue to come back. The Service: has always been great. In fact, a month or so back, I called ahead to order for pick up. The gentleman I spoke with was very polite and friendly. He also took down my order perfectly, because when I arrived, it was ready to go! The Food: always seems to impress me, given that BJ's is such a large chain. Their food is consistently good, regardless of the location (I also frequent their restaurant in Sacramento/Arden Fair Mall.) I love their Ahi Crunch Salad so much, I order it every time I go. Their Santa Fe Spring Rolls are just. . . well, they're just my favorite. Ha."
Bill M.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",19,65,22,4.0,8/23/2016,"I had to make to emergency hotel stops right next door .. Going back and fourth.. Good service, great food.. I would love to give them 5 stars.. It's so crowded, long waits (not their fault)... But it's also so loud it impossible to relax.. With that said.. I order a lot of food as I had just come from a 4 day vegan wedding and I pretty much went hungry.. They cured that... Great service.. Good beer.. And i can't break it all down. I had a specialty burger with fries the first night.. When I returned.. I had a dinner salad, a bowl of soup, 3 appetizers, 6 beers and an amazing steak. I am to tired to remember the cut.. I really just can't think.. It was the highest end one the have,. All of it great.. Thank you for feeding me ..."
Michael N.,"ANTELOPE, CA",16,109,5,3.0,9/15/2016,"I went here for appetizers and dessert with my mom,  sister and son.  We came around 9pm--they were not very busy.  The servers were friendly and courteous.  The timeliness in receiving 3 appetizers was substandard.  I could have walked to Mimi's Cafe, ate, come back and still be waiting for my food.  This wait was unacceptable.  Then we ordered dessert and had another long wait.  If you want quick service, do not go here.  Bring your laptop or things to do to pass the time."
Cass G.,"Galt, CA",49,24,36,4.0,3/24/2016,"Love coming here whether it's for family birthdays yummy dinner or just soup and salad for lunch. Yes they are busy and some what crowded, but it's because it's worth the wait. Ribeye was way salty one time but that's my only complaint in multiple visits. Service is always good. And they are great for brunch lunch dinner and yummy desserts."
Katie G.,"Austin, TX",237,621,399,5.0,11/20/2015,"I am the proud wife of a Veteran and any business that thanks them for their service is A-OK in my book!  I felt the service on the day we went was spot on. Our waitress was very attentive and kept checking on us throughout the meal.  Food was pretty good for a chain restaurant. My hubs is really into the little greek tacos they offer. I tried the cold quinoa salad and it was delicious! I'd eat that by itself.  I ordered the fish and chips. The fish was nicely cooked and the breading was good. I didn't like the tarter sauce, it had thick cut pickles or something, super overpowering. Get the thick cut fries and a side of honey mustard, yum! There's a sweet and salty kind of vibe going on.   We passed on dessert and all that jazz. The servings are big enough for 14 people so I had tons of leftovers. I left the fish and took the fries. Pro tip: reheat them in the oven at 425F, or under the broiler if you dare!  Thanks for giving back to our Veterans BJ's Brewhouse. It was really fun to see all the cars in the parking lot with the different service branches on them. And of course, the older people who were talking to the younger Vets in the bar area, that was special. ESPN was showing videos of service men and woman surprising their loved ones, there wasn't a dry eye in the place!"
Alex R.,"Sacramento, CA",4,1,,1.0,5/29/2017,"Ordered a combo pizza and was told it would be ready in 20 minutes, so I get there 25 minutes later paid and I am told that it will be a few more minutes. 40 minutes later I receive a cold over cooked pizza with hardly anything on it. Top it all off the cashiers were rude and somehow smug."
Lydia S.,"Elk Grove, CA",34,53,34,4.0,2/12/2016,Despite the pitiful appetizer and subpar sides - we HAD to go back for the steak once again.  This time the service was phenomenal and  Our server brought back our sides exactly how we asked for them to be prepared.  He was also on top of refilling my water (4 times) while the last time we came it wasn't refilled at all.  Not so sure we will explore the menu on future visits but we are positive the steak will NOT disappoint.
John S.,"Folsom, CA",1,7,1,1.0,8/2/2016,Terrible service in the bar area at this location by one of the servers that just had no customer service skills. Not sure what they are doing there to teach their servers to do their job.... To be of service. Now How hard is that. Never again at the Elk Grove location.  We ended up just paying for the one drink and leaving.
Christina C.,"Sacramento, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/1/2017,"I've been here 3 times, and all 3 times, the food has either been just plain bad or medicore. The waiters always seem to have some kind of passive agressive attitute. Once they forgot my food altogether and I had to remind them, so I ended up being served 15 minutes later than the rest of my table. Asked for a plastic bag to put our boxes in multiple times and sat waiting for so long before we gave up and just asked the front desk. Everything is overpriced. It just isn't worth it."
Daniel J.,"Orlando, FL",23,63,116,5.0,7/14/2016,"5 stars for the pizza, especially the deep dish pizza. The mini is a tad small so i usually go for the small which is a few inches larger but a decent size for one person. I've frequented the Gainesville location in Florida several times and I've gotten the deep dish so i have high hopes for the Sacramento location and I was very pleased with the results. My meat lovers small size was tasty as expected. The wait staff here was also very courteous and attentive. With no complaints regarding taste and service, this location earns five stars, not to mention it was still packed when we went for lunch on a Friday."
Tien N.,"Sacramento, CA",0,20,23,2.0,3/26/2016,"It was a long wait because I went on a Friday/ over the weekends (was about a 40min wait). I was kind of disappointed of the ravioli, I began digging in and there was no meat at all. However, when I got to the bottom of the tray, there was so much meat. I'm not sure if $15 is worth for pasta. I feel like it's just because of my food choice. The service was alright, not the best because they were pretty busy."
Johnny G.,"Sacramento, CA",0,3,,1.0,1/16/2016,"Service was terrible, and the food was terrible. To start off, I ordered their To-Go ""classic rib-eye"" which I ordered medium rare, and was served to me almost well done to the dryest extent. My sides were the asparagus and fries. The asparagus was as thin as toothpicks and the fries which seemed to be sitting under a heat lamp for hours waiting for someone to order was stuck together. Absolutley disgusting. To acquire overated BJ's food, i ordered it 40 minutes in advance on their website and when I get there, I end up waiting behind ""1"" guy getting 3 small pizzas. My server was named Nick and he had curly hair and glasses. He took at least 20 minutes to help this guy out, huddled with his manager and two other employees talking and laughing on this one computer screen, like the intro to the old scooby-doo where there reading that book. (keep in mind there was two computers). Totally unprofessional, and you can get better service at the Mcdonalds across the road for 1/3 the price. I was not aknolwedged that i would be helped out (even if it would take longer). i wasn't even looked at!  Finally, the guy leaves and I get to Nick. He gives me a sigh and a tired, ""hello... name"". Like im inconviencing him by being there. At this point I just wanted to get this food and leave. I tell him my name is John, and I give him my gift card and a ""VIP"" card to take 20% off. And for some reason Nick wasn't trained on how to swipe a card into the machine, and has me wait around 10 more minutes so he can grab his manager again and work this ""VIP"" card. They need to fire this guy or train him on how to be an appropriate server, because it seriously needs work ASAP. I waited around 35 minutes trying to get this crappy food from the crappy staff there. Word to the wise at BJ's. Train your staff and fix your food because your restaurant is seriously overrated."
Nebal Y.,"Galt, CA",54,7,8,1.0,10/9/2016,"If I could give this place no stars I would. Now let me tell you, I am not picky and it is extremely easy to please me. I also don't believe in writing bad reviews but this is how upset I am. Yesterday (10/8/16) I orders curbside to go at this bjs. I live down the street and was tired my boyfriend and I just wanted to bring the food home. I wish I would have listened to all the people warning me not to order to go from here. . We show up at 9pm when we picked out good to be ready, our total was about $42. Gave the nice girl $50 and told her to keep the change. We got home.. put on the movie and opened up our containers. Our food looked like it had already been eaten, stepped on and thrown away and then put back in the to go container. Remind you we have dinned in so many times here and have had an awesome experience and always enjoyed the food when we dined in. We were so shocked but I was starving and wanted to give my burger a chance. I ordered just a plain burger with cheese. I paid for that. The burger had no cheese and a lot of lettuce, pickels and tomatoes. The fries were wedge, weren't all the way cooked. My boyfriend order the pasta Parmesan chicken and the chicken wasn't cooked so he just ate the pasta. The Egroll appetizers were super soft. Not crunchy like a egg roll at all like we have experienced in the past. I was up all night my stomach hurt so bad from eating barley have that burger, It was bad meat. I called the following morning 10/9/16 right when it opened to talk to the manager, Vanessa was nice. Then she said she was busy and passed my off to crystal and then crystal said she would give me my money back but has no proof of purchase . Wow. What? I ordered it online. She said she can't refund me because I had no proof and they had no record of my transaction. Finally she ended up giving me $45 in a bj gift card. I didn't want that. I just wanted my money back. I got sick from it and threw it away. Don't ever order to go here. They seriously don't give a care at all about to go orders. It's true."
Pai T.,"Sacramento, CA",0,24,3,3.0,3/19/2017,The food and beer selection has always been great. My issue has always been with the wait time and how long it takes to order and receive my food.  It always irritated me on how busy and understaffed this place is
Pu B.,"Elk Grove, CA",123,491,2117,5.0,2/1/2015,"This place gets 5 stars for service the waitress served my table, which was a party of 10. She made sure our tables water was filled up everytime and kept asking us if we were doing good every 5 minutes. Now that's good service. She also brought us 2 pazookies for free because it was my brothers birthday. My family ate chicken wings. Flatbread pizza, carne fries, baked chhicken, a bj brewhouse bacon burger, chicken bacon ranch pizza and some others i forgot. The oreo pazooki was on point"
Jade L.,"Elk Grove, CA",249,57,792,3.0,11/13/2014,"Why haven't I reviewed this place?!  The service is always excellent. They're super nice and the right amount of attentiveness.  For happy hour, there's a pretty hefty beer selection which is cool.  I go here with my coworkers for lunch (at the Folsom location) and I usually order the unlimited soup and salad: Wedge salad and Tortilla Soup. Mmmm! Now dinner for me has been hit and miss at the Elk Grove location. I would like to start with saying...I miss the pot roast!  Whhhhyyy did they take it away?! I've ordered calamari on two different occasions both times it was bland. I added salt and pepper and it was tons better! The order came out fast, but the batter wasn't cooked all the way. Whompwhomp. Same thing with the pizza. Maybe it was a rough night in the kitchen...? I've ordered the Black and Bleu burger, cooked to perfection! The seasoned shoestring fries, not so much. It was lacking seasoning and the fries weren't crispy.  I'm not a fan of inconsistency, but I keep going back expecting it to be the awesome food from my memory. Maybe it's new management? I don't know, but I'll stick to lunch and lowered expectations."
Tina N.,"San Jose, CA",1007,671,6490,4.0,5/21/2013,"We got seated immediately and we got to put the appetizers order in... Ordered: - Appetizer Platter - Chicken BBQ Pizza - Salads - Chicken Noodle Soup - Seafood Perfect Pairing - Mahi Mahi (6oz. blackened or grilled) and Parmesan Crusted Scallops (Roasted and topped with garlic bread crumbs, melted Parmesan cheese and diced tomatoes in a lemon Chardonnay butter sauce) $15.95 - Pizookie Trio Tina's Tips and Tantrums - I didn't see how much it all was or taste everything since my order was a mouthful of food - Mahi mahi and rice was a little dry, but with lemon it tasted pretty good - Parmesan crusted scallops were flavorful, and my favorite on my plate - Pizookie is always the best. We got peanut butter, oreo, and chocolate chip. My favorite was chocolate chip since it wasn't too sweet or chocolatey. - This location is so spacious! It's bigger than any ones I've been to - Our server, Brook, was quite awesome. She got our drink refills, checked on us constantly, and catered to us"
Michael C.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,10,9,1.0,10/17/2016,"The wife Ordered take out from over the phone at 5:22pm on 10/12/2016. Ordered 2 items and they advised her it should be ready in about 15 minutes.   I got there about 5:34 and talked to the cashier at the Pick up desk and she asked the name on the order and then gave me a price of the order. I paid with a card and did not leave a tip because I have not yet have any service. She then advised me it would be out shortly. So I waited patiently sitting there til 6:08 before I said something because this was pissing me off. I then asked a different worker what's going on with my food because I've been waiting for over 30 minutes and she went to go check and brought it right out.  I then asked to talk to the manager to complain how horrible the service was and he advised me that they will work on that.......Food was lukewarm and I only live 2-3 minutes away, not even a mile away.  Waited 40 minutes after they advised me it would be ready....   Honestly, I feel that the cashier seen that there was no tip when I originally paid and ignored my order."
Patrick S.,"Seattle, WA",83,55,101,4.0,2/20/2015,"I come here occasionally. I have a love-hate relationship with BJ's, but mainly love. I always get avacado egg rolls and they never disappoint when you're dining in. Decided to try their curbside service this time. The avacado rolls were slightly soggy but still delicious nonetheless. First time trying the carne fries, they were surprising tasty but probably wouldn't order again.  As for other appetizers the spinach artichoke dip is one to try. I've had their broccoli cheddar soup twice, but the second time around the taste was slightly off. On another note I tend to try all their chicken dishes, I suggest the southwestern chicken (I hope that's what it was called). And it's a must to get a pizookie, any flavor will do... They're all mouthwatering! Plus you get a free mini on your birthday! As for servers, great customer service. There has never been a meal where I was dissatisfied with the staff. And kudos for the BJ's reward system!"
Stephanie S.,"Sacramento, CA",211,201,772,3.0,1/10/2016,We mainly come here for the appetizers. Their menu has changed and a few items have been taken out and added. Buffalo wings and tortilla soup are my favorite here. The customer service is a hit or miss that is why I give it 3 stars.
