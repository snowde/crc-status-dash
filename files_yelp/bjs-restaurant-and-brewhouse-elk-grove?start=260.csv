Mike D.,"Long Beach, CA",23,20,40,4.0,4/11/2016,Im not a huge fan of their food but its always a good environment. Great place to come for drinks and appetizers. Good place to come watch the game as well. They have a very nice TV setup at the bar.
Dina L.,"Sacramento, CA",35,15,1,2.0,9/1/2016,"My most favorite dish here is the Santa Fe salad with grilled salmon. I ordered for curbside pickup tonight. Service was good as far as the young lady that took the order, brought the order out, and took my payment.  They added a garlic knot at no charge which I appreciated. The salad on the other hand was not good tonight. The salmon was baked and greasy instead of grilled and delicious and was just bland. I guess I'm not supposed to know the difference and since it is to goThe salad was small in comparison to every other time and there was no avocado in the salad. Last the dressing was watery like they were running out and added water. So disappointed in my dinner tonight."
Angel C.,"Elk Grove, CA",262,25,49,5.0,10/19/2015,"Great quality food. Friends & I ordered a pizza ( half great white half Hawaiian chicken bbq) delicious. I also ordered their signature cocktail drink the strawberry splash, which as also great."
Doug H.,"Ben Lomond, CA",0,4,,5.0,10/8/2016,"Had the best time there on a busy Friday night. Party of 11, one of us gluten free, and everything was just perfect. Brussel sprouts for appetizer, drinks flowing. At the end, our waitress effortlessly split the tab."
Momo K.,"Elk Grove, CA",1,6,6,1.0,2/23/2017,"Ordered the North Beach Mahi and Shrimp and it was beyond nasty! The fish stank so bad and it was freezer-burnt! Couscous were over-cooked! YUCK!!! I'll stick to the appetizers next time - at least they can't get that wrong, one could only hope!"
Shaquila D.,"Sacramento, CA",1,41,,2.0,3/10/2017,It is now 945 and I am just getting home from bjs mind you I live literally 5 mins away. I just ordered two baked potatoes with broccoli and chicken and it literally took over 40 mins to make. Normally I am quite angry when I have to wait to eat but at that I'm pregnant and my child is probably more angry then me. After telling the cashier that the baby I'm my tummy is upset he said I'm sorry well one of your potatoes is done did you want to eat that whole the other one is done. Uh no I ordered take out not take out but eat in the restaurant. Idk I guess I expected more compassion when I told them how they were kinda not just starving me but also my little person and they didn't seem to really care. Don't get me wrong they said sorry but it wasn't an apology that I felt was real. I originally asked for my refund and was about to just leave but magically my food was ready. No point of starving the rest of the night I let them keep the money and left. Bjs may have just lost one of their regulars.
Lori M.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,8,,4.0,10/13/2016,"The food is always good, and have had great experience with staff.  Just bring your patience with you, because it is typically real busy, but worth the wait."
Omar P.,"Pacifica, CA",1,11,1,2.0,10/31/2015,"Alright so I'm here on Halloween eating dinner for my gf bday, and well yeah it's. Wasn't good. We waited 30 min for someone to come and ask for our drinks and about 45 min for someone to take our order. The appetizers were good but when it came to the main dish of mine I asked for my burger to be well done. And well it wasn't. My gf food came out great. What sucked was I had to give them my plate 2 times the first was because the frys were stale. Than my burger was cold. And than the third time my meat wasn't well done. I'm very disappointed."
Yin Z.,"Florin, CA",20,2,90,1.0,7/31/2016,"Call in for to go, the lady said 15 mins. I went in after 30mins. It was really busy, the host just told me to sit n wait. I went up there to ask how long it needs to take, They said they don't know, all they said was SIT and WAIT!!!! They didn't even ask my name for the to go. I'm like what the heck, what kind of service is that!!!! Never go back again. Really bad service!!!"
Danny G.,"Sacramento, CA",300,57,113,3.0,7/14/2015,"I came here on Saturday July 11th and to be honest was pretty disappointed. Even though BJ's is in an area that I frequent I still don't come here very often. On this particular trip I was actually pretty disappointed with my visit. First off, when our drinks were brought out to us our waitress just placed them on the table and walked away. Suffice to say, we didn't know who's drink was who's and needed to do a taste test in order to know. Luckily, we were all family so germs weren't a huge issue. The next thing we noticed was that our chicken wings were not steaming hot. Yes, the outer crust was fried well but the temperature of the chicken meat was lukewarm. Within 30 mins, the 4 of us started to get slight stomach aches. I'm not saying it was because of the chicken but the only thing we ate were the wings and the 4 of us were not complaining of stomach issues until after we ate the wings.   This visit wasn't the best, I have had better experiences at this BJ's before I began yelping. I'll chalk it up to a somewhat busy Saturday night and write up a follow up review on my next visit."
Kurt C.,"Sacramento, CA",694,407,2176,4.0,7/6/2014,"I've been to this location too many times not to review it.  Consistently good service. They do a great job maintaining the restaurant's casual yet sophisticated look. I always see a diverse group of people dining in, which is an indicator that they are very welcoming of any race and age group.  Jerry Burst! If you drink alcohol, try it. It's one of their beer and cider blends that I happen to be a fan of. It's Berry Burst cider and their very own house brew, Jeremiah Red. Good aroma of caramel malts, full-bodied, and a bit of hops to it. Taste like it smells, but more robust.  For my main course, I ordered from one of their enLIGHTened entrées -- the Maui Glazed Pork Chop. It was perfectly grilled, tender, with a little kick from the sweet and tangy sauce. It came with steamed green beans and oven roasted red potatoes.  And, of course, if you've heard of BJ's, you know to associate them automatically with their famous pizookie dessert. It's almost mandatory to have them at the end of your meal here. We got the trio this time with Salted Caramel, White Chocolate Macadamia Nut, and Cookies 'N' Cream. Great option if you can't decide on one!"
Nichole R.,"Sacramento, CA",181,119,40,3.0,6/28/2016,Went here last night. We went for a birthday it was busy for a Monday. Was seated quickly our server was attentive but was a bit slow and kept forgetting the items we asked for but overall wasn't bad but not amazing! My son ordered fettuccine Alfredo which is his absolute favorite! I ordered the flat bread pizza which was just enough for me! My husband ordered the ahi tuna salad which was amazing! And to top it off we tried the monkey bread dessert which was beyond amazing!!!!
Wingyung Y.,"Elk Grove, CA",1,37,67,3.0,8/27/2016,"My boyfriend and I had a dinner date here on a Monday night. I got the balsamic glazed chicken which was bomb. I definitely recommend that dish! We also got a great white pizza which was delicious. The service was not so great though ): Our waiter was not around much at all. We also got a chocolate chip pizookie for dessert. So, if you want pizza.. come on Mondays for half off pizzas! 2 stars for our food and 1 star for my chocolate chip pizookie :)"
Bruce S.,"Elk Grove, CA",235,361,2174,2.0,11/4/2014,A few months ago we received 2 $50 gift cards to BJ's. We went in 3 times for lunch to use them up. No reason to return again as this place is nothing special and the service isn't good. Their prices are high also. They make their own beer so why do the prices start at $5.00 a glass and go up? Not a good deal. All three times we ate there all our order came out at once. Not the appetizers first like we expected. Twice it seemed like we sat for quite a bit before our food came out. Once we got it the food was good enough. The last time we went in we had $13.00 left on the gift card so that means the first two visits averaged $43.50 each. That's too costly for lunch and we will never go back. My Wife had visited another BJ's previously and got sick after eating the calamari. We never would have gone in the first place if we hadn't been given the cards as a gift
Ida H.,"Sacramento, CA",978,1009,10894,4.0,11/4/2012,"Ever since a BJ's opened in Elk Grove, this has been a favorite place of mine.  And even though it is a favorite, I haven't been able to eat here as often as I would have liked.  I have come here on several occasions and always enjoy the food, the lounge/sports bar, and the atmosphere.  Just sitting at the bar is nice and I have fond memories of hanging out with my girlfriend, splitting some appetizers.   While the menu offers a large selection of meals that will satisfy any appetite, including specialty salads, vegetarian and gluten free.  I was happy to see that they also have a section called ""Enlighted Entrees"".   This is where they keep the lower fat and calorie dishes - under 575 calories!  After careful thought, I chose the Creole Tilapia.  Our waitress was great and gave useful information that helped me with my decision.   It was a good choice, that had perfectly oven baked Tilapia topped with a salsa style sauce, seasoned rice, and a mixed green salad.  The flavor was there and satisfied my hunger sufficiently.  I felt like I could eat this huge amount of food and still comforted in the thought that it was all low in calories!  I was expecting a spicier version of fish, because Creole is used in the naming of this dish.  But it was still something that I would definitely order again!   We got very attentive service even in the middle of a shift change.  Three different servers (one in training), made us feel welcome with friendly smiles and pleasant small talk.  My boyfriend and I enjoyed our dining experience.  In the past, we would consider coming here for dinner, but then drive past when we saw a line at the front door.  But on this occasion, I was gently reminded that this place is huge inside, and accommodates a large crowd.   I don't think this will be a deterrent for us anymore!"
Jenny M.,"Elk Grove, CA",58,29,36,1.0,11/16/2014,Been here for 15 mins and no one has came to serve us yet . Usually the service is great here but I don't know what the hell went wrong tonight .
Laura K.,"Sacramento, CA",1,14,1,4.0,5/14/2016,"I come here often because my boyfriend craves their jambalaya with chicken, shrimp, and sausages! Last night we ordered online and expected to pick up on the curbside. But they actually stop doing curbside around 9 which I don't mind so I went inside to pick up the food. I ordered their jambalaya, ahi poke, and a Caesar salad! Totaling to around $31 dollars.. The weird thing is whenever we order ahi poke during dine in, we only get a few cubes of avocado which is such a let down. But when I ordered through takeout, they gave so much avocado like how I expect it to be with the ahi poke. Maybe I should order more through takeout! Lol Usually when we dine in we ask for Daniel to be our server, he's amazing! If you plan on dining in then ask for him!"
Mikaella W.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,94,8,5.0,5/16/2016,"An excellent restaurant the food was amazing, my favorite is the Mediterranean pizza combined with the pyramid hefeweizen beer.  I only had 1 problem at this restaurant chain in the last 10 years or so at the Arden location in the mall the large pizzas were placed too high on the storage shelf and the yeast didn't rise correctly and the pizza came out flat but the manager at the time remade our pizza free of charge, even in a bad situation BJ's did amazing customer service.  I recommend everyone eat here."
Mamie K.,"Elk Grove, CA",56,186,661,2.0,6/21/2015,"We hadn't been to BJ's in a while & decided to head there for dinner one evening.  As we thought, it was crazy busy.  Lots of people waiting (inside & out).  We only had a table for 4 that evening so we thought it should go a little quicker.  We were told it would be about a 30 min wait.  So not bad considering it was a Friday evening.  As we were waiting for our table, they brought out some pizza for people to nibble on. I looked around as they were seating people.  It was a little odd, noticed quite a few tables who were empty & sat empty for almost 20 minutes before they would seat people.  Not sure if they have new managers.  But noticed some of the booths which could easily seat us were being held for larger parties like 5.  This is a little odd considering the last time we had gone they told us those booths were too small for us & was only for parties of 4 or less.   After waiting for the 30 minutes, we finally got buzzed.  They took us to our table which was in the far corner of the restaurant.  We were seated and the server came over almost immediately to take our drink order.  At the same time, we place our order for an appetizer - Calamari. We received our drinks and shortly after placed our food order.  The calamari came out shortly.  As it was placed on the table, we just stared at our order in a little shock.  For the price, it seemed like 1/2 the order was missing (portions have definitely shrank).  Not sure if we will be ordering it again.  As we sat there staring, we were also looking at how we were going to eat our appetizer.  No place settings at all.  So I had to wave down the server to request napkins and utensils.  Soon after our order came out: Caifornia Flatbread Pizzas:  can't go wrong with flatbread pizzas - very good Ahi Tuna Salad:  lots of pepper on the ahi tuna; a tad bit too spicy - didn't realize there was smidges of wasabi on the sides of the plate, definitely gave the tuna a kick We did have to wave down our server several times to get our glasses filled with water.  Water glasses sat empty a little too long.  Not sure if it is a new policy on only filling the glasses with water if requested by the customer.  But they did not check on us to see if we needed additional refills.  I know they were busy (they did have a quite a few large tables).  Just felt service was subpar.  Not sure if we will be going back soon.  Our visits here are seldom due to the service we receive.  So will give a new review the next time we go back."
Alex H.,"Sacramento, CA",389,67,89,1.0,8/2/2014,"The quality of this BJ's has really gone down since it opened. Not only the food, but the service as well. This review is based on the past three experiences I've had here.  The food has been very mediocre and takes forever to come out. The pizza especially has gone down in taste. They're very bland and doughy tasting. My last order of BBQ Chicken came out luke warm. My calamari appetizer came out chewy. Their Chicken Fried Steak was less flavorful than in the past and they consider a few sprinkles of corn as a side of vegetables. The pizookies here have gotten ridiculously sweet to the point where it's very hard to eat more than a few spoonfuls. It's pretty disappointing.  The service here when seated is pretty good, but I've found that they tend to need reminding and don't come around that often. My water was left unattended on multiple visits and my beer and condiments i requested almost never got to me. One of my servers started completely ignoring me after I got my food. He walked past our table time and time again without saying a word. I had to flag him down to get his attention. I definitely wouldn't recommend this place to anyone and I doubt I'll be coming back."
