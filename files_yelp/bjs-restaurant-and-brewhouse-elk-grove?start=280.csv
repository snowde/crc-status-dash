Lenny B.,"Upland, CA",36,3,,5.0,8/25/2016,"Food and atmosphere was great. The best part ofi the whole night was Vanessa. She was very helpful, patient, and persoanble. She made the night a lot better. So yourself a favor and sit in her section!  ,"
Searcy A.,"Sacramento, CA",765,27,5,1.0,4/27/2016,"Ultimately the worst service I have ever received at this restaurant !! The waiter was so inattentive that it made no sense ! Went 30 minutes with no refills and then not even being checked up on !! Once our food did come the order was completely wrong , he did not even offer to compensate . This will be the last time I ever visit this restaurant !!! I recommend that you find somewhere else to dine ."
Ashley C.,"Sacramento, CA",394,782,4199,4.0,5/27/2014,"There's a ton of options here, so it's a good place for groups because everyone can pick what they like! It's also a good idea for groups because you can just buy a few pizzas and split everything. Their pizzas are awesome (I like great white and BBQ chicken) but their other food is great too. Avocado egg rolls, california club sandwich, thin cut fries, hawaiian mahi mahi, you just can't go wrong! It's a fun place for birthdays too, just make a reservation whenever possible. And on top of that, the pizookies are the best. They introduce new flavors every so often but every flavor I've tried is so good. I like the pizookie trio because you can pick 3 flavors if you can't decide. The pizookie party platter is also a smart idea if you are with a group of friends looking for dessert :)"
Justine F.,"Sacramento, CA",0,7,,5.0,8/20/2016,Had my daughters 16th Birthday here and ore arranged to have the girls dine alone  From the reservation and special table set up by manager Sam to the amazing waitress-ing by Kelsey the girls had a phenomenal night!
Gina G.,"Stockton, CA",89,58,1194,5.0,6/9/2015,"Today I had the unlimited soup and salad and April had the Balsamic Chicken over greens and broccoli. The tortilla soup is so good and creamy!  I love the fresh avocado they put in it. I also tried the cheddar broccoli soup, or should I say cheddar soup with tiny bits of broccoli?!  It's all good!  The mozzarella tomato balsamic salad is refreshing!  They have the best homemade balsamic dressing ever!  April enjoyed her balsamic chicken except she said they could've glazed the chicken breasts with the balsamic dressing rather than drizzle it on. Other than that, our meal was quite enjoyable especially due to the wonderful service of our server, Taylor H. He was very nice and friendly and kept the food coming without having to sit around and wait. I hope to get him again next time we are in the area!"
Julie K.,"Sacramento, CA",2,122,32,5.0,6/24/2016,This review is for Kristen B our waitress for tonight.  She was very attentive and delightful.  She provided great service for my friends and I's dinner tonight.  For a new employee she did an excellent job!
Drew O.,"Sacramento, CA",46,163,472,4.0,5/31/2015,"When here for Mom's birthday dinner at around 4:30. It was already crowded, but no wait, at times there can be a long wait. We started with the avocado eggroll appetizer. Cooking the avocado really brings out the nutty flavor of the avocado. The dipping sauce was a little too sweet for me. I had a dinner salad, nothing special. For dinner I ordered the deep dish BJ's Special Combo Pizza. It was excellent. The dough was light and airy like puff pastry, a pleasant surprise, not what I was expecting. The toppings were not oily or greasy and the red sauce was tangy. For desert we shared a S'mores Peanut Butter and Ice Cream dish. There's no way one person could eat that, and I'm still buzzen from the sugar rush. Service was spot on, even with a shift change of wait staff. The food came out at a good pace."
Jennifer N.,"Sacramento, CA",581,458,1084,4.0,7/5/2014,"Food: Lunch special  - BBQ lunch platter: A pulled pork slider and chicken breast. Comes with a side of crispy‑thin or wedge‑cut seasoned fries and coleslaw. The platter looks huge in the picture but it's a lot smaller in person.  -- Pork slider: tasty and tender. 3.5/5 -- Chicken breast: had good flavor but was slightly dry. 3/5 -- Potato wedges: nicely seasoned and crunchy. 4/5  - Strawberry splash: Grey Goose Vodka, Disaronno Amaretto, Piña Colada Mix, and Strawberry Puree topped with a piece of pineapple. Refreshing and light. 5/5 Service: Friendly. The wait was surprisingly not long. I had 3 different servers during my lunch. 4/5 Final thoughts: I like BJs. Everything I've ever had has been good. They have a huge variety of selections to choose from. There's something for everyone."
Neelu M.,"Upland, CA",0,4,,3.0,1/23/2017,Manger is super awesome and soft spoken woman. But staff specially name is Jason very rude and misbehave man.
Jonathan S.,"Sacramento, CA",48,1,,4.0,8/14/2016,I've been to bjs multiple times and it has always been nice .Everyone seems like they want to be there and really chipper.The food was really good and the employee Jennifer W was very friendly nice and attentive my favorite so far .
Kristen B.,"Elk Grove, CA",144,106,50,3.0,5/28/2015,"I recently went here with my family to have an early birthday celebration for both my parents, since all my sisters were back home, which is very rare nowadays. When we walked in, the parking lot seemed fuller than the inside of the place. We were seated right away at a booth directly across the big screen, showing the Warriors game. Fasho! Even though we already knew they lost, it was nice to watch the game too. I don't remember our waitress's name, but if I had to guess, I think it was Norma. Anyway, ""Norma"" was SUPER nice and just how people in the retail/customer service/restaurant business should be! She took our orders, and my family and I just chatted amongst ourselves and watched the game til our food came. I ordered the bison burger. Since my previous experience with bison burger, at another restaurant, was a big fail, I had to see if it really was a big fail, or it was just because of the situation. Since the bison burger was in the lighter menu, the portion isn't as big as your typical burger. It also had a side of colesaw. The burger wasn't too bad. It didn't amaze me though. The colesaw, same. It didn't amaze me. However, my dish DID fill me up halfway through. If you have a small appetite, I suggest you order from the light menu. It's cheap and portions are just enough to fill you. The downside to our meal was that my sister ordered the pork chop from the light menu as well, and it came with diced potatoes. One of the potatoes was still frozen in the middle. We didn't tell ""Norma"" because it was just ONE potato, but this is just an fyi. Check to make sure your food is thoroughly cooked before digging in. Other than that, everyone enjoyed their food. My other sister, mom, and dad ordered salads, but suckers are HUGE! Kinda wished I got a salad instead. I wish I had room for a pizookie because those things are BOMB.COM! I think I saw that they do 3 mini pizookies for some set price. I think I would do that one day :) Overall, food was just eh, but our waitress, ""Norma"", was excellent! Friendly, patient, and super nice! Thanks ""Norma"" for making our parents' birthdays a nice one :)"
Dan C.,"Sacramento, CA",0,1,,5.0,2/5/2017,"Came to BJ's for a Birthday dinner with friends on a Friday night. The food lacked seasoning but Nadine was an amazing server that made the experience good. She was patient, interactive, and understanding."
Sac M.,"Sacramento, CA",39,180,426,5.0,7/2/2015,One of my favorite spots all their food is great sometimes service is slow because it's busy but for the most part their friendly love the atmosphere I'm a regular for sure
Mary N.,"Elk Grove, CA",152,61,8,1.0,6/23/2015,"The service that was given to my and my friends on a weekday at 2PM was quite disappointing.  Honestly, it was pretty busy, so I made sure to be quick as I could with my order. Our waitress did not come visit our table until maybe 15 minutes later. But that's not the worst part. After she took our order, our food didn't come until 30 to 45 minutes later, but our food came out lukewarm to cold. We didn't complain about it because if we had to wait that long for our food to come out, we wouldn't be out of that restaurant until 4 or 5PM.  A different server gave us our bill and we quickly sorted our money. And again, our waitress did not come until 20 minutes later.  Our food would have been amazing if it was served to us right when it was done being made. Our service was just terrible. I am honestly really disappointed on how they were functioning that day. I hope when I come back in the future, their service will be much better because I really do enjoy their food."
Consuelo B.,"Sacramento, CA",66,16,25,5.0,7/4/2015,This is a great place to dine when you don't know what you want to eat. There's something for everyone!
Michelle A.,"Elk Grove, CA",61,87,365,3.0,4/24/2015,No complaints this time about our visit last night. We arrived 5pm on a Thursday evening and we were seated right away. Our drinks and appetizer arrived on a timely manner (shocked!) even our food! The waitress didn't forget about us either.
Jasmine C.,"Sacramento, CA",324,254,3110,4.0,5/22/2014,"Just went there yesterday, first time trying their onion ring that was really good, stuffed mushroom that was good and newest appetizer corn fritter that was ok. Mother in law love their ""Red"" beer. Scallop dinner need bigger scallop and the portion was small for dinner."
Anisa G.,"Elk Grove, CA",70,6,1,4.0,6/18/2016,"Ordered a turkey burger and two house salads for take out. The turkey burger was great! One salad was ordered with Italian dressing. Instead, we received both salads with ranch. Overall good experience because the salad was still good with ranch. Only downside is that we were eating in the car and had no utensils or napkins, and ranch instead of Italian."
Gina H.,"Fair Oaks, CA",0,3,,5.0,1/3/2017,My fiance and I just moved to the area from Roseville and came here to watch Sunday night football it seemed chaotic since it was new years day but we ended up finding a seat in the bar pretty quickly. We ended up having Vanessa as our server and she was absolutely awesome she was super friendly right off the bat and took such good care of us all night it felt like we've been friends with her for years! Give her a raise :)
Marcie H.,"Newport, WA",0,9,2,1.0,1/3/2017,We had a late lunch on January 2nd and the food and service was TERRIBLE. This is the second time we've had a bad experience at BJ's in Elk Grove. My soup was cold and the burgers came out without fries as they were still cooking after 45 minutes. Just an awful dining experience at a restaurant I used to love to visit. We spent over $75.00 for 3 meals and appetizer and feel like we were robbed.
