Joanna C.,"Elk Grove, CA",51,1,,5.0,1/22/2017,"Enjoyed dinner tonight, primarily due to the outstanding service provided by our waiter, Dominic P.   He greeted us with genuine warmth and professional friendliness.  He was attentive and excellent in his job. Made our evening and dinner one of the best we've had at BJ's  - even with having to return our hamburgers. He went above and beyond to make our evening enjoyable. Would return just to have the good fortune of being his customers."
Allyssa P.,"Elk Grove, CA",174,145,376,1.0,8/25/2014,I have been to this BJ's many many times but never late at night until tonight.  I arrived at 9:30 and was told it was self seating for two and a server would be right with us. our drinks arrived instantly but it took the server 20 minutes to return up my table of 2 to take are orders and she had made eye contact with my boyfriend multiple times and instead of taking our order she ignored him.  after ordering it took 20 more minutes to receive our four appetizer sliders and a mini pizookie.  needless to say the service has been declining since they have first opened.
Gary M.,"Elk Grove, CA",3,58,39,1.0,9/20/2014,"Not even seated yet and I'm disappointed.......my wife likes this place I can't stand it but being nice cause it's my nephews birthday......we'll see if they've made any improvements in staff and food quality since my last visit.......they have seated a party of 20, 4, 4 and 6 before our party of 7......1 hour later still not seated...... ~:/"
Joseph J.,"Elk Grove, CA",47,37,86,4.0,9/19/2014,Who doesn't like Bjs?  Bj's pasta and burgers are my personal favorite. The prices here are a little closer too 15$ and up but they are not stingy with their portions at all!  And for dessert don't over look their pazookies!  The only down side is that you usually have to wait at least 10 mins to be seated.  All around a great place for everyone!
Lou M.,"Antelope, CA",170,66,11,1.0,7/2/2016,"20 minutes! 20 whole minutes passed by without being acknowledged by our server. There was a server acknowledging and helping every other table except ours! It wasn't until my wife finally got up to ask another server when and if we were going to be helped. She said ""your not my table unless they switched it up there"" she checked and it ended up that she was our server! 25 minutes have now passed! We were ready to leave until the server apologized and said she would ""expedite our order before everyone else's order"" to make up for waiting. I'm still here, we'll see how the rest of the night goes. Will update ASAP after dinner..."
Andrew V.,"Lodi, CA",0,101,60,5.0,3/29/2017,"Ok this is going to surprise you because it shocked my wife and I. First the wait. When someone calls ahead 35 minutes in advance you shouldn't tell them to wait an additional 20 minutes and try to tell them that the current wait is 50 minutes but yet didn't bother to mention that on the phone when someone calls ahead. Final wait one from call to sitting down was 72 minutes so the hostess needs to be talked to. I was expecting the food to be standard Bjs quality but I was surprised at the quality of the ribs. Ok so this server was amazing and saved the day for BJs. I was going to leave a one star review but this was one of if not the best experiences at the table I've ever had. I ordered a rack of ribs with a wedge salad and soup as my sides.  We also got an appetizer and two kids meals plus pasta for the wife. The beer came out followed by the appetizer then the sides then the kids meals then our meals and finally the pazooki. The timing of everything was perfect, drinks never ran dry and he was super nice. Such a good experience that I called the manager over to let him know this guy saved a bad experience and turned it into a great one. Enjoy that heavy tip too buddy because you earned the s#%^ out of it."
Gretchen Q.,"Milpitas, CA",185,193,24,3.0,7/19/2015,The alcohol came out quickly. The girl visited our booth a couple of times. Service can be a hit or miss. I ordered the Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms. The ones in Arden are way bigger than the one here. I was pretty disappointed.
John L.,"Sacramento, CA",0,4,,3.0,1/12/2017,"Wet and damp day, but I get to take my son to lunch. One of his favorite restaurants, BJ's on Laguna Blvd. Never disappointed with a meal there or the servers. Our server today was Michael M. and as usual made my son and I feel very comfortable and welcome. He helped offer suggestions for lunch and brought our beverages promptly. He had a great professional demeanor and appearance. I enjoyed my lunch but...you know how first impressions always stick with you? My son and I entered the brewhouse around 1:30..there was no hostess or greeter. OK. They're busy. A young man made his way up to the hostess stand. Looked at us said ""two?"" I said yes, and we followed him to a booth and took our seats. Gee. It would have been nice to have heard Hello, Welcome to BJ's, how's your day...something. I felt put off. Perhaps he was filling in for the hostess? When I have guests I welcome them and greet them and make sure they feel at home and are important to me. He seemed cold. Such a shame. I had a great server, enjoyed lunch and my son's company..I don't see him often enough... But I came home thinking about the person I first saw after I walked in the door. First impressions are lasting impressions. A smile and a warm welcome sure would have made lunch perfect."
Kaitlyn D.,"Carmichael, CA",0,2,1,1.0,6/22/2016,"I ordered on the app a caprese piadino with fries, and a half flat bread and salad combo. They have a BOGO coupon for lunch so I ordered 2 lunches, I'll save one for tomorrow.  Anyways, I got to the restaurant at 11:40 am.. My food was suppose to he ready at 11:45. I DID NOT GET MY FOOD UNTIL 12:17! I work across the street and work alone and have to close my store to grab lunch really fast, hense why I ordered on the app so I can just run and grab something really fast and come right back.  THEN I get back to work. My flat bread was COLD, the salad dressing was wrong for my salad, and I got the wrong piadino( ordered caprese but received chicken bacon ranch). The only good thing was the fries which are pretty hard to mess up... I order to go from the BJs at least once a week and it usually is not an experience like this! I'm very disappointed."
Robert S.,"Lodi, CA",0,10,17,3.0,6/19/2016,"Food was Good waitress was GREAT,  appetizers were excellent. Food came out Fast and timely  overall atmosphere is nice  only issue was the hostess gave us major attitude... BUT everthing else was so good!!"
Dillinger B.,"Shingle Springs, CA",0,4,,1.0,1/6/2017,"Ordered take out 3 times from this location. Food was horrible each time. First order was triple decker, was hardly any meat snd fries were stale. Second was wedge salad, asked fir dressing on side they forgot it. My last  order avocado egg rolls. They were burnt and soggy. The avocado was brown and looked more like mash. They were so spicy no one could eat them. .  Work nights and we order as a group. We are limited on selection. I will not waste another penny. Not sure what the food is like when you sit and order but take out appears to have little to no quality control."
Brittney D.,"Elk Grove, CA",14,14,61,4.0,7/30/2015,"Always super super busy, all day long. But honestly, worth the wait. Been here a couple times and their pizza is sooo delicious and of course the pizookies! Can't leave BJ's without having a pizookie!!!"
Denise W.,"Elk Grove, CA",49,128,84,1.0,6/18/2014,My mom and sister had my bridal shower here.  Had 15-20 people and did one of those deals where you preorder everything. Waiter took forever to get us drinks and kept asking us if we wanted to order yet.  We kept telling him that our order was in and that we preordered. Told him again what we ordered.  This went on for about an hour and a half before it sunk in and finally brought us a damn salad. Basically the worse service EVER. Pizza was good.  Salad was good.  Pasta... ew.
Monica C.,"Sacramento, CA",1247,451,5677,1.0,3/3/2015,"I usually have an "" ok"" experience when I'm here with friends for HH or for a dinner party. ""Ok"" because I'm usually too distracted by conversations and alcohol to pay attention to the service and food. It's another story when I'm not with friends and when I'm actually not drinking. My experience lastnight is a perfect example . I woke up from a nap feeling hungry and sick . We all know that when a girl is hungry and not feeling well, you shouldn't do anything to piss her off. Well, I decided to do what mr. Stoppelman did but instead of searching for a dr, I actually was looking for a place open for some soup . While Mr. Stoppelman came across the fabulous idea of yelp out of his curiosity, I came across Bj's brewhouse using yelp :) They were open and I thought clam chowder and a baked potatoe sounded like a great idea. I then call to be placed on hold for 15 minutes . I think that's the longest I'd ever been put on hold and I was already annoyed . To make matters worse, I come in to pick up my food and get ignored ! Clearly there were employees standing there not doing their job but instead talking up a storm with each other. So, I had to wait 20 minutes to finally get some help which was another annoyance . Last and final annoyance ? I come home and notice my potato looking ugly with dried vegetables on them . If you look on the menu, it says it comes with Alfredo sauce on top but it didn't even have any, leaving my potato and its dry vegetable toppings even more dry . Did you think I was done complaining ? cause I'm not lol after eating my soup, I almost swallowed a piece of plastic that was cooked in my soup . Thanks Bj's! I will most definitely not be returning ."
R Y.,"Elk Grove, CA",5,67,,1.0,2/27/2015,"Made a reservation for eleven people on Wednesday for a Friday night gathering. On Friday I called again to add another person and was told I didn't have a reservation. My original reservation was for five PM and I was told that the earliest I could get in now was 9 PM because they couldn't find me! What the heck! I escalated to the manager and he said that we would be squeezed in at our original 5 PM time but that we would be have to leave after two hours. My answer was that we wouldn't hang around as long as our order was taken and delivered in a timely manner. We all showed up at 5 PM, were seated almost immediately, then everything went to heck again. A couple of my group had special orders due to allergies and their food came out wrong! So, even though we hate sending things back, we did. It took quite awhile for. Their food to come back out. But, it was finally made correctly. Three in our group ordered dessert, two provokes and a small vanilla ice cream. They brought the check with the desserts added, but we hadn't gotten our desserts yet. We paid the bill, assuming that our dessert was on the way. Boy, were we wrong, it took two reminders to our waiter that we had yet to get our dessert. We ended up being there for nearly THREE HOURS! My advice, double check that your reservation is actually logged in their book, don't pay till you receive everything and obviously don't special order."
Anum A.,"Elk Grove, CA",311,148,416,5.0,1/23/2016,"So I have to update my review... I recently came in for a dinner party with a group of friends, and we were served by Amira. Her service was excellent. and the food was good as usual. We asked her about the menu, and she knew it well, and gave us suggestions. Nothing she suggested disappointed us! Everything was great. We tried a bunch of new things and thanks to her, have some new favorites at BJ's as well. She was efficient and friendly! I'll look for her next time I'm here."
Nga P.,"Alameda, CA",237,327,743,4.0,4/6/2014,"Last night I came in with a bunch of coworkers and our service was amazing! Our sever, who I didn't get his name was awesome! I never had a good experience at bjs before. Something always goes wrong, but last night my server did everything just right.  There was seven of us in a small tiny booth in the bar area. Our fault though. Someone decided that we all wanted to be side by side elbows to elbows while eating... We ordered plenty of beer, their berry cider was delicious. I got my usual clam chowder, which I'm in love with because everything else here is bland or salty. My party though got Alfredo, jumbolaya, ahi poke, and a pepperoni extreme pizza! Food took a little too long, or was I just really hungry? Our server made sure all our request was taking care of, I felt really bad because of how needed and complicated we were. Our server accommodated us and joke around with me till 1pm! Sorry I'm one of those who stay till closing."
Chelsea R.,"Sacramento, CA",165,62,345,4.0,3/11/2014,"I am clearly a fan of BJs regardless of what I actually say, because I keep returning. Granted...there aren't many choices in this town, but BJs offers a lot of variety, plus great late night happy hour! (Seriously. $4, $5 and $6 options for both food and drinks.)  Newer menu unveiled recently, with a ton more ""enLIGHTened"" options! Awesome. I have heard service can be iffy, but I just stick to sitting at the bar or in the bar area and we always have pretty good service. I don't much care for the cocktails here, too sweet, but I dig some of the beers (at a brewhouse, fancy that). The food is honestly nothing to rave about, but it's good and decently priced, with options to please anyone. I don't always love everything I try, but my staples are enough for me (California flatbread, wings, broccoli cheddar or tortilla soup, artichoke dip if I'm feeling particularly unhealthy...plus new items Mediterranean chicken pita tacos and kale Brussels sprout salad!). Bison burger is a great healthy-ish option for a burger lover like myself, and the mini pizookies are definitely a post-work draw for my girlfriends and I."
Thanh T.,"Elk Grove, CA",2,57,8,3.0,4/19/2016,"This is just my experience with service and not about food since they have so many varieties and I can't try them all. To me their food is average. Services usually meets satisfaction until you have more then basic questions or needs.  Mind you, they aren't extreme requests.   One of my recent visit, There was misunderstanding about the bill, I felt the server could've done better about trying to fix the problem, instead he acted irritated and acted like it was too late since the card was swiped. We all know we can void a transaction so I'm not sure why he felt it was such a hassle to do so.  That didn't sit well with me or my group.  My experiences from past visits, the servers don't pay attention to the table and forget us or our orders or refills.   BJs usually packed especially on weekends so I'm sure my review won't tarnish them, but I hope whomever reads this can agree that what makes a good server is more than taking your order and asking if you want refills.  I treat people with respect and only ask for same.  We don't go out of our way to make your job or life hard, we just want to have a great experience and everyone has their needs be it allergy or calories, or just understanding the ingredients on menu.   Hopefully BJs sets standards where their employees are happy to work for them so then they can be happy to serve us.  Ex) in n out n chic filet  It doesn't have to be 5 star dining restaurant to few like you are being serviced.  Check out pho Le, love their service everytime I come there."
Manuela T.,"Elk Grove, CA",72,3,,3.0,6/2/2016,I love going there but their take out has been a joke for me. I have called twice in a week. I get put on hold for ten minutes the first time. The next day I called I hung up after five minutes and then hung up and called back. When they answered I told them I had been put on hold for so long. She said she would let her know. The. It was another five minutes. I mean come on. That's too much.
