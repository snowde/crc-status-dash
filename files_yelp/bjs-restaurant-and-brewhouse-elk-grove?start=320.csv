danyle w.,"Sacramento, CA",60,155,85,2.0,3/20/2014,"BJs is mediocre at best.  Usually they would get 3 stars because they have a good beer selection and their food is okay. However, went here last week on a slow weeknight, around 9:45pm. Got seated super quickly which was great! Looked over the menu, made drink and food selection and then waited. And waited. And waited. No one came by to give us silverware, drop off water, or just a simple, ""I'll be right with you guys."" Plenty of servers walked by but no one acknowledged us. After 20 minutes of being ignored, we left... and I don't plan on coming back."
Jennifer L.,"Sacramento, CA",222,23,2,2.0,3/5/2016,"Didn't like the chicken Alfredo at all. It was dry and the broccoli did not taste right. I usually love chicken Alfredo no matter how it's made, but I was completely dissatisfied. Their chicken was also super bland. And I waited more than 45 minutes for it to come out."
Rick S.,"West Sacramento, CA",23,17,,5.0,5/4/2016,"We eat at this location a few times a month.  The staff is always great and the food is wonderful as well.  One of the reasons we love going there so much is that the staff actually remembers us and makes a point to say hi.  Our usual waitress, Kim, is a doll and can be found in the cocktail/bar area.  She is always so friendly and she always has a smile on her face.  The manager Vanessa is always so helpful and always makes a point to check on our table to make sure that we are good.  For someone that busy to take the time to make us feel important is a wonderful quality. Bj's is lucky to have them both.  It is people like them that keep us coming back again and again."
Nicholas H.,"Sacramento, CA",18,7,,1.0,5/20/2016,Terrible service and cold food at lunch today. Good cocktails though. Manager was apologetic and bought us all desert which was ok but still not the best. I wouldn't recommend.
Mackenzie D.,"Ennis, MT",45,1,5,5.0,1/30/2016,"Absolutely amazing! Best service I think I have ever had, Chandra was so sweet and amazing. She would be the reason I come back. Good was excellent"
Claude C.,"Elk Grove, CA",89,86,138,3.0,2/7/2015,Had a large group and they were extremely slow.  I could have went to the farm and raised the pig myself to get the pepperoni pizza.  I had about 29 seventeen year olds and although the servers were extremely friendly they could not understand my request to keep the pepperoni coming.  We had a lot of really nice pizzas taking up space.  I tried explaining to servers kids typically eat cheese and pepperoni and higher quality is more like punishment or something they will eat if there's nothing else.  Problem is they were told all you can eat and they were willing to wait until they got what they wanted and I was stuck.
Derek K.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,18,,5.0,9/13/2015,"Deep dish ravioli is insanely good. Meatballs however are all time worst. They have an aftertaste that is unfamiliar to me and thoroughly unpleasant, but omg this deep dish ravioli though!!!! Server is awesome. Menu is awesome. Black cherry soda is bomb. Highly recommend, just stay away from the meatballs."
Rachel S.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",1,7,2,5.0,6/2/2016,"We love this BJs! So fast and perfect food every time, even with customization. This is the third time in two weeks we have been to this BJs because we have been watching the Finals, and my goodness, Vanessa was the BEST server we have ever had. She was so attentive and fast, and so personable! I worked as a server for years, so I always want to appreciate a great server. You should definitely check this one out if you're in the Elk Grove area!!"
Paul E. G.,"Elk Grove, CA",1421,143,48,3.0,12/18/2014,Happy hour is the best time to come! Monday - Friday 3 pm to 7 pm  and Sunday - Thursday 10 pm to close
Alicia R.,"Elk Grove, CA",232,239,409,4.0,4/15/2015,The new watermelon and feta salad is AMAZING!  Seriously could eat one every day.
Mauricio V.,"Sacramento, CA",19,61,2,1.0,4/2/2016,"Normally I would give this restaurant a better review but this last visit was pretty horrible. Not a very good place for parties over 6 seeing as they only take reservations for parties 6 and under (makes no sense). If you do decide to come here with a party over 6 (we had 8), good luck! We had to wait 1hr and 40 minutes when the original ""wait time"" was only 30 minutes."
Nina T.,"Sacramento, CA",0,3,2,1.0,5/6/2017,fucking two hour wait and still dont have a table whats the point of coming here the food isnt even that good. bjs more like bs! too bad there isn't a 0 star option
Daniel R.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,2,3,5.0,5/6/2016,"I'm a regular here, great place, very good service, the food it's very good. My favorites things here are the Jeremiah red and the mojito. Food avocado rolls and slider, the pizza it's pretty good . The best option in Elk Grove."
Nancy G.,"Sacramento, CA",0,3,,3.0,5/26/2017,"Let me start by saying thanks to the manager, I believe his name is Sammy,  it turned out to be a better night then how it started. My family decides to celebrate our stepdad's birthday there tonight. We get there at 6pm with a party of 18. Of course we knew it would be a wait, we were told 90 minutes. So after 2 hours we ask how much longer do we have to wait the hostess tells us there's 3 parties ahead of us so maybe another 15 min. AFTER those 15min we ask again and she tells us we still have to wait, she has no room for us yet, and doesn't know how long it will take. So we ask to speak to the manager. He tells us to ""give him a few minutes he was going to sort things out for us, we had waited too long already""... He sits us in less than 10 min!!! The server was so attentive and did his best to keep up with so many of us. He took our orders right away and made sure our drinks were refilled. By the way manager even brought the kids appetizers so they wouldn't be waiting too long for food. The food didn't disappoint, I had the chicken Alfredo pasta and it was delicious. I love the raspberry lemonade.  If It wasn't for the very long wait and hostess giving us the run around I would have have them 5 stars."
Wolfgang W.,"Elk Grove, CA",2,86,5,4.0,3/13/2015,"Finally, we found a deep dish pizza that's reasonably good!  Overall, we enjoyed the experience and food."
Raul F.,"Elk Grove, CA",39,86,33,3.0,4/24/2014,"Came here with my hunny bunny on a  Thursday evening. It took about 25 minutes to be seated which was difficult to rationalize as there were many empty tables. Once we ordered it only took our food 5 minutes to get to us! That made the experience pleasant because it was after the gym and we were famished. Service was acceptable, not great and over the top and not tacky either.  TIP: don't come here on the weekend if you are hungry. You will wait like a starving slave till you see your bones protrude through you chubby flesh. Come any day before Friday and after Sunday.  TIP 2: look at the menu while your waiting to be seated. Urge your party to get the ordering out of the way and enjoy your fellowship."
James M.,"Folsom, CA",58,14,25,3.0,5/18/2016,"Good place, just always busy and sometimes the crew can't handle that."
Lynette D.,"Sacramento, CA",3,94,9,3.0,2/29/2016,All ways get clam chowder and salad.  There clam chowder has to be the best I have ever had.  This time on Valentine's Day went for deepdish pizza .  WOW terrible! BUT HELLO! Forget the food and take a look at the pictures in the Ladies bathroom.
Ashi C.,"Elk Grove, CA",138,731,1430,1.0,3/10/2015,"Back in college days, I loved this spot. But the food quality has gone down the drain.I use to love pizza and jamabalya but not anymore here. And there's always a long line. The beer is good here."
Kaylie P.,"Sacramento, CA",89,7,1,1.0,7/25/2016,"If i could give my review 0 stars i would. Mind you we got there with a middle size group at 9pm on a monday night. There wasnt really any reason to be there more than an hour and half. Well all i can say is dont ever get the waitress named stephanie s. One thing is she had an attitude to whole two and half hours we had to wait. When we got our food it was great besides mine and another person in the party. But i wasnt going to complain because i was already way to hungry. But when it took them 30 mins to come clear plates and another 35-40 mins to bring desserts on top of it being my friends birthday dinner was a little to ridiculous. Mind you at this point there isnt a big crowd and our server was no where to be seen along with having to speak to the manager twice and the manager finally clearing the last plate. We thought at least she had talked to her well it didnt appear to because asking for our checks three times and then having to flag down a busser along with talking to the front to get the manager back over it had already been 2hrs and 15mins. Then ontop of that we had seperate checks and she couldnt even get that right. Being someone who had worked in the restaurant industry before as a server when you have unhappy customers try to at least communicate. But when you cant even give me the correct number on how much im paying for my own food and add someone elses drink to my order after i had just seen my previous check saying 20 and it magically jumps to 33.... this doesnt sit well with me. Im sorry but after this incident i will not be eating here again. I will gladly spend my money somewhere else with customer service and give them a tip they deserve. As for you stephanie, no tip."
