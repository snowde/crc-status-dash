Joe Y.,"Elk Grove, CA",263,199,1570,5.0,8/26/2013,"First time here in a couple of weeks so we decided to have a pizza.  Ordered the hand tossed pizza consisting of 1/2 BBQ Chicken and 1/2 Five Meat gourmet. We tried the thin crust pizza this time instead of the deep dish pizza. The crust on the bottom could've been a little bit crispier but aside from that, the taste was excellent! Rachael was our server and she was attentive, very friendly, and nearby anytime we needed her.  I wanted a refill of my ice tea and before I could ask her she brought me one.  That is what I call great service!! B.J's is one of our favorite restaurants and we will return again soon......."
Regina R.,"Elk Grove, CA",99,80,6,2.0,2/4/2016,"So My cousins decided to bring me here on a Friday night to treat me for my birthday! Need less to say we thought of going to some place in downtown, however due to the weather we decided on staying local! I can definitely say that was a big MISTAKE! So it was a FRIDAY night and I know many places tend to get busy! So I called in and put my name on the list so when we got there we wouldn't have to wait as long! So I called about 4:45Pm and put my name on the list and I was told it would be about an hour wait, so i was like ok not bad since my cousin will be back in town by then. My cousin arrives before I did and my cousin was told it is still an hour wait when it was already 5:45PM. So she calls me and tells me and I was like ok lets go to a different place, although that didn't make sense to me at all. So we decide to end up going to apple bee's although our first choice was BJ's! while we are on our way to Apple bee's I get a text message that our table was ready from BJ's! So I hurry up and call them and let them know we are on our way! However noone picks up the phone! SO I asked my mom to call and I kid you not they answered in one ring! So that was a little odd! So my mom tells them we are coming they don't say anything! we were already in the parking lot so I drop them off and went to look for parking! Minutes later my mom calls saying she was told it's still an hour wait, although we waited for so long! So I was totally upset and din not want to dine here at all! I call and speak to the manager VANESSA!! and explained to her the situation and she kindly told me that we should not have been told we would have to wait another hour, in fact we shoulde been seated right away! She insisted we come back and I chose not to since I got the run around! I simply told her she can send me something via my email and I would kindly return, she took my info down and she still has not reached out to me! WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!!!! This was my all time place to come, however not anymore!"
Phyllis A.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,5,,5.0,11/7/2016,"Great food, great staff! These people got their customer service down packed! We eat here often, the service just makes the experience that much better!"
Molly A.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",10,27,4,4.0,1/28/2016,"We had great food last night and our server Daniella was great (very attentive).  Service from the kitchen was a little slow towards the end when we were waiting for our pizzokis, but it was a busy night and a bit to be expected."
Kirsten R.,"Elk Grove, CA",88,45,82,4.0,3/20/2014,"I don't think I'll ever have anything bad to say about bj's. It's pretty much the go to place to eat if you want something good, you don't want to drive far, and there's something everyone in your group could eat.  Pretty much everything I have ordered here I have liked. There was this one time when I ordered fried calamari at the Roseville location and it looked nothing like how I usually get it. Aside from that, everything is good. The avocado egg rolls are really yummy if you're a vegetarian. I usually always get the Thai shrimp lettuce wraps. I just sprinkle some lemon on that bad boy and I'm a happy camper. I've also tried their pizzas and I just think they are amazing. Most of the enlightened menus are pretty good. You can never go wrong any of the pizookies. The beignet is ok.. I would rather order a pizookie any day.  Anyways, just went there a couple days ago. They have a new menu. I think they added about 9 things? Not sure. I didn't get a chance to try any of them but the scallops and the kale salad looks yummy. Will have to try those on my next visit.  I finally tried the tomato and mozzarella salad that I have been eyeing forever. I loved it! Probably gna be in my top favorites salads every time I go there. Also tried the new salted caramel pizookie. It was alright. Wouldn't order it again.. The giradhelli chocolate on top was a little too much for me.  As far as drinks .. I'm not the best to ask. I'm not really a drinker but if I had to get a beer. It would be the cider beer, haha."
Amber K.,"Sacramento, CA",7,30,86,4.0,5/9/2015,"This BJ's is way better than the one at Arden Fair Mall. Came here today for an early Mother's Day lunch. The restaurant was already busy by 11:30am; luckily we were seated right away. It seems like they were short staffed. The busier it got, the longer we waited for our food. Our waiter forgot about us three times. We felt bad for him though, it looked like he was in charge of the entire bar seating area. I am never disappointed with the food, it is always fresh and tasty. We waited 30 minutes for our food, 30 minutes for our pizookies, and about 15 minutes for the waiter to give us our credit card back. Do not go unless you have the patience, because it does get pretty busy!"
Amo A.,"Sacramento, CA",0,41,4,2.0,8/22/2015,"Used to think highly of this place, but they've gone downhill the last few years. The service gets worse and worse. The food is still pretty decent but not a great value. Many of the staff don't seem to care about the customer. Almost like we're doing them a favour spending or money there. When it opened they were great. Not sure what happened, management change maybe?  Anyway, I'm done with them. I've been a casual diner here (few times per year, doubt they'll miss me) but there are better places in the area that appreciate the client a bit more."
Tiffany N.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",207,368,59,2.0,8/20/2013,"I came here after my graduation with my family to grab some lunch. We were seated pretty promptly, but after that we just got slow, slow service. I understand that they were extremely busy  - as always - but having been awake for about 4 hours with absolutely no food in my stomach, I was dying. My brother in law ordered the ribs, and the waitress came back to let us know that they were out, so he ordered steak (medium) instead. About 30-40 minutes pass and the waitress comes back to let us know that it will be about 10 more minutes. I ordered the Ahi Tuna Sala which really was just salad with about two thin slices of ahi cut into three pieces each. It was very underwhelming. Also, my brother in law's steak was about as well done and dry as it could be. At the end of the meal I ordered the pizookie which took about another 30-35 minutes to come out. For a cookie...with ice cream on top. Overall, I didn't have the best experience."
Angela B.,"San Francisco, CA",130,460,27,4.0,12/14/2015,"When I'm traveling for work BJs is one of those chain that I know I can go to and find something reasonably tasty and reasonably healthy, to go if I need it, and usually in about 10 minutes. The food is not spectacular, but it's better than average, and whatever you're in the mood for (salad, burger/sandwich, pizza, roast chicken, snacks, etc.), they probably have something that fits the bill. I've always had perfectly nice service."
Connie C.,"Elk Grove, CA",510,376,344,3.0,11/3/2014,"I still find this restaurant only 3 1/2 stars at best. The last time I was there I had an awesome server who was 4 steps ahead of the game. This time around, I don't know if it was the fact that it was a weekend night and busy at 5 pm, but service was not up to par. I may have been going with slightly high expectations but this restaurant has never disappointed me before. I tried making things super easy and only asked for a coffee and a side of fries. My fries were forgotten so my friend sat there waiting with me while her food became cold. I ended up having to suck on ice midway through my ""meal"" because I was out of water and she didn't come around to refill. I still enjoyed the food here so it wasn't a total letdown. It's really hard to resist those avocado egg rolls and pizookies...."
Amy L.,"Sacramento, CA",54,101,58,2.0,12/14/2015,"This place is a hit and miss for me. The building is nice inside and out, the parking lot is pretty big. I do have to say it does get busy in the mornings on the weekends. I've had pleasant experiences and bad. The pazookie is the best thing ever made and never had a bad pazookie. For the actual food, it's a different story, one time I had very burnt brussel sprouts on my dish. My boyfriend discovered a hair cooked into his eggs while eating. The wait and service gets really bad sometimes. Not all the time, but sometimes. I had one waiter that seemed new and was all over the place. We would ask for something and he would either forget or bring late, like really really late. I don't really go here often but it is a good restaurant for big groups of people. I feel like they tend to service a big group better than a couple sitting at a  small table. They do have a bar which is nice if you like drinking and watching sports."
Francine Y.,"Elk Grove, CA",267,82,146,3.0,11/13/2014,"I really enjoy the service every time I come here. It's a great place for group gatherings and they open late at a reasonable time (past midnight on weekends I believe). Their menu doesn't appeal to me very much but I typically get the Cajun shrimp pasta, fried calamari appetizer, potato platter thing...?, and maybe a pizookie if we have any more room. I love ther beer choices here. My favorite is the berry burst cider. Fruity cider, if you're into that kind of thing. We started using the rewards card. I use the key ring app so I don't have to carry the card on me. After several points, you have the opportunity to get free food, and etc. it's a free card so why not! Free complimented pizookie when you register your card too mmm"
Helen H.,"Sacramento, CA",386,1335,3155,3.0,12/28/2011,"Not the best service but the food was better than I expected. I'm not a calorie counter but looking at the amount of calories in select dishes stopped me from ordering them. A friend ordered the Ahi Poke. It had green and yellow onions topped with diced avocados and served with crispy wonton chips. It was delicious but the wonton chips broke easily when you use them to scoop the poke. I like how they have a snack and small bites section on the menu. It's perfect for those who aren't looking to eat an entire meal. I ordered the Fresh Mozzarella and Tomato Salad which had basil, red onion and Parmesan cheese drizzled with balsamic glaze. Light and fresh! I could've eaten two of these and not feel guilty. I've never had a Pizookie before, so I really wanted to try it. I shared the Pizookie Trio with two other girls. I went with the Red Velvet Pizookie which contained white chocolate chips and is topped with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. The cookie was too sweet. It was also chewy and I had a hard time scraping it off the deep dish. The best part was the ice cream."
Ann B.,"Elk Grove, CA",336,75,71,3.0,2/14/2016,"Over priced, mediocre food.  The service was just ok.  We haven't gone back to this location.  If I'm going to pay a sterling price, I want gold service!"
Jav L.,"Sacramento, CA",0,16,1,5.0,3/12/2016,"Came back still here.  Finally got Daniela!  Shes awesome.  So i just turned 21 last month,  wanted to try new drinks, she  recommended the jalapeño cucumber Margarita,  was different,  but would definitely get one again! Nd her service is always great."
Al S.,"Diamond Springs, CA",862,112,587,3.0,9/16/2015,"I usually enjoy my experience at BJ's and this okay. The food was wonderful and the service was fantastic! So you may ask why only three stars? Here is my answer! When I go out to dine and we were with some friends you are wanting to relax and have a conversation and there was about a thirty minute stretch that we were interrupted by every employee at BJ's if we were okay. Great service is not ""over-performing"" at your job. I felt like every-time we were getting into our conversation I had the entire ESPN Sports News Crew right there: ""There goes Al he has four inches from his mouth with two more sliders!"" What took the cake for me was when I went into the restroom it was ""Blown-Up"" on several different levels. Overall - Not bad but not my greatest experience at a BJ Brewhouse!"
Jen Y.,"Elk Grove, CA",7,144,66,2.0,2/13/2015,"If it was just based on this last visit, I'd rate them at 1 star. To be fair, though, I've been there before and it was never this bad. We had a Great White deep dish pizza and a Double Deluxe burger.  The pizza came out with marinara sauce, even though the menu said it was alfredo. So, I told the server and she told me that ALL of the pizzas come with red sauce as the base. There's alfredo in there, too, really! Okie doke. I'm not sure if their menus say that, but it didn't say anything about red sauce online at   For most people, this wouldn't be a big deal, I guess. I just don't like red sauces in my pizza, and it's jarring to get something you weren't expecting. On top of that, the cheese wasn't fully melted and the whole thing came out cold. The burger was supposed to come with all sorts of toppings, but we asked for it was just burger, bacon, and bun. They forgot the bacon. The burger was SUPER dry. The ""crispy"" fries were cold and limp. The server wasn't very helpful. She seemed kind of put out by us when we told her our complaints and didn't do anything but bring out a little dish of lukewarm bacon."
Binh N.,"Sacramento, CA",0,2,3,1.0,4/16/2016,That service here is just absolutely terrible. They took an hour just to make a damn sandwich. My momma makes better sandwiches in 3 mins. Come on now bruh.
Sing S.,"San Antonio, TX",7,5,51,4.0,4/29/2015,"The food is good from everything  I really like baby pork ribs,  and friendly service here will be back again ^_^"
Amber W.,"Sacramento, CA",118,16,14,1.0,4/13/2017,"This was the worst experience I have ever had at Bj's, and I am a faithful customer.  On 4/11/17 I made a reservation for lunch at 11:30 for 15 people for 4/12. When we arrived, there was no reservation. The young hostess who told us there was no reservation was not very helpful and almost rude. We let her know that we were in a hurry and had to get back to the office, yet she showed no sense of urgency to get us seated. When we were finally seated, we were put into an area that had no hostess. Another 20 minutes passed and I ended up flagging someone down to find out who are waiter/waitress is because at this point we still have not even been served water. After another few minutes a waitress named Selia shows up to our table  and apologizes to us saying she just started her shift and doesn't know why the hostess sat us in a section where there was nobody to help us. We explained to her that we had already been waiting for almost 50 minutes and were in a hurry. She was professional and took our order quickly, making sure our food was a priority in the kitchen. The free dessert they offered us at the end of our lunch did not hardly make up for the horrible service we all experienced. I hope that management reads this review because the service this day was completely unacceptable and we will probably not be scheduling another business lunch at this location."
