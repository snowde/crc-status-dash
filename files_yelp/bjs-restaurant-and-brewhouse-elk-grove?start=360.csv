Rebecca A.,"Elk Grove, CA",66,81,22,3.0,1/20/2016,"Came in tonight to celebrate my promotion I received today. It was pretty packed for a Wednesday and service was super slow. Everyone else at my family got their food first and we're done before I got my food. My beer I ordered was almost warm and took a while to get. The fries were pretty stale too. Never had an experience like this tonight and I've been here quite a bit. My preference if the Arden BJ's. Though service was pretty slow and food wasn't so fresh or great,  our waitress gave me a free salted Carmel pazooki for my promotion! I love bjs but idk what is up with the place tonight!"
Dawn N.,"Plymouth, MN",67,16,2,4.0,4/12/2016,"We love BJs because the atmosphere is nice. The beers are yummy, and the food is bomb! We recommend the Asian chopped salad and the jalapeño burger. If you like steak they make s good one as well. The only thing that sucks is that it is so popular that even on a Monday I have had to wait 20 minutes or more for a table but that's what the bar is for right?"
Erin C.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,5,2,1.0,12/24/2015,"Every time I come here, I'm always the last to get my food. Customer service is not good and the only good thing about this place is their pizza and pizookies."
Carlos G.,"Daly City, CA",35,73,2,2.0,4/22/2015,"food was horrible! how do u mess up a burger having access to premium produce? Very cold fries, almost as cold as my waiter. never again. go to fives guys better burger, great fries and way friendlier people"
Shelly T.,"Sacramento, CA",0,21,,1.0,10/8/2016,Today was super poor service. We used online app which is suppose to make things easier but it only confused the heck out of everyone on their staff including the general manager. Luckily AJ came on shift and saved the day. Thank you AJ for being an awesome waiter with mad skills. #greatful
Thao V.,"Sacramento, CA",576,33,18,2.0,1/21/2015,"Yo! It was my friend's birthday and I was planning it... we had around 10 people coming in on Friday's night (6:30PM) so I decided to put in a reservation beforehand. I called ""24 hours ahead with the minimum of 7 people"" to reserve a table. They said to come within 15 minutes or else my tables will be given away. So on the day of, I came at 6:33PM to get my reservations.. first they said there were no reservations under my name.. like WHAT!? I argued saying I did called and spoke to the manager so she said okay, we'll waiting for some tables to clear first.. around 20 minutes later, we asked why it was taking so long and they said they have to go based on the waiting list (and we ended up being on the waiting list without them telling us from the beginning) so THERE'S NO POINT FOR PEOPLE TO MAKE A RESERVATION IF YOU DO NOT INTEND TO USE IT!!!!  Food is alright, not worth waiting 45 minutes to an hour for."
Dennis K.,"Elk Grove, CA",3,51,,1.0,9/21/2014,"For the life of me, I cannot understand why this place is crowded. After a 30 minute wait, we were seated, our drink orders were taken...and then we didn't see the waitress again for 45 minutes...and this was only after we had another waitress track down the manager. I'm tired of meeting the manager every time I come here because the food is either tasteless, or the waitress decides to go on break after she takes our order."
Becca L.,"Elk Grove, CA",99,45,,3.0,4/7/2016,"To me, BJ's is just average. Service could improve a lot. I haven't had much luck with servers when I go to this location. They don't really check up on you for water or make sure everything is okay. Average food too."
Tridal P.,"CA, CA",0,64,10,2.0,9/5/2014,"I remember going to BJ's before they expanded to Northern California.  This was down in Westwood (West LA) and the food/service was great! They were just a small chain back then and really focused on customer service and delicious dishes!  But then they started expanding faster than you could say 'McDonald's' and sacrificed quality for quantity to become an interstate brand.   Anyways, my latest (and probably last) experience at BJ's came late one night at the Elk Grove location.  There was hardly anyone there, and my date and me were sitting in a small booth near the bar.  The service was rushed and rude while the food was  soggy and sour.  This was the last of several disappointing experiences, and at some point, you stop complaining to management because it's obvious they no longer care or can't do anything about it.  Farewell BJ's!"
Jennie O.,"Sacramento, CA",72,12,16,1.0,8/24/2014,"My husband and I just had dinner, I mean like 30 minutes ago ordered BJ takeout service. I ordered the best beginnings appetizer and my husband got the  calamari appetizer and the classic roast beef dip sandwich. Order #0527 today 8/24/14 we picked it up at 7:31pm we called it in at 6:55pm  the food was soggy and very salty. I mean the chips that came with my artichoke dip where drenched in Salt. The order came with no utensils and NO NAPKINS! the as jus with the dip sandwich was not flavorful at all.  The food was not good even for restaurant quality. It's it not far from our home and since we just bought a house in Elk Grove we thought to have BJ a try. Needless to say (but saying it anyways)  we will never ever EVER go there again. Big chains tend to focus on quantity oppose to quality. I should of just cooked dinner. I cook much better."
Nick F.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,17,,4.0,9/11/2016,Big shout-out to our fabulous server Chelsea R. You definitely want to call ahead and make a reservation for this place if possible. The portions are big to go along with the high prices. I guess I'm just getting old but huge loud restaurants like this make it hard to talk to your dinner companion. bottom line it was a satisfying meal but I'm not sure I would go back again anytime soon.
Megan D.,"Sacramento, CA",322,128,452,3.0,12/6/2014,Went hear on a Friday with my friend around 9:40 PM. We arrived and it took about 15 minutes for us to get sat. The waitress was really nice. The food got here quick. My friend and I we both got burgers. He got a double burger and I had got a bacon burger. When the food came out the presentation was beautiful. I didn't request for my Burger to be medium but it came out pretty rare. That was probably the only negatives when it came to the food. Later on in the evening there was a really big group of people who showed up and when I start asking the waitress for more barbecue sauce she forgot once or twice probably because she was pretty busy. I don't want to hold it against her because I also work in the food industry so I understand. She told us that if we signed up for rewards then we get Free mini pazooki.  I ordered the Oreo brownie Pazooki and my friend ordered the triple chocolate pazooki. I had warned him that if you get the triple chocolate it's gonna be too much chocolate for you to eat. But he got it anyways. Oh my God I tell you the Oreo brownie was so to die for. One of the best desserts I have ever had.
Daniel H.,"Sunnyvale, CA",26,83,,1.0,8/23/2015,"Let's start with the pro's...  The food was good and the price was great.  The reason I give this 1 star is because of what we experienced at the restaurant.  The waitress was actually very awesome and very nice and sweet to my kids.  It really pisses me off of the experience we witnessed.  But let me start at the beginning.....      I was born and raised in the Bay Area but my family and I live in Austin Texas.  We came to Elk Grove searching for homes as we are planning on moving there.  We went to see a realtor in Elk Grove and afterwords decided to try BJ's.  There is a BJ's in Austin TX, but never really had an inkling to go into it for some reason as we associate it with alcohol more often then a food establishment.  Don't get me wrong, we like some liquor every once and a while but never thought of it as a place to want to drink or eat.  The BJ's in Elk Grove was right across the street from the realtor, so we decided to give it a shot.      I ordered some Clam Chowder, which was excellent BTW, and my wife ordered a specialized salad which was also great.  We were greeted with a friendly waitress that immediately took care of us.  The problem started as we were waiting for our meals.  Not less then 10 feet away, a guy, who I guess was her manager, pulled her aside and started yelling at her in front of everyone.  The place was pretty full of people and I could clearly say that over 5 groups of people eating there heard this scene.  As both my wife and myself have been in customer service pretty much our entire lives as well as my degree is in Organizational Psychology, I was seriously appalled by what I witnessed.  I mean the manager yelled at her so loud that she almost started crying right on the floor, and both my wife and myself were just stunned and very uncomfortable about what we had just witnessed.  As a managers performance, that was probably one of the most unprofessional things anyone could do to anyone under their employment, and not just the employee, but themselves, as they speak and act on behalf of the company.   I do not know what the waitress could have done to have been treated so unprofessionally by the manager but we asked to speak to the manager he never came.  Either way, we have every piece of data that they would need to find out when it happened, but I seriously doubt they even read these nor care about that experience after what we had experienced on how they treat their employees. No food is worth of having to watch that type of disrespect for their employees and customers.  The manager should have taken her off the floor and spoke to her, not yell at her, period.  If need be write it up, whatever the case may be, but belittling, yelling, and disciplining an employee in front of customers is just wrong.  I sure as hell won't support any type of business that feels that this is a good way to treat employees.  The employee was so embarrassed, that she could not even look at us in the face anymore.  I don't blame her.        I really do not know who trained this manager at his job, but he is just not manager material.  He is either a bully that gets off on treating his employees like dirt, or just a very poor excuse for a supervisor.  If this company allows this type of behavior, I cannot see how they are still in business.   Sorry, I tried to remain semi-professional in this post, but even days after the fact, which is what I do before I post on here, I am still steaming about this experience."
An G.,"San Diego, CA",0,21,15,3.0,1/18/2016,"Staff is friendly. Have had mixed results food-wise. Ordered a rib-eye steak that was a disaster. Ahi salad a different time was pretty good. Convenient location, but probably a good idea to stick to their specialties on the menu."
Julie M.,"Elk Grove, CA",69,6,1,5.0,1/30/2016,Ryan was a great server! He recommended great dishes and interacted with the family on a one on one basis. Definitely would go back and request for him to be our waiter!
Victoria T.,"San Diego, CA",15,115,24,4.0,8/1/2016,Ordered takeout and there was a gentleman helping another customer on the phone and he seemed very frustrated with the customer he was talking to. We thought we would be waiting for a while for someone to enter our order in but his manager came over and helped us. When our order was ready he packed everything in a bag for us and was really friendly and nice. It's the small things that can really change a person's day. We really appreciated that he was being nice even though he had just dealt with a difficult customer.
Brandon Y.,"Elk Grove, CA",80,38,80,5.0,1/23/2015,"This is probably my favorite restaurant in Elk Grove.  The reason why I give it 5 stars, in the food (OMG the carnitas fries and the pizza!!), the beer (Tatonka, Jerimiah Red, and the Hopstorm), the people, the specials, ample seating, and the over all dining experience.  I have never had a bad meal or a bad beer here.  I will continually eat here as long as the service and food and beer hold true to form."
Trevor A.,"Sacramento, CA",100,122,12,3.0,10/14/2013,"Went for a late lunch Saturday afternoon around 3 pm.  PLENTY of bar area seating and not  long wait for tables.  We chose the bar area to watch some football & get ""quicker service"".  Apparently it was basically shift change time.  The waiter that started serving us was clearly on his way out the door. It took him 10 minutes get to us for drink orders.  And rather than get me what I wanted he pimped the house brews instead.  So I ask for samples of two specific ales.  He brings those after another 5 minutes and 2 more neither of us asked for.  Luckily this wasn't added to the check.  After we ordered our food the slow waiter vanished for he day for a much more lively and attentive server. The beers themselves served their purpose.  I had a black & tan like concoction that was with an IPA that I found too citrusy on its own and the delicious stout.  Black & tan like because it was clearly not poured over a spoon.  At this point it had been nearly 20 minutes since sitting down so I didn't get too particular about that.  My date for the evening had a wonderful porter with some raspberry soda or juice added.  Normally not my thing but I almost ordered one to go with dessert. For whatever reason I remembered their burger selection being MUCH better than what it was.  Every one of them had mayo and thousand island style sauce.  No biggie.  They gladly removed them both.  Another buck fifty for cheese and bacon.  The Swiss cheese was wonderful.  The two strips of bacon were like baseball glove laces.  Thin and chewy.  Not so great.  Burger itself was cooked to order and plenty juicy.  Saved the entire meal.  Because the cheap iceberg lettuce with it did not.  The regular fries are the dreaded shoestrings.  The seasoned fries are steak cut and MUCH tastier. The chocolate chip pizookie left us leaving happy enough to not write the place off forever.  Total check for the two beers, two burgers and pizookie was $42.  $50 after tipping the waiter that showed up off the bench. Definitely NOT waiting more than 15 minutes for a table here ever again though.  Insanity."
Ashley C.,"Kapolei, HI",1,3,2,5.0,2/29/2016,"My boyfriend and I love going to Bjs and normally we get great service! But one of the last times we went in our server was awful. I definitely noticed he was busy but he was avoiding eye contact with us. It was just ridiculous. So the last time we went in, we wanted to sit in the bar area but saw he was working so we bailed to sit in the dining area. That's where we got Daniella! She was AMAZING! Super friendly, suggested great beer for my boyfriend, overall infectious happy personality. We will definitely ask for her next time we're in there!"
Wendy L.,"Sacramento, CA",2,18,3,1.0,12/28/2014,"To BJ's customer service team: Hello, I am writing in regards to the unsatisfactory dining experience on Sunday night 12/28/2014. 1.) ordered ahead on BJ app to request appetizer to be served before entree. Reality: entree was deliver to our table before the appetizer. 2.) had to flag the server (I think her name is Shelbie D.) to our table for a bowl & spoon. Our Server walk away before we can request for the spoon. She appeared annoyed when she came back with just the bowl & we had to ask for a spoon. 3.) the wrong entree was delivered to our table by a different worker. When we pointed out to him, he basically said, ""okay, okay."" walked away & left the entree on our table.  4.) when we finally received the ""correct"" entree, the Burger was cold.  I did not enjoy my dinner at BJ's"
