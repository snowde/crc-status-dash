Karen G.,"San Jose, CA",142,276,184,3.0,1/2/2013,"I love BJs, so it makes me sad that during the one hour I was here, FOUR different families (including ours) had a complaint for the manager. I can't even imagine how many they got throughout the day.  The hostess was MIA for a long time when we walked in. I saw a family leave after they had been waiting to put their name in for a table. We were then seated at a table by the grumpiest hostess ever but my mom had asked for a booth and told her so. There was an empty booth that was available but needed to be cleaned. The hostess sighed loudly and said ""ok but it will be a wait because I don't know when they'll clean up. You need to go wait at the front"". Um rude much?? So I said, ""yes we know we need to wait at the front, thanks "". Do you think she asked for anyone to come clean the table after we had already waited for 20 min? Nope.  My dad ended up asking for the manager, while my mom was ready to leave (btw, this was technically a low key anniversary dinner for them. Not a good start). The manager quickly apologized and cleaned the table himself. After the rude welcome, we had a great time. The food was good and our server was quick and attentive. If you've never been here, you HAVE to try the avocado rolls as an appetizer. I also ordered the tomato bisque, the stuffed mushrooms with artichokes, spinach and feta, and the tomato with mozzarella salad. While I thought that the salad was very good, I found it a bit strange that it was topped with Parmesan cheese. Regardless, in my case, the more cheese the better!  Note for management: I wish I had gotten the name of the young girl at the front, but if you know who was working on Tuesday, January 1st around 2:30 - 3:30 pm, she needs an attitude adjustment. Our bill came to over $130 and our money would have gone elsewhere had my dad not spoken to the manager who quickly helped us. I am sure you can understand how it feels to walk into a restaurant expecting a great time and be greeted (actually, she barely said two words to us) by a sour-faced person who exudes ""I hate my job"". Does not feel good. I observed her with other guests, and I even heard someone next to our table say, ""what's her problem??"" There are plenty of people you can hire who would love to have her job and be much more welcoming."
Kelly L.,"Sacramento, CA",4,6,1,4.0,1/23/2016,Love Bj's. The best beginnings is a must and their ahi tuna salad is amazing. Love their bread bowls too!
Key A.,"Sacramento, CA",115,8,2,5.0,2/5/2016,"Great service every time we come here to eat and Raquel was the BEST server! I always get the chicken tortilla soup and tried a house soda this time, and it was delicious!"
Jorge D.,"Elk Grove, CA",2,2,,1.0,8/10/2015,"We went to lunch at BJ's on Sunday August 7. 2015;  it was about 2:30pm, when we arrived there we got seated right away, our waitress took about 10 minutes to show up, when he showed up we have desired what we wanted for lunch. With our selection made we ordered drinks and something light, a salad and couple soups for mi daughter and wife, the drinks where delivered, 30 minutes later. I asked the waitress about our food and he said I will check on it. 10 minutes went by and we were waiting on that food or the waitress to get a list a refills. I asked to talk to the manager and 20 minutes latter I was still waiting on her; I didn't know what to do, so I walked to the front desk I asked for the managers name Vanesa Guajardo and our server Dominic. Returned to our table to tell my family that they don't wanted us there. A soon as I got back to our table the manager showed up and she asked me what seems to be the problem, I explained to her what was going on and she didn't even care, never apologized the only thing that come out of her mount was ""let me go to my office and get you a couple courtesies for 20 dollars, she was so wrong this is not about money is about the principle. I walked away after I asked for the check. And the only thing that she said is considered paid for.  I couldn't believe what I was hearing, she never apologized.  What a way to threat a customer, I'll never come back to this restaurant."
David T.,"Sacramento, CA",128,12,19,4.0,1/25/2015,"My friend and I came here on a Sunday afternoon for a mini get together for her birthday lunch for a table of four. There was no wait so that was a bonus. I had bought in a ice cream cake and they were nice enough to offer to store it in the freezer before I even mentioned or asked. With that said, I have ordered the shrimp scampi pasta with extra garlic bread and overall I would give it a 4/5 but the garlic bread was so good so I'm giving that a 5/5 but the wait for the food is a bit long so i guess they could improve on that. The pricing wasn't bad as well. I really like the location, how the environment is and especially the helpful and nice server we had that kept checking up on us or simply just asking us how we're doing. Overall, it was a good time with good friends. I would highly recommend it if you have a large party and would love something fancy but not so fancy and at a decent pricing! It's definitely not my first time but just an update.  Remember to get their bomb garlic crispy bread!"
Alana K.,"Elk Grove, CA",47,19,2,2.0,12/30/2015,Slow service at 4:30? Not for the couple that sat down after us. Finally flagged down a waitress who didn't know who was supposed to take care of our table but volunteered to take our order. Food was Ok so two stars.
Janina M.,"Sacramento, CA",0,29,17,5.0,1/31/2016,Brunch is so good.  I had the French Toast combo.  Seasoned potatoes are to die for. Tiffany was our server and she was so polite and was constantly checking on us.  Not to mention she said our baby was cute :) will def be coming back!
Peggy N.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,1,,5.0,9/9/2016,I had a surprise birthday party for my daughter and it was rather a large party too. Everything was perfect! Outstanding service from Sam (manager ) and to brandon and trevor. The food was great as well. Thank you for excellent service!!! I will definitely be back !
Jen W.,"San Francisco, CA",695,1379,2318,3.0,1/18/2013,"Oh BJ's...you have been my go-to at night after a long, crappy day at work.  You are always there for me when I need a beer, or two, or three...but you are always out of your happy hour pretzels!!! The pizza is always consistent...deep dish or thin crust option.  I normally go with the deep dish...the thin is just meh.  The service is ok...your usual chain.  We normally sit at the bar everytime we go to bj's and have the same server.  The best thing about BJ's?  The pizookie!!!  Yummy warm, soft cookie goodness served with ice cream on top...YES!!!"
Yo P.,"Hawaii, HI",6,18,5,5.0,1/10/2016,"This is the best BJ's 300 miles from here. I do a lot of traveling because am in sales. I usually like taking my accounts to BJ's because the food, customer service, and the atmosphere is consistent. However, the BJ's in Elk Grove is the best! Employees like Ravin, Courtney, and the most important the Chef Juan make this place an enjoyable place to eat and spent time with friends, business, and family. The food even taste fresher at this BJ's!"
Joe K.,"Sacramento, CA",731,610,440,4.0,10/18/2012,"Come on BJ's, I have read your reviews.  You are supposed to be a chain restaurant entrenched in mediocrity.  What makes you think you can compete with the elite salad masters, artistic geniuses of raw vegetable gastronomy? So you stuck a plate of perfectly seared tuna in front of my face along with a pile of mixed baby greens, Napa cabbage, red bell peppers, tomatoes, avocado, and pickled cucumber.  You tossed it with rice wine vinaigrette and topped it with crispy wontons and green onions.  You even put a small dollop of wasabi in each corner of my plate.  Was that supposed to persuade me into thinking your salads are something more than mediocre? You provided excellent attentive waitresses that took great care of us.  I suppose you thought we should be impressed and that would persuade us into thinking you are something more than mediocre as well?  You pretty much succeeded.  The salad was delicious!  I just wish you would not have been so frugal with the tuna.  You really think people won't notice?"
Kenneth R.,"Sacramento, CA",165,10,,5.0,3/14/2016,"We are in the midst of some of the best serving we've had in at least a decade tonight. The server, Jason is taking spectacular care of us. Chris the manager tonight has been great checking up on us. The whole experience is making my wife and I feel giddy! Kudos!"
Ryann H.,"Roseville, CA",182,5,2,5.0,1/19/2016,"If you go the this restaraunt, make sure you get seated in Victoria's section! Had to be the best service I've ever had. The food was great, I always get the grilled chicken potato and Caesar salad.... but her attitude and efficiency put it over the top! I'll go back just for her!!!"
Mimi V.,"Elk Grove, CA",297,607,776,4.0,1/11/2011,"Need a hangout spot? This is a great spot for celebrations or just to hang out. BJs is similiar to TGIF, except their food is better. They have a full bar and brew their own beer. Drinks: Their shots are pricey, a little more than average. I like to drink their Blonde there which is pretty light. The berry burst cider is also good. For their seasonal beer, the pumpkin ale is very tasty, they usually have it around November. Jerimiah red is pretty popular also, it kind of reminds me of a red head slut mixed with a draft beer.  Food:  Appetizers: Appetizers are good here. Buffalo wings are a must. Avacado eggrolls are alright. The artichoke dip with chips is good. Lettuce wraps are a hit or miss.  Pizza: I love all their pizzas. They are all good. My favs are the buffalo, spinach, & mediterranean. Entrees there are not that tasty. They taste average to me and is overpriced. I tried the steak - normal, salad-portion is big but tastes average, fettitucini-blande.  Overall stars: 3.8"
Omar B.,"Elk Grove, CA",127,51,4,5.0,11/15/2015,Pazookie please!! For desert of course right after my wonderfully cooked medium rare steak and asparagus followed by a selection of IpA?! Oh yes..this is definitely an after the paycheck stop on my list.
Andrew H.,"Sacramento, CA",0,58,1,2.0,12/26/2015,Mediocre pizza that is overpriced. However the avocado egg rolls are delicious and the homemade cream soda is great.
Roberta C.,"Sacramento, CA",52,17,1,4.0,11/28/2015,"I eat here all the time,  very busy  but,worth the wait,  menu has tons of food choices, great drinks from the bar."
Gus T.,"Fort Collins, CO",3,8,,1.0,1/17/2015,"I'm in from out of town for work, and I wanted to watch the Arizona/Utah basketball game. It was on a weird channel, so I called ahead to confirm they had it. They said they did, I show up. And they don't actually have it.  So, basically, they're the worst and I had to scramble to find somewhere to watch the game. If you're a traveler, avoid avoid avoid. Serves me right for going to a chain though."
Quang G.,"Rosemead, CA",155,58,44,3.0,6/10/2016,Came here for some steak and pizza. Order a rib eye steak medium rare. Steak look good but had no taste. It was tasteless to the point where I only took two bites. They say their rib eye steak was aged for 28+ days before grilling. I'm guessing that killed the flavor. I most definitely don't recommend any steak lovers getting the rib eye. What I do recommend is getting the chicken Alfredo which was bomb dot com. Also had the ice cream trio for dessert. That was delicious.
Nick N.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,6,1,5.0,7/30/2016,At BJs right now. T.J. and Marlin are wonderful and extremely helpful. Kind and curious and always around to make sure that everything taste good. They are people who truly love their jobs. Stewart was also so nice and was well educated with presenting our food to us. What a great place to eat food. And feel like part of the family.
