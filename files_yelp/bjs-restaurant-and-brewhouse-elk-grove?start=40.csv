Amanda S.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",557,133,134,4.0,3/14/2017,"BJ's is the go-to place in Elk Grove to have dinner with family and friends. They are able to host big and small groups perfectly. They are usually busy, so although there's a parking lot, parking can be hard to find. The wait can be long for a big group, but if you have a BJ's premier reward card, you can get priority seating. Their website says: ""As a member of the BJ's Premier Rewards program you will be treated as a special guest every time you dine at BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse. Once you reach 1,000 lifetime points you will have exclusive access to make reservations* at BJs anytime. (*for parties of up to 10 persons and requires 24 hour advanced notice)"" I come here for the food - not necessarily the service. My go-to orders are chicken wings (ask for it extra crispy!), chicken bacon ranch pizza and of course, the pizookies! I've tried the new crispy flatbread nachos - and it wasn't worth it. Just get the other flatbreads. The last time I came here, I had excellent customer service from Dylan! He made sure to let us know about the specials for the day (I have never had that from a BJs server) and even let us know about the free pizookie offer that they had going on. He even remembered to ask for my BJ's card so I could earn points from my order. Thanks Dylan! Hope you get more hours!"
Jeremy J.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,1,1,5.0,9/20/2017,"I was just in last night and had some avocado rolls with my wife. Your server Chandra was amazing! We were in for our anniversary and she really helped us out! We were on the fence about what to eat and drink, and she made many suggestions such as the Jeremih red. She even suggested I was trying a few different beers so that we could make the decision on our own to our own taste. The avocado rolls were outstanding and will definitely be back for them. We will ask for her every time as she made our anniversary one to remember. Thank you!"
kathy o.,"Galt, CA",29,10,,1.0,9/19/2017,I'd give it 0 if i could. The server was nice or so i thought. My food came out and i ordered Cesar salad and soup. The Cesar salad came out it looked like old salad. The salad was wilted and the edges of the salad were brown. Then i got my soup and asked for another spoon it took forever for it to sever to bring it and it had white gunk on it from someone else food. I was terrified that I was going to be ill from the food. Well today my throat is sore and I have been coughing.  So sad because the services is usually good and food.
Johnny R.,"Sacramento, CA",48,6,,1.0,10/20/2017,Called an hour in advance to reserve a spot for 2 adults and 1 child. Before I even gave my name I asked if it was very busy and a long wait. The lady said no. I get there when I said I'd be there tmanf the place is packed. We go and give our name and the guy tells us it'll be a 45-hr wait. So what's the point of calling in? I drove across town. Thanks for wasting my time. I guess I'll go to somewhere else.
Amber M.,"Carmichael, CA",265,5,3,5.0,11/22/2017,Just some regulars coming in for a meal and had Nadine as our server. She had an amazing personality and made sure our food was correct and came out on time. She made our experience a lot better and definitely will request her when coming in. Servers know other great servers and I'm glad we had the opportunity  to have her!! (She's great!)
Bruddah S.,"Elk Grove, CA",172,18,10,4.0,7/25/2017,"Waited for our deep dish pizza for a little bit and when we got it, it was cold! The cheese didn't stretch and dangle like it would when it's hot! Not good! However, our waitress was able to get us a new one and told us that it was on the house because of what happened! Awesome redemption! For that, my 1 star went up to 4 because they made it right! I'm hungry and hangry, BUT it was made right!"
Amber C.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/27/2017,This place has terrible service and the wait is way too long. Ordered online at 6:15. Got there at 6:45 food still wasn't done..so they said. It was sitting there in their little heater box. The girl that checked us in didn't even look. So we waited another like 30 plus minutes before them realizing it was there as two other people that came after us getting their food to go. No stars.
Jordan G.,"Chico, CA",203,1,,1.0,11/19/2017,"Came here for brunch on Sunday at 11:30, waited for 5 minutes while the hostesses argued about who was at work and what sections were actually open for serving. Once seated we waited for 20 minutes until we finally got up and left. We were not talked to once by our waiter who had us (a group of 2), 2 other tables that were groups of 2 and a table of 10. I understand a table of 10 is a lot of people but he was completely ignoring ALL other tables and only catering to the table of 10. Poor customer service from the second we walked in."
Shalvin S.,"Elk Grove, CA",155,94,129,3.0,2/13/2017,"I never thought to yelp Bj's but hey why not. I used to love this place when they first built it, but overtime I started to notice the imperfections in their establishment.  I used to always get their chicken crusted parmigian, or even their deep dish pizzas, but like anything you get tired of it. If you have never been to Bj's then its a great place to try or go with a group of people because they have a little bit of everything.  I would say not all the food is great, but they did perfect the pizookis, and I do enjoy their craft beers.  One thing I do not like about this place is they get rid of a lot of stuff on their menu randomly. I will definitely only come here late night because its the only thing open late."
Gerald S.,"Antioch, CA",0,9,4,1.0,11/13/2017,"My wife ordered sirloin steak and I got the Parmesan crusted chicken have to tell you I am very disappointed in the portion size and the food I got four little pieces of broccoli on my plate my wife's steak is the size of Meat ball!, my daughters meal which came off the kids menu is a larger portion then my wife's and I, our waiter isn't good either and customer service honestly this place is not going to see me anymore"
Ven H.,"Queens, New York, NY",1010,274,1212,5.0,4/19/2016,"Amazing restaurant! At first I thought this wad like a TGI Friday type of restaurant. I was so wrong, it's always packed and they have good food and beer! I had a reservation for a party of 9 on a Wednesday night at 6:30. By the time we got there, it was all packed. They offer almost anything like pizza, pasta, seafood, steaks, vegetarian etc. I order a full rack of ribs and double sided asparagus. It was amazing and it was just $22. For dessert, we ordered the pizookies trio (Cookie in a skillet topped with ice cream). It was divine. Melting chocolate chip cookie with ice ream. Enough said. I love the atmosphere here, chill and casual. Good for big groups as they offer many options. Service was great."
Jason B.,"Corona, CA",45,189,162,5.0,10/16/2016,"You may be a fan, or you might not. Really depends what you're looking for. Let me explain.  When I first went to a BJs, I expected something other than what it was. I had already become well entrenched in craft brew snobbery, by countless visits to independent brew pubs and micros. So walking in to BJs I had expectations that were pretty well not met. Initially.  When I go to a place that serves it's own brews, I'm expecting to see giant fermenters, miles of steam pipes, a huge copper boil kettle, a massive mash and lauter tun, all that! I crave the permeating, cloyingly dense sweetness of a fresh malty wort being boiled, and the trip to heaven I get when they dump in the first load of hops and the air becomes pure lupulin magic.  I didn't get that. What I got was a fancy restaurant, built around a brew pub theme, with beers served that apparently they brew elsewhere especially for BJs. So you understand it took me a little while, a couple of beers, and perhaps one corner of a napkin before I got past my preconceptions.  Having done that, and set on a course to enjoy myself in spite of myself, I ordered some food and tried some of their signature brews. The Tatonka Stout is by far my favorite, with many other close seconds. Whatever else you might say, they do serve good beer. Their own, and other micros and Belgians.  Why do they still get 5 stars? Their food. O.M.G. it's freaking amazing. Their pizza is off the chart. Just go try it. You'll not be disappointed.  Not a brew pub! Not a brew pub! Not a brew pub!  But still worth the trip every time."
Shannon R.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,4,,1.0,10/19/2017,"Horrible service. I called and asked to speak with a manager, I spoke with Sam, he was rude and HUNG up on me before I could finish talking. Then when I called back to speak with him again, I was on hold for 15 minutes...never take out order either because they will keep you on hold for 25 minutes!! Kind of ridiculous. Might as well spend your money someplace else."
David M.,"Sacramento, CA",294,254,907,2.0,9/28/2016,"I now only go because others have made the choice when I had none. The food runs from bland to odd. I've had roasted brussels sprouts that had vinegar, roasted asparagus that someone thought would be cool if they were salt crusted. The steaks always lack any depth of flavor. How does a steak lose flavor? I keep trying to find the clever item on the menu but it's just not there for me. Ahi poke? ...nope  ...chicken pita tacos? ...nope! oh wait! greek yogurt ""sauce"" is not tzatziki but just yogurt (how is that a sauce?). I think I have found the way to a satisfied experience here is to hit the drinks and numb for the pedestrian reality and oddness of the food to come. So close to one star, saved by friendly staff and a nicely laid out dining area."
Jon F.,"Ripon, CA",0,15,1,1.0,10/30/2017,"Traveling for work, BJs is in the hotel parking lot. I placed an online order at 4:40pm to be ready at 5:30pm. I arrived and checked in at the Take Out counter 10 minutes early. At 5:40pm my food was still not ready. As I approached what looked like 2 managers (male & female), they both said ""hi"" & I simply told them when I ordered, to be ready at what time and that it was not 10 minutes late and to cancel my order due to such horrible service... They BOTH simply walked away from me and said nothing. HORRIBLE customer service! What the hell is a manager any good for if they can't even speak?? I do NOT recommend this location at all... Macaroni Grill across the street or MIKUNI across the freeway are both so much better anyhow!!"
Jeff B.,"Elk Grove, CA",55,7,,1.0,7/31/2017,"Great food. Bad service.  Why? Last 3 times I've been here and on other nights, my appetizers are either brought out with my dinner or after. I know it can't always be the servers fault and they're very nice about it by waving the cost but who wants to eat an appetizer along their meal. I don't care that I don't have to pay for it because at that point, I don't want it anymore. I'm never dinning here again. Ever! Forrrreevverrrr...Forrrrreevvveerrrrr -""Sandlot"""
Austin K.,"Sacramento, CA",4,10,,3.0,10/15/2017,"Kind service and a good place to go too if you are looking for good food. although they get super busy and even they may be seen as over staffed they tend to forget you are sitting their. The hostess aren't too nice, a greeting or a conversation starter would be great."
Keny T.,"Sacramento, CA",12,12,184,1.0,4/5/2017,"I would of give this experience less than a star. Ordered online that is paid and still have to wait for an hour on a Wednesday night. The order was suppose to be pick up at 715 i arrived at 7..was told they couldnt find my order but they charged my cc already.  After a good 10 min of not knowing where is my order, the guy said they are going to make the pizza now... great i waited 30 mon to check on my pizza ..guess what the manager told me there is no pizza for me because no order was put in.. are u kidding me..the best the manager said was i will comp u a dessert..i dont need dessert ..as a manager i think he could of handle my situation a lot better... This is just ridiculous. I ordered a large but they said they ran out of large pizza. Really! How can you run out of a large pizza. They gave me a medium and a small for substitution."
Kelsa L.,"Elk Grove, CA",59,11,6,1.0,4/5/2017,"""PARK AT YOUR OWN RISK""! I have to say, I love BJs! Their pizookies and deep dish pizza are bomb! However, I won't ever be going back. I came here on PI day for a $3 pizookie and when I went back to my car 30 minutes later I found my car had been smashed into and all my valuables stolen. Thefts in this parking lot probably occur often if they have to put up signs saying they aren't liable, but if they really valued their customers they would put up cameras.  Unfortunately at my job I'm my own bank, so I'm out $2000 and my school laptop, and now I'm at risk for identity theft. But BJs doesn't care-as long as they aren't liable."
Monique A.,"Pittsburg, TX",930,324,1175,4.0,3/20/2016,"I actually really like going to BJ's, my husband doesn't like it because he doesn't like the beer choices. They have their own brew selection and do not offer any other choices. Their menu sorta reminds me of a Cheesecake Factory. Lots of choices and operations are large minus the cheesecake.  I got the chicken lettuce wraps. Lots of lettuce si I don't think you would eat it all yourself. My daughter got the hamburger with pulled pork. Wow it's a big portion so a great choice if you want to split it with someone.  My granddaughter got a mini cheese pizza, I took a bite and it was really good with a lot of sauce.  It was crowed when we arrived at 1230, certainly it's probably one of the busiest restaurants in Elk Grove. Service was a little slow but I think that's because the server had a big party next to us so we had to wait a bit."
