Erica Q.,"Carmichael, CA",49,54,79,4.0,10/11/2014,"I had an early dinner here with my mother a couple of weeks ago and it was great. It was busy because it was the weekend but, we only had wait about 10 minutes to be sat. Our server was very personable and knowledgeable. I usually go to the B.J.'s in Roseville or at the Arden Fair mall but, I would go back to this one. The food was excellent and my mother and I really enjoyed the atmosphere.  I tried to talk my chocoholic mother into ordering the Triple Chocolate Pizookie Trio Made with Ghirardelli chocolate but, she decided to be good and not indulge."
Robin M.,"Burbank, Los Angeles, CA",7,1,,4.0,1/24/2016,Justine M was an awesome server. Loved how quickly she was able to get our drinks out and the order in. We were a large group and she really stayed on top of whatever we needed. I would request her section in the future simply because of how pleasant and efficient she was.
Mia C.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,4,3,4.0,8/15/2015,"This place is very good, but it depends on the day, and who's working that day. Most of the time, I get very good food, but one time, I got soggy fries (thin cut). It was like they just got some leftover fries and microwaved them. Also, a lot of the times, it is crowded, but they do try to get you seated as soon as possible. One thing I do recommend though is the pizzooki (not sure if I spelled that right). It's sooooo good. Anyways, this place is pretty good most of the time, and when the fries are cooked right, they taste delicious."
Lindsay Y.,"Elk Grove, CA",20,177,30,1.0,7/3/2015,"We returned to BJ's today for lunch with the kids. We were literally the first group in the door, first group sat. Our kids had still not gotten their food 50 minutes after we were seated. Again we had to take it to go. I was so upset and disappointed in a repeated experience that this time I actually spoke to the manager. He was polite, but I think he just didn't want me to keep talking around other tables. Again, they offered me a discount. This is not why I wanted to talk to him- I wanted to tell him, which I did, that I'm so disappointed and I cannot return with my kids. He asked that we give them another try. I don't know, I like their food, their wait staff is polite. I just can't see why their kitchen is so stinkin slow."
Olivia T.,"Sacramento, CA",0,2,,5.0,8/14/2016,"OhMyGoodness ! Dillan was phenomenal. My mother and I had came to eat for lunch and for some reason it was taking for ever to have our original server come and greet us. When Dillan heard that we were waiting, he came over with the most exceptional attitude and took our order right away. He examples the perfect customer service attitude and that's such a great thing to see when I already know what I want. I  give him five stars for going above and beyond because I know it was the end of his shift and he had other things to do. Thanks a bunch Dillan !"
Jonathan A.,"Elk Grove, CA",2,38,10,3.0,7/20/2015,"This is my favorite safe restaurant to go to whenever I'm in doubt of where to eat.  The food is good and prices are not bad for the most part.  Only thing I could think of that could use some improvement would be the service.  I don't know their name, but this one guy one time had a weird attitude when he was my server.  He wasn't rude.  Just kind of awkward.  Overall, this place is good, but there are better options.  If you do come here (and are of legal age), their beer, long islands and AMFs are pretty good."
Kevin T.,"Diamond Bar, CA",40,80,74,3.0,7/18/2013,"Best Beginnings Appetizer Combo: - Came with 8 small santa fe spring rolls, 4 mozzarella sticks, 4 avocado egg rolls, and a small bowl of chips and spinach & artichoke dip. And all with their own type of dipping sauce. - Perfect for a group of 4 people. We were actually pretty well off with just this appetizer (as in full enough) so when the pizza came we were definitely full after a single slice. Everything on the platter was really heavy, from the bountiful of avocado in the large egg roll and cheesy dip. Tasted great, but the heaviness basically is what made us filled up. BJ's Favorite Deep Dish Pizza: - Crispy bottom on the crust. But more like a crumbly crispy since the crust was kind of dry. - Nothing spectacular about the pizza. Good taste, but too ordinary for sit-down restaurant pizza (as in a more ""upscale"" place). Bill came out to be about $11 a person (group of 4)."
Jay G.,"Elk Grove, CA",153,26,143,5.0,10/27/2014,"Great service! Tvs music, people, food beer even thou i stay lean so water and lemons haha but overall great place!! But of course Home of the PIzookie!!! For my girls of course not for me to cheat! Hahaha"
Anali G.,"Modesto, CA",0,5,1,1.0,7/21/2016,"By far the worst service! Hosts up front completely ignored us, and the waitress was not much better. Very disappointing!"
Vanessa M.,"Lockeford, CA",0,2,,5.0,8/6/2016,Im giving this place 5 stars because the service is amazing! Everyone should ask for Sam's section because he is always on top of it and answers any questions you have! Will definitely be coming back here often! (:
Jeffrey T.,"Wilton, CA",3,2,,1.0,6/16/2015,"I generally like BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse.  Beer is ok and the food is above average.  I like their pizzas and especially the  Buffalo Wings pizza.  On this occasion I ordered a California Burger, well done with wedge fries.  There were 5 of us and one baby in our party.  Everybody received their food from people other than our waitress except for me.  I waited, and waited, and waited.  So 15 minutes later I asked our  waitress where is my meal?  She asked ""what did you order?""  I repeated my order to her.  She came back about 10 minutes and said my meal was delivered to the wrong table but they had caught it right away and fired another one.  So I waited, and waited and after about 10 minutes I finally went to the front desk and complained.  The manager came over to the table and asked what was the problem.  I asked him if he saw a meal in front of me.  As he was there my burger showed up. He informed us my meal would be complimentary.  I did indeed receive a California Burger with potato wedges.  That was the only thing right about my order.  The bottom bun was soggy like it had been sitting a while.  The burger was on the verge of being cold.  The burger had a pink stripe in the middle indicating it was cooked medium and not well done as ordered.  They are pathetic. We are a small group that on Wednesdays visit local restaurants.  We will not be going back to BJ's of Elk Grove.  I find it amusing that there are plaques on the walls outside the front door that indicate the names of the site manager and assistant manager and they are ""share holders of the company."" I tried posting with no stars, Yelp made me select one star to post.  They do not deserve that star."
Candace J.,"Sacramento, CA",0,3,,5.0,2/3/2016,"Carlie was an amazing server! She had great recommendations and were on point!! She was on top of everything ! Never needed to ask for anything she brought everything to the table in a timely fashion, she had great customer service and an out going personality! I will be asking for her for future visits!!"
Vanessa C.,"Elk Grove, CA",43,49,34,4.0,10/13/2014,"Im not exactly sure why i haven't written a review here because I've been here pretty often! The service is always good here and the servers are usually friendly and efficient. But whats really important is the food! I haven't tried anything that i haven't liked! Every time i come here i have to get the santa fe rolls for an appetizer, it a flavor party just waiting to burst in your mouth. I also really recommend any of their pizzas because they're huge and tasteful. I never mind coming back here with friends and family."
Jessica B.,"San Leandro, CA",69,229,65,4.0,9/1/2014,"EVERYTIME i come to BJs something happens- bad service, messed up order, long waits. But this BJs was different! We got seated quickly and the waitress was really nice and sweet (I'm bummed I didn't get her name!)  Brother and I got the 2 for 22$- 2 soup/salad, medium pizza and a pizookie! We were able to pay a little more and upgrade to a large. The waitress was kind and helped us order in a way to help us save money.  Our food came out in a timely manner and again, our waitress helped make our experience at BJs remarkable!"
r l.,"Lodi, CA",36,589,33965,4.0,5/31/2012,"Yesterday... on a Bike Ride to the Elk Grove area... After arriving within the City Limits of Elk Grove by Bicycle yesterday, I was salivating over the thought of a Guiness Float which I had last month at a drinking establishment in downtown Sacramento... which satisfied my craving for Ice Cream and Alcohol and was absolutely refreshing. I worked my way West-ward on Elk Grove Boulevard stopping at almost every drinking establishment looking for a place that served Root Beer Floats... knowing that finding a place that served Guiness Floats would probably be fruitless. I went through countess restaurants perusing their Menus till I happened on BJs on Laguna... read their framed menu posted at the entrance... Voila! There it is... a ""BJ's Handcrafted Root Beer Float"" !!! On the menu... Custom-made Guiness Float (**** 1/2 $6.75) (   ) Now... this is why I chose BJs over any other drinking establishment in Elk Grove! I took a seat at the Bar knowing that I had to have a ""personal"" relationship with the Bar-tender. I described the Guiness Float I had a month ago... Two Scoops of Vanilla Ice Cream dropped into some Guiness and then some Guiness to top it off... ""Can you do it?"" The Bartender replied... ""I'll do my best..."". When the Bartender returned with his concoction... I have to say... BJs is great on presentation... even with an improvised on-the-spot Dessert / Drink. The Pint Glass was literally frothing over the sides of the glass, with wisps of vapor emanating from the sides and the top of the Dessert... reminiscent of something made by a mad-scientist in a Horror Flick! And the Dessert Drink really hit the spot... especially on a very Hot Bicycle Ride yesterday! If there was any criticism though... it would be some experimentation... I requested two scoops of Ice Cream... for those with sweeter taste buds, it'd be best to ask for three. And the Ice Cream at BJs is of the soft type - more like a soft-serve rather than the frozen type. Maybe a request to place the scoops of Ice Cream in the freezer then to make the Float at the end of your meal might be preferable.  Stayed for some... Wyder's Pear Cider (***** $6.95) (   ) Prefer Cider over Beer... anytime, any day of the week. Other options were a Berry Cider or a Belgian Framboise (Beer)... Question to BJs... What about Apple Cider? A visiting Englishman wouldn't recognize the Ciders at BJs... Black & Bleu Burger (** 1/2 $10.25) (   ) (   ) (   ) Blackened half-pound Angus pattie with a melted, creamy Bleu Cheese topping, with Applewood smoked Bacon, roasted Garlic Aioli and Tomatoes between some toasted and Buttered Artisan Hamburger Buns... with a side of seasoned Wedge-Cut Fries.  Between the Blackened Hamburger Pattie and the Bleu Cheese... you would think this would be... ""One Tasty Burger!"" . Nope. Despite the handsome presentation of the entree... 1) the toated and buttered Hamburger Buns were rather Dry, very Dry... on the verge of imminent staleness. 2) BJs has to learn how to Blacken meat... when you Blacken anything, there is a degree of Saltiness... and this Hamburger just lacked that flavor. 3) Bleu Cheese lacked sharpness and flavor... it might as well been any kind of Cheese other then Bleu. 4) Wedge Fries... count em... only about a dozen wedges or so. Such stinginess at BJs... Seansoned? With what?  After the meal, asked the Bartender how much would it cost to upgrade a Burger at BJs to a 1-Pounder... $3.99 for an extra Hamburger Pattie... Hmm... Looks like I won't be having any 1-Pound Burgers at BJs anytime soon.... I could direct you to my favorite place to get a Black & Bleu... but then you'd accuse me of just being a promoter... From the Greeter at the entrance of BJs to the Bartender, who obligingly listened to me and concocted my Guiness Float... the people at BJs are some of the nicest and cordial service people I've met at a restaurant. On the verge of being syrupy nice... seemingly cultishly nice - too good to be true. Maybe I'll ask for a Cider Float next time at my local BJs... After this Brunch / Lunch yesterday... between the Guiness Float and the Pear Cider I had a buzz leaving the restaurant... I could not work off the buzz until after ten miles of Bike Riding during the ride back to Lodi. Made it back, though, as you can see..."
Sara R.,"Sacramento, CA",117,12,,1.0,6/14/2015,"I like BJs in general. I've been to many nice BJs. This one in particular is not the place to go. I've had disappointing experiences on 2 separate occasions. 1 occasion I ordered a pizza to go. Got it home and it was mostly bread. The worst pizza ever for $25.00. I called the manager and he was kind enough and offered a re do. 2nd experience was to pick up the re do and I ordered additional items. I ordered it at 6:30. It is now 7:45 and I'm still in the car writing this review. 20 min later: I just walked in and found that my food is done in the warmer. They thought the manager took it out to me already. Wrong. I was so upset since I had just came off a work trip, drove 2 and 1/2 hours bf and then sat and waited for nearly 2 hours in the car. I just wanted to have dinner for my kids and go straight home. No discount was offered for that HUGE inconvenience. I will never come back to this BJs."
Liberty F.,"London, United Kingdom",3,31,4,5.0,7/19/2015,"This is the only bar I've been to in the area that was actually nice, in the sense that it was clean and the lights weren't so dim that you couldn't see your drink. We didn't eat there, but there was a good variety of beers and wines, and when the bar area was full they let us just have drinks in the restaurant area. Contrary to other people's experiences, we had just one waitress serve us and she was attentive and friendly. The guy at the bar was also nice to us, and patient when we couldn't decide what to order."
Tina N.,"Sacramento, CA",335,61,45,5.0,4/3/2014,Came here 2 hours after eating an all you can eat at oz korean bbq so we were't too hungry. We tried some of their appetizers which was all really good.. I highly recommend the ahi poke. It was my first time trying it and it was delicious. Other than that their stuffed mushrooms are one of my favorites! Good vibes at this place! We'll be back!!
Nicole W.,"Elk Grove, CA",1,2,,2.0,6/20/2015,"Let me start off by saying that I normally have good experiences here and today was one of those exceptions. After we sat and ordered, our waiter brought us our drinks and he got them wrong. He then apologized and fixed his mistake; however, after that he completely disappeared! Never once came by to ask us how things are or if we needed more drinks. After 40 min he finally came by and we of course asked him where our food was. Turns out that he never actually put our order in. He apologized and hastened our order, giving us a complimentary salad while we waited. When our food did finally come, the food wasn't up to par with previous experiences. Like all chain restaurants, service is horrible; however, I love the pizza and beer here so I probably will return, just not during rush hour or for any sports events when it's super packed."
Diomedes L.,"Roseville, CA",229,182,2464,3.0,7/18/2014,"Went here with my wife coming from paying our last respect to my wife's friend, we were accommodated right away but for some reason, we always have less than adequate service when we go to BJ's restaurant.   I don't know if it's only me but the waiting between orders and meals are far and in between .  In my opinion the food is good but the service in waiting needs to be upgraded"
