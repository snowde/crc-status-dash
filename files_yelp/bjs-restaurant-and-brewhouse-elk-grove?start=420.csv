E.L. K.,"Sacramento, CA",12,29,8,2.0,4/17/2014,"Food is great, drinks are awesome... the buck stops there.  I don't understand why they are always so busy?  The service should be outstanding for the outrageous prices, but it is terrible on every occassion I go there.  I am reading here that the customer service is not a good experience at BJ's. The server put in the wrong pitcher order, finally got our pitcher of cider an hour later with no glasses, didn't write down our requests so they came out wrong, she disappeared most of the two hours it took from seating to cashing out, other servers had to assist our table, as the designated driver they didn't even comp my iced tea, and we got dessert AFTER the bill and to-go box came!!  I have never complained, until last night, but I couldn't take it anymore!  The manager was just as rude and non-service oriented as the rest of the crew.  He didn't even bother to cash me out when I complained about the bill, so I had to flag down the server, again!  The manager's attitude explains a lot! I should've yelped before going out for my daughters birthday, even though we really tried to have a good time, it was tainted by the wicked witch of the serving crew.  $70 for pizza and cider!?  Really, I should have called into Round Table for home delivery, That would have been a lot more fun!"
Darina H.,"Folsom, CA",135,1010,160,4.0,12/4/2012,"My coworkers and I came here the other day to surprise another coworker for her baby shower celebration.  Our party was a big one, yes 12 people! I called a few days in advance knowing that it may be difficult to squeeze in 12 people on a Friday night after work.  I called BJs and spoke with their bookkeeper Sarah who was able to make a reservation for 630 PM on that Friday.  She forewarned us that we needed at least half of the people present before we could be seated and said she would try her best to get the table but could not promise that the table would be ready at 630 PM on the dot.  She was great with communicating everything to me so that I could rely the message to our friends and coworkers. My husband and I arrived at 630 PM on the dot (we only had two other people with us) and the hostess quickly seated us saying that our table was ready.  What?! Really, that's awesome.  It felt great to bypass all the 20+ people waiting in the front that didn't make a reservation (SUCKERS!). Our table was in the smaller room to the left and it was perfect.  They set out 12 seats for our party and our waitress came by to take our drink orders.  The rest of our party trickled in a few moments later.   The food was decent but the company and customer service made the experience that much better.  Although we didn't order any pizza (we ordered avocado egg rolls, soup and salad) but the dinner we did get was pretty good.  Nothing spectacular but good enough to enjoy!  We never skip on dessert so we ordered the Pizookie Trio (DELICIOUS).  Overall, great experience that I honestly was not expecting! Great job!"
Faith D.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,4,1,5.0,1/15/2016,"Carli is the most radical waitress and made my dining experience very enjoyable. She was helpful, funny and attentive. 10/10"
Thomas G.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,1,,5.0,6/26/2016,I was eating dinner with my family when I noticed an elderly women eating dinner alone. It really warmed my heart to see that the manager had noticed and sat down with and talked to her for a good 10-15 minutes. The food was delicious and I'm already craving another pazookie.
Rosanna H.,"Rocklin, CA",6,9,1,2.0,11/27/2015,Disinterested hostess followed by a 15 minute (15 minutes!)  initial approach by our server followed by 17 minutes until drinks and 30 for the food which came out cold. The place is far from packed leaving me obligated to place blame on the operation of the business itself. The positive yet naive waiter was the only thing granting this restaurant 2 stars. Normally bjs is the bees knees but this one is pretty bad :/ No food is good cold.
Jason C. J.,"San Francisco, CA",1500,983,612,2.0,2/28/2014,"Well let's see...this is the first BJ restaurant where I got verbally stereotyped and racially profiled in one night by an unclassy white male server. I only came in because I was visiting town for a conference and my hotel was nearby (within walking distance).  EDIBLES: Margherita Fresca  HandCraft Root Beer Nothing out of the ordinary here since I've frequented other BJ restaurants before. Unimpressed. Didn't bother to take photos because it wasn't worth it. SERVICE: Slow, uneventful and shitty. All the dude did was bitch about the Asians making a racket every time they frequent this place. Guy talked about his yellow fever and about how he couldn't score before taking my order. F'n rude man. When he finally got my order right, getting my drink took 12 mins, while my small meal took an hour and 2 mins. The restaurant was pretty empty for a rainy evening and it takes an hour to make my food?! I was about to walk out and go get fast food instead. OVERALL: Never coming back here again. What's up with this location anyways?"
Lynn H.,"Sacramento, CA",180,356,193,3.0,4/4/2012,"This place is freaking packed all the time! I haven't actually been back in several years since it was still considered ""new."" But for a while there I felt like I was going once a month for birthdays and other gatherings.  I came in after having a terrible experience at another area eatery. My friend and I caught the happy hour! They have great specials and from what I recall, their beers and such are pretty good. We got an appetizer of stuffed mushrooms and a macadamia nut pizookie. The mushrooms were pretty good and how I love those pizookies... YUM!  BJ's is as good as I remembered it. However, it's kinda out of my way to go to and not to mention always ridiculously crowded. Service is always ok but nothing to write home about. It's a good stand by for birthdays though and you can never be mad when you're munching on a pizookie!!!"
Lai J.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",583,5,,4.0,1/2/2016,"The food was great. I was too full but our server, Michael M, was off the hook! He made sure my MIL was taken care of. He also scored big with my husband by doing so. We appreciate great service & he was awesome!"
Tyrone V.,"Novato, CA",64,287,9,3.0,5/28/2012,"Admittedly, I eat here quite a lot, but I've noticed a recent downward trend in terms of their service. I can live with the slow service, but I don't appreciate servers who don't come by at least once to check on my table, except to give us our check. I also don't appreciate when servers forget our drink orders. Fine, we'll wait for our food, but please at least make our wait easier by getting our drink orders to us in a timely manner. Oh, and the one appetizer I did enjoy here - the calamari - is not what it once was."
Sarita N.,"Sacramento, CA",94,154,15,3.0,7/20/2015,I think the food gets a little worse every time I come sadly. I love this food chain but this particular branch just isn't delivering any more. I'll probably be back but I'm skeptical about the experience that we will have.
Jeanette T.,"Sacramento, CA",95,23,1,5.0,9/11/2015,"I love this BJ's Restaurant! My husband and I go here when we want some quality time to just hang out. It's a very relaxed atmosphere. Every time we go, we try our best to get the bar area and get Carlos, he's a really fast bartender that's on it with a great personality. I'll admit, it does get crowded, but that's because it's a great place to be! If it's your first time going, I got to recommend my favorite, the spinach stuffed mushrooms! They are amazing!!!!"
Jennifer P.,"Elk Grove, CA",6,31,39,5.0,4/9/2015,Had excellent service today. My husband had the Parmesan Chicken and I had the chicken pesto sandwich and ordered avocado egg rolls for appetizer. All the food came out fast. We would like to thank our server for being so great his name was Brandon. We had not been to BJ in over 3 months and it was a nice date night out.
Lloyd P.,"Ontario, CA",6,51,9,3.0,7/26/2015,The place was fine but very busy.  This seems to be the only restaurant in the area and it acted like it.  Our server was kind upset we were there too long and she could not turn our table over to a more hip party.  Food was typical for a BJ's and their beer is good.
Diane F.,"Elk Grove, CA",25,39,10,4.0,2/28/2015,"The service here was a little slower than average, but the server made up for it by being extra friendly.  The food and drinks were excellent in taste.  4 stars overall since the food took a little longer than I expected for a non-rush day/hour."
Rocky S.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,10,6,1.0,7/2/2016,We are a regular here We ordered appetizer and pizza with 2 drinks on Friday night Pizza and appetizer came at same time. Not good. We ate appetizer first and than tried pizza. It was cold. Like it was precook already and sitting for a while in the back.
S R.,"Elk Grove, CA",1,23,,4.0,6/30/2016,"You must get the pizookie!!!!!  I am also a fan of their pizza and salad.  I can't give this place 5 stars, because it's just too loud in there for me, but what should I expect for a BJ's?!?!  Sometimes you may have a wait, but go get a drink at the bar."
Kyle R.,"Honolulu, HI",2,13,4,1.0,5/29/2015,Live in Elk Grove and always come to BJ's. Typically a pleasant experience except this time our server was Danielle. She is Caucasian and a heavy set woman so don't get her mixed up with another Danielle. She started off our convo by arguing with me and practically ruined the experience from there. Every question I asked she had a snarky remark and took EXTREMELY long. Took 1hr 20min to get our food. The table next to us with another waiter sat AFTER us and got their food BEFORE us. My entire table felt the same way so it wasn't a thing between me and her. Horrible experience.
Elizabeth G.,"Elk Grove, CA",3,18,2,4.0,7/14/2015,"BJ's is always out go to! There's good options no matter what. I do have to say though, my favorite thing in the menu is the strawberry splash! I could drink so many of those!! Although my husband may end up having to carry me out of the restaurant if that was the case! The waiters also do their best to give attentive service with how busy they are. I can't say I've ever been disappointed at this location!!"
Alan D.,"Orangevale, CA",35,18,1,3.0,7/14/2015,The owner was quick to respond to this issue and I look forward to being able to return soon.
Ana O.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,10,4,5.0,12/11/2015,"This is my favorite burger place and brewery in town. I am also a big fan of their rewards program, it's totally worth it for as much as we visit. Love it!"
