Sarah G.,"Grand Blanc Township, MI",25,21,2,5.0,7/26/2015,"They get 5 stars because everything was great, and the past reviews made me question coming here.  Service was excellent - fast & friendly - and we loved our food.  We will be back!"
Alyssa B.,"Elk Grove, CA",194,75,12,3.0,4/5/2015,"Delicious food, great environment. BUT customer service needs some help! Whenever I come here, the waiters/waitresses are a hit and miss. I go here quite often, but last time I was here, the guy didn't seem excited at all to serve us. He would roll his eyes and make my group & I feel uncomfortable to ask anything from him. I'll still keep coming back here, though, so hopefully they improve their customer service improves!"
Tiffany I.,"Elk Grove, CA",25,42,11,5.0,12/29/2015,"I've been here many times before and I love the pizza. It's one of the few places that serve gluten free pizza dough so I am able to take my grandma out to lunch as well. Service is good, but it does get busy on weekends."
Ally H.,"Sacramento, CA",360,72,21,1.0,1/6/2012,"I'm writing this review as I'm waiting to eat here. My mom made a reservation for 11 at 7 o'clock. They called at 6:50 ish to see if we were still gonna make it and we said we were here. When we got to the front desk, she said itd be a 30-45 minute wait.  I stand before you yelpers now, waiting at 46 min and guess what?? MY BUTT IS STILL ON THE WAITING BENCH!  What's the point of calling in to make a reservation?? OH. and people who don't have reservations have been getting in before us.  I JUST talked to them and now I have to wait 5 more minutes.  A wait this long for low quality food?? It isn't even worth it. Even the crappy McDonalds across the street is looking more appealing than this. And I won't need a reservation there!  UGH."
Art T.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,2,,1.0,7/5/2016,"Don't come here to have your lunch, their not busy at all when I came in 2:30pm.. We waited 25 mins just to take your order.. And another 30 mins to have your food to be serve.. My goodness sake.."
Julia T.,"Elk Grove, CA",190,27,3,4.0,3/9/2015,"BJ's has such a wide variety of food/drinks you really can't go wrong here. My favorites are the avocado egg rolls, chicken limone pasta, pizza of course, tomato bisque soup, wedge salad and Jeremiah Red is my beer of choice. I don't recommend coming here on your lunch break if you don't have the time to wait. They definitely are not quick."
Clark K.,"Glendora, CA",0,7,,4.0,10/15/2015,BJ's is always good. I tried the seared ahi salad and was impressed. The in-house brewed beer selection is good and they daren't afraid to introduce different beer/alcohol mixes. Service has always been professional too. Definitely can't leave without trying a pizookie!
Gilbert G.,"Elk Grove, CA",186,39,25,4.0,6/10/2014,"""You guys wanna do happy hour tonight?"" This is a very popular question amongst my friends and I, but once we hear ""happy hour"", we automatically connect the word to BJ's. This is our spot to go to when we all just want to get together to hang out, celebrate something, or decompress from a long work/school week. We go here so much that our regular waitress, Sarah, remembers us each time (she's such an awesome waitress, btw). If you want to catch a big sports event, this is a good place to go to... But I recommend getting there early because it gets packed! They have plenty of tvs for you to watch the biggest sporting event going on that day, so I'm sure you can sit anywhere and be in sight of a TV.  My friends and I love the bar area. Now as far as the main dining area... Well, we try to avoid it. Depending on when you go, there's usually a wait. I, personally, haven't had a lot of good experiences with customer service with the waiters/waitresses in the main dining area. Whether they're slow at getting you a refill, or sending down the wrong order... There has always some kind of negative experience in the dining area.  The 4 stars are mainly for the bar and it's service there. Always an enjoyable time with the homies.. And great for happy hour.  My recommendations: Any of their craft beers... My go to is the hefeweizen. But Im sure any of them are good. Also, try their great white pizza! So good!"
Mandeep S.,"Elk Grove, CA",82,238,171,2.0,3/16/2014,"So I went there tonight with my friend. She had called ahead (their version of a reservation) and she was told that it was going to be 30 minutes. We waited for an hour and 15 minutes and we were still not seated. Finally I saw someone get up from the bar and I quickly grabbed their table. We finally sat down (at the bar) and got our order. The food came 15 minutes later. So basically we waited an hour and 30 minutes to eat. I would avoid this place on a Friday and Saturday night. They always have too many people going there and wait is at least 30 minutes no matter what time you go in. I would not go here except that my friend likes this place. Service and food has always been great. The wait time, not so much."
Ruben A.,"Sacramento, CA",259,10,54,5.0,11/25/2013,"I have been coming here for at least 7-9 years. I've had some great service and some of the worst service I have ever had. More on the good. But even that said, the food has always been great. I'll get into deals about that at a later post.  But this post is mainly for the server Nic (aka Nicholas). We came here for a special night and he was awesome. We will be back just for him."
Chaulzy S.,"Sacramento, CA",50,78,75,2.0,6/3/2015,"Came in unfortunately on a Saturday morning while they had graduates in. Bar was open so sat there. Ordered a skillet. Bf ordered pancakes and eggs. Brother came 10mins later and ordered French toast. We waited as normal, crowds of people the bar keep was friendly and tentative.  After waiting for what seemed like 40plus minutes my brothers French toast came out (ordered after me and my bf) Ok maybe our food took a bit longer so we waited 10more mins...  I see a girl come out confused with plates in her hand talking to the bar tender. Then proceeds to come place the plate infront of me... Well my food was cold looked as if it was sitting, my avocado wasn't even green anymore. The cheese looked like rubber and the food had onions which is specifically requested not to have. My bf pancakes came with no syrup and the pancakes weren't in no way warm.  Luckily after telling the bar tender the food wasn't up to par she personally went and took care of it. She came back out fresh food from what it seemed she was the one who made sure it was ok. If it wasn't for her I wouldn't of given any stars."
Brad C.,"Sacramento, CA",335,131,1067,4.0,1/4/2014,"This place has attractive interior design and a large parking lot. The have the ability to separate part of the floor for large private gatherings.  It is always busy, however, don't let the crowded parking lot fool you, sometimes you can get seated promptly.  The pizzas are quite good.  I like the chicken ranch with bacon pizza.  The side salads are adequate, but not exceptional."
Scott F.,"Elk Grove, CA",2,15,1,2.0,2/4/2015,So this is the 3rd time I have been in there and saw everyone else arround me get Sat and get drinks before we did. I shouldn't have to sit there for 15 mins to be asked what I would like to drink. I then went up to the front and asked them to take my order and the floor manager walked by me 3 times looking for a waiter to take it and still nothing. Great manager...  Service is half of the business restaurants and apparently in this generation it's ok to be lazy and not care about you're job.  The food here is ok. It tastes good but nothing special. Not worth waiting around for.  We tip way above very good even if the food is crappy. As long as the service is good like they actually care about their job.  I am in customer service myself and people get the million dollar service no matter how little of money is spent and I don't expect a tip. I would rather be thanked for good service. Bj's doesn't care... It's sad. Good luck
Ali K.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,4,,3.0,12/7/2014,"Food is good 85% consistent,  But takes forever sometimes  I can totally understand with how busy it gets and service is never a problem with me most if the time but it's not the best"
Charley P.,"Sacramento, CA",28,12,12,3.0,8/22/2014,"The food here is pretty good. The staff are very efficient and generally nice. A tip, when you order your food here, don't order everything at once or it will all arrive at your table at the same time. Order your appetizer, when it arrives order your salad. When your salad arrives order your entree... Many a time I've had a table over stuffed with food items and feeling rushed.  Things to try Deep dish pizza, good toppings, ask them to cook it extra long for a crunchier crust.  Burgers, never had a fail here, juicy and well presented.  Parmesan crusted chicken, the tastiest thing on the menu if you want a large meal."
Errycka P.,"Sacramento, CA",3,7,,1.0,7/20/2015,"Came here Sunday with my daughter for dessert. It was pretty crowded, so we went over to the bar area. We were able to find an empty booth. We sat waiting for service. Waitress passed us a few times. Twenty minutes later a server asked if we had been helped and went to get our menus. I saw him hand them to a waitress, who walked them to another table(customers had just sat down). She turned towards our table and I informed her that we had been waiting. She then tells me ""He has your menu"". As I open my menu, she asks if I'm ready to order?(I've only turned the first page) I ask for a few minutes. She stares at me and says""Sure take as long as you need"". At that point we decide not to waist anymore time on poor service in an unwelcoming environment."
Nick C.,"Sacramento, CA",0,4,,4.0,11/5/2015,Came in for lunch great service and very accommodating. We ordered the Root beer ribs. They were falling off the bone and delicious. They came with a side of coleslaw that had a chipotle sauce. It really gave it a nice kick next was the BLT salad (a personal favorite when I come in but the spinach wasn't washed so I didn't finish Henze the 4 stars) and broccoli cheese soup. For our meal we had the Bacon and blue burger and let me tell you it was melt in your mouth amazing. Its been a long time since I had a burger that good. Paired it with the Jeremiah red on tap. Finished off with a salted caramel pazooki that was a perfect end to a great meal. Will be back again.
Leonard J.,"Sacramento, CA",1,23,2,5.0,5/19/2016,"took the babe here for her graduation dinner and boy was it impressive. the place was slammed but we still got amazing service from our waiter. he offered to let us sample a disgusting beer we were interested in at first so promptly ordered something different. it would have sucked to have gotten stuck with it. the food was good too we had the ahi poke appetizer and it was delicious. it took a while to get our dessert but it was understandable for how busy they were. we ordered too much of course, but it was totally worth it."
Dante D.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,22,5,5.0,11/4/2014,"BJ's is always good, I've had mixed results in the past but tonight everything was on point. Service was excellent, our server Nia was very nice, pleasant, professional, and brought our food out quickly. In the past I've ordered the burger, ceasar salad, and the chipotle chicken entree, and they were all ok, but tonight I decided to switch it up and order all appetizers instead. We had the chili in a breadbowl, fried artichoke hearts, stuffed mushrooms, and the chicken wings and they were all excellent, I actually prefer the appetizers over the entrees. Kids had the spaghetti with meat sauce and they liked it alot. The beer is always 5 stars, my fav is the blonde!"
Brandon A.,"Plainfield, IL",18,328,21,2.0,5/12/2015,The pizza was very good.  The avocado egg rolls were mushy and left quite a bit to be desired.  My wife enjoyed her southwestern dish.  We'll be back but wont order the soggy eggrolls.
