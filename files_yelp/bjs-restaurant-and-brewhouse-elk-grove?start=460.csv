Sunny L.,"Sacramento, CA",719,660,769,4.0,2/4/2012,"Coming here at least once a month, one would expect to be tired of this place; I have not. its quite the opposite. I am starting to like it more and more because I realized why i didn't like this place. The food here isn't that great [except pizza] but the appetizers [chicken wings], pizza, and the beers are grand. If you come here, get pizza, appetizers, and beers. Nothing else. The beers here are great, try the seasonal beers which can sometimes be excruciatingly GOOD.  Happy hours are during the day and late night. Definitely recommended to try. The staff are always nice too! Pros: Happy Hours! beer, pizza, Ambiance, Staff Cons: Other food. Stars: 4.25"
Ric G.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,12,,5.0,1/27/2016,"Took my family to BJ's on 1/26/16 for my son's birthday.  Food was great and the service was even better.  Our server's name was Chandra.  She was very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful.  She worked very hard to make sure our dinning experience was very enjoyable.  Very satisfied and glad we came here for dinner.  Even more glad Chandra was our server."
BeeLa B.,"Lodi, CA",56,7,,1.0,9/14/2015,"I would give this BJ location 0 stars if I could. I've been to this location many times and the service is always okay, but this time it's the worst ever! As I'm writing this review I've been on hold for about 30 minutes! 30 minutes and counting for a to go order!! This is ridiculous! I even tried to put an online order and their system isn't working at all. How convenient!? So I'm calling back again and again on hold. Ridiculous service!! They need to do something with their staff because apparently they can pick up but no one can take my order? Hostess claims they are very busy, but when I first called she said there was no one at the station but now all of a sudden they are very busy doing what exactly? Never again ordering from here or eating here again."
April B.,"Elk Grove, CA",1,2,,5.0,9/10/2015,"I give this place 5 for Dillan. He handled all of our needs (and we asked for a lot of sauces on the side, a change in our order) and made sure our meal and time here was to our liking and we are leaving satisfied and happy. :) Calamari never fails here. Bam. You rock Dillan!"
Joy A.,"Elk Grove, CA",1,8,1,1.0,3/10/2015,I would have given this place a zero if it is an option. In this century you would think every restaurant would love to get a reservation for a party of 15 people. Manager refused to accommodate my request...even if we get there 2 hours early! What a terrible customer service.
John D.,"Elk Grove, CA",22,24,2,4.0,8/3/2015,Food was 4 stars our server TJ was awesome. Very personable and attentive.  You rock TJ. SEE YOU NEXT WEEK!
Corrina E.,"Sacramento, CA",8,58,1,2.0,8/1/2015,"Not worth the hype! I've been here a handful of times and still don't think much of it. It's always forever to be seated (crowded or not), food is just ok. I honestly rather go to Smashburger since I always end up ordering a burger anyway. Smashburger blows this place away in burger comparison."
Karissa D.,"Elk Grove, CA",119,1,,1.0,11/28/2016,"if your trying to order take out dont choose bjs. im not sure if they have separate employees working on just take out that dont know how to do their job, or the entire restaurant cant seem to get it together. i really enjoy a few items at bjs and want to enjoy them at home but time and time again has proven they are the worst at takeout. dont waste your time or money ordering takeout. You will be disappointed."
Kahakauwila S.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",74,38,25,2.0,3/23/2014,"Service was some what incompetent, I asked for another dish and the guy came back with two small dishes and said oh I didnt know what size dish you wanted. Ok I thought the guy was new. Second I ordered another spoon to share my wifes pizookie, that took 5 to 10mins and when she did bring the spoons all 8 of them half of them still had food stuck on them!  The pizza was mostly crust and not much meat, cheese and toppings.. The Pizookie good at first but it was burnt on the bottom so almost half of it was stuck to the bottom of the pan.  We had the BJ's Favorite pizza for dinner and then we had the craps the next day! Never going to eat at that BJs again! I know its Elk Grove branch because we went to the one in Folsom and the service and food was great!"
Nick B.,"Stockton, CA",2,12,4,5.0,1/23/2014,"The reason I put 5 stars is because of our server Amanda.  Right off the bat she was super nice and was very attentive.  She returned to our table regularly and was very happy and upbeat the entire time.    She singlehandedly kept my hope alive that BJ's can be a great experience with stellar service.   Thank you Amanda for going above your expectations, they are lucky to have you working there and so am I!!!!"
Ladonna A.,"Richmond, CA",522,337,667,4.0,10/16/2013,"I am not a fan of food chains and I always prefer local breweries and restaurants, but when I first discovered BJs, i just couldnt see anything wrong with it. As a beerholic, I was surprise by their selection. This location particularly had great beer. Their menu is endless with selections that serves food like Pizza to Ahi Poke.  This is probably one of the coolest spots in Elk Grove."
Alex B.,"Elk Grove, CA",207,11,,2.0,7/20/2015,"I think BJ's a cool place to hang out, but my experience at this particular location has never been stellar. When I came the other night for a friend's 21st, I wanted to try a different drink than what I usually got, so I asked the waitress what my friend had ordered prior. I had only turned 21 two months prior, and so after seeing my ID, she proceeded to call me a baby and wouldn't stop patting me on the shoulder for not knowing what I wanted to drink. Uhh... Seriously..? I'm sure she was trying to be funny and kid around, but was that really necessary? Not at all... Whatever, I always have better service at the Arden Fair location anyway."
Cristina O.,"Elk Grove, CA",1,55,57,4.0,6/16/2015,"We like coming to BJ's for their appetizer menu and the beers. I particularly like their Jeremiah Red. The vibe is always hip and for the most part young. The staff could use some re-education on checking on customers promptly. Otherwise, nice place to unwind after work or chill with family or friends."
Steve S.,"Elk Grove, CA",9,4,,2.0,3/20/2015,"Mediocre food and brand beer. Occasionally, they have some decent local craft beer. It's silly that they have to serve IPA's in a little glass because ""it's stronger"". They should just come clean and say they make more money off it this way."
Cameron B.,"Portland, OR",52,50,,2.0,1/15/2016,"My jambalaya was fine, but coworker's pizza was cold and gross. Ordered an appetizer which never came so we cancelled it. Server was nice about it, but probably not going back."
Tim T.,"Sacramento, CA",245,28,,5.0,6/14/2015,Andreas is the Shizzz! The guy got all our stuff perfect and he was cool! Honestly will come back any day cause that guy! Food is always good! Service from him was excellent! Extremely pleased guests!
Paul S.,"Elk Grove, CA",151,107,52,1.0,3/25/2014,"So this is the the 2nd time Bj's restaurant let us down. Went there for dinner the 1st time and they messed up my wife's order, did not refill our drinks and even gave my daughter the wrong order. My wife complained and the corporate office was nice enough to give us an$25 gift card and apologized for the bad service. 2nd visit with the gift card. My daughter orders a turkey burger and they brought her a plan burger and all the stuff that was supposed to be on it were not. The waitress took the buyer back, they brought it back missing the mushrooms and as we looked over another customer had the same order and the same problem. I don't think the cook knows the menu..."
Ka M.,"Elk Grove, CA",16,13,8,1.0,7/13/2015,Never will be ordering online again..  The confirmation said pick it up at 11:45 pm. I get here at 11:45 pm. It is  not that busy and the front door greeter starts to help me but seats someone else as they walk in leaving me totally hanging. Then they forget a damn order and i have to wait. Its now 12:05 am... And there's people getting there pickups before me. I hope management sees this. What is the damn point of ordering in. I have a friend waiting in the car too. I will never eat here again unless its for an occasion for someone I care about! Or if im feenin for pazookie!
Shirley W.,"Montclair, CA",432,122,83,4.0,12/27/2011,"Been coming here for years now and never had a bad experience! BJ'S is one of my favorite American restaurants and I usually have all my birthday dinners here! This restaurant is always cozy and employees are always very welcoming. Customer Service is  great and this location always accommodates large parties well. I especially love the famous free birthday pizookie's. :) Best dessert hands down! There is also a bar with several flat screen TV'S, great for socializing, watching games, and just drinking! Can't wait to come here for happy hour!  Recommendations: *Chicken Wings Appetizer *Chicken Alfredo *Any pastas & pizza *Their shoestring sized fries *Strawberry Lemonade *Their Mixed Alcoholic Drinks  *Nevermind, everything is good and is worth trying! :)"
Julie K.,"Sacramento, CA",31,78,137,3.0,9/24/2011,"My first time to a BJ's!! I thought our waiter was pretty hot. He was very attentive when we arrived. We must've sent him away like 7 times when he came to take our order. We were busy chatting away the entire time, sorry hot guy.  His service was pretty good up until we ordered dessert. After we ordered the dessert, he gave us the bill before we received our dessert.  In his defense, it was pretty busy and jam-packed while we were there--apparently a norm at BJ's. Plus we were the only table that stayed there from a little before 7 until midnight. ..Still, it would've been nice to have our waters refilled again while we were having that sweet sweet dessert--and for the 2.5hours afterwards as we lounged and chatted away. Was he not satisfied with his tip on the bill? I ordered a Chicken A La Fresca, while my companion ordered his usual-- some pasta dish.  My enlightened entree was ""okay-good"": the chicken was succulent and flavorful, but the rice was buttery *dislike*!!  Luckily the mushroom sauce cloaks the buttery taste a bit, so it's not too bad if you mix it together. Portion-wise, it was decent. We had the famous Pizookie for dessert-- half white chocolate macademia nut, half chocolate chip, topped-off with a scoop of vanilla ice cream-- Did you know you can have a half-n-half Pizookie?! My companion (who's a BJ's regular btw) sure as heck didn't. Our waiter was kind enough to tell us when we were debating which of the two flavors to get. Too bad he didn't refill our waters when he took our dessert order. I suppose he could've been telling us to leave and make way for new customers by not refilling our waters.. And if that was his plan, too bad for him, it failed. We stayed there 'til closing despite being parched. Sorry, hot waiter guy. =OP""   One star off for us dying of thirst for 3+hours. Another off for the buttered rice--1) they should've put ""buttery rice pilaf"" on the menu, and 2) the buttery rice doesn't go well with the chicken!! Thank goodness for the mushroom sauce! [Guestimation on the 5hour stay: Half-hour before we were ready to order, half-hour for the food to arrive, one hour to consume, half-hour for Pizookie (arrival and consumption), and lounging about the rest of the time].--Hey, time flies when you have good company. =O)"
