Jerry V.,"Fresno, CA",0,17,2,1.0,2/28/2014,"Horrible service. They forced 6 of us to sit at a table made for 4 people with plenty of spots/tables opened. With our two large pizzas, beers, and the 6 of us, there was hardly any room left to eat. The server messed up our order and she had to come back to correct herself 3 times on one order.  Look for some place else to eat if you don't want to get frustrated."
Jennifer K.,"Galt, CA",21,8,,2.0,9/15/2015,I love the food here but very disappointed in tonight's service.  We ordered online then showed up at scheduled time. We were seated and my husband got his soup right away then we never saw a server again. No refills no communication until I flag someone down to complain.  Then he just brings us a check!  Seriously?  Ummm.  How about a refill and my dessert which I ordered online and prepaid for!  Not impressed with the online ordering experience.
Michelle L.,"Sacramento, CA",795,718,4372,3.0,9/26/2013,"One of THE happening places to be late at night if you're stuck in Elk Grove. Always, always expect trouble parking, and waiting outside for at least 25-30min for a table to open up. But hey, it's a decent restaurant chain and everything we ordered was good. Among the group, some opted for the special which was $19.95 for two people's worth of food (including appetizers and dessert)...we otherwise got avocado eggrolls, ahi tuna poke with fried wonton to start, and some beer. Main dishes ranged from pizza to fish to bison burger to calzone and macaroni and chese. On a good day the nomster in me can polish off a calzone ""for two"" but this time I got the calzone for one and the small plate of macaroni and cheese. Calzone was good, dough wasn't underdone, artichoke hearts, cheese, spinach all good together. The mac and cheese though: it looked like rotini, with a thin creamy sauce, and Goldfish crackers on top. It's saving grace was the bacon. The waiter comped us three mini pizookies so that was nice and yummy too. Roast beef dip I took to go was made right before we paid the bill so it was still warm to take home as well. They're great at accommodating us at the table for so many hours! Thanks server Elliott!"
Charlene M.,"Sacramento, CA",80,10,,2.0,8/24/2013,"There is always something wrong that happens when I come here.   Service: Always slow.  I don't think I've ever had anything close to decent service at this location.  As a former server, I have a lot of patience for the waitstaff but it always tested here.  Appetizers should not take 20 min to come out and entrees should not arrive 5 min after the appetizer.  Servers here need to be trained on how to pace their food so guests can enjoy.  Also, servers leave the food under the heat lamp for too long instead of walking it to the table right away when it is done.  I can tell this is going on because the plates are way too hot, but food is lukewarm and dry.  This happens way too often.   Food: When I go to chains, I expect consistency in their food.  This location does not have food consistency.  Everytime I go, the Avocado Egg Rolls always taste differently and have a different texture.  Theyirpasta is either too watery or not enough sauce and NEVER EVER order a steak here...the cooks don't know how to cook a steak in this location.   The only saving grace to this place is the root beer but even that sometimes gets ruined.  Sometimes they run out of frosted glasses and have served it to me in a regular glass which wouldnt be bad but they forget to put ice when they do that."
Caleb C.,"Oakdale, CA",1,2,4,4.0,1/18/2016,"Just had a great experience at BJ'S. Stacy V. is an amazing waitress and took care of us. Great recomendations, going the extra mile, and speedy service. If this was our first time here, we would have given 5 stars for sure. If you can get Stacy as your waitress, then do it. Will be a 5 star experience every time."
Eric J.,"Sacramento, CA",144,132,529,1.0,1/10/2014,"To the manager on 01.10.14: Your doors open at 11am & you had only 2 servers for the whole damn place! Are you f*cking kidding me? & when we were able to flag a server down, it took so long to get our soup & salad... Why dose it take 19min to get some pre made soup & a bag of salad put on a plate? & when the salad came they found a way to mess that up! How does that happen? & your servers even if it's busy & they can't get to a table in time, STILL they should acknowledge the person, and not walk by them like they are invisible."
Brian S.,"Sacramento, CA",330,62,4,5.0,2/10/2014,"Came here the other day after work cuz who wants to drive on 99N when its raining and there's mad traffic. Parking lot was packed as it seemed everyone in EG was there. Got the last table right next to a T.V as we wanted to catch some NBA action. Got a sampler to start, was amazing and a crap load of food, especially for 2.  The Chicken club was good, the thin fries, well cooked and seasoned. She didn't get a chance to taste her bacon burger due to the fact that the sampler filled her up.  Service was fast, our waiter/waitress were both great. We got our food very quickly. The staff seemed to be very organize, as soon as we walked in, there was a line of help waiting for their guest. As soon as a table was done, it was cleaned up and set up by the boys in black in a few minutes so the wait was cut down as much as possible."
Kristen A.,"Elk Grove, CA",1,36,87,4.0,5/16/2014,Enjoyed some great food and drinks with friends in honor of my BD. The Clementine Crush was like an adult orange cream soda! We also tried the new Salted Caramel Pazookie which was super yummy!!!!
Jamie D.,"Sacramento, CA",84,83,67,4.0,4/20/2014,"Great happy hour prices.  I always order a Jerry Burst (Jeremiah Red beer with Berry Burst cider). It is the perfect amount of sweet. The restaurant can get quite busy, but the bar area is first come, first serve.  I am disappointed that they recently changed their menu, eliminating my favorite spinach artichoke pizza."
Thanh B.,"Sacramento, CA",1511,188,1002,2.0,2/9/2012,"Good place for large parties. The customer service was good. But as for the food...Not really worth the price that I paid. Almost $20 for a plate of steak that only tasted okay. At least it was cooked right (well-done!) Most likely will not be returning. It wasn't disgusting, just not worth my time and money."
Gerald O.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,20,,5.0,8/25/2015,Service is great food is excellent every time I go there. You've got to try the balsamic glaze chicken and the clam chowder
Paul S.,"San Ramon, CA",0,44,10,4.0,4/28/2015,Nice atmosphere for family get together . Beer was chilled and pizza was hot and cheesy.
Jenny Y.,"Sacramento, CA",148,196,598,3.0,5/22/2012,"Love their pizookie!!!  The oreo one is sooooo bomb!  I like their buffalo chicken pizza. So yummy. Came here today with my cousin and the service was really good. I tried the Mozzarella Cheese w/ Tomato Salad for $3.65.  The portions were small, but it was very good.  Their strawberry lemonade is better than most restaurants, but still can't beat Red Robin's."
Rochelle M.,"Sonora, CA",2,6,2,2.0,9/9/2015,"Our waitress, Bree, was very nice.  However, I told her that I was gluten-free and she neglected to tell me that they had a gluten-free menu (Hello?!).  Maybe she was new, but she seemed experienced.  I proceeded to order something that may or may not have been gluten-free.  Anyway, I am disappointed that I mentioned that I was gluten-free and as a worker there, she should've mentioned that they have a gluten-free menu.  Next time I'll ask, but I didn't think to.  The responsibility is on the server, but patrons have to speak up because sometimes servers are clueless, or they forget."
J K.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,6,6,2.0,8/26/2013,"Service was VERY poor. We used to come here lot more with my family until we noted that service was getting worse.  After taking a break for sometime, we decided to try it again.  Unfortunately service has not gotten any better. We came Friday evening which was busy time.  We were seated in reasonable time.  But after we were seated, no one came...   After waiting 10 minutes watching other tables getting helped/served by waiter/waitress, we notified the hostess that we were not being helped.  Waitress arrived promptly after my complaint, but unfortunately she brought lot of attitude and little service.   We like their pizza and food was decent overall, but service does matter in restaurant.  And the poor service really made this yet another poor experience. -------- Update After long peril away from this place, my family decided to give it another try. They do have good beer after all. Unfortunately our experience was less than optimal.  Service was better this time but now I have serious concern for sanitation.  As we were eating, another patron threw up.  It was quite gross and smelled horrible.  But it was nothing compared to what didn't happen afterwards.  It took them over 10 minutes to get anyone to clean up.  And when someone finally came, they just wiped it with few dry towels.  And that was it!!!  Not even any water or wet towels to wipe away the stink.   We obviously lost our appetite, and since we can never look at their tables without the image of them NOT cleaning the vomit, we will never be come back here."
Jeff B.,"Elk Grove, CA",180,77,35,4.0,2/18/2014,"When my friends and I get together one of our options is ""Happy Hour""... and when we say ""Happy Hour"" it usually means BJ's.   Love their in-house brews, depending how I'm feeling it's either their Hefeweizen or Porter that I go to. They also have great season beers, during the winter the Grand Cru is a must have.  As far as food goes, everyone knows pizza is their staple, BBQ chicken! Along with that, they also have a decent happy hour menu, if I don't get pizza their sliders aren't a bad choice either.  It gets really, really, really, really busy during Happy Hour, so make sure to get there before it actually starts. Their service is decent as well, some of their staff could use some work but our regular waitress Sarah does a great job."
BT O.,"Elk Grove, CA",1,19,42,5.0,5/22/2015,Have been going to BJ's for many years. Service has always been crappy but food and drinks long make up for it. Tonight we had Nia and she was awesome. Great service which made this visit different than the usual.
Ruben K.,"Sacramento, CA",86,34,46,3.0,9/6/2014,"The place is always busy. There is good crowd that comes here and overall they have a good vibe at the bar. I've been here at-least 5 or 6 times, the food is good. However, I believe that their customer service can improve. I have often experienced rude staff members. They do have some good waiters, but some of their employees, especially the people that seat you seem un-happy and a bit un-welcoming. I hope by this message I deliver the message to the the management. However, the food has always been great. Will keep on going here, but I hope their customer service improves."
Carolyn N.,"Sacramento, CA",672,307,704,2.0,8/1/2011,"Service here is horrible. They are so slow!!! If you come here with good company, then the wait may not seem as long, but when you're starving and want to eat, the wait seems like forever! I came here several times with friends and/or family, and it never fails. They take forever. I come in at 8 and never get out of here before 10 or 11. The pizza is good, beer is good, but with such a long wait (at the door waiting to be seated and a longer wait once you're seated), it's not worth the wait."
Devona Y.,"Elk Grove, CA",169,84,35,4.0,3/10/2012,"3 words. BABY BACK RIBS. delicious :) full rack for $20 .. on the pricey side ? yeah. but it is a restaurant. And the meat is just right. It just melts off the bones. If that doesn't get you.... It does come with a giant baked potato and a choice of soup or salad. I think its worth it if you're sharing for two . $10 each person.. not too bad i'd say. & its plenty of food for two.  They got this special for mondays where selected drinks are $5.  I can only remember two drinks on that list though because those were the two me and a friend ordered. haha. It was the Lemon Drop and the Cosmopolitan.  The Cosmo was made a little bit too strong. My friend had to have the drink remade and then had grenadine added to it. But still didn't satisfy her. The lemon drop on the other hand I had no problem with. I loved the sugar they had on the rim of my cup. haha.  But anyways. Don't get me started on the pizookies though. Now thooose are delicious. It's like a must have whenever you visit Bj's. Yeah, you can make it at home but come'on it's more delicious at a restaurant.  They even got a red velvet  pizzookie!  My sweet tooth is definitely satisfied with one of these.  I always get good service here. Except.. dun dun dunnn....Today. I had called in the morning at least 5 hours beforehand for a table at 6:30. This is a reservation for my sister and her friends. And they're a couple of teens. But besides the point. The party all arrived by 6:20. You'd think it'll be alright to be seated at 6:30 on account on being early and having everyone there. Nope! The girl at the front says the wait would be 1 hour and 30 minutes. Come'on!!!!! I didn't call and set up reservations just to have them wait an 1hr30min !  I immediately asked to speak to a manager and he was nice enough to get them seated ASAP. He was really polite about it too. They got seated at 6:45, so everything was all good after that.  Oh and don't forget for parties 6+ there's is gratuity !"
