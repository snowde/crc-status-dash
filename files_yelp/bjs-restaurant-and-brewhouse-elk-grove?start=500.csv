C P.,"Elk Grove, CA",40,17,95,3.0,11/11/2013,"Came in shortly after 11am for brunch with my sister. We were seated right away which is a plus. Our food came quickly but our server wasn't very attentive to us. We sat with our glasses empty and we were looking forward to dessert. By the time she came, I lost my desire for anything else. Just sitting waiting for our check......... Tapping our fingers on the table.... 10 minutes later"
Lainie W.,"Fresno, CA",3,7,,1.0,5/12/2015,"Not even one star really. Went for brunch on Mother's Day. Service was sketchy and food was awful. Burnt french toast, rubber bacon, rubber pancakes and runny eggs when I asked for over MEDIUM! Sent it back and did NOT want them to redo it! Dirty silverware when we had to ask for it. Just awful! The waitress went to get the manager ""Brandon"", but I guess he didn't have the nerve to show his face. Terrible, terrible experience!!  They should really rethink the whole brunch deal!"
T C.,"Redding, CA",0,52,8,1.0,6/15/2015,"This is our second and last time going here. The first time, service was slow, 45+ minutes to get our food.  We wrote it off as a busy night and decided to give them a second chance. On our second visit, it took 35 minutes to get a seat and then 70 minutes to get our food once it was ordered.  On top of that, one of the people in our party ordered a burger plain.  It did not come out until 15 minutes after the rest of the party had their food.  The reason given is that it was taken to another table.  A request for ketchup and mustard took nearly 10 minutes and when the bottles were literally dropped on the table, the ketchup bottle contained about 3 table spoons of product.  It was another 5 minute wait for a fresh bottle. One more item, do not go with a group of more than six.  We tried to make reservations but they would not take one as we had seven people in our party.  They only take reservations for six or less.  This is totally asinine."
Tai D.,"Elk Grove, CA",6,27,,4.0,3/10/2016,Love the spaghetti and meatballs and fried artichoke! Very cool place to hang out to watch sports also!
Krista G.,"Elk Grove, CA",500,61,86,1.0,1/25/2016,"Tried the Curbside Pick To Go last night for dinner. First, you should never offer a service that you can't follow through on. The ONLY good thing about the experience was the online ordering. We schedule our pick up for 7:30pm. We arrived at that time and called the phone number as instructed. A girl answered and said they would be right out. 20 minutes later we called again and they said our order would be right out. 40 minutes after arriving someone finally came out. We made payment by credit card, which the server had to walk all the back into the restaurant to process. BJs can't afford mobile POS systems? The server returned with our receipt and we voiced our experience and her response was ""I'm only a Bagger."" If you're the only point of contact for a business, then your more than just a Bagger you represent the business and you should not give an excuse like that to a customer. We arrive home (we live less than 1/2 a mile away). We unpack the bag and find our order was wrong. I looked at the itemized receipt and everything we ordered was on there it just didn't make it into the bag. How hard is it to put an order together when everything is listed with the details? Seems like if your job is only a Bagger you should be excellent at it. Due to the excessive amount of time we waited, everything was cold and our ice cream was melted. Way to go BJ's."
Vicky Q.,"Sacramento, CA",68,153,264,4.0,3/3/2012,Used to come here a lot more often but now if I ever go its take out. I always have to get their pizzas! Buffalo chicken all day baby! I don't care for their entrees. It's either pizza or appetizers. I like their Santa fe rolls and ahi poke. I feel like Bj's is more of a hang out place to watch sports games than an actual restaurant but that's fine too. I just prefer to get my pizza to go and enjoy it in the comfort of my own home.
Truan N.,"Elk Grove, CA",11,21,,5.0,4/30/2015,I'm usually here once a month with friends and family for drinks and appetizers. Always enjoy the experience and environment here.
Courtney L.,"Elk Grove, CA",3,84,2,1.0,3/4/2015,"Terrible food, and service! One star is too good for this place.  My soup came out cold, my chicken Caesar salad had NO taste and the chicken was so dry i could not even chew it.  After our food was delivered my husband asked for a side of ranch  (that he also asked for when we ordered), but it never came. The server did not check on us for 20 minutes after getting our food. When she finally did com to check on us,  I had lost my appetite and just gave my salad back. After that, we could not get the server for another 40 minutes! We had to ask for the check.  Not once did someone come around with water, or ask if we needed anything. We sat for over an hour and a half with 2 empty water glasses at the end of our table. Sadly we could see a cluster of servers with a couple managers laughing and chatting off to the side.  It was busy but dinner on a Tuesday night for two people that took over 2 hours is disgraceful! The management team should be ashamed of themselves."
Kym W.,"Elk Grove, CA",41,99,116,1.0,2/9/2015,The food and service is subpar here...not sure why I keep coming back.   Ordered 2 kids side salad for my children and they literally gave them the yellow core of the iceberg lettuce. Huh?!??   I was too tired to send it back.   I really felt like the server should have seen the yellow lettuce when she was bringing it out and taken it back...but she didn't.   Go figure...I keep saying I'm not coming back and every time my kids talk me into coming back again...hopefully I will be strong enough to say NO the next time that they ask.
Chunky P.,"Sacramento, CA",18,124,307,4.0,1/23/2015,"Good happy hour spot or place just to hang out. They have various beers from all around. Try thwir avocado eggroll. The boyfriend and I usually order deep dish pizza, which is okay, and jambalaya which is sometimes a hit or miss with how salty it can get. We usually however end up having a fun time after several beers, we like to try different ones."
Tika L.,"Sacramento, CA",0,42,22,5.0,4/17/2015,Came in to celebrate our son's birthday. The food was great (as always). Received excellent customer service from our waiter Taylor. He was friendly and upbeat ! Although his area was  really busy at the time he  checked on us often and handled the rush like a pro!
Raf G.,"Sacramento, CA",141,206,53,3.0,8/15/2013,"When a place has way too many items on the menu it may be a sign they don't do many of them well, such is the case here.  Have to stick to basics here, like chicken alfredo, burgers, big baked potatoes.  I thought I was keeping to the basics by ordering their all meat pizza, but it was under cooked even though it was brought to me 10 minutes after everyone else got their meal.  It wasn't hot and the cheese not melted in the middle.  It would have been good if it was cooked all the way, but they must have forgot to make it and rushed it out.  I would have given it 2 stars for that, but the waitress was nice an took the pizza off me bill so that was a great save by her. Good place for a beer and eat, just don't order anything too complicated."

Deborah B.,"Elk Grove, CA",4,17,14,4.0,7/24/2015,"First of all, I just wanted to mention the service was great. Our server was very friendly and attentive and had a good sense of humor. When it comes to service, I have nothing to complain there. 5 stars for the service!! I have come here a couple of times for half off wine days on Tuesdays.  When I do, I usually get, the Unlimited Soup & Salad Bowl of house made soup and a house, Caesar, wedge or fresh mozzarella and tomato salad (unlimited refills). Which is really good.  I love the Chicken Tortilla Soup (Clam chowder is not too bad either). Today I was with family celebrating an upcoming wedding.  I ordered a Malbec red wine and it had turned sour.  The waiter was very apologetic and said that he would get a fresh bottle and glass for me.  It took some time to get, but I had water with lemon to quench my thirst.  Probably a healthier choice.  Anyway, when it came time to order I decided to step out of the box, with a Thai Chicken Mango Salad.  Grilled, marinated chicken breast, chili spiced jicama and mango strips, red bell peppers and red onions on a bed of mixed baby greens, Bibb lettuce and arugula tossed in sweet citrus chili dressing. Topped with avocado, mint, green onions, sesame seeds and won ton crisps.  Might I say .....????  It was excellent.  The dressing especially. This is something I would order again."
Mei W.,"Sacramento, CA",275,567,1704,3.0,11/30/2011,"This place has great Happy Hour specials as far as drinks & appetizers! They have TV's in the bar area so it would be a great place to catch a game! Great spot to hang out with friends on a late night.  I would highly recommend ordering their Whatta Peach drink & personal pizza during happy hour! YUM! I come here occasionally for lunch and I love their Santa Fe salad! It's topped with avocado, chips, vegetables & a grilled salmon -- deeeelicious. They have great $6.95 lunch specials with a variety of choices to choose from. This place is great for large dinner gatherings.  They have a variety of food to choose from so you know your guests will be satisfied! I would probably recommend making reservations for dinner because this place does get packed."
Yulisa S.,"Elk Grove, CA",159,3,,1.0,5/16/2015,Seated a larger party before my friend and I. We are two people. The party had 6 people they got there like half an hour after us.
Lavon R.,"Acampo, CA",26,10,,2.0,4/16/2016,"SERVICE SUCKS We went to BJ's on Friday 4/15 12:45 PM name was taken and 2 other parties were ahead of us.  Three guys came in after us and gave their names to be seated.  Two parties ahead of us were called and seated, 3 business guys were called before us and seated then we were called and was seated right behind the 3 guys.  Waitress came and took our drink order, drinks came.  Waitress came back took our order, I ordered a burger my husband a sandwich.   We waited 45 mins and still no food.  Waitress came back one time and said your food will be out in one minute, 25 mins later still no food by that time it was almost an hour waiting.  We got up and left  and noticed  and on our wait out the 2 ladies who came in after us and were seated had just about finished eating their meals, strange we were seated and ordered before them. That was our first and last trip there.  Not very friendly and waitress came only to our table 2 times. bring our drinks and tell us our food would be out in 1 min..  I guess they thought a couple of senior citizens didn't really matter .

Heather M.,"Elk Grove, CA",3,13,,3.0,5/12/2014,"Had a nice Mother's Day dinner here, somehow we were seated immediately even though they were busy. I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken and it was delicious. I would have put more seasoning on it, but it was still very good. My daughter ordered mini burgers and loved them! My son and husband both ordered the baby back ribs. They were passable, but not good. My husband shared a rib with me but I gave it back after eating a bite. Very bland unless slathered in BBQ sauce, kind of tough and they had that precooked/reheated flavor that meat sometimes gets. Also, my very berry cider was rather weak but refreshing anyway. Don't order the ribs unless you like getting ripped off, but everything else was great. I'd go again to try a pizza and a pizookie!"
Rodney B.,"Elk Grove, CA",82,38,116,2.0,5/9/2011,"Summary: The food was mostly good, the service...not so much. I've eaten at this BJ's several times since it opened. They have a delicious clam chowder and a great wedge salad.  We decided to stop here for a Mother's Day brunch and were surprised how short the wait time was.  Our party of 5 was seated pretty quickly and we ordered right away. The Service: The waitress didn't want to put in my ""spicy bloody mary"" order in with the bartender since she said ""it's comes from a mix and it already comes spicy"" (I've had spicy bloody marys there before). They were supposed to be featuring a white berry tini for May (Mother's Day) and when my wife ordered it the waitress said they were ""out"". When I asked which ingredient was out, she said ""it comes premixed, so I'm not sure. I'll ask the manager"". Later she came back and said the manager would be coming by to talk to us and that they ""found"" the ingredients to the white berry tini. The manager came by and poured the cocktail, but didn't say a word to us. I asked what happened with the berry tini and he said they were out of the monin syrup, but they just got some in.  My wife tasted the drink and it tasted like cough syrup. My meal came out with less than half the eggs it was supposed to have. I waited for about 10 minutes for the waitress to come by and check us with no luck.  I was pretty surprised by the lackadaisical attitude showed by the waitress and manager. Even when they were made aware of issues, they didn't seem to want to actually engage. Just a quick ""I don't know"" or waiting for us to ask for an update. The Food: The french toast itself was delicious. Crisp on the outside and perfectly cinnamony. My wife loved her salad and my kids ate all of the dishes they ordered (captain crunch crusted french toast sticks, macaroni and cheese, and a grilled cheese sandwich). We ordered pizookies for dessert and they were all great....except for my wife's which was overcooked and hard as a rock (instead of chewy and gooey like the description). Even then, she said the flavor of the pizookie was great, but it was just way overcooked. By the end of the meal we just had to laugh at how bad the service was and how lackadaisical our waitress (and manager) seemed. I'd probably still go back for the food but I'd order it to go to avoid the service. I think I've spoiled myself by eating at so many of the great  non-chain restaurants here in Sacramento."
Christine M.,"West Sacramento, CA",0,6,1,5.0,11/7/2014,"I would like to preface this by saying: I do not typically enjoy chain restaurants.  I find them to be somewhat generic, impersonal, streamlined, corporate and I think those qualities can put a damper on a quality dining experience.  That being said, I truly enjoyed my experience at Bjs in Elk Grove. Though it was fairly busy, the host And hostesses were friendly, polite and handling the rush with great poise.  While we waited for our table we had cocktails at the bar. I've had trouble in the past being able to grab a drink while I wait for my table, problems range from unfriendly staff, too crowded areas, slow service,etc- it can be exasperating and can sometimes put a damper on the whole evening.  Luckily, this was not the case.  The bar staff was warm and friendly, though obviously busy.  The bartenders were patient and helpful While I choose a drink- I finally decided on one of the bartenders recommendations, Top Shelf Margarita, while my boyfriend had a Jeremiah Red.  Unlike other bars, we were able to be greeted, order and receive our drinks in only a few moments. While we waited in the bar area I observed the staff and servers. Many times in ""rush. Hour"" servers can be stressed and frazzled when they are attempting to juggle all the aspects of their jobs, but it really seemed that everyone was getting along, working together and taking the busy hours in stride. Also, the manager, Vanessa, seemed to be successfully involved in the entire process. It's incredibly refreshing to see a corporate restaurant manager really involved in the entire guest experience- which I think starts with backing up her front of the house people. Vanessa had caught our attention when alcohol transformed some preciously pleasant patrons into something less than desire able.The guests were unsatisfied with the  wait time for a table, and were frankly acting, in my opinion,  verbally abusive towards her as well as the staff. She expertly defused the situation and prevented further disruption to the entire restaurant.  She was calm, rational and handled what could have been an embarrassing conflict with poise and professionalism.  When we were seated our server, Nia, was pleasant and enthusiastic.  She seemed to genuinely be in good spirits, which, as I stated before, has not been my typical experience in chain restaurants.  The pizza we ordered was good; however I do prefer my pizza with plenty of sauce.  I have never tasted such a rich and delicious crust before. The manager from the incident at the bar did personally greet our table and we commended her for the way she handled the confrontation earlier, as well as how well her staff was preforming that evening.  We had (or I had!) the salted carmel pizookie for dessert and it was decadent and so worth all the calories! Though I don't frequent ""chain"" restaurants often, I truly did find my experience at Bjs to be enjoyable.  When people have a strong, dedicated manager, or leader, it reflects in almost all areas of the business.  I believe it truly is a feat to be as busy as the Bjs in Elk Grove is and to not buckle under the pressure of the ""rush.""  I believe the success can be attributed to strong leadership, as well as a talented group of people who work so well together.  With so many amazing restaurants competing for business, it's the restaurants with friendly, outgoing and genuine staff that help restaurants to stand out amongst the crowd. I apologize for the length of this review, I just believe good work should be rewarded with good feedback and Bjs Elk Grove, has made me a ""regular"" at Bjs from now on, thanks to Vanessa and her team!"
