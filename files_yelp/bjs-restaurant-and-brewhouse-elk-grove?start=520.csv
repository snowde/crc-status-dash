Jessica C.,"Sacramento, CA",2,65,69,5.0,3/1/2014,"First time I tried this restaurant with my sister I was skeptical but excited at the same time. I've heard good and bad about this restaurant so I figured it was time for me to try it myself. I ordered the classic combo pizza to share with my sister, and OMG delishhhhh. The crust was crisp and the toppings were plentiful. When it came time for the bill, we were offered the free rewards cards that came with a free pizookie if we signed up, how could we say no?? It was my first pazookie ever, and it was love at first bite. So rich and flavorful and definitely a must try for all you sweet toothed eaters out there. Service was great everyone was so nice. Definitely a great first experience here, will be returning soon."
shalini c.,"Rocklin, CA",811,185,1358,3.0,9/30/2011,"It's BJs. I've been to several other ones, and I know what to expect. I came here for lunch the other day. What I love is how reasonably priced their lunch specials are. I ordered the wedge salad (HOLY YUM), and the clam chowder. The chowder was unfortunately pretty bland. I had an iced tea to drink, and the waitress brought me a container filled with only artificial sweeteners. Do people not use real sugar anymore? I asked a couple of times for normal sugar, and never got it :("
Sherrine K.,"Davis, CA",107,49,6,1.0,8/4/2015,"The food is good don't get me wrong, but when you have service 3 times in a row that's shitty.... I think that was my family's last time going there. Each occasion we were judged by how we were dressed.  Occasion 1: dressed well due to going out shopping in Walnut Creek and returning back to EG and not wanting to cook. The server seemed to have a bad day, and took that out on us. She never came by to see how the food was tasting, nor did she make the experience extraordinary... So we felt she didn't really deserve a tip. We left 10% because we aren't assholes. I for one am a bartender prior, and have never had or given such stupid service. Keep your mood elsewhere. Because when she came to pick up the check, this pretentious little server decided to gawk at it and what? You think you deserve 20$ for not doing anything for us??? We saw the busser more than you! Occasion 2: We had a long day during Ramadan, and didn't want to cook a terribly long meal. So we came out here again, despite the bad service. Now dressed in PJ's, basically, we received bad service again from this man. He was taller, had brown hair, and looked about 27. He frickin doesn't give us service. He spent more times at the other tables than ours. He would laugh with them, and then come to us and look at us like we weren't worth his time. Jokes on him, my mom owns one of the most prestigious salons and is well off, and my man runs a luxury car dealership. So we aren't broke. But for bad service, I notice all this stuff. Because at my old restaurant job, we were told never to treat anyone bad or to judge by looks. Just to GIVE GOOD SERVICE.  Occasion 3: This is where I was BEYOND LIVID. We came back from a wedding, and since eating super early, we came in later in the evening and wanted to eat again. Now we love the food which is why we come here, but this is our last time coming for sure. We had a thicker lady server who looked 30 something. She was okay at first, but I saw that the male server from Occasion 2 spoke with her while walking away... (i know this tactic. ""Watch out they aren't gonna tip you well.""). As soon as she came back we all noticed she was different. She gave us glares, shook her head when walking away when we weren't ready to place an order, and never really refilled waters... Sipping on ice is not cool. They wanted to give her $40 dollar tip on a $110 dollar check because they were in good spirits from the wedding, but we were arguing because honestly she didn't deserve it. Especially with her tag team partner. I don't know how much in the end they tipped because I was irked and left early.  Management: CHOOSE BETTER SERVERS. Not older entitled people who use serving as their career because they couldn't get a normal job due to their attitude and judgmental behavior.  I really wanted to have your food for my birthday, but I steered clear away because I didn't want to deal with this another time."
Amrita S.,"Oakland, CA",0,19,2,5.0,1/31/2016,"Carlie was our waitress and she was amazing!! She started great conversations with my family and even recommended mixing Apple juice with water so it wouldn't be too sugary for my baby! Something no one ever takes the time to do for us. She also told me the veggies may be to hard for our kid which was great so we could go with a better option! Thanks Carlie, you're the best!!"
Maribelle U.,"Elk Grove, CA",173,30,10,5.0,2/18/2015,"One of my kids' favorite restaurants to go. Love the small bites. This place is always packed, so noisy level is pretty moderate. Servers here are friendly and very attentive."
Bryan A.,"Helendale, CA",245,32,16,2.0,1/8/2015,"The food was decent, and the wait wasn't too bad.  The service was lackluster...our server had a negative attitude, and another one of the staff sneezed before serving our food (and there's no way he washed his hands before passing out our food).  Also, it's a bit too loud here... Get a pizookie to go.  That's about all they're worth visiting for."
Rustdogg W.,"Galt, CA",0,28,1,2.0,4/25/2015,Other than watching waitresses walk past my empty ice tea glass for the duration of my meal and the cold french fries and french dip I ordered...it was great....the help is stretched so thin at BJ's than they become ineffective. ...my meal for me and my girl cost 42 dollars.....unreal to pay that for lunch and leave very unhappy....save ur money u can get cold food at any fast food place.

Terry M.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,3,1,1.0,3/17/2015,"Al we wanted to was have dinner. We had a party of 5, the Hostess took my name and gave me a  pager to let me know when the table was ready.  She said it would take 15-20 minutes.  We sat outside and I posted on facebook that we were here getting ready to eat.  At about 45 minutes a party of 7, who came in well after us, was called to be sat.  I followed that party in and showed my pager to the Hostess.  She asked me how many we had in the party.  The three Hostesses at the stand looked at each other(knowing they forgot us) one said "" go get your party and we can seat you now"".  We were seated at our table and watched employees pass us by numerous times. We had enough time to read the entire menu. My sons got to color the entire kids menu and play all the games on them.  No one except the Hostess who sat us even looked at our table. We waited there at our table for 10 maybe 15 minutes for no one to serve. And No One did a great job. We got up and left and went across the street to eat. Should be zero stars.  All we wanted to do was have dinner."
Lycan L.,"Rocklin, CA",0,14,,1.0,9/22/2016,"I usually love BJ's and the food has always been good but I went to this location and had the worst service ever. I went with my brother and 4 business partners and all I ordered was a burger. This female waitress took my order and we waited until we had a bigger table to sit at because the table we had was small, but anyways we all ordered and switch tables. Everybody received there food except me, and at first I thought they were just taking time to make my burger but then 25 minutes passed and I still haven't received my food so I waited for the waitress to come back. She walked pass and ask if I was okay I told her I haven't gotten my food but she was in her own world and just said glad to hear like I said something else and walked off and I waited another 15 minutes. She finally walks by again and I told her my dilemma and she said oh really let me check. She finally comes back and says the servers drop my burger at the wrong table and basically made me waited for no reason. I'm pretty piss at this moment because my whole group was basically done with there food while I'm still waiting, she tells me they'll have your burger any minute and she walks off. 35 minutes pass and I still waiting for my burger and then she finally brings my burger and man was I disappointed. The burger was greasy from top to bottom and seem like they rushed it and it just tasted soggy and gross. I can't believed I paid for a crappy burger with crappy service, I'm never coming to this BJ again. I rather stick with the one in Rocklin  or some other location because they know how to treat customers right."
Amy C.,"Newark, CA",1518,982,1731,5.0,8/19/2011,"We gots the Bj's favorite deep dish pizza. It was uber yummy!  Soft + crunchiness + flavorful = yum yum yum! Then I really wanted a pizookie so we gots the Triple chocolate pizookie which by the way was way too sweeeeeet. Yeah, and I like sweet stuff & it was too sweet even for me.  Service is friendly & pretty fast. Decor is very consistent with other Bj's locations. Looks exactly the same.  I love Bj's............ not what you're thinking, perverts =P"
Janice F.,"Sacramento, CA",136,13,7,5.0,2/10/2015,Very kind server. I feel like the entrees got a little bigger pazookie are always on point!
Angie A.,"Sacramento, CA",0,1,,1.0,2/29/2016,"DO NOT EAT AT THIS LOCATION!!!! I went to dinner last night and my food had not one not two but multiple hairs that looked like pubs! We were sitting at the bar and when the staff and bartender who was serving us heard how disgusted I was they just walked to the back and did nothing about it. Never again will I eat here, I'm horrified!"
Nancy T.,"Elk Grove, CA",24,4,1,3.0,3/13/2015,"Riddle me this. Why do they have call ahead seating for parties 6 or less but not for parties larger than that? Is it not easier and faster to seat parties with less people? Therefore, larger parties should be able to call ahead for seatings! I love the food here, but that concept just does not make sense. I am sitting here waiting for a table for seven while I've seen 5 couples seated who have came after me. That is why larger groups should be able to call ahead for seating, giving staff more time to be able to pull together seats."
Marissa H.,"Elk Grove, CA",4,13,,3.0,6/30/2013,"Just came here with my family. If I was basing this review on the way the (3) hosts greeted me when I walked in, that rating would be in the negatives. Extremely rude and didn't seem to want to be there at all and couldn't care less about customer service.  Besides that, the waitress saved this review. Extremely friendly and fast service for how busy it was. Food was phenomenal.  I always hesitate to come in here because I know there will always be a wait and limited parking. I also know that when I walk in the door I will be glared at by the hosts standing around talking. But the food is worth it most of the time."
Nicholas M.,"Sacramento, CA",51,36,35,4.0,1/11/2014,"This place is my default place to go for beer and appetizers. I love getting the in-house brews, but you won't be disappointed by their dishes.  If I'm not just ordering appetizers, I'll order their Jambalaya. This place is one only places where I might make happy hour during the week, as I work late and they have a Sun-Thurs 10-close happy hour.  I think that happy hour on the weekends is from 3-7, but don't quote me on that. If you happen to be in here during fall, order the pumpkin ale if it's available as it's delicious! If you've got a sweet tooth, order the Pizookie of your choice. I sometimes get in the mood for dessert and it's hard to find something as delicious as a fresh Pizookie."
Stephanie M.,"Sacramento, CA",25,57,21,4.0,1/2/2014,"So what can i say about BJ's..amazing food, not so good serivice I always call in advance to get a table and always end up waiting close to an hour before i get seated. we actually got forgotten about one time and waited almost 2 hours! after you are seated you will probably wait another hour before you get served.  yes the food is great but by the time you get your food youre so hungry youve almost lost the appetite. I wish they would have something like complementary chips and salsa if theyre going to have you wait so long for food. overall, this is a great place to eat at but try to not go during the weekend, wait times are way too long."
The Rau Ranch R.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,19,12,4.0,12/30/2014,"Called ahead for seating, found out they made a mistake on their part once we arrived.  They did fix the issue, all good!"
Denise F.,"Discovery Bay, CA",80,1017,209,2.0,1/8/2013,"I came in here with friends because other places were jam packed on the weekend...I just got a pizza..and it was sopping wet with grease at the bottom of the pan!! Not to mention the service was bad, it was busy..which I completely understand, but our glasses were sitting empty for sooooo long, it was tempting to just leave money on the table & walk out. Then topping that off with a sponge of grease aka pizza...I don't think I'll be returning to this location any time in the future."
John Y.,"Langley, WA",0,7,,2.0,2/20/2016,My office is next door to this location and we eat here frequently.  This was my worst experience at any BJs. We were seated in a section that didn't have a waiter assigned. Others seated after us were served well before us.  Poor management.
