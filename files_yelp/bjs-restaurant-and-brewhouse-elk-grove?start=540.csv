Bea W.,"Elk Grove, CA",1,16,,1.0,5/11/2015,Food was okay. The service was lousy. We sat at our table for more than 30 minutes before someone finally came and helped us
J S.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,2,,2.0,3/12/2016,Pizza suck for the price. The whole time I was eating It I was thinking how it's not much different than Pizza Hut.
Brandon L.,"Elk Grove, CA",65,389,373,4.0,8/7/2014,"What I like about BJ's is the section of food they have on the menu.  You can have pizza, meatloaf, burger, chicken wings, fish, pasta, soup, and many more items.  The foods I have tried have all be tasty.  The pizza is actually not bad.  I believe it's more of a deep dish style and they have many toppings and specialty pizzas.  What goes perfect with pizza?  BEER!!!!  They have many selection of beers.  Ranging from their own crafted ones on tap to the domestic and imported beers in a bottle.  And if beer is not what you prefer they have a full bar with many tvs to watch sports.  They do have a happy hour where some drinks are at a discount and some of the appetizers are half off.  The service has be great here.  They ask you if you want refills and if everything is delicious.  This place can get crowded and wait times can be long.  If you can find seating at the bar you can just grab it with out waiting.  I will be back soon!"
Lien V.,"Elk Grove, CA",172,133,355,3.0,9/7/2013,I love there Happy Hour menu. They have a strawberry mojito that is delicious! I usually order the berry cider also but now that I've tried the mojitos here I have a change of heart. The miso salmon is pretty good also.
Tila T.,"Sacramento, CA",339,393,447,3.0,3/23/2011,"I like this place because the food is consistently well prepared and the beers on tap are delicious.  However, I still think the place is hyped for what they actually offer.  The prices are fairly expensive and the staff is a hit or miss.   They incorrectly make use of the term ""happy hour"" as there is nothing very much happy about it.  The bar area at this time is usually hella packed (at least a 20-30 minute wait), but in that time you can drive on over to any other American-food establishment and enjoy a meal and beer without having to fight for a seat.  $1 off beers? Come on..... Like I mentioned, the food and beer are good, but so are such items at other places in Elk Grove."
Ajay S.,"Sacramento, CA",83,26,56,5.0,8/7/2014,great place to eat n drink alcohol. Restaurant alway clean n good services....
Brittney G.,"Sacramento, CA",174,2,,5.0,1/18/2016,"I came into BJ'S the other night, and I continue to come because it is my favorite restaurant. It was particularly busy so I decided to try out a table in the bar. My server Daniela was wonderful. She was extremely professional and knowledgeable regarding the menu. We shared many laughs and had great conversation. Hands down my best experience here in 5 years."
Dana C.,"Lodi, CA",708,491,855,5.0,7/16/2011,"Went to BJ's for lunch today with a friend.  I've been to this location in the past and received just o-k service, but if I'm rating my review solely off of today's experience... I give five stars. We sat on the edge of the dining room by the enterance.  Our waiter was prompt, personable, and accurate.  Our drinks never ran out, out empty plates were quickly taken away, and the waiter didn't pressure us to order, even though the restaurant was busy. My friend and I had the mini pizza which was good, I had the garden salad and my friend had the cream of tomato soup.  Everything tasted great and the pizza came out hot.  This experience makes me want to come back for more!!"
Rich M.,"Sacramento, CA",0,20,4,1.0,8/7/2016,"This one star is for my waiter only. If not for him I would give 0 stars if I could. I thought I was going to go out with the family for dinner and have a good night. My whole day was wonderful until I got to BJ's. I checked in and they said it would be a 30-40 min wait and would text me when ready. So far so good. 40 min wait on a fri night not bad. Then 45 min go by and I decided to go check on my table. When I ask how much longer till I'm seated the girls in the front told me they already called me. I was right out front of the restaurant and could hear them calling everyone else but me and no text. Then another girl checked the list and said they didn't call me and instead of looking at me in my face and just telling me herself, she puts her head down and tells the girl next to her to tell me I would be seated next. then I sit back down and no more then 5 min they called another party of 5 when I'm also a party of 5. Then I went in to ask why they couldn't seat me and they said well we did tell u it would be a 30 to 40 min wait. Now a totally different girl talking out her ass before she knows  what's going on. Then the girl who took my name told her Ive been waiting for almost an hour. So instead of admitting they skipped me they don't know what to do and all get stuck, and I have to just tell them to ""just make something happen"" before any of them move and even try to figure something out. It's so sad that's who they have running there greeting. Ow yeah.... And when I finally got seated and got my food, I find a hair in my good. I come here all the time, but this was by far one of my worse restaurant experiences I have ever had I will never return to BJ's to support there business."
Eva B.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,7,1,5.0,2/3/2016,Carlie G was awesome. She was very friendly and made sure we had our drinks filled the entire time. She checked in on us consistently to make sure we were satisfied.
Jasmine C.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,186,237,4.0,8/4/2013,"Oh my, the wait! We had a large party and arrived with a couple of other smaller parties ahead of us. But we didn't expect to wait almost two hours for a table. We were all staving by the time we were seated and then on top of that we had to wait for the food to come out. Some of our hunger changed to empty stomach pain by then. Furthermore, I think they were waiting on ONE party's table to leave to seat us in, but honestly we could have combined two smaller tables... Service was great. Food was good. Yay to the Five Meats pizza and pizookie!"
AM P.,"Sacramento, CA",8,105,11,5.0,7/31/2014,"While having a rough day...... Having a friendly waitress helped me/us get through our night.  Casey was very wonderful and pleasant the entire time we were there.  The 5-stars is really just for her.  The food wasn't bad, but this review is mainly based on Casey.  Thank you Casey for such wonderful service!"
D C.,"Carmichael, CA",7,23,4,1.0,9/11/2015,"Went with entire family for double birthday celebration and had worst experience ever.  We were ok at first but then female server kept forgetting things we asked for, giving my daughter weird looks, and treated us like an after thought in general we became concerned.  It's rare that we can get everyone together for a dinner due to work schedules, etc.  so when the evening started falling apart we were disappointed. The birthday cookies came out before waitress asked if anyone else wanted a dessert.  Once we ordered our desserts the bday girls had to leave and our cookies were like rocks. Drinks were not refilled and the food was not that great.  We only went here because it was bday girls choice but next time I'll decide!"
Billy A.,"Sacramento, CA",31,141,205,1.0,12/14/2014,Let's just say I have a family member who worked here not too long ago and I used to love eating here until he told me a few things that go on behind those kitchen doors. Food being dropped on the floor and still served to customers because they have to get it out on the table within a certain amount of time. Yuck! Apparently this happens quit often. I have been going to the Arden location since it opened and this location for a few months now but that won't be happening anymore. :/ sucks because I love some of there food.
Sean H.,"Miami Beach, FL",13,19,3,3.0,6/13/2015,Very busy on a weeknight and... Well ... Bjs is Bjs. Its as good as can be expected. I enjoy some of the food but not all and the happy hour to me is pretty much a joke. Good pizza though!
Cheryl A.,"Elk Grove, CA",68,32,4,2.0,9/7/2012,"Like the food here. But they don't seem interested in getting business. They ""claim"" they do reservations for a party of just 10 or more. So I call for a party of 20 for the next day. It's for a birthday. He says ""oh, we don't take parties that large at that time"" excuse me? WHY? Cause its busy? That's why I am calling to reserve you stupid ass! Nope, they refuse to let me make a reservation unless I want like 4:30 or after 9pm. What a freaking joke!!! We won't be giving them our business any longer. We were thinking about just showing up tomorrow when we want but from what he said on the phone it looks like they will just refuse a party that size.  Very sad and very stupid."
Tiffany M.,"Sacramento, CA",319,482,537,2.0,5/30/2011,"I've been to many other BJ's Restaurants before, but this one I have complaints about. I came here late Monday night after the Glee Concert at the Power Balance Pavilion. I don't know if it was because we were a group coming in before closing, but the waiter was not very happy. He was very snobby, and he got the vibe he was having trouble with his other tables, and just blasting his frustrations on our table. 1st: He throws the drink coasters to us. Basically not placing them nicely in front of each guest. 2nd:  My Strawberry Mojito tasted like salt. Sent it back, and he gave me a SOTB. And charged me. Argh. I dono. This experience was wack."
Ben A.,"Sacramento, CA",140,67,76,4.0,5/14/2014,"I can appreciate chain restaurants for consistency,  service, and quality.  Bj's took the Sacramento area by storm a few years ago and they've lost no momentum!  The elk grove location caters to families mostly and is very tame by comparison to the Arden and Natomas restaurants.  I've said it once and I'll say it again, their signature cocktails are overpriced and quite weak.  I stick to highballs (rum&coke. Gin&tonic) or Jeremiah Red craft beer.  Bjs is a cool spot for friends and family.  You know what to expect and they've never let me down."
Briget P.,"East Bay, CA",1071,988,157,4.0,1/4/2011,"I usually come here for their late night happy hour. Their bar area is wide enough and spacious to fit a good amount of folks. Their buffalo wings are pretty good and I usually order their Blonde beer--the closest thing to a Blue Moon. Great atmosphere and service is usually good. For lunch, I like to order their crispy chicken sandwich with honey mustard which comes with a side of seasoned potato wedges. Great dish."
Lillian P.,"Elk Grove, CA",9,4,,3.0,11/26/2014,3 stars for mediocre food but a great friend and family atmosphere. Their portion is huge and is enough to fill your stomachs.
