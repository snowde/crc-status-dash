Patricia W.,"Elk Grove, CA",35,25,8,2.0,10/31/2014,"I love BJs food BUT their ""to go"" service is horrible!! I placed an order got there at the correct time and had to wait 15 mins because of their disorganization. It literally took 15 mins for them to get together another customers order.   Then I get all the way to the car to find out I'm missing an entree I've paid for!!!!"
Kaila M.,"Elk Grove, CA",1,1,,5.0,1/19/2016,"My husband and I had dinner here this evening and were thrilled with the service we received. Our waitress Victoria was very friendly and accommodating. She made an absurd number of trips to refill my husband's Diet Coke, which made him very happy, all with a smile! We will definitely be coming back to visit our new friend Victoria in the near future."
Koko M.,"Newark, CA",302,209,3969,3.0,4/24/2013,"This was my first time at this particular location.. I highly recommend the BJS ROOTBEER!!!  OMG.... TOO DELICIOUS!  Watch out the alcohol can sneak up on you if you don't drink often.  *laughs*  Tons of goodtimes to be had with decent food, plus they play sporting events on the televisions in the bar."
Maizel C.,"San Jose, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/24/2014,Came here friday for dinner for the first time.  The service here is horrible.  We waited for our table for 45 minutes  then 45 minutes for our food then came to find out that the apetizer we ordered was sold to another customer.  I've asked our server to just serve my daughters food because she is hungry.    But what we noticed was the table that were seated after us was given there orders right away.  I hate to think that we are asian and they are white has something to do with it.
Teresa M.,"Sacramento, CA",182,72,49,3.0,8/15/2012,"This place gets packed! From am to pm! this review is for my visit earlier the year, March 2012) Food: Chicken Fettuccine in Alfredo Sauce, I really enjoyed the pasta but not the chicken part. I wanted to enjoy it but it was just so bland and chewy. Took me too long to chew the strip of chicken just so i can swallow it. They portion was just right, not skimpy. The pizza here was different from the pizza i eat. Here it was fluffy and deep dished. We had the cheese burger pizza or somethin like that, It didnt taste as good as I hear.  Service: Nothing spectacular, nothing amazing. They are just too busy to really give you the service you deserve. It's pretty much you get seated, they take order and come back with food and rarely check on you. Drinks takes forever to be refilled. They get busy so it is understandable, but when you see them chatting it off while youre waiting 20 minutes after being seated (not including the 15+ minutes wait to be seated)... Gets annoying amd irritating. This place isn't what I would expect, due to the fact it's always busy... until a better visit, i wouldn't recommend this place for good food or service. No RSVP unless group of 10+ (someone told me 12)"
Grant W.,"Elk Grove, CA",10,8,,1.0,10/17/2012,"Heard great reviews about the food so had to try this place out. After multiple visits I have come to realize a few things. First, the Restaurant is always packed. Hope you're not that hungry when you visit, because you'll most likely be waiting forty five minutes to an hour. I was offered to sit at the bar, which was packed, but not exactly what I wanted with a date in tow. Second, the service is terrible! Don't expect to be greeted at the door, they're too busy trying to cram people into tables. If you're lucky enough to sit down, order right then and there or you'll be waiting a while for a return visit from the wait staff. Third, the food was good. Only redeeming quality this place has. The price for the food though is another story. With sub-par service, not sure how this place continues to be packed full of people."
Cynthia A.,"Elk Grove, CA",14,34,,1.0,1/19/2015,"I ABSOUTELY CAN NOT STAND THIS PLACE!!! The 2 times we have gone have been disasters. First time, an hour wait!! Tonight, HORRIBLE SERVICE!! I asked our waitress for sugar my iced tea, never got it.  Then she picked up my plate before I was done eating. We have a gift card we are giving away. As we speak, I have a horrible stomach ache as well. AWFUL!! NOISY!! CRAPPY SERVICE, FOOD THAT MAKES YOU SICK!! I will NEVER step foot into any BJ'S. Not even if you paid me. WORST RESTAURANT EVER. I'd rarely eat at Denny's any day. Better service, and food that doesn't make you sick  and is not noisy. This place should be out of business."
Alex T.,"Sacramento, CA",1316,1002,6438,3.0,5/26/2014,the service here wasnt the best seemed like the table behind us got better service. it really just depends on the waiter or waitress. the food is always good here. and no dissapoint. the srvice is just if ur lucky that day who u get. the server heard me wrong when I said I wanted wedge cut fries over the thin ones but ther server let me keep both so score. tried the roast beef sandwich and it was great.
Wanda U.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,20,,2.0,1/12/2016,This BJ's never fails to disappoint. I haven't been here in about 4 months because of my last experience. But my daughter wanted to come here for her birthday. It took a long time to get our food and even longer got them to bring out my balsamic chicken. Everyone at the table had been eating for about 10 minutes when my food was served. The chicken tasted horrible. It was like chewing on rubber and had an odd flavor. I've had this dish before so something went wrong. The manager never came to check on why it was returned. Whatever. This place sucks
Scott G.,"Elk Grove, CA",127,10,2,4.0,1/26/2013,The pizza here is amazing! I've been here several times and the only reason I wouldn't give it a 5-star rating is because the service can be pretty slow sometimes but I do know the servers are trying their best
G S.,"Sacramento, CA",1,3,4,4.0,10/26/2013,"Came here for lunch today with a friend. I ordered ""BJs Favorite"" personal deep dish pizza and a salad. For the size I ordered it would've been $14.95 and $2.35 extra for the salad. The waiter then mentioned that for a couple dollars more I can get the pizza special for 2 (and just save the rest for dinner). It came with a bigger pizza, choice of salad or soup, and a pizzokie to finish it all off. All of that for $19.95!!! So of course, I opted for that instead. I also got the Oktoberfest beer just to be festive. My friend ordered the shrimp jambalaya which was what I was originally going to get. The pizza was just ok. The sausages on there didn't look that great. And, I'm not sure but it didn't seem cooked all the way. I had a lot leftover and ate it that night. It was not good at all. Normally, you can eat leftover pizza cold but this one had to be heated up! The salad was good though. I had more than enough being just a side salad. The beer was good too. I had a taste of my friend's jambalaya and it was delicious. Perfect amount of spice. So, as far as food goes, it all depends on what you order.  Service was great. Our waiter had great customer service and was very helpful with the meal. He definitely helped me get the most out of my money! Wish I remembered his name.  Although my pizza wasn't that great, I'd still come back. The people there were nice. The atmosphere was nice. And there was a wide variety of food and beer to choose from."
Elaine N.,"Elk Grove, CA",12,11,11,4.0,11/28/2014,"Just stopped in on a Friday evening,  very busy but no worries we found a place in the bar area  our server is awesome, she came over right away and took our drink orders.  I ordered the seasonal grand cru,  it is delicious.  Now just waiting on our pizza.."
Nicolas T.,"Sacramento, CA",71,16,4,5.0,10/13/2013,"What I can say, BJ's is one of the best places around. They have polite and friendly staff and the food is excellent! I would recommend any pizza they have. Also, their world famous pazzokies!  The only downside would be the wait to get in but that only shows how good this place really is!"
LuAnn S.,"Sacramento, CA",29,30,1,2.0,6/4/2016,"I met friends for lunch at noon today. I ordered the salmon quinoa bowl and the salmon was a very good sized piece. It was not very tasty but cooked nicely. Well, when I got the bill... It said salmon dinner... I asked why and the waiter said I ordered the bowl and it is the same price. I ended up arguing with him because he told me if I don't specifically say LUNCH bowl, then you automatically get the more expensive dinner size. What?  He told me I didn't say anything so therefore that's what I got. I ordered at a little after 12 noon and he couldn't ask if I wanted the lunch size or the dinner size? And then he says, ""Well you did pretty good and ate it all.""  By then I was obviously annoyed with this and he said he would fix the bill to the lunch-size price. I suggest that if there is a choice, then the waiter should ask the diner what size they want... He said he only does that on weekdays. That's just ridiculous. Humph. If he thought he'd make the restaurant and himself a little extra money by doing that, he was wrong."
Isaac R.,"Elk Grove, CA",1,10,,2.0,2/11/2015,I don't really write reviews until I had enough. This has been going on more than a few visits and the service has been horrible. I think they need to retrain or re hire new people the hostess is the best service you will get from that place. I've had a waitress who barley knew what she was doing messed up my order and mind you I've been waiting for 40 minutes to be seated then after getting our order and drinks she never check up on us if we needed anything else while a empty glass of beer been sitting on the corner of the table for at least a half hour then after our food gets to our table it was not what I ordered so they took it back I let my friends eat while I scraps of the plate from my appetizer I was so hungry it has been 1 1/2 in the restaurant since I've been waiting to sit and since they messed up my order the waitress apologizes and wait will be out soon and I still haven't got my food by the time my friends have finished eating my food finally come after waiting about an hour of my food I was so angry I took a few bites had my food Togo then complained to the manager she was very understanding and took of my beer and food. Thinking that was just that day I had a bad service I went back again and again had bad service it was like I never left here from last time and was dealing with the same problem like last time. After bring my mom to that restaurant for the last time the hostess was very kind seated us then came this male server who look like a bus boy and look like he had no interest of helping us. Customer service was terrible my mother was asking him if he knew if a certain item was spicy she can't have spicy cause of health reasons he doesn't know and I asked him if we order it and she doesn't like it can you just take it back and remove it from our bill he says if you don't think your going to eat it then don't order it. I was almost arguing with the guy about just doing it then my mom said never mind she will a salad I said I'll just have water after he left I said to my mom I think we should leave she agreed. We left and I will never set foot in that restaurant location ever again. If you want terrible service and your only going for the food then this place is good for you.
Duong N.,"Sacramento, CA",37,18,8,3.0,10/7/2013,"Came out here for a Friday night to get a few drinks and ""snacks..."" Place is usually packed Friday and Saturday nights.  Its been a while since I have been to this particular BJ on a Friday and the wait was 40 minutes...When I finally got a table I noticed there were about 4 tables in the area I sat were empty, after 15 minutes later they sat down another party.  I walked outside to make a phone call and noticed there were still a lot of people waiting to be seated.  They could have easily sat down a few more tables... I usually go here and get the Jambalaya.  Other then that I dont usually go here nor will it be a place I would normally hang out at."
Paulo A.,"San Carlos, CA",0,3,,3.0,1/25/2016,"After a long day of car shopping, I stopped in with my sister, her husband and a newborn for a late lunch. Our server was Justine (spelling). The food was good and the service was awesome, but for one minor detail. Justine brought out drink refills without being asked and checked on us throughout our visit. Her service was great. I am giving a 4 star rating instead of a five star, for one simple reason. I'm not sure if this was a server issue or a corporate mandate. Our check was dropped at the table before we were finished with our meals. This BUGS the crap out of me, don't rush me. I'll ask for the check when I'm ready."
Alicia M.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,1,,2.0,12/27/2015,"Dropped my daughter off first since we had a party of 13 to place my name and check how long the wait time. I sat down in the waiting area asked my daughter how long the wait was and she didn't tell her. I waited a little longer and then asked the gentlemen in the front how long is our wait with a bad attitude he replied back ""you've only waited 9 minutes"" I said I know I just wanted to see how long was out wait time. We should have courteous and friendly people to greet and meet the clients coming in"
Lionel D.,"Sacramento, CA",0,11,,1.0,7/8/2012,"I rarely give bad grades on Yelp and I usually always have a good experience at most BJ's Restaurants...but this one in Elk Grove truly sucked. The server was the biggest factor, along with the food we had.  We were seated quickly....but we waited 15-20 minutes for our server to even greet us.  Took our orders, and we also ordered a bread appetizer.  We waited about 45-50 minutes.  We finally got our pizza after we asked our server on its status.  We never did get the bread appetizer....the server then said 'Oh, I can get to you guys in less than 5 minutes if you want!""....... ......yeah, we said No politely since we already had out main entrees.  The pizza was OK. We get the bill.  We split it two ways.  My friend called me the next day saying that he checked his bank account and got charged the whole bill......and I still got charged my half.  This infuriated us even more.   Normally I will never give a bad grade based on one person that works there, but I had to leave this type of review for this situation... GO to any other BJ's Restaurants...they are great. JUST DONT GO TO THIS ONE!"
Steven E.,"Elk Grove, CA",1,10,,1.0,12/20/2015,"Just had jumbalaya for lunch, so damn hot I did not finish it.  Did u dump the entire box of cayenne pepper into it? Should be some heat, but not tongue destroying, and I like spicy food, never had it this kit in New Orleans even."
