Tommy S.,"Sacramento, CA",431,19,17,3.0,9/17/2014,Food is great as always but tonight as for the service it took way too long for the waitress to acknowledge us... I know it's busy but at least give us some water or a hello???
Charlotte J.,"Sacramento, CA",0,6,12,3.0,12/11/2014,"I love their burgers.  Their buffalo wings are good, too. Their service is sometimes slow, but it's worth the wait. I've been there about six or seven times. Good stuff."
Kristen C.,"Sacramento, CA",13,39,,1.0,3/11/2014,"This is, by far, the worst BJ's at which I've eaten. I really enjoy this chains' food and beer, but this specific restaurant severely lacks in customer service. Recently, my boyfriend and I decided to order some takeout from this BJ's after finishing up some shopping in Elk Grove. Initially, we attempted to call for Curbside Takeout. We called, got transferred, then waited on hold for over three minutes before we got fed up and hung up. For whatever reason, we still thought it's be a good idea to head down there and order food in person. The host directed us over to the Curbside Takeout counter. No one was there. I think it finally took ten minutes for someone to realize that we had been waiting. Granted, the place looked pretty packed/busy for a non-weekend night, but I saw at least a half dozen staff members walk past us. No one helped us and no one bothered to answer the phones that rang on and off either. Finally, someone darted out of the kitchen and took our order. This guy obviously seemed rushed and frazzled, but seemed to get all the details entered in correctly and took our payment. We ordered two specialty salads and a fried appetizer. He told us the order would take about 15-20 minutes. Great! Especially we needed to be back in South Sacramento for another commitment in a little over an hour. Fifteen, twenty, thirty, thirty-five minutes passed. Multiple people came and went with their food orders. Multiple servers were standing around the main station at the entrance of the restaurant. An off-duty employee came in, picked up her food, then took some time to go back behind the counter and talk to those that were working. Still no sight of our food. Finally, my boyfriend, who rarely gets mad, stood and waited up at the pick-up counter for five minutes before someone addressed him. This guy, who replaced the one who took our order, heard my boyfriend's complaints, which centered around the total miscommunication with the time frame for our order and our expectations not being met by this experience. (If we knew it was going to take 30-45 minutes we just wouldn't have ordered food and would have gone elsewhere.) This guy was nice and did everything he should have done - checking on the order in the computer and the kitchen, updating us, offering us drinks, then finally getting the manager after our order still wasn't produced. We both felt genuinely bad for this guy since this mess was totally not his fault and we thought he did a decent job with the situation he was given. (Can't remember his name, unfortunately.) The salads came out and the appetizer came out ten minutes later. At that point, we were explaining things to the manager who offered to return the food, which didn't make any sense because we had been waiting for forty five minutes at that point and we had already paid. In the end, we unhappily took our food and raced home with barely any time to eat before our commitment that night. As we checked on the food in the car, we discovered that the chicken in my salad was cold and both salads looked horribly underwhelming and small. For all we know, the salads were made in five or ten minutes then, for whatever reason, the fried appetizer somehow took thirty minutes to drop in the fryer. The appetizers were also not crispy and seemed lacking in ingredients. Absolutely ridiculous. When we ate the food at home, it was alright. I just couldn't enjoy it because of the experience we just had. We will not be visiting this BJ's again."
Karen C.,"Elk Grove, CA",9,16,9,5.0,11/29/2014,"I am never disappointed here! Everything I've had from the beer and wine to the appetizers to the main entrees has been delicious! The pizzas are amazing. It's my favorite place to go for happy hour, too where my friends and I will share several appetizers. Our favorites are the flatbread pizzas, the chicken lettuce wraps, and the tomato/mozzarella salad. Even my very picky mom loved the blackened salmon dinner. The only downfall is that you usually have to wait for a table because it is crowded no matter the time or day-but it's worth the wait!"
Oli R.,"Elk Grove, CA",148,59,5,4.0,5/12/2014,"Gotta love BJs... No seriously I've been going here since they first opened in Elk Grove. Really no complaints but I will say the hostess could be a little more friendly. Happy Hour prices are ok, but definitely better options in Elk Grove for that. I'll continue to go here just because well it's BJs.."
Kristie F.,"Sacramento, CA",349,211,359,4.0,1/5/2013,"A good quote I once heard goes like this: ""You don't have regrets, because at one time, you wanted it."" This quote is applicable to when me and my friend were craving a mid-day dessert and we decided to get the trio of pizookies. ZOMG. At the end of the dining event, we were both food coma-ing... For the trio of pizookies, you can choose 3 of ANY of their pizookie flavors! Winning! Since we were having trouble picking which flavor anyways.  We ended up getting Cookies & Cream, Red Velvet, and Raspberry White Chocolate.  Oreo was definitely my favorite! Service was excellent and I love the atmosphere of the place -- nice and chill for a date, hangout, whatevers!"
Ireana P.,"Elk Grove, CA",472,1,44,5.0,11/22/2014,"Great host, great food and nice environment. Great for a party of any age. Game night is the best!!!"
Tina D.,"Sacramento, CA",308,58,19,4.0,7/14/2014,"BJ's night happy hour sun-thurs from 10-close. Since i do work in the industry, i am able to make it here for happy hour after i get off work. They have half-off pizzas, and appetizers and also drinks as well. The service here is consistent, especially when dining in the bar area. We always get the same waitress  and she is so nice and helpful."
Mia Q.,"Sacramento, CA",0,26,4,4.0,11/12/2014,"I tried the pumpkin pizookie for the first time. Excellent! I occasionally get the Baked Beignet, but passed this time because of the last TWO TIMES I ordered it here. Whoever is cutting the fresh strawberries is using the same knife as the onions. (Or the strawberries are being stored too near the onions) Horrible to be eating a sweet dessert and taste onions."
Jason E.,"Chino, CA",46,27,3,3.0,8/4/2014,"If you know BJ's restaurants, this location has all the same food, flavors, that you would expect. For some reason this location (Laguna) has some issues.  Service is fine, although inconsistent and even slow at times, but friendly. The food has come out at all sorts of temperatures ranging from blistering to cool. We especially enjoy their Caesar salad but only when it's dressed, and sadly, most of them are not (naked salad?) so we ask for additional dressing before they bring it out.  These are superficial complaints and the food is usually pretty good - whenever something is not right they politely fix it right away. It's a fine spot for lunch, dinner, or watching a game."
Karina M.,"Sacramento, CA",11,52,70,4.0,8/26/2014,I came here on a Saturday night with some friends for drinks only. The waitress was very attentive even though she was taking care of the whole bar area. She promptly brought us all water and was patient while we were deciding on our drinks. Their beer and drink selections are great and the price is just as good. $5 for a pint glass of their Berry Burst Cider. You just can't beat it. I would most certainly come back because their happy hour menu looks even more exciting!
Beth M.,"Sacramento, CA",17,17,7,5.0,4/25/2014,This is now our favorite place to go. Alot of options and they have really bounced back. Very pleased!! Great customer service as well
D L.,"Sacramento, CA",303,155,271,3.0,3/29/2010,"The food is here is good but I hate going here because it's always crazy busy. My god you would think people in the land of Elk could find another watering hole to eat at.  When ever I do eat here I order pizza or one of their salads, I get too over stimulated by their menu and end up ordering the same crap to eat every time. I fee like I'm taking a scan tron test and if I don't choose something to eat, I'll fail or run out of time.  I think it's a Chinese thing fear of getting a B on a test hahah. If this place wasn't so busy I would give it higher stars. But unfortunately because of it's full capacity and my strange abnormal fear of anything higher than what the maximum fire capacity would allow. I will not be eating here very often."
Luis B.,"Lodi, CA",1,17,2,1.0,10/6/2015,"Girl at the front made me look bad, even stupid in front of my wife. I asked for a table for 12 and she told me to have a seat. 25 mins go by and my wife storms in pissed, she apparently didn't see me sitting in front of her and never said our table was ready. Horrible"
Seher K.,"Sacramento, CA",2,21,,2.0,7/27/2015,"Came here for a girls dinner with friends. They don't allow same day reservations, which makes no sense so I ended up arriving around 40 minutes before we were going to meet up to ensure we got a table On time.  Unfortunately, we still ended up waiting for almost an hour and a half even though they told me wait time would only be half an hour when I checked in. Needless to say, we were all starving by the time we got seated.  We ordered right away as we had chosen our meals during the wait but it took them FOREVER to bring the food out.  I actually had to follow up and ask what the status on our food was. I know they get busy, but the wait time for food was a bit much. Food quality wise I was pretty disappointed. No one in my party really loved their meal.  Everything was just ""meh"".  I would recommend that you try out one of the many other great restaurants in Sacramento before coming to BJ's."
Chau L.,"Palo Alto, CA",4,73,101,3.0,5/14/2012,"Nice atmosphere to hang with friends and family. The service is great. Ordered some appetizers, some fried tortilla with avocados rolls, bruchettas, tuna sashimi with chips. They were okay. Tried the deep dish pizzas, pretty tasty. The dough is light and fluffy. Gourmet pizza quality.  The giant potato is really giant, beware!  The food came quick and hot."
A R.,"Sacramento, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/8/2015,"Come almost every Sunday for football....   This Sunday male bar tender NOT up to par.  Manager, Brandon, not taking care of people after asking twice.   Third time I had an attitude and I got what I wanted.  Not a way to watch football and have a watered down drink....   Bring Vanessa and the horns back!!!!!!"
Qadir O.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,7,,5.0,11/5/2014,"Always visit BJ's and never had a bad day, which mean this is a good place to dine. Good food and good service. Random visits and we are seated in minutes."
Kevin T.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",36,10,,2.0,12/1/2013,This place is aptly named BJs-- as it truly sucks. We waited at least forty minutes for our debit/credit cards to return for us to leave a tip. Here's a tip: hurry up with your service because we literally spent 9/10ths of our time waiting for the lousy service to get things done. I will not be returning here and I DO NOT recommend coming here.
Doug G.,"Elk Grove, CA",6,26,29,3.0,7/16/2015,I like this place. Always a good vide inside. Today the food was mediocre and the service about the same.
