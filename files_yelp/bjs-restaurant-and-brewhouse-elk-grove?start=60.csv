K. M.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,9,,3.0,9/13/2017,"I'm giving BJ's in Elk Grove 3 stars because if you go and dine in; the food is great per usual, Bj's food is always pretty good anywhere you go. However, To-Go is a nightmare at this location! Like I seriously give up. The last 4 times of ordering takeout has been a complete mess. Orders took forever and never available at time I am told. Food is wrong and has to be sent back. Sides are wrong. One time I was in car side to go waited for 45 minutes while the guy went back and forth to keep fixing the order and I finally went in and was like look what is going on. Give me my money back or give me my order correctly and fast. The whole reason people order to-go at restaurants is because they don't have time to sit and eat in! So frustrating. Get it together guys."
Riley A.,"Sloughhouse, CA",0,2,,5.0,7/31/2017,Came in this evening with my mom and sister.  Out waitresses Sarah and Stacey were amazing.  Made some awesome recommendations for our appetizers and dinner plates.  Definitely made our visit a pleasant one.  Will be returning very soon!
David B.,"Acampo, CA",0,3,,1.0,12/14/2017,"Went for dinner last night. Ordered a salad and on the second bite there was a piece of a broken plate in my mouth about the size of a nickle! Called the waitress over and she said she would tell the manager. He never came to my table. She took the salad and never asked if I wanted it replaced. I asked to fill out a customer incident form and 25 minutes later they were still ""printing it out."" Finally gave up and went to pay and the manager came out, handed me the form and said not one word to me. Not even an insincere apology. Handed him the form and left. They comped my meal but I had to pay for my girlfriends. Needless to say this place and the management suck. BTW I have never written a review like this and I have done a few."
Valerie H.,"Ajijic, Mexico",218,19,7,1.0,9/21/2017,FYI your points program sucks. I'm a single woman and rarely buy $25 of food per visit. Would never recommend.
Caleb H.,"Elk Grove, CA",206,67,230,5.0,11/3/2016,"I really cannot say enough good things about BJ's. My family and I have enjoyed their menu and atmosphere dozens of times. BJ's is a great place for a small outing, or for a major festive party. Their menu is fantastic, their root beer is exceptional, and their pizza is pretty much to die for. I love all the regular deep dish options, with the Mediterranean, the spicy pig, the BJ's favorite, in the great White being my favorites. If you like sports, they have several TVs around the restaurant for you to keep up with the latest sports news. BJ's is great for holiday evenings and birthday parties, or a late night chill session with the bros. All in all, I love this place. The waiters and waitresses have always made me feel like I am their most important guest.  The only possible downside is that on busy busy nights, the waiting time can be up to an hour."
Jennifer L.,"Elk Grove, CA",174,37,26,5.0,11/20/2016,"Their half BBQ chicken and half bjs favorite pizza is BOMB!!! Danielle Phillips is by far my favorite server. She is super attentive and makes sure that you are taken care of and as for Brandon the manager as well.  Me and my coworkers always come here to grab a quick bite after a long shift before going home. This is probably our favorite spot especially since it is right down the street from work. It can get a little busy but as a server, I understand that not everyone is perfect and mistakes can be made but just be patient.  Portion wise, some items come in large amounts so be prepared to share or take home. I never finish my food so doggy bag it is! I usually get the traditional wings, maybe a pasta, a drink and have plenty of leftovers for the next day or maybe w midnight snack.  BTW, their very berry cider is AMAZINGGGG!!"
Allison L.,"Sacramento, CA",301,282,2340,4.0,2/22/2016,"I eat at BJ's about once every three years and only because other people want to. It's not that I have anything against them, it's just a very crowded, calorie-heavy, and somewhat expensive restaurant. It does offer a wide variety of food, however, so it's good for groups.  I came here on a Saturday night around 6:30 with my boyfriend, his two nephews, his sister, and her husband. When we arrived there was already a crowd of people. There is a parking lot but it was pretty full. The hostess informed me it would be a 45-50 minute wait. I gave her my phone number and she said they'd text me when our table was ready. Luckily it wasn't too cold outside so we sat outside and waited. It ended up being an hour before we were seated. This is pretty normal for BJ's.  We got a corner booth table. Our hostess was pretty friendly and brought out our waters quickly (though the refills later on were slow).  Some of the dishes I tried: Avocado egg rolls: very tasty, but a little too much avocado. You can't eat that many of these.  Potato skins: nice and crispy on the bottom but still soft enough. Lots of bacon!  Chicken Alfredo: kinda strange that it comes with broccoli mixed in, but I guess that makes you feel *healthier.* Generous portion.  Chicken club flatbread: in the appetizer section, but large enough for an entree. Chicken, bacon, tomatoes, aioli, and avocados on a crispy flat bread. A nice change from the thicker, saucey pizzas.  Chocolate chip pizookie: perfectly warm and melty with nice cold ice cream on top! Everything was tasty and the temperature of the food was hot, which was good. The manager actually knew my boyfriend's brother in law, and he went out of his way to make sure we all had a great dining experience.  This is the kinda place where you end up eating and talking for about 2 hours, which is probably why it's always so busy and has a wait time.  Overall, a positive experience. I don't frequent here too often but I would recommend if you have a group of friends or were getting together for a birthday dinner.  Note: they have a bar with lots of TVs playing sports."
Emily W.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,17,1,5.0,9/26/2017,"Daniella was so amazing! She was super sweet and very helpful. Food came out great, drinks were awesome and tonight for our going away bash was great!"
Bobbi P.,"Sacramento, CA",12,28,,5.0,6/23/2017,"The hublove and I went out for date night and honestly we had the best service we have had in a long time.  Our server was amazing and on it! We have been going to BJ's for a long time and this is the first time we have ever had a server actually ""suggestive sell"" to us...I was impressed! We actually really liked what she suggested, the jambalaya was off the hook! Yes you have to try it.  Also, the bartender was in it...give them a raise! Their pours were awesome, I mean come on no head on the beer...sweet!  So, hands down best experience in a long time! Great Job BJ's!"
Andy C.,"Riverside, CA",209,6,,1.0,12/3/2017,Been waiting for takeout on hold for the last 15 minutes for the SECOND time. It's ridiculous how I haven't been able to reach anyone for thirty minutes.
Felisha L.,"Elk Grove, CA",100,119,510,4.0,4/26/2016,"As a regular here, there are many great things to say about BJs!  The atmosphere is inviting and fun.  Also, it is a very family friendly restaurant which is a big plus for me.   With a full bar, there are numerous choices of drinks along with many kinds of beer on tap.  Cocktail, shot, mix drink and beer drinkers will all be satisfied.   The food selection is wide range from different types of appetizers, salads, entrees, burgers, etc.  I usually come here for the drinks and appetizers.  Their wings is a must try!  This is our regular order and at times we order 2 or more orders.  I also enjoy their flatbread pizzas which also on point with the crispy crust.  Another favorite of mines is the pan fried brussel sprouts and the poke salad.  Lets not forget about their dessert selections!  I love their famous pizookie!  Who wouldn't love to eat a fresh baked cookie topped with a scoop of delicious ice cream."
Leah S.,"Sacramento, CA",2,31,,1.0,5/24/2017,"I order lunch from restaurants to take to clients on a  daily basis; this has been the worst experience I have had with a takeout order.  The office where I was doing lunch with had been placed on hold for 10 minutes, and then hung up on, trying to place the order. I called the curbside number to let them I know I was there to pick up the order at 11:30. At 11:55 (I was supposed to be at the lunch at 12:00), I went inside to see what the hold up was, and my order was sitting there, and they had no idea. I called the manager on duty once I was in the car, and was placed on hold for another 15 minutes, but by that time, I had arrived at the office and did not have time to stay on hold any longer. Actions speak louder than words, and their actions tell me that customer satisfaction is not a priority. My actions will be to no longer use this restaurant."
Kristin C.,"Cottonwood, CA",0,3,,5.0,10/14/2017,We just moved to Elk Grove a year ago & we have been to Bj's about 4x since we moved here & every time the food is delicious & the staff is amazing. Tonight we came when they were super packed.. I believe it was homecoming & our waitress Candace was wonderful! Very friendly & fast service for how packed they were! Keep it up Bj's!
Nou M.,"Sacramento, CA",0,1,,2.0,7/1/2017,"This was my first time here at BJs. Came here with two other people, so it didn't take too long to be seated. However, the two people up front were rude and the person who seated us didn't have good customer service at all. We sat down and the table was so dirty! Ice cream bits, water, and black pepper crumbs were all over the table top, so obviously the seater didn't bother to wipe it/ask a busser to wipe before seating us. We had to ask our waiter (Stacey?) to get someone to wipe the table. After we sat down, we found napkins lying around on our seats too. Very bad impression.  I ordered the Ahi Salad, and the other two ordered the Bison burger and the shrimp and asparagus penne. Wait time was reasonable for a Saturday night, I guess. Both dishes except the Penne was good. The shrimp and asparagus penne tasted pretty average."
Kavita S.,"San Jose, CA",135,106,22,4.0,9/6/2016,"I know reviews for this place can be all the over the place but I'd have to say my experiences have been good and if for some reason they aren't then bjs always makes sure we are satisfied. We usually stick to our usual a like a picture of beer, either their blonde or something similar, and a great white pizza. But we've switched it up and gotten other things and they've always tasted good."
Jovelyn C.,"Elk Grove, CA",33,5,11,4.0,6/28/2017,"Have been to Bj's plenty of times and usually order the same thing, Jambalaya. Decided to order the Soba noodles with chicken with no spice. It was pretty good, but still had a spicy aftertaste. My pregnant picky cousin had the Parmesan crusted chicken with green beans. She ate it, so I think it was good enough lol.  Ended the dinner with the signature pizookies. I ordered a regular sized white macadamia, but was given a mini size and the cookie was already cold. Our waiter packed my bigger size pizzokie to take home. He was very attentive.  My husband had the Bj's app and is a Bj's member, so he had a coupon. With coupons and the app special we spent $52 for 2 adult, 2 kids and 4 pizzokies. I have to admit Bjs is not our go to place for me to eat like it was when we first discovered the restaurant. It may be a combination of menu choices and high prices. Nevertheless, if you want hearty and filling food, this is the spot. Just be prepared to wait for a table, they are always busy."
Shika P.,"Sacramento, CA",31,20,10,3.0,4/5/2017,"Love there food most of the time but today the food was terrible. First my mom received uncooked salmon, secondly my dad and my grandma's chicken was overcooked, hard and not edible and third they forgot to put sauce on our pizza! But the waitress was very kind and considerate so we gave her a nice tip."
Troy T.,"Sacramento, CA",226,141,265,4.0,2/1/2016,"Great American place to go to. Yes, it has the same vibe as any other American restaurants, but they are very consistent in their food and service.  I've been here a handful of times, and the servers were all friendly, for sure there are hiccups here and there, but nothing too outstanding to get a bad rating."
Norma A.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/10/2017,"The food is delish, specially there pizza yet there to go orders take a long time. I place my orde on line set a time for pick up, arrived 5 min before and guess what 35+min I am still waiting. The excuse they gave me is the online order does not communicate with there system . Wth???? Come on Chili's has it together and you guys are a little more expensive than them. Smh"
Cecilia M.,"Sacramento, CA",43,6,12,2.0,3/4/2017,Need more employees. .the ones that are working have too many people to attend to that they are giving bad customer service...skimpy desserts too I'm pretty sad
