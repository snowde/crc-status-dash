Nancy T.,"Sacramento, CA",122,47,82,4.0,2/26/2012,"Service is great!! Love their mini appetizers! I'm the type that likes to try a little bit of everything, so it's a great option for me & my friends who come with me!  As for their main entrees, I'm at a 50/50... Sometimes the chicken is over cooked or it's just not something over the top that is worth paying over $15 for. So I usually skip on the entree. Oh yeah the best beginning is the best !! I usually sub out the mozzarella sticks for more of the egg rolls :) But dessert is a must!!  thee ice cream with the cookie on the bottom, mmmmm..... My mouth is watering just thinking about it!"
A L.,"Sacramento, CA",267,336,740,3.0,3/30/2012,I've gone a few times and the food ranges from okay to good. I like their buffalo wings A LOT. The parmesan chicken is also another dish that I get here quite often. Today I went with the balsamic chicken. MEH....I wish I had gone for meatloaf or something else with FLAVOR. Side salad was good though.
Kyle G.,"Los Angeles, CA",119,165,30,3.0,6/18/2012,"I came here with my mom after it became apparent that Paesano's is *the* place to be on Tuesdays at 5. I know it's really important to be seen at a happenin' spot in Elk Grove and all, but we were really hungry, so we opted to dine elsewhere. And thus BJ's. The service here wasn't really ""bad,"" it just wasn't really great. At first, our waiter was really energetic and stuff about changing our dishes (eliminating the cheese from the bruschetta and pasta, leaving the bell peppers out of my mom's fish dish. She doesn't like bell peppers), which got us kinda excited to have our food just the way we wanted it. I don't know if he forgot or just didn't care or what. The pasta dish indeed had no cheese (he pointed it out very enthusiastically), but there was cheese in the bruschetta and bell peppers with the fish. We didn't point it out, because he seemed so happy with himself. Actually we didn't point it out because we're both the type of people who are like ""hum dee dum should we say something??? How can we fix this without making a fuss????"" So ultimately my mom picked out the bell peppers and I didn't eat bruschetta. Just to be complainy, I'll add that many of the pine nuts in my dish were burnt. Also, I had to add like 4 cups of salt for it to have any detectable flavor (I might be exaggerating), but I guess that's just personal preference... Overall, the food was decent, it was served quickly... And thankfully only 2/3 of what we ordered... wasn't what we ordered. The place is clean, though, and stuff like this doesn't always happen, so I won't be too harsh with the rating. BJ's gets points as a restaurant because some of its menu items can be veganized. I also like their handcrafted beers. I'd go back when I'm in town, too. That's partly because my options are limited, though (and BJ's is open pretty late). Just wish I could've had some bruschetta..."
Arvin C.,"Sacramento, CA",143,121,467,3.0,1/19/2012,"I'm not really a big fan of this place, but the pizza here is good. Great white, BBQ chicken, and bacon cheeseburger are my favorites. The beer here is good, especially jeremiah red. The pastas and other dishes are a no for me. It's just like canned food heated up on your plate. Prices are decent and many selections are offered. I love coming here for my friends birthdays! Why? You can buy them a ""gorilla fart"" shot, which will probably kill him/her, if not !@$%^# up! It's mixed with a shot of 151 and a shot of wild turkey. Go figure. So may sure if you buy a shot for your friend, get that :)"
Johnny L.,"Sacramento, CA",149,13,,3.0,6/29/2015,the food here is good but I prefer coming here just to hang out at the bar areas.  most of the time im here is when friends throw their birthday dinners here. come prepared because there is always a long wait time for big groups.
Cari Y.,"Berkeley, CA",76,46,29,5.0,6/1/2014,"Love the burgers, sandwiches and pizza here! Also a great atmosphere for family and friends. Always a great place to come if I'm in town and want to catch up with people. Would definitely come here more than once and a great place to celebrate accomplishments."
George W.,"Vacaville, CA",126,101,55,4.0,9/17/2010,"BJs is a great place to go to for lunch and dinner. They have a lot of TVs around the restuarant and bar usually with the current games on. If you are looking for a nice quiet relaxing place to have dinner, This is not it. This is a noisy reastaurant with great food. They usually have about an average of 40 minute wait time during peak hours.  They have chicago style Pizzas deep dish style I usually get the great white which is a white sauce pizza with Chicken and it is delicious. Also, I reccomend the Sante Fe Spring Rolls for an appetizor. They do have call ahead seating which I strongly reccomend doing. They also offer curbside to go. Looking for a place to have a birthday dinner? They are more then happy to accomadate your large party."
Alison C.,"Elk Grove, CA",76,13,6,5.0,7/24/2014,"I have been going every Sunday morning and sometimes even most weekend day when my boyfriend's family comes around. We all enjoy the food and never have a hard time for something for everyone. We love the menu and wide variety of choices. All the non- Alcoholic and Alcoholic drinks are very good.  On Sunday morning brunch they are never too busy and always seem to have a seat for us. When we don't go on a Sunday and come on the next they ask were we have been? and if we were all okay? its our favorite Sunday brunch spot and its very inviting and great spot to see family and friends. Food is so yummy as well. I would recommend it to anyone big or small, and has a great family atmosphere."
Brian T.,"Elk Grove, CA",7,6,,2.0,6/22/2014,"Food is O.K., customer service not so much. Went in for Saturday brunch, not busy at all yet had to ask for silverware AFTER salads were dropped and told to enjoy! We're seated back to back with other tables yet the place was empty. A little elbow room is nice when available! Only second time here but not eager to return.  Like I said "" Food just O.K."""
Susan P.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",103,172,7,3.0,8/14/2012,"BJ's is my regular spot for late night happy hour or for birthday dinners. I prefer BJ's over TGIF any day.  The food is so much better!  The specials for late night happy hour are Half off mini pizzas $2 off appetizers and drinks If I'm here for happy hour I usually get the deep dish mini pizza (Sweet Pig or Great White), buffalo wings with extra celery or the Santa Fe Spring Rolls.  For dinner, I like the Cajun pasta, New Orleans Jambalaya, and Honey Crisp Chicken salad.  Oh, I can't forget the pizookie! YUMMMMMMMM! The cookie is nice and warm and it goes great with the vanilla ice cream on top! Definitely, my favorite spot for drinks and appetizers in Elk Grove."
Sandra P.,"Helendale, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/18/2014,Jury is still out about this place! Went to the restroom before dinner and almost did the splits on soap on the filthy floor. My one hope - because I am hungry- is that the kitchen is cleaner than the restroom.
Johnny A.,"Washington, DC",58,542,25,2.0,6/15/2012,"Mediocre, greasy food that puts TGIF to shame. While our waitress was friendly and knowledgable, overall service was slow and they seemed short staffed. There are plenty of better options in the area."
Jessica L.,"Sacramento, CA",129,70,197,3.0,3/5/2014,"Came here on Friday to catch up with my cousin since it's been awhile since I've had time to hang out with her. What better place than to catch up over a pizookie trio?? We came in around 7 and the wait time was about an hour so we decided to go to the bar for open seating. After 30 minutes of fighting for tables with other people in the open seating bar, we got a table. Our server was nice, but I felt he neglected us because we only ordered pizookies. We were never checked up on. Not once. He was there to take our order and to give is the check. He was mentioning to us that he never works Fridays and this was the first in a while so maybe that's why he lacked customer service that night.. Because it was busy and that he was just flustered. He even dropped plates by the table next to us. I can tell it was an off day for him. I'm not blaming him though, I understand he was having a rough night but I just think it would be nice to at least get checked up on once to have my water refilled."
Mario M.,"Elk Grove, CA",329,21,55,1.0,9/21/2011,Received a salad with not one but two hairs in it.  I brought it to the attention of the manager Adrian and he reimbersed us the salad without replacement ...no shit! That was very noble. I asked where the sous chef was in all this and he said he was off tonite. All that for a couple of bucks. Health dept will hear of this stupidity.
Margaret T.,"Sacramento, CA",131,97,37,2.0,1/28/2014,"This review is based on my last visit here. We were a big party but got seated right away but service was slow and sloppy. We came around 8:30pm on a Wednesday, the restaurant was not busy. After taking our order it took more than 30 mins for our salads to come out. We ordered appetizers too but those came about 15 min AFTER the salads which was a little backwards. After waiting another 30 min our food came out - COLD. the cheese on our pizzas had that waxy, been sitting there look and were not warm. The pans were even cool to the touch. Our food was the same way. We even asked  to reheat our pizzas and the waitress kinda stood there and then told another waitress ""They said they want them reheated because they think they're cold, here"" and shoved them off like it was our fault. After reheating and having to wait about 2 hours for our main courses to arrive we just boxed it up and went home.  They get 2 stars because I know they have given great service to us In the past. What a waste of money."
Eric P.,"Manteca, CA",6,91,28,3.0,5/16/2015,An ok experience! Was a little busy this Saturday we came. Food came out and they forgot my steak and potatoes. I ordered the horseradish mashed potatoes and only got regular and my steak was well done and I had ordered medium well.
Mrs C.,"Sacramento, CA",3,54,4,2.0,6/8/2014,"Patronized the restaurant on Saturday June 7, 2014 and found it to be very busy in the bar area. Service was very slow initially but improved. The steak was cooked as ordered but over seasoned with a heavy salt which overpowered the flavor of the meat. The cook has the grill time correct but is misguided in believing that a little seasoning is good so a lot of seasoning is even better. Don't order the ""Wedge"" salad as it is simply a slice of white head lettuce with a sprinkling of condiments lacking flavor or appeal. Overall, the meal was ok but that being combined with the slow service will cause us to not to visit again."
Joe K.,"Rocklin, CA",233,197,162,2.0,5/28/2012,"I've been to BJ's many times in the past at other locations and never had any issues with the food. The waiter, Joe was attentive, friendly, and always on point. I ordered the pork chops and after receiving it I wanted to send it back. The pork chops were so overcooked that I was having a tough time cutting into it with a steak knife.  The chops were also unflavored and just all-in-all bad, period. At least my raspberry iced tea was good. If I could rate the service, it would be at least 4 star and the food was 1 star. Oh well, it sucks but it is what it is. Maybe management will see this review and make sure unseasoned, overcooked, and burnt pork chops don't terrorize another unsuspecting patron."
John S.,"Elk Grove, CA",70,6,,1.0,6/7/2015,Does anyone know if this area is under new management or something. We have come here quite a few times and had a enjoyable time and food so when we had relatives visit we decided to go there. We were extremely disappointed. First off it took more than 10 minutes after being sat for somone to even acknowledge we were there. They said that it wasn't her table but will take our drink order. 5 minutes later our waitress showed up to take our drink order. We told her it was already taken. She took our food order. My son and I ordered burgers medium. My son wanted only lettuce and tomatoes on it. He also ordered a bowl of clam chowder and my self a ceasar salad as a starter. Took forever for our food to come. They brought his clam chowder out with the spoon submerged in the soup handle and all. They also completely forgotmy salad which I decided to forgo since our meal had showed. Our burgers were well done/burnt. They forgot my sons lettuce and put the tomatoes on the side. My wife got one of her usuals the brussel sprout salad. It was not at all the quality what she has had before. Lettuce not fresh and sprouts were small and few. So the quality of service and food has totally fallen.
Nyala A.,"Sacramento, CA",12,20,1,3.0,2/5/2014,"My roommate and I have a love-hate relationship with BJ's. Love the food, but service is a hit or miss. We tend to go late at night around 11pm, but on a few occasions I've went around 5-6pm. The service can be awful (especially with the waitresses), but we've had some awesome waiters as well. One waiter in particular who was hands-down the best waiter I've ever had is a tall black guy with braids. Don't recall his name ): Like I mentioned before, food is great. I've almost always loved my meal! I don't suggest ordering pazookie in a take out order. If you don't get there right away, if will get kind of hard. Other than their if-y service, I really love coming here with friends."
