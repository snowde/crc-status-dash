Judy T.,"Vallejo, CA",0,13,,1.0,7/7/2014,"If I could give them a zero I would. We were there this past Sunday after brunch was over. We sat at the bar, telling waiter we were in a hurry. Ordered drinks that were okay. He took order at the same time...but we watched 2other tables that arrived after us get their food 1st. We only ordered sandwiches...sat there for 20 minutes! Unacceptable. Paid for drinks and left. Not the 1st time we had bad service. We are an interracial couple, I would hate to think that mattered, but I can say they won't be getting are business anymore. Food isn't that good, service matters!"
Sabria M.,"Sacramento, CA",2,32,21,1.0,9/7/2010,"BJ's used to be my favorite restaurant in Elk Grove. That is no longer the case. Hubby and I went tonight and the service was absolutely horrendous!  After we were seated, it took nearly 15 minutes for our server to come introduce herself to us and ask what kind of drinks we wanted. It took a long time to get our drinks out (pepsi and water) and quite a while after that to take our orders.  Our food took insanely long to come out as well. When we got the food, the bread from my sandwich was soggy and my fries were cold and gross. By this time we were fed up and hubby had to talk to the manager. He came, looking extremely bored, and ""listed"" to our complaints, then just asked kind of drinks we had. Without an apology or an  ""I'll be right back"" he stormed off and sent the server back out with the soda. She basically slammed the drink on the table without saying a thing. When the check came (again, silent server), it was 50% off. We paid the exact amount and no more. Worst restaurant experience ever."
Jaylene W.,"Sacramento, CA",126,96,20,4.0,4/10/2012,"BJs is the regular spot for happy hour! My friends and I are always coming here for drinks and food.  Very chill atmosphere and the food is good. Since this is a brewery, they have a variety of house brewed beers and mixes to choose from.  One of my favorites is called a Jerry Burst which is a mixture of their Jeremiah Red and Berry Burst Cider.  Sweet, light, and fruity.  As for food, the best items to order during happy hour are their personal sized pizzas because it's 50% off.  The regulars that I order are the BBQ Chicken and the Great White pizza.  For appetizer, my all time favorite item is the Chicken lettuce wraps. It's a must try! Don't forget to try a pizookie! (you get one free on your birthday!) Not much to say about the regular menu items because nothing was extraordinary to me, but definitely come here for their appetizers, pizzas, and beers! Staff are always friendly and patient too!"
Jonathan S.,"Elk Grove, CA",2,4,,1.0,8/7/2014,Pissed poor management don't alow reservation over 6 over the phone so big group s have to come in and watch. Them miss seat people. And extend your wait time  by far the dumbest hostess in all of the bj chain.
Krystle L.,"San Jose, CA",27,140,63,4.0,3/23/2014,"We came here to meet up for dinner with some friends Friday night. It was extremely busy; typical. Our waitress was  Tiffany she was very sweet and friendly. My boyfriend and his friend were in a joking mood and kept making jokes and she kept joining in making us laugh. Great service! My boyfriend ordered the salmon and really enjoyed it, I even tasted some, not ever trying salmon before and it was delicious! On the other hand, I ordered the enlightened mango chicken salad which was not very good though, Very bland, like it was missing something. I guess I won't order that again. Overall it was a decent experience."
McQuinn T.,"Mason, OH",131,77,278,3.0,6/29/2012,"Good food great beer. Food menu is very diverse and large best best is a deep dish pizza. The pizzookie desserts here are excellent. But the best part of this place is its versed and diverse beers. With everything from microbrews , international beers and BJ own beers. Also the cocktails here are very good. Great place for a date night or lunch."
Joseph K.,"Sacramento, CA",3,14,89,3.0,4/8/2012,"Just like any other BJ's. Pizzas are good and there are alot of TV's with games playing which is nice if you watch sports and want to just hang out. Almost saw a fight break out near the bar, but management was there to get things under control.  Also, watch out for the red light camera at the nearest major intersection."
Krista P.,"Sacramento, CA",0,17,,2.0,9/6/2015,I'm not sure why this place is so popular. Always a long wait at dinner and the food is sub-par for what you pay for. I have stopped going for these reasons.
Mark S.,"Elk Grove, CA",149,36,,5.0,7/25/2014,A very lively atmosphere here. Gets quite busy around dinner time. Very friendly staff and great food! We've always had good experiences at this location.
Felicia P.,"Washington, DC",80,410,8,3.0,1/1/2012,"The food and drinks are always good here, but the management (at least the person we dealt with for Monday night football) has little customer service skills.  Or, better yet, she seemed to cater to particular guests while alienating several guests who were trying to patronize the bar for the football game.  Sometimes it doesn't feel good dining out in Elk Grove while Black (or Brown). My 3 stars are for the quality of their products, not the customer service."
J L.,"Sacramento, CA",10,87,4,3.0,8/1/2012,"After this location being open several years, and noticing the lines are usually out the door, we tried a visit at a 5pm on Tuesday.  We were seated immediately - but the restaurant filled up pretty quick. I admire the variety of menu choices yet it can be overwhelming.  We were satisfied with our meal yet I think both of us would agree the dessert was the best part.  We had an apple/berry crisp that had vanilla ice cream on top.   Just simply yummy.  Our server seemed to disappear, then change - that was the strange part of our experience.   Others have commented about poor service and I can see why that would appear to be so.  (don't these businesses know about Yelp?)"
Jan S.,"Elk Grove, CA",250,12,12,2.0,6/16/2015,"Do not ever get take out from this place. Ordered one night around 11:20 which is close to their closing time which I get is a little inconvenient but not that bad since it's only take out. Ordered the three mini pizookies, beignet, chicken Alfredo, and a side of wedge cut fries. When I called to order, the girl immediately seemed annoyed and asked for my number three times. When I got there she told me she didn't write my number down, which I thought was weird since she asked me to repeat it 3 times, and didn't get a chance to tell me that they were out of beignets. A little disappointed because at this point I wasn't able to substitute it for anything because it was 11:50 and the kitchen was closing and if she had written my number down I could've gotten something else. So the only thing they could give me was another pizookie, even though I've already ordered three. And they didn't give it to me for free which I had thought, they charged me. Then when I got home I saw that my chicken Alfredo was extremely dry with very little sauce and only a couple pieces of chicken and broccoli while the fries were barely cooked. So I called the next day to explain very calmly about my bad experience and how I understood that it was around closing time but still wanted good food. They sent me a $15 e-card which only made up for the pasta and we went back a few days later to use it and again had our order messed up when it was four hours before their closing time. Overall not a great experience and the staff not very friendly with just an exception of a couple."
Tram T.,"Elk Grove, CA",291,292,356,3.0,4/28/2010,"This is another convenient go-to place in Elk Grove if I don't feel like making my way out to downtown Sac for drinking and greasy food.   Their food is okay and suffices any hunger I might have for a late night dinner.   I do like it for their service and people watching opportunities from the bar (especially on a Friday or Saturday night).  There is usually not a long wait for the bar (you just have to 'hover'), but there is a wait for the tables."
Tom R.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/19/2015,I've been on this Elk Grove location probably at least 4 times in the past couple of years. Every single one of them I get bad service. Probably why I'm willing to drive all the way to the Arden location to get better service. My most recent one was with my family a couple of days ago July 14. My wife and I were at the bar and ordered drinks while waiting for our table. We got our drinks fine and after 10 minutes we got called for our table. Took my family to the table and my wife was trying to pay our drinks. It took the bar 15 minutes just to settle the tab. Then we ordered our food. Took another 35 minutes to get the food out. I ordered a lunch menu of lemon chicken with rice and said it's going to be dinner portion with a lot of rice and chicken. That was not the case. It was lunch portion at a dinner price. I argued that the serving was very thin and the brussel sprout were under cooked and under seasoned. Our server Kayla (who is awesome by the way) agreed with me and tried to correct the situation by asking the manager what can be done. The manager did not want to do anything or at least come talk to me. Therefore I will give this restaurant 1 star. I don't think I will come back at this location (even though I live 5 mins away) till they get their act together.
Oscar S.,"Sacramento, CA",23,12,,3.0,1/16/2014,The food here is pretty good. This place has my favorite Caesar salad. I don't like the wait times for a table but I suppose that's what happens at popular eats. There menu is pretty vast and I like that. I don't really like coke so I'm very happy they serve Pepsi. Never had a problem with the help.
Donna R.,"Elk Grove, CA",3,22,2,1.0,8/23/2013,"My third visit here, no more I am finished.  All three times slow service, cold food.  After boxing  2 of our dinners when brought after 4 others at our table were finished with their dinners.  We ordered the cookie 45 minutes later it came.  So sorry to slow for me.  Goodby...   3 hours I will spend somewhere else next time not here!"
Heidi M.,"Sacramento, CA",0,112,44,3.0,7/15/2012,"I went here tonight and had a pizza that was really good, half combination, half BBQ chicken. My husband ate the combo half. I had the BBQ chicken half. I really liked mine. I didn't think I would either because the pizza looked thick, like it would be soggy or too doughy. To my surprise, the pizza was light and fluffy. The BBQ sauce was sweet and the chicken, tender white meat chunks. Yummy!! Also tried the Pizooki dessert. Oh My God!! It was delicious and dangerously addictive.  I had been here before, and had a so-so sandwich, but I think the pizza was much better.  I would have given our dining experience four stars, but the service needs work. Slow, mistakes made on our order, appetizer brought out at same time as pizza, etc. I still recommend it, though."
Paahh L.,"Sacramento, CA",0,32,22,5.0,5/6/2014,"Great place to hang out, eat, & order drinks! Love their pazookie! I always order the same thing when I go, the fresh Atlantic salmon. Soooo good! If I can afford it i would go every Friday!"
Marlena W.,"Roseville, CA",0,4,,4.0,8/23/2014,"Ordered a deep dish pizza and Fettuccine Alfredo. They were both really good. The only thing that sucks is the wait, but that's kind of expected when you go out to eat. Servers are always friendly. Not a big waiting area, so you may have to wait outside. Overall, I've had a great experience coming to this restaurant"
Mia C.,"Orangevale, CA",41,858,533,4.0,2/27/2014,Been to this location of BJs with friends. We shared couple of pizzas and had beers and mojitos. Great place to hangout with friends!!
