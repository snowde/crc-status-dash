Wesley L.,"Stockton, CA",5,76,38,5.0,6/2/2014,"The food at BJ's is always pretty good. This one is located nicely, right off of Hwy 99. But, the main reason I'm writing this is that we had the best service you could want with Alyssa the other night. She took great care of our group and did so with an awesome personality. I truly enjoyed our interaction with Alyssa and would recommend that you request her table when you go to this BJ's!"
Anthony W.,"Sacramento, CA",407,409,109,4.0,10/1/2009,"Sure, it's a chain, and it's casual dining, but my family still had a good time there, and that's what it's all about right? The service was very good, our waitress was cute and attentive. The pizza came out fast (15-20 min) and she served us the first slices. What really nailed the 4 stars was the free kids milk. Everyone can enjoy a little bit of chain once in a while."
Rachel M.,"Sacramento, CA",375,450,411,4.0,3/23/2010,"I don't know why everyone has a love or hate relationship with BJ's.  Whenever I go, I love it. One of my favorite appetizers to get is the chips and salsa.  I am a chips and salsa fiend and will pretty much jump on them whenever they're available.  The chips are red, white, and blue and the salsa that is served with them is delicious.  Thick and red, not too spicy or too mild.  I almost always order a mini pizza when I come here.  Usually I go with cheese and tomato.  Plain, I know.  But I like to be traditional with my pizza choices.  The pizza is just enough for one person and the cheese and sauce on top is great.  I've had better deep dish pizza, but this one is pretty delicious anyways.  Of course I order my favorite drink, lemonade, to wash it down with.  But in this case it was strawberry lemonade!  This is a great place to come to with a big group of friends.  It's very lively and entertaining."
Jin L.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,11,18,4.0,8/13/2014,"Went there quiet of few times and think of writing a review for this place. Everytime when I have been there the place is crowded. Food there I will say is pretty good, my family, they all like it. It was a clean place."
Alysa R.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,17,1,4.0,5/23/2014,"The food is great,  the service is good.. but a little slow.. but they are always busy, the wait is usually 35-45 min. Definitely a good restaurant to try."
Cammy C.,"Sacramento, CA",424,229,304,4.0,10/17/2011,"This is kind of my go-to place whenever we have a big birthday party or large family gathering because it's one of the few restaurants in Elk Grove that can accommodate 15+ people. But it's also a good place to for one-on-one dates because they have a bar area with a few cozy little booths and seats at the bar with several large televisions. I like to try their different kinds of deep dish pizza (BBQ Chicken is my fav!!) They also have a vast variety of beers and ciders. I recently discovered split beers, like the Snake Bite, and they also have other combinations of half cider, half beer. I want to go back to try them all. I gave them 4 stars because I always have a good time hanging out with my friends here, or stopping by for their happy hour late at night. It's one of the very few places in EG open past midnight on the weekends. But be forewarned: it can get very crowded on certain days, so expect to spend a few hours altogether--waiting for a table, waiting for your food, slow service, etc--if you're planning to come on a weekend night. If you really don't like waiting then I suggest going somewhere else. I bumped them up half a star because they hand out free pizookies on your birthday!!! And sometimes even if it's several days past your birthday...how nice of them! =) Also, this is totally off topic...but their floors are super, SUPER slippery! So ladies, even if you like to dress up before you go out, I wouldn't recommend wearing heels here, unless you have someone sturdy to hold onto."
Austin K.,"Sacramento, CA",26,143,7,3.0,10/17/2013,"Pretty good food for a chain. You know what you're going to get. The deep dish pizza is good, but if you're looking for Chicago style, this is not the place for you. Definitely come for good beers and a fairly large menu."
mark s.,"Monterey, CA",35,35,2,3.0,5/15/2015,Food decent. Service was HORRENDOUS. Hour and half to get the order to the table.  Raise the bar Elk Grove.
Michael H.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,6,4,5.0,5/12/2014,"My favorite place , cool atmosphere , great brews food and plays my favorite songs, not to mention sports on tvs..."
Michael B.,"Sacramento, CA",0,10,,2.0,5/10/2015,"I NEVER get good service when I come here at night. Not once. There is ALWAYS a wait for all of the above: drinks, foods, seating, and even to pay the tab. The food here is something that I wouldn't mind eating, but I never crave for it. I would rather spend my money elsewhere, where I'd be full AND satisfied. I only come here for a late dinner with friends or family. Other than that, I wouldn't come here."
Dave C.,"Galt, CA",9,50,,2.0,10/14/2013,"The appetizer was cold, but I ate it anyway. When the entre came out cold I refused it and asked for the check. Didn't even get a visit from the manager."
Sarah W.,"Sacramento, CA",105,11,10,1.0,5/26/2013,"In the past BJ's has always been my go to place for parties, get togethers, dates, and girls night outs. I recently have boycotted BJs though and I will explain why. My mother ordered a large pizza to go from BJ's. My dad went to pick it up. When he brought it home I opened the box and crawling across our pizza was a large beetle. I immediately took several photos. So we go back to BJ's and show them what we found. They at first were just going to remake the pizza. I explained that they are lucky I dont report them to the Department of Public Health. So then they try to throw in a $15 gift card. I of course am upset because there was a live bug on my food. That's beyond being not ok. I eventually settled for a $30 gift card but I still plan on reporting what happened to corporate and also to the Department of Public Health."
Jared P.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,6,,5.0,7/13/2015,"I've been here twice in the last two weeks (as well as many times before) and I have to say my experience has been consistent and excellent. The only thing that ever annoys me is they don't give you a napkin and utensils when you sit down (had to ask both times). First time I went with my girlfriend. We were seated instantly near dinner time, had a very bubbly and helpful server named Adam, and had our appetizers in under 10 minutes. Same experience for when I went with my parents and brother at dinner time, really quick service. My girlfriend and I got the Avocado Egg Rolls and Sriracha Honey Brussle Sprouts, I highly recommend both. The egg rolls are like nothing you have ever had, creamy avocado slices with a southwest filling and ginger dipping sauce, it works deliciously, and a big portion. The brussle sprouts I will get everytime now, only $5, good portion, and the taste is unlike any brussle sprouts I've had, perfect. They are crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, drizzled with a sriracha honey sauce that doesn't over power either taste, nice and tangy, you need to try them. For dinner we got the Black and Bleu Burger and the Pulled Pork Sandwich. Our food was there in under 10 minutes after the appetizers, very fast. The black and blue is great, blue cheese, bacon, roma tomatoes, and roasted garlic aioli, I nearly licked my girlfriends fingers after she gave me a small bite. The pulled pork was fantastic as well, it's huge, great coleslaw, tangy bbq sauce, nice big chunks of pork and a bit of fat back, it was just juicy and filling. After all that we were freaking stuffed, and we had only been there for 30 minutes! Plenty of to go boxes. Adam was prompt all throughout the service, got us anything with a smile and was fast, he got a nice tip. I can't say anything bad about this place, it's like an upscale Cheesecake Factory, and has nearly as many items, something for everyone. The place is really cool looking too, just like a giant sports bar, but not noise or crowded feeling, very nice murals, tons of big screens, and really good low priced beers too. Try it for sure."
Ashley R.,"Elk Grove, CA",95,190,100,4.0,1/30/2012,Havent been dissapointed with Bjs food-always something good our server last night Sierra was a lil pushy and and seemed like she wanted us to hurry with all our drink and food selections but with other servers in the past we havent had any issue
Chris C.,"Elk Grove, CA",8,63,8,2.0,4/24/2014,"First, our waiter was acting strange to our relative that was visiting from out of town.    He would contradict everything he said, such as ""I would like the seasoned fries"", the waiter would say ""so you want the wedge cut"".   Now that is fine if he was looking for clarification, but he would do that with every item.   My son in law  would read verbatim from the menu and  the waiter would proceed to correct him.    We had a laugh about it but then.... Our food was cold and not that good.   My husband had to ask for his food because apparently they forget his food.   We had to ask twice to get our drinks refilled.    When we left, my husband is a happy go lucky guy so he said ""good night, thanks"".   Apparently, the staff was too busy screwing around to notice and did not say anything.   They could clearly see customers were leaving.  I will never waste my money going here or recommend someone eat at this establishment."
Leena N.,"Santa Ana, CA",1184,355,2455,1.0,8/16/2009,"Ok. I'm speaking only for this BJs in Sacramento.  On the MANY occasions I've been here, whether it's a date or a party, the service has ALWAYS BEEN HORRENDOUS. Wait is always long, the servers does a crappy job. Assuming gratuity is already added, they half @ss their jobs. I asked for refills more than plenty of times.... blah blah blah.... hate that place"
Justine G.,"West Sacramento, CA",22,11,2,1.0,4/19/2015,"My boyfriend and I showed up 30 minutes to closing and the waiter was a young man,he handed our menus and was trying to be nice, we were unsure on orders and he had checked in two times prior after ordering received your first appetizer which was okay. after we received your second appetizer and our main course all at the same time we had ordered artichoke hearts as a second appetizer which were right off the grill but tasted horrible. I had ordered The clamshell chowder bowl my soup was cold as well as the bread. My husband's plate was the salmon which lacked any flavoringand the vegetables that had came with his plate were frozen and tasteless. After ordering our food The waiter hadn't checked in on us at all or asked us how our food was without being asked he handed us our bill. I do not recommend the food nor the customer service I will not be returning to this restaurant ever it has been a disappointment and ruined our dinner."
Danielle L.,"Midtown, Sacramento, CA",41,2,,1.0,10/5/2013,"Absolutely the most horrible service I have ever received from a BJ's!!!!! I came here for a baby shower... A time that is suppose to be a special occasion for someone. Needless to say our waiter never checked on us, she didn't even take half of the tables order! I realize that the server knows she is getting an automatic gratuity from us but you still need to do your job! We finally flagged down another server to get her for us and she came over and talked to me as if I was stupid. I actually helped open this restaurant many years ago as a server and their expectations have obviously gone down."
Andrea T.,"Elk Grove, CA",166,221,2552,4.0,1/14/2012,"Love their late night happy hour here.  I always come and get the half off mini pizza and I like the selection of beers they have here.  I think I like Blondie the most.  Nice, light and crisp.  As for dessert, I absolutely love the beignet here! Soft, warm and slightly sweet with cinnamon sugar sprinkled on top with strawberries and a side of vanilla ice cream as well! Taste like heaven!"
Yvonne N.,"Sacramento, CA",1409,648,1562,4.0,3/11/2011,"In this amazing town we call Sacramento, more specifically EG (Elk Grove), BJ's is pretty much the only late night hang out spot that's available 7 nights a week. Their brilliant idea of a late night happy hour has got us all suckered!  The only thing actually happy about it is half off their mini pizzas.  I love, love, love their  Great White; alfredo with mushrooms, garlic, seasoned tomatoes, Parmesan cheese and chicken breast..favorite part being the garlic!!  I always ask the server to make my pizza extra crispy.  The mediterranean is delish, too. Other okay items that go well with their house brewed beer are the ahi poke, chicken wings, bruschetta, thai salad wraps, and gourmet mac and cheese!  Their berry cider is a creeper, too.  As for dessert, everyone knows about their pizookies.  They also added strawberry beignets to their menu.  It comes with fresh strawberries, whipped cream and vanilla ice cream.  Although it's not a real beignet, it sure satisfies my sweet tooth! Don't get me wrong; their food and beer isn't bad..I love the food and atmosphere they provide.  It's just a bit pricey for what they're serving.  And their happy hour doesn't help. Although...for lunch, they have unlimited soup and salad for $7.  Your choice of house or caesar, minestrone, clam chowder, broccoli cheddar andddd..I forget the 4th soup choice..but their clam chowder is so creamy and delicious!!  Lovesss it!"
