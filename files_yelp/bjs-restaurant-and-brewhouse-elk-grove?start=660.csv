R K.,"Sacramento, CA",14,17,,1.0,5/30/2013,"We returned to eat here last night and we were not pleased.  I used to love the pizza here - I had imagined the cooks in the back preparing a pizza from scratch each time, because they tasted so good.  Last night the magic was gone and we even decided not to return in the near future.   We each ordered Caesar salads which were good.  I ordered the Tatonka Stout, which was as good as I remembered.  Then the pizza came out.  It was cold!  I mean the cheese wasn't even melted cold.  I mean cold to the touch cold.  We called the first server we saw and she apologized and took it away to be heated more.  It came out again - it was luke warm.  Usually when I had pizza here the slices were too hot to touch.  I always had to use a knife and fork to eat the first slice, that's how hot it used to be.  But even after the pizza came out the second time I could grab the first slice with my hands and take a bite without having hot melted cheese heat up your mouth -  it was like it had been sitting out for half an hour.  I don't know how they make their pizzas here, I guess they are pre-made and frozen and then thrown in a blast oven or something.  But last night they couldn't get it right.   We complained again and the manager came out, apologized and asked what we wanted.  We said we wanted a new pizza because getting the same pizza reheated three times would dry it out.  She agreed and we waited for another pizza. The new pizza was weird.  It was luke warm in the middle and steaming hot around the crusts. We decided the food preparers (I won't even call them cooks) didn't know what they were doing.  So we just ate a couple slices each and took the rest to go.     Though the manager checked on us, we felt she was a little abrubt and uncaring.  We paid full price for the lousy experience.  I have been to places where a manager will a least give you a free drink when they screw up - and they screwed up badly here - but not last night.  We tipped the waitress a good tip because she was attentive and the lousy pizza was not her fault.  The salads were okay, and the Tatonka Stout was devine.  But we aren't going back, at least not for a long time.  If I want to reheat a frozen pizza I can do that at home."
Linda S.,"Sacramento, CA",26,17,32,3.0,7/6/2012,"I love bj brew house, but this one on laguna is not that great. Services is good, but the food is not. My salad was under season and the chicken was still pink. And the rice I order for my son was not even cook. Overall I just blame the chef who was cooking that day"
Faye V.,"San Francisco, CA",47,59,52,4.0,1/10/2012,"My restaurant nightmare is sending food back to the kitchen. True story. I am extremely afraid of getting pubic-hair-pizza or spit-back-spaghetti. I have never ever returned food to the kitchen - no matter how badly -- at least until we were served an overcooked steak at BJ's. The twist? It was because of this overcooked steak that BJ's at Elk Grove made me a fan. It was actually my mother's order. The scene: It's the week before Christmas, we hit up BJ's after a shopping marathon, all starved. Drinks and appetizers came, followed by the main dishes. Everyone dove into their plates like vultures. But, as famished as mamskii was, she wasn't touching it.  She was so turned off, she just pushed her plate aside. Luckily for us, the server noticed her dissatisfaction and was extremely kind about everything. Furthermore, the manager himself came over to remedy the situation. Within 20 minutes, a brand new steak arrived, cooked perfectly at medium well - served with a baked potato and all the fixings. Their overall method of the handling everything impressed us all. The staff was very courteous and the manager's extra effort did not go unnoticed. Although it was my nightmare come true, my fears waned - a little. We've eaten here before and everything has always been a-okay. The food is decent, the servers efficient and the atmosphere perfect for a group of 10 equipped with two toddlers and a man-child. Our cups never went empty, our meals always served timely. Most importantly, because it's a chain, the menu is reliable. Spit-back spaghetti is still a fear - regardless of where I eat. However, if you want a laid back joint to enjoy a few beers with friends or have dinner with the family, BJ's at Elk Grove is a good option. Our fave appetizers are the wings, nachos, calamari and bruschetta. The pizza and pastas have never gone wrong and the fish dishes are a nice surprise. If you have room for dessert - that pizookie is pretty darn delish. I believe that others may not have gotten the same service - but I'm glad we've been lucky. It's one of my brother-in-law's faves and we'll definitely be back."
Ricky N.,"Sacramento, CA",480,355,92,3.0,3/3/2011,"One word for the Yelp world, OVERPRICED! Sure, the food is good and the service is decent. Nice environment which makes it a good place to hang out. It's a step up from the typical sports bar, without the annoying old drunks and crappy bar food. Almost everyone is a fan of their ""hand-crafted"" brewed beer, probably because after two pints, everyone is talking loud without realizing it. Their happy hour is lame and I don't see what's so happy about it. When you get the tab, the pathetic smiley face the waiter/waitress draws on tries to distract you from their expensive prices. You aren't that happy. They do have good appetizers (Avocado Egg Rolls) and tasty pizza, which is usually loaded with toppings and a thick, buttery crust. That also means its loaded with calories."
Chris H.,"Sacramento, CA",3,75,5,1.0,2/27/2015,Service sucked. Had a party of about 10. Got skipped when ordering. When I walked up to our incompetent server Dylan I believe his name was he was just like ok. When our food came we didn't have any silver ware to eat with. Never came to refill our water. Feel sorry if you have him as a server.
Mark F.,"Pollock Pines, CA",33,1,1,2.0,2/20/2014,"Our party of three was seated for about 15 minutes before we even had a server come talk to us. We then waited forever for our food and drinks, one which was wrong. We ended up with a female server who came to take our dessert order. She came back about 20 mins later to ask us if we wanted to order dessert. She seemed impaired in some way. She then informed us that there was a mix up in the kitchen but our order was in. In was obvious she was lying. We finally got our dessert. Overall, the food was decent but the service insured our never returning to the Elk Grove location."
Sharon B.,"Sacramento, CA",2,35,14,4.0,6/10/2013,"I must admit I have never had a problem with this establishment  until 6/9/13.  I ordered a meal online so that I could have it delivered to my car since I am disabled.  I arrived 10 minutes early.  I called to let BJ's to let them know I was in the parking lot.  Come to find out they did not have my order.  So the waiter (Andrass) took my order of Clam Chowder, Crispy Fried Artichokes, Seared Ahi Tuna Salad, and a Pork Chop dinner with Chicken Tortilla Soup and my membership number. I explained that I want to use my 75 points for a $5 reduction in price. I figured another 20 minutes.  It was an hour. When I got my food, I asked Andraas if he took the $5 off  - he said he forgot. Needless to say i was not in a good mood and was starving. When I got my food out the bags - my artichokes were cold and my chicken tortilla soup was replaced with chicken noodle.  Normally I would let it slide (since it was late) - not this time. I spoke to Adrian the manager and explained what happened.  He was understanding and said the artichokes were complimentary and took the $5 off.    He thanked me for letting him know the error because so many people don't notify the managers. There will be some retraining - yeah for standing up and getting some real service.  BJ's I will be coming back for my Ahi Tuna Salad again. If you decide to eat inside - call to make a reservation - especially after 1700."
DX J.,"Odessa, DE",0,95,,2.0,4/9/2013,3rd trip .First 2 visits were OK but nothing special. Disappointed this trip. Why you might inquire: Drink order mistake #1: wrong drink but could not remember what I ordered anyway. Drink order mistake #2: hot tea but no cup to put it in. Salad: forgot any dressing whatsoever. Entree: wife finished hers before I even got mine. Entree: way too long under the heat lamp and dried out my food.  It wasn't busy but seemed disorganized nonetheless. Not sure I will return.
Eric T.,"Elk Grove, CA",454,4,,2.0,4/6/2011,"I've gone to this BJs since its opened, and the only reason I've been going there is for their food and larger space for parties. We all know the food quality and menu, since it is a larger chain of restaurant, so there isn't much to change there from the other BJ's.  Biggest critique I have for this place is their staff. I have been there at different times of the day (lunch, dinner, happy hour) and I have never had an above par experience. Whether it be feeling rushed, messing up on an order, messing up on a receipt / ring up, or being spilled on, it always seems like something goes wrong. And I'm not the type of person to look for the flaws it just seems like there isn't a high standard there. This is actually the first and only place I've had to talk to a manager about my service."
Shaunta R.,"Sacramento, CA",554,45,33,4.0,11/19/2013,Always a nice place before or after dinner. Game is always on and nice staff. Good food tons of beer to choose. But make sure you grab a pazookie
Nani V.,"Sacramento, CA",294,445,301,4.0,9/29/2009,"I guess I should say, the rating is only for the food. I came here a few years back and totally forgot what I ordered, I do remember good times though. I went back last night to be exact with the bf and his brother who was in town. I ordered the Roasted Turkey Cobb Sandwich with the crispy thin fries, bf ordered the Cuban Burger with the wedged seasoned fries, and the brother ordered the Angus Roast Beef Dip. The guys killed their sandwiches, while I only finished half of mine and couldn't eat anymore, but the food was awesome.  Our waiter totally sucked though. He kept forgetting our lemons for the beer, forgot to give the brother's ID back to him (since he was out of state, they had to take it for verification), and forgot to bring him his beer. He even said, ""Are you sure I didn't bring it out?"" Are you serious? He only had 3 other tables besides us...I will be back, but only for the food."
Sara V.,"Sacramento, CA",0,71,10,5.0,3/5/2015,"Can't say enough about our server tonight. Food was decent, got a table right away, drinks were good... But the server made our evening so awesome. Wish I'd gotten his name. Tall black guy , amazing attitude. Brought us special desserts for our coworkers last day at work celebration, was polite funny and attentive... Bjs is usually just ok but because of him the experience was memorable. Visit was tonight 3/5 approx 6-8pm and we sat in the back corner large booth with a baby in a high chair. Hope the managers see this and properly recognize their employee! Thanks for a great evening."
Patty L.,"Sacramento, CA",104,107,12,3.0,11/6/2013,"You can't really go wrong with happy hour at BJ's. They are a little slow with service, but what can you expect when it is happy hour. I do kind of miss some of the items they had on the happy hour menu, but the replacement are just as good."
Alice L.,"Elk Grove, CA",201,140,40,4.0,1/17/2011,"Great place for a hangout with friends!! Great atmosphere, bartenders & servers are usually really nice & friendly during happy hour (which is usually when we go). BJs is always a nice alternative after a failed night of attempting to go out around Sac.  The food, I haven't tried much of their menu even though I've been plenty of times.  I always get the calamari as part of my appetizer, the buffalo wings are also very veryy delicious! I've tried the flatbreads and I don't really like them.. the pizzas, yum! I can't remember all the ones I've tried but the most recent one was the buffalo chicken and it was sooooo good even though it was super spicy!"
Lindy Y.,"Elk Grove, CA",77,21,14,2.0,3/1/2014,"Food is usually pretty good when it is right.  I would say that 8 out of 10 times it's usually good.  The service is just the opposite.  2 out of 10 times it is good.  We went there recently, was sat down and for over 15 minutes servers just walked past us.  No one acknowledged us, so my husband waived down a server to ask if someone would help us, the server just answered yeah, as he was walking away from our table and did not return.  We decided that was enough and for up and left.  We don't  come too often anymore mostly because of this.  Each time we think that we may get better service we are always disappointed.  Bjs may be a place we ""used"" to go to."
Amy T.,"Houston, TX",973,503,162,4.0,1/7/2009,"This is the only BJ's I have ever been to. I have been here several times and my experiences have been good and bad.  I came here last night because we were in the mood for pizza and other foods. My boyfriend had the small mediterranean pizza which was very tasty! The small size is also a large portion of food, probably enough for two small appetites. At the price of $14.95 it was well worth it. I ordered Derek's Favorite Meatloaf Sandwich. It was meatloaf on top of buttered toast and mashed potatoes on top of all of that. It was the perfect combination! The dish also came with vegetables. The meatloaf sandwich was less than $9. The food is usually good other than pasta! I have had the pasta here and it was dry and the chicken pasta comes with overly grilled burnt chicken! I had to send back the chicken before because it was too burnt to eat. My only complaint regarding the food would be the dry pasta, other than that, everything is satisfying.  The famous BJ's pizookies are truly to die for! My personal favorite is the apple crisp with vanilla ice cream. My boyfriend and I love it and are always able to finish it all because it is just THAT good! The combination of the warm apple crisp and the vanilla ice cream is perfect. At the price of $5.50 it was definitely worth every penny.  BJ's is an affordable place to eat. They usually have a great deal of specials. They have lunch specials that cost less than $9. Also, at certain times their mini pizzas only cost $5.  The reason I gave this place 4 stars is because the service is not always outstanding. Some servers fail to acknowledge you as a paying customer and neglect you completely. It doesn't hurt to smile to the people that you are serving.  I am definitely a fan of this location and will continue to be a returning costumer."
Danell E.,"Bozeman, MT",0,13,,1.0,5/11/2015,Bad experience at the curbside pick up for Mother's Day lunch.  Our meals were missing all of our side orders and the food was mediocre at best.  The bison burger was raw and the chicken was burned!  Not going back.  Made our Mother's Day a bad memory not the good kind we should all have.  The only sweet note is the overpriced pizookie that the melted liquid ice cream drowned underneath.  Crazy for $69 we couldn't get one decent meal.  Bummer!
Manny S.,"Elk Grove, CA",5,7,,1.0,5/30/2013,"What a bad experience. We decided to go after my nephews graduation like a lot of other people. Not a good idea.  Initial wait time 1+ hour, another 30+ minutes to get our drinks and appetizers and our dinner 30+ minutes later. Worst customer service. The food was not bad but when you got hungry, upset and angry kids and adults who cares. Instead of cramming people in, why not tell people we are sorry but we are full for the night."
Cody W.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,5,1,1.0,3/29/2014,"Basic, basic, basic! We stared at our food because we had no silverware until I had to finally stop someone for some. No refill on water, really! Food was horribly bland especially the no salt or even pepper pasta & gummy bear textured potstickers.  **Save your dinner $ on another restaurant but DO come for their Pizookie! Worth every tasty penny**"
Lynda H.,"Elk Grove, CA",2,3,1,1.0,6/5/2013,"Plenty of empty tables, but yet still had to wait awhile for a seat.... Really? And another 10 minutes before a server even showed up.. Should have just walked out."
