Halani X.,"West Sacramento, CA",35,108,40,2.0,5/17/2011,"I'm really not impressed with BJ's food. I have dined here on a few occasions, but my last stop was to pick up a couple of party platters for a Bridal Shower I was helping host. When I went in to pre-order my dishes (caesar salad and fettuccine alfredo with grilled chicken) I was assured  the party trays were generous and filled. However, when I picked up the food a week later, the pasta tray was only half full with little to no alfredo sauce. The pasta was so dry and flavorless, it did not impress me or the guests. When I placed the order for the salad I was offered a variety of salad dressings on the side, but when I picked it up I was only given one type. Although I was given plenty of napkins and utensils, it would have been helpful to provide serving utensils on top of it. I'm going to stay away from BJ's food if at all possible and just get my fill on beer and cider from now on."
Sarah G.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,47,4,3.0,2/14/2014,"Very loud, stressful environment but if their gluten-free pizza is really gluten-free it is fabulous."
Lina A.,"Sacramento, CA",0,11,,1.0,2/13/2013,"I went in a few days ago with a large group to celebrate my birthday and service was horrible. They messed up on my order,  getting me the wrong meat. And when I reordered and got something different, there was a hair, yes A HAIR in my food! It was blonde, like our waitresses hair, that was beyond gross. I let them know that and told them I didn't want to eat anymore and I didn't.  Then we come to pay, we gave our waitress the right amount, and before giving her the check with the money, we checked like 3 times. She comes back and says we are missing $17.54, so we checked everything again and the full amount was there. At the end, one of us had to go with her and found out that she hadn't pushed mastercard instead of visa so it didn't add up... ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!  Thanks for ruining my birthday and keeping me hungry.  Never again!"
Scott S.,"Elk Grove, CA",147,197,215,3.0,6/15/2011,"I had an early dinner tonight with my mom.  I was stoked to come here because I love the one in Folsom.   We arrived at about 4:45 and we're greated and sat very promptly.  Our waitress was quick to take our order and offer suggestions for apps, I did get the stuffed mushrooms. The mushrooms came quickly and were GREAT.  We gobbled them up in a matter of seconds.  And comes the waiting game.  We sat there for about 20 minutes before seeing our food. Now I did get a pizza, but wow. Oh I did get 2 refills. My pizza showed up and it was actually cold.  None of that scold your mouth,gooeyness at all.  I considered sending it back, but her food was fine and I was Famished. Even cold it was still ok. The overall meal was just average but I will absolutely go back."
Lisa H.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",124,306,17,3.0,12/20/2012,"Normally I would probably rate BJ's a little higher since we come quite often as a family and typically have decent experiences (it would never be above a four star, however). But we came here yesterday with a group of 12 from work for our holiday celebration and they really messed up our group dining experience. I have been here for groups before and they were fine, so I am going to chalk this up to an anomoly, otherwise I probably would have rated this even lower. First off it took a while to be seated even though we had reservations and then it took them a while to bring menus. Ordering seemed to go okay. Personally I try to order as simply as possible in group situations just because things can get messed up easily. Things got very messed up quickly. My food was fine. I got a buger melt and it was satisfying. However, one person in our party had ordered a pizza with no onions and when they brought it, sure enough there were onions. Someone else's soup was lukewarm and someone else had ordered a bowl of soup and recieved a cup. When she asked if it was a cup, they confirmed that it was and she said she wanted a bowl. They said they would bring her another cup to make up for it. She never got her other cup or her brushetta that she ordered. Everyone was done eating and she asked the waitress for her brushetta to go. The waitress was like ""you didn't get it?"" and looked around the table like she was lying. When the bill came she was also charged for a bowl of soup. The new pizza also had to be boxed to go as it never came out during our two hour lunch. Multiple people were also charged seperate entree prices for items that were lunch specials. It took even longer to get the bill straigtened out.  BJ's is almost always crowded, so try and come on less busy times or in small groups unless you want to wait forever. They have lots of beers and the pizza is usually pretty decent. I hope that our work lunch was just a one time issue because we typically consider BJ's to be a pretty solid choice for our family."
C R.,"Pittsburg, CA",0,99,,4.0,4/20/2014,"Great place for food and drinks and service was great too. Made it before the dinner rush because it got crowded pretty quick. Located in a busy area where once can do some shopping and get something to eat. If I am in the area and hungry, will stop by again."
Nas E.,"Oakland, CA",101,90,118,3.0,1/23/2011,"Bj's is a good place to grab a beer or two with your friends.  It is ALWAYS packed so if you're impatient, go elsewhere.  I've been to this place plenty of times to tell you that the service is inconsistant.  I've had very joyful servers to ones who has a dildo up their crack.  So I would say that their service is alright.  Food is mediocore but the beer is good.  I usually order the Jeremiah Red or their Blonde.  Bj's is a bit pricey so don't come here with a slim wallet."
Amber N.,"Sacramento, CA",1,15,5,2.0,3/2/2014,Horrible service. We ordered a pitcher of beer and it sat at the wrong table for 20 minutes then when our waitress finally came to see us we told her and she just handed it to us. Warm beer and warm mugs. Not our kinda brew house! Salads were horrible and food was skimpy. Won't Come back
James M.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",32,223,89,3.0,12/3/2013,Surprisingly they had 1 Gluten Free beer (Omission Ale in a bottle) and some of the soups - salads or GF pizza.  My wife and daughter had lunch and our only complaint was the cost.
M B.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,21,,2.0,6/14/2013,I would never wait an hour in line for a super expensive pizza that tastes just OK. I dont know why people are so rabid for BJ's. The food is fairly good and the place is really nice but the $$$ is a little offputting. I think $30 for some pork chops and potatos is just too much.
The Dude ..,"Elk Grove, CA",155,73,3,5.0,1/5/2011,"The waiting area is spacious and nice. The outdoor waiting area reminds me of a club that has a back door patio. Ambiance and feel makes it upscale. only thing that griped me was that I couldnt smoke cause someone brought their kids and was standing outside by the ash tray. On the plus side seeing children makes it feel more laid back then upscale, does this make sense? If a parent can bring their kids to a bar then the food and atmosphere is great right? We were seated at a bigger table for just me and my girlfriend. It was like winning the lottery, first in line gets the next table and we got the kings booth or something.  although we did get a few ppl near the bar staring at our table like they wanted it. It's good to be envied. The food and beer came fast. Always love it when you get your beer within 3 minutes if asking for it. Loved the artichoke dip, freshly made chips were nice and warm. And the chciken wings were huge. The pasta was fresh with nice cream and butter with out an over powering grease feel. All of the portions in the food was great. Had people staring at us wanting our table but ehhh too bad, sucks to be them. You check in at the front desk for a reason. Is it me or do people ignore the big front desk to check in and walk in like they some body to demand things and expect to get it done now? Do people think the evil eye actually works?"
Debbie P.,"Sacramento, CA",75,343,138,3.0,1/9/2011,"The service at this location was pretty slow, but on a plus the Irish Root Beer is delicious."
SD R.,"San Diego, CA",0,6,,2.0,1/15/2014,"The location is the only reason I eat here (by my hotel).  I have been here 3 times in the last 2 months, and each time, I am disappointed.  The food is never hot and the management team does not seem to care.  This time, I actually told the server that my chicken was barely warm, and not even a courtesy visit from the manager.  I'm a table of one, so it can't be that hard to execute a hot meal.  I'm sure I will come back again, and afterwards, ask myself why."
Angel M.,"Sacramento, CA",0,6,,3.0,4/3/2015,"I walked in to pick up my take out and the people didnt acknowledge me for a few minutes. These two girls were being rude to the newbie and kind of rude to me. The food was ready when i got there and it only took 20 minutes. But then they took another 20 minutes just to get me my ranch.. I get home and look at my spaghetti marinara and there a little bit of sauce in the middle of noodles. There was nothing significant about it, no flavor, ive made some bomb ass spaghetti in my time.. The fries and ranch are ways great though!"
Paula P.,"Elk Grove, CA",12,111,19,3.0,11/15/2013,Food is great and delicious. Customer service is slow and it takes years for my food to come out. They need more servers/waiter because one person serving 10 tables at a time is no bueno.
Scott B.,"Sacramento, CA",20,30,11,1.0,9/22/2010,"Firstly, I do love the food here.  Great pizza.  Decent prices.  Good beer selection.  But I just can't get past something very important: The service is absolutely terrible.  It ruins the experience every time I go.  I've given them at LEAST 8 shots at redeeming themselves, and they have not done so (for some reason I keep getting roped into going here because groups of family or friends end up here, to my protests).  From the second you enter the place, the hosts are ALWAYS snooty and rude, and the wait staff is short, rude, and slow, with a few exceptions.  I imagine the wait staff is terribly overworked, so I don't blame the employees themselves, per se.   Frankly, the fact that they are always busy seems to make them think they are doing something right.  Who am I to blame them for not making changes, when they are still the most popular restaurant in Elk Grove?  In reality, the Elk Grove suburbanites are just so fad-obsessed and have ZERO standards, they don't seem to care.  I can say this, because I spent the first 22 years of my life there.  I've seen all the great locally owned restaurants get put out of business by the onslaught of chain restaurants (RIP Elk Grove Brewery, Papa's Pizza, Plantation Coffee, etc).  When the next fad chain restaurant opens in Elk Grove, this place will hopefully get a severe reality check.  My favorite restaurants tend to have very overworked staff, and service isn't the best, but at least they aren't outright rude.  I can't say the same for BJ's.  I've had great experiences at other BJ's locations, but Elk Grove is the exception."
Greg L.,"Sacramento, CA",32,9,1,2.0,3/27/2013,"Had a really bad expereince with the service.  Had a reservation, showed up and they could not find my reservation.  I spoke with the girl that took the reservation from me and she looked at me blankly and said it would be 45 minutes until we would be seated.  Won't go back."
Karen L.,"Elk Grove, CA",1,14,,4.0,3/25/2015,"Very consistent menu, with something for everyone.   Don't love the service, but the food keeps me going back."
Mike G.,"Sacramento, CA",58,45,,2.0,2/28/2011,"Even though I pretty much don't like the food here, I end up coming back to this place for some odd reason only to be disappointed once again. I guess that is what I get for going to a brewhouse to eat rather than drink. I ordered the salmon with a side of veggies. The veggies weren't just cold; they were fresh out of the freezer. Mmmm.... Ice shavings. Salmon was like sushi. I like sushi, but not at BJ's.  Oh yeah... Our waitress dropped off our check after the appetizers - before our main course. Then, 5 minutes after our main course, she asked if we wanted To Go boxes. She looked a bit overworked and flustered.  On a positive note, their brew is decent."
Erin T.,"Sacramento, CA",35,23,,5.0,9/4/2011,"We went on a Wednesday night after a bit of shopping, I was super hungry as I am pregnant.  The wait was 15-20 minutes as promised.  It was a busy night, but I knew that from the looks of the parking lot.  This was my first time trying this place out and I was excited to try the food, and it became worth the wait, so I am glad I waited!! We ordered entrees and no appetizers, but they brought out our soup really fast.  The soup was delicious I had tomato bisque and my boyfriend ordered the broccoli cheddar.  HE LOVED IT. We ordered the New York Strip for both of us, he got his with creamy white cheddar mashed potatoes which I thought were DELICIOUS. My baked potato that came with my steak was very large and also very good.  (the leftover baked potato was still great the day after when I reheated it in the oven for lunch)  The steak was excellent and juicy. MAKE SURE YOU CALL AHEAD FOR SEATING, as I did not know about this feature and next time I will do so!!! They also serve lunch and BRUNCH!!!! Looks like they have great beer (pregnant so didn't try), as well as some great desserts.  (THIS IS A MUST FOR ME NEXT TIME)"
