Kathy Y.,"Sacramento, CA",136,230,293,3.0,6/14/2011,"There's something about BJ's that even with bad service (most of the time), I still come here.  It MUST be because of the pizookie... Service here is so-so.  I've had servers who were friendly and quirky, then servers who were rude and didn't even care.  I guess they didn't want the tip that badly.  They don't do separate checks, but you can pay with multiple cards as long as you indicate which is which.  The kitchen is closed around midnight, which would have been nice if the server had told us because it was a friend's birthday, and he didn't get his complimentary pizookie!!  You know how we like our free stuff, especially when it comes to food!! Anyway, I like to order the Angle Hair Toscana pasta with shrimp.  The portion is HUGE and it comes with two pieces of garlic bread (yummy).  If you go during lunch hour, I'd recommend to order the ""half-order"".  The Grilled Chicken Potato (part of their ""Giant Stuffed Potatoes) is pretty good also.  There's plenty of potato, chicken and the jack cheese is perfectly melted.  I tried the Chicken BBQ pizza and was not a fan, partially because I didn't like the taste of BBQ sauce on my pizza.  The Great White however was pretty good.  The ahi poke is a great appetizer.  The seasoning on the chips fulfills the flavor of this dish.  And of course, don't skip out on a pizookie!  They have red velvet, which was pretty good ... but I'd probably stick to my all time favorite, white chocolate macadamia nut. The happy hour here does get busy.  The drinks are good and I've never had a problem with it.  They also serve cider too!"
Ike D.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,36,1,1.0,10/22/2010,Service sucks. Pizza ok. Food sucks. Service sucks. Only thing here that doesn't suck is the beer which is ok
Rayne G.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,10,,5.0,3/19/2015,I really enjoy coming to BJ's. It really is a nice place to eat but it is too expensive for what you get. 2 fish and chips and 2 bowls of clam chowder was almost $50 without tip or drinks and usually I get the calamari with that so your looking at like 80$ for 2 people if you get appetizers and normal meals. I think its too much for what you get. Besides that the service is usually great and the beers I am told are good too. It is a nice place to come ever once and a while.
D J.,"Elk Grove, CA",4,48,7,3.0,8/16/2012,"The BJ's experience: 1. Walk in and receive pager 2. Proceed to your ""wait spot"". It is crowded inside and if you're not nimble enough someone else will get that spot on the couch that just came up. Quick, another spot .... nope, too late. Just go wait outside. Really. 45 minutes to an hour later, buzzing and light show 3. You're greeted well enough and if you manage to make it past the slippery as a wet noodle floor you're finally seated 4. Wait staff is hit and miss. Go in knowing this and you'll be fine 5. Page 1 of the novel they call a menu is a snoozer so just head over to the pizza chapter. If you order anything else you'll be full but only mildly satisfied 6. If you order anything other than raw veggies, expect to waiting another +/-30 minutes. 45 minutes of you order the pizza 7. After a few bites of whatever you ordered you'll quickly realize that you should have taken my advise and ordered the pizza. Sucks for you. Should have listened to me 8. Pizookie: You're getting one. Don't pretend that you're not. Just have one and hit the gym tomorrow 9. Pay 10. Watch out for the slippery floor on the way out"
Hector S.,"Elk Grove, CA",115,26,38,4.0,8/15/2013,Love their tacos. And always ger good service when I come here.
Tyffani N.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",208,83,15,3.0,3/18/2011,"This place is a great place to have a beer and watch a game, it is similar to an applebees, or tgif, but they brew their own beer which is pretty cool.   Ive been to a BJ's in LA and its pretty much the same, the servers are pretty cool, there are tons of busers to help bring food out and clean up, so it makes me feel like I should give more tip so everyone can split.. but i dont know how they handle that so I tip accordingly, 15%+ I love their cajun pasta. this entre deserves a 5 star!!! .. the portions are big and can probably feed two people.   They are also famous for their pizza and their pizzoooki (ice cream over a warm chocolate cookie) My suggestion, do not have a big party of 10+. I have been to many birthday parties and their service is horrible!!!!!!!!!!  I am assuming that since they know they automatically get tipped well, they can care less about the service and that is very unfortunate!!! Once this server was carrying food over my friend's heads, and yelling at ppl saying this is the last call for their order.. I mean who does that?   They are not that organized when it comes to who ordered what..."
Priscilla G.,"Sacramento, CA",184,56,31,2.0,1/6/2011,"I hate chain restaurants almost as much as I hate Elk Grove and the majority of the people who live there. HOWEVER, I have family and friends in EG and if we go out to eat, I'm LUCKY if its BJ's so I have to give it its props. The food isn't bland like most chain food, it has some flavor and the deep dish pizzas are different (in a good way).  I like the bruchetta and chicken wrap appetizers. The great white and mediterranean pizzas are yummy. If you get something with fries, opt for the wedge cut fries, they are crispy and perfect. The beer is good, just overpriced. The pizookies are weird, I just skip dessert. Overall, this place has decent food for a chain in Elk Grove, but ultimately it has no soul."
Haley D.,"Roseville, CA",0,6,,1.0,3/3/2014,"You definitely come here for the atmosphere, not for the service or the food. Our server was Jennifer and not only was she inattentive but she wasn't friendly. She didn't smile, NOT ONCE, and was rude to my fiance when he asked a question about an item on the menu. We only saw her twice- once to take our order and again to drop off the check. The sweet girl who dropped off our food (I believe her name was Anne or Anna) was kind enough to get us napkins, silverware, and everything else we asked for. The food was alright, but my fries were cold and my burger was definitely well done when I asked for it to be medium. My fiance's pasta was extremely salty- almost inedible. Jennifer never came back around, and by the time she dropped off our check, I just wanted to leave. We paid our bill and left hungry."
Eugene C.,"Elk Grove, CA",46,65,3,2.0,12/11/2010,"Mediocre chain restaurant and brewery. The BJ's brand beers run the gamut from very light to very dark, and they are mostly OK. They aren't exactly the experimental type, and seem to lean on the side of caution as far as flavor and hoppiness are concerned. They price their in-house beers slightly cheaper than the other small selection of local/imported craft beers they have on tap (like Stella, PBR, etc.). Price is between $4-6. Food is OK, but to me are somewhat expensive (upwards of $10) for what is just your run-of-the-mill pastas and variations on hamburgers. Nothing is exceptional or unique, and everything comes across as bland. Foodies can look elsewhere. Since there isn't much else to do in Elk Grove, on the weekends they tend to be very busy. For lack of better alternative pub options, this could be about as good as you can get around here. As long as you come here with low expectations, you might be able to leave feeling something in between satisfied and disappointed."
Jenny G.,"Lodi, CA",0,23,,5.0,2/2/2013,"I don't know why the negative reviews.  The food is good... the service was good, the price is reasonable- what more do you want?  Fun place to hang out with the family."
Nancy T.,"Sacramento, CA",50,68,39,4.0,8/4/2010,"I love coming here! This is a little more expensive than i wish. But the food is pretty good.  Although i can drink alcohol, I dont at this location. I love their Rootbeer. They serve it right! Now, rootbeer should be chilled with NO ice! I love that fact. I didnt have to say hold the ice. The main reason for this place is their Pazookie! Every time i go, I try something new. I love the warm, outa the oven cookie with the cold ice cream on top. It is good to share or have it all to yourself. The servers here are also really nice. Some are good looking too! You cant complain to good food and a show.. The only down thing is that there is always a wait! Every time i go, I always have to wait at least a good 20 minute."
Jenny W.,"Elk Grove, CA",401,243,62,1.0,7/19/2010,"Food: acceptable, at times Service: horrendous, at times BJ's is one of the few places you can go to in Elk Grove for a decent happy hour or a late night meal, but I've been disappointed so many times! Most of the time, my disappointments are understandable. In one night, over half of what my table ordered was unavailable (racks of ribs, large pizza sized pans, etc) and so we all chose something else that we ended up not being happy with. My pot roast looked like dog food and tasted how I imagined dog food to taste.  I've also had really bad experiences with the service.  I once waited over 20 minutes for ranch dressing during a slow weekday lunch hour. My server finally got it for us and told us that if we asked someone else, chances were that it went in one ear and out the other because they were not in charge of our table.  Rude!  Our server was nice, but I feel like it is only because we were the ones tipping her.  Another time, I went during a happy hour with three other friends, one who was in crutches.  We were told to wait for a table to clear up and so we did.  Every server (and even a manager!) who walked by us just glanced at us, gave us the elevator eyes, and then continued walking.  NO one asked us how we were doing or said a simple greeting.  Eventually, one of the customers sitting at a table asked my friend with the crutches if he wanted a chair.  With half an hour until happy hour was over, we noticed that over 3 tables already had their credit cards waiting but no server to pick it up. When we were finally seated (with 10 minutes to spare) our server was really nice and allowed us to order off the happy hour menu (which wasn't THAT great, $1 off drinks, $2 off appetizers, 50% off mini pizzas).  Sorry BJ's, but I definitely won't be coming back if I can help it."
Stacy A.,"Sacramento, CA",62,29,30,4.0,5/1/2013,atmosphere is koo the service is great in a busy in environment
S J.,"Sacramento, CA",45,71,1,5.0,4/27/2011,BJ's (Hard to forget a name like that giggle-giggle) Best Chili EVER!!! Cheap Lunch Specials!! Delicious Salads. Unique Appetizers. Incredible Burgers. Nice variety of house-brewed Beer. Awesome and Airy atmosphere. Giant Baked Potatoes. Great for Dates and for Groups. Wonderfully light version of a Chicago-Style Deep Dish Pizza. Always Great Service!! Very Clean. Slightly overpriced for dinner but you're paying for the ambiance and your overall dining experience. This place values its customers and works hard to win your business. 5 Stars Baby!!
KM Y.,"Elk Grove, CA",51,13,96,2.0,7/22/2012,"Good food, BAD service. I normally go to Bj's after work on Saturday, with a coworker, because they're open late. But every time that we've gone the service has been horrible! The servers normally take a long time, are not very friendly, and they NEVER ask you if you need any change back and just take the change you should get back. One time in particular I asked our waitress if the pesto had nuts in it (I am allergic and told her that) she hesitantly said no, then about 10 minutes later she came back and said ""actually our pesto does have nuts in it. I didn't think pesto had nuts in it."" (DON'T SAY THAT IT DOESN'T THEN IF YOU HAVE NO IDEA!!!) Immediately after she took our order for appetizers and I ordered there stuffed mushrooms. I didn't read the description of the appetizer (that was my fault) but it just sounded good to me, apparently though the mushrooms had a ""drizzle"" of pesto all over them yet the waitress didn't say anything even though I told her more than once that I was allergic to nuts which was in the pesto. Our appetizers come out and the waitress immediately leaves (without seeing if everything looked ok) and I'm left with stuff mushrooms covered in pesto. The waitress disappeared for a long time and then finally walked past our table and I waved her down and asked her if the green stuff was pesto...she looked at me puzzled and said yeah. I told her once AGAIN that I am allergic to the nuts in the pesto and her response, with an attitude was ""well you shouldn't have ordered that then""...I was very irritated at this point  by her terrible customer service and just plain out stupidity, but I tried very hard to be patient. I asked her if they could remake it without the pesto and she tells me that she thinks they put the pesto in the stuffing (I was kind of speechless at this point because I wanted to yell at her) so I just changed my order altogether.  The whole time she never once apologized to me about almost killing me and she gave me attitude as though I was inconveniencing her. PLUS to top things off at the end of our meal she took our check and money and never came back with our change. To sum things up, I honestly think that this waitress is a serious liability if she doesn't know what's in the foods and obviously isn't paying attention to the customers who are specifying food allergies. I haven't had this bad of service here since then BUT the service hasn't got much better either."
Leah P.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,3,,1.0,2/12/2015,"I'm soooo annoyed. Their to go service completely  ruined my perfect date. We specifically called in our pizza for pickup because we had somewhere to be. We get there and we see the stupid lady gave our pizza away to someone else. Another lady goes and looks for our pizza. Obviously  it's no where to be found. She then asks the stupid lady if she gave our pizza away. She nods yes at the same time we say yes. They turn and look at us like we messed up, then have the nerve to tell us they will ring it up and then put it in. Why in the world would we pay for a pizza before the order is even put in? Stupid. We say ""forget it, we specifically called and asked if the pizza would be ready by a certain time because we have somewhere  to be."" Her mouth dropped as if we said  something that offended  her.  We were livid. We called and asked for the manager, we were on hold for it felt like forever. Finally we told the ""manager"" what had occurred and she said  ""oh, let me get the manager"" my friend said ""that's who we asked for"" and she put us on hold without even saying so. They are so unprofessional, and unorganized. Never again will i call for pick up."
Benjamin C.,"Carmichael, CA",0,7,,1.0,2/7/2014,"This place had horrible customer service, horrible food, and way to expensive for every service they provide. I would never recommend this place to even the devil. This place was disgusting in a whole."
Heather M.,"Santa Monica, CA",29,511,6,2.0,8/17/2012,I used to love this place. Operative word is used to. I don't know what's happened to this location. My burger is consistently under-cooked. Always order well-done. Frustrating. The best thing about my meal was the baked potato. The strawberry lemonade was tart tart TART - tooooo tart. Normally its delicious. I don't know - just always walkin away from BJs wishin I ate elsewhere and feelin my stomach rumble 30 min later. Wait staff is nice but not as attentive as I'd like. Refills took forever to receive as did the check. Also wish they didn't have it so uncomfortably cold in there. Oh well. Probably won't be back - and if so I won't be back to Elk Grove location.
Linda P.,"Elk Grove, CA",119,110,130,5.0,9/2/2010,"I love this place.  I have been going to this BJs for years now and really enjoy the food and drinks.  But I'm going to remember the night I came here with Charles C. (before he became my BF) the most.   It was a brisk winter night, maybe late November or early December and we came here for diner.  There was a wait for a table so we stood at the bar like a pair of vultures waiting for someone to leave.  There was some awkwardness and Charles says do you want to get a drink while we wait?  I reply, YES!!  We got a couple of Jeremiah Reds and drank those as we were waiting for a table, while playing words with friends.   We got seated and decided to get some more Jeremiah Red.  I don't even remember what we ordered to eat.  I just remember the endless pints of Jeremiah Reds and Charle's argyle hoodie.  Maybe it was fries, chicken wings, and pizza and maybe sliders.  I've had all those before and they're all really good.  Get the shoestring fries but make sure they're fresh.   I've had shitty service here in the past, but for that night it was perfect.  We closed the place down and didn't even realize we were the only customers left.  People were clearing out and only the staff were left behind, cleaning up.  And yet we weren't pressured to leave.  So every time I come back, I am always reminded of fond memories from that night."
Ashley R.,"Sacramento, CA",0,19,1,1.0,9/4/2013,"BJ's is one of my favorite places to eat. But my last visit on 09/02/2013 left me very disappointed. It was about 6pm place was really busy for Monday but it was a holiday so that was probably why. I ordered pizza both hand tossed and deep dish. Quality and appearance was nothing to brag about. I also ordered calamari, I think it must have been sitting there for awhile because by the time it was brought to our table it was greasy and cold. Waitress forgot to bring our salad. I really liked this place but I don't think I will be going there anytime soon. Quality and service really suffered that day. I was going it give this place 2 stars but after writing my review I had to change it to 1."
