Brenda L.,"Syracuse, NY",968,1930,3483,4.0,1/19/2011,Good place to get some drinks with friends b/c it opens late.  Also a good place for a birthday because it's big and there's plenty of food options.
Vince L.,"Sacramento, CA",229,605,158,2.0,1/11/2013,"We came here tonight to celebrate my daughters birthday. There were 10 of us and fortunately we made reservations. The place very busy. We started off with appetizers and was disappointed when they didn't have the fried calamari, which is why my daughter wanted to come in the first place. Once we got our order placed the food came fairly quick, for a busy night. but we didn't see our waitress again till she came back to see if we wanted desert. We never got our drinks refilled. That was a 2 hour meal. Food was OK. I got the fried jalapeno burger and thought it was a little bland. pizookies were a little off. Really flat, hard cookie that stuck to the pan and was very difficult to scrape off. My wife was really put off when she was told that she should leave an extra tip for the bartenders. What, the mandatory 17% added to the bill wasn't enough for the poor service? We also had a little ($5) promo gift card that expired  a week ago and they wouldn't take it. Ok we just spent $250, you'd think they would honor it. Well, needless to say she didn't get any extra tip. Won't be going back for awhile."
Rod W.,"Sacramento, CA",7,280,93,2.0,12/9/2012,"Almost every time I have been to BJ's on Laguna, the service is terrible. I think only once I had good service. All the waiters walk around with Blinders on and they don't pay attention when your drink is empty. Then of course they disappear. When you get your food another waiter brings it out and if you ask for something you won't get it because that isn't your waiter to begin with. I only go to BJ's if there is nothing else I can think of to eat."
Melissa D.,"Sacramento, CA",235,90,162,4.0,9/24/2008,This place is a great place to eat out with a big group of friends. If it's just 2 people then it's not as great because it's very noisy in there. So it's nice when its a bigger group because then everyone can talk as loud as they want!  Dishes to Avoid:  1.   ALL BURGERS!! Even when it's slathered with sauce the meat is still very dry and tasteless 2.   Spaghetti- I believe it was something about spaghetti romano or something like that? But it's spaghetti with marinara sauce that.... literally looks like they cooked the angel hair and then popped open a can of Ragu boiled it and poured the sauce and some seasoning on top... not very appetizing....  Dishes to try:  1.  Their pizza's! I've only tried a couple of them but they're all very good! My favorite is the BBQ chicken pizza! Their pizza's are....i  guess they're called deep dish pizza's? Verrrryyyy good!! Full of flavor and everything tastes fresh! 2.  Their Cajun Pasta! I believe that's what it's called... or is it Tuscan Pasta...? Anyways its the spicy pasta. It's absolutely Delicious! The presentation of it is rather plain but the flavor of the pasta makes up for it.  3. Their salad with the tortilla chips in it... I can't remember what it was called but it was more of a mexican salad with cilantro dressing. Very tasty and fresh.  4. Bazookie! It's basically a cookie baked in a personalized little pan with a scoop of ice cream on top. it may sound simple and a little bit plain... but everyone i know is always talking about how good it is! I agree! Overall I gave it 4 stars because it always take's forever to get seating. Also even when I do to go orders it takes a while. But the food makes up for it!
Erin W.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",0,5,,5.0,1/12/2015,"Great place for lunch or dinner! Had the avocado rolls for appetizer then individual pizzas and a s'more pzookie for dessert! Super friendly staff, very clean and great atmosphere!"
O M G.,"Sacramento, CA",9,1722,8464,4.0,8/10/2008,"We stopped in for lunch the other day after watching a movie and it hit the spot. We just felt like having some beer and appetizers and it was a perfect addition to our afternoon. It wasn't too busy that we had to wait for a table like many other times but sitting there, looking around.. the servers used to be a good looking group when they first opened. Looking around it went downhill, our server was intense and looked at us like she wanted to eat  us. But we laughed and thought maybe it's a lunch thing like at strip clubs where the not-so-great looking dancers work the day shift. I think it was more bearing on their looks because they all looked miserable or had very eager to please tension in their face..  Now, BJ's has an extensive menu. I think the pizookie is their niche and not to mention their own brews. My favorite being the Jerry Burst, a mix of the jeremiah red and berry burst cider. My only qualm that i've encountered thus far regarding their menu is that seasoned fries is an appetizer option and on the menu it says to choose crispy thin or wedges and we wanted cripsy thin and our server said.. the crispy thin fries are not seasoned, only the wedges are. SOOOOO... that made no sense to me to have that listed that way and irritated me a bit but that's that. We had the wedges. ..and I wish they had outdoor seating."
Crystal I.,"Sacramento, CA",34,9,,5.0,10/9/2012,"Every time I go here I get great customer service from the staff and the food is excellent!!! Food of the gods!!! I recommend on saving room for dessert, the pazookie!!! It's just so warm and chewy, melt in your mouth good. It also comes with ice cream so warm and cold...great combination. The price is pretty up there but worth it!"
Jonathan T.,"Elk Grove, CA",22,11,5,5.0,7/11/2010,"First of all, I give this place a guaranteed 5 stars because its one of like...what? 3 places in Elk Grove open past 11? Not including Jack In The Box *gag*....anyways... Also 5 stars because its the only place in EG that has Guinness on tap!! Thank God! The atmosphere is pretty sweet and the bartenders definitely work for their tips. At least in my experience. I really wish I would have caught the last guys name. He was a shorter guy...African-American...super chill. Anyways, if you run into him, have him hook it up with the ""chocolate rasberry"" beer! TRUST ME! I'm a huge beer geek/snob/whatever, and this layered beer just absolutely blew me away. GET IT!"
Shaina Marie W.,"Sacramento, CA",68,95,64,2.0,9/17/2014,"The staff had no idea how the dine in pre order worked we were in a rush and hoping to get things set up fast so I used Mobil app on the drive to the Elk Grove location. When we walked in the front desk person informed us she didn't know how dine in worked she needed to ask please wait in waiting area. We saw open seating in bar area so we took advantage of seating ourself. The front desk girl said she would send someone who knew how the dine in worked. We were greeted my a waitress who we informed we ordered dine in and as as well informed us she didn't get many dine in orders sat in bar area so she didn't know how it worked then asked us for drinks. A different waitress/ maybe hostess dropped of a Tab which had our dine in order on it. About 15 mins later (30 mins into waiting) a manager came by and asked for the tab (we must have looked irritated at this point). I could see him bouncing around to different POS systems and questioning a lot of the staff with our tab in hand. When he walked by with our waiter I could hear him telling her to put in a rush order. He then came to our table and informed us that our order had never been processed and he was going to give us free appetizers. He came by many times after to make sure we were taken care of and did take care of the two appetizers we had ordered through the dine in order. He was very appologetic and informed us he would be talking to his staff personally about the experience. My boyfriend hates BJ due to the fact that every location: Natomas, San Bernadino, Arden Mall And Elk Grove continuously mess up our service or order. I have to beg him to take me due to the fact I love the stuffed mushrooms and Italian dressing. I don't know how much more he will take the next bad service might break him for good :/"
Jeff B.,"Sacramento, CA",39,8,,1.0,10/6/2013,"One out of five stars. Let me explain why. My Fiance and I arrive on a Sunday night at 7:05 pm. We were seated at around 7:20. As soon as I sat down my toes were splashed with beer from a puddle that resided under our table. That was cleaned up by the hostess - which isn't her job. A few minutes later our server came out and took our orders. We wanted a lemonade and pepsi plus our entres. Over ten minutes later our server came out and said that she was going to have another server help us and immediately walked away. We still had not received our drinks at this point. The new server came out and said she would bring out our drinks right away. By the time we had them at our table it had been 20 minutes after the initial order was placed. We both sat at our table drinking and talking until we realized that a significant portion of time had passed since we had placed our order. When the substitute waitress finally approached our table it was 8:40 pm. I kid you not. She asked ""Is everything okay?"" My fiance said, ""No. We don't have our food. So nothing is okay."" The waitress seemed shocked and said that the previous waitress, who took our order, had told her that we only wanted drinks. Hahahaha who goes to BJ's and orders a pink lemonade and pepsi? So, at this point, we became very irate. We had waited over an hour to hear that our original server had never even placed our order to begin with. Serious? At this point our back up waitress gets the manager who comes out and offers to take care of the meal. He was kind and empathetic towards us. We didn't want to wait any longer so he offered $75 in gift cards. I refused them at first but he somehow convinced us to take them and apologized profusely. He even offered to box up our meals when they were ready so that we can take them home. Again, we refused this offer as we just wanted to leave.  What should have occurred is that our original waitress placed the order like she is paid to do. I'm sure it's not a hard thing to do and I'm sure she has had plenty of training in doing so. Unfortunately, that did not happen. What should have occurred next, is the sub-waitress should have said ""Oh I apologize for the wait your food is almost ready."" Instead she said, ""I was told that all you wanted was the drinks."" By saying this she had revealed that our order was never in, and we had been forgotten by the original waitress.  I spent nearly two hours for $75 worth of gift cards that expire in two months. When we left BJ's it was 8:50 pm. I gave the gift cards to the man who worked the Taco Bell drive through in Elk Grove. I figured I would get rid of any bad karma that may have caused this terrible incident and colossal waist of my time. I hope he enjoys BJ's more than we did tonight."
Leigha O.,"Sacramento, CA",5,24,1,5.0,12/20/2013,"I'm pretty picky and am almost always modifying menu items to be what I want. I gave my server a pretty complicated order and he didnt write it down, but still got it right. Impressive. Food was delicious and my salmon was cooked perfectly. Also, if you call ahead, the wait time is normally cut down by 15 min."
Ray F.,"Sacramento, CA",21,38,186,1.0,3/28/2011,"I have read many positive reviews on Yelp about their deep dish pizza, and frankly I am a bit cautious to going to have pizza at a place that specializes in beer, but beer and pizza do make a great combo, so why not, right? I love pizza and by no means a hardcore pizza connoisseur, but their deep dish pizza SHOULD NOT be called a deep dish pizza! First of all it did not even come in a dish! It was more of a puffy pillowy crust pizza! Take your average pizza and inflate the crust, Voila! BJ's deep dish pizza! it was even more absurd that the waiter informed us that in a ""deep dish pizza"" the tomato was on top! I should of told him that normally the sauce is on top and not a few pieces of tomato! I mean it wasn't a badtasting pizza, but it was definitely not a deep dish pizza. I'm going to stick with Chicago Fire or Zeldas.  This review is just on the pizza and not the beers at this establishment."
Stephanie L.,"Sacramento, CA",0,11,1,4.0,11/18/2014,"I have had good and bad experiences at this bj's. My friend and I went today for some lunchtime apps and the service was pretty good and the food was great. It was my Mommy day out (my son was at Nan Nan's). All in all, bj's is one of my favorite restaurants in town. (my fav is the parmesan chicken ;-) )"
Christopher N.,"Elk Grove, CA",169,196,146,2.0,3/29/2012,"It's a little rare that I'd eat here because of the service situation.  But upon arriving, I was in the mood for dessert and my friends were interested in the main dishes on the menu.  I had ordered the zinfandel and a dessert called ""BJ's Beignet"" which was like a donut with ice cream and whip cream and strawberries.  The food took about a little longer than usual since two tables that came in 10 minutes after us had received their food before us.  We even had to branch and reach out to one of the male servers to help find our waitress who whenever we needed her was always missing in action, and when we had gotten our food, it was cold.  Not warm, but sadly cold, but my friends didn't care, we were hungry so we just gobbled it down and the food was okay, but it would've been better at least warm.  Then we had to search again for the waitress, and finally got our check, I can't believe that it took an hour to pay to get out of there.  We got fed up and just walked our check to the front and asked for the front girl to help us take care of it.  So I'm giving this visit 2 stars because we had an okay time together, and spent 1.5 hours waiting for food and trying to pay."
Maria Z.,"Sacramento, CA",10,4,,1.0,9/14/2013,"This was worst experience at a bar that I've ever had in Florida and and in California!!! Jared waylend is the worst bartender I have ever seen, I've been a bartender before and I gave him some lee way because he was running service bar and regular bar at the same time, but he did not smile or was being friendly the whole time we were there. After waiting patiently for him to finish his service bar and helping him with a fellow patron choosing a non alcoholic beer that he didn't even know about, Jared as the guts to tell me "" you need to calm down"" when all I wanted was to cash out. The manager  Darryl  Beck was amazing. I hate to put a bad review over one bad bartender. But I, as also many of you here, like to sit at the bar and watch a good game of football. But this bar is not the place to go if Jared is on shift."
Tina T.,"Elk Grove, CA",8,88,76,2.0,5/11/2012,"When BJ's first opened in Elk Grove, food & drinks were pretty good. We go back for the pizza  occasionally but order it to go because the service is ridiculously slow.  The quality of service has declined throughout the years and there hasn't been any sign of improvements."
J L.,"Sacramento, CA",0,28,19,4.0,9/9/2012,"I'm a fan! Okay, okay. Fine. It's really more like their pazookies and drinks that keeps me coming back regularly, but their food is always descent too (mmm their yummy chicken pesto flat bread!). I've also always enjoyed their mixed drinks. Their famous strawberry splash is amazing and peach frosty is good too! I'm glad they also serve ciders. I've had their pastas, pizzas, and huge baked potatoes before but I never actually crave any those items. For a party of two, this place can actually become a bit pricey. Come in during their happy hour! Half off mini pizzas, $1.00 off well-drinks & BJ's pints, and $2.00 off appetizers."
Pippi L.,"Sacramento, CA",183,490,38,4.0,2/5/2010,"First of all, 9237 Laguna Springs Way exists too, and it's a residential neighborhood which left me scratching my head and calling people with access to a computer (and it wouldn't have helped if I'd had GPS, because I didn't originally write down ""Drive"", I wrote down ""Way.""  My own fault.)  But you won't get confused if you are coming from 99.  However, coming from I-5, you need to KEEP GOING even if your google maps says turn left. Second of all, good brown beer, dumb name.  Brewnette.  It packs a good punch, tastes rich and yeasty, without bitterness.  I even tried the pairing with Santa Fe springrolls (these are pretty crispy and tasty, but the cilantro collected in my teeth, which I don't mind, but apparently my dinner partners thought it was funny.) I tried the BBQ chicken pizza.  Eh.  It's okay.  It's filling.  The pizza ""crust"" is almost a sponge, so it's different from what you might be used to.  We tried the flat appetizer pizza with tomato and basil, and that was nice and light and crackery (better than the deep dish, in my opinion.)  If you do get one, the mini is plenty for a single eater. The standouts were the beer and the flat basil/tomato pizza.   70+ bucks for 4 people, our check was 46 bucks for two people with beers, 2 appetizers and a mini pizza.  The atmosphere is a little better than Chili's and WAY better than Red Robin, while remaining ""kid friendly"".  It's not optimal for kids, but it's good for ages 4 and older (because they can eat.) We tried to go for Happy Hour, but the place was packed at 4:45 and they don't honor the specials at their regular tables.  Ah well.  I am pleased to say I had the foresight to download two coupons for $5 off any food orders over $20, and we split the checks to take advantage of both."
Meghan M.,"Sacramento, CA",73,117,,2.0,9/14/2010,"If it weren't for the fact that the drinks and food are exceptable i would give this place a rating of ZERO... it does not matter what time of day you go the waiters and waitresses are slow and somtimes rude. If you sit at the bar you have a better chance of getting your food and beverages ina timely fashion, other wise you might as well add on an additional 15-20 to your stay to wait for your food and bill.... WOMP"
Alex R.,"Elk Grove, CA",9,6,,1.0,4/9/2014,"I'm here right now! 3 host at the front and a manager they all greeted me and when I asked for a table the just stood there it took a good minute before they replied and sat me I waited 25 mins for my server to come to me and say hello, I asked for water the water took 13 mins to get here after that we didn't see our server for about 40 mins. After waiting 40 mins she came and took our food order good is taking for ever. I don't understand how this place can suck so much! I don't think I will ever be back. Managers need to do there job better!"
