Brandon H.,Bay Area,662,266,10,2.0,2/27/2012,My chicken pasta tasted like tofu...
Mai N.,"Elk Grove, CA",86,39,8,5.0,2/23/2012,"Wahoo!!! This place is awesome! There isn't many brewery places to go to in elk grove with decent food.  Happy hours!!!!! You give this place got 3 stars average but you know you come back here all the time for happy hours. I always go here for happy hours and on the weekends for there drinks. Happy hours are from 3-7PM and 10 to closing, on weekdays. I believe its a dollar off cocktails/drafts, 2 dollars off appetizers, and half off on their mini pizzas. Man that's is a deal. Why? Because that the only thing that's it good here...Appetizers, pizzas and drinks. You can only get happy hours special inside the bar area. It's first come first serve and you seat yourself. Its pretty big. I never had to wait for too long for a table.  Appetizers: I had almost all the appetizers. My two favorite and must get appetizers are going to be the chicken lettuce wraps and the Santa Fe spring rolls. YUMMM.  The chicken lettuce wraps comes with 6 cabbage leafs, a bowl of chicken mixed with seasoning and other veggies, and two yummy sauce (I believe it's housin sauce mix and the other is wasabi cream). There so much flavors going on and I absolutely love it. You feel good eating it too because it seem like a very health dish. OhhhhMG the Santa Fe Spring rolls is stuff with avocados, cream cheese, and other garnishes, all wrapped in a wonton wrap and deep fried. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. It comes with two dipping sauce but I only use the guacamole dip. Next on my must get list would be the chicken wings. Its deep fried a toss in their sauce and drizzled with ranch and hot sauce. I usually ask for the sauce on the side because I like my wing crunchy. The wings are nice and juicy and the sauce makes the everything comes together. I usually don't eat flat bread; I like my pizza fluffy. I had flat bread pizzas once here and once at Bistro 33 in Davis; BJs' is definitely better than Bistro. Everything else is pretty decent nothing to rave about but nothing to hate on either.  The only one I wouldn't recommend is probably the calamari...no good =[ just stay away from.  Pizza: The pizza crust and dough part is really fluffy, just how I like it. Beside that nothing much of different then other places. I'm not much of a pizza fan but something about half off makes everything taste better. That's a deal. You can get full off a 4 dollar pizza. They have lots of options. My favorite is the great white. Great Alfredo sauce on a pizza...YUMMY! They're not shady with their toppings either and that is always a plus. I use to order other stuff here like pasta or even there sandwiches during the lunch special but I don't think it's worth it. I am not saying it not good; I am just saying that I can something better for cheaper elsewhere.    Drinks: This is probably the best place in Elk Grove to get drinks, chill, and have a good chat with friends and family. Drinks here are ...well the best in elk grove. They have a huge cocktail list and my favorite are the mojitos. That is my favorite drink in general but bj's makes it the best. My sister usually goes for the martinis and I feel like their martinis are really strong because she always get buzz after a drink (that usually doesn't happen). They either have really strong alcohol or they are not shady about it. They have a huge selection on draft. I am not much of a beer person, but they have the beer sampler, which give you about 1.5 pint (i think) of all there beers that the make themselves. That's 8 different beers and my brother had that for his birthday and couldn't even finish it (he is a heavy drinker).  I usually don't have problem with service here. They're all nice people. Come to check on you, refill drinks, ask us if we want anything before they give us the check ... you know all the typical stuff. Sometime they can be a little slow though. When it get busy the food takes forever to come out but its a restaurant, what can you expect.  Last thing! THEIR PIZOOKIES ARE HELLLLLLLLLA BOMB!! I usually only get the original chocolate chip and vanilla bean. Its so good. The cookie is nice soft and warm, while the ice cream is creamy and cold. All together, it's like heaven in my mouth!! And you get it for free if it's your birthday! YAYYYY!"
Misty J.,"Elk Grove, CA",12,7,,1.0,2/28/2014,"Lost reservations twice. Talked to manager, promised table in 5-10. Wait time over 45 minutes."
randy o.,"Elk Grove, CA",21,7,,2.0,7/7/2013,"Okay, first off the food is very good at BJ's.  They have a problem with a certain weekend manager though.  We go there for their weekend brunch very often.  The last two Sundays the food took way too long.  Today, we asked to see the manager, Brandon, and the waiter came back and said that the manager refused to come talk to us because ""everyone's food is taking a long time today.""  We finally got our breakfast after about 40 minutes and it was good.  Then the manager comes and talks to us, apologizing for the slow service.  He then proceeded to talk with other customers with the same story:  they didn't have enough people on duty this weekend.  What?  The place is always full on Saturdays and Sundays.  Why wouldn't they be adequately staffed today? The other problem is that their hosts and hostesses do not greet you with a smile or a welcome.  They look like they would rather be anywhere else than the restaurant.  Bad or slow service is not typical for BJ's but rude hosts and hostesses are always par for the course.  I actually get the feeling when I walk in that they are annoyed that another customer has arrived.  NOT a good idea for the first persons you see when you walk into a restaurant."
Andrew S.,"Elk Grove, CA",14,20,,4.0,11/17/2013,Food was great our server was very friendly best pizza I had by far will come again soon.
tre c.,"Sacramento, CA",2,14,297,3.0,12/19/2010,"Dinner for 2. We ordered a full slab of baby back ribs. It came out dry w/ hardly any BBQ sauce, so had to ask them to bring for more sauce, on the side. Fully loaded baked potato- I remembered it was bigger than this, now it's gotten a tad bit smaller. Fettuccine alfredo, which, didn't taste good because you could only taste the broccoli, which was overpowering. Couldn't taste the creamy alfredo sauce, so took a few forkfuls and put it in the to-go box.  I could cook it better! What happened to the quality of the food there? Went downhill.. Boo, I won't be craving for you like I used to."
Jess G.,"San Jose, CA",42,178,16,4.0,7/18/2010,"This is a really nice place, it's so big and the staff is very accommodating. Most of the time when my friends and I come here it's always in a really big group so the staff is really nice about putting a whole bunch of tables together for us. Only sometimes when we call ahead to tell them how big the group is, we still end up waiting for the tables when we arrive.  The food is so delicious! The pizzas where are chicago deep dish and it's really good. the bread is very thick and chewy. It's so GU-UHD that a few times I just come here to get pizza to go, driving past other pizzerias. I also really enjoy the baked potatoes. they are so big it's like radioactive size or something genetically mutated to be so big! It's enough for a meal not a side. They even have a large variety of different baked potatoes too. One time i had an Alfredo Baked Potato and it was full of mouth watering goodness. There was everything you would find in Alfredo Noodles in A POTATO! BRILLIANT! The Roasted Chicken here is so enormous. my friend that we call the blackhole could barely finish it is was so big. There was also a lot of flavor and it was extremely juicy! And the Pazookies here are AWESOME!  ice cream, check! cookie, check! Assembled together, O ....M....G.... yummy! I have a bit of a sweet tooth so the chocolate cookie and ice cream with chocolate fudge was super delicious! This is definitely a great place to come to again and again for hang outs."
Brian Y.,"Lodi, CA",1,21,,1.0,8/15/2014,"Real poor service, ordered 2 beers and it took 15 minutes.  I had to go to the bar and ask if they were brewing the beers."
Leila J.,"Sacramento, CA",0,5,,3.0,9/20/2013,"I like BJs, I mean it's has a nice atmosphere and I only go there with a big group of friends, for bday parties and whatnot, but they're a bit overpriced.  The food is alright, kind of typical American meals.  Nothing really stands out.  I love their lemonade and flatbreads though!  Anyway, I appreciate their effort in providing good customer service, but the wait time and prices don't make up for it. Sorry!"
Shreena L.,"Elk Grove, CA",16,20,6,1.0,3/26/2012,"I love BJ's just not this one; every time i order pizza here I have to send it back because it always COLD !!!!  IDK how many times we have to talk to the manager because of cold Pizza, Getting appetizers when the entree comes out... seriously get it together"
Dana J.,"Sacramento, CA",6,57,15,5.0,10/16/2010,Oh my gosh! I have found the perfect pizza! Seriously the crust was to die for It seemed very fluffy and spongy i just loved it. I got the mini pizza as part of the lighter option on the menu. All i can say is BJ's i will return to eat your pizza! 5 stars because everytime i go the service is always fast and fun. One thing.. My mom ordered the Texas crispy chicken steak thing.. She hated it.. I did too. Eww. Of course the pizookie is delish you just have to try it!
Connie S.,"Sacramento, CA",24,36,39,3.0,9/8/2012,"If you come at the right time, there could be as little as a five minute wait time but when you come during rush hour, you might die of starvation! Though the wait time may be quite long, I can't help that I love BBQ chicken pizza and pizookies. They now offer wheat crust for their pizzas! Personally, I try to eat healthy so this makes me love their pizzas even more! I'm a sucker for their oreo pizookie. It sucks that you can't buy oreo cookie dough at the store or else I would just make my own. Nothing fanacy about it but I just love, love, love everything oreo. The service here is decent, but it can be hard to catch a waiter at times. The food also comes out quite slow. My pizza never comes out sizzling hot but that's okay because I don't like to eat my pizza hot. Great place for big parties or even if you just want to casually come in and grab a bite!"
Veronica R.,"Elk Grove, CA",70,20,6,4.0,8/10/2012,Food is great. We pretty much always grab a booth in the bar when we go to Bjs or a table there. My mom had the blackened salmon salad and she loved it. I had the bottomless soup and salad which was awesome because I didn't know it was bottomless. The server was ok... She checked on us every once in a while and seemed like she was in a hurry when she did. When she finally came I felt like I had to say what I wanted really fast. What really annoyed me was when I told her I had a Bjs rewards number and she brought me a sign up card. I checked my account online when I left and I didn't see the points so I had to call the customer service line. Obviously I'll go back because BJs has great food and drinks but hopefully we'll get a different server next time.
Lisa C.,"Elk Grove, CA",2,10,,3.0,4/1/2013,Tonight was good but it's been better when I've been in. Service was a bit slow and the wraps were great as usual.
Yves J S.,"Sacramento, CA",96,280,42,4.0,1/1/2010,"Pretty consistent to the other BJ's I've visited. The staff was pretty cool and playful, and the food is always good. We called in advance since we had about 12 people arriving for dinner before a night of partying. It was busy as always, but the service was still quick with our food and drinks. Games playing everywhere, the restaurant was clean, people and crowd seemed friendly.    Beer... mmm different beer.... mmmm lots of beer..... oh! shot! ...shotsssss."
Shannel G.,"Round Lake, IL",39,179,16,4.0,4/16/2010,"Great service. Very friendly. Big restaurant, good for groups or just parties of two. Cheap and tasty food. Good size portions. Lunch specials are delicious, and the prices are hard to beat. I enjoyed the grilled shrimp tacos. There was a splash of some water on the ground, and a staff member wiped it away a split second after I noticed it. I like that."
Christine H.,"Sacramento, CA",284,230,4,4.0,6/7/2012,"Anything I order I am satisfied with...  Some of my favorites are the fish tacos, tomato bisque soup, club flat bread pizza, black and bleu burger, great white pizza only to name a few.  Best deals are their luncheon specials...  They have a variety of great beers and you can never leave without having a pizzookie."
Sissy T.,"Sacramento, CA",0,268,186,3.0,4/14/2010,It's okay.....   Better than chilis is about all I can say.. Lunch menu is fairly priced!
Muffin X.,"Rocklin, CA",7,18,34,2.0,10/22/2012,Waitress was busy and not polite. Food took a long time for it to arrive. Finally after about 40 mins. Food arrived warm and not steaming hot. Fries were soggy and not crispy at all. Grill chicken sandwich were awful not fresh at all. Was attempted to complain but the table in front of us were already doing so and returned a couple plates of food. Was too hungry to wait for another 40 minutes for replacement.  We decided not to and just ate some of the food and vowed not to come back.
Candace Y.,"Elk Grove, CA",83,395,486,4.0,7/23/2007,"I normally shy away from corporate brewery restaurants if I can help it.   I much prefer to give my business to independent  brewpubs that are locally owned.   This time, though, we were running out of options.   We had a  couple of out-of-country visitors that we wanted to have dinner with.  It was getting close to 9PM on a midweek evening.  Lots of other options that I'd had in mind close at 9PM.   Then, the bf suggested that we try BJ's.   it was close, and they stay open serving dinner until later than 9PM. It turned out to be a good suggestion. I was surprised at the number of people out for dinner late or out for a beer  on a Wednesday night.   The place was hopping!   I was a little concerned that it might be too noisy for dinner conversation.  Somehow, that turned out to not be a problem.   Not sure why, because the ambient room noise level was really loud. One of us had a mini-pizza, one had a dinner salad with shrimp added, one had a shrimp pasta dish. Me, I had the meatloaf.   i was feeling in a basic food sorta mood. Everyone  enjoyed their meal.  the food tasted pretty good! Table service was fast and friendly.  Portion size was pretty generous.   My meal came with cooked veggies, 3 thick slabs of meatloaf, and mashed potatoes.  I also had ordered a small dinner salad to go with it.  The lettuce was fresh, crisp, and not watery.  the blue cheese dressing was nice and not overly gooey. (I took my leftover meatloaf and had enough to pack 2 lunches for work the next couple of days.) Much to my surprise, I'd definitely go back here to eat with a group of friends.    Next time, though, i will have to try the beer, root or otherwise!"
