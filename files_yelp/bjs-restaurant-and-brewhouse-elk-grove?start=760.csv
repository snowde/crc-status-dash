Les C.,"Folsom, CA",0,13,6,5.0,5/27/2013,Quick service and great food.  Love the Pork Chops
Matthias M.,"Elk Grove, CA",29,5,,1.0,7/7/2013,"I just ordered the chicken and rib dinner takeout.  Totally gross chicken.  Burnt on the outside and RAW on the inside.  Tough but 'ok' ribs,  Cold french fries.  Good Slaw,  Good Cornbread.  So for $21.38 (really?) you cannot get it right?  I called the store to complain to the manager and was placed on hold for over ten minutes.  Sorry folks, never again."
Charles C.,"Sacramento, CA",88,44,69,4.0,3/23/2010,I took my soon to be girlfriend here  for one of our first dates. Our Server Joel was awesome. He tended to our every need. We stayed way longer than we should have but didn't feel pressured to leave. In fact we were there so long that when we finally decided to go we realized that there was no one else left in the place.   We like the Jeremiah Red and had way too many glasses of it and were pretty buzzed by the end of the night. We had our first kiss that night... though she does not really remember. Hahahaha. .
Beau C.,"Henderson, NV",1571,327,201,1.0,8/24/2013,"yeah, what can i say. server was great but food just plain sucked. they burned the bun on my sandwich, put bell peppers on it and the fries tasted like fish. really, someone explain to the chef to just toast another bun, dont serve the burned one, it kinda screws up the sandwich. i think since i have been going to bjs this is the worst meal at any bjs i have ever had. first and last time we will dine at the elk grove, ca location. to add injury to insult...or is it injury to insult...whatever....someone change the tv to a baseball game about 15 mins into the meal. next time will just sit at the bar and drink hefe....wait....oh yeah, wont be a next time here...."
Tony L.,"Elk Grove, CA",1,119,,4.0,2/19/2013,"Stopped by on a monday night for late happy hour. Place was dead. Only the bar had people. The waitress was nice and very attentive.  Mini pizzas were $5 and they had a brat with fries for $4. Fries were a little cold but everything else was good. I'm not really a fan of their beer. I haven't found one I crave. They don't taste fresh to me and for the price of a pint, I rather drink their belgium beers out of the bottle. I just to come here on the Friday and Saturday night and it would be a mad house. But times has changed I guess."
Nguyet K.,"West Sacramento, CA",129,342,611,3.0,5/8/2010,"I came here for dinner with my friends last night, we had about 15 people.  The service was friendly, but only okay. We were seated by 7pm. The hostess seated our group at the wrong table. Then we had to move after we just got seated. When our waitress came around soon after we were seated to take our drink order. But she didn't come by again to take our food orders.  It didn't matter at the moment because everyone was busy catching up. Later when our waitress bought food to half our party and the half I was seated at was skipped, I was a little upset.  We finally place our orders and when we got our food, the other friends were done eating.  However, the food and portion size was good.  I been to this BJs before and got better service before. I would give BJs another try."
David A.,"Fort Polk, LA",0,12,1,5.0,11/3/2012,"Love this place! Here working for a few months in the Sacramento area and this has become the Wednesday Happy Hour spot for me. Danielle, Allegra and Gary are the best! Everything on the menu is outstanding. Can't recommend this place enough. Gonna miss it when I have to leave in a few weeks."
Arielle S.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,19,3,4.0,7/13/2014,"A little slow service at the bar, but it was a sunday night. Good food and drinks, would come back again!"
Kenneth C.,"Elk Grove, CA",190,21,2,4.0,2/27/2012,"They've got literally everything you can think of within their 14 chapter menu, so it's hard to go wrong when you choose BJ's to dine.  I think the service is completely dependent on what time you choose to go in;  regular lunch and dinner service is nice and consistent (although it can seem a bit scripted, like they have a standard scripted training program or something), but the late night service can be hit or miss.  I work nearby, and the coworkers love to come here and hang out after a long shift.  Tables in the bar area can be scarce, and it can sometimes take awhile for a server to even notice they had been seated again amidst the crowd.  It's hard to tell who's your server and who isn't, but when we're finally greeted, at least its with a smile.  Cant beat the late-night happy hour prices!"
Genea E.,"Sacramento, CA",128,20,,3.0,8/28/2012,Food was so so. Tasted like it'd been prepped the day before. The natomas location iskuch better.
Raquel R.,"Woodland, CA",26,10,1,5.0,1/9/2013,"Great service! Great food! Definitely need to try the stuffed mushrooms and the no-virgin root beer float. Both were recommended by our server, both were delicious!"
Sandi G.,"Sacramento, CA",0,1,,2.0,1/12/2014,Our experience was poor. I order a garden burger and was served a turkey burger. We requested ice tea and it came without sugar or lemon. We requested bbq sauce for my husband's burger. He was finished with his meal by the time the sauce arrived. The server did not discount our bill. Maybe next time the service will be better.
Lisa A.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,80,,4.0,8/12/2012,"I have been to this BJ'S quite a few times, and have never been disappointed.  Today is no different.  We had an exceptional server, Denise, and the food and appetizers were, as usual delish!! The prices are pretty reasonable, and I love the lunch special menu, they have a lot to choose from. I definately would recommend this place, and will definately be back! There is no comparison to TGIF, BJ's wins.....hands down !"
Darren M.,"Sacramento, CA",92,507,35,5.0,11/1/2009,"SOO much better than surrounding BJ's .  as always delicious !! can't say too much more , calzones rock me !"
Johnny C.,"San Francisco, CA",5,33,1,3.0,7/24/2012,"Avoid the fried calamari, unless you like cold, tough squid. Wish they would put fries and onion rings on the menu, but that would probably turn out cold and stale too.   I would have given 1 star, but the bartenders are really friendly and I love the beer."
J L.,"Sacramento, CA",62,62,28,1.0,11/9/2011,When there on a Monday night..it wasn't that busy..the service is horrible and the food was nasty...I had the chicken lettuce appetizer it was soooo salty...my husband had the NY strips and he didn't even finish it...they use to be really good..what happen???? Guess I'll stick with Texas RH on Calvin rd
David B.,"Woodbridge, CA",2,46,,1.0,12/28/2011,"What happened to this restaraunt? BJs was a place that was not cheap but a decent value. Along with the new menu came a significant price increase. I enjoyed BJs because it was consistent, not exceptional but I got what I paid for. Now, not so much. Our last visit amounted to 3 barely warm entrees, cold fries and no refills until asked for. Our bill was over $50 before tip, not a good value. Sayonara BJs, it was nice while it lasted."
Kay S.,"Chicago, IL",10,72,3,3.0,3/8/2010,"This place is always packed - it doesn't matter which day of the week! The food is good with respectable portions; beers are great! Definitely worth at least a visit. Enjoyed and recommend: pumpkin ale (seasonal), country fried steak, meatloaf, chicken parmesean, mac & cheese, clam chowder, pizzas, and bruchetta appetizer."
Robert S.,"Sacramento, CA",68,35,2,3.0,3/31/2012,"I ate here twice in the past week or two. I got the fish and chips both times. Very tasty. Unfortunately the rest of the experience was kind of disappointing. The first time I went was on a saturday night, they were incredibly busy so it took a good 10-15 minutes to be seated. Fair enough, it was a saturday night. The girl at the front desk was hardly friendly though. The food was good enough to get me to come back and try it again. I went back less than a week later to have the fish and chips . This time it was a weeknight, and somehow even though the restaurant wasn't packed like it was the on the weekend, there were plenty of problems. We weren't greeted by the girl at the front desk (a different girl from the other night) for about two minutes, while we stood there waiting. It took another few minutes after she finally acknowledge us, to be seated. She was running around trying to find seats and seating others. She told us that they only had one busser on. After we ordered and our appetizers arrived, we realized that they hand't given us silverware or napkins. So we waited for a good 5 minutes before we could get the attention of our server and ask for silverware/napkins, while our food was sitting there getting cold. Our server was not the problem. She was obviously overwhelmed and did her best to give us good service. It appeared like the place was understaffed. There was however more than one busser on, despite what we were told and you could see other tables getting impatient as well, stopping the bussers for help, for their checks, etc. The table behind us couldn't find their server either. I can say that the fish and chips, stuffed mushrooms, and crispy won tons were all very tasty. They seemed pretty understaffed and overwhelmed which didn't create a very good experience for the customer. If the service was better, I woud have easily given at least four stars, but it was not, twice."
Hannah P.,"Elk Grove, CA",35,59,,4.0,8/7/2011,"Props for the good food, but I am not a huge fan of the expensive prices and the long wait sometimes. My 2 best friends and I go dining here once every 2 months since one of them is obsessed with the pizookie dessert. Oh yeah, sometimes we get lucky to get seated in less than half an hour (like yesterday, we were able to get a seat as soon as we walk in). I've had only cocktail drinks so far and they were pretty weak, but next time I'll try their beer because after all it is a brewhouse. Service is pretty decent, except that yesterday my friend was had dirty, unwashed forks that he had to take back (ewww!) I LOVE getting stuffed mushrooms and fried artichokes. Then sometimes I'll get an entree if I'm in the mood for it. As far as desserts, I like the peanut butter pizookie, but I sure LOVE the baked strawberry beignet. It's like heaven in your mouth!"
