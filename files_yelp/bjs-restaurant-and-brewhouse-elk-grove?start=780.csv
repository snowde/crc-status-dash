Tim M.,"Sacramento, CA",53,21,,2.0,7/12/2011,I love the food here but the service licks my mud butt.  Because residents of Elk Grove have nothing better to do expect your evening trip to BJ's to be full of waiting.  Waiting for a table... waiting for a waiter... waiting for your water/beverage refill...  waiting for the check.  Why so many people flock to BJ's when there are far superior restaurants (locally owned and not chains) is beyond me.  Even on off random nights like a tuesday night you can find yourself waiting 45 minutes to an hour for a table.  If you do go I recommend the grilled chicken pasta.  If you have a sweet tooth you can never go wrong with a pazooki.  Its raw unprotected impregnable sex in a pan!
Jaime F.,"Sacramento, CA",264,79,,5.0,5/17/2011,"I don't hand out five stars like I hand out BJ's (hahahhah get it?) but I can't help it in this instance since BJ's has become what I like to call my ""default place"" here in Sac.   A default place is simply that place you go to when you don't know where else to go and don't want to spend an hour Yelping to find a new place that may have wilted lettuce and a snarky gay server.  The place must have a decent beer selection, a menu big enough to please everyone in the party, have consistently tasty food and passable service.  BJ's has all of these things along with a drink menu offering a variety of over priced yet curiously tempting cocktails, such as their in-house made root beer with Captain Morgan and a dollop of whip cream.  Fuck yes.  Does it cost, like, 20 bucks to order one of these cocktails? Yes, but what do you expect?  It's a brewhouse, don't be like me and order a vodka soda at two in the afternoon.  From 11-3 you can get awesome specials on food, beer and cocktails.  Go during these hours if you don't want to spend too much.  They're also always happy to let you sample their vast beer selection.  BJ's isn't something notably special; it's not innovative or creative, it's not fusion anything, it's American fare with a million page menu and a good variety of pizzas.  Their appetizer menu, while not cohesive in any sense, is always good and offers an interesting variety.  You can get a plate of Ahi tuna set next to a plate of nachos set next to pot stickers set next to basket of chicken strips underneath a deep dish pizza.  You can get a Maui glazed pork chop (delicious) or a giant burger, a plate of pasta, a turkey club, mini tacos, a bowl of chili in a bread bowl, mac and cheese etc, etc.  Everything is decent, nothing ever sucks, and that's why this is a default place.  I often skim the reviews before I write my own and I noticed a lot of Yelpers talking shit about the service, claiming they had to wait, or their servers messed up or OMG THEY WERE OUT OF SOMETHING.  I've never had a bad experience with the service and while I have had an instance when they were out of something, I don't hold it against them because, like, they're a restaurant and have customers and sometimes whoever is doing the ordering for products in the kitchen may not know a party of 600 is going to come in and all order pork chops.  There menu has 78 pages, order a fucking pizza if you can't get your pork chop and try not to cry about it.  A default place is important, it's a necessary staple when you enjoy dining out and a simple solution when no one can agree or nobody knows what they want. That is why BJ's gets five stars.  They've delivered a service that other restaurants in town can't do.  They've facilitated an easy out, a chance to avoid disagreement and complication by saying, ""lets just go to BJ's."""
Jennifer T.,"Sacramento, CA",2,54,4,4.0,9/7/2009,"I usually go to this place if I'm craving for of their pizzas, beers, baked potatoes, and parmesean crusted chicken...yumm =) The pasta is alright...sometimes it's very good and sometimes it's just really dry. The spaghetti is usually always good though. I think the service really depends on if you're eating with a party or not. When I eat here with my bf, the waiters are usually attentive and friendly. When I eat here with parties...whole different story. It's like the larger the party the crappier the service, but what can I say? Most restaurants are like that I guess.  And you have to try the pazookies! Ice cream and warm cookies go so well! And if you're not a dessert person, then they have a pretty large selection of beers and alcohol."
Jason C.,"Elk Grove, CA",9,63,24,3.0,6/4/2009,"Probably one of the few big chain restaurants that I enjoy going to. Friendly staff and good drinks. If you decide to go on a Friday or Saturday night get there early as the wait tends to be a long one and the bar seating fills up fast. The food, while not amazing does taste good and is a good compliment to a pitcher or three of Blonde with some friends. P.S. I must say that I was disappointed to find out that none of the beer is actually brewed on site. The giant stills are just for show."
Angelica L.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,3,,4.0,7/2/2010,"The best atmosphere around, very nice feel about the place. Excellent service, friendly waiters. My favorite dishes are the deep dish mediterranean pizza & the bbq chicken pizza, fettuccine alfredo was also good, but the pizzas are the best here. Strawberry lemonade & root beer are alright as well, very authentic taste. Overall, a very good experience. I'd love to go back!"
Mike L.,"Sacramento, CA",153,94,51,3.0,4/1/2013,"Quick hint:  If you want better service, sit at the bar area.  Not only do you get happy hour discounts, but the service is waaaaaaaaaaay better.  I can't say that all the service down in regular seating is all bad, but I've had at least 3 times where the service was incredibly horrible.  Two of those times, I saw people seated after my table, get service and food and pay their bill before mine even received our food (same server).  I'm really not one to complain either as this is a pretty busy establishment, but on those two occasions I had to say something and in the nicest way possible.  The managers handled the situations professionally and offered appetizers, desserts and even cut the bill in half, which was really nice of them, and another reason why I come back.  But it really shouldn't happen this many times.  I love the food here and their beers are pretty good also, just the service makes me second guess coming, well actually, I pretty much only sit at the bar seating only now.  So if I had to rate the food, it'd be 4 stars.  The bar service is 5 stars.  The regular seating service 2 stars, it averages out to about 3.5 (I know I'm Asian, but I pretty much suck at math).  I come back for the food and beer (happy hour)."
Frankie C.,"Sacramento, CA",46,24,,5.0,4/22/2012,"I've been going here for years now. It is definitely one of my favorite restaurants to eat at and I never leave disappointed. Every time I go here, the service is always great. Sometimes I would get take out from here since they are open til pretty late, and even the service is great with that. The spinach stuffed mushrooms are delicious. I would normally order those for appetizers, as well as the seared ahi bites. My favorites are the classic ribeye steak and the baby back pork ribs. Both are outstanding, even though they may be a bit pricey. I've also had their BJ's Favorite Pizza, which is wonderful. And can't forget their chocolate chip pizookie. Those are amazing. I am always going to be back here. This is one of my go to spots."
Anji W.,"San Francisco, CA",785,202,1755,4.0,11/30/2011,This is a good hangout place of course. A great pig out and get buzzed place with sports on.
M. A.,"Kapolei, HI",0,12,,3.0,8/21/2009,"BJ's is one of those chains that if you've never been to one, you might as well go check it out. There always seems to be a wait when we drive by this place. They do supply a lot of parking, only thing is that you'll work up an appetite just trying to walk back to the restuarant. Service is generally good. The food is decent, nothing I would call extraordinary. I think what makes this place special is all the beers they have on tap. My first time there, I asked the waitress what beer would go well with my dish and she ended up brining this guy who asked my a whole bunch of questions about my beer preferences. They eventually brought me 3 different types of beer to sample (they were all pretty good) and the one I ended up picking did go well with my food. I am sorry for not remembering the name. Mind you, they could of just said ""Bud light"" and I would've been fine drinking that with my food.  But that was an interesting experience, something I was not expecting. Would I recommend? Yes, but only if you've never been to one, I would recommend just trying once. Would I go again? Been there twice, I think I'm good."
K K.,"Sacramento, CA",106,38,12,5.0,1/13/2012,"Love my late date night here, specially on Mondays night...white peach mojito..yummers. oh and don't forget the mini appetizers."
Kamni G.,"Jacksonville, FL",364,358,160,4.0,9/23/2009,"Whether its a quick bite and drinks at the bar or a birthday dinner, BJ's is a great place. This location is always packed but I have never had a huge wait. I loved their beer sampler, and their burgers. It is a Sports Bar also so you can watch your games here. The pookies they have are way big but oh so yummy!"
James N.,"Sacramento, CA",7,75,9,4.0,2/4/2012,"The best things about the restaurant is the pizza, appetizers, and drinks.  Everything else I can care less about.  My favorite pizza is the buffalo chicken pizza.  It is seriously my favorite pizza in the whole wide world.  The crust is light, soft and buttery.  The crust makes the pizza.  Without it, the pizza become mediocre."
Andrew K.,"Carmichael, CA",39,7,1,1.0,2/4/2013,"I ordered the Pot Roast dinner. It was supposed to come with Oven roasted vegetables.. Veg was raw, their idea of ""oven roasted"" is throwing 1/4 of an onion on a burner to get charred and then onto the plate... Carrots/celery straight from the refrigerator.. Very disappointing."
James L.,"San Francisco, CA",106,181,62,4.0,2/12/2009,"I had dinner here with a couple of friends last week. It was so slow that we were getting all the attention. Not that I'm complaining, it's a good thing. We got everything we wanted and the food was great. My friend spilled her to-go coffee as soon as she walked out. Then you guys got her a new one free of charge. What a service!"
Michelle N.,"Stanton, CA",649,156,260,4.0,4/3/2011,"I deducted one star from this place because sometimes the wait for tables, waitress/ waiters, or food is just a little bit long.  An appetizer I would suggest is the avocado rolls.  It's delicious!  Most of the pizza are pretty good too.  Also, usually the waitress and waiters are pretty nice and friendly! Next time I want to try the sliders.  :)"
Tyler A.,"Galt, CA",32,107,35,5.0,12/8/2010,This place is great!! The menu is huge and has all sorts of different dishes. The beer here is great. I'm sure one of their brews will impress everybody. only downer is sometimes the wait is long.
Larry H.,"Elk Grove, CA",96,45,,5.0,4/30/2011,"This place is  !!! It might be busy at times, but hey great food takes awhile to prepare.  I came here with some old friends and they were catholic and it was there last day of leach.  Meaning they couldn't eat meat and I could :).  Therefore, I teased them ordering a bbq rib sandwich with fries and chicken fettuccine pasta.  Of course I didn't finish it because they both were big, which made me surprise for their price.  Price for dinner is reasonable and there quantity of food were huge!  Best pasta/Alfredo and more!"
Stan G.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,7,,4.0,7/8/2012,"We go to BJ's 8-10 times a year and always enjoy the food.  Service is normally good.  The problem I have is We bought $600 worth of gift certificates for Xmas.  As an enticement, BJs offered some mugs and free certificates.  Little did I know those free certificates expired in February.  We have been there several times since we bought the certs, but forgot to bring the free certs.  Today we finally remember to bring the certs and are told they expired.  Pretty poor policy in my opinion UPDATE: Manager's customer service is superb.  I previously  taught customer service skills to employees and am happy to say BJ's excelled at a basic principle.  They realized a mistake was made and immediately contacted me to apologize and sent me a new  certificate that more than compensates for the certificates I surrendered.  I am sure this was used as a learning experience for the wait staff and I look forward to my next visit.  Thank you to one of the best eateries in Elk Grove."
Lynsey C.,"San Francisco, CA",291,117,,4.0,1/12/2009,"Normally I'm not a fan of  big chain restaurants, but BJ's blows all those feelings away (no overly sexual pun intended).  My roommates used to drag me to the San Jose location when I lived in Campbell. I never really got excited about it but it was next to the movie theater and they had delicious beer so I let it happen. I went to this Elk Grove location with my dad over the weekend to grab a quick lunch and watch part of the Charger game. We sat at the bar and ordered up drinks. My dad had a bloody mary and I enjoyed one of their Hefewizen's. His mary was delicious and spicy, he practically drank it one gulp he loved it so much. My beer was ice cold and served with a smile. We scored seats right in front of their gigantic flat screen which was AWESOME for watching the game. My dad ordered the Italian Chop Salad and it was huge! He couldn't even finish it and my dad is a big dude (6'7"") ! I decided to switch it up and NOT go with what they are famous for (chicago style pizza). I ordered their wedge salad and mahi mahi tacos. The salad was fresh and crisp. The tacos were delightfully tasty and sweet. I would have liked more spice, but I always say that. I was kind of bummed that the guacamole/avocado sauce (not sure which it was) appeared to be poured out of a bottle. Overall, loved my lunch, our bartenders were attentive, speedy and friendly and the ambiance was great for catching the Sunday play-off game. I'll be back when I'm in town."
Steve E.,"Elk Grove, CA",9,87,,3.0,9/1/2009,"Let's begin this review by correcting a misnomer.  While the BJ's chain uses the word ""Brewhouse"" in their name, they do their actual brewing in separate breweries, not in their restaurants.  Given all the big-screen TVs tuned to 24-hour sports channels on the walls, a more accurate name would be ""Restaurant/Sports Bar.""  Now on to the Elk Grove BJ's. AMBIANCE:  If I had to give it a name, I would call BJ's décor Industrial Revolution Moderne, featuring exposed A/C ducting overhead, large Leninesque murals of the type that depict the workingman's struggle against capitalistic oppression, and neo-impressionistic art filling the gaps in the walls between the murals and big-screen TVs.  I can't say what sort of mood BJ's decorators were trying to achieve with this style, but I did feel an overwhelming urge to shout ""Do dna"" every time I picked up my glass.  I will give the designers credit, however, for utilizing enough sound deadening to lower the typical sports bar rowdiness to a mild roar so it's possible to carry on a normal conversation at your table. FOOD:  BJ's menu is substantial, and once you get past five pages of beer, wine and cocktail options, plus two pages of appetizers, your lunch/dinner choices run the gamut from relatively healthy (veggie dishes, salads and the promise of a gluten-free menu in the future) to such an overwhelming selection of calorie-laden, cholesterol-infused dishes that you can feel your arteries hardening just reading the choices. Variety abounds among the selections of appetizers, deep-dish pizzas, burgers, sandwiches, and specialties.  There's something here that just about everyone will enjoy.  And the food is good--without exception, everything I've eaten at the Elk Grove BJ's has been tasty.  Try the Texas-Style Chicken Fried Steak (under Brewhouse Favorites) with white cheddar mashed potatoes.  It might do you in, but you'll die happy! For a chain, the level of preparation and the quality of ingredients are surprisingly high.  Prices are also on the high side, but given the food quality and hearty portions, most will agree that BJ's offers fair value for your dollars. SERVICE:  The quality of service at BJ's is similar to their menu--there is a lot of variety.  As with most chains, there seems to be inconsistency in the way corporate training and service criteria are observed.  You may get good service or you may have to remind your server several times to refill your water glass or bring a needed condiment.  Given the pretty decent chow BJ's serves up, a little more emphasis on efficient, friendly service would earn them a four-star rating. Be aware that the Elk Grove BJ's is a popular joint, so timing is everything.  For lunch, show up by 11:30 a.m. or be prepared for a wait.  For dinner...well, just be prepared for a wait. TIP:  Guys, if you take a date to BJ's, don't let all those flickering big-screen TVs distract you.  Women are seldom flattered when you appear more interested in the MLB highlights than you are in them."
