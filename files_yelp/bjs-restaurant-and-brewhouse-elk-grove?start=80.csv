Val N.,"Sacramento, CA",18,4,,1.0,9/15/2017,"Horrible horrible horrible, waited over an hour to be seated and found out they forgot about our party!! Ridiculous, unprofessional, inconsiderate!"
Susan J.,"Rio Vista, CA",0,3,,5.0,10/4/2017,"My friend and I had a wonderful lunch at the Elk Grove BJ's.  We usually go to the Brentwood location and this one was hands down so much better!  Our server, Mary, was very attentive and on the ball.  She took the time to help me download a coupon on my phone.  She even offered red pepper and cheese for my pizza!  That has never happened before.  The food was great.  The wedge salads had plenty of cheese, bacon and dressing.  Also the lettuce was fresh and crisp.  My personal pizza had lots of cheese, tomatoes, and sausage.  And the half price wine on Tuesday was very nice!!   Thank you to Mary and the staff at BJ's for a great lunch!!!"
Jen E.,"Chico, CA",0,11,,4.0,6/2/2017,Great beer selection. Food is really good but just barely overpriced.  Would recommend for after work or late night option. Would not recommend to go at all.
Capital S.,"Davis, CA",0,10,2,3.0,10/2/2017,"A fair and decent meal at BJ's, service was polite as always but the wait time was unbearable."
Marie H.,"Elk Grove, CA",67,4,7,1.0,8/31/2017,"Unfortunately I have to give a star to right a review. This is the second time coming here. Just left the bar seating area. First time was a disappointment and I will never come here again. The service we got was unacceptable. We ordered our dessert to-go, we paid our tab and waited for a half hour for our dessert. The waitress kept informing us it was ""coming out.""  After hunting her down again she informed us that the dessert was never charged and that they could give us a dessert next time for free. Sorry there won't be a next time. Put your pizookie where the sun don't shine.  The first time I came with my little girl the waiter completely ignored my and had to wait 10 minutes just to get some damn ketchup for my daughter.   Spend your money someplace else!"
John G.,"Elk Grove, CA",65,3,,1.0,9/27/2017,"Plan on ordering online? Don't bother. Ordered an hour in advance. Made us wait 30 minutes for food after arriving to pick it up. I'm not sure if they're just overwhelmed, or incompetent, but this is a great way to never have your customers return. What's worse than waiting 30 minutes? Waiting 30 minutes and not having everything in the bag after leaving. Food died in the car. Pizza was soggy. Ice cream was melted. Horrible. Will never return. Incompetence."
Melinda W.,"Upper Lake, CA",52,12,6,2.0,9/16/2017,"I made the mistake of ordering breakfast here today. I got 2 eggs over med, with link sausage and hash browns. The eggs and potatoes were ok, the sausage was flavorless. the sourdough toast was not toast.  But the real bummer was the service. Our waiter didn't bother to give anybody silverware or napkins. We had to request those items. Not going back, especially in the morning.."
Daniel N.,"Twentynine Palms, CA",169,4,,2.0,10/2/2017,"I'm going to hit on 3 key things  1. Attitude 2. Food quality  3. Effort  Now as soon as you walk in you are greeted with the standard ""Hello"" and staff helps you get seated,  I sat at the Bar.  Bartender was great, took 2 mins to get to me and got my drink and order taken care with easy. So 5 stars so far.  Food comes out, looks great. Ordered the Rib eyed steak, medium rare, with asparagus and mash potatoes. When I check it to see how well it was cooked, it seemed alittle too rare. I checked the edge, but when I checked the middle it seemed to have only been lightly seared on each side.   So 2.5 stars for that, and mash potatoes were bland.  When I told the bartender about my steak, she quickly had them try to fix it, but you can't really fix Steak that way, but I appreciate the effort. So 3 stars .  The employees from where I was sitting at the edge of the bar were very loud and ranting about customers, I would just recommend they take that to the back or tone it down, I Bartend so I get the frustration but some other customer might now. I probably won't make this my first stop or even top 5 when looking for a good meal in Elk Grove but if you just want mediocre then it works for a quick bite and drink."
T W.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",101,29,532,1.0,1/24/2017,Hannah is the worst server! She slammed our soda on the table and  asked if we wanted to order a bday pizookie. Really? It's supposed to be complimentary. No? Celebratory pizookie without a candle came out! This has to be the worst celebration here. Bright side is the mojito was fabulous!
Michelle L.,"Elk Grove, CA",1,34,8,3.0,9/4/2017,"Attention to detail doesn't seem to be a strong point for this location. My ice tea glass was empty for about 10 minutes. Also, I ordered double sides for my entree and instead of bringing the salad with the meal they gave one to me and one to my guest. So my entree showed up all by its lonesome self. The place was maybe 65% full so it wasn't crazy busy."
Paul C.,"Sacramento, CA",8,37,4,3.0,8/22/2017,Been here multiple times like how they have different specials on certain days. Came here one night and got a full deep dish pizza for half price and the pizza was decent. Had their brew sampler where they let you try I believe 4 or 5 of their house beers and the ones I picked were good. Service was also good but had a few times where they took a little to long to serve us and give us the bill.
Yenisei A.,"Elk Grove, CA",54,55,135,2.0,2/8/2017,"They have recently been changing the menu and have gotten rid of a lot of my favorite items.  the food doesnt seem to taste as good anymore and service is average.  As a family, we stopped going to BJ's because there nothing special about this place."
Ray S.,"Sacramento, CA",74,3,,1.0,11/12/2017,Got to BJ's at 8:30 pm and didn't leave until 11:45pm.... spent 30 minutes eating and 2 hours and 45 minutes waiting on their service.
Mandy L.,"Santa Clara, CA",396,176,438,4.0,11/23/2015,So many new items added onto the menu since I've last been here (months and months ago.)  Definitely recommend the Baked Beignet. Warm cinnamon sugar bun clashes perfectly perfect with vanilla ice cream and fresh strawberries n cream. Less calories than a pazookie? I think so. Salivating as I think of how to introduce to you their Tomato Bisque Soup with (Garlic) Sourdough Bread Bowl. Just get it!
Ryan S.,"Pittsburg, CA",2,52,9,5.0,8/22/2017,Had the Bison burger and artichoke hearts. Food was good and fresh. Would recommend this place to anyone looking for good grub in Elk Grove. Four stars.
Tony H.,"Curtis Park, Sacramento, CA",33,8,,1.0,7/4/2017,"Me and my group of friends had a bad experience..  First off, we get there and waited like 10 minutes to be seated because they took forever cleaning a table. We sat down and our waitress did not come to us until approximately 10 mins or so. They finally came, we ordered drinks and got it in 5 mins. Then they came and asked if we were ready, we said yes. We ordered everything we wanted but the wait time was superrrrrrrrrrrr long! We waited for almost 45 mins! Our waitress Danielle kept going away for so long and never stopped at our table to relieve us by saying that they are working on our food. My GF ordered an appetizer and it never came until our entrees came. Also the food quality was bad, although the flavor was okay. There were some food that was hard, not steamed long enough, not cooked enough, some were dry as well. My friend never got a side dish that she asked for. The waitress says okay and goes to the back and makes us wait 10 mins and then tells us that there were no more of that side dish.. We didn't feel like complaining and waiting longer for our food so we said no more and ordered dessert. Dessert actually came out in a quick and timely manner, presentation was nice, quality and taste was on point. Of course we didn't tip them.. dreadful.  Ps.. people that came after us got their food first.... smhhhhhh"
Carrie S.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,44,22,2.0,9/15/2017,"Ordered the lemon thyme chicken, Nashville chicken sandwich, and burger, to go. Lemon thyme chicken had no sauce on it, barely any rice, chicken was over cooked and sandwich was totally dry.  Ordered a side salad, they sent a half a small container of dressing."
William L.,"Sacramento, CA",1740,1257,9441,3.0,9/29/2015,"You know, I've been to BJ's at Elk Grove many times for the past 5-6 years, so I got a chance to write this review for now. As a customer dining here at Elk Grove BJ's, I was satisfied for their experiences and honesty for me. I was such an honor for making me a great customer. Located near the Highway 99 entrance at Laguna Blvd, BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse delivers all kinds of food and drinks from specialty entrees (ie. pizzas and signature dishes), finest beer and wine selections, the well known popular dessert Pizookie, and many more. As I entered, the atmosphere is quite large for this lone building, so you can have great dining pleasures here as well as the bartender side too. The concept remains the same as most BJ's restaurants do across the U.S. The employees for this BJ's are doing a great job as I welcome there. The bartenders, hosts, and servers are maintaining the customers very well for recommendations, orders, and the quality of the food or drinks. So far, no cons at all. For the lunch entree, I ordered the Lemon Thyme Chicken which this plate contains one seasoned chicken breast with sauteed vegetables and fresh mild salsa on top over brown rice. As I ate it, it tasted very good! The chicken breast cooked perfectly well and eatable as well as their vegetables and salsa too. Their Lemon Thyme Chicken presentation looked much better than the Arden or Roseville location. Not a bad complete meal at all. Additionally, I also ordered the Chocolate Chip Chunk Pizookie which it's free for purchasing an order of $9.95 or more for today's exclusive offer on 9/29/2015. So far, that Pizookie is incredibly awesome! I can feel the baked chocolate chip cookie dough very smooth and elegant. The two scooped vanilla ice cream on top also tasted good too. What a great Pizookie. There's some good amount of parking available, so you can park anywhere near or far without the hassles. In the end, BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse in Elk Grove is the finest, and nearly better BJ's restaurant that I've ever dined. Perfect for happy hour pleasures and friends/family gathering. My rating: 3 1/2 stars."
Misty T.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",268,141,215,3.0,7/31/2017,"My friends and I decided to go here for dinner on a Thursday. Never had a problem with BJs and I'm actually a fan of the chain. However this location was a mess that night. We got there and there were quite a few people waiting. My friend asked how long the wait would be and they told us 25 minutes. Okay! Cool! No problem. But no. We waited for an hour. Because it was busy, we didn't want to rush them but once we noticed people who got there after us were getting seated, it was time to speak up. So the story goes, someone else took our table who had a ""similar name."" Similar, not the same. They never announced the name and believe me, we were actively listening because we were so hungry and anxious to eat. So Im guessing someone went to the counter and they just assumed. I don't know. After the hostess told us that, they seated us shortly after. We ordered two chicken parmesan chickens and ribs with asparagus -- no appetizers. We waited another 45 minutes for our food to come out. Speaking about just my food, my broccoli was under cooked and my potatoes were cold; only the chicken was warm. After, we ate. We were so done. We've been there for so long and the service was eh. I completely understand the service was eh because it was busy but, I don't think I'll be back any time soon. I hate leaving these type of reviews but it wasn't a great experience. Sorry :("
Deniece B.,"Stockton, CA",119,263,85,1.0,6/2/2017,Fuck BJ's in Elk Grove! They fucked up my entire night. First my queso dip was cold and then my mahi-mahi tacos were missing the fish! The waitress tried to say it was hiding under the cabbage. That plate came looking disgusting. Horrible horrible horrible!
