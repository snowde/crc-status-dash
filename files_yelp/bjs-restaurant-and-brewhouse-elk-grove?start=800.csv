Richard W.,"Elk Grove, CA",47,10,,4.0,1/8/2011,"This is always the place to go for birthdays or gatherings, it seems, for Elk Grove.  I won't bore you with a full review because I'm sure there are enough reviews here to give you the grand picture.  I recommend coming here for the happy hour specials with savings on beer, pizza, appetizers, and probably a bit more than I'm forgetting.  A full on dinner can get expensive here, so just be prepared.   At least the servings are a good size so most will get full (and have a little extra for a midnight snack)."
Robert M.,"Elk Grove, CA",3,3,,4.0,3/18/2012,"Make sure to call ahead even on slow nights. The fish and chips are quite good, and the drink selection is exceptional, but one of the main specialties is their pizza and you have to get it at least once."
Charles S.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,5,2,1.0,3/26/2014,"My family and I have been to BJ's off Laguna Blvd numerous times and the service has always consistently bad or it might just be our luck. 3 or our last 4 visit have been just flat out bad, mainly the service.  Before I go into our most recent experience I just want to say the food has always been good and I have no issues with that.  My family and I went to BJ's on Monday, March 24, 2014 wasn't to busy we, we were seated right away after almost 15 minutes we left.  Reasons why; after 13 mins we had no water, no service, no hi, not even a ""I'll be with you in just a moment""!!  After walking up to the hostess asking for water my wife decided that she wanted to leave. We went to Mimi's across the street, Mimi's!!!  Do to the bad service, we made the decision not to return to the BJ's on Laguna Blvd, we will go to other BJs but not that one. Its a shame to have a good product with bad service especially in Elk Grove since there are only a handful of franchise restaurants in the area.  I can not continue to eat at a place with bad service!  I really hate to talk negatively about  people who are out earning a living and maybe its not the individual more then its the training methods of BJs. The turnover ratio must be high because I always see different servers."
M C.,"Glendora, CA",96,51,39,4.0,8/7/2011,"Late night happy hour!! Sun-thurs 10-12 I believe... Get here early though because seating gets filled quickly most of the time (no matter what day it is!). Being in elk grove u are limited to places to go for drinks at night ( either bj's, friday's, applebee's or bull wings) and this is probably the place my friends and I like to go to best. So the happy hour deal is half off mini pizzas, $2 off appetizers and $1 off drinks and pints.  The best deal is for the mini pizzas so sometimes I come here just for that! It may seem small ( 5""ish) but being deep dish, it is pretty fulfilling! My favorite is the BBQ chicken which comes with chicken, cilantro, red onions and a wonderful BBQ sauce. Mmmm! Don't forget to get red chili flakes and Parmesan to finish off the pizza!  The appetizers are ok, I've probably tried all of them from the numerous amount of times I've been there. A good thing about bj's is that they change their menu every so often (3 months or so..) so it doesn't get TOO boring. I like the buffalo wings (xtra celery please!) and the artichoke dip. The avocado eggrolls are yummy because they come with this great, sweet honey-like dipping sauce. I rarely eat their actual entrees here but I have had the Cajun pasta and I must say it is pretty tasty with just the right amount of kick to it! Lastly, you can't forget the pazookie! My favorite is the original chocolate chip pazookie but they have a couple different ones now (white chocolate chip, chocolate cookie with chocolate chip and red velvet). Red velvet?!! I think this is the latest addition so my friends and I had to try it! Tried it and Eh.... Not good! The cookie was super super thin to the point where it feels like we were working extra hard trying to scrape the cookie off the bottom while the ice cream was melting away on us. Not ordering that again. For drinks you should try the Jerryburst! It is my favorite drink there which is a mixture of their berry burst cider plus their Jeremiah red. I was introduced to this a couple months ago by my friend and ever since then I havent ordered anything else! It's semi-fruity due to the cider but it is also packed with a good amount of alcohol due to the Jeremiah red. Must try!"
Anonymous A.,"San Jose, CA",0,8,11,1.0,5/31/2012,"I feel like this place is always a hit and miss. Sometimes there's good service; sometimes there isn't. I've been here plenty of times and usually its always packed around dinner.  I went here for my birthday and we were seated pretty fast right next to the door. We were then greeted by our waiter and he was really friendly. Then all the sudden another man came and switched places with him without the first server knowing!  He then took our order and we mentioned that there was a birthday. So he kindly grabbed us our drinks. Then another girl came out with the pazookie. She was super RUDE (blonde haired girl). We told her our food didn't come out yet. She didn't care; then slammed the pazookie on the table and said ""well happy birthday"" and walked away.  The waiter then came back several times to check on us. We wondered why our food why was taking so long but didn't ask. He then came back with the check!! We asked him where was our food. He said ""oh so you guys do wanna eat here?"" we told him he had already taken our order. He was surprised and realized it was in his pocket but didn't say anything. He then told us to wait and it will be out shortly. We paid for our drinks and left immediately. No TIPS."
Jessica S.,"Sacramento, CA",46,154,,4.0,1/16/2009,"I don't put BJ's in the same category as other chain restaurants (like Chile's, Friday's, etc.) because I think the food is way better.  Their french fries are batter dipped, so they are extra crunchy and flavorful. With ranch... pure heaven. Their pizza is really, really good also (they butter the pan so it's all flaky). My meal of choice is to start out with the fries and then share a pizza with my b/f.  I also really like their beer. They're pretty mild and easy to drink.  The one downside is that getting a full meal, with drinks, can be pretty pricey. And another downside is that my ex works at the Natomas one... which is why we frequent EG!"
Kristen L.,"Manhattan, KS",111,200,23,3.0,9/7/2008,"I really do enjoy BJ's restaurant BUT this one in particular makes me dread the place. I'm not sure why this one is always so crowded. The one next to the Roseville Galleria never has such long waits just to be seated, and... it's by a huge mall. The pizza is always amazing, as are the desserts, but expect to wait a ridiculously long time for them. The staff here is slow, and has the tendency to disappear when you need anything, especially a refill."
Antonio A.,"Elk Grove, CA",15,22,,3.0,2/16/2012,This is a good place with a good variety of food. The prices are decent. We always go BJs because its open pretty late and the only place around Elk Grove thats good to eat really late at night. Get a beer here too while your at it.
Brittney C.,"Clearfield, UT",4,43,,3.0,11/12/2010,Food is a lil pricey. Love their rootbeer :) Staff has always been very nice.
Bruce W.,"San Francisco, CA",56,160,10,1.0,10/28/2010,"I kinda knew this place was bad so all I had was tea, all they had was Lipton, The tea was $2.55, My friend just got Coffee, that was $2.00, I guess I pay more because I get to prepare it myself...oh fun got one refill in the whole hour and a half we were there. Anyways my other friend had chili and salad, the chili looked bad he said it was no better than canned stuff. He also got a salad with bleu cheese dressing, It was disgusting, it seems like they put sugar in the dressing. Also there isn't any complimentary bread on anything here, and their home brewed beers suck. Pretty bad service and horrid food."
Joshuana P.,"Sacramento, CA",78,16,1,4.0,9/8/2011,"Their deep dish pizza is awesome. Great place for family dining, good prices on the food and drinks. Will definitely go again :-P"
Dianna G.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,18,,1.0,2/25/2015,"I don't recommend BJ's for breakfast l - why they took on breakfast is beyond me.  Their menu selection for breakfast is ""sparse"".  Mid-February we decided impromptu to go out to breakfast. Many of the breakfast places had a wait time of half hour minimum so on another lark, I thought maybe good time to check out BJ's and see what their breakfast is all about. My first observation was how empty the parking lot was so I was pumped that - yay - it's all good now.  The entire experience was disjointed. It took ten minutes to take our order and another ten minutes just to have the juice served &  HALF hour for the breakfast to be served. The gal delivering just plopped the plates on the table and didn't ask if any thing else might be needed.  The potatoes were ""mushy"" and I heard the couple in booth behind us comment that their potatoes were served ""cold"".  Come payment time, I also asked to speak with the manager, who I believe name was Lee.  I had observed earlier that he was momentarily checking the sport that was on the tv, which normally wouldn't have caught my attention.  However, I would be darn sure my patrons were being accommodated b4 ever taking that step. Remember, the place was not busy so it would have taken just moments to do a quik sweep to see how the customers were doing.  As I told him about our disappointment in the various aspects, and even mentioned, overhearing the folks in booth behind us expressing their dissatisfaction, I thought for sure that would have prompted him to take a few steps and just act as if he was checking on his own how they were doing.  That didn't occur.  That really made me question his interest  in the customers.  I am a patron of BJ's other times of the day, but breakfast will not occur again, ever.  With an overall 3 star review of this location, it causes me to question whether the management is monitoring the YELP reviews or any other avenue of reviews.  I think that would be time well worth spent!"
Pam R.,"Portland, OR",2,27,,3.0,10/20/2009,"This is a fun place to get a decent meal for large families and parties.  You can come like you are and find something for everyone at a reasonable price on the very large menu.  But you won't find innovative and gourmet cooking here.   This chain restaurant has a mega-scale trendiness with an over-scale building entrance, furnishings, tableware and TV screens for sports.  The atmosphere is clean, orderly and warm but a bit too dark to clearly see your food.     With reservations, the wait was very short.  Most of the items from the huge menu were tasty and the kids were happy with plenty of offerings to please them.  However, I did find the Mexican salad mediocre; the flavors were mild and good but it was dominated by shreds of thin-cut corn chips.  There are a number of draft beers that were pleasing. The kids of all ages enjoyed the cookie pizza piled high with ice cream.   We requested a mix of different flavors and they gladly obliged.      Service was good and high chairs were brought out immediately when we were seated.  We were a fairly large party and the hostess came right out with a time limit to linger after we were ready for the bill.  Although she was rightly motivated to seat those waiting, it seemed a bit rude to push us out. Over all, the experience was positive and we will return -- probably at a time where we will feel less rushed."
cheng a.,"Sacramento, CA",67,28,,2.0,5/12/2011,Bj's food what can i say mediocre at best salty on some food no flavor on some and just over all eck. But best beer and cider around town but can't beat Rubicon in DT.
Carrie H.,"Manteca, CA",20,59,13,1.0,9/12/2012,"I went here yesterday for an order to go.  I called it in and was told that my order woudl take 20 minutes which was reasonable, I was in a bit of a hurry but figured i could wait for the 20 mins.  I arrive at the curbside to go, call in and tell them that I'm waiting outside, I'm about 5 mins early at this point.  The girl on the phone tells me we are just waiting for the pizza which will be out any minute.  5 minutes later a girl comes out helping another customer and takes my money and says she will be right back with my order. 15 minutes later she comes back with a pizza box, a cup of soup, asks me what type of soup I had ordered, said she had the wrong one and she needed to get the correct soup......NO BAG, NO SILVERWARE??????? It looked like she had picked up someone's leftovers and brought it to me.  She came back with the correct soup and when I asked her where the silverware was she had a blank stare and said oh you wanted silverware???????? It's a To Go order! Unprofessional presentation, unprofessional staff and I tried to actually call and complain or at least give the manager a heads up but after holding for the manager for 10 minutes I gave up."
Cat T.,"Sacramento, CA",6,72,2,3.0,3/16/2009,"BJ's has the best pizza around, but be prepared for a very long wait especially on friday and saturday evenings. Generally atleast 30 minutes-an hour at times. It can get very loud since it is so crowded and everyone is seated so close to each other. My favorite is the bbq chicken! I only come here for pizza and drinks. I don't really think their other menu items are worth it. Their crust is delicious!"
Gayle P.,"Winter Park, FL",8,30,,3.0,11/4/2011,"Ok, here goes... First, go early or on off- peak times to any BJs. The wait time is awful during ""normal"" dining hours. Most of the staff is very accommodating. I've been visiting this chain for a while and some of my favorite entrees are no longer on the menu. If you ask nicely, they'll make it for you anyway. As another reviewer commented, the service is hit and miss. The hospitality industry tends to have a high turn-over rate, and many great servers move on to other opportunities. For the time being, beg to sit in Christine's section. She is very upbeat, without being annoyingly chipper. She is very efficient, anticipates your needs, offers suggestions based on past orders, and remembers your name. DO NOT recommend Sean!!! Curt, short, assuming, smart-aleck who forgets you're there as soon as he drops the check. Marlon's also nice...easy on the eyes and knows the ropes.  All in all, decent place. Clean restrooms, generally friendly staff, rockin' desserts, and better operating hours than most places in the area."
Mark D.,"Elk Grove, CA",4,20,,2.0,8/21/2011,I got alfredo and fettucini and I think they forgot the alfredo. There was a hint of it. The chicken was half burned. I ordered the grilled not blackened. My wife got a tuna appetizer and it was ver salty..... Don't think I'll go back again..
Huyen teresa N.,"Elk Grove, CA",34,53,,3.0,6/17/2011,My husband and I like their pizza.  Our favorite pizza is the BBQ chicken and I ordered extra sun dried tomatoes.  I love their berry berry margarita over ice (One of the best margaritas I've tasted ever).  Their happy hour starts at 10pm but the price is not all that great so this would not be my pick for happy hour but I do love the idea that if we need a late night happy hour that we can count on BJ's to be open for us.  The food is good here but it does get too pricey so we only go here once in a while.
ian s.,"Elk Grove, CA",2,9,,5.0,10/15/2011,"Hi There, I just came back from lunch at BJ's with my family  and another family. The service was awesome: Kudos to Jason and the rest of the staff at BJ's. All the food was cooked to order and tasted great.  I highly recommend going to BJ's in Elk Grove to satisfy your food craving. Cheers, Ian"
