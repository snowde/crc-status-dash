Tyler M.,"Daly City, CA",122,215,237,2.0,1/14/2011,"I honestly don't see what the big deal is about BJ's?  The service is extremely slow, the food is mediocre and it's so loud.  The only good thing about this place is the beer and full bar seeing that I only go here to catch up with friends and have a drink.  Nothing else, really.  The food has never been good at a BJ's restaurant i've been to leaving me to give them 2 of 5 stars."
Mark Z.,"Sacramento, CA",1,62,4,4.0,7/30/2012,"pros:  great food, reasonable prices cons:  had one bad waitress out of 5+ visits, don't take reservations unless you have a party of 10 or more. Highly recommend the Parmesan Chicken dinner or sandwich, pazookie dessert, Blonde Beer, and any of the pizzas."
Harold N.,"Elk Grove, CA",118,13,18,3.0,5/17/2011,Call ahead seating cut our wait time way down to just 35 min! Yeah! Went on a Saturday for dinner. Entire restaurant was out of pepperoni for pizzas and calzones. They forgot my wives hamburger sauce. They brought my son the wrong dessert bot he ate it anyhow. My calzone seemed smallish. God was prompt and tasted great over all.
Sambo C.,"Sacramento, CA",251,111,123,4.0,1/18/2011,"They have good portions and the service is really good. Once I ordered this pesto dish. They don't have pesto as a pasta, only as a sauce. Upon my request, they served a dish of pasta with broccoli and chicken with a side of pesto, which I was grateful for. They're famous for their pazookie which I have yet to try. I like this place. Good atmosphere, kinda pricey, good food, and great service."
Dawn T.,"Sacramento, CA",1,3,,1.0,12/8/2013,"Today, December 8th, I ordered food to go. I placed an order online for boneless wings. You pick the flavor so I chose garlic parmesan. I got them and they were plain. I called to complain and was told that they don't toss them because they don't want them to get soggy. Instead I got some garlic sauce but no parmesan. It would have been nice if they note it on the web. We also got a full order of ribs but they forgot to give us the baked potato. I'm not ordering from there anymore."
Cheryl P.,"Riverside, CA",1,16,,2.0,12/8/2013,Food is average but the service leaves a lot to be desired. We had finished eating our appetizer by the time our drinks arrived and the waitress arrived to take our order. By lunch time they had run out of the advertised holiday dessert:(
Eddy B.,"Sacramento, CA",247,15,,4.0,3/6/2011,"Always a good spot to eat and/ or have a beer. I usually stick with the pizza's at this spot, they are excellent. The wait time is usually not that bad either for being as busy as it is."
David L.,"Sacramento, CA",3,15,,2.0,8/11/2008,"Every single day I pretty much drive pass BJ's and I see so much people here and wonder ""Why?"" I've been to BJ's twice now and my first impression of the place was that it has a nice interior and that was it. I first came here with my folks when it was their grand opening. Ordered and waited for something that wasn't worth waiting. The food was distasteful for all of us, it wasn't anything unusual it was just not delightful for our tasting.  So it has been around 2 years since I've last visited BJ's and since my last visit was during their grand opening I've thought maybe they caught on to their distasteful food and decided to change chefs or at least their recipes. So I'm back here at BJ's now, this time for my friends 21st birthday. All of us just started to enjoy the night, drinking ourselves to happiness. Then we ordered some food, I ordered the California grilled chicken sandwich. When our food finally arrived the waitress yells out ""California burger!"" and not realizing it that was my order. So I had to chase her back for the California grilled chicken sandwich and not the ""California burger"".  When I took a bite out of my sandwich I almost gaged, not because of the effect of the alcohol because I know I didn't drank much. Wow! nightmares just came and haunted me from the first time I was here, I think I'm scarred for life. Don't come to BJ's expecting good food, it is a brewery restaurant so I was wrong to judge their food when I should be looking at their drinks. ~Forget what you heard, want to go somewhere good? Yelp it up!~"
Racquel L.,"Crockett, CA",121,30,3,3.0,6/8/2008,"We went there for my niece's birthday on a Sunday night and the place was pretty packed, but not to a point where we had to wait too long to be seated. Our waitress - sorry, I forget her name - was really friendly and curteous.  Our drinks and appetizers came out pretty fast.  We didn't have enough utensils and small plates for everyone so we asked for add'l ones but never got them.  It wasn't our waitress' fault b/c we asked the busboy for them, so... Our food came sporadically but they were hot and presented well.  HOWEVER, after getting about 1/8th through my Jambalaya, I chewed on something hard and when I took it out of my mouth, I freaked out and almost threw up because it looked like a piece of someone's acrylic nail!!!  To my dismay, I had to inform our waitress and she summoned the manager right away. The manager took my plate and came back a few minutes later to inform me that it wasn't someone's nail - thank God b/c if it was, w/ my OCD, I would've stuck my finger down my throat and gargled with clorox for days! It was however, a piece of those plastic ties and still unacceptable.  He offered me another plate and would make sure he'd put a rush on it. Oh, I had the melon/cantaloupe martini and I'm pretty sure they forgot to put the alcohol in it ;-) Overall, the experience was ok, the food is better than TGIF and/or Chili's (read my review on Chili's too!)."
Jeff J.,"San Jose, CA",221,488,226,3.0,11/23/2012,"I stopped in for lunch during a business trip.  It was empty at 11, but filled up very quickly.  I got a chicken tenders (nuggets) appetizer, which was pretty standard.  It was interesting that the waiter made a point to say he'd never seen that sauce before-- if he hadn't said anything, I wouldn't have known anything was wrong.  I tried the southern fried chicken, which was surprisingly inexpensive, even for lunch.  I quickly understood why.  The portion is tiny!  Each element was good though.  The chicken was crispy, the gravy wasn't heavy, and I really wanted more of the yummy corn and red pepper succotash.  I wasn't too hungry later, but my colleague kept harping on how good the pizookie was.  Yes, it was great.  But, it was a warm cookie + ice cream.  It's hard to mess that up.  And it certainly shouldn't cost $5.  So, at the end of the day, it was an enjoyable meal, small portions, and so-so value."
Reisha A.,"Sacramento, CA",126,8,,1.0,8/21/2011,"Pretty sure we were just racially profiled @ BJ's in Elk Grove. They sat all the black ppl in the back corner... While all the white ppl got the booths in the middle. In fact, the only black person that didn't get sent to the ""black hole"" sat at the bar with his white girlfriend. I'm not racist and ANYONE who walked into that BJ's could have seen what was going on."
Jimbo G.,"Elk Grove, CA",10,21,3,2.0,3/31/2010,"Nomenclature is tricky business, but this placed picked a winner of a name. Too bad the table service is lacking. I've tried to give this place a fighting chance but each time I've gone there, they've blown it. (No pun intended) More than once have I received the wrong order or cold food. That's just not a good sign when having to wait for 30 minutes just to be seated and then having to wait another 30 minutes to eat after ordering. BJ's could be good if they could get the table service right. Maybe they should change their slogan to ""Where the customer comes first!"" then maybe they might start getting it right."
Alex S.,"San Jose, CA",205,96,,2.0,1/4/2009,"Bottom Line: Great ambiance and cool decor. Food and beer was good and servings plentiful. Table Service leaves much to be desired. Positives: -Bar was solid. Good selection alcohol as well as TVs to pass the time -Bar Staff was solid.  -Wait was not bad for as packed as the place was -Hostess and Server were friendly and honest through and through. Negatives:  - Hostess seated us 3 guys with a male waiter. If it's 3 guys out, give us a female waitress.  - Forgetful Server IE  1) Asked server that the mini pizza to be brought out as an appetizer first. This didn't happen. We ended up getting our entrees without the mini pizza there.  Server had completely forgotten it.  2) We decided to not have the mini-pizza at all (kitchen hadn't even started making it) with the server confirming it would not be charged. It ended up being on our bill. We had to ask to get it removed."
Kara B.,"Sacramento, CA",353,521,739,3.0,8/23/2007,"Came here with a good friend to commiserate (warning- not a good place to get your talk on - LOUD, LOUD place - music and patrons) after trying to get to Buckhorn's in midtown . . wtf? ... they close at 10pm - on a Saturday?  I thought Sac (at least the grid) was getting over the closing-up-early nonsense?  So we decided, that since it was late and we wanted to drink a bit too, we would go somewhere near her house and ended up at BJ's  . . . Right on! - 10:30pm, in the middle of suburban hell (this is the Elk Grove location), and the place was packed!  They are open until 1:00am Thurs- Sat and 12:00am Sun-Wed .. . now that's more like it! The service was very friendly, maybe a little too friendly.  As the service was slow, I don't know if it was due to the chatty server or if it was something beyond his control.   My complaints: Our pizza came before our appetizer. When our pizza arrived, we didn't have any dishes on which to eat . . .and yes, this is a knife n' fork kind of pizza (deep dish), so we sat there salivating over the pizza we couldn't eat . . just picking off a few toppings here and there until the plates arrived. No prices listed on the cocktail portion of the menu . . and the server didn't know the prices either (guess they don't want to pay the extra moolah to update that novel of a menu?). Service was Slooooow - albeit friendly My likes: Pretty damn good chips and salsa - tri-colored chips with a chipoltle flavored, tasty salsa (that they supposedly make fresh themselves, everyday). The combo-style pizza was pretty good too; we added roasted garlic My friend loved her Midori Sour I, of course ordered a glass of wine . . . and not only was it a FULL pour, it was filled practically to the rim. And this was in a nice sized wine glass, not those little tulip glasses . . (two glasses for the price of one). I was a happy girl. I would try again because their menu is huge and - another glass of wine please - Thanks!"
Dan S.,"Walnut Creek, CA",17,108,11,4.0,1/22/2009,"Dropped in for lunch and was pleasantly surprised. The fish tacos were tasty and filling, and the chips and salsa were good. The guacamole accompanying them was too creamy homogenous, like it'd been through a blender, but tasted fine. Had a very good Pale Ale there (no free refills, though). The ambience was a bit loud, but otherwise professional and appropriate. And our waiter was extraordinary. He knew the nuances of some of the dishes when we asked, and kept the soda refills for the table coming at an appropriate pace - without our asking or hinting. Clearly well trained and performing his job at a high level, he made us certain that the food would be high quality as well. The cost for our lunches was very reasonable, as well. I'd easily go there again. Well done food and service."
KiKi W.,"Sacramento, CA",0,80,6,2.0,12/10/2010,"I'm not a huge BJ's fan.  I don't get why it's always so crowded.  Anyway, last week, I ventured here and I don't know what the deal was but I think something was wrong with our waitress.  She couldn't remember things within 2 seconds of walking away from our table, she took forever delivering our food, and forever bringing refills.  Every time we saw her, she was speed-walking past our table like she was on a mission, but I never saw her actually doing anything.  As for the food, it was okay.  I ordered a pizookie to go and the cookie was burnt. :-|  I wasn't a fan to begin with and I'm definitely still not a fan."
TRACY R.,"Sacramento, CA",584,680,856,1.0,8/2/2010,"Every time I venture out of Sacramento down town to eat in Elk Grove; why am I always horribly disappointed? BJ's Restaurant on a Sunday was fairly busy (probably because it's one of the only decent restaurants/bars in that area). I met up with a girl friend to catch up over a couple of drinks since she lives in that area. It's a good thing I didn't try to have a proper dinner, because people were outside waiting for a table just to be seated. We waited near the bar until a patron left and quickly took their seats. We ordered two Salty Dogs, which just tasted watered down, so minus one star. We ordered chicken wings and sausage flat bread to share. The chicken wings were pretty tasty. It came with a sweet and sour sauce and ranch sauce. We ran out of both sauces and tried to flag down the waitress for a refill, which she never returned with, so minus another star. The flat bread was pretty good as well; with a great balance of cheese and sausage. The ambiance of the place was ghetto; so minus another star. There definitely wasn't a diverse type of crowd that down town attracts. Imagine going to a family restaurant where all you see are males age 25-35 dressed like rappers wearing baggy pants, baseball caps, tennis shoes (Air Force Ones or Jordan's), and either a white t shirt or jersey. If you're not a rapper, then dress your age!!! Definitely NOT the place to go if you're looking for single males. Plus, they probably have bay bay kids with one or two baby mamas. I give this place only one star since the only good thing about it was the chicken wings and the flat bread. But everything else was whack! Service, drinks, ambiance, and the type of crowd this place attracts; all minus stars."
Lili Z.,"Elk Grove, CA",13,103,,4.0,8/3/2012,"The first time, I went to BJ's was on Tuesday the 31st. I always drive right by BJ's and I never even attempt to go in and try it. SMH. I know lame. lol. Boyfriend says this place is pretty good place to go eat. I was like ok. But isn't BJ's kinda pricy tho. He was like ya, but I am paying, and we are going. I was like but, come on you spoil me too much. Oh well so he took me there it was a lot of fun. The waiters and waitresses are very friendly, and helpful. Yes, the prices are quite pricy. But the food that we got was good. The dessert I got was the shit. It's called the pizooki. I think that's how you spell it lol. But seriously that dessert is mouth watering! The bill came out to be 45$. 2 appetizers, 2 drinks, 2 lunch specials and 1 item to go, and a dessert. The only complaint I have is my Margarita was like almost 10 bucks.... oooh kinda pricy but it was a good one  tho. So I suppose worth the money lol sooooooo verdict is: I like BJ's I want try to the pasta here tho. I love pasta. lol. Pricy but I want give it a try."
Jiong L.,"Sacramento, CA",14,54,25,5.0,11/19/2012,"Came here last night with a party of 16 people for my birthday, and they were able to make us fit, yay! Only thing was, I couldn't reserve the time I wanted to, so I had to change the time from 6pm to 5pm; an hour early, no biggie. But I was very impressed with the service, because before I decided on coming here, I read the reviews here about the service, and most people weren't a fan of the service, but our server was attentive, and he came to check up on us regularly, and kept our glasses full. Our food also came out quick, and I just loved everything! My Grilled Chicken Pasta was delicious, though the chicken was a little on the dry side, I could overlook that. My party was also pretty happy with their dishes, so we were a happy group! In the end I got my birthday Pizookie, and I was one happy birthday girl! Couldn't have asked for more. Had a great experience, and I will definitely be coming back for more!"
Christine C.,"Sacramento, CA",50,262,27,4.0,9/26/2008,I've been here a few times for dinner. There's usually a wait..not too long though. I've liked everything I've had here so far...but I usually get their BBQ chicken pizza..it's delicious! Their pasta and ribs are pretty good too. They give you a free pizookie for your birthday.  I didn't like their Old Fashioned Apple Crisp though...way too many oats!
