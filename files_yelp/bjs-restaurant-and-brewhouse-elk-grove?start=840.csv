Nancy N.,"Sacramento, CA",183,111,29,4.0,9/20/2010,"I don't like going to bj's but whenever I go there I get good service. My friend once had a party of 30 and they still gave us the service we needed. Tip was a bitch though! Lol. I don't know when it is since I was super drunk but there was a happy hour with half off pizza. Mmmm. And dollar off drinks and half off beers? I think I don't know, like I said I was drunk. Lol!"
Mikellie S.,"Sacramento, CA",80,160,,4.0,5/24/2007,"Seems like there's always a crowd here...but we were lucky to nab two seats at the bar!  The bartenders were super friendly and got us drinks quickly.  I had the Strawberry Sphlash!  It's a pretty looking drink as it is tasty.  Fiance had the Raspberry Lemon Drop which was strong but still sweet.  And What a Peach was just peachy...yum! To go with the drinks, we had tried the thin crust Basil and Italian Sausage pizza...yum!  But not much sausage on it.  Also had the Sliders...very cute miniature juicy burgers! We will be back for more!!!  There's a lot more on the menu to try!"
Lindsay D.,"Sacramento, CA",50,116,7,4.0,4/25/2008,"BJ's is basically a trendier version of TGIFriday's. Their food is pretty good....standard ""American"" food with decent desserts. BUT....what really makes it stand out amongst the other restaurant chains is their Berry Cider Beer.  Sigh, I quote from Will Ferrell from Old School, ""Fill it up again! Fill it up again! Once it hits your lips, it's so good!!!!"" =)"
Amanda H.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",122,154,13,4.0,5/24/2007,"Despite the unfortunate name (ahem), BJ's delivers flavorful food with a few twists here and there...like gigantic 30 oz stuffed potatoes that serve as meals. Do not lump BJ's into the category of yuppie suburban restaurants like Chili's, Applebee's and TJIFriday's. BJ's shows some creativity in their menu.  The Sesame Chicken Salad was fabulous - a definite repeat. Slices of quality chicken smiled at me from their bed of napa cabbage and spinach.  These flavorful leaves were garnished with sliced almonds, mandarin orange segments and dozens of wonton crisps. Be sure and ask for the dressing on the side - they brought me two cups of it and I didn't even use one.  You know the one indecisive person in the group who keeps asking the server questions or for more time to decide? I am so that girl. And for those of you like me, consider yourself warned: the menu is huge. Not as big as The Cheesecake Factory's, but still substantial. It doesn't have many pictures, and, perhaps it's juvenile of me, but that's often how I make my choices on my first visit to a restaurant. Check out the website before going - there are more pictures to help other indicisive people who struggle with large menus. Some specifics: Root Beer If you love root beer, you should give BJ's version a try. It's not so sweet as commercial root beers, and there's less carbonation so it's smoother. My friend said the Iced Tea was really gross - like sugar water, but I didn't try it.  Pasta The pasta is decent, but you can have pasta just about anywhere; I suggest trying something BJ's is better known for like their deep dish pizzas, stuffed potatoes, sandwiches, etc. Dessert I thought the Pizookie dessert (warm deep dish cookie with ice cream on top) was a little over-hyped, but it's still delicious. A great item to split.  Explaining the rating: Minus one-half star for service. Our server was very nice - when we saw her - but otherwise, incompetent.  My root beer AND water were never filled during my meal, and she didn't come by for me to ask her for more until she dropped the check. :(  Minus other half of star for lack of parking (I was forced into the Daphne's lot) and general circus-like feeling in the restaurant. This is not a ""relaxing"" place to go. It's packed. All the time. :P Double charged? Don't Panic: When my friend got home she noticed the restaurant had charged her bank card twice. She called up and talked to a manager, but he said that it's part of their system and that the second charge would go away (something to do with how they run the tip?) and it did. Just wanted to give the warning and hopefully save future BJ's diners some stress.  AmEx users, your tender is welcomed here."
Louie B.,"Elk Grove, CA",1,3,,1.0,1/21/2012,We used the 'call ahead' service on a Saturday night.  We were told the wait was 35 - 40 minutes so we put in out name.  We arrived about 35 minutes after our call.  When I gave our name I was told it would be another 25 minutes before we could get a table. I told them we called ahead.  The answer was our name is not added to the list until we arrive.  I asked what was the benefit of calling ahead and received a blank stare and a mumbling response.
Nancy L.,"Sacramento, CA",219,53,17,4.0,3/23/2008,"BJ's might be a big chain restaurant but the food really is good and it's a place that i have gone to hella times with my friends.  the food here is absolutely delicious. the artichoke dip is off the hook, haha... i really dunno how to describe it. the pizza are nice and fluffly and doughy... not the bad doughy where it's still raw. i had the salads there... and trust me, for a salad you still feel bad for eating the whole thing. sandwiches are good... pastas, good... everything is basically good. i mean i haven't tried everything, but i can say it will more than likely be good. haha. you can never miss dessert... one of the must when you got o BJ's.  the only bad thing about this place... waiting can be ridiculous if you go on the weekend. service not too good. we had servers that would let us sit there for 15 minutes before even coming over to acknowledge us, we had servers we ignored us, and some were just plain rude. the food is really what bought us back. for good food and good drinks BJ's is the way to go!"
Davis T.,"Sacramento, CA",28,104,8,4.0,9/12/2006,"I first tried this place on my birthday and I got a free Pizookie dessert thing of theirs. It was bascially a big chocolate chip cookie in a deep pan, topped with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, choice of chocolate, white chocolate, caramel, and a cherry. It was bomb!  The only food that I have tried so far here is the pizzas. Their bbq chicken pizza, and their great white pizzas. A Medium BBQ Chicken ($15) is HUGE and is good for four people. I tried their Great White during lunch ($7) , a small personal size but was still filling for me.  I tried their seasonal brew which was some blend of an Indian ale and one of their brews. It was smooth, a little bitter, and left a little woodsy to no aftertaste afterwards. I also tried their Berry Cider which was actually beer!!! It was so good and was almost like a light juice. I could definately drink a pitcher of that.  Service was slow because they were switching shifts but I unexpectedly was later served of by a friend back from high school, no idea that he worked there. It is just weird for me to tip a friend.  I would return here again and try their other brews and something else besides pizzas. I left here happy and full with a lighter wallet. Gordon Biersch has some competition here. Oh yea, the bathrooms were modern, clean, and I want a bathroom with solid wood paneling!"
Jennifer T.,"Sacramento, CA",21,147,13,4.0,7/20/2010,"Ok, well the first few times I was here, I didn't have any issues with the quality of service or even the quality of food and drinks.   The first time I came here, I came with my parents for dinner one night and the service and food was great.   The second time I came, I came after work for drinks with a co worker.  We sat at the bar and the bartender was extremely friendly and quick with getting our drinks and delivering great service although it was busy. And the last time I was here was what I had issues with and the reason for me not giving them the full 5 stars.  I came here with another friend for dinner and drinks.  The server we had was absolutely AWFUL!!!  He came and greeted us right after we were seated.  He was attentive and helpful up until after he had taken our order.  Someone else had brought us our food.  And through out the rest of the time my friend and I were there, our server pretty much kept walking past our table not even saying anything to us or even as if we weren't even sitting in our area.  We were the ones who had to stop him to ask him for glasses of water, but that was at least a 5 to 10 minute hassle.  The same goes for when my friend had noticed that she had found that something was floating in her water glass.  When she finally flagged him down to tell him, he didn't apologize or anything about what was in my friends water glass.  He just grabbed it and said he would get her another glass of water.  When he got back to our table, it was obvious that we were finished with our meals.  Our server didn't even give us our check, nor did he ask if we wanted any desert.  He just walked away.  So we just sat there for a while before we were able to get the attention of a different waiter and had asked him if it was possible to get our checks since our waiter had seemingly kept ignoring our table."
C A.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,10,,4.0,7/2/2011,"SOme of the best pizza around. It can get quite busy, but is family friendly. I LOVE eating here but it is reserved for special occasions because it can get quite pricey. Thus my 4 outta 5 stars. I LOVE the feel of the room, the pizza is great, their homemade rootbeer is TO DIE FOR! Amazing, but it gets really busy and you could be in for a wait."
Sean D.,"Galt, CA",14,28,38,2.0,8/25/2013,hit or miss sometimes the food is just plain sometimes its good
Christian T.,"Sacramento, CA",4,1,,2.0,3/26/2011,"So, our waitress told us a half dozen times that she was new...but is that an excuse for forgetting to put my order in? Everyone in our group got their food before our server, while looking at the emptiness where my plate should have been, asked ""is there something else we are waiting on?"" Once my food actually arrived it was pretty good, thus the two stars..."
Annette D.,"Sacramento, CA",0,49,17,3.0,2/19/2012,"BJ'S is usually very good, but Channel the Server is rude and has an attitude, make sure you do not have her as your server."
Sharon M.,"COURTLAND, CA",55,11,,1.0,6/21/2014,"As others have said ,  the dining service can be horrible .  We asked and ordered BBQ sauce and ranch to go on our burgers .  Didn't come out with meal as ordered . Asked again to the server .  Fast forward 10 minutes  and still no condiments . The third request finally did get us condiments for our now cold burger and fries .  Woo hoo,  they brought us new fries .  No apology , no follow up, no nothing .  We paid our bill and caught a manager apologizing to another customer  as we were leaving . Got the standard ,  I""ll look into it brush off.  Poor customer service .  Half full place with lots of servers .  There is a major management disconnect here. Avoid if you want any kind of NORMAL customer service.  There are other choices . I""ll go to In and Out or Habit where I can self serve myself myself condiments and get hot food  for half the cost.  It's not rocket science to put BBQ sauce in a cup ."
Valerie C.,"Sacramento, CA",89,26,,4.0,6/9/2008,"This may end up being a long review... Well BJ's has a very fun atmosphere for dining, and working.  I worked at a BJ's in Vacaville for a year.  I really love the menu (it's a big menu, too).  Every time I have eaten at a BJ's I have a hard time deciding what to order, since there are so many dishes I crave. They fairly recently added a sampler-type appetizer to their menu, which I think was a good move.  I've tried every appetizer they offer and have not been disappointed by any of them.  Their appetizer menu is large, taking up two whole pages, and ranges from spicy chicken wings to thin crust pizza to lettuce wraps to... well you get the picture. The rest of the menu has so many items, I'll just categorize them:  delicious sandwiches, big tasty salads, scrumptious pastas, giant stuffed potatoes (truly giant), down-home foods, steak and ribs, and pizza. There aren't quite as many dessert choices, but the pizookies are very satisfying.  A pizookie is ""pizza"" + ""cookie"" and for every one they sell, BJ's donates $0.25 to a MS research fund for children (I think it was for MS I may be wrong). Now let's talk about the service.  Here is where I let out a long sigh.  BJ's has such potential to be one of the best restaurants ever (in my opinion), however there are so many problems with the service. Having worked for this restaurant chain/franchise/whatever, I understand how difficult it can be to provide great, or even ok, service to guests.  BJ's tends to put a lot of responsibility on its servers (instead of hiring more people) and it ends up affecting how well they can take care of the guests.  Sometimes you get a server with a bad attitude, but that seemed to be rare - they filter those types of people out pretty well, and everybody I knew that worked with me had a great attitude and did their best. That being said, I'm not going to go into more detail here about what makes it so hard to give great service in these restaurants (feel free to message me if you'd like to talk about it).   Just note that if you come to eat at a BJ's restaurant, there's a chance you will wait longer for your drinks and/or food than at another restaurant, but for me, the food is so fantastic (and I am sympathetic to the servers) that I don't mind the wait too much.   A good alternative is to get a seat at the bar - it's right next to the kitchen and the food comes out as soon as it's ready."
Stacy G.,"West Sacramento, CA",253,644,128,4.0,5/1/2008,"BJ's wins my vote as best mid-price range chain restaurant. It is a fantastic place to go with friends, although the wait is nearly always long and must be taken into consideration.  What's good here? Everything! But the pizza is a must-try and the root beer - to die for! I never leave without a root beer float in the summatime! I really do find it amazing that I have liked everything I have tried there, from appetizers to sandwiches to desserts, 'cause I ain't exactly an easy to please, especially when it comes to chains...  P.S. The food is heavy but... it hurts so good!"
Jerry H.,"Fair Oaks, CA",0,7,,5.0,4/25/2011,"This place is great, awesome food, friendly staff, and it doesn't matter which BJ's you go to.  I'm rating this one in particular cause the staff there is awesome whenever I go, and it really doesn't matter what i order i'm always satisfied."
Zach L.,"Sacramento, CA",1,18,,4.0,7/6/2010,"Love the Chardonnay shrimp pasta!  The pizza is great. And nothing ends dinner better than a pizookie. However, the wait is long on Friday and Saturday nights."
Miles R.,"Sacramento, CA",1,45,,4.0,2/17/2012,"Came and the staff was friendly but wish they would not use the front desk as a hangout, kindda makes you feel like you are intruding.  We we seated withing five minutes and our waiteress was friendly and attentive.  The food was good but the place was a little too crowded, wonder how come the ADA has not come down on them because the walk way between the tables is way to narrow for wheel chair. I really dont want to hear the next tables converstation.  I would return but on at a quieter time."
Nikki c.,"Oakland, CA",338,1040,,2.0,8/10/2007,"The food was good,  a solid 3, but the overall experience brings their ranking down.  I enjoyed my chicken Cesar salad, and couldn't finish it because it was so big.  I was with a group, and most people were pleased with their food.  Be warned, the mashed potatoes were not good.  The fries are big steak cut fries. HOWEVER, the  service was insanely slow.  As we were leaving we noticed someone else from our group was sitting at a different table.  Even though he was alone, the service had been just as slow as it was for our group of six.  My soda was refilled promptly, but I only drank so much soda because it took forever and a day to bring out our food.   If you are in no rush whatsoever, then this may be a good place to chill, do not go here when you have any time constraints."
Danny P.,"Emeryville, CA",249,268,138,3.0,7/16/2009,"I decided to healthy and ordered the seasame chicken salad which consisted of ""Napa cabbage with grilled, marinated breast of chicken, toasted almonds, crisp wontons, red bell peppers, green onions, mandarin oranges, sesame seeds and our sweet sesame dressing.""  It was one of those dishes that tastes really really good the first couple bites and then you wish you never ordered it."
