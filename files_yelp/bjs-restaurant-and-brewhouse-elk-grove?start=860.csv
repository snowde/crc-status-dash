Elaine H.,"San Francisco, CA",241,979,112,4.0,6/28/2009,"Avocado Rolls.. still yummy as ever. Deep dish pizza was amazing! They have quite and extensive menu, and lots of drinks since they are a brewery. Its opened till 11pm and even 1am on certain days of the week. This place stays packed until pretty late on the weekends as well. The only down side was that one of us ordered the scampi pasta, and the angel hair pasta wasn't in long strands, but broken pieces. On top of that, our server left, but nobody else paid any attention to us after! We saw one or two female servers definitely trying to avoid eye-contact and trying to get off work ASAP! But I'd definitely be back."

Jacob S.,"Sacramento, CA",37,12,,3.0,11/11/2010,"The place is always packed even right before closing. The wait staff is usally eager to get your order in and make your evening enjoyable, and always pretty quick to get your drinks. I love their jerimiah red house brew. I havent really ventured off and ordered many different things there, but the giant stuffed potatoes and pizzas never disappoint. This place is cool for a few friends to hang out and have a drink with some mediocre food. ill give it 3 stars."
Sundep J.,"San Jose, CA",32,7,,1.0,8/23/2010,"Worst place ever! Went there at 11pm on the dot, and were not accomidated...eventhough they 'say' they are open until modnight....sucks!"
Victor L.,"Sacramento, CA",4,125,52,4.0,6/19/2012,"a little pricy, but the food is very good.  I love the jambalaya, probably one of the best i've ever had."
Jim G.,"Sacramento, CA",6,106,9,2.0,6/27/2011,"I live here in Elk Grove and dine at all the restaurants in the Laguna area often. Most are pretty good, but some always have issues. BJ's is one of those with issues. I have lived here for a while, but have been dinning here for years. When ever my family and I or my friends and I go to BJ's something always goes wrong with either the service or the meal. With the meals it is usually at least one plate from our group is either cold or the order was wrong. Now I have to admit that when brought to the attention of the manager, a new meal is brought out pretty quick and it's perfect. My issue is that every time we go there SOMETHING goes wrong.... always. The food is good when it's served properly. The service is hit and miss. Good selection of food too. But I do have a problem paying $10.00 for a small sandwich and even a smaller amount of fries. Over all BJ's is Ok.... But good luck getting everything perfect with your orders."
Raymond N.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,2,,1.0,1/1/2013,"Dining experience on New Years day (01/01/13) was a disappointing experience, to start with , our side order of Salad came with entree.  The crispy Calamari was cold. What made it worse was the attitude of the waitress. She did offer any apology for the mistake. What prompted me to write this review is that this was not the first time. This restaurant happens to make mistakes of wedge cut fries & think cut ones. They never seem to have their order right. This is use to be my favorite restaurant but lately they don't seem to have consistency & standards have dropped."
Claude F.,"Sacramento, CA",60,17,4,3.0,5/25/2012,"My wife and I finally get a date night away from the kids. She chose BJs which was fine. We arrive and the hostess seats us right away. Our server Nick was great, courteous and kind. I order a beer and wife orders tea. The beer I wanted I am later told we don't have, fine I order a different one. My wife orders Avocado rolls and we wait. We then realize they are out of that, OK. So we order 2 tomato mozzarella salads and they are phenomenal. For dinner she orders a mini pizza which she said had a lot of flavor. I order Tuscan chicken limone and it was tasty yet a puddle of grease sat the bottom of the plate which I ate around. For desert a pazookie trio, don't bother ordering it stick with the white chocolate macadamia pazookie the others are not as good. Service was great, food was great however BJs again was not prepared. This was my second visit to BJs in 6 months and on my previous visit they didn't have 3 different menu items including pizza dough?!!! They need to work on their ordering, seems their kitchen manager is more concerned with meeting labor and cost than making enough prep and ordering enough product."
Lacie V.,"Sacramento, CA",7,28,,4.0,5/21/2010,My boyfriend introduced me to this place about six months ago. I've been to this location twice and one in roseville once. Both places have yummy root beer and pizookies. The food is always pretty good and they accommodate to vegetarian needs well.
Aaron S.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,28,,1.0,12/21/2012,Got food poisoning twice from this spot. Shrimp lettuce wraps and their grilled chicken sandwich.
Devin M.,"Sacramento, CA",1,6,,2.0,12/13/2012,"I came here for dinner tonight and ordered one of their holiday specials.  The holiday ribeye. Upon eating the food it didn't taste right. I informed my waiter who informed the manager. I told the manager that the steak did not taste like a ribeye. I told him it was a top sirloin. He explains to me that he has worked here thirty years. Told me how their is fat around the side. I eat ribeye all the time. There is fat in between the meats for flavor. This had no fat, just meat...tough dry. No flavor... Manager told me its choice ribeye...I didn't get a ribeye... I know what a ribeye taste like even if its choice. They switched it with a sirloin. On a good note, my server was really good."
Steve K.,"Sacramento, CA",16,86,28,4.0,12/29/2009,"We've been to the BJ's in Elk Grove many times. They are always packed and do great business. It's partly due to the location, but more importantly, due to their consistent food, service, and atmosphere. Personally, BJ's is a guilty pleasure for someone who doesn't want too much deep fried and/or high fat foods . They have mostly upscale ""bar food"". But, you can now find some pretty pleasing (lower fat) items on the menu. We had the Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps (yummy), Grilled Chicken Flat Bread Pizza (awesome!...BTW - the regular pizza are really good too), and Balslmic Glazed Chicken (I always get this, but substitute the mashed potatoes for rice - very good!). Of course they have a full bar, lots of TV's (sports), and plenty of seating. Check it out if you're looking for lots of options!"
Sandra T.,"Sacramento, CA",11,26,1,5.0,8/12/2009,"This place is great. The food is always good. Very fresh, tasty and at a good price. The beers on tap are tasty. This place is usually pretty busy but not too much of a wait. I really like the chix pesto thin crust pizza, the Jeremiahs Red ale and the avocado rolls are superb. Don't forget to try a pazookie with a friend before you leave! If you are celebrating a birthday, they usually bring one out for free! Mmmm Mmm!"
The Critic 1.,"Sacramento, CA",13,199,3,4.0,7/8/2009,I've been to many BJ's and they always take good care of their customers.  The manager here gave samples of pizza while we waited.  Our wait was 35 minutes like they said.  Their food is always consistent.  I love their pizza - the dough is so soft.  We ordered a child size spaghetti and they accidently made it a regular size but they only charged us for the child size.  The waitress came around a lot of times.  The manager came to check on us.  Not too many restaurants especially chain restaurants do that anymore.
Hannah M.,"Sacramento, CA",0,13,,1.0,10/18/2012,Ordered mini corn dogs for my daughter and half looked like they were double fried. Nasty. I'll try and upload a picture.
Shannon J.,"Sacramento, CA",0,29,15,4.0,9/10/2010,I love this place.  The wait is a lil too long.  The atmosphere is great.  This place bre their own beer.  I like to sit at the bar and watch the games.  Happy hour deals are amazing.  You must try their think slice pizza and the deep dish pizza.  This place has the bests hot pizza.  Their salad are fresh and the portions are decent sizes.  The dessert is great too .
Jen H.,"Elk Grove, CA",1,40,,4.0,1/16/2012,The root beer is so tasty! I can't help but get it when I go there. The staff is pretty friendly. We went there last week and sat in the bar our waitress was great! I didn't order the Pazooki (spelling not sure) because we were so full and I regretted it as soon as I got home. I'll never let that happen again. Now I have to go back just to get one :)

Sharon P.,"Sacramento, CA",0,4,,4.0,9/7/2010,"This place is great. The last time we went, we used call ahead seating. Checked in and got called five minutes later. Which was great because there was like 20 people waiting. There is some bomb appetizers(sp?) called avacado egg rolls. They come with this great sauce. We ALWAYS order these!!  The pizza we've had a few times has been GREAT!  This is somewhere we come at least once a month!"
