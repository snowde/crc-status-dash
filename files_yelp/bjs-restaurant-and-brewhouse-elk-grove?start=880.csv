Dave S.,"Sacramento, CA",7,18,,4.0,3/16/2009,"NOTE: For those who complain about the long wait, you CAN call-ahead.  Yes, some of the BJ's have long waits (1.5 hours is my longest) however just call ahead and you won't have to worry about it.  Heck, you can even place an order for the pizza so the wait for food is shorter when you get there. I like BJ's as a place to see some sports and have some good food and drinks. The beers are pretty standard with nothing really jumping out at me.  I'll go between the Red and the Nut Brown for the usual beers and have enjoyed some of their seasonal styles.  We just went and they had some pumpkin beer but I'm always afraid of that because most that I've found use pumpkin flavoring at the end, not actual pumpkin in the brewing process.  I haven't had a good pumpkin ale - perhaps this might have been the first, but I wasn't about to try. The pizza is good quality and a decent take on Chicago-style pizza.  The crust is tasty and airy and the toppings are plentiful.  The proportions of the pizza (crust/sauce/cheese/toppings) is great.  For a chain I think BJ's is right up there with Old Chicago. Usually my wife and I will get the Texas BBQ Chicken Chop Salad.  This thing is massive and big enough that we both make a comfortable meal out of it.  We get the dressing on the side b/c my wife feels that they over-do the dressing but it doesn't bother me (I like the dressing/BBQ sauce combo).  I also enjoy the chop salad b/c I find them to be easier to get bite of everything each time w/out having to stab around a salad. I have ordered the fish 'n' chips here and have mixed feelings.  When I ordered it I ordered with the potato wedge fries which were seasoned.  I do enjoy the wedge fries and the seasoning but I'll have to get the chips next time to see how they rate.  As for the fish the pieces were decent sized however I didn't like how the breading was crunchy on the outside and mushy on the inside.  Because of this, the breading was falling off between bites (sliding off the fish).  The outside again held up well to the malt vinegar, but the mushy inside killed it for me. Overall I really like BJ's and we do go there quite a bit for the salad, pizza and beer.  OH!  And the pizookie - oh yea, that's awesome as well.  I can't tell you which I prefer because I love them all."
Tina H.,"Sacramento, CA",25,54,13,5.0,1/30/2011,One word YUM! This place is pretty damn good. I've here a few time and I left happy everytime! You know its good when they're always busy. ;) Enjoy!

Alison W.,"San Jose, CA",413,1590,952,4.0,6/2/2009,"Headed here after a disappointing start to the night at Mandangos. It was a little after midnight so only the bar area was open. And all the tables were full so we had to wait a bit for one to open up. Finally the four of us squeezed around a table probably meant for two. It was dirty and someone promised to come wipe it down but it ended up staying unclean through the whole meal. Our waited was awesome though - I'm sorry I didn't get his name though - he was upbeat, funny, straightforward (no BS) and recommended this beer concoction that he said all the BJs workers loved. I don't remember what was in it - two different types of beer and one of was this berry flavored one so it was kinda sweet, which is perfect for me - the usually non-beer drinker. Anyways we ordered the appetizer sampler, chicken wings, and a chocolate chip pizookie. I have to get the pizookie every time I'm at BJs. I'm a baker myself and I know they can be made at home cause it's basically a giant cookie topped with ice cream but they must put a little something extra in it cause it's just so much more delicious. The food was average - nothing spectacular. My friends and I stayed till they turned the lights on and they kicked us out. I'm glad we ended the night on a high note. Thank you BJs for leaving us alone and letting us just chill, eat, drink, and catch up."
Viv C.,"Elk Grove, CA",34,168,5,3.0,8/6/2009,"I come for pizza, root beer, salads, and chili (when i don't want to open a can up at home). love, love, love their deep dish pizza. however, service is inconsistent. sometimes attentive, sometimes forgetful or even inconsiderate. sometimes we'll do take-out to avoid the wait staff... and i don't know why it is, but there's always a wait... even when we come at odd hours... still, i like their food. just not the service."
Terilyn J.,"Sacramento, CA",9,84,21,1.0,5/19/2011,"Mom wanted to go here for her 74th bday because she thought there would be something for everyone. Big mistake this place is a nightmare! I'm baffled that they are still open.  the food was awful & it had clearly sat for a long time before it was brought to us. Dinner was not kinda warm it was cold. I tried to play it safe and ordered the fish and chips, they had no seasoning completely bland.  Long john silvers is much better, and the potato wedges that came with the fish I'm certain came off a plate left over from the lunch run. You know how fried potatos get after sitting for awhile - that tasteless yuk.. There you go. We also tried the special sodas which they make. Sadly they even messed those up. The sodas came w/no ice just a frosted mug i'm still wondereing if this was intentional or an oversight. But the sodas are pretty strong (root beer, black cherry) and they needed to the ice to cut it, plus they werent cold! The waiters were very sweet but obviously had no wait training, reaching around us awkwardly, over our heads, and forgot to bring the utensils. It was so bad it was like being on Punked! We waited 30 minutes for the check and my 78 yr old dad started ranting about leaving w/o paying because they would never notice. The worst dinner experience I've had in a long time. You've been warned.."
Caitlin J.,"Elk Grove, CA",38,131,28,1.0,3/11/2011,"The WORST customer service you could ever get. My 21st birthday I was so excited to order my first ""legal"" drink. the waiter took my id and stated ""oh todays your birthday,"" and continuied talking to himself about the next day he worked and that he had yesterday off. and left. I thought it was odd to not recieve a happy birthday. It took 20+ minuites for my drink, yet the table of about 6 guys next to us all got their drinks in just a few minuites. I was offered a ""birthday pizzookie"" and ive been to bjs enough to know that its supposed to be a free mini pizzokie with a cute candle on top. They were out of my frist 3 choices of pizzookie. I finally made another choice. it was somthing I didnt really care for but figured it was my birthday and assumed it was complamentry as they normally are. I recievced a full pizzookie, no candle, not fully cooked, and was charged the $6  for it. Such a rude waiter. such bad customer service. I ended up not getting my credit card back after the meal and noone knew what happened to it after I was charged. When i called management to complain they obviously didnt care. Nice to know how valued their customers are."
Lucas N.,"Sacramento, CA",21,108,42,3.0,4/4/2009,"This place is great to meet friends! It's usually really busy and you gotta wait, but it's worth it...sometimes! I love their pazookies! I can just come here to eat them! I also like their deep dish mediteranean pizza and bbq chicken pizza..I've tried their combination and that's good too!  Food is really good and comes in really good portions, but sometimes the service is a bit shotty...so stars off for that :P"
Jay K.,"Elk Grove, CA",153,472,4,5.0,7/10/2010,"BJs is a corporate restaurant paradise. They have gotten just about everything right for a chain restaurant and it shows. On any given night there will be at least a 10 minute wait to be seated at a table. This is why I usually choose to go to the bar, where the full menu is still available. Their technique for selecting and hiring service staff is near flawless. I cannot recall ever having a bad service experience here. As far as the food goes, there is not a loser on the menu. From salads to pizzas (half off at happy hour) to entree dishes and sandwiches there is nothing that you won't drool over. This is a restaurant where you will never have to be afraid to try something new. Feel free to ask for modifications too, they will be done with no attitude whatsoever. Drinks are pretty standard for a corporate restaurant but we usually get hooked up pretty good. (remember to tip people!) Be careful, if you try BJs once you won't be able to stop coming back!"
Theresa N.,"Elk Grove, CA",1,12,,2.0,7/22/2011,"I came here twice the first one was here. I ordered something on the kid's menu. The food was delicious, but after like 7 bites I had a stomach bomb. Another time I went to the BJs in the Arden and the same thing happened except I was sick for around 3 days. I don't know if I was allergic to any thing but I don't think I'm going there again."
Pamela R.,"Hayward, CA",160,438,19,3.0,12/26/2008,"I've had better experiences at other BJ's, but this one was decent. My mom and my friend's mom LOVED the soups that they got --broccoli cheddar and also the tomato bisque. I ordered the Santa Fe Salad, but was disappointed with the dressing and switched the dressing out for a regular honey mustard. BUT we all know the real reason that you  go to BJ's--the pizza. My friend and her mom ordered two different pizzas that they both loved. I would say that I would go back."
Hanna T.,"San Leandro, CA",27,32,25,2.0,3/18/2010,"LOOOOOOOONG wait. Food was really bland. It had variety, but everything just looked the same. The pizookie that I was really looking foward to trying for the first time, wasn't all that great either. I could've just made that at home, Phillsbury even tastes better! Just smack some icecream on top and there you have it. Until they decide to change or update their menu and get new waiters, I won't be coming back anytime soon."
H H.,"Dublin, CA",69,457,124,4.0,12/29/2010,i been to other bjs but i dont know my waitress was really eager to please and came to check on us a lot--something im not use to especially at chain restaurants. the pear cider --delicious!
Timothy H.,"Sacramento, CA",72,74,,2.0,4/22/2008,"i'm going to be fair, i know i'm a hater most of the time, true... but i'm going to be fair. i have never had a good experience at this restaurant, but i have never had bad food at this restaurant either.  1st time, big group, wait for food so long that the young boy next to me and myself fall asleep on each other. i never finish my crappy beer. 2nd time, everything is slow and/or wrong. in the end they drop off the wrong bill.. it is at least thirty dollars less than our real bill should be... so we pay it and leave. 3rd time, seating time is given as almost an hour. we sit at a bar table and in less than five minutes side-step everyone else. my immediate idea is that ""This is retarded.""  so, yea.. crappy service. good food. i dont hate it, but im not picking this first either."
S H.,"Elk Grove, CA",35,28,6,4.0,8/4/2011,"The best thing about BJ's is that you always get what you expect, no matter Natomas, Reno or Elk Grove...The service was great and appreciated - she offered suggestions when asked and let us have a good time without being pushy...she even 'threw' in an extra pizookie for the birthdays' being celebrated. New red velvet pizookie is fantastic but SUPER rich. Appreciate the new 'delight' items on the menu - allows me to have a salad, 1/2 pizza and an appetizer for low calories and price."
Natacha M.,"Milpitas, CA",28,205,2,2.0,11/5/2008,So went here when I was visiting the Fam.  I got this California hamburger which was alright.  It was kinda blahhhhhh.  I wasn't impressed at all and thought I would probably not go back.
Mike A.,"Sacramento, CA",0,6,,1.0,1/16/2010,"Wow... horrible experience w/ customer service. When we walked in at around 10:30 on a Thursday night, there didn't seem to be a host because we were standing around looking for somebody to help us for a good 10 minutes. There seemed to be a lot of people working, but we didn't seem to catch anybody's attention other than the patrons already there. Finally, a person who was already sitting down pointed out to their waitress that  we'd been at the front waiting for somebody for a long time. When the waitress came over she just said ""it's self-seating hours only right now."" uh... like I was supposed to know? So we walked into the ""self-seating"" area where we waited another good 30 minutes before a different server finally came around to give us menus. When we tried to order, she said that they only had appetizers and mini-pizzas after 11:00. Well, if i had gotten sat and given menus 40 minutes earlier like I was supposed to have, I would've been able to order what I wanted. The server went to check with a manager if I could still order a large pizza. The answer was ""no."" When the manager came to talk to us about it, he talked to us with apologetic words, but had an attitude clearly showing that he didn't care. I couldn't order a large pizza but I could order the mini-pizzas. How does that make sense? Doesn't this place close at 12:00 anyways? Whatever. The service was consistently  horrible and although the food was decent, (got a few mini-pizzas) everybodys' night was ruined. I usually write good reviews, but the horrible service was unacceptable to the point that I had to rant here... Anyways, maybe I'll try this place again in the future, but it wont be for a while. Oh yah, the majority of their beers also suck. If you want to go to a decent brewery, try Pyramid, Rubicon, or River City. The Pyramid Haywire Hefeweizen is the best."
Cheree K.,"Galt, CA",3,6,,2.0,1/5/2011,"Wasn't happy with our trip to here Monday.  We arrived at a time when it wasn't busy (4:00pm)  we were told we could seat ourselves.  We waited for the menu about 8 minutes, 10 minutes later he took our order then instead of putting our order in he went to 2 more tables.  10 minutes later he put our order in.  I watched people that came in after us eating while we were still waiting for our order.  At 4:48pm we  received our appetizer, (pizza) cold ( the cheese had already re-harden from being cold).  Our food arrived about 5 minutes later and was slid to us in a rush then off he went never to be seen again until he brought the bill.  My mistake I had my card out on the table and he scooped it up on his way past.  He again past by sliding my receipt saying Thank-you then was gone.  The resturant was never more than half full."
Casey T.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,10,,5.0,1/6/2008,"BJs is always the place that I like to go with a group of friends. We can just hang out and eat there for fun.  My favorite is their BJs favorite pizza, and chicken wings.  Their Chicken wings are very crispy that I can't stop eating it after the first one."
D M.,"Sacramento, CA",18,15,4,5.0,4/18/2009,"i'mma guy so i'mma keep this short. Good Beer, Good Food, Beautiful waitresses. Well some of them. go to this place to hang with the guys and get away from the mrs. Just playing Ladies WE love you but, But we love beer and sports also :-p"
