Lisa W.,"Sacramento, CA",46,183,19,5.0,10/29/2006,"I've eaten here about a half a dozen times since they opened this summer.  My family and I have never had a bad meal... in fact, it's one of our favorite restaurants.  The pizzas, burgers, sandwiches, salads, and nachos are fabulous, and the pfizookie dessert cookie thingy is carbolicious!  The portion sizes of all of their meals are very large, and the prices are reasonable (about $8 for most menu items, and that includes fries or half a gourmet baked potato with their burgers and sammiches).  Neither my husband nor I drink beer, so I can't speak for their home brew, but my husband and son LOVE their rootbeer floats made with homemade rootbeer and hardpack vanilla ice cream.  The bathrooms have always been clean and the service, while not consistently speedy, is still better than most restaurants in Elk Grove."
Jenn S.,"Elk Grove, CA",405,34,21,4.0,9/20/2008,"I've been here a lot-mostly the one in Natomas cause it was by my work. But I've also been at the one in Elk Grove. Pretty good food and does hit the spot. The burgers are delicious-They're BIG ass burgers. I love the strawberry lemonade. The artichoke dip is very tasty and just really good! It does get crowded and packed, but I think it's worth the wait."
Luther S.,"Falls Church, VA",17,39,1,2.0,10/10/2008,"Mixed results for a party of two.  The caesar salad and chili soup was good but the chicken pizza, house salad and clam chowder was not."
N A.,"Elk Grove, CA",1,43,11,3.0,11/29/2010,"This place is pretty decent as long as you stick with the ""normal"" food items; pizza, sandwich, soup, salad, etc.  I will say that they can get incredibly busy.  This is especially true on Friday nights, so good luck getting in.  The service is ""so so"" and will definitely differ depending on whether or not the place is over flowing.  If you're going to go you may want to try their Pizookie.  It's a giant Cookie with ice cream on top and I have to say it good.  Over all it's A-Ok, and I'll probably be eating here again."
Steve A.,"Elk Grove, CA",1,36,,3.0,4/9/2008,"I'm not really following all the good reviews. This is a prototypical chain restaurant. The beer is good (not great). The pizookie desert is good but how could you screw that up?! The food is about on par with Outback and TGI Friday's. It's not bad, it's not good....it just is.  There's really nothing here to make a fuss over. It is somehow percieved as ""trendy"" in Elk Grove."
Michelle I.,"Sacramento, CA",3,103,,4.0,10/27/2009,"My hubby and I have been to the Roseville and Elk Grove locations on multiple occasions. The ONLY thing we have ever ordered is the French Dip sandwich... i don't care which location or when, it is THE most consistent, moist, delicious French Dip around town... from the cheese to the grilled onions, they are our favs..... Service is always good, and if there is a wait, we just pop into the bar and eat there.... no waiting...."
Lola D.,"Sacramento, CA",60,118,3,1.0,2/21/2008,"AARRGGGHH!!!  How do people endorse this place!!!  First time, my best friend finds freakin HAIRS (YES, plural) in her potato.  She brings it to the attention of the server who says, ""Well what do you want me to do about it?""  But, me I'm a glutton for punishment and went back again...According to a recent episode of Oprah, I'm addicted to negative pleasure...The order came out wrong, our server was ducking and dodging us the whole time, drinks alone took 15 min...  The food is tacky, cheap and easily duplicated.  The pizza is decent at best, the service is ATROCIOUS.- and I only save that word for truly horrific experiences.  And ya know what?  I'm just gonna say it.  The so called ""amazing world famous"" bizookie?  SUCKS!!!  Big chips ahoy with cheapo ice cream: big deal.  They should be paying me to eat there.    If someone mentions BJs to me again, it better involve a cool bartles and james or payment for the previous night!  This place is only for people with annoying loud kids and high schoolers so they can be loud as heck in the restaurant and get cheap dive food. AppleBJs?  The root beer is good though..."
Erika H.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,2,,5.0,4/12/2009,"BJ's is definately one of the best restaurants in Elk Grove. It's always bustling with people, even on week days. It has a lively atmosphere that everyone in the  family will enjoy. Their food always tastes good too! I would suggest a pizza for starters. :) I would recommend BJ's  to anyone who has not tried it yet!!!"
Mindy C.,"Sacramento, CA",22,14,2,5.0,1/14/2010,i love this place!!! i only go there when there's happy hours. it's always busy but if u go on right time u don't have to wait. their foods are good and also their beers are good. and their mini pizzas are the best.
Kp K.,"Sacramento, CA",5,28,,3.0,5/17/2008,the food here is OK but OMG the service just sucks so bad it takes forever for them to take your order and forever for them to hand over you bill plus your server is never around. if your going to eat at this place just go to the bar not the table
