Matt W.,"San Jose, CA",53,17,,4.0,1/1/2018,"I frequently go to a few different BJ's in Northern California and this was my first time eating this one in Escondido, while in the area, visiting family and friends. We had a large group of 15 for dinner and had to wait longer than the time we asked for when we called a couple of hours earlier, but Adam quickly got us seated when a table was available and was very apologetic about our wait. Kristijian was our server and he did an awesome job, especially with our large group.  Not only did he have a great personality, he was very attentive and made sure that everything was good for us.  He's probably one of the best servers I've encountered at any BJ's.  I just hope the experience will be similar if I ever go to this location in the future."
Marcus F.,"Escondido, CA",254,1903,3172,1.0,11/19/2017,"Terrible service from their opening 8 years ago through today. I've given them a pass over the years but tonight's visit will be my last visit ever at this location. I can deal with a mixup or two, or a wait, but we were held hostage here for two hours because everything took forever. Ordering, drinks, appetizers, salad, pizza, bill, box, picking up credit card, all had longer waits than Disneyland during the summer.. NOT fun with restless kids. - 2 hour stay - 40 mins till appetizers were served - 20 minutes waiting for box and bill - Server forgot to pickup our credit card. Had to flag him down... Tip - While you're waiting forever for everything here, relax and read the endless negative reviews for this BJ's. You'll get some good chuckles in at least. -"
Josef C.,"San Marcos, CA",0,8,,3.0,10/20/2017,"Service: FANTASTIC! server (Heather) was on time, not too pushy not too slow, not anything but nice ... 9/10 Food: I took a steak which was okay, it was prepared to my satisfaction (medium rare). My significant other ordered a soup and salat. Both not too spectacular, but okay. Not well presented. We found it was prized ok. Maybe a bit over prized. 6/10 Location: nah. It felt like the cheesecake factory just a little brighter inside. However, the issue is that BJs simply is not the cheesecake factory offering great deserts. 6/10 because it is close to the mall. Music: it is a sports bar concept with too many TVs. If you do not want to talk to somebody, but just stare on sport events, this could be a good place for you, not for me. 4/10 Comments:  overall, the only reason why we wanted to try it out is because we got tired of the horrible service of the cheese cake factory. Heather our server was great, the food not really and the ambiance loveless ... would we come back? nah ... thanks"
Kevin H.,"San Marcos, CA",2,66,108,1.0,10/15/2017,"Before reading this review please note that I accept the following: BJs is a fairly large chain restaurant and therefore quality can suffer. We originally came here to have a pint of the pumpkin ale and an appetizer. Upon ordering the pumpkin ale we were told ""that it is not working."" How does beer not work!?!? Disappointed, we ordered other BJ beers because it was happy hour and we were put in an awkward situation. We also ordered chips and guacamole which took 30 minutes to arrive. After 20 mins of waiting, we inquired with our waitress to our chips whereabouts only to be told they needed to make more guacamole and it would take 10 mins. Where is the communication waitress? The waitress did bring us free salsa for waiting, which was nice. The guac had cucumbers in it, which I found odd. After eating chips, we regrettably decided to order dinner and another beer. I watched my beer sit at the bar for at least 10 minutes while our waitress continually walked past the beer. Once our food arrived it was decent, but like I said, I accept that I'm at BJs. The total was pretty cheap as it was happy hour. I left BJs pretty upset and disappointed. They didn't have the pumpkin ale, chips took forever, and my beer sat at the bar for far too long. The customer service was pathetic. I'm not going to come back for a while. Sorry BJs, I am disappoint."
Nicole D.,"Ramona, CA",76,2,1,5.0,12/28/2017,I had the best experience here. Their staff was fantastic. We had Sonya who helped us pick the best options and was helpful throughout the whole dinner. I will definitely come back because of the great staff and wonderful food/ beer options. Thank you Sonya and the whole BJ staff!
Jessica N.,"Escondido, CA",366,151,1130,5.0,11/28/2017,"The 5 stars are for the best server ever- Stephanie! She was super attentive and never let our drinks stay empty for more then a second. She was super friendly and even though it was super busy she stopped by to check on us several times. BJ's food overall is a 3- it is consistently good, but nothing amazing. it is always a lively atmosphere here and there is often a wait. I can usually find seating in the bar area and my husband likes that they have tv's."
Ken W.,"San Diego, CA",12,166,71,5.0,12/6/2017,"If have eaten at many BJ's restaurants in Orange County and San Diego. The one thing that they have going for them is consistency in service, food and beers. I have been overdue in reviewing this location. I love their holiday seasonal ale, Grand Cru! Their other beers are good but Grand Cru is exceptional and should be offered all the time. Their appetizers, salads and burgers (especially the Bison burger) are delicious. Their derby Cobb salad is a salad lover's dream! Server Heather is responsive and professional. Location at the Westfield Mall is convenient and parking is plentiful. The place is always clean and comfortable."
Maria G.,"San Bernardino, CA",67,7,,5.0,12/30/2017,Our first time at this BJs and our waiter was AMAZING!  Ask for Kristiajan.  He gave us excellent customer service
Judith N.,"Escondido, CA",1,75,85,3.0,8/23/2017,"Some people in our group had food they liked...others did not.   I had a portabella mushroom burger and they cooked it in the pizza oven...they usually cook veggie burgers and portobella burger on the same grill as meat.  Couldn't have French fries because they are cooked in the same oil as they cook the chicken.  I had soup instead, which was ok....would rather have French fries with my burger. There was a hair on a shrimp on my son in laws meal....they remade it and took it off the bill.  He didn't like it...and didn't eat it.  Too salty.  Other food was salty.  My soup was bland. May or may not come back.  Server was nice."
Natasha O.,"Vista, CA",79,2,5,2.0,12/31/2017,"The new maragarita paloma is really bad in this place  thats the worse margarita i have in restaurants,  if you here next time please make sure the bartender who did my margarita is not ketty she really bad .akimg drinks, food is good servive also ia really good"
Angela B.,"Escondido, CA",3,9,8,1.0,1/5/2018,"We've been going to BJs since they opened but tonight was one of our worst visit.   Ordered kids meal and it's more an infant meal at best.   I would be embarrassed to serve that food.   We had to wait to get refill for our drinks.   When it was time to pay, we had to wait again.   They have a couple of servers that are great.   Not sure we'll be coming back anytime soon."
Darline D.,"Escondido, CA",393,205,595,4.0,6/20/2017,"I've only gone here for birthday dinners or for late night happy hour. I've yet to try their brunch which I hear is amazing...will have to update after I've done so. What's great is that they have a pretty large menu with just as much offerings of low cal ""enlightenment"" eats as they have pizzas and that's saying a lot.  It's not the generic salad or anything like that...it's pretty substantial. I love their maple salmon pita on that part of the menu...so delicious you barely know it's better for you. Their pizzas have that good cheese elasticity when you pull away from the pie and have a nice crispy crust that you would get from a pan pizza. A large variety of beers in house and from other breweries on tap and in bottles from fruit to spice to hops and double IPAs. Seriously there's something for everyone. Love their Snakebite which is a mix of Guinness and cider as well as their Berry cider in mixed cocktails. Now I know I said I come here for late night happy hours...I don't necessarily order any of their appetizers so I don't know how they taste. I just get their beers, enlightened items, pizza, and pizookies. Oh pizookies....what are those, you say? They're like little cookies in a mini pizza pan, a la mode, and there are a couple of flavors. My favorite has to be their white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie. If you are a chocolate fan, I'd recommend their Godiva pizookie. It's definitely chock-full of chocolate from cookie to topping. If you have a large party or a couple of kids who can eat a lot of dessert, you should totally order the party sized pizookie. The thing is massive and has 3 scoops of ice cream with toppings. We had our table of 6 (2 who can eat just about everything) and could barely finish it after a dinner. Parking is plentiful and it's by the mall."
Sheri B.,"Santee, CA",12,5,5,1.0,11/3/2017,"First time at this location. The drinks were bad, the food was disgusting, and the service was just as bad.  The server may have been new so I will give her some slack however, the food looked like it was left overs from someone else who sent it back.  She should have never brought this to the table. We were sharing the appetizer and were not given any little plates and the server never came back to check on us until we asked for the bill.  We obviously did not eat the food and she asked if we wanted a to go box?  It was so disgusting as you can see in the photos. We have been to other locations many times and never had an experience like this."
Michelle M.,"San Marcos, CA",9,115,302,4.0,7/8/2017,My husband and I ordered a Classic Flat Bread Pizza to split. I love the deep dish pizza here but I am trying to keep my carbs down so I ordered the flat bread.  The pizza crust was super thin and it was loaded with meaty goodness.  I added a house side salad and a Jeremiah Red beer. It was a perfect inexpensive early dinner that did not leave me overstuffed.
Mei C.,"San Diego, CA",17,61,195,5.0,1/5/2017,"Had a lovely time dining here. Our server Christian was polite, quick, and funny. No problems with our orders, everything was smooth, and the foods were delicious. Ordered a small pan fried bbq chicken pizza. 6 slices. Tastes great with ranch. It was really delectable and I can't really say anything other than to just order and see for yourself. Dessert was a cookies and cream pizookie! Regular size was enough to share with three people. Comes with an ample amount of ice cream along with a small cookies and cream flavored whip cream (pure sugary bliss right there). It got a little sweet at the end so sharing is recommended. The pan is also hot so be careful to not touch it."
Alyson Lei M.,"San Diego, CA",45,240,64,1.0,4/24/2017,"I'm not sure what I ate from here but I just left like 45 minutes ago and I feel sick to my stomach. I'm not going to go into details because it would be inappropriate to share but that's ALL I can say. But I'm almost 100% sure it's from the Calamari because I didn't eat anything else except for Wings. Plus, our server asked us if we wanted to go boxes like 10 minutes after we got our food. Um, rude much? Never coming back."
Walter R.,"Escondido, San Diego, CA",9,199,18,2.0,6/12/2017,"Meh... Called in my To Go order 20 minutes before getting there, then called when in To Go parking space and was told it was ready...waited close to 15 minutes, thinking they forgot me, I called again and then the person came out. Server was really nice and friendly. Pizza just okay.  Wouldn't get again."
Marieli M.,"Fontana, CA",8,42,3,1.0,9/23/2017,"No good  We sat at the bar area, our waitress was very nice but overworked so the service was no good and slow. We order an appetizer (fried calamari) and they came so late, they looked like trey had been seating at the kitchen for a while, they were hard like rubber, burnt and no taste, we send it back and ask to be removed from our bill. Took another 25 min later and finally we got out entrees. This location service is terrible all around it."
Raven L.,"San Diego, CA",0,7,,2.0,12/10/2017,I have been to this BJ's on several occasions because they have great food and the restaurant is clean but every time I have gone here hoping the service will get better it only gets worse. On my most recent occasion It took 20 minutes just for a waiter to ask us if we wanted water and then after that It took another 20 for them to take our order AFTER we had asked several times. Even after all this no one ever apologized or tried to compensate us for waiting almost an hour just to get food.
Matthew H.,"San Diego, CA",0,8,1,5.0,10/16/2017,"BJ's has stepped up their game and fixed some major issues that had me avoiding this location for a while. A couple months ago my family and I decided to give BJs another shot after about a year long hiatus. Why the hiatus? BJs had been plagued with slow service, poor wait staff, and delivered cold food. On our return visit, we found the wait staff to be pleasant, helpful, and feel they went above and beyond with. Having two young children, it was a nice surprise to find BJs brings out a snack plate for the kids. The food came quickly, was exactly what we ordered, and was cooked to perfection. We had such a great visit we returned again and had another great experience. We will be making BJs a regular family outing again."
Jessica G.,"San Marcos, CA",3,68,12,2.0,9/10/2017,"Visited BJ's this afternoon for a family lunch. It was not at all crowded. We were seated fairly quickly. The rest of the service however, sooo slow. Waited forever for appetizers, waited forever for our lunch and then waited even longer for dessert. We were there for over two hours for a late lunch in a non crowded restaurant. Nearly every table around us was empty.  To top it off, my order was wrong. I ordered blackened shrimp tacos and was brought shrimp and arugula tacos. Totally different. When I received the replacement, there were like two shrimps in the tacos. My sister in law ordered a sandwich with the dressing/sauce on the side. It didn't come on the side.  As far as taste goes, it was good. As far as service and attention to orders, it was awful. It was. A lunch with 7 people. I don't understand how that took over two hours when nearly every table near us was empty."
Abby T.,"Oceanside, CA",0,2,,5.0,11/9/2017,"From my previous experience with BJ's at the Carlsbad location was not the greatest, horrible service, very slow accommodating a family of 5. So,I wasn't expecting much since I was attending a birthday dinner. However, I was amazed with our server Mackenzie tonight, especially dealing with a party of 18. My go to appetizer is the calamari which were really good!  Mackenzie highly recommended the poki salad for my husband, which he was extremely satisfied! The menu has a good variety of delicious food! I think I'll be driving to the Escondido location from now on, even though I live in Oceanside."
Susan G.,"San Diego, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/7/2018,"The worst ""pizza"" in San Diego. Costco is better, especially for the price. Placed an online take out order for their ""Signature Deep Dish."" It's not deep dish, not by any stretch of the imagination. Did a build-your-own with sausage, pepperoni, olive, and garlic. The box it came in was a regular pizza box that wasn't nearly deep enough for a deep dish (first clue), the outside bottom of the box was covered in dried cheese, grease, and bits of dried food (second clue), and, even though we waited15 minutes for the pizza to come out, the box was cold as opposed to just-out-of-the-oven warm (third clue). Despite these red flags, we didn't open the box to review the contents before driving home -- which is totally on us -- or we would have discovered they gave us the wrong pizza -- olive, jalapeno, and tomato. Thirty dollars for a veggie pizza whose cheese had already turned hard and cold on the seven minute drive home (probably because it had been cold to begin with). Used to go to BJ's years ago when they actually did a decent deep dish, but times have changed, and so has BJ's. Don't bother."
Annie C.,"San Diego, CA",94,160,585,3.0,3/29/2017,"There's no wait at this place during lunch time. We stopped in for their deep dish pizza and pizookie. The server was very nice and we were seated right away. The place is pretty big with big screen tv's everywhere. We ordered 2 kids meals , 2 mini pizookies and a small BJ's special deep dish pizza. The pizza was served to us room temperature so that was disappointing but we were running behind for a soccer game so I did not Day anything to the server. Our kids enjoyed their meals so that was enough for me to keep quiet. The kid size pizookie is the best deal at $2.50 a piece and a kids sundae at $1.50?!! What's better than that?"
Leigh C.,"San Diego, CA",2,16,15,1.0,10/20/2017,"Just left without getting served. We were seated in the first table in the row right near the front. Every server and busser had to walk by us to get to the other tables and we were ignored for 15 minutes. No eye contact, no water, no acknowledgment whatsoever. We were a group of five. Three of us are over 6 feet tall and 225lbs+. HARD to miss! Maybe next time BJ's. I'm sure it won't be soon."
Jaylene R.,"San Diego, CA",367,253,256,3.0,1/24/2017,"I don't know what it is, but BJ's always has me coming back for more. It's not the best deep dish pizza in town, but it's good enough for me to crave it every once in awhile!! Tips: make sure you sign up for their rewards program--it's free, you get points for discounts, and you get emails about free Pizookie days among other deals. I also recently noticed they have a chalkboard outside with daily specials offered. The only one I recall off the top of my head is half off large deep dish Mondays.. UM, count me in!? They have a decent happy hour and I usually find a beer that I like when I'm here.  BJ's offers curbside delivery, take out, dine in, and bar seating. Personally I don't have a preference between bar and dine in seating, and I've had a good experience with take out as well.  Call me plain Jane, but one of my favorites here is the pepperoni 100 ways deep dish. They have julienned, whole slice, among other forms of pepperoni that comes out super crispy and delicious! Deep dish here always wins.  Do yourself a favor and make sure you order a Pizookie!? They have several options such as a trio sampler and several different flavors, some seasonal. I've tried several and personally I like to stick with chocolate chip because other flavors have been too sweet.  The service is just ok and it may take awhile for your waiter to come around or your drinks to be refilled but I will still be back to fulfill the craving."
Michelle A.,"San Diego, CA",0,10,,5.0,10/2/2017,Shoutout to our server Melissa !! Awesome services !!! Delicious pizza :)  Thank you for making this a great experience Melissa !
Bryan P.,"Collingswood, NJ",102,124,3,4.0,11/11/2017,"I can see why this establishment has a consistent line for a table. What a wonderful evening we had here. Great beer, great food and great service. We started the evening with Christopher as our server in the bar area. He was friendly and attentive. We enjoyed a variety of adult beverages and loved the beer flights (4 samples of any draft beers on the menu). Our evening continued with Heather who literally ""dropped"" in on us and made this evening amazingly special! She was amazingly friendly, vibrant, funny and beyond attentive. We had a deep dish pizza, a seared tuna salad and lemon-thyme shrimp (special order). All was prepared well and fit our needs. We ended the evening with their signature cookie and ice cream dessert. To make our nation's Heroes feel special, the restaurant offered a special price to all Veterans. I'm so glad we decided to spend the evening here. Thank you, BJ's."
Eden A.,"Los Angeles, CA",119,13,4,5.0,11/18/2017,"Jesse provided us with the best service tonight - super friendly and on top of everything! Refilled our drinks before even asking, didn't hover, gave us feedback on the food we were wanting to order and all around a positive experience. Thanks Jesse!"
Jonathan Z.,"Cypress, CA",595,1179,1175,3.0,7/5/2016,"On this trip to BJ's we had a nice group of 15.  My friend called an hour ahead to make sure they know were coming.  Once we got to the restaurant, it only took a few minutes for us to get seated.  Our group was separated into 3 tables, but we were all in the same area.  Even in our own table we were able to get separate checks, which was really convenient.   Normally, I would order a delicious pizza, since it was just me I went for a bacon cheeseburger.  They asked for my preference and I asked for rare.  What came to me was a nice burger that was medium at best.  I didn't want to ask for a new one because I was hungry. I order the shoe string potato fries, but those were a little on the limp side.  For my drink, I got a vanilla craft soda.  Those were refillable too!   This BJ's experience was a 2.5 for food and 3.5 for service.  3 stars."
Jonel S.,"San Diego, CA",315,13,2,3.0,7/11/2017,"Had dinner here with a good friend. She ordered a California Chicken Club, and I ordered a House Top Sirloin. Cons: -The server got my friend's order mixed up with another item on the menu (failed to confirm) -I ordered my House Top Sirloin Medium Well, it came out as Well Done, my food was dry and tasteless (but I was hungry so i devoured the beast) Pros: -Our server was really nice, she comped out my friend's California Chicken Club -She also gave us free fries (which was pretty dope) Overall Service: 4/5 Food: 3/5 Ambiance: 4/5 This place is quite pricey, the House Top Sirloin with two alcoholic beverages was $52.00 (excluding tip)."
Sarah F.,"San Diego, CA",54,8,1,5.0,2/4/2017,"We've never had a bad waiter at this bj's. We had Frank tonight and he was amazing, so friendly, fast, and accommodating!!! If the amazing pizza and pizookie's don't have us coming back for more the servers will for sure, especially Frank!!"
Nick M.,"San Diego, CA",1,64,8,1.0,11/20/2016,"My girlfriend and I came here at 8pm on Saturday night. Seated quickly but it took forever for our server to come, which was okay because as first timers we needed to take our time looking at their EXPANSIVE menu. Our bill after a 17% gratuity was $63. We each had a drink. Their small house margarita is $8.95 The guacamole appetizer was amazing but the chips were way too salty. She had the mahi-mahi and shrimp dish with rice. I had the cali chicken club sandwich with terrible thin fries.  After our $63 dollar dinner, I went to IN N OUT burger for a $4 double double for dessert because I wasn't even close to full. Portion sizes do not reflect the menu prices. Its a shame Elephant Bar in San Marcos closed. It made this place look foolish!"
A-Aron S.,"San Diego, CA",12,115,277,4.0,10/20/2017,"Always fun to eat at this restaurant. Happened by here by accident and it was worth it. So many choices of food! Just updated the menu and really have everything you can ask for. I tried the new chicken fried steak burger. Not very good. Also the Calamari wasn't very good either. The batter was not tasty.  Corndog bites were good. The flat bread pizza was awesome! Pizza seems to be the best reviewed item, for good reason. I will be back in a few months to try more."
Nikunj B.,"San Diego, CA",7,33,,5.0,10/12/2017,Jesse was our server during happy hour. We ordered crispy cauliflower and brew house burger . The whole experience was very good and we liked the food. Our server was very prompt and friendly. His suggestions were perfect
Eric K.,"San Diego, CA",0,4,,5.0,10/25/2017,Terrific service and great food.  Adam aka phenomenal manager helped with the service and made sure we had a great dining experience.  Thank you!
Michelle D.,"Vista, CA",0,13,7,1.0,10/25/2017,"Honestly the customer service was terrible. The waitress was rude and I had to ask several other staff members for items that she could have easily brought to us (straws, ranch napkins etc ). I didn't mind because I was with my friends , but After she had to reprint our receipt because we wanted to split and was giving us attitude about how we should know how we wanted the receipt I was upset. I understand if you have a bad day ,but being rude to customers for simple questions etc is not ok."
Stephanie E.,"Los Angeles, CA",31,18,3,1.0,10/8/2017,"This was one of the worse BJs I had ever been too. They took over 15 minutes just to give us our drinks. We where a party of 6 my sister order soup and salad and so did my dad. My sisters salad didn't get there till the pizza arrived. When my dad's soup and salad came at the right time at the beginning and then the soup after. I was also craving calamari just for it to be cold and not good at all people can get sick from this how is it possible you are serving this to your costumers. But definitely told our server it was cold and to take it off the check. Also our appetizers are supposed to be served while we are waiting for our food, they got there like 5 minutes apart from our regular food. Would definitely not be coming back here ever again."
Chelise W.,"San Marcos, CA",51,2,1,1.0,4/7/2017,Currently sitting at a table that took us over 40 minutes to get. I can understand that it might be busy on a Friday but the wait was inexcusable especially when we sat there and watched two other parties of similar size get sat before us when they arrived after. When we finally got to the table  It took another 20 minutes to have our drinks and appetizers served to us and forgotten. At this point there are 5 other tables eating. The bartender was helpful and our waitress was very nice but I was disappointed with the rest of the service. Will be hesitant when deciding to come back again.
Karen N.,"Escondido, CA",561,252,3899,2.0,2/20/2016,"Don't come here unless you have a lot of time. It will take longer than it should, even if you call ahead to put your name on the list. Every single time, lunch or dinner, I am amazed by how much time has passed when I go to leave. We had to wait more than 30 minutes for dessert once, asking repeatedly where it was. Today luckily we had a coupon for Buy 1 entrée, get 1 free. We got 2 ribeyes, trying to get the most value out of our coupon. One of our steaks looked completely different, like a sirloin. I said something to our server Stephanie, and she went back to check with the kitchen. Their response was that the steak is weighed, and the same size. Yeah, still not convinced. Ribeyes are round, not triangular. The food is decent most of the time. The asparagus is usually tough. The steak knives tear your food, maybe bring your own. Pizza and dessert are good, and some of the small bites. We got takeout a week ago (another free offer). It was fairly fast, maybe 15 minutes or so. The BBQ chicken salad isn't as good as CPK, get it there instead. Potato skins were good, but a little light on the toppings. It is also often dark, cold, and very loud. You do a lot of ""What?, I can't hear you"". Our server Stephanie was very nice, putting up with my requests and flagging her down repeatedly. Luckily they put your server's name on your table slip, plus any discounts you are eligible for with the rewards program."
