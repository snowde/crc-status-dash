Jeff J.,"San Diego, CA",0,1,,5.0,7/31/2016,"My wife and I came into the restaurant Saturday night and sat in the bar area since the restaurant was busy. our server was Stephanie, she was friendly persoanble and had a great overal attitude. we asked many questions about the happy hour drinks and food and she was able to answer all questions with lots of detail, it was pretty busy and she was still very attentive and on top of everything. our drinks came quick as well as our food. everything tasted great and my overall experience was A+. I normally never write reviews but the service was so good that it made me take the time to write a review. next time I come in I would love for Stephanie to be our sever again! thanks BJ's"
Austin C.,"Escondido, CA",0,3,,1.0,1/24/2017,"Natalie was our server and we had atrocious service. As a worker in the industry I understand a high volume of customers can lead to longer wait times, but the experience was terrible. Natalie, our server, completely neglected to provide anything close to good service for two simple orders. It took at least 10 minutes to be greeted and then 5 more to receive a water and tea. After eating our meal which tasted good, we ordered dessert, which we never received.  We sat there for 20,minutes waiting for a mini dessert dish. We had to check out with a different employee because the check presenter was sitting there for so long. The service was very neglectful, which is worse than slow service."
Zue W.,"Cathedral City, CA",33,210,737,5.0,6/20/2015,"Thomas our waiter was a awesome he made sure we had everything perfect even tho"""" it was super crowded and super busy our food was great as always it is always a pleasure to come in and find great service good food."
Cliff P.,"Pleasanton, CA",7,97,31,1.0,3/18/2015,"I really can't understand why this place gets any business at all with the exception of the foot traffic from the mall.  Tonight we went in and after waiting for a table we ordered some appetizers. I ordered the tortilla soup but never got a chance to try it because after waiting more than 10 minutes for my waitress to return so I could ASK FOR A SPOON we walked out. At that point, the chips were soggy and I'm sure the the soup was cold. The worst part was the manager walked by me at least three times without so much as an acknowledgement. If you notice someone eyeing you and trying to get your attention, wouldn't you stop to ask why? Needless to say, I finally walked to the front of the restaurant to confront him and ask for a spoon at which time he offers no apology and disappears???? Ok I guess you guys can keep the soup and my wife's salad.  Adiós!"
Melody S.,"Escondido, CA",0,11,4,2.0,7/17/2016,"We called ahead and seated within 10 minutes on a Saturday around 6. Service was good but slow...Everyone enjoyed their dinner choices except one, the fish and chips, very small thin, dry overcooked pieces, the tartar sauce was tasteless. We had to wait too long for the bill."
B D.,"San Marcos, CA",2,42,106,3.0,7/7/2015,"The wait to get a table was quick but once we were at the table the service was horrible. The beer was good, I tried the peach beer.. The food was good but again bringing food, drinks and I asked for ranch, the food was cold before they brought the smallest cup of ranch."
John H.,"San Diego, CA",129,13,28,2.0,6/29/2015,Great beer selections but it was little over priced. Food was just ok.. i just want to pay for their anbience. i think Nordstrom Cafe is better. not recommend dinner here. May be after work..
A B.,"Escondido, CA",0,9,,5.0,1/9/2017,"We were served by Katie tonight! 5 stars because she was so sweet and took the best care of us. Sounds like she was new, but our drinks were always filled on time and every request was dealt with promptly. I've been coming here for years and she was definitely the best server that I've had by far. Thank you Katie!!"
Sarah M.,"Escondido, CA",50,119,236,3.0,5/13/2014,"Service is never consistent here. Sometimes it's great, sometimes it's meh. But you can never go wrong with the appetizers and deep dish pizza. And the beer!! Love the seasonal pumpkin spice beer. Grab a glass once October rolls around.  If you're wanting to come on a Friday or Saturday evening, call ahead!! Definitely if you have a bigger party!! My go to restaurant for any weekend!!"
Randy S.,"San Diego, CA",215,137,471,2.0,4/27/2015,"Come because you hear its good food... but leave before you get it because of the service. Pros: Entrees are good. Especially the pizza and bazooki (dessert pizza). Multiple TVs with main sport events Bar area is pretty chill. Not that crowded at this location. Cons: Service - both host area and waiting staff. Too many stuff to put. Parking - not really that bad, it just shares the same lot as North County Westfield mall, so beware of crazy drivers/parkers. Appetizers - hit or strikes... mostly strikes Pre-game disclaimer: First off, since this is a franchise, i wont get into too much of the taste of the food because they ""should"" all be similar... unless drastically different.  For the detailed review,  im going off my multiple times i have been there.  Pre-game night scenario that made me write this review: It's a semi-cold and rainy evening/night in SD. Was set to have a dinner with my partner and her brother, yay. We anticipated a long wait because it was a Friday night, but we didn't anticipate it bejng Prom night. So along with families waiting to be seated, there were groups of ""high fashion"" prom-dressed students waiting eagerly to get their grub on and head to their dance (... why would you go to BJ's for a ""fancy"" prom dinner?! Idk).  Pitching against BJ's... Randy's review!!! Host area: please be honest. If it is going to take about a number of minutes to be seated, it is alright if it is off by +/- 5 or 15 minutes.  If i am told 30 minutes, i am expecting to bs seated no later than about 45 minutes... not be seated after 1 hour.  I understand maybe it is one of those nights where it is busy, hell, its prom night. You would think that since more and more people are packing the lobby the wait time would increase... nope. The host person would tell every group ""it will be about 30min, give or take a few minutes""... yeah... give or take about 1 hour.  Server: most people would agree with me (maybe, i don't know you so yeah, whatever, keep reading) when i say service will make or break the time and reputation of a place. And i fully understand being under stressful and crowded times where a server or worker might forget to check in with a customer/guest.  My friends would say im a very patient guy, even when i am ""hangry,"" so i will yield a few strikes before opting people out...  Counting the couple of times i have been to this location, i got this type of service: Young and overwhelmed - not all young servers/workers are like this... it just so happened the times i came here, i had this. Ball one!... not their fault thise nights were hectic. Passive aggresive - we ordered our drinks and appetizers, then we were asked if we were ready to order entrees. When we said we would need a minute, a look of ""come on really?!"" Accompanied with their eyes rolling as they walked away... strike one! Shortly after receiving our drinks, our appetizers and sweetners/sugars were dropped off... literally dropped.  Food shifted and sweetners and sugar came out of the can. Strike two! When given our drinks and appetizers, the server quickly left without taking out entree order and quickly went to another table to take their orders... mind you, it is a table that came after us and had more females. Strike three! Okay... this is how patient i was... i waited for 1 more strike. Yeah. My ""out"" equals 4-strikes. And what happened?... server walked by me when i put my hand up to get their attention. I understand if i just rose my hand right when they were next to me, but the server was 15-20 yards away, looked at me, and quickly turned away walking towards me with their head facing to his left... really?! I dont think i am anywhere near intimidating, if anything that was my brother-in-law. Strike four = bad review.  Realizing they messed up or they were going to get a bad tip: after all that, my group was pissed. We only got our drinks and appetizers. No plates with the appetizers. And not even our entrees ordered. So my brother-in-law actually got up and went to the back go get plates for ourselves. When our server saw him walk back with plates you can see the ""$*** i messed up"" look on his face. Everything after that, they tried to make things better, but not even admit ""sorry for the delay"" or anything like that.  Did anyone step their game up? Yes, actually. Someone did. And it was the food runner or kitchen staff from the kitchen (they were wearing an apron when they brought us our entrees). Kudos to you kitchen staff. Half-star to you.  Food: Its good... its good enough just to make this review a 2-star review from a 1-star if it was only based on service... but i want to be nice.  Would i come back?  Most likely not. If i do, it would be only if im in the area, craving pizza, and between 2pm-4pm during the weekday.  Am i being too nice? Yes...  yes. I. Am."
Victor B.,"Escondido, CA",36,163,388,5.0,4/5/2016,"For the price and great service, this place is worth frequenting. The atmosphere at this late hour in the evening was quite pleasant and quaint with the staff eagerly willing to assist in servicing our needs. We had a party of 10 and out came our food fresh, inviting, and tasty!"
vince r.,"San Diego, CA",46,1,,3.0,11/11/2016,Water down shots and flavorless burger. One plate had old ketchup on it. Unacceptable
Kaycee R.,"Buena Park, CA",0,2,,5.0,5/7/2016,"I came to BJ's with my family to celebrate my Birthday. Our server Jade made my day so special. She did an amazing job helping us choose our meals and how to order them. We got nacho chips instead of flat bread, and upgraded to some great salads. Jade even brought me My own birthday pizzookie!"

Robin P.,"San Diego, CA",79,173,53,4.0,5/10/2015,"This Cheesecake Factory isn't as good as the one in Fashion Valley mall.  But it's closer to our house so we go to it because we still like the food and desserts.  The waiters aren't as attentive to requests and the food isn't always inconsistent...   This review is about our last visit there: Came here for Pre-Mother's day dinner.  It was very busy.  Got there at 4:10ish and had to wait for 45 mins for a table.  They take your phone number and text you when the table is ready so that  is convenient.  We were able to go window shopping in the mall while waiting.   We got a table outside.  Which was very nice.  Ordered the kids lemonade but the waitress put it in as full orders.  :(  Hubby got a beer and I got a pinapple moscow mule which i liked. Then we ordered the kids corn dogs to share with 2 ketchups and one 1 came out so we had to ask for another ketchup again.  That happens often... I got the steak medallions with mashed potatoes, asparagus, mushrooms, and tomatoes.  Very yummy.  Highly recommend it.  The steaks were nice and tender.  I was able to cut it with a butter knife.  I asked for it to be medium rare, but they were more like medium.  Hubby says it's hard to cook medallions since they are so small.  But they were still very good. Hubby got the tuscan chicken which he really enjoyed as well. For dessert we got the lemon raspberry cream cheesecake.  It has a cake bottom instead of graham cracker which I really liked.  We actually got this to go and ate it at home. Note for families about the mall - If you have kids with you, the mall has a play area and train.  We didn't do the train but we did go to the play area.  It was really crowded with kids.  They have also added family room (where mom's can go to breastfeed) and kids can watch TV or play with a couple toys while waiting.  The family room also has it's own bathroom with kid size toilet."
Gabriella V.,"San Diego, CA",60,67,81,2.0,6/7/2015,Their pizza is really good and their wings are alright. The pazzukies are really good. The service kinda sucks here tho.
Dee K.,"Escondido, CA",0,18,1,1.0,2/27/2016,"Horrible reception, inept waiters and aweful food. Unfortunately many of our out of town guests insist on going there despite our warnings. They only visit once and never again. We've literally never had a meal without incident. Seating takes hours on weekends. The waiters always screw up your order, sometimes multiple times. Food shows up plain wrong or inedible."
Brian W.,"Escondido, CA",45,22,7,4.0,2/18/2016,"Always a good experience!  Always busy, but work the wait.  Missing one star because your hostesses are snooty and do not acknowledge your customer's existence until they are good and ready to do so"
Joyce B.,"Oceanside, CA",109,47,110,4.0,3/8/2014,"Came around 9 pm on a Wednesday night with the bf. No wait, but no hostess at the front either. When she finally showed up, she seemed annoyed, but the business was slow. We were given a booth on the opposite side of the bar area...I wish she would've at least checked to make sure the seats had the previous diners' food cleaned off. She stared at me as I wiped food particles off the booth. No bueno. When our waiter Chuck greeted us at our table, he was so friendly and eager to please (this made up for the not-so-friendly, not-so-clean-conscious hostess).  We ordered the pint-sized PM Porter and Wyders Pear Cider which both came out in a timely manner. Shortly after, our appetizer arrived- Traditional Chicken Wings (10 wings in buffalo sauce served with ranch, extra sauce, and celery for $9.75). We also ordered a medium deep dish BBQ Chicken Pizza ($20.95).  The wings were amazing, deep-fried goodness with just the right amount of buffalo sauce and ranch drizzled over the top. They wear seasoned nicely and cooked really well. The pizza was good and had a load of toppings. There was some excess BBQ sauce which made it a little too tangy for me and slightly soggy.  Chuck the waiter was on top of things and made sure to refill drinks and check on us often. It was a slow night and staff was getting ready to wrap things up for the night, but he never rushed us. Without Chuck, I would've given this BJ's 3 stars for the not so pleasant hostess."
Angel R.,"San Diego, CA",249,133,173,4.0,3/23/2014,"I don't go here as often anymore, but I will make occasional visits. When I used to come here often it was for drinks with friends. We never sat at the bar, since the bar wouldn't accommodate the amount of food that we would order. Sometimes several plates or appetizers, and sometimes we would be really hungry and order meals along with drinks. One thing that keeps me coming back to BJ's is their Top Shelf Margaritas...upgraded with Patron of course! The bartenders at BJ's make the Top Shelf Margaritas PERFECT here; the perfect balance of citrusy/sour, good kick of tequila (not overbearing at all!), and ice. Yes, they didn't overdo it on the ice - how is that possible? Their Raspberry Lemon Drop Martini, is pretty good; but watch out, sometimes the bartenders will pour this little martini strong, rendering it impossible for either Anthony and I to finish it. And we usually like our drinks with a nice kick to them! Also the beers are very good here! The Hefeweizen is yummy with a slice of lemon, and so is the Jeremiah Red! As far as food is concerned, I haven't explored their menu in it's entirety because it's HUGE. I wouldn't consider it a menu even, a pamphlet would be more appropriate. Anyways I'm a creature of habit, so I stick with what I like and familiar with. I always enjoy the Caprese Salad, Ahi Poke, and Calamari as appetizers. For entrees I enjoy the Balsamic Glazed Chicken, Roast Beef Dip sandwich, and Lemon Thyme Chicken. The portions are always gargantuan, and I always have leftovers to take home. Makes for a yummy, substantial lunch at work! And what is a review for BJ's without mentioning their coveted pizookies? The Red Velvet one is me and Anthony's favorite. The White Chocolate Macadamia Nut pizookie is really good, and so is the Baked Beignet. I'm not too fond of the Double Chocolate or the Cookies N Cream pizookies - WAY TOO SWEET for my liking! And honestly, I rarely have any room to indulge in these because I'm always substantially full, and I don't like overstuffing myself. Since then I've learned to just come here for solely for the pizookie! No more, no less, and very enjoyable. You know, despite the reviews on this place, I have always legitimately enjoyed myself at BJ's. The waiters and waitresses were always very nice and helpful. Whether it's for lunch, dinner, or getting drinks, BJ's hasn't disappointed me yet."
