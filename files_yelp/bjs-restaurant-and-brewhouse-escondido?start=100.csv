Natalie N.,"Oceanside, CA",0,18,,5.0,10/9/2016,"Friendly from start to finish, even while being so busy. Pizza & multi-pazookie was fab. Really appreciated Apothic Red was an option on wine menu, though it was hard to decide between that or Malbec. #Options #Cheers"
Robert J.,"Escondido, CA",20,216,273,1.0,3/10/2017,"This place has long wait times, horrible customer service, horrible food presentation and hi prices all awesome reasons why NOT to come here. I won't  be back!!"
Jonathan N.,"San Marcos, CA",27,1,,2.0,5/14/2017,"I went here for mothers day with my mom and brother. The drinks and service were pretty good, but the food was another story. The dressing was missing from my fish tacos. Essentially it came out as just dry fish+salad in a tortilla. I was going to send it back but my mother didn't want to cause a scene. I sucked it up and salvaged it by drowning the tacos in salsa. I'll settle for leaving a note and this review instead."
B. L.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,39,1,4.0,11/12/2016,"Really want to talk about our server in the bar, Edwin. We have had him before and he is the nicest, friendliest guy ever. Greets you with a smile, is helpful with the menu and keeps checking back.  The apps were great, esp the avocado egg rolls ! Salmon on Quinoa perfectly cooked.  Love the choice of craft beer .... bustling atmosphere."
Jen B.,"Lodi, CA",0,39,,2.0,3/8/2017,"Grilled chicken alfredo -- no flavor, noodles clumped together, and my broccoli was raw. Was eating with a work colleague and did not want to appear ungrateful for the lunch invitation.... but this was a really bad experience. Not sure I'll return."
Chelsea E.,"San Diego, CA",0,5,,3.0,4/11/2017,"I really enjoy Bj's for being a corporate restaurant. The food tastes really good, there are many options to choose from and they have a great happy hour. I gave them 3 stars because they are very inconsistent. I ordered a chicken quinoa bowl one day and it was the best thing I've had, I finished the entire bowl (and it was a lot of food). The next time I ordered it, I was so excited, but when it came to the table the chicken was over cooked and the rice was not cooked all the way through, it was hard. Mind you this is a quinoa bowl and it was rice not quinoa, I was disappointed to say the least."
Christopher B.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,3,,1.0,1/20/2017,"My experience at this restaurant was one of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had in my entire life. My party of 8 arrived at 0730, we were seated promptly and had our drink order taken right away.  They brought out 4 of the 6 drink orders around 10 minutes later and took another 10 minutes to bring out the remaining 2 drinks. We then proceeded to wait 20 minutes for our waiter to return to take our food order.  The waiter only took half of our orders and returned slightly later to get the remaining food orders. I received my plate a full 20 minutes prior to the rest of the table! Seriously, there were 3 orders for salads and my salmon dish came out 20 minutes before theirs. By the time the rest of the table received their orders, the salmon dish was cold and I asked to have the dish reheated only to have it be the worst dish I have ever ordered. The server at the restaurant offered the table free desserts instead of providing the service that restaurants are supposed to have.  Worst BJ's ever!"
Elona G.,"Poway, CA",150,6,4,4.0,4/10/2016,"Try the Schiracha Brussels sprouts! Good and healthy. The ahi tuna salad was yummy as well!  Came here during lunch hour and the service was quick.  Also, they divide your entrees for you when you tell them you're sharing!"
Nick H.,"Orange, CA",269,40,40,2.0,5/25/2016,"I went to this BJ's this past weekend on Friday night, so given, it was crowded. We only had to wait 20min which wasn't too bad for a Friday night but the hostess skipped our name several times, calling up other parties of the same size who showed up after us. Finally, we approached the hostess stand and she blamed it on a broker beeper...not a good start to the night.  We were a given a table in the middle of the restaurant but no one checked on us for 15min! No server introduced themselves or anything, until a friendly server/bus boy helped us out. Eventually our server for the section came by and served us. She was friendly and said there was a miscommunication amongst servers. Ugh.. Finally we ordered and our food came very fast, which was nice! My gf and I ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken with mash potatoes and broccoli. It's always a good meal and have never been let down, until this experience. Chicken and potatoes were good, but the broccoli wasn't cooked or anything. It was like it came straight out of the ground. It was really bad, dry, inedible to say the least. Our server apologized and offered to replace the broccoli with a different side which we did, fries. Nevertheless, I was quite disappointed with this experience and may go back one day. BJ's has always been great, just not this night."
John M.,"Escondido, CA",160,11,,5.0,4/3/2017,"Went there on Friday 3/31 and Sunday 4/2 and were seated immdedialtey.  I had the Prime Rib weekend special and it was spectacular.  The ""Wedge"" and ""Portobello.and Asparagus"" salad were both very high quality and delicious.  Side of Asparagus and Roasted Brussel sprouts were also very good.  The Prime rib was a hefty cut and cooked perfect medium rare.  Every bites was delicious.   Service is always great with very attentive servers and a great choice of the best craft beers in town.   I will be going every weekend if they continue to have the Prime Rib special."
Madele F.,"San Diego, CA",110,7,,1.0,8/18/2017,"I swear if I could give this place no stars, I would not hesitate. The server was all over the place, they had a serious attitude and the food was terrible. I went with a fairly small group of maybe 5 or 6 for a friends birthday and when I ordered the fettuccini alfredo they brought everyone's food but mine. I asked 3 times where it was and for some reason no one had a clue. Eventually they remembered but 2 people came out with the same dish at hand. Clearly poor communication between workers in the back. I felt bad thinking one plate might have to go to waste. The fettuccini was god awful. I could make better pasta in my kitchen. The sauce was literally water with absolutely no flavor whatsoever. Many other things were screwy throughout our night including our waiters inability to split the check into 4 properly (it took him about 4 trips back and forth between our table and the receipt printer to get it right) The pizookies were really good though. I can't complain about that. I guess that's where the one star comes in."
Margarita M.,"Escondido, CA",0,1,,4.0,7/6/2017,"I'm a regular at the Escondido location ( usually at the bar) but today I came to dinner with my bf, his parents and my 2 brothers, our server Dwanlynett B (#228) she went above and beyond with her service and attentive care. From now on I will only sit in her section. Her attentiveness to our needs was on point!!!"
Steph C.,"San Diego, CA",101,4,,5.0,3/24/2017,"Came here for lunch with my co workers. Anna was our sever, she was amazing! Truly one of the best services I have ever received (at any restaurant). I will come back just for her! Good job, Anna!"
jc s.,"Northridge, CA",0,10,2,1.0,10/16/2016,"How disappointing. Before we ever sat down... I would say to the dismissive staff at BJs SanMarcos If you are not interested in seating a large party, then tell them ""we can't handle you""  Why would you tell us twenty minutes? Then take over an hour?  How could you seat party after party that came in after us? We won't be back"
Sophia D.,"San Marcos, CA",21,3,2,5.0,4/11/2017,"Even though the front desk was sort of smug, our waiter waited on 30 of us and did an excellent job taking care of us. Thank you Thomas! Amazing service"
Tasha J.,"Stafford, VA",36,13,2,4.0,8/13/2016,"We've been sitting here for 30 minutes, literally, waiting for food.   UPDATE*** The waitress and manager noticed how ling we had waited patiently for out food and took care of our entire bill.  It took a very long time for our food to finally be served, but they took care of everything before we could even complain and the manager was very apologetic.  Not that we went out seeking a free meal, but it was very nice of the manager to compensate us this way especially without us even having to complain.  They caught their own mistakes.  Very satisfied customer.  We actually returned two days later to use our gift certificate and the service was friendly timely, and the food was delicious, no complaints."
Luis Enrique R.,"San Diego, CA",222,117,483,1.0,7/13/2016,"Terrible garlic Parmesan boneless wings & syrupy sticky mixed drinks. That was enough to not want to order anymore food (see pic). The presentation and taste was atrocious: regular breaded chicken nuggets that seemed to come from a frozen bag just heated and tossed in a sauce that wasn't meant for the wings since it was runny, clear, milky and exposed the wing. All the Parmesan was on the plate didn't even coat and stick on. The wing was extra salty and between the two of us we only had 1/3 of the serving portion. When you bite into the wing it's all bread and no chicken. Seems like it's an overly commercial restaurant who doesn't pay attention to quality rather focus on the numbers. Not a fan and won't come again."
Amber S.,"Poway, CA",1,32,8,1.0,3/3/2017,"Not even worthy of a one star honestly.. just horrible. Today was my first time at BJ's, I ordered off of the lunch menu. 'Grilled ham and cheese' which wasn't even melted! Too much ham. Just awful. Too much butter on the bread, overly greasy. Just thrown together. Wouldn't recommend BJ's."
Stephen H.,"San Clemente, CA",0,9,,3.0,2/12/2017,"This place looks nice from the outside and the food was OK, but the service was not very good. We had to wait a while for food and one of our guests had to wait an hour and so everyone else was done eating. Even then, they still got her dish wrong. Fortunately, the manager was extremely nice and apologetic and comped the meal do to all the problems. However, we would rather have had the service we expected and paid for our meal.  I will definitely give them another chance, hopefully it will be better next time."
Karen L.,"Escondido, San Diego, CA",55,87,8,5.0,1/1/2017,They have great pizookies desserts. The service is always perfect. The restaurant is nicely decorated and the excellent food quality is consistent. Thanks for the many great meals.
