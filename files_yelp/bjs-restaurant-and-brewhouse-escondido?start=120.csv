Nina B.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",786,145,1297,3.0,6/23/2016,"I used to love coming to eat here when I was younger. The quality of the food is poor. However, the environment is a pretty cool bar with lots of great Tv's and sports.  Plus, it is very pricey. I went here with my sister and the bill came out to $80."
Amy S.,"San Dimas, CA",30,118,331,3.0,9/8/2015,"Was craving a pizookie after our visit to San Diego safari park (~15mins away). We went for a late lunch around 2pm and no wait.  Did the 2 for $25 deal- 2 salads, 1 deep dish pizza and 1 pizookie to share. Awesome deal.  My tomato mozzarella was good. My bf got the Caesar and we just kinda mixed them together hah.  We chose the bj's favorite but ended up not being our favorite :( Choose this one if you love lots of veggie toppings. Just wasn't what we were feeling for plus it wasn't saucy at all. Wish I stuck to my guns and did the BBQ chicken pizza. Next time!  Classic Pizookie never fails!"
Adam B.,"North Park, San Diego, CA",0,4,,2.0,2/21/2017,"To start off, my family has been to this restaurant several times over the last five years and food is decent and service is at best hit or miss. Today we went to this BJ's and we were served by Steven W.  Steven was slow getting the water. I ordered the lunch special buffalo chicken grilled cheese sandwich and added the drink and ENDLESS fries for $1 extra. My wife got a pepperoni pizza and a wedge salad. The salad arrived 30 seconds before the rest of the food and had very little dressing, bacon or tomatoes. We asked Steven to get more dressing for us but it never arrived. The food was pretty decent but I soon ran out of soda and my wife ran out of water. We had to start drinking our kid's waters. We did not see Steven again until we were done eating. I wanted more fries but never had a chance to ask because Steven never came by. We would watch him talk to other tables, stand around, and walk very slowly from place to place around the restaurant. He had no sense of urgency and my wife had to take our kids to the car because we had finished and waited at the table 10 minutes just sitting there waiting for the check.  Once Steven delivered the check he realized his failure and gave me his goodbye speech even though I had not paid yet. I immediately put my card in the check holder but Steven had already walked away. I waited approximately 8-10 minutes for Steven to return to the table, he picked up the bill and card and went into the back. He reappeared without my card or the bill and slowly walked around the restaurant with no sense of urgency. Another 10 minutes went by before he returned with my check. I was a server for three years and my wife was a server for 5 years and neither of us have ever had such bad service. It took us an hour and fifteen minutes to eat two lunch specials and get out of the restaurant. I do not think I will be back to BJ's after this experience."
Robert J.,"Escondido, CA",336,515,153,3.0,7/22/2015,"It's all around good, but we don't eat here that often.  It's good food, but the overall experience is a little underwhelming.  It's great for that occasional quick dinner out with friends, when we want something close by. Good stuff: The pizza is great.  We almost always get pizza when we're here, and they do it very well.  It's deep dish style and I haven't had one that I didn't like.  I don't have much to report about other entrees. The menu is epicly long.  There's just too much to look through for one sitting.  They do have a full bar, but I've had mixed results with the strength of the mixed drinks here.  The beers are hard to go wrong with.  The wait can be hit or miss.  I don't eat here often enough to figure out when they're busy, so sometimes it's emptier than we thought, and others the wait is so long that we end up leaving. Service has always been average.  Never had an experience worth writing much about.  This last time we had to wait a little while to meet the server for drinks, and everything after that was standard.  I'll give it an A-OK"
Blah B.,"San Diego, CA",3,62,5,5.0,7/13/2016,"Bestie and I just had dinner here and the service we received from Stephanie who served at at the bar was just phenomenal. She was extremely attentive, patient and vey friendly. She is someone that deserves to be recognized as an example of how individuals in hospitality should carry themselves. From the minute we sat down she was inviting and consistently checked up on us while serving the many other customers. I don't go to BJ's often but I would go to this location because of the amazing customer service she provided!! Overall, excellent food and service! Don't forget to try the desserts; especially the cinnamon bread stuff with ice cream on top!!"
Chang L.,"Yokosuka, Japan",936,572,1110,3.0,6/11/2015,"Taste- ** Service- **** Ambiance- *** Parking- **** Came here with a group of 30, so have to give the servers props for handing the crowd. (yes, we made reservations) Since there aren't too many restaurants that can handle such a huge group, we decided to come to BJ's. There were some misses, orders were a bit slow to come out and a couple of us got overlooked at first, but overall it was pretty good. The servers worked really hard and were also successful in matching up all the parents and children sitting at separate tables.  The food was very greasy and mediocre. I ordered a bacon cheese burger, the beef was under seasoned, and overall not super delicious. This was the general consensus of the table. I also had a cookies and cream sundae which was pretty decent.  Overall the food wasn't that great, and the service was good. The restaurant can handle big parties and there is usually plenty of parking."
Nick B.,"Escondido, CA",0,11,,5.0,7/21/2017,"Really great food and service. Mackenzie was amazing, and made the whole experience comfortable. I will definitely be coming back. Try the avocado egg rolls!"
Victoria R.,"Oceanside, CA",512,262,346,5.0,2/25/2016,Our waiter was amazing. She was quick and refilled our drinks every time it was low. The location is great because it is by a mall and there is plenty of parking spaces. The menu is very big so you will for sure find something you like!! I am big fan of the great white pizza and of course their dessert... the pizzookie! They have many flavors!
Senior B.,"San Diego, CA",1,61,75,5.0,6/20/2016,"Christian! Was a very welcoming bartender and so was the young lady at the door! We ordered beers, the appetizers as my friends stalled I randomly order calamari! It comes out like a five star sea food beach front restaurant! Mad props to the cook! You three sold us on a big tab which when you work in the industry and you really appreciate well executed service and cooks! Thank you ! Thank you ! Thank you!"
X D.,"San Diego, CA",35,299,1247,4.0,5/6/2016,"I like this BJ's. Much cleaner than one in La Mesa and Mission Valley. Our order of jumbo spaghetti was more than enough to split. I recommend the calamari--- really good with dips. Our waitress was nice and attentive to our needs. Overall, I believe they did well today for our lunch order."
Christina G.,"San Diego, CA",8,30,,4.0,12/24/2016,This restraint has a nice lunch special.  The brussel sprout salad is delicious! At times the wait can be long.  They have a nice happy hour as well.
Charles L.,"Escondido, CA",0,19,2,1.0,6/26/2017,"First let me admit the food was good. But the service was soooo slow I won't go back. My family was seated right away, no wait so that was good. Then we sat for 20 minutes and no one came to our table, so my wife asked a busboy going past who our server was. He said he'd get her. We wait another five minutes and she comes to take our order but immediately stops and says her tablet has locked up, she'll be back. Okayyyyy. After five or so minutes she's back. We've now been there 30 minutes and just ordering. This goes on throughout the meal. Waiting on drinks, etc. we finally get out an hour and a half later.  Service so slow I'd never go back."
Amber G.,"Pittsburgh, PA",138,8,1,1.0,7/14/2017,"If I could give negative stars I would.Last night was the last time I will ever be visiting a BJs. A lot of people I know already don't go there because the service is ALWAYS bad but I still try to go because I really enjoy the beer and food. I have never been so angry at a restaurant before in my life. It took a long time for my mom and I to even get our order placed because the waitress came by to take it then said hold on and honestly disappeared for about 5 minutes. That is when we should have known to leave. My mom and I both ordered the same burger, the late night burger. After 30 minutes of placing our order our server comes up to us and says the kitchen just told me we are out of the late night burger. We have already been waiting for a little over 30 minutes and this is the first time we are hearing of this. She said the manager would be right by and we can place another order. So we put in another good order because we were starving. No manager ever showed up, then 2 minutes after placing our new order, the burgers we first ordered came out. We were confused. So they weren't out of the burger they just didn't want to make it? I cut into mine and it's cooked way over well done but I was so hungry at this point. The manager, Adam, finally waltz his way over to us. All he says awkwardly is, talk to me. I tell him my complaints and how the burger is over done, not once does he even try to say let me fix that for you. All he said was oh well we have those other 2 burgers you ordered cooking still, I snapped we don't even want those. After a highly awkward encounter, I don't know how he is a manager, he can't even talk to people. He walks away saying we will take care of you guys tonight don't worry. We ask for our bill both only eating half of the burger. My daughter is extremely fussy at this point and ready to leave since it's been an hour and half already (the waitress even made a comment oh she is getting loud and ready I can tell) I wanted to say to her yeah because this entire experience has been slow and long. The first bill we received had 4 burgers on it. They never took off the burgers we ordered in replace of the burger we wanted. She comes back with the corrected bill and nothing is taken off. Not even a single burger. So the manager lied straight to our faces. Luckily we had a coupon for buy one get one but our bill was still 30$ because we each had a beer. We finally left after 2 hours of being there. The service was terrible all around, the manager needs to get a new job because managing is definitely not his strong suite, and that whole staff needs to be retrained. They ran food to the wrong table 3 times while we were there. This place needs fixed up and Adam should not be a manager! What a waste of 30$."
Lila M.,"San Diego, CA",197,135,270,2.0,9/5/2015,Came to take advantage of the 2 for $25 deal.  Great large BJs but the service is sloppy and slow. Took a long time for everything. Food was comparable to all other BJ's.
Nathan J.,"San Diego, CA",2,11,3,1.0,7/9/2017,Went to have dinner on 7/9/17. Our waitress Adalie E did not check on us once during our meal. When she finally came to give us our check we asked if we can split the check evenly and she seemed a bit annoyed. It's 2017 so splitting a check is not new to this industry. We asked her if she can apply the rewards points to a loyalty card which we provided instead of the account that was on file (used the app to book seats so that's the account that was on the receipt). adalie went to charge us and came back saying the loyalty points were successfully applied to the card even though the receipt confirmed it was to the wrong account. When we wanted to confirm she walked away from us mid conversation as if she had more important things to attend to. I will not be recommending this place to friends based off this horrendous experience. What kind of waitress walks away from her tables when we're trying to ask a question?? Very unprofessional.
Princess J.,"Vista, CA",0,5,1,5.0,1/4/2017,"I went to BJs for a kids birthday party. The food was good, I had the spaghetti it was amazing. Our waitress Linda was such a sweetheart. She served the kids first which I particularly appreciated. Great spirit and great service! I will be coming back!"
Heather W.,"Escondido, CA",0,4,1,1.0,8/21/2016,"This place is trash. My food was cold, my waitress didn't even bring forks and I paid almost $100 for what? Shit service and food I could have cooked better and made more appetizing at home. The oh so lovely lady that hosted us didn't even care. I was at least approached by two wonderful ladies there, one was a hostess and the other was a different waitress, those two were exceptional. But when I have to physically walk up to the counter begging for a napkin....we have issues."
James C.,"Berkeley, CA",0,4,,1.0,3/26/2016,"Wouldn't even have given it one star. Save your time, money and patience.  Went out for dinner on a Saturday night. The restaurant was obviously understaffed, and those that were there were busy talking with each other about their personal lives.  Waited 30+ minutes before our buzzer went off. When we walked up, they took our buzzer and then asked us to stand to the side for another 10 minutes as they ""cleaned our table off."" When we were seated, the table had NOT been wiped down! There was still salt and water rings from the previous occupants. After waiting another 15 minutes with no service (not even being greeted by our waiter/waitress) we got up and left."
Julia W.,"Poway, CA",0,11,,1.0,3/26/2016,"I wish I could give this restaurant zero stars.  Unfortunately I can't review the food as we never got any. My boyfriend and I came to this location for dinner and when we went up to the podium to give them our name, they told us it would be about 15-20 minutes until we were seated. We sat down and waited for at least 30-40 minutes. We didn't make a big deal about this since it was a Saturday night. Our name was called and the girl calling the names said one of her coworkers would take us to our table.  We stood there waiting for about 5 minutes while her and her coworkers were having a conversation about their personal lives until my boyfriend, who was fed up at this point, asked if they were ready to seat us. The girl who had called our name told us they were waiting for our table to be cleaned off.  Finally after standing for 10 minutes of more waiting, one of the girls took us to our table. The table was still dirty when we sat down. It still had water rings from cups and salt on it, so obviously they hadn't been cleaning it off.  We had been sitting there for 5 minutes and no one had come up to ask us for or order or even what we wanted to drink. We waited for about 15 minutes as we watched a few people around us, who had been seated after us, get their order taken. Annoyed, we decided to leave the restaurant after wasting over an hour waiting.  It's pretty safe to say I won't be visiting this location again. In the past, I enjoyed going because they have pretty good food but the service here is absolutely terrible. The food is simply not worth it."
Brian G.,"San Diego, CA",0,18,2,3.0,2/18/2016,"Let me start off by saying we've been to this BJ's on multiple occasions, probably over 15 times in the past 6 years or so - this rating is based on a cumulative experience over those years. The service is really a hit or miss. Sometimes our waiters are awesome and super helpful with choices especially since the menu changes on a regular basis or because there is so much to choose from. Unfortunately, the service can also be a nightmare. On one occasion it took 45 minutes to get our food for a party of 8 and there was no feedback from our server other than ""it'll be out soon."" Most recently, we went on a Saturday afternoon around 4:30 for a party of 10. We were seated even before being assigned a waiter - we couldn't get anyone's attention to help us out and when we finally did, the waiter was surprised no one was helping and said, ""I guess I'll be your server then."" She was great, but it's stuff like that that you just have to question the service. The beer selection is great! So much to choose from, both in-house, local, and national. The in-house beer is OK, but I'll stick to the SD breweries instead. A variety of food to select from but it is often overwhelming. There is definitely something for everyone so it makes getting a large group together easy because everyone can have something they like. Only downfall? See the upper section about the service - it seems the more people in your group the more difficult the service. Overall, it's a chain restaurant that works and if we had another choice that everyone in the family liked, we would go there instead. I guess we're just comfortable with BJ's, I just wish their service was better."
