Myeisha E.,"Escondido, San Diego, CA",117,9,8,5.0,9/15/2017,"All I have to say was tonight was a very awesome night! It all started with our service, our service was absolutely amazing from a young lady named Dwan . She had an absolutely amazing personality from The beginning.. our tables that sat 16 people and she remembered every order... came back within two minutes asking if we needed refills or anything that we needed to so she was absolutely amazing the best waiter you could ever find.  If you come here please go to her.. yet our Service took a little bit longer than it should have so I went to the manager and told the manager that I didn't understand what was taking so long and he came to me and said  ""My name is Charles I'm the  general manager what can I do for you?"" I told him what was going on and he apologized and said I'm truly sorry and more so but his  personality was amazing ams customer service was beyond respectable and the way he carries himself made me feel like he truly understood how I  felt as a customer."
Adam L.,"San Marcos, CA",1,9,7,3.0,5/22/2016,"Great selection as usual for food. Beers aren't bad either.  We ordered boneless wings which could be topped off with some of the sauce it's cooked in. BJS Favorite Pizza was good except for the large onion pieces and some of them were the inedible outside of the onion. Kids Mac N Cheese could be house made as opposed to being just ""blue box"" Kraft Mac n cheese that goes for $1 at the store. The wife got the Ahi salad and the flavors were good and tuna cooked perfectly. However they drenched the salad to the point where you couldn't eat it really without it tasting like just dressing. Service here for me has always been hit or miss. Ultimately, IMO, you come for the pizza and stay for the PIZOOKIE!!"
Thom H.,"Vista, CA",330,140,105,2.0,3/27/2017,"We were there on a Friday night, it was a full house. I am glad that my son got there early to get a table. Our server was very friendly and helpful. Considering how busy they were it did not take very long to get our order placed. But it did take a long time for our dinner to arrive. And apparently it had been sitting for a while because my steak was lukewarm at best. The ribeye steak was tasty and a good size also it was cooked the way I like it. But it was very tough and I had to saw several pieces of it. It was not what I expected when I paid almost $25 for it. My sides were mashed potatoes and broccoli, the mashed potatoes were good and the broccoli was tender and tasty but a very small portion. Broccoli is cheap and I would've thought that they would've almost smothered the dish with it. I almost forgot, we had to ask for flatware. There was none on the table and none arrived with our meals. Which meant that we had to wait to eat because we had nothing to eat or dishes with. But the flatware arrived shortly after we asked for it. Well I return? Probably not in the foreseeable future because there are so many other places to eat."
Stephanie Z.,"Escondido, CA",116,248,377,3.0,3/14/2016,"BJ's is the place to go when nobody can agree on what they want. BJ's basically has everything. Their menu is huge! The food hasn't disappointed me. We typically spend about  $100 when we come here for our family- appetizer/desserts included. Their pazzoki's are amazing! Love their pick 3 deal. Service is usually great but last night service wasn't great unfortunately. It started out okay but once a large party was seated near us- we were kind of forgotten about. We had to ask someone else for drink refills, a plate for my boyfriends pizza (which took a while to come & was awkward since we all had our food & was eating). A chip refill because the $18 appetizer we ordered came with a large thing of spinach artichoke dip and maybe like 8 chips in a tiny cup (which doesn't make all that much sense to me why they do that but whatever), Our drinks refills and his plate came but our chips never did. We had to ask for it again at the end and just took it home.  We are not the kind of people to go and speak to the manager or make a huge deal and try to get anything comped- we just deal with it. However, we are 20% or more kind of tippers but in this case, we only left 18% which was still pretty generous considering the service. We are not jerks and know it's how servers make their money but at the end we both said to eachother that service wasn't that great tonight.  Maybe they should have someone else focus on smaller tables when a large party is sat??"
Rebecca T.,"San Diego, CA",0,10,,1.0,12/10/2016,"Food is good but they are extremely slow. We called ahead they told us 25 minutes and we waited over an hour. Everyone who walked in got seated before us!! After waiting 20 minutes for a server to walk over we waited 40 more minutes for our food, which two plates came out completely wrong and we sent one back twice and ended up with no food at all. Our waiter was extremely nice and felt terrible but other than that this place sucks!! The service was awful from the ladies at the front and the manager was no help either."
Danielle Q.,"Murrieta, CA",247,110,525,5.0,1/13/2016,"Came here for my friend's 21st bday with 7 other people. Even though there were so many of us, our waitress was very attentive, patient, suggestive, and sweet. We took while to order because some of our orders were complicated. The Birthday boy wanted Jambalaya but he wanted to substitute the rice for pasta and so our waitress, Amy made a few suggestions. She suggested him to add more sauce since the pasta will soak up the sauce which would make his meal dry. He also had a few questions regarding their beer as he was making his first alcohol purchase. He was going to get the beer flight, but she suggested to get their BJ's special which is served before 3pm I believe and it was a whole pint glass of beer which was a better deal. He ended up getting the special. I used the BOGO lunch entreé with my friend that I found through Yelp, but you need to have rewards card and so my friend signed up for one. Our food came out super fast. I got the GF sausage pizza w/ a Caesar salad w/out crotons lunch combo . It was a huge portion for a lunch combo so it was differently worth the price.  My friend got his free pizookie at the end since it was his birthday.  At the end, we all had to have separate checks, but Amy was very patient and good at her job. Mostly everyone at our table had a military ID and so they will give you a 10% discount.  Overall, very good service at our visit here."
Rich H.,"Escondido, CA",12,91,152,5.0,3/31/2016,"I ordered the Santa Fe salad with blackened salmon. The salad was pretty good but the salmon was very good. Our server, Dwanlynett, was outstanding. I brought my son who had a coupon for a buy one entree get one entree free which made the evening even better."
Lam N.,"San Diego, CA",263,60,8,4.0,2/14/2015,"First of, let me preface this with the fact that I've only been to the other Location in La Jolla so I will do some comparisons of the two. When I first walked into this location I saw that this location is huge compared to the location in La Jolla. The seating was spacious and there was plenty of tables. We were seated quick and our waitress brought out waters quickly. The customer service here was top notch and our waitress often checked on us. I originally ordered a craft beer that they had ran out of so the waitress suggested Grand Cru beer that was served in a bottle. I've never tried Grand Cru before so I opted to go ahead and give it a try.  The food was brought out promptly. I had the Roast Beef Dip with regular fries. BJ's is known for their Pizookie so they are good at making it, and make it well they do. (A Pizookie is basically a freshly made hot chocolate chip cookie with ice cream on top) The Location of this BJ's is situated in North County Mall on the outskirts neighboring Macaroni Grill. There is plenty of parking as you can imagine so parking should never be a problem even at rush hour. However, this place does get full to the brim during dinner rush so I would suggest coming a little earlier than dinner to get a table. From what I saw when I was there, the wait is not that long as they do have an abundance of tables. Happy hour is at the bar area only.  Overall, a good experience. Good customer service and good food."
Steve F.,"San Diego, CA",917,1167,5947,3.0,4/16/2014,"My best friend Kendra wanted to meet up this past Monday night to catch up, and as she lives near the area, she suggested BJ's.  While I had been burned by a past experience at the location near my girlfriend's place (here's my review:  ), I figured I'd give this location the benefit of the doubt. We started with an order of the calamari - this was quite tasty, what with the lightly breaded tentacles and rings along with the marinara and aioli sauces.  I could easily have polished off the appetizer on my own... fortunately Kendra was there to help out! Kendra ordered a mini Great White pizza: made with Alfredo sauce with mushrooms, garlic, seasoned tomatoes, Parmesan cheese and grilled chicken breast, this looked rather delicious, though she couldn't finish it. Meanwhile, I had gone with one of BJ's Enlightened entrees (both for the under 795 calorie count and the prices; most of the menu is rather overpriced, in my opinon) - their Barbecue Bison Burger.  This was made with lean, ground buffalo, boldly seasoned and grilled (mine was medium well), then topped with chipotle BBQ sauce, a seared green chili and pico de gallo, then served on a toasted bun with Baja sauce, red onions and lettuce.  It's also served alongside a tangy slaw tossed with Baja vinagrette and topped with green onions.  Surprisingly, this wasn't too bad - I've had buffalo burgers before, so I was used to the taste, and in fact I put the slaw in the burger to give it a little extra oomph. The venue itself is pretty roomy and clean, and the servers were quite attentive while we were there.  Also, BJ's has a revolving glass door... which I nearly bumped into while going inside. Not too bad overall, though those prices could be a bit more affordable.  Still, I can see myself coming back to this location for a happy ending - a happy ending in this case being a Pizookie!"
J M.,"Escondido, CA",0,50,5,4.0,4/14/2017,Always good food and good service. A little loud in the bar but that is as it should be. People having a good time and enjoying themselves!
Wendy H.,"San Marcos, CA",394,421,876,3.0,11/14/2015,"I had a weird experience that made me review this place once and for all. It seems that the food was good, the service was wonderful but the experience was sub par. Here is what happened. It was a Friday night so of course they are packed. We waited and seating opened up in the bar so we sat in there. We ordered our beers and were fine with the noise level of the bar except for some patrons which were playing their laptop at a very high noise level. My friend went to tell the manager. This is where it went left. I Don't want to put the wrong manager name so its the bigger dude with the beard. First off he tells her to hold on he is busy. STRIKE ONE, when a customer says there is a problem you face the customer. Next she asks him to please handle it, and allow the customers know politely its bothering us, and please turn it down. He told her he cant actually do that, so she came back and asked them herself. The customers were apologetic and did it right away! NO big deal, everyone is happy. Until... the manager walks over and checks on them! WTF? I say we handled it since you would not! He then turns his back on us and continues to talk to them. Never once talking or checking on us, and also making it into a bigger deal then need be since everyone was okay by then. A couple of patrons actually turned around and thanked us, because it was louder then the game.   STRIKE TWO is to ignore us. Then another manager (maybe the real one or GM) comes over and talks to them about it again. OKAY this is just getting embarrassing for everyone involved. Once again no one checked on us. Two chicks that threw down 60 bucks for dinner, and a really weird awful experience. I like the pazookie and our real waitress (wish I had gotten her name) was wonderful. BJs get it together or at least the guy that doesn't know how to handle customers. Booo for that."
Sam M.,"Palatine, IL",4,104,77,4.0,3/30/2017,The staff here was very attentive. The food was also very good. The place is very big has a lot of TVs And is a place that you would want to go during sporting events or games. It is actually kind of surprising how big it is cuz it does not look quite that big from the outside. We will eventually see you back sometime soon!
Bert C.,"Escondido, CA",51,24,6,5.0,10/30/2016,"Got helped by Jo, she was super friendly and the food was awesome as well. We had the Brussels sprouts to start and the Santa Fe salad and the both were amazing. To me service is just as important as food and she was awesome. Thanks Jo for being patient with us and super friendly, you made our experience a great one"
Idrees T.,"Murrieta, CA",3,12,1,1.0,4/11/2017,"Would give this review 0 Stars if I could. Let me preface this before and say that I NEVER complain no matter how bad the service is. Tonight, however was different. We arrived to bjs on a Tuesday night at 830 pm. We got sat very quickly, but that was the only good part of the night. My girlfriend and I sat there for 30 minutes and didn't even get a greeting to let us know that they acknowledged us as paying customers. I finally mustered up the courage to let the hostess now that we haven't even gotten water, let alone greeted. Another server heard this and she jumped to the occasion to help, even though it wasn't her section (she's awesome) . After finally getting our orders I thought that it was the turning point, well I was wrong. Not only did my girlfriend find TWO pieces of hair in her pizza, but I never even got asked if I wanted any more water or another beer (which I did). So after, I spoke to the manager RON. I let him know that I never ever complain at restaurants, but I just wanted to let him know how the service went. He joked and said, ""I'm glad I can make history"". Funny, but not the response I was hoping for. He said he would help with some of the bill, which I didn't care for but thought was a nice gesture. Turns out that nothing was done. Will never come back to this bjs again."
Jane J.,"San Diego, CA",43,68,7,1.0,2/13/2016,"What BJs runs out of certain pizookies?   You'd might as well run out of pizza.  Just tried to order a PB smores one, and they ran out.   Poor inventory.  Do not come here expecting the pizookie you're craving or you will be crushed just as I am, sitting here waiting for a boring chocolate chip one. Also, we were handed dirty water glasses as well as WET plates to eat our pizza off of. Management: I'm sending everyone to Cheesecake Factory because they have ALL their cheesecakes in stock.  And they'd plates are 100% clean and dry."
C S.,"Escondido, CA",0,23,,2.0,1/4/2016,"My fiance and I visited BJ's with 6 of our closest friends for our birthdays in November. I want to start this review by saying that we are a crowd of extemely lax people. We all have worked in customer service in some capacity, most of us have restaurant experience of some sort. To start, our server did not even come by the table to introduce herself (she will remain nameless, to spare her embarrassment) until 20 minutes after we were seated. I am not exaggerating. OTHER servers kept telling us she would ""be with us shortly."" When she did come, we explained immediately that we were all on separate checks, which I know can be a hassle--why we explained it upfront. She numbered us all off and told us to remember our numbers for the rest of our dinner. Mind you, none of us have a memory problem. I just thought this was extremely odd and very tacky. (She wasn't kidding. I forgot my number at one point, and she was irritated with me and had me repeat back everything on my tab so she could give me a new ""number"") We all ordered drinks at the same time. They all came out in a seemingly haphazard order, and separately. My friend's flight of beers came out before my easy-peezy glass of wine, and my fiance's mojitos (x3) all came out before my friend's first Long Island..?? Our food was no different. It came out haphazardly, though we all ordered at the same time. I'm not talking two-trips to the kitchen. I mean that all 8 dishes came out sporatically over the span of FORTY MINUTES. By the time I finished my food, my fiance was just getting his. We ordered the same dish. Now- my real beef. My brother ordered a sandwich and fries. SO easy. He waited 45 minutes. Then at the hour mark, we asked the server where it was. She quickly replied it was ""dead"" and there would be another up shortly. We asked the manager to please come talk to us, we had had enough. We calmly and politely explained the situation to her, and she retorted that she appreciated our concern, but the employee had done ""the right thing"" and she would be happy to offer it at a discount for us if we were truly upset by the situation. I'm SORRY. In WHAT WORLD does neglecting your customers' food to the point that it is declared ""dead"" and then putting in an order for a new one to correct your mistake count as ""the right thing""?!?  We weren't looking for any freebies. But a sincere, honest apology would have been nice. We will not be back. Shame, because we liked this place up until this experience."
Ricky L.,"San Diego, CA",362,25,113,2.0,1/20/2015,"Last week I had dinner with my girlfriend at BJ's for my birthday.  I wanted to go here because I enjoy the food and more importantly, I wanted to have some pizookies for my birthday!  Who wouldn't?  Unfortunately, my experience here was rather saddening.   Before we were seated, I went to the restroom.  While I was in the restroom, my girlfriend told the lady at the front table that she wanted to order the pizookie trio for my birthday before we were seated (so that she wouldn't have to order it in front of me and I would be surprised when it came out).   We were then seated and our orders were taken by the kind waiter.  As he brought out the appetizer, he also brought the pizookies.  We were confused because pizookies should come after dinner as a dessert.  We asked him to bring that back into the kitchen and my girlfriend was quite embarrassed now that the surprise was spoiled.  The waiter looked flustered as he had to return pizookies and his mood went south.  From that point on, our service from the waiter was very poor.  He did not check on us or even refill our waters.  He ignored us.  After we had our meal, the pizookies were brought back out and he just left it on the table and leaving my girlfriend to sing me happy birthday (I would have expected the staff to sing me a birthday song at least).  Needless to say, I will not be attending this BJ's location for my birthday anymore. Poor service aside, the food was great and the location was clean and very well maintained.  We had the calamari for the appetizer.  This crispy treat was served with both marinara and tartar sauce.  For the entrée, I had the parmesan crusted chicken.  The chicken was sliced thin and lightly crusted with parmesan.  The flavor was amazing.  This was served on top of hearty mashed potatoes; a perfect pairing.  My girlfriend had the jambalaya which was also delicious.  It was a big bowl of southern goodness.  The shrimp, sausage, rice, and spices were very fresh.  These 3 dishes are highly recommended.  Finally, we had 3 pizookies: chocolate, white chocolate macadamia, and oreo.  The chocolate was a little too sweet for my taste.  The white chocolate and oreo are my favorite and they are a must have! In conclusion, the food at BJ's was great as always.  However, in this particular case, the service was beyond poor."
Randy L.,"San Diego, CA",0,13,2,2.0,10/22/2016,"Service was good, drinks were perfect! BUT, I ordered the spaghetti and giant meatballs...or should I say mush balls...gross! Never again. I did not eat them, except for a few hard to swallow bites. I told the waitress they were mushy, and it was easy to see this, they looked like bits of broken up burgers, she said they would let the kitchen know. I will not be back. I've been to other locations and the food was great. Not so much at my local BJ's unfortunate."
Lynette A.,"Fallbrook, CA",0,1,,5.0,11/11/2016,"I would just like to say that I am new to Yelp but I created an account just so I could post this. Me and my husband went for dinner last night and the service was outstanding! ""Lauren"" I believe her name was, was so wonderful!! always kept up on the refills (and trust me I drink a lot of Pepsi) but every time mine was empty there she was with another one! She gave us great suggestions for appetizers that were delicious and she knew the menu front to back because despite that novel of a menu we still had plenty of questions, and she answered every one of them We will definitely be back next week asking for Lauren !  Lynette  Premier member"
Michelle G.,"San Diego, CA",0,24,1,4.0,5/11/2016,"I came here Mother's Day with my grandma (who's mental health is slowly declining), mom, sister, and dad. Although our waitress wasn't the most upbeat person, she was so flexible, understanding, and patient with my looney family and all the chaos going on during the restaurants peak hours.  I drink water like a fish and anytime I needed a refill not only was she available but she had the most amazing attitude about it (I know how annoying customer service can be sometimes)  The food was great! I had the pita chicken tacos (tooooooooo die for!!!!!!)  I felt a little overwhelmed with the amount of options they have so if you find what you want stick to it! Follow your gut here, you won't regret it ;)"
