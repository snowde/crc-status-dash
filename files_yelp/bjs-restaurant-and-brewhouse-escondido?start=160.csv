Cheri C.,"San Marcos, CA",2,13,9,5.0,10/15/2016,I had Meagan today. what an awesome girl. great service always a pleasure with her.
skinny m.,"Long Beach, CA",0,8,1,1.0,3/25/2017,If I could give you 0 stars o would! Burnt calamari one time and another time being told 40 plus mins after my order was placed it'd be ready!
Melissa N.,"San Diego, CA",1,46,4,1.0,5/6/2017,"I have been to other BJs locations and had a much better experience. The dining room is very noisy and dimly lit. I got a steak, mashed potatoes, and broccoli. The steak was okay, but the potatoes had a very long hair in it and the broccoli was raw. The waitress was always busy and it seemed like we were bothering her by trying to pay with the app that they offered a discount with. Not really worth the money or time."
Sally B.,"Escondido, CA",0,18,,2.0,11/3/2016,I will give 2 stars just because sometimes they get it right. The wait staff is usually very friendly and attentive. I have eaten here many times. Sometimes the food is great but many times its not. The first time I got stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer they were amazing! I've gotten them three other times and have not even been able to eat them. What happened?  Tonight I got the flat bread pizza as an appetizer and I think they just forgot the toppings. It was like a cracker with a couple of tomato and avocado pieces. So needless to say it went into the garbage as it was a takeout. Another time I ordered a hamburger along with my friend. His was ordered medium and was just slightly pink in the middle. Mine was ordered medium-well and it was just plain raw on the inside. I could go on but I won't. I hate to say I won't be back as I like their menu and when it's prepared correctly it's absolutely awesome! But that's getting to be about one every three or four visits. This food is too expensive to keep being disappointed.
David Joshua D.,"Valley Center, CA",111,204,1053,4.0,10/16/2014,"I came here with my wife just in time for happy hour. You get to just sit in the bar area and look for an open spot. We went on a Wednesday at 6:30PM. Happy hour is from 3-7PM Mon-Fri and 10PM to close on Sun-Thurs. It wasn't too busy at 6:30PM so we found a spot right away. We ordered a few drinks from the happy hour menu and also ordered the spinach and artichoke dip, the california club flatbread and the carnitas fries. The drinks were really good and for $4. The food was pretty good and cheap since it was happy hour. The service was good. Our waiter kept checking up on us to see if we needed anything. The atmosphere is nice there. They have a few TVs up on the walls usually showing sports games. This place is located in the North County Fair mall. It's separate from the mall on the outskirts of the parking lot. The happy hour is pretty good here and I'll definitely be coming back again soon."
Michelle R.,"Canoga Park, CA",43,8,2,1.0,4/29/2017,"This is possibly THE WORST BJs restaurant I have ever been to. They  charged me for a whole prime rib meal when I got just the meat without the 2 sides, salad, and pazooki it comes with. (The waiter had said that there was an al la carte option when I ordered) Then the manager argued with me and tried to say he would charge me for a rack of ribs instead, when I clearly did NOT order a rack of ribs. It wasn't until I asked for the phone number of the regional manager that the manager even offered to rectify the situation. On top of that, the chicken alfredo that my friend ordered was tasteless and the pazooki my other friend got was not cooked (it was mush with ice cream on top). The service was also so slow that it took 2 hours from ordering to paying our check."
Bobby R.,"San Diego, CA",3,16,1,1.0,10/28/2016,"Such a Disappointment. My wife and I have been going to BJ's since the early 80's in La Jolla. It use to be our favorite pizza We have tried the one in Escondido a few times. Tonight it was just Bad! First they said pick up in 20 minutes then when we arrived it took another 20. The Pepperoni sausage pizza had very little cheese, some pieces had NO cheese at all on them. The sausage was dry and looked more like sausage pellets. The BBQ chicken pizza was lacking cheese as well and I think we would have been much better off at Pizza Hut, Papa Johns, Pizza Bueno or Anywhere else. $53.00 for two Bad pizzas... all bad. Don't do it."
Melanie Z.,"Hampton, VA",2,245,,3.0,8/19/2016,"Service was good. Staff friendly. Food decent, nothing special. Very crowded and loud during dinner hours."
David D.,"San Marcos, CA",4,11,21,5.0,12/19/2015,"I've been coming to this location with my fiancé numerous times (at least 10 times) over the last two years. I don't get the low reviews as we've had nothing but stellar service and good food. We've tried a variety of seafood and chicken entrees, appetizers, and desserts and are always very satisfied. We're both very picky people and would definitely acknowledge any poor service or food but so far always have a great time and experience. We've actually disowned the nearby Cheesecake Factory due to poor service on multiple occasions so now this is our go-to spot!"
Stephanie F.,"Carlsbad, CA",2,32,2,4.0,11/8/2015,"In the flood of 1-, 2-, and 3-star reviews, I'm going to give the bar 4 stars. I'm only mildly ashamed to admit we are regulars, and that we have a favorite bartender or two. I won't name names, but in general, the bartenders here are pretty bad ass: efficient and appropriately attentive (while also trying to get work done). For a major restaurant chain and planted in the heart of craft beer country, their beers are actually pretty good. Nutty Brunette is my go to. BFF raves about the Tatonka Stout. I wish their draft list featured more local beers, particular of the north County breweries, but alas... The food is decent. I'm not expecting anything mind-blowing. Granted, when we find ourselves at BJ's bar, we usually ate elsewhere. When starving and timed right with Happy Hour, we get the Tavern-style pizza (better bang for your buck than the other pizzas).  In terms of ambiance, its dark, spacious, and not too loud. Again, we prefer the bar for lots of reasons: better use of space, more attentive staff, large TVs, quicker service."
Zachary W.,"Poway, CA",4,13,,4.0,8/22/2016,Great service sat outside. Food was good but dessert was the best red velvet pazookie ftw
Tessa M.,"Temecula, CA",61,8,,1.0,4/17/2017,"Visited bjs during happy hour on a Tuesday afternoon. I had a very big issue with the restraunt manager and other staff allowing a dirty NON SERVICE dog at the bar. Crawling under peoples chairs, trying to jump onto the bar stools and eating scraps off the floor. Allowing the owner to just walk away for long periods of time leaving her dog at the bar, the owner wouldn't move her dog so customers could sit down, it was so beyond rude and disgusting. Its one thing if it was a well behaved service dog, like mine. But to abuse the law and the rep of a service dog is just wrong. Very upsetting that that was allowed."
michelle w.,"Highland, CA",5,59,6,4.0,12/8/2015,"This BJ's was very accommodating to our 20+ person party full of hungry teenage hockey players and parents.  The food is always good at any BJ's, in my opinion.  Today I enjoyed the ahi poke very much. One of their new cocktails, the Watermelon Basil Margarita blew my freakin' mind!"
Aunt cathy a.,"Ramona, CA",101,4,45,2.0,4/14/2017,"Can you say hurry up and wait? It was Not that Busy on Monday however we waited forever for our food. Never got plates for our pizza, waited forever for refills on our drinks, and the food did not come out together.Some were done eatting while others were getting their food. First time coming here, was very sad. Sorry guys for a bad review, but, need to work on getting that food out and refillng those drinks. It's important to your clientele. Just saying. . Aunt Cathy..."
Hani A.,"San Diego, CA",115,1,,1.0,10/13/2016,"I have been going to various BJ's for years but the service at this location was less than okay. I went this Sunday and I was over charged; I don't know if it was the server over tipping himself or a punch error. I called and spoke to a manager on Tuesday that they charged me $59 instead of $29, and that I had left a $6 tip so my total should have been $35. The manager said she would ""look into it"" and call me back. It's now Thursday and I still haven't received a call back. I checked my account again and it looks like the adjusted the price but to $39, so I was still over charged. Not even going to bother calling again, just won't go to this location ever again. Save your receipts guys and double check your accounts!"
Edward B.,"Pasadena, CA",44,41,,4.0,8/8/2016,"Stopped here for a late night Sunday night snack on the way to Los Angeles. Love having a place that's actually open past 10.  Only 1 server this late but he was amazing, attentive and totally let us know that even though closing time was in 30 minutes, not to feel rushed at all.  We had deep dish pizza and drinks and were not disappointed. I'd come back here alone for the great atmosphere and friendly staff."
Andrea S.,"Murrieta, CA",0,3,,5.0,3/18/2017,I come pretty often to BJs and never write a review but today Erik J was our server. He's seriously awesome. Super polite and had great service.
Amanda M.,"Temecula, CA",199,142,378,2.0,10/1/2015,"After we had already sat down, I checked yelp to see what rating everyone gave this location. I was a little surprised by the low rating but quickly realized everyone was spot on with their assessment!  Our server was the only one in our section, and he was completely overwhelmed. When we sat down ever table was full, which was about 15 tables or so. After we waited about 10-15min just to order, and after he dropped off our waters we didn't see him again until our food was completely goner a we asked for the check. He refilled our water, but only after we were done eating and had to go the whole meal with NO DRINK?!! What!!! The table next to us waited 20 min for a box for their food and they asked for it as soon as they got their food too! He never asked us how our food was, if we needed anything or if we were having an enjoyable experience. Never have I been so disappointed in the serve at a BJs restaurant! He dropped our check off without clearing our plates which had been empty for about 15min. Overall just an overwhelmed server, who was most likely new and can't handle so many tables.  On the plus side our food was very good, I ordered the pepperoni flatbread, a little greasy but very good. My husband had the bison burger which was also very tasty. I would try this location again, but if the service is the same I wouldn't dine here again."
Nani G.,"Escondido, CA",16,21,7,2.0,2/24/2017,"I had the worse experience at this location. To start the host took our name down wrong and there was a 30min wait ,which we didn't mind, but when it came time to check in the new host at the front basically said we lied about it. When the host who originally took our name fixed it and we were being seated we got the dirtiest look from the host ,who called us liars. Now when our server LINDA came I have never had worse customer service. There where 3 sets of couples that came in and were able to finish they're meals pay and leave before we we're even checked on. Linda refused to check in at our table. Linda didn't bother to ask if we needed anything. Linda also refused to clear our tiny table or refill our drinks, as it was the only thing we had been served up to this point. When we where able to ask for refills she through them on the table causing them to splash or spill unapologetic Linda continued to disappear. Linda checked on us a total of 3 times after we flagged a separate server asking to cancel our order and give us the check. It took an extra hour for our food to come out, note they didn't complete our request to cancel the order instead Linda stayed away until our meal was ready. When our food finally arrived it was cold and tasteless. Linda didn't offer to reheat or remake Linda gave us our ticket and was speedy to collect the tab in hopes of a tip in all I was very dissatisfied I honestly believe she refused us the service we where do because we are an interracial couple. I hope Linda is reprimanded and something can be done about our terrible experiences."
Sierra H.,"Poway, CA",27,8,2,2.0,10/6/2016,"Food was good. Waitress was great!  however, I had shards of glass in my beer... When I told the waitress she quickly tried to find the manager on duty it took about 10 minutes and when the manager came to the table he smelt of cigarettes  he appolagized for the glass and took the beer and my pizza off the bill. But I had to ask for an incident form to fill out! He didn't even offer! I was really unhappy with the way the manager handled the situation."
