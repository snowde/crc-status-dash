Gabrielle C.,"San Diego, CA",0,16,,5.0,6/20/2016,Ryan is the best server! I will go back to see him. He makes conversation so much fun and he makes good suggestions. I had an issue with the food that I ordered but he took care of it for me and brought back a new one. I have been to bjs before and my servers were no better than average but Ryan is way over average! Thanks Ryan for making my experience the best.
Melani S.,"Rio Linda, CA",0,4,,5.0,3/27/2017,"I'm from the Sacramento area but we travel to So Cal often and whenever we do, we eat at BJ's whether it be sit down or take-out. I just recently signed up as a Loyalty member to write reviews but did not receive an email to do so. Therefore, I'm writing a review on Yelp in regards to our experience. My husband and I ordered take out on Saturday the 25th. He ordered a bison burger, fries and coleslaw. I ordered the Asian salad. BJ's has the best coleslaw. The food was perfect and our take-out cashier (Eddie) was so polite and friendly. We will definitely be back!!"
Ashley O.,"Hidden Hills, CA",156,66,31,1.0,9/8/2014,"BJs Happy Hour is UNHAPPY :( It's no deal at all, 1/2 the price for 1/2 the quantity. This is our tiny buffalo wings happy hour special $4."
Franco E.,"Los Angeles, CA",128,60,88,4.0,7/14/2016,"Ordered their great white chicken pesto pizza. It was shared between three people and did a good job of filling us up. Taste was good, and service was good as well. Precipitation from the a/c vent was dripping down and they offered to move those individuals to a new table but that would've destroyed the point of us dining together as a group. Overall it was a good experience."
F.C. C.,"San Diego, CA",0,57,,3.0,10/2/2016,"The food was very good, but our server Stephanie really did not do her job well. She dropped off our bill. I got out my wallet and put $30 in for a $20.87 bill in the bill holder, then walked over to the bar service area where she was standing and gave her the holder. I was a waiter for years in college. When someone hunts you down to give you the payment, you know he is in a hurry. We needed to get going to make sure we got to an event on time. Stephanie, however, kept doing other stuff, like taking orders, fetching drinks, talking to another waitress, etc. It was not because she was waiting to get the bill rung up, because finally, after 10 minutes, she brought me back nine $1 bills. I do not like the trend of not getting accurate change. But I really don't like a waitress who is either oblivious or trying to stall in hopes I just gave up and left her a 45% tip.  We were late to the event. We like this restaurant and will go back. But if Stephanie is our waitress, we are leaving. Really bad experience."
Ashlee S.,"Escondido, CA",104,4,1,4.0,9/5/2016,"Was expecting it to be busy, holiday weekend, they said 15-20min we waited probably 25mins, good table great service, food was slow (but they were busy,... it wasnt ridiculously long, but we were getting antsy and the kids menu games were done) and the kids pizza i ordered with our appetizer didnt come out until AFTER our entrées. Our server (no name! Sorry!) made up for it, he was really great the whole time!"
Scott W.,"San Diego, CA",320,19,1,1.0,7/8/2016,"This place is signed up under grubhub, but grubhub could not deliver our order after we paid for it and waited 45 mins.  Shame on BJ's for being apart of this.  DON'T USE GRUB HUB  Or eat at this BJ's.   Very bad business."
Al M.,"Vista, CA",0,19,,1.0,2/28/2017,"Myself and my family went and tried BJ's for lunch after spending the afternoon at the Safari Park and saying I was disappointed would be an understatement...the service was so-so, I've certainly had worse, the server's name might have been Christian that was on the receipt but he never introduced himself so not 100% sure of his name, but he was honest at least when after waiting for our food for 30 minutes that 'another server took my niece's plate of food', I appreciate his honesty, but try telling that to a 7 year old hungry child she didn't understand waiting almost an hour total waiting for a simple mini-burger, the food finally comes out, the burger was fine, but my mom's food comes out cold, UGH, so now we're waiting again!  By the time my mom's food comes out my niece is done with her food, I waited for my mom's food to eat, so my lunch is cold.  So we FINALLY now eat our lunch, more waiting to get our check and pay, it's like they're in slow motion there at BJ's not realizing that people have things to do after lunch I guess, so we're running late on meeting my sister to drop off my niece so I'm in a rush to leave and forget my sunglasses do to the rush I'm in now after this lunch mess, they're not expensive glasses by any means, but, ya you guessed it, they stole my sunglasses.  If you're in a rush and want want your food in a timely matter and hot and fresh...I would suggest another restaurant as there are a bunch in this area and mall."
Lauren P.,"Escondido, CA",72,95,37,2.0,5/27/2015,"I used to frequent this place a lot with my fiancé, but the past two times that we have eaten there (tonight included), I have had horrible abdomen pains accompanied with sitting on the toilet for an hour. I also have had different things both times, just to see if it was a fluke. When I'd go, I'd normally get the fresh tomato and mozzarella salad (snacks/small bites) and the stuffed mushrooms.   The last time, I had the salad and shared a pepperoni flatbread pizza. The grease was just way too heavy and it didn't agree with my stomach.  This time, I ordered their Tuscan Tomato Bisque, and they brought me Chicken Tortilla, but once they actually brought out the correct order, the top of the tomato bisque there was a ton of oil pooled at the top of the soup. I was hungry, so I attempted to strain as much of the oil off as I could, but it was a lost cause. I had to spend another hour in the bathroom :( This place used to be pretty consistently good, but now I'm afraid to eat here because I'm in immense amounts of pain I endure once I do eat there. I really feel bad, I used to love this place. But if they don't get some new cooks/chefs I won't be visiting this place again :("
Samahna S.,"San Marcos, CA",715,265,1884,4.0,10/15/2014,"Wow! The menu sure has changed! Several of our favorites are gone! There's still a nice selection on the menu though. I really enjoyed the new light beer they have. I had the chicken Greek pitas and they were light and delicious, my husband loved his thin crust pizza. Other than the temp of the restaurant (it's really cold in here!) we had a great lunch! :)"
Lori J.,"San Diego, CA",60,82,73,4.0,7/29/2014,"Been here quite a few times in the past on dates. I'm always satisfied with the service and food. Usually order a steak & they cook them to order. Love getting a green beans side instead of fries.  The staff is always pleasant & the environment is usually noisy, but it's a busy place in the evening with the huge bar. Will certainly return."
Rose D.,"San Marcos, CA",4,37,147,4.0,7/19/2015,"Visited BJ's for dinner on 7/19/15. As we waited to be seated (waited for about 10 mins, not bad in my opinion) I checked in to Yelp, read the reviews and started to get worried. However, our waiter Thomas was very friendly and attentive. We ordered a Bud Light, Pear Cider and Brussels sprouts small plate. Everything came out in a timely manner and was very tasty. We then ordered North Beach Shrimp and Mahi Mahi (from the light menu) and a Pepperoni extreme 9inch pizza. The food was flavorful and delicious. Thomas our waiter checked on us periodically but not too much. Overall, great experience and based on this visit, I would definitely recommend BJ's. I should also mention that this is my forth time dining at this BJ's location and each time I've had a pleasant experience."
Jean G.,"Del Mar, CA",1,5,1,2.0,7/21/2016,"I'm not sure what the problem was in the kitchen but we waited one hour for our food to come out and an additional 35 minutes after we placed our dessert order. No explanation, no warning, no apology.  We arrived at 7pm, the restaurant was not crowded and were seated right away. The first clue should have been the wait staff apologizing to a table near us about some issue. Our server was pleasant, our beverages came right away and we placed our dinner order for our table of four. And then we waited, and waited, and waited. No one to flag down to question, no one came by to tell us there would be delay.  Finally one dinner arrives and 10 minutes later the other three dinners come out.  And as if we hadn't learned our lesson...we made the mistake of ordering dessert and waited another 35 minutes.  The food wasn't bad but it was not worth the wait."
Alissa M.,"San Diego, CA",120,11,3,1.0,4/19/2015,"WARNING: VERY GRAPHIC. OKAY MAYBE NOT THAT GRAPHIC BUT YOU MAY NOT WANT TO READ BEFORE YOU EAT HERE AS YOU MAY LOSE YOUR APPETITE. YES IT'S A NOVEL. First off, I'd like to say our waitress was a very good one. She has great CS but she should look for another restaurant to work at as for what I'm about to express, is going to be real AF. A couple of my best friends and I came here to catch up with life and wanted to share conversation over (what we expected to be) great food. This was on Wednesday (04/15/2015.) We've all been to one of many BJ's restaurants but I myself have not been to this one in 3 years. I ordered the PM Porter to go with my Black and Bleu-House Burger and shoestring fried potatoes. One of my girlfriends ordered the same but wrapped in lettuce with a side of mozzarella and tomato salad. She also ordered a diet Pepsi. My other girlfriend ordered the BJ's Brew house Burger with Applewood Smoked Bacon and Swiss cheese. Instead of fries, she upgraded to their featured Watermelon and Feta salad (extra balsamic vinegar dressing... I forgot her drink tho.) Food was tasty. No issues. Went home. Please keep in mind, we haven't seen each other in almost 2 months and this was like a reunion.  The next day (Thursday 4/16/2015) I had no appetite and was wondering why I felt a little odd. I had coffee and a piece of bread the whole day. I wake up Friday (4/17/2015) go to work at 6am. 10am rolls around and I feel nauseous. Go to the bathroom having the worst pain in my belly and great! I have diarrhea.  Walk back to my desk, having a feeling that I am not done, so I go back to the commode. When I was done, I go back to my desk. Not even 2 minutes pass by and tell my coworker this is ridiculous and now I feel I need to vomit. Low and behold, I puke a chunky waterfall. I do this from 10am to 12pm. I finally tell my boss I gotta go home.  I get home and the pain gets worse and worse. This had gone on until midnight and I finally begged my family to take me to the ER. I was given an anti emetic and morphine (Yes, the pain was that bad and my threshold for pain is actually pretty high) for the excruciating cramps. Also, attached an IV bc of all the electrolytes I had lost while vomiting, from both ends, of my body. I didn't go home until 4:30am. I then learned, it wasn't just me that almost died from someone's poor food handling but also, my two best friends had been going through the same shit. Way too much of a coincidence if you ask me. BJ's, I'm not blaming you but I will blame the son of a bitch that almost killed me and 2 of my best friends because of their neglect in food handling service. Or maybe the quality check was overlooked when preparing the food. WASH YOUR FUCKING HANDS AFTER YOU USE THE BATHROOM AND USE GLOVES BEFORE YOU PREPARE ANYONES FOOD. EVEN MAKE SURE THE FOOD ISN'T SPOILED BEFORE PREPARING IT. THE FOOD WE ATE COULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO A CHILD... A CHILD WHOSE IMMUNE SYSTEM MAY NOT BE AS STRONG AS 3 GROWN WOMEN. YOU COULD HAVE KILLED SOMEONE! That is all. I will never come back here and I will tell 3 friends to tell their 3 friends and so on and so forth of the experience I have had."
Philip H.,"Poway, CA",0,4,,1.0,5/11/2015,"My mom wanted to go yesterday for mothers day. So we went and arrived around 5:45, had to wait for about 30mins to be seated, which is not too bad considering the amount of people waiting. Once we got seated it was all down hill from there, mainly due to the fact it took us over an hour to get our food. I had my child and my niece with me as well (who are both 4), so if you have kids you can imagine how impatient they can get sitting in a seat coloring for an hour.  Once we got our food, everybody said it was good, except for me who ordered the buffalo chicken pizza and received the BBQ chicken pizza, but of course I didn't want to reorder for fear having to wait another hour. Our waiter did admit that we waited a long time for our food and offered to give my mom a free salad, instead we asked for something a little more practical and asked for a free pizookie. The waiter said ok. When he came back around we actually asked for 2 pizookies, expecting 1 to be comped. When we finally got the bill, both pizookies were being charged. We asked the waiter about this, he advised his manager said they could get us a mini pizookies, but not a full size one. I find this very absurd, since  the price is not much of a difference and we were waiting for over an hour. I would advise staying away from this restaurant unless you enjoy seeing people being seated after you, getting their food and leaving before you."
Garrett F.,"Oceanside, CA",188,130,290,5.0,11/11/2015,"It was Veterans day and Bj's was offering $12 off every veterans meal. This is terrible to see everyone attack this place for doing an honest to goodness thing. That's why it was so busy. Because they have quality food, prices and service. Justin was friendly and honest. My husband says his service was ""Justin-time"" thank you guys for the awesome meal. We would highly recommend you check them out."
Ed G.,"San Diego, CA",1,74,,4.0,1/8/2017,"BJ's has some stiff competition. This location is next to a Red Robin and both businesses offer a similar menu, although BJ's is probably more libation-centric. I've only been to this location once and I was pleased with the cleanliness, menu and service. Prices are slightly high but it won't cost you your tax refund."
A R.,"Tempe, AZ",9,140,5,2.0,6/17/2015,"Maybe it was the weekend hustle, maybe it was the holiday weekend hustle.  Whatever it was, it wasn't great.   The place was super packed, we had called in about 30 mins prior to arriving to reserve a table but when we showed up the girl had not written down our reservation, so we had to wait another 40 minutes or so.  We were starving at that point, tired and grumpy otherwise we would've walked out to a fast food place.  Our server was really nice, but she started with her name and then said she was really busy, almost implying whatever service issues happened was not her fault.   We were a group of 7 and 5 of us got our drinks quickly.  The housemade root beer is always good but this time I got it in a warm cup instead of their signature frozen cup.  The extra two waters took a while to get placed in our table too and I never got a refill on my root beer throughout the night.  When we finally got our food, my mother in law had blue cheese on her wedge salad which she had asked to opt out of. Then the replacement salad came with brown lettuce so that was taken back.  The final New salad came at the end of the meal which we had to take in a container since we were all done eating by then. My chicken lettuce wraps came with brown lettuce as well, and to curve my appetite everyone gave me a little bit of their meals.  My new order with green lettuce came very very later, when everyone else was done eating (we had not received the 3rd salad yet at this point).  The waitress apologized again stating they were very busy.   My opinion is either get more servers or don't seat so many people at your restaurant if you're not prepared for the masses. We ordered a gluten free pizzookie which was good, but unfortunately when that arrived I was still halfway through my lettuce wraps dinner so I didn't get to partake.   I would've expected to at least receive a discount or a free dessert on our ticket for the delay in our dinner and the multiple issues, but we didn't. This location is near the mall, so maybe that was a bad choice for us, especially on a holiday weekend.  Everyone else stated their food was good, but service was not."
Brittany M.,"Portland, OR",96,104,34,1.0,6/12/2014,"Update:  If I had a chance to give this negative stars, I would. I decided to give this place another shot since it's not Christmas shopping season and it was a Sunday early evening.  Our buzzer went off when it was time for us to sit, we were waiting for a friend who was parking. We asked the hostess or seater, whatever you call her, if we could wait a second for our friends to walk up, no one was waiting behind us. She said sure, and then said ""right this way"", so she didn't even listen to us. Our friends found us in the back corner, all is well.  We start ordering food, we got some appetizers and some salads. One of my friend's salads had a very long hair in it. Thankfully the server saw it after he had dropped it off so he took it back and got a new one. Then our appetizers came out right when our food comes out. So I guess if you want to make sure you get a break in between apps and food, only order one at a time.  The waitress never came back to give me a refill on my tea, I went my entire dinner without a drink, and no one to even flag down for help.  Will never go back, horrible experience and I felt embarrassed for my friends for going there."
Diana S.,"San Diego, CA",651,542,1818,1.0,4/27/2015,"Terrible terrible terrible service! I understand its raining and a lot of teenagers are there for their prom but don't promise everyone body that it'll be a 30 minute wait when it ends up being an hour almost an hour an a half! We even heard the person tell a part of 5 that it would be 20 mins!? Nicely, my husband told someone in that party that we were told 30 mins and just finally getting seated. There were enough grumbles and complaints from other parties too.  After being sat at our table, our waiter didn't come to us until 10 mins later. he was very unpleasant, unwelcoming and looked like he was ready to get out of there. We asked for our drinks: ice green tea, two coffees and waters. Guess which one came out first...a cup of coffee. No, not both, just one and my ice green tea. The other cup of coffee came out 10 mins later and the water...well that came AFTER our potato skins came out. -_-  What made his service much more worse was that we kindly asked for some sweetener. Well he just did a run by drop off...not a ""oh here is your sweetener"" and leave. its was a *go by your table and drop if off like a piece of mail and run off to the next thing.* Uh...thanks dude.  On top of that, the waiter was going to get us some plates for the skins...well that never happened. My brother had to literally get out of his chair, go towards the kitchen area and grab plates for us. By the time we were already eating on the plates, the waiter came back and said ""oh, I'm sorry! I forgot about your plates.""  I guess by that point he knew his game was off and that the service was less then par. It took three other staff to take care of us while this guy was no where to be seen, heard or caring.  yea, the food was good but with the lack of customer service, the under promise of the wait time psh, we were don't and didn't care about the quality of the food anymore. We already started out with a bad taste in our mouths that couldn't be fixed even with a yummy poozkie which our waiter didn't even offer! WTF MAN!"
