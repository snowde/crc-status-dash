Brandie F.,"Oceanside, CA",14,8,22,1.0,12/20/2015,If I could give no stars for this review I would. Here's why. Tonight was the first time my husband and I and a friend went who is a regular to Bjs at the North County Mall shopping center in Escondido. Our waitress Aaliyah was AMAZING serving us even with the situation I encountered with our food. We started with some appetizers the Siracha queso chili verde dip and potato skins. When we got our food the dip was cold so they had to remake fortunately the potato skins were good. Second time receiving our dip everything seemed great until I started noticing I had been chewing something hard so I decided to pull it out and to my surprise took out a huge chunk of melted plastic. When we notified our waitress she notified the manager on duty Shawn who was unsympathetic towards my situation when we told her that this was the second time making the dip and now there's melted plastic which is toxic. She kept saying it was the plastic wrap from the cheese that wasn't fully unwrapped when we tried telling her that's not the big issue you don't let the wrapper melt with your dip and tell a customer it's just the wrapper from the cheese when that's a health issue. The manager didn't seem to sympathetic about what I had almost eaten and was rude about it. She did take the dip off our bill but I felt more should of been done especially for a first time customer. After that I lost my appetite and didn't want to eat my broccoli cheddar soup anymore and my friends club sandwich had soggy bread. I can definitely say this will be my first and last time going to a BJs and anyone that has had a good experience at another location beware of this one!!!!
Lynn B.,"Escondido, CA",0,2,,2.0,11/12/2016,"It started well, food was good and hot. Then it was like we didn't matter once the food was served. No drink refills, waited 30 minutes for desert, still no refills. Had to corner someone for water, was never offered refills for fountain or well drinks. Another 15 minutes to get the bill. PAID with their new app. Then got chased out the door for not paying. Explained that we PAID with their app...oh, okay. 2 hours for dinner."
MissElle B.,"San Diego, CA",3,71,,4.0,7/30/2015,"Price $$ Quality: 4 stars Service: 4 stars Value: 4 stars Portions: average Fun, fun place to eat with your posse, however not quite the place for an intimate dinner.  Fun drinks, even their soda pop is the real deal.  The dishes we've tried so far were packed with  flavor.  The pizza is pretty good, but doesn't match up to my other favorite pizza places.  They have a good sized dining area, which can feel a bit sardined if you sit at the tables vs. the booths.  They have huge TV screens throughout the establishment for the sports fans. Service can be a bit scarce, but you have to consider the number tables there are to serve vs.  the number of staff they actually have on the floor. The wait to be seated is generally 40-70 minutes during peak hours on Fri/Sat.   A go-to place if you want a fun place to drink and eat."
Meridian R.,"Valley Center, CA",0,6,,5.0,4/14/2016,Service was beyond great. They went above and beyond to make sure we were well taken care of the entire night. Even though we came in late night they still treated us awesome.  Thanks so much for that. Pizza supreme amazing btw.
Raymond L.,"San Diego, CA",345,23,13,4.0,5/8/2015,"I recently came here to eat with a large group for a birthday. When we first got seated, we realized we needed one more chair. Got the chair but we had no elbow room... so we asked for another table and we got one! Yay more elbow room!  My girlfriend and I ordered a deep dish pizza, half great white and half five meat, and we also ordered the Alfredo pasta with the chicken and broccoli. The pasta was bomb! Pasta was al dente, the chicken was moist, and the broccoli was cooked the way I like with a little crunch to it. The pizza was pretty good as well, but nothing extraordinary. For dessert, our group all split a few of the pizookie trios so everyone was able to get their own mini pizookie. I'm a big fan of chocolate chip and my girlfriend got the Oreo cookie one! Mine was delicious! And my girlfriend's was good too I guess... I mean it was so good she didn't even save me a bite!  Food was good, pasta was bomb, and the pizookies were dank! Service was pretty good, a lot better than I expected which helped the overall experience, especially seeing the 2.5 stars. It was also very dark in the place though, and I'm not too sure why? Some spots at the table were more lit compared to others. Sooo, if you're going on a blind date and you're a little insecure this is a perfect place to go because it's dimly lit!"
Sean M.,"Escondido, CA",77,6,,1.0,12/12/2014,"I have been to BJs 5 times and every time I leave I tell myself, ""Self, I am never going back.""  The reason I will never go back is the service is the worst service I have ever had in California. THE WORST! The waiter/waitress always neglects my table. They come once in between the time we order and the time we get our food. This last time I looked to see if our waitress was busy at other tables and she was no where to be seen. In fact, I didn't see any waiters or waitresses. To top it all off, when we finally got our food (40 minutes after ordering) it was cold. This tells me our food was ready well before we received it. Our waitress was occupied with something else, like chatting in the corner with the other workers.  The food is OKAY and certainly not worth dealing with the HORRIBLE service and the amount of time it takes to receive it.  I WILL NEVER GO BACK!"
Esme G.,"Escondido, CA",2,10,15,4.0,9/19/2016,"good food, Good environment most of the staff is friendly and will be glad to help you but some few seem to not want to have to deal with you and just want to leave overall I like this place and their foods though"
Sam P.,"Bellevue, WA",0,2,,1.0,7/21/2016,"It was my farewell, It was my friends birthday, I had guest visiting from out of states. We decided to go to this and we were happy to try new things. We reached there around 7.15 PM and we did not any server until 7.40PM finally we got server and we order apetizer and main course and then juat wait..wait ..wait.nothing until 8.30.Not even apetizer.we saw two tables besides us who came before us still waiting for foood.One of the old man scream loud on manager and cancelled his order. We decided to be patience and stay. We called our server and ask for food she replied its not my fault.Then we called manager and asked what is going on. It was 9.30 still no food. After screaming on manager she got 1 item which was pizza and guess what it was colder. We finally decided to just walked away. No food No service No rEgret.please dont go hear.Only go here if you have useless time and nothing to do."
Andrew C.,"Escondido, CA",130,18,3,1.0,1/1/2015,"My family and I visited the Escondido bjs recently. I was hesitant to go here due to the negative reviews, but I chose to go here based on the good reviews as well.  Well...... I just ate my Caesar salad with my bare hands. I was served the salad and had no utelsils whatsoever with which to eat it. The rumors are true, I am afraid. The simple act of keeping this establishment staffed seems to be a complete failure of the management. The eyes of the waitresses and waiters are filled with despair and stress. It is a very simple matter of under staffing.  I understand that bjs is a business which must remain profitable, but when both the employees and clients have a poor time due to what I can only deem to be management failures, then everybody loses.  As usual, the food remains fine and tasty. Also, the choice of television program is amiable, as it is holiday bowl time.  Overall experience: one half point out of five. Taste and presentation of food, four points out of five.  Overall, 1.5 points out of five. Sorry, but you need to fix a lot of issues from the management. It is unfortunate that the displeased patrons will likely take their frustrations out on overworked and poorly scheduled hard working wait-staff via poor tips for poor service due to poor staffing and overall poor management."
David S.,"San Marcos, CA",44,132,47,3.0,4/11/2015,"Good service, kids' food is overpriced.  Had to share a pizzookie for dessert of course.  Make sure you ask for a kid's juice or they will charge $4 for a small glass of juice."
Peggy O.,"San Diego, CA",0,8,,4.0,10/4/2016,Had an excellent dinner tonight.  Thomas was our server and he was fantastic.  The restaurant was very busy but he checked in with us often and took great care of us. We will definitely be back.
Joel C.,"Carlsbad, CA",11,90,16,3.0,4/19/2015,"Overall a good restaurant if you go early and get good waiters, etc. and one of the best BJs locations I've been to. There are some inconsistencies though: the waiters don't seat you well (next to loud people when the restaurant is empty otherwise), they play the most boring and bad pop music that doesn't fit the otherwise good atmosphere of the restaurant, the food portions very kind of significantly on each visit, the service is so-so, I've been ignored before on things like refilling water, getting me the check, etc. This time I waited over 10 mins for the check. They don't list their cocktail drink prices on the menu so you have to individually ask for pricing on a drink (they are also over priced). I would recommend going here before it gets too crowded and the lunch deals fade away (before 4 PM). It doesn't get nearly as crowded as the BJs in Carlsbad though. I would also recommend not getting pizza here, mainly because of the price, it costs like $1.50 for each additional topping, I got a deep dish pizza by mistake with several toppings and it was practically bite size for $14. Ouch. The bartenders shake drinks vigorously which dilutes the flavor, but they do it to put on a show of course as if that matters more. The beer here is pretty good, but not as good as Stone, Pizza Port, etc. obviously. I think the TVs kind of bring the place down, do people really go to a non-sports bar to watch TV? Or even leave the house to watch TV? I understand having a TV by the bar but not really beyond that.  I would recommend getting a sandwich/salad combo or a pizza salad combo for lunch, it is the best deal and makes me come back here. You can get one of those combos for under $10. P. S.  The rewards program is BS. I've used my rewards card on several visits and have spent about $60 with the rewards card getting me points. I only have 9 points, this means that at this rate you have to spend $500 in order to get to the 75 points that earns you a mere $5 off. Finally, the waiter took 80 cents as a tip when he was barely there. I don't know why waiters think they can just not give you change back."
Mikey D.,"Escondido, CA",154,5,,3.0,7/9/2016,"Okay so let me get it straight, BJs has the WORST service usually, more often than not to be honest. BUT, food is delicious, especially the Cajun chicken pasta, which is the reason I keep coming back, literally. Only once out of like the hundred times, I've gotten my order CORRECT! The service is always so slow. But The servers named Jade and I think her name starts with a D who wears a headband and glasses. THEYRE THE BEST! They da best Fosho"
Jay J.,"Escondido, CA",1,4,1,5.0,4/19/2016,I had amazing salmon from here the other night.  I'll be going back.  I was there early so I'm not sure how the crowd gets late.  I just moved close to the area so I look forward to watching the games here.
Lindsay R.,"Escondido, San Diego, CA",2,2,,1.0,9/21/2015,"I've been here a lot and had a really good experience. But yesterday was the complete opposite. My partner and I decided we were gonna get some pizookis to-go because we both had pretty bad headaches and just wanted something sweet. I ordered it on the BJ's app, and paid for it (tip included) with a pick-up time of thirty minutes from the time I placed the order.       So we get to BJ's and no one is in the to-go booth are at the hostess area, so we stand there for about 10 minutes by the time a guest tells us we should ask the bartender. So we ask the bartender and he says he didn't receive an online order. I show him the confirmation and he says to us, ""Oh, sorry, I'm retarded and must not have seen it."" At this point I'm frustrated, my partner is upset and his head was throbbing. But they said it wouldn't take long, so we waited. We sit here for about 30 minutes and no one says a word to ask, so I finally ask about our food and they say, ""Oh, sorry..its wrapped up in the back."" ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I'm sitting around waiting with a huge headache and you didn't even come to tell me my food is finished so I can leave.  Then he gives me my food and hassles me about paying online because he couldn't find that I did on the computer. Even though I showed him the online payment confirmation.       Completely ridiculous if you ask me, it took almost an hour to get three mini pizookis. Wish I hadn't paid ahead because then I would definitely not have given the generous tip that I did, actually wouldn't have given any tip. In my opinion I shouldn't have even had to pay for the food because it was cold, the service was awful, and it took almost an hour.       Very frustrated, possibly not going back."
Jess R.,"Escondido, CA",0,9,,1.0,9/15/2016,dont go for thursday night football.....they have sports on for all the TVs and when i asked for the volume to be put on instead of the lame pop music in the background they said they only turn on the volume for Sunday and Monday games....guess im going to steak house in same parking lot where i know they have volume for all the games....and no i dont work there...just like watching the games at a bar for the vibe
Ron C.,"Pleasanton, CA",151,632,102,3.0,12/2/2013,"What does one say about BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse?  I've eaten at several of these chains and while I'm not thrilled over the top, I find that they are consistent.  There's much to be said just for that. I know that I can get a decent brew, a tasty appetizer, and a fair shake on price.  Considering the vagary of eating establishments, I could do much worse!"
Ron P.,"San Diego, CA",175,56,6,3.0,2/3/2015,"This place used to be one of my favorites to grab a slice and a pint. Not so much these days, but it beats similar places due to location and convenience. Nitty Gritty: Ambiance: Always lively and fairly easy to have conversation over a meal. The booth seating is prime for more intimate parties. Pretty typical sports bar-esque vibes. Service: It's usually hit or miss here. Sometimes we get someone super nice and attentive, while other times we get stuck without refills and the wrong order. Fairly slow overall, so bringing good company helps alleviate the building hunger. Food/Drinks: My favorite dish to get here are their deep dish pizzas. I've gone and ventured off into other realms of the menu, but have often times come up disappointed with something that's just not as satisfying or too greasy for my liking. The scampi isn't too bad though. The beers are pretty good here, so they have that going for them! I love the nutty brewnette, jeremiah red, and their hefeweizen is tasty as well. This place still has the potential to grow in a better direction, so I hope they continue improving on their service and menu options for the future!"
Lanya G.,"San Diego, CA",121,129,1414,3.0,1/20/2014,"Average american cuisine. Nothing special here. I don't even really like their pizza, which is suppose to be their specialty. I've eaten here a few times and never go here by choice. And if I come back it won't be by choice. Last time I ate there I ordered the ahi tuna salad and the leaves were old. Also we ordered the spicy sausage pizza which was suppose to come with spicy tomato sauce but instead tasted like sweet bbq sauce, yuck!  I just don't like this place, nothing special about it."
Adam P.,"Vista, CA",0,12,,5.0,9/29/2016,"Went here back at the end of august for my fathers birthday. I wish i had remembered our servers name. (was a younger guy with blond hair). Anyway food took a little bit to come out and there was a problem with my food, so i had to send it back and watch and wait for my food while my dad and sister ate theirs. The server apologized. No problem, mistakes happen. Our server and the staff were very helpful and made it a great experience. Food was great ( even though I had to get it to go, since it took so long for mine to come out of the kitchen). But again our server still made up for it and made it a great experience. Was happy with the service we received and I would go here again."
