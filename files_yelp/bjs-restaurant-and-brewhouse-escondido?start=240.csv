Chris D.,"San Diego, CA",23,43,1,1.0,8/18/2014,What a disaster.  I went here with 3 other friends and on a Friday night.  The server was probably the worst I have ever had.  He took our order pretty fast but after that we rarely saw him.  Our apetizers came out and we had already finished our sodas and ice teas.  I flagged him down and asked if I could get another diet coke.  I guess I should have asked for the other 3 drinks as well as he grabbed my glass and didnt look at the other empty glasses.  He came back about 8 minutes later and then asked him for the other drinks to be refilled.   I ordered the fish and chips and the fish arrived completely overcooked.  I would have sent it back however I could not find our server anywhere.  I decided just to eat them as I was already kinda full from the appetizers.   Our never asked how our food was and after we were done eating he said that he was leaving for the night and that another server was going to be taking over.  He never introduced her and she never showed up for another 10 minutes.  When she finally showed we asked her if we could see a manager.  The manager arrived promptly and listen to our concerns.  He appologized and said he would find out what happened.  He never did return.  The second waitress said my manager took off the apps for the inconvenience.   Listen up manager.  BJs should not be a 2 and a half star restaurant.  If you want to improve your image it needs to start with you.  Start caring for the people that give you honest feedback and pretend that you give a damn.  Personnaly go back and hand the check to your customers.  This only takes a minute and goes along way.
Maddie C.,"San Diego, CA",0,5,,1.0,2/25/2017,"My husband and I recently had a terrible experience at this location. When we initially got to the restaurant we were given an estimated wait time of 30 minutes. We were pretty hungry but decided to stay anyways. 45 minutes pass and we still not been seated. I asked the host how much longer it would be and she apologized but said the wait would be another 10-15 minutes. Although we were hungry, thirsty, and now a little frustrated we gave them the benefit of the doubt and decided to wait. We ended up waiting 20 more minutes bringing our total wait time to over an HOUR before we were finally given a table even though we were initially quoted 30 minutes. We were willing to look past this and finally get some drinks and food and wouldn't you believe it but we ended up sitting at the table another 10 minutes and still hadn't seen our waiter. We started grabbing our things to leave when finally our waiter swoops in to greet us. Since we had so much time to look at the menu we again gave the staff another chance and stayed. We ordered our drinks, appetizers, and entrees all at once making us what I think a pretty easy table to handle. We get our drinks and appetizer in a timely manner but guess what, we WAITED again, about 25 minutes after our appetizer for our entree. No staff had come to talk to us, we're just sitting, waiting, having no idea where our entrees or waiter were. Our food was finally delivered and at the delivery our waiter said our food was given to another table and they had started eating it so the kitchen had to remake our food. No apology was given, but our waiter informed us he had talked to the manager and had comped the up-charge on the asparagus my husband ordered. Thanks dude. All our waiting saved us $2 off our entire bill. It really felt like a slap in the face. I used to work at a restaurant and when mistakes like this were made the managers made it a point to speak to the table AND offer to take care of the appetizer with possibly a gift card to return again at a later date. It's very disappointing to see how some customers are willing to give a restaurant multiple chances only to be let down time and time again. We will not be returning to BJ's and will leave our waiting for another restaurant."
Jen U.,"Escondido, CA",11,185,31,2.0,12/2/2014,"Such a rip off for a mini pizza. It was so small which is totally fine but not for $10 and the way it tasted. You are better off going to Little Ceasars! They have so much on there menu but lack vegetarian items although I am sure they could make whatever for you, it just is a bummer they don't have options listed for you.  The pizza barely had any sauce and just didn't taste that great. Also it was extremely dark in here, you may have trouble seeing in here. The only reason I would come back here is to try the fancy drinks."
Sandra A.,"Allen, TX",20,17,6,1.0,7/7/2016,"I placed an order for dine in using the BJs app. When my daughter and I was ready to pay for I noticed that we were charged twice as much for our meal. Once the waitress came back to the table she stated that it was in error and that the bill was being fixed. Over 30 min went by and the manager tells me that the bill has been corrected. I proceed to log into my BJs app to pay the bill and it still showed someone else's order. So she hands me a bill and says I closed out the check and it will clear from your account later tonight. Then she Says can I pay the bill using another method other then the app. I paid the bill but in the mean time my BJs account is still showing that I have an outstanding bill because the manger didn't correct my order.  She recreated the order and didn't delete the other one from my account. The lack of customer service and a ""manger"" that didn't want to do her job is the reason why I will not be eating here anymore. My daughter and I usually stop here a couple times a week for dinner but this will be the last."
Morgan A.,"Escondido, CA",26,4,,5.0,9/20/2015,"I had a going away lunch today with my family (11 other people) and our server was Raul C. He was an amazing server and didn't once mess up the order which seems to happen quite often with other people I know. He was friendly and attentive! On top of that, I forgot to grab my pizza when I left and went back and asked if they had thrown it away. They did, but the manager had a whole new pizza made for me. It was a small thing she did for me but I greatly appreciated it and visits like this make me want to go back there more often. That is how restaurants and management should be...friendly and helpful!!"
Chris N.,"Tulare, CA",0,3,,5.0,4/21/2016,"We recently hosted our son's wedding rehearsal dinner for 40 at BJ's Escondido.  From our first contact with the manager the process was handled very professionally. The accommodations were great, the food delicious, and we couldn't beat the value.  I highly recommend BJ's for a large group!"
Speedy J H.,"San Diego, CA",41,9,23,1.0,8/4/2015,Once we got sorted not a single server came and greeted us. No drink order or even acknowledge that we were sitting there. Everyone else was being helped. Very disappointed in the service today! Not sure about returning because they showed no interest even when we walked in waiting to be seated. I know they were not busy due to the lack of patrons inside.
Brenda E.,"Fallbrook, CA",42,23,2,1.0,1/18/2016,I would give it a 0 if I could. We waited to see the hostess and it took a good 5 minutes. They said they could seat us right away in a busy restaurant. We sat down and waited. We continued to wait. Several waiters walked past us multiple times. We didn't even receive a drink or a simple oh I'll get to to you a second.  No one talked to us at all. As we were waiting a couple next to us received their appetizer and they told the server they were leaving because the wait was ridiculous. We waited 15 minutes and not once were talked to. We got up and left. We love the food here but after today's experience we will not be returning to this location.
Stella A.,"San Francisco, CA",474,118,58,3.0,12/1/2014,"Got the California flatbread and the spinach stuffed mushrooms. Thought they were both okay, maybe a little too much un-cheesy and un-sauced crust on the flatbread, which led me to ask for a side of the garlic aioli.  Service is usually pretty slow here. This place is huge so the waiters are probably walking for dayz. However, there are big TVs and an impressive bar, plus it's the perfect emergency food after a long day of shopping at the Westfield North County mall."
Shanel S.,"Sterling Heights, MI",704,827,917,1.0,6/18/2014,"Good thing this is all the way in Escondido. Now I don't have to worry about frequenting it. After a semi-long drive from Palm Springs, we decided this would be our late night dinner stop. We were hungry after an early grad party and after doing some damage at the outlet. Since it was my birthday I was able to choose between here and Cheesecake Factory. I stupidly chose BJ's since I was comparing it to my favorite Hazard Center location.  So like I said, it was my birthday. I walked in with a McFlurry since I wanted dessert before dinner and because when it's your birthday, you can do whatever you please! Duh! I basically greeted the hostess myself since I was immediately judged. I apologized for having it, but she pretended to understand after rolling her eyes at me. She then proceeded to walk us to a dirty ass booth. I wiped the booth down as she watched. When I finished wiping the other side, she grabbed a WET towel and wiped the side I was going to sit at and didn't tell me. I was in shorts so it surprised me and she laughed. It was not funny and I made sure she knew that. A few minutes later our waitress came. No smile, no welcome to BJ's, no anything. I can't even tell you her name since she didn't introduce herself. We ordered our food. I got a mini BJ's favorite, my friend got the California Burger, someone else got chicken wings, and I think my other friend got some kind of breaded chicken dinner. We also all got salads. The salads came out quickly and then it took over 25 minutes to get our COLD food. I mean COLD! My pizza was even a little doughy. I asked for no sausage on my pizza and still got it on there. Our waitress was never to be found for refills or to ask how we were doing. We ate our food since we were practically starving. Then the lady came out of no where and these were her words ""I'm sorry I'm not feeling well. I have a bad migraine. Seth will be closing you out"". Um what? Who the eff and Seth and who the hell are you?!?! Seth did come eventually and to only close us out. We ordered a birthday pizookie with the manager and didn't get it until we finished paying our bill. I mean seriously, the worst service and some of the worst food I have tasted. Dear Managers, get your shit together, and train your team or just hire new staff (especially cooks). You guys suck!"
Kirsten D.,"Tucson, AZ",188,368,846,3.0,2/14/2013,"Let me start by saying that the food rating should be 2 star, but the service boosted the overall a bit.   Our waitress was extremely helpful, efficient, and friendly.  She was by far one of the better waitresses I've had at any restaurant in a while.  I just wish the food lived up to her service.   Started with the avocado rolls.  They looked fantastic when they arrived.  But really they were just an egg roll paper stuffed full of avocado and void of any flavor other than grease.   I ordered the maui pork chop.  Again, it looked really great when it came out, but it was so tough that I had trouble cutting through it with the steak knife.  It came with roasted red potato's and steamed green beans.  The green beans were the best part.  My friend ordered the jambalaya and the waitress told him it was spicy.  He asked for it extra spicy.  It came with very little spice.  I tasted it and it was just totally underwhelming.  Not bad, but nothing to write home about.   I really wouldn't bother coming back here.  There are many choices out there, and this just isn't worth wasting your hard earned cash."
Malcolm S.,"Escondido, San Diego, CA",23,122,35,5.0,10/15/2015,This place has an extensive menu and all of the dishes are good quality. The decor is lavish and it's a very nice place.
michelle l.,"Kernersville, NC",11,41,8,2.0,8/2/2014,"This place used to be good....food and service.  The last few times it has been horrible.  The hot food comes out cold and the cold food comes a bit warm.  Funny???? I ordered the chicken tortilla soup.  Yes folks, came out cold.  Mini pepperoni pizza came out cold and a wee bit doughy in the middle.  Hello cooks...  If there is enough time for it to get cold before you have it served, you have enough time to cook it properly. I'm old school BJ's (UCSD location in the late 80's-early 90's)  I so wish they would go back to being a small restaurant.  The corporate crap is awful.  Your becoming just like a Denny's or a Coco's"
Liz A.,"San Marcos, CA",0,14,5,5.0,12/19/2015,"I love BJS California Chicken club with fries is a must  also the tomato basil pizza, and their beignet for dessert.   I always have good service here when I'm dining in, and you can order for takeout too which is great since I work in the mall. I have to come here at least once a month"
Stacy P.,"Indianapolis, IN",107,717,369,2.0,3/26/2013,"I wasn't overly impressed.  Service: It was slow. It took over 25 minutes to deliverer our chicken wontons, and two minutes later, our entrees arrived. Menu:  There were plenty of options, but the calorie content was off putting. You could easily eat your entire days worth of calories in one sitting. Food: The shrimp pasta had a kick, but wasn't enough to save the dish. The shrimp was bland. Atmosphere: Large dinning area, but extremely loud."
Kenneth H.,"Escondido, CA",12,20,9,5.0,12/21/2015,"Having a beer. Waiting for my wife, who works at the Mall. Paid.    But left my wallet. Realized about 1 hour later. Called them. They had my wallet. Picked it up. Everything was there, including the $11. No it wasn't much but they were very professional about it and saved me a lot of grief due to my own neglegence. Thanks"
Pamela S.,"Escondido, CA",16,6,1,3.0,8/23/2016,"So we have been to BJs for breakfast and lunch and really enjoyed it, however tonight our dinner experience was disappointing. We like sports tv and general atmosphere. There were 4 of us, the food was very slow to arrive and passable at best. To their credit, the waiter was good - he brought a fresh(er) sandwich when the first one was cold. I'll give 3 stars since they didn't charge us for the cold meal. I might try breakfast again but will not return for dinner."
Deidrell Noraine S.,"San Diego, CA",329,51,16,3.0,11/23/2014,"The wait sucks. You have to wait to put your name in. You have to wait to be seated. You have to wait a heck of a long time to receive your food. It's irks me. However, their food is pretty good. Their pizookies can never go wrong!!! I'll probably only come here again for their pizookies...."
K D.,"Los Angeles, CA",202,36,4,2.0,8/19/2015,I like BJ's every now and then. Well this was one of those now times. Food was not good. The wait staff was bad and some even had attitudes. This is a BJ's that I will defintely stay away from.
Abby W.,"San Diego, CA",1489,972,759,3.0,11/12/2010,"I visited BJ's on Veteran's Day with my boyfriend because they were offering a free lunch to current or past military and he's in the National Guard.  It was a packed house!  We had to wait about a half hour for a table but I'm guessing that's not the norm for the lunch crowd.  Our waitress seemed a little frazzled so I'm guessing it had been busy for awhile.  I can't really fault her for forgetting the silverware on a day like that!   I decided to go with the half sandwich with salad, which was very reasonably priced at $6.95.  There's a list of about six sandwiches to choose from with the combo and I had the grilled chicken club without the avocado or bacon.  The chicken was nicely cooked and very tender.  I always forget that grilled sandwiches have a tendency to tear up the roof of my mouth but that's more my fault than the restaurants.  All in all, the sandwich was pretty good.  It came with jojos, which were great too!  The salad, while definitely not the worst that I've had, also wasn't the best.  Instead of serving the dressing on the side, they drizzled it over the lettuce so by the time I was finishing the salad, some of the lettuce had gotten soggy.  My boyfriend had the salmon teriyaki and the bite that I had was quite delicious! The part that I did like about BJ's is that it felt like one of the restaurant/breweries that I frequently visited when I lived in Seattle (The Ram). I feel like 3 stars is a little low but 4 stars would be too high.  Overall, I'll balance it out and go with 3.5 stars."
