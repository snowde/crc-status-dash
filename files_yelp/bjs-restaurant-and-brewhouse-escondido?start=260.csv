Julie V.,"San Diego, CA",4,10,,3.0,6/5/2014,"It is still one of my favorite to go places. I thought of writing a review as it had been continuously from last 3 visits, quality is degrading. I don't know if I was late or something is wrong in the kitchen with chefs. Food was bland and not properly heated on first occasion. second time in a row, I went in earlier with family and same thing again. I don't want to stop coming here but need some time to get back now. Hopefully it will be better in future."
Phoebe C.,"Buena Park, CA",98,1144,1864,3.0,7/19/2014,"Yay for BJ's in North County SD! For appetizers, we ordered the calamari, the spinach artichoke dip, and the fried avocado rolls. Between the three, I far preferred the avocado rolls - so warm and avocadoy! For entrees, we ordered the Great White, the Mediterranean, the BBQ Chicken...and another deep dish that obviously wasn't memorable. My (unexpected) fave was the Mediterranean so I'm glad I ordered it- loved the huge chunks of feta embedded in peperoncinis and olives.  Despite the long-awaited, gustatory satisfaction of BJ's deep dish pizzas, I bumped my rating to 3 stars because our initial order of the party platter pazookie came out raw! We talked to the waiter, who disagreed with us, but his manager immediately acknowledged the cookie dough was raw, apologized, and ordered another pazookie. The second order was better than the first, but some parts were still on the moist side. Still good though, but I would advise ordering individual pazookies rather than the party platter."
Heather L.,"Beckenham, London, United Kingdom",211,1018,262,3.0,9/16/2012,"A couple nights before my mom and I had lunch here, my aunt had suggested this place because we were planning on going to the mall and we all started giggling.  [insert pervy joke] here.  Fast forward to my mom picking me up after my shift at the mall and she asked if I wanted to go here for lunch.  We had never been, so I said sure. The inside is really nice and it is quite loud, so for those of you guys taking girls out on dates where you would like to get to know them and actually talk to them, I don't think this is the place... then again if it is already an awkward night out, then by all means, go here then you can both avoid talking to each other and watch t.v. as they have them all over the place.  Anyway we had to wait for a table, which I thought was a bit strange given it was almost 2 p.m. on a weekday...  and there were about 3-4 parties waiting. The hostess was friendly in seating us.  It took quite awhile for a waitress to come over and take our drink order... in fact it took so long we had already decided on our starter and our mains.  Our stuffed mushrooms came out and so did some plates, but like some other reviewers, we did not have utensils, so the waitress, upon request, went over to another table and stole the utensils off of the table.  There was no refill offered for my empty glass... actually our waitress wasn't around very often.  I thought it had to do with the large group next to us... including the store manager and district manager for the store I work for... but she wasn't serving them, so I can't figure out why she was never around. The stuffed mushrooms may have been the best part of the meal... should've ordered more of those.  Both my mom and I ordered the Mahi Mahi tacos... she got both grilled and I got one grilled, one fried.  A different waiter brought out our food, still no refill on the drink.  The tacos certainly looked lovely!  They serve them with nice warm tortilla chips... mine were really good, but my mom's chips were stale!  They serve them with square containers of avocado cream and salsa... wasn't a fan of the salsa, but the avocado cream was nice. The tacos... my mom said hers tasted a bit funny, and my fried one tasted a bit funny... not sure how to describe the taste, but my grilled taco was actually ok... just not much fish at all.  And I do love cabbage/slaw on my fish tacos, but I got all of the thick, hard, bitter parts of the cabbage.  I think by the time I pulled all of those pieces out, there wasn't much garnish left on the taco :/ (maybe this speaks to the fact about how often my mind is in the gutter... but [insert pervy joke here]).  To be honest, I think I'd be willing to give the food another go, but with the service, I'm not sure that I would go out of my way or suggest it when someone asks, ""Where should we go for dinner?""  The lunch prices... well there are some items under $10, but I would say most items on the menu are over $10."
Jackson L.,"Ramona, CA",1,35,8,4.0,6/27/2016,"I was there last night, basically the only decent place that were open late on a Sunday night.  Chicken wings, calamari, and beer on tap.  Doesn't really get much better than that.  Nice ambiance, not too noisy, liked the interior design, staff was friendly, food was good, and plenty of parking."
Ricardo S.,"San Diego, CA",17,81,47,4.0,7/11/2015,"Came here for the first time this past week and I really enjoyed it!  The flatbread pizza was awesome, its a good size pizza enough to split.  The ambiance was nice and service was good.  I liked the fact that our server didn't care that my date and I sat and talked for two hours after we had finished eating.  I am looking forward to coming back and trying one of their entrees."
Sharon L.,"San Diego, CA",265,25,24,1.0,7/16/2015,"I came here for my birthday dinner with my family. We ordered a lot of dishes. We got two burgers, a medium pizza, and the shrimp scampi. My mom ordered the shrimp scampi, but we had to send it back to the kitchen twice because there was literally no flavor. They offered us to choose a different item from the menu, so we got the chicken alfredo. Chicken alfredo was alright. The pizza was very doughy and didn't seem cooked. The cheese wasn't even melted all the way. So, we basically saved the whole pan and brought it home. It was good as leftovers because we used the microwave to heat it up properly. Burgers were okay but nothing great. They were both a little too dry. We got the Buffalo Brisket Burger and the Crispy Jalapeno Burger. The only thing good was the pizookie they gave us since it was my birthday. Service was also good, since they changed our order for us, but employees all seemed a bit nervous and anxious to help us. They were all relatively young, the hostess and our waiter. I really liked BJ's, but this time around, I wasn't too pleased."
Nancy H.,"Escondido, CA",29,65,11,5.0,7/12/2015,"We go here occasionally. They have nice small plates for happy hour and a great beer selection. The check tends to be higher here than other places we frequent for happy hour probably because the food is elevated but it's a nice treat. The atmosphere is great and the service is usually good although it can be hit and miss. Ladies, bring a jacket because it's freezing in there."
Chris Q.,"San Diego, CA",0,1,,5.0,11/21/2015,This place is great. The atmosphere is modern and very relaxing. The food is great and our waitress Dwan gave us the best service we've had in a while. Two thumbs up to this place and kudos to Dwan. Thank you guys
Mike D.,"San Marcos, CA",0,4,,1.0,7/26/2016,I just ordered a roasted turkey cob sand-which to go. As I arrived home there is no bacon or avocado on this sandwich as advertised. How hard is it people? Get your shit together! Will no longer be eating here. Adios bjs
Adam S.,"Escondido, CA",86,200,135,1.0,7/15/2015,"Hey if warm beer and watered down drinks served by drones is your thing, then go for it!  Once should have been enough but fearing an off day we tried it again.  No thanks."
Michael R.,"Rancho Mirage, CA",53,85,35,4.0,8/28/2015,"Very nice, we stopped here our last night in Escondido, large menu and large beer selection, we sat at the bar, the servers are very friendly and the server was great. We will come again."
Honey H.,"Lemon Grove, CA",30,44,17,4.0,9/9/2015,"Great food! Took my son, my cousin and her son. Kids had pizzokies or however you spell it. Good atmosphere. Joining the rewards club is worth it"
Julie B.,"Rancho Santa Fe, CA",0,2,1,1.0,6/27/2016,Horrible service. Waited 30 minutes for a hamburger and 2 kids meals. I talked to the manager and she said thank you for letting her know. Then 20 minutes for a kids desert. We went at 430 in the afternoon. The food was nothing special. Won't be back again!!
Liangcheng R.,"San Diego, CA",5,40,42,4.0,9/6/2014,Had the soup and salad combo: Broccoli and cheese for the soup and the tomato and mozzarella for the salad! They were both great :) I know a friend asked for a rare steak and got medium rare though :(  Peach cobbler wasn't too bad but more lemon than peach tasting than I was expecting. Pizookie was pretty good too but really sweet :)
Kimberly T.,"San Diego, CA",96,121,242,4.0,3/8/2013,"I really like bjs People over hype the pizookie though. It is good but not to the extent it is talked about. It is literally a cookie in a pan. Tastes like any other cookie that is just baked and still warm with a ic cream scoop on top.  The food however is good! The balsalmic chicken is my favorite. I is 2 breasts grilled with sweet balsalmic sauce drizzled over it. Sitting on leafy greens, cartelized onions, topped with fried onion strings and all with 2 scoops of mashed potatoes that are amazing.  The blue burger is good too if you like blue cheese. It's not amazing but worth the money. And the shoe string fried are different. If you get a choice try them out.  But a Must is the small dish of mozzarella and cheese with balsamic  sauce, it's a small snack ( not appetizer) but its so good. And cheep to."
Manuel M.,"Carlsbad, San Diego, CA",49,2,3,1.0,7/18/2015,I guess they had to kill the cow at old tolonies  urs cause been over an hour and I just ordered steak and a hamburger!
Lindsay V.,"Mission Valley, San Diego, CA",10,19,16,1.0,7/9/2015,"Horrible service! With 2.5 stars why wouldn't the manager try to fix that!? Tonight we had Garrett and he was not helpful at all and then in the middle of our evening brought us our check. Yes, we did ask for a box but that doesn't mean we didn't want dessert?? Now he doesn't want to come back and pick up our cards to pay....Weird...."
David L.,"New York, NY",371,117,91,2.0,8/15/2015,"This place has been in decline over the past couple of years. This place is known for their pazooki.. Not their pizza.. That's a problem for a pizza joint. Their pizza ALWAYS comes out lukewarm when everyone loves a hot pizza. I really mean it, I have come here a handful of times and I have never come here and enjoyed a hot pizza! Plus it is cooked slightly on the less side and the inside can be a bit doughy, and the bottom is never crispy. Sadness.."
Erin B.,"Carlsbad, CA",4,69,18,3.0,8/27/2015,"BJ's has good food, good drinks and happy hour prices. I usually get pizza, but this last time I ordered the Mediterranean chicken tacos. They were delicious! I went on a Tuesday which means that wine is half-off. I ordered from the happy hour menu and my server told me it was cheaper to go with the half off, which i appreciated. She was very nice and patient with me while I waited 30 minutes for my guest to arrive. She was friendly and attentive. I can't remember her name but she had curly blonde hair."
Joe L.,"Escondido, San Diego, CA",4,35,7,1.0,9/26/2015,"Don't waste your time or money. Food was pathetic and what should have been hot was warm and what should have been cold was warm. The server, Justin, was great and was bringing out refills before we even had a chance to ask. We won't be back but want to be clear it wasn't our server's fault."
