Miranda C.,"San Diego, CA",43,123,89,3.0,9/6/2015,I like the bar here. A great place to grab a drink with friends. The food is decent. I like their hard ciders they have. And the avocado rolls are good too.
Dayna M.,"Carlsbad, CA",141,10,3,1.0,6/12/2015,My fiancée and I went here for our Friday night date night and I ordered the buffalo chicken pizza with a side salad and my fiancée ordered a chicken club with a side salad as well. Food tasted fine and service was okay. Later that night at 3am we were both up puking our guts out and having the absolute worst diarrhea we have ever experienced. Yep we got severe food poisoning!! For two days straight we felt absolutely horrible and we unable to do anything because we were either puking or having explosive diarrhea every 5-10 minutes. We lost so much fluid that we literally could not even walk to the bathroom anymore because we were so weak. I will never eat here again and I suggest you take caution when eating at this location. This food poising was one of the worst experiences of my life.
Tyson M.,"Surprise, AZ",89,2,,1.0,1/9/2016,"terrible service, need to learn how to sit people and get people in & out quicker. Just bad. don't know if i will be coming back her"
Amy S.,"Blacksburg, VA",138,223,114,2.0,8/2/2014,"I've been here twice. Both times? Not that impressed with this location. I have been to the location in Carlsbad and think that it is loads better.  I usually get their Seared Ahi Tuna Salad. Great flavors. Generous portions. All around great salad to help you stay on track. But, at this location- I'll pass. It was so heavily covered in their vinaigrette dressing it'll make your tongue raw. Tons of wonton strips and only 4 slices of the Ahi Tuna. It wasn't a lunch portion, it should have had way more than that.  Bust! My husband got their deep dish pizza, lunch portion. It was ok and it definitely didn't have any sauce on it, at all. Not sure if that's the way it's supposed to come.. but it was just a deep dish cheese bread. Nothing spectacular.  I'd skip this location and go to the one in Carlsbad. All around better."
Jamie S.,"Poway, CA",302,62,1,1.0,4/9/2015,Horrible service!!! And burnt my pizza so I had to wait until everyone else was finished to way my dinner!!!!!! Wasn't even busy
Sherri U.,"Ramona, CA",0,1,,1.0,4/12/2015,If you like bad service and cold food then eat here. If could give less than 1 star i would.
Adelle K.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",9,43,,5.0,7/26/2015,"Came here on our way home from San Diego and were so glad we did, our server was awesome (Giuseppe?) and the food was amazing! We had the avocado egg rolls, BJs favorite, and a pizza and flatbread pizza. Everything was so good! I don't understand how this place only has 2 1/2 stars, were glad that didn't detour us from going."
John L.,"Escondido, CA",154,89,26,4.0,8/5/2015,"Pretty good lunch menu, a little pricey for certain items but it's a nice place to take a break from shopping at the mall that is walking distance."
Annie T.,"San Diego, CA",827,129,151,3.0,1/31/2014,"Oh BJ's, how I like thee.. the restaurant, not the other thing kind of course! I used to go to BJ's a lot when I lived in NorCal, but haven't since moving back home. My friend I came here after work because we wanted something to eat, along with a nice cold beer. We came on a Thursday, which just happened to be 3.50 beer night (for their brew). How lucky! We ordered (lunch menu): -Angel Hair Toscana: I thought it tasted bland, but my friend enjoyed it. I liked the pine nuts in it, but other than that I felt like it was under seasoned sauce. -1/2 cobb sandwich with fries and salad: I liked the cobb sandwich a lot, although it was greasier than expected when holding the sandwich. I do recommend trying it though! It's a great deal with fries and a side salad! -BJ's Hefeweizen: I'm not a light beer fan really, but my friend said she liked it a lot. -BJ's double IPA: it was part of the 3.50 which was nice.. but I only got 12 ounces for that price instead of the regular size. In general, it was good, but nothing spectacular. I asked to sample the double ipa and either the stout or porter (I love both and I can't remember which) to decide between the two. I was a little annoyed by what the server brought.. both samples were in hot glasses so I basically tasted lukewarm beer and had to decide from that which I liked more. Definitely a decent a spot for some beers and catch up time, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here."
Courtney J.,"Escondido, CA",118,16,3,2.0,5/24/2015,"Eh. There are just so many better places to go in Esco. Hell, even in that shopping center. Haven't been happy the past few times. Why remove the pot roast? Boooo."
Celia S.,"Mira Mesa, San Diego, CA",257,31,10,5.0,4/16/2014,"Grilled chicken Caesar salad, mozzarella sticks & grilled chicken fettuccine are the best! Definitely coming back for more! My new favorite restaurant, will defiantly recommend to others! Thanks to my neighbor for the recommendation"
Diana H.,"Upland, CA",0,6,,5.0,12/19/2015,"My family and I love BJ's pizza so coming back from San Diego this weekend we stopped at this location for lunch. Let me tell you, we had the best service ever! We were seated quickly and ordered our drinks and pizza right away. We ordered a half cheese/half pepperoni medium with no tomato. After waiting a bit, our lovely server Jenavie, regrettably informed us that the chefs had made a mistake and made a whole pepperoni with tomato! She brought it out to us anyway so we would have something to eat in the meantime. She then offered my sister and I complimentary house salads, which were delicious by the way, and told us our originally ordered pizza would be out shortly. Needless to say we were shocked at such hospitality and amazing customer service! We had so much leftover pizza and left so full and happy that the two hour drive back to San Bernardino County was smooth sailing. Thank you so much BJ's and Jenavie! -The Higgins Family"
T. Y.,"Escondido, CA",3,46,1,5.0,8/25/2014,I always get great service at the bar.  This place is very consistant.  They never deviate from their posted closing hours like On The Border does.   I usually come in for late night happy hour which is a great deal!  All of the bartenders have been very nice and attentive.
Chris A.,"Nashville, TN",631,230,267,3.0,3/25/2014,"I often wonder why BJ's is so constantly packed when I struggle to find anything inherently awesome about this place. Maybe it's another one of those criminal anomalies like Guy Fieri's popularity. Better question: Why do I keep coming back? BJ's is a 'brewhouse', but zero beer is actually 'brewed' at each BJs. You'd have to be a 'brewery' to do that.  The beer is actually decent, but, like the food, doesn't really take any chances. With the dizzying array of menu options, one has to wonder about freezer drawers in the kitchen. But you accepted all that before you came thru the door. Decor is incredible. 'East- Coast-High-End-Hotel Lobby-meets Waldorf Astoria vibe. The urinals are actually pretty cool too. Kind of a waterfall-to-the-floor type engineering to reduce spatter. So there's always that. Service is hit and miss. I think of BJ's as TGIFriday's older wiser brother...without the ""Happy Joy Joy"" chants and the circus flare. About the same level of service and food quality. If you like dessert, checkout the baked beignet, tossed in cinnamon and sugar and then topped with vanilla bean ice cream, fresh strawberries, a drizzle of strawberry puree and fresh whipped cream. Redeeming. Gluten free menu options as well. Although this is the last place you'd think to go to for that..."
Gus L.,"Escondido, CA",247,888,771,4.0,5/17/2010,"What a difference some good service makes! My family and I ventured back here on Saturday and I must say were impressed. I would say the dining room was about as busy as the first time I went...We even sat in the same section...However our waitress, Mandy, was very attentive. We were greeted and received our drinks in short order. Our appetizers and entree's came out great (I had the Roast Beef Dip thing that was great!-The addition of grilled onions, provolone and horseradish dipping sauce made a great change from the standard french dip)...We even stayed this time for more drinks and dessert! I did take a moment to observe the other staff and managers and I will say it appears there is an active effort to improve the service here. Still some confusion, but marked improvements have been made."
Kimberly H.,"Escondido, CA",41,146,255,3.0,4/4/2014,Food is good but service is RARELY GOOD! It seems like their staff are overworked and spread too thin to be attentive enough. They are all nice but you can tell they are trying to figure out how to juggle all of their tables.
Sequoia F.,"Escondido, CA",0,48,21,1.0,8/11/2015,"Came here on a Monday night went to sit in bar area got seated.  Was never given any menus, Sat for 10 minutes while waiters walked back and forth past us and never once if we needed anything or if we had been helped. Finally when i saw them take an order from a older couple that came after we had arrived and get there drinks and still nothing from any waiter. I decided I would leave and no waste my money on a restaurant that does not even acknowledge that you are even there. We left and went to a nearby restaurant spent more money than we would have at BJs but got great service. Not sure If i will ever come back this is not the first time, I have been treated horribly by this location"
Briana F.,"Seal Beach, CA",17,19,3,5.0,8/31/2014,"I was expecting BJs to an ""ok"" place, but I was totally wrong. My boyfriend and I order the calamari appetizer. It was amazing. I have had it at other places but this was the best by far. It was crispy and soft. Love it and would order it again. For my main course I ordered the California chicken club. Again I was very impressed. It was very very good. My boyfriend ordered their brew house hamburger. I tried it and it was juicy and flavorful. Everything we had was wonderful. Even our server was awesome!!  Defiantly coming again!"
Jaime H.,"San Diego, CA",972,129,11,2.0,7/31/2015,"The team at our office chose BJs for lunch so we called in the order and went to pick it up.  The experience overall was average at best.  Food delivery was late from the requested time,  items were then missing from the order,  and although the food overall tasted OK,  the individual orders were incorrect.  This all after leaving 21 minutes after the scheduled pick up time. I like the food,  but not sure I would recommend the service."
Ron K.,"Poway, CA",104,23,,2.0,8/27/2015,"Went there last night with a party of 7, food was pretty good but the service was mediocre. That weren't too busy so we couldn't understand why they were so slow. Kept having to ask for a refill on an ice tea which makes no sense. We heard other people also complaining about the slow service. Also had to ask numerous times for silverware to eat our food with. Probably will return but not because of the service. Management needs to look at this and fix the problem !"
