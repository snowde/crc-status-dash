Phi D.,"San Diego, CA",536,405,1437,4.0,1/18/2015,"I was a little nervous to come here because of the rating, but i must say it was a pleasant experience. it wasn't too busy and there were plenty of tables, so we were seated right away. I enjoyed everything we ordered. i was a little skeptical with the fritos nachos, but i was hooked and couldnt stop munching. make sure to scoop up the beans on the bottom, we didn't notice it til we almost finished it. one thing i did notice was the pizookie options. i could have sworn they had red velvet but i didn't find it."
V C.,"Escondido, CA",7,73,268,3.0,6/11/2015,This place has greatly improved since they first opened. Their food is still great and beer selection is diverse. They have good deals for happy hour but make sure you are sitting on the bar level or else you don't get happy hour prices (something my server did not tell me). That is why they only get 3 stars. Everything else was great.
Amalia K.,"Escondido, CA",3,26,20,2.0,8/21/2015,"Been there more than 10 times and the last 5-6 times really sucked. I always go with my hubby and two girls. Once we get sat, they don't know we're there.. 15 min later.... Oh so sorry! Let us find someone to serve you!  Let me say that EVERY TIME WE GO THERE, WE GET OUR FOOD BUT THERE ARE NO UTENSILS!!! How are we going to eat this salad and poke? With our hands? Ok...?   Our very last visit... We weren't expecting much anymore. I do have to say most of the food is great, I love their salads. Although, on July 2, I went there to celebrate, sat outside with my husband. Ordered a salad and after a few bites, I found a very dark hair. That's just where I stop. Maybe some people can continue eating but not me. Lost it then and there. It was mentioned to the management but nothing more happened.  Let's just say, the Escondido location, you never know what you're going to get. Lol Wake up BJs! You're slipping...!"
Summer A.,"Las Vegas, NV",260,231,178,4.0,5/23/2014,"After a fun lunch yesterday, I thought my boyfriend would like this place (as we love craft beer) as well.  I previously went to the La Jolla location and had great service.  Pleasantly surprised being 2/2 on service at a chainish restaurant! We had a great server, Matt, whom wasn't overbearing, but also checked in frequently. We had the deep dish pepperoni extreme pizza. We were expecting something more Chicago style, however, it was still excellent and the dough was amazing.  If you enjoy craft beer, they have a great selection. Not that it's a bad thing, but I notices their beer was on the sweet side... Very refreshing and great for a warm day.  The only reason this is not a five star review is due to the slow bar times. Beer seemed to take awhile to show up at the table.  And there you have it!"

Stephen K.,"San Marcos, CA",0,2,,1.0,11/8/2015,"Went to brunch, very poor service.  Waited for an hour for food to come out.  Was very displeased with managers excuse.  Got up and left without eating. NEVER WILL RETURN!!"
Cj L.,"San Ramon, CA",0,4,,4.0,9/20/2015,This is an awesome place to be specially if you have a family who is a picky eater. They have a variety of food genre that practically anyone's taste buds will be satisfied. Reasonable price. The only reason it's not a 5 star because 3x now- when they get busy the waiters forget to bring you your drinks for awhile. Other than that you should try it.
Brian M.,"Poway, San Diego, CA",11,36,3,2.0,6/5/2015,The food is always great . Usually sit at the bar. First time at a table with a party of 4. Like I said the food was great the service was awful never saw the waitress again after she dropped the pizza on the table. Had to get up and search out someone to refill our drinks
Robert D.,"San Diego, CA",2,9,,2.0,2/8/2015,"Went to dinner at 7:30 on a Friday, So, as expected, it was crazy busy. Our waiter was the ""ironic"" type. You know the guy that smiles and say's ""of Course, I will get you another drink"". I do not know his name, he has a ""starter"" pony tail and worked the section next to the bar. I ordered the Chicken Cesar and my wife ordered the Salmon. My salad was soggy and obviously been sitting around awhile. My wife's Salmon was over cooked twice! We finally got the manager involved and he took care of the situation. Nevertheless, the kitchen needs improvement and over-site. We will not be going there during peak times anymore."
Larry S.,"Poway, CA",18,19,2,5.0,7/24/2015,"Huge menu with lots of good choices. If you like Fish and Chips like me you will love it here! On a scale of 1 to 10, I give their beer battered Cod a 9! The seasond fries were also very good. Couple that with an extensive beer tap menu and you are golden!"
Eric M.,"Cardiff, CA",0,4,,1.0,5/4/2016,Lunch was ok but we ordered 2 Long Island's thinking we would at least get a descently strong drink for the 10 bucks a piece we would spend. They tasted like lemonade. We asked the waitress if we could have another round but politely asked if we could get a drink that had some alcohol in it. She gladly brought us a couple drinks that this time tasted pretty good. We were happy until we got the bill. $105 for two 1/2 sandwiches and a few drinks! Wowzers! Left there feeling like we got robbed. They said nothing of the price and gladly charged us $14.75 per drink after the $10.50 Long Island iced tea's that tasted like lemonade. Will not return. Way too much for some weak sauce drinks. Holy smokes
Ben S.,"Escondido, CA",2,64,28,4.0,5/31/2015,"Great place for groups, plenty of seating.   They have about 30 beers on tap about half of them are their own private label.  Be prepared to wait they get real busy.  We normally go a lil later to avoid the crowds, they are open till 1am"
Arianna E.,"San Marcos, CA",0,13,,1.0,8/19/2015,"Unbelievably unimpressive. Their food is horrible and service is very slow. Steak tastes more bland than Denny's. Chicken is tough and tasteless. The manager admitted they do pizza and beer well, not steaks. High priced and terrible."
Glenn C.,"El Cajon, CA",25,100,38,2.0,7/7/2012,"Went today for a co-workers going away dinner. We only had 9 people to be served. We waited 30 minutes before we were asked for our beverage orders....the server then just walked away. Approximately 20 minutes later he arrives with the cokes & iced tea. We ask for him to take our orders and he said that he'd be right back. 15 minutes later another waiter stops by and tells us he'll be covering for the first waiter who has gone on break. He refills two ice teas and that's the last we ever saw of him. Approximately 90 minutes after first getting there our orders were taken. Approximately 35 minutes after that our food arrives. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger. It was extremely dry and well done...not the medium as advertised. The Jambalaya had whole tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce usually associated with this type meal. The rest of the meals were less than spectacular to midiocre at best. The highlight was the conversation and seeing old faces....but this could have been done at the local park. This was my first time at BJ's and I doubt I'll make a return trip or give them a second chance. In an economy where things are tough, treating customers like this won't bring the repeat business needed to survive."
Leamary H.,"Escondido, CA",0,1,,5.0,10/3/2015,First ever yelp review Eric J ! Best server I have ever come across !!! The main squeeze and I came to eat to make a long story short our appetizer came out before our main dish and without a single complaint from us he talked to his manager to take it off our bill plus our pizookie! Awesome Awesome Awesome  and greatly appreciated !  (It wasn't actually that long of a story when I think about it) anyways 10 stars !!!
GN R.,"Escondido, CA",0,38,8,5.0,8/14/2015,"Always a good atmosphere, servers and dishes. We've gone a few times this year and can't complain. Check out their brunch it's pretty good too!"
HelloKittyGrl S.,"San Diego, CA",0,8,,1.0,3/26/2014,"Question: If you have 4 diners at the table, how many place settings will you need? Easy, right? Apparently, the hostesses and waiters at BJ's can't seem to figure it out.  The last time we went to BJ's with a party of 4, there were only 2 sets of silverware at the table.  No one bothered to give us more silverware until 10 minutes after the food came.   The food is decent so we went there again last night.  The same thing happened again!  How hard is it to seat your guests and bring them some utensils? It's so awkward to have to hunt your waiter down while the food is getting cold on the table."
Ian C.,"San Diego, CA",10,4,,2.0,5/19/2016,"When you want bland food from servers who can't be bothered this is the place for you. Or if you want to read a 90 page menu where 85 of them are beers on tap this is the go to place. But hey, it's a chain so what can you can expect. You can spell mediocre without a B and J."
Al A.,"San Diego, CA",1032,765,1723,4.0,9/28/2011,"Man, I must be getting old. I've been living in this town for so long I can remember how most of these chains got their start.  We'll, I used to frequent the location near La Jolla Village Square back in the late 80s-early 90s when BJ's strictly made Chicago style deep dish pies. Then I stopped and moved on to UNOs because I felt their pies were a little more authentic. Today, I see the BJs chain at every major mall and I thought I'd go back.  Sheesh, this chain has grown in a big way. They just don't do deep dish pies, they do...EVERYTHING. Think ""Cheesecake Factory""-ish kind of everything. Instead of white, the waiters wear black and they're just as helpful.  The one knock on this place would be the speed of food delivery. It's as slow as grandma in the fwy with her turning blinker on.  But the presentation, taste and satisfaction you get from eating their offerings, you tend to forget you blew 80% of your lunch break before you took your first bite. I mean, the food is top notch and macho. Tasty burgers, pastas, appetizers and desserts to compliment their famous pizza pies.  Parking is ample, try to get a table before the lunch/dinner rush because this place fills up with hungry diners and their families fast. Don't trust me? Just drive by the entrance and look at all the people waiting on the front steps.  Oh yes, it's worth the wait."
Nicole L.,"Del Mar, CA",43,14,,3.0,8/3/2015,"I normally like BJ's but was disappointed with our order this time.  We called in ahead and picked up the order to go.  I ordered the Santa Fe Salad with no chicken.  Since I don't eat meat, I normally add avocado when I take off the chicken at restaurants but this salad said it already came with avocado.  I was super bummed when I got my salad and they forgot to put the avocado on it.  Since I got it to go, I couldn't just go back and ask for more.  The salad really wasn't that great with no chicken or avocado and I feel like I was ripped off."
