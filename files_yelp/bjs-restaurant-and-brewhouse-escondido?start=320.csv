L S.,"Escondido, CA",0,12,,5.0,5/14/2016,"We had a special event buffet for 30 people last month.  Our servers, Chris and Anna, did a great job.  Brian was the manager on-duty and made sure everything went smoothly, including thoughtfully calling me with weather updates before the event.  Thank you to Angelica who helped me on the phone, and mostly to manager, Fernando, who PATIENTLY handled several pre-event phone calls as I worried over every detail. Fernando, you are awesome!  The food was delicious, very reasonably priced, and as promised, abundant. Thank you to all the BJ's staff who made our special night even more special.  You are all much appreciated!"
Janet J.,"San Diego, CA",0,9,,2.0,7/29/2015,"NEVER AGAIN! Gave this lame restaurant another try with our out of town guests.  Worst salmon I have ever had, Petrified potatoe skin appetizers, tasteless rice pilaf as a side, Eaten here on any occasions, it just keeps getting worse. Embarrassingly bad for our guests!!!"
Peter M.,"San Diego, CA",19,17,8,5.0,7/21/2013,Must try Chicken Wontons Thai Style !!  Chicken tortilla and flat breads are the bomb !!!
Kathleen B.,"San Diego, CA",366,15,9,2.0,11/3/2013,"BJ's has really gone downhill these past few years. I used to be a regular, but it's just been bad news bears for too long.  I usually shy away from places that provide such large menus. I feel like there's no specialty item. The menu goes from Asian chicken wontons to bison burgers to pastas to pizzas (flatbread and deep dish) to Moroccan spiced salmon to fish and chips to giant baked potatoes and the list goes on and on....for about 20 pages. It's kind of overwhelming. My biggest complaint is that the water tastes like it came straight out of the sewage. On multiple occasions, I've had to order a flavored beverage to avoid the water. The ""gourmet mac and cheese"" used to be really good. It actually tasted gourmet, with thick stretchy cheese and a delightful sprinkling of bread crumbs. Tonight, it looked like soup at the bottom. It was supposed to have bacon crumbs on top, and what we got looked like one strip of bacon ripped into 5 pieces.  Also, when did Goldfish (the fish-shaped cheesy snacks) belong in mac and cheese? The last few times I've ordered the pasta, my boyfriend and I asked if we could split it. Twice, they've said yes; and twice they've said no. Consistency is key!!!! Sometimes the pasta is cooked al dente, other times it isn't. Sometimes they give two pieces of bread, sometimes it's one. Though minor offenses, I can only wonder what other things they're inconsistent with. They sure are consistent with water quality being poor!! The pizookies are always great, though. I'll give them that.  Also, the beer selection is great (as I hope it would be for calling itself a ""Brewhouse""). I don't think I'd come here again unless it's to get a good buzz from their beer sampler."
Micah P.,"Midland, TX",140,223,58,4.0,11/16/2013,"I came to BJ's on Veteran's Day to enjoy the complimentary meal to the military (I'm in the National Guard) and discovered that many other veterans had the same idea. This place was packed! Luckily, my cool girlfriend had the wonderful idea of calling ahead to get our names on the list. Our hour and a half wait turned into a half hour wait.  Since BJ's shares the parking lot with the North County mall, there's plenty of parking spots. We walked in and were amazed by how big the restaurant is inside. It's a nice restaurant combined with a sports bar.  Although we spent our wait in the mall, once we were seated we noticed that the wait staff was offering slices of pizza to the people waiting for a table. That was nice touch!  Our waiter wasn't too impressive but the majority of the staff seemed friendly.  I was amazed at the selection of beer on tap and decided to order their amber red beer. It was pretty good and went well with my pizza. I chose the BJ's Specialty Deep Dish Pizza. The pizza arrived hot and delicious with lots of toppings. I would definitely order it again! All in all, I enjoyed my time at BJ's and would consider coming back for any sports events or a night of drinking beer with the guys."
Clint V.,"San Diego, CA",1,6,2,5.0,8/30/2014,"Bjs is such an easy choice. It's always clean.  The staff is really knowledgeable about the menu.  The menu has something for whatever I'm feeling... fried,  fresh,  light,  greens,  beef,  chicken,  fish,  pork,  and their signature pizza and desserts.  Technology is second to none.  Order from home,  head of the line seating and pay right at the table.  No more waiting for them to bring the check.  A restaurant with its own app.  They also have the best reward program ever.  Points that mean something.  Alicia and John at the bar are hard workers and fun to talk to."
Elisse T.,"San Diego, CA",0,13,,2.0,8/29/2015,"My husband and I usually LOVE this chain.  But this location is pretty bad.  They get more than one star just because the staff is friendly and polite.  We got our food to go and it was not as good as the other locations we have been to.  Normally we really look forward to the avocado egg rolls.  Theirs looked like some sweaty dude sat on them, and tasted like it too.  They didn't bother cutting my husband's pizza into slices.  Obviously, we aren't incapacitated princess', but it would have been polite.  The mashed potatoes tasted like instant potatoes.  I would expect better if I am paying $50 for a dinner.  Not to mention having a cheat day ruined."
Stephanie N.,"San Diego, CA",1,29,10,1.0,7/9/2013,"Let me start off by saying that I've always liked BJ's Restaurant, their pizza and especially their pizookie. Today, I must say, the BJ's in Escondido highly disappointed me. My friend and I were meeting up for a nice dinner and we got a waiter in the outside dining area who greeted us at our seat and proceeded to ask us if we wanted anything to drink (we ordered water) then continued by asking us if he could bring us out some eggrolls. He wasn't offering us the specials nor was he listing some appetizer favorites. He specifically mentioned eggrolls and only eggrolls out of their gigantic list of appetizers...was this because we were Asian Americans?? strike 1 We then ordered our pizza and when another lady comes out with our pizza, she puts it down then goes to get us some plates after. Is there a reason why you wanted to give us a plate with an enormous tomato sauce stain in the middle of it? Did this come from your fingers touch our food...or was it your mere lack of attention to detail, not even detail...that stain was huge. strike 2 Lastly, my friend's water cup was sitting on her table empty throughout our whole dinner with no mention from our waiter to come and fill it up for her. After we paid our bill, which I so awkwardly had to sign as he stood hovering over like he was in such a hurry even though there were tons of other empty tables, we sat for another 30 minutes talking and we finally had the waiter stop by asking if he could get us any drinks to go...to go?? Because you can't fill it up while we're sitting there...we need it to go? strike 3"
Tim K.,"Escondido, CA",0,23,,1.0,12/2/2015,"Have not been to BJs in a while, wife and i decided to go for a late dinner 8:30 on a tuesday night no wait, Food was ok but our waiter turned into a jerk. My wife had ordered some kind of salad, at some point she mentioned to our waiter Justin that the menu stated that there were baby field greens in the salad but she found none only romaine, and the field greens are why she had chosen it. He looks at the salad and says there are field greens in it and she says no its all romaine. So he just turns and walks away??? later she asked for a chocolate pazookie he brought a chocolate chip pazookie she looks at him and says this is not a chocolate cookie it should be very dark brown almost black he looks again then walks away no words. He then comes by and grabs the wrong dessert and takes off no words, a few minutes later he shows up with the right dessert slaps it on the table and leaves no words again, a few minutes after that he brings our check slaps it down and zips off no words, and finally i put cash in the check  holder he picked it up quickly took off not a sound or even eye contact, he brought back my change and you guessed it slapped it down no words and split, he got a dollar tip. It seemed as though he took it all personal, never really tried to fix anything  or apologize and then took it out on us????? PAZOOKIE ON HIM!!!"
Jason G.,"San Diego, CA",170,450,33,4.0,10/14/2013,"The crispy jalapeno burger is excellent.  Maybe I was just in a burger mood, or maybe I'm just a sucker for crispy fried jalapenos.  I'm  not sure.  Nevertheless, this really hit the spot.  Paired with a Hopstorm IPA, this made me a very happy camper.  Nice outdoor patio with lots and lots of umbrellas at this location.  I really like how they have 3 different beers that are seasonal specials for fall.  Nice work, BJs!  I'll be back to try the pumpkin and Oktoberfest."
N A.,"Poway, CA",0,30,,4.0,10/28/2016,"Went here last week with some friends before we headed to an event.  I was surprised how busy it was on a Wed evening but we were seating right away.  Our server was very helpful and we placed our order.  Our drinks and salads came out fairly quickly, but that's when things took a very slow turn!  We waited what seemed like forever for our entrees.  We finally asked our server to pack them up to go as we could no longer wait.  He was very apologetic about the 40 minute wait for our food. Even after we asked for it to be packed to go, it still took another 10 minutes to get our food.  But in the end their great customer service saved the day.  Their manager comped our food that was to go, and only charged us for the salad and drinks that we had consumed.  We were pleasantly shocked as we had not complained or been upset, but really appreciated the gesture.  So not thrilled with the overly long wait for a meal, but very pleased with their response to our concerns!  And my pepperoni flatbread was delicious in the car on the way to our next stop!"
Robert H.,"San Marcos, TX",6,44,,2.0,9/8/2013,"Ok, well the emphasis is on my wife and I USED To stop in here about once a month. But the last 6 months has seen a continued lack of consistency. Plus kicking ourselves because we know that there are far better venues in SD. One gets used to famaliarity and that is a HUGE mistake in the food business, especially when we love food. So if you like screaming kids, mediocre food, big sports screens that you cannot hear, waiting 15+ minutes to get your final check taken and just an overall surface hospitality - this location is the place As of today we bid a continued farewell... good luck Bj's"
Steven C.,"Temecula, CA",0,14,,1.0,4/26/2016,"Walked in and we were pretty much the only table in the entire restaurant (a few people were at the bar). It was four of us. Our food took 30+ mins to come out, and we were like, the only guests at that time. Don't know how it takes that long. My hickory brisket burger had no mayo on it, nor did it have cheese. My wedge fries were beyond cold. While we were still eating (but almost done) he dropped off the check without asking if we needed anything else, or if we wanted a pizookie (who doesn't want one). So we just payed and left. This location is going downhill fast."
Bonnie G.,"Escondido, CA",977,950,2861,3.0,10/13/2011,"I'm going to update my review to 3 stars.  We went last night and I've decided I don't like their pizza.  While I am a die-hard fan of thin crust but I can appreciate a good deep dish pizza.  With that said, I do not like BJ's pizza.  We had a 'build your own pizza' with sausage, pepperoni, artichoke hearts, and green peppers.  All the toppings were good, but the dough just isn't good. We had an ahi tuna salad and that was good.  Plus, we had a half and half pizookie- half red velvet and half chocolate chunk.  Those were both good. The service has never been a problem here.  Not one of my first choices for dinner, but if we do go back, I'll order an entree instead of pizza."
Amy V.,"San Diego, CA",362,76,26,2.0,10/10/2015,"Went here for lunch and was pretty disappointed. There was a 20 minute wait which was to be expected and not a problem but once we did get that it took a while for servers even acknowledge us. When she did it took about 10 minutes to get our drinks and then our salad never came. The pizza came out along with an entrée about 40 minutes into us sitting down.  I let the server know that the salad never came and asked for it to be removed but instead she brought it over well after our pizza has been served. When she did, I told her that I didn't want it and she said no problem she would take it off the bill and I thought it was done with. However, when we got the bill the salad was still on there and the server was nowhere to be found. Instead of trying to track her down for $4 we ended up paying it, but it was quite disappointing that she didn't just remove it from the bill as asked.  The food was so so. I guess pretty par for the course for a big chain but disappointing nonetheless."
Pita L.,"Vista, San Diego, CA",32,60,41,3.0,4/4/2015,"Food was ok. I had the mahi mahi tacos which weren't so great. My waitress was alright, it was a busy night so she was a little rushed. I was in a good mood but she seemed to be kind of down and out which killed my vibe. All in all an alright place for some drinks and appetizers dunces the foods isn't all that special for its price."
Jae V.,"Miami, FL",16,22,3,1.0,5/9/2013,"If I could give BJ's less than a star, it would still be too many stars. This place is abhorrent!! The lack of customer service offered this evening was stellar. The hostess should be fired and the 2 servers we encountered should find new careers. We ended up with an rather unenthusiastic server my the name of ""Matt"" with a shaved head. His extraordinarily lackadaisical attitude only further fueled my dissatisfaction with this sham bar that parades as a ""restaurant"".   I see I am not the only patron that refuses a reprieve at BJ's, as evidence by the 2.5 star rating. Diner beware: you knew better and still ate here; SHAME on you!!!"
K R.,"Murrieta, CA",0,8,,4.0,5/24/2015,"I recently visited the Bjs in escondido with my family for dinner. We have eaten at Bjs for the past few years and we have all noticed the restaurant steadily decline in quality over the years. Food is not as well presented/as good as it once was which is a shame... Especially the pizza! Other than kitchen errors (food taking a long time, coming out cold, poor presentation, etc) the service remains fabulous. Each time my family and I come in we ask for Paige in the bar area. She is always very personable, caring, and genuinely wants the guest to enjoy their time to relax. So, if you decide to go to Bjs, as for Paige in the bar! Hopefully management can figure out the kitchen problems soon. Regardless, we will still come back to enjoy some good happy hour beers and hang out with Paige."
Joe F.,"San Diego, CA",379,24,3,2.0,8/7/2014,Beer is ok but I ordered the boneless wings and they were less than half an inch big. The bartender removed it from order and they apologized.  Apparently they are always that small at this location. Buyer beware!  The woman next to me got the bone in...  And they were three times the meat.
Robyn S.,"San Diego, CA",16,29,2,5.0,3/10/2015,If pizookies alone weren't enough of a reason and you need a little more convincing know that even during the happy hour the service is phenomenonal! Our server Thomas H.  went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed along with excellent recommendations. Doesn't hurt that happy hour prices are great as well!
