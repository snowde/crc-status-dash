Erika S.,"Escondido, CA",182,13,1,3.0,4/6/2014,"The Pros: Open late Good selection of food Very Upbeat and busy Lots of TV's The Cons: Food is mediocre  Expensive (14 dollars for a salad??) Service is really a hit or miss. This place isn't really one of my ""top"" places to eat, but It will do on those nights we are heading to a late night dinner or watching a sporting event. Not horrible, but not great."
Suzanne C.,"San Diego, CA",19,70,27,2.0,3/8/2015,"It took the hostess over a minute to even acknowledge that we even walked in the door. We gave our name and the number in our party, three, and told it would be a 10-15 min wait. Later when they were calling out names to be seated, they were calling out party of four with a completely different name so we assumed it was for someone else. Then one of hostesses came to ask us our name, she said ""Oh, I've been calling you."" We told her she was calling for a party of four and we are a party of three and that wasn't even our name so we didn't know you were calling our table. Our waitress was very nice and attentive. Food came out warm instead of hot like it had been sitting there for awhile. Wish we would have chosen a different restaurant in this area."
Kat D.,"San Diego, CA",84,13,,4.0,10/16/2013,"When my boyfriend and I are hungry, but can't decide where to eat; we go to BJ's. It's basically our go to dinner when we want to eat out, but don't feel like ordering pizza. The service is good, except I have to say sometimes the seating takes forever. I remember one time we waited for about 40 minutes just for a booth seat for three people. That was annoying. On the other hand, it can go really fast.  The food is pretty good, alright, and nothing special. I love their pizza and pasta, because their pizza is fluffy and thick and they serve a good portion of pasta. My favorite thing however is their pazookie, which is probably the best thing in the world. It's basically a giant, warm cookie in a plate with ice cream on top. It sounds common, but the way they do it leaves my mouth watering. Overall, if you want a date night or somewhere to eat for fun I would recommend this place. The price is fair, it's not the cheapest, but also not that expensive."
Jennifer G.,"Poway, CA",52,98,40,4.0,11/6/2014,"I know why now there are so many mixed reviews. First, the happy hour is awesome, the drinks were cheap and great. The ambience is lovely and perfect for a date. However the waiter was okay and it took 30 mins to bring out the dessert. She's wasn't very attentive to us, but another girl was very much so, she just wasn't our waiter... I shared a deep dish veggie pizza, which was awesome. I would come back here to enjoy happy hour, but not make any plans for after."
Katie C.,"Escondido, San Diego, CA",59,13,,2.0,12/6/2014,"Disappointed this evening. Normally BJs is a guaranteed win but tonight basic details were forgotten: salad plates left on table throughout entire meal, empty drinks, forgotten drink orders, forgotten ranch requests, server full of excuses."
Jeremy G.,"Alpine, CA",363,473,596,1.0,9/17/2014,"Second BJ's I've been to. The wait service simply sucked. The timing was way off getting appetizers and simple entrees so far apart that we were hungry all over again by the time we flagged down our waitress...or waiter...or waitress...or whom ever walked by. The food was mmmmmnot the greatest. The Pizzookie I was looking forward to was dry, burnt, and over all not worth the cost. The drinks were completely watered down with nearly no taste or alcohol content. I don't think I'll be returning."
Hannah C.,"Oceanside, CA",19,9,,2.0,5/4/2015,"Good food, but probably the worst service i have ever experienced. Our waitress was sweet, but it took 15 minutes before we got our waters, another 35 minutes for our appetizers and an additional hour for our main meal. The server came out at one point to say they ran out of macaroni noodles for Mac n cheese (so strange!)We ended up having a two hour dinner. The restaurant wasn't very busy as we sat down at 8:30pm. Very disappointed, we won't be returning."
Steve M.,"San Diego, CA",13,103,135,4.0,7/15/2015,The place is real busy but other than that great for meeting friends. Large selection of food  et
Carol M.,"San Diego, CA",0,22,3,3.0,6/14/2014,"My husband and I had dinner there last night. We had to wait about ten minutes for a table so we sat at the bar and waited for our buzzer to signal our table was ready.  The bartender was extremely friendly, as was all of the staff.  They could not have been more accommodating.  I had a glass of wine and my husband had a mixed drink.  When we got to our table, it was just perfect.  We ordered salads, steaks and baked potatoes.  Our waitress was very friendly and helpful, brought us waters immediately. and kept returning to check on us.  The steaks were excellent!  My husband had clam chowder and he said it was very good, creamy, clammy, with just the right seasonings.  The salad was fresh and tasty. The ONLY drawback was that our baked potatoes tasted like they were two days old, and they were kind of blackened and burned on the outside.  I am a cook and I know an old baked potato when I taste one.  Yuck.  Guys: get some fresh potatoes\ and don't serve me something that's been cooked and reheated!  It was a shame that an old potato had to spoil what was an otherwise excellent meal.  We didn't complain, I guess we should have, but I never want to be one of those customers that runs the staff ragged with complaints.  Anyway, next time I will just order extra veggies!"
Alaok D.,"San Diego, CA",1,75,,2.0,2/5/2013,"I'm sad to say that my earlier 5 star rating has been lowered to two stars based on recent visits. Both were essentially the same problem, but I will relate what happened on my most recent visit, Saturday, Feb. 2. We called ahead for seating which is a great thing - when it works. We arrived at 5 PM, and were told it was to be a 20 minute wait even after calling in. WTF? We were seated 30 minutes later. OK, they blew it on that one. We had a very pleasant server, none of what ensued was her fault. My wife ordered pasta of some sort, I ordered a NY steak, my daughter and fiance shared a pizza. Three of us got salads. IT TOOK 30 FLIPPING MINUTES TO BRING THE DAMN SALADS. So we ate them, and the entrees came. Well, some of them did, my steak was MIA. The server was apologetic, she said the manager was aware of the problem. It took at least 15 minutes to get my steak, which tasted great. The other three at the table also enjoyed watching me eat it since they were mostly done with their dinners. My daughter and fiance shared a dessert, my wife got the complimentary one for her birthday. I didn't need one, I was still eating my entree.  When the server presented the check, we had been comped the dessert. The manager had failed to make an appearance at our table, so I asked to speak to her. She was indifferent to the problem, only saying that she ""had heard something about it"". I proceeded to tell her about the failure of the call ahead seating thing, the 30 minute wait for salads after ordering and the botched steak dinner, and the only reply she had was ""uh, we were busy"". She did eventually offer an apology and comped the botched steak dinner, but I don't think I should have had to unload on her to get this concession. I don't like having to do things like that.   A similar incident happened a couple of months earlier, this time a pizza my daughter and fiance ordered arrived well before the other entrees arrived. This same manager was about as interested, as contrasted to the manager that I referenced in my original review, he was great. The sad thing here is that we all love BJ's food, but the system can't seem to get the food out of the kitchen and to the table.  Just for the record, this is the first time in my lifetime of dining out that I have ever had to ask to speak to a manager, I am not a chronic complainer."
Miki L.,"Long Beach, CA",274,155,774,2.0,2/3/2011,"I've finally decided that BJ's is just a 2.5 star restaurant in Yelp terms, regardless if its San Diego, Temecula, Fullterton or the one I ate at yesterday for lunch -- in Escondido.  I definitely would never choose to come here on my own, however, it was per the request of a vendor that my assistant and I meet him for lunch, so we met him for lunch here. One positive about this restaurant chain is the reasonable lunch time specials! The service was very slow and our waitress after about 15 minutes came over to take our order. My assistant ordered her usual, Chicken Teriyaki, I ordered the Chicken Strips (my usual) and our vendor ordered the Club Sandwich; both of the latter dishes came with fries and the both of us requested the Wedge fries.  The food was delivered about 15 minutes later. The waitress who delivered the plates didn't know who ordered what, which is somewhat disappointing because I thought that was the basic rule of a waitress/waiter... to order and serve starting with the person on the left. Needless to say that in addition to this, the wedge cut fries were not on my vendor's plate, instead the thin cut fries were; he was super disappointed and said that when he had been to BJ's previously the same thing had occurred. The waitress came back with a plate of wedge cut fries for him and left us alone until the check came. The service left a lot to be desired.  When my assistant and I arrived back to work, we immediately noticed that both of us were dying of thirst. The only time I ever have this experience is when I have a lot of soy sauce and this had not been the case yesterday; the fries were the common denominator and we decided they were loaded with sodium... so be careful if you are sensitive to salt!! Next time someone invites me to BJ's, I think I will decline the invitation!"
Audrey C.,"San Diego, CA",347,1172,345,3.0,10/25/2013,"Came here and got their burger, which was delicious.  Their cocktail drinks are also very good, but not too strong.  Their cookie icecream stuff is really good though."
Morgan H.,"Escondido, CA",4,30,5,1.0,1/5/2013,"No wonder this place is called BJ's... it sucks!  And not in a good way. We went here with our family, a large party, after a family funeral.  Besides making a reservation and still having to wait an hour to be seated, we then continued to wait just to get drinks which was an ordeal and took an hour.  Saying the staff was not attentive is being kind about the service.  Several of us had to get up and hunt them down just to get someone to come over to our table.  We were a party of 15, it's not like we were easy to miss.   They were not knowledgeable about the menu and when asked about ingredients due to food allergies, we were given inaccurate information.  And someone at our table had an allergic reaction to their meal - luckily it was mild this time.  The food came out of the kitchen very sporadically - most of it made wrong.   One didn't even get his meal as the waitress completely forgot to put it in to the kitchen.  So he had to wait an additional 30 minutes while the rest of us ate.  After ordering the second time, she came back to the table 10 minutes later and said, ""sorry, we are all out.""  So he had to order something different.  And then too boot, he got food poisoning the next morning for his flight back to Chicago. When we complained to the manager about the entire experience, they didn't care.  She offered one complimentary dessert for the entire table that no one even wanted and wasn't any good."
James P.,"San Diego, CA",0,4,1,5.0,3/21/2015,"Delicious food. Their wings were cooked perfectly, nice and crispy. I also got the margarita flatbread which was also very good, I def recommend. The Service from Gizeppe was fantastic. He was very helpful and courteous."
Jennifer W.,"Los Angeles, CA",533,189,91,3.0,1/21/2013,"Not bad, not bad at all. After begging and pleading from the Mr. I finally gave in and went. And FYI, I didn't want to go before because well honesty I've been on a diet. Whoohoo!! I love cheat days! We went during the busy holiday season and we had a party of three that got seated fairly quickly for an almost packed house. My first impression was that I loved the interior. Our server was friendly and prompt when it came to taking our order, checking up on us, and delivering us our food. I likey! As for the food, we ordered the Thai shrimp lettuce wraps for appy, shared a large pizza (BJ's Favorite Pizza & Chicken Bacon Ranch), and Pizookie Trio (White Chocolate Macadamia, Cookies n Cream, & Chocolate Chunk).  Overall, the food was good, but nothing I would rave endlessly about. I would recommend the dessert and Harvest Hefeweizen beer though!"
Andy C.,"Carlsbad, CA",193,1233,3341,4.0,9/4/2013,"My friends and I came here the other night and what a fun time. I love the atmosphere of this place and it just a great overall fun family friendly restaurant.  I came here to put my name down since Friday nights cane get a little crazy with the wait and after waiting about 30 minutes, I decided to check in to see how much longer, since I didn't get a pager at all. I was told that it would be a few short minutes and our table would be ready.... well, a few short minutes turned into another 20 minutes and the servers didn't apologize for anything or saying sorry for the wait that we they didn't know how to calculate or anything. This greatly brought concern and just that this part of the restaurant (who is the face since that is who I see first) just doesn't care at all.  Our server Natalie was a joy!!! She was so friendly and timely with our drinks when we sat down. Always had another refill for us ready to go even though we were there at the peek dinner rush time. She never stopped smiling and was always so happy!!! We ordered our drinks and then placed our food order. It seemed like she had a big party too but she still came in and checked in our table to make sure we were doing ok, and ensured to us that our food would be coming shortly. Sure enough, our food was at our table. This is what separates Natalie apart from other servers... SHE WAITED TILL WE WERE DONE CHEWING AND TAKING A BITE TILL SHE ASKED US HOW OUR FOOD WAS!!!!! THANK YOU!!!! You do not how inconvenient it is when people are just there and you've taking your first bite and they ask you how your food is, or they ask you how it is seconds after the food runner has just put down the plates.  After being completely stuffed, Natalie managed to talk us into getting some mini pozokies (spelling?) and we were done.... This is one of the best experiences I've ever had all thanks to Natalie!!!!"
Rox C.,"San Diego, CA",0,14,,1.0,3/6/2016,"We love BJs restaurants, but this particular location on Friday night 3/4/2016 7pm, was not pleasant. We got seated and nobody came and served us for 30 minutes! One waiter kept starring at us, as we started back with our 2 crying children. We sat and even asked front desk who our waiter/ waitress was twice and they told us that person was coming. And never did. So we went up to the front desk and asked for the manager, and he told us ""I don't know what to say."" Um maybe go and get the waiter? Or sit us someplace else and offer us a good time? Nope. That manager did not care he lost a costumer.  Poor management skills I'd say. Won't be coming back to this location!"
Justin A.,"Poway, CA",0,2,1,5.0,2/7/2016,"Surprised by the low rating this location has. Our server Anthony was very courteous, the food was great and management even comped our appetizers and personally apologized for our food having come out a little slow."
Megan B.,"San Diego, CA",132,123,4,5.0,7/11/2013,"This is definitely hands down my favorite place to eat! For so many reasons: The menu is huge, there really is something for everyone. So far everything I have tried has been delicious :) waiting staff is great an very helpful.  They have amazing lunch specials and happy hour prices!"
Lainey L.,"Miami, FL",2080,333,2150,4.0,3/7/2011,"This is one of the better BJs I went to.  Stopped by for a couple beers and pizza on a Sunday evening. Our server Sarah, was on it! She was very helpful and made sure we were taken care of. I was definitely happy with her.  The food was good, we order a small Chicken BBQ pizza. It was about 6 slices so that was plenty for the 2 of us. We had a few beers then finished it off some dessert. I walked away satisfied & a happy girl! =]"
