Sarah R.,"Simi Valley, CA",66,29,18,4.0,11/22/2014,Had a great experience at this BJ's our waiter was fantastic his name is Joshua M very attentive but not over bearing. Food came fast and correct. We left happy
Heather J.,"Escondido, CA",2,42,2,4.0,4/13/2014,The food is soooo good :)  I highly reccommend the Mediterranean pizza! SO good!!! A pazookie is a must have here! The avacado eggs rolls seem to be a new item on the menu but they are good too! I've had a wide variety of drinks here and enjoyed them all!  5 stars for the food! Minus one star for the spotty hit or miss service
Marisol B.,"Honolulu, HI",946,285,1097,4.0,8/31/2010,"To our server Nathan, You turned my frown upside down. Thanks for the happy ending O:) Sincerely, Richard the Birthday Boy ---------------------------------- Insider Tip: If you have a party of 15 or more, do the ALL YOU CAN EAT specialty pizza and salad- it includes non-alcoholic drinks, tax and gratuity for $17/per person, and you get to take the leftovers home *wOOt*"
Carmen V.,"San Jose, CA",1507,2390,10401,2.0,6/20/2013,"I had a friend moving back from living in Downtown to the RB hood, I wanted to introduce him to a brewery/pizza place I didn't know until recently, located at the North County mall: BJ brewhouse. The crowd is not as young and the waiters not as jovial as in Karl's but you need to try new things! I liked the decoration with all those colorful bottles very well paired and organized (I think they are indeed decorations and the drinks served come from the 'backstage' bottles). I did not find the happy hour to be very cheap, so this won't probably will be a place I will frequent any time soon, but those calamari with Stone IPA were a good pair."
Joe Q.,"San Diego, CA",80,364,161,3.0,2/21/2011,"The restaurant has a nice layout.  It's a sports bar that separates the dining area from the bar area, but the bar area is a lot more generous to its customers compared to other places.  It actually has about 5-6 booth like tables, so when you take advantage of that happy hour you don't gotta sit at the bar or some tiny high table.  The happy hour deals are great.  They offer deals on their flatbread pizzas, sliders, almost all appetizers, beer and cocktails.  That's a good enough deal to have a whole meal in the bar area.  The beers on tap may not be as many as Yardhouse, but there is a big selection. However, the food quality is mixed.  The chicken tenders are great.  Crispy outside, warm inside and an accompanying honey mustard sauce.  The spinach artichoke dip came with lots of broken chips.  It was hot, but not much flavor.  Sliders had dry meat and needed ketchup to get some moisture in there.  Flatbread pizza was a little oily.  I didn't eat the middle pieces because it was too oil soaked and soft. This is a good bar place, not really something I would want to have a sit down dinner.  There's a humongo TV right behind the bar, so it makes a great place to watch a game."
Michelle T.,"San Diego, CA",0,17,1,1.0,12/30/2014,"I'm not sure whether they were just not prepared for a lunch rush or what, but our experience was very disappointing. We three ladies, accompanied by three toddlers, waited 20 minutes before our order was taken, and another 30 before the food arrived. With squirmy, hungry toddlers, you can imagine what an eternity this must have felt like. By the time our food (only soup and salad!) arrived, we had been sitting there for 50 minutes. By then the toddlers were on the verge of meltdown and so we had to shovel our food into our mouths before rushing out. Not at all the experience one looks forward to in a restaurant. I wish I could have my $22 back. The worst thing was that we never received an apology or even an acknowledgement that things were taking much longer than they should have. Not a restaurant I plan on returning to or recommending."
Jim D.,"Carlsbad, CA",5,6,,1.0,5/24/2014,Friend's meal was horrible and the replacement also. Manager handled it poorly. Think before patronizing this BJs. Usually good here but tonight was marginal at best.
K B.,"San Diego County, CA",0,18,,1.0,9/15/2015,"Service was good. My co-worker and I were served Caesar salad's with very brown, wilted lettuce. We asked for new salads and they returned - the exact same way. Looked like they just mixed yesterday's lettuce in with fresh lettuce. Gross. Not to mention the salad completely lacked flavor. My pizza was undercooked in the middle and the cheese wasn't even melted. It tasted like a pizza hut pizza. I had stomach pain for the rest of the day. :( Go to the Carlsbad location, much better food."
Bernadette A.,"San Diego, CA",141,311,316,5.0,11/2/2010,"I like this location a lot more than the stuffy La Jolla location. The restaurant is bigger and feels more like a brewery. Bigger= more seating= less wait time. There's an actual bar here too! That's a plus for people who just want to stop in for a drink and some appetizers. They have an extensive menu. I particularly like the avocado eggrolls, white pizza and parmesan chicken. Fat, fat, fat.  If you do decide to eat a pizza here, finish it before the grease settles and end up feeling bad about eating it. It tastes too good to feel bad.  Did I mention the beer yet?? Must try all of them.  The best part about this location is the mall! After lunch or dinner, you can walk off the calories while you shop."
Chrissie O.,"Escondido, CA",251,807,857,2.0,8/27/2010,I finally decided to check this place out with my nephews.  I heard the service sucks but I wanted to try it myself.  Went around 1230 today and was seated within 5 minutes.  I thought that was great since I usually pass by this place and it is always crowded.   It is a nice looking restaurant.  Very spacious and welcoming.   It took awhile to get the food but they didn't serve it all at once.  Even with the drinks.  2 drink orders came out but the 3rd took a few more minutes.   I had the fetuchinni alfredo lunch portion.  I didn't specifically tell them i wanted chicken in it but they gave it to me with chicken.  and my nephews ordered mac and cheese.  one of the mac and cheese took awhile to come out as well.  When we got the food it was on the borderline of warm to cold food.  My nephew took one bite from his mac and cheese and had a disgusted look on his face.  His mac and cheese was cold.  I was hungry but just started eating away but he didn't want to eat his food so I had to ask them to heat it up.  I thought it would take less than 5 minutes but no it didn't.  10-15 min later when i was all done with my food I asked them about it.  They then brought out one but there was another one I sent back to them.  They didn't want it to sit out.  My nephews just ended up sharing it because they took too long to give us the food.  It tasted like the mac and cheese from the box which it probably is.   Anyways they were nice about it and ended up giving the mac and cheese for free so one star for that.   Second star is for the pazookies.  We got the pazookie trio for the 3 of us so we each had one.  I thought it was delicious.  Brownie and ice cream together is delicious. I'd probably go back but not anytime soon.  I want to try the bar and get more pazookies.
Rachel W.,"San Marcos, CA",6,14,15,4.0,10/12/2013,"This Bj's was fairly good. I ordered a mini Mediterranean pizza with fried artichokes, salad and an apple fruit crumbly pizookie. All of the food was well cooked and it was very satisfying. Not the best food I've eaten but it was decent. You won't be disappointed if you enjoy eating gourmet pizza's :)"
Kayleena S.,"San Diego, CA",104,233,69,3.0,10/8/2014,Not too busy of a night and experienced the slowest service... I also ordered a second alcoholic beverage and never received it. The food saved the visit- the flatbread pizza was excellent and Smore pizooke was something amazing to write about!
Marvin S.,"San Diego, CA",689,491,1260,3.0,1/21/2011,"This is what I have came to expect out of BJ's. It's not OUTSTANDING, but it's pretty good. Most of my friends come here for the microbrew, which I know is really really good. I come here for either their pizza, their pulled pork sandwich or pizookie(big cookie covered in ice cream)! This place is huge and it gets busy. Krystle ordered their Santa Fe Chicken Salad. Jenna ordered their big ridiculous baked potato. Jeff got their Chicken Club. All of which everyone really liked! Customer service was great as the server made sure our iced teas were topped off. I definitely wouldn't mind going again. A little pricey, but a great environment right before leaving on deployment! I could have used a few beers, that's for sure!"
Marissa P.,"Fontana, CA",7,9,4,1.0,8/2/2014,"My son ordered the Mac n cheese and fresh fruit off the kids menu, the fruit looked semi frozen and had that mushy transparent look. The Mac n cheese was cold and I had to ask to have it warmed. I ordered the soup and salad combo that was pictured on the menu served in a bread bowl and I was not informed I had to ask for the bread bowl even though I pointed at it when I ordered, to top it off the clam Chowder was salty. My husband ordered the ribeye steak with baked potato and rice, the ribeye tasted ok it lacked flavor but my table didn't have salt or pepper shakers. The baked potato was ok and the rice had a weird taste. Needless no say I don't think I'll be returning to BJ's any time soon."
Emily B.,"San Diego, CA",0,3,2,4.0,1/20/2015,Their hand-crafted root beer is good. The only thing about the restaurant that I don't like is how dark it is.
Ino-chi R.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,59,,2.0,8/9/2014,I've eaten at other BJ's and their food and service has always been pretty good. The Escondido location always has bad service. It is obvious that management does not read or care about what is written about them on YELP. Moved down from the Pasadena area and don't know why this place is so packed on Friday and Saturday eve's. Management needs to get rid of the inept host/hostess that greet you...talk about not having the sharpest tools in the tool shed...no specifics to talk about...just expect slow and bad service
Derek D.,"Vista, CA",1,21,6,2.0,1/10/2016,"Let me start by saying BJ's is USUALLY one of my favorites, but today was a different story. I usually order the Chicken Alfredo which is awesome. Recently I tried the unlimited soup and salad at the Carlsbad/Encinitas location. Their Clam Chowder was absolutely amazing. We often come only in the winter months specifically for the Grand Cru, which is one of the best beers my wife and I have ever had. Today we came for that specifically while it should still be in season and to eat while we are here. Not only was our favorite beer here not on tap, (they had already converted to some ""Committed IPA"") they did not have any bottled in the back either. With a secondary choice in hand, I diverted my go-to pasta choice and ordered the fish and chips. Horrible decision. It tasted smokey and burnt as if they had been using the same oil for all of 2015, and we are currently 1/2 way through January of 2016. I tasted my son's chicken tenders, other son's mini corn dogs and the same result. Smokey and burnt tasting. Wishing I was oils have went with the Chicken Alfredo. The only thing that left me happy was the last gulp of Hef."
Raul A.,"Temecula, CA",2,22,20,5.0,9/9/2013,"I just stop by had a great dinner with my client, love BJ Brewery. Service was really fast and good you really can't go wrong on the Tomato soup. Rachael the waitress was very informative with the menu and her service was really great highly recommend to anyone that is in the mood for good food and great Beer.  RA"
Marcia B.,"Escondido, CA",0,6,,2.0,1/11/2015,Chicken Tortilla SOUP EXCELLENT - SERVICE HORRIBLE We went for a quick lunch at 2:30 in the afternoon and didn't get out until 4:00.  We ended up asking the check the moment the food came so we didn't have to wait another 30 minutes.  BJ's come on get some better more attentive servers or tell your hostess not to overload an area with more people than one server can handle
T P.,"Fallbrook, CA",0,2,,3.0,2/27/2015,"One of our favorite restaurants that we eat at in Temecula, which that restaurant gets 5 stars from me.  We happened to be in Escondido last week and ate at that location. Never again. I'll stick with the Temecula location.  Service was not good. Sooooo slow and they weren't very busy. It was 2:00 in the afternoon.  Our waitress constantly disappeared. We had to go fetch our own silverware and napkins, waited 15 min to get buffalo sauce which the potato skins were cold by the time we got the sauce. :(. Waited forever for 4 meals, waited 15+ min to give our dessert order (couldn't find waitress) and an additional 20+ min to actually get the dessert. She was quick to give us our bill but once again she disappeared, so we waited 15 more min for her to come back to get our credit card. The table next to us were complaining about the same thing. Good grief!"
