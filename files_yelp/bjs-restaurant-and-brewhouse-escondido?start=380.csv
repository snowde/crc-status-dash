Felicia F.,"San Marcos, CA",1,18,,1.0,8/3/2014,"Worst service I have ever had at a restaurant!!!! The food was cold or incorrect. I ordered a mini pizookie, the waitress put a full size into the computer even after she checked that I said MINI. The waitress was awful.... she obviously did not know that customers would like their drinks refilled. Maybe check in on your table more than once every 30 minutes! They were not even busy so there was no excuse... Once she got a new table she was very attentive to them. I would skip this restaurant at all costs."
Terry S.,"San Diego, CA",98,117,113,3.0,5/6/2014,"Always good not great.  Food is average but selection is extensive so it is a good place to go to for groups.  I always get one of the salads , large and filling.  The  avocado egg rolls are a good starter.  Will take reservations for large groups.  Bar gets busy."
James P.,"Alturas, CA",18,13,16,2.0,9/16/2012,"Not happy at all with the service at this location. Our waitress barely came around to serve us except to get our order and drop off the check. Plates kept piling up after salad, main course, and dessert. Was never offered a refill on drinks, always had to ask. Waitresses kept hanging out near the front and back register and chatting instead of helping customers. This place is ridiculous!!! I've been to several different locations and this one is by far the WORST!!! Manager needs to start cracking the whip on the employees. The only good thing was food which is why there is a 2 star rating."
Brian D.,"Mira Loma, CA",71,14,36,2.0,8/16/2013,"I have gone to many different BJ's locations all over the place and for the most part the food is good and the service is as well. My visit to this location in Escondido didn't fit the bill.  The grilled chicken baked potato was severely undercooked. We asked for it to be replaced, which they did, but it took over 15 mins for us to flag down our server. I had to ask the hostess to find him and send him our way. By the time it came back the rest of our party had finished with their meals so that person rushed to eat the new potato, which was also undercooked, but at that point it wasn't worth sending it back. I needed a drink refill and the server failed to notice my empty glass at the end of the table and even after I asked for a refill the server came back twice without my drink. The location wasn't overly busy, so I wasn't sure why we had all the delays.  I tried the new BBQ slider and chicken breast and it was mediocre at best. The only saving grace was the pizookie, which would be nearly impossible to screw up. Maybe it was just an off day, or who knows. I would come back, but I would make sure I was prepared for this type of experience."
Katie K.,"Irvine, CA",90,78,107,2.0,3/29/2014,"Definitely not impressed with the food at this BJ's. I ordered the seared scallops and was wondering why they even bothered to call them seared. They were white through and through.  Super disappointing and on top of that, the asparagus looked not very fresh. Dessert was great as always, however. The chocolate chip pizooki almost made up for the sub-par meal. Almost."
Steve C.,"Albany, OR",0,10,,1.0,6/7/2014,"Sadly this place has gone to the crapper.  The food is often cold or overcooked, the manager often is unapologetic,  and on weekends it takes forever for them to sit you. We just left this location for the last time. They sat someone else instead of us then had us wait supposedly to be the next... then sat 3 parties that arrive after we did... goodbye B'S Escondido, your manager is incompetent, rude and conceited..."
Me A.,"San Diego, CA",0,5,,1.0,6/23/2012,"Great food BUT very poor customer service 1st - server brought the appetizers but no utensils or napkins provided. had to ask but these were not provided right away! 2nd - finished with appetizers, still no utensils/napkins. had to ask again! 3rd - main dishes served, still no utensils/napkins. had to ask again, mgr not even apologetic! 4th - server did not offer refills on water; only served one refill for strawberry lemonade but the glass was cracked on two sides. informed the server about cracks and she took the drink away but never returned with another refill. again, server non-apologetic about this! End Result: NO TIP for server --- zero !!! -- because server does not deserve a tip. BJ's needs to work very hard on their customer service effort. At this stage of the economy, they need to keep customers coming back, not pushing them away."
Hilda G.,"San Diego, CA",10,23,10,2.0,6/1/2014,The waitress was so slow. She brought me my root beer and it was warm so I asked her for a cup of ice. It took her 10 minutes to bring me the ice. Next I ordered the fish and chips since the waitress recommend it and they tasted burned. It   long to get our food that by then I was just so hungry I just ate. I order my daughter the kids meal and the fries were so hard. My man's meal was good to him but 1 out of 3 is no bueno. $40 for nasty food I will not be returning to this location. Been to the one in mission valley and never have been disapointed.
Shannon S.,"Escondido, CA",503,605,187,3.0,10/22/2012,"This place kind of reminds me if Oggi's and Cheesecake factory got together. There's usually a wait, the menu is long, and the bartenders can't make any drinks that aren't featured on the menu. I ordered a Grey Goose martini, eXXXtra dirty, however it was missing the very thing that makes it dirty. I asked for some olive juice to correct the problem, and I was given a shot glass full. I don't like correcting my own drinks so minus one star for the bartender.  BJ's seems to market themselves as a pizza and beer place. I can't say I've ever actually had pizza from here, but their salads are pretty good and aren't your standard salads that you'll find all over town. My favorite is the steak and grilled veggie salad, which is served warm. It's filling without being too heavy."
Coral S.,"San Diego, CA",1,48,3,1.0,9/14/2014,I ordered a burger medium rare and received one that was extremely well done. It was absolutely dry and tasteless. In addition someone in a party had to wait over 5 minutes for a side of mayonnaise. Shoestrings fries are good though. Won't be coming back here though.
Ashley M.,"Escondido, CA",207,7,,4.0,12/1/2015,"This location is definitely my fiancée and I's go to place. Usually it is mediocre service, but the last visit was awesome. They estimated the wait time to be 15-20 minutes, yet they got us to a table under ten. LOVED THAT! Also we got a super awesome server, I believe her name was Savannah. Even on a busy Friday night around dinner time (the busiest) she seemed to be very stress free and super attentive to us. Answered all our questions and more. We absolutely loved the outdoor seating as well, I was wearing shirts and it was freezing and I was more than comfortable under the heater!  Also, the manager of the restaurant took time to come over to our table and asked if everything was up to par and if we were enjoying our time at their restaurant. I was almost dumbfounded by that considering I've never gotten service like that before. This is why we never go to another location! You won't be disappointed"
Tim T.,"San Diego, CA",56,42,8,4.0,7/31/2013,"For my wife and I, this is a great place to grab lunch and a beer when we're out and about on the weekend.  Since it's in the mall, parking is very plentiful (although I would guess that it's hell around the holidays). The waiters are always helpful, and we tend to ask a bunch of questions to make sure we get exactly what we want.  BJ's never disappoints!  The beer selection is good because they have a large variety.  But I would like to see more stout choices. My wife likes to eat vegie/healthy and I like to try new things, so they have lots for us to choose from.  The first time we visited I was expecting to see ""mall"" pricing that would spoil the place, but the prices were good. If you want t great place to do lunch, BJ's is the place."
Gary R.,"San Diego, CA",811,680,1769,2.0,4/26/2010,"Not impressed. Bringing my guests to this restaurant was a mistake on a Saturday afternoon. The restaurant was understandably busy due to the lunch crowd; we waited 20 minutes to be seated. No problem -- we were cool with that. While waiting, however, I observed an elderly couple walk away from the greeter in disgust because they had been waiting for over an hour and they had never been called to be seated. Yikes! Not a good sign. After being seated, we placed our appetizer orders and, shortly thereafter, placed our lunch orders. The first error occured when they brought out our salads before the appetizer arrived. Very disappointing. Then, when I eagerly placed my fork into what should have been a caesar salad and brought the first bite to my mouth, my taste buds vehemently protested. I had been brought a honey-mustard dressed salad (second mistake). Ick! When the appetizer finally arrived (about 25 minutes after it was requested), the main entrees arrived shortly thereafter (third mistake). Ugghhh. Serious timing issues going on.  Our appetizer, the avacado egg rolls, were hands down the money for the afternoon. Delicious. Sublime! Had I known that my turkey club sandwich was gong to be mediocre, I think I would have just requested a second order of avacado egg rolls and ate them in its place. Seriously, people, the avacado egg rolls are the bomb.  The waitress was sweet and polite. However, BJ's has serious service issues right now. Perhaps it is because they are still a burgeoning new establishment. Besides the egg rolls, the food was just o.k. I've definitely had better sandwiches elsewhere."
Scott P.,"Escondido, CA",285,562,45,4.0,5/2/2010,"I decided to go to BJ's with my family today and we had a great time.  Westfield North County has been without a brewpub for almost a year, so we were all happy when we found out  this location was open. We got there just before noon, and were seated right away. Our waiter Will, was great. He got our drinks out to us quickly and as usual the beer was fresh and tasty. I chose a PM Porter which is made at their brewery.  We ordered the chicken pot stickers which were very tasty. You get six pan-seared dumplings filled with chicken, green onions, Chinese yellow chives, ginger and garlic. It's served with a wonderful soy ginger sauce. For the main course I ordered grilled bbq chicken sliders. They were topped with crispy onion strings and a smoky BBQ sauce made with their red ale which is also tasty. The dish also includes lettuce, tomatoes and pickles that accompany the four sliders.  I recommend getting a side fries since it's only a dollar more and you get a healthy amount.   We also go spaghetti marinara which was flavorful. It says a lot when a place can make a simple dish well. The third dish we received was the Angus beef sliders and those always please. The patties are well done with grilled onions and ketchup and also include  tomatoes, lettuce and pickles on the side. The final dish we ordered was the Honey Crisp Chicken Salad.  It includes crisp, chopped lettuce with a tasty honey mustard dressing, topped with tenderloins of lightly breaded, deep fried chicken, toasted almonds, cucumber, hard boiled eggs, corn and tomatoes. I will say the place was packed by the time we left, so it's a good idea to get there early. They open up at 10am on the weekend, and who doesn't like a good pizza for breakfast right?"
Sara Y.,"Escondido, CA",217,493,62,4.0,3/23/2010,"The official opening of this location (in North County Fair Mall) is Monday, March 29, 2010, but someone in my office scored an invitation for people to enjoy the food for free.  Hells yes, I will gladly take that off your hands!! It felt like every employee hired was working during today's lunch hour.  Maybe that is how they are being weeded out.  Whatever the case, we had LOTS of attention from the waiter, food runners and the bus staff.  All empty plates and cups were removed right away.  Frankly, I enjoyed the attention because I don't think it will ever be that good again.   On the other hand, it took a long time to get our very simple lunch order - soup and salad for me, mini pizzas for the other ladies in the group, and drinks.  If they had a handful more of people from the floor working in the kitchen, we may have gotten our food quicker.  I will give them the benefit of the doubt since they are still working out the kinks, getting used to the menu, getting used to the kitchen flow and getting used to a busy lunch hour. The food was tasty and what I have come to expect from BJ's.  We did get a free Pizookie too.  I can see the hype, but dude...it is waaaaaaay too sweet for me.  No thanks.  Pass the fries and beer please!"
Tiffany L.,"Redding, CA",90,25,13,5.0,4/11/2014,"Went here tonight with my husband. I honestly don't have anything bad to say other than I wish our pizza was cut better, it just wasn't cut through all the way and was hard to separate the slices. Other than that it was great. Service was great an even when our waitress was about to take her break, she came over and introduced the girl that would be covering for her until he got back. I am a huge fan of cider beer and they had a few options which makes me super happy, as well as Mojitos! We had 2 apps, 4 beers, and an 11"" personal pizza and our bill was only $32! Happy hour pricing is fantastic! Will be coming back again soon since we are new to the area!"
Mike T.,"Escondido, CA",0,7,,1.0,6/16/2014,We stopped here because we saw only a handful of people there seemed very slow. I ordered the Bison Burger - which took forever to make-- my first bite was like bitting into a piece of leather- bun was hard and dry burger was way over cooked. The waiter  ordered a new one for me which came out in about 5 min. The bun was soaked in sauce which I had asked my waiter to keep on the side....and i believe the burger was just a plain ole burger patty not Bison meat. Worst burger to date. Waiter didn't charge me which is the only good thing about my visit to BJ's
Bilbo B.,"San Marcos, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/1/2015,"The worst food I have ever eaten. This weird lady looked like she was ready to kill us. Service was horrible and EXTREMELY SLOW. WARNING DO NOT EAT HERE, YOUR LIFE MAY DEPEND ON IT. There was this annoying little child screaming in the restaurant making it hard for anyone to enjoy their food. Their lasagna is a sorry excuse for edible material. It was just packaged ravioli stacked on top of each other. The flatbread pizzas were exceedingly undesirable. Although some dishes were flavorful, I would not recommend this ""restaurant"" to anyone."
Evan S.,"Poway, CA",13,58,2,3.0,9/13/2012,"So my friends and family have told me the service here STINKS! Yet i needed to experience it first hand. Was not greeted upon entering and the hostess did not return to seat me and come to the front after seating another couple.  YOU CAN EXPECT TO WAIT FOR A TABLE CALL AHEAD ON NIGHTS The food was good, cheap enough.  I got mac n cheese of which my friend got as well, she has visited BJ's before and said that the mac n cheese tasted better there before but i thought different and enjoyed myself. Service, hm i have experienced better. Waitress asked how everything was and refilled drinks and asked if we wanted desert.  Overall A-OK"
Joseph F.,"San Diego, CA",0,24,3,1.0,12/28/2015,This location is always busy.  One time they ran out of Root Beer.  They said they don't brew the Root Beer on site.  The manger was frumpy and ruder that her staff.  we have avoided this location ever since.
