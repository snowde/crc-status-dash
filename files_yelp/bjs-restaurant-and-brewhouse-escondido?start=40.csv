Bree M.,"Poway, CA",399,244,330,2.0,8/28/2016,"This is a good example of why I gravitate toward independently owned establishments. I do believe BJ's began with the intention of being a solid pizza/brewery house. Somewhere along the way, they lost all sense of what is truly important in the service industry- SERVICE. The menu at BJ's is extensive, but not so much that they should not be able to handle it. We came in at 5:30. Party of 7- 3 younger kids, 1 teenager and 3 adults. When we arrived it was pretty mellow and none of the other tables were occupied. We had decent service in the beginning. There was no issues in bringing a bottle of good wine and waters and 3 appetizers to a table - before most of the party had not arrived. We felt like once the other tables were filled, we were forgotten. It took us 20 minutes to get a slice of cheese on a plate for a kids cheeseburger meal that they forgot the cheese on! We were never checked on, or even spoken to as fellow humans... other than taking an order and putting us through the BJ's machine. The food was palatable. I cannot say any of our meals stood out. I'm not a fan of less than 100%. BJ's in Esco is far from breaking the 80% mark. Our seared ahi salads were mediocre (I'm an asshole for ordering ahi in BJ's) Meals were served so staggered, we didn't have anyone eating at the same time.  This restaurant is thriving on people who visit the mall and have a one-time meal, happy hour or event here. You won't find a local crowd here, even if you dig deep."
Michelle L.,"San Marcos, CA",1,8,2,4.0,10/6/2017,"This place was pretty packed for a Thursday night, my family and I had to wait about 25 minutes before we were seated. Besides the wait, the service was amazing and the food was good. Our waiter made sure our water cup was always full, something I really appreciate since most places aren't so attentive with that. The waiter also brought my stepfather a free boozie for his birthday, in addition to the one we already ordered (I highly recommend getting one of these because they're SO good. The melted cookie and ice cream goes well together). Another plus about this location is that there  are flat screen TVs everywhere, so you don't have to worry about missing a sports game."
Sergio L.,"San Diego, CA",1,12,,2.0,7/3/2017,"Food is inconsistent. I've been to this location 4 times. Ow and every time you get a different level of service and food quality as well. However, this last time was just bad. My wife and I found ourselves constantly having to hunt down our server just to get a refill on our drinks. At one point is was comical. Our drinks were empty and had been for about 7 minutes. I had to stop eating because I didn't want to choke in my own food and the server walked by and said if I wanted a to go box, when yet my food wasn't even half way done being eaten. I respond sed with no, I've been waiting for a drink. Staff is very dismissive here, and it's like they just expect your tips versus actually working for one. **update** Less stars due to management responding to this but never followed up with me. They display a false sense of genuine care."
Lim K.,"San Diego, CA",0,374,177,4.0,2/26/2017,"We went to BJ's for lunch for the first time and shared a couple of dishes: kale and roasted Brussels sprouts salad and the spicy pig pizza.   The salad was very good.  The pizza was tasty; however, the ingredients on the pizza were not evenly distributed.  It looked sloppy and a couple of pieces had mostly pineapples on top.    The service was excellent.  We like hot spicy foods so the availability of the Tabasco and Sriracha sauce was great."
Ray G.,"Escondido, CA",1,33,,4.0,4/19/2017,First visit to BJ's and really enjoyed the brisket burger. The service (Sarah) was great. I will be back again now that I know they have good food.  Good job.
David M.,"Pauma Valley, CA",0,5,,4.0,10/3/2017,This place has always been amazing. The pizza is on a whole other level the dough is soft and airy as well as the crust. The deep dish ziti is the second best thing on the menu the different flavors from the meats and cheese and pasta go together well. You can't go to BJ's without getting a pazookie and the best one of them all is the peanut butter pazookie. This place is always busy for a reason.
Bonnie M.,"Pismo Beach, CA",83,7,,5.0,10/2/2017,Had the bacon brisket burger and it was amazing!  They flood you with drinks without having to ask. Great service and friendly.
Brooke B.,"Escondido, CA",182,136,61,3.0,9/23/2016,"I typically have decent service here, but the last few times I've gone I've felt like the service aspect is lacking a bit. The food is still good, and they have lots of options. I do feel like things are a little bit over-priced, but for a place like this I would expect that. Their servers need more experience perhaps. Favorites: Chicken Alfredo Pasta (w/broccoli), Chicken Bacon Ranch Pizza, BBQ Chopped Salad, Chocolate Chip PAZOOKIE!"
Samuel D.,"San Diego, CA",100,291,1419,3.0,1/27/2016,"Came here a couple times before making a current update and this BJ's location sure has earned another star.  First occasion was again with a large party. Notice that the waiters at our table were very attentive especially to late comers in the party. Communication was constant and friendly; I was quite impressed. Food came out quickly fresh and quickly.   -Ahi Salad (a very large salad with plenty of fresh ahi, worth trying if you like ahi) The most recent time coming here was for happy hour. Open seating in the bar area. Great service and delicious food. Ordered a couple special drinks however, they could use better mixes.  Started off with... -BJ's Bloody Mary (you can totally tell it was not mixed well. Came straight from premade juice. NOT recommended) -Long Island (was made perfectly) -A Drink Like That (not a very refreshing drink. has a bitter taste that doesnt go down well) Venture out with Grey Goose Vodka, BACARDI 151 Rum, DeKuyper Pucker Sour Apple, DeKuyper Pucker Island Punch, BJ's fresh sweet & sour and a splash of Sierra Mist.  Appetizers -Margarita Flat Bread (light. crisp. love that basil; gives a nice flavor of ingredients) -NEW Lemon Pepper Dry Rub Wings (my fave. so crispy, tender, meaty, and seasoned perfectly. if you love wings this is a must try) -shoe string fries (came out nice a crisp) Ended with the classic chocolate chunk pizookie; i noticed that it did take quite awhile to get to our table (cannot go wrong with this dessert) Again service was great during happy hour; attentive, we didn't feel rushed. Waiter was patient and was very informative on drinks. Keep it up BJ's Esco! Will be sure to update again on my next visit."
Matthew K.,"Barksdale AFB, LA",1,9,1,2.0,9/17/2017,Came in from Florida to visit my mom in the hospital. We decided to go there after she got out. She ordered ribs with a side of green beans. Nothing is worse then watching your mom pull out a long blonde hair from her mouth with the green beans. Makes you gag and check everyone's food. We ordered a pizookie and this time I dived into the monkey bread one and sure enough another blonde hair. Definitely won't be eating here again.
S M.,"San Diego, CA",0,3,,2.0,9/17/2017,"Food is good here, though the service was extremely slow. They messed up the kid's pizza and brought pepperoni instead of cheese. The napkin which was supposed to be clean was not."
Danielle T.,"Garden Grove, CA",137,6,,1.0,9/26/2017,"I ordered to go from here and they made my pizza wrong, a bjs favorite with cheese, when I ordered it without cheese. I brought it back in and asked for them to remake it with no cheese. It was not even the same pizza !!! I got a gluten free crust with no cheese and only veggies. I waited 40 mins to get some food I don't even want. It was not the girls fault who took my order; i saw her type it in ""no cheese"". I am a server in an extremely high volume restaurant, and there's no reason to get an order wrong twice. So it's the kitchens fault for sure. Bottom line is, i have 1 pizza I can't eat with cheese and 1 that tastes gross that I don't even want. So it would be awesome if I could get a pizza I do want or a refund."
Cindy A.,"San Diego, CA",117,17,1,4.0,8/2/2017,I've been here a few times and service was always great but today we had Dwan as our server and she was exceptional! I love a server with suggestions! Food was good. Their avocado egg rolls and pizooki is a must!
Stephanie P.,"San Diego, CA",8,29,21,4.0,1/30/2017,"This past Friday we ordered for pick up and informed it would be ready by 710 pm. We arrive at 715 to pick up the food, pay and are told it would be right out. Well, 20 minutes pass and I'm still waiting for the food to come out. Not too pleased with the wait because it defeats the purpose of getting food to go and why even indicate a 710 pm pick up time if it's not even close to being ready. Because I recently had a baby who was waiting inside the car with my fiancé, (the whole reason we couldn't dine it and ordered to go) I ask to speak to a manager for an explanation as to what the delay was. To my surprise, she comped both our meals for the inconvenience of our visit/order that evening. The Customer service exceeded my expectations in resolving the issue we encountered. My fiancé and I love it here and have been to this location several times now and have never been disappointed. The food is always great, no matter what we order and management/staff has proven great customer service. We will continue being satisfied customers and would recommend this place to our family and friends."
Iesha E.,"Escondido, CA",0,4,,5.0,9/18/2017,"Went here for my sisters birthday a few days ago and some things were a little slow but the waitress Dwan was so helpful, lovely and cheerful!! After awhile everything turned out so great, the manager there Charles was such a sweetheart he really helped us out a lot and had my sister's birthday end with endless smiles and laughter. I really like this manager please keep him!! I will definitely tell ppl about this and have another visit in the near future, thanks again Charles."
Gordon V.,"San Diego, CA",0,92,106,4.0,2/15/2017,"Ate at the bar and the service was prompt and the food was good. If you like buffalo wings, try this place, they were so good I had a second order.  They have a great beer selection and their own brew.  I would suggest sampling before you buy a glass to make sure its your taste.  BJ'S brewed beer is only available at BJ's it is not sold anywhere else and you cannot get a growler of it.  I did notice another patron sipping on champagne by the glass next to me, so there are options. I am looking forward to visiting again soon!"
Tyler O.,"Valley Center, CA",69,1,,1.0,11/19/2017,"This place has overpriced alcoholic drinks and the drinks taste like there isn't a drop of alcohol in them. Food is not that great and also overpriced. Can't find one under 1,000 calories, even a salad... wouldn't recommend"
Mike S.,"Monrovia, MD",1,8,1,5.0,7/20/2017,AN C was the best server ever! Been to this place a few times and wasn't aware of the rewards. She's the only one that took the time to explain rewards and  specials to us and was quick and prompt with service. We love to come to happy hour and understand sometimes it's packed. AN is great she deserves a bonus!
Christine K.,"Escondido, CA",0,18,27,4.0,9/7/2017,Friendly staff and lively atmosphere. The food is hardy and the have a great choice of beers!
d h.,"Ramona, CA",0,18,11,1.0,11/7/2017,"Why did I return here?!?! It is overpriced, overcrowded and we had very poor service. The pizza was not good. They skimped on the toppings for a cheese and tomato pie. Mostly crust. There is nothing healthy about the menu. We won't be back."
