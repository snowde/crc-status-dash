Annie N.,"San Diego, CA",0,17,,2.0,12/22/2014,"I went here for the first time yesterday. I experienced terrible service. our waiter was sloppy. he messed our ride 3 times, and tried to avoid our table because he didn't want to deal with us. Every time we asked for something, he'd forget and some one else had to do it for us. The food takes forever, but the reason i didn't give it a one star was because of the girl up front named holly, she was very kind and helpful!  The food overall was alright, nothing special. I wouldn't go back :/"
Luis R.,"Escondido, CA",9,4,,4.0,6/18/2014,Best wings that I have eaten in my life and how consistent the food is whether its mid week or weekend it doesn't matter because the food is made by high quality chefs
Scotty W.,"Eagle Mountain, UT",186,409,107,3.0,12/10/2012,Just went for lunch. The Italian meat balls were not the best here. Did the pizza and that was great. Service was cool even on a Saturday. Weeks before Christmas. Great job.
Jasmine G.,"Murrieta, CA",59,132,95,5.0,8/10/2014,"Excellent food every time I've dined here. We had the Ranch Chicken Pizza & Peanut Butter S'mores Pizookie. The pizza was great, but I wasn't crazy about this pizookie, although I've had other Pizookie flavors that are really good. Our service was good, but I saw 2 other tables that didn't have such luck. I will definitely continue to come back."
Grace L.,"San Diego, CA",20,29,8,2.0,2/13/2012,"THE RESERVATION My friends and I had a reservation at 7 p.m. last Thursday night for 8 people.  I was the last one to arrive at 7:02, and the host handed me a buzzer for when our table was ready.  When I approached my friends, they were all confused as to why I was handed a buzzer because they were told that the table was in the process of being cleaned off and that we were going to be seated right away.  17 minutes later the buzzer went off, and we were seated.  So much for reservations! THE DRINKS They were sloooooooow with getting our drinks, and some of us just ordered water with lemon.  Well over 30 minutes after our reservation time, we finally got our waters without the lemon.  8 minutes later, our waitress brought out lemon slices for our water.   THE FOOD I ordered the fettuccine alfredo with blackened chicken, and when it got to the table, it was lukewarm.  The chicken breast was dry and overcooked, probably because it was a small thin piece of meat equivalent to 4 Chicken McNuggets at McDonalds.  The pasta did not have enough sauce, so it was lacking in flavor.  The dish was totally not worth $14+.  On top of my whack dish, I think our waitress forgot to offer us soup or salad for our entrees.  (After deciding on what I wanted to eat, I had given my menu to my friend who didn't have a menu, so I wasn't 100% sure if soup or salad came with the entrees, but I'm pretty sure it did.  Of course I didn't realize this until after we left!  Oh well...I didn't need the extra food anyways!) THE SERVICE I assign the service a double S...Slow and Sucky!  I didn't bother to complain because the manager was the one who seated us, and he didn't offer an apology...so why bother complaining about the rest of the dining experience?  He clearly didn't care and/or felt that ignoring the screw-up was best. THE COMPANY I always enjoy hanging out with my friends, so the dinner was worth it just to see all of them!  I'll give this place an extra star just because I enjoyed my friends' company. THE VERDICT I'll only be back if this is where my friends want to meet, but I will definitely bring my own bottled water and eat beforehand."
joy h.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,121,52,1.0,2/22/2012,I've been to several different locations....just not feeling it!!  Foods bready...tastes like a bunch of dough....nothing really palatable or appetizing so I think I'll donate my money to another cause.... I guess the beers ...are it....huh?  Nah maye not....
Andrew P.,"San Marcos, CA",124,448,15,3.0,7/13/2012,"We've been here quite a few times since they've opened, and I figured at first, they were new and busy... things would improve as they settled in.  Well, not really unfortunately.  The food is mediocre.  Last time I went, I got the Black and Blue burger (bacon and blue cheese).  The bacon was undercooked, the blue cheese was nonexistent, and all I could really taste was the garlic aioli... I didn't really want a garlic burger.  The wedge-cut fries were fine, but didn't taste very fresh.  I had the red velvet pizookie for dessert... best part of the meal by a lot.  The service was all right I suppose.  Everybody's food came out quickly except for my wife's.  For whatever reason, hers came out nearly 10 minutes after everybody else's... all she got was the broccoli cheese soup in a bread bowl.  How hard is that?  Hollow out bread, pour soup in bread and serve!  Strange.  Prices are reasonable for the portion sizes and food quality.   Overall, it's not terrible, but it really isn't worth the hype either.  I'll come back, but certainly wouldn't go out of my way to come here again."
Caroline P.,"San Diego, CA",165,408,111,3.0,4/21/2012,"Well sadly along with gluten I can no longer eat cheese, which severely limits my choices at BJ's.  On this trip I had the BBQ Chicken Salad which was good, nothing insanely awesome but good. The rest of the people in my party were happy with their meals as well.  Service here can be a bit slow, but they are friendly and do a good job otherwise.  I had tried their gluten free pizza before and it was pretty good! So if you are fortunate enough to still be able to have dairy...try it out!"
Brennan L.,"Santa Monica, CA",1,21,,1.0,5/3/2014,BJs has been going downhill for awhile. The pizza we received today could only be classified as fried bread with a sneeze of sauce and cheese. Pretty awful. Had to order extra sauce which was delivered cold.
Hai T.,"San Marcos, CA",19,29,19,1.0,5/24/2014,"I usually love BJ's... But this particular location in Escondido is making me NOT want to come back. ***to this location*** I came for pork chops... And last time I was here, it was bad.... But I thought it was just a fluke... And thought to give them another chance. Usually the Carlsbad location is excellent. Even the lighting in Carlsbad was better... It's dark and hard to read the menu at the escondido location.  I came back tonight to give it another try.  My pork chops came out and one piece was super tough and dry, the other piece was uncooked... And tough as well.  The waitress said she would bring a brand new plate of pork chops for me.... She brought a new plate and it was the same two pieces... Cooked longer, and tougher!!! The manager Jeremy came over, and was not apologetic or anything, and kind of brushed me off, like he didn't give a damn.. The waitress asked if I wanted a different selection. I got the scallops.  Ugh... It came out and was fishy and cold.  At this point, we've been here for 2 hours. I just wanted to eat and leave.  So I ate the fishy cold scallops and asked for the bill. Manager Jeremy didn't even come by to ask how my second meal or third meal was.  So upsetting.  The waitress and the second waiter handled this so much better.  My final note. I will not come to this BJ location... Not if the service and food is very low quality."
Christine D.,"Escondido, CA",32,138,93,4.0,2/2/2011,Deep dish pizzas are what they're known for. :) yummm. My fave is the BBQ chicken pizza. I've never really tried anything else here.
Steven R.,"North Park, San Diego, CA",56,25,13,4.0,12/31/2012,"This place is always a favorite for me. Great selection on food and drinks. The drink menu is amazing especially if your a beer drinker, I'm not so I don't benefit from it but my stepfather and mom always do. Start off with the Thai shrimp lettuce wraps they are amazing"
who k.,"Escondido, CA",148,44,2,2.0,4/8/2012,This is definitely the worst bjs I've been too...a friend and I sat in the bar on multiple occassions not even weekends and its taken at least 15 mins 2 get a beer or service for that matter...u have 2 bartenders what r u doing back there...just slow service. But great food so ill give 2 stars
Travis M.,"Escondido, CA",0,14,,5.0,6/28/2013,"One of my favorite places to eat and drink. My favorite beer being the Lightswitch, a very tasty, light beer. They offer many others as well, Id recommend giving them all a try. Food has always been awesome! Burgers are great, and pizza is super delicious! Cant forget the sugar loaded Pazookie! Instant diabetes, but totally worth the money."
Alex I.,"San Diego, CA",524,32,32,3.0,4/13/2011,I went here for my birthday and it was hella chill. The waiters and waitress come prepared with good service. They always made sure that our party was fine . Their brews and happy hour is something you cant miss out. great place for a beer and a game.
Randy P.,"San Diego, CA",205,74,844,3.0,10/25/2010,"So I usually get their Chicken Wings... and I they're not bad! They don't drench them in hot sauce like other places (not that that is a bad thing), I just like the change sometimes. The wings are juicy and flavorful.  Also try ordering their french fries. They are thin cut fries and very yummy. And  you can't go wrong with their Pazzookie! I like their Oreo or White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Pazzookie.  The location is right near the 15 freeway and across the same parking lot of North County Fair Mall... very convenient. I would come back here for sure."
Ter O.,"Hemet, CA",12,17,7,1.0,11/16/2014,"Was there for my birthday on a busy Saturday night packed house, sat in the patio and waited for a good 35 minutes until I finally walked up to a server and asked if they would take our order. Drinks brought 15 minutes after we ordered and then came appetizer and food at the same time. My refrigerated pre made salad was disgusting,  rest of the food was good. Their staff is prejudice and I really felt discriminated.  In 35 minutes that I sat in the patio with my friend, there were 5 White (anglo) waiters and I tried to get the attention of all of them and none would come to my table. I will NEVER RETURN."
Jerena B.,"North Las Vegas, NV",82,35,11,4.0,2/23/2015,"Gonna be generous and go ahead and give BJ's 4 stars. They have a large, spacious, multi sectional dining area. Great for large groups and birthdays. They have multiple flat screen TVs and a sports bar. There is a large array of beers and a great mixed drink selection for all of my fellow winos. The wait staff was friendly and not in a (I'm just trying to earn a good tip and keep my job kind of way) we received genuine smiles and friendly banter. Our waiter even took our picture when he saw our group failing miserably at attempting to take a selfie... Well a groupie lol. Reason Why I'm NOT giving a full 5 stars is because as it was packed...it was incredibly hot and stuffy. My shrimp scampi was a large portion but was not a true scampi sauce and there wasn't much sauce at all. It was a little bland. The copious amounts of parmesan cheese saved it. Took awhile to get someone to take our drink order. Lastly, the spinach /artichoke dip was horrible. Flavor -less and not spinach or artichoke.  The Pizookies were delicious and the atmosphere was nice. We had a great time and everyone around us appeared to be having a great time as well. Ordered a mixed drink...the pickled tink...was $9 and some change but it was strong and tasty unlike some of these watered down drinks you receive at other chain restaurants."
Linda H.,"Fallbrook, CA",0,4,,3.0,11/11/2014,"It's Veteren's Day!  We arrived perfect timing because earlier in the day it was extremely crowded, and by 'Happy Hour' we walked in and sat in the bar.  Love it when I was able to get 'Premium Wine' half off the glass.The server was cool. The calamari appetizer was excellent, but always ask for extra sauces never enough for the huge platter. The BJ's Pizza was excellent, but they should have served a pizza cutter with it. Had a little trouble pulling it apart with the spatula. Never had the pizookie...it was good. However we needed a couple extra plates for this ice cream desert and the waiter gave us some super hot plates. I still can't figure that one. Give me a cold beer glass, something, not a hot plate. I would go back again. I like the ambiance."
Sue S.,"San Diego, CA",8,131,,1.0,1/15/2012,"Two of us went there on January 15th, 2012 around 2:00 P.M. when it was not too busy. Got our beer - yummy - then our burgers. I strongly requested no cheese, got cheese and lip from the gal who brought the food, and I had to repeat ""no cheese please"" three times before she took it back. My friend ate, and ate and ate, while I waited.  And then I asked how much longer and she went back inside. It took longer for a re-make than the first one. She knew we were annoyed and then the manager came over - not at our request - and talked with us. I am not usually one who wants a freebie when there is an issue, but this one warranted something and we got zip, and we did not ask or get pissy when the bill came. She said she hoped we would come back....uh, no thank you. Oh, while the burgers were good, it became quite clear why Americans are at the top of the list of obesity - way too much."
