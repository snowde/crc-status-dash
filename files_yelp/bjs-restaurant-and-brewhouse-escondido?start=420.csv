Bobby K.,"Escondido, CA",25,40,5,3.0,6/29/2014,"I was contacted by a woman named Tiffany after a  2 star review that I left a couple of weeks ago. She was very apologetic and offered us a $25 gift certificate for our poor experience. I ordered a pizza today from take out and used by gift certificate to pay for it. I was informed that they made a small pizza instead of a large by mistake. Because I had to wait for them to remake my pizza, the manager have me another $25 gift certificate. I think I'm ready to bury the hatchet now."
ron j.,"San Diego, CA",2,122,5,1.0,8/22/2013,Had a mojito ....some vodka based drink ..........it tasted like kool aid.  For desert had something that looked good on the menu with fresh fruit. What i would up with was some frozen stuff heated up.  There were lots of screaming kids. One star is too much.
Diane P.,"Escondido, CA",7,80,3,2.0,2/22/2012,"Since I don't drink alcoholic beverages, I can't comment on their vast beer, ale or wine offerings. (Half the menu.) However, I've eaten there twice and found it wanting. I don't even remember what I had the first time. Last Friday: chicken lettuce cups (meh) and the ""giant stuffed baked potato"" with their chili. The potato is giant (I split it with a friend), I'll give them that. But stuffed? I was merely sliced down the middle with a schmeer of chili and some cheddar cheese melted over the top with a dollop of sour cream. There was a teeny little dish of extra chili on the side. We asked for extra chili, and got about a cup's worth; still there was a LOT of plain potato to choke down.  We sat inside, rather than outside with heat lamps and the inevitable, random wafts of cigarette smoke. Inside the lighting was so dim we could hardly read the menus and the music so loud we could barely hear one another.  I told the waitress I'm gluten intolerant, but the gluten-free, thin crust, cheese-only pizza for $9.25 (with each additional toppings $1) didn't appeal to me. (It would be nice if they just offered the GF crust as an option with all their specialty pizzas.)  The waitress offerd to bring me a ""gluten-free menu,"" but instead it turned out to be their entire food menu reprinted in very tiny font in the form of a chart, cross-referencing every common food allergen. It didn't say whether the black dot in the coordinating square meant that the menu item contained or was free of the allergen indicated. So, since I forgot to bring my magnifying-glass-flashlight, I just opted for what I thought would be safe off the regular menu. Hence the Lettuce Cups, which were sprinkled with fried won tons (gluten) and the giant non-stuffed tuber. Lettuce Cups (appetizer) + Giant Chili-""stuffed"" Potato + mini Gluten-free Pizooki = $24.  A real disappointment."
Ticha B.,"Los Angeles, CA",1102,1623,7645,4.0,8/23/2010,"I guess this is a new BJ's? The waiter was cool...he took care of us. Good experience at this locale contrary to the other low scores.  Same ole' good Bj's food, beer and restaurant. Watch out for the floors though....they were very slippery! LOL!"
Jelarzhel A.,"CA, CA",0,19,,2.0,3/30/2014,Very very very slow service. We arrived at front entrance and the lady hostess was just looking at us standing like she didnt give a s### and  didnt even say anything or shown a welcoming gestures. We had to wait another 15 minutes to be seated. Then waited another ten minutes for the waitress to provide service. Food is good but took them forever to bring it out.  We sat and waited for a long period of time. I thought it would be new years time. We ordered the food 1:10 pm  they brought it out around 145 pm. I thought it was christmas already....dont come here hungry or else youll die of starvation....
Sally L.,"San Diego, CA",333,16,7,4.0,7/25/2015,"I dine here quite frequently especially for happy hour. We always sit at a booth by the bar and the service is always so slow. The server always forgets something, especially my ranch and hot sauce that I request in the beginning. Tonight was a complete turn around. Thomas was our server and he didn't lag or forget my sauces! The food didn't take forever this timee. 4 stars because this was the 1 out of 20 times I've dined here and received good service and food delivered in a timely manner."
Nida K.,"London, United Kingdom",1943,704,2302,4.0,11/24/2011,"I come here a lot. It's easy, and convenient for my friends and I to get together here. Lately, we've been coming more often because of this really good Pumpkin beer that's seasonal during the holidays. The food isn't great here, but it's decent. I like it. Some of my friends hate it.  Lunch specials are priced right... so come here for lunch. I personally like getting the unlimited soup and salad. The CLAM CHOWDER is surprisingly good here. At least I think so. The CHICKEN TORTILLA SOUP is pretty good as well. I've also had the fish tacos, which are crunchy and delicious.  & hey, I know everybody loves the pizookie. :)"
Michele M.,"San Diego, CA",137,343,2948,4.0,7/21/2010,"4 stars for the food.  Everything I've had here is pretty darn good.  The garlic kettle chips are crispy and not greasy.  They are served with an onion dip and a buffalo dip.  Plenty for 2 people and a bargain at $2.95.  They have some great lunch specials priced from $5.95 to about $8.25.  Pizza and salad, chicken parmesan, half sandwich and soup or salad and many more choices.  Something for everyone.  The only problem with this place is it's a little on the slow side.  And when I came on a Tuesday at 1:00pm, there was a 15-20 minute wait.  A little much for lunch time.  Oh and for some reason, this BJ's is full of senior citizens.  It's kind of like going to Coco's in Rancho Bernardo at 4:00, if you know what I mean.  Anyways, BJ's has better food than Coco's and tons of beer on tap.  Maybe that's why the seniors are frequenting here."
Jeanette D.,"San Diego, CA",161,441,1743,4.0,7/13/2010,"Lunch specials like pizza and a salad for $6.95, $3 pints, and draft cream soda, root beer and orange cream soda. Need I say more? Good value, decent food, and well-functioning air conditioning (this is Escondido after all so expect it to be HOT out here). Solid option if you're in the area or heading to the Wild Animal Park or Orfila Winery."
Vivien B.,"San Diego, CA",6,26,4,2.0,12/29/2013,"Food was frozen.  Service was bad.  Called ahead and told no wait, 15min later we arrive and wait 10min for a table.  Woman on phone was very rude when I called and didn't give me a wait time to begin with.   Urine on toilet seats upon arrival.    Round about horrible."
Sasha N.,"Rancho Bernardo, San Diego, CA",13,7,,5.0,6/12/2014,Went and had dinner tonight and our server KEVIN was AMAZING! Made our dinner experience 10x better. Highly recommend to dine in his section.  I was wanting the chicken pesto flatbread which is no longer on the regular menu but he had made anyways! GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!
Judey D.,"Del Mar, CA",132,163,5,1.0,3/11/2014,So not good! The food took for-freaking-ever to bring out (and it was not crowded at all. They even messed up my friend's order TWICE! Think we won't be going back.
Natasha A.,"San Diego, CA",38,219,12,5.0,7/11/2012,"I don't think i've ever had a bad experience or bad food here. I love their incredible variety of drinks, can't resist trying a new one each time I come here. Most recently we tried the watermelon mojito (very refreshing) and the blackberry peach iced tea (non-alcoholic, free refills! though only the first glass was VERY good, the refill was really watered down which was disappointing).  I really like this lower calorie dish (under 575) they have right now...tilapia on pineapple rice? I don't recall what it's called but it's front and center on those placards they put on each table. Their watermelon feta salad is also to-die-for, great to have on a hot summer day. I love their flatbreads too, though I haven't tried all of them yet.  AND lunch specials are all under $10. Pretty good if you ask me! Also, try their pizookies. You will not be disappointed. ALL of them are good, i could never pick just one as favorite (if you order the 3 minis you can have more variety, and it's good for sharing) :D  Service has always been friendly and fast. Love this place!"
Mel S.,"San Diego, CA",107,69,23,2.0,1/12/2012,"Terrible Service, Long wait to be seated even though we were staring at a ton of open tables.  This is the worst BJ's I've been to.  Granted: it was New Year's Day...but still.   Our server was this brown haired mid 30s d-bag w a screwy looking grill and who was full of unwanted and inappropriate comedy.  He spent way too much time cracking lame jokes and not enough time thinking about his job.  I.E. I was eyeing him down, he came to tell me he would be right with me and started walking away and I had to say loudly WAIT! Um PLEASE bring us some forks.  And he made a stupid joke about how it's kind of his whole job to bring food... and give people silverware.  Ya thanks buddy. Good thing you can always count on the soda - I have been daydreaming ever since this night of the delish homemade Black Cherry Soda. YUM.  And the Seared Ahi Salad.  The dabs of wasabi sauce, slices of fresh avocado, refreshing sweet tangy cucumber salad mixed in, fresh ginger, crsipy fried wonton strips on top, enough quality seared ahi to actually fill you up for $12.95 no wonder I never get anything else on this 200 item menu. Flatbread also never fails, buffalo or margherita YUMYUM.  The hubby never fails to get the pulled pork sandwich and he never walks away disappointed or hungry.  Sauce is great, pork is tender and comes with fries!  Saved ourselves from an extra 1000 calories and did not do a pizookie this time but definitely regretted it when I was walking out the door lol   Amazeballs - Im  now a big believer in the Black Cherry Soda - this comes from a serial water consumer-non soda drinker. Bummer -  Our server SUCKED.  But will remain unnamed bc I would feel bad if he lost his job his mom/roommate would probably never forgive him."
Aiesha N.,"Temecula, CA",55,11,23,3.0,12/3/2012,"Writing this while we're here... So far, service is mediocre. They took our order quickly but brought us out the wrong food item. But before that, the server disappeared & she didn't check up on us for quite a while.  I've been coming here since they opened & it seems like all their servers are noobs. They don't want to make a connection with you & they're more concerned with getting their tip than actually providing great service. No wonder people dine & dash this location"
Melissa A.,"San Marcos, CA",23,28,8,3.0,7/21/2014,Food was okay...drinks were weak. Took us 45 minutes to get our food even though the restaurant was a ghost town. Bad waitress. Not first time...we won't be back.
Maribel G.,"Escondido, CA",0,4,,1.0,9/7/2015,"I took my family here this afternoon thinking we were going to eat great food. We ordered the Mediterranean pizza and it was burned. My father ordered a sirloin steak & it was so dry it was a struggle to cut it with the knife. We didn't receive any utensils, hence I had to ask if they had any forks!  The overall experience was underwhelming. The wings were flavorless as well."
Marty G.,"San Diego, CA",1,1,,2.0,9/7/2014,"The worst BJ's I've ever been to.  Far from what I'm used to from a BJ's. Seating hostess was clueless letting others in similar sized groups in before ours. Waitress was pleasant but EXTREMLY slow. Im sure she was new since we were her 2nd group in her area. The food itself took forever as well and came out cold, had i not been in a hurry, i would have complained about it. The kicker was the woman's restroom stalls had locks that didn't work. I should have checked yelp before pulling over to eat here. I apologize to my wife and kids for suggesting this BJ's."
Beth F.,"San Diego, CA",71,65,21,4.0,6/9/2015,We were there a couple of weeks ago and Dwanlynett the waitress was wonderful but every thing else was not up to par. I also had the feeling that Dwanlynett had many many tables and was really a trooper!  It really worried me as this is our neighborhood BJs and that the help besides Dwanlynett was so poor.  Food servers were taking the food to the wrong table and took about 15 minutes to even check in.  I think that the difference was that checkin staff and the food servers seemed more mature and capable this time around.  The last ones seemed very young and that they didn't care. An entire different experience this time.  Giuseppe was very good and  made our time enjoyable. He had made sure that the salad brought out before the pizza and the dessert also came in a timely manner. Thank you  Giuseppe !
San Diego rocks A.,"San Diego, CA",2,152,13,1.0,7/28/2011,"Worst experience ever had...We were there last night for a dinner. The waiter came few seconds immediately after we sat. So we asked for 2 mins to look over the menu. And then he never came back for 10 mins. And then we gave our order. 30 mins past, no one came. Finally the waiter came and said the computer crashed and the chef lost the order so he is going to give the order again. 15 mins past. Some other waiter came back with our order. We ordered for a Pizza. So I asked that guy to bring us some plates. 10 mins past, he never came. Our waiter came again, I was so upset so I asked him to get us plates as the Pizza is getting cold. He brought us the plates. We started eating our cold pizza. Until this point, no apologies at all. Finally, it got too late so I insisted to bring us check. He said ""I know you guys just want to get out of here after all this experience, me too"". I know he is trying to lighten up but they never compensated on anything at all...I thought they will give us a discounted check or at least a sincere apology. We really hated to even leave a 15% tip but we did anyways."
