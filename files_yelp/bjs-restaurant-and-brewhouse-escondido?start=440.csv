Carl K.,"Escondido, CA",20,19,,3.0,7/11/2014,They are located in a great location.  They also have a pretty good happy hour.  My wife and I like the Margarita Flat Bread Pizza.  I would give a higher rating but the service is lacking especially if they are a little busy!!  Try their house Microbrews...you will like it!!
James L.,"San Diego, CA",1,34,18,4.0,4/5/2013,"The pizza is great fresh and if you have a toaster oven, save a few slices for later.  It comes out of the toaster oven with a fresh out of the oven texture and flavor.  You can keep the slices in the fridge for almost a week and still have piping hot fresh tasting fancy pizza! It's deep dish.  If you're a hater because you like it thin, don't hold it against this place.  Really... one slice is a meal.  Pizookie is always a good idea but the fancier flavors aren't as good as old school.  Don't be shy about asking for some more hot fudge. The beer is ... meh.... gone through the sampler flight so many times and it doesn't float this beer lover's boat.  But just wash it down with another slice of pizza.  Rinse & repeat."
Cassidy C.,"San Diego, CA",55,35,,5.0,5/26/2014,"Ate dinner, lunch and hung out at the bar here. Great food selection and wonderful drinks. Loved the blonde kolshe and the peach margarita. Great service!"
Kel'ly B.,"Escondido, CA",14,14,,5.0,6/26/2014,"Pizza, beer & more!! This is my go to place when I cannot decide on what or where I want to eat.  Deep dish pizza is fantastic, my favorite is ""the great white"" alfredo sauce, grilled chicken, tomatoes...whats not to love. My hubby loves their brew house blonde beer and I enjoy a nice freshing cocktail (havent found one I dont like yet). Their avocado eggrolls are amazing...flakey warm wonton wrappers, that hug a great melody of flavors from chipotle, corn, avocado & several other flavors. Definitely recommend joining theircard club, earn points for coupons food and vip privileges. Go check them out..."
Rayna J.,"Escondido, San Diego, CA",166,198,32,3.0,2/24/2014,"Like any BJ's brewhouse, they have tons of options for food and tons of drinks. Similar to cheesecake factory menu with so many options it takes you at least 30 minutes to decide. Hey, I'm all about variety but hell this is overwhelming. I've tried quite a few items off the menu. From the pizza, Parmesan crusted chicken, ahi poke, mozzarella tomato small side, almost all the salads and everything is pretty fantastic. Haven't had a bad dish yet. Drinks are great, nice variety and plenty of beer on tap. However, the service at Escondido is just meh. They seem to switch over servers every 10 minutes so you never know who to go to. Pretty annoying and food seems to take forever."
Madison W.,"Escondido, CA",0,1,,5.0,6/23/2015,"We love this restaurant and always have the best service. Especially tonight, my mom loves grey hound drinks (vodka and grapefruit juice) but the last few times we came they didn't have the juice. My dad let the manager know just for future reference, and the manager, Ron, took the initiative and called next door to another restaurant to get some juice. It was really above and beyond."
Erlinda C.,"Vista, CA",0,25,,1.0,6/21/2015,"It's our first time to eat here. Service is not good. Two of our order was cold, which is the Hamburger & fries then the Jambalaya is also cold! The skinny margarita that I order is horrible! We'll never eat here again!"
Dawn B.,"San Diego, CA",5,1,,1.0,6/15/2013,I've tried to give this BJ's location a chance. Tried it 3 times over the past 6 months and the service has been incredibly slow each time. Food takes forever to come out. Our visit today resulted in an incorrect bill that we had to get fixed. The manager did come over to apologize but the damage has been done. I will not be returning to this location.
Will H.,"Ramona, CA",43,80,,5.0,1/27/2015,Love this place. Were here like once a month. We always get great service. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Beer selection is great. Always a good time here. Pizza and wings are my favorite. Bj beers are good and they have others on tap. Can't wait to come back!
Renee J.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,157,,1.0,12/21/2013,"BJs for happy hour is really scrimping. Seriously. No sauce on the mini deep dish pizza, plus obviously premade and just kept warm...cheese wasn't even close to melted. Not really deep dish either, more like canned biscuit dough. Artichoke dip was crazy small, way smaller than it used to be. Yay, just paid $5 for about 15 tortilla chips. The absolute worst was the chicken nuggets, I mean chicken tenders. So gross! Only 4 of them, and honestly I think they are from McDonalds, but for way more cash. Not going here anymore unless it's only for a beer.  Place also very understaffed with only two people behind the bar serving the bar customers as well as tables."
Kate G.,"Davenport, FL",111,305,123,1.0,5/14/2011,"1-star.  Let me explain why: Food: The food was probably some of the worst food I've ever eaten.  They have a large menu and none of it is good.  I had the flatbread pizza thinking that it was something that is hard to mess up, and it was just terrible.  I had a hard time eating any of it. We also ordered a brownie with dark chocolate ice cream.. it was terrible.  The brownie didn't taste good and the ice cream made me gag. Service: The service here was not good.  We were there for around 2 hours and had to wait a very long time to ask for refills and to get our meals in general.  It was incredibly annoying.  The waitress wasn't that friendly, either.  Our table was just another thing on her ""to-do"" list for the day.  She didn't treat us like you'd expect a good waitress to.  We were just an inconvenience for her. Atmosphere: The atmosphere is alright.  It's really just a bar with some tables.  It's a newer building, so it has that going for it.. and it's fairly clean.  I mean, it has to meet health codes, right?  But other than that, it was just really bland and nothing special at all. Price: Rather expensive for what it is.  I mean.. really?  The food was just terrible. Overall experience: I'm never going here again.  That is all."
A S.,"San Diego, CA",0,11,,3.0,8/2/2015,"I've been to BJ's a few times now and each time the food is tasty.  They have a huge selection of different dishes so you're sure to find something you'll like.  Besides the good food, the service at BJ's has always been good too.  The only reason BJ's get 3 stars instead of 4 is because it's just so loud.  First of all, BJ's is a popular place, especially with families so you get a lot of kid noise to go along with the crowds.  BJ's can't really help that but they also play the restaurant music very loud.  Maybe that's the atmosphere they're going for (loud music, party place) but that's not my thing when I'm just trying to get some dinner."
Andy M.,"Fort Collins, CO",1,5,2,2.0,7/30/2014,Poor service long wait pizzas took 30 minutes and deserts came at different times  I would give it 1 star if the other ones I've been too weren't so good
Gleeba P.,"Palatine, IL",0,23,1,5.0,4/4/2015,Great service! The bartenders give great service! I love how there are purse hooks under the bar table. Great deals on wine as well as the great beer!
Griselda P.,"Riverside, CA",0,3,23,2.0,4/30/2014,Service was horrible food was ok went in with my family. server was not friendly at all!!!
Jason K.,"San Diego, CA",0,47,,2.0,8/20/2013,"I want to like this particular BJ's since it's near my house but we won't go back.  At one point while on a project my team of 15-20 people went to the one in Ontario CA near 4th street 5 times a week for months and had the greatest service.  I've been to this one 5 times or so and my wife and I are consistently disappointed.  Orders come incorrectly (wrong fries, wrong sauce, stuff asked for on the side not on the side, pink ""well done"" ordered burger, having to get up to go ask for more drinks, etc.).  It's a shame as I like the beers and other BJ's I've been to, but this one needs some management top down customer service training.  Having to go ask for a refill every time when 5+ wait staff are standing around less than 10 feet away is just sad."
Paula D.,"Rancho Penasquitos, San Diego, CA",258,421,58,1.0,4/19/2011,"This is a rare one star review from me.  Over the last few months we kept trying to go here and the wait was always incredibly long,. Last weekend we came in early and called in 30 minutes prior to arrival. They don't  take reservations.. We came in and waited around 15 minutes after the call in. That was reasonable. Sadly that was the best part of the evening. We sat outside and it was a warm night so we were surprised that so many others were waiting with many open tables in the patio.   This should have been a warning to our group. of 5 people.  We were seated and the hostess provided menus.  After a longish time we had the waitress take our order.  Then...we entered the twilight zone.  The appetizers took at least 30 minutes to arrive and the waitress plopped them down without plates, napkins or cutlery.   She was absent until we asked for the plates, cutlery and napkins from another server. The main dishes arrived really late and lukewarm.  My plate included dried out carrots that looked really old and tired.  Eyeeew.   It took so long that my normally shy daughter said, OMG, when are we getting our food?  At this point I am wondering why there is always a line at this place.   The patio had several empty tables and there were still people waiting outside.   Maybe they knew that that patio was not the place to be if you wanted good service.  It was like the Bermuda triangle of dining. The long lost waitress arrived after we had eaten the main dishes and sadly we ordered dessert.  Mostly because the teens wanted the Pizzokie.   That was tasty but we had to wonder in what state was this dish prepared.   California was right out because it took so long to arrive that it had to have been imported from some place far away. So hear the Pizzokie arrives we have dishes all over our table, no one has cleared the courses prior and I realized that the only way to make room was for me to do this by moving the appetizer and dinner dishes to another table.   The final insult was when we ordered a beverage that never arrived and yet it appeared on the bill.   It was removed but only after I gave the bill a close look and looked concerned. Mediocre food.  Bad service.  Why are people waiting in line for this place?"
Greg D.,"San Diego, CA",33,29,45,2.0,6/18/2011,"Like an overpriced TGI Fridays.  Dark interior and mediocre food for over $12/ entree.  You pay the price, you want it nice.   That pizookie is the bomb though, I got nothing on that.  Quite possibly one of the best creations that man has ever come across."
D G.,"San Diego, CA",28,55,11,5.0,7/17/2015,"I have been here at least a half dozen times. Great food & drink. Friendly service. Clean. We didn't always have places like this ""back in the day"" here. Many people take a place like this for granted. No complaints."
Boo S.,"Del Mar, CA",32,33,58,5.0,5/5/2012,"Deep dish pizza ......ohhh sooo delcious! May even top Pizza Ports pizza....did I just say that!.????!! YUP! Happy hour prices are fantastic! I got their mac and cheese as well and it was pretty great.  Back to the pizza, baked to perfection, crunchy, good amount of cheese, meat, and to melt in your mouth! PIZOOKIEEEE!! I got the White Chocolate chip and Macadamia nut with vanilla bean ice cream...could not resist get the fudge chocolate one too!! To die for!! Definitely to indulge.  Now that is a taste of decadence!!"
