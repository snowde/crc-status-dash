Khanh L.,"San Diego, CA",2,22,2,4.0,3/26/2014,"I have always had a good experience here. The service can be slow but the food is good and the beer is good as well. They have a great all day happy hour on Thurs $3.50 all BJ draft beer. I recommend the jambalaya and deep dish pizza. They can be pricey, but the lunch specials are decent price. Save room for dessert as well because they invented the pizookies and I recommend the red velvet."
Brenda H.,"Escondido, CA",16,11,,4.0,5/27/2014,"This was my second time here and I loved it. The first time it was crowded people waiting outside I did not like it. The second time we went there was a wait, the hostess said 15- 20 minutes and we were seated in 5. The food was delicious and drinks were as well. They do have a reward program going on and when we signed up we got a free pizookie. We were full so we didn't get it, but you can save it for next time. Good food the only thing was the lighting it was a bit too dark in there."
Danelle P.,"San Diego, CA",0,13,1,1.0,11/10/2015,"Ok, here's the thing.  I ALWAYS write reviews, good or bad.  I believe that we need to know about both, so I will comment on what is awesome and what is not.  Not lately on Yelp, but this needed to be said.  BJ's has, in the past, had the BEST happy hour around my area.  My husband and I love Tito's vodka and will spend lavishly when in an establishment, including tipping the server, as long as they bring the cocktails as we eat.  $4 drinks, plus appetizers and entree's.  We frequented this restaurant at least 2x a week, as both of us have high stressful jobs and this allowed us to relax and enjoy our night without being gauged for funds.  A few weeks ago, on a Monday, we  again met up after work and had a lovely meal and cocktails with the servers getting to know us.  We had the place laughing,  Then we met up again, as my husband loves your Rib Eye and after getting the bill, find our drinks have doubled during happy hour.  We question the server, who informs us that she ""should have told us the happy hour menu had changed.""  Ok, our drinks went from $4 to $7.75. WTF BJ's.  As we left, I noticed the bar was half empty, for the first time.  Standing room only before.  Because of your greed, we will never step foot in your establishment and you lost people.  If you felt you were losing money, make your happy hour from 4 or 5 to 7, not 3 to 7.  But to gauge your patrons.  SHAME.ON.YOU.  Aren't you making enough money to allow people to come in for a few hours and enjoy their evenings?  Whoever told you to change your happy hour policy needs to be talked to.  I am just shaking my head as I write this.  You need to make it right."
Barry M.,"Oceanside, CA",10,75,93,1.0,12/10/2013,Made a mistake again and went to BJ's. My Fiends and I. All six of us. Everything we ordered was either late or wrong. I hope to never return even if I am desperate.
Tom M.,"Sioux Falls, SD",45,70,2,4.0,3/18/2012,"Busy place, but surprisingly not loud.  Service was a little slow, but considering how busy it was, it was good. The chicken won-ton appetizer was really good.  The calzone was nice and soft, but a little heavy on the riccota and a bit light on the mozzarella.  Large beer selection for those that partake.   a good portion of the menu is available in gluten free, which was why we went to BJ's in the first place."
Nish B.,"Anaheim, CA",16,75,5,1.0,6/6/2013,"Service was slow and staff was rude, seemed to be in a rush and didn't want to listen to what we actually wanted. Hate being rushed at a restuarant."
Karma L.,"Oxnard, CA",5,30,20,1.0,4/12/2011,"This has happened on 2 separate occasions; once on a Weds night & a month later on a Thurs night: - 12 min. after we are sat drink order & appetizer taken  - 15 min. later drink order arrives & dinner order taken, cold glass for beer forgotten. - 55 min. later dinner arrives except for 1 mini pizza & appetizer. - 12 min. later (1 hr total!!) mini pizza arrives w/ app! - No check backs on drink refills or another round of beers. I've been to quite a few different BJ's up & down Cali & this was THE worst service (both times) AND NO COMPS!  I thought the 1st time I came to this location that the service was slow because we had a large party (14) & it was fairly busy.  The 2nd time...4 people, service was no better.  Each time the server(s) apologized & blamed it on the kitchen (umm...do they also handle the drinks?)!"
Kristine L.,"San Diego, CA",43,46,3,2.0,8/8/2011,"My hubby, sis in law and our friend Mark came here after a long drive from San Francisco. My sis in law wanted pizza so we came here. Located in North County Fair Mall. The restaurant is huge an there are a lot of seating. Nice bar area and the restaurant is very clean because it was new.  Pros  love their Pizookie's  Service is fast and friendly good for large groups good selection of beer and wine Cons Pizza is just okay nothing special.  house salad sucked! Just an okay place. Nothing too special for me,...."
Karen H.,"Escondido, CA",1,26,,2.0,5/9/2011,"We made a reservation for 12 two days early. They called to confirm, so we thought everything would be fine (despite many negative reviews from big groups on Yelp). yet when we got there they put us at a table for 10 and just crowded in more chairs. Service was slow, and everyone got their food except for me (the birthday gal). I got my pizza about 20 mins after everyone else. The manager offered to comp it, but when the bill came, there it was! I wouldn't go back with a big group. Food was pretty good and drinks were tasty, but all the other hassles distracted from our celebration."
Kristin W.,"San Marcos, CA",62,30,74,3.0,1/28/2014,"Great Pizza, apps and a really delicious wedge salad...and I know my wedge salads!"
Ron A.,"Whittier, CA",105,711,214,5.0,8/3/2011,This is the BJ's location I typically would go to. I had a birthday party of my own and went to a lot of birthday parties at this location. The food is good except for the pasta dishes. All BJ locations that I have been to do not have good pasta. Everything else on the menu is good. There is a full bar.  The service is good. They have televisions on every wall. Good place to go watch a sports game while eating with your friends and family. It can be noisy especially during a sports game. I recommend you save some room for a pizookie.
Robert H.,"Denver, CO",164,634,1935,4.0,4/14/2011,"Ever since my trip to Chicago I have yearned to find a local pizza place that can deliver the same quality on some level. Trip after trip I am disappointing with cardboard tasting greasy pizza. And then there was BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse, who came to rescue me from this sad world of pizza. - Quality Ingredients - Happy Servers - Fast Service - Expansive Menu I have to admit the main reason BJ's sticks in my mind is the pizookie, BUT the pizza is fabulous as well. This visit, my wife and I did a brunch mashup where I ordered breakfast and she ordered lunch. This worked well enough because we usually share our plates. Our server was a little pushy, wanting us to order right away and asking insistently if we were ready right after we sat down and again two minutes later. Within 5 minutes she asked 5 times and it was a bit annoying. I just stopped answering her and let my wife do the talking until I had decided. I don't know about you, but  when I am done looking at the menu it's usually a good sign I have decided. Apparently they don't teach that in waitress school. My wife started with a fresh, creamy, vinegar salad to open up her pallet and moved right into the Crispy Fried Artichokes ($3.25) we ordered. These lightly breaded artichoke hearts were fried crisp and sprinkled with Parmesan cheese. They were delicious by themselves but the lemon garlic aioli dip they give you really adds an explosion of flavor. My wife ordered the Mediterranean Deep Dish Pizza ($10.95) that was fresh, delicious and fluffy dough. You just can't go wrong with the grilled chicken, basil pesto, roasted garlic, Kalamata olives, sun-dried tomatoes, feta cheese and sliced peperoncinis. It'll have you in a deep trance of digestion, forgetting about anyone else you are sitting with *tunnel vision*. I ordered the Classic Breakfast Sandwich ($6.95) that was noticeably inexpensive but very filling and flavorful. It TKO'd Denny's, that's for sure. This magical sandwich is a remixed ""moons over myhammy"" and comes with two scrambled eggs topped with cheddar cheese and your choice of Applewood smoked bacon, grilled ham or country sausage links on grilled sourdough bread. Served with seasoned country potatoes. *drool*"
Chuck G.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,14,,3.0,3/18/2014,"When I go to BJs bar, I'm there to enjoy the alcoholic drinks, adult comradery, and watch some sports on the big screen. When the heck did management decide to allow children in the bar area??? Don't get me wrong, I love kids. I've raised a couple of my own. But a bar is NO PLACE FOR CHILDREN!!!  And this statement goes for both sides of the argument. On the adult side, we adults need to get away and be with adults and discuss, joke, and make adult comments that children should not be around to listen or see. On the children's side, they shouldn't be exposed to this kind of adult behavior and reinforcing drinking at an early age. They don't need this. There's already an under age drinking epidemic. Now that this is off my chest, I can comment on the food... It's good and happy hour specials make it better.  'Nuff said!"
Kim L.,"Silverdale, WA",51,14,12,3.0,1/14/2015,"Unlike the other reviews I've seen about this particular BJ's our service was quick and we also were immediately seated. We ordered the avocado eggrolls and the artichoke with dip. for me the avocado eggrolls were too spicy but for my husband who likes spice said they were fine spice wise but not very flavorful. The fried artichoke were just ok taste wise but pretty greasy. For entree I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken which turned out to just be ok, it wasn't bad but it wasn't really good either. Hubbs ordered the deep dish bacon ranch pizza which was pretty good. ( I stole a bite) For drink I had the strawberry lemonade which was really yummy, so good In fact I had about 4 refills during our dinner. At the end the waiter even asked if I wanted a to go lemonade which of course I happily said yes to. We got a gift card for Christmas for BJ's so thankfully the meal was free but I definitely won't be returning."
Mike M.,"Cardiff, CA",0,7,,1.0,1/16/2011,"I don't know why i keep coming back.  It must be the food and the atmoshphere, because is certainly is not the service.   This is not a one time experience.  I have been here for dinners in the dining room and just appetizers in the bar area so I have given this place their fair chance.   Seated ourselves in the bar area in a booth (first come first served), had to ask the hostess for menus, then 15 minutes later if there was a server who could take our order.  (had to track the server down for silverware after our food arrived) - strike one. During a different visit, came in with a party of 25, service was so slooooooooow.  From getting our drinks to the servers (2) taking our orders, it must have taking at leat 2.5 hours.  From the time the first lunch item was served, until the last person recieved their lunch item, must have been about 30 minutes (some people had finished their meals before the last entree arrived.  - strike two On our most recent visit, we sat in the bar and ordered a pizookie for dessert.  We waited what we thought was a long time, at least 15 minutes, maybe 20, no big deal (we love the pizookie, so no problem waiting here).  The next thing we see is what we thought was our server walking out the front door with her apron off, she must have been going home.  What the????  Finally another server approached us and asked us if we needed anything else.  When we inquired about our dessert, she was clearly embarrased because our previous server (servers rotate all the time here), never entered it into the kitchen.  - strike three Your out.  I am taking Bj's off of my list of go to places.  Just to many mistakes too many times.   By the way where are the managers??????  Yes, I see them.  They are walking around, talking with servers, doing stuff with the computer.  They are easy to recognize.  I know who they are, but never once have they ever approached my table and asked me how everything was.  I mean what the heck.  We have had food taking off  our bill on different occasions and never has a manager visited our table.   If you ask me, it's not a service issue, it's a management issue.  Bye Bye Bj's, it's been great while it lasted.  I've been dining here for the past, gosh, I don't know, maybe 10 years, ever since I lived in SD and the La Jolla restaurant opened.  I feel like I'm saying goodbye to an old friend.  I sure will miss you.  Try to keep your eye on the ball (guests). Don't let the numbers cloud your vision."
Dina W.,"Ramona, CA",36,61,,2.0,4/4/2013,"We've eaten at BJ's in Temecula several times and had great service and delicious food.  What a disappointment in Escondido.   I will say our server was great, cheerful and thorough.   My cheeseburger was over cooked and cold.  Fries were just cold although I complained and promptly got a hot fresh serving.  Hubby had the Chicken Fried Steak which was tough. Baked potato and veggies were cold.  Mom had the Club Flatbread appetizer which she thoroughly enjoyed.  Sister had the grill shrimp tacos that she said were really spicy but good.   And what's with the side servings of thousand island dressing and gravy? Tiny little servings that ended up making you feel like a pig when you had to keep ordering more. Won't be returning anytime soon if at all."
Jesse J.,"Menifee, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/5/2015,"Just left this restaurant with my family and it was by far the worst dining experience we have ever had. We have been to several different locations and have never had such bad food!! We ordered our usual favorite the avocado egg rolls and they came out completely smashed and unappitizing. We sent them back and asked for a new batch. The second batch came out just as bad!! We then just asked for them to take them back and off our check. Next came the pizza...we ordered a vegetarian deep dish and it was totally burnt! Again we sent it back and asked for a new pizza. In the meantime, they offered us some clam chowder which was over cooked and ineatable. THEN the manager brought out our new pizza and actually said ""I am so sorry it looks like they forgot the tomatoes. Would you like them on the side?"" We were completely baffled and did not even eat our food. The worst $80 dollars ever spent"
Breanne T.,"San Diego, CA",47,33,438,3.0,7/17/2011,"This place has a nice ambience. They have a pretty big menu. I've been here 3 or 4 times. Their baked potatoes are HUMONGOUS! The Pizookie is a MUST. The draft sodas aren't that great, I'd rather have a Pepsi. Their Brewhouse Blonde is pretty decent. They're apparently known for their pizzas so I finally tried a Bacon Cheeseburger deep dish... it really did taste like a cheeseburger. It wasn't nasty but I wouldn't order it again. Their service is pretty sweet; we ordered the pizza without onions and they accidentally kept 'em in so they let us take that to-go and made us a new pizza with no charge!"
Ericka M.,"Poway, CA",78,45,24,5.0,12/10/2013,"I love BJ's. The service, food and drinks are always delicious. First time I went to this location was in 2010. I loved it then and  I love it now. Great memories! Had my last 2 birthdays here!  I would definitiely recommend this place."
Melanie K.,"San Diego, CA",0,3,,4.0,12/18/2012,"We live close, so have had a few 'dinners out' at BJ's in Westfield Mall, Escondido. After a few bad experiences, my hubby decided to call the manager and discuss with her the personnel that had contributed to our unpleasantness at the restaurant. Not only did she (Shawn) take the call and empathize with our needs, I could tell that she took the advice to heart with her staff, and the next couple times we went there it was a great experience! Now when we go, the staff is pleasant, the service is quick (BUT DO expect to wait for a table - don't go here very hungry)... A great example of a business taking its customers' input to heart and making appropriate changes - and my opinion changed from maybe 2 stars to 4."
