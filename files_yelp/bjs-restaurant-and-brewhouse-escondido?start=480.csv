Jay A.,"San Diego, CA",2,2,,1.0,10/30/2014,"Worst pizza ever. I ordered a medium pizza which came with 2inches of crust and hardly any cheese. If you want pizza, look elsewhere."
Eric v.,"Escondido, CA",34,78,,2.0,6/29/2013,"Foods not that great. It's a little below mediocre I would say. The beer is decent for the most part. The service can be kinda iffy. If you don't have any better options sure go with it I guess, but don't expect much. The pizookies are good though."
Kristine Y.,"San Diego, CA",1,9,,1.0,2/8/2011,"Horrendous service, cold food & very unprofessional Management!   If I could give it a zero or negative, I would.  We waited 20 mins for a server to find us, after I hunted one down, yet they were not busy at all.  In total, it took almost 3 hours to have a simple lunch, with a child I might add, because our food kept coming out wrong and cold. The first trip to the table, per our request, the Manager even said ""I wouldn't eat that if I were you"" and yet she didn't even offer to buy us a round of drinks while half the table ate their food and the others sat and waited another 30 mins for their food, only for it to come out wrong again!     I guess the Manager did not understand the concept  that if you make customers wait that long and continuousluy screw up their order, you might want to comp their food and perhaps, at the very least, apologize but she NEVER did. Instead she argued with us and finally agreed to comp one meal and give us some free vouchers for next time (yeah right), but then, surprise, surprise, we received our bill 2 minutes later and she didn't take a penny off and their were no vouchers.  Ridiculous! So we confronted her for the third time, and she finally agreed to comp the check but started crying, grabed it out of my hand and then ran off.  Wow!  And she is a Manager?   I WILL NEVER GO BACK!"
Steph K.,"Escondido, CA",29,18,1,1.0,8/17/2014,"I have come to this BJs location twice since my last review and my opinion definitely hasn't changed. We came on a Saturday for my son's birthday (he requested this restaurant, otherwise we wouldn't have come). I called right when they opened and asked if I could get a reservation, they said no, that they don't do reservations but I could put my name down on their call ahead list to be bumped 5 minutes ahead of the wait list.... whatever that means. I put my name on the list even though it didn't sound like it would help any. The lady on the phone told me to come 20 minutes ahead of time to ensure getting a table at 1:00. What do you know, we show up at 12:40 and are told it will be a 40 minute wait. Awesome! My family with small children were forced to wait by the front door in the heat for a table. I asked the hostess again about reservations, since I thought it was ridiculous that they don't do them, and she said they do do reservations but you have to make them a day in advance or call early in the morning. I called them right when they opened! If they couldn't accommodate our large group, they should have said so. Providing subpar service throughout our meal didn't help the experience either (wrong drink orders, drinks sitting empty throughout meal, forgotten dessert order). I won't be back."
Veronica D.,"Oceanside, CA",75,93,159,4.0,10/21/2013,"BJ's menu is pretty amazing. There is plenty to pick from but we usually go for the pizza. They really make a great everything pizza, all the toppings are fresh and the pizza is nice and hot. Sit in the bar for faster service and a view of the beers on tap. They have a great selection of beer as well as cocktails since they are a full bar. The atmosphere is busy, yet warm, they keep it a bit dark inside. The hours are great, they are open very late, so if you can't decide where to go late night keep this place in mind. I have to recommend the pazzookie. It's a fresh baked cookie topped with ice cream. However you can order it as large as a pizza!! Hopefully to share, but I won't judge if you don't. You can order small sizes if you want to be conservative. I will say they make them better at the Carlsbad location than Escondido. It's worth the drive!"
Diane M.,"Murrieta, CA",0,14,1,2.0,1/28/2013,"I have been to many other BJ's but this place really ruined my feel about the restaurant. It started with the server, I don't care if you are a new derver or extremely busy, you should never be waiting for WATER for 20 minutes. The server didn't even have a explenation. After waiting close to 40 minutes to order our food it came out wrong. The fish and chips was only batter without fish. The new hand tossed pizza was also bad. The only thing that saved the night was the manager comping the fish and chips and a sincere apology, luckily my husband loves their IPA or we would of stormed out of there. If your looking for quality service and food it's better to go to yard house!"
J D.,"Anaheim Hills, CA",4957,1982,28926,4.0,12/7/2010,"Met a friend here for late night drinks over the weekend.  Had a Stone IPA and great conversation.  The bartender made sure we were taken care of.  Too bad the night was cut short.....I hate last call....that's when I realize I'm not in Vegas when I'm on a road trip. Will I return?  If I'm in the area, sure."
Avalon C.,"Las Vegas, NV",284,28,29,4.0,10/24/2011,"This spot is big and has a open feel... We order the new menu which is the tilapia oreale which I think good and the mini sliders and to top that we order some four of a kind platters combo (forgot the named of it) food is good but not over the top good... After all this big meal, I think it's a must that you order what they are known for, PAZOKIE and you can order a mini size if you don't have enough space on ur junk :)"
Fran J.,"Rancho Santa Fe, CA",0,4,,1.0,5/5/2014,"The food was not good. The pizza was gressy and the crust was soggy.  Would not go to BJ's again! Went to BJ's for a late lunch to check it out for a birthday party for my sons. The place wasn't busy at 2:30 pm. Asked the hostess about the party and gave all the info. She said no problem but for 15 people I would have to ask the manager. She was gone for a while then came back to tell us that her manager was too busy to talk to us. We were ther having lunch for 1 1/2 hour. She never came over.  The hostess said it wouldn't be a problem and we even talked about where they would put us. I called in the next few days and the hostess said no problem she would ask the manager. Then i was told the manager was too busy to talk to me but she said they couldn't do the party. The excuse was they might be booked or maybe there is a graduation or something that day. They didn't really know why the manager said no. Then I called corporate headquarters and got customer service. They took down my complaint and said they would call and fing out what was going in. Guess what? When they called back 10 minutes later the said the mamgers were all in a meeting and too busy to talk with her. She would call me back. That was 3 days ago and noone has called back.  I guess they are all too busy in meetings to take care of the customers, work on the slow bad service or improve the quality of the food."
Derrick W.,"San Diego, CA",35,60,4,4.0,3/17/2015,Had the extreme pepperoni flat bread.  That was the greatest thing I have had in a while.  Can't forget the peach margaritas which were A+++.  Service was kind of slow due to it being crowded but definitely would do it again.
Rigo C.,"Escondido, CA",239,211,203,3.0,8/27/2011,"Service is mediocre, it sucks ass quite honestly, but I keep coming back for that BBQ pulled pork sandwich and those potato wedges. Oh yeah and that heavenly-in-your-mouth deep dish pizza."
Stephen H.,"San Diego, CA",14,10,,1.0,3/11/2014,"good - bj's is a chain, and the food is consistently a 4/5 at all their locations.  also, unlimited soup and salad for lunch is nice. bad - this location is notable for it's repeatedly bad service.  incidents so far: 1) wife asked for a snakebite done a certain way - waitress came back with it totally wrong.  her excuse?  ""the bartender just made it that way"" - no apology, no attempt to fix it 2) called to ask when the lunch ended - was told 4 pm on the phone.  arrived at  3:15 to get an item that was only on the lunch menu.  was told ""sorry, lunch ended at 3"" waitress gave us attitude, acted like we should have known when lunch ended and it was my fault the person i called told me the wrong time 3) went to the bar early to get a table for my wife and I for happy hour, the entire bar was full, literally, no seats.  asked the hostess whether we had to sit at the bar to get happy hour - she get's a ditzy look and says ""i think so"" - so, maybe?  asked if there way any way I could wait on a list without having to hover and grab someone else's seat - ""no, sorry"".  So i told her we were going to On The Border instead - she was all smiles like she'd just won a cheerleading contest. ok, in BJ's defense, the one time we talked to an actual manager (when our order was 20 minutes late because they ran out of one of the ingredients) we got a refund for the order.  still, we had to repeatedly ask the waitress to check on that order - as she didn't tell us what was going on. I think the problem with that location is the ditzy morons they hired as hostesses and waitresses don't care if the place makes money, builds customer loyalty, or even stays in business.  daddy's paying all their bills, right? it's too bad, because their food is really good - but the service is so bad it's rarely worth the headache."
Rich M.,"Beaumont, CA",0,39,,1.0,2/2/2014,"There were three of us having dinner.  Fish and chips were all batter, over cooked and very little fish for $12.95...lousey and over priced. Mini pizza was served luke warm.  Waiter brought another one...it was luke warm.  We assumed the pizza dough was made up in advance and then the veggies added.  It was supposed to be a deep dish...it was a thick cold dough with some veggies on the top, no sauce.   Won't go back."
Randolph O.,"Escondido, San Diego, CA",0,36,17,4.0,1/2/2014,Very good service.  Lunch and early evening is better for us as it is less crowded than prime dinner hours.  Amazingly varied menu.  Our favorite is the turkey burger - a real treat!  You can't lose at BJ's.
Elizabeth S.,"Poway, CA",1,28,2,1.0,12/29/2013,"The service here is consistently horrible! Not sure why we keep coming, honestly. I've eaten at another BJ's in Arcadia (Los Angeles area) for years and the service is FAR better. Food is decent when served altogether, in a timely manner and is hot. We haven't been so fortunate at this location."
Brinda J.,"San Diego, CA",433,1068,111,3.0,8/15/2011,"Good food, yummy drinks, good service. What else do you want? This hits the spot for a night out to enjoy with friends."
Dale J.,"Escondido, CA",2,24,1,2.0,1/24/2015,"My wife and I have gone to this BJ's a few times. I always like to be positive so I will say the food has been constantly good. The service, not so much."
J B.,"Melbourne, Australia",12,24,,3.0,11/6/2011,"I like the fact that this is a bigger location, it's very nice inside. I am not a huge fan of deep dish pizza yet theirs is pretty legit.  When they bring it out it looks super small but man that stuff expands.  I've had a couple of their pizza's and they all were pretty good.  The last one we tried was the great white (I think that was the name..) It was definitely a different spin on pizza and was very flavorful. I've had the Sante Fe egg roll appetizer which isn't too bad, it definitely has a lot in the appetizer. I was disappointed when they brought out the french fries because they were pretty cold. If you get dessert there you have to get the pizookie!  It is do die for! The other day when I went I got the brownie and it came with a monstrosity of ice cream and whipped cream on top.  When I got to the brownie it was so damn sweet I could only eat 2 bites.  I wouldn't recommend the brownie unless you're down to go into sugar shock. I haven't tried to many of their beers so I wouldn't really know how to rate them.  When I went here on a date though, the guy ordered us the Hef brew.... I'm not a hef type of gal...a bit too sweet for me..but it had a nice flavor I suppose. Overall I will probably go here again, but I doubt it will be a first choice."
Realtor Karl B.,"San Diego, CA",59,1973,16,4.0,4/23/2011,"Love the deep dish here... Try the BBQ chicken, top with parmesan cheese, and dip into their ranch sauce! For the girls, drink the Strawberry Splash or the Mojitos. Place is fairly new, so it looks highly modern and nice. Even the bar looks state of the art. Prices are tad high, but worth a good splurge, cocktails at $7.50/pop. Be prepared to pay about $30/person if you order drinks. Service was good and attentive this time around. Plenty of parking. Could get busy at times."
James F.,"Escondido, CA",55,29,,4.0,12/3/2013,BJs Restaurant. Went last night and had a good meal here.  Started with the calamari and it is some of the better calamari I have had.  Have to say I was very impressed.  Ordered the rib eye steak medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. Meat was a great cut and very good sized portion  Came with horseradish mashed potatoes which were also delicious. Not too much horseradish but nicely flavored. Finished with triple chocolate pizooky with peppermint crumbles. Service was good as well. Very solid dining experience. Will be going back for sure
