Cynthia T.,"Murrieta, CA",73,342,101,4.0,1/30/2011,"Really good pizza and so far everything I have ordered has been really good. I had a bad experience at the La Mesa location years ago- Crappy Food, but either this location is better or they have changed it up. The first time I came here the service was sooo SLOW! But it was busy, but still almost 2 hours for only 2 people is excessive. Tonight it was the bf and I and the service was MUCH better. My grilled pork chops were cooked perfect and his pizza was delicious. This place has a good vibe, good service and good food."
Bobby W.,"Murrieta, CA",1,14,,1.0,1/25/2013,"The service here is horrible! Not to mention, we went in for an after work meeting and ordered drinks in the bar. The manager (Shawn) came to the table and was ""educating"" us on alcohol and wanted to know why we had ordered 3 drinks in 45 minutes. Even after telling her we were not driving, she did not care and said we were putting her license at risk. She admitted we were not loud, or intoxicated, but was concerned that we were not responsible in ordering 3 drinks in less than an hour. Wow, I feel like I am 10 years old and this from a BAR MANAGER?!?! The food was cold and not good. The prices were high for happy hour and the bar tender was upset because we moved to a table from the bar and had the ticket transferred in stead of cashing out with her. We didn't realize this was a big deal and would have cashed out to avoid this horrible experience. When we tried to explain to the waiter, he was cool, but obviously indimidated by the manager, who he apoligized for numerous times. This place was dreadful!"
Chelsea F.,"Escondido, CA",3,67,15,3.0,1/2/2013,"oh man, I've had so many bad experiences with service here. Food is good, usual BJs stuff but please sit at the bar if u want to be served in a timely manner. It literally took 2.5hrs once for me and my sister from seating to leaving, lucky we didn't have anything urgent to get to that day."
Ariana Z.,"Boston, MA",7,172,,3.0,8/13/2011,"If you go there during rush hour, be prepared to wait for at least 15minutes. It wasn't bad, the wait.  The classic burger with thousand island dressing was well worth it. I ordered it with cheese and bacon (which is a little bit extra). Sadly, they didn't remember the bacon.  The service was decent, not too much bother, but sometimes we did wonder where the waiter went...All in all a pleasant experience."
Jim L.,"San Diego, CA",252,712,226,3.0,2/21/2011,"Mixed reviews here but really....who doesn't like BJ's?  It tends to be on the pricey side for pizza and beer but their deep dish pizza is hard to complain about.  I've only tried BJ's at this location a couple of times and the service has always been decent and I've always left happy.....with my pizza.  With a name like BJ's you have to expect some ridicule right?  All in all, a good place for the family and a good place to eat."
Jeff C.,"San Diego, CA",0,9,,5.0,3/21/2015,"I was amazed that this place didn't have a higher rating here on Yelp. I was in BJ's last weekend; another in a long line of visits since they opened, and it hit me that every single time I go; I realize that the food is excellent. Everything I've ordered is always very good. The craft beers are great and the deep dish pizza amazing."
J D.,"Torrance, CA",204,130,58,4.0,7/16/2013,"Why ""call ahead"" when they don't honor it... Other than that the food is good. They have lots of selections, we will be back."
Lauren G.,"San Diego, CA",27,23,12,1.0,12/22/2014,"I'm giving one star for one reason and one reason only! This establishment allows screaming babies in the bar area! WTF!!!!  Why is there a baby in the bar area of the restaurant? I don't mind Babies in the other part of a restaurant , BC from the bar I don't hear them! After a long day of work I don't want to hear someone else's problem bc they feel entitled to be in the bar area! For god sake get a fucking babysitter you lazy people!"
Keith O.,"Portland, OR",161,93,38,3.0,5/25/2011,Your corporate deliciousness pleases me. This place is good for a glass of Oaked arrogant bastard. Great service good beer what more can a man ask for.
Michelle H.,"San Diego, CA",157,628,1316,2.0,8/22/2010,"Ok, so let me put this out there. I LOVE BJ's. Adore it. Read my reviews of the other BJ's.. I think BJ's is the bomb. All of them, except this one. I was only excited about this location being here because it was next to the mall and it was slightly closer than the La Jolla one. It has a full bar, and tons of taps, but that's another story here as well. The place is extremely busy. There's always a line except on a Sunday morning at around 11.. which will be the only time you'll probably see me here, unless I'm meeting my friend from San Marcos here since it's a half-way point.  Busy means standing around waiting, while having to dodge people who are trying to swing through the revolving door. Busy means all of the inexperienced, young staff are busy being inattentive because there's too many things going on at once, or busy having some small talk with one another. Busy means your food won't get out to you for at least 20 minutes (which has been a general occurrence the past 3+ times I've been here with some friends.. not a large group, mind you). Seriously, if you sit there and count the ratio of waiters/waitresses to other customers that walk past you, it'd probably be a staggering 9:10. With so many people working at the same time, you'd think BJ's would take at least SOME time to weed out the incapable ones. === Now, this part of the review only applies to the last time I went here (this past Thursday night, around 9pm): We called ahead, so we waited about 5 minutes to get seated. The buzzer thing goes off, and we give it to the girls at the front. They stand there and push buttons and don't say anything to us for a minute or two so we stand there awkwardly staring at them like... O.o huh. Then finally another girl bursts out and asks us ""Are you Jason??"" [The boyfriend's name], I said yes, she spends a few moments ending the wonderful conversation she was having with the other girl at the desk, then looks back at us and tells us to follow her. From that odd point on, I told my boyfriend I had a feeling service was going to be poop tonight. We get seated, with what we wanted to order already in mind. 5 minutes goes by, no one comes to the table. I check the time and it's 9:24. I'm looking at every single waiter/waitress as they walk by, and none of them even glance at us. 10 more minutes go by. A jolly woman approaches and she's friendly and prompt. She tells us that Anthony (or something like that) is actually our server, but he's ""busy at the moment"" and she'll be taking our order. Cool. She gets us our beers (which, for some reason, that night tasted horribly too sweet and thick to be considered a decent heff or stout.. what happened?!?) and our plates since we ordered nachos to share. She comes back in 5 minutes to get the rest of our order, when in fact she didn't give us enough time tell her that we were only sharing nachos and a pizookie. We tell her we just want a pizookie afterwards, and I WATCH HER! I watch her walk to the end of the aisle and tell this guy our order and I stare straight at him as he glances back at me at the table.  We wait about 20 minutes for the nachos, as expected.. because putting chips and chili and cheese in the oven takes as long as pizza does to cook, right? All the while, I'm staring at the dude that's supposed to be our server each and every time he walks to the table in front of us, next to us, AND behind us to check on them and bring them their food. No acknowledgement, whatsoever. Nada. As far as I know, he doesn't even realize we exist. So, long story short, I bet my boyfriend we wouldn't be getting the pizookie we ordered, and we didn't. The dude said 4 things total to us on our visit: ""your nachos will be right out"", ""did you want another beer?"", ""did you want one?"", ""here you go guys"". Every time I've been to BJ's, I've gotten the check in a black folder. This dude just decided to fold it and put it on our table. Come onnnnnnnn. He never even introduced himself, he never asked how our food was, he never even LOOKED at us, which would have been okay, except that he was pretty accommodating to ALL of the tables around us but decided we weren't worth it or some crap. If he had actually gotten our pizookie and acted like a normal server, he would have gotten the normal 18% tip we give everyone, instead of the 10% I still feel he didn't deserve. If you're going to act like a little pansy, you're going to get a little pansy tip. My man, you're a self-fulfilling prophecy if you assumed we were crappy tippers! To the manager of this BJ's, your customers would appreciate some higher quality staff. I love BJ's, but I'd rather go to La Jolla and deal with the wait there than the wait here plus the horrible service. Peace outttttttt!"
Jean - Marc D.,"San Diego, CA",61,64,1,4.0,7/31/2013,I had a pitcher of there house beer n its was good n two personal pizza a Mediterranean and they were very goooooooood
Sydney B.,"Escondido, CA",69,11,1,1.0,8/1/2012,"Absolutely the worst BJs on the planet.  Can I give it negative stars?  Food cold when it should be warm, warm when it should be cold.  Waitstaff indifferent."
Jeremy S.,"Los Angeles, CA",123,9,1,1.0,6/7/2010,"I love BJ's and I've had a lot of BJ's all over SoCal -- I had BJ's in college, BJ's by the beach, BJ's that I've paid for, BJ's that friends have paid for, BJ's with girls, BJs with guys, sometimes both together, and I never expected that BJ's could be bad until my experience last night. Now that I've gotten your attention with my intentionally suggestive intro, I hope you'll continue reading about what an awful restaurant this Escondido location really is! As much as I love BJ's (restaurants) I will NEVER EVER go back here and I encourage anyone else who likes BJ's (restaurants) to avoid it as well, because it has now associated a horrible experience with something I usually enjoy. Call Ahead Reservations = Not really We called in like 10 minutes ahead and when we got there the name wasn't on the list. We were told that we probably were on the list from like the take out desk or something and that we got there so quickly it hadn't been transferred to the main one. Sounds like a crack system they've got! But OK, not going to let that ruin the night, kind of a minor inconvenience at most. Less than 30 Minute wait = 40 minute wait Again, kind of a minor thing 10 minutes... whatever. But maybe say ""30 minute wait"" not ""less than 30 minute wait"" (I think there was a ""definitely"" in there, but I'm not gonna quote it because I'm only 90% sure) -- it made me feel like they were trying to trick us into not leaving for another restaurant. Indoor Seating = Table right by the door that is drafty and freezing and has cigarette smoke wafting in from the waiting area outside. At this point we weren't really upset by any of the little things, plus we were hungry, so we just stuck with it. When we mentioned it in passing, we weren't offered another table (although we didn't ask directly) so we figured better to stay here and just get some food soon than to wait for another table. 45 minutes later... No food. We had a server switch half-way through our wait so maybe that had something to do with the delay, but seriously... get it together, EVERY restaurant does server switches when people have to go on break or whatever, and they seem to manage just fine. Also, with the second server, the refills slowed down significantly. When the food did arrive (3 pizzas and 1 calzone) the pizzas were warm at best, and the calzone was wrong. You should not be able to touch a pizza pan that recently came out of the oven, but you could hold this thing with your bare hands. And the calzone wasn't just wrong... the only thing RIGHT about it was that it was a calzone. Not a single ingredient was right (including the cheese!). Can we talk to a manager? - Only if you ask twice and wait 10 minutes Yes, we finally broke down and had to say something, but of course our server couldn't be found. So we walked up to the host stand and asked that a manager come over... 10 minutes later our server came over and we explained the extent of the screw up and she said she'd go get it fixed (meanwhile, it was my calzone, so I was starving... it had been almost an hour and a half since we got there). No mention of the manager... So we had to ask AGAIN. Finally, the guy shows up.  What can he do? He says all the right things, apologizes, etc. etc. He's going to take an item off the bill or something... offers a free pizookie (which we declined because I had to drive to LA after this and everything had already taken much longer than expected). Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice... So I get the 2nd calzone, and with great fanfare (and both our server and the manager present) I cut into it to inspect... Chicken and black olives, looks good! YAY I can finally eat!  Manager and server leave, and I eat alone as the rest of my party (who had already finished their food) waits for me. About 3 bites in I find a meatball. I kind of laugh it off... of course, one stray meatball gets in there, it couldn't be perfect, not tonight, hahaha. THEN I take another bite and I realize it is FULL of meatballs. WTF?? Like the middle of the calzone is Chicken and Olives, but the edges are filled with meatballs and green peppers!  This is awful, it's not what I want to eat, and I put it down. We asked to see the manager again, told him we weren't paying for anything and we were leaving. I would just get Carl's Jr. or something form the road. Icing on the cake - The parking lot is flooded! We walk out and the street is a river of water from some pipe that broke in the parking lot... There was about an inch of water I had to cross in flip-flops, and it just made for the perfect ending of a perfect night.  Admittedly, THIS was probably not BJ's fault. The only thing that got me through the aforementioned drive to LA after dinner without being just completely irate was the fantasy that my scathing review would encourage others who had bad experiences to also write reviews and one day soon that BJs would be closed down for something better. You're welcome, Escondido!"
Ben C.,"La Jolla, CA",38,59,7,1.0,10/24/2015,"Ever have one of those waitresses that come over and you can tell is either having a real bad day or is just a real b***h, but you want to give her a chance because you have been there before and know that being a server is not the easier job in the world. Well, I should have asked to be reseated or someone different right off the bat because we ended up having one of the weirdest and gnarliest experiences at a restaurant ever. Besides the fact that I have frequented BJ's al bet the place, the food most of the time comes out wrong or the service is really slow, but my kid likes the pizookie so we go there for him. Anyway, this waitress ended up literally telling me to go F myself and called me a liar after I called her out for messing something up that was blatant. I seemed out he manager and it is obvious from top to bottom BJ's employs the most idiotic and unprofessional staff from the management to the chefs. I am sick and tired of this place and j fortunately for my son, we are done. I recommend you choose one of the many other chain restaurants out there and don't waste your money at this place."
Wendy S.,"San Diego, CA",65,2,,1.0,6/7/2010,"Call ahead service? Ha! So they say, but they forgot to put us on the list so we got to wait the full regular 40 minute wait on a Sunday evening. But then we were seated and greeted promptly by our waiter who took our drink orders, returned with drinks, and took our meal orders. He even got in a drink refill as we waited for our pizzas and a calzone. (There were four of us, including our son who was going to be driving up to LA that night still). When the waiter went on break, our new waitress refilled our drinks, then we didn't see her until after our order was brought to us by someone else after waiting for our food to arrive. It had taken almost 45 minutes for our food to be served. The pizzas were cold and the calzone was wrong - we think it was someone else's order it was so wrong. The waitress checked the order, took the calzone back to the kitchen and never returned to let us know what was going on - no apologies, no information on how long it might take, nothing! My husband had to go to the hostess stand to ask to see a manager because our waitress seemed to have disappeared. No manager appeared for 10 minutes and only after the waitress magically appeared again and we asked to please find the manager for us. The manager apologized all over himself and wanted to make sure that we would ""leave happy."" About 10 minutes later the new calzone came out (the rest of us were finished eating) and my son cut into. All looked fine...until the waitress left and at about the third bite, his chicken, olive and mozzarella cheese calzone was actually that , plus meatballs and bell peppers! That was it! He still had to get to LA, and wasn't going to wait for another calzone to be made. He decided to forget it and stop off at Carl's Jr. and get something he knew he would eat and get to LA at a somewhat decent hour. He was very disappointed- BJ's had been his choice because other locations in Orange County and San Jose have always been good. Total time for our dining experience: over 2 hrs on a Sunday evening with a poor outcome.  Next time we want to go to BJ's, we'll drive to another location."
AJ Q.,"Escondido, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/21/2012,"I normally don't write reviews, but I feel strongly that I should warn any potential customers. I live nearby BJ's Escondido and have given it a fair chance too many times. I have ordered at least 1x month since it opened using Curbside To Go. The staff doesn't care what time they quote the pickup time on their website. Be prepared to wait 15+ minutes extra. I have even had to wait upwards of 45 minutes and I was the only car in the Curbside To Go area. After all the waiting, you would think that my order would be correct- No, NEVER! I have even called the manager to complain and  they blame their staff and claim they have training issues. The last time I spoke with the Manager, she offered to send me some coupons if I came back- No they never arrived. Bad management usually leads to under performing staff. Against my better judgment, I ordered Curbside To Go again tonight. It was late (9:45 PM), but the BJ's website accepted my order. I show up to BJ's and no one picks up the Curbside phone. The staff is hanging out in front of BJ's and no one cares that there is a customer-- a paying customer waiting to pay. I finally get someone to pickup the regular phone and when I complain and ask to speak to a manager, she hangs up on me. I call back and speak to the manager and he tells me Curbside To Go closes at  9 pm for staff safety-- the same staff that is hanging out outside BJ's. He did offer to walk my order accompanied by his staff when I stated that I could not walk up the ramp due to a disability, but by then I was thoroughly disgusted. I told them to keep my order- I will NEVER visit them again. BTW- I did eat inside once and the service was HORRIBLE and they forgot the chicken on my chicken cesar salad."
Andrew N.,"Escondido, CA",1101,437,76,3.0,8/5/2010,"First off, I'm a fan of BJ's brewhouse. I have been since I was in college since there was one pretty close. They have a good selection of house beers and they sell them by the pitcher. My favorite has always been the Tatonkin. Its been awhile since I've been to a Bj's. We came here for the part for two deal. Two salads, medium specialty pizza, and a pazookie for 20 dollars is great. Their medium pizza are already 20 bucks so you're pretty much getting everything else for free. Our wait wasn't too long, but they did have a line of poeple and pretty much all the tables were full. Someone else commented on bad service and I can see why. Our service actually started off pretty good, but as the night went out, our server took longer and longer to come back. Although she was not rude, she apologized and always filled our drinks when she did come back. They might be short of staff or running thin for for a Thursday night. I usually only get the buffalo chicken pizza or nachos and a pitcher of beer. Usually keeps us set for our visit there. Give their beers a try. I didnt give them 4 stars since the service wasnt super great, but the food is good."
Van N.,"La Mesa, CA",171,102,69,2.0,4/21/2011,"I've come here soooo many times. I can't quite find anything I really like here. The closest I've come was on my last visit I decided to share a pasta with my boyfriend, so we ordered the grilled chicken pasta with cream sauce, and that was okay, the best I've had yet here. I've ordered so many different items off their menu and, other than that pasta I discovered on my last visit, nothing was really good or stood out to me.  The only plus is that it's a good place for groups and my friends love the beer here.  So one star bc it's good for groups and one star bc the waiters tend to be friendly and nice!"
Natalie H.,"Escondido, CA",1,12,2,1.0,11/9/2014,"We use to love Bj's, but this location has been getting worse. Waitress was very nice and helpful, but overall service is extremely slow. Food came out cold and undercooked.  Personal pizzas were warm... The bison burger was med rare, even though med well was what requested. They completely left the slaw off the the bison burger plate, and onions were not taken off. To make matters worse, the women's restroom was filthy.  The floors were wet, two of the stalls had no toilet paper or seat covers and one of the other stalls had what looked like vomit on the seat and floor area.  Even the dessert was messed up. Ordered two pazookies, one which was a free one from an email coupon. Instead one came out and completely forgot about the second one... So the check comes and they had nicely not charged us for two of the messed up ideas, we give them our card, and 10 minutes later, they bring back a more expensive check, a different one with all the ideas on it, charging us for more than we had agreed to pay. Then it took another 10 minutes to attempt to fix the check.... Worst ever. Never coming back."
Dexter F.,"Escondido, San Diego, CA",125,13,26,4.0,7/16/2013,"This place has become one of our favorite Resturant, their menu offers many options depending on what you're craving. As much as we come here, we learning that calling ahead helps with waiting and there are lots of seating around the bar that open seating. There're happy hour menu is one of my favorite."
