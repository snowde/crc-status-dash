Josh W.,"Woodland, CA",2,36,10,2.0,11/25/2010,Bjs is great! The service at this location is horrid. SLOW Took us about THREE hours total to get through. SLOW. Our pizookies never came... Then when we were finally told they'd been forgotten and we canceled them (our waiter never apologized just looked annoyed and then took ANOTHER HALF HOUR to get us our bill.... Wow!!! SLOW SLOW SLOW.  Only come here if you could care less if it takes your waiter a couple hours to bring out your cold food.
Cynthia S.,"San Diego, CA",18,38,,2.0,11/13/2010,"The best way to describe my experience is that it seemed forever to meet with a waitperson.   Then, it took forever to receive our order. Then, the din (I think they have metal/steel ceilings) made it impossible to talk or hear the other party. Overall, the food is good but the noisy atmosphere is just too much. I know it can be corrected as I have visited other restaurants that switched over to soundproofing the ceilings."
Tracey B.,"San Diego, CA",8,110,1,4.0,10/22/2012,Love the gluten-free menu - and I actually think the GF pizza crust is way better than the regular deep dish. It's crispy and chewy. Pretty much all the toppings are GF except meatballs. And the service has gotten better over the last couple of years.
Donovan A.,"Vista, CA",62,39,130,3.0,3/31/2011,"Ask for Julie or Sheila , you can't go wrong....... Huge T.V.s and a really good happy hour . Plenty of beers on tap (c'mon 43 ?) and one of the best bars in North County to ""people watch "" .....FREAKS , COUGARS AND SUGAR DADDIES ,OH MY ! gotta love it ! $3 lunch beers ..... r u kidding ?"
Pedro S.,"Encinitas, CA",1,2,1,2.0,8/18/2013,"Normally this place is pretty good with service and food. Today was just a horrible experience came here for lunch took 20mins for our drinks. 30mins for appetizers. My wife and up just got fed up and left. The food was mediocre, the waitress Must have been sidetracked because we didn't get napkins or silverware."
Jared G.,"San Diego, CA",40,169,7,2.0,3/27/2011,"i come to this place more often than i would like... Thats what happens when you are on flag football team that plays in Escondido. We come here after games or for happy hours etc. I have eaten at Bj's probably 10-15 times and ive never found a meal here worth getting twice. The only thing thats any decent is the pizzas. But even with the pizza they give you little to no toppings. If you want a meat topping on your pizza forget about it, there might be specks of meat if you are lucky. My friends rave about the beer here, but i really dont think any of the BJ beers are any good. Jeremiah red is NOT like red trolley despite what i have heard. Overall this is a good spot for groups because the restaurant is big. I ONLY come here in a group setting so something positive can be said about that. Its a good spot to meet up or have a bday party etc. The food and beer is sub-par. Given the options in the area- North county tavern or Red Robin, you really cant win with any of them- they are all not too great."
Jessi M.,"San Diego, CA",42,23,,1.0,4/24/2010,"Okay, BJ's, you totally blew it. We gave them about a month to get their crap together before we decided to go back & we were unbelievably disappointed. We were in this restaurant for dinner for almost four friggin' hours. REALLY?! The wait to be seated was way longer than they promised. Nobody even greeted us for the first fifteen minutes. A server FINALLY came to take our drink order, even though we weren't in his section, after about twenty minutes. Then was told by management that he couldn't ""steal"" other server's tables. So, we were forced to wait some more. Our drinks took forever. Our food all came out at different times. The manager came to apologize and offered a discount and comped our pizookies. But, grrr, so over this place and their shoddy service. Their food is excellent. Seriously ... SO good. But, when I'm hungry, I want to eat ... now. Not an hour and a half after I sit down.  Not planning on going back."
B R.,"Austin, TX",0,39,19,1.0,6/20/2014,"I have been to BJs before (different locations) and love the restaurant. However, we had an awful experience at this particular location. The moment we sat down, the waitress was pushing us to sign up for the new BJ's iPhone app. We were not sure if she had incentives for doing so, but it sure felt that way. The waitress told us that we would receive $5 off our bill if we signed up so we went ahead and did so. When we were ready to pay the bill, she explained we only get $5 off if we pay on the mobile app and showed us an advertising that indicated you needed to pay via the phone. I looked at the ad and it said that a minimum of $20 needed to be spent to receive $5 off. We were splitting the bill and each bill was just under $20. So, I made a point of saying, I do not think that it will give me $5 off since it will be under $20. and indicated that I would prefer to just pay with my credit card and not worry about the $5 off. The waitress insisted I try paying via the app and said if it does not work, she will give me $5 back another way. So, I paid via the app and as I expected, no $5 off. I am finally getting to the worst part of the story. The waitress asked the manager what to do and the manager stopped by our table. She could have offered us $5 cash, a free desert, anything customer oriented. Instead she pulls out a coupon and says that she has ""left over fathers day coupons for $5 off our next visit that are still good"" and she handed me the coupon. I could not believe she even said that it was a left over fathers day coupon. And the coupon was about to expire in a week. While I like BJs in general, that was about the worst customer service I have seen in a restaurant."
Bailey J.,"Escondido, CA",195,44,,1.0,9/27/2014,"SLOW SLOW SLOW HORRIBLE RUDE SERVICE. bad mehhh food too, for half your monthly pay check. Don't go here."
Kimberly R.,"Carlsbad, CA",3,19,,1.0,3/29/2010,"Let me start off by saying I really really LOVE BJ's pizza, it is absolutely yummy goodness to me. My experience at this restaurant was one of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had in my entire life. My party of 2 arrived at 11:45am, we were seated promptly and had our drink order taken right away.  What they brought us were drinks in 2 of the dirtiest glasses I had ever seen in a restaurant.  My glass was slimey and had dressing all over it.  My friend's glass had some big black slimey thing stuck to the outside of the glass and dressing on the INSIDE of the glass. We grabbed a random waiter to change our drinks. We then proceeded to wait 20 minutes for our waitress to return to take our order.  I ordered half a sandwich with caesar salad and my friend got the fish tacos.  30 minutes later she finally brought my salad, in that timeframe though I had to ask random waiters for refills on our drinks since she never checked on us.  20 minutes after the salad she stops by to say oh your food will be right out and I'll get you some refills, 10 minutes later stopped random waiter to get a refill.  10 minutes later the food finally arrived.  5 minutes later waitress returned with refills that she told us she was going to bring 25 minutes ago.  Waitress disappears again for another 30 minutes before returning to bring the check. In the time, my friend waited for our food, there were 3 tables around us that came, ordered, ate, and left before we ever got our food!! So I know this wasn't related to the grand opening, the crowd or the lack of kitchen staff, everybody else was getting their food promptly. Not once did the waitress ever apologize for the dirty glasses, or slow service and of course we were charged for everything.  Most places when you point out a dirty glass don't charge you for their drink, we were charged full price for everything.  Instead of waiting 20 minutes to argue, we paid and left. I will never set foot in this location again."
Cindy F.,"Escondido, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/10/2014,"Here goes nothing.. I've been to this BJ's often with my fiance, friends, family etc. My most recent experience has led me to believe that customer service no longer matters. If you find a foreign object in your food the least I would expect is for the food to be replaced and the price of that item be waived right? Or am I expecting too much? To top it all off?The server was rude about it! I know it was not his fault in any way shape or form but he looked at me like I was the one who did something wrong. I was very offended and could not even eat my meal after. What if I had choked on that foreign object BJ's?? Honestly, I'm very disappointed and will not be making any plans to go BJ's anymore."
Lena H.,"San Diego, CA",1,22,5,2.0,11/21/2015,Came in earlier this afternoon. I always been a fan of this restaurant but I normally eat at the mission valley location. Anyways I order grilled chicken Alfredo with added shrimp and blacken chicken. It took about 30 mins for my friend and I plates to come out. Our server was awesome and kept checking up on us. When our food came out my pasta was red.... That's odd bc Alfredo is suppose to be a creamy white?! The noodles was not cooked all the way and it was room temperature!!! What the heck?! Literally the noodles was so hard ! So I politely asked the server to take it back. Another 15 minutes went by for my plate to come back. This time it was a completely different there was no Alfredo sauce at all and no garlic bread!!! I had to ask for a side of the sauce! I was extremely disappointed and will not be coming back to this location. I just don't understand how do you mess up pasta? The young male was great I felt bad for him. But the cooks are terrible. If you can't make simple Alfredo sauce pasta you should not be in the kitchen sorry not sorry.
Brandy S.,"San Diego, CA",20,23,1,3.0,4/21/2013,"Not bad but not great - our service was very good but it seemed like we paid a lot for what we got. My son had the kids mini-burgers and side salad. He liked the burger but the ""salad"" was a plate of lettuce, some of it wilted, and four small tomato slices. My daughter's chicken fingers had more breading than chicken and the breading was fried hard. She liked the thin-cut French fries. I had the spring Thai chicken salad, which was pretty good. It has a little too much spicy seasoning, but I could scrape some off. My husband enjoyed his grilled mahi-mahi over rice. He said the draft beer was almost as good as what he gets at Karl Strauss. And we both liked the avocado egg roll appetizer, probably more than our entrees."
Jackie F.,"San Diego, CA",185,272,108,4.0,3/31/2010,"Pro: Pizza, Booze, and Desert.  Con: Inaccurate orders.  I will probably review this place again in a few weeks.  With that said, I went there with a buddy the nite after opening day. Yes, yes, service will be crap... but it was actually good. Food was absolutely on par with the locations, including my favorite BJ's in Long Beach. But the coordination between our waitress and food server didn't exist, condiment request took too long to show up - followed by 3 people being the same thing, give us someone else's pizza, screwed up the bazookie order.  But other than that, everything was golden. :)  To people of Esco, don't dress up to dine at BJ's, it's sad."
Preetham V.,"San Diego, CA",75,32,18,4.0,3/10/2013,"This place has been consistently good in terms of food and service for us so far! Always a busy place, love the atmosphere and love that its open late. Our favorites are the avocado rolls, BJs brownie, pizookie and deep dish pizza. Sometimes we come here just for desserts coz they use Ghirardelli chocolate and so, its very decadent."
Alma G.,"San Diego, CA",0,5,,1.0,4/4/2010,"I am actually writing this as we go to pay the bill here at BJ's.. I was so ready to get on Yelp and warn everyone! I love the BJ's in La Mesa, but this one in Escondido is like a madhouse! We had a reservation at 9pm, and we didn't get seated until 10 because another huge party came in earlier and the restaurant seated THEM (they admitted to doing it too!). We ended up getting seated seperately, and nobody came to take our drink orders until 15 minutes later.. I can go on and on. Food was bad, service was bad.. I can seriously say this is the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant! I do have to say that they have been opened for only a month and maybe thats why they are so chaotic.. they better get their act together to ever make me come back!"
Frank M.,"Santa Barbara, CA",0,5,,1.0,10/24/2010,This place has Horrible Service! We came in a group. The two hostesses glanced at us and turned around to finish their non work related conversation with their manager. The place wasn't busy at all. After a minute or two she asked us to move to the side for no reason. After they finished their conversation one of the girls finally took us our table. It was very awkward and unprofessional. I would not recommend this place for a birthday dinner with your friends and family.
Scarlett M.,"San Marcos, CA",82,29,2,3.0,11/10/2014,Expensive. The food isn't the greatest. The service is good though. And the drinks are strong. Woo! John was a great bartender.
Edward C.,"San Diego, CA",19,6,1,5.0,6/29/2013,It was a busy Saturday and there was a wait. I was informed I could sit in the bar area where Bo was helping me. He could see I was not wanting to sit ingest the guest that were obviously having a great time but a little louder then I cared for. That's when he offered to sit me in Ryan's section. He recommended the Parmesan crusted chicken which was amazing and was top notch service. I hate comin to the mall but thank goodness I came I to this BJs for lunch. Kudos to the staff!
AKA A.,"San Diego, CA",53,168,11,3.0,6/24/2013,BJ's is okay. Some of the food is great and some of it is just ...... hmmmmm whatever. .. lol
