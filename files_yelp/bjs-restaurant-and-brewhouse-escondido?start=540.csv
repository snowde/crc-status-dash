Marty T.,"San Diego, CA",145,46,3,1.0,4/29/2012,We went to B.J's on a Saturday night around 9:30.  We waited about 45 minutes for one of the orders ( a simple burger)  and then it didn't come out at the same time as the other order.  There was a 15 minute longer wait for the second order!  The food was just ok.  The only thing positive that I can mention is that the menu offers a fabulous variety of options.
Ryan C.,"Escondido, CA",27,19,,2.0,9/1/2013,"This place is a bit of a gamble lately.  I suspect it's a staffing problem, mostly focused on the management.  It's completely possible that there are other staffing problems (or particular individuals); however, based on the other reviews here on Yelp plus my own experiences I think the root cause is with the management team. In our most recent experience, my family was seated almost immediately.  I asked the hostess to change the closest TV to the only live sports event (NASCAR, in this case) since it was playing a replay of horse racing from earlier in the day.  The host was happy to accommodate, and mentioned that she would ask her manager to change the channel.  Our server got to us quickly, and we ordered an app and  drinks (including drinks from the bar)--they came out quickly as well, and the drinks had the touch of an excellent bartender.  It took about 5 minutes or so before our server got back to us (she was relatively busy), and we ordered our food.  I asked her to see about getting the closest TV changed, too--just in case the hostess dropped the ball and didn't pass the request on to the manager. Skipping forward over 30 minutes, and I'm still looking at a replay of horse racing from earlier in the day.  It's clearly not the worst of all crimes, but it's unlikely that both the hostess and the server failed to notify a manager.  All the tables near us changed over, too, so it's not like anyone was actively winning/losing money on these ponies. So what's the big deal about the TV, you say?  It probably wouldn't be a problem, except we still didn't have our food.  Another 15 minutes pass, and our server comes by to say that our food should be up any minute.  Something is wrong in the kitchen, I guess.  A few minutes later, a manager arrives and tells us that the ticket got lost somehow, and all our food is being remade and should be out immediately.  We understand these things can happen, so okay. First out is my food, and one kid's.  His is fine, mine clearly was sitting around for a while--the plate was hot, but the food was cold.  I sent mine back as more of the food showed up.  The kids' food was clearly hot and fresh; however, my wife's food had also been sitting around for a while--the chicken was cooled down but the celery was warmed up (heat lamp).  She opted to just eat rather than send it back, too.  Shortly after, the rest of the food arrived (minus mine, since it was going to take about 10 minutes to remake). Sometime, while my food was being remade, the TV in front of me changed to the NASCAR race.  So that was something, which was nice. When my food arrived, it was hot.  It wasn't the best, but I'd give it a passing grade: the kitchen was in a hurry to get it out and make sure it was hot.  They succeeded, but it wasn't impressive.  Maybe I was just bitter by then, but I try to keep my own bad attitude out of the ratings (where possible, of course!). So, lots of apologies from the server.  It wasn't her fault, and she was nearly in tears over everything.  I can't blame her.  It's her tip on the line, and if the leadership and kitchen can't get their acts together it's causing her to lose out on money.  I certainly wouldn't put up with that situation for long--there are other restaurants looking for motivated and qualified serving staff. At the end, a different manager stopped by and talked about the bill.  He comped us for ""about half"" of the bill.  It's appreciated that they recognized the screw-ups (well, I don't think the TV thing was ever acknowledged, but I didn't point it out, either), and that they want us to return, and really at that immediate moment about the only thing management can do is comp some of the bill.  Based on the other reviews for this location, I wonder how often they are screwing things up with others.  Even if I get a free meal every couple/few times I return, it won't convince me that I should come back very often.  Instead, I'd much prefer the leadership focus on the issues, get them resolved, and start to enjoy better profits."
Joey M.,"San Diego, CA",48,136,17,2.0,12/27/2010,"Happy Hour is Blah  So I went to this place when it first opened, and the service was bad. But, I knew that might be because it was brand spakin new. Well not much has changed. The service is still really slow. It has got a little better, but not by much.  We went in for Sunday lunch happy hour. Not a fan of the happy hour. $1 off cocktails is not much of a deal. What gets me is the cocktails are mediocre at best. I felt cheated since the bartender was making super weak drinks. Now don't get me wrong, I don't need strong cocktails every outing. But Geez at least pour some liquor in. I ordered a Vodka Cranberry with Gray Goose, and I might have got 1oz of vodka. So I basically paid $7 for a glass of Cranberry juice.  The positives  -Really nice new spot, with a huge TV above the bar.  -Plenty of seating in the bar  -Half off the mini pizza during happy hour (that means $5 mini pizza)  -While the service might be really slow, at least they are kind of nice  Do I plan on returning........Yes. It seems like every once in awhile someone's like ""lets go to BJ's and watch the game. I just wish they would get better looking bartenders, and make better drinks."
T C.,"San Marcos, CA",210,14,,1.0,4/16/2012,Super slow service!!! WTF is the deal? Mismanaged. I will not be coming back and I will recommend that my friends do the same.
Shawna B.,"Charlotte, NC",4,7,,4.0,11/22/2011,"We recently went here unannounced on a Saturday night with a group of 14 to celebrate my husband's birthday, after plans at another restaurant fell through.  They were more than accommodating.   Our waitress was excellent!  Our food came out just as ordered.  And they even offered to keep our cake in the frig for us until time to serve it.  After our meal they waitress brought us candles & a lighter for the cake. Overall, it was a great experience, after being treated less than human at Stone Brewery."
Brandon P.,"Escondido, CA",89,13,,4.0,1/10/2015,This place is so nice they have a good variety of appetizers and r sooooo good for an entree i ordered the jalepeno burger which was good although i would have liked it a little more spicy for take out along with a few other orders they made it so easy to order and was so fast in making it so wen i picked it up it was all ready and they told me each thing i ordered as they placed it in the bag the hostez was super nice in the take out counter she made sure we had all utensils and any sauces wen needed so over all it was a pretty good experience
Hakan L.,"San Diego, CA",65,68,4,4.0,12/28/2012,"They have an impressive menu, and excellent beer list. The food quality is in-line with the price. I'm a regular, bringing the whole family."
Mark H.,"San Diego, CA",77,193,70,4.0,4/15/2010,"Many of us have come to love BJ's. But there can be little doubt that the location in the North County Fair (sorry, I'll always call it North County Fair) is experiencing some start-up pains. The service is hit and miss right now. It's good one day; it's bad another. But that's OK. Why? Because all you need to do is ask for Sheena, the manager. She's responsive to customer needs. Have her come to your table. Tell her all of your problems. She's really good. She's a bubbly, cute, Boston transplant. I love her can-do attitude. If your waitress needs retraining, let Sheena know. She wants to know this stuff.  The food is always excellent at BJ's, so I'll spare the food review. For now, it's the service that needs work. Sheena's your girl, though. Let her know what's happening on the ground."
Joshua M.,"San Diego, CA",204,1480,170,2.0,1/22/2012,"O h m y G o d t h e s e r v i c e h e r e i s s l o w.  Not only is it slow, but the two male servers we had weren't very professional.  The first guy had a thing for calling me ""boss,"" and I think that term is condescending.  I'm not your boss, be professional and if you need to address me at all (which you usually don't taking my order), just say ""sir.""  You can address any male as sir and be fine.  After we finally got our food (waited 45 minutes for a burger and french dip), our waiter transfered us to a different server.  He didn't call me ""boss.""  He did however call me ""dude,"" which wasn't anymore appropriate.  I would probably have not cared as much had I not been starving and had to wait that long. The food for the record was decent, but I would definitely avoid this location."
Wendy T.,"Escondido, CA",32,61,,4.0,4/8/2010,"A friend of mine and I took our kids on opening week and we were pretty impressed. We didn't suffer the terrible waits that others seemed to; there was about a 20 minute wait to get seated, but it's a new restaurant. What'd you expect? The server was nice and didn't mess up any of the orders. As for the food:  My kids LOVED their orange cream sodas.  The calamari was a good appetizer.  My b'b'que pizza was great. One of my sons got a b'b'que beef sandwich which he Hated! My friend got a chicken salad that she said wasn't very good. Soooo: Pizzas, drinks, calamar, YES!"
Matt M.,"San Diego, CA",31,13,,3.0,2/23/2013,"Decent food, Terrible for you food but comfort food. Decent Beer, Service is kinda rushed. For some reason we always end up going here for New Years Eve."
Jeremy L.,"Portland, OR",18,2,,5.0,4/17/2010,"We were a bit hesitant to visit this location after so many unfavorable reviews, but for my birthday, I wanted to try a new restaurant and one that was local. So we decided to take the chance anyway...and I'm extremely happy that we did. First of all, almost all of the food was exceptional. The only ""beef"" I have w/ the food, was the NY Strip...it was just ""meh"". My 9 yr old ordered the child portion of ribs...which were also just ""ok"".  We understand that BJ's isn't really a steak/rib place though, so not a big deal. The rest of the food we ordered (party of 6) was fantastic. I'm NOT a fan of avocado whatsoever. However, we did order the avocado eggrolls, and they were phenomenal.   Food and Drinks: A  It could have been A+ if the ribs/steak dinner was more memorable. Ribs were a bit dry, and while steak was cooked fine, it just didn't have much flavor. The table agreed, that my home grilled steaks are much, much better.  The pizza, calzone, appetizers and burgers were great though. Wait Time: We went on 4/17/10, Saturday evening. We expected the worst due to all the negative reviews about waiting and service. I called ahead 30 mins, once we got there, we waited 20 mins. Which was fine, because we were told it would be an additional 30 mins once we arrived.  Wait time: not a big deal for us at all..and it was PACKED.   Just make sure you call ahead. Reservations are for 10+, else you can only use call ahead seating. Service: Service was interesting. Again, we expected good food yet horrid service and wait times. But the wait (as noted above...was just fine). And the service was terrific!  Holly was our waitress. She was very professional and seemed extremely experienced. We were floored when she said this was her first serving job. She was one of the best waitresses we've ever had (and we eat out quite often). She checked on us often. She was very sociable, great with our 2 kids and made us feel like our experience was important to her.  She noticed the little things...like an experienced waitress would. We could not have had a better wait service at this restaurant. I asked if we could ask for her by name next time, and she said yes. So...from now on, we will always try to be waited on by Holly. She's an extremely valuable asset to this restaurant. The rest of the wait staff were also very good. Not a single problem. All very courteous, professional, and seemingly eager to help and please. They helped make a very fun and memorable experience. Wait Time: A+.  Service: A+ One thing however...we could tell that the restaurant was new. It was kind of funny and we turned it into a drinking game. The servers seemed to get tables mixed up quite a bit. I think they may not have their table number system down quite yet (or maybe it just changes a lot).  We noticed during the time we were there, that 8 times (6 to us) servers weren't sure which table the food was supposed to go to. So, every time we noticed this happening, the table had to take a drink.  It was all in good fun though. We didn't have a bad experience. I think we did have to exchange one set of silverware because a fork wasn't washed properly....but it was nothing big. This was an exceptional experience of terrific food served by an awesome wait staff. We think that this will become one of our favorite restaurants and plan to visit quite often...and have Holly serve of us...of course! She's the best...ask for her by name. You will not regret it."
Trish S.,"Escondido, CA",910,82,271,4.0,11/18/2010,"WOOOT  WOOT my FIRST review..... I have NOTHING bad to say about this place. I went there with a friend after work we got there about 1ish wasn't packed. We had great service. Bartenders were nice and always asked if we needed anything.  The prices were OK, and the food was very food.  If you're looking to go and meet people, or even have a conversation with, warning.... if you like having convos with middle aged men then this is the place for you! was definitely a sausage fest!"
Jay M.,"San Diego, CA",2,16,23,4.0,2/1/2013,Good food and atmosphere. Ordered the appetizer platter and a medium pizza for two people. It was more than enough to fill us up. Home made sodas are worth a try.
Brad S.,"San Diego, CA",3,14,3,4.0,6/3/2013,"I don't know what other people are expecting ..after all it is a national chain. I have been here many times and the experience has been great. Awesome selections of beer, I had my family over for a late Saturday lunch last weekend, the food was great the ambiance is nice and the server was fine.  We ordered Pizza was was great, I had the Jambalaya which was fantastic, with Andouille sausage, rice and smoke paprika... Ohhhh sooo good....Did we get fantastic service ? No but it was good enough to earn 4 starts.  Sunday night I took my buddy there for his birthday and we got pretty good drinks and I cannot complain at all.  I love the large TV in the bar I wish they could just make it one big TV during big games..."
Sandy L.,"Orcutt, CA",7,4,,1.0,5/8/2012,"Really bad service, server didn't make the correct order to kitchen....."
Alisha N.,"San Marcos, CA",106,20,1,4.0,3/20/2014,"I love the food at BJ's and the quality of service is always consistently good. I was in the other day right before the dinner rush and the service was better than normal :) I've tried a few different dishes and they've all been great. Getting food for take-out is fast and easy as well. I just started their rewards program and they give you a free mini pizookie just for joining. They also offer you to add to your program to get suggestions on beers to go with your meals as well. One thing that I feel is a little pointless is their call ahead system. You can call ahead of time to put your name down, but they don't add you to the line until you arrive at the restaurant. There's really no difference in wait time if you call a head or not. Something they may want to consider changing. With their rewards program, if you get enough points you can use them towards making a reservation (which they normally don't offer). Overall, I love going to BJ's and the wait time usually isn't that bad even during their rush hours."
Victoria A.,"San Diego, CA",0,11,,4.0,10/29/2013,"BJ's is one of my family's favorite go-to places for pizza. The only problem is the long wait for a table depending on what time you go there. But once you order, the service is good and the pizza comes pretty fast!  I love their pizza dough. And lots of TVs around for my husband and kids to watch the games while we wait."
Omar G.,"San Diego, CA",43,185,114,3.0,9/30/2012,"Great place, good food..amazing beer (wish they were a bit cheaper) but awesome place!!"
Jaime K.,"Washington, DC",12,26,,4.0,4/10/2010,"FOUR STARS because it's B.J.'s.  It's brand new and new restaurants always take a few months to work out their kinks.  If your not prepared for that, wait a few months before trying it out! Positive: Lot's of variety on the menu, affordable lunch prices, good selection for children (even ""healthy"" sides).  Big beautiful bar and good beer selection!  Better than anything else in Escondido! Negative: Corporate restaurant (You gotta love the small individual places that have more personality).  Waiters seemed a little confused.  I ordered a pizookie for my niece (she's 3 years old) and they brought the regular size.  They need to make sure they distinguish sizes.  Especially when  I asked my niece what flavor she wanted.  The waitress was really cool about it but the food runner seem baffled!  No biggie, clarification when taking orders helps!! FOOD:  My Dad ordered the lunch portion shrimp tacos and he really enjoyed them.  I had the veggie pizza on the ""lighter"" lunch section.  I am surprised the pizza is considered ""light"", its deep-dish.  Also, I asked for very light cheese and it was covered in cheese.  My nieces each got chicken fingers off the kids menu and they probably could have shared one (they are both under 5 yrs. old).  The kids Oreo pizookie was sweet and yummy.  It would be a good size for two adults ( for people who just like a couple bites of dessert) Give B.J.'s time and it will flourish into the corporate ""goodness"" it is!  Lord knows that North County inland needs anything decent.  All we need now is for the bowling alley to open up!  I am looking forward to drinking B.J.'s beer and going bowling!!"
