Jeff M.,"Escondido, CA",97,36,,3.0,11/26/2010,"It may be too early to give a fair review.  I was there on Monday for the NCAA Championship and the place was jumping. The place is really spanking brand new, and very nicely decorated.  We sat in the bar, could have had a few less chairs, to make it more comfortable. Tuesday night is 50% off wine night."
Jerry G.,"Lindenwold, NJ",0,171,6,1.0,3/15/2015,"I want to first say that the food was good. However everything else was horrific. First it took at least 10 minutes before we had our drink order taken. It took so long my wife went to the bathroom ,  changed our daughters diaper and still had time to select meals from the menu before our drink order was taken. So when the waitress came over our entire order was taken.  We ordered an appetizer which arrived about 10 minutes later but still no drinks.  When the drinks were finally brought out waitress. Said the order was up but we still didn't get in for another 10 minutes. It was obviously sitting under the warmer because when we receive out food, the lettuce garnish was wilted and the cold cucumber Sauce was warm not cold.  During our meal the waitress took my glass for a refill of just water for at least 5 minutes. So my choice was let my good get cold or not have a drink.  Lastly after our meal we used the restroom, 2 of 3 toilets were plugged up and the door on the third was broken, if the bathroom is gross is what t is the kitchen like.  They had plenty of staff service is just lousy and unfriendly. Turn and burn the tables is the feeling we got."
Anthony E.,"San Diego, CA",230,445,36,3.0,8/13/2010,"The food is great and filling and we always leave with leftovers.  The only thing is that it is too crowded and loud.  Although, a few beers will fix that and that pretty much sums it all up.  What would this place be without the Pazookie?  Just another deep dish pizza restaurant  :)"
Maxx S.,"San Marcos, CA",202,6,2,4.0,7/21/2014,"straight up great queso dip, tasty chicken pasta, and a Mediterranean deepdish pizza that was to die for... overall a fantastic date night for my girlfriends birthday."
Rachel Q.,"San Diego, CA",279,584,46,4.0,8/26/2010,"The fiance and I had a little happy hour impromptu date after work this week..  This BJ's looks almost identical to the BJ's that Joe and I had gone to in Ontario.. the layout is very, very similar.. Joe enjoys the happy hour because most of the appetizers are $2 off..  I enjoy it because it's BJ's and I usually have no complaints about the food.. we got the flatbread pizza and the sliders.. The flatbread pizza was a little bit disappointing because we ordered the tomato, basil, sausage one.. but there were probably only three tiny pieces of sausage on that entire pizza.. the taste was very yummy that we didnt' really miss the meat on there.. but it just feels like false advertising.. The sliders were yummy.. sliders are usually yummy.. Joe and I will probably have many more outings to this place.. or any BJ's restaurant.. we seem to enjoy it here.. especially those pizookies!!!"
Caren I.,"Escondido, CA",72,4,,4.0,8/17/2014,"I'm going to first start out by saying that it's not easy for our staff to make every customer who comes in happy. Human labor is not easy period, in case no one knows. But we are trying our best to give our customers the best service we can.  And for MICHELLE I... whoever you are, I don't know who you and I sure as hell never seen you before. But you shouldn't be posting up lies publicly and not think that somebody won't call you out on it. Cuz how could you be my friend? Especially when your not saying good things about this place.  Sorry my friends don't do that. I don't know you and you are definitely not my friend. I've seen the two reviews you posted about this place and both wasn't good. So whoever you are keep ur lies and comments to ur self cuz people don't need to hear them if the comments aren't going to be honest. Yes it's a new management,  and things are a Lil crazy right now but things will get better as soon as everything is done with the transitioning of management. Just give it some times and you will see."
Winnie L.,"San Diego, CA",35,118,54,2.0,3/15/2012,"Your RESERVATION policy is awful. The call ahead is a total sham. The alleged premise is you call in your party ahead of time and get priority seating when you arrive. The guy who answered told me that as soon as I arrive, check in with the hostess and it would be a 10 mins wait. As soon as I arrived, the hostess said 25 mins. I didn't bother arguing with her about the false advertisement, but 30 mins later I realized that this whole thing is a joke.  I approached the hostess and she told me that it would be another 5-10 mins. I told her that when I called her coworker told me 10 mins and now its been triple the time. She apologized and said that they are waiting for tables to clear and that the guy answering the phone has no.idea what's happening out here. I responded, ""then someone needs to tell him not to give wrong information over the phone because I came here under the impression it would be a short wait."" The hostess apologized again and said that they have a lot of people and that there were other callers too. I know its not her fault, but if I really wanted to, I could've totally continued on that debate with her that its essentially not my fault I was given wrong info and her managers should enforce their supposedly great call in policy more true to what it advertises. However, she should have offered to speak with her coworkers about giving wrong info. Instead, she made excuses. While waiting, other people near us were complaining too so clearly it wasn't just us frustrated with their awful wait time."
mike k.,"San Diego, CA",2,133,,2.0,9/29/2012,"While not a complete loss, I don't think we will be coming back anytime soon.  The most accurate quote for this place is ""UPSCALE TGI FRIDAYS"". As many of the other posters mentioned.....  THE SERVICE WAS GOD AWFUL SLOW....We had to ask many times for our drinks to be refilled and took 15 minutes to get the check from the time we asked for it.  Food was average (we ordered just about everything except pizza) on quality and quantity."
Molly U.,"Garden Grove, CA",1,35,,2.0,6/17/2013,"I'm normally a big fan of BJ's restaurants and we frequent the Huntington Beach location often. While on vacation in this area, we decided to stop by the Escondido BJ's. It's a chain restaurant, so we thought we knew what to expect; unfortunately, this location really, really let us down. It was packed at lunch time on a Saturday; for a party of 7, it was about a 45 minute wait. It wouldn't have been a problem if there hadn't have been open tables that I could see from our waiting spot that the hostesses were too busy flirting with the servers to notice. The table we were eventually sat at was open for over 10 minutes, and I could hear an audible ""oops"" from the hostess when she realized this (we were literally the only customers waiting, so she was not going back looking for tables at all). The portion sizes at this BJ's are WAY smaller than at other locations. My mom and sister ordered the pasta with marinara sauce, and they put the wrong sauce (spicy marinara instead of regular marinara). My mom cannot eat spicy foods, and asked for a new dish. All the waitress did was bring out plain noodles and a side of sauce, and it took almost 20 minutes. Everyone was finished eating before my mom even got her food.  Definitely know not to stop at this particular location again."
Melissa R.,"Escondido, CA",63,67,7,3.0,9/27/2010,"Overall I was happy with the food and the service once we got there. I'm only giving 3 stars though because they kept messing up our reservation prior to the night of our dinner. My husband called in with a reservation for 18 or so on Wednesday night, and he called back on Friday to add a few more people and they had his reservation down for the wrong time. Again, he called on Saturday to change the headcount and again they had the reservation time wrong. finally they got it right, but still, with a party that big you don't want to be stressing. Once there, service was good, food was excellent! I loved the Great White pizza! I'll go back just for that! Also tried the chicken parm. which was surprisingly super spicy! I loved it! Their beer was okay. Not enough good IPA's in my opinion, but I didn't expect there to be hard to find beers there. I will most likely be back for their pizza, oh! And for their pizzookies, or however you spell it. Those are the bomb! yum!"
Chris W.,"Escondido, CA",52,5,,3.0,6/7/2011,"I have visited BJs 3 times now,  Service was OK   Beer:  The Beer they Personally brew is ok...  Good thing is they have a large selection from other breweries. Food.  I had their Miso Salmon, which was real good,  no complaints there. Even though they said no rush with the bill,  I felt like we were sped through, before I knew it, we were getting ready to leave.  I felt really rushed and that is something I do not like to feel.  I will go here in the future due to their large menu and huge beer selection."
Katarina D.,"San Francisco, CA",821,105,4,3.0,7/26/2010,"The wait is ridiculous! I mean, the pizzas are pretty good but who wants to wait 40 minutes to be seated? It's always super busy but I guess that's what makes it ""good""... huh. I've also been to the one in Carlsbad. I guess there are shorter waits there... but maybe it was just the timing.  Overall, A-/B+ for food, C/D for service."
Julie C.,"Escondido, CA",42,14,3,2.0,4/13/2010,"The worst service ever.  Maybe it's because they had just opened but it's been over two weeks.  All the employess looked overwhelmed.  We had a party of eight just in from a hike and we were HUNGRY!  Took about 15 minutes to get our drinks, 1 hour to get our food.  I ordered a Turkey burger with bacon added, Tabasco sauce and a Cesare salad.  The salad never came, the bacon was not added and the tabasco did not materilize.  Other people at the table experienced screwups, like not getting their salads, dressings that were supposed to be on the side, poured all over the salad, etc.   Hopefully, this is just because they, like I said were just opened a couple of weeks...but if this type of service continues, I doubt if they would last very long."
Addie K.,"Schenectady, NY",2,19,,5.0,2/17/2013,"Been here many times and I have never had an issue! The food is consistently good, the service is consistently good, and I love the atmosphere! There baked potatoes are great, and I always manage to save room for a chocolate chip pizookie! Bjs is a great go to restaurant if you want to catch some of your favorite sports game and they can accommodate large groups!"
Brandy S.,"Placentia, CA",72,6,,1.0,11/18/2011,Horrible service!!! Servers standing around chatting but not serving. 15 minutes before the server even greeted us. Happy hour...not so much!!
Super C.,"San Diego, CA",0,28,2,4.0,1/29/2013,"Best BJ's I've been to. The food is always good. Diverse menu. Good beer. The service is hit or miss. It can take a long time to get your order taken, drinks or the bill sometimes. But, you are not rushed and it is a good atmosphere. Great place to stop after a round of golf or for an early dinner."
SelfishMoney O.,"Southeast, Las Vegas, NV",0,1,,1.0,5/3/2013,"First time at bj's thought it'd be a nice place for lunch....... Coincidentally the name of the place actually describes my experience (think about it), the food took close to 30 min and the place wasn't crowded what so ever. When the food finally did come the order was wrong and the second time there was a hair in it. Once they actually did get it rite it literally looked and tasted like it had been sitting overnight and was just microwaved. Plus they only refilled my water once for a hour long stay...... Just saying"
White R.,"Marana, AZ",12,202,5,4.0,7/9/2010,"My experience here seemed a lot better than most of the previous reviewers. We had about a 10 minute wait and were seated in a nice booth by the hostess. A few minutes went by and the head hostess came by and asked if our server had been by yet, which she hadn't. The head hostess took our drink and appetizer order and they appeared shortly before our waitress to take our main course orders. I have to say the service was great and friendly just for the head hostess checking up on us. The brewed beers were great, and the main dishes were ok. I wish the mozzarella cheese sticks came with more dipping sauce, though. The place can get very busy, but it didn't seem overly loud inside. I'd come back for a couple of the beers and maybe a pizza next time. This is a new location, so perhaps they will get even better as time goes on."
James P.,"Escondido, CA",6,7,,5.0,1/13/2011,"Wow....people with the bad reviews just after they opened. Come on it takes time to get the staff trained etc. My wife and I waited until the place had been opened a few months before going. We had a great experience!! We were taken care of by our waiter and the food was incredible. Sampled some of their brews that were well made. Being a homebrewer my self I was impressed. Food, beer and desert were all outstanding!"
John B.,"Escondido, CA",9,39,4,3.0,7/30/2010,"Eh, don't bash this place too much. I'll admit, I'm rating this place as average because of the wait. If you don't call in or just screw around you'll have to wait at least half an hour.  Redeeming qualities? Sure, they give you pizza while waiting, which is some of the best I've had, ever. Aside from that, what you get when you order is alright, there's just a lot of it. Which is kinda weird. I like quality over quantity. Another thing, which some people I know will get annoyed at, is how noisy it is inside. It's trying to be a restaurant/ bar hybrid, but the two sides only meet halfway. The bar is noisy, but there are big TVs. The restaurant is comfy, but it's loud because of the bar and crowded.  Kind of a hit and miss here, might be good for a one time thing but it's not a practical choice."
