P L.,"San Diego, CA",0,33,,1.0,12/10/2013,"The only item that was great was the Double IPA.  I'd buy it by the case.  We are repeat customers at this location and would have recommended it in the past.  Now, I'm quite sure we'll never go back. We had a ""new"" server, at least that's what he repeated to everyone. He first delivered the beer and an iced tea.  Never once did he offer sweetener for the iced tea and there was never an offer for a refill during the hour that we were sitting there. He then managed to deliver a wrong item to us.  He said we would keep it if we wanted to. The item was the Ahi salad.  The salad was wilting/rotting and the Ahi that was served was inedible.  It was a health hazard and should have never left the kitchen. We asked the waiter to take it back and dispose of it.  We also had the Ahi Poke.  The Ahi was better than that served on the salad, but not top quality to be served raw.  With some dressing it was edible.  The thin cut fries and calamari were fine, but very greasy.  Both should be served on a paper doily to sop up some of the oil. Well, lunch was a wasted $33.91. BTW-  We were sitting across from Barry M who also had the same newbie server and same terrible experience that we had .  See his 1 STAR review from 12/10/2013"
Holly B.,"Escondido, CA",2,2,,1.0,10/11/2013,Worst experience yet here. We've thought they were slow at this particular location but today was especially slow. After being seated waited 10 minutes to be approached. We were ready to order drinks and our meals. Took another 15 minutes to get our drinks- so now we've been here 25 minutes. Bring our food and 1 order was wrong. Asked to have a to go order when we ordered dinner. Waitress said she'd put it in when we were eating. Came by to check on us once we were finished. Forgot to put in the order. TERRIBLE SERVICE! Employees standing around chatting. You can tell this location is mismanaged. This was our regular spot to come (once a week). No more. We're finally done.
Brad B.,"Poway, CA",8,117,15,1.0,10/7/2013,My family and I come here a lot.  Typically we are here once a week...Escondido has limited choices. Service is intermittent. There are good servers and not so good servers. Tonight was exceptionally bad. It took ten minutes to be greeted after sitting down and  20 to get our drinks. The restaurant could not have been more than 50 percent occupied. We ordered drinks and food at the same time. My wife's fish came out blackened when she ordered grilled. Overall it took an hour and 15 minutes to get through our meal of mediocre food to the tune of $100+. We are premier rewards members in excess of 1000 pts (meaning we have spent over $1000 since joining the rewards program). Oh and when my daughter asked for parmesan cheese to go with her adult plate of pasta she was given a dozen packets like you would get from a pizza delivery person. Really? This place is going down-hill fast. I think I will try the new Plan 9 Alehouse on Grand next time.
Brian G.,"Poway, CA",0,35,2,1.0,5/25/2013,This place has changed and the poor reviews are more then warranted. Went there for daughters 9th birthday. sEating was a reasonable 15-25 minutes. Initial server attention was timely and polite. It went down hill fast from there. It took at least 40 minutes for dinner to arrive when it did they served 3 out of the 4 of us and then the 4th the birthday girl got to wait another 10 minutes. Desert was the same story. They brought one ice cream and not the other 2. You can't wait with ice cream.  We had asked them to please lite a candle in my daughters ice cream. The wait was so long she went to the lady's room. Server came by and said I will leave this here and you can light it. she did remember when we were had through desert to ask if we needed it lit. We decline not to upset my daughter. The food was mediocre at best. how to you screw up angel hair pasta? It tasted and looked like it was sitting the entire forty minutes I we waited under a heat lamp then re microwaved. it was dry and stuck together. I am the person the always over tips. I have never complained to a server in my life but simply left a one dollar tip. We had been there about a year ago and all was different. Now it seams to be a swarm of 16 year olds having a night out. good thing as they aren't picky about service.
Tiffani V.,"Norfolk, VA",0,9,,4.0,10/4/2012,Service was great and the food was pretty good. The waitress was wonderful.
Jessica H.,"San Marcos, CA",137,9,,1.0,2/3/2012,"I have gone here twice (I didn't want to judge a place by only attending once) and both times the service was HORRIBLE!! We waited 10 minutes before somebody helped us, and that was only after complaining. The manager didn't offer any apologizes and the only think that stopped us from getting up and leaving without finishing our drinks was ONE nice waitress. BJ's will no longer be getting our business."
Veronica B.,"Poway, San Diego, CA",13,25,12,2.0,6/24/2014,"Tonight I visited Bjs. Usually the service is wonderful. But, our order was messed up. Server forgot about us. It took over 30 mins for two salads! Never got refills on drinks until we were done with dinner and paying. We go to this Bjs location quiet often... Very disappointed in tonight's service."
Steve S.,"Escondido, CA",0,6,,1.0,2/23/2013,"Noisy, cold food, they drown the grilled teriyaki chicken in sauce...oh they don't understand what a filet is supposed to be, they clear dirty plates but not crumbs form the table before they seat you. Higher quality meal at McD."
Angel N.,"San Marcos, CA",0,13,,4.0,9/24/2013,The little beer samples are great!  I've been there twice and have enjoyed the food and also the service.  The only reason I didn't give five stars is because the server was a little over the top with her winky face.
Marissa S.,"San Diego, CA",28,6,,2.0,11/17/2011,"I love the food but the service is horrible at this location. It never fails they always mess up my food, but at least they keep my drinks coming :-)"
Christina O.,"San Diego, CA",56,18,,3.0,5/23/2010,"I have been to two other BJ's Restaurants, both in Orange County and the service at those two was definitely better than the Escondido location. I'm not sure if the poor service was due to how busy the restaurant was or because the location had opened two days prior. Most likely it was a combination of both. The food was delicious and I especially liked their affordable lunch specials. Their downfall was the fact that they would not give my friend a free dessert for his birthday or sing to him. I do, however like the food and will return to see if the service has improved."
joel b.,"Escondido, CA",10,19,,3.0,10/10/2011,Ate there on Sat. night and had a fair experience. The wait was about 25 minutes but the food didn't take to long to get to us. The quality was fair and seemed mostly generic.
Andrea R.,"Escondido, CA",6,16,,4.0,4/25/2012,"I'm updating this to reflect our recent experiences with call ahead seating.  Don't do it.  It doesn't help anymore.  If the checkin area seems crowded when you walk in--you should probably just go somewhere else.  You will probably be quoted about 20 min of wait time and it will quite likely be at least 2X that.  I'm delighted that they are having such success, but wish they could make better use of check-in data to quote more accurate wait times."
Richrd G.,"San Diego, CA",0,13,,5.0,11/29/2012,"This place is always a good bet.  I go here quite often, and for te most part everything is great.  If it isn't they always make good and follow through.  Fun place to watch the game or go out for dinner or lunch.  Staff is very friendly."
Brandie N.,"Vista, CA",67,71,22,4.0,8/20/2011,"Everything is good here.  I've never ordered anything that didn't taste great....and I just recently FINALLY tried the Pizooki.  Dangerously yummy.  I like most all their beers also.  The only thing about this place thats not great is that they don't take reservations.  If you have a big party, it's best to do the 30 minute call ahead thing and have someone go save the table for you."
Jaclyn P.,"San Marcos, CA",13,45,9,3.0,8/6/2011,The food is awesome. Beer selection is ok. Wait time for food is always soooooooooo long. Everytime we have been to either this one or the Carlsbad one. Not good to go if you are starving.
Nina F.,"San Diego, CA",343,20,14,3.0,2/13/2014,"I've been to BJs 3 times in my life & 2 of those times were at this location. My first time I came to celebrate a good friend's birthday. I wasn't too hungry so I ordered the Ahi Poke which was really good. I took bites of the stuffed mushrooms, the jalapeño burger & a few others. Everything was delish! I came here as our 2nd choice restaurant for a quick late dinner after shopping at North County Fair (there was a 40 minute wait at Cheesecake Factory). This time I ordered the Brewhouse Burger with bacon, cheese & avocado plus the Crispy Calamari as an appetizer. I don't know why I ordered such basic stuff there when I can get that anywhere but that's what I craved; a nice juicy burger. Calamari came out, eh, it was ok, not the greatest but not the best either. Burger came out a minute later & that was ok too. Thin slices of avocado; not sure if/how much I was charged for that but I was expecting thicker chunks (I love avocado!). Beef wasn't that juicy & the seasoned fries that came with my meal were dry & lacked flavor. They tasted like they were fried earlier that day & then been re-fried to be warmed up. Not cool. McDonald's has fresher fries & burgers which is sad. I took a bite of my boyfriend's roast beef dip & the au jus was okay, nothing to write home about. Overall, dinner was alright. I think out server was Chris (I think that's his name) & he was really nice. He kept checking in & filling up out drinks (I hate when I have to ask for my water to be filled because servers don't check up on customers).  With all that said, I wish I did go to The Cheesecake Factory but I'm pretty sure I'll be back at BJ's again for another bday or something. I can't expect too much for the prices, right? LOL"
Sarah L.,"San Marcos, CA",120,62,89,1.0,4/10/2011,"DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION.  I have given them so many chances to improve, and nothing has gotten better. (This review is in regards to their services, not their food.)  I have gone about five times, and only two of those times were acceptable.  All of my bad experiences happened at nighttime.   First off, the wait is ridiculous.  Their table turnover sucks, because they put too many seats and they dont have enough servers.  Secondly, their servers are a hit or miss.  They are either very friendly and eager to help you, or very indifferent and seem to care less. Many different servers come to bring food and drinks, and they forget things like forks and plates.  You have to work so hard to get their attention just for a fork to start eating. Last night I went with a group of four, and their extremely bad service drew the line.  Our server was nice, but it seemed he was too busy for us.  But when he wasn't busy, he would stare at us and zip right past  us.  It took about three tries of waving him down for him to take our order. When the food came out, a couple of different servers took out each entree at different intervals of time, making me hungry because mine was last. At the end, he overcharged us for my pasta, and it took a total of 20 minutes for him just to change it. During this time of supposedly ""waiting for his manager to approve"" his mistake, he ignored us and waited on others, instead of refilling our root beer or giving us boxes, which took another three attempts at getting his attention.  After he finally came back with the revised check, he brought back a small to go bowl of tomato bisque, as an apology....-__-.  A PITY BISQUE??? No thanks. This location has been opened for a while, and I thought this was enough time to get their act together. I will now drive out of my way to the other location next time I crave a pizookie.    I think I am overcritical because I am a server, too."
Robb A.,"San Diego, CA",12,77,8,4.0,1/28/2012,"I always have a awesome time that I go here . Buffalo chicken pizza, a few beers and a puzkie makes me a happy camper. One of my favorite meals.  Everything looks so good on the menu . I've only had the pizza and really enjoyed it."
Jake V.,"San Diego, CA",3,8,3,5.0,6/26/2012,"I feel strangely conflicted about this restaurant.  I kept waiting to be disappointed, due to the bunch of one-star reviews I'd seen, but I never was.  My only criticism (and it's very minor) is that we didn't have any silverware on our table when we came in.  But the whole rest of the experience was perfect! I stopped in here on Saturday after visiting the Wild Animal Park, and it was pretty slow.  Of course it was 4:00 in the afternoon, so I wasn't too surprised.  That said, the service was excellent!  I know lots of people have complained about the service, and maybe we were just lucky, but I was impressed by the attention and care shown to us.  We were there with a couple small children, and they brought us crayons, oyster crackers, goldfish crackers, and kids cups, without barely a word.  Very thoughtful! As none of us were very hungry, we didn't order entrees or appetizers, but were intrigued by the variety of soups they offered.  So one of our party asked if there was a soup/salad buffet on the menu, and our server immediately said, ""Well, there is, but it's a lunch special, and we don't offer those on the weekends... but I can make it happen for you.""  So awesome! So yeah, we all had soup and salad.  The house salad was a house salad... nothing special.  The dressing was good, the lettuce crisp... what else do you want?  I ordered the Cherry soda, and was very happy with it.  Plus free refills!  Excellent!  After one glass of the Black Cherry, though, I wanted to try the Orange Cream.  It was just okay, the Cherry was definitely better, IMO... The soups, on the other hand... Amazing!  The clam chowder was one of the best clam chowders I've ever had!  Thick, Rich, Clammy!  Yumm!!!  The tortilla soup was also excellent!  Very good flavors, nice chunks of chicken, I wanted to just put it in a glass and drink it down.  Plus I'm a sucker for fresh avocado, which was part of the presentation of the tortilla soup.  EXCELLENT! As we finished up, I started getting past the ""full"" feeling, and belatedly asked our waiter if he could get me another bowl of clam chowder (it was THAT good), and he apologized, saying that he had just closed our ticket and our bill, and there was no way for him to ring it in.  I told him never mind, that it was okay, but he told me to hold on a minute.  Sure enough, a couple minutes later, he brought me more!  Awesome!  He got an extra big tip for that!"
