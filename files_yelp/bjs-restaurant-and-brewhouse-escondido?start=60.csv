Kristen W.,"San Marcos, CA",0,31,,5.0,1/15/2017,"On January 10, 2017 my daughter and I went to BJs for dinner after shopping at the North County Mall.  We were fortunate to have a very friendly and courteous waiter, Jenavie.  She was very professional when taking our dinner order.  I ordered the Late Night Burger which was the BEST.  I also ordered my burger with no bun and no fries due to my low carb diet.  Jenavie went above and beyond.  She took it upon herself to offer me a small salad to go with my meal.  Must restaurants do not do that.  I want to recognize her for taking care of us and doing that little extra that will keep us coming back.  Thank you Jenavie for making our dinner and experience at BJs restaurant awesome.   Kristen Wilson."
Jeffrey J.,"Alexandria, VA",62,5,1,1.0,11/4/2017,"After calling in advance for my daughter's 11th birthday I restated to the ladies in the front it was was my daughter's birthday. When it came time for dessert I ordered a pizookie thinking it would come with the birthday celebration I asked for multiple times. It came and no celebration, no one even gave a shit, pretty sad. I just paid and left but it's sad that a kid whose favorite restaurant is BJs he's forgotten on her birthday. Pretty sad."
Drew M.,"Los Angeles, CA",119,212,71,4.0,12/20/2016,"Quick service, good food, lost a star because we had a new waitress who seemed a bit off.  She was nice, but didnt know the seasonal beer menu and wasn't as attentive as we had liked.  Overall good experience."
M. Angela C.,"San Diego, CA",0,8,,3.0,4/14/2017,I am completely aware that in the hospitality industry attractiveness is always a plus especially when you are the first face customers see when they walk in. Unfortunately sometimes attractiveness and professionalism don't always go hand in hand. We walked in on a Wednesday night after 8P to find five guys blocking the reception area and chatting it up with the pretty blonde hostess. We stood there for a few minutes thinking she would be professional enough to acknowledge us but that was not the case. Not until we actually step in front of one of the guys she was chatting with did she even bother looking in our direction.  The three stars are for our server Thomas. He was amazing and most importantly PROFESSIONAL even tho he was super busy he made time to ask how we were doing and that we had everything we ordered or needed.
Michelle S.,"San Marcos, CA",0,40,14,1.0,7/31/2017,"This place has a bad customer service ,they are slow ,hostess won't drop what their doing to greet the customers while chatting with the staff won't acknowledge us that we are there waiting for her to say something there it wasn't busy at all but there is like 5 to 6 group of people lining up.Been here in this location 4 times and we ended up getting disappointed that's why we go to carlsbad a lot . We always hunt down our waiter ."
Curtis F.,"Escondido, San Diego, CA",1,12,,1.0,7/26/2017,Here at BJ and the service is the worst I have ever seen. A few people from other table have gotten in the waiters face for the bad service. The big room in the back and only one waiter. WTH.
Paulette D.,"San Marcos, CA",136,29,34,4.0,12/3/2016,"Would have definitely left 5 stars but they lost my call in request and we waited longer than normal on a busy night.   Our waitress, Linda was fantastic.  She recommended menu selections and how to have them prepared with expertise.  Our mozzarella sticks and salad came out fast despite it being the first weekend of December and Christmas holiday shoppers.  But we waited for our meals longer. Everything was delicious except our asparagus was lack luster."
Ann H.,"Temecula, CA",0,55,14,1.0,12/17/2017,"My husband and I love BJs. Normally the food is tasty and the service is good. Today, however, we had one of the worst restaurant experiences ever and we will never return(to this location). Ordered a burger for me and a chicken sandwich for my husband. I always order my burgers plain. After waiting an excessive amount of time, I get my burger.. with everything on it. No problem, mistakes happen right?! Sent it back while my husband waits with his sandwich. Comes back and it was the same burger, the bottom bread was completely soggy and it tasted like lettuce.. onions all in the cheese! Seriously?! And after it was dropped off, we sat.. and sat and sat. Over 30 minutes go by and my husband has at this point eaten his sandwich and I have eaten a couple fries. No one ever comes back and my husband gets up to finally tell them we have had enough. I don't even want another burger, just to leave as quickly as possible. The waitress brings the check out and apologizes she forgot us. At least they take the burger off we didn't eat :/ We couldn't believe the horrible service we received, and no manager to apologize. Will definitely spread the word for people to avoid this place. Humiliating experience, NEVER AGAIN."
Chelsea D.,"Escondido, CA",0,4,,5.0,2/12/2017,"We come here every Sunday for their brunch. They have always been quick with seating and service while still making a personable experience. They always get the order and service just right. Never a glass that goes empty.  Natalie the waitress is the best waitress we have ever encountered and is so sweet and accommodating. Danny in the back who cooks the food is absolutely the best, my boyfriends order is pretty complicated and he nails it every time and it's always perfect."
Arnel D.,"San Diego, CA",1560,1907,6793,4.0,8/20/2015,The servers in the happy hour section are great! Drinks kept coming and I didn't have to say anything or nod.  The food was delicious and served at an excellent temperature - hot!  I'll be back for sure to unwind.
Clay C.,"Las Vegas, NV",8,47,,1.0,6/18/2017,"Really disappointed. If you like a long wait, poor service, and lower than average, pre-cooked food from a freezer, then this is your spot.  I'm not sure why I expected more from a chain restaurant, but for the prices they charge it should be better.  There is a reason millennials are killing chain restaurants by not going to them, this is a prime example of that. Total waste of money and time."
Cindy H.,"Azusa, CA",35,4,,4.0,8/3/2017,"Love BJ's, wish the prime rib was always available The food here is always amazing, the only thing that needs to be improved... Bathrooms are always  filthy in the trashcan in front of the main entrance and is overflowing onto the ground  every time I'm here"
Madison A.,"Murrieta, CA",150,1,,5.0,10/20/2017,"Absolutely can't desired the experience that I had. Fantastic. Amazing. Wow. I must say that I owe my good mood to the beautiful hostess at the front, Taylor. I believe she had locks in her hair and glasses. She warmed my heart with her big smile and upbeat personality. I wish she had been my server instead of just my host. Good job, BJ'S. You have a well seasoned crew, along with well seasoned food. Please let that girl Taylor know that she surely made my day."
Roland C.,"San Diego, CA",0,29,16,3.0,7/23/2017,"On our last visit we went on a Sunday and restaurant was half full....there were 6 in our party and service was incredibly slow... took almost 10 minutes to even be acknowledged and get waters.. There was plenty of staff around but for some reason the waiters and hostess were very inefficient about serving their respective tables.. Took another 15 minutes after we got water to get our food order placed and then over 30 mins to get our food to us.. again the restaurant was at around 50% capacity ...  As the food came around and we were eating my mother noticed how meager the Mahi mahi fish portions were in her fish tacos... probably total of two ounces if not less.. we made a comment to the waiter who acknowledged that it was not normally like that. The manager came around 10 mins later and was kind enough to remove it from the bill... What was most frustrating came when we asked for the check... I kid you not almost 20 mins came by and we still had not received it... I had to walk over to one of the computer stations  where orders are inputed and asked to pay immediately.. Ultimately we were there for 2 hours and it was not due to awesome conversation and great story telling , but due to abnormally long wait times... hopefully management will start to recognize this problem and address it accordingly"
Penelope F.,"San Marcos, CA",0,11,1,4.0,9/28/2017,"So this review is really just about the service. Anna was attentive and friendly, and definitely kept my daughter hydrated with instant refills on her soda. The food was meh, frankly, and a ""healthy"" fish dish my daughter chose was salty and bland, and the fish was tough. We didn't say anything, but Anna noticed it was hardly touched and took it off our bill! I used to love BJ's, but I think they're struggling with their menu. The service, however, was great! Thanks Anna!"
Azerone P.,"San Marcos, CA",584,79,46,5.0,10/3/2016,"My wife and I enjoy going here!! This is a great place to enjoy  conversation and  eat good food 1. Environment feel (nice) lots of seating, great mood lighting and music setting the tone just right  2. Customer love: the waiters and and waitresses are good  3. The food: great selection of classy American dishes. The brewhouse deluxe burger is my favorite  4. Would I come back ? Yes!!! Consistently a positive experience here  Tip; if you don't want to wait go to the bar area!!"
Daniel H.,"San Diego County, CA",103,29,15,2.0,5/15/2016,"The food here is good, as it should be because it's a chain resturaunt. The service on the other hand was abysmal. It seemed as though our table was invisible and was waited on by 2 different people. Our food came out in 40 minutes and no silverware or placemats were provided...   We tried flagging down our waiter but they were too busy with other tables. We definitely felt under appreciated here. Maybe takeout is the way to go here. Update: Gave this place another try and it looks as though it hasn't changed. Our waitress seemed very unattentive and never once checked in on us to see how our meals were. The bartender who brought out our drinks had to track down our waitress to let her know our order was wrong.  We came in on the Wednesday burger night and ordered 4 burgers. When asked how we wanted our burgers we requested 2 of them to be medium and the other 2 well done. All four came out burnt...the only time our waitress came by was to take plates without asking how our food was and was gone as quickly as she came. Looks like this locations BJ's doesn't value customer service from the experiences I've had here."
Roddy C.,"San Marcos, CA",0,1,,1.0,10/15/2017,Irresponsible manager and servers. Serving cold food after a 45 minute wait. Further lack of care in making us wait 15 minutes for the check.
Jazmin P.,"Oceanside, CA",39,143,271,5.0,3/13/2016,The salmon was cooked to perfection!!!! I love the quality & service always given here!! The beer is fantastic as well just an all around great restaurant to have a nice lunch. I absolutely enjoy my time here and so does my stomach !!
Mike M.,"San Marcos, CA",0,13,,2.0,7/17/2017,"We had made plans with big group of friends to have dinner here before a party, I ordered the gluten free pizza as it was only thing I knew on menu since it was my first time. Everyone's food was brought within 20 minutes but mine was delayed for over an hour to point where it was 5 minutes before leaving. They tried fixing the problem by saying the meal was on the house but it was still upsetting."
