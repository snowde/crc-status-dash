Courtney T.,"San Diego, CA",8,75,19,4.0,2/13/2012,"BJ's gets a 5 for food and drinks and a 3 for service, average rating of 4.  My husband loves their beers, and I love their sodas that they make there- what a delightful indulgence.  I have enjoyed everything we have ordered there except their chicken sliders, which were fatty and gross.  It just really appears they need to work a little harder on training their staff- they seem disorganized, frazzled, and not on top of things.  We will definitely be back, its just a crap shoot as to whether the service will be acceptable!"
Jackie E.,"San Diego, CA",78,276,125,5.0,10/22/2011,"It took me forever to figure out what I wanted to eat here because they have so much on their menu! Their avocado egg rolls were pretty good, but I like the ones at Cheesecake Factory better. But BJ's does have the best dessert: Pizookie! My favorite used to be the original chocolate chip pizookie, but now I love their red velvet and white chocolate chip pizookie too. Really good place to celebrate your birthday too... you get a birthday pizookie!"
NBoogie V.,"San Diego, CA",5,63,4,2.0,8/8/2011,"I like their pizza, and the pizookie is good. The service is consistent, but it is consistently sh*tty. 1 time I ordered a soup, and i never got it, while all my friends got their food, and the server never came back til everyone was done, and then I had to tell her I never got my soup. She didn't even notice. Service is really slow as well, and the beer is overpriced. $6.25 for a Guiness, psh like its straight from the taps of Ireland. Great beer list, but overpriced.  Though the service is bad, I still find myself coming here repeatedly because its open late and it beats going to Fridays or any other chain"
Holley L.,"Richmond, VA",122,142,134,3.0,7/12/2011,"The hawaiian pizza is my absolute favorite. The service is usually pretty slow here, even when it's not crowded. In retrospect ,the food is always worth the wait. Refills usually take forever too, I wish I had a full drink with the length of dinner. The prices are pretty good and if you have time to wait around for your food I would definitely recommend it because it is delicious. AND THE PAZOOKIE! BEST DESSERT OF MY LIFE. I don't know how they can make a cookie and ice cream so delicious, but it's incredible. I would go just for the pazooki, it's just that good :)."
Laura L.,"Ramona, CA",189,54,,2.0,1/2/2013,"I have come here a few times since my last review and the service was getting better so I decided to come here for New Years Eve.  It was just my friend and I and we sat in the bar area.  College Football was on so Happy Hour was going on when we got there.  The Happy Hour was $1 off cocktails and Mondays had Martini's for $5.  Our waiter, Zachary, greeted us and gave us menus.  I believe he also took our order but at one time he went on lunch and we had another waiter.  The other waiter was great and very attentive.  I wish I had remembered his name.  We got our bill at 11pm.  My friend had ordered two martinis.  The same kind.  One was charged the $5, for $5 Martini Mondays. and the other just had $1 off, which is the Happy Hour Special.  She told our Waiter that he rung it up wrong and that it should be $5 like the other one.  He said ""No, it's $1 Off"".  She said well you charged me $5 for the other one.  So then he decided to fix it.  He brings the Bill and even had said no rush and that we could still order.  It would have been really awesome to have ordered another drink but he never came back our table.  We were going to be there another hour.  I got thirsty and wanted some water and my friend's water glass was empty.  I saw the waiter with water to refill so I figured that I would ask for water when he came to refill her glass. He went to all the other tables (there were 3 others) but never came to ours.  So I went up the the bar to get water and my friend got her refill at the bar, also.  When the waiter came back out, the Bartender told him that we had wanted water and that he did not bring us any.  You would think he would have come over to apologize but he didn't.  We actually had filled out the credit card slips and they sat on our table for an hour. He only came back at closing to pick them up.  I was kinda appalled.  I would have ordered another drink and probably would have wanted to come back in the future.  But this experience has made me want to go other places.  Management really needs to read these reviews and do something about the service or they are just going to keep losing customers."
Rachel P.,"San Diego, CA",228,9,9,1.0,1/10/2013,"I live only 10 mins from this BJ's and have probably dined here over 30 times in my lifetime. The food is pretty good depending in what you order and their drinks are very good in my opinion. But the service??? That's where the rating has been lowered to 1 star. There is this blonde bar server with black rimmed glasses and she is the absolute rudest server I have ever encountered. Both my boyfriend and I are in the restaurant industry and you NEVER treat your guests in a rude manner EVER! Oh but it is probably not her fault... it is MANAGEMENT's fault. It is their job to manage and teach this staff which they have so clearly failed at doing. Obviously there are many low rated reviews all complaining about the service and nothing has improved. One time, we had this other blonde server and I swear she was on something. We had ordered dessert and she came back 15 mins later asking us if we wanted dessert.. wierd. She had givin us the wrong check and the wrong drink THREE TIMES! It was just ridiculous."
Yuki J.,"Escondido, CA",12,95,18,3.0,9/21/2011,"Its right in front of North. County mall, pretty good size restaurant.  We had wait 30 min for party of 2 on the weekend.  Make sure to tell them go easy on the sault on whatever you are ordering."
Anonymous A.,"Scripps Ranch, San Diego, CA",0,23,5,2.0,1/16/2014,The food is overpriced for what it is. I have yet to find an item worth its price or even going to this place. The pizza has no sauce and has too much bread. The baked potato had almost no toppings on it. I guess the cheese sticks were good but i can get those anywhere. The pizookies are their only savior.
J B.,"San Diego, CA",0,146,10,1.0,1/24/2013,"Forced to go here again to meet people... i got the mahi mahi, which was so dry and overcooked I couldn't eat it. I think they don't cook; they just warm things up in a microwave that were cooked somewhere else."
Mary M.,"Escondido, CA",2,5,,1.0,2/14/2011,"Horribly slow service. Even though it has a nice atmosphere and you would think kid friendly, it is always so frustrating when ever we go. It took 30 mins just to get our bill the last time. Not so good when you have two kids under 4. They need more servers."
Doug S.,"Escondido, CA",0,11,,1.0,8/14/2010,"My family and I were not aware of the call-ahead service.  Supposedly it is not a reservation, however if you call-ahead, you have priority over those who have been waiting.  It didn't seem fair, but that might have been that it was not explained to us.  We were 3rd on the waiting list, but six groups went before us... and we were finally ""next."" But another several parties were seated before us.  I inquired ""What the heck was goin' on???""  That's when it was explained.  Again, just didn't seem fair... after the fact. Finally after more than an hour, we are seated.  Waitress was nice and prompt... initially.  Took our drink orders.  The sodas and waters came relatively quickly.  The beer and the wine did not.  Frustrating after more than an hour wait.  What was more frustrating was the BJ's Pale Ale was not very impressive.  I guess I have gotten used to Stone's Pale Ale. My salad was served promptly, but without a place setting.  The runner who gave me my salad was asked for place settings.  Never came back with any.  By this time, we could not find our waitress with a geiger counter.  Finally she turned up and we asked AGAIN for place settings, which she got to us... but very slowly. I think there is too much on the menu.  They need to take some off because my food arrived cold and bland.  Considering I ordered the Cajun pasta... there was nothing Cajun about it.  My wife's pizza was small and cold.  KRAFT Macaroni & Cheese?!?!?!  That's bad enough, but when that comes cold too.  Couldn't believe it.  Crappy wait.  Crappy service.  Crappy food.  Crappy Beer.  I will never go back again."
M N.,"San Diego, CA",1,20,,1.0,8/24/2013,"My husband and I usually come here on Fridays to unwind from the busy week from work. Service and food has been always good; until last night. We had this waitress who was very loud and unprofessional. After dinner, my husband and I ordered dessert and asked for refills on water. Five minutes later, the waitress brings our waters and the check and informs us that we should be receiving our dessert shortly. Five minutes later, we received our dessert. A few minutes later, the waitress came by to check if everything was okay and asked if the check was ready for her, which we told her no. Typically, waiters and waitresses would tell us to take our time and whenever we are ready when they would give us the check. And also, the check is usually delivered after asking the customer if they need anything else and at the end of the meal. Finally, the waiter or waitress should not ask if the check is ready for them while the customers are still eating. That's a little rude, don't you think? The rating is not towards the restaurant, but towards the service we received last night."
Sabrina C.,"San Diego, CA",40,19,17,2.0,8/16/2013,"I always try to give places a few chances before writing a less than great review. I just don't get it with this place. It seems like they are chronically understaffed and you can definitely feel it as a customer. We've been about 5-7 times and every. single. time. the service is lackluster. One time we were sat at a table with no condiments or silverware and we had to ask for some when the server came back to check about how our food was. The food always takes what seems like an excessive amount of time. Other times the food runners would bring the wrong dishes, drinks go unfilled, missing silverware. On one visit, the manager was just strolling around while our credit card sat on the table for a good 20 minutes before the server came by to pick it up. That's been the only constant, waiting to close out. The last three times we have been there, I put my card out halfway through the meal before the check even comes because I don't want to be sitting forever after my meal. Last time the wrong beer was brought for my fiance by a runner, and the bartender came over and said ""wrong beer, bud"" and grabbed it away like my fiance had picked up the wrong one. On that same visit, the entrees came before the appetizers, and the pizza was undercooked. If I didn't like their small bites menu (fried artichokes...mmmmm) so much, we would never go back. I wish I could experience just one visit where nothing went wrong. Oh well, maybe I'll just do orders for pick up from now on."
Adam S.,"Poway, CA",54,136,43,4.0,4/19/2011,I have been to this location once in the past and had pretty craptastic service. I came here the other night with some friends and it was a much better experience. The service although still slightly slow was much better than last time. I ended up having the balsamic chicken and it was really good. I hadn't eaten all day so that couldn't have hurt. We ended up having two of the pazookies too and they were really tasty. I've never been good at math but Ice cream+giant cookie=delicious. This was a much better experience with service so perhaps they have upped their game. Food really is good too.
Sonny T.,"Grand Terrace, CA",0,17,,1.0,12/10/2011,"Ordered a vegetarian pizza - which is featured as a special & received a Mediterranean flat bread!  Asked for coffee, got it with NO sweetener!  Asked for a burger - never got ketchup!  Ordered a Santa Fe chicken salad - NO dressing!  The whole evening was a debacle!  Finally to make up for the poor service, the waitress offered complimentary dessert.  When it was time to get dessert, she limited the dessert selection to a small ""birthday"" sized one mouthful dessert! Never again!!!!"
Tom C.,"San Diego, CA",4,33,1,4.0,12/7/2013,On a rainy Saturday the kitchen was backed up but our server was very good at checking in with us. Really enjoyed the Chicken sandwich was so good!
Cortney P.,"San Diego, CA",104,16,18,5.0,7/16/2011,"Yummy food! I LOVE going to BJ's Brewery, it's the best in San Diego, in my opinion. My husband doesn't like it as much as I do, but I would recommend this to anyone, they have a great menu, and it's yummy!"
natasha k.,"San Diego, CA",8,136,2,2.0,7/14/2011,"Sorta disappointed. The waiter insulted my husband by saying he doesn't eat the Garden Burger but ""the girls here eat them"". I think the guy was on drugs... The shrimp scampi was tasteless and they put tomatoes on it after we had just said ""no tomatoes on salad"". My Chinese chicken salad was tasteless also, I had to add 2 extra dressings. The spinach artichoke dip was good and the pizzas looked good. The place was and always is packed so it seems like alot of people like it. Every plate is around $10-15 so for 2 people you're gonna spend $50 at least. We might go back and try something else....maybe"
Sara T.,"Escondido, CA",20,56,10,4.0,4/24/2011,"Had their Santa Fe Salad, and ugh, it was to die for! Definitely try it if you're craving a mexican dish with chicken and avocado! Food took about 10-15 minutes and was quick. Friendly waitresses. Our wait time for reservation was short maybe 10 minutes max. Was a bit noisy, but overall it was good service."
Nancy A.,"Poway, CA",7,12,,1.0,6/9/2010,"This was our first time to try this restaurant.  Our daughter's graduated from MS that day and we had a party of approx. 25 people.  I called a day ahead to let them know we were coming, was informed that there were no reservations available, but was advised to call the next day   so at 11am I called to tell them we would be there at 12:30 and our name was added.  Upon arriiving, I greeted the Host, who checked my name off and received my pager, was told the wait would be approx. 1/2 hr.  Great! After waiting an hour, the head Hostess came to me to tell me that she could sit us pretty soon, but would it be okay if we were at 2 tables - adults at 1, kids at the next.  No problem. We were finally seated!   A waiter(ress) arrived at each of our tables, took our drink orders, which arrived after waiting about 15 minutes with alot of confusion as to who got what.  But, none the less, we got our drinks.  We then ordered, kid table and adults.  I asked if we could put each of our kids on the parents tabs-to avoid confusion at the end-and was told that No, they could not do that, the system didn't work that way!  I was totally confused.  But, said Oh well, we would figure it out later.   The kids food arrived in a timely matter, the adults however  did not. After an hour of waiting, it was questioned to our waitress, what the hold up was and she informed us that she had just checked and that it would be out very soon.  Well-it wasn't, and she was not very pleasant to deal with.  We then spoke with the Manager, who explained to us that there was a ""situation"" that went on, but to be assured, that all is good now and we should be receiving our food quickly.  So, finally our meals started to arrive, at first a few salads came out, (which were not for us, but eventually they got it right), then the meals came out - ever so slowly!!!!!  We finally all had our meals- which were not worth waiting for!.  We questioned the head Hostess again about why such poor service and she had the nerve to say to us - ""well, what do you want me to do for you?  a song and dance!.  WOW!  I was shocked at such terrible customer service.  So, after complaining again, she then offered to me to put the kids on the appropriate adult's tab - which I had to decipher and give back to her.  Oh, almost forgot, before we even got our meals the waitress had the nerve to give all of us our bill!  I have never received the bill before the meal - that was a first!   So after waiting for her to change all of our bills - we had 5 families total - we waited another 20 minutes, she comes back all apologetic and announces that she has taken 25% off each of our tabs and also subtracted a meal for a few of us.   I have never experienced such poor poor customer service and will not be going back to this restaurant - ever!!!  There call ahead service is a joke, their customer service and wait staff are horrible.  One waitress even told us:  You think your table is having trouble, you should see what other tables are going thru! Yikes!!!"
