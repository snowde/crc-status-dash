Rita S.,"San Diego, CA",0,29,1,2.0,11/15/2010,"food is great!  SERVICE SUCKS!!! and the managers don't really care!  they have lines out the door...so if you don't come back, no loss!  A terrible way to run a business."
Veronica P.,"San Diego, CA",5,168,,2.0,6/26/2010,"I don't really like reviewing chain restaurants on Yelp because the food is almost always the same at chains. So i'll start off by saying, yes the food is good and yes its like any other BJs. Pizza, Pizookies and beer are all great! The reason i give 2 stars is the waiting and service at this place. The wait is ALWAYS long because well Escondido has very few big, popular restaurants so when one opens everyone swarms it at once so a table is difficult to get unless you go super early or eat at odd hours of the day. be prepared to wait 45 minutes or longer and getting a seat at the bar is very hit or miss. You basically have to be a lurker and wait for someone to get up.  If you really must have BJ's for some really odd reason in north county, drive far to go to one less crowded because this one just isn't worth it. Or get it to go and eat your pizza at home."
Jeff A.,"Valley Center, CA",0,6,1,1.0,1/17/2011,"Definitely not going back to this restaurant.  Both times that my family went to this restaurant, the service was horrible!   First visit - seated immediately, then waited 20 minutes for someone to take our order.  Appetizers were good, entres were average.   Second visit - We waited ten minutes to be seated (only five small tables were occupied for the entire restaurant), then waited 30 minutes for someone to show up take our order. That never happened, so we finally just walked out.  As we were leaving, we counted 10 waiters, waitresses, and hostesses standing around talking and not working!"
Bobby O.,"San Diego, CA",3,23,,2.0,10/27/2012,"I've been here a couple of times and was unimpressed. On the last time, I ordered a deep dish pizza. When I received it, it was cold in the middle. That's when I realized that it was not fresh made, but a frozen pizza that they just heated up. I don't go out to eat frozen food. From now on, I'll go somewhere where they make fresh food."
Autumn G.,"Escondido, CA",5,7,,4.0,5/29/2011,The Maui Glazed Pork Chop was awesome!!!
Quetzalcoatl O.,"Pacific Palisades, CA",9,29,3,4.0,2/25/2011,"BJ's has been fairly consistent with me, but judging by some other reviews they can have bad nights. The food is always good and it's great for casual beers and appetizers with a shared pizza. However, once they completely forgot our appetizer and by the time they noticed they were delivering our entrees. It was only one plate though so no big deal. Service has been generally fast for me too. I'll probably go back."
Fara Z.,"San Diego, CA",18,133,132,2.0,3/26/2010,"Great set-up inside...nice decor.. WAY TOO MANY EMPLOYEE'S WORKING!! It made me nervous just thinking about their PAYROLL. Lot's of nervous waiters/ waitresses.... managers seemed like pricks. Staff wasn't friendly to each other. Everyone seemed uptight. My friend left id at the car and tried some of my beer...( i mean just a SIP) and 4 employees came asking for IDENTIFICATION and even asked to set the drink ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TABLE, and clearly my friend looks at least 35!! Don't know if i'm going back when they open. Food wasn't even good for being FREE. They kept EYE-ING our table so much since that ""beer tasting incident"" I ended up just telling them to TAKE the damn half finished beer away from the table already! geeesh."
Chris J.,"San Diego, CA",0,7,,1.0,1/1/2014,"I went there New Years eve with my family. The service was fine, but the craft beer I ordered was flat and not at all cold. I asked for a different one which was ok, but had that keg taste that reminded me of my college days. I probably should have ordered the deep dish pizza, but I went on a diet and ordered the balsamic chicken dinner which sounded good on the menu.. it was terrible! The two chicken breasts were tiny - about a quarter inch at the thickest point and about four inches long...about three or four tiny bites each. Just tiny and because they grill them and overcooked them they were dry and tough to cut. Just pathetic. It comes with a dry scoop of mashed potatoes and mixed vegies. I would have sent it back but because I'd already complained about the beer I didn't want to ruin the dinner for my family. But this was amazingly bad for a chain to serve something so cheap and badly prepared. My family were not too excited about their dinners either. The ribs were fatty, and the mahi mahi was bland. If I had to go there again I'd only order the pizza."
Adam G.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",82,27,4,2.0,4/14/2011,I've been here a few times and have had the same problem as many other Yelpers Service that is BJs biggest problem the food here is great but on several occasions i have gotten appetizers after my meal has been brought out or just not at all also refill service has been beyond slow. again i want to say food here is great but your taking a gamble on service. car side to go is quick and the to go servers are pleasant
Mia R.,"Escondido, CA",22,52,1,5.0,7/13/2011,"So far, this has been the best restaurant in Escondido.  They offer a veggie burger and other foods such as appetizers and a personal pan pizza that actually accommodate vegetarians.  The service was fast and efficient, the food was good.  This has become my favorite place to go."
Jo C.,"San Diego, CA",5,10,,2.0,9/23/2011,"Our family with 4 adults and 3 children, dined here on a friday evening. The place is crowded and noisy. There seem to have  good number of servers around but very difficult to get their attention. Several small requests, like: ketchup: extra napkins; take out box, took repeated times to receive them. It took a very long time to get our food, at least 35 minutes, and the temperature of food served was at best warm/room temp.  The mediterranean pizza and the artichoke heart/spinach pizza were just ok. However, there are good choices on kid's menu and the orange juice is freshly squeezed, we believe."
Gayle C.,"Escondido, CA",78,102,,1.0,6/18/2010,"Underimpressed at best. Service very slow, even at 3Pm with the restaurant two thirds empty. The food was overpriced and not prepared well. I had fish n chips and the fish was greasy and almost burned. My husband had a pulled pork sandwich that was so full of sauce it fell apart as soon as he picked it up. Beer is overpriced as well, $6 for a 10 oz glass of beer, come on. I will not be going back for any reason."
Helen K.,"Fullerton, CA",8,60,,1.0,8/24/2010,"Wow, it's interesting to see that I'm not the only one that had such a horrible experience.  Bear with me and hear my tale... We've tried to go once before and the wait was way too long for us to dine here.  I've gone to BJ's out in Brea and Culver City, so I know it's pretty popular.  This one is Escondido is outrageous, it's always busy and parking is horrible. So, we went a few weeks ago at about 4:30pm, figuring a wait shouldn't exist or be that bad and even called ahead.  We had to wait about 5 minutes to be seated although it wasn't packed.  It's freezing inside, why is it always freezing in these places?  We ordered our drinks, salad (3 total), and main course. Our drinks arrive, ok.   One salad arrives.  We inform them we ordered three.  A bit over five minutes later a second salad arrives, we inform them we ordered three total.  The server that brought the second salad doesn't seem to be a total idiot and gets us the last salad within a few minutes. So then two main dishes come out, they announce the scampi pasta (my order) and put it in front of me and it's clearly some kind of rice dish, kung pao? sauteed vegetables?  I don't know.  All I know is that it's clearly not angel hair pasta.  Does the server not know what angel hair pasta looks like? Hmmm...  No refill on drinks offered.  They finally get my order and the pizza that was ordered comes out.  She tries to serve it but it doesn't seem like the kitchen sliced it.  She's struggling to slice and serve the pizza with the pie server thing.  Poor thing.  My father-in-law ordered the fish and chips, asking for the thin fries and gets the wedge cut. So we're finishing up our meals and my father-in-law orders a cup of coffee.  ""Sure"" she says.  Several minutes later, no coffee.  It's been some time since our server has checked on us.  No refills and no coffee... we are in no mans land, although we are fairly certain we are still visible.  Our server comes near our table and we flag her down.  We need a couple of boxes and we still haven't gotten the coffee yet.  I see her go to get boxes but they seem to be out at the serving station near us and she just ignores the fact that we seemed to ask for the boxes.  She seems to remember about the coffee and brings it but before it even leaves her serving tray, I notice the clear red lipstick sitting on the rim of the cup, looking like someone had just taken a nice sip after applying her (or his, not going to judge here) lipstick.  She apologizes profusely and leaves to get another cup.  Another cup of coffee arrives, she remembers she was supposed to get us boxes (which another server has refilled at the station) and we get the check.  I saw my father-in-law get out a credit card and think twice.  He took out some cash and we get out of there. There's a porter beer they serve there that we enjoy a lot, so we will likely go back to BJ's, just not the Escondido location.  I'm not sure if the staff is still green or what but the service was incredibly bad.  My father-in-law was pissed (he's the silent, I'm-going-to-kill-you-one-day kind of guy).  As we would only go there with them I seriously doubt we'll ever be there again. I gave the place, this particular location, one star.  It was impressive how bad the service was and it wasn't even that busy."
Lawrence F.,"Escondido, CA",0,21,,2.0,5/30/2012,The reviews I unfortunately read after eating there were right on the money about the service. I took 15-20 minutes for our waitress to come to the table for the first time. She was nice enough and didn't make up some BS excuse. She just forgot we were there. She also messed up 3 of the 5 orders. The food was ok. I will not return. If I want pizza I'll go to Pizza pie or Pizza Port.
Daniel N.,"Escondido, CA",58,108,36,4.0,4/2/2010,"For all the people that don't like the slow service, don't go on opening week. Yeah, the service was a little slow and the orders weren't right, but for opening week it is what you expect. Especially being as large of a place as it is. I am sure they will get their stuff in order as they figure out the system and figure out who is going to be keeping their jobs. Other than that, the food was good as always. The beer was good as always. I would say more TV's around the place would have been cool, but other than that this is definitely a new local favorite hang out."
Stephanie C.,"San Diego, CA",0,32,,4.0,5/5/2011,"We have been here about 5 times now, 3 eating in and 2 curbside takeaway.  The main reason we come back is for the Calamari appetizer.  We are on a hunt to find the best one in San Diego and have pretty much decided BJ""s takes the cake.  We get that everytime, sometimes 2 orders... As far as dining in experiences...well, I really love the decorations but the service leaves something to be desired.  This last time we went on a Tuesday evening around 6:30 and once we were seated we waited 20 mins for anyone to come and say hello.  Our server ended up doing a great job after the hiccup in the beginning but it seems as though this is becoming a trend here.  Hopefully their managment reads yelp and they will get on it.   At any rate, they have so much to choose from and everything is always very good and high quality.  We will keep coming back but most likely for take out...."
John S.,"San Diego, CA",33,9,4,4.0,2/21/2011,"Love this place!  The avocado egg rolls are to die for.  Great sandwiches and extensive selection of their own brews, outdoor patio dining and friendly service keep us coming back for more!!"
Marianne G.,"Escondido, CA",0,7,,1.0,9/10/2013,"Went to BJs the other night (it was late afternoon but dark when we finally left).  First we ordered a glass of their house Reisling only to be told they were out of it.  Seriously?  On a Saturday night?  Ok, well sometimes things happen, I guess.  So we order the Parmesan Crusted Chicken and sit for 30 minutes waiting for it.  When the server brings the dish, he puts down Chicken Parmesan.  When we pointed out that wasn't what we ordered, he assured us that it was.  Uh, no really, we ordered Parmesan Crusted Chicken.  He took it away and after a long delay without any acknowledgement from our server or anyone else for that matter, the correct dish showed up.  No apology, nothing.  We were very gracious and understanding so maybe it was felt since we weren't making a stink, we didn't need an apology or a offer to freshen up our drinks.    We won't be back, they really seem uninterested in keeping our business."
Caroline V.,"San Diego, CA",454,161,243,5.0,9/28/2010,"The past three times that I've been here, I've received exceptional service. Only because I've only sat in the bar. The servers were extremely nice and helpful. I always enjoy a few cocktails and order from the ""Small Bites"" menu. Tuesdays are great if you're in the mood for wine - they are all 50% off all bottles! Not sure if they do that by the glass. Great place to go after the mall. Cheers!"
Sarah W.,"San Diego, CA",137,153,,2.0,10/12/2010,"Oh-my-gosh this place is so overrated. Apparently BJ's is the new ""it"" place in North County because it's always completely packed. The food is really mediocre, people! The beers are ok, but I've had better...I'm just not thrilled by it! The wait is simply not worth it! Go to Red Robin and get youself some killer onion rings and burgers instead, you won't regret that!"
