drew B.,"Poway, CA",5,4,,3.0,8/23/2011,"I LOOOOVE the food at this restaurant! But....I had a bad experience sort of. I usually go to the La Mesa or UTC location which are great all around! The hostesses at the Esco location are a joke! Me and my boyfriend go in on a Sunday and there was only one party of 3 in front of us, no big deal we sat down and they didn't take our name since it wasn't busy. Well four small parties go in and get sat immediately while we're still sitting there. We were the only ones sitting in the lobby and there wasn't any reason for people to be sat in front of us. So I approach the desk asking if they forgot about us; they take us back right away with no A) explanation or B) apology. I thought it was so incredibly rude, thankfully our server was friendly and great and made up for the negligence up front."
Greg S.,"San Diego, CA",6,7,,1.0,8/13/2013,Don't bother calling ahead. They will lie to you about the wait time probably to make you spend time at the bar. And then the hostess will give you a hard time. Rude.
Anshel S.,"San Diego, CA",472,160,13,3.0,9/1/2010,"This place is just plain old mediocre. There's nothing about BJ's aside from their Pizookie that makes them worth visiting. The entire place is setup like a typical sports bar and really doesn't have much of a real identity. On top of that, the actual food wasn't that bad but it wasn't anything to write home about. I still don't understand how my friends were eventually stuck with a 40% tip during a birthday party... but that's the waitress'/computers' fault. She could have easily checked the checks to see if they were calculated correctly, but she didn't. Granted, she did warn us of something like this happening but she should've caught it before I had to call it out and say BS on some people having almost 3 dollar tips on 6 dollar pizookies."
Appolonia T.,"Escondido, CA",0,70,4,2.0,2/11/2011,"Poor BJ's. They try, they really do. I keep coming for the beer but the food is just not good. Their pizza is passable (but I'm from Chicago so I have high standards)...usually we just have a few beers, a meal and some apps.  And they always, always, ALWAYS get our order mixed up. We get other people's food, they get our food....oy. And look your food over very carefully before eating it, and that goes for your kids, too because you never know with this place. Kind of fun atmosphere, tolerant of kids...it's that kind of place. But I really wish they would do something about the service and quality of their food."
Landa S.,"Vista, CA",15,42,41,4.0,4/29/2010,"This location just opened up and it's pretty large. Our waiter was excellent and prompt. Today, we both ordered a teriaki dish-one with shrimp and the other with chicken. They were okay tasting, a bit heavy on the sauce. My favorites are their deep dish cheese pizza and, of course, the pizookie! Those things are amazing!"
Elaine L.,"Irvine, CA",22,91,7,2.0,9/7/2012,"I think this might be the LAST TIME I ever ever dine at BJ's. BJ's use to have good quality food, but something changed the last few times I've dined here. The portions seemed to have shrank a lot and they're even missing garnishes. I always order the avocado rolls, and I usually order the BBQ chicken pizza, but it was so disappointing last time that I decided to order some sliders instead. The avocado egg rolls were cut very poorly. Whoever cut it must not have been paying attention, half of the rolls were tiny bite sizes and the other half were three times the bite size. The avocado egg rolls seem to have shrank in size big time. The sliders were dry and overcooked. It lacked flavor and the beef was tiny. Our server seemed to have been missing a majority of the time. I use to frequent the BJ's in Irvine since it's close to my house, but I stopped going there because the food was flat out disappointing the last time I visited. This location seals the deal of NO more BJ's for me. So sad."
Andres F.,"San Diego, CA",14,23,,4.0,4/7/2010,"So this is the second BJ's I've been to and thus far can't complain too much. I'm giving four stars because THANK GOD there's a decent place to eat/drink after work since there's little to no good choices in RB near work. The Happy Hour is pretty good (3.75 house beers). I was there on opening day and yes, it was a madhouse, but what can you expect. After my first trip, I went back again this past week because the avocado egg rolls were calling me. The bartender told me it would be 45 minutes for some reason or another so it kinda sucked. However, the manager apologised and comped me on another app of my choice.  Now, I can see improvements coming service-wise and they could use MORE tv's if they want to attract sports fans. I'm interested to see what happens when the East Tavern bowling lanes open around the corner in the mall. The BEST part of this place I have to say are the PEOPLE I've met on my visits. Such nice folks and I've actually stayed longer chatting with them. This place is a welcome spot for me and I'll be going back for sure either with friends or alone. Got to have my egg roll fix afterall."
F S.,"San Marcos, CA",17,15,,5.0,6/4/2012,i think it was one of the best bbq chicken pizza's ive had in awhile. i know its hella bad for me with all the calories but fck it! pizzoookie was delicious too
Ryan B.,"San Diego, CA",0,14,,1.0,2/17/2013,"Over $30 for a mini pizza, small pizza, and a salad and my Sweet Pig arrives with deli ham on it and no sauce?  What gives!?!"
A P.,"Oceanside, CA",0,14,3,5.0,5/22/2011,One of the original spots to have a nice beer anytime :)
Richard L. D.,"Youngstown, OH",0,97,1,3.0,9/19/2010,This is another cookie cutter corporate brewery with all the same food and all the same bland beer line up as all the others.  It is staffed with clones and serves a purpose with it's happy hour from 3-7 with $1.00 off beer and half off apps.
Chad E.,"Hawthorne, CA",77,36,34,3.0,11/11/2010,"Big bag o' bar food and some decent dishes. Their ""home brewed"" beer is alright, nothing special. Their Pumpkin Ale (a seasonal special) was respectable but a little sweet. We do love their BJ's Special Deep Dish pizza. It keeps us coming back for more since we don't live in  Chicago where the original deep dish pizza reigns. The staff was good but the food service was slow as it was a busy night. 1/3 of the heaters were broken outside so it is a little chilly this time of year. I suggest inside as your food will stay warmer longer. The chocolate chip cookie w/ice cream dessert was done right, nice and gooey on the inside."
Byc M.,"San Jose, CA",132,51,1,4.0,1/8/2013,The lunch special is amazingly well priced for the amount of food you get. I'd give them 5 stars if they didn't run out of blackcherry soda half the time I go there.
Eden M.,"San Diego, CA",0,18,,1.0,9/23/2012,"what went wrong???!!!  I can't stand this location.  I used to go to one of the original BJs in Westwood LA by UCLA for years and it was terrific.  When I'd come to San Diego, I'd go to the one in La Jolla which was nice.  This place is aweful.  The service is terrible the 3 times I've been. I keep giving them chances but I'm disappointed every time.  The food is good but the wait is horrible.  I mean the wait to have someone actually serve you at the table.  The last time I went here last week, the guy finally decided to be friendly as well as offer a refill when it was tip time...how convenient.  The food is not worth the bad service and wait time. I had complained to the manager before and decided this time I would just go ahead and post a bad review."
Kelly F.,"San Diego, CA",1,3,,1.0,9/4/2011,"I have been to other BJs and they were great, but this place has some hastily thrown together food (even when it's not busy). Went here once, and the food was mediocre for everyone's meal so we tried it again, thinking it was just a one time thing...we were wrong. Our table ordered a deep dish veggie pizza (assuming it would be hard to mess up) but it turned out to be the worst pizza I've had at a restaurant. Seriously, dominos was better quality. When the pizza arrived I grabbed the spatula to take a piece and the pizza flopped over onto itself dumping all of the toppings onto the other side because it only had one diagnol cut splitting the pizza in half instead of slices. The waitress watched this and brought it back to actually have it cut correctly. When we began to eat, it was clear that they had baked the dough separately from the rest of the ""pizza"" because nothing stuck to the dough! The toppings had no sauce and hardly any cheese (which is why the toppings simply fell off when when you attempted to eat it). It was like eating a glob of greasy fry bread with an extremely salty salad on top. There were intermittent chunks of overpowering herbs and the veggies were pretty much raw... It was just plain gross. We came in around 1:30 with a very light lunch crowd so there was no excuse for our thrown together ""pizza"". Needless to say we are never coming back to this location."
Raquel M.,"Escondido, CA",1,13,,2.0,5/18/2011,"Unfortunately it was my pick for lunch with my son and his family for Mothers Day. We decided to go on Saturday instead to avoid the crowds. We got in with just a 10 min wait time, so far so good. We sat on the patio it was a pretty day.. two good things.... should have known better, my daughter in law ordered a ""new entree"" they are promoting on the menu... all it boiled down to was salad greens with sliced chicken on top... omg... you would have thought we ordered the colonels secret recipe.... the meal was never brought out.... 25 min later while everyone else around us was being served we were still waiting. Even the kids meals were missing. I finally asked the waitress what the hold up was and she said the ""new entree"" had been made TWICE and it had been made wrong both times... WTH? No explanation or regret from the manager, or waitress until we asked... not quite customer service etiquette. Not happy with the flagrant carelessness of a table of 5, we left there spending to much money, way to much time and not having a very happy mothers day experience at BJ's."
Christin K.,"Dallas, TX",9,84,42,2.0,4/7/2011,"This location has not been open long and I've been to other locations. I ordered a mini bbq chicken pizza and my buddy ordered a turkey burger. It took forever...the restaurant wasn't even busy. The service sucks the waitress didn't even ask once if the food was ok or if we needed a refill on drinks. At the same time, I noticed we were the only minority table she was serving. Hmm go figure ...not coming back to this location."
Aaron B.,"San Diego, CA",0,2,,5.0,5/27/2014,"I had to drag my girlfriend into BJs recently. It's not that she doesn't like the place. It's just that she usually has a headache or is tired or something whenever I want to go. So sometimes it takes a special occasion of some sort in order to convince her to accompany me. Last week it was my birthday. She asked me what I wanted to do. I said we have to go to BJs! After I said this, her eyes said no, but she could tell how excited I was about it and she knew she couldn't deny me this time. I actually can't remember the last time I went there even though she knows I frickin' love the place. In fact the last time I had been there may have been my birthday last year. Way too long! Anyway, I'll get down to the experience... I was blown away! Everything was moist and nothing took too long to come to the table. The only complaint, and this is just nitpicking, is that I think my girlfriend's food may have been a bit overdone because she complained about a sore jaw. But I had an amazing time! Keep up the good work BJs, I hope to come back soon! Though it probably won't be til' my birthday next year."
Liah W.,"Chicago, IL",0,7,,3.0,5/5/2014,"Normally my experience is pretty good but not this time. From the start it took a while for us to get our sodas. Two of the burgers didn't have thousand island sauce or onions like it was suppose to. The fish tacos we ordered weren't suppose to have onions and it had a ton of onions on it. I didn't enjoy the angel hair classico I got so I exchanged it for the flatbread pizza. It took FOREVER for me to get my flatbread. it took so long, I asked our waitress to put it in a to-go box because I wasn't even hungry anymore. And when I did get it, it tasted weird. Then we ordered two beignets to-go. Both came out and weren't in to-go containers. Also they weren't even beignets, they were cinnamon donuts. don't call something a beignet if that's not what it's going to be! Then we told the manager and the only thing he did was pay for the desserts. He should have done a lot more than that. Then at the end our waitress brought out a beignet to-go on the house. We didn't ask for that beignet. If we were going to have a free dessert we would have rather had a pizzoki. I definitely am going to think twice before going to BJ's again. I think I'll stick to the pizzokis there and that's about all."
Jennie C.,"San Diego, CA",9,143,72,3.0,10/24/2011,"Starting to like BJ's more and more. However, when I came here last weekened with my best friend for an after-work drink, nobody greeted us for about ten minutes. Then a hostess walks by and kindly asks what she can get us to drink. I just got a beer and a cup of soup because I wasn't feeling too well. My friend ordered their pumpkin ale, which was delicious by the way, and a caesar salad. Had a few good laughs and called it a night. Hope my next visit is worth four stars!"
