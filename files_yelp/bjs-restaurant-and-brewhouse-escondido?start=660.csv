Meena V.,"Pompano Beach, FL",3,25,,1.0,4/24/2011,"I ordered a BJ's cream soda - and it came with a piece of glass floating in it! I almost drank it, and was shocked at the poor quality control here... The manager was apologetic, but I'm staying away from BJ's!"
Purple E.,"San Marcos, CA",0,7,,2.0,6/24/2012,Poor service. Two meals delivered ten minutes apart. Canned tomatoes in dish. An extra meal added to bill. Took ten more minutes to fix it. Hostess didn't seem to care when I told her. Saw our waitress Lindsey hugging a patron when we left.
maggie b.,"Escondido, CA",0,22,1,5.0,6/14/2010,"This restaurant gives you really fair prices and a ton of choices. Something for everyone. You can eat inside, in the bar or on the patio outside (which has heaters). The wait staff knows the menu inside and out and are extremely friendly. The pizza is outrageously delicious. I had one thing that I did not love and that was a pasta dish. All other items were amazing. If you have kids or are a kid at heart, try their homemade cream soda. I really appreciate their new snack items, smaller portions which start at 2.99."
Kevin C.,"Vista, CA",0,5,,1.0,3/16/2014,"I've been to other BJ's locations before, this visit did not measure up.  We went for lunch with some friends on a Sunday afternoon and ended up wishing that we had not recommended BJ's as a place to meet.  When we arrived it took about 30 minutes to get seated, which is reasonable.  However, once we were seated we did not see any food for almost an hour, not even the appetizer.  Once the appetizer arrived it was not even what we ordered, we were told that what we ordered was not available at the moment so they brought us a substitute.  about 15 minutes after that our food arrived, at least 3 out of 5 orders.  Apparently two of the orders were dropped in the kitchen.  After all of that, the food was just not very good.  The hand tossed pizza was floppy and fell apart, the deep dish was just a ball of grease, and our daughters fries and tenders were cold and dry.  The one thing that I was looking forward to was the pizookie, but after all of that I didn't order desert.  I just didn't have the time. Unfortunately it just seemed that the place was not being managed very well at all.  The only reason I'm giving a star is because the manager did check on us and was very apologetic for the service.  She ended up comping us on a few items which did take out a bit of the sting.  She even offered a gift card but we had already decided that we would not be coming back, at least not to that location."
Giselle E.,"San Diego, CA",0,17,,4.0,12/17/2010,"Alright. It's been 6 months, and I told myself to give this place some time to get into the groove of things and give it another chance. We have visited here several times since June 2010, and it's gotten much better. For the most part, the service has improved. It's still super crowded, but now if you call ahead, your wait time is actually closer to 5 minutes than 30 minutes. Food is always good.  I use BJ's to cater a few client lunches, and everyone loves it! My favorite dish is the Santa Fe Salad with Blackened Salmon (the salmon is always cooked just right).  My favorite pizzas are the Cheeseburger Pizza and the Artichoke/Spinach.  Make sure that if you order takeout, call your order in, and try to avoid online ordering.  It's faster if you call them directly.  Curbside service rocks!"
Steve B.,"Diamond Bar, CA",19,99,35,1.0,7/5/2010,Very horrible service. Waiter didn't even apologize or acted like he cared. Recommend that you stay away. Other yelpers are rating this place 2 stars or less as well.
Ming T.,"San Diego, CA",2,19,2,2.0,5/22/2010,"Great bar area with enormous TV screens, but no Padres game, and no Golf Channel?  Ridiculous.  Service was average, nice atmosphere, food was decent but if I'm going to shell out $9 for appetizers, I'd like to be able to watch the game.  I won't be back --- can find any number of alternatives for an overall better experience."
Nicole P.,"San Diego, CA",121,155,223,3.0,1/1/2011,"I would give this restaurant a higher rating for the good food but the service was pretty bad. When our server came to our table she looked a little depressed. We exchanged ""how are yous"" and she stated that she has been better and that she was having a bad day. So after that, service became terrible. She forgot some of our drinks and refilled our sodas with water, among other things. We started to think that she tells everyone she is having a bad day so that people could feel sorry for her or maybe she just sucks at being a server so she has to make up an excuse. Yes that was mean. But in my opinion, you need to suck it up and do your job and try your hardest to push through. Seeing her depressed made us depressed. But other than that, the food was pretty good. We had the southwestern pizza, broccoli cheddar soup, and pulled pork sandwich. Everything was delicious. Hopefully our service will be better when we come back."
So Cal Sweetie S.,"San Diego, CA",6,84,,3.0,1/11/2011,"The food was good. I came here for the first time today with a friend. We both got lunch specials, but they came out at different times. The place was busy since we came around one. Prices were good for the lunch specials. Service was slow. It took 20 minutes to get the check and change. Overall, the food was pretty good, so I would go back if I was in the area."
Sarah T.,"San Marcos, CA",0,1,,5.0,5/15/2011,"Ok Ok, I get it we have all had bad experiences at BJs Escondido. I have always enjoyed the food but the service was lacking. That is until last night! I came in with a party of 12 late night and was amazed by the great service. Our server Samantha was very attentive and helpful. The servers seemed to be working very well together as a team as I noticed the two other servers bringing our drinks to help our server. The food came out quick and perfect. I have come to expect bad service from BJs, but apparenty not from Samantha. After some casual conversation I learned that she has worked at other locations, maybe that was it, maybe Escondido just can't get it right so they need people from other locations, either way I will always ask for Samantha or simply not dine there!"
Nick M.,"Escondido, CA",0,8,,2.0,4/20/2011,"I've been there several times, and no matter how much I want to, I just can't get excited about the food. I have not really noticed the service issues noted by others, but the food just doesn't rise above average for me. The only way I can describe it is that it lacks any excitement. There's no obvious ""signature"" taste to it that is uniquely BJs. I've also noticed it arrives a bit cooler than I'd like. I've had similar quality dishes at Centre City Cafe. It's an interesting place to go, with all the noise and visual stimuli, and it's great for sporting events, but the food doesn't draw me there. I don't have them on my ""must visit"" list."
Chris I.,"Poway, CA",0,50,9,2.0,9/6/2010,Good service. Average food and drink.  We were served sub potato skins. The pizza was a bigger version of a Di'Giornos frozen pizza.  Beer and mixed cocktail was unremarkable.  Curiosity is bringing folks to wait for over an hour.  Too high of a price but the big crowd and long wait shows there is demand for places like this.  Too bad the food is not very good.
Jennifer S.,"Escondido, CA",61,38,5,1.0,8/7/2012,"I went to BJ's on Saturday evening. We were a party of 8. We asked for 1st available seating. We waited about 30 minutes. The table was still dirty when they seated us. They wiped it as we stood there waiting. Our drinks took forever to come, and our waitress ended shift mid order and we had a new waiter. He was nice. I have food allergies and was very specific about my order. Dressing on the side, add a side of BBQ sauce. The order came and the side of dressing was missing as was the BBQ sauce. Frustrating. My son also wanted extra dressing and they only brought one, gave it to my son, then later after I asked AGAIN brought mine. My chicken in my cesar salad was undercooked and slimy. I asked for new chicken. Some of the lettuce in the bottom of my bowl looked like black slime. It was just so gross. The place is noisy, the waiters are pleasant but forgetful, and the lemonade tasted very acidic like a sour drink mix. Nasty. Their chicken is very moist, still bordering on slimy even well done. It seemed very fatty. Not a very good experience."
Corrie T.,"San Diego, CA",0,1,,3.0,8/15/2010,"My family and I have eaten at BJ's twice with completely different experiences.  This location has great ambience along with a large variety of beers to choose from.  The potential to be an enjoyable experience every time should be the management's goal in order to retain and build their clientele.  Our experience at the bar was what I expect: fast, friendly service along with good food and drinks.  Our experience in the restaurant was not the same: first of all, it took almost an hour to get a table even though I phoned ahead by forty minutes.  That would have been acceptable except for the slow service that we had in the dining area.  Drinks were ordered and after 30 minutes we had to ask another person for assistance.  The management was polite, and we hope they can remedy the existing personnel problems.  I definitely WOULD go back to try again.  BJ's, how about taking reservations for all sizes of parties??"
