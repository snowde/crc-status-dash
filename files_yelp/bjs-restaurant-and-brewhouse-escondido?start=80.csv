Courtney S.,"Carlsbad, CA",1,15,2,2.0,6/23/2017,"Sadly, Tuesday night was the 3rd time I have found hair in my food at this BJ's location. This last one was a long black hair baked into our pazookie... I will not be returning. This was the 3rd and final straw. The worst part about this BJ's too is that they don't ever even seem concerned that there is hair in the food. They are just like ""oh okay"" I mean come on.. kind of sounds like it is a reoccurring theme."
Breanne M.,"San Diego, CA",133,254,316,5.0,7/24/2015,"I always love BJs! Their small bites are my favorite.  I recently tried the PB&J pazookie and it was pretty good - they're were whole peanuts in the peanut butter cookie. Some of my faves there are: ahi poke, fried artichokes, stuffed mushrooms, and motzerella/tomato salad."
Jenelyn H.,"San Diego, CA",270,472,489,5.0,4/8/2017,"I love BJs! my husband & I go here once in a while for date night, Just post up at the bar order food and grab a cheesecake across the street for dessert. I like their beers! I usually get the girly fruity one which is always pink. Can't think of the name currently & my husband usually goes with a lager or an IPA. On all of the occasions we were here I am almost positive we get the calamari since its so crispy. Maybe not my favorite place to get calamari But I like quality and quantity and here it is just right. One time we ordered the fried potato skins and that was pretty awesome since I never had them here before and they were so delicious I almost passed out. I am all about textures and I remember these still to this day because as soon as the plate arrived I thought they were burned they looked a little darker than what I am used to with potato skins. They are very hearty and bigger than what I am used to also. But when I took that first bite my eyes grew wide and my husband and I smiled at each other like little kids. I wanted to order another order but I could already feel the Jiggle coming along. I definitely recommend this place because the bartenders are good at serving you food & drinks but at the same time allowing you to get your space and give you time to enjoy the food and relax. Will definitely be back within the month."
Tina C.,"San Marcos, CA",84,77,238,5.0,2/26/2017,We come here regularly. I'm not a fan of the food but the drinks are great. The bartender Christian is normally our server/bartender. He always nice and fast with our orders. He makes our dining experience worth the night.
Ben S.,"San Marcos, CA",40,28,,3.0,9/16/2017,I usually give it better reviews. It was good but the deep dish pizza isn't really deep dish. It's a thick crust in a pan. Not deep dish like Chicago
Peter C.,"San Diego, CA",0,7,5,5.0,6/29/2017,"Had lunch here close to two dozen times in the last two years and have to complement the high standards the manager maintains for everything that leaves the kitchen. For appetizers I recommend the potstickers but skip the fried avocado roll. Potstickers are actually fresher and tastier than even the most expensive Chinese restaurants in North County. The chicken avocado club is generous and delicious and a value at $11 and you can substitute any salad for the fries. Weekdays, BJ's brand beers are only $3.95 and there are at least 8 choices. Not many places have pints of beer for less than four bucks anymore. The Thursday special of a full slab of baby back ribs with three sides and dessert is a real deal at $18.95! Really can't see why some people complain when all you have to do is mention you're not happy with something and they couldn't be nicer about fixing it 100%. This place blows away the category of Friday's and 's and Macaroni Grill. Better selection, better quality and really friendly waitstaff."
K L.,"Escondido, CA",0,31,5,3.0,5/14/2017,"We've had great servers the last two times here.  But the hostesses have hosed us twice now.  The first time, they said they put our name in for a 30 min wait... 45 min later they said they never had our name.  This time she put 4 down instead of 5 then tried to sit us at a booth at a bar, which is small and just wouldn't work.  I asked about a big booth I saw open and she was snarky and tried to say it was for a group of 6.  We finally sat at a bigger booth next to that empty one which they sat a party of 4 after us and who got service before us.  We sat there over 10 min before we could grab someone and ask who our server was.  We can be patient but our 2yo is not.  The hostess intentionally sat us at a table without an assigned server.  The old manager finally stepped up to take our table and her service was fantastic.  Food came out fast and was pretty good."
Nica A.,"National City, CA",214,10,,3.0,5/31/2017,GREAT FOOD ! Loved the deals they have everyday. Pazookie was good as always. BUT they chefs need to double check our burgers & steaks were cooked all the way. I didn't bother eating my burger after I bit into it once because I seen red on my meat. Sorry I like my meat all the way cooked.
Daphne L.,"San Diego, CA",1382,1153,1103,4.0,1/8/2016,"For a chain, the food is pretty good and the service is decent. We stopped by for their lunch specials today after a morning of shopping and the place was pretty packed for weekday lunch. I ordered the unlimited soup and salad and my husband ordered the fried chicken lunch special. The food was good and did not disappoint! Parking is always ample on the weekdays but on the weekends in this mall plaza, it gets packed and parking is hard to find so be weary. For under $9 a person, you can get a decent sit-down lunch! I highly recommend!"
Honey C.,"Hemet, CA",1,11,2,5.0,5/26/2017,"It was our first time visiting this location a couple of weeks ago and Lauren was our server. She is super friendly and also an amazing server! We come back because of her customer service and also the food, but more because of her :) thanks girl!!"
David W.,"Fullerton, CA",0,21,3,5.0,5/25/2017,"Baby back ribs deal on Thurs was awesome. Our waitress, Getowa, provided beyond excellent service!"
Barb G.,"San Pedro, CA",0,20,,3.0,9/6/2017,Service is generally good. Food and drink quality is inconsistent with dinners usually being better.
Sierra G.,"San Diego, CA",115,100,181,5.0,8/14/2016,"I've always been a fan of BJ'S and didn't realize they are in California! They have a good happy hour, which is even offered on Fridays until 7pm. I wanted something off of the lunch menu, and they gave it to me without hesitation or an up-charge. I tried two different beers, both good and the waiter knew a lot about their house brewed beers. I would highly recommend this location!"
Ray E.,"Oceanside, CA",31,82,41,5.0,9/8/2016,"Really have enjoyed this place over the years and find myself at this place often with clients for lunch along with happy hour in the afternoon. Food is always top notch with a vast selection of choices which usually I do not prefer a large selection as it sometimes reflects in the quality but not in this case. Service is always top notch here as well, occasionally you get brand new servers and such but the mainstay staff are extremely accommodating. Location choice and parking is wonderful along with the interior decoration.  Seating can handle any size group which is a big plus to their layout as there is really no bad seat in the restaurant. Pricing is fair and a really good deal on specials and happy hour.  I am drinking a four dollar Hopstorm for lunch as I write this review right now. This company sets the standard in chain restaurants in my opinion and there are very few that can compare on the same level as I am NOT a chain fan."
James N.,"Orange, CA",322,4,1,1.0,7/16/2016,"Got here two hours ago with my wife and three kids. 30 minutes to be seated, which is fine -- it's a Saturday night. No big deal.  What SUCKS is that the drinks were wrong, the food was wrong, and all of it was late. They put the food down and we didn't even eat. I told the manager what had happened and this was his fix: ""Do you want to take the [incorrectly made and not hot] food home in a bag?"" Worst. BJ's. Ever.  Oh, and by the by: this was my seven-year-olds birthday dinner. Way to drop the ball BIG TIME, BJ's."
Donald C.,"San Marcos, CA",0,4,1,2.0,5/2/2017,"Service is super slow and the food quality has gone down. Had the Jambalaya, I know why do I order the Jambalaya, it had two small shrimp. Very small. Do not recommend, go to cheese cake factory and wait the hour to get a seat."
Charles J.,"Escondido, CA",38,12,3,2.0,10/4/2016,"We used to come here all the time, but last night we looked at our ""bj points"" and determined it had been eleven months since our last visit.  Why you ask? Because there is never a meal here where something doesn't go wrong, usually multiple things. This time we waited and waited for our waitress. When she arrived she was friendly and apologized. She was nice, made good suggestions, and we accepted her apology. But, the thing that really went wrong was the beer. That's what BJs is known for, their beer, if they're gong to get something right, it's the beer. I came specifically to have their Oktoberfest beer. Guess what? They're out.  It's October freaking third, and you're out of Oktoberfest beer? I'm tired of being disappointed by this place. They're going on the black list."
Sandi P.,"Central Escondido, Escondido, CA",52,1,,2.0,9/21/2017,"My boyfriend ordered takeout for me and when we got home, the kitchen had missed half the sandwich and sides. It ended up be bread with meat and fries, nothing else. It was very disappointing considering the price."
Donna R.,"Valley Center, CA",0,6,5,4.0,4/29/2017,"Costumer service and Managerial ethics are great!!! Anyway, we were planning to have early dinner one Monday night because they had a promotion. Unfortunately, the server spilled the water on our table. I was soaking wet and my baby got grumpy and upset. She was screaming and crying so my husband got embarrassed and was upset too because we could not stop her from crying so he went out with her. I stayed with Grandma and my 6 year old daughter still on the table drench with water.  The server comes back and wiped my iPad and our table and immediately offered us to move to another booth. I went to the bathroom and cleaned up and dried my pants. It has been awhile that we were there because my husband wouldn't come in because the baby got really fussy. We don't know if we wanted to order or what are we going to do since My pants  still wet.  Finally the manager came and talked to us. Even if we had a rough hour, he still managed to be nice to us and said that our dinner is on him. So we thanked him and everntually my husband went inside with the baby. However when we sat her down she right away cried again. So then we all decided to go., but wait there's more offer. The manager was so nice and humble that he GAVE US 2 GIFT CERTIFICATE with no expiration.  Yes, that night was a mess for us but turned out they were very hospitable and generous."
Anjana S.,"Vista, CA",5,21,,3.0,4/10/2017,"Ordered a Mandarin Green iced tea, server came back to inform me that it was being brewed.  She did bring me a glass of iced water.  I had finished my water and half of my lunch before my tea arrived.  I paid $2.95 for that drink...I didn't even have a refill...too full and done with meal.  Also there was some confusion when I ordered the buffalo chicken grilled cheese.  Maybe just my eyes, did not see any fine print about make it a meal for $1.00 more (fries & drink) supposedly only during the week. We were there Sunday.  Food was good, tea was okay service was friendly and adequate but not great.  Signed up for the rewards...couldn't figure out how to get my free pizzookie...oh well."
