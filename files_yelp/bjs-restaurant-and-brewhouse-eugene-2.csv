Stacey P.,"Eugene, OR",9,6,,5.0,1/10/2018,"Amazing food especially the Monkey Bread! Customer service was great as well. TY for making my monthly date night with my daughter a success! Happy Mom, Stacey :)"
Brandi I.,"South Pasadena, CA",93,326,801,3.0,1/4/2018,"The food was good and the service was good too.  Parking is easy because the restaurant is in the mall parking lot.  It's a good place to get a drink and watch the game, any game, all the games.  It's a little cold inside which is no fun when it's already cold outside.  It's a pretty big restaurant so not much in the way of waiting which is nice."
Eric C.,"Eugene, OR",32,61,31,1.0,12/18/2017,"We had 2 different groups go to BJ's for work party/rewards dinners in 2 different nights. 1st party half of the people were done eating as the food was arriving for the rest and they were out of their pazookies.  2nd Dinner, they came back after ordering to tell us that they were out of prime rib. When they brought out food they had no idea who got what. One guy got a side of steak because they couldn't figure out where it went.  I ordered the fish and chip, because who can screw that up right? Well, mine had a green marble sitting right in the middle of the plate. No, seriously, a full sized marble. Now a hair or even the tip of a thumb I get (disgusting but I'd get). What is going on in their kitchen that it's even possible for there to be a marble in on my plate. (Photo of marble attached) They guy asked me if I wanted it remade. This is a real question? Really? Anyways, the fries were soggy and the fish was not good. When your company (that for some god forsaken reason keeps ordering from your restaurant regularly) comes in and spends $1000 on dinner for your group (a second time) you think they could get it together but apparently not.  The food was mediocre at best, overpriced and their in-house beers are pretty gross. Not a place to waste your money."
Chrystal O.,"Eugene, OR",25,132,38,1.0,12/1/2017,"Received our order and 1 entree, side salad and the topping for a dessert were missing from the order. So I could not eat, its taken about 2 hours since I ordered to resolve this. An appetizer we received was burnt to a crisp and inedible. Would not recommend."
Jordyn G.,"Eugene, OR",171,66,2,5.0,12/28/2017,Had awesome service and great food! The menu is huge! With options from tacos to pizza to pasta you can't go wrong with this place. Their happy hour is great! 6 dollar burger and fry! And get a cheap beer from their own brewery! I loved their triple berry cider. I'll be back time and time again! Thanks BJ's!
Ashton P.,"Saratoga Springs, UT",204,186,196,4.0,10/28/2017,"Who doesn't live a good BJs.  We were able to park and be seated very easily. Our server was amazing.  He was very informative and helpful.  I ordered the Prime Rib dinner.  Talk about a ton of food. It came with soup, salad, mash potatoes, the delicious prime rib, AND dessert.   We will be back"
Jake G.,"Eugene, OR",25,31,,3.0,12/14/2017,"There were several things to like about BJ's.  First, I liked the atmosphere.  It's a large restaurant, but the lighting and the intimacy of the booths makes it feel cozy.  At the same time, it also have the feel of a restaurant from a different time - I can't quite put my finger on it, but I liked it. The service was good and the staff were attentive without being overbearing.  We did have to wait quite a long time for our food and dessert, but it was rather busy. The food was acceptable but not extraordinary.  I might even call it ""reliable"" in that I suspect it tastes exactly the same at every location.  That can, however, be a good thing! I ordered the BBQ Smoked Brisket Burger.  The patty was a bit overdone and the bacon quite underdone.  However, the brisket and BBQ sauce were good.  I did order it without onions and it came, you guessed it, with onions.  They were quick to take it back and return with the correct order.  The fries were especially good. We finished with a pizookie which, like the rest of the food, was adequate.  It was big enough to share and a fine finish to the meal. All in all, I'd go back if someone I was with specifically requested it, but might not suggest it on my own."
Jill L.,"Central Point, OR",7,2,,5.0,1/5/2018,What a fantastic experience I just had with my daughter.  Our waitress recommended the meat piadiana.  It was an excellent recommendation.  Portions are large and so many fries!  Brian made us feel like his own family.  Thank you for a wonderful lunch and Madison will keep us coming back for more.
Jason C.,"Eugene, OR",17,54,,1.0,12/20/2017,"My partner was served a raw burger. The server handled the situation professionally, but it is hard to even think about coming back. Traumatic..."
S F.,"Seal Rock, OR",0,12,16,3.0,9/29/2017,"Stopped at the bar to wait for my friends.   The barkeep was friendly and helpful,  providing me tips to the specials and offering a beverage recommendation.    Had the Ace pineapple cider.  Cool, crisp, and delicious.   Moved to a table later and again experienced excellent service.  The apps were nothing special but well priced.   We had the avocado egg rolls and artichoke dip. Very nice space.  High ceilings and cozy lighting.   I enjoyed my time at BJ'S -   Thanks to the wonderful staff and the company of my friends."
Jake C.,"Junction City, OR",6,90,8,5.0,4/20/2017,"I went to BJ's for the first time with a few co-workers last night. It was very busy when we arrived, but thankfully, we used the BJ's app to get on the waiting list as we left work and we only had to wait a few moments to be seated by the time we arrived. Austin was our server and he was awesome. He was very helpful in choosing drinks and knew all about them. We got them very quickly. In the meantime, I got a good look a the menu. BJ's menu is huge. Much bigger than I anticipated. I am known for being a particularly picky eater, mostly because I don't like cheese or bacon. So many dishes don't really work for me because a regular hamburger is ""elevated"" with cheese and bacon and ends up costing more and I don't want either of those items. Not to worry, as there were items on every single page that I saw that sounded really good. From some seafood, to special salads, tacos, burgers, ribs, steak -- BJ's has an excellent selection even for pickier eaters such as myself. I should mention that some of the prices were a little steep in my opinion; the jumbalaya looked good and I've never had anything like it before, but it was $18.25 and there was a picture of it and the portion didn't look large enough to justify the price. So be aware that you will be plopping down some serious dough more often than not while you are here. My co-workers and I started with the calamari appetizer and it was very good. Normally they taste like whatever they were fried in, but they had their own unique flavor that wasn't too fishy and wasn't too fried. I ended up with a fried jalapeno burger with some different sauces (I told them no pepperjack cheese) and endless fries. On Thursdays this was only $10 which is a good price. The burger was fantastic and cooked exactly as I asked (well done). The fries were seasoned well and were not overpowered. I'm not much of an alcohol drinker, but BJ's has a very large selection and was able to make me something I could drink. I actually tried on of my co-worker's strawberry drinks and even though it had twice the alcohol in it, I could barely taste it. That works for me as drink that is too strong isn't very good in my opinion. Austin checked on us several times, took our glasses and trays, and got refills. Even though it was busy we were checked on several times. He even suggested a particular dessert and although we were all full, we were convinced we had to try the pazookis (or however that is spelled). They were also very good and the 3-piece platter worked perfectly for the 4 of us. All in all, I would absolutely go back to BJ's. The ambience is nice, there are lots of televisions so I could watch the playoff basketball and hockey, Austin was awesome, the food was fantastic and there are a lot of dishes that I need to get back in there and try. Just be aware that you are going to pay a pretty penny as BJ's clearly markets itself as a bit more upscale. I thought it was worth the price, but the expense may keep some people from going there more often. Personally, I will definitely be back."
Erin J.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,5,,3.0,12/17/2017,"I don't know why I keep giving this place a try. Tonight was my third time after 2 previous lukewarm experiences. After waiting 30 minutes to get a table, the table hasn't been wiped and there is lettuce on my seat as well as the previous patron's check. Ok- stuff happens. I order the bacon cheeseburger and my bacon is completely cold. The knife that came wrapped in a napkin had crusted on food. I have just had consistently poor experiences here and won't be back."
Mike S.,"Eugene, OR",6,5,,2.0,12/18/2017,"The service at BJ's seems to have gone downhill.   I ordered a bowl of soup and salad.    The soup was a thin layer of soup in a platter (at most a cup of soup), and the salad was forgotten and had to be requested twice.  The bar was backed up, and my beer came late in the meal."
Paula L.,"Salem, OR",3,60,,3.0,6/13/2017,The staff there are always very kind and accommodating. I've been here several times. The food is okay. You get what you pay for here. The service is usually pretty fast. The drinks are okay as well. There's been several times that someone I've been with has had to send back food because the order was wrong. The pizookies are worth the trip though. So delicious! Overall I would recommend for big groups because there is a big menu and everyone can get something they like.
Scotty S.,"Monroe, OR",0,13,,4.0,10/21/2017,"I thoroughly enjoy the atmosphere here. We've even had to wait a while (45 minutes or so) for a table but it was no problem. We were escorted to the bar area and had a few drinks, enjoyed the game on TV and then when we got to the table, our server had our refills waiting! Tried the crispy calamari appetizer, it was amazingly well put together and fairly priced."
Marr B.,"Eugene, OR",46,4,,5.0,10/24/2017,I have always gotten great food and service.  Not sure why anyone would give anything less than 5 stars here.  I frequent this place at least once a month.
Lexi A.,"Eugene, OR",32,3,4,5.0,10/10/2017,"It was awesome. Food was great, staff was nice, building was clean. Didn't have to wait long at all. It is a bit spendy, but I definitely recommend it! My server was Ryan and he was EXCELLENT!"
Shari P.,"Eugene, OR",89,98,97,2.0,4/11/2017,Really bad service tonight. Took our friend out for her 21st birthday. 10 people. Took 30 minutes to get a shot once ordered. Longer for food. Checks were all wrong. Waiter forgot he took someone credit card. Not a great birthday experience.
Trevor D.,"Medford, OR",30,11,,4.0,12/4/2017,"A huge variety of options from deep dish pizza, to burgers, to steak, you name it. Better than many other franchise restaurants. Deep dish pizza is the way to go if you aren't sure what to get."
Stephanie M.,"Eugene, OR",457,136,366,4.0,7/29/2016,"Alright then... its a chain.  You already should know about it.  If you don't then go there already.  Stop being afraid of chains.  Chain restaurants just mean that they have great consistency across the locations.  This is a VERY clean and fairly large location.   I love BJs for many reasons -- I love their Cider.  I love love love their Peach Berry Iced Tea (yes I get like 6 refills when I go).  Full bar though so get what you want.  Burgers are good.  Entrees are good.  Pizza is good -- I love the white pizzas and the triple pepperoni...  Apps are good -- boneless wings are great and cooked perfectly. Love their lettuce wraps as well.   Drinks are good.  Desserts are good -- I don't do desserts but the mini pizookie is good if you just want a little something.  The regular pizookies I would have to share... VERY SWEET -- my fave is white chocolate macadamia.  Fries -- fries are the SKINNY fries that I simply adore if you like them.  They have good lunch specials -- I love unlimited Soup and Salad, or baked potato with soup or salad.   Wedge salad is YUMMY... it is a side salad don't expect entree size.  Tom/Mozz salad is my FAVE -- so freaking yummy Cheddar Broccoli soup is awesome... as is the tortilla soup.  If you can get Megan to serve you at this location get her -- she is simply fantastic!!!!"
Sarah R.,"Eugene, OR",170,17,2,5.0,8/31/2017,I love coming in and sitting in Megan's section. She always give the best service and has the best recommendations.
Bob K.,"Springfield, OR",0,7,,5.0,2/13/2017,"I am not usually a fan of chain restaurants. Bj's is the exception. Consistently good food, pleasant service, and an extensive beer selection.  Bj's brews an excellent wheat beer that is the best wheat beer I have enjoyed outside of Germany. My wife likes the Lightswitch lager.  There's an exception to everything, Bj's restaurant and bar is our chain restaurant exception."
David L.,"Florence, OR",0,13,,5.0,11/11/2017,"The best bowl of clam chowder that I have had in a long, long time.  I live in Florence where chowder is king and this chowder puts the rest to shame."
Robert W.,"Joshua Tree, CA",65,27,3,5.0,11/10/2017,"I am convinced that it is not the delicious beer talking,  this place is pretty awesome,  with very well prepared and tasty food  (note the dollar signs, but worth the 25 dollars a plate) excellent service,  professional yet homey atmosphere. I can recommend the beer, the steaks, the jambalaya."
Steve H.,"Eugene, OR",92,23,,5.0,8/12/2017,We had good food. Ribs and parmesan chicken. Excellent service from Magan.  She was fun and talkative.
Britton L.,"Springfield, OR",6,38,8,4.0,7/22/2017,"New menu is great! Staff professional, quick, upbeat and aware! Even when it's busy! Restrooms a bit unattended to, but again busy restaurant and it was at 6pm.. So, I understand. Bar and restaurant area clean, great tv's, nicely displayed bar and Air Conditioning!!!  How great is that when temp are high 90s! TY!"
Tori K.,"Eugene, OR",38,143,54,4.0,7/22/2015,"My husband and I went to BJ's for the first time earlier this week. The parking lot is large which is greatly appreciated. The restaurant is clean, well kept, and has fresh decor. The staff is friendly and checked on us often. (Though I wish they'd give us a bit more time to work through the huge menu!) To drink I had the delicious pear cider and my husband had the Long Island iced tea.  To eat I had the shrimp scampi. For the price, I was not a fan. I understand that it was a ""light blend"" but It seriously lacked flavor. I tried to give it more flavor adding pepper and Parmesan cheese that was at the table but it still just didn't cut it. My husband had a small BJ's favorite deep dish pizza. It was the perfect portion and he definitely left full and satisfied. I had a bite of a slice and I thought it was delicious.  Even though I wasn't blown away by the scampi I will definitely be going back and trying different things on the menu, or just stick with the pizza!"
Naima L.,"Eugene, OR",22,25,8,5.0,5/1/2017,"I work across the street from this place so I come here out of convenience and because I enjoy it. Their rewards program is superb and has many offers that allows me to try new things. They have an extensive menu and many choices for all dietary needs or restrictions. The ambiance of this place is great. Eugene needed  a monstrous restaurant in their vicinity. The relocation was an excellent move. Last time I was here, I tried their new prime rib In honor of National Prime Rib day. It was absolutely flawless. A perfect medium rare with a delicious  seasoned crust. I shared it with my dining mate and we were both stuffed beyond reason. It comes with 2 sides, a salad or soup, and a pizookie for $27. Prefect for sharing or for leftovers.  I could go on about the restaurant and it's food but I just say the best part about this restaurant is their staff. Stephanie F., the server, is exquisite; always going above and beyond to enhance my experience. She is so good at anticipating needs and remaining efficient and helpful. Alisa in the bar really knows her stuff and is always so kind, cordial, and efficient that being said, amongst all the wait staff and bartenders I've never had a poor experience."
Common S.,"San Francisco, CA",0,7,1,5.0,3/13/2017,"A pleasant surprise from a ""corporate"" eatery.   Excellent selection of food; haven't been disappointed yet.  The selection of on-site brewed beer makes the meal (and a good selection of wines too). Outstanding service from wait-staff; pleasant, uncrowded seating.  The place is always packed for dinner on the weekend, so you know it has to be good."
Toni O.,"Ewa Beach, HI",95,31,16,5.0,1/2/2017,"Excellent service, great atmosphere, and great food!  The clam chowder was the best I've had in my life!"
Jim M.,"Eugene, OR",0,25,1,1.0,4/9/2017,"To BJ's Manager: You reiterated to me on the phone that your salad comes ""prewashed"" in the bag and you are not changing your policy as it's clean and you'd be wasting water.  Anyone in the real restaurant business knows you need to wash all lettuce (just ask Chipotle) and your ignorance is appalling.  I will never eat at BJ's but to help protect the pour souls that still eat there please reconsider your insane policy to not wash your bagged lettuce (and be indignant about it).  This article was released 4/8/2017 ""(CNN)Two people were recommended for post-exposure rabies treatment after a consumer in Florida reported finding a dead bat in a packaged salad mix, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Saturday. The bat was sent to the CDC after it was found in a bag of Fresh Express Organic Marketside Spring Mix. ""The deteriorated condition of the bat did not allow for CDC to definitively rule out whether this bat had rabies,"" the Atlanta-based agency said."""
Jennifer B.,"Eugene, OR",95,29,11,1.0,9/24/2017,"My husband and I usually don't eat at chain restaurants for many reasons and this one hit them all on the head; so I figured I'd do a review to let you all know what some of you might be in for. We were here for a friends birthday, which is the only reason we would have eaten here anyway. I started off with a cider on tap, which ended up tasting like a Shirley Temple. Next, we ordered the honey, siracha brussels sprouts which were beyond burned and were flakey leaves, practically like burnt kale chips. We couldn't taste the honey or the sriracha. Our friends tried a bite and agreed. My husband ordered the superfood salad and it was a bunch of kale leaves with maybe some chopped apples and a few blueberries. Not much else, and defiantly not filling. We kept seeing all these huge salads coming by and that just made it all the worse. I ordered the ""enlightened"" barbacoa  cauliflower tacos on pita bread. Last I checked, pita bread isn't the size of street tacos, so each taco was the size of my fist and had cold, shredded cheese on it. The grains that came with it where also cold. My friend's birthday dessert  was so tiny that everybody felt embarrassed to even try a bite of it and she said that they ordered that dessert not too long ago and it was much bigger. This meal was pretty uninspired and left us hungry and disappointed. Everything coming out to around $50 too... This place is not worth the time, money or recognition. The only redeeming quality was the waiter."
Marissa B.,"Eugene, OR",0,18,,5.0,10/17/2017,A family favorite! I love the skinny margaritas. Great menu with decent prices. Their kids meals are perfect and make life easier! The take out service is always great and if their is a problem they go above and beyond to make it right!
Kevin S.,"Portland, OR",0,8,,2.0,3/11/2017,Simply mediocre. overpriced. typical chain restaurant. Applebee's? Chile's Fridays shiitty overpriced American food.  Go local eat real fresh food.
Steve W.,"Midtown West, Manhattan, NY",0,3,,2.0,8/26/2017,I hate to rant on them. I usually like it here. We waited for a long time and were not seated. They had many empty tables. They kept shining us on with the busser will get a table ready any second. Twenty minutes later we went to another restuarant.  It was 230 pm. No lunchtime rush.
Eric T.,"Eugene, OR",42,42,6,4.0,8/7/2016,"Look.  I admit it.  I have a bias.  I am not a fan of chains. Something gets lost on me as the passion of food gets pushed aside for expanding a business.  My hang up. That said, while all though they have a super huge menu which usually means, in my experience, lots of mediocrity as the only way to stock such a vast menu is to use lots of processed, frozen, or canned foods, they execute better than average. But that is not why I am compelled to review. It's the service! Service is a barren wasteland in Oregon and these guys are the oasis. Especially the ladies in the bar...well, maybe only them because I only sit in that area, but I assume the rest are good too! I am never disappointed by the food, but I am always happy with the service."
Melissa A.,"La Quinta, CA",56,140,79,4.0,10/16/2016,Always love coming to BJ's... they have lots of TVs for sports viewing and great food! My go to favorites are blackened Cesar salad and of course the peanut butter Smores pazzuki...Service is always great and the food is pretty consistent no matter which BJ's you go to....would highly recommend for good food and good fun!
Erica W.,"Springfield, OR",4930,491,3840,1.0,1/5/2016,"My husband and I went in last week. It was quite busy, given it was a Friday night. We had to wait about 20 minutes. The hostess seemed nice and helpful.  For appetizers, we had the lettuce wraps. Stick to the ones at P.F. Chang's. These were simply a pathetic knockoff that didn't copy it well at all. I had the Parmesan chicken and my husband had the jambalaya. My chicken had a weird balsamic vinegar taste that just got stronger as I ate it. The mashed potatoes had a sour taste (I didn't even know that was possible) to it. My husband liked his food. It seemed more edible than mine, except it had a very strong fishy smell to it, which nauseated me. We both had sodas to drink.  The service was atrocious. Our waitress didn't seem like she really cared to be there, and neither did any of the other wait staff. I've never experienced service that bad. She never picked up a single plate or glass up off our table until the end. We had a long rectangular appetizer plate, two small appetizer plates, two entree plates and five glasses clogging up our table by the time we were done. We had to ask for refills on drinks. The one single time she asked if my husband needed a refill, she completely ignored my empty glass. I had to flag her down every time we needed something. The staff appeared to be extremely apathetic. Every single person who worked there walked into the room we were in and looked around, but couldn't be bothered to acknowledge the growing number of plates we sat at the edge of our table, or notice we were scrunched into the corner of our booth trying desperately to find room enough to eat comfortably without knocking all the plates and glasses off the table.  I got up while being bored waiting to be seated to use the restroom and every waitress who was serving as I walked through almost ran me down in the walkway. One almost elbowed me in the face and had a nasty attitude, acting like I had no right to walk through to use the restroom. They all had bad attitudes.  Needless to say, she didn't get a tip and I will never be going back again. I had hoped it would be a much better experience than that, but sadly it wasn't and I won't be going again."
Kristin C.,"Springfield, OR",138,77,34,4.0,4/28/2015,"BJs won me back over! We had a team lunch with several people eating on special diets, and BJs was our option today. In reviewing the menu online I saw the dietary restrictions menu they had- that really gives this place tons of extra brownie points back. It was nice to see the common allergens included in each dish laid out so nicely. Kudos BJ for making this so easy for people who need to/ are avoiding sulfites, soy, wheat, milk, eggs, nuts, fish etc. So much stuff hidden in food it's not easy to always tell- so thank you! The waitress was very kind and accommodating to the special diets ( I was one this time), and had no issues with taking the order or answering questions. The food came out cooked well and tasty. Definitely an improvement over my last visit!"
Indya B.,"Eugene, OR",54,5,3,3.0,3/28/2017,"We celebrated my son's 14th birthday here, per his request.  The service was sub-par, albeit friendly.  They did not clear any dishes in between course which limited space on the table...The complimentary pizzooki for the birthday guy was a hit...yummy!"
