Barney P.,"Eugene, OR",176,34,,2.0,9/16/2015,"So here I am at BJ's again.  Grant it, the manager did send me a $25 gift card for the last poor service experience, although I have yet to use it because I need to print it off. Any ol who,,  came to get a quick bite to eat and grab some dinner. Went to the bar thinking it would be quicker service.  The ""bartender"" or young girl they put behind the bar had absolutely no interest in actually helping customers.  She spent the entire time gossiping with co workers and ignoring customers. Even though there was only 3 other customers at the bar.  I tried getting her attention to get a drink and she literally stood a foot away from me just staring off into space. I had to wave my hand and she said, ""did u want to order something?""  No, I'm here for the great movies!  Seriously?   Ordered drink and she dropped it in front of me and wondered off to go chit chat with more co workers.  Oiee.   I did order dinner.  I requested the chicken breast, but it had been so long since she came around I forgot which one, she just remained silent as I searched menu.  I tried to get some water which I got after dinner was half way done.   So are my expectations to high?   The beer I ordered was gross, had to sips and got charged.  Not , ""how was that beer I suggested for you?""   Another customer had a problem with his beer and she just stared at the glass like it was going to magically get better.  I know this sounds like the snarky eugene Snoots who slam everyone and everything!  I'm really easy going and patient.   Really unfortunate because I just live down the street and would be on here a whole lot more if I even got average service."
Fred C.,"Monroe, OR",0,14,,4.0,8/31/2016,"Would've been 5 stars, but our wait was a bit long, considering the number of customers was not high by any standards. It was spendy, but I'd pay the price again for the quality of food and service, post waiting for a table of course. We ordered the crispy calamari to start our meal. It was cooked/fried up right! Fully flavored as well, and the sauces were very good compliments to the dish. My main course was a pulled pork sandwich and fries. The pork was tender and well cooked with plenty of its own flavor. Although the sauce made a mess, it was a scrumptious addition to the meat. The wedge cut fries were a good choice, flavorful and not overly seasoned. To drink, I wanted to try their Tatonka Stout ale. I'm not usually a drinker of dark ale, but it's balance and flavor was very nice. Perfect for a hot/humid day! My wife ordered a salad that had chicken and lots of other goodies. I can't speak much on it, but she said it was very good. I tried a bite of the chicken, it had good flavor and texture. All in all, a good experience and a great meal! We'll be going back!"
Colin C.,"Eugene, OR",14,3,1,5.0,10/21/2015,Great lunch today at BJ's with my friend D'arcy Martin. Our wait person Jocelyn let us know about a great program they're sponsoring NOKID HUNGRY. What a fantastic idea
B G.,"Eugene, OR",5,44,69,4.0,11/14/2015,"It was a great evening. Everyone seem to like their food. The chicken Parmesan was so delicious... My kiddo had the cheese pizza that he loved! (I don't like cheese pizza but this was really good); hubs had the bison burger that he liked... The appetizers (sorry I can't remember what it was). Everyone one was happy with their food (can't remember the rest, I think there was a blackened salmon, steak etc). All in all we had a great evening with great people."
Kyle R.,"Salem, OR",33,1020,240,1.0,5/5/2014,"Our server, Casey, was EXCELLENT.  Atmosphere?  Excellent.  So why in the heck 1 star?????  The food was horrible.  Our bill was $89 for THREE people too boot!  We ordered two deep dish pizzas.  Mine was mainly just extra cheese -- and my hubby's was BJ's favorite or something.  His was SOOOO dry and tasteless.  My pizza was inedible due to the cheese.  Worst cheese I've ever tasted in my life.  And the pizza was beyond undercooked and super doughy.  UGH.  Casey said the clam chowder was great, but my hubby and mom compared it to Red Robin's.  Nothing great.  We got their spinach and artichoke dip appetizer.  The spinach dip was SOOOOO bland with NO TASTE.  I have no clue how I got myself to ante up the $89 bill + tip = $105!!!!!  Oh lord.  Very nice atmosphere and service though.  It was busy yet our food arrived super duper fast.  Maybe that explains my doughy pizza."
Randall B.,"Lincoln City, OR",2,14,15,3.0,1/1/2015,"Actually excellent bar food, although I did find it on the heavy side. Trends to sit in your stomach for hours. The service is slow although they are nice, the servers do not help one another. Team work is not,a priority. Prices are average, we ordered Cadillac margaritas were on the weak externally sweet side."
Cody F.,"Bend, OR",1,8,,3.0,2/3/2016,"Servers a great and place is nice, my wife and I just don't like the beer they have all that much. They need some better beer on tap for sure and I hate to say it because we really like the place but whenever we start going there we end up heading somewhere else because we want a good beer with our meal. Just not used to being away from bend I guess."
Erin J.,"Seattle, WA",58,204,234,3.0,7/1/2014,"My family and I went for lunch one afternoon, and, not wanting to wait for 20 minutes for a seat in the regular seats, we chose to sit in the (rather uncomfortable) bar seats. Even then, our server took forever just to take our drink orders, and taking our food order/bringing it out took even longer. The food was lackluster... not terrible (though my chicken sandwich was a little drier than I would have liked it), but not anything fantastic either. The prices are pretty reasonable though. Overall, a mediocre experience. If you're here to sit in the bar and catch a game, you'll probably be more satisfied with your experience than if you're just going for lunch."
Colleen F.,"Albany, OR",5,48,5,4.0,10/29/2015,"BJ's I want to love you!  We eat here whenever we're at the VRC mall (from Albany).  Usually we're there during mid-afternoon...most of the time there are very few people in the restaurant...so why are shown to a tiny booth?  There regular-sized booths everywhere!  I mean this happens every time.  Why??  Today the host took us to the very end of the row of the tiny booths, which is next to the bathroom and it's a half booth with a chair on one-side and the booth on the other.  Seriously,  no one else was seated in that section, so why??  We're well-dressed and are good tippers and I don't understand. Love the food, so this makes me sad."
Richard B.,"Eugene, OR",0,54,,3.0,5/21/2014,"Mostly typical american fare with a Chilis feel to it, kinda expected more pizza selection considering the theme. I ordered calamari and chicken quesadilla (seperately). Calamari came with 2 sauces both good but the calamari was bland without them, then the quesadillas came out (too soon) so I began on them, also good though the chicken was a little chewey. When I finished the main course I tried the calamari app again and it was cold and gross so I ate 2 of the three chips that came with the entree and they were a bit stale. I'll try them again to be fair but they need some fine tuning. Also when I asked about the entree coming too soon they said the computer automatically fires entrees 5 min after apps are ordered so it was out of her control. Pigs eat apps in 5 min, people should have the freedom to take their time. Like I said, some fine tuning."
Janet G.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,274,,3.0,10/18/2015,I would give more stars but every time we eat at BJs the food is always good but the servers need to have a training meeting. They need to be told to clean the table as the dishes empty. They .always leave the appetizer plates on the table when the entry arrives. Then they bring the bill crowd it onto the table. And we are always at the small table for two. So please have a meeting with your servers.
James C.,"Eugene, OR",143,199,109,5.0,8/29/2015,"Had a great meal here the other day. Ordered the Mahi Mahi tacos and they came out perfect. Nothing else could have hit the spot better. Oh, don't forget the sweet and tangy Orange Twist to drink. That sealed the deal for me along with the excellent service even though we had a waiter in training."
Margaret B.,"Saint Louis, MO",282,20,,3.0,9/24/2015,"Pretty good, can't complain. But nothing super spectacular. Definitely would recommend, but just as an average place."
Tammy G.,"Eugene, OR",52,40,466,4.0,3/31/2014,"Sit in Marshall's section, have a tall Jeremiah Red, eat some calamari and leave with a smile."
Kjersten H.,"Eugene, OR",173,6,,1.0,1/29/2016,"Service was terrible, the server messed up my order and it came out 10 minutes after the rest of my party. When my Parmesan chicken finally came it was cold and the mashed potatoes had a hard crust over the top of them. Basically, my experience was not good. The service was slow, the food was not good, and the bill was expensive for what I got.  I will not be going back."
Jana K.,"Eugene, OR",111,100,68,5.0,4/13/2014,Love this place but prices are super high!!! They just recently changed/updated their salad and I absolutely LOVE IT!!! It's so much healthier with darker greens and it's delicious! My favorite thing to eat here is the grilled chicken pasta with the blackened chicken.  I obviously love the pizookies. They are to die for. They have so many flavors to choose from but always a good one to go with is just the original chocolate chip! Yummmmmmm
Richard W.,"Talent, OR",2,11,1,3.0,4/19/2014,"Kitchen needs help. Service staff are wonderful, but this place needs some help. If the service wasn't so good, I would say this is a 1 star experience.  The calamari was medium, but the avacado egg roll was definitely good. The mahi-mahi tacos were hit and miss. Sometimes you had a bite that was pretty good, the next would be all breading.  My wife ordered a top sirloin medium-well. Came out like shoe leather. We were one of three tables that sent food back within ear shot. And that place isn't overly quiet.  I wouldn't return until they fix the kitchen."
Chantal H.,"San Francisco, CA",13,85,106,1.0,5/21/2015,The food was average but I am giving them 1 star because of the service. Our server Stephanie F was inattentive through out the whole meal. First off we did not get utensils or napkins until after we got our food. Our waitress did not write down our order resulting in our order being wrong twice. We had empty cups sitting at the end of table for over 15 minutes with the manager and our waitress looking directly at them. Not once did she ask how our food was and would constantly walk by our table checking on those around us and not ours. Lastly it was my boyfriends birthday and I let her know this information once we sat down and she did not say anything but I will take care of it and walks away. For the price level of food I expected better service from the BJ's restaurant chain.
Jenn L.,"Northridge, Los Angeles, CA",815,13,4,4.0,8/17/2015,Their beignet is a must try! I personally love it more then the pazookie. The service and food was amazing
Lisa L.,"Manteca, CA",0,23,15,5.0,7/1/2016,"Surprisingly, we had a booth in a quieter section of the restaurant during the lunch hour. Three of us ordered the Quinoa with salmon, one ordered the Rootbeer-glazed ribs, another had a burger. All meals were delicious and the wait wasn't too long. We enjoyed visiting with our family, and did not feel rushed to leave. The restaurant was clean, the staff efficient & friendly, and the food well executed."
