Diana W.,"Longview, WA",0,41,,3.0,12/3/2015,"(Note:  I added another star due to the manager contacting me after this review.  Good customer service) To be fair, we were there after 9:30 pm so even though they were to be opened at least another hour, it was obvious staff was in ""ready to get home"" mode.  My wife had injured her knee and the waiter wasn't happy that we wouldn't sit at the bar, up the stairs.  He still made us walk all the way to the back of the restaurant despite there being at least 20 tables/booths closer.  I order wings, got ribs quite awhile later.  My wife got spaghetti and meatballs.  It was ok...I ended up eating hers and she mine once my correct order finally arrived.  Not sure if I'd try it again, even if much earlier."
Alexandria J.,"Medford, OR",0,8,,5.0,11/21/2015,"This place is family friendly,not pricey,clean and elegant. The waiter was so friendly and the food is azing.we ordered a variety of things from pasta,chicken sandwich to soup and it all was delicious."
Mary Ellen A.,"Glenwood Springs, CO",28,22,,4.0,1/25/2014,"I am not a fan of chain restaurants, but this is the one exception.  Their avacado egg rolls are so yummy! Their ribeye steak is  consistently cooked perfectly. Great place when they are several people in your party with different tastes. Good selection of different entree's.  Some change with the time of year.   Too bad because their Burstin Berry Crisp was so good, that i've dreamt about it.  It should be back this spring.   B.J.'s serve's it with a scoop of french vanilla ice cream. Suitable for all ages. Children's menu also."
Ryan E.,"Chestertown, MD",83,115,3,4.0,12/8/2013,"Since I had been snowbound in my awful little apartment for nearly two days straight, my friend came and rescued me so that we could get out and go to dinner. As the new Texas Roadhouse location isn't open yet, we headed over to BJ's instead; I had had a nice lunch there at the bar a few weeks prior, and my friend was game, so that's what we settled on. I guess a lot of people had decided to do the same as us; the restaurant was bustling, and I believe our waiter may have been slightly overworked. But even though it took a few extra minutes to get our drinks and food, everything was quite good. My cocktail was impossible to mess up (a Tanqueray martini), and my friend's cocktail was apparently decent--she described it as ""a bit sweet,"" though, ""like something you'd get at the Olive Garden."" (I don't believe this was necessarily an insult, as she finished the whole thing.) Our ""black and blue"" flatbread appetizer pizza was quite good--lots of steak, mushrooms, and blue cheese. We both ordered the parmesan-crusted chicken (available in sandwich form at lunch), and were pleased with how juicy and delicious it was. Unfortunately our dinner was disturbed by a group of people sitting directly behind us who looked as though they had emerged directly from a deer stand in the middle of the Oregon wilderness. They were loudly complaining about every aspect of their dinner; indeed, at one point, they called the waiter over to complain about something... after they had cleaned their plates. (Obviously the waiter was at a loss--at one point he actually said, ""There's not much I can do since you ate the whole thing."" Valid point, methinks.) Anyway, I've had two good experiences here myself, so I'm certain I'll be back."
Kalli B.,"Beaverton, OR",90,81,8,4.0,12/10/2013,"Honestly, for a chain restaurant I was pleasantly surprised with this place. The decor was modern and clean (it's fairly new) and much more ""adult"" than I was expecting. Not too tacky at all! The service was friendly, though nothing memorable. It did take us about ten minutes to be seated at a table of two, but we were adequately warned and seated right when our buzzer went off, so I'm okay with that. The food was well-made and came out quickly. The menu can be a bit overwhelming, as it is a bit like an Applebees, where there is a wide assortment of options but no clear specialty. Still, I enjoyed my mahi mahi tacos. It is also conveniently located right off of the freeway and near a theatre, so it's a good destination if you're doing dinner and a movie!"
Stephanie S.,"Eugene, OR",15,1,,5.0,12/20/2014,"Karen w. I would like to know where you work so I can go there and critique you. I am a regular at BJs and Sam waits on me all the time. She treats me and my crew wonderfully with the best service and upmost respect. You should really reconsider speaking ill of someone when you have not walked one day on their shoes. Whatever happened... It's just a burger. It's not mortgage payment. I hope you enjoyed your movie though at the ""cinema""... (Now that's condescending.) I love BJ's and the service Sam and her co workers offer. The burgers are the best on town and so are the apps! Me and my crew always sit wherever Sam is serving and she keeps is coming back for more!!! Plus the beer and food are great!!!!!!"
Sarah A.,"Portland, OR",0,10,21,4.0,8/5/2015,"Not a lot of vegetarian options. Nice staff. Waitress was very accommodating. Receptionist was mildly rude. Drink was insanely strong, I had to ask for a different one. Ambiance was very noisy. Food was decent (I got appetizers for my meal)."
Marc C.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,75,2,4.0,6/2/2015,Excellent beer and great pizza as well. Highly recommended brew pub that is just fine. I will be back.
Justice B.,"Eugene, OR",0,6,,5.0,9/19/2015,I thought it was great!  I went here with my parents after they helped me move.  We shared ribs and calamari as an appetizer and my dad and we both very much enjoyed it.  I had the Mediterranean chicken tacos and thought it was great.    My dad had the parmesan chicken so I tried some and thought it was great also!   Service was really fast.   We definitely be coming again.   Hopefully all my visits will be as good as this one.
Angel S.,"Port Orford, OR",0,2,4,5.0,7/9/2015,"We were  so excited to have such great food on our vacation but what really made our experience great was our friendly server Tony! He was awesome, always sit in his section!"
Ethan A.,"Anchorage, AK",107,188,146,3.0,9/29/2013,"This place is beautiful and the menu has something for anybody. There must be 100+ entrée choices! We got there at 6pm, right before the waiting started. This place is good, but not worth waiting for. The service left a lot to be desired. We initially waited 15 minutes to even be greeted, then I was brought the wrong dish altogether. After that we waited a ridiculously long time to get the bill. I wouldn't mind coming back, but I'm going to wait 6 months until the fervor dies down and the wait staff has their act together."
David Q.,"Springfield, OR",4,14,,2.0,10/5/2013,"The new place looks great, the seating was relatively quick (10min) the service was mostly ok (our appetizer went someplace else but when we got ours it was delicious)  My only complaint was that the burger was very bland. I ordered a jalapeño burger, and it had no flavor in either the meat or the condiments. I was very disappointed. I've come to expect quality food here, and sadly we didn't get it."
Katie B.,"Eugene, OR",33,40,12,3.0,8/20/2013,"This is slowly becoming my new favorite late night food haunt. Their late happy hour (10pm-close) has cheap and yummy deals. Plus they have the best house root beer. I think I even like their buffalo wings better than Buffalo Wild Wing's. My husband and I got 3 items to share and 2 drinks and it was barely $20. On this visit our server, Ashley, also knocked it out of the park. She was fast, attentive, friendly, and very helpful."
Nevin B.,"Cottage Grove, OR",2,8,10,2.0,11/3/2014,An amazing building with good service gets them two stars.  I spent too much money on average beer and frozen food.  Why does a place like this go through all the trouble of building a great restaurant and not care about their food?  Open a package heat it up and put it on a plate is not food.  Thanks but I will pass next time.
Joey H.,"Eugene, OR",234,323,43,3.0,6/25/2013,"The service here was exceptional. However, I can't give them five stars when I got a mediocre salad for 13$ and a cocktail for 9.25$ Very updated and a great addition to the VRC. The bathrooms made it seem as if I was in a fancy hotel. I will try them out again for perhaps a burger and I am sure I would be more satisfied."
rayleen b.,"Springfield, OR",7,17,,2.0,11/1/2014,"The wait staff are great, the interior decorating is wonderful but the food...might as well get yourself a microwaveable dinner. I've been there twice and each time has been a let down."
Tom O.,"Eugene, OR",14,6,,2.0,1/10/2016,"First off, the menus are huge.  I ordered the California Chicken Sandwich.  it came with advacado, swiss cheese, bacon, lettuce on a grilled sour dough.  Sounds delicious.  However, the chicken tasted stale.  Did come with delicious shoe string fries."
Katherine B.,"Eugene, OR",171,12,,2.0,7/1/2013,"My mom and I went here yesterday for lunch, we both ordered Cobb salads and drinks.  The bad:  Salads were pretty bad they were the crappiest Cobb salads ever!  How do you mess up a classic like Cobb salad????  Well I'll tell ya;   The lettuce was chopped like coleslaw, no bleu cheese no cheese at all for that matter,  no egg, maybe a 1/2 a piece of bacon, about a table spoon of chopped flavorless chicken and it came with way too much dressing to the point where I couldn't eat it all.  The salads were way too expensive for what they were!  Also, our table was so close to the diners next to us that it felt like we were eating with them, we actually ended up talking to them because we were practically at the same table anyways. The good:  The service was great the ladies that helped us were very nice.  The decor is kinda cool, very  neat floors, light boxes and moldings.  My Piranha ale was great and so was her gin bloody Mary. Anyways it was my 1st experience at a BJ's and if I go back I'll never order another salad, EVER!   -Katherine"
Jeff L.,"Albany, OR",0,8,1,4.0,5/4/2015,Chelsea the bartender is very gracious. Sampling many artisan brews. Burgers are sumptuous!
Carrie K.,"Eugene, OR",0,2,,3.0,8/10/2013,"I was so hyped about the new BJ's!  It is a beautiful larger building with a lot more parking, and finally they have a full bar!  The food is still as good as before, however....$10.25 for a Long Island Iced Tea, and $5.25 for a pint of Oasis Amber, during happy hour no less?!  ARE YOU FREAKIN' KIDDING ME??? If a cocktail costs more than your actual meal, it's time to find another place to eat!!"
