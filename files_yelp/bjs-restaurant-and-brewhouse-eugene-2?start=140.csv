Chris F.,"Waldport, OR",21,19,,4.0,9/11/2014,I went back to this place a couple of weeks ago and what a difference!  The service was much better and the food was excellent.  I'm glad that I gave them a second chance. Must have caught them on a bad day.  I really like their beers.  I had a nice lager.  The place was very busy but we got served right away.  I noticed one jerk of a customer grab our waitress by the arm as she walked by.  She was very professional with him.  I was impressed.  I will definitely go back.  My only comment is that I wish they had more vegan options there.  Other than that BJ's won me back!
Dan B.,"Kelso, WA",0,6,,1.0,6/2/2015,"To start the visit off here, the service was pretty bad. Being a brew house the beer should be kind of a focus, I wasn't uberly thrilled that the waitress stumbled over my order of four of their house beers. Once my food order finally arrived, it was a little disappointing to see that it was not right after the long wait. Once it was finally there and correct it was merely mediocre at best. The beer wasn't bad though. I would have to   Say With this being my first dining experience there, there will not be a second. In all honesty it was just kind of ehh."
Molly F.,"Hillsboro, OR",17,28,12,4.0,2/23/2015,"Food is a pretty good, prices are fair, the ambience is fun.  If you go late they have a happy hour and it's not busy. Nice place for a dad/mom date night. :)"
Fred S.,"Creswell, OR",48,26,23,4.0,2/16/2014,"Nice building, great service. The French Dip was epic and I highly recommend it! Loved it so much that we went two day in a row."
Travis H.,"Eugene, OR",24,6,3,1.0,3/16/2015,"Absolute worst service ever! Lost reservations finally found after a 30 min wait. Orders were wrong, 2 kids didn't even get there orders until we tracked down the server and reminded him about them. 1 daughters order wasn't even taken. Came for my wife's birthday and they brought a complimentary pazooki and sang to the table next to us but not my wife even after we informed them it was her birthday. Manager came out and was uncaring and rude. Brought out Luke warm food in a bag for the kids. Very very disappointed!"
Katrina B.,"Eugene, OR",0,16,3,4.0,11/2/2014,"I loves this BJ'S location! I have been here many times. I do have to say that the bar area is where I prefer to go. The late night staff is amazing! I have sat in the normal dining area a few times and was unsatisfied with my meals every time, it was just ok in my opinion. If you want something amazing I suggest the avocado egg rolls or a pazookie!"
Gary D.,"Eugene, OR",9,16,1,1.0,1/25/2015,Not great food. Not good service. Hostess could be friendlier and also under quotes the wait time by a lot on several visits.  Checked in on iPhone a couple times and wait was much longer than I would have expected.
Stacey C.,"Frankfort, MI",25,22,7,4.0,11/11/2013,"Service was phenomenal. Our server Andrew S was friendly, engaged, helpful, quick, and fun. This was overall a great experience, especially for a brand new business!! Good food, lots of variety for a group who can't make up their minds. We tired the Oktoberfest beer on tap and it was pretty good."
Hosmor M.,"Eugene, OR",0,7,,4.0,3/28/2015,"Great place to watch a game, not too spendy and not too loud. The service here is quite consistent and the menu is huge. Tried the Frito Nachos. I recommend them, then don't eat for a week. Pizookies are always a wise choice."
Jeremy M.,"Eugene, OR",32,16,,4.0,2/16/2016,The food is good but pricey. The large selection can be a little overwhelming. The service is hit or miss. I've had great service and less than great service. It all depends on the staff and how busy they are. I haven't had any bad food there though.
Steven O.,"Eugene, OR",0,18,1,5.0,1/16/2016,"Great food. Vast menu. Staff always friendly. It's always busy-- if you go to a restaurant and there is nobody there, then that should tell you something. My favorite is the root beer glazed BBQ baby back ribs and the Parmesan chicken."
Liz T.,"Woburn, MA",35,222,320,4.0,8/4/2014,The food was delicious and came out quick.  The long island iced tea was yummy and our waitress was quick and efficient. Oh and nice atmosphere!
Nelson L.,"Happy Valley, OR",0,1,,1.0,9/2/2015,"My wife and I went in to have lunch, server Stephanie F. assume that I wanted salad with my burger, after I told her I did not order salad she insist that I did.  It is not the money, is her attitude, I will not recommend this restaurant to anyone, unless you want attitude with your meal."
Colleen H.,"Junction City, OR",0,7,,5.0,2/26/2015,"Every time I eat here it's a wonderful experience, always worth the wait, plus they have lots of Gluten Free options which makes this a favorite for my husband as well!"
Pat M.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,18,,1.0,9/13/2015,Stopped in here for lunch on a Sunday.  It was 20 percent full so we  thought that was a little strange.  We placed our food and drink order and started visiting.   The 4 tables surrounding us in the bar area filled right around the time our drinks arrived.  We were enjoying our visit and needed refills and noticed the surrounding tables had all received their food.  The waitress was not taking care of our table so and I had to flag her down and ask were our food was.  She said she would check on it.  Three minutes later she returned with food...not the correct food.  It also looked liked it spent too much time in the microwave.   There was no sign of a manager and the waitress threw an apology on the table but sure didn't offer to make things right.  I typically avoid chains but there are times when they offer a consistent meal and you know what you are going to get.  The only good thing I can say is I got the cold beer I ordered; my wife got the one the glass of ice tea and we had a great visit because we weren't interrupted with offers to provide more drinks or bring the food we ordered.  The transpired over a 40 minute period. To the management: do your job.  You should be watching the flow of the kitchen and observing tables with empty drinks and no food. I would recommend eating at one of the numerous nearby brew restaurants rather than here; that's my plan for the future.
Monica L.,"Springfield, OR",0,15,,4.0,2/17/2015,"I really like Bj's. Free pazookie on your kids' birthday. They have everything and I've never had a bad experience with service. I just don't have anything negative to say. It's not my favorite restaurant (thus a 4 star), but that's okay! Don't get me started on the fried lobster ravioli I had in NYC from my fav restaurant of 15 years ago. ;)"
Helen L.,"Junction City, OR",39,6,,5.0,10/16/2015,"Love, love, love BJ's!  Been going here for years and yes, some of the food is calorie laden (good for the soul), but there are lots of great healthy choices as well.  We usually sit in the bar area...no waiting.  Oh, and I love the atmosphere.... Here and at other BJ's up and down I5."
Gretchen D.,"Eugene, OR",0,11,,2.0,2/16/2014,"We went in for our first time and last time. The service was great, the food was good but a little over priced I believe. And our wait was much longer then the lady anticipated it to be.  My fiancé got food poisoning immediately after eating and was sick all night long.  Not a horrible experience overall  but just like the two start rating says I've experienced better."
Regina L.,"Springfield, OR",0,2,,2.0,11/15/2015,"No prices on the drinks, and when you ask you get ""most people just pay without asking"". So what is ""happy hour""? $1.00 off. $1.00 off what? See above. Sigh. Plus menu is WAY too complicated. And overpriced. Skinny fries were good, though."
Jody H.,"Kailua-Kona, HI",4,15,,1.0,2/10/2014,I found the GF menu limited. A lot of dairy meals. The menu was overwhelming too confusing to figure out what to eat. Graph with dots did not like. If one like pizza go for it. Very expensive to eat there
