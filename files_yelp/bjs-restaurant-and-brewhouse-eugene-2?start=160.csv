Josh A.,"Eugene, OR",6,30,2,5.0,3/4/2014,"If you can't find something you like here, then you would not be a fun date. The food menu is something like 6 pages from pizza to salad to Italian. They have shelves of spirits and dozen s of beers on tap. There is always something new to try here and that's why I cone back. Any group, any occasion works here."
Sheri S.,"Eugene, OR",4,4,1,3.0,2/9/2014,"The food is good but service is SLOW that is why i rated them a 3, plus the food may be good but not everything is...some of the things like the alfredo was bland...needed salt or more seasoning. The pizza didnt have a lot of flavor either (Bjs special). Prices aren't to bad depending on what u get. But i highly recommend the chicken crusted chicken, I've had & come back for & its really good...yum!"
Nancy A.,"Palm Desert, CA",0,14,,2.0,8/30/2015,"I went for drinks and dinner with a few friends. The waitress was not paying any attention to us, only talking about her son and how he was turning one. Otherwise the decor seems nice."
Karen M.,"Waldport, OR",0,1,,1.0,12/18/2014,"We visited on Tuesday, December 16 and it was such a disappointment! We have eaten here many times in the past with excellent service and good food and it has been a pleasurable experience. This time we were on our way to an opening show at the cinema. We were seated quickly and graciously by the hostess and a server introducing herself as Samantha took our order. I knew we only had about an hour to eat so I decided against the delicious pizzas they make and ordered a Brewhouse burger, well-done, with thin cut fries. Samantha was writing as I was the first to order and the other three in our family group ordered. The meal arrived within about fifteen minutes...that was fast. But...the burger Samantha gave to me was pink and had the thick cut fries...oops! I like a juicy burger like anybody but with food contamination so rampant I order my ground meat ""well-done"" for a reason. Ouch! Did she not hear me when I ordered? What was she writing down?? Samantha seemed to be a native English speaker. When I pointed out the error, she offered to bring out more fries and about a minute after bringing them to the table, she came back and asked in a condescending, patronizing tone, ""Are your fries good, are these the right fries??"" Yeah, girl...thanks but I don't have time to eat them now and also, I didn't screw up the order. I don't think Samantha exemplifies the great service I typically associate with BJ's and I may not return after this bad experience."
Ellie S.,"Portland, OR",4,50,15,3.0,7/30/2013,"This place has a new location at Valley River Center.  It is a lovely building with a great looking bar and some great tv's for watching sports or whatever.  We were seated  in a timely manner and our waiter was very friendly and helpful.  That is where the praise ends!  The drinks are very overpriced.  Mike ordered calzone  and it was basically crust.  My angel hair pasta had little flavor or seasoning.  A sprinkle or two of parmesan cheese would have helped a bit, but none was offered.  The place was packed...I don't get it.  I was disappointed.  This is a typical chain restaurant that is way over-rated....."
Doug D.,"Eugene, OR",7,129,,4.0,12/30/2013,"Nice new place by VRC! The menu is large and the food is pretty good. I wish they had a better beer list, in Eugene you expect some great beers. Plan on waiting for a table."
Paul Y.,"Portland, OR",0,29,6,3.0,6/6/2015,Very slow Waiter barely if ever checked in.Once got check to us then took a long time to puck it back up.Good food though.
Darian O.,"Eugene, OR",0,4,1,2.0,11/23/2014,"Today was my birthday, my family wanted to go to dinner. We stopped by Olive Garden and they had way too long of a wait so we went across the street to BJ's. When we arrived, the hostess which was very stuck up, acted as if she was better than me by the looks she gave and how short she was with me, told me there would be a 20-30 minute wait for my family (9 people). 45 minutes passed as we still stood in their lobby waiting to be seated. Other families of 5 and 6 were getting seated as the walked in. Finally, after an hour of waiting they pushed two small tables together and sat 9 chairs there. The two small tables were enough room for a table of 6. Each chair was touching the other. We asked the waitress if we could slide the empty table next to us over so we could sit comfortably. She said she would need to ask the manager. Soon after the manager (a tall limber young guy) came over to slide the table to ours. He then told us that we requested enough seating for 9 people and that is what they did for us. After giving us more attitude we explained how we had sat for an hour waiting to eat there. He then said, ""you only waited for 45 minutes."" We were ignored by him and the majority of the other staff. One person helped us the entire time. Our waitress was very helpful and polite. Usually the food is very good at this business, but this time is was mediocre. Our experience here was less than enjoyable and was definitely not worth the $225.00 tab we paid for at the end. I will not be back."
Matt W.,"Eugene, OR",0,10,1,5.0,6/25/2013,Tried out this reincarnation of BJ's here in Eugene on there opening night.  Went for takeout and was met by an upbeat staff at the front door.  The take out staff was equally friendly and very efficient.  They had my order ready when I arrived (5 minutes ahead of schedule!).  The Santa Fe Chicken salad was spicy and just what I had hoped for...  Huge menu to choose from.
Jani A.,"Eugene, OR",3,4,,2.0,10/19/2013,"3rd try at BJs to have a good meal and was disappointed for the third time! Long wait for a table, extra long wait for our meal....no silverware on the table. Had to ask for silverware when food was brought!  I had. Cajun Pasta that had nothing put a pile of pasta with a bland tomato sauce and a dried out chicken breast with a bit of Cajun spice on it with two tiny pieces of garlic toast.. My husband had a chicken fried steak that looked like a large chicken nugget with no gravy. Tasteless and dry. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone!  Sad because they have a beautiful new restaurant in a great location bot the food is not worth the price!"
Nyles W.,"Crescent City, CA",29,27,4,4.0,3/27/2014,Exceptional service. Waitress was very friendly and wanted to make sure we had a great experience. Wife had chicken Parmesan and it was pretty good. I had the Mediterranean chicken tacos. They where very good. Also ordered corn fritters. Fritters should have some sweet but it was just slightly spicy. Still good just now what we expected. Overall great experience priced right.
Chuck F.,"Eugene, OR",0,3,,5.0,6/18/2014,"6 OR 7th time at the new BJ's - We always have had a perfect meal (from appetizer to desert) I usually have the Cherry Salmon, my beautiful  wife has  the burger, but this time Pennie had the Rib Eye, great texture, nice flavor, but too much leftover FAT!!!. Sorry BJ's Outback blows your doors off with their Specialty Sirloin; BJ's was nice enough though to add a large extra piece of Salmon for just 4.95 - now that's a GREAT DEAL!!!!!   The appit. (Stuffed Mushrooms & Avocado Rolls) were amazing as always. To round things off the free Chocolate Pizookie my wife adored. We take Ride Source and the server - LEAH S - let us stay and kept filling drinks while we waited for the bus. Try BJ's in Eugene - you will be glad you did Chuck"
Judy A.,"Eugene, OR",0,40,4,3.0,9/3/2013,"The new BJs is very nice inside, although a bit chilly (take a sweater).  They knock themselves out with service, which is refreshing.  The food was okay, and I do recommend the tortilla soup."
Nan L.,"Springfield, OR",0,6,,3.0,10/16/2013,"We stopped in here on 10/13/13 for a birthday dinner. The atmosphere is very shiny (though there was a cobweb in the vaulted ceiling of the foyer) and a little less loud than, say, an Outback or similar restaurant would be. The lighting level was fine. We had to wait for about 30 minutes to be seated. We ordered the hand-tossed BJ's Favorite pizza. The large 14"" size will give a party of four about two slices each (though on ours there was one HUGE slice and one teeny-tiny slice mixed among the others). We also ordered the crispy calamari, chicken pot stickers, and garlic parmesan boneless wings. Calamari: The good news: you get a lot for your ten bucks. The bad news: it's not that great. It was rather chewy, and I get the impression that it is not a 'proper' calamari, in the sense that you get a mix of the traditional battered mantle rings and little battered baby squid that met their demise in the deep fryer. Not that I care that much, personally, but if you're a purist you will want to skip it. The lemon-garlic aioli was rather good though. Pot stickers: They were pretty good, if a tad too brown on one side. The accompanying sauce is good. Wings: The best of the appetizer lot that we had -- very tender, well-seasoned, and generously-sized chunks of white meat.  The pizza was pretty good, aside from the odd cutting job. My partner had the PB Porter, which he liked; the Tatanka is also a good one if  you like dark beers. I had the Brewhouse Blonde, which is quite tasty. The waiter also provided a sampler of the pumpkin ale, which sounds like a great novelty, but would be way too rich IMHO to justify an entire glass of it. Unless you REALLY like the taste of pumpkin and spice in your brew. Their pazookies are arguably the best thing on the menu (besides the beer). Just be aware that they are LARGE. The chocolate chunk pazookie is a big chocolate chip cookies with two scoops of vanilla ice cream on it; the peanut butter chunk one is a VERY rich peanut butter cookie with the same. If you're not a big dessert eater or are self-conscious about it, you can order the mini size, which is what is pictured on the menu. Service was a bit slow (they were even slow getting the pazookies out, though they were warm from the oven when they arrived), and a little uneven (appetizers arrived not long before the pizza), but the very busy waiter seemed attentive enough and he was very helpful and had a great attitude. Dinner for four was around $80 including drinks and dessert."
Shirley L.,"Eugene, OR",30,7,,1.0,9/17/2014,"Called weeks ahead to inquire if a ""party room"" was available. I was told yes, so after confirming it was adequate in size for 20 and assured it was,  I booked it for a group of 20 for an event.  When I arrived 15 min early, to set up flowers, was told to take a seat by a  rude young receptionist ""until it is closer to booked time"".  I inquired if room was in use currently, and told No.  I asked ""may I just take a look to get my bearings?"" and was shocked when she pointed to a long table set up in the middle of the busy noisy restaurant and said ""that is your spot""  I said ""I was told there was a party room, which I booked, and was told "" this is it....no explanation. Even when I inquired and asked if there was a more quiet spot...both myself  & the friend helping me and I were shocked by her ""no"", Period.   I suggested that when I asked about a ""party room"" I would have assumed there was an actual room or partioned space...not just pushing tables together.  Food was ""so so""  (we did like the large group pazookis for desert) but expensive, and  noise and atmosphere terrible for a group - we were unable to speak with other attendees of the celebration. Overall  an expensive, disappointing evening. My worst restaurant review ever."
Del R.,"Los Gatos, CA",2,21,,2.0,10/21/2013,"As posted by another reviewer my wife and I had the cobb salad and found it to be lacking in everything except lettuce.  Service was very slow.  As the other reviewer stated, how can you not make a good cobb salad?  Red Robin knows how to do it and they are only a couple of blocks away in Valley River Center."
Heidi M.,"Veneta, OR",0,5,,5.0,3/4/2015,"The pazookie was delicious. I always have pretty good service and food here! Typical chain restaurant but the building is beautiful! Self seating in the lounge area is cool! But with most self seating areas it may take an extra minute to get service! That usually doesn't bother me, because when I go out it's to relax and have a nice time, not to time the server/kitchen ;) try the chicken pita tacos with a side of classic wing sauce,yummmm!"
Holly D.,"Springfield, OR",46,7,9,1.0,3/25/2014,"Mediocre food and awful service. Just wanted a dipping sauce and everyone else was almost finished eating before I got it, then the waitress never apologized and refused to look me in the eye after that. I've talked to others with similar experiences here, I will never go back, the food was definitely not worth it with so many choices like Red Robin, Olive Garden, and Red Lobster close by!!"
Vickie G.,"Bend, OR",0,11,,1.0,8/27/2014,"I've given BJ's 3 chances, 3strikes they're out!  Celebrated a birthday dinner last night, had reservations made for 10 people, we were sat at a table for 6 people, adults, and some of us had to sit in the corners of the table so we could eat without touching! I ordered spaghetti, horrible horrible!! The sauce tasted like it was out of a can. I actually think Hunts makes a better sauce. My son had the brew burger, tasted so bad he couldn't eat it all. We never did get the milk for our granddaughter. So I'm giving one star, our waitress was very nice."
David F.,"Davidson, NC",0,20,,4.0,5/5/2014,"Steak was ok our first time in, but they did just open.   We returned this weekend and they nailed it.   Ordered a Bloody Mary which was made well.  And My chicken bacon ranch pizza was award worthy!                                                       We will return"
