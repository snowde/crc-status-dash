Don D.,"Klamath Falls, OR",0,38,,4.0,11/15/2013,"We got here about 11:30 in the morning. No lines, and quick service.  We both liked our burgers and the fries and baked potato were hot and good.   The building was quite impressive.  The staff seemed well trained and friendly.   We have never been to a B J's before but we probably will be back. We did not try the beers or the bigger meals."
Aanya A.,"University District, Seattle, WA",22,5,3,1.0,10/19/2013,"This is the 3rd time I've gone there..been disappointed all 3 times. Spaghetti with marinara taste like it's from a jar, no flavor, the Cajun pasta has absolutely no flavor and I thought Cajun was suppose to have even a little bit of a kick? No. Service is never awesome, two times out of 3 the waiters forgot silverware until after we got our food. Saw two waiters drop large played of glassware and food, just in an hour! Yes the restaurant looks beautiful, but looks can be deceiving at this place. I would save your 50 bucks and walk into the mall and go to chilis, it's not great either, but chances are your food will at least be cooked right. I mean who has chicken fries steak without gravy?..ok that's my piece"
Paul H.,"Eugene, OR",0,8,,2.0,1/14/2014,"I was hoping for a nice hot, tasty bowl of chicken tortilla soup with lots of chicken, tortilla strips, broth, avocado, etc. What I got was a lukewarm, gelatinous, 1/3-full bowl with two small pieces of chicken, a few crunchy bits of something and a few shavings of cheese, plus some small bits of unidentifiable veggie parts.  On the other hand, the lemon in my water was fresh, and the waiter was nice. I'd rather have a real bowl of real soup..."
Mollie K.,"Redmond, OR",0,17,,2.0,11/19/2013,Was pleased to see they had gluten free pizza that didn't taste like cardboard. That was a perk. Our group of 3 had decent food and drinks. Felt really crowded at the table from the poor design of putting too many tables in right next to each other. Literally my rear end touched the table next to us when i tried to get up and leave and I'm quite slinder if that tells you anything. Wait staff was friendly but we were all VERY put off by the constant pushing of sales. Oh my goodness. We got asked 3 different times to sign up for the bjs club type thing. It wasn't just hey let me leave this at the table if you wanna check it out. Was more along the line of 3 sales pitches at inappropriate times by 3 different people that sounded like they were trying to sell us a used car... Wow... Tacky! Loved the old location and food so hopefully they will back off on the new sales pitchy idea soon.
Amber W.,"Mount Vernon, WA",6,5,,3.0,7/17/2013,"The food here is good when you actually get it. My family and I called ahead to get a table and got seated pretty fast but everything went downhill from there. Our waiter didn't know the menu at all and took forever to get us our drinks. I understand this for a Saturday night so I forgave it but we ordered appetizers and after waiting 45 minutes they arrived with our main food, which half of it was messed up. So to shorten it up the food is good but the service could use some definite work."
William M.,"Roseburg, OR",0,7,,3.0,10/27/2013,Food and beer pretty good. Sorta cramped seating. Bench seating for many of the tables by the wall so you better get along with your neighbors and hope they have the ikds under control.
John G.,"Kahului, HI",0,6,,1.0,2/28/2014,i just walked out after sitting in the bar for fifteen minutes. place was mostly empty with staff all over looked zombies. no eye contact never asked what i wanted. too busy counting receipts and cleaning empty tables. i wont be back
Jenna P.,"Eugene, OR",0,2,,3.0,8/24/2014,We the Poston Family has been a member since the year of 1996 we have asked to have our favorite waiter or waitresses but always seem to get the ones that have not yet can keep the restauraunt  the same way... as it was previously we would like to remove the trained waiter or waitresses because every time I ask for a refill of my favorite drinks it always slips the trained waiter or waitresses mind lately we have only been tipping 15% typically will tip 20% if it's our traditional waiter or waitress
Aurelia E.,"Eugene, OR",0,3,,1.0,12/4/2013,"The food sucks!  Ordered a cheese burger and fries, what I got was a very overcooked, dry burger - no cheddar cheese, no mayo or mustard, a tiny bit of lettuce, pickle, tomato AND a nasty crust of burnt Parmesan cheese on the bun that left a bad taste in my mouth for hours. Fries were dry and cold, very small amount with a few so burnt they were completely black. Also tasted my friends salad, (barbeque chicken) which was messy pile of bland ice burg lettuce shredded so thin it was hard to even eat. Barbeque chicken was also dry and sauce was very plain. Prices for food was way over what you get and quantities are small.  Service was pleasent but slow, granted they were busy,  which I can deal with if the food is okay, but it is wasn't. Also found the building to be ridiculously huge and ostentatious with no ambiance, unless you want a TV at every angle.   And by god, they need to do something about the finish of the their flooring,  walking across it with only 2"" heeled boots was freaky slippery - going to the bathroom felt like I was doing the mamba with death I have no interest in going back there, ever."
Robert W.,"Springfield, OR",0,13,,2.0,12/5/2013,"The food is good, but here is the main problem: as soon as you  walk in the door the hostess asks you if you are a club member. If you say no you are pushed to try and select the bar area, which they will sell by telling you it is open seating.  However, if you take that choice you will notice the one server trying to take care of all of the non-members. Drinks will stay empty and food takes longer to get there. Looking across the fence to the regular seating you see each waitress has about 3-4 tables and the service is next member. The next time I showed up and refused the open seating the service was ten times as good. What a shameless way to make people sign up for your little club."
Rio H.,"Eugene, OR",82,12,2,4.0,4/24/2014,"I am a huge fan of their half baked cookie with ice cream on the top. I used to come here from time to time but haven't been since they relocated. Overall, awesome place to eat."
Dominic I.,"Eugene, OR",4,26,10,1.0,8/30/2013,"This place is a goddamn joke.  Saddest corporate restaurant i've ever seen. We went there with an hour and a half!! before we were going to a movie.  Sat at the bar.  Not very busy, but the one bartender was making drinks for the floor and his bar so he wasn't dead, i will give him that.  We ordered drinks and than asked if there was a happy hour for food.  There was, looked at a menu and ordered 2 apps, we decided to just get that and go to dinner after the movie.  Twenty minutes go by.  I had seen a server bring another bar patron their food, and we knew he rang it in because he printed a new tab every time we added to it and put it in a cup right in front of us.  We ordered another drink and just waited.  At forty five minutes, we are trying to get the attention of the bartender but it seems like he's avoiding us at all cost.  Finally he makes eye contact and immediatly says ""I'm gonna go check on that food"".  Gone for 5 minutes, servers EVERYWHERE standing around... comes back with food for someone at the other end of the bar.  Goes back in the kitchen for 5 more minutes.  Finally after an hour he comes out with our food.  The ""boneless wings""... two of the 5 were literally as big as a quarter, and everything was completely cold.  It had obviously been sitting on the line waiting to bed ran for AT LEAST 30 minutes if not more.  There were so many servers on shift I don't know how anyone let food sit there for that long.  cooks, managers, all totally oblivious.  It was an outrage.  The bartender and manager tried to say that it was because there was a shift change happening and people were getting off and coming on and thats why there were so many people just standing around, we didn't want our food nor had time to wait another long ass time to get it remade.  They took the food off our bill and gave us a 15$ gift card.  We couldn't use the gift card to buy our drinks, cant use it on the same visit.  Not looking forward to going back.  prolly gonna just have drinks again and no food."
Sammy J.,"Eugene, OR",0,3,,4.0,9/16/2013,"The calamari is super delicious, foods good and the waiters are always friendly. I like this atmosphere and set up a lot better than the coburg location. This is not the place to go if your looking for a quiet relaxing night out. I give it 4 stars because the hostesses at the front desk act robotic. First time I came in it wasn't busy at the entrance, nobody waiting. I asked for a table for two, towards the side of her was someone ready to seat us. We walked up to the lady ready to seat us and the hostess requests that we take a seat and they'll seat us when they're ready. We sit down and two seconds later she nods at the lady and the girl standing there goes alright let's get you seated! I felt like that scene in Meet the Parents where they make Greg wait and nobody's at the airport. Not the only time... Awkward."
Jennifer B.,"Eugene, OR",0,8,,1.0,9/10/2013,"We won't be returning.   Pro - call ahead seating, outdoor patio with windows that close for winter. Cons - Pricey menu, small portions, insanely LOUD atmosphere, poor lighting, uneducated waitstaff. We decided to try out BJ's after they moved, first visit had a line out the door with a 45+ minute wait.  We found they had call ahead seating, and took the number for a future visit.  When we decided to try again, I utilized the call ahead seating before we left for our 15 minute commute.  When we arrived, we still waited another 15 minutes to get a seat.  We were seated in a booth adjacent to the bar area.  This would not have been my choice seat - being a family with children.  The entire restaurant was insanely noisy - couldn't hear my husband from across the table.  The restaurant is dark, and with it being a sunny day, and brightness coming through the main entrance, I was blinded the entire vist, and couldn't even see my husband across the table from me.  We had a coupon for a free ""bite"" and ordered the won tons.  Server promptly returned saying they were temporarily out of won tons, and convinced me to select a different item.  Then returned a few minutes later only to say that they really did have won tons, so he did order me that.  I wish he would have returned to give me the option - because I would have stayed with our second choice. Kids meals were very small.  One of my kiddos asked for veggies/ranch as the side.  And he received 3 small baby carrots, and 2 sticks of celery - all of which were dried looking.  Other kiddo asked for a salad, and received a very small pile of lettuce - no veggies. The kids entree was also small - and both my kiddos (6 and 9) begged for a snack within an hour of eating dinner here. I ordered a calzone, which was only meh.  All of my toppings were on one end of the calzone - and it was mostly air.  It was very small for the $10, and came with nothing else.  Husband ordred a pasta dish, and was happy with it. Overall - dark, noisy, expensive, small portions - we won't return."
J J.,"Eugene, OR",0,22,,2.0,9/9/2013,"Overall ok but we're definately not impress.  We've never been to BJ's restaurant before so we wanted to try it.  The restaurant looks good, service was ok, price ok if the food was good, food not so good. We had gluteen free pizza was dry and not warm, and chicken alfredo was dry, not warm, and no sauce.  We tried there dessert ""Pazookie"" and it was absolutey delicous.  We might order Pazookie to go but i dont think we will be back anytime soon."
D M.,"Pleasant Hill, OR",0,4,,4.0,2/8/2014,"My family and I have been going to BJ's for years.  My favorite dish is the Hawaiian Mahi Mahi...SO yummy!  Service at the new location hasn't been quite as good as the Coburg Road location.  The food, however, has always been great!"
Nika H.,"Eugene, OR",1,2,,1.0,9/20/2013,"I've been going to Bjs for years. My son loves the pizza, we love the salads and beer. The new location is wonderful and this was my 2nd visit  but tonight nothing went right. I called ahead to put our name on the list but I called to soon. Called back 30 min. later and was told that once we got to the restaurant there would still be a 30 min wait for our party of six. Ok, so we hop in the car. By the time we get there the wait is now 50 min. Ok, so we wait. Its my sons Birthday - this is a family tradition. From the time we sat til the food got to us was well over an hour and a half. We weren't the only table being neglected they were slammed - at capacity- and the kitchen could not keep up . At the end a manager handed out thank you cards (good for $5 -$500 gift cards but you can use only one per visit - we got four- and are good for only two months) and apologized, as did our waiter. But I don't think I will return, the food, price and service just are not good enough to make it worth the 3hrs we spent there. Maybe during the week when its not so busy - but I would avoid if you plan to go with a group or on a busy night. Also they only take a limited number of reservations."
