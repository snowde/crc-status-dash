Louis H.,"Palm Desert, CA",0,24,,3.0,5/11/2017,Overall pretty basic and uninteresting place to eat. The food was ok and the service was ok. I wouldn't really recommend.
Mark K.,"Junction City, OR",5,14,,3.0,1/29/2017,"We've eaten here several times since it opened and usually have a great experience. Today was mediocre. The host & hostess seemed more interested in their cell phones and conversation with each other than to seat us or others waiting. The server was engaging and friendly, but somehow didn't place my order correctly. I ended up waiting while my wife ate. When the food arrived it was with a great many apologies. I appreciate the honesty - but I still expected more. Food quality is what I expected from BJ's, nothing too terribly fantastic, but good pub style food."
Rob L.,"Eugene, OR",18,1,,2.0,5/8/2017,"I saw a coupon on Facebook for buy one entree get one free offer with two drinks purchase. My boy friend and I decided to take our our friend out to celebrate her birthday.  When we showed the server the coupon and he said the coupon is ONLY for royal club members.   I am not a club member for I couldn't get the coupon offer.  The coupon itself does not mention anything about the club member required to exercise the coupon.  I felt a bit ripped off and cheated.  We go to BJ here and there and the service is always good.  The point of this commend is has I known i couldn't use my coupon, we would've considered restaurants like the Road house or PF Chang or the FUji steak house all right within walking distance."
Stephen R.,"Cal Young, Eugene, OR",194,1,,1.0,7/19/2017,"Waited over an hour and a half for pizza and a burger. When they finally came out, both items were cold. Then we ordered pizzokies and it took another forty five minutes. Absolutely terrible experience."
Kayla C.,"Philomath, OR",82,3,6,4.0,4/28/2017,"We come here often and it's always great. Except for tonight. We sat down at 850.. they tell us that the prime rib is well done.. the guys were upset at this, I could careless.. we order apps and they come out 3 min before our food..  we don't get our food until 10!!  My ceaser salad had 2x the amount of dressing where my dates had none.  I ordered a stake well done. It was super bloody, cold, and burnt. We had 6 people in our party all with stakes. . All were cold they had no flavor no seasoning.. we were super disappointed tonight. Normally we love the food here, tonight was a very off night."
Kelly P.,"Eugene, OR",50,1,,5.0,4/23/2017,Excellent pairing bison burger with the hand made margarita. Bison was grilled to perfection
Amanda H.,"Eugene, OR",60,4,,3.0,3/23/2017,"It kinda just is what it is. Not bad, not phenomenal. The host was rude and really just here to ""do his job"". The food was fine a little overpriced but not awful. It's definitely not a ""go to"" spot for us."
Joanna W.,"Kansas City, MO",188,46,4,5.0,6/25/2016,"Expected run of the mill food because this is a chain, but I can assure you the flavors are extraordinary. From the craft beers to the delicious and extensive menu...everything was perfect. The jambalaya was spicy and a good portion. Appetizers were on point (avacado egg rolls and mushroom sticks). Mediterranean chicken was light, but full of flavor. Definitely a place to check out. Our second stop here served up more excellent appetizers and the best Berry Cider. Well done."
Dayla C.,"Eugene, OR",21,39,9,3.0,1/7/2017,"Got a take out order. Everything is better when you eat in though. They forgot the Au Jus to my Dip sandwich, which sucked. Thin fries were Ice cold, again.. Probably much better when seated. Service was good. They were busy so I can't complain too much."
Phillip O.,"Eugene, OR",17,9,11,4.0,1/22/2017,Great time tonight. Big shout out to Brooke she was on point tonight. Everyone was happy with dinner and drinks. See you soon
Beth D.,"Portland, OR",8,52,76,3.0,7/16/2015,"When we walked in, there were kids running around the front area. The place is dark and loud. They didn't seat us. Instead, the hostess turned around to direct us to a table in the bar area, but when she turned, I couldn't hear a thing she said. Eventually, we figured out what she was saying and seated ourselves. Service was prompt. The server was courteous. She did a good job, tho she took a while to come by after we were done - at least 10 minutes. And we had to ask her for a dessert menu.  The menu is enormous. When my friends suggested an entree, they had to give me a page number - page 12 - and even then, the menu is busy. There are so many choices. The pics look like the food that comes out, tho. They also serve a lot of it. Good bang for your buck. We ordered pizzas. The Mediterranean and the Cantina (or Catalina?). I realize Mediterranean pizzas have salty toppings, but the other pizza was just as salty. It was too much. The dessert, the s'mores, was outta-this-world good.  Overall, it was okay. If you want something dependably average, like any other big box chain, then BJs is all right. If I come back, I'm not ordering pizza tho."
Patrice D.,"Irvine, CA",17,5,,1.0,2/28/2017,"Food was amazing!  Fried artichoke appetizer, top sirloin with brussel sprouts and tomato/basil salad!  Service was HORRIBLE!!!! Taylor needs to go back to waiter school! Took him six minutes to even greet me and that was only after I complained.  Then the salad, appetizer and entree appeared within seven minutes of each other...in that order. I was not offered dessert. Just the check.  Gladly accepted!!"
Julie E.,"Junction City, OR",3,46,14,4.0,12/24/2016,Service by Ken 5 star. Rib Eye Steak 4 star. Ahi salad 3 star. Beer 4 star. Because of prior reviews I wouldn't have tried BJs but we received a gift certificate. ..so we tried it. Loved the atmosphere  !
Layan O.,"Eugene, OR",3,8,2,3.0,1/2/2017,I liked the waiters they are super nice.. I went here with my boyfriend he had the Italian market pizza and a steak. The pizza was so great I really really liked it and the steak that he liked so much however I had a shrimp pasta that I didn't really like. The pasta wasn't juicy and it had no taste. Overall I notice that all the dishes comes really cold and that didn't make any of us happy. Come on who wants a cold dinner?
Susan K.,"Eugene, OR",65,14,2,3.0,10/14/2016,"Went on. Friday evening, 6:30 pm. They are/were not prepared for the crowds!  We ended up waiting 45 minutes for a table (party of 5).  There is nowhere comfortable to wait so we had to stand the whole time. Once seated, we had a 10 minute wait before the waiter got there to take drink orders. Drinks took another 15 minutes. Food order took 30 minutes.  We arrived at the restaurant at 6:30 pm, we did not leave until 9:00 pm.  The service is slow, however our waiter was amazing.  Great service, but very slow. Food was good but way over priced.  $10-$15 per plate.  Recommend but not during peak time, make sure you have a lot of time and money before you go."
Jaycee H.,"West Beaverton, Beaverton, OR",108,1,,5.0,7/18/2017,"A corporate restaurant with a real family service. People who will remember your name and treat you with respect. Tony, Stephanie, Christina in the cocktail lounge are a real treat. The bartenders are on point and the service is crisp."
Samantha K.,"Seattle, WA",3,38,60,3.0,10/30/2015,"Although I was with a large party (~26) it took very long to be seated even with a reservation! Probably around 40 minutes. Although that is my only complaint it does warrant a drop in rating because I get hangry easily!  I ordered the fire-roasted barbacoa chicken and added avocado (which added a lot to the dish). The chicken was cooked well. I shared the chocolate chunk and cookies n cream pizookies with friends. Surprisingly, I actually thought the cookies n cream was slightly better than the classic chocolate chip. Both were great though."
Pam K.,"Roseburg, OR",36,22,32,5.0,10/4/2015,"First the service is awesome! The beer & cocktail selection ""huge"" & the garlic chicken pesto flatbread pizza was almost perfect (fresh tomatoes instead of Canned)  They even have a rewards program dollar for dollar. My bartender/server was McKenna & she's fabulous!!"
Valerie P.,"Bothell, WA",0,60,,4.0,7/10/2017,"Chain restaurants don't usually appeal to me, especially in a town like Eugene that has so many interesting restaurant choices. However, my nephew & his girlfriend suggested this spot, and so we went. I must say, the food was good. The atmosphere was crowded/noisy and not particularly interesting, but it was clean and pleasant, and the service was good. As I said, the food was also good, so that's all that really mattered. If you're out by the mall, this is a safe bet."
Eric C.,"Tualatin, OR",7,38,2,3.0,10/28/2016,For a chain this place is pretty good. Had great broccoli and cheddar soup with my lunch.
