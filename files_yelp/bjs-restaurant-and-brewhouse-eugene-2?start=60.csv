Pablo V.,"Grants Pass, OR",1,7,4,5.0,6/12/2016,"So my spicy chicken pineapple deep dish was delicious alongside a Dr. Pepper.      With how busy this restaurant is, the order and wait times are very impressive. Definitely recommend it here for any occasion. I plan on returning here on my next visit to Eugene. Bravo!!"
Yaran S.,"Pittsfield, MA",109,189,943,3.0,12/1/2013,"Services are great. Our server is really nice and outgoing but sometimes she has too much enthusiastic. It is awkward that someone check the table when there are a lot of food in your mouth :/  I like their berry jack lemonade. We ordered avocado egg role for appetizer and salmon and pasta as the main entries. Nothing fancy, but it worth a try."
David C.,"Springfield, OR",2,7,,1.0,8/21/2016,Very dirty menus were sticky floor was very dirty. Our waiter seemed like every time we asked for something he was bothered to get it one of the worst experiences we've ever had at a restaurant. Was told by manager that they were going to send me a coupon for my dinner never received anything
Heather B.,"Bend, OR",2,60,42,5.0,6/25/2016,"Best server I've ever had, Dawn H. She made me want to come back. Genuinely cared about us and our needs. So sweet and on top of things."
Tammy W.,"North Bend, OR",24,4,1,5.0,9/11/2016,Excellent ck. Avocado bacon sammie. Skinny fries were yummy!  The triple decker sammie was huge! Very good and filling.
Heather D.,"Oakland, CA",57,300,147,4.0,12/18/2015,"I know it is a chain but I love them so!  I bellied up to the bar to watch the Raiders beat the Rockies on a rainy Sunday.  As a happy coincidence I made it during their most excellent happy hour ($1 off drafts and $2 off apps). The Piranha Pale Ale was yummy and refreshing.  As an accompaniment I also ordered the California Club Flat Bread which had perfectly seasoned chicken and lots of avocado, it was a very nice compliment to the beer."
Mae Z.,"Eugene, OR",1,22,,5.0,6/29/2016,"I came here for the first time a few days ago, and I left very satisfied. They have a huge selection to choose from and it all looks very delicious. I ordered an alcoholic blended strawberry beverage that was just perfect. I also ordered the soup bread bowl, and it was homemade fresh broccoli and cheddar soup within toasted fresh bread. I only wish they served more soup with it as I feel the portions could be more equal. I also tried a pizookie for the first time, and it's now one of my favorite desserts, I chose the salted carmel."
Cody P.,"Bend, OR",5,41,1,3.0,5/11/2016,"I really enjoy BJs (who doesn't?) but their beer prices are criminal. They're proud of their own beers to the tune of $6.25 a pint, which is the most you can really pay for a glass of beer this side of the ballpark, airport or strip club. Worse, they now apparently default to a 12 oz. glass for something as ordinary as Boneyard IPA and charge the same $6.25, which I learned the hard way. Since the rewards program only kicks back about 7 percent, it doesn't come close to making up for the absurd premium. But, the food and service are great."
Opinionated B.,"Bay Area, CA",96,409,45,5.0,6/19/2016,I generally don't bother reviewing chains but occasionally exceptions make it through. They have their curbside pick ups down! We placed a huge order and it was executed flawlessly and food damn tasty. super friendly too
Randy S.,"Seattle, WA",0,8,,5.0,1/24/2017,"I can't say enough about the service that I had at BJ's. First, I can't believe how many beers they have on tap and the bartender was happy to let us try any of them. The meal was great and it was my birthday. The problem was that I left my purse on the chair in the bar. Next morning three hours down the road headed south toward San Francisco I realized the problem. I called and they very graciously volunteered to FedEx it to me in San Francisco!  That is service!  I kept volunteering to pay but they wouldn't take anything."
C G.,"Eugene, OR",0,2,,4.0,8/23/2016,"When I was there today in a party of 4 we were able to be seated right away. And our server was polite, but didn't really give us long enough to get through the huge menu. When our food arrived (very short waiting time) One plate of pasta was inconsistently heated. An order that was chicken tenders and fries had cold fries.  Everything else was okay with both our food and service."
Angela S.,"Eugene, OR",15,78,6,4.0,8/17/2015,"My husband and I used to walk here for beers and tapas before catching a movie at Regal.  It's in a great location for that!  The service is always friendly and we like knowing that we can be in and out fairly quickly if need be.  The food is pretty standard chain restaurant food, but I have to say that I really like their deep dish pizzas.  The crust on those are always so crispy  on the outside and soft of the inside, almost like they fried it.  Please dont tell me the calorie count on those!   We like that they have an extensive tap list of their own beers.  They're not crazy impressive, but they sure do cover all beer tastes and usually there are one or two more interesting styles/beers on tap."
Stephanie M.,"Eugene, OR",132,4,3,1.0,1/11/2017,"I am just floored by the arrogance of management and the incompetence of staff their...bison burger was amazing but not enough to ever waste another dollar in their business.  This is why they are always hiring and why so many of their staff seem so far gone in candy land, uninformormative and completely unprofessional.  If it had zero star option I'd give that and what Bar doesn't serve vodka redbull #1 Bar drink in the area cheap and super easy not even management could screw it up."
Mark R.,"McMinnville, OR",74,42,46,4.0,4/29/2016,"A quick bite of lunch and a business meeting brought me to BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse, and the food will definitely bring me back. When I first looked at the menu I noticed the shear volume of the document, and thought to myself, will this be like so many places, that hide mediocre food amongst a gazillion choices on their menu? Thankfully that was not the case here. I kept it pretty basic and ordered the clubhouse sandwich with wedge cut fries. Both were delicious, and everyone else at my table seemed to be pleased with their choices as well. A few more trips into this establishment will ultimately tell the tale of their food quality and consistency, but at least this visit provided enough good will to assure I'll try it a few more times to see if BJ's has what it takes to make the regular rotation whenever I'm in Eugene."
Trew M.,"Eugene, OR",0,20,,3.0,1/29/2017,The barbecue Bison Burger is nothing to brag about. It's the worst bison burger I have ever tried. The atmosphere was more tasteful than the food.
Marty C.,"Arvada, CO",45,90,73,3.0,7/16/2015,"Service was good, and our server was pleasant and attentive.  Our Mediterranean pizza looked lovely and featured a nice mix of ingredients.  Unfortunately, it was extremely salty.  We also had cantina chicken flatbread, which was also very salty.  I thought the chicken was nicely seasoned but not evenly distributed.  The edges were crisp, but the center was soggy.  I would be willing to try BJ's again, but probably wouldn't order these items."
Gregory M.,"Corvallis, OR",0,6,,5.0,1/16/2017,"We so impressed with our waitress. We so so excited. We ordered the deep dish pizza and let me tell you, It was delicious. The menus were very clean!"
Meagan D.,"Woodside, CA",8,18,,5.0,6/5/2016,"My friends and I always go to BJs when we go out for dinner because it's simply the best. It's a bit pricey for college students but of course that a corporate thing, not a this location thing, and honestly the food is worth it. I always leave full and satisfied. Their pizookies always make me return and anything I order is consistently good. It's usually a long wait (between 20-30 minutes) and they only have call ahead which is a bummer. Waitstaff is very nice though every time!"
Molli O.,"Eugene, OR",32,123,251,1.0,3/16/2014,"Tonight was definitely the last time I'll ever go to BJ's. I've given this place multiple chances and every single time their food has been awful. Completely lacking in flavor. They have so many items on their menu that all their dishes turn out basic and flavorless. To be blunt, it's some of the worst food in the chain restaurant business. Every time I've left this place I've felt like I was robbed. The prices are WAY too high to only take 2 bites of your food and push it aside. Which is exactly what I did tonight, took a bite and shoved it to the side. I couldn't even finish it! Go spend your money somewhere else."
Russell B.,"Arvada, CO",5,25,4,3.0,7/16/2015,"Had a gift certificate and ended up here to indulge in some corporate salt, sugar, and fat.  Ordered the Mediterranean and Cantina pizzas and...  oh my god, back off on the salt!  Their mediocre and low IBU beers can't even wash it down. Our waitress spent most of her time talking to a coworker; likely about existential philosophy or the Cavs heroic but ultimately futile performance in the NBA finals.  I can't say she had anything else more pressing to do. You can by their bland beer for $5.50 a pint, or pay $6.50 for a pint of decent beer. From the traffic, it seems that they have a focus group tested winner on their hands. The bar looks seriously pro."
