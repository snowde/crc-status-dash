Carmik T.,"Gilbert, AZ",67,382,737,5.0,6/26/2014,"Great service by Melissa. Can never go wrong ordering anything they have to offer on the menu. Strawberry lemonade is very refreshing. A little to sweet for me- but if you can ask for a glass of water , you can adjust it to your taste ( also last longer that way too).. This time we had the Cajun Pasta, I suggest getting it with the shrimp. It was very good!  When we travel we always try to check & see if there is a BJ's in the area.  With all the meal options that fits everyone's appetite , great service- the quality & quantity for the $ is ""spot on"" & not to mention the vast bar selections: it's well worth it!! We have never had a bad experience! Highly recommend you check it out!"
Margarita R.,"Eugene, OR",24,3,,2.0,8/23/2015,"Asked for a non alcoholic drink. Got few suggestions, then I asked for ginger beer. And after having drinking half of it, I realize it was and alcoholic ginger beer.  Not happy. !!"
Michele S.,"Bend, OR",80,8,,1.0,7/17/2016,Changed your famous crust! HUGE mistake! We come here from 3 hours away for this amazing pizza. Such a disappointment!:(
Sharon H.,"Springfield, OR",1,25,8,5.0,8/17/2015,"Taken there for Mothers Day, my choice because if you search you will see I have visited before giving a four star rating. I was so disappointed this trip. I actually ordered the chicken wraps because the last time I had them there, they were outstanding. This time I could have cried. The lettuce on prior visit was a very crisp butter lettuce .. this time wilted ice berg. This visit the chicken filling was served floating in some kind of oily stuff compared to a beautiful mixture not floating last time. There was a sauce served this time on the side that tasted like vinegar and soy sauce ... Previous visit there were three different side dips. On the up side the waitress was wonderful, smiling even tho very busy. The other five in our party thought their food was average. Won't be going back there for our special occasions. After posting my first review the manager contacted me and went out of his way to correct the mistakes from previous review. So I went back tonight to give it another chance. We had a wonderful experience tonight. Some of the best beer I gave ever had. The food was excellent and the waiter went out of his way to take care of us. This was before I ask to visit with the manager, who was excellent!! So glad we went back! Changed my one  to . If you have a problem speak up, because the manager wants to make everything right. They are back to serving the chicken wraps in utter lettuce."
Liz R.,"Eugene, OR",0,3,,1.0,1/12/2017,Never again - this was a once and done. $9 for a small cocktail - Clam Chowder's main ingredient was salt and lots of it - awful! Chili kinda sucked. Their menu is way too big for them to be good at all of it - maybe they are good at some of it but not tonight. My friend's sandwich was soggy; service was lacking. My advice - go elsewhere; anywhere!
Ralph W.,"Washington, DC",0,3,,5.0,7/11/2016,"I sent this letter to GM Henderson via mail but just in case he never received my letter I decided to post this.  I am writing to express my appreciation for the excellent customer service my family received during our visit to BJs the week of June 12th in celebration of my niece graduating from the University of Oregon. Manager Zach B. was able to accommodate our large party on short notice and during a busy lunch rush.  He even sent over complimentary appetizers for our table which added a nice unexpected surprise.  Tiffany H. was our waitress and she was nothing short of outstanding. She made sure that everything ran smoothly by knowing the menu and confidently making menu suggestions to my family members who could not make up their minds or kept changing their orders.  All of Tiffany's recommendations turned out to be perfect. Our first trip to BJs was made all the better because of our waitress Tiffany whose attentiveness was exemplary along with her friendly smile. She was there when we needed her but allowed us to enjoy our meal. All of my family members enjoyed a very pleasant and relaxing experience thanks to BJs very friendly and professional staff.  Not to mention, the delicious food! Marie Roberts Clifton, VA"
Jeremy G.,"Eugene, OR",8,51,11,4.0,7/2/2015,"Great service, great atmosphere and good food.  The wait staff was friendly, prompt and attentive. The hostess noticed our hungry/cranky son and brought over crayons and crackers without us asking. The food came relatively quick and our waitress was fantastic. And this was all while they were packed.  Only downside is the size of their menu. It's too big, which made it overwhelming and difficult to decide."
D'arcy M.,"Eugene, OR",0,5,3,4.0,10/21/2015,"Love this place! Great salads, soups, pizza... You name it! Good service and prompt. Chicken tortilla soup is my fav! Fresh avocados!"
Marsha B.,"Eugene, OR",0,7,,2.0,4/30/2016,"I had a barbecue chicken salad for lunch a few days ago that was a total disappointment. First of all, the bowl was filled with mainly chopped not-that-fresh lettuce. The pieces of chicken were about the size of dice and were few, a few black beans were scattered among the lettuce, there may have been a few small chunks of tomato and that was about it. Barbecue sauce on the chicken? Virtually nonexistent. The price for this? About $12.00. I've had better salads from fast food restaurants."
Audra B.,"Albany, OR",28,121,68,4.0,1/1/2015,"BJ's is now our go-to place for Duck games. You can always find a seat, they turn on the sound with the games, and you can see a TV from nearly every seat. I enjoy the food and their selection of beer is good. Their prices are a little high, especially for their specialty cocktails, but if you catch them during happy hours prices are great. I have had a couple bad experiences here, but one of those times I wrote to BJ's using their customer feedback on their website and they were really great about responding to my email.  The staff are a gamble, but most of the time they're pleasant. It's usually the hostesses that seem to have bad attitudes, but that may be due to their age (typically very young girls). The wait staff are typically consistent, good, and friendly!"
Kell M.,"Eugene, OR",1,35,3,4.0,5/9/2016,"Good service here, the Pink Cadillac I ordered was delicious and fruity, and the clam chowder was very creamy and flavorful. At the end of my meal, the waitress gave us new soup to take home instead of my soggy cracker soup. Very impressed! Will return, ESPECIALLY for another amazing pizookie! The cookies n cream is amazing and a new favorite!!"
Kalub H.,"Keizer, OR",83,122,22,4.0,7/24/2013,"BJ's!! This place is kinda like Chile's... but with pizza... and lots more beer to choose from... and way better food... and better staff... and better benefits for staff.... Anyways!  They just recently opened a new location at Valley river center and its Bea-U-tiful, rumor has it they spent 2.5 million on the bar alone and 6 million on the new location.  They staff is awesome. They gave out free food for two weeks before it opened. It seems like they're pretty on top of it.  They one down side is they're a little on the pricey side of things. I don't think you'll be disappointed though."
Katherine S.,"Springfield, OR",21,62,54,4.0,1/6/2016,I love the calamari and the burgers. Service can be a little slow but they are always nice
Mark A.,"Cincinnati, OH",44,341,233,3.0,7/4/2013,"My darling wife and I have visited both BJ's locations in Eugene now. It's a step up from the usual chain restaurant experience, and a nice way to eat during a shopping excursion, but hardly destination dining. The menu is huge, a dozen pages-plus of pizza, sandwiches, entrees, lunch specials, drinks and desserts. I think it must be unwieldy to manage a kitchen with so many options, and our experience is evidence of just that. The waitress punched in the wrong drink order in the POS, and had to retrieve another beer from the bar. The kitchen made our spicy meatball pizza with a deep dish crust when we ordered hand-tossed thin crust, but the mistake was spotted before it was served, and the waitress took our salads off the bill to make up for the delay. If it's not clear yet from the reviews, this is a brew pub with its own line of beers on tap. Like Gordon Biersch the beers are not made on the premises, but at a remote brewery under private label. That's not necessarily bad, but don't go expecting hopheads at the bar to expound on which region is best for Cascade growing. MDW liked her porter, and I liked my amber ale, but they weren't transcendent experiences. The atmosphere is clean, polished and corporate. The bathrooms are immaculate and high-tech. The staff has the affected courtesy you expect from a chain. It's quite popular as well. Even though we were very late for lunch (or early for dinner if you prefer), the place was fairly busy, and only became more so as we sat. It will be crazy once football season and Christmas roll around."
Steve R.,"Penn Valley, CA",20,70,1,4.0,2/6/2016,"Wow, does this place get a range of reviews! It was a packed Friday night, and the place was hopping! We were seated within 15 minutes, and our server quickly got our beverage order. The menu is huge, with something to please everyone. We ordered a tavern pizza (thin crust) and it was delicious. Other items included the seared ahi salad, clam chowder, and small trees salads. All were excellent! We really felt the service was perfect!"
Blair Z.,"Millbrae, CA",2,28,2,1.0,8/8/2016,"Long story short both of the seating hostesses were very rude when my friends and I went in last night. All my friend asked was if we could sit in the bar area and after my friend started walking towards there, one of the girls made a nasty face and her and the other seating hostess starting giggling. I don't see what's so funny about someone asking if they can sit somewhere because clearly those two ladies weren't the least bit interested in doing their job. It was extremely unprofessional and it pissed me off. And when we sat down, the lady that made the disgusting face sat down at a table near us and when more guests entered the restaurant, she said very loudly ""oh great more people"" in the most sarcastic way possible. No excuses for rude, unprofessional people. If you can't handle doing your job in a professional and polite way, don't come to work."
R T.,"Oakland, CA",7,33,3,3.0,2/10/2015,"Good corporate food, some interestingly presented food, pizza stands and a rushed service. Ridiculously over priced for a bill with no alcohol. Desserts are okay cobbler is a over done pancake in a circular tin.  I would not recommend this place to any ""foodies"" any one who doesn't cook would love it..."
Kristy W.,"Eugene, OR",288,414,437,4.0,7/8/2013,"I would have to say this is a big step up in the right direction. For starters it has more room, very friendly and attentive staff and centrally located. The other location I didn't rate so high because it was always a pain to park, a pain to wait, the food was just ok to me. I came here the opening week and had a very pleasant dining experience, the food was top notch! I had a rib eye steak with the red wine sauce and the horse radish mashed potatoes. Let me tell you! Hello fatty put down the fork! I could not stop taking bites it was so flavorful. I will be back for sure and can't wait to try other menu items. Way to step up your game Bj's! Sorry I'm not doing 5 star because its not sit down candle lit but I would say its 4 in a half with the steak. I have gone back and tried other menu items and I have to say I am quite pleased! I tried the encrusted chicken Parmesan which I have ordered quite a few times now and I'm not a chicken fan. I also like the balsamic chicken. These are not bland items. I see so many people comment that the food here is bland well these are not! They are quite full of flavor! Some times I'm forced into a pazookie and those pack some flavor too!"
Allison M.,"Happy Valley, OR",6,29,15,1.0,7/18/2014,"What's up with the attitude of these people? From the person who answered the phone for the pre-order to the hostess and waiter, the servers act is if you're lucky to eat here. The food is really just ""ok"". It's a basic chain. Nothing to get excited about. But great service and happy people can make you want to go back to a place even when the food is sub par.  We had a table of 8 with 3 kids. They didn't give us a children's menu and when we told the server he just rattled off some items. He told us fries were the only side. It didn't seem right to me. I got all the kids a menu after he left and saw there are actually 8 side options and half are actually healthy and all the others were better than fries. I don't get it. Was it too much work to let them choose something else. I don't really care. I'm just not coming here again."
Lori S.,"Eugene, OR",120,114,94,3.0,12/15/2015,"The food is pretty decent, all around. I quite enjoy the soup & salad and there is a yummy chicken bowl w mashed potatoes on the lunch menu that is reasonably priced. I am really picky about fish & chips and theirs were some of the worst I've ever had-- greasy w thick batter I had to scrape off. The bar is really nice, but the drinks are average (read: corporate--don't expect a stiffie here) and the wine list is completely disappointing. No wines to savor and none on tap. In this day and age having a ""nice"" red and a white on tap is such a bonus for the customer. You should be able to order a nice (fresh) glass for $5/6/7 IMHO. Ahhhhh, but I digress. I didn't take away a star because of it, as this is a chain restaurant. Play it safe and get a Jerry Burst; blend of Jeremiah Red (30%) and Berry Burst Cider (70%). I can't remember the manager's name, (maybe John?) but he is truly awesome-- very friendly and very helpful. I'd come back just because of him."
