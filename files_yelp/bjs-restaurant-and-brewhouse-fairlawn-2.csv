Deepak R.,"Hudson, OH",3,111,2,5.0,12/10/2017,Very nice place. Luved the bar atmosphere. Enjoyed watching the ball game. The wines and the food selections were amazing. Very friendly staff. Special thanks to Jill for being a great host. Will definately come back. Would highly recommend this place.  Thx DR MD
Rick H.,"Richfield, OH",7,78,43,5.0,10/8/2017,My wife and I had dinner at BJ'S. I used their app to do call ahead seating. We walked in and we're seated right away. Everything worked like is supposed to.  I had two Piranha drafts and we both had the salmon and keanwa.  The food was great and the service was excellent. The salmon was cooked perfectly.  This is definitely a great spot for great beer and great food.
Holly Y.,"Akron, OH",55,107,207,5.0,11/25/2017,"Admittedly, we were very excited about the opening of BJ's Brewhouse but our excitement was short lived after eating here several times after opening and being unimpressed with sub-par food and what I found to be unappetizing menu selections. However, a little over a year and a half later, I must admit that both the menu selections and the quality of the food has taken a huge turn for the better. I enjoy their weekend prime rib special, Parmesan crusted chicken, and the Oreo pizookie is not to be missed. Very much improvement!"
Paul J.,"Canton, OH",0,37,,4.0,1/5/2018,"I'll admit, I was skeptical about this place at first, especially with such a robust menu, but I was happily surprised. Great selection and great food!"
Chris F.,"Tallmadge, OH",18,29,22,3.0,1/6/2018,"Our third time here in the last year was disappointing. Confused staff at the door were slow to take names, get people to their tables. Finally an unapologetic staff member said we and others were free to sit in the bar area and could enjoy half off appetizers and drinks there. Once seated, waitress there said that no, those specials don't don't count on weekends. Later resolved - deals during NFL games- but staff were clearly confused. Mixed drinks were loaded, overflowing with ice- remember that from the last visit- so any ""deal"" was meaningless. Tortilla soup heavy on gelatinous, salty broth. Burger in oversized bun, root beer riblets unremarkable. This place is crowded but felt very ""chainy"" tonight ( not always the case w chain restaurants). Across the street is Rays Place- in retrospect the local place we should have gone to."
Craig C.,"Akron, OH",0,1,,1.0,1/6/2018,This place is absolutely ridiculous! We (a party of 3) checked into BJ's at 6:24pm with an expected wait time of 30-40 minutes. After waiting for 50 minutes we asked how much longer and we were told 10 more minutes. After waiting about 15 more minutes we decided to leave because we still were not called. People who arrived way after us were seated before us as well. We then received a text on your phone at 7:58pm saying they were ready to seat us. This place should get their check in system figured out. Very unorganized!
Ashleigh G.,"North Royalton, OH",30,104,529,5.0,4/12/2017,My parents took me BJs on a Saturday for lunch. The restaurant is huge and equipped with a full bar and ample seating. BJs was busy but we were seated right away and greeted by our waitress. There were so meal options I was overwhelmed but in a good way. I wish I could have sampled everything! My parents and I chose stuffed mushrooms as our appetizer and burgers for our meals. The food was cooked to perfection and I was sad when the meal was over. My only complaint is about the waitress. We had to ask her for refills and another server for other items that we needed. All in all a good experience and I am looking forward to going back!
Tammy Jo F.,"Cuyahoga Falls, OH",73,144,63,4.0,10/17/2016,"I worked late on a Wednesday night and stopped at BJ's for dinner and to avoid traffic in the Valley during rush hour.   I love the atmosphere here... dimly lit, chalk board beer lists, higher-end sports bar feeling, ample televisions.  I was sad that my husband wasn't able to join me since we haven't eaten here before, but he worked late that night.   I sat at the bar and my server, Chelsea, was awesome!  She orchestrated my meal at a perfect pace for me.  She gave me great suggestions on appetizer sizes versus side-dish sizes. I ordered a glass of 14 Hands Merlot and a large deep-dish Five Meat pizza (extra cheese, please)!  I was able to relax and unwind before my dinner was served.  The pizza was served and placed on a brushed nickel structural tripod that elevated the pizza above the table-top (allowing for extra room underneath).  When Chelsea placed the tripod on the bar in front of me I knew the pizza was going to be big!   I will admit now that I have always been a fan of Pizza Hut's ""former"" pizza crust.  It was a typical foccacia-type pizza crust.  The pizza dough at BJ's is made like foccacia, with olive oil - crispy outside and warm, fluffy goodness inside - like a pillowy respite for the toppings to lay their tired, protein-infused heads on prior to being devoured.  Was the sauce a little sweet for my taste?  Yes, but that's what sells today.  Happily the pizza sauce is NOT the star of the show here... the crust and toppings are! The happy hour specials here apply to ""good"" wines too (not just house wines).  I ordered the brussel sprouts for Ray as an appetizer and hauled the remainder of the pizza home for his dinner/lunch. Dessert?  Monkey Bread pizza-thingie with vanilla bean ice cream on the side.  A gooey, cinnamon, chewy carbohydrate mouth party that I thoroughly enjoyed."
Jordan K.,"Rocky River, OH",86,2,,3.0,11/24/2017,"Went at three for lunch after shopping.  Happy hour deals were good in the bar area.  Those with burgers enjoyed them and the guacamole was good.  Two in the group ordered a soup and salad combo for their lunch, which came out 5-10 minutes before everyone's meals.  We asked the waitress and she told us that the soup and salad always comes out first, which I understand if you order a starter salad or cup of soup but not a combo for a lunch.  This made our lunch a lot less enjoyable.  Otherwise the food was mostly good but not memorable."
Jennifer B.,"Akron, OH",170,201,154,3.0,11/14/2016,The parking here is very odd and scattered. The location is prime being right next to the mall.    The restaurant is large and a bit overwhelming. The bar was well stocked and very well organized. Though this was lunch so I could not partake in the beverages.  Our waitress was slow to get our orders but attentive otherwise. I had the seared Ahi Tuna salad. The cost was steep for the small amount of tuna...quite frankly disappointing. My salad was drenched in dressing...very soggy. I didn't really even eat half.  I checked out the happy hour menu and it wasn't overly impressive.
EspressoLvr S.,"Twinsburg, OH",0,16,18,5.0,4/13/2017,First time here. The BJ's PM Porter is outstanding. The BJ's Pumpkin Ale is outstanding as well!!!! So glad it is the last of the season that was still available to try! Food was extremely good. The spinach stuffed mushrooms were exceedingly good. The Root Beer Glazed Ribs were the BEST baby back ribs I have ever had in a restaurant. The Chicken Pot Stickers totally met our expectations. Service was SUPERB!!!!  Brook and Erin were our bar tenders/servers who took AWESOME care of our needs!!!! I would highly recommend BJ's Brewhouse which is new to the Fairlawn area.
Karl M.,"Orrville, OH",2,64,2,2.0,5/29/2017,"We went here last night, about 7:30. We were seated right away, no wait! Our waiter was Shannon, the menu is extensive, lots of choices in all categories. When the menu comes in a spiral binder it just says manufactured, portioned foodservice packs, prepared by less experienced people, ""food warmers"" using Turbo Chef microwave ovens. The service was sub par, we ordered a Supersalad with Cajun Shrimp, a glass of wine, a cup of hot tea, a bowl of claim chowder, and a Cesar salad, pretty simple. Our waiter Shannon didn't know anything about tea, we wanted decafe, he had to go ask someone else, he came back with Chamomile as a choice which we ordered. The wine arrived first with iced water, my wife declined the iced water and requested water no ice. Shannon reported all the mugs were dirty and needed to be washed, really who is running the back of the house,  no clean coffee mugs in a brew pub! 10 min. later the salads arrived, delivered by another good server, when the young server asked if we needed anything else, we replied with where's the hot tea? The young lady replied with a shrug of her shoulders "" I don't know you have to ask the waiter"" Wrong Answer, who is training these people?  Shannon came back and we asked about the tea, he replied he had to  push a tray of mugs into the dish washer, then asked what we were missing? The waiter should know what food arrives against what was ordered, we told him the soup! The tea arrives, I am already done with my salad which was okay, nothing to brag about. 3 min. past the soup arrives it isn't in a bread bowl like the picture in the menu and it is luke warm. If the soup is advertised in a bread bowl it should be served that way. If there is another option, the waiter should ask a qualifying statement like did you want it in a bread bowl or in a soup bowl? Then seconds later another bowl of soup arrives, which we didn't order, it is luke warm as well. If you are going for drinks, brews and the like this is probably a good place to go as they have a great selection,  the food is worth the price and the wait staff and back of the house are ill trained."
Anna N.,"Medina, OH",421,35,28,5.0,3/11/2017,Great food and great environment! This place offers a full menu that has literally every single food item you could possible imagine. The service is very good as well!  I usually am not a dessert person at restaurants but you cannot come here without getting the pazooki!
Lindsey S.,"Northfield, OH",24,213,207,3.0,6/29/2016,"I stopped here after reading other yelp reviews saying that this chain gets real busy around the standard eating times and the service gets real slow.  So we stopped in on a Saturday at 3:30 and everything was running smoothly.  I got tasters for all the beer I thought looked interesting.  It's sort of my hobby trying out breweries and sampling a lot of different kinds of beer, and these seemed very basic/safe.  If you are new to the beer world these would be the low key flavors you are looking for. But I really enjoyed the food.  I started with the Honey Sriracha Brussels Sprouts and they have awesome big flavor.  For my meal I got the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos which were tasty.  The meal came with a quinoa salad but I had no room for that after stuffing my face with everything else.  I would give a 3.5 if I could but am sad about the beer."
Scott J.,"Lake City, PA",0,5,1,4.0,5/15/2017,"This was a great place to eat when we stayed in Akron. They wait was short service was great, the beer selection was off the charts. Food was good but I think that was more on the selection then the food itself, we had deep dish pizza. It was ok, nothing exciting."
Mudit J.,"Akron, OH",0,5,,4.0,5/16/2017,Best brewery in Akron.. love the wheat beer here and pizza .. it's a nice place. Mondays they even have good offer on
Khloe S.,"Cuyahoga Falls, OH",141,155,60,3.0,3/30/2016,"Let me just start off by saying that I may be one basic-ass bitch, but I am a beer connoisseur. I originally came here because this was my late husband/s favorite ""All- American"" restaurant, but for a restaurant/ brewhouse that prides themselves on their craft beers... they kinda suck. Just being honest. I've tried a few things on the menu, and the Santa Fe egg rolls were pretty legit. The white cheddar mashed potatoes are pretty life changing, to be honest. All of their steaks are overly seasoned with sodium, and like I said previously... their beer kinda sucks. Many descriptions pride themselves on body and flavor, but I always find them to fall flat and short. Service is always hit or miss. You'll either get spot on service, or you'll see your server once or twice your whole meal."
Jodi L.,"Wooster, OH",69,66,6,5.0,4/3/2017,Menu is extensive. I recommend the flat breads. Beer options are impressive. Desserts are phenomenal- pizzookki?!?! Please excuse my spelling  but the smore  one is one of the best things on this planet. Great atmosphere too.
Cortney R.,"Akron, OH",204,199,66,3.0,2/29/2016,"I have a lot to say about BJ's. Let's start off with the walk from the parking spaces to the building. If you park across the driving path, be careful! The cars come flying down the ramp from the mall parking lot and we had a close call when we were trying to cross. I think maybe it would be a good safety practice to put up a speed limit sign or paint in a cross-walk so there are no accidents. Once we approached the door, we noticed that the main entrance is a revolving door. I know there is some kind of energy savings with a revolving door but this one is the stuff of nightmares. If the waiting room is crowded, there will be people standing on the inside of the revolving door so when you go through it, you can't exit easily. Now, there are handicapped doors available to the side of the revolving door so I strongly urge you to use them if the restaurant is busy.  When we entered, I walked up to the hostess and told her there were two people in our party and gave her my name. She wanted my first name, last initial, and my phone number. I looked at her puzzled and she said, ""Oh, the phone number is so we can text you when your table is ready. Sorry, I'm assuming you've never been here before?"" She was correct, I had never been there before so I think she should ask if we would like a text when our table is ready instead of demanding customer phone numbers with no preface.  We were told it would be a 30 minute wait but I don't think it was that long. When I got the text that our table was ready, I went back up to the hostess stand and she pointed behind her to the other hostess stand. Why two stands?? This is kind of confusing for a newcomer. So, the people at the second stand take you to your table. It takes up a lot of extra space that could be used to extra waiting room seating to eliminate the revolving door issue. Just sayin'. The host seated us at a cozy 2-person corner booth at the back of the restaurant. We were pretty happy about that! It was my husband's birthday so a little romantic spot to enjoy our meals was appreciated!  We looked over the drinks menu and ordered some unique brews. It's really cool that they have a lot of craft beers to choose from. They had a beer I had been looking for but hadn't ever found so I was very excited to order it. Next, we ordered our meals. I ordered the guacamole bacon burger and hubby ordered a different burger. The burgers came out and looked gorgeous! I really enjoyed my burger but it didn't enjoy me. Unfortunately, I was sick all night. I've never had a burger do me wrong like that, it was kinda disappointing because the flavor of the burger was pretty good. The fries were also good. I like the thin shoestring fries! I really wanted to order a salad from the healthier menu but I couldn't justify paying $14 for a salad. Overall, weird new experience. Not sure we'll be back. If you're that close to The Rail, you go to The Rail!"
Yvone R.,"Ravenna, OH",182,496,202,4.0,2/9/2016,"From the time hubby and I entered to the time we left, we were HAPPY!  The host was super friendly and seated us promptly.  Our waiter was quick and attentive.  He brought our drinks out fast, with care and always had refills for us.  The food was AMAZING!  I originally wanted to try the avacado wrap appetizer, but unfortunately, they were out.  We ended up ordering calamari.  It was cooked to perfection and tasted WONDERFUL!! Our meals were also cooked to perfection and tasted wonderful.  I got a burger and asked for medium.  They were RIGHT ON!  PERFECT and JUICY!!  Well seasoned. I did not visit the restrooms on this occasion, but the whole place screamed casual ambiance.  It was clean, neat and well decorated.  I can't complain about anything.  Why 4 stars you ask, if I liked it so much.  I really hated that we arrived at 11:30am, shortly after opening and they were already out of stuff.   So, in short, YES I would go back.  Worth the price.  Great service!  Great food!"
Cory K.,"Akron, OH",0,14,,3.0,5/8/2017,Food was really good but got skipped in line and ended up waiting nearly an hour to be seated. Hostess only calls name out once and it can be really hard to hear especially on a busy day.
Kris D.,"Southwest Garden, Saint Louis, MO",26,11,2,4.0,3/27/2017,Great service by Kirsten...good beer selection.  avocado egg rolls good....bison burger better
Richard B.,"Akron, OH",25,202,,2.0,8/22/2016,"For $25.00 I expected a killer pizza. I thought it would be drowning in toppings it was not. In actuality I've had very comparable $8.00 pizzas of the same size in recent memory,  so... Like the restaurant not the pizza so much."
Amanda H.,"Akron, OH",133,14,,3.0,6/18/2017,The food and service was subpar for the price you pay. Would recommend if you are wanting to grab drinks and appetizers. Great drink selection!
Michael V.,"Bath, OH",4,5,2,5.0,11/3/2016,I shared the Ahi tuna salad and Jambalaya! !!! Nothing short of spectacular like our Cleveland Indians! !!!
Michael S.,"Stow, OH",2,48,85,4.0,7/11/2016,"We tried this place as part of our #secondsaturday dinner group. We have seven couples that take turns selecting a new restaurant each month. Everyone liked what they ordered and as we pass around all the appetizers and share big plate items, I can say that I liked it all. I was enjoying my Piranha Pale Ale so potato skins and pizza seemed like the correct ""pairing"". The skins were cooked perfectly and the pizza was a good thick and soft crust that BJs is famous for. The service was good and pretty quick even considering our party of 12. It seemed like we had a team of servers. The big hit of the night was definitely the ""Beer Tasting"" were you get four choices of their house drafts. Bring the gang and prepare for a good time with good food."
Olivia R.,"Parma, OH",0,8,2,1.0,12/16/2016,"Absolutely horrible. First, took a while to get seated even though there were barely any people. Second, the waitress wasn't very nice and helpful. Third, the water tasted awful- like it wasn't filtered. Fourth, the food quality was very poor and not warm at all & no eating utensils were given. And lastly, the service was very slow. I waited for a salad for 30 minutes! Overall, it was the worst service & food I've ever had."
Maria W.,"Cincinnati, OH",16,10,8,1.0,1/16/2017,I've been to quite a few places for steak that l decided yesterday for my birthday I was going to get a ribeye from BJ's it was the worst piece of beef ive ever laid my lips are first they had to Bring me another state because the first one the girl asked me to cut into it the knife wouldn't even cut through the meat they bring me out a second one it's the same way the managers like well you clearly don't know how to code piece of steak if you have to saw through a piece of steak obviously it's not made properly
Dom C.,"Wadsworth, OH",1,30,,2.0,2/27/2017,Jambalaya is overpriced for what you receive. Flavor is bland as well. I did not have any beer so I cannot rate that aspect. The menu is expensive for average sports bar fare.
Tiffany K.,"Kent, OH",141,13,1,3.0,12/28/2016,"I've been to BJs two different times now and each time nothing has really stuck out to me. I love the different variety of beers but food seems to be so-so and overpriced. I got the black and blue burger, which was only 5 oz, kind of small for a burger and I ordered it medium rare and it came out medium well. my boyfriend ordered the baked ziti which was $15 and he said it was very good but the portion was SMALL. and we all know how cheap it is to make pasta. the pizookie are awesome! I doubt I would seek out BJs, the food is decent though. but if you want a good burger, go to the rail!"
Mike P.,"Akron, OH",4,22,36,4.0,1/14/2016,We went here for lunch. There was a short wait for a table. I ordered the brussel sprouts appetizer and they were very good. The wife who normally would not touch them also liked them a lot. For lunch I had the brisket bacon burger and it was incredible. She had the French dip and was very pleased with it as well. The fries were hot and crispy but could be better. Service was fast but expect about 45 minutes from the time you walk in until you walk out. The food is a bit on the expensive side $10 and up for burgers however the quality is certainly worth it. I plan on going back tomorrow. So I went back and had the double burger this time. Excellent but not as good as the brisket burger. Service was a bit slower but still above average. I will be a regular here for sure.
Nick D.,"Akron, OH",103,38,12,1.0,3/14/2016,"Awfully slow and terrible service. I had to repeat myself several times. Over an hour an a half on a Monday night for a salad and soup. By all means, please move at a glacial pace. The employees were more interested in having conversations and counting their tips than serving the customers. I had a reward and asked for it, took over 20 minutes. Will not be returning to this BJ's."
Jim S.,"Wadsworth, OH",15,10,1,2.0,8/11/2016,"Over hyped and overpriced. With all the food options available in the Montrose area this is not one that I will probably return to. I have given it a fair shot visiting 3 different times and had 3 different meals. While all the meals were palatable, the value just is not there. $14.50 for a flat bread pizza is ridiculous, and $12.50 for a burger and fries is also on the high side. Two out of the three times service has been sub par. Next time I want mediocre service and over priced food I will stop sooner and hit up Chili's"
Joshua H.,"Akron, OH",20,1,1,2.0,6/28/2016,"I wanted to love this place i did . And it had its good points . But average is the best i can say for 10 dollar sandwiches and more. My first trip and my food did not arrive as ordered. Management came to table didnt care just said "" it's not the waiters falt. Ill breing you cheese and yhe like so you can fix it"". And the came back to say he wanted to let me know he was not going to charge me for the missing items. Well thank you. The fries are good and the beer fair ."
Dan R.,"Akron, OH",5,12,,2.0,1/18/2016,"Went here for lunch. The food was mediocre.  Ordered calamari appetizer, it was burnt. Tried the deep dish pizza, was okay, completely forgetable.  Tried the four beer flight, nothing stood out and the red ale is near undrinkable. The service was borderline bad. Stood in line, when I finally got to the front, somehow the hostess missed me and helped the party behind me instead. My best guess is she thought I was with their family. Our waitress was okay, she was always on the run, didn't have any recommendations. She was really just going through the motions My whole experience was ""meh"". Much better choices in the area. Glad I tried it, probably will not go back."
Matt S.,"Akron, OH",2,258,61,3.0,4/14/2016,I didn't realize this is somewhat of a chain. Overall it was okay. Good beer selection. I got the Mac and cheese with chicken and siracha sauce. The cheese sauce was a bit thick and wasn't all that great but it was bad either. Also random note: anyone else think their logo is so blah and it appears that zero effort was put into the design of it?
Rick W.,"Brunswick, OH",40,206,16,4.0,11/7/2015,"BJs is pretty good. I've been here now twice. the first time was for lunch  and i had some chicken fingers and fries w/ a pumpkin ale.  Las night Danielle and i went for dinner.  She had the barbacoa chicken and i had the jambalaya. i used their Mobile app which made the whole process very convenient. i ordered, set my arrival time and paid (and received my royalty points) all from my app. very cool we were in and out in a half hour.  While our meals were good, the Honey, Sriracha Brussell Sprouts may have been the best appetizer I've ever had anywhere. so delicious."
Mark L.,"Medina, OH",1,5,,5.0,8/12/2016,"Great experiences in two visits. Food is excellent and service exemplary. Highly recommend the Sriracha Chicken Mac 'n Cheese or the Jambalaya. Large portions served hot. Sandwiches and burgers are also good. Deep Dish Ziti rocks too! Place is loud, but what sports bar isn't?"
Monica G.,"Akron, OH",8,5,,4.0,11/8/2015,"I had the pleasure of trying out Bj's Restaurant Brewhouse this afternoon. I ordered the gluten-free Santa Fe Salad. It was delicious, but I suggest ordering it with the dressing on the side. The salad was big enough for two meals.  Our server was great. She checked in on us many times. We were a party of three and after ordering it only took about 20 minutes for our food to arrive (the restaurant was packed).  I wasn't able to try one of their famous pizookies. The table near ours had one and it looked fantastic! I will save room next time."
Aaron B.,"South Daytona, FL",1,1,,2.0,10/31/2016,"This is a SERVICE based review. Our food and drinks were both good but our server, Bryan, was possibly one of the worst servers we've ever had. Not only did he wear his ""I dislike my job"" face, but also he treated us like we were interfering with his personal time. We had pizza with no plates, didn't hear the specials until we were ready to order, passed us 5+ times after we had asked for water and boxes without giving us either and made our overall dining experience bad. Would come back for the food but not for the service."
