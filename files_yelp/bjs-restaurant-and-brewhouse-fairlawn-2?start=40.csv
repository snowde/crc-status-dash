Jay L.,"Cuyahoga Falls, OH",21,43,4,4.0,7/30/2016,Met here for couples night out and it was our first time here. The menu was gigantic so there was something for everyone. The bar menu was very big also. Food was very good service was on point will go again.
Carol S.,"Akron, OH",6,100,17,4.0,1/23/2016,"Definitely the new ""It"" place in Akron/Montrose. Dropping by for a Friday lunch with a friend, we found the Summit Mall parking lot and restaurant full. Big space with a variety of seating options. We liked the small two-seater booth.  I enjoyed the clam chowder/chicken avocado sandwich lunch special. It was a bountiful taste treat, although the chowder was a bit too thick and lumpy.  The waitress was friendly, fast, and very busy.  I will be back to try out some of the large options of beer and other entrees. Nice addition to the area."
Jessica D.,"Akron, OH",5,45,1,3.0,1/15/2016,"I think it just depends on the staff you get. I look around and some waiters seem to be entertaining their guests but the few times I've been here I've had total duds for waiters.  Let's start from getting seating. I have an app that takes up precious space on my phone. However, I don't really know what signing in on the apps gets you. One time I signed in and the app said wait time 45 minutes. So in 30 minutes we left and came in only to be greater with okay so it looks like it will be an hour and twenty minutes. We promptly left. The next time we used it the wait time was correct however people who got there and put their name in were seated before us so I have to question what the app really gives you. Next the menu/food. Though the menu is large, half of it is booze- pricey booze. 6 bucks for a beer- no thanks. We ordered an app at 10 bucks a pop the most recent time, after waiting 40 minutes, yes after 40 minutes our waiter finally came over and we got to ask where our app was. He was surprised that it wasn't there so we just cancelled it. I guess the one good thing is they text you when your table is ready so you know how gruelingly long you've been waiting for to eat minus the time it took to order. The food that did come out was alright not great. We've had the burgers, the pizza, salads and the veggie burgers.  We would probably recommend the burger 1st but gee doesn't Akron have enough burger places already?"
Bob P.,"North Royalton, OH",16,11,6,5.0,11/15/2015,"Whoda thunk that a chain restaurant would serve some of the best chowder I've ever had. We decided to take a drive to Akron on an unusually warm November day to check out the newest brew pub in the area.  As a national chain, I didn't expect much...I was wrong. The place was hopping and they told us to expect a 20-minute wait.  No problem we planned to enjoy one of their branded brews while waiting.  But we didn't have a chance as we were paged in less that five minutes. Our server, Matt, appeared immediately and gave us a rundown of their own beers plus several from local breweries.  I ordered their Piranha Pale Ale and my wife had the Harvest Hefeweizen.  Both were tasty. I've had a tease for clam chowder for months so I decided to try theirs along with their pepperoni personal pizza (don't tell the trainer).  My wife ordered the Back and Bleu Burger. The chowder was the best I've had in years and the pizza was excellent.  My wife's burger was also first-rate.  You can't go wrong with any of these. The service was excellent.  Although the place was packed we didn't have to wait for anything. We'll be back."
Lisa L.,"Medina, OH",19,2,,1.0,8/9/2016,"The bathroom was disgusting filthy!!! Smudges on the stall walls, no toilet paper, only one of two faucets worked and that one did not work well! Only 2 of us, but I would prefer a table not a booth. Beer and food good."
Josh T.,"Akron, OH",0,5,,5.0,11/7/2015,"This was a great place for a date night. We had a pretty long wait, but who can blame them! It was the second week open and the food was amazing. Service was fantastic. They even text you when your table is ready. The greeters were welcoming; the servers were helpful and timely; the other staff checked on our table occasionally too!  Try the avocado rolls for an appetizer! I also got the bison burger which was the best ""healthy"" burger I've had in a while.  Great food. Great atmosphere. We will definitely be going back."
Heather B.,"Akron, OH",5,40,145,1.0,11/22/2015,"Service is absolutely terrible .... bartender was ""deathly ill"" who was making our drinks ..  Yeah, because that's comforting to hear.. .. but despite whatever kept the kitchen so so long to make our appetizer and cause multiple waitress to check on us, Hope was the best. She was really kind and sweet and friendly. I'll come back only because of her.. . ."
Jerome B.,"Mayfield Heights, OH",0,31,59,5.0,1/10/2016,"Jill was our bartender/waitress and was AWESOME as usual. ALWAYS FANTASTIC service!!!! The Tatonka Stout, Nutty Brewnette, PM Porter, Jeremiah Red, Hop Storm, Piranha, and Brewhouse Blonde as all great! BJ's has THE BEST RIBS ANYWHERE!!! The Northbeach  Mahi Mahi and shrimp was extremely good! Our boys had purchased a $100 gift card on line for Christmas, and we received an extra $25. Such a deal. We never regret coming here. Great service, good beer and excellent food!!!! $2.00 off appetizers during all pro games and $1.00 off beers even on Sunday's. GO CAVS!!!!!"
Sarah M.,"Fairlawn, OH",25,49,3,4.0,5/27/2016,We went to the grand opening for a free meal. The food was fantastic! Everyone at my table was happy with what they had. My father-in-law especially loved the brussel sprouts. I was most excited about the pizzookie. Great experience!
Adriane A.,"Fairlawn, OH",105,15,,4.0,9/17/2016,A very large menu and great food.  The avocado rolls are my favorite appetizer! Staff was great also.
Robin S.,"Tallmadge, OH",1,99,14,4.0,12/7/2015,Large dining area dominated by an attractive bar. Lotsa tvs showing games.  Crazy huge beer & mixed drink menu- it may be bigger than the food menu (which is also impressively large).  Friendly staff.  Our food was prepared to order and very tasty. We'll be back!
Heather R.,"Akron, OH",12,1,,1.0,11/11/2015,I've been to this restaurant four times since opening.  I am a huge fan of B.J.'s Brewhouse but this restaurant has some serious problems. Visit 1 - 2 people ordered veggie burgers.  Both were given turkey burgers even though veggie burgers had been rung in by the server Visit 2 was fine. Visit 3 - one person's order was never rung in Visit 4 - back to the turkey burger instead of veggie burger problem again. These were all lunch times so three of the four times people left with takeout food instead of eating in the restaurant even after being there for an hour.
Gahan A.,"Akron, OH",2,5,2,3.0,11/25/2015,"My bestie and I stopped by for the first time last night. Overall the experiance was just ok. The restaurant is new in our area so I would imagine the staff would be upbeat and pleasant but it seemed everyone was just going thru the motions...maybe they were just ready to go home, that's the feel I got. We were seated and quickly greeted by our waitress. She immediately rambled off 3 beers for recommendations, no ""hey, how ya doin'"", just straight to the drinks, names we've never heard or had any idea or detail about. We asked for a moment to decide and after browsing the extensive drink menu,  she did offer me a tester of a cider I was on the fence about. The Berry Burst Cider was pretty good, if you aren't really into beer try it.  We decided to order the lettuce wraps (meh), stuffed mushrooms (bland), root beer ribs and shrimp tacos. The Root Beer Glazed Ribs were sooo yummy. The sauce was sticky and sweet which I loved. You get 5 bones and they are the babiest babyback ribs, smaller than ribs in a kids meal, delicious nonetheless. We had to ask for small plates and silverware. All the food came out at the same time except for the tacos, which the waitress zoomed by and said will be it shortly. We ate and chatted patiently waiting...no tacos. Our waitress stopped by to get our empty plates and asked us did we get our tacos :(. After waiting almost 10 mins out came the tacos...the late, dry, flavorless tacos. Unapologetic about the late entrée, onto the sales pitch of 3 different desserts. Now this is where BJs did not miss! OMG the Pizooki Trio was amazing! You can choose your 3 which we had the seasonal Pumpkin, Salted Caramel and White Chocolate Macadamia Nut, each were heavenly. The waitress dropped off the bill with the dessert and said no rush enjoy.  So in all, the dessert is amazing, food is mediocre at best and service was as if waitresses no longer care about wanting tips."
Zachary F.,"Akron, OH",0,3,,1.0,11/5/2016,"The food has always been great, but the service not so good. Took both my 80 year old grandmothers out for dinner. I called ahead to so call make a reservation only to find out there really is no such thing. Called a half hour ahead of time, got to the place and had to wait another 45min. The hostess was rude, along with the managers. I asked for a seat to wait for my grandmother because she can't stand for a long time, only to be told yea if you can find one. I've loved both this location and the one in canton. Don't know if I'll be going back after such a horrible experience!!!"
Petey S.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",2,35,3,3.0,6/10/2016,"Burgers are great, but the fries are terrible. If you like really hard and crunchy skinny fries, you're fine, but if not, don't get fries. Overall not bad"
Carey M.,"Lebanon, TN",0,1,,1.0,3/20/2016,"Terrible bar! And the bartender said it himself ""we just have a basic bar here."" I asked for a Moscow Mule and he said it would be $12 bc they charge for each ingredient separate AND they don't serve it in a tin cup. Not that it's a huge deal, but that's part of that drinks schitck, especially if you want me to pay that much. So I asked for a rum and coke. No rum. I heard the lady beside me ask for several drinks and he kept turning her down, stating they didn't have those kinds of liquor. Another person on here commented on the parking, and they were right. It sucks. That's one of THE FIRST THINGS my friend and I said as we got out of the car. The parking sucks.  Food was good, can't complain about that. It was actually really good. But, probably won't go back since apparently the bartender only knows how to pour beer."
Rob P.,"Akron, OH",2,33,9,1.0,2/21/2016,"This place reminds me of Winking Lizard.  Long wait time, bad service, low quality of food, and noisy atmosphere.   I don't understand how places like this attract such large crowds, unless it's because of the beer.  10 minute wait became 39 minutes.  Very little attention from waitress.  Appetizer came out at same time as food, but there were 20 minutes of waiting without food.  Food was bland and flavorless.  Water glasses never refilled.  Waitress was devoid of personality, and it seems like she disliked us.  I begrudgingly tipped 15%, the minimum.  I can't think of why I would want to go back.  Hooley House is a better choice."
Vinnie H.,"Akron, OH",0,5,,3.0,5/10/2016,"We've gone here several times since it opened late last year. Food is a 6 out of 10, food prices are a little steep as well, service is a 4-1/2 out of 10. No management visible, walking through the restaurant to check on your dining experience. Noise level and music too loud for a pleasant dining experience."
Michele H.,"Akron, OH",29,2,,1.0,3/2/2016,"I wish I could give them negative stars. We went and sat there for 15 minutes with out any coming up to us. Not a I will be right there not what can I get you to drink. Even on a Saturday night that is ridiculous, I feel that we were over looked because we were a 2 top.  Then when I went to leave and complained I was asked by the manager to stay and he would make sure I got my food fast.  Really that's all you  got.  No thanks."
Patti H.,"Medina, OH",0,5,4,4.0,2/6/2016,Fun place server was great. Had deep dish pizza and burger. S'mores dessert was the bomb. Pleasantly surprised for chain restaurant
