Mike N.,"Paris, France",0,1,,1.0,10/30/2015,"I have a group of 12, so no simple request on an opening weekend. I called ahead and spoke with a staff member who informed me that they don't take reservations until after 2 weeks of being open . understandable, so I ask if they think there is a chance they could accomodate. Without hesitation the staff member says ""yes come over and we can get you in"". I arrive and am told it would be a 3 hour wait..... and get a look like I am stupid for even being there. Not a great first impression..... as I was leaving to try and find a place for 12 again, I hear the staff making snarky comments.... A lot of things will need to change before I dare try this place again. Too bad, it looked like it might be good."
Jim H.,"Akron, OH",0,3,,5.0,12/19/2015,"Came for lunch Saturday before Christmas.  The place was packed, we sat at a high top at the bar.  Great service by Ashley! Loved the Bison burger and Piranha Pale ale. Wife had shrimp and asparagus penne which she liked but very saucy.  Nice atmosphere."
Amy B.,"Akron, OH",1,2,,1.0,11/21/2015,"Love the BJ'S  location in columbus...... the locarion by Summit Mall needs to work on their customer service! We sat at a high top table in the bar for over 5 minutes on a Saturday afternoon  and we were completely and rudely ignored by several servers.  The couple at the table next to us was also upset by the extremely inattentive service.  I asked the hostess if i could speak to a manager and of course, they did not come over.  Needless to say we left and will not be returning."
Scott M.,"Akron, OH",0,19,22,2.0,2/28/2016,"Beer seemed a little flat and watery.  Appetizer combo was not bad.   Not a bad place but he wait time is outrageous.  Sit at the bar if possible. Can back on a Sunday night and the service was bad.  Sat in the bar area and it took forever to get someone to clear the table.  Waitress was nice and tried her best but the food took a loooooong time, yet the place was only 3/4 full.   Waitress just apologized for the poor food service.  Kudos to her.  Management, sucks.  Plain and simple.  The two times here, I feel the managers are clueless as to what is happening.  Sorry BJ's but you need to look at your operations here in Fairlawn. Gave you two shots and that is it!  Nice try."
Jeff O.,"Richfield, OH",0,5,,1.0,6/12/2016,"My family and I drove 30 long minutes to come and enjoy the delicious smores dessert. I was devastated to learn that the smores dessert as been obsoleted from the menu. As Mr Wonderful would say, you are dead to me."
Bill G.,"Akron, OH",0,4,,1.0,3/26/2016,Average at best. Still trying to figure out why they asked how I wanted my burger done... asked for rare and got bone dry well done. The cheese was all balled up on 1/4 of the burger. The itsy bitsy thin fries were pretty much cold by the time they arrived at the table. We had to ask for a napkin and silverware when our server checked back to see how the food was!  All in all a very poorly run place! I can only imagine they were half busy because they're still fairly new? It was our first visit and will most likely be our last! Blah...
Joyce B.,"Akron, OH",0,3,,2.0,8/10/2016,Terrible service.  I don't think they train their wait staff.  We waited 12 minutes to get our water and they never dropped off menus.
L Ann S.,"Cuyahoga Falls, OH",0,8,,2.0,8/12/2016,"Met friends here last evening for dinner.  We had reservations and our table was ready.  That was the best part. The service was not good: - 4 of us were served food that was barely warm.  Since 2 meals were hot, it seems 4 meals sat under the warmer lights waiting for the 2 additional meals.  The flavor was decent, but barely warm food is not appealing to me. - 1 did not like her meal, but maybe she just ordered the wrong thing, which all of us do at times. - While we were eating, the restaurant filled up with a fairly long waiting line - We finished our meals and waited for our server - We waited for our server longer - We finally flagged down another server and asked for our server - Finally our server came and we asked for our checks and a box - Still waiting for our server - All this time there were people waiting to be seated - After about 15 minutes we paid and left - I mentioned to the hostess that the service was lacking.  I didn't get a warm and fuzzy feeling that things will improve."
Tony R.,"Stow, OH",0,1,,1.0,1/20/2016,"I had called to make a reservation and the girl took my information, she said a manager would call me back to confirm.  One day later and no phone call- I call back only to be told they are fully booked on the day I wanted.  It would have been nice if they told me when I called that they were booked instead of getting my hopes up. I was really looking forward to trying this place out but I will be taking my wedding party elsewhere- and most likely never going there.  Not impressed."
Sarah B.,"Barberton, OH",71,8,,4.0,1/20/2016,"The food was awesome.  I feel as if I tried one of everything.  Shared an appetizer sampler which was nice to get a little bit of each taste.  Decided on a deep dish pizza because they were half off for a mini.  I wished the server would have told us that to begin with.  Dessert was amazing.  I went with the pb smores, and it didn't disappoint.  Nice atmosphere with a huge selection. It's not a place for someone who can't decide."
Dan C.,"Munroe Falls, OH",1,48,8,4.0,12/5/2015,Nice place  it was crowded  but not bad the service was better then most restaurant's. And the food was very good
Philip M.,"Canal Fulton, OH",13,4,3,4.0,11/8/2015,"Great selection of draft beers and cocktails. Menu has a lot to chose from ranging from soup and salad to deep dish pizzas, and of course, burgers. Great place to catch the big game and to take the family. Download the app and order ahead."
Cathy B.,"Akron, OH",11,6,,2.0,8/19/2016,Why cant you find a place thats good every time?  like.. you can count on it.  I went here 2x and it was great.  The last time I went was enough to never go back. Service was horrible food wasnt the best. Its a shame. Everyone kept telling me that they weren't impressed and I couldn't figure out why.  Now I know :(
Kevin F.,"Des Plaines, IL",40,62,81,3.0,12/24/2015,This place was recently opened in Akron and I decided to give it a try.  BJ's offers about 12 homemade beers in a variety of styles and flavors from hefeweizens to IPA and even a holiday cider. The menu aims to be a cut above standard bar food (think siracha infused brussel sprouts) but  wound up being just okay. I had the parmesan encrusted chicken prepared with heart stopping quantity of butter. The chicken was a little underdone; unfortunately I didn't discover this until well into my dish. The server and manager were gracious enough to remove my dish from the bill. Excellent service all around and decent beers. I'd probably dine elsewhere in the future.
Kevin G.,"Independence, OH",14,52,92,2.0,1/2/2017,allot of brews great selection prices are good too good is kinda pricy for what it is but the service needs allot of improvement. we first asked for a high top at bar area it was dirty the hostess said they would clean it they didn't we ended up sitting at bar 15 mins later!! ordered first round no problem asked for second round waited 30 mins with hardly anyone at the bar and then had to remind bartender of the drinks then ordered food at time if receiving second round of drinks then 30 mins later asked what i wanted to eat after i placed order 30 mins before this never putting it in... service is terrible needs to be improved and the garbage can in front of the place over flowing with garbage .. that should of been a warning sign when we first got there!  this place is new but staff is lazy! go else where!!! i will never go there again! all this and we spent $70 here.. terrible !! we have eaten at lower class places with 100% better service and much lower prices
Claire R.,"Medina, OH",0,13,3,4.0,1/20/2017,"This was fun. Parking is horrible. There is literally no where to park where you aren't walking across a driving path, afraid of being hit. We were told it would be a 20-25 minute wait. They took my cell# and I rec'd a text saying it would be a 25 min wait. TWO minutes later I rec'd a text saying my table was ready! It's a noisy restaurant with high ceilings and many tvs. The menu is many pages long, with 40 choices of beer on tap, I had an Irish Root Beer - excellent! I ate the grilled chicken alfredo and my daughter had the roast beef dip. Both were excellent and of good portion size. The service was slow, the waiter lacking skills. I asked for water; he brought one, for me; none for my daughter. When our drinks were empty he asked if we wanted refills. I would have had a 2nd, different drink, had he stuck around for my entire answer. When I answered no for a refill, he not only took off, lightning fast, but left the empty glasses on the table. He did return to ask if we wanted dessert. We declined and he left to get the checks. But, again, he left the dirty, empty plates on our table. After I paid and we left, the dirty, empty plates and glasses were still on the table. He never removed either of them. We will return, because everything except the waiter was wonderful."
Aaron A.,"Cleveland, OH",20,17,1,3.0,11/24/2015,"Great beer selection and some really good apps.  Not a fan of the ""tacos"" because the shell is pita bread, no thanks. Deep dish pizza is more bread than cheese.  Pulled pork was good and also the Root Beer glazed ribs.  I plan on going back again for their beers and apps."
Holly M.,"Akron, OH",0,15,13,1.0,4/10/2016,Tried to eat here Friday night but it was a 90 minute wait. So I didn't eat here I do have to say the revolving door to enter is crazy. I watched two people get run into as other people were exiting the door. There is not enough room in the entry way to have this type of door.
Renee R.,"Massillon, OH",2,1,3,5.0,11/1/2015,"I really enjoyed everything i had eaten! I had the pulled pork sandwich and it came with fries and coleslaw.  Everything tasted fresh like it was made that day. The atmosphere is nice as well, the ceilings are really high so its not too noisy. The staff was very friendly and trained well for only being open a few days."
Brandon F.,"Fairlawn, OH",1,15,1,4.0,12/13/2015,Went on Friday night and it was packed!! We used the BJ app. to get preferred seating but still waited about 35 minutes for a table. Our server was Matt and he was awesome!!! Gave our table a lot of attention and kept the drinks coming!! Food was great an everyone in our party enjoyed their meals. Reasonably priced and we can't wait to go back!! Great atmosphere!!
