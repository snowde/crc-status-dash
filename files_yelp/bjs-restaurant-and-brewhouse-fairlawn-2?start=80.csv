Tamara M.,"Cleveland, OH",9,25,3,5.0,10/28/2015,"Literally their 3rd day being open and this is officially my husband's and my spot! We had the buffalo chicken mini deep dish pizza which was pretty decent for deep dish. The barbecue, buffalo and ranch mixture was interesting and delicious. We also had the new sriracha chicken bacon Mac and cheese which is absolutely a must have, considering the perfectly al dente pasta and perfect proportion of bacon and broccoli. Even more so, the decadent macadamia nut pizookie came highly recommended and is confirmed by this casual couple! Lol! As with any three day open, there were hiccups such as slower service, only one olive in my dirty martini that they couldn't balance on a tray, and a few other  awkward moments. However, the casual yet upscale ambiance of the restaurant is fitting for the area and incredibly welcoming. This chain is definitely recommended and is worth the slightly higher than average pricing."
Jennifer B.,"Akron, OH",33,16,3,2.0,3/30/2016,"I have been here twice. The first time was New Year's Day and even on the front door it said that they were open until midnight. We arrived around 10:45 because I was starving and had gotten off of work early. The girl who was the hostess told us that they were closing in a couple minutes and they were not seating new customers. She walked away without apologizing and we just stood there kind of questioning the door.. They had just opened a couple months prior.. Shouldn't they know their holiday hours? The manager came over and apologized and seated us and then proceeded to tell us the specials, walked away.. And no one came back for 15 minutes. Food was mediocre for how expensive some of the dishes are. Second time around I went with the same person, my fiancé, and I was just grabbing something small for lunch. My fiancé wasn't getting anything because he had eaten prior so he just got a water. No one wanted to help us at all. Service was so terrible that I did not leave a tip. I got my food before we got our drinks, which was just 2 pops which is ridiculous that the kitchen made an entire plate of food, another waitress came by and dropped it off and then about 30 minutes after we first ordered our drinks, they finally came. I was halfway through my meal. I'm honestly not sure if I would want to come here again for good service, because they are definitely lackluster in that area. Save your money and go somewhere nicer in Fairlawn."
Thom K.,"East Sparta, OH",0,3,,1.0,12/5/2015,"So I used the BJ's mobile app to register my party and the app responded with an 85 minute wait. Not bad since I had a 45 minute drive to the restaurant. When we arrived we were told that the computer had crashed so I had to give my name for the wait list and my cell # for a text when my table was ready, and a 30-45 minute wait. After 30 minutes I was told that it would be 30 more minutes. After 30 more minutes I was told it would be 15-30 more minutes. Luckily for me, the 3rd person in our party had arrived before us and put her name in and after a 90 minute wait we were seated. I never did get that text I was promised. We could have left but we were all interested in how it would play out. Not even an apology! The host was of no help, the manager was of no help. The waiter was great, the food was very good (or were we just very hungry?). I would be leery of trusting the app, maybe call ahead instead. Any way you look at it, I can't recommend BJ's."
Linda M.,"Franklin, TN",0,4,,3.0,3/2/2016,Food is good! Service is very slow & wrong order keeps coming to our table. Not a good management.
Tim D.,"Akron, OH",0,31,,2.0,11/20/2015,Went there for lunch for my birthday and i was not impressed at all.  I ordered a beer & they were out off it and i. Ordered  a vodka & tonic which wasn't bad but i saw our drinks just sitting at the bar for way to long. I ordered the prime rib dip.. The waitress then came over and said they were out of the bread for the sandwich and ask if  they could put it on a hamburger bun; the food was good. But how do you run out of stuff in the middle of the week? My brother ordered another beer and that like our drinks before just sat at the bar. After we said we didn't want desert they just brought the bill didn't even ask if I wanted another drink. The all around service needs  major improvement
J W.,"Wadsworth, OH",1,15,7,4.0,1/9/2016,Call ahead is 30 minutes in advance. Called about 30 minutes before our arrival and was sat immediately. Which was nice because they were packed. They have a LARGE MENU which normally makes me nervous. My Wife got the baked zitti and it was great. I got the fish and chips. It was OK but wouldn't get again. Food is good. Nothing spectacular but good for the price. I would recommend and return
Jackie G.,"Stow, OH",27,4,,5.0,1/14/2016,"Went to BJ Brewhouse today for lunch.  A TWO hr lunch.  Terrible service, waited 45 minutes for two sandwiches.  Our server never offered us refills on ice tea.  When food did come out, not hot.  Manager came over apologized and got us fresh plates.  Never offered to comp our meal.  Need to learn how to make customers want to come back.  Not impressed, won't go back!"
D L.,"Akron, OH",0,5,,3.0,1/14/2016,"The food was okay. The atmosphere, vibe and staff were fabulous. Wasn't impressed with the food or I would've given it 5 stars."
Bridget M.,"Solon, OH",1,14,,2.0,12/6/2015,"I heard about BJ's in Columbus, so I was excited to try it when it opened in Fairlawn. I have to say I was rather disappointed. We did call ahead seating for 7:30, came and checked in around 7:25. At 7:50, I went to the hostess stand where I had one tell me ""yeah I don't know what they're doing"" and the other tell me ""you'll just have to wait for a table to open"". I know it was very busy, but I did call ahead seating for that reason. So we finally get seated, our waitress comes over completely disheveled, we split a bbq pizza, which we had to tell her 4-5 times as she kept writing buffalo pizza... The food was nothing to really write home about, the pizza was mostly dough and the chicken definitely had not a lot of flavor. Then, the famous pizookie. It's a warmed up cookie with ice cream, delicious, but honestly can be made at home for a quarter of the price. Overall, the staff wasn't very friendly, food was lackluster, and it was so loud that the atmosphere wasn't too great."
Sarah S.,"Brunswick, OH",0,1,,1.0,11/17/2015,"I wish I could give this no stars. I have to say that I had the worst experience at this restaurant. First of all, I found it rude that we were asked about being a member of the rewards club before even being sat, that makes it seem that we get 2nd rate service before we even get a table. Then we sat down and our server, couldn't tell you his name came over and you can tell he was just trained, maybe 2 weeks ago- total corporate nonsense too! Anyways, he asked us what we wanted to drink and my husband got the ""red""beer, I can't remember the name, but it was SOO basic. I just got a water and an iced tea, which neither were refilled, and the ice tea was almost $2.50!! My husband was actually never offered another beer or anything else to drink either. Then it came to our food, I am a picky eater and on a strict diet, so I was able to order a lunch option because everything else was pretty heavy. Well I order, and asked for my modifications, and I still ended up with the wrong dish.  My husband got a burger, which was just grease... no flavor, and once my food got straightened out their first response was to buy us dessert, which I can't eat- so they did take my food off the menu because it was wrong, but it was also not good, I left most of it behind and so did my husband. So our bill was about 20 bucks and we still ended up stopping off at another restaurant so I could get a side of veggies and a salad and he could another beer!!! I would NOT recommend this place to anyone and I can tell you our friends and I frequent new fun places... this is not going to be one of them! Good luck but you lost a big group of avid drinkers and a big family who loves to go out to eat!"
Marie N.,"Cuyahoga Falls, OH",0,1,,2.0,1/14/2016,"The only reason I am giving BJ's two stars is because the beer was good, and the food was OK. The service was absolutely awful and that is one of my biggest pet peeves. I hate complaining because I have been in the food service industry all my life, but we all were just so disappointed. We had a larger group for a birthday party. To a server, this is great news because this is your chance to make some tips; what you signed up to be a server for. Instead, we overheard snotty remarks about how big our group was and the lack of smiles and friendliness was not overlooked. It took over an hour to receive my food specifically, so I ate while everyone else was finished without complaint. I understand having a big group may take a while for food orders, but at least apologize and if you made a mistake, which had to have been the case with my order, own up to it. Instead, I got no apology, no explanation, no manager coming over to diffuse the situation, no comp of anything, no check up to see how my food came out, or anyone else in our party for that matter; just a throw of the plate in front of me when my food was finally presented. I can honestly say, even if the food was fantastic and they had the best beer I've ever had, I would never go back there purely for the service. I want to have an enjoyable experience when I go out and spend my hard earned money; not sit there feeling like a ""burden"" to our server."
