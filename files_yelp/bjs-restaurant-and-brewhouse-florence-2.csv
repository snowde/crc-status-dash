Morgan R.,"Cincinnati, OH",142,15,,5.0,11/5/2017,"Love this place! Everything I've ordered from this place I've liked, and that's no joke. My favorite would be the roast beef dip sandwich and potato wedges. I recommend the potstickers for an appetizer. Their drinks are great, too! I like their sangrias and margaritas."
culinary q.,"San Francisco, CA",11,40,13,3.0,12/21/2017,"Love this place.  Fun specials on drinks and food.   Unfortunately also had some misses with the food which is usually really good.  Wilted old lettuce, cold food and disconnected waiters.  I think they need a chef that checks the food before it goes out. Scaled back my visits to find a similar hang out spot"
Henry H.,"Lafayette, IN",140,50,,2.0,11/13/2017,"I was in town for a running event and needed to pick up a quick dinner before checking in to my hotel. I had checked online beforehand and noticed a BJ's close by and found a decent sounding meal that I wanted. So I called for an order to be picked up on a Saturday evening, and was told the wait would be 20 minutes. That's not too bad, I thought, so I headed over around that time. Then I waited at the to-go counter. After standing there for five minutes, three employees busted through the door between the counter and kitchen. None of them greeted me, or asked if I had been helped. They had to attend to something obviously more important than a customer. When one of them finally asked me if I needed help, I told them about my order and paid my bill. But my meal (a chicken quinoa bowl) was not ready. It was finally ready about 35 minutes after I called, 15 minutes longer than what I had been told to expect. The chicken quinoa bowl was actually quite good, which is the only redeeming thing about my experience at BJ's.  The incredibly slow and poor service is why I will never go back. Honestly, if I had been told ""sorry for the wait"" or some sort of apology even once, I would be able to look past the long wait."
John W.,"Florence, KY",3,40,,3.0,9/23/2017,"Here we go again. Went back to BJs for my sons birthday with mixed results.  Saturday at 4:00pm. Maybe 15% of tables filled. 85% empty.  No one at front desk. Waited about 6 minutes. A girl in BJs uniform comes in front door ,goes behind reception desk, then walks away into bar without saying a word to us.  After 9 minutes total another girl shows up and asks how many. I had used the preferred seating in the apo 35 minutes ahead and requested a table for 5. She asked if a booth was okay. I again requested a table and was told "" We dont have any tables. They are all being prepped for big parties.""  AGAIN, I am looking at 85% empty restaurant. She seems annoyed and says she will see what she can do. The other girl who ignored us earlier shows up and the secing girk says,""Oh good. Seat these people"" and walks away We get seated and the waiter was friendly. We ordered Mahi mahi, Asteak. Parmesan chicken and a Turkey Dip. All were excellent. No issues with food as usual. Thats why we come back.  THEN two other waiters ( I assume) were leaning against the wall behind our table and as another table was seated were LOUDLY saying, "" Why are they seating tables here?"" ""Are they f$@#ing idiots? "" These girls are  F$#/ing stupid. This is bulls$#t"" Im no prude but this was incredibly unprofessional. The waiter took quite awhile to get back to us to bring check and admitted he had forgotten we were there. So food : A+ Waiter: B Other service people we encountered : F Ambiance : F So Im not sure how many times the great food will bring us back considering the rest."
John R.,"Clifton, Louisville, KY",559,186,3682,5.0,7/6/2017,"Great service, great noms.  Very pleased with our experiences here. We've always been treated well and seated quickly. During busy or slow times, service has been consistently great.  Drinks and food have always been reliably delicious and served quickly. The wait staff has been helpful, as well, when we've had questions. Management has also been friendly and constantly moving around to address patrons.  Personal favorite: mushroom appetizers, garlic knots...and their burgers, of course. Delicious, juicy, and thick. The kitchen has always sent them out cooked perfectly and hot! Always pleased to pop in here!"
Marcus M.,"Indianapolis, IN",23,138,561,5.0,4/10/2017,"I love this place. Their menu has something for everyone - the health conscious, those looking to be gluttons, and even something for the middle of the road folks. I've never had a meal here where I wasn't happy with my food.  The decor is nice, and well suit for an intimate date or for large groups. There's also a bar if you are just interested in having a quick drink.  This trip I just had a Baked Beignet and it was so delicious. The dough nice and airy, the strawberries were fresh, and the drizzle was sweet. Perfect dessert!"
Ashley H.,"Covington, KY",1,33,12,3.0,10/8/2017,"I mean- it's a chain, and it's good, but this location has service issues. Long waits before waiters take your order or bring your food even if it's not crowded."
Sarah S.,"Burlington, KY",1,16,,5.0,10/23/2017,I've been going to this restaurant for a while now and the food and service has always been wonderful. I love their beer selection and they have great house made sodas.  Last night I had an experience so wonderful that I just had to leave a review. My sister has a lot of food allergies and Elise was so friendly and accommodating to ensure that she could eat well. It is honestly normally very difficult for her to go out to eat and the fact that she not only had options but our server was kind about it was so refreshing. The whole table just absolutely adored her. She was so wonderful and I truly hope BJ's is aware of how lucky they are to have her.
Kim R.,"Florence, KY",10,13,,1.0,11/12/2017,"We went for Sunday football. They were out of some of the happy hour/game time specials due to their Veteran Day specials. When the Bengals game was over, they switched the sound back to music. We asked for the sound to be switched back to football- we were then accused of drinking too much. I do want to say service was fine, but that is not enough for us to go back to the restaurant."
Christopher V.,"Hebron, KY",0,4,,3.0,12/10/2017,"Very good food but, super expensive for food and drinks. This nothing but, fall short of first class fakery."
Andrew B.,"Mt Lookout, Cincinnati, OH",236,436,1200,4.0,7/10/2016,"Our first time trying a stand alone BJs restaurant..and I gotta say we were pretty impressed overall. The parking lot was completely full, so we expected a wait, but surprisingly we were seated right away. The food here is just as good as other locations..with my favorite dish still remaining the buffallo chicken grilled cheese.  My girlfriend ordered the chicken strips, the order came with so many chicken strips it was crazy. Not sure if it was a normal order or they just gave her extra this time, but it was well worth the menu price, and they were delicious to top it all off.  Our waiter was excellent, very attentive and friendly, our drinks didn't come close to being empty our entire meal. Didn't have room for a pazookie this time..which was disappointing, but still an excellent meal overall."
Brian M.,"Florence, KY",0,23,3,3.0,9/23/2017,Another large chain.  Food is fine and chainish.  Plenty of appetizers. They have their own beer selections. Service is fine.
Ryane R.,"Latonia, KY",56,10,,3.0,9/28/2017,"Bj's did not live up to the hype or how I remembered it when I went to the one in Tri County years ago. The service was good, but the food was just okay. The server told us they started off as a pizza restaurant so I figured it would be good to try the pizza. Maybe it was an off night but my pizza was mushy and cold. I was really disappointed. My daughter got the kids spaghetti and said that it was just okay. I mean you can ask much for a kids spaghetti, but overall the food wasn't great. We probably won't be back."
Natalie P.,"Rosedale, KS",30,5,2,5.0,8/17/2017,"Solid place with good menu and great atmosphere. I love the salads and the drink choices. This is well above average for lunch and you will not be disappointed with the food or the environment. Don't let other reviews get in way of visiting - worthy and you won't be disappointed. And I live in this area but am from Fort Lauderdale.  I know what a good restaurant is - and in this area, BJ's is a favorite."
Corey L.,"Florence, KY",171,1,,1.0,7/7/2017,We were told the wait would be about 30 minutes and it was over an hour. Hosts were being rude to customers. The waiter took 20 minutes just to take our drink order. Service was slow. Food was not as we ordered. Do not recommend this place.  It's been almost 3 hours and still waiting.
Jacob D.,"Amherst, NH",15,150,72,4.0,1/15/2017,BJ's provides a decent experience. I've always wanted to come in but there are normally other options. I now see how they fill a niche for classier beer bar chain. Tons of options on tap. I mm skeptical of the BJ's brand beer but I love all the local craft options. The deep dish pizza was pretty tasty. Maybe a little over priced for what it is. I could come back to BJ's especially if I'm looking for a wide beer selection.
Luke J.,"Independence, KY",64,6,10,1.0,6/10/2017,"Horrible experience. We waited around 19 minutes to be seated which is not a problem but the host and the guy sitting customers...HORRIBLE. They looked like it was an inconvenience to them to be there. We got to our seat  and after waiting 20 minutes for a server, I decided to flag someone to let them know no one had come to our table. A waiter came a few minutes later and apologized stating that our server got assigned to the bar. Our wait could had been longer if I had not asked. Food overall was ok except the supposed deep dish pizza. Pizza Hut pies have more cheese than this one. The only thing deep dish was the name  so the price was outrageous for the pizza they give you. I took pictures in case management needs an example. Might as well call it Pan Pizza instead. But it gets better. Our substitute server came and said we would get another server. We arrived at 3:59 and got our check to pay at 5:41. A little advice to management, work better with your servers transition. Having customers wait with almost every table empty is not good for your business."
Ashleigh G.,"Erlanger, KY",62,33,,3.0,1/2/2017,"Unfortunately every time we come here we have silly wait times. The first time was when it had recently opened and was super busy. Hand full of other time same hint, too long of a wait to get a table the, for food, and for the check. I don't know where the problem is bc it seems the staff is running around in a hustle. This time we found it odd that we had to wait 30-40 mins to be seated only to seat about 8 empty tables in the area which we sat.  The waitress didn't bother to let us know what the specials were, so good thing we already looked online and saw it was free pizookie day. We had never had a pizookie before and they are awesome!!!  I hope this place reads there reviews and sees the common factor people dislike and tries to improve."
Kayla B.,"Cincinnati, OH",26,8,,2.0,4/10/2017,"From my experience, BJ's is basically a glorified Applebee's. I really enjoy the beer selection but the food is overpriced for what tastes microwaved. They have no clue how to properly cook a steak, which should be pretty hard to screw up. It's not worth the price to eat here."
Jarlyn R.,"Florence, KY",115,31,31,2.0,4/23/2015,"I'm writing this review based on my experience last night.  Most nights we get good service but seemed like a new staff tonight.   Ordered a Nit Wit beer, their most awarded beer.  This was the worst beer I have ever had.  First part of the flavor was good but it had an awful bite at the end.  Luckily the manager came over, understood and brought me another beer on the house.  The Hefeweizen was decent.   The waitress was awfully slow, we asked for lemons and it took 30 mins to get them.  I ordered their new pizza, Cajun deep dish.  Waitress stated it had chicken, andouille sausage, tomatoes, green peppers, onions, and Cajun spices.  I requested no onions.  The pizza came out and it had onions and I never found a piece of chicken on it!  Cajun food is supposed to have a good kick to it.  This was the most bland pizza I've ever had.  There was no flavor, even the andouille was tasteless.  I ate two slices just to eat it cause I was hungry.   Overall, not sure what my dinner was but I will definitely not be ordering it again."
Doug And Marty Y.,"Burlington, KY",7,13,,1.0,8/19/2017,"Made reservations with front end staff. Was confirmed 8 customers at 6:30. After a one hour delay the manager apologized for his crews failing to turn customers with kitchen, wait, and servers that could accommodate the heavy crowd. Don't frequent this place on ANY busy evening, you will be definitely disappointed. Other restaurants could accommodate your dining requests without being a stressful occasion."
Chris P.,"Winchester, VA",22,271,312,5.0,8/19/2016,"Long time BJ's fan from the orig stores in OC. Though the menu & seating space has exploded, it's hard to jack up any meal that ends with a Pizookie al la mode!"
Sarah S.,"Mount Pleasant, MI",24,86,55,3.0,8/12/2016,"First time here and was disappointed for a few reasons. My mom and I went here for lunch. We started with their salsa and chips for an appetizer because the menu said that the chips were refillable for free. The salsa was very good. We ate through the chips very fast and when our waitress came by she started to take the salsa away and not offer any more chips. A little odd, but easily corrected. So BJ's does have a nice lunch menu with a variety of options but I opted to order pasta from their dinner menu. Their menu, by the way, is overwhelmingly huge. Anyways, I got the baked ziti since our waitress recommended it. When it came to the table, it looked appetizing but I was disappointed by how small it was!! I mean it was a dinner option...and it cost me a whopping $15 for pasta! I should've avoided that cost. It tasted fine but I could tell that the meats used inside where precooked pizza toppings and there was a pool of grease under the noodles. Last, my mom and I decided to try their pizookie. Let me say that the picture on the menu (and on yelp) is very deceiving. They depict this dessert as a deep dish cookie with ice cream on it. In reality, it's just a large cookie, and again it's over priced. It tasted fine but could easily be made at home for a fraction of the cost (same with my pasta). Overall this experience left me with a taste for something more. Basically if you want pasta, go to a pasta place. If you want a burger, go to a burger place. You get the point. What does BJ's specialize in anyways?"
Yvette C.,"Honolulu, HI",18,32,33,5.0,11/5/2015,"OK so I missed this place a bit much. So, the food was amazing ate it all strange I did it without my other half. We share food most days but not Today. Shhhh don't tell him that. So, the first guy made me an amazing tea drink so delicious his name was Jason a world traveler backpacker. We need a prayer for him all I can say is his name is Jason and it's for a good reason for prayer for him. He had to leave but transferred me to Mike.     And no Mikes last name is not Hunt.....he said amazing as well he is really GREAT he made me a stiff tea he said it was from Long Island. What's that supposed to mean?  It's really yummy. I am having an amazing time here in Cincinnati and Kentucky. This was well needed the great food. Ahhhh."
Jason P.,"Fort Mitchell, KY",0,2,,1.0,12/4/2016,Terrible service we walked out after 15 min of no service and the place was dead. The waitress walked past us 3 times in a dirty t shirt. The manager on duty was completely in a com a. If u have a family or u believe in a budget this place is off the hook. We went to our staple Chilies we were  treated amazing and Taylor is the best. Please do not waste ur money here and I told the manager to have corporate call me
Fredrick C.,"Madison, TN",0,6,,2.0,7/14/2016,"""Sleek gastropub"". Those are the exact words that slid across my lips as we entered the BJ's just outside of the Florence Mall. It really was just a random pick for some grub, but the inside just blew me away. Very nice theme, trendy interior, all leading up to a large bar that claimed the main stage of this restaurant.  We took our seat in the back, far from the drunken howling of a few guys drinking and watching the game. We were greeted and handed menus, while I asked what they specialized in. I was told pizza and that was what I had my heart set on. And both me and my companion decided on a small pizza with half-and-half toppings.   The menu though... that menu was the writing on the wall and I knew it from the second I looked through it. There must've been 13+ pages (going from memory), 3-4 of which were devoted solely to drinks, but still!!! That many things on a menu is almost always an omen for a disaster and well... You know when you try to do too many things at once then just end up doing nothing right? Well, this was that same scenario playing out in my mouth and probably everyone else's. The pizza's crust was then only redeemable quality, crisp and perfectly done. Then comes the clearly low-quality, trucked in cheese and toppings. Go to Kroger and just figure out the crust; it would be the same thing. The sauce... oh, wait.... well, they pretty much didn't use any. Maybe that's how they get the crust right... Dissatisfied with my pizza, I ended up having to order an appetizer of barbecue ribs, which were much more digestible than the abomination I split with my friend; and they were somewhat decent. I began to think that we were supposed to be drunk at the bar to actually enjoy this. I'm still shaking my head about this place... Simply pick a few of your best menu items, use quality ingredients, and do a few things well; trying to do everything only makes everything bad. Where's Chef Ramsay? I need someone to yell about how big the menu is."
Joe S.,"Hebron, KY",0,8,9,4.0,10/8/2016,Not the best for the price small portions on the bacon cheeseburger way too many fries server was attentive& very kind
Kayla R.,"Hebron, KY",133,1,,4.0,3/6/2017,Went in tonight with my 3 kids.  Which I know can be annoying being a server myself!  We had a server named marcela I believe!  She was amazing to say the least she was on top of refills and pre bussing as well as very personable!  Had some amazing appetizers and waited a little while for our food.  But it was absolutely worth the wait.  Pizza was half off so we had plenty to bring home.  Chicken Bacon Ranch is to die for!..  Thanks BJs from a person that has been in the industry for quite some time we loved it.  Only suggestion I would have is not one manager did a table touch which we were there.  I think that should be a part of every experience seemed to be more focused on the beer dinner they were having in the back.  That's the only reason it was 4 stars everything else was amazing!
Sherry T.,"Blacksburg, VA",59,295,11,3.0,7/8/2015,"I've been to BJ's several times and have discovered good points and bad points.  On the good side, the atmosphere is upbeat and classy, yet comfortably casual at the same time.  Also, the avocado egg rolls are delish.  Finally, the servers are friendly. On the bad side, service is always slow, no matter how busy the place is.  Also, the food tends to be hit or miss.  On my most recent visit, my salad was served with wet greens, which was totally disgusting.  Prices are too high, but once you see the interior you will understand why.  You are definitely paying for all the money that was put into it."
Ariel S.,"Florence, KY",0,1,,2.0,7/24/2017,I've tried. My husband and I went Saturday night around 9 for our 3rd trip there. Each time we go I say it's our last. Not because the service. Every server we've had has been good. But the food is just mediocre. This past visit we tried the appetizer sampler. The wings (Nashville hot style) were the best part of the app. The cheese sticks weren't hot so it was like eating a breaded string cheese. The avocado rolls were ok. Nothing to brag about. And the spinach duo was ok. Then we decided on the dessert trio. Those were pretty good. I don't consider myself hard to please. But this place just seems overpriced for the mediocre food it puts out.
Abby P.,"Lawrenceburg, IN",0,16,,1.0,3/20/2017,"We had no wait to get in. Half of the restaurant was empty, yet no one ever came to take our order. After waiting 20 minutes I had to go get a manager to take our drink order. He apologized but didn't act like it was a big deal that we had not been waited on. When our server finally arrived she was very friendly but again seemed like it was no big deal that she had not waited on us for over 20 minutes when they were not busy. I was a server and I know how hard it can be, but not even acknowledging your customers for over 20 minutes is unacceptable. The food was not very good, the portions sizes are way too small. The bread that came with our pasta was cold and hard. We will not be back."
Jon W.,"Florence, KY",0,17,1,3.0,7/31/2016,Food is always good not great. Service has never been bad always on point. Beers are always drinkable but not something I would have to recommend to a friend. I'd try it out if you're in the mall area over the other chain restaurant. I don't think it would be my choice if I had to go out of my way.
Tony B.,"Batavia, OH",0,11,,5.0,1/25/2017,"This place is always great. The flat bread pizza is the best you will find and not too pricy.  At a glance they have about 40 guest taps and 8 of their own. It's Wednesday night and there is a 30 minute wait for table - that may be caused by a staffing issue - several open tables,but it's worth  the wait. I'm a pizza and wing guy but my wife loves their menu. It's a 45 minute drive for us.  Try this place."
Azlisya N.,"Burlington, KY",66,53,59,4.0,7/11/2015,I love their appetizer-calamari!!! I love their bursts cider! The staff and servers are friendly and the inside looks very classy! It is a fine in place that you would take someone on a date or for celebratory dinner! Price isn't that bad! And my food has  always been served very well! Their steak cooks the way I want it to be! The chipotle salmon is my best salmon in town!  It is cold on the inside however. Bring a little jacket/sweater! The brownie is amazing! Everyone should try it once at least!!! Husband loves their beer choices too! We like BJ's on occasion!
John L.,"Fresno, CA",5,55,1,2.0,4/26/2016,"I typically really enjoy BJ's food, but it was definitely not up to par at this location. I ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken for take-out and chips with Spinach Artichoke dip First off, as soon as I got my food home to eat it was already stone cold, and I showed up before they told me it would be ready so I know I didn't leave it waiting at the restaurant too long. My chicken was dry, did not have hardly any flavor, and they had left off the sauce that usually goes on it. My chips were stale, and the spinach artichoke dip had no flavor at all. I would not go back to this location again based on this experience."
Tom B.,"Union, KY",49,26,72,3.0,4/28/2016,"Do not expect much in the way of dinner.  This place is best for beer and entrees or a decent lunch. Dinner entrees have proven to be bland, cooked from frozen packaged creations in my four visits.  The BJ's IPA and Jerimiah Red are good and the appetizer selection is good. The guac is especially good as is the California flavored/named flat bread.  The service has proven to be 50/50 in my trips, but of course, no matter the level of restaurant it's all about individual performance."
Ed A.,"Florence, KY",0,22,7,1.0,2/19/2017,"You have to staff a restaurant to the needs of the consumer. This restaurant was only 2/3 filled when we were told that a table for two would take nearly an hour. The management said they were down by at least two servers, but that doesn't account for the 15 or so tables that were empty. Again, we don't trust we can get a table here again. And if you look at other reviews you will see that their wait times can be a nightmare, perhaps because of Enron management. Sorry, but management here fails to make the business work and it may someday fail with reviews like this one piling up."
Jessica W.,"Cincinnati, OH",34,1,,2.0,3/6/2016,"Had a reservation at 12:00 for lunch, everyone in our party of 8 was seated and ordered by 12:15. Our food did not arrive until 1:30. The waitress, while very friendly and pleasant, disappeared for most of our wait time and offered drink refills only as we were finishing up our meals.  The avocado bacon grilled cheese oozed with butter and I could barely finish half of it.  Not recommended b"
Maria D.,"Fort Mitchell, KY",23,9,,3.0,10/27/2016,Service was ok. Food was served cold. We told the server and it wasn't a big deal. Not sure if I'll return.
Jeff O.,"Franklin, TN",82,91,30,3.0,8/29/2016,"Some colleagues and I went here for lunch while passing through town.  The restaurant is large and open with a very modern look and feel to it.  We were seated promptly, as we were arriving for a bit of a later lunch.  The menu had quite a bit of variety without being so overwhelming.  In addition, as we were there for lunch, there were a number options for combinations.  I believe the flatbread I had was the California one or something like that.  It was very tasty.  They had a number of salads, as well, and the steak fries looked good.  Drinks were refilled promptly, as well.  They have some sort of rewards program, as well, but I'm not usually near a location so I did not look into to see what it was about."
