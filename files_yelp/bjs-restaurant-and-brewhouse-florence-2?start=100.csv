Josh M.,"Lexington, KY",87,183,181,4.0,2/8/2014,I like beer so how could I go wrong? My Mom and step Dad last two time I have been in town have pick this place for lunch. I have tried couple of the beer they brand and I like.  Menu is large with a lot of options. This past trip I had Clam Chowder in a bread bowl and it was on point! If I lived or worked in the area I would have this often.  NKY big ridding spot for I in the Summer so I will be back for more!!!
Kelly H.,"Florence, KY",0,19,,4.0,5/23/2015,"I'm surprised by all of the bad reviews I've read.  My husband, 6 year old daughter, and I all love this restaurant.  We have tried many different things from the menu and have never found anything to be disappointing.  There is a wide variety of choices for different tastes.  It can get a little pricey for a family if you order drinks, appetizers, etc., but it's very good.  We've never had bad service, and the atmosphere is nice, too.  This is a somewhat regular Saturday night dinner place for us."
Anna M.,"Florence, KY",2,33,7,5.0,9/7/2013,YUMMY. Service was great too. The fresh baked cookie was divine. you can even order half and half so you can try two kinds of cookie. We also got 1 scoop each of chocolate & vanilla ice cream at no extra charge. Pizza was fantastic! Kids menu was pleasing to all my super picky kids!
Seth P.,"Burlington, KY",100,45,10,2.0,1/12/2014,"The service is nice but it takes forever and they were not busy. They spread the wait staff way too thin. It was twelve minutes to get our drink order, 25 minutes to order food, the unsweetened tea, after asking for broccoli cheddar soup, they came to the table to say they were out.  I definitely will not come back here."
Marie H.,"Erlanger, KY",3,2,,4.0,9/17/2013,Ordered the lunch special of mini pizza and salad for under $7 which was great! Hubby has the Southern Fried Chicken and said it was delicious. I signed up for there rewards program online and got a coupon for a free hand crafted soda. The root beer was just okay. The place was only half full but the service was super slow.
Taylor J.,"Williamstown, KY",12,10,,4.0,11/21/2013,My fiance and I went just shortly after if opened. We got to sit in the bar area and it was really nice! Unfortunately our table got pulled apart so another couple sat right next to us. So I did not like that the tables weren't connected. The food was outstanding though and the service was wonderful! Ill be going back very soon!
Barbara M.,"Union, KY",0,27,,5.0,11/12/2014,"Having eaten here several times I must give it an excellent rating. Service has always been good and the food delicious. Their version of the French dip was the best I've ever tried, salads are fresh and tasty, chicken pasta was very good and their burgers served on toasted buns are my husband's favorite. Waiter told us the lettuce wraps are going to be taken off the menu. I hope not as they are delicious and a light alternative for an appetizer. I must add that their bar drinks are a little pricey!"
Phil M.,"Rochester, MI",0,1,,4.0,1/12/2015,"We discovered this restaurant by chance on our drive to and from Georgia. It's a great stopping place.  We've enjoyed everything we ordered so far, the service was great, and their beers are tasty. I'm especially fond of their wedge salad."
James S.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,17,20,5.0,12/8/2014,Their berry burst cider is awesome.   The new Fritos Nachos were really tasty.  Nothing bad on the menu.
Irish F.,"Fort Mitchell, KY",0,60,,4.0,11/6/2013,"The bad - Was told the wait was 20-25.  Took 40 for a table for 2.  Small dinner salads are just ok but are only $4 The good - I had Jambalaya as recommended.  It won't surpass my homemade, but it is darn good for $15.95 with lots of fresh peppers, sausage, chicken and shrimp cooked just right. Made a second meal out of leftovers.  Husband ordered the ultimate pepperoni on thin crust - outstanding crust and toppings.  Once you are seated, things move pretty darn fast and our waitress was very well trained."
Ilya A.,"Florence, KY",0,4,,5.0,9/30/2013,"Great food, service and atmosphere. I love the Beer, Burgers and the Smoked Ribs. Not impressed with the pizza. Coming from NYC, I have not found a good pizza in Northern KY or Cincinnati area. I guess I'm still looking for an italian family pizzeria."
Chris P.,"Florence, KY",5,1,,1.0,2/23/2014,"Food took an hour to come out. My wife's came out cold, mine came out over cooked. One in our group didn't get theirs until after we complained. Our salads were forgotten till we requested. Very unhappy. We had a 4 year old, 2 year old, and a 10 month old. Before the end they were all getting restless."
Jeremy M.,"Avondale, Cincinnati, OH",4,1,,3.0,11/2/2013,"I've eaten here twice and not impressed...service is terribly slow, but friendly...food is good but over priced...the strength of the place is it's craft beer selection, but in an area full of these types of restaurants there's nothing to make it stand out from the rest...I think like most who will try it...I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it either"
Mv B.,"Campbellsville, KY",0,6,,5.0,7/10/2014,Very good food and service.  Good drinks also.  Root Beer is excellent.  Clean.
Bernie B.,"Florence, KY",0,2,,1.0,5/19/2014,Awful experience. Took waitress half hour to come over and take our drink order another half hour for the drink to come out. After that 45 minutes to order food and half our later for food to come out. Manager came over and comped my friend her ice. Oh boy that was generous. Didn't comp mine. Was told they were slammed but the family next Tonys got food quicker than us even though we were seated for a long time before they got there. Food no bad but probably because I felt like I hasn't eaten in three days. Very disappointing.
S D.,"Fort Mitchell, KY",0,2,,2.0,10/12/2013,"Have been 2x to Bj's.  First time liked it at dinner.  Thought dessert was pretty high for cookie and ice cream.  2nd trip was at 4:30 at end of lunch hours so I ordered fried chicken and mashed potatoes. I was hungry and it sounded good. Chicken should have been good, but it was just an end scraggly piece shaped like a thin starfish and overcooked; hard to chew, but I let it pass. Potatoes were delicious. Corn was from a can. Disappointing.  Worse was that I ordered the club soda. And they charged me for it!  I called over waitress who said she would ask manager.  Manager came over and quickly told me that THIS time she would take it off.  she didn't want me thinking that the waitress could just take it off the bill.  What?  I was scolded. So what was i paying for water with carbonation??  $2.65. same as a soft drink that cost them money.  Not a happy ending."
