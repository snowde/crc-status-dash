Dr P.,"Burlington, KY",0,6,1,1.0,8/3/2016,"My family and I have given this location three chances and each one has been more shitty than the last. The first two times literally took 40+ minutes for the food to come out. We timed it the second time around just to make sure we were not crazy. The last straw was just a few days ago. I ordered the steak. Second most expensive one, the name slips my mind now, but it couldn't have been more than 3oz. It was absolutely pathetic. Drinks tasted like syrup water and the service was no where to be found.  Two male managers literally feet away just standing around not even asking anyone how things where. Just standing at the computer by the restrooms.  The place is way to pricey for the service you get, the time it takes to get your food, and quality of the food. Don't waste your time. Plenty of better places around."
Kevin H.,"Vevay, IN",1,14,,3.0,11/13/2016,"Stopped into grab a quick bite before going to the movies.  I have driven by this place before but decided to give it a try.  It is a nice restaurant with friendly staff and for a Sunday at lunchtime it was pretty much deserted.  If you like beer and want a drink this place is probably amazing.  For a quick lunch on Sunday it's okay.  I ordered from the lunch menu, that was the only thing the server could say would make it out in the hour I had before my movie started.  This limited the choices available so I decided on the chicken fingers and fries.  I also went for a Caesar salad.  The salad arrived quickly but it was poorly dressed.  Half the salad was dripping in dressing the other half had none.  The chicken fingers were okay, but no better or worse I could have gotten anywhere.  I look forward to trying the place again when time is not a factor and can try out more of the menu."
Mindy M.,"Charlotte, NC",31,64,14,4.0,12/27/2015,"Food was average, as one would expect with such a HUGE menu. The upside is that there is something for everyone. Servers were all very nice. Big appetizer platter was pretty good.  Alcoholic beverages (monitor, strawberry splash, piña colada) tasted more like a mix than a ""real"" drink. Beer was good and lots of choices.  Nothing special overall, but I'd go back."
Lynn P.,"Metamora, MI",0,2,,4.0,3/6/2017,Visiting from Michigan a friend and  I like to support and try local restaurants and we were not disappointed! Food and service were both stellar. Ordered lettuce wraps and California club pizza both delicious only in area for 3 days and probably will go back before leaving.
Tina M.,"Florence, KY",6,5,1,5.0,8/22/2016,Food is ok. Drinks on tap!!!!! This is why the five star!!!! I walk in and it's heavenly!!? I love my beer!!!
Erin K.,"Newport, KY",7,3,,5.0,7/8/2016,Tried them for the first time today. Wait staff was nice and attentive. the food was excellent!!  We will definitely be back. Although it was kind of expensive it was worth it.
Wilson D.,"Charlotte, NC",36,3,,1.0,8/10/2016,Thanks for taking apart half the restaurant while we are eating dinner to prepare for your weekly bug spraying.
Brad S.,"Marshall, MN",3,150,,4.0,6/18/2015,"Had a Mahi Mahi beach something or the other.  I appctd the calories on the menu items, helpful. It was tasty and pretty damn healthy. Had the House Porter and that shit is smooth!  Great tasting mellow malty etc.  I see the comments about service. I sat at the bar and the poor bartender even he admitted was getting his ass kicked. He needed more help, manager tried to support but it was obvious they are understaffed.  My meal surprised me, I expected the beer to be good but it was exceptional.  I travel here a lot and will be back."
Arick S.,"Cincinnati, OH",100,332,29,5.0,9/7/2015,"The service was amazing. The drink selection is definitely varied and the appetizers are great. We had some sliders and flatbread pizza. Next time I'd go for their deep-dish pizza. Our server was Britney and she was great. This is a good location next to the movie theater. I felt the prices were a bit high for the items, but if you use mobile pay (like PayPal) you get 20% off your check. The house-made cream soda was great also."
Steve V.,"Alexandria, KY",0,12,6,4.0,1/23/2016,This review is a long time coming. I had lunch at BJs a few weeks ago. Had no problem getting in. Service was great. I got the 6 inch deep dish pepperoni pizza   With a side of Chicken Tortilla soup. First the soup. It was by far the best bowl of soup I have ever had. It tasted homemade.  Unbelievable. Pizza had slot to live up to after that. It was crisp on the edges. Plenty of cheese and filled me up. Only reason BJs got 4 stars and not 5 is because the waitress let my drink run dry one time. I hate when my glass runs dry. Other than that it was a great experience. At least as much as lunch can get. I'll be back and highly recommend.
Leslie P.,"Florence, KY",38,35,,1.0,4/2/2016,"This is the 4th time I have been here .  The service has been very lacking every time.  There were 6 people in our group.  Three of the orders were incorrect.  If you want your order correct & do not have at least an hour and a half, go elsewhere."
Grant M.,"Cincinnati, OH",13,62,,3.0,8/5/2016,It's a better Applebee's. It has decent food and service. I really do like the location by the mall. It has great coffee!
Lex L.,"Erlanger, KY",5,20,15,2.0,2/28/2015,"After having three uninspiring meals here it was time to write this. The staff at this location seems to always be disorganized and unaware. The hostesses are seldom personable,  remind me is it a hostess responsibility to greet guests?....... Nor do they seem to have a handle on the incoming guests no matter the traffic level. Anyway, we came in to dine at 3:15 on a Saturday. The server took a good 15 min to approach the table after the hostess tried to seat us at a barely 5 person booth with 5 people and a baby. Our drinks took a while and the food took even longer.  Once the food came out, it was not appetizing.  The avavado egg rolls had been under the heat lamp too long, the honey chicken tender salad was slimy and had little to no romaine in it as was advertized. The pizza had burn spots on it as well and toppings only in the center.  Basically, I would skip this location all together. If you really have a craving for this brew house, go to Springdale.  This location has lost us as customers because they just basically don't care."
Angela K.,"Florence, KY",10,89,38,4.0,6/25/2015,"The food here is standard in terms of the offering, as is the beer, but it's always good quality and done properly.  They also do a great job at offering a lighter menu.  A lot of chains do a very poor job of this but their light menu is flavorful and creative.  We've done some beer tasting events here and it's a lot of fun.  They also carry local brews, so that's a huge plus in my book.  We've never had a bad service experience here either, which is impressive for a place this big.  Our servers are always attentive and friendly. Tonight we had the Ahi salad and the new light option, roasted barbacoa chicken.  The Ahi salad was great, fresh, not too much dressing.  The one thing I will say is that the wasabi is HHHOOOOOTTTT.  It's no joke!  Do not go there unless you can handle that heat!  The barbacoa chicken was wonderful.  The chicken was juicy and perfectly seasoned.  The rice and beans were cooked properly and good, but a little salty.  We both had the porter beer and it was DELISH as usual! Honestly, is it a bourbon, hipster-ran, funky spot?  No, not really, but the standard offerings are REALLY well done and for that, they get a 4 star."
Ala A.,"University Heights, Cincinnati, OH",197,68,14,5.0,2/2/2016,this is a class a place i love the inside look and how tasty there food . but before i forget the homemade sodas are amazing and there steak is well cooked and flavored had a good time. will be back soon
Aditya P.,"New York, NY",11,51,16,5.0,7/29/2015,The food and beer were perfect. Their service is pretty good too. We were at the bar during happy hour Monday. The ambience is pretty bar like
Cindy P.,"North York, Canada",14,14,5,4.0,7/7/2015,Loved everything here except the drink I got as I feel it didn't have any alcohol in it. I got the quinoa Salmon bowl and it was above my expectation. The server was really great and the ambience of the restaurant was very chic and comfortable. I would definitely recommend!
Sarah F.,"Cold Spring, KY",95,534,126,4.0,1/11/2015,"Pleasantly surprised by a recent dinner experience here. It's a brew house so think pub food and beer and you'll be happy. I got a burger with wedge fries and a craft beer sampler.  The burger was well cooked, diner-style on a flat top with lots of flavor. The wedge fries were crisp on the outside, well-seasoned, and soft potato inside. I tried several housemade beers which were enjoyable and there was a wide range to choose from.  Hubby went outside the pizza and burger pages and thought his was just OK (fish tacos). Service was pretty prompt, no problem getting to our movie on time.  2 tips: --no reservations, but they do take call ahead seating, which I would recommend for weekends (reduced our wait to 10 min) --they offer discounted movie tickets for Rave next door ($8), but you might want to inquire in advance if that's important to you because they ran out when we were there."
Jason K.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,3,,3.0,3/26/2017,"They are Hiding a poor operation behind a great concept and menu . The menu is awesome and I love craft beer but they have not delivered it to my table the way it should be or the way it has been requested in 3 separate occasions. The service is always slow, the kitchen can't get the food out. I've received, the wrong fries, an over cooked burger, under cooked uncut pizza without any thing to cut it or serve it with, a burger with all the toppings that were supposed to be held off. Last night our waitress disappeared, I had to go find her to order dessert, that took forever to come out to the table. My guess is that this is a management issue, I've never seen a manager walk around and check on tables or anything like that. The only reason I give it a 3 is because the 50% of the things they do get right are really good! If they could step it up they would see me a lot more, as of now I have to forget how bad the experience was and then I wander back in for a reminder."
Lyndsey P.,"Covington, KY",124,13,2,3.0,1/22/2015,"Hahahahaha I am really not surprised to see a consistent 3 stars.  Service is always weird. Like not particularly bad.. just weird. The last time we were there our server couldn't tell us about the beer because she ""wasn't allowed to drink anymore."" ... okay... thank you for that somewhat unnerving info... can we have someone that CAN talk to us about beer then?    Usually takes too many inquiries about ketchup to receive some. Despite the service issues the food is always great, even if they do forget sides sometimes.  It's somehow all a very confusing experience."
