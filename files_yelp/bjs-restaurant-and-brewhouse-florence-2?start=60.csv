Jessica L.,"Highland Heights, KY",59,73,16,4.0,1/16/2016,I was really impressed with this place. The decor is really nice! They have a beautiful bar with a large selection of beers on tap. The staff has always been friendly every time I've gone. Most recently I had ordered the Brussel sprouts and they were DELICIOUS! I'd definitely recommend eating here.
John C.,"Madison, IN",5,8,4,2.0,4/4/2016,This is the third or fourth time we've been here. Each time the food has been pretty darn good. The service on the other hand....  Very very slow. Took half an hour to get two sandwiches out.   This is a common complaint so I assume that they don't care about speed of service
John D.,"Hebron, KY",67,3,,1.0,4/2/2016,"Thoroughly disappointed with this visit. Got the fried chicken with mashed potatoes and some sort of corn. The chicken was horrible, the corn was obviously canned, and the potatoes were sub-par. At least the Pepsi was good."
Kathy W.,"Hebron, KY",8,2,4,1.0,2/26/2016,Just had their spaghetti and meatballs if you like a lot of garlic and undercooked  meatballs this dish is for you. Low on flavor and not worth the price of 14.75
Dale H.,"Edgewood, KY",74,80,228,4.0,2/12/2015,This is one of my favorite reasonably priced restaurants to eat at. The steaks are always good and cooked exactly how I like it. And the service has always been good. They have plenty of beer on tap!!!!
Mike G.,"Corona, CA",0,51,9,4.0,9/8/2016,I love BJs restaurant. I ate there almost every week when i lived in southern California. So when i saw one in Florence while i was there on business i had to eat there. Food is very good. Best thing on the menu... Jambalaya. I get it every time. Soooo good. Mini pizookies for dessert. Awesome. Service was terrific. I will eat there again next time i am in town. Wish they would open a BJs in the Chicago area...
Marta R.,"Covington, KY",0,14,,1.0,8/2/2016,"The service was not only slow, but terrible. I've never seen such rude and nasty restaurant employees in my life! Not a single employee made eye contact or smiled. Our waiter ignored us, even came to our table without acknowledgement to get his tip from the last party, and waited another 10 minutes before taking our drink orders.  He wouldn't smile, was impatient, and looked and sounded enraged when I politely asked where the appetizer was. It made for an extremely uncomfortable experience. I won't be back, and don't have anything good to say about this place!"
Jeff P.,"Lake Mary, FL",38,19,1,1.0,2/26/2016,"Ordered the New Orleans Jambalaya. Should never have left the kitchen. It was over cooked, bland, and covered with paprika. Nasty after taste. I do not recommend this place."
Sarah M.,"Cincinnati, OH",1,9,,3.0,9/2/2015,"I've been here a few times and must say both the food and the service are hit-or-miss. In the end I'm usually left feeling like...meh, I am not sure if I will ever come back."
Lynn P.,"Louisville, KY",30,108,32,4.0,9/20/2014,"Decided to try this place on the fly while visiting  the area for a football game.   Wise decision!  Both of us ordered the Ribeye and the result was a huge thumbs up.  Cooked exactly to order. ..flame - grilled juicy goodness.   Pepperoni dip appetizer was good and convinced us that when we come back we should give their pizza a try.   If I could make a recommendation to this chain, I would suggest rolls or bread of some sort to accompany the salad (which was also very good) and the meal.  The bar drinks are refreshingly original but expensive.   The waitress was okay but I sort of felt like we might be keeping her from socializing with a friend who was in the bar."
Rod J.,"Independence, KY",126,94,58,4.0,10/15/2015,"Good food, great beer selection and even better desserts. This place hits on all cylinders. As far as the size of the entrees, as Donald Trump would say, They're Huuuggggeee! You will not leave here hungry and most likely will need a nap after eating."
J.r. M.,"Belleville, IL",2,8,1,4.0,10/26/2014,"We were searching for another place in the area and stumbled on this gem.  Greeters were a little aloof...appeared as though we were bothering them about asking for a table...but that was the only bad experience. The beer was great, I had two different ambers and a heffe, she a pumpkin and a hefe. The heffe is wonderful.  We both really enjoyed the menu and it was hard to decide what to order. I was in the mood for steak but can never refuse a bison burger...so of course that's what I had. She had a burger, as did the 2 kids.  All the burgers were really good (wish they weren't over cooked but in retrospect we didn't specify) Bottom line is I recommend the place. Go here for good beer and food. It's worth the money and for what it is you won't do better in the area."
Jeff K.,"Florence, KY",0,3,,4.0,7/19/2016,"It ok. I wouldn't say it's spectacular, and I wouldn't say ""don't stop here"". The stuffed mushrooms were phenomenal. The sirloin was overdone and dry, yet still had good flavor and no reason to send back (ordered medium got medium well to almost well). I did tell the waitress, no reaction just ""ok"". Staff IS friendly and prompt. It was very busy for a Tuesday. I'd stop again."
Therese T.,"Covington, KY",0,8,1,2.0,6/11/2015,"Our server wasn't very good. We ordered a tavern cut pizza, no tomato chunks and it came out with tomatoes. The girl that brought it took it back to have it remade but our server didn't really care. I spent more time with an empty drink glass and had to ask each and every time I wanted a refill. She acted put out that I would even ask for more to drink. She never asked how the pizza was and she brought the check before we were even done, without asking if we'd like anything else. I then told her we wanted a pazookie and she was annoyed about that. Someone else brought the pazookie out and we never saw the server. She didn't check on is again and I left thirsty because she never came back so I could ask for another drink. The server and service was very slow and disappointing. I can't say we'll be very quick to return, if at all."
Charlotte R.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,1,,3.0,7/12/2016,"My husband and I visited on July 8th, 2016. The hostess really needs to get a personality. She wanted to seat us in front of the restrooms, mind you, the place was not busy. Sorry toots, I do not like eating and looking into a toilet. It took us forever to be waited upon and then forever to get our food. My husband's appetizer came out first and about 20 minutes later mine came out, along with my entrée. For the life of me, I cannot figure out why it takes so long to get out drinks. I looked around and it seemed that was happening at other tables too. Somehow the manager is not paying attention to his staff. I have to admit the food was really good, when we finally received it. The place has a nice look to it."
Laura F.,"Florence, KY",0,8,,4.0,1/3/2016,My friend & I enjoyed a light dinner @ BJs after an early movie last week. The restaurant was quite busy but we were seated quickly. Our server might have been new as he wasn't sure about the drink selections & had to go ask others. The menu has so many wonderful selections!  I had a mini pizza & Caprese salad. My friend had the fish tacos.  Both very delicious. Very convenient location.  Good value.
Robert S.,"Florence, KY",3,81,17,3.0,9/6/2015,"Food is OK.  Not great - Not bad either.  Depends on what you get/what you like.  Experienced slow service at times.  Best description of the service is ""spotty"" sometimes it's ok too."
Myra B.,"Independence, KY",4,17,,2.0,7/19/2015,Service slow food mediocre and overpriced. I guess if just want drinks and appetizers at the bar then it's a cool place to go with some friends or coworkers. I do enjoy the atmosphere...
Quintin P.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,2,,4.0,8/8/2015,"Very good! We are driving back home from a family vacation and stopped for a bite to eat. A very clean professional restaurant. My mom who likes lighter food and dad who likes greasier food both loved the restaurant. Will satisfy any craving you have wether is be pasta, burgers, salads and  pizza!"
Celeste D.,"Fort Knox, KY",1,62,33,2.0,2/23/2016,"Well since my last review BJ's terminated all of their decent servers, except one gal (I can't remember her name, but she's from Guatemala & she's on her game). Our last visit we sat for 10 minutes, no acknowledgement from whomever our server was, we walked out and went to Quaker steak. This visit we discovered the gal from Guatemala when we sat in the BAR for happy hour. Shortly after being seated, the blonde hostess sat her husband and whiney toddler in the BAR next to us for happy hour . We've seen this husband/whiney toddler in the bar area for happy hour once before, but thought management had simply dropped the ball allowing this not realizing an employee was running amuck. Children belong in family seating not the BAR during happy hour. We settled our check and moved ourselves to happy hour where a child wouldn't be ruining my mojito by screaming for his working mom."
