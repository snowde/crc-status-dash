Randy S.,"Hebron, KY",0,2,1,4.0,10/13/2014,"Came with my wife and friends, the bartender Wade was awesome... Try his blue Berry martini"
Darrell M.,"Covington, KY",37,28,11,4.0,5/21/2014,"Was unsure about going to BJ's after reading the reviews, but I would definitely go back.  We had a great server and delicious food.  I ordered the California burger and my wife ordered the Crispy Jalapeno burger.  Both were delicious and flavorful.  Being a brewhouse, the beer selection was nice and they offered a good variety of in-house beers.   Not sure why they're getting such rough reviews - we left happy and full."
Kevin T.,"North Wales, PA",39,10,,2.0,1/1/2015,"Food and beverage menus are great and certainly a reason to try BJ's. But the service was terrible. Every server we came across missed the very basics in all aspects of service. We had to ask for appetizer plates, silverware, napkins that eventually came well after we received the appetizer. Plates were never cleared and never offered refills throughout. BJ's needs to invest in their wait staff...quickly."
William B.,"Brooksville, KY",11,7,8,4.0,3/29/2014,I have had great service here each time. Great beer and my wife loves the hand-crafted soda's. Their hamburgers are excellent. Try all the appetizers. Pizza are good also. Love atmosphere and get my full of ESPN when dinning.
Tommy L.,"Union, KY",0,11,,4.0,7/12/2015,"Food here is delicious and I love the ""enlightened meals"" section of the menu. Very healthy and yet still delicious. I've dined here twice and once got a flatbread, which was one a delicious meal. The second time I got a quinoa salmon dish which was even better and it was off of the enlightened menu. The menu is extensive and all of the dishes I've ordered or tasted have been very good. Also, the avocado egg rolls are amazing. The location is great, right next to the mall and easy to get in and out of. The atmosphere is also very nice, with a great bar and high ceilings. The only downside is that the service is occasionally slow, but at the very least its just average service, not bad. The food is what will keep me coming back here."
Hannah M.,"Huntington, WV",0,7,4,5.0,2/15/2016,Loved this place except for the long wait to be seated. Had very good service and the food was delicious! Get the avocado egg rolls!! Deep dish pizza was pretty amazing as well.
Ryan Z.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,346,13,2.0,12/5/2014,"Hmm... what can I say about this place? I was always told that if I didn't have anything nice to say, I shouldn't say anything at all... so I'll try to stay on the nice side. They have a LOT of variety in both food and beer. The food wasn't completely terrible. There will always be an open table for you. There are worse options in this chain-restaurant hotbed of NKY. Yep. That's all."
Heidi F.,"Covington, KY",92,20,,1.0,8/26/2014,"Never again. This was my third time in hopes of a good experience. Last time our bill was wrong by being over charged for beers we didn't have and sitting without utensils for at least 5-10 minutes. The time before last, my burger failed to be cooked WELL DONE three different times!!!'  Seriously...well done!  Who can't cook a burger well done?  This time the service was better, but I ended up having a major allergic reaction after eating here. I've had mahi mahi before and never had a reaction.  I don't know....but it took 3 attempts to get lemons for my water as well. I'm done!  The beer and food is excellent, but not worth the poor service!"
Skully B.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,48,,1.0,1/17/2016,After repeated trips to BJ's I am amazed at the architecture and remain disappointed for low quality service. Granted my expectations for dining in the Florence area are low however this place takes it to new depths. Bartenders are slow to the point of being almost awol during the daytime shifts. The managers remain well hidden from view and do not present a threat to loafing waiters and bartenders more intent I'm talking to coworkers than waiting on customers. The in-house craft beer selection is horrid however they do have a fine selection of other craft beers if the price remains high for the region. The food is typical bar fare the best being a southwestern style egg roll and an occasional flatbread pizza appetizer.  Entrees are not noteworthy likely due to a menu that is too complex and without focus. The crowd is geriatric in the atmosphere early American bus terminal do yourself a favor and try somewhere else.
Jeff I.,"Union, KY",6,44,38,2.0,8/1/2014,Just had the worst service here. Place was empty and the waitress only came back to our table to see how everything was after we completed our meal. No checking on drink refills etc. I ate my whole meal without a drink and I'm one who likes a drink or two as I'm eating. Food is average at best and on the weekends the wait time is long unless you can find a place around the bar.
Sam K.,"California, KY",163,5,,2.0,3/9/2015,"I haven't heard too many good things about Bj's but I figured it wouldn't be bad for lunch. My mom and I went on a Friday around 2 pm. We were seated and greeted immediately, our server was super friendly and spent time with us on the menu. Once our order was in she let us know that she was leaving and introduced us to our new server. At this point our drinks were half empty and appetizer finished. Our food was brought out and we were never checked on again.  We spent most of our meal with empty drinks, we couldn't get another server to even look in our direction, and our server looked like she had a whole other section. It wasn't until we were ready for the bill that I walked up to the hostess to let her know we needed to leave. After that our server ran over and offered dessert, which we declined, and then got our bill. It may have been completely innocent and she could have completely forgot about us but there wasn't any apology offered. The food was delicious though :)  We had the calimari and one of the tavern cut pizzas!"
Jennifer D.,"Villa Hills, KY",13,5,,4.0,12/7/2014,"Had lunch here the other day for the first time. Immediately loved the decor and was seated promptly by a very friendly hostess. Our server greeted us immediately and had our drinks right out. Their menu seemed kind of long to me, but they have a lot of choices. Ordered an appetizer of cheese sticks and went ahead and placed our order. I ordered unlimited soup and salad , which I thought was a good deal. My husband had a burger and fries. Unfortunately our food arrived before our appetizer and it did seem like kind of a long wait. But overall the food was great. And I would highly recommend the chicken tortilla soup. It was delicious. I think this is one of the better restaurants in this area."
Chad R.,"Florence, KY",2,7,5,4.0,12/22/2014,"Food was good, but not spectacular.  Atmosphere was really cool, but kinda on the loud side.  Beer was spectacular I would suggest trying the sampler to try out and find your favorite.  Prices on the food was reasonable."
Toree C.,"Aurora, IN",23,144,36,4.0,5/19/2014,"BJ's is a great place for groups. There's a wide variety of options on the menu, so everyone will be able to find something they like. The seating is ideal for groups as well, with large, round booth seating or long tables. They have root beer and cream soda that they make in house which is very good. I've always had exceptional service here and is an easy choice when dining with new or picky people."
L B.,"Florence, KY",0,12,,1.0,2/19/2014,"So, after I posted a negative review about BJ's Brewery, I received an email requesting me to email or call a representative from BJ's.  I called 2 days ago and received no response.  I can tell this restaurant really does not care about customer service.   Their customer service is the worst I have ever experienced."
Jared A.,"Florence, KY",2,19,11,4.0,3/26/2014,"I came here for lunch yesterday for the first time. In the past it's been dinner every time and I've had mixed emotions. My experience yesterday is worthy of 5 stars.  The waitress was great,  very personable and on top of her game.  I tried the Gourmet 5 meat mini deep dish pizza nd it was amazing. I've had the deep dish before but a different kind and I highly recommend it to anyone. This place has so many good entrées it's rediculous. I've had 5 or 6 different meals and everyone has been very good. The only reason this review is not getting 5 stars is because previous visits. The service has been lackluster.  At first I thought it was because the place was new and they were trying to get their kinks worked out( which I can completely understand) but it wasnt. Granted, we go on Saturday nights and they are fairly busy but it looks like they have enough people working to handle the load. The service has never been horrible but they can definitely do better.  I WILL return simply to have another great meal because the food makes me able to put up with ok service."
Tom T.,"Florence, KY",0,20,,1.0,6/8/2016,"cheap knock off of cheese cake factory, pissed off staff trying to force more overpriced beer and deserts down your throat, skip it, unless your meemaw wants a fancy brunch."
Joe L.,"Burlington, KY",0,2,,2.0,2/3/2014,"Food is great when it's right, and the wait staff tries hard but the kitchen in this place is so bad! Visited 10 plus times just hoping it was because they are new. This is poorly managed in my opinion and a shame because when we finally get the food and it's actually what we ordered and how we ordered it is very good."
Thomas C.,"Oak Park, IL",112,422,127,3.0,3/15/2014,"Service and the potstickers were unbelievable.  Rest of the food was ok, great space to bring a group and watch some games."
Jay H.,"Florence, KY",270,235,175,3.0,2/6/2014,"MISSED!!! The hamburger Pizza. First time I ate at BJ, was is Newark CA. In 2013. My sister told me to try the Hamburger pizza...OMG!!! Love it. Guess what I tried to order it in Florence BJ. they did not carry it, I was upset, so I had to drop my 4 star to average 3 stars. So I have eaten here several times, ok food, ok service and ok on the beer, wish there was specials on beers. $5-6 for 12 oz seem a little high, I guess you pay for the ambience. I do like the big screen TVs and how big the place is, also it being NEW. I WILL come more often with friends and maybe I will get a dish that I will really like and will increase my stars."
