Rebecca P.,"Fair Oaks, CA",65,182,257,5.0,9/4/2017,"This BJ's is like any other BJ's... great food, great ambience, great service. I come here because it's the closest one to me. I really love that BJ's puts calorie counts on their menu. I come here specifically because of that benefit. The one drawback to BJ's is their ridiculously slippery floors. Every time I come here in heels I'm terrified of slipping. I only wear flats here. Annoying, but not a strong enough reason to decrement a star. We got the Quinua Shrimp, Cherry Glazed Salmon, and BJ's Classic Flatbread Pizza. My mother in law is allergic to spice so we requested her shrimp to be spice free. The kitchen responded beautifully. Her dish came out with perfectly balanced flavor and not a hint of spice. A happy mum in law makes for a happy family. Thanks BJ's!  My husband loved his meat extravaganza (pizza) and my salmon was delicious, but I couldn't finish my plate because I was too full--that's ok though. I love leftovers!  The skinny margarita was really good--and only 150 calories! I'd definitely get it again"
Dan K.,"Roseville, CA",128,171,35,1.0,10/8/2017,"Having been to this and other locations, this is so far my least favorite... I've been here twice, a fairly long time ago and a few weeks ago for takeout.  Although my first visit was probably a year ago, I still remember it fairly well, as if it was yesterday, so that could've changed, but more or less, this is a blended review from both visits combined. The service was probably some of the worst I've received, ever.... it was fairly slow when I came here. I'm not sure if our waitress had a bad or an off day, or maybe she was new, or just didn't want to be there. It took us a while to get our orders in. The drinks took almost 20 mins to come out. One of the appetizer came out before the drinks, while the second appetizer never came out at all, nor did the soup. Although they made it to the final bill, which we had to fix, which probably caused another 15-20 minutes delay, I can say I'm glad that I didn't have to pay for something that I never got.... the food was pretty good, although they did get the order wrong, completely missing the few special requests I made.  My second visit was for take out, since the food was decent the first time, but the service was bad and I really didn't want not have an extra couple hours to spare... this was completely the opposite experience. They were friendly, helpful, attentive, getting the order right, getting me out on my way quickly! The food this time however was the complete opposite... we ordered pasta, jambalaya and a couple of appetizers. The appetizers were decent (not as good as the first time), the entrees were mediocre at best. We might as well went to the grocery store down the street, went to their frozen food section and it would've been better and cheaper. We couldn't even finish the entrees aside from a few bites...  All in all, the 1 star rating is a blended reflection of what I've experienced in the couple of times I've been here. If I ever have to come out to this place, I will probably make sure to drive an extra 20-30 mins, to get to a different location, as I've had better experiences at those..."
Ram G.,"Folsom, CA",2,45,11,3.0,10/2/2017,"Our family of 4 were there yesterday October 1st for dinner. This is not the first time we went here. In general, we wait for 30 - 45 minutes to be seated. We heard about the Bj's app to get on the priority waiting list? Any way that was useless because our name was never on the list after we reached the restaurant. Fortunately, there was no wait and we were seated immediately. Our waiter was Mr. Steve and he was absolutely great.  We ordered one cocktail, and 2 soft drinks between 4 of us. After the drinks arrived, we also placed an order for 3 appetizers (tortilla chips with spinach & artichoke dip (yum), Mozzarella Sticks, Avocado Egg Rolls ( the best and dish unique to BJ's), 2 Entrees ( 2 Shrimp and Asparagus penne). The food was great, hot and delicious. Service by Steve is Immaculate. So why am I giving 3 instead of 5 stars. Here is the reason: One of the waitress (don't know the name) got our Entree's before the appetizers. When we asked her why, she asked us, ""do you want me take this back?"" Really? To my understanding, the word appetizer means: "" a small dish of food or a drink taken before a meal or the main course of a meal to stimulate one's appetite."" Then Steve came and he was at least honest and told us why there was this mix up. Oh! yeah, We got a free Pizookie (white chocolate macadamia cookie) for registering our app. I may be severe with my 3 star rating. If I have the option, I would give 3.5 stars."
John H.,"Folsom, CA",1,137,55,3.0,10/1/2017,"This place is always busy and they have a very diverse menu with a lot of great options. However, even though I could walk here from my house, I just do not go here very often. In reading the menu and trying to decide what to eat today, I asked myself why I do not come here more often.  I settled on the potato skin appetizer and a half rack of baby back ribs, which comes with two sides (I ordered cheesy mashed potatoes and clam chowder). The skins were much smaller than I remember and they had very little cheese on them. The clam chowder was decent but not great and the mashed potatoes were good, but served without gravy. The ribs were, like the soup, decent but not great. However, they were very small. Overall, the food was nothing better than average.  Our waitress was attentive enough but a little annoying. For example, we had been done with the appetizer and the plate sat on the edge of the table. She asked if she could take the empty plate and then actually waited for a response. Just clear away the dirty dishes already!"
Jason Z.,"Folsom, CA",12,144,223,5.0,12/22/2017,"Went here on a whim. We were told there would a 45 minute wait, ended up being maybe 20. They move very fast. The waiter was very quick and our drinks never got low. The food was friggin awesome. The portions are to big for any of us to eat it all. And all I had was salad. They need to do something about the floor. I almost busted my ass walking and I wasn't the only one, several people complained about it. If I were drinking I know I would have busted my butt. But I wasn't and I didn't and I will definitely come back here."
Pete M.,"Folsom, CA",0,104,64,5.0,1/8/2018,"I just wrote a negative review at the table, based on a dissatisfaction.  I am rewriting it, as the manager made it right, without us even requesting that.  The waitress made him aware......they were all nice and the dissatisfaction can easily be overlooked."
Andrew A.,"Pollock Pines, CA",56,178,418,4.0,12/17/2017,"You know, BJ's is BJ's...a chain Brewhouse/restaurant with an extensive menu for both food and the brews. This review is strictly for our lunch/food experience today. Suzan, our waitress was a gem and took really good care of us. She was friendly, personable and very accommodating.  Ordered an appetizer to start. The Siracha Brussels sprouts. I highly recommend this dish. Not too spicy and the sprouts were cooked perfectly...still had just a bit of a crunch to them. My wife ordered the clam chowder in the sourdough bread bowl. Middle of the road chowder but the bowl was exceptional. I had a good time eating what was left of the bowl after she was done. She also had a small ceasar salad...again middle of the road but damn decent nonetheless. I opted for the Mahi-mahi fish tacos. I don't think that there is such a thing as a bad taco. If there is, I have not been introduced to it. My tacos today were a little different in that they came in a light pita shell. Ingredients were on point but the shells were a little too soft and doughy in the middle and a little too crunchy around the edges. A minor issue because if I am being completely honest, I would probably eat a plate of tacos even if the shells were completely made of cardboard. I told you...I love tacos that much! No pics of food today because the football game had all of my attention. :-)"
Donna F.,"Ripon, CA",1,83,396,3.0,11/19/2017,"Stopped in for a late dinner Thursday evening, about 9pm.  Found seats at the bar immediately, pretty quiet.  My other half had his favorite beer, Tatonka.   I ordered the bacon, guacamole deluxe burger with a side of broccoli.  It's a beef patty topped with guacamole, smoked bacon, pepper jack cheese, chipotle mayonnaise, red onions, tomatoes and jalapeños. The burger was good, really enjoyed the spicy flavor, the broccoli was gross.  The broccoli was lukewarm, overcooked and tasted old.   My other half ordered the  black and bleu burger. It's beef patty with chipotle, bleu cheese, bacon, grilled onions, tomatoes, on a Parmesan-crusted bun with roasted garlic aioli and fries.    Again burger was spot on good but the fries were lukewarm and tasted old. Our bartender, Emily, was pleasant.  We would recommend but make sure your sides are properly cooked."
Mark O.,"Santa Rosa, CA",30,303,377,5.0,12/25/2017,"Yes, BJ's is a big restaurant chain and I have had some hit and miss times depending on locations, so hopped in to the Folsom location when the nearby Italian destination was a 90 minute wait. It was very busy but we scored one of the last booths in the bar and were greeted promptly, water and drinks came and orders taken perfectly. Even with the happy hour signs staring at us we figured we were out of luck since not on Saturday. But alas we were informed by our server that happy hour was on since an NFL game. How great is that!  So four of us chowed down on deep dish, mini-pizzas for 1/2 off, chips and queso and a full-size burger with fries for $6. Food came out piping hot without much wait and our server did a nice job checking in on us. Pizzas were excellent and the burger had nice toppings; not the best beef ever but decent. Overall, not a Michelin star but good food at a great price in what appears to be a well run establishment."
Cruiser M.,"Fair Oaks, CA",0,25,40,5.0,1/3/2018,"An excellent brewery, JR has strived for the  customers satisfaction and management. The meals are excellent and prepared as requested when ordered. An excellent variety of different meals to select from on the menu and moderately priced and portions are just right. The service is excellent and a very clean establishment. Not to over look great selection of beer's on tap this is just a great place to dine."
S B.,"Fair Oaks, CA",0,46,,4.0,1/1/2018,"I like BJ's selection of food because anyone can find something on their menu. Good beer selection and the drinks are usually pretty generous with the alcohol content. Service at this location is always steady and good. The Elk Grove location one is a bit lacking. not sure why all of there locations have slippery floors...kinda weird. All around comfortable place to hang out with friends, bring a family or coworkers."
Wazi S.,"Elk Grove, CA",9,6,2,5.0,12/10/2017,We are regulars at BJ's and we really enjoy the food and atmosphere. The service is excellent and everyone is always very polite and accommodating. We love the family environment and the waiters are always great and seam happy to be there despite it always being busy.  All restaurants should aspire to be this great! Thank you!
Michelle T.,"Folsom, CA",5,4,1,1.0,11/5/2017,"BJs remains the most overrated Resturaunt in Folsom. We ordered take out and while family completely understands that comes with an understanding that the food won't be as good as when you go in, it was an overall awful experience. From the time I called in to actually getting home with my food it was BAD. Had to call back 3 times cause I was put on hold each time for over 5 min each time. I was told the wait was 20 min to get my food and in the end it was an hour waiting. My kids meals were missing things, when I got home the chicken was cold that we ordered and my husband had no onions, cheese or fries with his French dip. Biggest waste of time and money and this remains not the first time.  We will never go back!!"
Sankari V.,"Roseville, CA",3,77,118,2.0,6/10/2017,"In my restaurant when a customer turns his head and tries to make eye contact with someone that means ""he or she wants service"". How come staff at BJ's don't get it.  It is a cardinal sin to have an empty cocktail glass when a customer is sitting at the bar and. No one checks in him. Your employees are using their cell phones too much at work. Get your act together please. Food is good but service : needs a kick in the rear..! I had written this review two months ago.  Here is my experience today 06/10/17 Walked in at 10:05 pm. Ordered a Peach Margarita. In five mins I wanted a refill. The girl behind the counter never bothered. My glass has been empty for the last 10 mins. The restaurant is not busy at all. Everyone is busy doing nothing. Terrible.. management wake up before it is late...!"
Lynne B.,"Carmichael, CA",22,127,3,2.0,9/9/2017,"So, we went back to Folsom's BJ for a second time, we should have known better.  I checked in with their app and went inside.  The reservation station was manned by 6 employees all having a conversation among themselves. After about 10 minutes I interrupted them and asked them to confirm my check in, they said ""yeah it's fine""  fifteen minutes later after four or five parties who arrived after us were seated I went back to double check and they said ""you're not on the reservation list"" huh? So, after another 10 minutes they found us a table among the 30 or 40 empty tables.   We placed our order the food was very good and then I showed the server a coupon for a free pizookie.  The server looks at the picture on the app and said ""oh that looks like a mini pizookie""  I said ""that's not what it says"" to which she says ""I need to get the manager"" fifteen minutes later she returns and says ""your pizookie will be here in a minute""  Next time I will go to the Arden BJ's I've had enough of this nonsense"
JM C.,"Barrigada, Guam",53,29,102,2.0,6/20/2017,"Came in and waited about 45 mins for a party of 7. Sat down and waited some long minutes for our basic drinks. Service was not that great due to us waiting even longer for our drinks and food. Ordered spaghetti and meatballs, however, it was too saucy for me. The bread though...AWESOME!! My niece said it was delicious. Got the deep dish pizza - Great White! Great! Add some pepperoni and you got the ball rolling. Muy delicioso!! Gave it two stars for the food but service could have been better."
Jennifer M.,"Sacramento, CA",135,134,595,5.0,7/24/2016,"What can I say about the good ole American fare served up hot, flashy and delicious? Well I can say that this location is equally as delicious as the Arden Fair establishment I usually visit. This is a comfortable joint to kick it with a few friends or just classy enough for a Friday night date. The atmosphere is open, dressy casual, dim and cozy. Staff is ready for anything and aims to please. Food is always made to order and no fuss is made over extras or exceptions.  Drinks and Desserts are always offered and a really good idea! Plan accordingly as you do not want to be too full to miss out on the pizooki's. There are Happy Hour offerings which are an exceptional deal and a must! ***I love a good burger and BJ's burgers never dissapoints."
Christine S.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",4,3,,1.0,11/24/2017,"I typically like the BJ's in Folsom so we decided to try out the curbside pick up. What a horrible decision.  The estimated time was very reasonable, however, the actual time was three times the wait. The food was well packed and we assumed was still warm, since it did take extra long to prepare. We took the food out of the bags, after the short trip home, to find every item ordered ice cold. The shrimp was shrivelled up, the pizza's cheese was hard, the french fries were  hard, and the cajan pasta and chicken came with some surprise shrimp. Over all, was a horrible meal, I expected much better quality; so disappointed."
Tiffany N.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",207,368,59,1.0,1/3/2017,"Negative stars honestly need to be a freaking thing. The female hostess working on Sunday 1/1/17 at 715/720 has about the WORST customer service I've experienced in a long time. Called at around 630 to do a call ahead for 730. Guy confirms I'm in the system.  I get there at around 715 and the other half of my party is there and tell me that my call ahead wasn't in the system. I go to the hostess stand and double check. The girl goes ""yeah we can't find you."" Then...just a staring contest. I ask how long it would be if I were to add my name now and she goes to confer with the others behind her. My sister walks in and I explain to her how the call ahead didn't get through and now I'm checking wait times. The hostess returns and says ""well, you would've had to wait anyway because there are other large parties here that also called ahead, so..."" 1) That's not the point. The point is I called and confirmed my name on the list and no such thing ever occurred.  2) What if I called BEFORE the other parties? Now you'll never know because I wasn't on the list. It's like showing up before 2 parties and then being told well we never put your name down but you have to wait anyway. 3) HI, SOME SORT OF APOLOGY WOULD BE NICE. Like, I don't know - ""Sorry for the inconvenience."" ""I'm sorry we didn't get you on there I'll add you right now."" ""If it makes you feel better it probably would have been about the same wait time"" I don't know ANYTHING else but ""Well, you would've had to wait anyway."" Well...bye, Felicia."
Mai Britt M.,"Folsom, CA",83,8,3,1.0,11/23/2017,"I'm very disappointed with this restaurant. I called yesterday to make reservations for 12 for my son's birthday. They weren't even booked up, and after the Hostess asked the Manager for permission to reserve a table for a party of twelve, the Manager on duty decided not to allow it. We then called Pete's Pizza in El Dorado Hills, and they were, as always, more than happy to accomodate us. We had a wonderful dinner, and received amazing service, just not at BJ's."
Lexie K.,"Folsom, CA",0,11,4,2.0,7/28/2017,"I have waited quite some time to write this review in hopes that my experiences were maybe just a one-off, but it seems that isn't the case. I've eaten here plenty of times, both inside and takeout, and here's why this particular BJ's is getting 2 stars. Positive: Waiters, waitresses, and hosts are always nice. I have no issue with the customer service whatsoever, they have always been great. 1st Negative: Takeout is NEVER on time. When you say 20-25 mins and take 45-60, that's not cool. And it happens literally every time. The one that sticks out in my mind is when I waited over 50 mins in the takeout area for my food (a burger and chicken). And this was in addition to the 25 minutes that they said it would take. I'm a pretty patient person, but that's just insane. During that time all I was offered was a cup of water. Wonderful. 2nd Negative: The food itself. In the restaurant, the quality is fine. If you order takeout, it's awful. I have gotten soggy eggrolls, cold fries, overcooked and undercooked steaks, wilted salad, cold mashed potatoes, and burnt burgers. I live 5 mins from BJ's, doubt the drive caused any of that. 3rd Negative: The orders are always, always messed up. Sides of sauce are always missing, entree sides are usually wrong, modifications (i.e. no pickles) are forgotten, etc. And I totally understand that this happens sometimes, it's no big deal. But this happens every time. Every. Time.  So, BJ's, I tried to like you, but I don't. I think the kitchen may be the issue, but I really don't know. At this point, I'm over it. There are way better places in Folsom to eat!"
Brittany D.,"Fair Oaks, CA",116,268,41,5.0,1/4/2017,"My mom and I came here for lunch today and had really nice service.  Our waitress was very friendly and attentive.  The food was really good, and I was very happy with what I ordered.  I highly recommend the Mediterranean chicken pita tacos.  They come with a yummy greek yogurt sauce.  We also got the chicken potstickers appetizer and those were probably the best potstickers I've ever had.  We did not have to wait long for our food either!"
Jennifer C.,"Gilbert, AZ",1,16,5,5.0,8/18/2017,"We have gone three times this week and each time we've gotten something different .  It has been amazing!!! The steak is cooked to perfection, the chicken tortilla soup is yummy , and all of their salads we have had are pretty awesome!!!"
Shirley C.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",60,53,134,4.0,1/8/2017,"I usually come here after work to grab a quick bite or a drink. Service is attentive and on point. There's always a good selection on wines & bar (full bar FYI) but I usually order wine. The ambience is casual but also romantic. My favorite dishes are the seared ahi salad, bbq chicken pizza, or the pasta."
Christine B.,"Cameron Park, CA",79,1,,2.0,3/27/2017,"Never once have I had good service at this location. Servers always seem pissed off and as if we are an inconvenience. Thought our meal was on special but turns out it wasn't. Server didn't explain to us and failed to let us know that our meal was not included in the special so ended up paying full price. Next, we received wrong pizookie. Said they would remake it. Came out wrong again. Brought out a mini size instead of the regular size like we asked for. I cannot remember a single time I have had a memorable and enjoyable experience here. probably won't be going back."
Adrianne L.,"Sacramento, CA",146,8,19,4.0,4/9/2017,"We came here after a musical to have dinner and tried calling ahead as we had a fairly large group. After being told we could not place any type of reservation, arriving and were told we would be seated fairly quickly.  We were waiting for about 20 minutes and watched others be seated before us until we spoke to the hostess to inquire why we weren't being seated yet.  Through this, we asked to speak to the manager Mike and he immediately seated us.  After placing us with Brooke- who was very sweet and attentive, he said he would speak to his team about handling this issue. He took us under his care and made sure to accommodate us throughout dinner and into dessert.  Mike is a total boss and a true champion. He is the epitome of a proactive and hospitable manager and the only reason we won't cross this location off our places to bring our business."
Dan Asher D.,"Half Moon Bay, CA",44,18,19,3.0,1/13/2017,"The food is good as usual. They also have discounts so the price is decent.  The only problem I have is that their waitress is extra slow. Not to the point that she us really slow, it is just that there is too many people for her to handle. Well, she completely forgot about us, but oh well. And the people in our side and back.  Highlight: Understaffed..."
Jen B.,"Lodi, CA",0,39,,2.0,3/8/2017,"Took forever to get drinks or an order put in. Our server finally showed up, and complained about only having 2 tables to serve. I ordered a lunch size pasta and salad, but was charged full price instead. Not once did we get a refill, and it took so long to get the bill - we were already late for work and not in the mood to argue about what we were charged vs what we got.  Food did taste good, which at $21 pp for pasta and salad, in the $10 size, isn't enough of a positive to save the rating."
Kim Y.,"Folsom, CA",1,10,4,1.0,8/29/2017,Tonight I found out that customers can not participate in the new daily specials and also enjoy happy hour. It was a surprise and how the manager handled it was poorly executed.
Steph G.,"Sacramento, CA",560,790,1237,4.0,2/22/2016,"Chain-tastic! I don't care what anyone says, some chains are just that damn good. BJ's is one of those that I'll always patronize. The one in Folsom is really just because of it's location, not because I have a specific affinity for it. This last visit we were in a somewhat of a time crunch and our sweet server took to it with gusto. She was on top of everything and even snuck in a list minute pizookie order for us. Free appetizer. Check. Good meal. Check. Nice server. Check. Pizookie on point. Check. Sign up for their 'rewards' program so you can get a free appetizer, like I did. Also, you earn free $ towards your meals, so there's that too. Don't be bashful, it doesn't hurt to save money, at least in my baller-on-a-budget eyes! Same great atmosphere, lots of TVs with sports, plenty of seating, and a million servers to flag down. Consistent, just like Starbucks! Pizookie's are everything!"
Lindsay W.,"Sacramento, CA",130,20,30,4.0,5/28/2017,"Service was great, food was delicious and even though we had a million kids with us...it's a family friendly lunch spot."
Q A.,"Folsom, CA",8,101,2,5.0,9/10/2017,"Went there for Mrs birthday  last night. Used their app to shorten line wait time. They took us in within 10 minutes as opposed to 45 minutes wait time. Once inside,, their customer service was outstanding. The food was fresh and sizzling hot . The Bison burger was outstanding. The hand crafted root beer was very tasty."
Lysa D.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",33,274,89,4.0,10/25/2016,"The food is always good and the service is usually spot on. We had a time before where we came here and saw a ton of empty tables but waited 15 min for the hostess to seat us. She even seated others before us, who came in after us! We have the Premier Rewards card also so it's not like they had the card and we didn't. We had a $25 voucher for the Rewards loyalty program that we tried to use last night and were told the system wasn't working to give us that deal but they could give us a ""complimentary"" $10 off and we can use the $25 off next time. Well, that ""complimentary"" $10 off is the promotion they are running at the moment when you spend $35. I would rather them offer that promotion instead of acting like they did us a favor for giving us $10 off. Seemed kind of fake but oh well. Like I said, the food is always good and the menu is massive. Also, where is the pumpkin pizookie! We asked the hostess and she said to ask the waitress. We asked the waitress and she said she didn't know. We asked the manager and he said maybe sometime in mid Nov but not sure. I wish we had more of a concrete answer, esp because pumpkin is so amazing and its the end of Oct already!  We'll def be back since we love this place so much :)"
Michelle N.,"Chandler, AZ",27,303,38,1.0,10/18/2016,Went for a team dinner...one of the managers was carded and forgot her passport at the hotel....she wasn't able to have any alcohol...our lead asked for a manager and we were told that was the state law.  Slow service...was served the wrong wine...it was just strike after strike...we were obviously from Intel and were not trying to scam to get underage drinks. The food was very mediocre...most just half and didn't bother to bring home leftovers.
Gloria M.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",264,53,1,4.0,9/13/2017,"We have been here a few times, service has been good wait time hasn't been too bad, and food has been good, brunch was ok, not the best but wasnt bad. So far one of our favorites. We enjoy the Jambalaya, jalapeno burger w/ veggie patty,  wings, pasta, and beers are good."
Cynthia L.,"Electricistas, Morelia, Mexico",2,2,,5.0,9/15/2017,"Great craft beer, wish I could have tried more, the food is good, my favorite was the dessert, their cookies with ice cream are delicious, I had the salted caramel one"
J T.,"Pollock Pines, CA",0,89,42,5.0,3/18/2017,"My service was good and my food was great!  This was my first time at this place.  The building exterior needs a facelift. I had a very good burger and really good fries.  The margarita seemed a little sweet at first but had a nice unexpected kick.  Good thing I only had one.  I avoid going places where people go when people are there so I was there when it wasn't that busy. I also waited tables for 20 years so I take everything into consideration.  my server was, if anything, overly attentive.  Delish. I'll be back."
Lawrence D.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",368,109,123,4.0,4/27/2016,"Sure it's BJ's. You've been there a thousand times. But the location on East Bidwell in Folsom was a great experience.  It's been there for a number of years now but it's still still super clean and well maintained. Vibrant colors, well taken care of and great vibe.  It's a really fun place. Great layout with large bar area, booths, tables and area for larger groups in back.  The food was good. I mean really good for chain style eating faire. I had the calamari and a flat bread pizza. My friends had the gluten free pizza and salads. Everyone said the food was good and had no complaints.  The server was awesome. She kept up filled up and met all our needs on a very timely and friendly manner. That's hard to find these days.  The bar area was really fun. We had a booth. The Warriors playoff game was on and lots of people were there. Not just the bar but the whole restraint had lots of people which is fantastic for an early Saturday. Great fun vibe going on.  Usually I don't give chain restaurants good ratings or I don't post them at all but BJs in Folsom deserves the love. Good job and Thanks."
E.S. M.,"Pine Grove, CA",9,4,1,1.0,11/1/2017,"My wife Vicki and I have eaten at B.J, s. in Folsom almost since they opened always high marks from our experiences. Even bought gift cards and beer glasses to take home and give as gifts.  But yesterday Oct.31 2017 at around 4:00pm was different.  If you were there did you notice how slippery and unsafe the floors were and no ""Slippery Be Careful"" caution signs. Did you fall or almost fall? The management was very neglect in my opinion by not addressing the very real safety matter of the slippery floors throughout the restaurant  We were a party of four and no sooner did we start to walk to our tables when my wife slipped and fell hard on the floor. Hours later at Sutter Hospital in Jackson she was diagnosed with a fractured knee cap(patella) in med terms.  Management said the floors were cleaned last night and although appeared helpful they were not acknowledging the dangers of the slippery floors. Or indicated any remedy to prevent others from falling and getting injured. If you fell or notices the slippery floors. Please add your own observation"
Cindy Q.,"Garden Valley, CA",0,10,,2.0,11/6/2017,"The only positive I have for this restaurant is that the service was very good, despite the fact that it was a busy night. The food was terrible and the atmosphere is awful. The noise volume is very loud and there were a large number of families with unruly children running wild. One child was jumping around and stomped on my foot, but when I announced that the child had stomped on my foot and asked whose child it was, nobody claimed to be the parents. We will not be going back!"
