Lou D.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",5,16,53,3.0,9/16/2015,"Went in the location Monday night, the service was very good, but the food was simply not up to par. Not sure what going on in the kitchen but they need to step up there game as it was very good in the past maybe it was a off night    Three stars was related to the service"
Rolando B.,"Sacramento, CA",2,13,,2.0,3/3/2015,Pizza  was good we got the BBQ  chicken  but service sucked. It was slow  Tuesday  night and waiter was  no where to be found
Joanne R.,"Folsom, CA",0,2,,1.0,2/24/2016,BJs Folsom.Service left a lot to be desired. Food was disappointing. Not well prepared. Questioning why id want to go back again  not even 4 the beer. Used to be one of my top eat out places.
Jennilea D.,"Orangevale, CA",0,4,,1.0,3/17/2015,"I will admit that it has been a couple of months since I have been to BJ's and I was very disappointed that they took my grilled chicken pasta away.  Then I looked at the rest of the menu and realized that they have changed yet again.  I understand that bringing new menu items is important, but continuously taking away things that people like is not good for business.  So my family and I will not be going back as we are not sure what the menu would be the next time.  Too much change to recipes and menu."
Shelly A.,"Citrus Heights, CA",10,71,17,5.0,3/29/2015,Came in a week ago and was served by Ashley. Wonder service! Had the pull pork sandwich. Delicious! Always love this place. Some much variety and always amazing. Gotta get the pazookie.
Mary G.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",0,32,1,3.0,8/16/2015,"I had gluten-free pizza and gluten-free pale ale.  The pizza was one of the best GF pizza's I've had but it still needed a lot of work - a bowl of pizza sauce to dip it in would have done wonders as well as some generous toppings.  The pizza crust is super thin like all other GF pizza's but the sauce and cheese was VERY sparse, and it didn't really taste like pizza (bland).   The beer was awesome!  I might go back just for the beer.  I was excited to see baked potato on the menu but I wasn't about to spend over $7 for a baked potato with some butter on it (thats just stupid overpriced).  My friend had the jambalaya and he said it was VERY spicy and delicious (at $16 a plate it should be). Over all it was okay for a typical sports-bar / pub place.  I don't think it would be my first choice thou only because the food is too overpriced and the GF options are not very plentiful."
Hortensia M.,"San Leandro, CA",88,7,5,2.0,12/23/2014,So me and my family went here for dinner after graduation and we had to wait about an hour to be seated I ordered the shrimp scampi the shrimp was good the pasta was dry and bland I had the buffalo wings they were very good the server was very nice and patient and the place was very noisy but overall I was around good company so I guess I had a good time
Lynelle R.,"Pilot Hill, CA",7,6,,1.0,2/19/2016,We went to this place last Sat afternoon for my grand daughters birthday. It was not very busy and I now can see why. 9 people in our party. We all ordered different items and everyone came out luke warm or still frozen in the middle in the case of the chicken tenders. The food was mediocre to say the least and I think $150 dollars for a bad lunch is ridiculous. How can anyone screw up a baked stuffed  potato but they did cold plus $8.00. Will never set foot in there again.
Chad C.,"Folsom, CA",37,7,,4.0,9/6/2015,"This place has a great bar. Nice tv's to watch sports and have a drink. Food is ok but the gluten free pizza is awesome! The price is fair and the employees are well trained and very nice. I'd say it's a pretty classy place for a ""brewery""."
Connor S.,"Folsom, CA",3,23,2,4.0,12/22/2014,I have been going to this place forever I still remember the smiley faced French fries I would order as a kid they have great pazooki or that stuff w/the ice cream and cookie it's amazing I have also gotten the baby back ribs they are extremely good they have a lot of TVs including a bar it is a great place to eat I highly recommend it.
Jastadad I.,"Folsom, CA",0,9,,4.0,7/23/2015,"I have ways liked BJs. Every time I have been, I have had a good experience with the service, descent food, good beer. You really can't go wrong at BJs. It's not so awesome to wait around on the busy days though. Just a great place for a casual lunch and a good beer."
Meghan L.,"Sacramento, CA",190,192,12,3.0,1/20/2014,"Usually BJs is not a bad place to eat. It's always busy and the food is good. I never know what to get since there are a lot of choices. That's why I gave it 3 stars because the food is good. I got the clam chowder, shrimp tacos and a pazookie. The pazookie was huge and was unable to finish. My husband got the pork chop and our friends got spicy spaghetti and avocado egg rolls.   The pizza and beer is great too.  Let's get down to business. Reason why I gave it 3 was due the service. Our waiter was not the best. One we got food but no utensils and had to wait to ask before eating our food. Second of all he never refilled out water. I had to drink my friends water. And it took us three times to ask for a box. People were running into my chair and not even saying sorry. That's the reason for 3 stars. Lucky the food is good."
Kirk W.,"Folsom, CA",0,11,,1.0,1/1/2016,"Seated almost right away (place was not at all full) - then were ignored for 15 minutes until I walked up and asked if anyone had let out server know we were her table (we are VIP members so we had a little ticket that said what time we were seated and who our server was).  5 minutes later another server came up to say ""I wanted to recognize that you are here and tell you I am NOT your server""(Gee - thanks for all the help, Pal). Manager comes up (we've been seated for over 20 minutes at this point) and ends up taking our drink/food order. Nothing for 25 minutes (unless you count the server coming up and snootily telling is how busy she got - really - you haven't had time for us in 45 minutes????). Food started to arrive at the 50 minute mark. My nephew never got the side of dressing he asked for. When the manager takes your order and never checks to see if you got your food, nor offers to adjust anything on the bill - the message is clear WE DON'T CARE WHETHER YOU EVER COME BACK!!!! And looking at the comments, its obvious BJ's plays the Yelp game. They suck. Their management sucks."
Jeffrey F.,"Kennesaw, GA",4,80,1,5.0,2/22/2015,"Great fish and chips!  Didn't except that from this restaurant but they were amazing.  Very busy on a random evening but I guess that is good for the business.  Their Cream Soda, Orange Soda and Root Beer is tasty as well."
Josh I.,"Woodstock, IL",1,9,31,5.0,9/8/2015,Just wanted to say it was pleasant to have such a personable waitress the other night after working all day moving. Taylor was working the seating area in the bar where we chose to sit after a kid said he'd be with us in a few minutes before he could help us; but was standing around doing nothing. Open seating in the bar is always a plus when you don't want to wait around. She made great suggestions for beers and eats and it was awesome. She suggested honey mustard to go with the potato wedges which was perfect combo. Being a business owner this girl has what it takes to come work for me if she ever wanted. I'd be happy to take her off your hands. I just hope Taylor is there next time we come in. Her constant smile definitely made the day a little easier. Maybe get some new hosts and hostess that don't stand around the podium flirting with each other all the time. Or maybe they should just be aware that people are watching them.
John D.,"Sacramento, CA",0,7,,1.0,11/5/2015,"Maybe it was just this location... I drove people out to this location expecting the usual, boy was i wrong. After getting seated, it took 15 minutes to get the waiter to come over. I see they have Guinness so i order one, the waiter spends about 5 minutes trying to get me to change my order to one of their house beers, not good. Then when i order a burger he doesn't ask how i want it cooked, so i tell him i want it rare, which he didn't write down. After 30 minutes with no food (it wasn't that busy) the waiter finally comes by to say our food will be ready soon. Well 10 minutes more and we finally have food, sort of. My fries are cold and the burger looks like it was cooked to charcoal. My daughters pizza was barely warm, the pan was not even warm to the touch. I have eaten at other BJ's locations and they were fine. You should avoid this location, it is terrible!!"
Jake S.,"Placerville, CA",216,3,2,4.0,4/25/2016,"I ordered a bacon avocado burger as I was out to lunch with my buddy. My burger came out in 10 minutes which was great, however my buddies sandwich came out 20minutes later. As a good friend, I did not eat without him. In turn the temp of the burger dropped to below room temp, which made it taste terrible. The manager knew that the sandwich took extra long and offered to make a new burger and take it off my bill. Great hospitality and customer service, despite the long wait."
Carl E.,"Folsom, CA",5,24,1,4.0,6/29/2013,"I went here with my wife and kids a few days ago after the fourth consecutive late night for my kids VBS.  We were seated very quickly and almost instantly knew what we wanted to order.  Our server was very efficient even though it was busy. The food here is not spectacular but for a large chain restaurant it is above average.  I had the turkey club sandwich and it was good but not great.  None of the ingredients really stood out on the sandwich.  The shoe string french fries were cooked well but needed some salt.  I also had a bite of my son's mashed potatoes with gravy and they were good but the gravy had way too much black pepper in it.  It was almost all you could taste. Overall, this place is very good when you are in a pinch and want more variety and options than the standard fast food route.  It is not a place you seek out, but it is serviceable option."
Christina M.,"Roseville, CA",0,6,,1.0,12/12/2015,Call ahead apparently does not work here.  Called ahead and was put on the list and told it was a 20 minute wait.  Got there about 10 minutes later and was told we would have a 20 minute wait -_-
Melissa P.,"Aiken, SC",3,14,1,1.0,6/23/2015,1:45pm.  Not super busy.  We got seated and waited for 8-10 minutes without anyone coming to us to even get a drink order.  Just left and are headed to one of the other restaurants around to give them our money instead.
