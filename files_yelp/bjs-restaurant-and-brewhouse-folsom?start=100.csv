Zach K.,"Sacramento, CA",36,95,90,3.0,7/6/2016,Meh. Hit or miss on service. Food is average really and super overpriced. Much better options in the area.
Janiah S.,"Folsom, CA",0,35,40,4.0,3/28/2016,"Service is always top notch. Nice, clean and laid back atmosphere. They have a huge beer selection for the beer drinkers out there. The new Siracha chicken bacon Mac n cheese is very good, but pretty rich, so I couldn't finish it. But it was very good. A little kick, not bad at all."
Tina D.,"Folsom, CA",14,26,61,4.0,12/17/2015,"I have lived in Folsom my entire life and have always underestimated bjs. It wasn't that I ever had a poor experience, I just suppose that I never had a memorable one.. Until lately that is...  My jam: I will only sit at the bar.  I love the enlightened menu.  Love that the tvs are on mute and there is decent music playing.  Constant/attentive service.  And the mini pizookie blows doors.  I feel like the bar should be longer, but I understand it's a limited space. Whoever the bartender is on Saturday and/or Sunday mornings is wonderful. He is mellow and his vibe is ideal. They have a killer Bloody Mary and mimosa brunch special. The well vodka for the bloody is Absolute and you can upgrade to kettle for around a $1 and some change. Score!  I wish they had a juke box, that is one thing that would take this place up a notch.  Food is good, not amazing... But its definitely good. I will say that I wish it was delivered to the table hotter... Call me a lush but I don't think it's too much to ask. I appreciate the little things.  :) I will definitely add bj's to my current rotation, and I'll most definitely recommend this joint to others."
JoAnn N.,"Sparks, NV",0,2,,3.0,5/12/2017,"I would like to update my review about BJs in Folsom.  I originally had a really tough time getting the manager of this location to respond to my complaint that I didn't get the items that I ordered in a curbside to go order.  It took a few tries, but I must admit that Jacob, the GM of BJs in Folsom did me a solid and satisfied my complaint.  Thanks Jacob, for your attention to detail and meeting my expectations above and beyond."
Jason C.,"Shingle Springs, CA",6,36,28,4.0,11/28/2015,"So in general I enjoy to sit and eat at all restaurant bars if possible. BJs has an amazing bar. I do feel like it should be a little longer and whats with the two seat low corner on the end?..... Oh well, all of that really doesn't matter because the service, and the food were amazing. The menu is somewhat of a book that can be a little tough to navigate but believe me if you are hungry take the time to read it. If you are a craft brew fanatic this is a good stop so put it on your list. I ordered the wings with the xxxxtra hot buffalo sauce. The sauce wasn't as hot as the menu would lead you to believe but as a wing addict these were very good. I give BJs Brewhouse 4 stars, the atmosphere is inviting and there is something for everyone to enjoy. It's definitely a staple  in Folsom and now I know why."
Joey B.,"Sacramento, CA",359,483,1528,5.0,10/6/2014,"Had the best costumer service ever.. treated me like family... I love it.. and omg! You guys need to try the Punkin' Pazooki... it's sofa king delish! It just melts in your mouth heavily...  This needs to be in the menu often and not just the fall season, just saying. Namm sayinn.. loves it. Thank you BJs."
S B.,"Sacramento, CA",0,63,32,3.0,6/24/2016,"Let's say you are, driving across the country. You've been driving all day, you're tired. You're hungry. You need something to eat. You know what you like. You like burgers and fries. You stop at McDonald's because they all look the same and you know exactly what you're getting, whether you're in San Diego or Atlanta. If you have time to look stuff up and maybe check your Yelp or something then you find the place that does crawdads or bison steaks. That's... why you go to BJ's. You know exactly what you're getting. It's a known commodity. That said, BJ's, and chain brew pubs like them have always been an anomaly to me. If all I want to do is eat, I'll go to Burger King. If all I want to do is eat, and I want to go to a nice place, I'll go to a nice place to eat. If I want to hang around and drink, I'll go to some old, rustic pub with some character to it. Bricks. Real bricks. Massive wooden timber trusses. The thing about BJ's, and the strip malls in which they sit, is that Scotty can teleport you to one in Fresno, Stockton, Sacramento, Los Angeles, Phoenix, or wherever they have these things and you wouldn't have a clue where you were because they all look exactly the same, and they all have the aroma of fresh stucco and construction adhesive. Kind of like the rest of the strip mall, as well as the oversized, overpriced, slapped together in a hurry tract homes in the neighborhoods surrounding the area. Which is fine and all, except... the place isn't cheap. It's kind of pricey, for what it is. The food is fine, I can usually manage to order up something that will fit within my special dietary requirements and enjoy it most places, and this place is no exception, but food wise, although it's better than Denny's, it isn't much better. It still has the ambiance of a hospital cafeteria, and, well there are the TV's. Obviously I've gone there, and more than once, but generally I'm with a group or it's someone else's idea. If I'm meeting someone for whatever reason, the place really doesn't matter. Otherwise, if I'm hanging out, I'm not going to be in the middle of suburbia anyway, so I guess a BJ's wouldn't be applicable. Don't take this as a negative. It's a fine place to bring a group of people. Be prepared to drop some coin. The menu is big enough most people can be accommodated. Also, they are a brew pub, so if thick, sugary, syrupy, overly-hopped craft beers are your thing (and there are lots of people that do like them) then this is your place."
Ashley M.,"Windsor, CA",26,40,18,2.0,11/11/2014,"Every time I go in the hostess's are so inattentive and always just chatting. Last time I got to go the food was ruined from sitting in the warmer while waiting for a salad. Also the salad hardly came with any dressing. I was scrapping it out of the cup to even get half what should be on the salad. They had told me when i called that it would be 20 minutes. When i arrived i had to wait another 15. I went back and it was replaced but the manager for some reason kept asking me if it was the portion size... That had nothing to do with it. Then I had to wait another 20 minutes to get my food. No offer to refund the meal or anything. Very disappointed. The last and final time I went in was not as bad as an experience. Very slow to get the food but it was OK. Except for the $10 avocado eggrolls. One of my rolls came with literally only avocado while the other came with the cream cheese, spicy sauce , etc. See pic."
Chandler E.,"Cool, CA",43,9,,5.0,10/20/2016,"I always have an amazing experience at BJ's, I've lived in the area for many years and always loved coming here. Everyone is super friendly, food is great, and the servers are quick and attentive!! The main reason I love this place is their host, Jennifer Ussery. She is the best host in the world! I've seriously never had a host care so much about her customers than she does. She makes BJs 1000000x better. Plus, she's really cute ;)"
Jessi L.,"Folsom, CA",0,11,,4.0,4/17/2017,"The food is good and the wait staff have always been friendly. The only complaint I have is that there are few vegetarian options on the menu, but this is not a vegetarian restaurant so I understand. Overall, this is an amazing dining experience."
Aja K.,"Sacramento, CA",18,29,16,2.0,7/12/2016,"Walked to table...food on seat and a white handprint...had to wait for them to clean table while we stood. Was given two sample beers...glasses had residual food (beer glasses should be exceptionally clean as dirty glasses do not allow the head of the beer to form.  Waitress was not very welcoming and could not find her to get condiments for table. Additionally, my guest had only drank 1/4 glass of beer and I had eaten 1 fish from my fish and chips when offered dessert (no!, I don't want dessert when no one has finished their meals. Then a few minutes later bill was placed on table (felt rushed even though restaurant closes at midnight). Definitely, not my favorite BJs, such a let down when the one at Arden Mall and Elk Grove are much better."
Bobbi B.,"Sloughhouse, CA",32,18,,4.0,3/23/2016,"Hubby and I sometimes stop in BJ's for lunch or Happy Hour. Service has been A++ except for once (that means a lot of our visits were much better than A++)! The menu is too big to read in a single sitting but you really can't miss. At Happy Hour, their fantastic mini pizzas are half price! Once we ordered one to share but learned that one is just right for one! Soup/Salad/1/2 sandwich combos also great and their rewards program is pretty good as well. Going tomorrow to help celebrate my grandson's 8th birthday!"
Isabella J.,"Orangevale, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/22/2016,"Nikki was the absolute worst waitress I have ever had. Never in my life have I had worse service. Not only were we ignored for the majority of our time, she made the executive decision on her own to keep my change from my tab without asking. And when I confronted her about not giving me my change she rudely made a remark along the lines of ""you want your dollar back?"". She also took our order wrong and when we said something, the boy who brought us our food rudely interrupted and said he would take it to the back and take the bacon off. Keep in mind bacon being on the burger wasn't the only problem... Good place just avoid Nikki being your waitress."
Cerita D.,"Sacramento, CA",1,7,,3.0,9/9/2016,"BJs was very busy and forgot to seat us.  They brought the wrong food.  But there was an amazing server.  Her name is Casey.  She was over the top helpful, checked in frequently, was patient and friendly. She made sure we didn't feel rushed and when we asked her to give us a minute she returned in a reasonable time there to help us with a smile. She deserves HUGE thank you.  She made dinner pleasurable.  Thank you Casey."
JoAnna E.,"Citrus Heights, CA",0,19,15,1.0,8/19/2016,"Had lunch there 8/18/16...Had a great time, only bc of the company I had... Food was gross, we couldn't understand a word the hostess said to us, no eye contact and murmuring her directions to us. We had the calamari, barely any batter and way under cooked. We also shared the southwestern salad, old lettuce and warm, like it had been sitting out for awhile.  I've never liked this place, but my company chose to go here for lunch. Our waitress was kind and simply did her job, keeping our waters filled and checking on us.  If i can avoid bjs in the future, I will! Overall, YUCK!"
Eric K.,"West Sacramento, CA",53,468,156,3.0,12/7/2015,Came here to get a gift card since they don't sell them anywhere such as walgreens or safeway.   It was decent service it took a few minutes before someone came to the take out delivery register.   But it was easy to order a $25 gift card.
James P.,"Alameda, CA",0,33,5,1.0,9/10/2016,"Didn't realize Visconte's Italian restaurant was closed for lunch on Mondays so we walked over to BJ's.... What a mistake! The food is what it is, the service is another story.  Entrees came with the appetizers even though the restaurant was only half full. The waitress forgot one of the entrees for our table of four, so we stairs at each other for ten minutes and watched our food get cold while we waited. I figure that's just a corporate restaurant thing. Then, walking back to the car, one of our party got sick and ran into Land Ocean Restaurant next door to use the restroom. She got food poisoning from BJ's French dip sandwich. Clearly the bar is what keeps them in business.I highly recommend you eat elsewhere."
Jazmine D.,"Minneapolis, MN",958,348,765,5.0,6/6/2015,"Always a great place to eat! We stopped by today for lunch during a shopping adventure in Folsom! The outside looks nice! When you approach the building, you just know that you are in for a good experience!  Upon walking in, we were greeted by the most friendly hostess! The hostess had a nice welcoming smile. The greeting was genuine and we truly felt welcome here. She greeted and seated us. We asked what was good and she made a quick recommendation before going back to her host stand!  Almost instantly after being seated, a friendly server came to the table. Her name was Stephanie. She explained the menu to us and made recommendations. We asked for shrimp cocktail which she was very sad to announce that they didn't have. She did offer to talk to the manager and the chef to ask if they could make it for us but we said that was ok.  We ordered the soup in the bread bowl and it was delicious! It had to have been the best tasting bread bowl that I had in awhile. It was the perfect lunch for someone who is not wanting a full meal!  Overall I would say this place was a 5 and I would defiantly come back for more!"
Jason M.,"Los Angeles, CA",268,10,,4.0,8/12/2016,"Whenever you are looking for a general spot with many food options, this is the place to go. The food is absolutely amazing. The service is great and it is also has a convivial atmosphere! Four stars forsure!"
Eric L.,"Rocklin, CA",104,15,1,5.0,7/27/2016,"Wonderful evening with wonderful food. They did a great job! First time in a while to a BJ's, and they did not let me down. The desert was amazing."
