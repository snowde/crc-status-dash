G S.,"Oakland, CA",1,41,48,3.0,7/19/2015,Food is pretty good but the service is always bad with a group. Food comes out at different times.  Poor rating for groups. Great for 2-4 people.  I had the cherry salmon. It was good and light.  They forgot my daughters dish and rectified the error with a free dish. Good save. But group service should improve.  Burgers are good. Fries are good. I recommend this place if you have no more than 4 people.
Shawn C.,"Sparks, NV",0,2,,1.0,10/2/2016,"I'm generally not one to complain but dang!  Cold salad served on a warm dirty plate, then transferred to a warm clean plate?  Not good!  Then to top it off, ordered the shrimp and asparagus with penny pasta, $16.25 for three shrimp, 5 or 6 pieces (not sprigs) of asparagus?  At least it contained a lot of pasta!  Good job!"
John H.,"Sacramento, CA",0,44,,5.0,12/18/2015,"Had lunch here with a group of friends on Tuesday.  I've had lunch here 3 times in the past 2 years and liked all the food I got, great service, a tad high on price but all the decent places are going up.  If you like beer, their wait staff are very knowledgeable on their variety and the characteristics of each, and will bring samples if you want to try something....very cool!   I had the roast beef dip sandwich with horseradish and au jus with shoestring French fries....delicious.  In the past I've had their California chicken club and twice had personal sized pizzas, all excellent.   As our ex-governator once said......I'LL BE BACK!!!!!!"
Margot R.,"Fair Oaks, CA",1,109,138,2.0,5/3/2016,"What has happened to this place? It used to be so amazing and then service went way down. The food quality stayed the same, good, but the service has drastically changed over time. It's very sad because I used to love to go here and now I hate going here because of the service. This establishment should hire more staff. People don't want to have to wait 30 minutes to order and then another 40 to 60 Minutes for their food to arrive."
Scott I.,"Pollock Pines, CA",1,31,,2.0,5/26/2015,"Was taken to lunch here by a friend, so no expectations. The  surroundings were nice, service was good, but the food was unremarkable with too much salt. It reminded me of a Chili's, Fridays, Applebees, etc. I can understand it if it's the only place nearby, but with all Folsom has to offer, why would you choose to go here?"
Cassidy S.,"Folsom, CA",2,15,10,4.0,4/22/2016,"Another favorite restaurant of mine! I love the food here so much. The menu has a great variety for just about anything you're craving: juicy burgers, soups, crisp salads, & even some great healthier options (my favorites are their quinoa bowls). Not to mention their amazing pizookies! The service is pretty good as well, but there's a little room for improvement here. From my experience, the food takes a little while to come out, but it is always delicious. Despite the bar, it's very family friendly and an enjoyable environment for all ages."
Laurissa B.,"Sacramento, CA",37,137,60,3.0,4/22/2015,"Restaurant clean and sparkly. Blonde host...she was ok. Waitress: Audrea ? I think... She wasn't really memorable and didn't make much of a friendly connection. She was pleasant though.  Food: eh. My sons chicken fingers and happy face fries were great. My dish, skimpy on the pork meat and everything was just overly drenched in BBQ sauce. I would never order that again. I did get a suggestion from one of the other employees to get their Asian chop salad.  Still like this place, hopefully food will be better next time."
Hannah T.,"Asheboro, NC",98,24,,3.0,6/18/2016,"Kind of disappointed with this place. The last time we went the food was decent but the staff was not too great. Our waitress barely paid any attention to us and was distracted by her coworkers the whole time. The pizza was good but all of the other dishes we had seemed like frozen pre made stuff. Overall, I give them a 3."
Haley S.,"Shingle Springs, CA",0,4,,1.0,5/30/2016,"Only giving them 1 star because 0 is not an option. It was no doubt the worst service I have ever had at any restaurant. Our waitress frequently rolled her eyes at us and then prompted to leave halfway through our meal, without saying a goodbye. I will not be coming back to pay high prices for mediocre food and absolutely horrible service."
Mary M.,"Sparks, Reno, NV",12,31,3,2.0,4/8/2016,The positive: great ribs and BBQ sauce. The negative: my clam chowder had undone potatoes but the flavor was great. My Ziti had undone pasta but the sauce and meat were good. Last but not least I got one cook and asked two times for a refill and didn't get it. I won't be back.
Ronny S.,"Gold River, CA",687,205,212,3.0,4/16/2014,"Hi-ya! The place is busy and food pretty good, but honestly some of the servers need to polish up the game. Our server honesty sucked...I saw him waiting other tables and the way he talked and provided service was something I would expect from a fast food place. Luckily he went on break and another server came to relieve him and was great. I don't expect servers to treat you like royalty, but if it's a sit and tip...then well you gotta earn your tip with service. 5 stars to the relief server, 1 for the original server...so 3 stars overall."
Jane S.,"Sacramento, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/23/2016,"If you are looking for a place to eat for a party of more than 6 do NOT go here!  We called at 2:00 to make a reservation for a party of 8 at 6:30 and was told that they only had a 5:30 or 8:00 reservation available but if we called a half an hour before 6:30 we could ask them to place us on their wait list so the table is ready for us at 6:30.  I thought that was a little weird because why not just take the reservation instead of making us take this extra step?  But since we were celebrating a 21st birthday I said that was fine, we will call back.  We called back at 5:50 thinking 10 mins early wouldn't matter to place us on the wait list for the 6:30 table.  Wrong!  Was told I needed to call back 30 mins before the time we wanted.  Fine.  Waited 10 mins then called again asking to be placed on the waiting list for a party of 8 for 6:30.  This time I was told they can't do that and I needed to come in and sign in and that the wait for a table is currently around 45 mins to an hour!  Are you kidding me?!?  If that is the case why wasn't I told the other two times I called?!?   Absolutely a horrible place!  If you are looking for a place in Folsom to eat I would suggest going to Chilis located at 161 Iron Poinft Road instead of BJ.  Chilis had more space, great food, and a more efficient and friendly staff! Definitely will not go back to BJ's in folsom!"
Janet M.,"Fair Oaks, CA",29,79,50,3.0,10/15/2016,"Well I gave it three stars due to the fact there was four of us and two of the people enjoy their meals. Unfortunately I was the one who did not enjoy my meal... First, I ordered wine and the glass had lipstick all over it and was handed to me by the waiter and he poured the carafe of wine into my filthy wine glass .... I pointed out the lipstick and he did take my wine glass and my carafe of wine and brought me a new glass and a carafe. Second, I always cut my burgers in half because I usually cannot eat a full burger... When I cut my burger in half it crumbled because it was so over cooked and it was a Blue cheese burger and I swear I could not taste any blue cheese. I even asked the waiter if they put blue cheese on it and he said yes and a chipotle sauce. My friend ordered the regular hamburger and hers was pink and juicy however her fries look like they were cooked three or four times she could not even eat them... day old fries... we laughed because they looked horrible. We were going to tell the waiter however we had a new waiter that showed up at the end when we were done eating. We left and probably will go somewhere else next time... the menu is to many pages I think 15 or so...."
Debbie A.,"San Ramon, CA",0,21,,1.0,5/28/2016,"Terrible quality of food, especially for the price.  Poor service.   I've been to other bjs and find they are just adequate but this one is rock bottom for both quality and service."
Jessica H.,"Folsom, CA",15,65,41,1.0,2/1/2015,We have had good service inside the restaurant.  This review is not for that.  This review is for the delivery service.  We ordered delivery at 5:50 and were told our food would be delivered in 30min (We live about 2 miles away from the restaurant) we recieved our food at 7:25. All the delivery person said was sorry for it taking so long.  We did call and talk to the manager who was very apologetic and did not offer any excise as to why the delay.  We will NOT order delivery again.
Mia J.,"Folsom, CA",0,9,,5.0,11/18/2016,"Im not sure if im spelling her name correctly, but ashani was awesome ! She served our party of 8 tonight she kept the drinks coming and was very caring and considerate of our table. She was accomodating the whole time and i hope she sees this review ! I hope all of your servers are as invested in their job, thank you for making this a fun experience for myself and my friends."
Martin M.,"Roseville, CA",1,2,,1.0,12/29/2014,"This experience at BJ's was the worst I've ever had.  I want to like the place, but as of now the only reason to go there is the bar. I ordered take out this evening and it didn't go well. The order: 1 Nacho 1 Pale Ale Chili 1 Beef Sliders 1 Avocado Egg Roll 1 Pepsi The problem - when I arrived at the curb side takeout, I called the number and it took quite a while just to get someone to pickup the phone.  Irritating but not the main complaint. The chips of the nachos were covered with the mix and thrown in a tin.  Maybe I'm asking too much but I have come to expect through my to-go orders that the chips and the mix are separated so you don't end up with nacho soup.   The bowl of Pale Ale Chili would have been great if I wasn't given a cup. The beef sliders were missing everything but the lettuce and pickle.  According to the online menu, I'm missing onions and ketchup. The avocado egg rolls didn't taste like they usually do, some how between the spices and cooking process, the avocado tasted metallic ( two others verified this, unprompted and I didn't ask a loaded question; ""Like does it taste like metal?"", the plus side being I know I'm not completely nuts.   The Pepsi.  This was ridiculous.  I ordered a Pepsi, that was $2.95.  I knew it might be quite over priced.  Wow was I off.  The plastic cup that I was given is smaller than a red SOLO cup.  Oh and they were out of lids, so the whole way home I played don't spill the soda.   Short of wanting ""A Drink Like That"" - I will never be going back there."
Gary P.,"Placerville, CA",1,39,,2.0,12/14/2014,"Dine at Bj's occasionally.  The place is kind of noisy, but the food is usually good.  Yesterday's experience was almost an hour and a half proposition however.  Ordered our two hand tossed pizzas with extra sauce and they came out 20 minutes later deep dish and almost zero sauce.  Bone-dry really.  The server was nice, and  assured us the manager would come by and we would be taken care of. Several minutes later, the server came back and told us the manager had re submitted our orders and our food would be out soon.  About 30 minutes later or so later, our order came out.  They obviously made NO extra effort to get our food out to us since the thin crust pizzas too longer to get out than the deep dish.  At least, this time our food was perfect. When we got our bill, we noticed they had given about an $11.00 discount.  That was appreciated, but we were a bit miffed that the manager couldn't find 60 seconds of his/her time to stop by our table to make sure we were satisfied and offer an apology. A quick visit from the manager to our table would have gotten this review an extra star and our appreciation.  A sense of urgency from the kitchen to get our food out quickly would have produced an extra star as well."
Sarah H.,"Shingle Springs, CA",0,5,,4.0,2/23/2015,"Food is excellent here however the girl who served us was horrible. Not only did she forget one of our orders but it seemed as thought she didn't even care that we had to wait an extra 25 minutes on our food. After that happened she completely stopped coming to our table as if she was mad at us for something we did. Then to top it off was supposed to refill my drink and didn't even bother to come by. Her apology was not sympathetic at all.   Thank goodness for the manager who was on tonight, who made our forgotten dish complimentary, and our desserts was well. The pepperoni extra pizza is to die for and so are the potato appetizers and the bbq salad. Oh and can't forget the calamari"
Jenelle J.,"Sacramento, CA",111,421,102,5.0,4/9/2015,"We came here for a birthday dinner and were seated right away. We ordered two drinks, my margarita was awesome and my husband loved his beer! She even brought him tasters to help him decide on what one he wanted... thank you!  We ordered two burgers, which were awesome. They brought the wrong fries with one but they instantly fixed this issue which is great customer service. We then got our free mini pazooki which was sooo yummy. The waitress recommended the salted caramel, and boy am I glad she did! It was like a chocolate chip cookie with ice cream and caramel drizzle on top mmmmm  Oh, and the total price of the two BJ's burgers were only $6 more than two Carls Jr. burgers. Skip the fast food if you are paying just as much and come here... you will not regret it!  Thank you! We will be back!"
