Dale B.,"Shingle Springs, CA",10,66,3,4.0,4/5/2015,"This BJ's is light years above the one in San Bruno. Probably not even in the same galaxy. So when you launch your rocket to go to a BJ's set the controls for Folsom,CA.  We always have a good experience here.  Beware on the return trip you may have to jettison some of your cargo if you have a pazookie!"
Josh N.,"Folsom, CA",611,1292,568,3.0,11/23/2014,"Came here on Thursday to finally witness a Raider win and I realized I had never written a review. Always have gotten friendly service and the food, except for a Chili Cheeseburger many years ago, has been decent. My go to order is BJ's Favorite Pizza. It has meatballs, pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, black olives, white onions and seasoned tomatoes. I recommend not ordering it in the mini version because the toppings will suffer. Get a large and take home the leftovers."
C F.,"Fair Oaks, CA",1,7,,5.0,8/30/2015,"We always have an excellent experience at BJ's! And we love the benefits we get from their Premier Rewards program. Their menu has a great variety of meal and drink choices. When we eat here with friends or family, we are able to easily accommodate everyone's food preferences. They even offer options for people with special dietary restrictions, such as their Gluten-Free Menu. In the past, we've enjoyed: Pizzas, Fish n Chips, Salads, Jambalaya, Burgers, Mojitos, Margaritas, Sparkling Wine and various options from their handcrafted beer menu.  We went there for an early dinner before going to a concert at Three Stages. We ordered: Strawberry Lemonade, Calamari, Ahi Poke, Baby Back Ribs, Caesar Salad, Crispy Fries and a Pizookie (Chocolate Chunk topped with Vanilla Bean ice cream). Everything was perfect and the service was great!. We will definitely be back soon."
CHERNYKA L.,"Belleville, IL",1,7,,5.0,3/25/2016,Great food!! Delivery service can be a little sketchy at times. If you're using the delivery service I suggest calling and making the order on the phone through BJ's. This way you may be able to ensure your food is correct and it will actually get delivered.
Brodie S.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",72,25,10,4.0,3/25/2016,I like this place. Good food. Lots of choices. Can be very loud. Always super busy for dinner.
Alex L.,"Sacramento, CA",4957,1547,3392,2.0,6/8/2011,"I can't speak of this place with a lot of enthusiasm. It's usually loud and perpetually crowded. I've never come here on an evening or weekend and not had to wait for a table or settle for fighting for mediocre service in the bar area. I usually keep my order pretty simple: spinach and artichoke dip (four stars on its own) as an appetizer, followed by one of their unnaturally large baked potatoes with a side salad and a beer. I'm usually too hungry by the time I reach my table to spend time sifting through the tome that is their menu.   Big plus: a great selection of beers unique to the restaurant."
Jay R.,"San Francisco, CA",171,319,46,3.0,12/17/2013,"I'm a huge fan of BJ's restaurant and having one in Folsom is clutch. However, this place lacks consistency. While I've never had any issues with my usual (buffalo chicken pizza), the portions for everything else seem to be hit or miss. I ordered the Moroccan Salmon last week and while the flavor was great, there was barely one small piece of fish on the plate. I understand this item is on the low calorie menu, but I've ordered the same thing at different locations (also seen pictures) and I got at least 2-3 pieces of salmon. The veggie sides were also lacking. Came back here again a few days later and the girlfriend's mango chicken salad was also much smaller than usual. The flavor wasn't as good as normal either. I never had any issues with this place in 2012 so I'm not sure if they made any changes... but please fix it :("
Mario R.,"Cameron Park, CA",13,4,,1.0,11/11/2015,Been here 20 minutes haven't received drink. Screwed up my order now sitting here 45 minutes later with no food. Waitress sucks. Don't come on veterans day way understaffed.
John B.,"Citrus Heights, CA",0,3,1,4.0,8/8/2014,"Always great service!! Food is good, beer is better. Good and loud,just right for my two young boys."
Angela G.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",23,162,107,3.0,2/15/2016,"So I ordered a burger and got the string frys- i was half way done w my frys had just picked one up from my plate and was NOT done..... The waitress says ""let me take that feom you"" and it was gone. Uhhh okay. Byeeeeee im not mad but B took my frys!"
Daisy D.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",0,41,,5.0,9/20/2016,I have been here so many times and never leave disappointed!  The menu is huge and I haven't had a bad item yet.  Service is always great and the bar area is so fun.  The lunch specials are delicious and at a great price.  I will continue to come here!
Taylor H.,"Sacramento, CA",0,11,,3.0,3/14/2016,"I go here often because I love the pizzokies! Although the service here is very uncertain. It seems to be either really good or just terrible, the experience is always relaxed here. The food is average by the pizzokies like I said are the best part!"
Alice T.,"Ione, CA",0,12,6,1.0,9/7/2014,Customer service was horrible. We waited too long for our orders to be taken. We ordered the bjs fav pizza  and shrimp scampi pasta had NO EFFEN FLAVOR tasted like BLAHHHH but the manager I think his name was CHAD? He was cool; came over to make sure our food and drinks were okay.  Other than that everything was blah! I am never returning to this restaurant.
C. Renee P.,"Folsom, CA",0,20,9,1.0,7/8/2016,"So I have tried ordering to go with yelp 24 for BJs and once it was a good experience and the next couple of times it was a disaster. Tonight after a 3 mile hike and a couple of hours of intervals road riding we didn't feel like eating out. I ordered to go from BJs. I hardly ever eat burgers, but had a hankering for one tonight. I placed a simple order. When ordering for pick up the gentleman was very pleasant and seemed proficient. I had the option to ""add cheese"". I asked specifically to add BLEU CHEESE crumbles. When my husband came back with a soggy burger that had some cheap bleu cheese dressing poured all over it, I was EXTREMELY disappointed to say the least. I don't eat burgers often and was really looking forward to it after my extremely active day...therefore I ate the slop. I just don't understand why in the limited amount of times I have taken out from BJs they just can't seem to get the order 100%. VERY disappointing :("
Diana O.,"Sacramento, CA",0,13,18,5.0,2/17/2016,"This was my first visit to the Folsom  California BJ's. Every point of contact was on point , from the phone call in to request a table for 20 with two hours notice, my walk in the door, my waitress Tracee (Best waitress I've ever experienced) and finally the manager making sure I was satisfied with everything as I left. I usually visit arden fair  location because I live in Sacramento however I was in Folsom for a basketball game (we lost) and my extended family came to watch.  The Arden fair BJ's has never been able to accommodate a large table of 20 with short notice. Folsom BJs did it with no hesitation. One of my adult son stated he liked the folsom BJ's service and table area much better.  Top-notch service!  thank you so much for making our family dinner table memories great!"
Tyler J.,"Mt Vernon, WA",21,150,45,2.0,8/14/2014,"Just OK. The service was ok, not great.  A little slow but they tried.  The food was ok, not too far out of the box, average execution.  I had a mediocre experience the first time I came here so I came back.  It was still just ok.  I had a burger, it wasnt cooked right and was just overall... ok.  my companion had pizza.  it was late, and average.  probably wont be back.  felt like a big chain place, over busy and loud."
Marion B.,"Folsom, CA",0,46,,4.0,8/16/2016,Great food and fantastic service! The ice tea glasses were refilled before they were empty. We tried the Ahi salad and the north beach mahi mahi shrimp entree. Both were delicious. Will definitely be back. The only suggestion I would make-  include bread/garlic knots with the dinner. ( Did join the rewards club!!)
Mike M.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",2,27,,3.0,11/30/2015,"My wife and I have come here for years primarily for happy hour.  However, BJ's just took some of the ""happy"" away. No more $5.00 mojitos or lemon drops and the happy hour food menu has been cut back.  I also think (not certain) the happy hour beer price has increased. For someone who visited a BJ's at least 25 times in 2015, I'm thinking 2016 will see significantly fewer visits until management rethinks the happy hour thing"
Rachael C.,"Sacramento, CA",35,47,,4.0,8/23/2014,"Ok so I started this review one to two months ago and am finally getting around to posting.  Better late than never I guess. Great food and service for our party of 6.  It was a somewhat busy Saturday night.  The only negative was that they lost the record of our reservation, but our wait turned out to be only about 10 minutes which wasn't bad. Our server was on top of things the whole time. He came back often to take our orders, refill drinks and check on us.  The food came out fast, really fast - especially our main couses. Like I said above, everything was great!  Would definitely return. Appetizers: 1). calamari, and 2). chicken potstickers ---- both were delicious and cooked perfectly.  Main dish: 1). BBQ chicken pizza"
Bert V.,"Granite Bay, CA",0,9,,4.0,2/25/2016,Wide variety of food and a great place to meet our friends. A Good time to go is late afternoon to avoid big crowds and loud noise. There are TV monitors all around the restaurant so you can always catch a sporting event. The avocado egg rolls are great appetizers  and the flat breads are a meal in its self.
