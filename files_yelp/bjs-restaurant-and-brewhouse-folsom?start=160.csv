Leslie G.,"Loomis, CA",13,46,3,2.0,8/9/2015,"We hadn't gone here in years because it was always just too busy. Decided to stop in because I wanted pizza and remembered their deep dish being really good. Well, now I can say it was ""ok"". Toppings were scant, and I think there might have been cheese on it. Ordered a side Caesar salad and they almost got some salad in the bowl. I was going to offer my husband a bite but I'll admit it, I got greedy. I wanted all four bites to myself. On another note my husband got the new BBQ brisket burger and it was cooked nicely and had good flavor. He enjoyed it. Service was friendly and I think as efficient as it could've been considering how busy they were. Next time I want pizza I will be going down the street to Chicago Fire."
Michael A.,"Loomis, CA",7,56,6,3.0,6/16/2016,"The last visit could be summed up as strikingly average.  It wasn't disappointing but given all the other dining options it didn't provide much reason to return.  My girlfriend's Barbecue Chicken Chopped Salad was average.  The chicken looked like it had been taken out of a plastic bag marked ""diced cubes of barbecued chicken"", warmed up, and mixed with the salad.  The Mahi-Mahi Tacos were average.  The sauce was a little too bland for me; it existed to cement the meat and vegetable filling together rather than add some spice.  The new beer on tap (Magnolia Peach) was okay. The house Hefeweizen was pretty tasty, but not enough to warrant a refill.  I think the correlation between taste and price is where BJ's beer falls short.  The beers are reduced from $6.50 to $5.50 for Happy Hour.  If the house beers were exceptional this would be a great deal, but the house beers are too generic to make the brewery a destination.  Think of BJ's as a Chili's or an Applebee's that brews its own corporate beer.  If you want to drink something unique or complex, BJ's probably won't have it.  If you want a beer that's not Budweiser to go with your meal, BJ's will suffice."
Andrew B.,"Folsom, CA",1,7,1,1.0,5/25/2014,"I had to stop bringing my family here because the service has gotten worse and worse over the past 6 years.  Lost orders, overcharged credit cards, and the general disappearance of servers after we order has become our normal experience.  Every now and then I'll still pop into the bar where I can see the person serving me and he can't disappear. New wait staff every time I visit, I think it must be the management."
Dan B.,"Jaffrey, NH",0,21,,4.0,2/17/2016,Great food and atmosphere. Just wish there were more drinks to choose from such as ciders etc. I would definitely recommend trying this place out for dinner
Paula B.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",44,46,507,5.0,6/4/2014,"Pesto deep dish pizza had me drooling for days! This is my first time ordering pizza from bj's because I always get pasta or an appetizers or a pizookie, which are all delicious. We ended up ordering another pesto deep dish pizza to go! It was that good!"
Yvette R.,"Sacramento, CA",45,34,25,5.0,11/23/2015,Ordered the Chicken bacon ranch pizza very delicious and their beer is always very tasty. They had a new Raspberry Porter which my server was nice to give me a sample which I'm glad for because the raspberry in it tasted horridly sweet/acidic. I'll stick with their original porter.
James M.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",32,223,89,4.0,11/23/2015,Gluten Free options including soup.
Tiffany L.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",65,95,335,4.0,8/13/2012,"Have you heard of BJ's Restaurant & Brew House's new $19.95 Party for Two deal?! Sounds like a gimmick right, ""Share a 3-course meal, including dessert for only $19.95!"" Well let me tell you it's not a gimmick, it's a real bargain and gluten free at that! What better way to enjoy a nice meal with none other than my best girlfriend?! Good conversation, good food, good times. Until one of us gets a boyfriend...I'm pretty sure both of us make the best dates :) LOL  What's in BJ's Party for 2? Choice of: - Small house salad - Caesar salad - Wedge salad Choice of any regular or Gluten Free Pizza: - Gluten Free Medium Portobello Mushroom Pizza  Pizookie: - Gluten Free Chocolate Pizookie with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream  Besides the long wait for our food, everything was delicious. In fact, BJ's gluten free pizza was one of the best Kris and I ever had.  The salads weren't outstanding, typical restaurant starter salads.  I got the House Salad with Italian dressing while Kris had the Wedge Salad.  But the pizza was SO good. Thin crust with melt-y fontina cheese topped with sweet caramelized onions and grilled Portobello mushrooms. Gosh I want some right now! The pizookie was a bit over cooked, but that's not a big deal to me.  It was a great deal for the two of us to fill our tummies with some quality gfree pizza :D"
Andrea A.,"Folsom, CA",111,5,19,2.0,7/31/2016,"We ordered over the phone last night. We got one appetizer, a kids meal and two main dishes. Everything was OK until I opened my meal. I ordered the Chipotle cherry glazed Salmon, my usual there. It comes with asparagus and couscous. The fish was fine but the asparagus was so, so, soooo thin...it was like eating dam near noodles. Not a good quantity or quality and it only had 4 pieces. Then the couscous was so skimpy too, not even funny. There was maybe two table spoons worth of couscous in the box. Not even kidding. There was so little couscous that it looked like someone had already ate part of my meal. The other thing that bothered me was that everything in the box was floating and swimming in juice. Literally more juice than the actual couscous. I have always gotten this meal and I know what it should look like. In my many years, it has NEVER been like this so I know it's not normal. I expect more than a few strands of veggies, a couple table spoons of couscous with a box full of juice. Very disappointed. Not sure if they were just having a bad day or what but the quality was just garbage."
Eddie A.,"Sacramento, CA",145,30,18,4.0,10/11/2014,"Had lunch today at BJ's in Folsom and had a good overall experience.  Our waitress Was very attentive, our order was delivered quickly, and the food was tasty.  I can't say that I've had a bad experience at BJ's."
Dennis J.,"Orangevale, CA",76,10,,5.0,7/17/2014,"I Haven't always been a fan of BJ's---the one in Modesto certainly does NOT deserve or earn my 5 stars! However, this last Saturday I had an experience at BJ's in Folsom that I want and need to share with you! After ordering our meals (3 of us)--I ordered the special BJ's Individual Pizza--I was approached by the manager. I was informed that the pizza, as made, was not acceptable for serving. He apologized and told me that the kitchen was making a new pizza for me. Because of the delay would I like a free salad? The salad was delicious! The pizza---I devoured! When the bill was presented we found out that the manager had given me a 50% discount! THAT IS CUSTOMER SERVICE! I WILL go back more often! A HUGE thank you to the manager!"
Aaron S.,"Rexburg, ID",96,198,126,3.0,6/22/2014,"So I came here with my brothers and a friend. We sat down and the server didn't to seem to be in a very good mood. He was very short with us and would sporadically show up to refill waters.  I don't let bad service effect my review of the food. The food was alright, nothing spectacular  and not bad. I had a steak sandwich, which was fine. My brother had a hamburger and mac n cheese. The hamburger was good but the mac n cheese was very bland.  Don't come here for good service and don't come here for amazing food. Come if you want a place with a lot of TVs and something that is open late."
Christine T.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",239,320,15,2.0,4/19/2015,"BJs food is always amazing. This particular location has okay service, food is always stellar at any BJs you go to, but I do encourage not to do their online ordering because it seems they have some things to iron out before getting things right!"
Pinkesh G.,"Sacramento, CA",13,18,3,1.0,6/21/2015,"I had started with 4 stars and now I don't even want to give them 1! This time around no silverware given, total of three tables filled on a Sunday evening took them 10 minutes (not exaggerating I timed it) to get my card and swipe it after they gave me the check.  Wow! Disappointed!"
Johnna G.,"Roseville, CA",253,65,53,3.0,8/21/2015,"Never my first choice due to the wait to be seated often encountered. However, I do love the Jerimiah Red Beer on tap. I've eaten here four times so far. I wish they would add a salad on the happy hour menu. The breakfast was good. The coffee was strong. Like almost all chain restaurants the food is too salty ."
Chad C.,"Folsom, CA",19,19,,5.0,6/10/2014,"I love this place, great service, good food, big tv's for sports. Staff is always friendly. My wife and I come here once a week at least. Last week we came 3 times. Great gluten free pizza and gluten free beer. Prices are good too and it's a  great place on a hot day."
Bella M.,"Folsom, CA",54,10,50,3.0,1/5/2016,"You can't really expect things to be right at this place. Each time i come, everything is different. Sometimes, the parmesan chicken is overcooked or the portion of the rice in New Orleans Jambalaya is way too small that it makes the dish taste way too rich. I'm curious isn't there supposed to be a head chef who checks the quality of the food before they send out? I'll give it a try again anyway."
A.J. J.,"Sacramento, CA",0,46,6,4.0,10/12/2014,"We frequent this BJ's a lot and the one thing that I enjoy most is their consistency. When I order my faves, I know they'll be good.  Love coming here on a Sunday for football and some excellent Bloody Mary's. They have a few nice brunch selections too."
Henry S.,"Folsom, CA",54,15,24,2.0,2/28/2015,"Generic chain restaurant food over salted. Menu is huge 20 pages of all different kinds of premade dishes. Shrink the menu! Presentation is boring, no flavor. I Recommend going else were in folsom."
Amy B.,"Folsom, CA",188,29,47,5.0,9/5/2014,"Great night! Came here for the first time tonight and Justin V was our sever.. Greeted on a Friday night and sat immediately which is wonderful as they were very busy, turning tables left and right... We ordered calamari for app and then shortly our meals came..
