Addison M.,"Sacramento, CA",1476,395,439,5.0,4/10/2014,This place is awesome I love getting a California burger with a blue moon and orange!
Rachel N.,"Westminster, CA",1,32,22,1.0,2/27/2015,"Took 30 minutes on hold to place a phone order for pick up that ended up being wrong when we got it anyway. Even called 15 minutes in to make sure I wasn't just forgotten and a very rude host told me ""there are people ordering in front of you and in the restaurant you just have to wait"" well don't offer a phone in order when you clearly don't have time to take an order!"
Bri A.,"Shingle Springs, CA",0,6,,3.0,12/6/2016,"I'm Sure it's a great place in general... BUT to start off our visit there... (our server was Aishani) I ordered a raspberry sparkling lemonade which the server confirmed, she brought back two waters. Never got that drink. She never checked on us once we got our food. My husband had half of his fries left so asked her if he could get another side of BBQ sauce .... ten minutes later (after serving other tables) she came over and asked if we would like any dessert. I said ""no but can we get that side of BBQ sauce?"" Five minutes later.... after she'd served two other table multiple times.... still no BBQ sauce. So I stopped another server and asked her if we could get some... she went straight to the kitchen and came right back out with our sauce. Yay. I think her name was Sam.  On the other hand our regular server came right after saying I see Sam got you the sauce.  :|  yes she did. And later Sam even asked us if we wanted a refill on our waters which our regular server did not, not even once. And now we're going to see how long it is until she comes to pick up the check so we can leave. It's already been about five minutes. Oh look Sam took it for us what a great server she is. I hate bashing on servers because I know they get a lot of crap from people. But my husband and I have been very patient and I feel like we are being ignored because we are only two people and  not four like the other tables (bigger tips). Ok so we didn't receive the right change with our check so now we are waiting on that. Also it seems like a few of the tables around us also had some problems. :/"
Jarrett T.,"Folsom, CA",2,10,,5.0,9/17/2015,"BJ's is one of the few restaurants open very late. My wife and I can be practically nocturnal with our schedules, so it's always nice to know that BJ's is open. Their macaroni and cheese is delicious, and a pazookie is the perfect dessert to split. Great staff, short wait if you avoid the busy hours, tasty food, and quick service. 5 stars."
Julie Ann P.,"Folsom, CA",0,20,7,1.0,1/14/2015,I find it odd that a manager who was not available during our visit replied back very quickly to a poor yelp review.   I never wasted my time to call him back.  Too little too late!!!
Sandra T.,"Folsom, CA",10,32,,5.0,9/16/2015,"Service was prompt and friendly. I had a salad and a small pizza. Salad was crisp, cold, and good. The pizza was delicious and arrived hot! I will definitely go again."
Vanessa O.,"Folsom, CA",30,77,22,1.0,3/20/2015,"Service is horrible!!! I ordered a salad with feta and got goat cheese. When I asked the waitress she got very defensive! The appetizers took forever to come out, and we're cold when they came out! The mozzarella stick that came with the boring sampler were cold string cheese hugged by breading! Not good at all."
Rose G.,"Folsom, CA",2297,167,106,5.0,1/6/2015,"BJ's is one of those restaurants that you actually appreciate the fact it is a chain.  From the moment you pull in to the parking lot you know you will have a good experience. The parking lot is never full as they have ample parking, even though it shares it with other businesses. Sometimes there may be a wait for a table on a weekend night, but the front of house is run smoothly and efficiently so you never have to wait long. The longest i have ever waited for a table was 6-10 minutes during dinner rush on a saturday night on a holiday weekend. That in itself says a lot about the restaurant. As you get seated in a COMFORTABLE AND PRIVATE BOOTH OR TABLE, you are immediately greeted by your server and they have a wide selection of craft beers, unique cocktails, and the usual array of soft drinks, etc. I always recommend trying their house made root beer or one of their cocktails,  Their menu's signature dishes are always superb, and range from classic burgers to GLUTEN FREE pizza, to pasta dishes and health conscious dishes. I ALWAYS bring large groups here as not only do they have ample space for large parties, but they have such a diverse menu, there is literally something for everyone. They also have SEASONAL MENU ADDITIONS which are just a delicious as their regular items. Some personal favorite dishes are the WATERMELON and FETA SALAD, the SPINACH AND ARTICHOKE DIP, the CAJUN PASTA, the ENLIGHTENED SCALLOPS, and BBQ BISON BURGER. Oh, and of course you have to cap off your evening with a PIZOOKIE, I am a fan of their GLUTEN FREE CHOCOLATE CHIP.  Service is always excellent, even on busy nights, and being a regular I believe i have been served by all of their waitstaff. They always have a smile on their face, they are FAST AND PROMPT, and in the past year of going maybe once every couple weeks I have only had one small error to an order. Food is usually out quickly, and you never feel stranded after your food is served. Their hours are amazing, one of the only open past 10pm establishments in the Folsom area. Overall, amazing."
Ashley A.,"Folsom, CA",163,46,1,4.0,9/7/2015,This place is very good. Not to loud plus has TVs. The people that work here are very nice. Food doesn't ever take to long.
Jamie A.,"Escondido, CA",507,530,1309,2.0,1/6/2012,"Let's see other than having great beers, there isn't much I liked about this location.  Though I will say that our hostess/seater was awesome.  She had gold glitter on her nails, talked a million-miles a minute and rambled about how her old job was so boring. Funny!   Then our server came around and other than trying to get us to have as many refills of beer as possible, was pretty inefficient.  First of all she never got us refills of soda or iced tea until we flagged her down. If I want to have dry-mouth eating, I will go to a Thai or Vietnamese restaurant with one server.  BJ's has 30 servers and everyone is inexplicably in the back doing God knows what.  She also gave me wedge fries instead of skinny; and didn't tell us that the veggie pizza is on wheat crust now.  The pizza was also slightly burned.  Wheat crust is really unappealing.  I like veggies, but that doesn't mean I am a whole grain hippie who enjoys eating a deep dish pizza that tastes like a slice of dry Ezekiel bread.     We didn't even get a pizzooki!  We were over  BJS like we're all over Kim Kardashian on the ""news."""
Patsy M.,"Folsom, CA",365,36,2,3.0,7/3/2016,"Good food, always good service. It gets busy and a little loud but that's because its a good, steady place to go!"
Phyllis C.,"Rosemont, CA",2,1,,1.0,12/30/2013,"We wer at this loc Sun 12/29 with a party of 17 Service was Terrible! Food came out wit Brown Baked Potatoes, incorrect Steaks, etc We will never go back! To top that off, we called back to talk to Manager, and the Manager Eric hung up on me.  I'm calling the Corporate office and requesting my money back!"
Shannon T.,"Fair Oaks, CA",41,16,1,1.0,7/3/2015,"First we waited for the server to come over, then waited 15 minutes to order, then waited 30 minutes for the appetizer and then another 30 minutes for our food with little attention from our server. One burger came with cold fries, the other didn't have any, nor did it have onion strings that the menu said it had. To top it off, we never received the onion strings after we told the server they were missing. The server did apologize at the end and said ""sorry, the kitchen is really understaffed tonight"". I think it's only common sense as a corporate restaurant with high customer expectations that they relay this information at the beginning when we first sat down. Pretty awful dinner and horrendous customer service!"

Logan T.,"Shingle Springs, CA",169,5,,4.0,6/13/2016,"I've been going to this location for years now, always had a good experience. Food is consistent, prices are reasonable, and their beer selection is great. Staff is generally friendly and attentive. Keep it up!"
Anastasia B.,"Orangevale, CA",587,296,7,3.0,1/7/2014,"The Folsom location is not the best place we've been to... My hubby and I met for the very first time at the Roseville BJ's so this chain holds quite a bit of sentiment with us. I came here on a work lunch last week. The poor server girl...she was either horribly untrained or just didn't grasp what it meant to be a waitress. We left the place commenting on the poor service skills we received. Lunch being comped on the company meant we could have left a substantial tip, but it was the good ol' regular 15%. Anyways, the food was good. I ordered the parmesan crusted chicken sandwich on the lunch menu. Eh it was ok I usually stick with what I know and this was outta the box for me. I didn't like leaving the box this time around. Maybe next time...in Roseville..."
Karman S.,"Folsom, CA",0,13,,5.0,4/24/2014,"I LOVE BJs. Their menu is huge. I've been there so many times but I've never disliked my food.  The spinach and artichoke dip appetizer is amazing. I've tried several different pastas but my favorite is the chicken fettucine alfredo. Their pizzas taste like heaven. The burgers are good. Chicken Cesar salad makes me melt. This place is just great overall. I have a different waiter or waitress every time I go in and I've only ever disliked one. She was terrible, very rude, but I haven't seen her since."
Mark S.,"Folsom, CA",0,6,,2.0,2/10/2014,"Well, I have eaten here many times, and its always good food and atmosphere, but the Curbside ToGo service is a FAIL. For starters, all of the dedicated curbside pickup parking spots are filled with parked cars for dine in customers, forcing me to either drive in circles or park in a red zone blocking in other cars.  I was told 20 to 30 minutes and they would bring the food to my car. It's been 45 minutes and still nothing. I've been sitting out here in the parking lot for over 20 minutes...  Never again.... Too bad though, because overall I love BJ's food and beer, so I was hoping curbside would work out. In the end, I had to go inside to get my food."
J W.,"Folsom, CA",1,48,4,5.0,11/1/2015,Great place all ways busy but I don't mind because I love the food good place for kids.
David G.,"Seattle, WA",97,35,3,3.0,8/11/2014,"Normally I really enjoy the variety and quality of foods from BJs in Folsom and have sampled many of their dishes from salads to pizza to appetizers to various dinners.  So it was disappointing to have ordered a take out this weekend of a new dish for me of their Tuscan Chicken Limone.  The write-up stated that it included artichoke hearts, sun-dried tomatoes served over our delicate angel hair pasta with fresh steamed baby spinach and with garlic bread.  When I opened up the takeout package there was no garlic bread and the dish had a tiny string of spinach.  Made me wonder what else it had missing.  Disappointing to force their customers to check their takeout order before leaving the restaurant.  Come on, I think you are a classy place than this.  Right?"
