Dan K.,"Folsom, CA",0,11,,3.0,2/13/2015,"Great beer! Decent food, crappy service.... this is the go to place we love to hate. But we always come back."
Vic M.,"Chico, CA",0,359,608,3.0,11/4/2011,Excellent and friendly service.  Our waitress was awesome. Appetizers were small. Food was ok to mediocre. Place was noisy.
Kaitlyn M.,"Shingle Springs, CA",1,61,,4.0,6/25/2013,"BJ's used to be one of my favorite restaurants. I still really like the food and drinks but the last 2 times I came here I received horrible service. My husband and I ate here for a late night meal after coming home from shopping. It was a little after 8pm. We ordered the fried artichokes as an appetizer and my husband ordered a beer and I ordered a cocktail. My husband got his beer but I never received my drink. I called our waiter over and he apologized and said he would go get it for me. After five minutes he didn't return. Someone from the kitchen brought out our entrees but not our appetizer. My husband mentioned this to her and she went and retrieved our fried artichokes. When our waiter finally returned he apologized for still not having my drink and I told him to just forget about it. The food was great but the service was horrible. The last time I went to BJ's was with my mom for lunch. We both ordered a salad and endless soup, the tomato basil bisque. BJ'S has really good soups. The waitress brought out only one soup and told us we could share since they were making a fresh batch. That was a little awkward. My mom let me eat the soup and it took almost 30min for them to bring another bowl out. I still give BJ's 4 stars because their food is really good. I just hope that next time I come here I will get better service."
Alex G.,"Pacific Grove, CA",26,41,10,5.0,10/3/2014,"First off I would like to say, this place has exceptional food for such an affordable price. OF COURSE IT WILL BE BUSY. I noticed multiple review rating this place low because they had to wait. Are you kidding me??? Maybe because I used to serve, I am more understanding? I'm not sure.... Well, on to my review... I live near this BJ's so I am here somewhat often. I have never had a rude server and food is always served on time. The happy hour is what we go for though. Great deals! Apps and drink specials all around $4-6 dollars which is a steal for a restaurant. The best part of the happy hour is not the price though, it is the large ""small happy hour"" portions. I was honestly surprised how large the portions were! Thank you guys and I will definitely be back."
Travis B.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",52,15,,4.0,5/31/2015,They the oldest beer in town! The menu is almost too big. Too much great food to chose from. I would have given them 5 stars but it's just a bit too noisy
Cindy K.,"Folsom, CA",208,1066,517,4.0,8/1/2011,"Yum, I love love love BJ's!  Get here before 7pm or else you'll have to wait a while before you get a table. I wish this place gave out some bread or some kind of munchies so we can nibble on something while we wait for our food. I like to get their signature root beer. It's the best root beer I've ever had and it's free refills! Whoo~  Their pizza is really amazing. Actually I'm more impressed with the crust part. It's so tasty. The bf and I think it must be the kind of oil they use. My other favorite dish is the parmesan crusted chicken. The chicken is tender and the sauce is very savory."
Jill G.,"Shingle Springs, CA",120,26,11,5.0,2/14/2015,"BJ's is definitely my favorite restaurant. The oreo pizookie is so freaking good. You have to try it, if you haven't had it. Also, the chocolate chip cookie one is soooo yummy"
Denise K.,"Cameron Park, CA",34,3,,4.0,8/5/2013,"We have been to this BJ's many times and usually the service is very good.  Last night the wait service, provided by Courtney,  was exceptional!  Courtney is extremely polite and courteous.  She made sure that we had everything we needed to enjoy our dinner. I hope next time we go to BJ's we will be seated in her section."
Troy C.,"Orangevale, CA",37,12,4,2.0,5/1/2013,"The food is good, we appreciate the low calorie options a lot.  However, the restaurant is never clean.  The menus, the condiment containers like mustard and ketchup, the entry floor.  Wait staff is hit or miss.  Disappointing the last couple trips."
Cookie M.,"Folsom, CA",1,9,,5.0,3/27/2016,"BJs takes reservations on the holiday.  Eight of us had the nicest Easter! Servers were excellent! Food was excellent, thank you, BJs!"
Madeline O.,"Chicago, IL",1,20,3,1.0,1/20/2013,"If I could give no stars I would.  The best adjective to describe my experience was disconcerting.  Let me describe what happened. We arrived on a Sunday evening (1/20/13 around 8pm) and were promptly seated since the restaurant was half empty (the hostess was great).  Our waiter (and another staff member) were preoccupied with a group of young girls and were unable to provide any service unless prompted.  Our party observed the male waiters flirt with these girls multiple times for long periods while we received little to no service.  We patiently waited for an excess of thirty minutes before we flagged down someone to take our order.  In this half empty restaurant we needed to ask for utensils, refills, order food, and to receive our order.  To add insult to injury the waiter forgot portions of our order.  Frustrated, I approached the staff member and asked  to be helped while he was still flirting with the girls. Needless to say this made the young girls angry. Those girls started to talk about (and make fun of ) our party WITH the waiters. Aware that the girls were young teenagers we disregarded the taunts and attempted to continue our dinning experience. We observed both waiters continually attending to the young girls and joining in on their conversation about OUR party.  This was BY FAR the worst dinning experience of my life. My family and I will NEVER eat at another BJ's and we encourage all other families to think twice before deciding to attend this establishment."
Ray W.,"Roseville, CA",1175,47,3,1.0,12/31/2012,"What a bad experience!  First, we call and made a reservation for 5:30, when we arrived on time, we were told that it would be 20 minutes before we would be seated. I guess they do not understand how reservations work. The sad part was when we walked by the window there was at least 6 empty tables. 35 minutes later we were seated.  Once seated we ordered. Two out of the three items we ordered were barely warm.   I will not be going back anytime soon if ever."
Mark N.,"Folsom, CA",10,44,,1.0,3/4/2014,The waitress took our order and disappeared. Another server brought our food and our waitress did bring us the two sides of sauces. That was all we heard of her for the next 20 minutes. She was only a few feet away servicing other tables but completely ignoring us. All I was trying to do the last 10 minutes was get her attention because I was out of water. She finally came over and took our order for desert which took forever to come. Another server brought it. Never saw the waitress again. The food was tolerable at best (I had the ribs and my friend had a steak) but the desert was great. If we had needed anything after the food was brought out we were out of luck because there was no way that waitress was coming anywhere near our table. Bad service.
Kevin M.,"Folsom, CA",28,20,36,5.0,10/10/2014,I'm a fan....always reliable happy hour apps and great beer!  Piranha all day long.
Timothy B.,"Somerset, CA",48,12,1,4.0,7/25/2013,Been here several times and always leave satisfied. A unique setting that combines a great sports bar with a nice family restaurant. Nice beer selection and the food is tasty. Great appetizers too at a moderate price. Service is excellent even during peak hours. The Jambalaya is excellent and has a nice kick to it. The southern fried chicken would make your mama proud. Kids are welcomed and they are very accommodating if you have special dietary needs. Great for lunch or dinner.
Shayda G.,"Las Vegas, NV",242,225,52,4.0,1/1/2013,"The food is great, the drinks are great and the dessert was to die for, but the service was odd.  The gal that was our server was young, did not seem to pay much attention to detail and kinda could care less for our table. I ordered a diet coke and the place ran out of diet coke....who does that!!!  Also, we had to order the dessert before we were even done with our meal because something was wrong with the oven in the back and it was taking extra long for them to cook.  I enjoyed the fish and rice plate I ordered, I never have a problem with the food, just the service!   Side note: They have gluten free pizza!  AND IT IS SOOOOOOO GOOD!"
Ashley C.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",1,11,4,4.0,3/20/2015,I go here every few months and enjoy it every time.  Their new Tavern-cut pizza is GOOD but not very filling.  The Commitment beer is also very good.  It is a new double IPA that they just released.  The place is also busy so go earlier or make reservations.
Marie P.,"San Francisco, CA",53,714,32,4.0,1/30/2011,What the heck am I doing in Folsom? Well stopped by on the way back from a snowboarding weekend and the folks and I decided we wanted to try a different BJ's other than the one near us. I have to say this one was relatively calm and spacious. Great screens at the bar for watching the Pro Bowl! (Although we didn't sit over there) Staff is friendly. We ordered a bunch of appetizers and they came pretty quickly. Love the artichoke dip!  Prices are pretty pricey so come here pretty hungry!
Erin G.,"Shingle Springs, CA",0,10,3,5.0,3/1/2016,"The food isn't what keeps me coming back, it's the service. Bartenders Mark & Sam, servers Lindsey & Mason are my favorites. Always great service with an intelligent and funny conversation to go with my avocado egg rolls. Management, give these kids a raise, they've earned it!"
Jason S.,"Sacramento, CA",0,31,6,1.0,7/1/2014,"Took my girl out there for her birthday yesterday. We got seated and nobody ever came up to us after over 30 minutes just sitting there we got upset and left. sat there for over 30 minutes, no waiter came up at all even to offer drinks.  Ruined the whole night because of the shitty service. these days when you go to a restaurant be prepared not to eat because you never know if they will serve you or you will just have to walk out.  Pretty upset that they ruined a birthday for my girl...... If its a important day, stay away from BJ's they will screw it up for you ;) Also went here a lot times in the past and we were never satisfied with the food quality and service was the worst. Lol their job is simple: serve the customer. They cant even do that."
