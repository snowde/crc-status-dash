Roger W.,"Sacramento, CA",1,12,,1.0,4/9/2015,If you want to be served by 20 year olds and treated like a 20 year old .... Fuckin terrible place. Any management????
N N.,"Orangevale, CA",3,38,2,1.0,5/24/2014,"Really bad service.  A couple that came in after us were seated before we were.  The waitress took our drink order, brought our drinks and didn't come back for 20 minutes to ask if we were ready to order.  Another person came by and asked if we wanted another drink.  They returned with my husbands drink and also brought him a glass of water.  I was never asked nor offered water.  When our order arrived I asked for a side of blue cheese dressing.  I was told ""I will get that right away"", it never arrived.  When the waitress Diane brought our bill I asked for a box, which also never arrived.  This place has really really gone downhill!!"
John W S.,"San Jose, CA",2,25,3,4.0,12/6/2014,Deep dish pizza was good.  Grand Cru beer was excellent.  So is the Jeremiah Red.  Service is good.
Nikka M.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",0,16,3,1.0,6/3/2014,"If I could give this place no stars, I would. But since I can't, I'll have to settle for one star and here's why: My overall experience was terrible. Service is so bad here. Went there on my birthday. My mom, my four-year-old nephew and I had to wait during every process of our visit. Just to order drinks, 20 mins. Ordering food, over 20 minutes. Getting refills, your check and boxes...don't even know how long it took. Our waitress was terrible. She basically wasn't even our waitress because I had ask other people to get things for us because she never checked on us. As for my order, the food was good except she gave me the wrong order. I would've sent it back but by that time, I was starving and wasn't in the mood anymore. Also, my nephew's food was given at the exact same time as my mom and I's food. First rule of dining with a kid, their food should always be served first! When we got our food, our waitress didn't come to ask us how everything was at all. She came at the end. No refills...NOTHING! My mom and I had every intention of ordering dessert when we came in, but we were just so fed up with the experience that we had to leave. People who gotten there before us had their food and orders before us. It was so frustrating to deal with, especially on my birthday. I used to really love this place because of the service. The manager was no help either. I can't tell you how many times I made eye contact with him and he still didn't come over to help. I will never come back here.  Get your act together guys!"
Eric M.,"Sacramento, CA",9,87,13,3.0,9/9/2013,"This place lacks consistency. While the service was fine, the food wasn't great. One person ordered the Moroccan Salmon and the filet was dryer than your mouth after smoking meth. They had it sent back and chose the bison burger instead. I ordered the bison burger as well. Patty was cold. And there was a ton of cumin seasoning all over my plate. What I realized shortly after was that they probably forgot to season the coleslaw so they just hit it with some cumin after the fact. Tasted like crap. I ordered a side of fries as well. They came out about one minute before I finished my burger The person who returned the salmon received their bison burger. The patty looked phenomenal compared to mine, but they had no seasoning at all on the coleslaw.  What I've realized is that BJ's is awesome for appetizers and good brews. I'll always skip the entrees for now on. 1 star goes to the Watermelon Feta salad. Delicious 2 stars go to Trappistes Rochefort 10. Again, delicious"
RibChamp Z.,"Orcas Island, WA",4,226,8,4.0,3/10/2013,"Awsome food - all the time, everything i ever had here has been close or the best of.  The Fish and chips was the best in the Bay Area and in EDH area.  The gluten Free Crust Pizza is stull the best in EDH Area.  The Pizoki desert was awesome. the beers choices are the best.  The service is great!  hey, and they are well trained - amazing.  So for 90% of my Family (and for the 11,250 people in EDH alone), not to mention the 18,750 GF in Folsom - THANKS --RibChamp"
Eric B.,"Sacramento, CA",106,256,20,3.0,8/25/2012,"BJ's is one of those places you can count on to deliver a decent meal and some pretty good beer. Not awesome, but serviceable. There are a couple of things on the menu that are really good, however. The avocado egg rolls are are a guilty pleasure, and basil/Italian sausage flatbread pizzas are tasty and not so doughy.  It's also one of the few places you can get a Kölsch-style beer (mer muss och jünne künne!). It's not Päffgen of Heller's, but good luck finding that outside of Nordrhein-Westfalen!"
Priscilla O.,"Folsom, CA",0,2,,5.0,2/15/2015,It was an amazing experience. My waiter was always asking if I needed anything and was making sure everything was to my expectations!
Dawn M.,"Waldorf, MD",0,27,,4.0,1/29/2013,"We went a bit late for lunch and a bit early for dinner so the restaurant was fairly quiet.  Yet the staff still was friendly and efficient, even though it was the end of the shift.  We had two kinds of their house beers which we enjoyed.  All the meals were very good.  There were plenty of big screens for folks who want to watch the game, without the big screens taking over the place.   If we are in the area again I'd love to go back for another meal."
Jose Manuel C.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",5,36,12,4.0,11/16/2014,"The wait is sometimes a hassle, but when one has the time on hands it is worth the alcohol variety! This is where me and many of my friends have celebrated birthdays (including my 21!!!!). The food is good quality for not too bad of a price.  I would go more often if the wait period was shorter"
Doug J.,"Sacramento, CA",61,40,27,3.0,11/11/2014,"I give a low star rating, not for the service,  my server Jennifer was awesome!  The like always is good,  fresh,  and delicious.  But for vets on this day,  they are I'll prepared. If your going to limit a vet to 9.95, then prepare a special 1 sided menu with the specials, not a 12 page menu packed with everything.  My server did offer me options, but I still choose the turkey club for 10.95. And no they couldn't discount the vet value and let me pay the difference."
Nicole B.,"Citrus Heights, CA",133,191,84,4.0,5/8/2013,"I came in here on a Thursday night for dinner. There were only two of us and we were immediately seated. The waitress greeted us right away and took our drink orders. I got a skinny margarita and it was definitely on the stronger side. This made it a little difficult to drink, but who is going to complain about a heavy hand when you're paying those prices?! One issue, not for me but for the restaurant, was that she didn't card either of us. I am definitely over 21, but it is better to be safe than sorry. I ordered the tilapia off of the healthier options part of the menu. When it came out it was a good size on a bed of rice with a side salad. I didn't eat the salad because it was the rabbit food kind and I prefer the crunchy iceberg lettuce. It wasn't the best fish I've had, but it wasn't bad either. The waitress was polite and efficient. She checked on us a few times and always asked if we needed anything else. All in all, I had a good experience here and would probably return in the future."
KeiKei B.,"Sacramento, CA",54,368,266,3.0,8/12/2014,"Was good and had a great salad.  Drinks were on point and I loved the fact that they would customize a drink for you.  My table mates were regulars and were treated as such.  I like my waitress and she made sure to keep the drinks coming.  Try the veggies as they are blanched to perfection.  The seating is a little off as some tables look down into others.  Wall art is wonderful and different.  They stand by their product and when my food was a little late, it was comped.  Great practice for any restaurant.  I will definitely take everyone I know back to BJs!"
Sarah T.,"Sacramento, CA",98,63,13,3.0,7/5/2015,My family and I headed here for dinner last night and were overall pleased with our experience. The service was fast and courteous. They even gave us free milk for my son. The food was just acceptable. We ordered two appetizers: the fried calamari and the avocado rolls. The avocado rolls were pretty good but the fried calamari was not good. The calamari lacked flavor and seasoning and the 'aioli' sauce tasted like ranch dressing. We split the fish taco entree with grilled Mahi mahi. Again it was just acceptable. The fish seemed overcooked.
Trevor S.,"Sacramento, CA",125,140,8,3.0,3/24/2013,"We're not major BJ's fans, but we enjoy the occasional visit. Their beers aren't all that great. If I get a homebrew, it's usually the Jeremiah Red. Otherwise I go to the menu and order something else. We love the Great White pizza and the Pizzookie (half chocolate chip, half oreo). The prices aren't terrible for what it is. Without alcohol or an appetizer, my wife and I could likely get out for $45ish with tip."
Jane Y.,"West Sacramento, CA",120,107,75,2.0,4/7/2012,"I don't normally write reviews on chain restaurants but here I am.  My friends and I stopped by here to get a bite after driving back from Tahoe and thankfully it wasn't busy and got seated right away. Our server (Iain) took our drink order and came back 10 minutes later with them and took the food order. That's pretty much the only time we saw him. The food runner came out with our food and did a drop and ran. No ""can I get you anything else."" Our water glasses were empty and didn't get refilled until we flagged down the server and asked for a refill. Never once asked us how the food tasted and if we needed anything else. I left a note for him to improve his service along with half the amount of tip he would have gotten."
Joe N.,"Folsom, CA",440,151,36,1.0,3/23/2012,"this place has gone down in service and in food quality. I must bother my fellow yelpists with a long story. as a self proclaimed foodie, friends like to accompany my wife and I to eat so they can try new things. a friend who just moved from Arizona and after a long day of shooting and driving around folsom a group of 5 of us built up an appetite, we decided to go to BJ's to watch the bulls game and allow my Arizonan friend try the famous pizzookie. boy was that a mistake. we ordered 3 burgers,  1 fish and chips, 1 nachos for food. Drinks ordered: 1 soda, 3 waters and friend ordered a Jeremiah Red. from the time we sat down to the time we got our drinks? 20 mins. from the time we got our drinks to out server to get our orders?+20mins at this point we wanted drinks refilled. this is the time the Red came out. the Hostess not our server finally bring out the food. as soon as she set down the food she knocks over a full cup of water. but instead of truly caring she looks almost annoyed at us, looks at my friend asks him if hes ok. he replies with a yeah, but guess what? the water was totally going the other direction on the table and the person opposite him totally gets drenched, looking like she has loss control of her bladder. while she spills this water she drops part of my wifes fries. all thats left was 5 1/2 fries. but instead of saying hey i'll bring you a new side of fries she just drops the rest of the food off and walks away.  Dang it just writing this makes my blood boil how crappy the service is. eff the story here was everything that was wrong: - service took forever we were there for lunch and it took over 2 hours. -hostess brings out our food spills multiple things gives us a half hearted apology and walks away not even cleaning it. -server is off doing her own thing. comes by maybe 4 times during the duration of our stay.  -all of the burgers were asked for for medium/rare. one burger came out half burnt/half pink. one burger was missing the lettuce tomatoes and onions -we had to wait extra long for our food with no update from our server or refills . -the nachos we had were pretty much chips with cheese, none of the other toppings were on there in any quantity to be considered acceptable. -we ask for the manager it takes another 10 mins, we then complain to the manager, manager makes crap excuses  says he will take care of one of the burgers and then tries to UPSELL us a pizzookie. -we finish food in 15 mins we try to get our check, cant get a hold of our server. dirty plates on our table for another 15 mins. only after i started to take pictures of our food does the manager come by and clear our table. - trying to get the check that the manager had to hand us. he asks us if we wanted a pizzookie my arizonan friend never trying one we agreed. in the end of this disgusting ordeal. We ended up still paying 40 dollars for the meal. manager only comping the burgers and the pizzookie.  i've told everyone i could about this issue and it seems like i am not the only one who had a crap experience like this.  I should have filed a better business bureau complaint. sorry for venting but this has to be said. dont go here. Ever"
Devin B.,"Sacramento, CA",4,3,2,5.0,8/30/2015,Always amazing food Pizookie. Came here on Sunday afternoon but it really busy. The service was on spot and the food was great as always. Will be back again.
Tiffany C.,"North Highlands, CA",10,23,3,3.0,8/14/2014,Slow service. Fried artichoke was great. We came around 1145 on a Thursday afternoon and the place was pretty packed.  The chicken limon with artichoke on angel hair pasta was amazing!
Jillian O.,"Camino, CA",3,4,,2.0,1/21/2015,"My last two visits to this particular BJ's were less than satisfactory. Last night in particular was probably the worst. We had a party of 10 and they told us there would be a short wait due to a party just finishing up and just paid. Apparently in their eyes ""finishing up"" means 30minutes +. We finally got tired of waiting since it was getting later than we wanted and they could only seat our party in two booths next to each other. Not ideal when the guests of honor couldn't even sit with one another. Finally after getting our drinks (wrong I add, and with getting a new server right after ordering drinks) we ordered our food and they were able to move our group to a table where everyone was able to sit together. One appetizer finally came, but my salad I had ordered to come out before my entree never showed up. Once the food arrived luckily MOST everything was correct. I had to ask for my salad which did come out correct. Another person's order was the complete wrong item, and the server said ""I'm sorry, I heard you talking about another item so I thought you just wanted that"".  I feel part of the issue is the switching of servers, and other servers bringing out food to tables they have no idea what they ordered. This is not the first time the orders have been mixed up and I've only experienced it at BJ's. Also, if you no longer make the boneless wings, take them off the menu! Disappointing since they do have great food, but I much prefer Yard House in Roseville. Way better experience and customer service."
