Chris O.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",85,330,71,2.0,3/20/2012,"Y'know, I was really excited to eat here with some family from KY. After tasting the different dishes at our table, I was not impressed.  I ordered a jalepeno burger with steak fries which was HUGH but the flavor was very boring. My wife ordered hot wings which were pretty much run of the mill with Franks hot sauce.  My daughters were happy with their Mac n cheese and chicken tenders which is why I gave them a second star.  At the end fo the day... I'd prefer one of the ""other"" chains accross the street.  Service, was ok... our server forgot about my daughters apple sauce and we all know kids don't forget the apple sauce. Yo man O!"
Diana S.,"Folsom, CA",183,72,55,4.0,2/7/2014,"Santa Fe salad w/o meat is yummy, half wedge salad & baked potato with fixins minus meat plus jeremia red pint is so good it makes one feel guilty : o"
Elli J.,"Sacramento, CA",85,103,1,2.0,1/20/2012,"Peh! You will notice that I DO actually write good reviews of chain restaurants, when they are deserving. BJ's didn't exactly try to kill me, but that's only because I don't think they knew that I'm allergic to shrimp. So when my salad came, I noticed (thankfully before I took a bite) that there was a fat hunk of shrimp laying right there in the middle of the thing.  I asked politely and they took it away and replaced it with another one...after about 15 minutes. Now, loose crustaceans on their own do not a two star rating make.  I'm just not that kind of girl.  So let me just add that my salad came after everyone else had already been served their complicated hot food. My *$9* salad (which was hardly a snack) (and almost killed me) came *several minutes* after everyone else's entrees. No-flipping-bueno."
Elvie S.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",2,6,1,2.0,2/2/2014,"I usually like BJ's but today was a really disappointing experience. We waited for almost an hour for our food (I am not exagerating) so by the time we got them, it was already cold. Today is Sunday, my kids are always excited to have brunch, my son's omelet looks so dry, he almost did not eat it. Our server did not give us water nor did she refill my hot water for my tea. I hate to complain but I had to let them know so they can do something about it, the manager was listening while I was complaining to the front desk, the manager did not even step in and maybe apologize for the poor service? I guess I won't be spending any money at BJ's at all."
Easton M.,"San Francisco, CA",21,4,,4.0,8/2/2014,"A little rough experience getting seated, but our hostess, Lianne G was great and really friendly!! Definitely ask for her if you get the chance!"
Chad M.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",17,3,,5.0,1/10/2014,"Went to BJ's in Folsom with my wife for dinner.   We were seated right away and our waitress came withen a minute to give menus and take our drink order.  She came back quickly and asked if we were ready to order,  told her no not yet.   She had to come back three times before we were ready to order.  When we finally figured out what we wanted she offered suggestions and gave us her opinion on a few dishes.   Our food came up quite quickly was nice and warm and tasted great.   Our waitress continually checked back on us making sure everything was going well. When I asked about desert she offered her opinion on a few I was considering. Over all our meal was very good, and our server was excellent.   We will be going back again soon.   Our waitress was Marissa, she made the visit enjoyable,  hope to see her again the next time!"

Samantha W.,"Lincoln, CA",1,15,2,2.0,10/4/2015,"Not happy with this place, we went to the Roseville location for my Dad's birthday and it was horrible so tried this one for my Mom's birthday and they didn't even say anything to her. My food was extremely dry and tough to cut. The food took FOREVER to get to us. Also asked numerous times for a booster and never got one. Ridiculous."
Haley A.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",4,7,4,4.0,1/1/2014,"I love this restaurant, it has a wide variety to choose from and I am definitely a regular here. I don't love any of the appetizers, they're pricy for small portions and sub-par quality. But the service is always great and I love their food. I especially love their Cesar salad, always great! Wonderful place for many occasions."
Mike L.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",44,20,,4.0,2/26/2014,"Went here earlier tonight as part of a dinner & movie date night. I ordered pizza and my date ordered pasta; both were good, as the food at BJs usually is. Service was friendly, albeit a little slow, which was odd considering the restaurant was only 1/4 full (we came for a late dinner around 9pm). Overall, it was a good experience and I will be back in the future."
Laura H.,"Placerville, CA",12,51,8,4.0,12/31/2011,"I know it's a chain restaurant and nothing particularly unique, but BJ's in Folsom has consistently good food and service, despite the ever-revised menu that is different EVERY time we come (which is pretty often.) Good food, good service, very kid-friendly. Sometimes that's exactly all you need. OH and good beer!!!"
Mike R.,"Gaston, OR",0,11,6,2.0,8/7/2015,Slow service. Took almost an hour to get our food. They were fast in clearing the table though.  One person in our group ordered a lemonade and never got it.
Andrea R.,"Folsom, CA",168,11,101,1.0,8/23/2011,"This review is just for the Folsom location. I've been to other ones and they were always good. But this place...ughhhh. Service here was always terrible. But there was one, particularly bad, night I had dinner here with my boyfriend. We received, possibly, the worst service EVER.  So we ordered the Santa Fe spring rolls and shared the BBQ chicken pizza. He had a coke which he had a hard time getting refilled. The first time he asked her she took his cup and never came back. Then he asked her where his coke went and she had forgotten it in the kitchen. She came back after 10 minutes. This happened probably two more times with my water refill and his coke. Then she got our order wrong. Gave us the Avocado egg rolls instead of the spring rolls. Then we had no plates or silverware and it took forever to get her attention. She was too busy chitchatting with a group of guys at the bar and then moved to the kitchen entrance to chitchat with her coworker. Seriously? When we finally got the check, my boyfriend and I were surprised to see that our bill was $60. All we ordered were the pizza, appetizer and soda. Then we realized it was because she charged us for several items we didn't even order! What the hell was wrong with her? In the end, she apologized to us profusely and fixed the bill so we left her SOME kind of tip. We were much too nice. I've also been here for Happy Hour. HORRIBLE prices for Happy Hour drinks and consistently horrible service. At least they're consistent?"
AJ V.,"Carmichael, CA",1,13,,3.0,7/24/2013,"Gonna start with a pleasant surprise - the seared ahi is AWESOME. Who woulda thunk it? BJ's, you get an entire star just for that. As for brew, IPA fans should down a couple Hopstorms. Tastes like it sounds, in a very good way! Lager fans will enjoy the Oasis Amber (featured as of this writing). It's mellow and slightly skewed toward the malty side of the spectrum. Good show with the brews, BJ's! You earn another star. Of course, that leaves only one star for the rest of the dining experience. Uh, oh... Friday, 5:15 on a scorching hot afternoon: My wife and I enter BJ's Folsom location with healthy appetites and driving thirsts. We start with appetizers and a couple beers. Our server brings the beer, but mistakenly serves us each the wrong one. To be fair, the Oasis and Hopstorm have similar color when served. The two taste so different that I notice the error immediately and we switch our pints. No harm done. The restaurant isn't very busy yet, so we see most of the wait staff, including our server, congregating together chatting amongst themselves at one station near the rear of the dining area, opposite the bar. Remember the appetizers I mentioned earlier? Our server didn't. 45 minutes go by until she returns to the table to tell us the appetizers should be up soon, and by the way, are we ready to order our entrees? We place our dinner orders. A few minutes later, our appetizers arrive... cold. Our server, who was standing nearby, must have overheard us talking about it. She came back and said, ""Oh, are they cold?"" (Anyone think she doesn't already know they're cold? Neither do I.) Anyway, she does the right thing by getting us new appetizers and not charging for one of them. Soon after, warm appetizers arrive. Hooray! But wait, our entrees are ready, too. What a predicament. Eat the hot entrees and let the now-warm appetizers get cold again, or eat the appetizers and let the entrees go cold? Heck, I think I need another Hopstorm. Where did our server go? Looking around, I see that the staff is no longer aimlessly loitering about and that the Manager is in the house. Coincidence? I managed to order another beer, and we proceed to devour the surprisingly good food we are finally served, followed up with Chocolate Pazookie for desert (which my wife ordered, since I refuse to say the word ""Pazookie"" out loud) So, after all was said and done, it ending up being a nice -  wait a minute... what's this? We were overcharged for beer. Dang.  A note to the BJ's Manager: The food is spot on, but table service sucks. Dude, you have a tough job ahead."
Adrian A.,"Orangevale, CA",43,32,1,4.0,1/16/2014,"I have found that the service here is always great in the bar. Came here to watch the 49er playoff game and our server was excellent. Took our order when we were ready and all the food tasted phenomenal! Happy hour apps and beers are always great during the game. What I really appreciated was I never had to call our server for a refill as she was always checking in and she also kept our waters full - always a good idea during a long game! Oh, and if course the beer tasted great - the Pirhana was definitely a favorite. Great beer and better service helped turn my opinion of this BJ's around."
Kate M.,"Placerville, CA",0,7,,4.0,9/14/2015,My food was ok it needed a little sauce which I asked for. Made it much better. Beer prices a little  high in my opinion  6 bucks. Good service. Plus the deserts are pretty  tasteu. Will definitely go back tho.
Kelly L.,"Rancho Murieta, CA",0,2,3,5.0,8/17/2014,"We have eaten at BJ's many times. We almost always have a great meal with good service and a fun atmosphere. We like to take the family here because they have good menu selection for the kids and it's a good atmosphere for little ones. Our server Shantae was very nice, friendly, and professional. You have to get a Pizookie or you're missing out! Also, they have an amazing beer selection of their own brewed beer. Enjoy!"
Kaleah G.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",1,2,12,1.0,7/4/2015,"If I could, I would give this bjs a negative star review. First off, our server seemed like they had something else on their mind rather than their job. It took 30 minutes after we got our drinks to put our food order in then 45 minutes after that we finally got our food. However, the fries that came with one of the burgers were cold and the other burger didn't even come with fries or the onion strings that came on the burger. After telling the server about the onion strings, we never got them. We had to wait another 20 minutes for the fries that didn't show up originally. We went for a birthday and we had told our server about it, and he said he would bring a pazokee but it never came. They even ended up running out of co2 for the soda machine!! We sat down at the table at 7pm and we FINALLY got out of the restaurant at 9:30. I would just think that a company who prides themselves on customer service and satisfaction would be better prepared."
Troy J.,"Sloughhouse, CA",23,70,33,4.0,8/18/2012,"Great burgers, I love the atmosphere, big screen tv's with sports, the help is always great-good place to eat."
Wes S.,"Lincoln, CA",41,354,23,4.0,12/9/2013,"Came here Saturday night since it has been so long.  I always have so many issues trying to figure out what to order.  Pizza?  Loaded Tater?  Salad?  Burger?  Fish tacos?  Flat bread pizza?  Well while I was deciding we ordered a bottle of wine since during the holiday season all bottles are half off.  SCORE!!!  Also got a Jeremiah because I love me some red beer.  Buddy and wife got a blonde.  I finally decided on the balsamic chicken plate.  Which is two chicken breasts over a bed of dark lettuce, mashed taters and onion strings.  HOLY CRAP BATMAN! What a fantastic meal!!!  They even drizzle balsamic all over the place, it looked pretty cool.  I would of taken a picture but I was so hungry and just dug right in.  I killed the whole plate and was one step away from licking the plate.  I just found my go to meal at BJ's.  Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was our waiter went missing for a while and we needed some assistance.  Great night, great meal!"
