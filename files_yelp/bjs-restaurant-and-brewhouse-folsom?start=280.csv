Marti A.,"CA, CA",0,14,,2.0,8/6/2015,"The oxymoron here is that BJ's, up until recently, would always get a 5 star review from us!  The lunch crowd gave us the first clue.  Usually, this restaurant is standing room only at lunch and dinner times.  Today it was, conspicuously, rather empty. In spite of the sparse lunch crowd, the first obvious difference was the slow service.  Then, we noticed the lack of condiments on the table.....only salt and pepper.  One must ask for sugar for iced tea, etc.  Finally, we placed our order. Mine,  (the lunch) Southern  fried chicken and my husband's, a small flat bread pizza with a salad.  The chicken was a small, thin and dry piece on top of a HUGE mound of potatoes with a small dollop of gravy.  This is accompanied by a corn mix scattered around the potatoes.  It was difficult to cut the chicken, it was so dry and hard.  The potatoes were tasty but dry without gravy to enhance them and the corn was like an afterthought. Usually, this is a small (but visible) piece of chicken on a small mound of potatoes on top of a nice portion of the corn mix.  The gravy usually drips down over the potatoes.  All very tasty!  The veggies compliment the chicken, potatoes and gravy as a Southern dish should.  The pepper gravy is so good that I always request a small side to augment the standard.  The lunch item I was served today made me feel as though we were in the wrong restaurant.....no comparison!  My husband's lunch was a small salad which was mostly slivered carrots, instead of lettuce, and his flat bread pizza was extremely greasy. Please know that we have had these items before and that they were delicious and well prepared.  We do not expect haute cuisine at BJ's but, we have always enjoyed the good service, outstanding food, atmosphere, camaraderie and reasonable prices which have all been consistent.  We are hoping that there has been a glitch in the system where, perhaps, the accountant decided to take over the BJ protocols? or, the CFO?  We fervently hope that whoever designed the ""NEW"" image for BJ's, has since been replaced with the old model!!  We would rather pay more and leave with a happy heart and a satisfied palate.  We plan to return before searching for a new favorite.  We are members of BJ's Premier Rewards and would like to keep this as our 'go to' standard.   Marti and Al"
Hugo B.,"San Francisco, CA",1,31,3,5.0,1/9/2014,"Now, every time I go to BJ's, I end up ordering the same thing - buffalo burger. It is excellent. Just make sure you request how its done, otherwise they will bring it practically raw."
Patti R.,"Sacramento, CA",105,549,113,1.0,11/15/2011,"**This is for service on Sunday 11/13/11 at about 2 p.m.** WORST SERVICE**  *NO STARS* Waited 20 min..no waitress to take our order. I went to the Hostess station and asked for a manager. The girl looked really uncomfortable and said she would try to find one. *NONE ever came*  It was not busy yet servers were standing around talking. My husband went to the bar to get a beer and the bartender didn't charge him. She gave him a receipt to give to the server! I can only imagine the money they must lose using this system.  The table next to us was complaining about the wait for drinks and the server finally came up and apologized for 'taking an hour' to get their drinks. Then she proceeded to take their food order! We had heard enough, we went back to the bar, paid for the beer and we got the HELL out of there. I will NEVER go back to this location! Bad Management, Bad Service. *On another note, we headed to Buffalo Wild Wings across the street and they saved the day! Excellent service and food!!*"
Steve V.,"Folsom, CA",25,61,44,1.0,8/27/2014,"Made reservations and show up and they didn't have a record of my reservation. Asked to speak with a manager because they were trying to make my party wait almost 2 hours. And he shows up and starts arguing with me in front of the other customers and the hosts were denying I called when I even showed them a phone log of the conversation and he kept being rude. I'm a marine and I'm hot tempered so I threw their buzzer back at them and told them I don't want spit in my food and went to Pete's Brewhouse instead. I started raising my voice and so did the manager and someone behind me was telling me to hurry up and I told him I'd deal with him when I was done. Manager wouldn't admit he was wrong and we're both yelling at each other, there were kids around so he's lucky. Horrible service, very unprofessional, you don't make reservations and then change your mind about reservations when the party is there. Who yells and argues with customers like that? In front of everyone in line and people at the tables were looking. They took my reservation and probably gave it to someone else or just scrapped it and came on really rude trying to fight in the restaurant. It was very embarrassing because I had guests. I'm never going back here ever again! I'd recommend Pete's Brewhouse, better service and the management won't try to argue and fight you in front of customers and your party guests for messing things up."
Grant B.,"Sacramento, CA",1,173,,3.0,5/19/2012,"Happy Hour at BJ's Beers are $1 off, and apps are $2 off or mini pizza half off.   Pizza was the hit and is the best value.  Had the Advo spring rolls, which were ok but not a big fan of hot advocado and the sauce was very sweet.   Kitchen was very slow, but the service was great.  By 6pm the place is mobbed, so get there early for Happy hour."
Laurie P.,"San Jose, CA",1,26,15,1.0,11/12/2013,"This doesn't even deserve 1 star. The few times I went, and brought home leftovers, they were mushy and up edible.  The Bar is fun, but that's not really one of my interests anymore. Other than that, I'd rather have a PB & J sandwich!"
Shey S.,"Pollock Pines, CA",7,36,3,5.0,4/25/2014,"I don't understand why the overall rating is so low on this place. Every time I come in here I've had the best service and AMAZING food. They're very receptive to the younger children we sometimes bring in, always super attentive and friendly, and I'll repeat, the food is AMAZING. Even the occasional times I've come in by myself to get a nice meal or kill some time, they'll spend the extra few minutes to talk to me and just in general be friendly, I love it here. Get a Pizookie if you come here, they're friggin delicious!"
Ryan H.,"Fair Oaks, CA",25,193,104,4.0,10/8/2013,"Been going to Bj's since they opened! They have a large beer selection. I like that they have also started carrying other beers besides their own. Huge menu with burgers, pizza and everything in between. My personal favorite is the new orleans jambalaya it goes great with a cold IPA!"
Danielle M.,"Folsom, CA",44,52,8,1.0,7/1/2015,"First of all I went in on my sisters 21st birthday, Our server didn't greet our table for at least ten minutes. Then he asked if we wanted to get drinks started for us. We order some cocktails but didn't receive them for yet another ten minutes. Mind you this was on a Monday night!! Finally we got our drinks. Isaac then left our table looking overwhelmed. We wanted to order by then we have been in the restaurant for a half an hour without food. He finally comes back to our table and then takes our order. My friend and I wanted a Cesar salad before our meal came out. It came out yet another ten minutes. Plus no Cesar dressing was on the salad. So I wasn't just going to eat lettuce. I asked Isaac for dressing since my salad had none on it. I timed him with my fitbit timer and my sister was just so embarrassed that it was her 21st birthday dinner with her friends and she was getting so disrespected by bjs. Isaac then comes over with a pazookie and asks if her name was Danielle. I said no that is my name her name is becca. Just an over all worst experience I have had at bjs. We left no tip because why should we? We were at bjs for over 2 hours... plus the table behind us was upset with Isaac also because he messed up a cheeseburger twice the lady manager looked so annoyed I didn't want to bother telling her why we were upset also. I then wrote into bjs right then in there on the website. I got a email from a manager there apologizing for the service and Isaac is in training. Ya ok. I was suppose to get a 25 dollar gift card in the mail. that was 3 weeks ago. never got it. thanks bjs not going back."
Amy W.,"Citrus Heights, CA",15,13,9,2.0,6/28/2013,"My husband and I arrived on a Thursday prior to 7pm (happy hour) was assured we would receive our drinks for the happy hour price. We sat in the bar, waiting about 10 mins for even someone to approach us to take our drink order. We then proceeded to wait an additional 5-7 mins to receive those! We both ordered the calazone, I ordered the Feta and Watermelon salad. Our dinner took about 25 mins to even arrive and then the manager told me O we are out of the greens to make the Feta/watermelon salad would you like something else. So I ordered something else. That took an additional 5 mintues to receive. Our server only came by once to check on us we were finished with our meal and I had to go seek someone out for our check because our server was chatting with a co-worker. When we did get it it was wrong, the drinks were not at happy hour price and by this time I was done. Bj's has good food, their service at Folsom needs major work! I do not come to spend hard earned money on a meal I have to work for! I can do that at home."
Malayna K.,"Carmichael, CA",15,47,44,5.0,3/12/2014,"Best place to go with family! Fun and not too loud. Staff always friendly. Took my grandma here for her birthday, and our waiter was very sweet and brought out a BIG cookie with a candle on top, with Ice Cream on the side. Perfect for all of us to eat together."
Glenn S.,"Fair Oaks, CA",1005,424,421,5.0,12/1/2013,"I love this place, especially for the bruschetta and the pizza. I come here a couple of times a month to relax and have a couple of beers. The people always seem very nice."
Larry L.,"Folsom, CA",0,23,,3.0,8/26/2013,"Reading other reviews makes feel better about writing this one.  Yes food is good, service is lacking and costing them business.  We have been patrons for over two years, I like the food and the kids meals are something my kids will eat. However, every time without fail, the hostess stand is the first and worst impression this place has.  If the staff even looks in your direction when you walk in, count yourself lucky.  They give off the impression that you are putting them out by showing up.   I am old enough to have witnessed  East Germany before the wall came down, this service takes me back, ahh, good times. Name? Pager shoved at you.  no other words spent at you, or even an estimate of when you can expect to be seated. Wait staff is good, some new employees and some experience ones, all accepable.   Needless to say, my spouse has sworn off BJs as an option for going to dinner.  so my whole point in writing this review is, my spouse was out of town so I snuck my kids over to eat yesterday.  You guessed it same front door treatment.  I was actually a little apprehensive approaching the front desk, and I thought I should not have to feel like this to dine somewhere, the food isn't that good.   Manager needs to put two employees who hate each other at the front and tell them to catch the other giving bad service.  I prefer to hear a fake polite greeting, then nothing at all.  After all we are not in mother russia."
Karl P.,"Sacramento, CA",1253,121,2,4.0,1/23/2012,"Always a good place to meet, drink, and eat. Nice bar. Lots of seating as well as room to stand around and gawk. Food here is always good. I doubt you'll have anything here you don't like. My current favorite is the steak salad. A delightful combo of tastes. And the beer selection is great, whether in-house brands or others."
Cathy P.,"Portland, OR",464,382,5,4.0,1/24/2011,"Never been to a BJ's anywhere. Was visiting husband's family in Folsom (the city, not the Prison) and we went here for lunch after our 8 year old niece's basketball game. Very large, very noisy, but comfortable with a friendly waitstaff and real cloth napkins. I can't help it, I NOTICE these things. Kind of a sports-themed motif with some Hollywood thrown in is the best way to describe the interior.  Husband and I both ordered the halibut fish tacos but they had run out of halibut and were substituting cod. Great choice! Panko-crusted, perfectly fried fish wrapped in corn tortillas with chipotle mayonnaise, Santa Fe dressing, Napa cabbage, carrots, red onions and cilantro. Served with tortilla chips, avocado cream sauce and fire-roasted tomato salsa. To tell the truth, I thought the portion (2) was rather small and could have eaten one more but that's probably because I was starving and they were SO GOOD. A huge, the biggest baked potato I have ever seen (the size of a small dog. SRSLY) was ordered by my BIL and he managed to pack every bit of it away. Nephew had the pulled pork sandwich & french fries. It was also a huge portion. Little niece only eats pasta (yes, a real picky eater) and had the angel hair Toscana pasta and said it had too many tomatoes in it (she doesn't eat veggies) but it looked good to me. SIL had the Cuban burger. A half-pound burger served sandwich-style, topped with oven-roasted ham, Swiss cheese, crispy dill pickles, Dijonnaise and mustard and of course, lots of french fries. Everyone but me and the kiddlings had beer. The Piranha Pale Ale and Jeremiah Red were the big hits.  I know this goes against everything the media says about putting calorie count info on menus, but I was really appreciative that BJ's made this info available. I did use the calorie counts of a few dishes in making my final choice; it wasn' t the ONLY deciding factor but it was one of them.  BJ's has the biggest menu, as in pages, I've ever seen. It was almost nauseating turning all the pages. Everything from pizza, salads, sandwiches, burgers, pasta, to desserts. Let me tell you, if you can't find something to eat here, you won't find it anywhere else! Not fine cuisine but not fast food either. I nice place to spend some time with family or friends. I'd go back, especially if my BIL paid again - LOL."
Pearl T.,"Fresno, CA",51,184,91,4.0,10/25/2011,"My date took me here a few nights ago. I'm now a fan of the Jeremiah Red Ale, which was nice and malty! The spaghetti with spicy tomato sauce was good. It wasn't that spicy, and the blackened chicken I got with it was also nicely seasoned. Portions were large, and we shared a pizookie for dessert. FYI, you can also get two different flavors of cookie for the pizookie! You know, for the indecisiveness/glutton within all of us..."
Christine W.,"Folsom, CA",32,7,,1.0,8/7/2013,"This was our second attempt and giving BJ's another try. My husband & I had brought my brother and his wife here about a month ago to try for the first time. The food was good but the service was HORRIBLE!  Thinking it was because it was dinner time we would give it another try.  This time my husband, myself and & his bff went for lunch last Friday. We arrived at 1:15pm waited 10 mins to be seated. Not bad. However we sat another 10-15 mins before our waitress ""stopped by"" to get our drink order. At the time we ordered our drinks we ordered chips and salsa too. Our drinks came out pretty quickly however  We again waited another 10-15 mins for chips & salsa to arrive.  There was 3 adults eating and she brings up a small bowl of salsa with not alot of chips.  Instead of taking our order then, she dropped off our chips and left. Finally another 10-15 mins later she decided to stop off at our table to take our order. By this time we had finished off our chips and salsa and asked for more. After about 5 mins and seeing her walk by our table and not saying anything I caught her atten to asked our out salsa & chips. She said they ran out and had to make more..... Our orders were pretty simple, a salad, sandwich and the BBQ special you have currently going on. We waited another 15-20 mins before our meals were brought out by someone other than our waitress. Still no salsa or chips. I said something to the gal who brought out our food.  She seemed surprised when I told her we were still waiting for fresh salsa to come out as our waitress said they ran out. Amazingly she left and was back in less then 2 mins with fresh salsa & chips. By this time we now had our food and wasn't hungry for the chips & salsa. But at $5.99 for a cup of salsa and a small about of chips, you bet I'm asking for seconds. What a rip off!!  Only saving grace was the salsa was pretty good.  After receiving our food we waiting another 10 mins before she stopped by to see how our food was and if we needed anything else. That was pretty much the last time we saw here except to walk by our table to help others tables around her.  Finally I caught her atten to ask for our check. It was closed to 3pm and we wanted out of there!  2 hrs for lunch???  Really??  When I asked for the check nicely she gave me a look  and said ""I was just going to ask you if you want and dessert?"" with attitude. REALLY???  It was all my husband could do to keep me calm We felt like she didnt' think we were good enough to dine in this resturant.  Don't worry this will be the LAST time we eat there! It's too bad cuz the food is pretty good. But the service is HORRIBLE! Would not recomment unless you have hours to eat and drink!!!"
Ethan H.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",0,1,,4.0,5/18/2013,"Summary:  Today (5/18/12) I went with my family to the local BJ's. The hostess was very kind though we had to wait 30 minutes (no reservation). Once we were seated, the waitress immediately started us off with some drinks. The raspberry lemonade was amazing. Food:  For the appetizer, we got the ""onion strings"" which were much better than onion rings. They are lightly breaded and not to oily. My daughter got the spaghetti and meat sauce which she said was very good. The shrimp scampi was a little less flavorful but still decent. I also got a tomato bisque which had just the perfect blend of flavor and creaminess. For dessert we shared a pizookie which is to die for.  Service:  The hostess was very kind and politely told us to wait for our table 30 min and was exactly that. The waitress quickly to our drink orders and came back 5 min. later to take our orders. After we got our food, the waitress came back multiple times to check on us and was a very kind young lady.  Overall: The food was pretty good while the service we received was amazing. I will definitely be back and maybe I'll bring some friends!"
Gail F.,"Long Beach, CA",0,59,1,5.0,6/1/2012,"Great beer !! Good pizza, tilapia... Cobb salad was just a pile of lettuce. Will go for the Beer ! Yum"
Lyn T.,"Placerville, CA",70,33,2,4.0,1/11/2012,"This was my first time at BJ's Brewhouse and I was thoroughly impressed.  Granted, it was a mid-week, mid-day lunch, so service was spectacular!  Jen, our waitress, was very attentive and spot-on. Portion size was HUGE, even for lunch, in my opinion.  The unsweetened ice tea DOES need to be stronger. I have to say that my all-time favorite part of my experience at this place was the restroom art!  LOL  Although, the stall doors were absolutely disgusting, the luscious art adorning the walls of the restroom totally rocked!"
