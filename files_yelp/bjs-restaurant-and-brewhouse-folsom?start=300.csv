Jennae H.,"Manteca, CA",113,264,324,4.0,7/19/2011,"Good ol' BJ's.. I can always count on you for your convenient hours of operation. The food is good, the prices are moderate, the location is ideal, and the customer service is hit or miss. If you're not a member of their Rewards program, get on it. Every $1 you spend (minus alcohol) earns you a point, which can earn you a free pizookie, $5 off a meal, $25 off a meal, etc. One of these days I'll make it in to try their brunch!   Note to self: Patriotic Water: Collins glass, layered. 3/4 oz. Watermelon Pucker, 3/4 oz. Island Blue Pucker, 3/4 oz. Grey Goose Vodka, and Sierra Mist."
Vrede B.,"Martinez, CA",0,58,8,2.0,5/4/2013,"This is the 3rd time in a row that I went into a restaurant which appeared competent enough to make a hamburger cooked medium or medium rare...I was very clear with the waiter...PLEASE COOK TO MEDIUM OR MEDIUM RARE.  His response, ""you want it pink inside."" I thought perfect...For the third time in a row I got 2 patties where every once of juice/flavor in the meat had been cooked to ultra dry...My grandson ordered sliders and they got the same treatment...The burgers where not cheap...So, what's up, why are cooks slaughtering burgers...I didn't return it because I do not return food but...I will not return to BJ's.  My food was not worth any stars...The rest of my family seemed satisfied with their entrees and I thought that the service was top notched...Totally let down by the kitchen..."
Nhung T.,"Oakland, CA",208,773,,3.0,12/28/2010,"Went here for happy hours (4-7) and to watch Michael turner get stopped. It was super crowded but happened to be lucky to find a seat at the bar area. Ended up ordering a couple of beers (I like the Jeremiah red), pizzas and appetizers. For the pizza the buffalo chicken was really good had a kick to it. The BJs special pizza was also good, basically combination pizza consisted of sausage, pepperoni, etc. For appetizers ordered the chicken wings, which was amazing, that's a must. Finally the sampler which had artichoke dip (loved it really hot), avocado egg rolls ( did not like at all, no flavor and the dipping sauce was horrible), southwestern egg rolls (pretty good, had zesty taste to it), and mozzarella sticks (pretty typical). Overall it wasn't that bad, but hh menu can be better. It's basically $2 off appetizers, $1 off draft beers and cocktails, and half off mini pizzas."
Matthew B.,"Chico, CA",35,332,71,3.0,8/11/2013,"Well this place was ok.  It is large, corporate, and the food is average.  The staff were nice, it was a clean place, and the service was prompt."
Skeeter Z.,"Sacramento, CA",0,56,,1.0,2/2/2014,"Was there a couple of weeks ago with a group of about 30.  While I thought the servers were attentive and responsive, some things got left out (like sour cream for baked potatoes) and one person got it but the person sitting next to her didn't!  My problem was with what was supposed to be their sesame chicken salad.  For $12 I got a huge pile of lettuce, a sprinkle of what was supposed to be won ton strips but had no flavor at all, and a fairly decent amount of chicken, which also had no flavor.  Included was three or four mandarin orange segments and sesame dressing which had no flavor.  Worst salad I've ever had in my life.  Tasteless and a rip off.  Never again."
Kim T.,"Elk Grove, CA",28,6,2,5.0,1/11/2013,"Great service, food & friendly staff. Tim the bartender was awesome!"
Merisa M.,"Sacramento, CA",294,140,56,3.0,7/10/2011,"I've had BJ's plenty of times before, but this was the first time I didn't order their Pizza.  I ordered The Grilled Burger Melt, which is a burger on Sourdough Bread topped with caramelized onions, their ""special"" sauce, and melty cheese.   It was DELICIOUS!!! I was absolutely starving after a day out on Folsom Lake and this burger hit the spot!! It was perfectly cooked and seasoned, juicy, BIG, and left me feeling sad after I finished it as I wanted more! But, why the three stars you might ask, especially considering the fact that my burger was so amazing!  Service was terrible!! I don't want to generalize it to all the waiters and waitresses of BJ's, but the waiter we had was definitely less than average on what you would expect. He wasn't friendly, he wasn't ""on top of things"", he didn't even come by to ask how our food was.  I didn't want to leave him a very nice tip, but the company I was with are much too kind and generous. My recommendations:  if you ever go to any BJ's and want something other than their pizzas, try the Grilled Burger Melt!  I'd highly recommend it!"
C B.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",0,49,3,5.0,11/23/2011,"Great Pizza Crust!  Pizza is not greasy, but done perfectly. Enjoyed the Pizza and enjoyed the Staff.  Very good service.  Waiters had a great attitude.  This was when they were very busy on a Saturday night.  Great job.   Me and my family will be back."
Stoney H.,"Newburgh, IN",105,51,3,3.0,2/21/2013,Food was good but had to ask for silverware and finished our food without any drink they forgot to bring them even know we reminded them when we gut out food
Emily L.,"Novato, CA",55,240,67,2.0,5/18/2009,"WE went out for my future brother-in-law's birthday here, also we wanted a good beer. I have driven by this place for years and have always wanted to go, last night was our night! Also is is currently hotter than Hades at my dad's house so a nice dinner in free Air-Con was a plus!  We were seated in the massive dining room an there were televisions in view of everyone, including my baby who loved that. He never sees TV so boom! He learned how to watch the NBA Playoffs at dinner. WE had a booth and it was comfy and not too loud which was nice.  Our server came over and while taking our drink orders informed us there were ""no specials"" on anything, ok. When my sis asked which drink she preferred between one or the other she said she liked one, but gave no reason why, um ok. She took our drink orders and left, we had all asked for water also, I think it is customary to ask now which is nice sometimes you get water and didn't need or want it. Wasteful these days!  Returning about 10 minutes later with no drinks she said that they were out of IPA beer, would I like something else. Sure, did they have a comparable one? She looked at me blankly and said "" here is the menu"" I think the servers should know a bit about their drinks, but here I guess not. Also I think it would have been appropriate for her to bring everyone elses drinks as it was hot out and hey maybe they were thirsty. I chose another beer and when she returned again with all our drinks we asked again for water, since she had forgotten it.  We ordered a pizza which came out in great time, it was super good, but we had to ask the busser cleaning the table next to us for peppers/cheese etc. He looked confused/pissed that we asked him and walked away. He returned a minute later and smiled at me then started to clean the table next to us again. Our server appeared in a few minutes and asked what we needed, uh why did she have to be bothered?  All in all the food was good, but the service sucked for us. They were not crazy busy, it was a Sunday night. It was moderately priced and we got the crazy-good Pizookie for dessert."
Jessica L.,"Sacramento, CA",242,328,28,2.0,5/11/2011,"I normally just eat pizza here...it is the only thing on the menu typically that I can stand. I tried to venture out of the box and try their new coconut shrimp entrée. I wish I had stuck with my old standby, pizza *sad face* . The shrimp seemed to have been put in the microwave and were limp, mushy almost....I ate few of them, then stopped for fear of getting sick.... I know B.J.'s isn't great food but it shouldn't be almost inedible either right?  This is a great place to watch sporting events I guess but other than that I have no use for this place....and the bar is WAY too small..."
Anthony W.,"Sacramento, CA",407,409,109,4.0,6/5/2008,"We had a large group today of 17 people and I have to applaud BJ's for a job well done. We had a few late people and it complicated the ordering, but our server handled everything with aplomb (with help from her fellow servers). The 17% gratuity that was automatically added was well deserved. The menu is extensive, it reads like a novella, so there are plenty of choices for everyone. Burgers, pizza, salads, pastas, etc. It took about 20 minutes for the food to come, which seemed reasonable for a large group. Everyone seemed happy with their food. The portions were generous, as they should be, since the prices are on the high side for lunch. Ice tea is $2.45 here! (How much does it cost to make 16 oz of ice tea, 5 cents?) I ordered the ""shave 5 years off your life burger"". It was called the burger melt, and it was basically a patty melt. The thing was dripping with oil and grease, a real decadent delight. It had loads of caramelized onions which were sweet, an awesome flavor combination with the meat and cheese. The gal sitting next to me was blunt and didn't hesitate to speak her mind. She told me my burger looked disgusting and was soaked in grease and lard. I told her not to look at it and to enjoy her salad. I ate the whole thing. *grin*"
Shannon G.,"Fair Oaks, CA",34,199,1,2.0,8/1/2011,"Lunch Sunday 1pm.  Many tables empty.  We were told to wait by the stairs, and then were seated promptly.  Table we were shown to was dirty - was cleaned promptly after we pointed it out. Brunch menu only until 1pm so ordered from the lunch menu.  Wedge salads for both, and one meatball calzone to share. Iceberg lettuce completely colorless.  Husband's ranch dressing okay.  My blue cheese dressing horrible - had that gluey consistency and that vinegar-y flavor of cheap bottled dressing, or Miracle Whip based.  Very few small bits of cheese.  Definitely not housemade! Calzone dough very good, almost flaky, nicely browned, not doughy.  Marinara sauce, cheese, and ingredients all very good, EXCEPT the meatball was not whole meatballs.  It HAD TO BE previously frozen little diced pieces of very processed meatball mixture.  And those little pieces were flavorless.  They could have disguised the processed nature of the meatball filling with some herbs in it. We would order the calzone again, just with a different meat, although the meatball experience makes me wonder how processed the sausage filling might be. Service from Austin pretty good, although their sales training is pretty obvious.  They've got their sales pitch down for the beer, the dessert, etc. No need to return.  We were here only to use a gift certificate.  Just another chain experience."
David B.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",110,89,102,1.0,5/11/2011,I just went there tonight to take my sons. Right when the food came one of them had to go to the bathroom. We folded my our napkin on our chairs. We got back and the bus boy was clearing our table. They immediatly realized we just got our food but we had to wait again.  I was a little frustrated as I expected the waiter to at least check or offer a dessert but he never did. Also pretty annoyed that they didn't bring me a new beer as mine was half full when we he cleared our table. When I walked out I told the manager I was disappointed and he didn't say sorry. Food was decent both times I got it
Dawn W.,"Folsom, CA",0,2,,4.0,1/30/2014,They have a great Gluten Free Pizza. It's hard to find a good G-Free pizza crust but BJ's figured it out for sure! This is a good place to go for any occasion. Tons of choices on the menu and the G-Free menu! LOVE the Pazookies!
Liz K.,"Placerville, CA",0,33,,4.0,1/15/2015,If you like gluten free pizza - this is the place to go. It's great. The place is a little loud - so having a conversation is tough if you go when it's busy. I've always been very happy with the food here.
Jennifer G.,"Sacramento, CA",9,15,2,4.0,7/28/2014,"I have a love/hate relationship with this BJ's. I love their food and the menu has such a variety of choices that you can always find something. I hate that sometimes the staff can be rude and unattentive and also that it gets insanely busy to the point where the line is out the door and around the building. I know that last part they can't help but I felt it relevance to the review (maybe lol). But really, they have such a great menu that it is completely worth waiting and the possibility of dealing with a less than stellar host or server. Their personal pizza's are the perfect size and taste amazing, the egg rolls are to die for and honestly who can beat the mini sized menu of apps? I can go on and on about the food, but just know facing the crowd is worth it for a pizuki! (however it's spelled)"
Brad W.,"Sacramento, CA",1,39,22,3.0,10/18/2013,"Any beer here works. Service is very good, and the food is OK. My wife loves it that why I go."
Issac M.,"Chino, CA",0,557,17,3.0,6/18/2011,"This place only gets three stars because they have a plethora of food to choose from as well as beer. They're pizza is to die for as well. However, this place can really kill your wallet. And the prices keep going up. This alone keeps me from eating there regularly.  A good place to eat on occasion unless you're a high roller.  Furthermore, service is consistently slow. Always has been.  But my biggest pet peeve.. They have scaled down the infamous pazookie to a mere teaser."
greg m.,"Folsom, CA",1,24,,3.0,3/30/2011,"Or to be more accurate: 4 stars for the beer. . . 3 stars for the food. . . 2 stars for the service and the wait and the ambience. . . Love their stout, and the other beers I've tried have all been good.   Food is . . . dependable.  Haven't had anything that was bad.  Tasty in general, but nothing to rave about.  (Though the chili was pretty good.)   Service fair, but the place is always packed in the evenings (never tried it for lunch), and the main dining area seems way noisier than it ought to be.  I know its called a ""brewhouse,"" so I'm not expecting fine dining ambience, but 85% of the floor space is tables instead of bar, so I'm also not expecting to have to shout to be heard when I'm at a table.  Some kind of screen between the bar and the dining area to deaden the noise a bit, and it would be a much nicer experience. All in all, we'll go there a few times per year, but it's not a favorite."
