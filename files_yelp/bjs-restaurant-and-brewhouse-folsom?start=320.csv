Denise P.,"San Jose, CA",253,311,78,4.0,7/10/2010,"Usually like to come here during their lunch time specials, or happy hour. Service here is pretty good, the ambiance is like any other Bj's Restaurant. Their happy hour is great: $5 mini pizzas, $2 off Appetizers, and $1 off mixed drinks. I like to go on Tuesdays because it's an 'extra' happy hour day with $2 pints of bj's brewed beer! The food is good too. The menu is very extensive ranging from salads and sandwiches to asian spring rolls.  Pazookie's are great, but my friend and I ordered one from here once and they ran out, and the next time we came the cookie was overcooked that we couldn't even break into it :("
Susan M.,"Folsom, CA",0,23,,1.0,11/22/2014,"just here on saturday 11/22/2014 never ever come to this place with the lack of customer service they provide asked in the beginning for seprate checks fina out ""sorry we can ' do that for your party"" how are we to pay with a credit card then? ""you'll have to pay the whole check and ask the rest of your party to pay you back"" are you kidding me! worst service ever!"
Flora V.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",7,28,2,2.0,7/18/2012,"I'm a very easy going person and can tolerate most things.  However, working at a 4 star hotel, I have come to appreciate good service.  Unfortunately, this BJ's lacked good service skills.  There were so many staff members floating around that you couldn't blame they were slammed and had inadequate staffing.  They didn't provide us with enough silverware, failed to give me a spoon with my soup so it got cooler by the time we got one ( had to get up and get it), and they refilled a regular Pepsi with a diet one.  The food was average.  Manager was called and we explained our disappointments, he apologized, but it just seemed to be another compliant to him (no biggie).  Not going back again."
Rosie B.,"Tustin, CA",87,91,29,3.0,12/8/2010,"I was in town for the California International Marathon and our group decided of the options for restaurants, BJ's would do the job.  Nothing to fabulous about this particular location. The food was good and the service decent. A few times I couldn't understand our server. For a while I was convinced he was from Australia. I do have to give him props for dealing with my family though. They're a tough crowd.  If I'm ever in Folsom again, I will be sure to stop by.  The end."
Vikki M.,"Folsom, CA",1,34,,4.0,11/15/2014,I am starting to come back for the lunch specials.  Excellent service and the food is always very good.  They are starting to switch the menu around finally so some good new items to pick from.  Will be back.
Gef J.,"Walnut Creek, CA",1,56,66,4.0,1/5/2013,"Came here with a party of 6 at the lunch hour.  Everything was great.  The food, service, and price.  Always consistent"
greg C.,"Sacramento, CA",1,84,5,3.0,4/8/2013,"This place is always busy, and I just don't know why.  It could be that so few people in Folsom actually cook at home (Folsom soccer moms play tennis, drink lattes and have plastic surgery, they are too busy to feed their families). Have been here many times and the food is ok, but not really special.  Ate lunch there last weekend and had buffalo chicken pieces and calimari.  The chicken pieces looked and tasted like they came rigth out of a box of Tyson's.  The calamari was ok, but nothing special about it.  I like the nutty brewnette beer but the other beers are just passable. For better food, go next door to Land Ocean for the happy hour menu."
Kay L.,"Folsom, CA",1,54,1,1.0,9/18/2012,"Just had dinner there..Ordered chicken wings appetizer (came out with tabasco and ranch dressing drizzled on top) Calamari appetizer (lots of batter rubbery) soup and salad (soup was ok, all our salads were dripping with dressing) kids had pasta (a little butter and broccoli) and ribs (dry no flavor). Service was spotty, things didnt come out at same time and the dirty appetizer dishes and our plates sat piled up until we paid the bill and left. Our bill was 80.00, which would have been fine if we walked out feeling, wow, want a fantastic dinner, worth every penny.....Manager gave out certificates for return visit, we gave ours to our parents, we wont be back."
Mike A.,"Folsom, CA",1,120,4,5.0,4/3/2013,We always have an excellent experience here.  Staff is attentive and food always comes out correctly.  Their pizza is delicious and many toppings to choose from.  Only gripe would be that they run out of pizzookies towards the end of the night sometimes.
Cynthia B.,"Greenwood, CA",4,61,8,5.0,4/5/2010,"We're missing our slightly slower version over in Natomas but we snagged a bar table (our preference) just as I gave my name to the host. Server - super nice - sorry bad of me not to recall name! Quick efficient service.  I opted for the pulled pork sliders - still on my quest to find the best since Cap Garage seriously jacked my fav. Server said she loves them. mmmmm okay 3 stars wont order again. Lacked any zing in the bbq sauce, pleased to have 4 sliders vs. 2 or 3. I piled my cole slaw on top hoping the vinegar in it would help - nope. Opted instead for my chalula to give me that kick. Fries always fresh, crisp and hot.  Hubby had his usual bacon (crispy) cheese burger, always perfectly well done. no complaints ever with BJs..."
Richard A.,"Placerville, CA",39,193,489,4.0,10/5/2010,"We like hitting BJ's every once in a while. The have an extensive menu with traditional American fare, specialty pizzas and excellent Asian-fusion and dinner salad options. They offer their own craft brew selections on tap-try the Blond and the Tonkawa Stout.  Kid love the fresh baked Pizzuki dessert!"
Thomas S.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",0,20,,4.0,4/20/2013,"I swear I was going to give this place a 5-star rating, just for the setting! But it lost a star because it's too pricey. It is definitely a really cool place to go to eat. They have a huge selection of foods. Their flat bread pizzas are really cool!"
Sara B.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",174,170,142,4.0,8/17/2008,"I went here as part of our company's quarterly luncheon. The service was good in the sense that the waitresses were friendly and constantly kept checking in on us to see if we needed refills.  I can't say much about the prices, since I honestly didn't look at them. I've been to the one in Elk Grove before, and I vaguely remember most entrees being around $10 or less, but I could be wrong. As for food, I decided to try something new this time and so, I ordered the fettuccine Alfredo with grilled chicken breast, which was very disappointing. I wanted something fattening, rich and creamy, but this dish just didn't meet my expectations on any level. It tasted way too bland and dry; I couldn't taste the creaminess of the sauce which Alfredo is known to possess.  On the plus side, their Pizookie is to die for! It's a warm and huge chewy cookie, that's topped with scoops of vanilla ice cream. You can get the cookie in chocolate chunk, white chocolate macadamia nut, peanut butter or oatmeal raisin walnut. I personally prefer the chocolate chunk one. I tried the Oreo Pizookie, but it was way too sweet. The wait time is usually super long; this time around it was okay since our company made reservations, but the one in Elk Grove is always packed and has long wait times. I can't say the same for this location, since the quarterly luncheon was the first time I went there, but most likely it's the same. All BJ Restaurants are pretty popular and well-known. Overall, it's a good place to eat, but next time I'll be sticking to the Great White Pizza that they have, which I usually order. Now THAT is pretty delicious! Other than that, the only real reason I go there are for their Pizookies, which you can't find any place else."
K F.,"Livermore, CA",0,127,4,1.0,7/1/2013,horrible wait staff and organization. Food is average at high prices.
Wayne D.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",18,15,,1.0,6/18/2012,"They changed the Pizza!  I have been going to BJ's for years down in So. Cal. and the last year at this BJ's.  The pizza used to be cooked and served in an iron skillet which made the crust flaky and delicious.  Now it is served in a plastic plate and isn't very good.  The pizza had no sauce and very little toppings.  I was informed that the pizza was still cooked in the iron skillet, just transferred over to the plastic plate, and maybe the cook didn't coat the pan properly.  As we were waiting for management to come to our table a customer at another table saw that we sent our pizza back, and told us his pizza was sent back also.   BJ's used to rotate there specialty beer on a monthly basis, always something different to look forward to, not anymore!  Last year it seemed the pumpkin ale would never go away.  The first BJ's I went to I waited two hours to get a seat, and would have done it again.  Not anymore, take your soggy, no flavor, pizza and sell it to the unsuspecting."
Kara S.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",198,425,79,3.0,7/13/2012,"Totally packed, but the service was okay. The food is just like any other BJs. Fried and fatty. But of course, tasty."
Shelli C.,"Folsom, CA",0,5,,1.0,3/1/2014,"Waited 20 minutes for water...sad.... Then another half hour for food. After we ate another 20 minutes for the check. Another table with the same waitress kept waving their hand to get served. To top it all off, we had to go and find our own forks and napkins. Good food, very poor service. Next time going to Jack's next door."
Gary R.,"Palm Desert, CA",1124,372,2711,3.0,11/18/2011,"Much like Gordon Biersch, BJ's serves it's place in getting microbrews into regions where there are no other breweries. However, they can never quite overcome the good west coast microbreweries. Decent food and decent brews, not great."
Kara R.,"Hillsboro, OR",77,64,3,4.0,12/29/2011,"I came here for lunch with a friend- expecting to order their gluten-free pizza and be disappointed.  I've just heard they are a bit overpriced for the quality of the food- I'm not hating- just mentioning what my expectations were. First off, the bartender was fabulous.  He was very nice and patient and his recommendation of the berry cider was spot-on and only 3.50 per glass.  I may have had two.  It was a very happy lunch hour.   My friend had the southwestern avocado egg roll type things.  It wasn't on the gluten-free menu- I'm guessing it was a flour wrap plus soy sauce. She said it was super tasty and would recommend it for a table of four due to the huge portion size (it was an appetizer).  The pizza was fantastic.  It was a bit better than Straw Hat Pizza's GF crust in that they weren't seeming to rely on you enjoying the ""cracker crust"" deal.  BJ's crust was chewy and wonderful.  The kitchen forgot my fresh basil, but fixed it within a minute of bringing it to their attention.   Clean bathrooms.  My only issue was the waitress who was talking on her phone while I was trying to pee.  It gave me stage fright.  Seriously, go out in the loading dock. I would definitely return to split a pizza with the hubby."
Megan B.,"Sacramento, CA",2,21,,5.0,5/19/2010,"I just love this place - quick, easy, great food and service. pretty much sums it up. and I just love their strawberry lemonade - free refills in huge glasses since I am the DD for my dining friends. they love to put back the beers tho.... they have a full bar and someday I will pass the DD torch to another dining companion so I can enjoy!  My buddy on this trip had a bacon cheeseburger well done (and it WAS!) skinny cut fries. He pretty much noshed through this huge burger making happy noises along the way. hand got smacked with I sneaked some fries. FINE I held my crispy tiny onion rings as hostage till we swapped.  I had probably my new favorite item - grilled chicken with balsamic reduction sauce, yummy greens and mash poe to die for! I cleaned MY plate and the best part is its on their low cal menu (no idea how something this GOOD could be low cal!)...oh and crispy o-rings I just mentioned.  no room for my pozuki thing I just love...nope we waddled out of there fat and happy!"
