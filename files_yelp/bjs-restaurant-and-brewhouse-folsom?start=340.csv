Yu N.,"Folsom, CA",1,8,,5.0,2/11/2014,"This restaurant is me and my family's favorite.  It has nice sports bar and comfort seating.  You can have TV views from most of the rest seats too. The atmosphere and deco is nice, open yet still cozy.  Wide variety of food choices are good for everyone.  And their services are always good.  I love their Ahi Salad and Pink Cadillac.  It's thee place to dine out!!!"
Marie C.,"South Lake Tahoe, CA",0,10,1,2.0,8/26/2014,"Just barely ""ok"". Got to the place and had a little wait, so I went to the bar to get a beer. Took a while to get seated, so I got to view some of the dinners coming out and I was all about the Asian salad, so that is what I ordered for dinner. It was a long wait, so we had an appetizer platter. It was pretty average, nothing really special. Then our dinner came out and I got this lame salad that was the size of a salad you have with your dinner. I felt as if they gave me the bottom of the barrel, what was barely left over and didn't want to take the time to make me something decent. It definitely did not look like the same salad these people got at the bar I was next to. I even asked them what salad it was. My sister ordered the same salad and it was the same issue and hardly any dressing on it. It took forever to get the waiter, we had to ask the water boy if he would get her for us. It took her a bit to get over to us and then we told her what was going on. She said she was ""sorry"" and I told her it wasn't her fault, but because we had to wait so long, I did not want my salad at all. She said she would go get us more dressing, but I told her again that the salad was not what we asked for. Then the manager comes over and asks if he can do anything for us and I said ""no thank you"", because the wait was a long time and I had lost my appetite. He explained they ran out of the fixings for the salads and that was why it was so small and he also said they were out of the dressing. I would had much rather they come out and tell us they were out of that type of salad and check and see if we'd like to order something else. What a bunch of BS. My g/f had the fried chicken. What a joke! Boxed mashed potatoes, canned corn and dried out fried chicken. It wasn't even hot! GROSS!!!! I'll find somewhere else to eat in Folsom"
Natalie T.,"Placerville, CA",2,65,39,3.0,8/27/2010,"Wanted to try something different in the area... Kinda wish we would have stuck with Thai paradise. I liked the atmosphere, the decor was cool and the service was friendly. The fresh mozzarella and tomato salad was really yummy. However I wasn't crazy about the fish tacos, they were bland. I should have ordered one of the flat bread pizzas, they looked good. The cocktails looked great, I might have to come back and try again at happy hour."
Michael W.,"Gold River, CA",242,194,60,2.0,10/8/2011,"Stay away from the jambalaya. Too salty and too al dente for my tastes. The pizzas are pretty good for deep dish pies if that's what you're looking for. Any of the BJ's are great if you're single and just want to hang out at the bar too. Great food, good servers and tons of tv's to watch your sports"
Pamela R.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",64,84,6,4.0,7/2/2010,"Typically only go here for business lunches. Always decent service. The menu has a large amount of variety! Various beers.  It can get loud here, probably not much for a quiet night on the town. The place can get extremely busy and there may be an hour wait for dinners. There's a separate bar and lots of group seating. I would call this place a bit more of a fancy version of TGIFridays."
Wesley B.,"Stockton, CA",0,2,,1.0,1/15/2012,"Was in last night for a friends birthday.There were about 16 of us service was horrible for the four people helping us out after an hour finally got our order in when we did get our food not one person came to check back on us whenever we needed somthing we had to catch a waiter,waitress just walking by. Then when it came to the check some of us did want separate checks it took well over an hour and a half to figure it out. Asked manager whats going on he came off very rude an unprofessional. Grant I am a younger person no reason to treat me like im stupid. Asking questions about our bill"
Tanya B.,"Fair Oaks, CA",10,9,,1.0,7/26/2014,"The other night my man friend and I went to dinner here.  We ordered our pizza and steak dinner.  The waiter came right back to serve us water and we asked for fritters and a wedge salad.  Hew said no problem & we could get them out first.  I got my salad and then in awhile we got our pizza and steak.  The steak was ordered specifically Medium charred.  It came raw and room temperature!  The new waitress was absolutely darling and helpful.  She took it back and it took 20 minutes to get it back and it almost the same and cold. Then we get the fritters after everything. She called the manager over, Tim Onion, he came to the table with a VERY defensive attitude about it all.  He would not back down about the steak not being even close to how it was cooked and just overall RUDE! He took the fritters and salad off the bill.   The least expensive part of the meal. I have never had corn fritters for dessert.   Not the steak which is what he should have compted."
Janette M.,"Sacramento, CA",199,262,15,4.0,12/23/2006,"I've been to BJ's twice for work holiday luncheons.  Both times, the place was packed yet the service was very accommodating and attentive.  Both times, I ordered the same thing-- the BJ's Burger-- and both times, the burger was oh so good!   I opted for adding extra bacon and cheddar cheese.  You have a choice of wedge-cut seasoned fries or a salad (House or Caesar).  I went with the fries (generous portion) but the salads looked good, too.  The burger is served on a toasted garlic cheese roll with tomatoes, lettuce and pickles.  I would have liked a variety of condiments... we were only given ketchup.  I  should have asked for mayonnaise and mustard. Since it was a work luncheon,  we couldn't  (ahem!) partake in the beers but the beer selection sounded really good.  I'll have to go back  sometime and try them out.  BJ's is a chain so maybe I'll try the Natomas location next time."
Aaron S.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",46,206,22,3.0,6/3/2012,Pizza has been our favorite thing here.. Good.... Beer is OK... Jeremiah Red is my fav.
Linda J.,"Ryde, CA",0,5,1,5.0,5/21/2014,"The service was the best I have ever had. Shout out to Alex as the most amazing waitress, she was on top of drink refills and words cannot even describe how kind she was. Shout out to the kitchen as well, best jalapeno burger I have ever tasted. Hands down best restaurant I have been to in a long time."
Dave C.,"Rescue, CA",0,2,,1.0,11/15/2013,This place is the worst place to order a beer if you're not sitting at the bar. I see lots of waitresses that are not busy at all. Why not adopt a model where any waitress can take a drink order!
Tracy A.,"Oakland, CA",480,1323,605,3.0,1/24/2012,"They don't have an IPA. What is up with that? Good Red Ale and decent Pale Ale. My mom and I shared the fried artichokes, mushrooms (free to us due to an ordering mistake), Ahi tuna, and a Cobb salad. My mom thought she did not like Cobb salads but this changed her mind. I'd go back for a Pale Ale and a Cobb anytime."
Frank C.,"Placerville, CA",7,24,24,4.0,7/3/2010,"Most everyone in the area has been here at least once. This is a great place to have a few brews with your friends. Great food, lots of choices, I'm sure you wont be disappointed. Yes, it is a little loud but most good pubs are. The service has always been excellent and i would say that's good news considering how busy it gets from time to time. Remember to always order the beer by the pitcher because you save a little over the individual pints.  I love the ""Nutty Brewnette"" It's a Brown Ale that wont disappoint you Cleanliness - 4.5 Food selection - 5 Food Quality - 4.5   Service - 3.5   (service a little slow, but that just gives us more time together) Prices - 4  ( Beer prices are much better during Happy-Hour) Total  4.3    (Got'a go with a 4 ) Fingers"
Brittany J.,"El Dorado, CA",1,4,,1.0,6/8/2012,Worst service ever. And the food isn't that great. Won't be coming back for sure
Jeff S.,"Folsom, CA",2,33,1,1.0,6/2/2012,"We have been BJ's customers for several years. Tonight was the second time I paid $27 dollars for a BJ's Favorite pizza that turned out to be mostly dough. There won't be a third. Bye BJ's, hello Chicago Fire."
Betty C.,"Folsom, CA",0,8,2,3.0,4/26/2014,"My husband and I tried to have lunch today, I  ordered tomato soup and salad combo and my husband ordered chicken strips. My order came very quickly and we waited patiently for my husbands order to come. We must have waited for almost 15 minutes. My husband said eat your soup while it's hot. All the while he's getting madder and madder. We came to lunch to have lunch TOGETHER . We told the server that it was not right to serve one meal at a time, of course she stated that soup and salad come out quickly because it's ready to serve. The manager came over and apologized and said that once again soup and salad come out very quickly in case we wanted more. I asked him how we would have to rectify this situation if you ever want to come back. He stated we should tell our server that we would like the meal together OMG."
Kimmie M.,"Livermore, CA",225,201,27,4.0,1/6/2012,"Had the best time here. First of all, an AWESOME deal that I hope they bring back soon--two salads, a medium pizza, and a pizookie for $20. Cha Ching. Service was excellent as well as the atmosphere. Our waitress was friendly and funny. Our pizza--barbeque chicken minus the tomatoes add some mushrooms. I would ask for light cilantro next time, as it was a little bit too much. My guess is had we gotten the tomatoes it would have been a perfect balance though. If you don't know what a pizookie is, it is a freshly baked cookie (a big one) in a still-hot cookie pan with ice cream. So, in other words, heaven in your mouth. Pizookie recommendation: half Oreo half chocolate chip. Beer selection is extensive, as well as other drinks. We opted for BJs brew, I had a blonde bock and it was delish!"
Brewster B.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",11,9,2,4.0,8/2/2010,We eat there a least once a month. The hamburgers are large and VERY yummy. We (my wife and I) share one and also usually also order a salad (which is also large) that we share. Have never been disappointed and will continue to go back. Very friendly wait staff.
Wayne L.,"West Sacramento, CA",20,105,14,3.0,12/16/2011,I had the jalapeno burger which was pretty good... not real special just good.  The service was excellent and the staff very courteous.
Rachel S.,"Granite Bay, CA",0,4,,5.0,5/21/2014,"I had a great dining experience at this BJs. The service was some of the best I've received in a long time, and the food was exceptional. Definitely have to say that our waitress Courtney deserves recognition. She is friendly, genuine, attentive and an all around great waitress. I will definitely be revisiting this location!"
