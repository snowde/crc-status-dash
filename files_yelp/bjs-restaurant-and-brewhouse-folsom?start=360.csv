Kamy Y.,"Folsom, CA",0,2,,4.0,6/5/2011,I had the chicken Marsala and Caesar salad and strawberry lemonade. The food was good. we waited a tad much for the food to arrive but our waitress was courteous and patient and answered all our questions to our satisfaction. I like this place in general and like to go there any chance i get.
Felisha R.,"Folsom, CA",10,16,1,4.0,1/3/2012,"Great place to go with family and friends. Sometimes you may get a waiter thats slacking and wait 40 mins for your food. Also noticed the last few times I've went they don't leave your pizza in that deep dish pan anymore. It doesnt taste the same, so if your a fan of their pizzas, you might want to rethink and just go for something else. They have plenty of food to pick from along with a full bar."
Steve R.,"Carmichael, CA",16,164,83,4.0,6/29/2011,"I really only like to come here for happy hour. M-F 3-7. Their mini pizzas are half off, appetizers are $2 off, and $1 off drinks. There regular menu is good too, but the happy hour menu is to good to pay full price. I normally get a pepperoni mini pizza, and a salad. Sometimes Ill get another mini to go since there so cheap. The only down side to eating happy hour is theres not many tables available, so if you want to get a seat u have to stand around and wait for someone to get up. They also brew their own beer. I recommend the hefeweizen. I got a keg of it a couple years ago for my wifes b-day. It was only like $100 and its the best hefeweizen ive ever had. Its my favorite beer by far!"
Heidi P.,"Placerville, CA",129,112,10,3.0,1/18/2009,"This place is just OK. My husband took me here because we were in Folsom and I wanted a Dirty Martini. Since the kids were with us we thought we could get them some fries while the hubby had a beer and I sipped my Martini.  Well my dirty martini wasn't made right. They forgot to make it dirty! That was a bummer. The waitress never came back to ask us how things were so I couldn't get it made right.  My 19 month old ended up throwing his fries at the nice people sitting next to us. After two sips of my martini I had to whisk him out of there. My husband and five year old enjoyed the rest of the fries, some pot stickers, my husband his beer, and the rest of my martini. Not BJs fault the chimp misbehaved, but If I only have time for one gulp of my martini I would have liked it make correctly  When am I going to learn that its not worth taking my monkey to a Restaurant yet. Not even for a quick drink and some fries."
Traci B.,"Folsom, CA",11,15,16,3.0,1/25/2012,Great food for good price! Great for date night or just girls night out
Mackenzie K.,"McKinney, TX",381,66,100,2.0,2/17/2011,"Iv dined here many times.  Great staff and always happy to be working.  Gets crowded when there are sports games on. Loud as well.  Also recently ordered take out.  Tried to suprise my girlfriend with BJ's famous ""Pazookie"" and her favorite ""Field of Greens salad.  Showed up there did not have to wait long.  when I got home to my disapointment Everything was there that I ordered but they forgot the ICE CREAM! So i paid $5 for a cookie.  I felt that the staff got lazy and didnt double check my order like responsible staff should. It wasnt busy at all so I dont think there is any excuse for them forgetting it.  All in all its just ice cream but was really upsey because I LOVE my ICE CREAM!"
Tammy S.,"Folsom, CA",343,603,172,3.0,9/18/2011,"I like BJ's a lot! I am a big fan of the Roseville location and while it may be a bit smaller, the Folsom location is almost it's identical twin! The service is generally fair, the food is very good - and I love how diverse the selection is. It's one of those places that no matter who you bring here, I would wager that most anyone can find something on the menu that they are going to like. We came here on a Saturday night, it was fairly busy but we were sat immediately. We ordered an appetizer and two entrees. The food came really quickly and was good. One complaint: we had to wait for refills on our iced teas several times... even though we invited her to leave behind a pitcher of iced tea... OK, we more than invited, we ASKED her to leave a pitcher behind but she said she wasn't allowed. What? That's just silly. That is the first time I have ever heard of such a ridiculous rule. She was nice about it, but it's still silly. Other than that little misstep, it was good and I would certainly come back!"
Terri V.,"Manhattan, NY",159,277,13,2.0,5/12/2011,"Large bar with expansive dining area. Hustle, bustle and loud. House salad with uncrisp lettuce and afterward the BJ's Classic Combo deep dish pizza with mushrooms, pepperoni and sausage. Once I made it through the tasteless crust, I jaunted through the ""Seasoned Tomatoes"" topping fresh out of the Hunt's stewed tomatoes with herbs can.  Yuk. Yuk and Yuk. The 2 stars are for the friendly bartender, the hostess, waitress and our pre-dinner house margarita."
J C.,"Orangevale, CA",0,3,,5.0,4/24/2014,Very good food and service I eat here once every month my favorite is jambalaya use your reward card worth it
Nicki D.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",0,19,,4.0,12/27/2013,"I have only been here once but would definitely go back.  My husband and I went for lunch on a Saturday and the restaurant was super busy.  The menu is huge with a ton to choose from.  We went for a salmon dish and a rib dish with Caesar salads.  We don't like a Caesar salad with a fishy dressing and this was not so we gave the Caesar Salads 2 thumbs up.  The ribs were cooked perfectly as was my salmon.  We didn't realize that the ribs came with a baked potato and the salmon with rice.  So me and my husband just switched since he prefers the rice and I prefer the potato.  We then got the cookie desert that they are known for.  I am not much for desert but this was good.  I think we ordered the orea cookie dough one.  At any rate the two salads, two entrees and 1 desert with a couple of sodas came out to under $50 and the food was tasty.  Yummy.  Good food, good prices and a nice atmosphere."
Bill P.,"Folsom, CA",0,4,,2.0,3/6/2014,"Food was good, service was terrible with a capital T! BJ's doesn't seem to get that a restaurant is only good if it provides BOTH good food and good service. After getting our drinks, it was another 10-15 minutes before our server reappeared and took our order, despite being obviously ready to order to anyone observing, with our menus closed, searching in vain for our server, any server. After finishing our meal, which was good as expected, we ordered dessert... big mistake. True story - it took them nearly twenty minutes to bring one dessert, and ten minutes to get our check, with our server nowhere in sight. And the problem wasn't a busy restaurant, as there were many vacant tables. We enjoyed the food, it was great, but we won't be coming back due to the horrible service."
Eugenia G.,"San Francisco, CA",30,196,30,4.0,1/23/2011,"BJ's is BJ's is BJ's. Nothing is really different in terms of the food except for the service. This review is solely on my latest experience on 1/22/11 where I came in to order some pizookie to go. The girl working at the to-go counter was absolutely AWESOME. Too bad I didn't catch her name. I should have asked to speak to her manager because she was very thorough and not to mention very people-friendly. She would make an awesome server. (If you ever read this, keep up the positive attitude and everything else!) Anyway, the pizookie is just a pizookie. Of course, it's best to eat it in-house because its nice and warm, but we didn't want to wait around for a table to open up."
Ryan M.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",1,15,5,4.0,1/1/2014,The food here is great! It always comes out tasty and fresh! However serving size seems to change drastically from visit to visit and once in a blue moon you get a waiter who takes FOREVER even when they have one other table. Ask for Brandon! He'll take care of you like family!
Lezli D.,"Roseville, CA",2,63,,4.0,10/1/2011,I went there yesterday for lunch and had the grilled ham and cheese with tomato bisque soup.  It was the BEST lunch item I've had and super inexpensive...love that!  They also have SUPERIOR avocado egg roles; they're better than any other restaurants!  Oh yeah!
Phillip D.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",70,37,19,3.0,6/6/2009,"We had dinner here to celebrate my brother's birthday. The service here was okay.  The hostess and waiter did their job, but I can't compliment them on incredible customer service.  They were definitely friendly, but I've been to restaurants where the hostess and waiter/waitress provided excellent service - smiles on their faces and wanted to make sure we had a great experience...   As for the food, we ordered a large BJ Favorite pizza.  The pizza was ok.  A little too salty for me.  There weren't that many toppings on our pizza, so it was more like eating the dough.  I love pizzas where they pile on the toppings...  That was not the case with ours. Ok place to eat.  Nothing stands out for me..."
R. A.,"Monterey, CA",3,72,1,2.0,5/26/2011,"I usually have bad service here, I think everyone's just too busy , so we wont be going here anymore"
Egnalag E.,"Shingle Springs, CA",18,21,,5.0,2/16/2014,"I just love BJ'S restaurant in Folsom. The food is always great, service is top notch and atmosphere is noisy but alive and fun. From the front desk staff to the food servers and waiters you have very clean and professional staff. Never have been disappointed. Mandy at the front desk always makes sure we get seated quickly and in the section of our favorite waiter."
Matthew L.,"Camino, CA",9,3,,2.0,10/30/2011,"expect to spend 3 hours there on a weekend, even when you call ahead with a birthday reservation...  its also AWESOME that women with half there ""privates"" hanging out can get seated before us with no reservation???     might have had 5 starts if i had worn a see through mini skirt.."
E T.,"Folsom, CA",0,4,,2.0,12/20/2012,"Looking for a family-friendly place to go out in Folsom, we did not have a good experience here. It was our first time to this location and next time we will def go somewhere else in Folsom. There was just everything wrong with the service. The waiter I think was trying his  best, but there were problems everywhere with our food: we waited way too long for the food and then later a very long time for the pizookie and our kids were miserable. It was not crowded. They got our orders wrong and forgot our drinks. When we were waiting for the check to return (which took a long time) and to just get out of there, a new server came by and started serving us someone else's starter soups! Not to mention the pizza was actually cold in the center. There clearly was some disconnect between the table and the kitchen. Their redeeming qualities remain the fabulous pizookie and beer selection."
Kristina G.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",38,22,1,5.0,7/26/2011,I've eaten there many times. The food and service is always consistently good. Tomato bisque is to die for!!!!
