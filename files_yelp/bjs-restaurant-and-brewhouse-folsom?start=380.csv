Laura W.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",7,24,8,5.0,7/19/2011,"Great Bloody Mary's, and I love the flatbread sausage and tomato pizza. Love the ambience. The girls from work and I go there for cocktails after work every once in a while, and the menu is great because of the wide variety. Price is worh it. Good food is worth paying for."
Kathy S.,"Placerville, CA",0,25,2,5.0,7/13/2011,"I always have fantastic service there.  Huge variety of delicious foods. Chicken, pasta, seafood, sandwiches.......amazing appetizers. And large portions, good prices. Love the Jeremiah Red beer- one of a large selection.  And it's the best pizza around. I love the Mediterranean with feta, kalmata olives, chicken, pesto & pepperocinis. My kids love the Bacon Cheeseburger pizza."
John D.,"Shingle Springs, CA",43,17,25,2.0,5/12/2009,This is a decent place to eat.  I am not a huge fan.  Service could really use an overhaul.  Food is ok.  Nothing jumps out at me.  I was pleasantly surprised with my sandwich. I would only bring friends here if they insisted.  To me it is like Applebees.  Not my favorite.  I would rather eat at Denny's for the price.
Ann B.,"Placerville, CA",0,103,,4.0,2/11/2012,"The most extensive menu I think I've seen, the amount of choices are almost overwhelming. Staff is pleasant, but the place can get loud when there's a full on lunch or dinner crowd. Burgers and sandwhiches are good, but the pizza is killer. The crust is among the tops I've ever had, but it really doesn't hold over well for left overs, so it's quality is best if you eat it hot while still at the restaurant. We'll probably go less often now that Panera is open, but BJ's has never disappointed us and we'll still pop in every now and again."
Tamara C.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",0,11,,4.0,6/11/2011,"We've been to BJ's several times.  On our first visit we had pizza...it was great!  We also had the pizookie for dinner.  What a perfect dish to satisfy my sweet tooth.  It's my favorite dessert ever, although I can see how it might be too sweet for those with more discerning palates.  Unfortunately, on our second visit, I had the salmon.  I LOVE salmon, but I had three bites and the flavor was funky!  It was so horrible that I had to send it back.  I wasn't brave enough to try it again, and ordered a salad that ended up being very average.  My husband ordered the fish and chips, and found that dish to be very average, too.  When visiting BJs in the future, we'll stick with pizza and the pizookie."
Roland H.,"San Ramon, CA",0,13,,4.0,8/17/2013,Great burger + Caesar salad + beer.  Folsom BJ's is a lot better than Dublin BJ's.
L. M.,"Orangevale, CA",0,2,,4.0,1/4/2012,Reliably good food and they take care of customers.  One of our dish orders got mixed up.  Hostess was very good about it and made sure correct dish was served and then gave us the item for free!   Have always enjoyed this Bj's.  Sometimes crowded but the food is always good.  This is the place for hearty meals!
Krismet C.,"San Francisco, CA",26,143,2,1.0,4/23/2007,"First- it's called BJ's, which correct me if I'm wrong, is short for blow job. It took an hour to read the novella they call the menu. I ordered a simple baked potato and it came out wrong.  If I hadn't been scared for my life by the server who was so obviously high on whatever wacky crack they cook up out there from cough syrup and oven cleaner, I would not have left a tip at all."
M C.,"Hillsboro, OR",1,47,7,4.0,4/26/2011,"This place has a massive menu! I've only tried a handful of things so far, but I haven't had a bad meal. Their pizza is really good, as is their home made root beer!"
Jeff K.,"Sacramento, CA",4,149,,2.0,12/19/2012,"This B.J.'s, hands down, is probably the worst location in this large chain. The problem here revolves around the service, or lack thereof. More about my experience, but while waiting for our waiter to show up I observed: 1. Waitress at the next table lost half of the steak fries on the floor and completely ignoring the fact by serving the dish anyway. 2. Another young waitress bringing a house salad and nachos to our table when we hadn't even ordered. 3. Wait staff standing around looking completely flustered and lost. As for our meal, it wasn't much better....dirty silverware, luke warm soup that was poured into a bowl from a small silver urn (huh?), and a house salad (that we did actually order) drowning and wilting in ranch dressing. My Jalapeno Burger was bland and woefully overcooked and burnt on the edges, and our food was brought to us by not the server who took our order, but by three different servers who magically appeared out of nowhere complete with lousy attitudes. Oh well, this just goes down as another in a long string of underachieving restaurants in the hamlet of Folsom."
Tanisha B.,"Sacramento, CA",269,173,66,2.0,2/16/2010,"Went here with a couple friends.  I ordered the brocolli cheddar soup and salad, with garlic dressing.  We ordered potstickers as an appitizer.  They were comped, as we got our food and still hadn't received the apps.  The food was alright, my salad looked like the stuff out of the bag and I had dressing in one glob on the side of my plate.  The waitress was nice, but really slow and forgetfull.  She brought back the credit cards, but didn't bring the receipts to sign.  Um, ok.  I've been here during the day and I think that's the only time I'll come back to this BJ's, the night service was slipping."
Nicolas S.,"Sacramento, CA",15,56,,4.0,10/26/2010,"I didn't want to like this place, but met up with friends there for a few samplers, pizzas and brews. The food was solid California pub-style, the beers were good, and most importantly for this kind of place, the wait staff was upbeat and helpful. Certainly more than I expected; good spot to hang with some friends."
Silviu N.,"Houston, TX",9,88,5,2.0,7/13/2008,"Prepare to age a few minutes waiting for a seat at BJ's.  It's the wait that makes your expectations go up, thinking to yourself ""This many people can't be wrong!""      They are and they were, for me.  I do like their  baked potatoes.. they're HUGE.  And the appetizers and finger foods are also good, considering that it's still technically junk food. Other dishes, I haven't touched because of the price point. I can't justify paying to much, when the menu does not convince.  The array of beers is a nice touch; but if you don't drink alcohol, your options are slender.  Depending on where you sit, you may be seated uncomfortably close to the person next to you. It's crowded, pushy and packed."
Phil F.,"Placerville, CA",0,9,,4.0,7/5/2013,"I don't usually eat at chain restaurants preferring to eat at smaller more unique eateries but I like BJ's. I like the Asian chicken salad and the pizza is good. Last time I went my date had the tilapia and it was very good. They have a well stocked bar and a good selection of beer if that's your thing. It has a kind of generic feel but still nice enough to take a date. On the down side the wait staff are very over-attentive, interrupting the meal over and over and over to ask if everything is okay. It gets very annoying and on my last visit, even though they were so over-attentive they failed to bring silverware with our meal and we had to ask. Kind of a small gripe so I still give it four stars."
KW R.,"Folsom, CA",0,40,9,1.0,6/15/2010,"I can't believe people in the Sac region are so dumbed-down they think this ""food"" is acceptable let alone give it 4 or 5 stars.  I guess when you are weaned from birth on deep fried salted processed crap served to you by an 18 yo with tattoos and hurried along to finish your ""meal"".. you may think this place is great. I had no choice eating here.  I had a work function and the organizers chose this place.  OMG I needed about 5 gallons of water after I rolled myself out of this place.  I had pulled pork sandwich and the mini mac and cheese.  So full of salt I felt sick for the rest of the night.  Seriously, stop giving these hideous chain restaurants with heart-attack food your money and learn to appreciate real food.  How about trying some food cooked by a REAL, trained CHEF not an illegal immigrant with no cooking skills, just shown how to dump frozen crap into a deep fryer and achieve the closest-to-acceptable shade of brown fried color. I always wonder if the same people who like these sort of places also DON'T KNOW HOW TO COOK anything that does not come from a box or freezer!!!"
JJ B.,"Sacramento, CA",29,139,3,4.0,8/11/2008,"Yesterday was the second time around for good ol Bj's. The first was in Roseville, the second in Folsom. Both times, were pretty good, I must say!   My friend and I walked in around 4:00 and the place wasn't too busy, we were seated right away and our server was great! We both ordered the veggie burgers and they were flavorful, large in portion size and it came with fries or a salad. We tried the Pear Ale and it was really good, too!  Price wise, pretty average similar to Chili's.   So with all that being said, Bj's has my vote for good place to go when you want all american kind of food!"
Dianne H.,"Placerville, CA",2,23,,1.0,5/4/2012,"Went there with a friend and chose the half baked potatoe and salad. Well let me tell you first of all it says it is half of their giant baked potato. I've seen their giant baked potato and what I got was not even close to ""half"" of that. In fact it was a half of a medium potato, flat as a pancake and not fluffy like a baked potato should be, that told me that it was probably left over from the night before or had been sitting in a warming oven for some time. Okay, next--I ordered it with sour cream and butter and the waitress said well for a few dollars more you can get cheese and bacon on it. The bacon consisted of about 4 chopped up pieces and the cheese was like yellow gooey glue, not in the least bit appetizing. The salad was your garden variety ""pale leaf"" lettuce with a few sliced tomatoes and not much else. Iced tea $2.75. Lunch with tip ended up costing $15.00, a far cry from the $5.95 that I had intended to spend. Well not  their fault as they did not force me to order the iced tea. It could have been so good had the potato really been ""half"" of their ""giant"" one and if it had been fluffy and had not had a glutenous mess of cheese on it. I have been to the BJ's in Elk Grove, what a difference as that one in Elk Grove served up this same dish wonderfully. Oh well, guess next time I will make the trip (extra miles) and  go to the one there. This is the 3rd bad experience that I have had at BJ's in Folsom."
Derek B.,"Grass Valley, CA",42,24,1,5.0,1/2/2011,"I love BJs!  This place is always busy....so that should say it all.  A HUGE menu to choose from with lots of seating in a sort of ""family but still sports bar"" atmosphere.  We ahve always gotten really good service and if you are into eating quick (when you have kids) they don't seem to disappoint."
Randall S.,"Corpus Christi, TX",127,137,,5.0,8/10/2010,"I give this place such a high rating mainly for their Pizza's. I honestly believe that they have some of the best pizza's in the area. The alfredo sauce with grilled chicken is delicious, as is the buffalo chicken pizza which is my personal favorite. This place is great when it comes to pizza, but as far as everything else goes, well I really wouldn't know since I always order Pizza."
Bob S.,"Plymouth, CA",0,68,,4.0,1/23/2010,"BJs is BJs.  Any place named after my favorite sexual favor (receiving, NOT giving, you dumbasses!!) is all right by me.  The food is not the reason to come here.  You go to BJs to look and be looked at.  There are usually ample hotties around, including various members of the wait staff.  TVs from bar to ceiling during football and hockey season are awesome!  Their Sweet Pig pizza is to die for as is the infamous Pizookie! I once got a BJ in the parking lot behind this location.  Is that ironic?  I think it's appropriate. I've never had bad service at any BJs location.  Good enough food and great lively atmosphere is reason enough to keep coming back."
