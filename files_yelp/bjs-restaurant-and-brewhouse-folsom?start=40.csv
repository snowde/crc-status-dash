Cassie B.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",15,47,39,5.0,12/28/2016,"Went a little out of the way to give BJs another try because an awful experience at another location. Our server Alexandra was on top of of her stuff! She gave great service, didn't feel too rushed or neglected. She kept a smile on her face, kept our glasses full, and walked us through the holiday specials. I go out to eat often and would consider myself to be a tough critic. 5 stars easily, I would drive the extra distance to return here and get this great service again."
David T.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",46,15,16,2.0,1/29/2017,"We came here for my friends birthday on 01/19/17 and the server was nice, but very non attentive to our table. So we ordered the margarita flat bread pizza and to be honest, it was not worth the price and it tasted bland, had better pizza elsewhere. Also, my friend order parmesan chicken which tasted like it was frozen and it wasn't that hot more like room temperature. The only saving grace was the pazookie, which was the best the of night. Got the oreo, macadamian nut and salted caramel. If I had a choice I wouldn't come back here, but maybe I'll give it a chance next next time."
Jeff B.,"Carmichael, CA",14,22,6,2.0,9/9/2017,"I have been to BJ's in Nevada, Sacramento,  San Rafael, Folsom and the food has been great. However the Folsom location on Bidwell St has some serious issues with the staff. We put our name on the wait list through the app. And when we entered the restaurant we waited for about 5 min while the manager and 5 of the wait staff clustered around a computer station away from the door. They had no one paying attention to arriving guests. Finally we made our way over to the cluster of wait staff and they found us on the list. We moved back by the door and they started to seat people who arrived after us. Went back to the cluster of wait staff and now they could not find us on the list. Finally they did seat us. During this time no one paid any attention to the arriving guests. Seems like they were just in their own bubble. Then we had a coupon for a free desert. The waitress said that looks like a small one. My wife said the coupon does not specify a size. She then said she will have a manager come to talk to us. He never came and after a long wait she brought the dessert. I would expect this during a soft open not from an established chain. BJs if you are listening please wake up your Folsom staff. They really need instruction in how to interact with guests."
Congjing Z.,"Sunnyvale, CA",155,75,390,3.0,4/10/2016,"Dropped by here for a quick bite. The restaurant is very clean and the staffs are super friendly. To start off, I ordered the fried calamari. It's very well fried and seasoned. Great choice for appetizer. It's the only reason I'm giving it a 3 instead of 1 star.  Entree: hickory burger and shrimp and asparagus penne. The burger is average, abit over salted. The fries are not crunchy, but taste alright. Shrimp asparagus penne tastes like it was made by a college student. The shrimp isn't fresh, sauce tastes like canned food, and the pasta itself was over cooked."
Brookie W.,"Kailua-Kona, HI",184,1,,4.0,7/16/2017,Went on a little late minute dinner date here on a Sunday night. First impressions where mediocre due to the hostess skipping us in line for some one else. I ordered the avocado spring roles which where good but the pastry rap tasted a bit to sweet in my opinion. For the main corse I ordered the lemon thyme chicken which was better than expected. My Date ordered the chicka avocado club which was truly enjoyed.  When all is said and done service is alright. Food is pretty good but not fabulous. I would return in the future.
Michael W.,"Sacramento, CA",13,26,8,1.0,4/2/2017,"Wow, this place has really taken a dive. This used to be an awesome place, but the service has gotten really bad and the food is just gross now. What happened!? I'm sorry guys, I used to love your menu and beers, now I just don't feel the love at BJs in Folsom, what did you do??!"
Melissa P.,"Seattle, WA",575,132,113,5.0,9/10/2016,"I CANT SAY ENOUGH GOOD THINGS ABOUT THIS PLACE!  Today I came for dinner and the cooks accidentally gave our pizza to the wrong table (an honest mistake) and us the incorrect pizza as well! We ended up waiting another 15 mins for our pizza but the waitress and current manager, J.R were sooo awesome and kind about the mixup. They offered our entire table appetizers or salads to eat in the mean time that would all be free, and also gave us our pizza on the house! I'm really impressed with their customer service, it's great. Always a solid time at BJS! I basically live here and come 3 times a week to this location for a reason, they're simply the best duh!"
Nicole K.,"San Jose, CA",204,90,428,3.0,6/3/2016,"I Came here to have drinks and a light dinner.  Service was decent could've been better. The bar was only half-full & it took a while to get our server to give us menus & take our drink order. We were in the bar area. I ordered the housemaid root beer and my friend ordered one of the signature cocktails on the cocktail menu. For dinner she ordered the buffalo style boneless wings and I ordered a mini pepperoni pizza and a Caesar salad. The food came out hot, that was a plus :-) made up for the lack of service prior to getting the food. The atmosphere was fine and inviting and it was very clean. I would definitely come back again but probably sit in a different area where more servers are available. The bar area seems to not have enough servers only the bartender behind The bar and one or two that walk around and help when you're not at their tables."
Kathleen D.,"Sutter Creek, CA",13,90,234,3.0,12/9/2016,"Took a break from shopping to have lunch.   The beer was great, the food was wonderful.  The service...not so good."
Hannah S.,"Incline Village, NV",2,11,5,5.0,1/7/2017,"Had the best waitress yesterday when my family and I went to bjs Folsom for lunch. Jennifer p. Was the nicest waitress I've ever had! She got our orders perfectly, food was amazing and she even sent out a kid started for our hungry two little ones. Best service from Jennifer ! She made the lunch even better . Had to write a review on how great she did! Will be coming to bjs more often!"
Darin T.,"Scottsdale, AZ",47,199,56,3.0,5/7/2016,"It's a chain so service and quality is hit and miss but overall I'm a fan of BJ's. Good variety on the menu, good happy hour specials on drinks and appetizers, and best of all, the pizookies. You can't leave without it so save room. Our favorite is the salted caramel, or the trio!!!"
Daffodil L.,"San Francisco, CA",12,79,93,3.0,3/27/2016,"Lunch Seared Ahi Tuna Salad which was delicious but just wayyy too expensive for what you get! Probably ~4 slices of seared tuna atop a bed of mixed greens, picked cucumbers, sliced red pepper, wonton crisps, and some dollops of wasabi on the side.  Everything was very fresh and if you're on a diet, I found the salad perfectly edible without even adding the vinaigrette dressing. The pickled cucumbers were especially tasty. As a warning, the wasabi scoops are on the perimeter of the plate, and take it from me, you do *not* want to spoon up a whole wasabi scoop accidentally...  But in the end, I paid $15 + tax + tip at lunch for mostly salad with a measly portion of fish. If it were up to me, would not come back because the value for cost is just plainly lacking."
tim h.,"Seaside, CA",48,80,52,5.0,5/26/2017,"Excellent meal, great service, try their draft Soda menu has so many items and food was outstanding"
Angie F.,"Napa, CA",68,6,3,1.0,10/8/2016,I'd give this place no stars if it would let me. WORST SERVICE EVER!!!! The food was disgusting with brown lettuce in my salad. NEVER AGAIN
Luis S.,"Sacramento, CA",75,11,,2.0,7/14/2017,Bj's is such a generic place. I have tried many dishes. They do not know how to cook steak. This place is just overpriced because drunk people don't care what they eat. Pizza was ok. However their best and the only reason I go there is for their piezookie. Other than that I strongly do not recommend. Chick Fila A is across the street go there.
Vitaliy A.,"Roseville, CA",27,91,278,5.0,4/16/2017,"Pretty good place go to, especially if you like pizza! It's a little loud, but not bad at all. The service is good as well."
Atlanta B.,"Upper Lake, CA",64,12,12,5.0,6/18/2017,"Awesome way to kick off Father's Day! We had an awesome experience Saturday night! Even though they don't take reservations, we found out you can do a call ahead about 30 minutes before arrival. Which was SO nice, especially when you have a rambunctious toddler! We were greeted by our server Kaley and she presented my husband with a really nice Father's Day drinking glass souvenir, and stuffed inside was a gift card...whattt?! Thank you!! Service was incredible. We were convinced our server had three clones of herself lol! My husband's ice tea didn't even hit the table and she already had another one waiting for him. Food was excellent as well. Even our picky toddler was happy! Thanks again for the experience! We will be back!!"
David C.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,5,,4.0,6/12/2017,"My steak, asparagus, and mashed potatoes were fantastic. The Pizooki was even better. However, the Caesar salad fell short of par pretty badly.  Great staff and not overly cramped dining area."
Mike D.,"Long Beach, CA",23,20,40,5.0,6/7/2016,The bartender Tyler is the real deal!  He has the best attitude and makes sure you're taken care of. Absolutely amazing service! He's the man!  A bartender/server like Tyler will change your whole experience in the most positive way! People like that can truly drive business into the restaurant!  Very hard working young man right there! I have nothing but respect for him! Keep doing your thing bro!
Linda M.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",0,11,4,2.0,6/5/2017,"I've struggled with writing this review.   We want to like this place, but it's sooo hard!  They have so many things going for it, and when they get it right, it's very very good. First, if you like having ""drinks"" with your meal, good luck.  We've experienced nothing but inconsistent serves.  So much so, we don't know what to expect anymore.  We were once served a double in the same size glass as a single at the same sitting.  When confronted, the server (and manager) tried to explain it off by saying it was due to the amount of ice in the glass!  lol...  I don't know why they're so funky about alcohol serves, but they are.  If this is important to you, don't hold your breath. Second, food delivery is a big problem.  Do not order your appetizers with your mains.  For sure, you will get them all at the same time - no matter if you ask your server not to serve them together.  You're only hope is to order them separately (if you want them separately). Lastly, it is all but guaranteed someone at your table is going to get served cold food.  I know and appreciate that it can be a challenge to coordinate everyone's meal to come up at the same time, but it seems they have given up trying long ago.  Doesn't matter if your group is large or small, someone is going to get the short end of the stick.  Hot french fries??????  We let that expectation go, long ago. Basically, if you get the proper BJ's experience, you're lucky!  When you do, it's enough to make you keep trying."
