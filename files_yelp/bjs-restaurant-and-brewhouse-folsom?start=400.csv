David S.,"Sacramento, CA",115,67,5,2.0,8/15/2010,"The menu has too many items, the lobby /bar/restaurant is always crowded and the food is a 2 at best. I do not know why this is such a popular eatery in Folsom. There are so many better places to get a beer, pizza or sandwich.  The restaurant is always very loud and it is hard to have a conversation in the building. I ordered a pizza (with no cheese) and it came out very doughy- and I was told that was normal? Really? Raw pizza dough? I am not basing this on one visit- I have never had a positive experience at BJ's."
Mark S.,"Chapel Hill, NC",22,70,17,4.0,1/9/2010,"Just stopped here passing through the 80. Food was very good (pizza great, salad good). Lots of interesting and varied menu items. Ambiance, open and ""new sporty generic"" but decent. Lots of massive TV's with sports. Beers overall were very good. Tried the sampler of 6 and not a bad one in the bunch for me.The Kolch was definitely my favorite.  Service was great, prices fair. Would go back and recommend. Not quite Pyramid, but good for a chain brewery."
Darryl W.,"Sloughhouse, CA",15,12,,1.0,2/21/2011,"I was very disappointed my last visit on a Sunday evening.  I have frequented BJ's in Folsom at least 20 times and this last visit was next to pathetic!  The beer now arrives in smaller beer glasses vs. the pints.  ( not speaking of their samples of beer) I asked the waitress if the fish was deep fried and she assured me the fish would be grilled for my tacos and my wife asked to hold the meat on her Sante Fe salad and low and behold quite the contrary.. I had a deep fried cheese stick shaped fish in my tacos and my wife had a glob of chicken on her salad... Total wait... 1 hour and 45"" for our dinner to be edible.  The manager came to our table to check on us and took off the chips and salsa off our bill.  We will never ever go back to BJ's!  Good for pizza and beer.. Keep it simple...they are not even consistent."
Raj M.,"Milpitas, CA",7,171,,3.0,2/24/2008,"Okay, I gave them another shot and the food here is pretty good.   They don't take a lot of risks, it's mostly burgers, salads, pizza, fried bar food, but nothing is horrible and it's way better than applebees, chili's etc (although that's not saying much).   It's a safe bet when you want something simple. ____________________________________________________ They deliver to the hotel we were staying at so we ordered in after work one night.  I got a burger and fries and asked for extra ketchup on the side since I can't eat a burger or fries without ketchup.   The order comes and there is  no ketchup, let alone extra ketchup... not even some catsup.  My wife got a salmon cesar salad and liked it alot.  I ended up eating about 3 bites of the burger and a couple of fries.   Who serves a burger and fries without ketchup? Good thing I had bought those girl scout cookies earlier."
Bob M.,"Folsom, CA",0,12,,1.0,4/29/2013,"The Hostess was rude from the word go.  We were there with our 4 grandchildren, no one else in line and all we wanted was a large booth, afterall there were 7 of us total.  No they tried to put us at a table way in the back, not a large booth in the front.  When we complained they told us the large booth was reserved.....THEY DON""T ACCEPT RESERVATIONS.  If you don't want our business...just tell me."
tonya d.,"Jackson, CA",0,8,,1.0,4/7/2013,If I could give it no stars I would. horrible service. we waited 15 minutes to be served and yet there was no one in the restaurant
Lynette M.,"Folsom, CA",6,11,,3.0,8/29/2008,"I've been to BJ's a bunch of times - with friends, with family, with co-workers.  I want to give this restaurant a great rating but my biggest peeve with the place is that it's LOUD. What?  Did you say your monkey's got a cold? Even sitting right next to my friend the other night, I still couldn't hear half the conversation.  And forget it if you're at the other end of the table. The food is pretty good, actually.  A little overpriced but the portions are generous.  My favorite item is the Basil and Sausage appetizer pizza.  Perfectly sized for one and you don't feel super-stuffed.  Split it with a friend, pair it with a small salad and a glass of pinot grigio and voila! - lunch. Just try to get a table as far away as possible from everyone else.  Definitely not in the middle of the main dining room which was where we were the other night."
Jenn B.,"Fair Oaks, CA",2,25,,4.0,10/20/2010,"Always fantastic food when I eat here.  Always busy, which stinks, but the food is always worth the wait.  Excellent clam chowder, and of course, if you go, you MUST order a Pazooki!"
Marie W.,"Santa Monica, CA",82,140,10,4.0,10/8/2009,"The happy hour here is great.  I pretty much always come here to sit in the bar because if you come early (4-7 I think) you can get a discount on beer, cocktails, appetizers and half off the mini pizzas and really how can you go wrong with that? This last time I went I ordered the Mediterranean mini pizza sans the kalamata olives, and the CA club flat bread pizza to share with my boyfriend.  Also we both got beers, I got the blonde and he got the octoberfest.   The pizzas were great.  The CA club I feel needs a little more sauce or something so both times I have ordered it I have gotten ranch to dip it in, only to realize this last time blue cheese dressing would have been so much better!  The mediterranean pizza and really good, I love the combo of the chicken, feta, tomatoes, and pepperchinis.  As for beers, I like the blonde and I really loved the nit-wit but that was their summer special beer so now it is gone :(.  My boyfriend wasnt too big of a fan of the octoberfest, we both agreed that it was missing something flavorwise. And ultimately you cannot go wrong with any of the pizookies, they are amazing and wonderful!"
Ricky D.,"Sacramento, CA",6,50,,5.0,11/7/2008,"I love the ambrosia (dunno about the spelling) drink and the spicy spaghetti. Its my favorite.  The beers they brew are pretty decent too.. I do agree with others about the wait. Its long, but its worth it to me."
Emily B.,"Fair Oaks, CA",106,25,54,2.0,3/3/2012,"We went to the Folsom BJ's for a work-related celebration lunch. We called ahead (days in advance), advising we'd have a group of 12. We were seated immediately, but then the waiting began. We waited a half-hour for them to take our order (knowing we were on our lunch ""hour""). By the time our first-course types of meals (soups, salads) were on the table, we'd been there a full hour. The main courses arrived and it was mediocre at best. One coworker's sandwich didn't have any cheese (and it was a melt!), another coworker's hamburger was missing the bacon, and yet another coworker got her clam chowder but the server never returned with a spoon after advising her he'd accidentally dropped it on the way to our table. My drink never got refilled, and the server didn't ask what kind of fries I wanted (just brought me the shoestring fries when I actually prefer steak fries). We had to remind them a couple of times that it was a birthday celebration, and by the time they brought out the celebratory personal-sized Pizookie, we'd already paid our check and half our party had left to return to work. Overall, it was a really disappointing experience for a mid-week, group, lunch outing. We won't be going back during the workday, ever again."
Inna K.,"Folsom, CA",2,17,,4.0,2/12/2010,"I love BJs! They have great food, a good atmosphere & a great open layout. Its nice to have fish or steak & etc but im a real lover of yummy comfort food! I love pizza, burgers & fries. Im a simple gal! And BJs gives it to me. I always get the same thing, the Chicken Ceaser Sandwich & Wedge Cut Fries, they dont have it on the menu anymore, but being nice as they are, always make it for me! Its amazing! I also like their mini appetizer pizza, & their Santa Fe rolls are bomb! and their Brownie Pazookie is a must have! Im salivating already...Infact, i think ill go there tonight! :)"
Paisley M.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",0,44,,3.0,8/13/2011,"i gotta say, we went to at least 4 different BJs in the bay area & central valley and each were hands down the worst restaurant we had ever been to. after getting bored w/ all of the other establishments in the folsom area, we decided to give BJs a try. we were VERY pleasantly surprised. the food, service & atmosphere was great. we've been back since and it's been pretty consistent. the crowds are a little much and it gets pretty noisy but it's kid friendly, is a great place to watch a game & has a huge menu - plenty for everyone to choose from."
Amanda J.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",4,23,,4.0,11/5/2011,"If you've never been here, I'd say you must go just to try the Pizookies!!! My meal here is never complete with out one!"
Russel L.,"Sacramento, CA",0,3,1,4.0,8/22/2008,"BJ's Restaurant and Brewery on East Bidwell Street is an upscale sports bar.  We got there around 6 PM on a Friday night and only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table.  The staff was friendly and helpful. We ordered their nachos as an appetizer for the five of us and were pleasantly pleased by not only the size, but the taste.  I ordered one of their heffe-weizens and was reminded of sipping those heady beers in German Gausthauses while stationed there.  The only thing missing was the slice of lemon, which I stole from a friend's iced tea - she never even missed it. The menu was a little eclectic with some of everything included.  Two people ordered personal pizzas which they were pleased with and I ordered the pot roast sandwich.  Imagine a huge helping of tender pot roast beef, served open faced on bread, and topped off with mashed potatoes and gravy!  My arteries are clogging as I type this, but it was great! After the main courses were done it came time for desert but we were all so full, we decided to share.  We ordered this brownie creation topped with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, and chocolate sauce!  The brownie was warm and served in the same pan it was baked in.  As the five spoons tore through the mountain if ice cream and whipped cream, the entire thing quickly disappeared. When the bill came I was more than a little nervous but was surprised to find that it came to only $65.00 including the tip. I will be back to experience the other things on the menu, but I feel my desert will remain the same!"
Loren L.,"Antelope, CA",124,247,96,2.0,1/25/2009,"This location was just ok. The bathroom was out of supplies and when mentioned to the front desk staff they seemed less than enthused to fix it. My family had pastas which were good. I had meatloaf which started out good, but was mushy in the middle and didn't taste great. The Berry Cider is fresh and clean, the Root Beer was very good. The overall service from start to finish was disappointing. Rushed and curt or bored and disinterested was the staff we encountered. Folsom location- Wake Up!! You need to do a better job. Your other locations are way better."
Freedom F.,"Pomona, CA",3,6,,3.0,12/19/2008,"Few friends I decided to catch a late night snack at our local bj's. We arrived there and my friend stepped in a puddle of regurgitated bj's..that was our first sign it was gonna be a long night. It was Happy Hour! 1/2 off all mini pizza's, i ordered 2 Bj's favorites, my friend ordered a small bj's favorite and the other one ordered a chicken Caesar salad. Our food took a little longer than usual to arrive. My friend who ordered the salad was kindly greeted with a plate of lettuce and chicken devoid of any utensils. I'm sure that made him 2nd guess not ordering finger food. And my two mini pizza's arrived uncut...I assume they were trying a pazookie style that night.. After cutting into my pizza's with a butter knife and haphazardly enjoying my food I watched my other two friends cast their hunger into oblivion.  The bottom line: -I don't go to pizza places with my own pizza cutter so Slice my pizza please."
Jay J.,"Folsom, CA",7,41,,4.0,7/7/2013,"nice food, nice ambeince, good service... pizookie is to die for!! and so are their appetizers and entrees/pizzas"
A K.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",44,309,18,4.0,11/10/2008,ambience is good and so is the food . all the dishes i have ordered have been really good . the only thing i will like to point is that the pizza is really oily at crust ...but actually that makes it really tasty he he ...
Manny Y.,"Folsom, CA",0,11,,3.0,6/25/2011,"Good food, sometimes too busy, but overall it is a good place for casual dinning."
