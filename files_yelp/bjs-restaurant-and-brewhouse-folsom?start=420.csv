Lia H.,"Sacramento, CA",0,55,,2.0,11/11/2011,"Met my family here for early (5pm) dinner. There were 11 in our party for my sister's birthday. Told a friend I was going here and he looked BJ's up on Yelp. He loves to read the bad reviews. He did read two 4* ones. I didn't want to believe the bad bits - prefer to experience a place myself without expectations. The reviews were all accurate some good service, some bad service. The food is good but, service was very slow, and we needed to keep asking the wait staff to come back because orders were missed for entrees, drinks, dessert. The same person took our orders, but would disappear before taking all the orders. Don't know if he got distracted or ? One order was forgotten and one order was incorrect, so two in our party waited while their orders were filled, but the rest of us had our food. At least two of the hot entrees were brought cold. I said at one point, maybe the staff was busy and three people next to me all said in unision, ""No, they're not."" When it was time for dessert, one order was forgotten and took so long after we got the waiter's attention, that no one wanted to wait any longer and three of us were left sitting at the table."

Charlie P.,"Sacramento, CA",6,281,,2.0,4/14/2009,"I have been to BJ's many times and I have usually left with a desire to return.   But.....as times are getting tougher on many restaurants, their management makes a decision to cut back on quality.  This unfortunate state of mind has taken over BJ's.   I just went there for lunch today and I ordered the Cobb salad.   Normally, a Cobb salad is a standard you can count on....I have had it at BJ's in the past, and it was really good!!!   WOW....what happened?   This attempt at a Cobb salad would make most rabbits ask for their money back.   The Cobb salad consisted on flavorless shreaded lettuce out of bag, old tomatoes, cubed chicken, feta cheese and some fresh avocado.   Where was the bacon, hard boiled egg, olives, onions or anything else that would have possibly saved this nightmare.   To add insult to injury, it cost $10.95.   For that much money, I expect to be impressed by the contents of the salad....rather, I spent my time desperately seeking out pieces of chicken and avocado to try to salvage my lunch.   The atmosphere at BJ's is fun and the service personnel are friendly and efficient.   Don't stop going to BJ's, just do not order the Cobb salad unless you are trying to lose weight."
susan g.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,4,,4.0,7/22/2010,"There are so many choices and a few delectable ones.  The wait is long at times and the furniture could be more ""comfy,"" but my experiences there have mostly been good.  The Cobb salad is not the traditional type and a disappointment to me."
lynn m.,"Monterey, CA",1,27,,3.0,3/28/2010,"Great food, good drinks! Love the pazookie (sp?) went there for my friends 21st bday and we had a great time. fun place to sit and relax and could be loud and not worry.  I LOVE their pizza's. the specialty ones are a hit or miss but the good ol' fashion pepperoni is WONDERFUL. I always order a bigger size to ensure I get to take some home for leftovers."
Linds B.,"Sacramento, CA",0,21,,1.0,1/1/2012,"The service here is the horrible!  It is a shame as my husband and I use to go to this location often but after our last few visits I don't think we'll go back; today was the final straw.  We were greeted by the hostess who told us to wait at the top of the stairs. There was no one else waiting to be seated, wait staff passed by us, no one acknowledged us, another hostess joined the counter and we still stood there.  I overheard someone from the wait staff tell one of the hostesses that there was a table requesting to speak to a manager, we continued to wait, not sure what the holdup was for. About 10 minutes after we'd arrived, the second hostess told the first hostess (who had greeted us) that she should probably seat us; wow, what a concept; guess she couldn't figure that out on her own. Finally we were walked to our table.  We sat down and waited for someone to come take or order.  There were about 5 or 6 wait staff working, and we were passed by some of them several times but no one greeted us, no one even made eye contact. The restaurant was not busy, the wait staff even had time to chat with each other, however we were ignored, not even a ""be with you in a minute"". After about 15 minutes of this, and no one greeting us, never mind offer to take our order, we got up and left.  I let the hostesses know that since no one had offered to help us we'd be going somewhere else.  One just said, ""um, ok"" and the other said nothing; of course there was no apology from either of them, they were too busy straitening menus for patrons who had yet to arrive and be disappointed too.   We will not be returning to this BJs location."
Justin G.,"Sacramento, CA",2,6,,4.0,12/20/2008,"The pizza is way up there. The BJ's favorite is my personal favorite. The environment is great too, very homey sports barish. I highly recommend getting the pizookie to top off the dessert. the hours are great too."
