Lori E.,"Webster Groves, Saint Louis, MO",54,1,,5.0,11/28/2016,"While out shopping my stepmom and decided to grab a bite to eat and she suggested BJ's. I had never been but she assured me that there was a huge menu and I would definitely be able to find something I liked. She was so right! Not only did I find something, I had a hard time narrowing it down!  I finally decided on a pizza, the two people I was with getting a salad and a burger. When our food came I was really blown away by the obvious food quality. You could see (and taste!) the freshness of our food that it really usually lacking in most other places. Not only was our food great but the service was too! Our server (I can't find the receipt for her name, I'm sorry!!) was nice, polite, and attentive to all our needs despite the busy time of day (Sunday, brunch/lunch, short wait, full house) But the whole reason I came here to review is our great service started at the door. I for the life of me can't remember his name (tall, blonde ponytail, super nice!) but our host was awesome, he made great conversation on the way back to our table, and even stayed to finish our conversation after we were seated that one of my guests thought he was our server! Most places the host throws down your menus and runs away so this was a great change. Definitely give this place a try, with this quality of food and amazing service you won't be disappointed. I already looked to see if there is one back in my hometown, and success! There is! Can't wait to check it out!"
Timothy W.,"Cool, CA",34,2,,1.0,2/12/2017,"WORST service ever! This is the second time and LAST time I'm ever going here again. My table had 7 people and they messed up on 5 of those orders and were rude about fixing it. The staff is too busy gossiping about the customers to each other. It took them 25 minutes to get a bread bowl and soup out to me, by the time everyone was done I finally got my order. Don't waste your money or time here. Worst staff ever, super rude to customers and the waitress wouldn't check up on our table because she was running away, her name was Ashley and she can't do her job right at all."
Stephanie D.,"Fair Oaks, CA",56,5,3,5.0,5/5/2017,I really enjoy BJs restaurants and this one is my favorite. The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is inviting. The pizookies are too good. And I have yet to be disappointed in my meal. I look forward to going to this location and I'm pretty loyal to it too after having a bad experience at the Roseville location. This is definitely the BJs to go to!
Marcus M.,"Folsom, CA",403,266,399,2.0,12/4/2015,I'm not a huge fan of bj's but it was the only thing open so I had to do it. I'm a firm believer that bj's has average food and beer at a high price. For appetizers I ordered the southwest egg rolls which were super mini sized but the dipping sauces that accompanied them were delicious. For the main meal I ordered the Mediterranean pizza. I'm not going to lie this pizza was legit and very enjoyable. Our waitress was prompt and nice but it annoyed the CRAP out of me that she brought us the bill before asking us if we wanted to order anything else before the kitchen closes (we came 1 hour prior to closing)! I had a pizuki and another beer ready to be devoured but we were denied due to the kitchen being closed! Boooooo bad experience... once again...next time no matter what the case may be I'm forgoing on bj's and rather eat chicken nuggets from a 10 legged chicken from McDonald's.
Jan D.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",2,20,62,5.0,3/19/2017,Just ordered the New Bison Blue and Brew Burger. So yummy.! On my top five favorite burger list. Bison was delish. Tastes just like top quality beef.
John B.,"Camarillo, CA",0,5,1,1.0,5/21/2017,"In the past BJ's has been decent. Today I placed an order to go and got a salad that comes with chicken. When I got home my salad was completely meatless. I checked my receipt and they charged me for the item on their menu that includes the chicken. Very disappointed, will not return they are scamming their local customers."
Stardust N.,"Alameda, CA",41,450,272,5.0,8/10/2016,My steak was fantasic. Our waitress was friendly and the other staff was helpful. The restaurant was packed and they managed to serve our large party without a hitch.  The iced tea was good. Something I get everywhere so I can tell the fresh from the not so fresh.  The steak was cooked perfectly and they were able to accomodate my paleo diet.
David L.,"Monterey Park, CA",32,5,,1.0,9/3/2017,"I went with a party of 15 on a Saturday with a reservation.  Got seated right away.  Ordered nearly $400 of appetizers, non alcoholic drinks, salads, entrees, and desserts.  Appetizers came in an average amount of time.  Entrees came at various times.  One steak order never came.  No explanation why.  When we inquired, the waiter said they overcooked the steak and had to cook another one.  I suspect they actually forgot.  They comped a soup and salad to the starving patron.  By that time, everyone in my party finished eating.  She had to take the steak to go.  On top of that, they never refill the cups of water.  I went out several times to the bar to get water for myself and my daughter.  Even worse, when the appetizers came, there were no small plates at each seat.  When I asked for some, they didn't bring enough for everyone.  I went through several cabinets to find more.  When the bill came, they double charged us for the steak (they removed one charge when I complained).  Take it from a Berkeley MBA (I am also a physician) --- take your business elsewhere."
V N.,"Folsom, CA",0,3,4,3.0,6/25/2016,Went there tonight. Service is always good. Ribs and hamburger are great as usual; Sears Ahi Salad is flat and salty; North Beach Mahi-Mahi and Shrimp came in a pool of water and very salty; thin crust Italian Market pizza is even saltier...  Left restaurant full of water and salty food.
Joy J.,"Northern California, CA",241,337,79,4.0,1/15/2017,"Good food, INCREDIBLE menu, very pleasant friendly staff.  My only complaint is that it is noisy inside - but it it HUGE!"
Stephanie B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1,30,11,1.0,6/16/2016,"Nice server. But the pizza was horrible. Our server gave us a new one to take home so that was nice. But still, cmon BJ's... pay attention to how your food looks when it's heading out to the customers."
Carly A.,"Irvine, CA",2,148,,4.0,8/16/2016,"I've been here a countless number of times mostly because my mom loves this place. In the past (when I didn't care about my calorie intake lol) I would almost always get their pasta because it is just so good. Lately though I've been more conscious of how many calories I take in so that's where I'm grateful that they have a ""light"" section in their menu and it actually offers a lot more choices than other places I've been to. I normally order a chicken or their shrimp pasta from there but when we were there last on Sunday I decided to try one of their salads because I've never had one here before. My family and I came in on Sunday and it was beyond crowded. Despite that, our waitress was still very attentive and sweet. I forgot the name of the dish I ordered but it was a kale salad with a strawberry vinaigrette. It also came with brussel sprouts and sprinkles of grapes and blueberries. I personally wasn't a fan of the salad because kale and brussel sprouts are naturally bitter and topping that with the sour vinaigrette just didn't taste pleasant to me so I'm never going to order that again lol. The grapes and blueberries definitely offset that though, being as sweet as they were so thankfully that was on the plate. My family and I always order the wings that come with a side of buffalo sauce and ranch as appetizers and those are always super good and crispy. My mom always gets the clam chowder in a bread bowl and I always take some of that because I love how crunchy their bread is and when dipped in the soup it's sooo good (literally drooling rn).  Overall, it's always been a lovely experience here and that's why we keep coming back."
Thomas M.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",0,4,1,1.0,8/24/2017,"came in for lunch today and got alright service, food came out pretty quick, me and my girlfriend got the same plate pretty sure it was called the chicken bacon ranch paidini, but when our food came out it was all fallen apart already by the time it hit our table and not even in the wrap/piadini it was in so a total waste of what we were expecting to get, let alone it was not even that good.. asked the waitress why it was like that and if we could do anything about it and didnt know what to say and wouldnt do anything for us except say ""ya it happens."" horrible quality and service, wouldnt recommend this place for anything more than for their desserts"
Milena J.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,24,11,4.0,10/15/2015,"Great atmosphere.  Amazing service.  We sat in the bar area and we're served by TAYLOR.  Wonderful servoce.  Pleasant, attentive, and very on-point.   Food is good.  Drinks are fabulous. Can be loud, but it is...  a bar...  with games on...  so...  if it's too loud foe you, stay home.  Hahahaha Will be back.  Taylor is amazing."
Sandy S.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",0,6,,5.0,8/22/2017,"I have been dining here with a group of four friends on our birthdays for the past seven years. We have tried other restaurants and always find ourselves coming back here.  I am happy to report, we have never in what is probably thirty dining experiences, had a problem.  Today was no exception.  Our server Nicole was friendly and attentive.  The manager Jacob came by and asked if everything was to our liking. It was nice to see him out and about and really actively helping his staff.  He asked if we would like to sample their new warm churro with vanilla ice cream dessert.  Of course we said yes and it was DELICIOUS!  All of our food was great.  The tortilla soup is so yummy.  I had the seared ahi salad, wonderful.  One had the Mediterranean tacos and the others opted for the half chicken club sandwich lunch special that comes with fries and a choice of soup or salad. All excellent.   We plan on enjoying many more birthday celebrations at our favorite, friendly gathering place.  Another plus is that we had reward points and got ten dollars off of our bill."
Jeremy T.,"Granite Bay, CA",55,112,1225,3.0,5/14/2016,"It was a better experience than before but food had only slightly improved. We got the happy hour prices which were only  $2 off. Calamari wasn't that great, chicken lettuce  Wrap were good, the small pizza would have been a major disappointment if I had to pay $11.50 for it, it was half price, came with 4 very small pieces, the shredded pepperoni was a nice touch. Kids spaghetti was good. 5 chicken pots tickers were not worth the $10, I don't believe pots tickers are ever worth this price here or cheesecake Factory. Service was good. The food was so so"
Akash G.,"Agoura Hills, CA",9,11,1,5.0,1/20/2017,"One of my all time favorites. Their food is just so good . While most of their items require a mention,  the Avocado Egg Rolls are definitely a must"
Cinthya G.,"Rocklin, CA",2,16,12,2.0,12/18/2016,"I ordered lunch over the phone and pick up time was 15 mins. I arrived exactly in 15 mins and there was a lady at the pick up checkout with food in bags but she was adding more meals to her pick up list. The 2 cashiers male & female were running around trying to get her order together. Mind you I am on my lunch just trying to pick up my food and go. Neither cashier acknowledged me, I waited till the lady was done. The food was great but the customer service needs improvement."
Rich L.,"Sacramento, CA",0,29,,4.0,12/26/2016,"Good Selection of beers and the Help is fast and very attentive.  Food is a little pricy, but its good.  We were a party of 7 and got in right away at a good table.  We were happy."
