Kasha R.,"Folsom, CA",132,4,,2.0,2/12/2017,"On a Sunday night my hot husband and I took our three well cultured, robust teenagers to dinner for our sons 17th birthday. It was freezing in our Dino g area and we asked three times for fans to be off. We had two appetizers but no plates which she had promised them. It took 12 minutes for drink refills. My daughter found a hair in her food. My tortilla  soup was cold and took forever to come back out.  Overall the service was slow and it took four people to accommodate five of us. Beware family folks- Taco Bell was a better bet."
Robert D.,"Fair Oaks, CA",59,48,80,2.0,5/14/2016,Had late dinner ordered the crusted chicken food was warm to the touch as if the plate of food was just micro waved then served! Very disappointing from a place like this. Server at the bar was very nice and friendly..will probably be a while before I go back to this location.
Rick M.,"Folsom, CA",0,21,5,1.0,2/2/2017,I have visited BJ's Folsom several times and I am finally done.  The service is always slow and the attitudes (excluding the bar) need some adjustments.  They can keep my BJ's rewards.
Becci H.,"Roseville, CA",27,105,76,5.0,12/3/2015,"Nice place, but getting our drinks took foreeeeever. ..and the place is empty.  Lame. Additionally, the avocado eggrolls are pre made and just heated. Didnt taste that great and over priced. I'm a little disappointed. Went in again 1/28, Changing my review back to 5 stars...Todd was awesome and made sure our visit was great. Food was perfect and the strawberry lemonade is to die for! Thanx guys!"
Austin V.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",0,1,,1.0,4/21/2017,"We found a cockroach walking on our booth and when we brought it up to the host all they did was to offer us a different table. Not once did a manager come over and talk to us about our experience. I am extremely disappointed with how this was handled. As we were getting seated for the second time, I even had an employee ask me is there seriously a cockroach over there? I responded with yeah right there. It was on the wall at this point being taken care of. I am extremely disappointed with the management's lack of professionalism and interest in this matter. The server was told by another server that we moved because of that incident and we were offered a free pizookie. But again not from a manager just a server trying to make our experience better. Once moved our server was great, just a poorly managed situation. Hands off is not a good approach to a cockroach in a restaurant"
Danielle J.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",0,2,,1.0,2/5/2017,Terrible service the waiter are really rude not perky they have attitude and take way to long to bring your food out they even threw my check at me which I didn't like good food terrible service
Jennifer S.,"Sacramento, CA",3358,491,984,4.0,3/9/2014,"BJ's has one of the biggest menus of any restaurant in the area. You can satisfy pretty much any craving here.  If you only get one thing, get a pizooki: an amazing soft gooey cookie served to you hot in the cast iron it was just cooked in, topped with ice cream and whipped cream. The best flavors are white chocolate raspberry and red velvet. I haven't tried it yet, but they now have a gluten-free pizooki, too.  The pizzas are really good. The crust is a little bit on the thicker side, but is really flavorful, and doesn't have that bread-y taste that some pizzas have. My personal favorite is the sweet pig pizza. The wedge salad here is one of my favorite salads anywhere. It probably has a ton of calories, since it's smothered in bleu cheese, but it's amazing. Maybe what makes it so good is that it's literally a quarter wedge of a lettuce head, so it's really fresh, as opposed to shredded lettuce which is allowed to be prepared well before it's served. The giant baked potatoes are pretty legit, but they are really truly giant. I'd recommend either splitting, or getting a half order with soup or salad. The house beers are amazing. My last four paragraphs started with the same word because I had a Jeremiah Red earlier. Word to the wise, they will let you sample small servings of beer for free, so you can make sure you like it before you buy it. The avocado egg rolls here are not the best ever, but they are pretty legit. The only problem is that sometimes the avocado is over-ripe (I've had this happen probably 1/3 of the time).  This is a good location. Even though they are always packed, they seat pretty quickly, they are usually very clean, and the staff has great customer service in spite of the fact that they all appear to be under 18."
amy c.,"Citrus Heights, CA",15,19,10,4.0,12/10/2016,"We came in on a rainy Thursday, the place was packed. My bf and I were still seated with in 10mins of arriving. He ordered the spicy noodles. They were amazing!! Our waitress gave us her honest opinion. She said that she had not tried it Bc she was not a fan of spicy but several of her other costumers loved it and a couple said it was to spicy. I am also not a fan of anything to spicy. They were not spicy they were so good!! The sauce is sweet with a nice hint of flavor. Noodles cooked perfect, tender, meaty and a big portion. I ordered the Cobb salad. The dressing they use is good but needed to add more. The lettuce was crisp, veggies fresh and chicken full of flavor. Another big portion but all worth it!!"
Anita C.,"Reno, NV",0,11,,1.0,6/29/2017,"Disappointing experience. Our waitress, Kayla, would not split our check so that we could use two BOGOs. We had to ask for refills on our drinks. One meal was undercooked and our party of 7 was done eating before she remembered to bring it out. She should have offered a complimentary dessert to the one person who had to wait so long, but never did. Speaking of dessert ... one person in our party actually did order dessert but she forgot it. She brought our check and at that point, we didn't want to bother anymore.  We've been to many BJs and this was the only one we've received subpar service."
Lilia H.,"Fremont, CA",135,79,79,4.0,11/8/2016,It's not a bad place for lunch. The portion was really big. Service was great. Food was not bad. Probably would come here again. There is usually a bit of wait time if you come during weekend. Make sure to make a reservation.
Mia C.,"Orangevale, CA",41,858,533,4.0,10/27/2016,"Recently went to BJs for a Friday lunch with colleagues. It is super crazy wait time to get the entree, but kind of fun. Salmon with couscous was decent. Also loved the appetizer sampler platter"
Ali A.,"Folsom, CA",0,10,1,5.0,7/10/2017,We had Steve as our waiter in the bar and our experience was lovely. I've worked in fine dining for 10 years; Steve was fun engaging and accurate in his service. Will return.
Jeffery S.,"San Mateo, CA",86,33,2,1.0,5/24/2016,"Thought I'd stop in for lunch while out of town and grab a bite to eat. Walked in and sat at high tables behind bar seats. I wasn't asked 1x in 10min if I needed a menu, drink etc. Horrible SERVICE....Walked out of this place shaking my head. There were 4 hostesses in this area so short staffed isnt an excuse. Might want to do better training. Its 3 stars so I guess its to be expected. This was on Tues May 26th at 1pm"
Puzant C.,"Los Angeles, CA",214,559,460,4.0,7/6/2015,"2015 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 096/100 Stopped by for a late night dinner with friends since they serve food till after midnight here, which is nice. Hostess never greeted us, she just looked at us, picked up menus, and walked away... we didn't know if we should follow her or not. But we did... and that led us to a table where she put the menus down and walked away. Very interesting. However our waitress was very nice. Checked on us a few times too. Food was good, avacado egg rolls were great, and my friend's flat bread pizza was delicious. Overall, good experience, even though the hostess may have been having a bad night."
Alan Sydney B.,"Folsom, CA",3,7,3,4.0,5/30/2017,always looking forward to having a great time with family and friends fun place to eat and drink and enjoy sports on large tv screens  great bar drinks -  good food too
Phyllis G.,"Placerville, CA",0,5,,1.0,6/21/2017,"The food is great and a good variety. But the problem is getting seated (as others have stated). We were there at 11:30am on Saturday, the restaurant was less than half full. Our party of 2 was told to wait to be seated (we were the only ones checking in). A party of 4 came in after us, and were seated right away.  Another party of 2 came in, and were seated right away.  The third party after us was about to be seated when we complained.  The very young preoccupied lady told us the machine just spits the info out into a pile and the seater just grabs whatever one they want.  Hmmm...this system doesn't sit too well.  Were we passed over because we didn't fit a mold...were we wearing headgear, or were we the wrong color, or had three arms instead of two?  Needless to say, we left without eating."
Rana S.,"Sacramento, CA",9,40,2,5.0,5/8/2016,"I've been to other BJ's locations and everything is usually good but I wanted to give props to the Folsom location. I took my mom here for Mother's Day and it was packed but they still managed to seat us within 5-10 minutes. Our server Zachary was so friendly and professional he made the whole experience fantastic. I got the Balsamic Chicken and my mom got the Barbacoa Chicken. Both were fabulous. Her chicken was super juicy and tender and really flavorful along with the black beans and rice. My chicken was smokey, not quite as juicy but still really good. The mashed potatoes were soooo good along with the onion straws. for dessert we got the lemon and blueberry pizookie and mmmmm heaven is a fresh out of the oven chocolate chip cookie with cold vanilla bean ice cream melting all over it!   All in all it was a perfect dinner and my mom was very happy and had a great time. When mom's happy, I'm happy. Next time we're comin for the pizza which I know is reallllly good too!"
Bonny W.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",9,24,,2.0,6/9/2017,"Service at this restaurant ruined our dining experience. The food was good, in fact a few dishes were excellent. There were five of us, but not everyone got the same treatment. Some had drink refills, others did not. Awkward. It took a long time to get our food and even longer time to get the attention of our server for any reason. It appeared that the management team had gathered at the greeting/seating station and simply were unaware they had a full house of hungry people. We won't bother going back. There are to many other good places to eat in the area."
Robin Ann Z.,"Citrus Heights, CA",29,46,12,5.0,9/24/2016,"We were a pain in the ass couple tonight and our server Emily G. was amazing. We had food allergies, specials requests and other random crap to deal with. She handled everything with efficiency, professionalism and kindness."
Jonathan P.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",0,4,,3.0,6/1/2017,"Food is always good, service is sometimes slow. For the most part Bjs is great. Needs to work on the service and will excellent!"
