Jeff S.,"Fort Collins, CO",79,35,8,3.0,11/30/2017,"Giving it three stars because we have eaten here many, many times since it opened. If it were our first experience, it's a one or a two tonight. Ordinarily, the service is pretty good and the staff is courteous. On this occasion, not so much. And it's pretty disappointing. We sat at the bar so we could watch Thursday Night Football. The place was packed. The bartender came over and got our beer order after about 10 minutes. Wife ordered a pulled pork sandwich, I ordered a burger, fries and calamari as an appetizer. The food took longer than normal, I'm assuming because the place was pretty busy. Wife's meal arrived as ordered. But my burger was served without fries and the calamari wasn't served prior to the main dishes. So I asked about both. Who orders a burger without fries? And what about the calamari? Not cool. They brought out fries and calamari about 5-10 minutes later. Bizarre. And then a gal, who I assume is kitchen manager, comes out to apologize. I'm a bit agitated, so I ask her, ""who orders a burger without fries? And why wasn't the calamari served as an appetizer?"" To which she says in a short tone, ""Sir, I am taking care of the calamari. Sorry."" Great, but the tone and demeanor were shitty. As if I were wrong to question it. Newsflash - when I take my wife out for dinner, and I'm obviously paying for someone to prepare and serve our meal, the expectation is the food be served as ordered in a timely fashion. Otherwise, I'll cook my own damn food and eat at home. When that expectation isn't met, I blame the server and tip accordingly if at all. In this case, I left $4 on a $27 tab. To make it worse, wife left her phone at the bar. When she returned to get it, she had to wait around for more than 10 minutes while the same bartender and kitchen manager gave her the cold shoulder and short attitude before finally giving her the phone. We live close by and have gone in often because it's convenient and the service historically has been good. Not sure when or if we'll go back after tonight's experience."
Paul W.,"Wellington, CO",0,4,30,1.0,12/20/2017,"When you go to a restaurant (your steak is $21.00) and they ask you how would you like your meal brought out  (Appetizer 1st wait for me to finish my appetizer then, Salad 2nd wait for me to finish my salad and then you should bring my steak) and they agree well that's how your meal should be brought out. Just started eating my salad and here comes my steak. Now, if I want to eat a cold steak, mash potatoes and asparagus I would be totally done with how you delivered my food but, I'm not. Told the waiter... Take it back he said what, take it back. This was from last time, still over cooked prime rib, forgotten side, and charged for extra drink, DO NOT EAT HERE!!!"
Hanna B.,"Fort Collins, CO",150,6,,5.0,1/10/2018,"The Pazookie's are UNREAL!! So good!! The food is actually pretty good, but we usually come for the dessert. I highly suggest the Cookies n Creme pazookie!"
Sylvia N.,"Houston, TX",2,29,53,4.0,5/22/2017,"Not expecting to love this place at all but wow, it first started off our awesome waitress, Kyriè. She's named after the Mister Mister song and she's so funny and awesome. She even sang some of the lyrics of the song lol, she's awesome. She automatically just put me in an upbeat mood.  I ordered the Hibiscus tea which is okay, I probably wouldn't order it again. For an appetizer, we ordered the honey Sriracha Brussel sprouts which were good but I liked them better at Austins.. because at Austin's they have bacon in them! For dinner, my coworkers and I ordered a chicken club, Mediterranean pizza (1/2 off deep dish pizza on Mondays), seared ahi salad, creamy couscous Mac & cheese, and the Mediterranean pita tacos.  Omg the creamy couscous mac n cheese is freaking amaze balls! The added bacon and the baked bread crumbs on top is so good. The Mediterranean pizza is ok, I would've preferred a meat lovers or something but the Mediterranean pita tacos are delicious. They taste really fresh and not really heavy except for the pita bread. The side it comes with is good too. I believe it's like a quinoa mix with corn, beans, and peppers. The seared ahi tuna salad was pretty good too, the tuna was tender and cooked to perfection.  My coworker got the oasis beer and really loved it, he's a beer snob lol so I recommend it.  For dessert, I ordered the mini gluten free chocolate chip pizookie, oh my gosh so good! If I wasn't full I would've ordered a bigger one.  4 stars because I didn't care for the Mediterranean pizza and the hibiscus tea but it's definitely worth a try because everything else is so good. The restaurant is clean and nicely kept. All of the servers are really nice and friendly."
Joy W.,"Bailey, CO",2,41,1,4.0,10/18/2017,Blond bartender is ALWAYS friendly and helpful. Love the ahi appetizer and the fried artichokes!
Molly E.,"Denver, CO",0,7,,2.0,12/13/2017,This was my third time visiting BJs.  The staff at BJs have always been very nice and courteous.  The reason for my 2 star rating was our food was awful!  Everything tasted like a frozen TV dinner.  It's sad that these big chain restaurants don't care about the food they serve anymore.  I had the pasta and meatballs and it was very disappointing.  Sorry BJs but I won't be returning anytime soon.
Diego R.,"Greeley, CO",215,17,5,4.0,5/27/2017,"Great location! Love the interior, love the patio, love the bar. All around great menu but don't pass on a Pazookie. If you appreciate an awesome waiter ask for Josh, TOP NOTCH."
B W.,"Plainfield, IL",4,371,,4.0,10/31/2017,"Very nice place.  Good service, good food, salmon was done right.  Did not like the broccoli as it was dry.  I would recommend for a nice lunch."
Jo Ann F.,"Loveland, CO",0,29,2,5.0,11/11/2017,"Came today as Veterans for Veterans Day and the service was awesome!  We both got the sirloin and it was delicious.  We really appreciate that they honor the veterans!  And it wasn't packed, I think we found the perfect place!"
Lindy S.,"Centennial, CO",14,159,30,2.0,5/28/2016,"I have to agree with the uninspired reviews of other Yelpers. This isn't the best showing for this franchise.  We ordered a Brussels Sprouts appetizer that looked good on the menu, but was unidentifiable by even the waitress when brought to the table. She did replace them with a less-charred batch, but they were bitter and are still haunting me, almost two hours after lunch.  I've had the chicken parmesan several times at the Aurora location, and never felt like it came from a freezer kit until today. The chicken was also over cooked and oddly dense. The sauce had separated and I was surprised when the obviously scooped-and-frozen potatoes were warm.  The other people I was there with also felt their meals lacked the finesse they have experienced elsewhere, and hope they are able to find it, as BJ's offers a unique dining experience  when done right.  While other people in our party were delayed to join the group because of a hostess pitch to join some frequent diner club, we had no issues with our waitress or service."
Ming X.,"Fort Collins, CO",20,77,60,3.0,6/1/2017,We came for lunch.  The artichoke dip was really good.  It was popping hot and tasty.  My bison burger was so so.  The buns were dried up.  Nothing special about the burger.  I had it better elsewhere.  My colleague's pizza however looked pretty good.  Thick crust loaded with toppings.  The Pizookie was good.  Soft cookie with a scoop of ice cream.  Service was decent.
Dan L.,"Windsor, CO",8,4,,1.0,9/24/2017,"We stopped in last night to have dinner and we waited forever to be seated which is fine I expect that on a Friday night but we finally get seated. We were all hungry and excited. But the slow service and horrible food was a huge letdown. We had someone order soup and when it as brought out no spoon we had to ask and it took forever once again. We also know our kids are cute but when the server is more interested in talking to them and asking them to draw things for her instead of getting sweetener packets that we asked for when she had come by in previous trips it was getting redicoulos. My wife's steak was cooked to the point where a old boot would have been considered medium rare compared to what we were given. My burger was cold and the kids macaroni and cheese was cold and solidified. When my wife confessed that the steak was to well done the server said she will have them make another so we sat there another hour waiting for that. Then the bill came and we were charged for everything. Which was a disappointment. Bad food, bad service, ruined our other plans because we were there almost 3 hours. We have been here before and it was not like this. I don't know what was going on that night."
Adam B.,"Severance, CO",22,3,,4.0,4/19/2017,Lots of choices! Many beers and drinks to choose from. Little loud even away from the bar.
Fabian C.,"Grand Terrace, CA",115,35,4,4.0,1/10/2017,"Great service.  Our waitress was genuine, caring, and charismatic.  She took care of us.  The food is always great at BJs."
Joe B.,"Louisville, KY",114,155,616,1.0,10/21/2015,Came here with a coworker that kept speaking of the pot roast. Well to his surprise no pot roast. The waitress said that it was so go and she doesn't know why it's no longer on the menu....ouch  Once we finally got service (about 15mins after sitting down) it wasn't too bad. The waitress was a little corky and scattered brained.  Food was ok. Nothing I would come back for.  My major complaint was we ordered an appetizer that the waitress forgot to order for us. When we mentioned it when our entree came out she said oh yeah I forgot to grab it. Then about 5 mins later she came out with it. We assumed she would just take it off our bill but she didn't. We were ready to go so we didn't even mention it by the time our bills came.  With other choices in the area I won't be back.
David C.,"Cary, NC",13,15,2,4.0,8/12/2016,"Let me start off by saying that I didn't have to wait long to be seated (though by the looks of it on here, I could have been an outlier). I ordered a tonka stout and the deep dish ravioli.  On the stout - I found this to be an above average stout. Great chocolate and coffee notes in it and a head that just doesn't die. Two quibbles with it. First of all, the serving temp was too cold for the style. Secondly, this is a pretty big beer - above 8%. I love big beers but this tasted pretty young and hot. I think this would be a fantastic beer in 2 months but right now, it's a bit rough along the edges.  The pasta was great. Serving size was huge. I think it was on the pricy side of things, but not outrageously so. While I probably won't come back regularly, I'll come by on occasion."
Mark E.,"Cheyenne, WY",21,10,,4.0,9/3/2016,"We do not normally go out to eat these days for a variety of reasons, but decided to have a treat for our little family. When we were in Costco checking out, we asked the cashier if she could recommend Freddy's. We were immediately accosted by the cashier, two box-uppers, and the people in line behind us informing us that we should go somewhere else unless we had a death-wish. I asked what they recommended and was told to try BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse. As a disclaimer, this is not an eating establishment I have ever visited before. Some cons - 1. Walking in the front door, we were not greeted which I notice other people have said the same thing. It looked a lot like an expensive, over-priced yuppie establishment with young, ""I-don't-care-about-you"", treat-me-like-a-god 20 year old college dropouts manning the front desk trying to look like they were the glue that held BJ's together. 2. The young person that greeted us did not say welcome but asked one question when I said we needed a table for four. He asked, ""Are you a premier member?"" I responded no. He did not ask if I was interested in being a premier member. He did not even smile at the peons in front of him and bewail the fact that we had no idea what we were missing at not being a member of the elite who frequented this location. Nope, nope, nope. He simply said, ""OK,"" pointed to a spot on the floor near his desk and said, ""Wait there!"" Turning he walked off into the darkness of the restaurant that really did not look overly inviting. 3. After eventually being seated by afore-mentioned young man, he simply pointed to the table. We sat and he put our menus down and then walked off. He did not say anything about a waitress being with us soon and still no welcome, even though we were one of the masses of the lower class who are not already members of the Premier Members Club. 4. We sat for 15 minutes in a restaurant that was actually not at lunch time and was emptying quite rapidly. I wondered if I had said we were members of the Premier class if we would have had better service. After just over 15 minutes, we finally had a waitress come by and ask, ""Has anybody come to take your order yet?""  We responded in the negative and she said, ""Well, I would be happy to help you today. Would you like to start with some appetizers or something to drink?"" Now for the pros - 1. The waitress was nice, but not sickly sweet like the Freddy's Frozen Custard I got after our lunch, but that is a different review. She was friendly and made it look like she was genuinely enjoying her job. 2. Our iced water with lemon was quickly placed on the table in large, squeaky clean glasses and there were NO FLOATIES in the water. The water in most restaurants deserves a negative review on Yelp just by itself. BJ's must use a filtering system because I actually just about downed my glass in a few minutes and it was actually refreshing. The lemon was freshly cut and the size was enough to squeeze into my water and even the next refill. 3. Our children ordered a pizza to split with different toppings and my wife and I had the sirloin. My wife ordered the roasted asparagus and a bowl of tomato bisque (I think bisque is a French word that means, not from a Heinz soupcan or something like that.)  I ordered the Piranha Pale Ale bowl of chili as one of my sides and the garlic cheddar mashed potatoes (which I can obviously spell unlike former Vice-President Dan Quayle). 4. Our bowls of tomato bisque and piranha pale ale chili arrived in a portion that I thought was almost a main course just by itself. It was large. I could have ordered it in a bread bowl and would have probably been full. There was fresh basil and croutons in the tomato bisque, and mine had a dollop of freshly grated cheddar cheese and a nice helping of sour cream right on top. We both stirred ours up mixing everything together and I could not help but notice that our children were drooling and saying they would have liked what we had instead of pizza. They had not even tried their pizza or our soup. The first taste made me think of the culinary critic writing his critiques in the restaurant on the movie Ratatouille. It was amazing. It had all the right flavors and I am not sure how the Piranha fits into the chili, but I would go back JUST for this chili. Our children finished ours off as we wanted space for the rest of our dinner. 5. Finally as I am running out of space, the children got their pizza and we tasted it and were wowed again. The steak would take another full page for review. It was phenomenal. I cannot remember the last time I had a steak so succulent. I am glad I don't have space to describe it because I would not want you to drool on your keyboard and short it out. Overall, while the first impression was not the best, the rest made up for it. We will visit again and I will probably order the same thing! The missing star was for the first impression only."
Brian W.,"Fort Collins, CO",22,13,,2.0,2/2/2016,"Completely agree with lackluster reviews. Some of this is a new franchise trying to figure it out. I have been going to this chain for nearly 20 years...this is the worst examples I have seen. I hope they improve, this part of FoCo could use them. However, they have a long way to go."
Kaitlynn S.,"Flagstaff, AZ",211,21,21,4.0,8/3/2016,"Not the best food in America, but they actually have great service, good wings, and really awesome cookies baked in pizza tins!"
Kevin V.,"Chicago, IL",16,5,,4.0,8/5/2016,"I've been here twice over the past few years when traveling and each time has been fantastic. The service is what rocks. Most recently, In July, 2016, I sat at the bar later in the evening for dinner and the bartender (Marcus G) was welcoming, attentive, checked in, cleared plates, etc. I realized at the end of the night that I'd left my wallet at my hotel (not atypical) and Marcus and the BOH manager were super accommodating. Food is good. Service is fab. Next time I'm in Fort Collins I will stop in again."
Randy J.,"Littleton, CO",20,294,45,3.0,10/22/2015,I had a sandwich about a couple of weeks ago.  The service was good and the food was good.  The bathrooms were extremely clean and there is no reason why I wouldn't go back to eat again if I am back in the area.
Dino T.,"Fort Collins, CO",3,11,,3.0,7/25/2016,"There are better dining options in the area.  BJ's is nice to eat at now and then, but is high priced. Recent visit the bad: debris on the floor in the dining area (if they don't keep the dining area clean, what is the kitchen like?!), pizza was lukewarm, no plates for our pizza, inattentive waitress, had to get up and get plates and red peppers from another server, no manager or ineffective manager on duty. The good: received what we ordered and in a timely manner, and other than the temperature, was good. We've been here several times and live nearby.  The food is usually pretty good, and we especially enjoy the pizza and BJ's brews.  Both are too expensive though -- priced over equivalent options in the area, which keeps us from dining here more frequently   This last visit will be our last for awhile due to the service.  With the abundance of great dining in the Fort Collins area, BJ's will have do to better unless they're just counting on out of town business."
Zach W.,"Reno, NV",13,116,116,4.0,8/18/2015,"I opted for BJ's as a safe bet for a business meal with a client whose dietary preferences are unknown. I've eaten at other locations of this chain and enjoyed their fare.  The prime rib dip caught my eye and proved to be a wise choice. The bread was fresh and au jous was flavorful without falling into the trap of tasting like a melted salt lick. The beef was delicious, tender and ample. The strawberry lemonade wasn't the finest I've ever sampled, but it was a pleasing balance of sweet and sour; quite refreshing. While waiting for my client, I sampled the stuffed mushrooms which were quite tasty. A light drizzle of juice from a lemon slice really made them pop. I am currently awaiting a white chocolate chip and macadamia nut pazookie, my favorite flavor of their signature  dessert. Unless they take a flamethrower to it or serve one left over from last week, I expect it to be a delicious stroll down the decadent, sugar-paved lane to Foodcomaland.  I knocked their rating a bit due to the service. The hostess was very nice and accommodated my seating request. My waiter was also nice, though during my extended wait for a client who pulled a no-show, he seemed to forget that I was still present. Honestly, my wait for the client was quite lengthy before I finally heard from him and realized what had happened. As a result, I want to give my waiter the benefit of the doubt. That said, once I realized I was eating alone, it took several minutes to get his attention during his table-hopping service circuit.  Damn, the pazookie arrived and looks delectable. Now I'm distracted. Suffice it to say, this was a good meal coupled with a minor service complaint. Ok, now for dessert!"
Darcy B.,"Great Falls, MT",1,28,3,3.0,6/15/2016,"I've been to this location several times and every experience has been satisfactory or better. The food is delicious and served in a timely manner. The service is also very good as well, the wait staff has always been attentive from my experience. UPDATE: Bring multiple forms of ID as the bar staff is not aware that there are 49 other states outside of Colorado. I have a Virginia driver's license because my husband is military and we move every three to four years. There is no sense in me changing it every time so I just kept my home state. In short, the bar tender did not think it was real and said she would have to take it to the manager. Ok, so implying I'm an underage liar is probably not the best way to get me to come back. So 15 minutes later the manager comes out and asks if I have another form of ID because he can't accept my driver's license because it has a WY address on it. I explain to him that we are military and the Virginia DMV allows us to have the address of where we are stationed. That wasn't good enough so I have to walk out to my car, get my military ID which I only have to show to get on base, and then FINALLY they agree that I'm over 21 (PS, I am 26). So nearly 30 minutes after I arrive, I'm allowed to order. On the upside, the manager did sincerely apologize and paid for my meal and beer. Going through the Spanish Inquisition was kinda worth free food I guess."
Mike S.,"Arvada, CO",7,28,,5.0,5/15/2016,"Had a deep dish pizza, the crust was light and the toppings were very tasty.  Service was very good"
LaRae J.,"Cheyenne, WY",0,44,9,5.0,7/23/2016,Hadn't been there in a while and had an amazing dinner. Server was amazing. Good was just as good as I remember. Can't wait to go back
From C.,"Windsor, CO",0,72,,3.0,7/10/2016,"One of my favorite bar/pub places to eat. However they take a long time, service is hit or miss and the lightening is weird. They do offer a wide variety menu and their avacado egg rolls are the bomb!"
Gary B.,"Loveland, CO",0,14,1,5.0,1/6/2017,"I have been going here since it opened and the food and service never disappoints. The Chili is great but so is most of the selections. The wait staff is beyond friendly and always get fast service, at times when its crowded could be a little slower but that is expected. The manager Alex is one of the nicest managers I ever met  at any restaurant.  I started going to BJs when the opened in California and this is one of the best BJs"
Peeyoosha H.,"Fort Collins, CO",26,43,75,4.0,2/10/2015,"We went here on last Saturday and had a good experience. Ambiance was pleasant, nice and quiet, service was fast and friendly. My pomegranate martini was lovely & liked it better than  strawberry martini. Spinach stuffed mushrooms were amazing, loved the taste of lemon pesto sauce. We love Chicago's deep dish pizza and that was the main attraction here. We ordered veggie deep dish and I would say pizza was great but not the same, really as close as we could get."
Amanda B.,"Pueblo, CO",0,33,,2.0,5/29/2016,"Let me start by saying I LOVE BJ's Brewhouse, or anyway the other ones I have eaten at.  This one, kinda ranks near the bottom of any experience I have had.  We arrived later than lunch hour, the place was NOT busy in any way shape or form.  We were not greeted at the door and in fact, had to wait quite a while for anyone to acknowledge us and seat us.  Our server was very nice, and very helpful. We were with a toddler who was approaching naptime so we quickly placed an order for her so as to (possibly) save a meltdown during our dining.  Our beverages came pretty timely as did the toddler meal.   After that, we waited a full 30 minutes for our meals, one salad and one sandwich-wouldn't think it would take that long to make.  The salad was ""ok"" not great-the dressing was pretty ""blah"" (new cobb salad with an avocado base dressing) and the salad definitely had the taste of coming out of a bag.  The sandwich had so much garlic flavor on the bread it was nearly inedible. The server was good to refill drinks but really never checked on us within the time frame of our meals taking so long.   I think we'll skip this particular BJ's in the future."
Christy C.,"Fort Collins, CO",4,12,,5.0,5/25/2015,"Amazing service wonderful food, awesome beers !! Cant wait to go back. I had the ribs and the meat was falling off the bone! Ask for Megan G. great waitress !"
Jeffrey C.,"Loveland, CO",113,78,79,5.0,2/15/2015,"I love this place. I use the for catering just about once or twice a week. It's always a hit with my customers because the offer such a huge variety of foods. I always tell people ""I'm going to bring healthy & unhealthy!"" For 99.00 you get 2 large pizzas, two huge salads, 8-10 balsamic chicken breasts, chicken wings or tenders, 4 sides, & set ups for 10-15 people. I always add a pizooki and ice tea and lemonade. It's enough food to feed an army. The staff is AMAZING! Chelsea takes great care of me every time I'm there. The manager Rob is a great guy too!  I haven't even mentioned the awards program. I get 25.00 off every two lunches I do. Tonight I used that for dinner out with my wife. The dinner was amazing (Cherry Chipotle Salmon & Mahi Mahi). We got lettuce wraps with shrimp. They were great too! The pizooki with salt Carmel topped off our meal. It was a great meal, service was awesome, 25.00s off & the gave us a free pizooki!  Go to BJs for a great meal and make sure you get a beer too! Good hard working folks willing to go the extra mile."
Scott B.,"Fort Collins, CO",1,5,,5.0,1/16/2015,"I'm not sure where any of these bad reviews are coming from and I certainly don't agree with them.  Obviously the people that pack the place every night don't either. This is my families favorite place to eat in Fort Collins.  We've tried a bunch of items on their vast menu and have yet to have a bad meal.  Service in typically wonderful, fast and friendly. While it may not fit the local definition of a brewhouse, I do cut them some slack because they are a chain.  The beer may not be brewed on location, but it is still good and the food is great.  More than I can say for many of the other chains in this town."
Lindsey P.,"Longmont, CO",92,245,312,3.0,1/15/2014,"This was my first time visiting the BJs in Fort Collins. I had previously been to the one in Aurora and I've been to both locations in Boulder. The food was pretty darn good. I usually order pizza (which is always great!) but this day I was in the mood for a sandwich. Both my sister and I got the California Chicken Club and we enjoyed them very much. This was the first time that the bread had been just a tad dark (burned) but it didn't taste burned, it just made the bread a bit harder. Still tasty! Our waitress was just ok. She wasn't very attentive but when she was there, she was friendly. It was a chilly day so I had asked if I could get some Bailey's in coffee...instead she brought me an Irish coffee (which I believe is whiskey in coffee, not a fan). She didn't come back for a LOOONNNGGG time; by the time she returned, we'd finished our food and were ready to go so it was awkward to tell her that it wasn't what I wanted. $6 for a drink I didn't want. Bummer. Otherwise we were happy. Next time I'll speak up - that was my fault."
Allen R.,"Loveland, CO",1,6,,2.0,8/5/2015,This place has been great for take out when I order it.  I have had to send back a burger from the online menu because the cooks didn't read that I wanted no cheese.  But the manager made it right while I waited for the new burger.   I went in today for lunch with my family and we ordered and other than bringing out the food and drinks we did not see our server at all.  No refills unless I flagged him down. For being so empty and only having 2 tables for our server to manage it seemed very odd to get this type of service.  I think that Dan needs to step up his game.   I'll try it again someday but for now I'm going to be going other places to eat.
Todd R.,"Manitowoc, WI",0,2,,4.0,4/22/2016,Had the fried jalapeño burger & it was one if the best burger I have had. The thin fries were very good also. Wasn't too impressed with the seasonal IPA. Overall very good experience.
Mary G.,"Fort Collins, CO",89,36,23,3.0,1/19/2015,"Went here for the first time for a late-night dinner on a Sunday - no one around, so it was nice and quiet. It's not a bad choice to go to for late-night if you are on the south side of town (not a lot of options...), all their apps are half-off and they have some good drink specials, 10-close (midnight I think) Sunday-Thursday. The apps were big enough that they worked for our meals. And half-off, so only about $3.50-5 a plate! Was definitely put off by our waitress who kept coming to the table and interrupting us, and referring to 'stuffing her face' and talking bad about the cook... yeek. One of the few times I've seriously considered not leaving a tip.  I kind of want to go back during normal hours just to see what it's ""really"" like, but first impression is ok chain restaurant food and raised-eyebrows for the service. Hot parking tip: you enter the lot somewhat awkwardly if you come in from the roundabout/Sprouts side - you want to park on the SIDE of the building, not the back lot that you see first... apparently I was not the first to do this in my group. LOL"
Claire S.,"Fort Collins, CO",3,44,,2.0,10/15/2016,"This place has crappy food but massive portions. I guess the price is worth the portion, but not the taste. Their alcohol is stupidly expensive."
Brandon C.,"Windsor, CO",4,25,3,1.0,10/13/2014,"Leave the funny sexual related name out of it. The food is gross, the place is dank and dark. I left there wishing I could throw up and rid my body of the nasty food. The waitress interrupted us each time she came over...rude? I highly recommend you do not go here. Mcd's is way better and cheaper than this crap"
Ryan U.,"Santa Barbara, CA",198,295,286,5.0,7/18/2014,"Contrary to most of the reviews, I really like BJs.  The restaurant is good as well, because the food is tasty, the service is prompt, and its a clean good vibe.  Everyone has been nice the few times I've been in there and everyone I've been with each time, has enjoyed the place.  I've come here during lunch, so not sure what the night crowd is like.  Oh, and for all the people complaining about the ""brewhouse,"" relax, it's a chain, and it's not going to meet our expectations of a brewhouse, in Fort Collins.  Take it for what it is."
