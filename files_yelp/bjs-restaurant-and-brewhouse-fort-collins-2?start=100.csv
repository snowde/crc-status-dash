Joel P.,"Eaton, CO",0,4,,5.0,4/15/2014,"Great food and great service!  I frequent this restaurant and gabr never been disappointed.  I've tried multiple items on the menu and they are delicious.  The staff is just the right amount of attentive, I don't like to be bothered while I eat unless I need another beer.  Could not recommend b j's enough!"
Colby C.,"Boulder, CO",10,7,,1.0,2/22/2014,"I was sourly disappointed.   Ive heard from multiple sources that this place was a generally tasty and all around good place to grab some food .   Now most of them did talk of the pizza, yet most of it was just bad.  I ordered tortilla soup, spinach and stuffed mushrooms, and mahi mahi.  Yes u know probably not the best choices yet was still less than bland.  Their was no seasojing to the mushrooms as thats all you could taste.  The soup was surprisingly very tasty yet was luke warm when it was served in what seemed to be a soup dish.  The beer for a brewery was very mellow of the least.  Their blonde was best described as budweiser and the red a light water down red.  Lastly my mahi mahi tasted like a banquet microwave dinner.   Very cozy and enjoyable atmosphere with intriguing interior. Service was good.  He understood what we wanted yet wouldnt let us finish before walking away.  It could be that our unfortunate experience, was due to the restaurant was packed but that would be my last visit."
Arlene T.,"Timnath, CO",0,5,,1.0,4/5/2014,"This was the second time we have tried this BJ's, the first time we were seated in an area with no other customers and we sat there for 15 minutes without anyone coming by to take an order or say hello, so we left! Tonight we tried again, we sat in an area next to the bar and asked the waiter about Happy Hour, he stated that Happy Hour was available in the bar area from 5pm to 7pm. We moved to the bar and saw a lighted sign which announced Happy Hour from 5pm to 7pm and a list of drinks and prices. When we asked the bartender about Happy Hour drinks she stated, that Happy Hour is not available on Saturday night and proceeded to push a button under the bar which unlit the Happy Hour Sign that was on the wall behind her! At this point, we left BJ's never to return again. Their staff is not well trained and definitely not gracious. The food may be good (we will never know), but the service is well below our expectations!"
