Happy Mom t.,"Fort Collins, CO",0,81,1,4.0,7/18/2016,"I was very nervous about going here due to many of the reviews, but my son insisted as he had been there with my mom and enjoyed it. I was pleasantly surprised; we were warmly greeted, our server - Christopher S was terrific and the food was very good. We will definitely be back!"
Robert L.,"Castle Rock, CO",0,2,1,4.0,9/1/2016,"The food was good, except the service was a bit slow. Between the first entree coming out and the second entree, it was about 10 minutes. It was a table of 12, but that is a large gap. This was not during a lunch or dinner rush either. The server was great and it wasn't her fault the food was slow coming out. Other than that, good food and great draft root beer."
Brooke M.,"Fort Collins, CO",1,62,2,1.0,8/28/2016,"We just ate here and had the worst service from Kyrie(?).  I'm pretty sure that she actually forgot about us after we ordered our food which took her forever to take in the first place. We didn't see her again until about 5 minutes AFTER our food was delivered by a different waitress. To top it off, I ordered my burger medium and it came out black and burned. Luckily, everyone else's food at the table wasn't as bad as mine. Management should consider training their staff."
Tyler N.,"Loveland, CO",0,6,,4.0,12/6/2015,"Had an excellent dinner. Deep dish pizza had a light, thick, crispy crust that was really good. Plenty of toppings on the pizza. Server was great. Only complaint was the wedge salad I had, lettuce was not good and tasted old."
Mike T.,"Loveland, CO",0,9,,2.0,1/17/2016,"My wife and I stopped in for lunch today - 3rd or 4th time we've been.  I usually get the California Chicken Club with the crisp fires ~ not much to mess up there, and really not bad.  Today, my wife ordered the fish and chips.  The ""chips"" were OK, but the fish, although fresh from the fryer and HOT, was just grease SOAKED.  I used to fry donuts in another life, and I know that temperature is critical for the food to NOT absorb the grease or shortening used in frying.  Apparently, the fry cooks at BJ's don't know this little secret.   I would have my cali chick (as our waitress called it) again, although at $11 it seems pricey.  I would definitely NOT order the fish & chips again, esp. at $14. Although there were few patrons (Broncos were playing Pittsburgh, and the place was pretty deserted), it still seemed to take forever for our food to appear.  Our waitress, Zoe, was very pleasant, however, and did a good job."
Kimberly F.,"Godwin, NC",0,5,,2.0,7/7/2016,This was my first visit. Ordered buffalo wings and received something similar to frozen nuggets with some sauce sprinkled on. I sent them back and ordered pot stickers. Dinner arrived before the pot stickers and I was asked if I wanted them boxed. The ended up removing the charges. Dinner was dinner for tired travelers. I would not recommend as no one in my party of 5 even ate half of their dinner.
Kelly E.,"Fort Collins, CO",1,4,,4.0,9/12/2015,Lots of seating and outdoor patio.  Great food and bar.  Menu offers wide selection to satisfy everyone.
Susanne R.,"Rexburg, ID",0,9,4,1.0,8/27/2015,"Admittedly, we were served by a trainee, so the hour we had to wait for our soup and salad might not be standard operating procedure. But she had nothing to do with how cold the restaurant was. Unfortunately, the soup was also cold. In addition, for $10.00 I came away hungry. Last of all, out of four checks, three were wrong. It was my first experience with a BJ's restaurant. I probably won't try it again any time soon."
K T.,"Fort Collins, CO",3,70,20,2.0,2/11/2014,"First time at a BJ's although I have seem them before.   A casual environment with a really nice bar area and lots of seating.  Big crowd when I was there with a friend of mine. I ordered a chicken dish with balsalmic drizzled over the top.  My buddy ordered a chicken pasta.   The presentation was great and the food tasted quite good from what I was expecting.   Here is the problem though and why I gave it such a low rating.  The portion size was ridiculous.  Ate my meal and was still hungry.  A couple of small pieces of breast, maybe 4oz at best, with a bit of greens and one small scoop or mashed potatoes.  That was it.    Not worth the money, would rather hit many of the other restaurants around the area. Would not return."
Gary L.,"Columbus, NE",0,4,,5.0,6/4/2016,I had the jumbo meatballs and spaghetti it was a good portion. Took an average amount of time and was noisy like a pub. The only bad thing was that it got a little warm in there but they eventually got it cooled down.
Mark P.,"Aurora, CO",7,46,15,4.0,4/25/2015,"We were in town to play soccer and called for lunch, maybe 20 minutes notice. They accommodated the group of 25, with a bunch of 13 year old girls and all went smooth!  Good range of menu items."
Susan Y.,"Fort Collins, CO",118,327,215,2.0,12/18/2013,"So, BJ's is a chain restaurant centered around beer, much like Rock Bottom though IMHO not quite as good.  The menu has entirely too many things on it, which makes me think that there's no way they can possibly execute it all very well.  Since I find these novel-length menus to be really annoying, I asked our waiter for a sandwich recommendation.  He recommended the French dip, so I tried it.  I didn't think much of it.  I also had their hard cider, which turned out to be as sweet as soda.  The best thing to recommend BJ's is that it is somewhat close to the Cinemark, and that it is huge enough to accommodate lots of diners, so it might be an okay place to eat before or after a movie with a bunch of friends."
Moira B.,"Fort Collins, CO",0,13,4,1.0,9/11/2015,"Worst service experience in FC...they dumped drinks on my husband & me, still charged for them, didn't bring napkins or anything to clean up the mess, we finally changed tables but the server who dropped the drinks on us took the silverware when she half-assed cleaned up and I had to eventually go to the hostess stand to get new silverware & napkins. When the server who took our order finally came around he couldn't find us...obviously no one told him what happened...and he talked to the manager who took an appetizer off the ticket which wasn't even equal to the amount we were charged for the dumped drinks. If we hadn't been starving we would have walked out. So we ate, paid & split. About a week later I sent an email explaining what happened and how disappointed I was since we had been there several times before but never received a response."
John D.,"Fort Collins, CO",0,36,,3.0,1/19/2016,"Been here quite a few times and the food is really hit and miss - sometimes it's really good and other times it really disappoints, ditto for the service. This new place sorta has a hip chic style of atmosphere and is a sorta cool type of brewery/pizza/ burger/ bar/ chain California Restaurant. Booya!!"
Anthony J.,"Fort Collins, CO",39,70,54,3.0,8/14/2013,"BJ's Brewhouse is a classy brewpub, by appearances mostly.  The décor smacks of that sort of model home design where everything was built from a catalog.  I say this in a matter-of-fact way, but not at all to infer that there is anything inherently wrong with that.  Clearly, mega corporations and deep-pocket investors can make a restaurant shine with all of the granite and brushed nickel accents money can buy.  However, let's not get too distracted from what we came to this place for: the beer and food (yes, in that order)!   If you come for the beer you might be disappointed.  Their options are the basic styles you would find sitting in the grocery store's 3.2% ABV section.  Wheat, Pale Ale, Red Ale, Amber Ale, Porter, Stout and a few others, but nothing really adventurous or notable by other CO brewery standards.  I've tried several of their offerings and I there is nothing great in the quality either.  Each style they had tasted a bit bland and boring.  Sure, they were good enough to have with your meal, but not worth making a trip to have by themselves. As for the food, I think they do very well!  I've had their pizzas, pastas, burgers, sandwiches and salads and they were all very well done.  I do really like the food; however, it's expensive compared to what you're getting.  I'd put it on par with Austin's price-point at around $15 an entrée (more for the better dishes such as steak or seafood).  I'm happy enough paying the price considering it's pretty good, but it might discourage others that are on a budget. The service is spotty.  You'll have one server become your best friend and give you superb quality service, but then you can get a lazy, apathetic server that really only cares about how much you tip them rather than how they can earn your tip.  I would've given BJ's a 4 star review if it weren't for this aspect. Overall, I think this place is nice for date or business lunch.  I personally won't be a regular here when there are a myriad of better beer and food options for my money.  Despite what I think, these guys will be doing very well considering their lucrative location next to Harmony and all those big box retailers such as Lowes and Target.  I'd recommend that anyone should try this place at least once."
Janet L.,"Fort Collins, CO",2,28,,1.0,5/12/2015,"I have tried this restaurant two separate time over the past year. I have had the same experience both times.  The waitress is super friendly to begin with and then as soon as she finds out we are not drinking alcohol the service is gone.  I ordered soup and received a dirty spoon so I asked for a clean one, by the time I got the spoon the soup was cold. The rest of the food was good but the service is laughable."
Deven D.,"Fort Collins, CO",2,13,1,1.0,3/18/2015,This particular BJ'S is the worst I've ever been to. If you like being served leftovers this is your place. The day old Ceaser salad will put you right over the top. Also the steamed veggies that looked like they came out of the dehydrater just before they lost all their moisture were also very appetizing. I wish I had two more hands so I could give this place 4 thumbs down
Shel G.,"Loveland, CO",19,33,133,5.0,6/7/2013,Awesome & Outstanding!! Even though they are slammed they are still great. Management is visible and attentive. Will return .... lots of times!! ;~}
Bob S.,"Denver, CO",39,135,4,3.0,7/29/2013,"With so many powerful chain restaurants springing up across Colorado, it becomes more challenging to develop a clear level of support versus the independent owned microbreweries. BJ's is spacious, modern, large wall mural, many flat screened type of sports brewery with very good service in the bar seating area, However, I thought pricing was expensive for the money-two very small rather ordinary fish tacos on too soft shells was $10.99, tasteless, not much fish and some cole slaw thrown on the top. Our friends raved about the beer, but we are wine drinkers  Loud, lots of families, and would be fun for a Broncos game-will give them one more shot as the entrees looked good."
Daniel J E.,"Stockton, CA",0,9,,4.0,6/14/2014,"So i had never been to a BJs before, I'm in the process of relocating so i'm driving west and spending a night in Fort Collins and there happened to be one across the street from the hotel. I dont know if this is their ""thing"" or what, but I went in and ordered a 14 ounce ribeye, and they brought me one in no more than three minutes.  I'm not exaggerating.  And, I was starrrrving.  That's the fastest I'd ever been served in a restaurant.  Is that like their hook?  Their signature?  I guess the cook just had a bunch of ribeyes going at all times, figuring someone would order one?  Whatever, who cares, I certainly didn't care, it worked splendidly for me at the time. Was it the best ribeye I had ever had?  No, but it was still reeeeally juicy and flavorful.  Maybe just slightly overdone, but i didnt care, they got it out to me in three minutes.  That's on me, the server who brought it out asked me to taste it to make sure it was right and I could have nit picked but it was pretty close.  So I ate it.  And then at the end, because it was father's day weekend they gave everyone a free beer glass and a $5 coupon for next time. My server, Callie, was really friendly and personable, despite the fact that they were slam packed full of people.  So added props to them for being able to not only keep up but serve me such a great dinner so fast.  and the bill for the whole thing was only $23.85 and i was out of there and full of steak in 25 minutes."
