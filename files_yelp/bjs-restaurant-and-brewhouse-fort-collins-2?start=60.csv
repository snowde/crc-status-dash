Mark N.,"Peyton, CO",2,1,,1.0,2/18/2015,This place is going down the tubes. I have had great food here but the last couple of times were pathetic. Our waiter was horrible. I could not even eat my steak as it was a big chunk of chewy gristle. He just took the plate without asking any questions.  A good waiter would have noticed it was not eaten and looked like a science project and said something.  Bye bye BJ's.
Heather D.,"Los Angeles, CA",35,43,4,1.0,7/22/2014,"I have been to this location twice and had take out twice. The food has just gotten worse and worse. Got pasta the first time. Under cooked and under sauced. The last time I got the appetizer with a couple of different things. The avocado rolls were in edible. See the  pictures I posted. Service is ok. But mostly young girls with no service experience just look good. I eat at bj back home all the time great food, great service. This one not so much"
Shad G.,"Jefferson, WI",11,6,,5.0,8/26/2014,"Our family stopped by this past Friday for dinner and although they were busy the staff was very pleasant and accommodating.  The house root beer is amazing,  certainly my son's favorite.  My wife and I's meals were delicious as well.  Overall a great night out. Thank you"
Chris V.,"Loveland, CO",1,8,,5.0,11/4/2014,We live BJ's! Everything we've tried is delicious and their beer is excellent. Our favorite is the salted caramel pizookie (caramel and ice cream and big cookie)
Aka ..,"Fort Collins, CO",0,33,9,3.0,12/12/2015,I've been here before. I'm sure I'll go back if someone else wants to go.  It's just not very remarkable. The beer is okay. The food is okay. The price is a little high for mediocrity.
Jim P.,"Fort Collins, CO",0,6,,1.0,2/26/2014,"The first visit to BJ's wasn't horrible, but we only went for happy hour which was reasonable.   The second visit we also went for happy hour but we had some apps, they were OK. I then decided to go to BJ's with a 3 other couples (8 total) for Dinner and Drinks.  The problems I had on this visit is the reason for the low rating.  We had a reservation for pm, they didnt seat us until 7:45.  The waitress had a HUGE attitude and was NOT failure with the menu and gluten free options.   We ordered drinks which arrived slowly, without the round of waters we asked for as well.  We asked again for water, and guess what didnt come...  Then we ordered dinner at which point we asked again for waters.  I saw a manager roll by shortly after and asked him if we could get some waters and informed him we asked numerous times.  Finally waters showed up. Then the dinner showed up, 1st off we got 7 out of the 8 dinners.... the last one came out 10 minutes after the others.  Also the sides ordered were not what was brought to the table.  Upon asking our waitress to fix the side dishes, she responded with a large attitude and about 15 minutes later she fixed 3 of the 4 sides that were wrong.  The 4th side order we gave up on after asking a few more times. 1/2 way through dinner we were greeted by another waitress who informed us she was taking over the table due to our previous waitress having a bad night.  She was reasonable, though when it came time for the bill she had no clue so she needed to get with the previous waitress to try and figure it out.  Im sure you can all imagine how that turned out. Pros: Happy Hour Cons: Staff, Management, Food The biggest issue I had was the attitude from staff and the fact that they changed waitresses obviously realizing the situation though we were never contacted by management.  I will not be returning anytime soon.  Visit at own risk!"
Jon W.,"Loveland, CO",0,2,,1.0,5/25/2015,"Went here for dinner today. Got a chicken club. The cook forgot to take the paper backing off of the melted cheese on the sandwich, and as you can imagine, made for an interesting eating experience. Told the server (Daniel, an older guy) and he did not seem to care nor did he offer to fix the situation. Quite disappointed and won't be eating here again nor recommending it."
Ania L.,"Honolulu, HI",0,25,,1.0,2/22/2014,"I wish I could give this restaurant 0 stars.  For starters, we waited quite a while for my fiance's beer to arrive, even though we were one of maybe 4 tables in a section.    And then there's the menu .... Overpriced, beyond mediocre food and presentation, along with crappy service and long wait times. We ordered a $13 Thai salad (yes, not the most expensive on the menu. but it sounded delicious).  What we got was a massive bowl, lined with paprika, and contained within puffed up lettuce giving the illusion of volume (there was none), old and slimy mango strips (thin as hell) and some scattered irregular sized chunks of chicken.  I think there may have been a piece of pepper in there somewhere.  Topped off with a sloppy avocado and 2 soggy tortilla chips. How's that for a Thai salad?  Pathetic.  We were hungry and thus we ate it, but I could make a better ""Thai"" salad than this at home. We thought we could share this salad and a flatbread pizza, but we were still hungry when we left the restaurant and it wasn't cheap! Wish my lovely finace didn't spend the dough on this crappy joint."
Betsy W.,"Fort Collins, CO",0,1,,1.0,7/30/2016,"Our visit started with the hostess saying her computer was down so we would have to give our rewards number to our server. It went down hill from there. We were taken to a table where we stood and waited for it to be bussed. Apparently, this was not done since our hands and arms stuck to the table.  Our server finally came by without introducing herself, so I have no idea what her name was. We were not asked if we would like an appetizer, so we interrupted her to say we would like the Santa Fe rolls, to which she replied, ""we don't have those anymore"". We ordered a different appetizer along with our meals. A half hour later, we got the app and the meals at the same time, delivered by 2 different servers. We were never asked if we needed anything and waited another 10 minutes to get ketchup for our fries. By then the food was cold. My husband's burger was in 3 pieces and not on the bun. As if it had been dropped on the floor. It was also WELL DONE even though he asked for medium. When the bill came, we noticed the $7.95 burger was suddenly $11.20. On the receipt it was noted that she wrote down the wrong burger."
Jen B.,"Fort Collins, CO",14,11,3,3.0,9/25/2014,"Awesome happy hour and good appetizers.  However I think the food is a bit over priced at its regular price. Service is ok, not the greatest and even worse when they get busy. I go for happy hr and thats about it"
Tom L.,"Fort Collins, CO",149,23,9,4.0,7/9/2014,"We love this place.  Cool atmosphere, and decent service.  We usually come on the weekends, and the wait isn't that bad.  It is a little expensive, but I think it is worth it."
Mason N.,"Fort Collins, CO",0,21,,2.0,9/26/2015,"Don't eat the avocado egg rolls. My wife is a vegetarian, I wanted to get something we could both ""eat"". Neither of us could finish it because it wasn't even half decent. Their burgers are only ok also."
Amanda K.,"Fort Collins, CO",1,9,2,2.0,9/1/2014,"Service was okay. The food was not good. We ordered two burgers medium well. It took well over half an hour to get while those around us were getting their food after coming in and ordering a little over 10 minutes after us. My burger was over cooked, my mom's was nearly rare and the side was completely wrong. The only thing we could figure was they forgot to fire her food and tried to do it in a hurry while mine sat in a warming tray. The did comp us the rare burger, but it still wasn't worth the expense of going there. There are better restaurants all over the front range, save your money and go to one of them."
Gregg P.,"Windsor, CO",0,2,,2.0,8/25/2014,"First time here.  Nice setting and we really enjoyed the outside dining area.  Ordered our drinks and the Artichoke Spinach dip appetizer.  First thing was the drink was wrong and the appetizer was late getting out, and then cold enough it required being sent back.  We also ordered our main course, one of the hamburgers with fries and mine was the shrimp pasta dish w/ a Caesar salad requested before the meal.  Waited quite a while and ended up getting my salad with my meal.  AFTER the meal was served we received the appetizer back.  The hamburger and shrimp were both quite good but the rest not so much.  Never offered an apology for anything being wrong.  Not sure we will be going back for a while."
Patrick H.,"Fort Collins, CO",1,4,2,2.0,8/24/2014,"I think from the reviews your experience can be hit or miss at BJs. Unfortunately, for my son and I it was a miss.   Waited forever at the table to be approached for drink order and our food order.  Waiter forgot about us repeatedly during the evening and did not seem particularly busy.   Had to ask other servers for help.   The menu is huge which can either be a plus or a minus.   They have lots of options but do nothing exceptional.   We have been twice before but I think BJs has finally burned us out."
Dan P.,"Denver, CO",5,250,,2.0,4/3/2014,Meh.  Food is mediocre quality.  And it seems that management is forcing their servers to keep upselling and pushing more stuff on the diners.   Not a huge fan.
Steven D.,"Hubbard, OH",1,55,15,3.0,9/24/2013,"I stopped here last evening for dinner. Had the house root beer, Calamari, and the hand tossed (their version of thin crust) three pepperoni pizza. I had a server named Autumn who did a good job keeping my drink full and helping answer some questions I had about the menu. The food response time from the kitchen was very good. In fact the pizza came out so fast I am not sure how they did it so fast and still cooked it so crispy. The Calamari was alright and the pizza was pretty good except all of the pepperoni made it a little too salty for my taste. All of this was at a pretty decent price since I was there during happy hour and the food items I had were half price. I will probably go back at some point because I noticed some things on the menu that looked interesting. If I were to have the three peperoni pizza again, I would have them hold some of the pepperoni and add mushrooms to make the pizza a little less salty."
Sherry P.,"El Cajon, San Diego, CA",0,10,11,3.0,8/13/2014,Went there last night. Ordered a spaghetti with marinara sauce. Sauce was very good however the noodles were overcooked and mushy. Also seemed like perhaps the noodles were left in the open air too long after being removed from the water. The service was so-so. The waitress forgot that i didn't want ice in my water when she came by to refill my cup. Not too big a deal but slightly annoying. Perhaps I'll try them again later.
Pinky P.,"Louisville, CO",0,29,8,5.0,4/27/2015,"Awe bummer this place only gets 3 stars, that should change. Friendly attentive front staff, Christina was my bartender. She was very knowledgeable, considerate, made me feel very welcome & fast service. I would highly recommend BJ's in Fort Collins to anyone!! Great wings!"
David S.,"Denver, CO",25,16,4,4.0,4/7/2014,Great service. Ordered a pizza for take out and the gave me a complimentary drink while I waited . Pizza was in the oven for a bit to long though.
