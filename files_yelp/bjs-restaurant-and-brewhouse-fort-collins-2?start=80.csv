Ashley H.,"Windsor, CO",84,202,43,4.0,12/15/2013,"Pizookies! Oreo, peanut butter, regular... who can resist a warm cookie with ice cream & whipped cream?"
Laura E.,"Fort Collins, CO",0,10,,2.0,8/28/2014,"Meh is right.  Mediocre food, overpriced.  Don't bother with the salad unless you are a big fan of iceberg lettuce.  Other food is all right, but nothing special.  Service is spotty -- have had great and terrible.  BJ's is not on our list any more."
Mike M.,"Denver, CO",20,20,95,4.0,12/21/2013,"I really enjoy the atmosphere here. The servers all seem friendly and the pizza is always a good choice. I enjoy their beer selection, but it's hard to compete with all the local breweries here in foco. Our serve only talked to us twice while we were there and that was to get our order and pay the check. No refills. No, how everything tasting.. oh well. I've had better servers there before, so I won't let that get to me. I enjoy their different varieties of pizza. And thus far I haven't had anything other than their pizza. Maybe next time I'll get a real entree. They just are so pricy! I really enjoy when they have two person deals happening. Great place for a date when that's goin on!"
Adelina L.,"Fort Collins, CO",0,6,,1.0,8/12/2015,Went here for a celebratory dinner and the service and food was absolutely terrible. I've been to this restaurant 3 times and each time it's the same nothing ever improves. We were thankful for a waiter nearby that helped make it better as we were leaving. I complained to the manger who basically did nothing he didn't even come over to the table and apologize and  after I complained he ran and hid. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone.
Catherine S.,"Loveland, CO",3,8,,1.0,7/4/2013,"This Place needs to get it together, big time! We arrived and there was a long wait, about a half hour...we were thinking it must be good if everyone would wait this long. Once seated a very cheerful wait staff server took our order... Then the madness started... We watched in horror as the wait staff scrambled around us running, dropping and forgetting things...it was unbelievable as this is suppose to be a professional establishment and they just  couldn't handle a full house, that was a bad sign right there! I almost felt sorry for them....until it took them 45 minutes to get our drinks that were not good and another 45 minutes after to get our burned entrees... It seemed as though it could have been a good sandwich under all that charcoaled bread...and so amazing that it actually left the kitchen like that...and we were told they didn't have a dinning room manager that night, but a kitchen one...go figure!...no excuse!....none the less it was an unpleasant experience..... We were so hungry by then we had to eat so we wouldn't pass out from the hunger as we couldn't possibly have wait another hour to have them fix them!....plus when we told our server, she said she would be right back and didn't show up till fifteen minutes later to try and fix the problem. I was actually shocked  when we got our bill of $68. ( this place is not cheap ) and they didn't comp the burned sandwiches, it was their mistake! and we had to pay for it!!...I call that obnoxious! Amazing as most decent places would have taken it off the bill....and to make people wait that long for their food on top of it all! They were very much aware that people were waiting a long time and apologized! but still the real apology to me would have been to comp the food they ruined! I shared this with our neighbors only to find that they too had a similar experience. Bottom line....it took over an hour and a half to get our Burned entrees, 45 minutes to get our drinks...which were too sweet and syrupy BTW...we ordered the ( root beer ) and my Husband the margarita...our son had water ( which is the safest thing there so far )...anyway it was just the three of us so three drinks and they couldn't handle it! Burned food, charging us extra for someone else's beer, not comping your own mistakes...BJ's need to get it together, this should Never Happen to anyone! Also I had to add this...They profess on their website a quality Promise to their customers...will they broke it!!! Bj's deservers NO STARS from us for this experience!"
Erin N.,"Timnath, CO",16,10,15,2.0,7/5/2013,"The food has been great every time we have eaten here ( 5 times since they opened the beginning of June) What I don't understand is that the service has gone WAY downhill every time we go. The last time I left ANGRY. Their service is terrible, and they need to get their act together fast! I also don't understand about the 13 filtered reviews below that have experienced the same situation. I could go into more detail about our last experience but it just makes me mad all over again....pretty much a train wreck!"
Anthony S.,"Reno, NV",1,15,62,1.0,4/18/2015,"Best place for slow service, over cooked steak served cold and overcooked under seasoned Brussels sprouts. It's really sad when you have to wait for a fork to eat your dinner, because you ordered a salad and they only wrap one fork in the place setting. But the waitress is really nice and sincere."
Mark M.,"Fort Collins, CO",1,19,,1.0,8/12/2013,"It is amazing to me how many of BJ's negative reviews have seemed to disappear. If the flagged reviews had stayed on here, this place would surely only have one star. Terrible food, robotic like service and a poor management team wrap this place up in a few words."
Phillip G.,"Hagerstown, MD",23,86,105,4.0,10/22/2013,"This location is very new, I can only assume that the low reviews are due in part to that. My visit was terrific! Ashley was very friendly, new the beers and the menu. My pork chop was cooked perfectly and the over all meal was a good value."
Jeff J.,"Fort Collins, CO",99,36,8,3.0,10/17/2013,"Food is good, pumpkin beer is good, kitchen service is horrible. Out of our 15 or so visits they have never once got our orders right. The servers do a decent job of trying to hold things together though. The floor managers are completely disengaged. Such a love\hate relationship with this place."
Alexander S.,"Fort Collins, CO",4,2,4,5.0,7/3/2013,"The pizookie's alone, are worth checking out! They offer a very open menu of choices, like hamburger's, pizza's, pasta's, etc. If you're looking for a nice atmosphere, good service and good food, then this place is a must check out! If you're looking for something new and different, I'd look elsewhere. Every person will have a different experience here, but I recommend checking this place out!!"
Sandra P.,"Fort Collins, CO",22,4,,2.0,4/19/2015,$9.75 for a glass of wine???  Really????  Next time I'll go somewhere else.  And be sure you pass on those avocado rolls.  Mushy.
Moody F.,"Fort Collins, CO",0,15,,3.0,11/9/2013,"It took me a while to get through their menu to write an honest review. Frankly the menu is so big that I don't believe they'll ever find success in serving good food. I will share the bad and good, in that order.  The bad: - Please avoid anything fried. I ordered the fish tacos.. no these were not tempura or lightly battered as the wait staff suggested, it was so heavily battered that the friend batter was 3 to 1 ratio to actual fish meat. Same with the cheese sticks.. I couldn't even finish eating them.  -The pizza, their specialty.. really disappointing. The appetizer pizza was so greasy, the deep dish was disgusting, and a ""thin crust"" (NOT thin crust) that was on special  was ok and tasty.. but 1 out of 3... not so hot to trot.  -The BBQ special... for months.. dry and not seasoned that well.  -The burgers are ok - not great, not terrible.  -The pasta was dry.  Really... it's hard to mess up pasta and they did. -Seriously it takes over 10 minuets to get a drink. I've gotten in the habit of ordering two at once so I stop being pissed off at the wait time. -Food delivery timing. RECOMMENDATION: Do NOT order dinner until 10 mins before you want it. I guarantee you it will arrive 2 mins after the appetizers get there if you do not heed this rule. This is a pet peeve of mine. The good: (Healthy food!) -I ordered the fish, after above I must have been drunk to think it a good idea. I took my first bite, looked at my husband and said they screwed up and cooked it right!  The fish was PERFECTLY cooked, delicious, and I can say they do it right on a regular basis as I've ordered it a few times.  -The appetizers are good, I highly recommend the chicken lettuce wraps. They are messy and are the best appetizer we think after trying them all.  -The mixed drinks, even though they take forever are well made. I recommend the wild-berry mojito... holy cow that is super delicious in you're in a sweet mood. -The salads. When i ordered my first salad I was seriously taken back when they plate came with shredded lettuce. I thought it was burger lettuce. But the way the salad was put together it worked in perfect harmony with the other ingredients. I was surprised and corrected about my notion that shredded lettuce didn't belong in (some) salads."
B. D.,"Honolulu, HI",0,62,10,1.0,2/22/2014,"BJs- A lackluster brewpub chain much akin to Rock Bottom, tho less impressive.  Visited for an early dinner on Thurs 20-Feb. My first visit to a BJ's since the La Jolla, CA, location in 2012. A young, inexperienced server left us waiting multiple instances, even though we were one of just 3-4 tables in his area. He also brought us extra, overly-sized dishes which there was absolutely no room for on our small table, dropped them off and walked away.  $25 bill = ""Enlightened Thai Mango Chicken Salad,"" Roasted Vegetable Flatbread Pizza, and a 5oz flute taster of ""BJ's house-brewed PM Porter."" The $13 Thai salad was worth $6-7, included very little of the ingredients advertised (mango, chicken, pepper) and arrived poorly presented - only fluffed up spinach topped with a slimy slab of avo appeared to be in the bowl. Roasted veg flatbread pizza was alright - it's roughly a 4""x12"" thin-crust pizza. The porter sample was enjoyable. A fairly flavorful American Porter, balanced chocolate flavor and very fine head... but I waited way too long for it to arrive. Large dining room, nice decor... the restroom was jazzy, hooray! -But nobody was there to rub my shoulders while I was at the urinal, boo. Also, the entrance is oriented away from the majority of the parking lot, which means if you approach from the way where you THINK the entrance would be, you wind up walking around more than half of the building, which was especially more annoying in inclement weather. This place has the potential of about two-stars, that's about it... We will be canceling our reservations for their upcoming March beer pairing dinner, and WILL NOT RETURN."
Dave S.,"Johnstown, CO",1,2,,2.0,1/24/2015,"Went at 3 on Saturday and had to wait for a table while there were plenty open.  The service was sub par and bitter (had to wait 20 minutes for 2 beers... in a BREWERY!!!) Beer tasted like bad home brew, and the food portions were small and over priced.  I will stick with Rock Bottom."
Christopher S.,"Fort Collins, CO",10,6,,5.0,7/15/2013,"We visited on 7/14 for my wife's birthday. I called ahead for seating and was pleasantly surprised that our table with high chair was completely ready to go on our arrival time. We had Courtney as our server and she was delightful. Very easy going and was always prompt with service. I had the Mahi Mahi fish tacos and I really enjoyed them. Everyone else in my party enjoyed their food as well. It was a very nice, low-key dinner. The food was great, the service was excellent and all of our beers and mixed drinks were spot on. My wife received a complimentary Peanut Butter Pizookie and it was delicious. We've enjoyed the Boulder location in the past and so far this store hasn't disappointed. For the people who had a bad experience, there's no excuse for that on their end, but I would say you could chalk some of it up to growing pains since this location is still brand new."
Tom S.,"Fort Collins, CO",0,4,,4.0,11/21/2013,"Great beer, the burger was great and kids enjoyed their sodas.  The family and I will be back."
M S.,"Louisville, CO",0,5,,3.0,2/6/2015,"We decided to try this place after driving by it frequently and being curious. I wasn't all that impressed. We started with the potato wedges appetizer and were extremely disappointing. There was not near enough toppings on them and we ate hardly any. My pork chop dinner was $16 and it was the most dry and tasteless pork chops I have ever had. The deep dish lasagna was good, and the house made root beer was also very good. The server didn't clear a single dish and we found ourselves stacking our plate ourselves to get them out of our way. I"
CJ J.,"Fort Collins, CO",0,66,,3.0,8/21/2013,"Used to love going to the one in Oxnard (also went to one in San Diego area a few times), so we were pretty excited to see one come into Fort Collins. The food and beer is good and it's a comfortable environment."
Cherie K.,"Fort Collins, CO",87,16,,1.0,6/30/2013,"there really should be a way to give ""no stars"" on this....just for this restaurant.  Compared to the other reviews, there was absolutely no wait for two people at around 1p.m. on a Saturday afternoon...however, we now wish that there had been, as it may have saved us time and money that we wasted on this place.  We started out with Bonesless Buffalo Wings, which were o.k. and could have gotten much cheaper elsewhere.  When we placed our order, the waiter acted like we had three heads, when my husband ordered a hamburger according to his dairy allergy.  His exact quote was, "" ALL YOU WANT, is a hamburger with pickles and bacon?""  He gave my pizza to the guy behind us, his to someone else and I got someone else's entirely.  It took FOREVER to get the food.  My husband got their specialty sodas and it was disgusting....syrupy and super sweet with virtually no carbonation.  $40 later, for lunch for two people.....we were disappointed."
