Doyle H.,"Fort Myers, FL",35,194,5,4.0,10/31/2017,"I did not realize that BJ's was a chain! A chain I'd never heard of. A group of us, complete with wee-ones, decided to give them a try for dinner.  We were lucky to draw and experienced waiter, who was friendly, efficient, and knowledgeable. He kept making regular sweeps to keep drinks topped off and to see if we needed anything. Only once did he have to be reminded about a drink order from the bar. Not bad! He also made some really good menu suggestions based on his personal experience.  I tried the chicken parm, which turned out to be a generous enough portion to make for a good lunch the next day. The dish was quite delicious and cooked perfectly.  All things considered, this visit met or exceeded expectations. Enough so, that I visited on a second occasion.  The next visit was for a late lunch, and we ordered a pizza - Chicago style deep dish. It was good, but very doughy, but that's to be expected with this style. It was quite good, even the leftovers the next day.  The wait staff on this trip was less than enthusiastic. Absent for most of the meal, we were taken care of upon request, but this waitress could have used a bit more OTJ experience. Quite alright... she'll get there! I still chalk it up as a good visit.  I'll continue to visit BJ's. The staff is good, and the food quality is too. Prices aren't bad, and on-par for the area. As a matter of fact, I'll probably be there tonight! (Their kiddie menu is pretty good as well.)"
Mark M.,"Niagara Falls, NY",136,1018,6165,5.0,6/17/2017,"Went here for dinner yesterday and had a wonderful experience. We ordered wings, a bacon cheeseburger, and Mediterranean chicken tacos with salad. Everything tasted great, especially the salad and the tacos, super fresh. The burger has lots of cheese and bacon.  Our server was really friendly and the decor was great with the murals and tall ceilings.  Can't wait to go back and try more dishes!"
Go B.,"Ann Arbor, MI",0,30,8,1.0,1/2/2018,"Went here on a Tuesday. Had a 15 minute wait to be seated even though there many, many open tables. Place was a comedy of errors combined with a mix of lackluster and some okay food. Only gave us tableware for 4 even though we had 5 in our party. Didn't tell us that they were out of the sirloin steak until after tried to order it. Instead of steak ordered a burger. Oh by the way, do we want fries with that? Hopefully not cuz those weren't available either. Forget to let us know about that on the front end too.  Three meals came out while two had to wait about ten minutes for our soup and salad to come out. My daughter had to send her bacon cheeseburger back three times because of kitchen errors...and finally gave up and said no thanks.  Empty salad bowls and soup bowls sat on the table while the waitress walked by interacting with her fancy tablet used to place orders....too bad the tablet doesn't update about unavailable food. Ordered dessert. Waitress came back 10 minutes later to say they were out of ones of the desserts we ordered. On the positive side, they did comp the other dessert that they did have in stock. We were sorry we choose this place for dinner. Won't happen again."
Jamie P.,"Naples, FL",104,13,,4.0,12/21/2017,"Decent food, good beer. Sometimes a bit noisy and busy, but a solid place to grab some food and drink with friends."
Kathy A.,"North Scituate, RI",0,18,,2.0,12/30/2017,This was second visit. First time was good. This time wasn't. Server was blah at best. Came back after drinks were long gone. Food took over 45 minutes to get. The meals were lukewarm. At this point just wanted to get out. Almost $100 and not worth 1/2 that. Would not recommend
Bill H.,"Naples, FL",37,409,35,4.0,6/24/2017,"When there's more than 10 beers on tap to try I'm a fan.  Wanting a change after a long day of shopping we headed to BJ's.  We were quickly seated with a friendly attitude.  On my way to the restroom, I noticed the wall full of all the beers available so I had to comeback and check the beers after a quick pit stop.  I decided to do the sampler to I could try at least four beers and topped them off with the Peruvian Quinoa w/shrimp.  I enjoyed the dish.  I'll be back to try the other 67 beers."
Jonathan W.,"Cape Coral, FL",292,229,121,4.0,2/18/2017,For a chain this place has good offerings. Just wish dessert offerings were more than the cookie.
Chris M.,"Cape Coral, FL",10,21,70,4.0,12/29/2016,"You enter to soft music and soft lighting with a rustic feeling. Reviewing the numerous draft beer selection so many we had to sample. With a final choice of Berry Bristol Cider and Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale.  The menu is large with so many options to choose from, maybe too many options. Our final picks are the Barbecue Bison Burger that came out cook to order perfectly, and the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Taco from the light menu. For only 700 Cal. low calories and still full of flavor. The best of both worlds. The cost for the beer is a little steep 6 dollars plus, the food is reasonably priced. No deserts tonight to report on sorry."
Matt P.,"Estero, FL",41,107,193,4.0,7/29/2016,I stopped in for happy hour today. I saw they had half off mini deep dish pizzas so I had to give this place a try. The pizza wasnt exactly what I call deep dish. This was more like a pizza hut personal pan pizza. The toppings were on the top. When I got deep dish in Chicago the sauce was on top and it covered everything. Now even though I went on that little rant i have to say it was really good. I got the bj pizza which basically had everything on it. I also tried a bison burger. That was also pretty good but bison isn't usually as good as a normal burger in my opinion. This burger was on par with other bison burgers I have tried. The fries that came with it were good. Thin with a nice coating of breading. For dessert I got the pizookie. I had no idea what that was before I got there. It is basically ice cream on some kind of baked sweet. I got the one with monkey bread. This was amazing.  The hot monkey bread with the melting ice cream on top mixed together perfectly.
Chris H.,"Boca Raton, FL",99,142,45,5.0,12/20/2016,"My first time at a BJs Restaurants. Great tap list. Had the avocado rolls and the chicken bacon ranch pizza. Both were excellent. Service was great at the bar, and a decent crowd for a Tuesday night. Seasonal Grand Cru Belgian style ale is not to be missed. But hurry, it won't last. Servers tell me this is a chain with most of its restaurants in California and Florida. Beer is brewed in Lakeland (FL) and Nevada. Lots of people on dates, and it seems like a good place for it."
David D.,"Cape Coral, FL",20,67,40,4.0,6/4/2017,Great service! Decent appetizers. Pass on bison burgers and cole slaw. Prime rib french dip was very good along with the full slab of ribs. Cold draft selection was plentiful. Good choice for a nice weekend lunch.
TJ M.,"Mid-City, San Diego, CA",1,25,8,3.0,10/3/2017,"This is my second time eating at this location, my first experience was much better.  We are a party of 12 so please keep that in mind.  We were eated quickly which was awesome given the size of our party. Our server was very pleasant but our food was very slow to arrive as were our bills. I ordered the fettuccine alfredo and I was very disappointed, there was almost no sauce on my pasta. I did ask for parmesean cheese to enhance the pasta, but I needed to ask two employees before I received any. The others in the party had decent food but none raved about their meal. I would come here again with a group but I would not select this restaurant on my own."
Michael J.,"Toronto, Canada",9,18,26,2.0,10/1/2017,"Stopped by this restaurant to grab lunch. The restaurant was somewhat busy with people watching Sunday football.  The menu has lots to choose from. I was looking for something simple and got the chicken club sandwich.  If you're looking for a light sandwich, this is not it. The avocado and lettuce were nice. The bacon was alright, but I ended up removing the half of it from my sandwich. The picture in the menu shows a whole piece of chicken. What I ended up getting was diced chicken breast. The sandwich was described as ""grilled sourdough bread""; the bread was probably buttered on both side and grilled a la grilled cheese style so it ended up being too greasy. This chicken club reminded me more of the chicken avocado club at the Cheesecake Factory. I would have preferred a sandwich less heavy and less oily. I have had similar but better sandwiches.  Also didn't care for the fries that accompanied the sandwich. Too oily and heavily fried."
Principal O.,"Fort Myers, FL",1,62,24,4.0,5/31/2017,"Brought new diners to BJs for a repeat visit. It didn't disappoint! Our choices that really hit the mark were: BBQ Bison Burger; and Parmesan Crusted Chicken (with OUTSTANDING mashed potatoes). The avocado egg roll appetizer was rather bland...ok but not overly impressive, although the dipping sauce was very good. The Peruvian Quinoa with Shrimp rated a ""very good"" by one of our party, but she thought it had a lemony taste that was a bit overwhelming. The side of Turmeric-Roasted Cauliflower was perfect! I loved the side of Sauteed Garlic Spinach & Kale, but other tasters were not as enamored. Ambience was great, seating was comfortable, service was excellent and very attentive. Can't wait to return :)"
Stephanie K.,"Fort Myers, FL",239,92,148,3.0,1/25/2016,"Came here for dinner on a Saturday night during season, I expected a wait so that wasn't a big deal. Luckily, the waitress let us know that a table was opening up in the bar area, which is open seating! Thanks for letting us know!  Our waiter was nice enough and friendly enough. Dinner was okay, the only shining star was the sriracha Brussels sprouts,a new menu starter item. They were delicious! I ordered a bacon cheeseburger and it was cooked great. Everyone I was with got a pizza and it looked delicious -- they also said as much. Why such a low rating you might ask? Service was slow, I know it was a Saturday night but by the time we got our dinner it was close to 9:15 and quite a few open tables. I don't think that justifies our table sitting there with empty water glasses.  Also the food was okay, nothing spectacular. That could have been me -- ordering a cheeseburger and all. I will probably be back to try something else, as well as the dessert-- I heard that was fabulous!"
Eileen W.,"Punta Gorda, FL",0,5,1,4.0,4/18/2017,House salad - great ! Tomato soup very tasty !  House Cabernet - perfect House Margarita - Ole !! Tiffany- Server - friendly &  efficient service  Menu selection - something for everyone !! Asian chopped salad & pizza - will order again !!! We will be back !!
Darren E.,"Lake Worth, FL",28,11,4,5.0,8/21/2017,"Walked over from the Drury hotel for a evening cocktail this past Saturday night. My wife and I sat at the bar and had a nice conversation with Caleb P. She was easy and went for a beer while I was craving a whiskey. Caleb enjoys a good old fashioned also and suggested a Angels Envy old fashioned. Well, excellent suggestion Caleb!! Very well done!!"
Tiffany D.,"Estero, FL",89,180,217,4.0,7/30/2016,My new favorite word is pizookie...I will be dreaming about that dessert for awhile. My husband loves pizza and he heard about the happy hour of half off mini personal pizzas so we decided to check it out. If you love beer this place is for you!! They have a huge selection of beers.  My husband got a mini personal pizza and I got a bison burger. Everything was great and the atomosphere was fun. The star was the monkey bread pizookie. Yelp has a coupon for a free appetizer or pizookie. They have a myriad of flavors. We got monkey bread and it was hot with ice cream on top. Amazing!!!!! This is definitely a youthful fun hangout with above average bar food. Ill be back in two months when i can have a beer!!!
Tia D.,"Fort Myers, FL",17,3,,3.0,8/25/2017,Food is amazing......take out is great......but don't go in and eat at a busy time unless you're a large party because you will be ignored
Dolores S.,"Bonita Springs, FL",1,9,2,4.0,11/5/2017,Loved our dinner at the brew house last night.  Vibrant and fun place to go. Our service was great. Stevie was fun and attentive. His recommendation was very good. We will go back.
Debra K.,"Urban Estates, Naples, FL",13,4,,3.0,8/12/2017,"My family and I went there last night for dinner. I did call ahead seating and we were promptly seated when we arrived. Our waiter was the best, very attentive and on his game. The food however was very disappointing ! My daughter had the Mahi-mahi and Shrimp entree which looked more like a soup because it was swimming in sauce. I got the Chicken Parmesan it can room temperature. Broccoli cold and potatoes room temp as well. Desert was the hilght, awesome pasuki's!! Have been here before and was very happy but this time something was off, I'd be checking on your chef!!"
Mike A.,"Sebastian, FL",33,5,,2.0,7/29/2017,Service was spot on but the liquor was watered down and calamari was over cooked. Not very impressive!
Tim D.,"Evansville, IN",0,31,,4.0,7/7/2017,"This place has lots of options. 5 adults, 2 kids, all satisfied.  The brisket burger was pretty good. Could have used more sauce. Most of their burgers include bacon.  The parmesan encrusted chicken was really good.  Pizza is thin crust and delicious.  Loaded wedges didn't have much bacon on them.  Kids had chicken fingers (crispy and delicious) and corn dogs (nothing to write home about, skip those).  The dessert ice cream cookie was really rich and chocolatey. (68)"
Megan M.,"Fort Myers, FL",32,10,12,4.0,4/29/2017,1st time visit and both my husband I overall enjoyed and will def go back.  We arrived about 2ish on a Saturday.  We were promptly greeted with a smile and seated.  Waiter was friendly and mostly on top of our refills...though it took a bit longer then one would think with only having a few tables.  Food was of great quality... I had the stuffed mushroom appetizers and the Mediterranean Chicken Pitas served with a healthy side of cold mix grains and quinoa. Great mix of flavors. Husband had the brisket burger which was well prepared and on a tasty bun.  We will def be back.  Would have given 5 stars but they were out of both drafts I wanted to sample and refill service was slow.
Linda L.,"Ironton, OH",0,8,2,2.0,1/31/2017,"We looked forward to eating here last night. We do not have a B.J.'s near our hometown and have had good food there when traveling.  Our server was pleasant and prompt. Our food arrived quickly. However, no one checked back with us until my husband had almost completely finished his large serving of spaghetti and meatballs.  I had the roast beef au jus sandwich. It had a very ""chemical"" taste. It was served with a creamy horseradish sauce and au jus. I tried both and neither altered the fact that something was off with the beef. I ate all of the fries to ward off starvation. When our server finally returned and noticed I had eaten almost none of the sandwich, she asked how our food was. I told her I did not care for the sandwich which had an off taste. She said something which I couldn't understand and left the table.  She reappeared later with no mention of the former discussion and presented the check.  I understand not everyone likes every dish they order, but...to completely ignore a guest's displeasure is no way to keep a patron's business.  I am very sorry I didn't order the flatbread which I had in the past and loved.  A visit from the manager to show ANY concern would have been all that was necessary.  Apparently they don't care if they retain customers. I am one who won't return."
Richard E.,"Lehigh Acres, FL",0,25,,2.0,2/3/2017,"Man. When this place first opened, I was so excited. The concept and environment is great, this restaurant not so much. I have been 4 times and the experience keeps getting worse. Once we waited an hour just to get our drinks and the staff told us its because he was the only person working. (it was Friday night and 40ish people were there). Every time we ask to see a manager, a billion excuses fly up. The food has been okay, though if you aren't coming for the pizza everything is a bit more costly than deserved by the quality."
Jennifer M.,"Barrington, NJ",41,84,146,4.0,2/11/2016,"Stopped in for lunch, they have a huge menu.  There are a lot of beers, drinks, & a ton of food. I had the clementine smash, it was light & refreshing.   I got the lunch size chicken, spinach quinoa bowl.  The chicken was tiny, the sautéed spinach, tomatoes, red onion were very good.  The chicken lettuce wrap appetizer was tasty but the lettuce they served with it was huge & not very appealing.  It was also wet, like they had just washed it and put it on the plate.  The service was good, but a little slow."
Suzanne A.,"Fort Myers, FL",26,120,22,1.0,12/30/2016,"Must've been really shorthanded today, the female (long dark hair) bartender could Not make a lemon drop and the service was really slow. We're there around 3:30 and it was not that busy. This post is not just about 'a drink'... it's about Standards and poor management . Waitress was nice but slow...bartender sent the same glass right back ( sugar water w a lemon wedge) nothing different, could tell by missing sugared rim...Don't play me miss :(.  Food was less than mediocre... will not be wasting my money or be going back to this BJ's."
Lenee P.,"Frankfort, KY",121,16,9,5.0,1/19/2017,"One of my favorite first stops when in Ft. Myers! Gluten free pizza is awesome and I eat gluten all the time, but love that thin crust! Baked ziti is also a great meal, but you must have one of the cookies for dessert- what a treat!"
Yoanna J.,"Fort Myers, FL",188,136,941,3.0,5/24/2016,"I have to say I am now a regular, I am OBSESSED!! With the Jalapeño Margarita in addition I am going to start backwards with the mouth watering dessert Pizookie I had the Salted Carmel and Cookies and Cream. OH SO GOOD!! The personal pizza deep dish Chicago style was real good. But when I went back and ordered the larger size did not care for it at all wayyyy to doughy and did not taste well at all, even when they cooked it longer, so won't be ordering that again. On the shareable appetizer the chicken lettuce wraps, the lettuce was a little over kill and then they give you a small bowl of the sautéed mushrooms, water chestnuts, celery, green onions to open with wontons mine was soaked so no need for the side of the soy sauce. I then had the California chicken club that was very good that I definitely will be ordering again. The applewood bacon  melted into the cheddar cheese the garlic aioli taste in the sourdough bread the chicken was moist. My daughter had the Shrimp and Asparagus Penne tossed with Marinara she said was delicious. Happy Eating"
Lisa D.,"Fort Myers, FL",0,16,2,3.0,3/3/2017,"They have a great selection of beer, a good menu with a mix of food types (bar food, burgers, steaks, pasta, etc) but service at a bar table was very slow and they block internet, requiring connection to their network which was super slow."
Juliet N.,"Cape Coral, FL",208,177,33,4.0,7/5/2016,"Good selection of beers, many options for their own brand as well. Food was tasty and service was friendly. The brussel sprout appetizer was a hit, as was the grilled cheese with added bacon. The bread was buttery and cooked perfectly, it really hit the spot. The sandwiches come with skinny, crunchy fries which I really enjoyed."
Nicole A.,"Naples, FL",0,11,8,5.0,4/2/2017,"One of my favorite places for awesome beer, great food and fantastic service... I can't say enough great things about this place other then Ashley is super awesome too!! Thanks for the continuous great time!!!"
Lee L.,"Orlando, FL",0,10,,5.0,8/1/2017,"I am giving this place 5stars because I want it to stay open forever. Came here after the gym for the first time with my husband and was pleasantly surprised at their mix of super healthy food and good comfort food with some interesting combinations, (i.e.: fried chicken-alfredo-bacon-ham-waaaaaaa??!?! Friggin delicious...). They also have good beer prices and were superquick with our order. My husband even said he wanted to go to the gym more so we can eat here. He's super picky about pizza and loves their light and fluffy crust on their deep dish, said it didn't make him feel bloated. Anyway, this place kicks ass."
George B.,"Fort Myers, FL",0,64,,4.0,5/15/2017,"Split into 2 areas, we choose a high-top near their huge bar instead of a traditional sit-down table. It's a busy place serving regular pub fare including a wide selection of gluten-free dishes. Smiles continued throughout the meal both on our faces and those of 2 different servers. Fast, fresh and comfortable are good descriptions of this establishment. I had seared ahi tuna while others at the table went with barbeque salmon, fish and chips and asian salad. The presentations were mouth-watering, but the taste was even better. The place felt like an independently Chef-run restaurant, not part of a chain. Well done."
L L.,"Washington, DC",0,101,178,4.0,5/20/2016,"Chelsea is super Friendly and welcomes you with great smile and genuine enthusiasm  Few in this area seem to realize how important it is to have great first impression and welcome when we chose a place to dine  I appreciate the genuine welcome, smiles and great attitude The alternative of no smiles, bored looks and acting as if confused about why they receive $ from the Restaurant is frustrating and quite frankly old  Jenna is also super friendly and attentive as Server  Please acknowledge Chelsea and Jenna  with high 5, gift card and or raise  I was disappointed to be charged extra for ""Free"" Substitute of few pieces artichokes for Grilled Chicken. No way is 1/3 of an artichoke on 4 inch pizza MORE than chicken which was priced with the personal pizza.  It is principle and I did ask what they would sub free instead of Grilled Chicken. Otherwise very good experience and early dinner. Please lower happy hour wine prices. $10 a glass! You would sell a lot more in $3-$5 glass price point  Thanks  Cheers!"
Lauralee K.,"Richmond, VA",0,12,,4.0,3/9/2017,Went for a late lunch before flying home. Food was pretty good. Unfortunately our server lacked any personality. Not sure if he was having a bad day or what but couldn't get a smile out of him. Mother spilled a little of her drink and he didn't even try to help. I'm pretty forgiving so I'm just going to go with he was having a bad day. Try the ahi tuna poke! Delicious!
Jimmi C.,"Bonita Springs, FL",49,15,24,5.0,3/8/2017,"I had been to a BJ's and Oklahoma but I have not been to this location in Fort Myers until last night. From the moment we walked in the door the service was excellent. The girl working in the front was very friendly and accommodating. Our waiter was friendly and attentive. And finally, the food was hot, delicious and made quickly. We ordered calamari as an appetizer, salad and a chicken, bacon, ranch pizza. All were amazing! This restaurant is doing everything right!"
Kiki M.,"Sarasota, FL",0,1,,4.0,7/16/2017,"Had an excellent experience. When picking a restaurant I always look for those with good gluten free options and BJ's did not disappoint.  They had a separate gluten free menu with some good options including an excellent gluten free pizza and dessert options. Had the pizza and the kale and Brussel sprouts salad, both of which were yummy.  The waiter was helpful and knowledge about the food and assisted in my questions regarding gluten free alcohol options.  Did not get sick. Everyone was friendly and it was spacious and clean with TV's all around.  The only negative is that is was pricier than expected but would still give it high scores!"
Ignatius L.,"Naples, FL",39,92,71,2.0,5/19/2015,"We've tried BJ's twice. Both experiences were underwhelming. The beer selection is the best in the area. The ambiance is creative.  However, the food is pretty mediocre, with a pre-frozen, chain-restaurant feel to it. The burger was terrible the first time, and even worse the second time. When ordering, we basically begged the staff member to ask the cook to prepare ""medium."" They were extra-well done, hockey pucks. Which is too bad, considering burgers go so well with beer. You won't find any fresh or local ingredients in their cuisine. Also, while the staff is friendly and effervescent, they're running around like their hair is on fire and the service is consequently awful.  I say stay away unless stopping at the bar for a beer."
