Don P.,"Naples, FL",0,1,,1.0,2/21/2015,Worst place ever!!! Still at dinner so far out of medium pizzas up charge to large no breaks out of sirloins up charge to ribeye no break blender broken no frozen drinks... Come on here this is a corporate place epic failure. Long time pro in the biz I feel so bad for the server who came to my table and had to say we don't have this 3 times so far wow!!! Extra tip for her because she didn't walk out ! Management holy stuff unacceptable haven't even done a table touch yet to apologize. I remember my first time
Tara A.,"Ogunquit, ME",49,42,14,3.0,11/30/2014,"Beautiful interior. TV screens everywhere. 40+ beers on tap. Lots to love. Great selection of food. However, the food really lacked flavor. Fish tacos were very bland and lacked any spice or kick. My sister orders scallops and said hers was not impressive either. Bland rice and very few scallops. Nachos were very disappointing because they are made with Fritos... It may have been my own fault for assuming they would be made with tortilla chips. Service was very very slow every thought it seems like waitresses only have 3 tables each and there are sooo many employees. I would go back here for the beer selection and to watch a game on TV. I would compare this place to Applebee's because of its laid back bar atmosphere, cheap well rounded menu, and good half price apps during happy hrs. Really just mediocre food though. Also the floor is extremely slippery!! Watch out hah"
Rick A.,"Bellmore, NY",0,13,,3.0,1/18/2015,"I wish I could give the review a higher rating but the service was lacking. I arrived with my family(4) and were immediately seated. Unfortunately, we were ignored and not acknowledged for at least 15 minutes at the table. After getting up and mentioning this to the hostess that sat us, it took another 10 minutes for a server to arrive. Mind you, others that arrived after us were waited on immediately. I finally ordered a beer with the server that took another 15 minutes to get. Our order for food at this point wasn't even taken yet. No one ever apologized for the lengthy wait. The food was decent pub food when it finally arrived but nothing special. Nice atmosphere with plenty of choices of craft beer but our experience may not have us coming back."
James S.,"Zionsville, IN",0,4,,1.0,4/2/2016,Terrible meal. Asked for burger medium well. Delivered very rare. Rather than complain I tried to eat around the edges. Finally asked server to take it back for more cooking. Finally returned with my remaining piece still under cooked. I wasn't finished with my potato which wasn't returned. No offers to replace or discount. No way to provide a great customer experience.
Jarrod K.,"Alva, FL",0,2,,1.0,6/27/2015,20 min wait and no even 75% occupied..server spilled drink and basically threw me napkins and expected me to clean her mess. Waited 30 min for a pizza and it wasn't the right one... Will stick to the ones in Columbus
Alex V.,"Fort Myers, FL",35,64,24,2.0,12/20/2014,Not a good night. I was asked if the Carnitas were mine 4 times. The severs were lost. I don't even like carnitas.
Luke P.,"Fort Myers, FL",18,6,,5.0,3/14/2015,Both the deep dish and tavern cut pizzas were great and the smores cookie desert thing was fantastic.
Hailey C.,"Naples, FL",0,4,1,5.0,4/18/2015,"It's really rare to give 5 stars, and even more rare at a chain restaurant, but Bjs was outstanding. Our server was David who was super efficient, accurate, and awesome! Definitely request him. And the ribs, kale salad, and jambalaya were all fantastic. Service was timely and all items were complete and hot! Definitely will be coming back."
Chris P.,"Bonita Springs, FL",1,9,,5.0,2/25/2016,"Love the menu.  Just ordered take-out, was ready when promised, and fully satisfying.  We eat in frequently, too.  We appreciate the healthy choices, but the abundant comfort food options are reassuring when we fall off the wagon.  Tons of tasty fermented hops & barley choices.  Five stars, all the way!"
Sher H.,"Columbus, OH",0,45,,3.0,11/3/2015,"We like BJ's Brewhouse a lot, but this was not our favorite one to go to. I ordered a cocktail from the specials menu on the table, and it took forever to come out because the server couldn't figure out what it was. I ordered two small plates and only received one of them. The gourmet mac and cheese is not good - it's very dry. I had to load it up with hot sauce. We've had better luck at other locations."
Tammy F.,"Brunswick, GA",83,11,11,4.0,6/26/2015,"Good selection of items and the food is very good. Try the BBQ salad and handcrafted root beers, YUM!"
Jeff M.,"Fort Myers, FL",5,2,,4.0,2/24/2016,Great place for a brew and good food. Great service with a friendly staff. Nice happy hour half price pizza.
Jeremy M.,"Fort Myers, FL",0,8,2,2.0,6/25/2015,"When I went the first time, the food was great. The next time I came to eat there, some thing happened. The food gave me a stomach ache the next day. I never went back again and never will go back ever again."
L. F.,"Cape Coral, FL",0,25,,4.0,11/23/2015,"We eat here with some regularity on the way to FGCU games.  They have great burgers, the pizza is good (though the deep dish version has a lot of bread - good or bad depending on your tastes), and interesting drinks.  Service is fast and appropriate.   They have a huge, huge menu so when we have taken guests they always find something good.  The only dish I was disappointed in was their Spaghetti and Meatballs, which was spiced in a strange way (though cooked properly and plentiful, others may like it).  Never had anything that was cooked improperly or lacked seasoning, never had bad service in many visits. Overall a good choice for a reasonably quick meal with lots of choices and reasonable prices."
Theresa R.,"Cape Coral, FL",4,16,3,5.0,2/15/2015,What a great experience. Emily our waitress was awesome. The roast beef French dip with au jues was out of this world. The flat bread pizza fanominal a d the have a large selection of beers on tO. We will definitely be back and soon.
Carlton C.,"Fort Myers, FL",0,57,6,2.0,2/25/2015,Great desert but piss poor service! Place was empty but slow! Food came out even slower.
Jose V.,"Cape Coral, FL",11,35,3,5.0,2/20/2015,The place is great had the jambalaya it was awesome . The kids like the pizza . I had a couple of Long Island I tea they where good
Maryvan N.,"Taylor, MI",287,28,130,1.0,6/7/2015,"WORST SERVICE EVER. I came here from Detroit because the one I went to was in sacramento, that one was amazing. My waiter did not want to serve me, he kept rolling his eyes at me, and gave me the most snotty attitude I have ever experience while dinning. ALL of the waiters and waitress did not have a smile serving you. From the moment that I walked in my server was giving me an attitude. He did not speak to me polity, did not say your welcome when I said thank you and when I asked for a refill his reply was ""yea I was already going to do that"" what waiter says that? And when I asked for a box my reply was ""k"" and walked away. Did not even check on my table until I was finished with my food. I am so furious at this restaurant. Maybe it's your managers also that has to do something about them. In all my life I have to say HANDS DOWN THE MOST HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE! Do not be surprised. My waiters name was James I could not stress how horrific it was."
Samantha B.,"Boca Raton, FL",144,2,1,4.0,4/6/2015,"The fried artichokes are delicious and the price is a steal! Very quick to seat us! Great service and very fast! The atmosphere is nice, especially if you like to keep up with your sports. Overall a very pleasant visit!"
James F.,"Fort Myers, FL",1,1,,5.0,2/16/2016,"Has become 1 of my favorite places to eat the staff is great always polite and friendly ,they have a very good selection of draft beers,the siracha brussel sprouts are awesome and everything I've tried on the menu has been excellent"
