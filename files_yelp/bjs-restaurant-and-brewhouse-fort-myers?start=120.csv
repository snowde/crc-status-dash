Adele S.,"Alva, FL",0,7,,5.0,2/16/2016,I love this restaurant. They have great food and that cookie dessert is to die for. Don't miss an opportunity to go there for a great meal. Adele
Lindsay S.,"Fort Myers, FL",196,4,,5.0,6/9/2015,"I have been here twice. The first time I met my parents for some appetizers before I had work and they were going to an FGCU basketball game. Since a game was about to start the restaurant was very busy, about a 45 min wait. We sat at the bar to avoid a wait, and the bartender could tell we were slightly hurried, but did not seem bothered by it and took care of us quickly and with a smile! As someone that used to work in a restaurant I know how annoying it can be to have people come in and say ""we're in a hurry"" but she did not seem bothered by it at all and i give her props for that. The appetizers were AWESOME. The second time I went with my boyfriend and we were seated right away. For being on a college budget, it was more expensive than what we usually spend on food but it was so worth it because our meals were so good. He had the lasagna and could not stop talking about how good it was. Thanks everyone at BJ's for good service & good food! Very pleasant experience, for a newer restaurant in GCTC (where there is alot of competition for dining) they are starting off extremely well!"
Linda A.,"LaBelle, FL",66,6,6,4.0,8/28/2015,Had avacado rolls and California Chicken Club... both were delish. Another plus... they have bottle Ultra if your not into craft beer.
Robert B.,"Clyde, NY",0,7,,1.0,2/19/2015,"The food is great. Big menu and lots of draft beer choices.  The service is terrible.  We waited for a half hour to get a beer, this after waiting at our table for 15 minutes to get the attention of a server.  We had to throw ourselves in front of a server walking by our table or I think we'd still be there.  The manager came by and apologized but it was way too little too late.  We were served half meals, no salads when they were ordered and seconds on drinks was out of the question even though we ordered them at the time we got our first round.  It may have just been our server but management did little to make it right when he had the chance.  Free drinks would have been nice."
Cindy S.,"Pisgah, OH",10,3,,4.0,10/2/2015,"We were looking for a lunch spot near the airport. Decided on BJ's. Greeted promptly and seated immediately. Julio, our server, was quick and efficient. I ordered the soup and salad which was unlimited. My husband ordered the Sante Fe salad. It was all delicious! The chicken tortilla soup was great! Would highly recommend this restaurant."
Michael Z.,"Fort Myers, FL",2,48,5,2.0,6/22/2015,"Well they couldn't keep it up as I had hoped. Went there for Father's Day yesterday. Food was mediocre.  Service was crappy. Two dishes were  cold. Our server's disposition can only be described as odd. Beer selection remains solid. Other than that choose someplace else nearby. You know, you would think that management would monitor employees and food quality."
Kevin B.,"Fort Myers, FL",0,28,2,3.0,1/25/2015,"This establishment is relatively new in the area so we decided to try it out for lunch on a busy Saturday afternoon.  We ordered iced teas, bacon cheeseburger and a pulled pork sandwich. Starting score of 5 stars became 4 immediately when drinks were served with unwrapped straws and the waitress was asked if they had wrapped straws and she looked and came back and said they didn't. No matter how clean you are, bartenders and servers touch dirty glasses, dishes, and utensils, they touch money, they touch pens that others have touched to sign their checks etc.  they shouldn't be touching a straw someone puts in their mouth.  Nuff said, let me stop preaching.  The waitress was understanding and looked for another option for me and we came up with bottled water so I was not without drink.  I appreciated her effort because she initially came back and said they had no bottled water but then she found a Perrier. Her service was excellent, quite attentive and caring.  The burger was actually quite well cooked and juicy and very tasty as were the shoestring fries. Kind of typical bar fare but very tasty. My friend liked his pulled pork sandwich but did comment the cole slaw was extremely dry and not that appetizing. A little extra mayo would go far.  4 went to 3 stars because the bathroom was in need of attention.. Overall we will probably return, it did have a nice family friendly atmosphere on a Saturday afternoon.  There were a lot of families present. I will have to remember to hit up my stash of wrapped straws before visiting and bring one with me."
Sean H.,"Fort Myers, FL",14,197,7,2.0,12/19/2014,"I will say the food was good.  Well the pizza was.  The potato skins didnt.  But the service was so shoddy it was offensive.  First off, going with former BJs employees even gave me a critique of lack of protocol (no one served us our pizza, which was requisite).  But even sans that, there was so much wrong with it.  Our silverware was obviously nasty, the hostess was overtly on her cell phone, in plain sight.  And when we revealed this to management, he was passive aggressive.  This was my first time at a BJs, and I really hope this location is the exception and not the rule."
Dippy D.,"Tampa, FL",0,7,,1.0,3/21/2015,"Being a seasonal resident, I visited BJs in Fort Myers for my first time as It was something new to the area that I had never been too before and was pretty excited to try some local crafts. It is very aesthetically pleasing when we walked in and has a menu to match. Alot of pizza but managed to find some nice salmon and salads. The hostess was cute but didn't seem like the most organized bunch. I hate to be the one complaining about service but upon being seated we must have waited at least 10 minutes to place out first round. We almost went to the bar but the menu kept us distracted.  Why it may have taken a while to be greeted for drinks it ended up taking even longer to receive them. We noticed that the older short haired blonde bartender didn't seem like he had much concern or priority for rest of the restaurants drinks (we sat at the bar table and had a front row view). The menu looked fantastic and we were excited to order, but it was definitely upsetting the time from sit down to ordering food was much longer then expected. We only had two round of drinks and we were excited to try more but our server hadn't given us much of an opportunity, being a ""brewhouse"" I was slightly disappointed.Upon delivery of the food we were salivating because the food playing was very tasty, how it looked, etc. But, our plates were extremely hot and the food was some what luke warm(typically a sign of being left In the window) but I usually like my food room temperature so I was fine with it, my partner not as much. We enjoyed most of the rest of the food but didn't feel wanted for dessert. The restaurant started filling up and we sat with empty plates and glasses for quite some time after our meal and just didn't feel welcome, even for a finishing round of drinks. We mentioned our food and experience as we left to management. We liked the idea of the place and food but just thought maybe they were short staffed or the such but management showed little concern if any. Claiming the restaurant is a ""laid back atmosphere"". Overall the food and kitchen look and taste great. But the lack of service even lead to the food quality diminishing when it was cold. Makes me upset to think my fresh food ""died"" in the window waiting to be delivered. I'd rate the food and beer a lot higher but the service lacked luster. I would have rated higher stars but with the lack of concern from the management perspective I couldn't see myself frequenting Bjs. I'll try again on day but maybe when the restaurant gets it together."
Cara C.,"Fort Myers, FL",6,1,,5.0,12/22/2014,"I signed up for yelp just to write this review because our experience was THAT GREAT!  We tried this restaurant for the first time right after they opened.  Our server was clearly new however she was very helpful and a server trainer was by her side.  We ordered the calamari and the avacado egg rolls.  Both appetizers were fresh, hot, and delicious!  My boyfriend got the Greek tacos, and I got a salad suggested by the server.  All the food was fantastic and the service from host to busser was polite and pleasant.  They even have an app that makes it easy to order ahead and pay right from your phone So...we went back and were not disappointed. We had Jason this time and he was friendly,  knowledgeable and there when we needed him...and here's where they really impressed us: we forgot two pairs of expensive sunglasses on the table!  Oops! And didn't realize it until the following day! So we went in and they had my shades but not my boyfriend's ray bans! So they told us they would call us if they found them.  Sure enough they did! They had fallen behind the lost and found box but, they were found! We were so grateful for the honesty.  The management is top notch! They gave us their word and followed though!  I think we have a new favorite place to take the family! They're food is outstanding and the staff are even better!  Thanks for going above and beyond!"
Nicole N.,"Rochester, MI",0,4,,2.0,2/7/2016,"Not a great experience! We've been here 3 times now and each time the service gets worse.  This time, when ordering we asked the waiter whether it was possible to get the calamari with just rings. He said he would check. He also insisted on taking our entire order with our appetizer order. The next time we saw him was when he brought EVERYTHING we ordered-appetizer, salad and main course at once.  The calamari were included and were at least 50% tentacles. As he put them down he said ""oh yeah they wont do just rings do you still want them?"" We told him we did not and he took them away mumbling that he would take them off the bill. We finished our meals, which were average, and then sat....and sat for 22 minutes without our waiter coming back and with empty drinks. We finally asked the hostess if we could order dessert from someone and also asked to see a manager.  With prompting from the hostess  waiter came by and took our dessert order. He also dropped our bill which still had the calamari on it. A manager never came over. I am giving 2 stars bc the pb smores dessert was amazing! All in all a horrible customer service experience.  Not sure we'll be going back."
Mark B.,"Fort Myers, FL",0,1,,1.0,2/19/2015,To say that the management in this establishment are mentally handicap would be an insult to mentally handicapped individuals.
Roger A.,"Canton, MI",0,2,,5.0,2/19/2015,"Excellent food... Hamburger was excellent, kids loved the pizza, and the beer was tip top!"
Zach H.,"St. Joseph, MO",39,15,1,1.0,6/17/2015,"Poor service, way too long in between refills. The Cajun pasta I ate tasted like ketchup and noodles. Would not return to a bjs brew house."
Courtney S.,"Naples, FL",0,1,,1.0,1/18/2015,"This was a horrible experience. Was home from college for the weekend and we came for lunch. First we ordered and appetizer and never got it, our waitresses excuse was we are still working out our issues in the kitchen. I have a garlic allergy and I made that very clear before ordering and when I got my food my sandwich had garlic butter on the bread. When I told the server she said the kitchen told her nothing on my plate had garlic on it. I clearly tasted garlic. Had I not noticed thing could have been a lot more serious.  My mom's burger was burnt to a crisp instead of medium like she ordered. The staff was full of nothing but excuses. It's one thing for honest mistakes to to be made but man up and take responsibility for it instead of having excuses for everything."
Jerry L.,"Bluffton, OH",2,15,2,4.0,3/7/2015,"Food and Service was outstanding! We had a variety of food including Pizza, Chicken Taco's, BBQ Pulled Pork, Shrimp Pasta and Salmon. Everyone was completely satisfied. We will return to this clean and modern restaurant. If you like beer they have many to choose from."
Gordon G.,"Fort Myers, FL",0,42,,3.0,4/7/2015,Pretty darn good for a chain. Cali burger and the good skinny fries can feed two. All you can eat soup and salad is a bargain. Four different soups and salads each and you can mix and match for your next serving. Chicken tortilla soup was salty.
Andrew C.,"Chico, CA",66,19,2,2.0,3/8/2015,Horrible service. 1 round of drinks and dessert and it took 2 hours. Food is standard for BJs.
Krista H.,"Cape Coral, FL",239,2,,5.0,5/4/2015,Went here for lunch with my friend and Meaghan was the best bartender! She really knows what works well together! (As far as pairing food and beer) Definitely will be back.
Bill J.,"Chagrin Falls, OH",0,35,,3.0,12/29/2014,Way to expensive. Draft beers $6.50. Wine $12.75 and soft drinks $3.00. This is bar food. Fair at best.
