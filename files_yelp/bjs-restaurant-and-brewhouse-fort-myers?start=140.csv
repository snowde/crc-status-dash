Keith L.,"Naples, FL",0,4,3,1.0,12/28/2014,"The waitress never noticed that someone in our party did not get their food. I ordered a bison burger that was well done instead of rare and it took them 20 minutes to bring it out. It also took them 20 minutes to bring another drink. Also the food was very underwhelming. Save your money and go else where they have gotten my last money. We also had to point out that all our water glasses were empty. Crappy service, average food, watered down drinks, and freezing cold dining room."
