Sarah W.,"Mundelein, IL",6,9,,5.0,5/3/2016,Randomly stopped at this place on the way to the airport. I had Mediterranean chicken pitas and tortilla soup.. The soup was amazing! Good portions and they serve it table side. I would highly recommend.
Cristina P.,"Canyon Country, CA",0,2,,5.0,7/6/2017,The food was great and the service was amazing! Wings were better than any wings I've ever tried and their chips and dip was addicting. Our waitress was so friendly too. It was my first time at BJ's and I will definitely be going back.
Lee P.,"Estero, FL",17,4,,1.0,6/20/2016,"All was going well with our visit.  Ordered a couple of their craft beers which were good.  Got the batter fried asparagus sticks which came with a really nice lemon aioli.  After all that, we went to order our dinner.  My wife got a burger topped with bbq brisket, and I went to order the sirloin and shrimp combo. I was told the restaurant is out of sirloin.  In fact, there were no steaks to be had at all.  I went with a bowl of clam chowder (and ordered a takeout steak dinner from another nearby restaurant to eat when I got home).   Problems with the visit:  - No steaks....whatsoever....at a brewhouse???  When a restaurant is out of a major item, they should tell you about it before you sit down.  To me, this was ""bait and switch"".  - The server never offered any suggestions for alternatives.  Just a sort of ""oh well"" attitude.  - There was apparently no manager, because not once during our stay did one come around to see if everything was OK.  No visits to other tables either. How can you manage a problem if you're not aware of it.  - Ordered dessert and the check was plopped on the table immediately.  The check was paid and I had my credit card back 6 minutes before the desert even came to the table. I'm not in the business, but even I saw lost revenue opportunity here. Pros:  - The beer was pretty unique.  - The asparagus appetizer was excellent. Unfortunately, this was my second of two visits to BJ's, both with a less than desirable experience (the last was in San Diego).  Will not be returning here again."
Richard B.,"Naples, FL",1,25,,3.0,12/9/2016,Food is consistently good and we love the large beer selection. Our only negative would be the service as we've had a few hiccups and 1 that went way south when a bar server turned sour when questioned about an order. Not on our regular routine any longer.
Liz L.,"Charleston, SC",147,466,27,4.0,5/13/2015,"Come for the beer, eat if you must.  This is a chain restaurant, and the food is on the same level as most sit-down chains. Not bad but not memorable.   The beer selection is GREAT and fairly priced. Good mix of local, domestic + international (including my favorite hard-to-find Belgians).  Lots of TVs."
Rin T.,"Naples, FL",3,39,11,4.0,11/18/2015,"It's all about the experience... Mine was good... Beers were vast in their choices. But the appetizer...wow! Root Beer Glazed Ribs Five baby back pork ribs with BJ's Handcrafted Root Beer BBQ glaze. Served with sriracha slaw topped with green onions. Fell off the bone... I never get that anymore... My wife even liked it! She opted for a simple pizza that she devoured every last morsel. Garlic Chicken Pesto Grilled chicken breast, basil pesto, fire-roasted red bell peppers, seasoned artichoke hearts and tomatoes topped with BJ's signature five cheese blend, Parmesan and goat cheese. Yes, we will return.  I liked the service with the new guy and the veteran needs to remove a chip from his shoulder a the bar. He was helpful when probed with questions. Heck...Sell me early!"
R L M.,"Fort Myers, FL",0,22,2,4.0,2/19/2016,"Five in our party. Service was very prompt. Appetizers, entrées, and desserts were all excellent.. Extensive menus selection. Never had to ask for anything as far as service. Even drinks were refreshed quickly. Overall an excellent experience!"
Bill G.,"Fort Myers, FL",0,2,,3.0,4/30/2017,"The meal was not too bad, nothing to brag about, but ok. Glad they had gluten free buns for my wife. My burger bun was too large. Hate it when I get too much bun for the burger served. My big problem was our server, Carol. Very gruff. Not friendly at all.  Smiled very little. Had to call the bus boy over to get ketchup and mustard because she was nowhere to be found. AND they had her training a young girl!! Big mistake. Huge.... Would we go back? Not to this location. Been to other Bj's and enjoyed it."
Matt P.,"Bonita Springs, FL",109,139,104,3.0,1/15/2016,There is a diverse menu to please everyone's taste. It defiantly is more lively during the school year because it is near the college but they do a good job delivering decent food at a fair price.  The service is always good.
Johnny M.,"Alpharetta, GA",5,3,17,1.0,11/27/2015,I was very disappointed because I visited BJ's on the west coast and it was always good... So I brought my family to this location food was horrible in the service wasn't that great.
Miranda N.,"Cape Coral, FL",84,2,,2.0,8/29/2016,"Poor excuse for a BJs restaurant. I've been to BJ'S multiple times on the east coast of Florida. It's one of my favorite restaurants, so I was beyond excited to see we got one in Fort Myers! My excitement was short lived... the food was sub-par at best. The pizza had no taste  (and it's my favorite thing at BJs). My husband ordered a burger which came out looking and tasting like a hockey puck. And our pazookie came out completely raw. I could deal with the food if the service wasn't so bad. You could tell our waitress  hated her job and was doing everything to force herself to smile. I wanted so badly to come to and love my favorite restaurant chain, but with this experience, looks like I'll be making a trip to Pembroke Pines. (On a slow Monday evening)"
Danielle B.,"Lehigh Acres, FL",116,87,14,1.0,6/28/2015,"Such an awful experience and with being from the restaurant business I tend to be a little more forgiving. Started off ordering one of their layered beers like a Black and Tan, it was serve completely mixed. Ordered 2 apps, one came right out, the second took 25 minutes and was burnt to a crisp. Then the entrees came and not a single one was right. Burgers over cooked and salads missing half the ingredients listed on the menu. But the worst part was management. Manger came over and argued with me on what the menu said. ""No that doesn't come on the salads"" when presented w the menu and shown where it says that he finally said well I guess I need to learn the menu a bit better."
Michael W.,"Fort Myers, FL",1,11,2,1.0,7/3/2015,"There were a few highlights amongst a sea of lowlights. Our server, Beatrice was very helpful and supportive. The honey sriracha brussel sprouts were decent. Jambayala was nice and flavorful. Unfortunately that's where it ended. The spinach and artichoke dip was INEDIBLE. Chips were fabricated of silicone and the dip tasted like it was made in a hospital lab. I am convinced the sirloin steak was originally intended for a passenger on a Pan Am flight in 1962 and reheated in a microwave last night. Beyond INEDIBLE. Won't even discuss the shrimp tacos. Equally distressing was the manager's complete lack of concern. In summary if you can eat somewhere else do it, otherwise go hungry."
Deborah G.,"Dublin, OH",9,18,,1.0,7/25/2015,"One doesn't go to a chain restaurant like this expecting stellar cuisine. That being said, there is a standard that can be expected, which is the reason for the ""chain."" This outlet falls far short of the lowest expectations. We ordered the Brussels sprouts appetizer, the mahi tacos, and a margherita fresca flatbread. The Brussels sprouts were okay; over-fried and over-seasoned, but okay. The flatbread was cheese and sauce with a few shriveled ""basil"" shreds on it. It was oily and unappealing. The mahi tacos had a handful of sauce-gooped ""slaw,"" and were so oily on the outside that we had to wash our hands after trying to eat them. The accompanying tortilla chips were oily and inedible. The only reason for the star was the beer, which is at least consistent across the chain. There are other restaurants nearby, and you would be better off at one of them."
Heather J.,"Fort Myers, FL",0,8,3,4.0,2/27/2016,Friendly staff... always clean and a pleasant experience. They have a ton of beer options - too bad I only drink cocktails - Ha! Ha! The food is great and menu is extensive. Definitely worth checking out+
M P.,"Lakeville, MN",0,103,104,4.0,4/13/2015,Had the Asian chicken salad. Very good. Dressing nice and light for hot days. Tap beer selection is  great About 34 choices. Would come back again. Nice atmosphere.
Jodi P.,"Fort Myers, FL",8,24,5,5.0,5/23/2016,"Really good.  Darren got the Bacon Blue Cheese burger and fries and he really liked it. I got the sirloin, mashed potatoes and wedge salad. My steak was perfect.  I sent a thank you to the chef via our awesome waitress Rebecca. We then shared the Salted Carmel Pizookie. So delicious. Looking forward to returning."
Jennifer B.,"Fort Myers, FL",0,4,,1.0,12/22/2016,Server was great but if you want a cocktail you will be waiting awhile. Finished meal without any drinks on the table. Asked to speak to manager and he avoided coming to our table. Be prepared to wait a long time for everything.
Jean C.,"Lehigh Acres, FL",97,36,170,5.0,4/15/2015,"Aw man! What a place! Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING was great! We had a meat lovers pizza for starters and it was heavenly, only thing I wish is that they would have added a bit more sauce, other than that everything was great, ingredients tasted fresh and the pizza was well baked! Also split an order of wings of which I believe we're covered in bbq sauce! Wings were excellent! Perfectly cooked, no pink!! Huge pet peeve of mine, these were thoroughly cooked! And for the entree I had a real plump juicy burger! Well done!! I'm telling you this place is unmatched! A real win for Estero! I'm looking forward to returning to try something new off the menu!"
Heather G.,"Naples, FL",10,55,38,4.0,5/10/2015,Lots of interesting appetizers to choose from.  We tried the nacho bowl ( good) and mozzarella salad.  The cherry glaze salmon was amazing.  The deep dish pizza I was told was excellent.  Can't wait to come back again.
