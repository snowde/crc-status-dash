Steve C.,"Davie, FL",1315,671,2242,3.0,3/3/2015,"I was on the way to collect my new vehicle purchase with the Wolfe and we ducked in for tasty bite.  Big, new, clean, adjacent to I-75 with great, corporate service.  I had some soup, and a cold beer. More to come from the next visit.  Cabeza OUT!"
Chelsea A.,"Bonita Springs, FL",0,6,,1.0,3/11/2015,"I have lived in the area for over 5 years. I venture to Gulf Coast 2 times a week. There were 7 of us, tried to make a reservation online and it didn't go through.  There are 3 hostess and none of them know what they're doing. The manager is seen, adjusting his pants and acting like he's friends with the wait staff. Our server was a little slow with no personality.  My mother, sister and I ordered margaritas, no alcohol mostly sour mix. My sister found a ticket from the bar in her drink. No manager. The food is sub par. Flatbreads are just bread with no toppings. Server never asked if we wanted more drinks.  This will be the First and LAST time I will come here. Don't waste your time with this place."
Sandy R.,"Fort Myers, FL",19,210,246,3.0,3/21/2015,"My husband and I had dinner here tonight with some friends.  I had soup and salad combo and decided to upgrade my soup to a bread bowl.  The bread bowl with the chicken tortilla soup was very good.  The caesear salad was mediocre.  Our server wasn't the best and was eager to get us out of the place when we finished our meal.  Not sure I'd go back.  $47.00 for my husband and I, no alcohol.  A little price, in my opinion."
Patricia M.,"Alpharetta, GA",18,4,7,4.0,11/25/2015,"The restaurant vibe was awesome! However the host who seated us could have smiled once.  First impression are everything in most situations especially at a restaurant. Anyway, the food was really good. I had the vege deep dish... It was sooooo good and our waiter Steve was fantastic! He kept me and my daughter hot tea !"
Gig B.,"Fort Myers, FL",3,100,2,1.0,6/16/2015,"Have to give up on this tourist trap! $2.95 for ice tea $8.95 for a 5 ounce burger...WELL DONE not medium. $16.95 for jambalaya that only tasted like some poor grade chili pepper. The manager was too busy to interact with the customers. But, he certainly could publicly embarrass a waitress AND the only bartendress. Both occasions left patrons shaking their head with disrespect. My advice, don't bother...ft. Myers ale house is much less expensive and twin peaks is going in across the street..."
Ali H.,"Rego Park, NY",32,87,2,3.0,5/31/2015,I live in NYC and stopped here when I noticed the name. We stopped in hoping they had great beers. They do have a craft beers to chose from but the list is not that of amazing beers. I think they should add perhaps one premium craft beer on their list. There is also the chance that I went on a night where they did not have any premium craft beers on the list.  The food was not bad. I was not very hungry going in and it is hard to judge food when not hungry.
Liz L.,"Fort Myers, FL",12,18,7,5.0,2/10/2015,"Loved this place and will definitely be coming back. Excellent service with a fresh new menu to the area. The server, Whitney, took great care of us as well. Had the carnitas fries, shrimp tacos, Mediterranean pita tacos and the trio dessert."
Ozzie P.,"Fort Myers, FL",7,38,26,5.0,5/27/2015,Delicious and fresh food. Very nice service. Will Definitely come back here as long as the food and service remains the same.
Molly P.,"Naples, FL",0,52,94,1.0,12/10/2015,"This BJs location has fallen short time and time again. Being from California I'm a huge fan of the concept and food. On numerous visits I've tried to give them chances, chalking up bad service and bad food to being a new restaurant. Unfortunately after being open a good amount of time they still have not got their act together. Clam Chowder served cold in the middle of the day and the server says sorry it was frozen and they didn't microwave long enough. Another occasion one entree arrived and the other did not because the server forgot to ring it in."
Greg L.,"Fort Myers, FL",1,11,,1.0,5/27/2017,"I'd never been to BJ's before, and I won't be going back. First, the menus were very sticky. I thought maybe they had just been wiped down and the moisture was keeping the pages stuck together. I soon realized this was not the case. 3 out of 5 menus we used were sticky. Next, the silverware was dirty. I unrolled my napkin to find pieces of dried food on both the fork and knife. I prompted my friends to check their silverware. Another knife and fork had dried food, also. Obviously, whoever rolled the silverware wasn't paying attention. Lastly, we all requested well done/crispy fries.  None of us received them that way. When brought to the server's attention, all she did was acknowledge that they weren't crispy. She did tell us that she did, indeed, key them all in the system that way. Ok. There was no offer to replace them or even an attempt to bring out a new plate. Fries are an easy fix and cost close to nothing. This problem should've been resolved easily. The burgers were good, at least, and so was the chicken salad. However, they weren't good enough for us to overlook the other issues."
Gary H.,"Braselton, GA",0,32,3,4.0,5/24/2016,"I wasn't sure when I walked in, based on other reviews. But I love a challenge.  And this was worth it! I arrived about 8:30 pm on a Tuesday. It was busy, but not packed.  I ordered a sirloin and shrimp, asparagus and potatoes. WOW!  The total portion size was great and the meal was delicious.   Service in the bar area was fast and friendly. Good vibes.."
Phil S.,"Lake Mary, Orlando, FL",0,26,11,3.0,3/11/2016,"Great beer selection....... Very average food. Very nice layout of the restaurant / bar, attentive staff, but again the kitchen appears to be run by the local students and not trained staff."
Michael S.,"Fort Myers, FL",0,31,4,4.0,11/29/2014,"Nothing to complain about, great service, awesome food, (I had the Flatbread appetizer & Parmesan Chicken with greenbeans.) Also many of the house brews.  This is a newer, different size BJ's restuaunt. They do not have the big screen TV,  just 3 large LED TV's behind the bar and several others around the restuaunt. My only complaint, that is easily rectified, no cell service for Verizon in the bar, only outside. Get an amplifier or cell repeater in the bar.  I was trying to meet up with & have others come to this new bar, and I was unable to connect with them until I left the restaurant. My visits here will be limited till that changes."
Emily L.,"Naples, FL",16,14,9,4.0,3/27/2015,"Enjoyed a date night here a week ago, on a busy bustling Saturday night. Showed up at 7 with no reservation, waited about 15-20 mins for a table, which wasn't bad for a FULL restaurant. (Btw this was my first ever visit to a BJs, my date has been before and recommended it).  They sat us in a small section of 3 2-person booths. It was perfect, we had a view of the whole place without being smack dab in the middle of families and chaos.  Our server was the best part about this place. Her name was Beatrice but she asked us to please call her B, right off the bat being personable and friendly! I think she got the drift we were on a first date bc she gave us ample time to chat, browse the menu, and enjoy our cocktails...so appreciated.  I had two cocktails, one called ""a drink like that"", super strong and sweet/sour, as well as a strawberry mojito. He had two craft beers, out of their large selection, he enjoyed both. It's always nice when a server is knowledgable and can make menu suggestions, super helpful!  We didn't eat dinner, we just ordered avocado egg rolls to share. They weren't what I expected, just an odd flavor combo of avocado, bbq chicken and tamarind sauce?? Kinda wished we'd ordered a different app, but he liked them, so it's all good.  Over all, we both had a great experience based off atmosphere, service, and drink quality. We will definitely be back, and next time for dinner too! Make sure you ask for B to be your server if you want to have fun with great service!"
Bradley E.,"Youngsville, LA",9,3,,4.0,12/27/2015,"The appetizers were fantastic, strongly recommend the wings and the ribs. The deep dish pizza was slightly above average, pretty decent. The desert was absolutely incredible. Service was great as well."
Todd C.,"Lehigh Acres, FL",16,5,1,5.0,1/17/2015,"An amazing place, Ashley G was awesome a great waitress! Food was five star! We will definitely be back!"
Dee R.,"Lehigh Acres, FL",25,6,,5.0,1/4/2016,"Took my mom and brother for lunch and I must say we all loved it! From apps to desert everything was wonderful. Luis V was our waiter. Very nice, very professional and very accommodating. Prices are extremely reasonable and I just love the vibe. I come from a city and this place made us feel like we were back home in our city. An amazing experience and we'll be regular patrons for sure."
Michael P.,"Cape Coral, FL",0,14,3,5.0,2/24/2016,This is the third time we have been here and it just seems to get better each time. I had the ribeye the first time and it was grilled to perfection. The second time I had the grilled mahi tacos. They hit the spot for a quick lunch date. Tonight I'm trying the chicken Alfredo. Yum!  The best thing for me is I love craft brews and their house beers are top notch!
Brian C.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,4,,5.0,4/16/2016,Food was good.  Many healthy choices along with not so healthy.  Tom was our server and he was super.
Kathy K.,"Schaumburg, IL",0,19,12,2.0,2/22/2015,"My friend recommended this place to eat out Saturday night but I don't really like it. We called ahead to be put on the wait list and FYI this list doesn't actually start until we got there (why didn't anyone tell is that over the phone????) so then we had to wait another 30 min for a table that's would fit a grout of five. After placing the other for avocado egg rolls (MUST try!) we then had to wait another 15 min to get it. I ordered Hawaiian mahi mahi as my entree. The fish was overdone and so it was dry inside and wayyy to hard to stick a fork it! Blahhh... But the Hawaiian rice with pineapple was absolutely amazing. Overall, I wouldn't come back to BJs for dinner unless I am not too hungry and have a lot of time to wait. I did like the theme of the place. It's a nice bar for younger people that do visit southwest florida and want to have a drink in a nice place."
