Angela D.,"South Haven, MI",0,5,1,5.0,4/10/2016,"This is our favorite restaurant around here. Great appetizers, diverse menu. Definitely something for everyone. And yes you can find VERY tasty meals on a diet also. The staff is fantastic. We did have an issue with a dish one night, the manager came over to talk to us. Took that meal off our bill and the next time we came in he remembered us. He came over to our table, thanked us for coming and talked to us like we were old friends. Love this place!"
Anthony H.,"Naples, FL",9,31,28,4.0,2/24/2015,Tons of menu choices . Spectacular beer selection and right at gulfcoast.Ive only eaten here a couple of time and the food has all been good as well as the service.
Bill M.,"Fort Myers, FL",0,23,12,4.0,2/21/2016,For craft beer selection I am giving it a 4 star. Nice selection and 8 of their own beers on tap. Give it a shot. Don't know about the food though.
Christine M.,"Orlando, FL",396,9,4,5.0,1/12/2016,Amazing food and such a great selection of brews!!!! I will definitely be back to try all the different menu items because I had a very difficult job trying to decide what to eat! The menu selection was vast.i found some good chicken Mediterranean tacos. Will definitely be back for brews and deserts!
Matthew A.,"Durham, NC",0,27,8,4.0,8/10/2016,"This place is a haven for anyone who enjoys spirits, wine, and exotic Liquors. The staff was very helpful when I was there and they found me several different products for me to try and experiment. Due to the ABC liquor stores down south, there is a large limitation on what they sell in their stores. Up north in Illinois, they have so much more choice in alcoholic beverages. I give the place a four out of five stars only because the prices were quite high."
Joan M.,"Bonita Springs, FL",3,49,4,4.0,12/7/2015,"Enjoyed. Good service. Good craft beer. Good food. Had burgers, chicken pesto sandwich and a beer flight. No complaints. Everything was good and we really enjoyed."
Matt B.,"Philadelphia, PA",1,4,2,5.0,3/2/2016,"Brussels Sprouts! Yes you are reading that right GET THE BRUSSELS SPROUTS!! Never would I order these but they were recommended and I had to get a second dish. They are amazing. Salty, but SO good."
Amanda E.,"Naples, FL",1,7,5,4.0,2/15/2015,"Food was great; however, service was slow. The server even brought the bill before the dessert arrived."
Laura R.,"Fort Myers, FL",18,45,3,3.0,5/30/2016,"There were only a few tables occupied and yet the service was slow. The food was fairly tasty, I usually get the Mediterranean chicken pita tacos. The grain salad that comes with it is a delight."
Crystal T.,"North Port, FL",43,3,,2.0,8/6/2016,Our server was very friendly. My husbands grilled ham and cheese came out slightly burnt and had a coating of something that he thought was Parmesan cheese. He said it was gross sent it back. They did bring him a new one without the Parmesan on it. I got a burger it was okay . We won't be   was clean.
Larry K.,"Grosse Ile Township, MI",12,51,29,2.0,10/15/2015,"Visited this restaurant last week during my annual golf trip with the boys!  To say that it was mediocre is being fair, they had ""run out"" of medium size pizzas, one order for a medium well burger came out medium rare, was returned with a new burger served to the table a full half hour after the rest of our orders were served.  Chicken Parmesan dish was average according to those who ordered it.  All in all, fair service, the apology by the manager was useless as it was in the midst of the half hour wait for the second burger, can't say I would ever return to this establishment."
Steve L.,"Bradenton, FL",0,1,,1.0,7/18/2015,"One word-awful-the ""hand patted"" burger was just short of saddle leather and the fish tacos tasted like they had soaked in bilge water-staff was pleasant but when we only chocked down about 1/4 of our meal and asked for the check, I think they got the idea we wouldn't be back....save your time and especially your money!!!"
Melissa G.,"Millburn, NJ",0,48,,4.0,6/17/2015,"This is a good spot for late night food. It's the only place open late that isn't your typical Applebee's or Friday's type food. They have good late night deals like $1 off cocktails and $2 off apps. I've had a few things there, wings are good, deep dish pizza has a lot of flavor and the mahi tacos were very tasty. The burger I ordered was over cooked and the fries were as hard as rocks so I can't say I enjoyed it much. They have a great draft beer selection and the chocolate cookie dessert is really good too. Service is good for a chain restaurant. Some servers more attentive than others, but that happens everywhere. Overall a nice spot that I would recommend for late night food if you're in the area."
Sue K.,"Naples, FL",0,5,,1.0,1/16/2017,"Let me first say that we have been to a couple different BJ's...and we have been to the Ft. MYERS store 12-15 times...and we love it...the beers. The apps.  the soups...pizza...sandwiches...all...and we have always sat AT the bar...But..we went in sunday night after I flew into Ft.Myers...at 830, we took a seat in the bar area and we were greeted promptly....drinks were delivered and I asked a couple questions.....  first i asked how the pasta...peanut chx sobo noodle was....the reply from server..."" it has no taste. Its gluten free and I dont like peanut butter""    please give me 5  minutes..I asked....when she returns..we ask about the ribs...""sorry, we just ran out"" we get it...cant make unlimited amts. So I ask how the Ribeye special is.... her reply "" its  ok....i dont like chewing that much"".. we decide to order it anyway..it comes with 2 sides... tortilla soup please..."" im sorry, the soup is put away already"" ....   I say im sorry...what time do you close...she proceeds to tell us 12.  "" well we only have 3 servers and its alot of closing sidework so we put it away early"" We asked for a manager but the kitchen mgr. Came out and told us noone orders soup at night....   the server came back and said"" i can get you a refill on your water... not my cocktail, my water..then proceeded to tell her coworkers sitting in a bar booth, that we are a problem...so everyone stares at us.... no problem jenny.   We wont come back and i will tell everyone I told to go there...Not To.."
Jeana P.,"Saint Cloud, FL",130,38,21,5.0,4/19/2015,"I've had great service at this location both times that I've been here. J or Jay is an awesome server! He is very fast and polite and didn't mind a friend and I being rude and doing school work while we ate in his section. He got our food out quick as well which was nice since we let him know we were in a hurry. That was my first time visiting this location, I'm familiar with BJs as I'm from the Orlando area and we have multiple, but I've been back since and I've never had anything but great service! I'm also happy with how intuitive they've gotten their rewards system to be and that I can use apple pay right from my table. Great location that I would definitely recommend!"
Katie Rose C.,"Cape Coral, FL",35,13,13,5.0,5/26/2015,"Jason D was our sever this evening and he made it a great experience. He suggested the Lemon Thyme Chicken, which was delicious! He was also very attentive to our needs as well as our toddlers wants and demands. Loved him and loved the food. We will definitely be back."
Lisa W.,"Shrewsbury, PA",3,7,,5.0,7/23/2015,"Skeptical towards any chain restaurant, this really surprised me!  I did not want to share my siracha brussel sprouts app with anyone it was that good!  I Could have just eaten that and dessert...more on that later!  Hubby ordered Chicago style personal pizza and it was the best I've had!  Now save room for dessert....we indulged in the Peanut butter smores and practically licked the pan.  Get it."
j r.,"Aurora, IL",2,50,5,5.0,7/17/2015,"We had ribs, jalapeño burger, and Mediterranean chicken  in flatbread  All were excellent!!!!"
Shannon R.,"Fort Myers, FL",0,10,1,5.0,1/16/2015,Just went here for lunch with my husband. We had the avocado rolls and they were amazing. The sandwiches we had were also great. Our server was very attentive and did a superb job. If I had anything to complain about it was that the server was to nice! I will be back for sure.
Cody W.,"Fort Myers, FL",1,65,1,4.0,10/4/2015,Wait time are crazy. But food and beers were good. Our server was nice and on top of it.
