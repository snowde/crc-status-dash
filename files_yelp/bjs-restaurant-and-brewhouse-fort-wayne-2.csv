Taylor T.,"Fort Wayne, IN",314,105,162,4.0,12/15/2017,"I would totally come back.  Environment: I really enjoy the open eating area layout.  It makes the building appear much larger. The place is very clean and well out together . It's a little bit darker inside than I was prepared for but no fault in that.  The bar area is really really nice too.  Service: hit or miss.  I came one time and the service was not good at all. Not friendly and seemed like they didn't want to be there.  The next time she was smiley and friendly. I think the bar keep may need extra help because she seemed over whelmed. I really loved how accomidating they were with the request of no butter and etc for sus being vegan.   Food: being vegan this place has a few choices to pick.  I got the qinue bowl and it was super super good.  We got an artochike appitizer which was delicious but,  be sure to order with no cheese if you are vegan.  My partner got the cauliflower tacos and those were also an amazing choice.  All ordered with no cheese."
Danielle C.,"Fort Wayne, IN",6,85,18,1.0,12/28/2017,"I have dined here twice since they opened. Different days of the week and at different times. I'm sad to report both times were horrendous and I left the restaurant disappointed. I really want to like this place and dine here in the future but given a staff that doesn't seem to care once you're seated and management not around to discuss the tables mishaps and us having to flag down any other staff member that walked passed us and had the guts to look at us so we could corral them to our table Justifies that I cannot go back nor leave an upbeat kudos review. The first time we had a party of 12 for a Christmas Office dinner that was paid for by the company. 7 of us ordered the rib special that came with a full rack of ribs, salad, two sides and a dessert. They ran out of ribs, baked potato and some vegetables. Instead of coming to the table to notify the guest and ask what they'd like instead they took it upon themselves to replace items they didn't have with what they chose. Umm why?  Adult beverages took 15' to come out if at all, desserts weren't delivered to everyone that ordered their famous pizzookies and water or drink refills never happened. Management was flagged down at the this visit and the owners were given a huge stack of gift cards for the issues. Ok so the second trip had to prove better since it was earlier in the week earlier time and a party of four, right?  WRONG!!  I Called ahead for seating and still endured a 20' wait when we got there, once sat it just went downhill from there. Our server was friendly and got our drinks out in a timely matter so I'll give him that. But after that randy failed on every level. Drinks were never refilled unless I flagged him or someone down, our food took 30' until Randy came to our table and said ""hmmm I wonder where your food is!""   5' later it came out.....cold and you could tell it sat on the kitchen line for awhile. Two of the meals were prepared wrong, missing items and one hamburger was so well done it was dry and inedible. Don't worry we never saw randy again to tell him any of this but the hostess and other staff members retrieved our missing items and at least got us hot fries which was my meal that night since my hamburger was a hockey puck that I ordered med but came out well. Randy wasn't to be seen again in till he brought the check and even when we asked for boxes to take all of our food home he still was clueless. Yep, you guessed it not manager to be seen to let them know so we could at least get a decent burger remade. But my trash can loved it!  It thanked me for it!   For a Place that opened up a few months ago I'd have thought the kinks would be worked out but it appears that they aren't. Which is to bad, I really wanted to like this place. I want to go and have beer and burgers but unless a miracle happens I just won't be back.  Other than that the establishment is very cool. The brick and lighting as well as the decorations prove to be popular with everyone. It can be noisy but that makes it all part of the experience. It's more of a Brewhouse so if you're expecting to have your grandpas birthday party dinner here be prepared to experience a fun atmosphere with little noise muffling happening. It's also very busy so I would suggest taking part of the call ahead seating."
Matt H.,"Fort Wayne, IN",12,22,,2.0,12/9/2017,"Average at best. It's a typical chain restaurant much like AppleBees. Our food was fine, but nothing special. Got a kids pizza and honestly it was no better than Pizza Hut, again nothing great just average. I know they have their own beer but I did not partake this time. The desert was good, but it was a knock off of the Cookie Monster at cheddars, yes I knows that a chain as well.  I won't be going back, service was fine, no complaints."
Fred P.,"Fort Wayne, IN",49,227,17,5.0,11/13/2017,"I'm loving this place.  Have been here about 3 times since it opened and have loved it each time.  The atmosphere is great, services is spot on, and the food is really good.   Food-wise, I haven't been disappointed.  The only thing I didn't really go bananas over was the fish and chips.  The batter needed some work.  But otherwise, the chicken sandwich and pizza are great, and the frigging pazookies should be outlawed.   I love the craft beers here, especially the hefeweizen and the red.  The servers are always really good, especially Austin (Cubs fan Austin).  I also really like how they do their orders on tablets right at the table.  It seems to get things done really quickly.  Glad this place was built."
Tavid M.,"Garrett, IN",15,9,27,4.0,11/20/2017,Good place for nice conversation.  Very good beer and bloody Mary's.  Sirloin was tasty but a little bland.  Stuffed mushrooms awesome.   Mahi tacos excellent.  Good service though salads and apps came out together.   All in all thumbs up.   And you have to try the Grand Cru beer.   Fuckin awesome.
Joe S.,"San Juan, Puerto Rico",0,6,2,3.0,10/21/2017,"I'm just going to get to it. First off the pizza was good the crust was actually good for thick crust (light and airy). For that I'll say it was good.  Now when I called to order I ask specifically if it was a true Chicago deep dish and not thick crust. I was told yes. Not true though as stated above. So I have looked up the definition of Chicago deep dish. See below.  Chicago-style pizza usually refers to deep-dish pizza, which is a thick pizza baked in a pan and layered with cheese, fillings like meat and vegetables, and sauce, in that order. The crust is usually 2-3 inches tall and gets slightly fried due to the oil in the pan."
Gabbie G.,"Roanoke, IN",0,6,,4.0,12/27/2017,"Love this place the food is delicious, but expect to wait an hour and a half for food. It is also rather pricy and I like to eat well. A family of three cannot get out for less than $100 and a couple will run you minimum $75 so sit back relax and enjoy your time there because you are paying for it and the food is worth the wait."
Cassandra C.,"Fort Wayne, IN",31,44,60,4.0,4/18/2017,"So the bf and I decided to give this place a try since we had a coupon  and we'd never been to a BJ's.  So first of all Monday is a half priced pizza day, so be ready for the kitchen to be slow and secondly they have $5 margaritas on special too. The menu is highly confusing... it jumps around so much I flipped through about 6 times.  We decided against a pizza and instead wanted to try a bit of everything. We ordered the mozzarella sticks as the app, he ordered the French dip with a bowl of chili and I ordered a bowl of clam chowder and a mahi mahi taco and shrimp taco.  So my bf got his chili within 5 min or so of us ordering, I got mine after our food came. Our app was delivered after we were finished eating and had been waiting on our boxes.  Besides the service lacking, and I don't mean just server ..... we never saw the manager, the kitchen obviously dropped the ball and out server was distracted by a table demanding free stuff.. the food was really good. I love soups and both the chili and chowder were good enough to bring me back. My boyfriend loved his French dip and raved about how it didn't even need the dip. My tacos were good too, a little heavy on the sauce side. Really they just needed cilantro and lime juice . All in all we would go again. I know they are new and still training, I hope they get it all together."
Patty M.,"Carmel, IN",23,101,117,4.0,9/2/2017,"Was in Fort Wayne on business. Didn't really want beer but this place was convenient and seemed casual as I just finished working out. Sat at the bar. Had the curry cauliflower and the seared tuna salad. Very good. This is a chain but have to say, I was impressed. The salad was filling, cool and crisp. Tuna was fresh. The little dots of wasabi were fire. I asked for more. The cauliflower was very unusual. Seemed to have lentils on top. Tasty. Would definitely return and may have a beer next time."
Renee S.,"Mishawaka, IN",92,202,243,1.0,11/19/2017,"Awful! Ordered the black and blue burger.  It was overloaded with sauce making it inedible. I left 3/4 of the burger and all but 4 fries.  We sat at the bar, it seemed like a chore to serve us drinks.  My husband had a Bloody Mary, needed spice and liquor.  Come on with the celery on it too.  Don't you bar prep? He had the Penne with Asparagus.  It had no flavor and kept adding salt, pepper and hot sauce.  We'd been traveling all morning from  Kentucky and were hungry, so this was such a disappointment.  The bartender asked if I wanted a box.  I declined, not even my teen boy would've eaten it and if you have teen boys, you know they demolish leftovers.  I didn't say anything other than no thank you, on the box.  BUT.....with 3/4 of my food left plated why wouldn't he ask if everything was ok?  Clearly it wasn't.  For crap service dude, enjoy your 9 cent tip.  My husband NEVER does that, I guess there is always a first."
Justin V.,"Roanoke, IN",42,3,1,4.0,12/17/2017,"Tried this place for the first time tonight. The atmosphere is great. The selection of IPA is huge but they don't have any domestics on tap which is disappointing. The service was wonderful and attentive. The place seemed clean and well kept. I ordered the Atlantic salmon with broccoli and it was really really tasteful. I ordered a pizza to take home and when I got it, it looked like it had been dropped on the floor (everything stuck to the stop of the box, box covered in grease). I sent it back and they gave me another pizza free of charge. They were nice about it and the new pizza looked much better but it seriously wasn't even good .... it was basically pizza hut pizza . I wish I ordered the thin crust like the people next to me, but I thought that's all they had so I didn't realize I was going to get a thick crust. I wish the server had asked what crust I wanted.  Great place to eat - avoid the thick pizza because it's like pizza hut"
Jessica C.,"Fort Wayne, IN",48,31,40,5.0,12/12/2017,"I want to take a moment to appreciate great service! Tonight we had a party of five and Anna was our server. She did a fantastic job! She was polite, easy to talk to, made great suggestions, and got our orders quick. I was very impressed with her and would highly recommend asking for her when you go to visit!"
Nicole G.,"Fort Wayne, IN",25,4,1,5.0,11/12/2017,I moved to Fort Wayne 60 days ago and this place is great!  Waitstaff are super friendly and food is great. It's the only restaurant I've been to multiple times since moving here!
Kendra G.,"Fort Wayne, IN",10,60,212,4.0,4/20/2017,"I've been a fan of this place since my college days in Indy & the Fort Wayne location didn't disappoint. Although I know the place is known for all the good bad food like pizzas, burgers & pizookies - I decided to take a different approach and try something off their low calorie menu. They had a lot of low calorie options, but I got the Barbacoa Chicken. For 520 calories, I was very impressed with how flavorful and delicious the entree was. This place has pretty slow service, but I'm sure that the kinks will get sorted out soon. The positive is they do tend to work together as a team unit, so when our waiter wasn't paying us good attention, someone else did."
Ryan H.,"Fort Wayne, IN",142,8,8,5.0,4/12/2017,"Since BJs opened just a few days ago, I was really impressed for my first experience. Nice atmosphere when you walk in. I feel like it fits almost everyone: casual enough for a family dinner with kids but also classy enough for a date. And there's a lot of tv's like a sports bar.  Food: the menu is HUGE. Lots of different choices for whatever you might fancy that day. For apps, we got calamari and the California club flatbread. Both highly recommended. My family all got burgers because on Wednesdays they have $10 loaded burgers and endless fries. I had the bacon guacamole burger which was juicy and flavorful. My girlfriend had the BBQ bison burger which was also delicious. And the endless fries, well it was unfortunate that I could only eat one refill because they are bomb. Crispy and potato-y.  Service was pretty good. For it being so busy and brand new to Fort Wayne, we got our food and drinks in pretty good time and the staff was prepared. Interesting about 10 people had helped us including the waitress but still enjoyable experience.  Overall I really like Bjs and will definitely be coming back! I would compare it to an upgraded version of an Applebee's."
Kevin S.,"Mississauga, Canada",100,95,83,4.0,8/14/2017,"popped in at around 10:30pm on a saturday night, got a table for 5 right away.  really spacious venue with tons of seating.  attentive and polite service an extensive menu boasts nearly every mid-priced american bar/restaurant food you can think of, such as pizza, burgers, sandwiches, salads, and wings.  our party shared the bj's brewhouse classic tavern-cut (thin crust) and the bj's classic combo deep dish pizzas.  both were delicious and loaded with toppings.  i liked the tavern-cut pizza a little more, simply because of the herbs they top it with. great tap list here as well.  tons of beer styles are represented, so you'll always find a good pairing for your food"
Christine M.,"Fort Wayne, IN",39,12,10,5.0,5/22/2017,"Update / 5/22 ! Half price pizza night ! We had Dave Ross as our waiter- he's the bomb! The trainers are all gone and Shawn is all on his own! They are finding their way and will find their niche here in Fort Wayne! Walked in, place is open spacious, cool brick and totally dig the silver CROWN molding. Super cool. Don't get the whole 4 huge garage doors thing though, lol! We have had three folks help us so far and my Paloma is delicious! The gourmet 5 meat was tasty - mostly of bacon and it reminded me of pizza hut pan pizza - not that that's bad but just thought it would taste more ""deep dishy"". Yummy though!  The yumminess was found in the Santa Fe Salad ! Staff are still training but they were all pleasant and up beat - will be back.  ******Ok, we came back for 1/2 price pizza night 4/17 and we sat here 40 minutes before we were told that THEY WERE OUT OF PIZZA DOUGH?!?!!!!? Are you KIDDING ME??? We had been sitting here - the 5 of us!!!! And Amy , the manager , came out , to tell us after 40 minutes and offered us nothing - poor planning -"
Jeremy M.,"Fort Wayne, IN",0,19,,3.0,8/19/2017,"So lets start with the positives.  Food was great, didn't wait too long,  selection of beer is fantastic, no complaints about the service, and the venue has tons of space.   However the one thing that probably is going to keep me from coming back is the noise.  More and more restaurants seem to have this idea that if you blast loud music from the speakers then it'll make people want to spend more money.  Which is kind of the opposite reason why I would like to eat out.  I would like to relax, to talk with my friends, or even read a book while I enjoy a good meal.  But if I have to constantly shout to even have a conversation, then i'm not going to have a good time.   Maybe it's not like that during the lunch time hours so I might try it again during that time.  But right now. I sadly won't be back."
Beth W.,"Fort Wayne, IN",2,32,87,4.0,8/30/2017,Came into this place with low expectations since it was a chain. Boy was I wrong! Delicious!!! Everything was perfect and flavorful. From the appetizer to the dessert. Burgers were well seasoned and cooked perfectly as asked. Hard to find a joint that actually cooks the burger how u ask it to be cooked. My only issue was the fact that the beer on tap was a bit warm. But the place is still new so I'm sure they have to figure a few bugs out. Our bartender was super friendly and fast. We will be visiting again very soon.
Dalton A.,"Indianapolis, IN",2,30,43,4.0,8/7/2017,"Really fun spot to get lunch! They have so many options to choose from, so you can easily find something new to try each time. Everything tastes really good, especially these cauliflower tacos (they taste just like ground beef tacos and they're healthy)! Service is always really great and the atmosphere is awesome - it's got a nice industrial feel. Can't wait to come back and try another dish!"
Jim P.,"Chanhassen, MN",1,68,7,3.0,8/12/2017,I had three opportunities to eat here and it was definitely a contrast to say the least.   First time we came for lunch.  I got the soup in the bread bowl and it was very good for a casual feeder but below par for top tier restaurants. Service was good and the place was clean as it is new. The menu is diverse.  Second time was for dinner. I can't remember the last time I saw a clusterf*** as this meal.  Service was great but it ended there.  The appetizer came out with loads of salt (and I like salt) and when we complained to the manager he attempted to tell us that a deep fried appetizer is pre salted on the outside. He brought another one out which was fine. My friends mixed drink had no alcohol in it. My other friend's meal arrived in three stages. This was a total fail and I can't remember some of the other stuff that was done.  Third time was for dinner. Service was on par and the food quality also improved.  I would pass until the opening dies down.
Cw M.,"Fort Wayne, IN",1,10,16,3.0,9/14/2017,"Really loud and unexceptional. A large fast-casual, Appleby's on a grander scale. My flatbread pizza was great, the service was very good, the setting was good, the decor was good, my large group was seated fairly quickly and by staff members that seemed very concerned that we not have to wait long (thank you, again)....so you might be thinking, why 3 stars? This restaurant format, with the exposed wood tables, metal walls, stone, etc just seems to amplify sound. TV's are on (often muted, because who can hear them?) People are trying to talk over the echoed din of the crowd and there is nothing to absorb the cacophony until your ears are ringing. I had a group of 9 people, and you could maybe talk to the nearest 4, and just barely that. This place is a solid 4.5 if you were dining alone with earplugs, and could be a 5 with time, but this is not a place to socialize unless you can shout into your friend's ear. The prices are a little on the higher end for this format, but there were lots of choices that looked really intriguing. With the giant barn building shape, I have no idea what they could do to wrangle the noise level."
Londa T.,"Matteson, IL",0,3,6,5.0,8/1/2017,"Its really good!  The decor is appealing to the eye.  We had the avocado rolls, cherry Chipotle wings and the deep dish Mediterranean pizza. Seriously everything was good and tasted better the next day.  The mango margarita is everything!  I'm going back tonight."
Tyler S.,"Fort Wayne, IN",44,9,,5.0,6/18/2017,"2nd visit: Drinks: Jeremiah Red, Berry Jerry, Nitwit, and Watermelon Mojito; all delicious. Appetizer: Ultimate Pepperoni Flatbread; a really yummy thin crust that wasn't crunchy or cracker-like, very good Entrees: Shrimp and Arugula Pita tacos; came with a quinoa, tomato, corn and onion salsa, the shredded Parmesan cheese kinda took over, but it was good, too. Half-rack of ribs with clam chowder and tomato & mozzarella salad; the ribs were really excellent, especially if you like to ""kick it up a notch"" as I do, the chowder and salad were decent. Overall: Gave me pint glass that read: ""Happy Father's Day 2017"" with a card to get 20% off over the next 3 weeks...we'll be back!"
Patrick T.,"Fort Wayne, IN",123,8,2,5.0,7/7/2017,Absolutely fantastic food and service! Called ahead on a Friday night and we were seated in less than 15 min! Ordered the Prime Rib Special and it was fantastic! It came with 2 sides and a salad which were also very good. Plenty of food for the price! It's not the cheapest meal in the world but it's great every now and then for a good night out!
Dale B.,"Fort Wayne, IN",394,178,,5.0,5/28/2017,we've been to BJ's two times and loved it each time.  Get the app for your phone.  The free appetizer is worth it.  The best part is being able to call ahead and reserve a spot.  The interior is very welcoming and fun.  Not sure I understand the garage doors inside though.  The bar area is a comfortable place to sit as well. We have tried multiple things from salads to sandwiches to appetizers to pizza.  All have been good every time.  The menu is HUGE!!  The service is committed to making things right.  We've been a couple times during the training/opening period.  So things were a little crazy...but well worth the visits!!
Barry V.,"Fort Wayne, IN",0,7,9,5.0,5/8/2017,"We went to BJ's Brewhouse over the lunch hour on a Friday. At 11:45 AM it was already packed. We tried the Spinach Artichoke dip as an appetizer. Chips were hot and crisp and the dip was flavorful.  For lunch, I had the hot ham and cheese with fries. The outside of the sandwich was grilled with Parmesan for a crusty cheese coating that was strong but tasty. My wife tried the BJ burger with bacon and I got to taste it...really good burger! My son tried the Chicken Bacon Ranch Piadini. He thought it was okay but he probably wouldn't get it again.  The staff is friendly and efficient. I set up the BJ Brewhouse app and paid from my phone."
Michael G.,"Fort Wayne, IN",16,13,,2.0,10/1/2017,We ordered the deep dish buffalo chicken pizza extremely disappointed in the quality also horrible service had to ask for silverware and drink refills etc...overall not impressed
Kelli F.,"Angola, IN",30,8,4,3.0,9/1/2017,"First time here... I would highly suggest getting acquainted with the menu online first before going in-it's a novel!!!  Went with friends at lunchtime; it was busy, but plenty of seats available. Service was good... food was good.  Not overly impressed, but not disappointed either."
Zhanna C.,"Fort Wayne, IN",36,18,65,1.0,5/26/2017,"Look at this Margarita Flat Bread and they'll me what's missing?! This pizza doesn't even deserve 1 star. ZERO, ZERO stars!!!"
Corinne S.,"Fort Wayne, IN",106,35,55,2.0,8/4/2017,"Unfortunately our first experience here was so terrible, I can't ever see myself going back... Ambiance: Atmosphere and decor are impressive. Probably the best thing about this place.  Service: TERRIBLE. Being a server myself, I completely understand when a server gets overwhelmed on a busy night with too many tables. She was also training someone, which doesn't help. BUT, BUT, BUT! it's all about how you handle the situation! If service is slow, or things get messed up, you APOLOGIZE and GET THE MANAGER. Our server brought me food that had cheese on it after assuring me that it was vegan. I understood she made a mistake before I ate it, and I ordered something else. But what REALLY UPSET us was how my friend's food was handled. She's a vegetarian. Asked for the vegetarian burger. GOT SERVED A REAL BEEF BURGER!!! She took a few bites before realizing it was the wrong patty. (Needless to say, she was puking in the toilet the rest of the night.) Now again, I understand that could be the kitchen, or expediter's mistake...but everything was handled completely WRONG. I'm telling you, it's all about how you handle a situation... We never saw a manager until the very end. Especially when a restaurant first opens, managers should be checking in with EVERY table to make sure guests are happy. The burger was still on my friend's check. Then the server looked confused when my friend wanted it taken off the bill. THAT SHOULD BE A GIVEN. Finally the manager came over, and was not apologetic in the least.  I still tipped the server well cause I couldn't bring myself to leave a bad tip, especially when I'm sure the rest of the table probably stiffed her... but the whole experience was a huge disaster, that could have been avoided if it just would have been handled better. Food: Lots of options. Drinks: I did enjoy the draft brews. Prices: Standard. Parking: All around the building. ***My friend did complain to corporate, and we received a $200 gift card as an incentive to give the place another try, but as far as I know, no one has used it yet."
Danielle C.,"Fort Wayne, IN",61,4,2,3.0,6/7/2017,"Ate here for lunch, I ordered the shrimp tacos but got tacos that I wasn't expecting. The waiter offered to have them replaced, but I had already eaten one so I decided to keep what I had. The tacos and avocado egg rolls were very good. I thought the food was over priced."
Chad B.,"Downtown, Detroit, MI",0,2,,5.0,10/6/2017,My family puts this restaurant in our top 3 favorite places to eat!!! Great food and great service. They even bring a little plate of appetizers out for the kiddos why we waited for our food!!! This was our second time eating here and the food has been excellent both times!!
Sydney C.,"Fort Wayne, IN",0,1,,1.0,7/21/2017,"We called ahead for seating and they ""lost"" the reservation. Then they said it would be 20 minutes. 1.5 hours later, we're still waiting. So I talked to the manager and she said she was sorry and then said she would give us free dessert. Come dessert time, she meant ONE dessert. For the table. It's so crappy. Worst manager ever."
Lisa B.,"Fort Wayne, IN",440,59,34,5.0,4/29/2017,We stopped in at 11a on a Saturday. Waitress very attentive refilling drinks before I knew I needed it. We used an offer BOGO entree with purchase of two drinks. I got the turkey dip sandwich and my husband got unlimited soup and salad lunch. We were in and out in under an hour. I was able to use ApplePay on my phone to pay the bill. We will be back.
Bob E.,"Fort Wayne, IN",5,48,,3.0,4/16/2017,"Stopped in this last Saturday. Just opened a week ago, and it was busy. Inside is smaller than it appears from the outside. Huge menu. We tried a flatbread, and it was decent. the wife had a salmon salad, and I had an Ahi Tuna salad, both had nice fresh greens, but were just okay, and over priced. Salmon was a little overcooked, and the Ahi portion was small. The house beers were on a par with Granite City, (average at best) if that's what you are into. They did have a decent selection of guest taps. Beer prices were also a little high. Service was friendly, if a bit uncertain. Two members of management stopped by to chat briefly. Due to the great location the place should do well. Probably won't make my regular rotation, but would not be opposed to returning. Looked to be kid friendly."
Tori S.,"Fort Wayne, IN",7,38,49,5.0,6/23/2017,"I've been to BJs a few times and have yet to be disappointed! We love the beer sampler! It is not as ""classy"" as Granite City nor as expensive, so I actually like that! I feel Granite City out prices themselves.  If I want a classy experience and a good steak that's what I have Club Soda for! *truth* Where as BJs hit it right on! If you want to try a verity of things get the appetizer sampler (you will love the egg rolls) and a beer sampler! Such a great first date thing to do and place to go! My boyfriend and I both said that we wish we could have gone here. Light energy, easy, and fun! The portions are perfect even on the appetizers. All in all a great new add to the Fort Wayne Restaurant list and it's at the top of mine! #granitcity #clubsoda"
Sarah C.,"Lake Forest, Fort Wayne, IN",28,16,9,3.0,8/17/2017,"First time here for dinner and the service was decent. Whoever was in the kitchen had a love affair with pepper. From my brothers spaghetti, to the steaks, and mixed veggies it was all heavily peppered. There was nothing memorable about BJs to make me want to come back. They need to make up their minds about what kind of food they want to serve and ditch the 20+ page menu and fire the guy with the pepper shaker."
Anita H.,"Germantown, WI",2,14,,5.0,6/8/2017,"Visited while in Ft. Wayne for a basketball tournament. First visit was for lunch with a group of 12, encompassing multiple families. We had such a great experience that we came back the next day - again a group of 12, but a somewhat different mix of guests. Here's why we loved BJ's: - Large menu with lots of variety. Not only was there something for everyone, most had a hard time choosing from the multiple items that looked good at the time. - Kid friendly - Great service. The order system sends orders in real-time. For example, on the first day, our server began taking drink orders. About half way through, we realized that due to time constraints we should probably put in our food orders right away, so she came back around and started taking food orders without leaving our table. While she was taking food orders, servers began to appear with our drinks! - When food was delivered, several servers came out making it a quick, efficient process for feeding a large group. - Multiple families were easily and cheerfully accommodated at the end, by breaking into separate bills via seat number. - Throughout the meal, servers were attentive keeping drinks refilled, and making sure we had everything needed. - And I shouldn't gloss over the fact that the food was good! The only meal that one of our guests had that was described as ""average"" was a chicken Cesar salad. All other guests enjoyed their food choice. Ditto for the local brews. Please come to Germantown, WI - we need a place just like this!"
Samantha S.,"Fort Wayne, IN",79,5,,1.0,8/5/2017,"Bad service. Okay food. It took us a half out to get our drinks  and it wasn't too busy at 11:00 pm. We ordered a beer and a non alcoholic cucumber drink on the menu, which no one on staff knew how to make. The calamari was okay. The server kept blaming coworkers for her bad service. Unprofessional. Taking orders on the tablets took forever and the server was rushing to find things and kept ringing in the wrong items. We will never go back to bj's."
