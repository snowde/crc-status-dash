Tiffany K.,"Fort Wayne, IN",4,12,5,5.0,6/16/2017,Thank you to the waitress that found my phone!! Really appreciate the honesty and for answering it when I called looking for it.
Dave R.,"Fort Wayne, IN",7,25,4,4.0,5/6/2017,"My waitress gets 5 stars. She was awesome! Food was good. Beer not so great. I had fish tacos, which I had yesterday at a different restaurant,  yeah, I was disappointed. The shell was a tortilla shell. Not a soft fresh one. Don't get me wrong. I'll try this place again. I'll just order something they 're known for."
Mindy K.,"Fort Wayne, IN",10,6,,4.0,4/24/2017,"Always look forward to trying  the newest places in town. For being the newest, BJs was very close to being impressive. It was quite packed on a Monday night. The atmosphere is very open - so if you're particular to privacy, this isn't your groove. Music playing was not overly loud or offensive, seemed clean and wait staff all dressed in black. Service was prompt. However I noticed a trend of our waitress neglecting to ask detailed questions about our orders. For example, if you want separate checks, say so before you order (you won't be asked), make sure you tell them how to cook your burger, (again, not asked) and expect to ask for refills (none offered).  Boxes for take home, dessert to go, etc etc...Also be prepared to the app sales pitch at the end of your meal. Food was pretty good, but other than someone cooking it, you'll be on your own for everything else."
Linda M.,"Fort Wayne, IN",0,4,,1.0,7/21/2017,This was our first time here.  We were a party of 6 and our wait was shorter than they stated.   We were greeted by waiter who took our orders on his computer.   The wait for food was a bit long.   Our waiter never checked our drinks we had to ask.  Food arrived and two of our orders were incorrect.  Although they were tacos as ordered not the shrimp though.  What was in the tacos was mahi-mahi.   A couple of bites at best.  They should put cabbage tacos on the menu since that is what was served!  Sadly we were unimpressed with the food and services.
Stephanie T.,"Mishawaka, IN",51,7,2,3.0,6/7/2017,"The food was very average. I ordered the Mahi mahi tacos, and there were only like two 1/2 inch thick pieces of fish in each taco. It wasn't even enough to taste it. The mashed potatoes were pretty good, but really nothing special. The only thing that saved the trip was the awesome service. Probably won't be returning. Definitely won't get those tacos again!"
Brandon G.,"Bluffton, IN",0,3,1,2.0,10/12/2017,"Food was fine, but underwhelming. Pizza is bland. Pretty good beer. Overall, nothing to draw me back again."
Sheri Sills S.,"Fort Wayne, IN",0,3,,3.0,7/16/2017,"Maybe it was just our waitress because the food was good. However, service was not!  First...drop those order tablets used to take our orders. Very low on the personal touch cause the waitress hardly looked up. Also, rarely brought us another drink. Took took long when she did. And...we have 8 empty glasses sitting on our table between four people. Will not return. Too expensive for poor service."
Barbara W.,"Fort Wayne, IN",1,14,6,5.0,4/20/2017,Freakin yum!! I got the BBQ chopped chicken salad it was amazing! My husband got the rib special and it was a huge serving. We also got a mini Peanut butter Pizookie - delicious! Staff was great. One of the best servers I have had.
Jennifer B.,"Fort Wayne, IN",2,11,14,5.0,4/14/2017,"I have visited BJ's in other states and I have to say, this location met every expectation. I came in with my family on what happened to be their first Friday in business. Needless to say, it was packed BUT 1. They have a feature where they notify you of your table being ready via text message (which allowed us to hang out in the comfort of our car to pass the time). 2. Guests who chose to stand at the front of the restaurant were offered refreshments/small snacks to make the wait less awful. 3. The customer service was superb. Once we were seated, orders were quickly taken and the food I was sure would take an hour to arrive, came out within just a few minutes. Everything was delicious!! We had one very minor problem with some cold spots on the meat in the prime rib dip, but the waitress and manager were eager to please. Not only were they apologetic, but they remade the meal as well as removed the charge from our tab. This place may very well be our new 'go-to' when we want a night out.  P.S. I forgot to snap pics, but the food looked better in person than on the menu. P.S.S. The one and only 'negative' observation that I made is that due to the nature of this restaurant, it might not be suitable for those who are hard of hearing as it is very loud."
Tim T.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,1,,2.0,6/19/2017,"Have been to this chain in Columbus, OH and loved  it so we were excited to try the one in Fort Wayne. Extremely disappointing. Service was very slow and at one point we thought our waitress had gotten off of work! Had to remind we had no silverware or napkins long after food arrived. Fries and sandwich were room temp and so was cole slaw. Pulled pork would have been good if it was even warm! Waited 20 minutes for dessert and gave up on asking for refills. Not sure I will ever go back."
John H.,"Fort Wayne, IN",0,1,,2.0,9/20/2017,"We were steered to eat in the bar area by a lazy host staff member. ""Please seat yourself"" The restaurant was freezing cold at 8pm on an evening that was 68 outside! We ordered the sliders immediately with fries, the fries hit our table when we ordered dessert, never received app plates after requesting them, never got refilled until we were ready to leave, I can go on but not gonna spend my hard earned money on mediocre food and lazy service and management that holds customer hostage by freezing them in their seats, two managers working and oblivious to the freezing guest all over the restaurant!"
Sally Albright _.,"Fort Wayne, IN",0,58,,1.0,5/30/2017,"We always love to try new restaurants that pop up in the Fort--my home since birth--so, of course, we headed on over to Bj's to see what it was all about. Our answer? Inedible food, mediocre service, and unreasonably long wait times. After using call head seating (we were seated immediately upon arrival), we waited over an hour for our food. and we spent much of that time sitting in our booth with empty glasses, waiting for drink refills from a waitress who rarely showed up.  Even the beautiful dining room (and, it is really gorgeous) didn't take the sting of an hour-long wait after 8pm on a weeknight for food that was stone cold when it arrived. Our mozzarella stick appetizer was disgusting. It was bland, lukewarm, and had a faint burnt taste to it, even though none of the breading was actually  burnt. For our main course, we ordered an (overpriced) signature deep dish pizza and a tavern cut flatbread for the table. The toppings were anything but fresh and flavorful. The cheese wasn't warm and gooey, but cold and a bit hard, even though the deep dish pizza was still in its pan. This made me wonder how long we'd been waiting for food that was waiting for us, while our waitress did side work in the form of busing other tables and rolling silverware (seriously!).  The deep dish pizza crust was woefully underdone, causing us to stop eating after the first bite. We would've sent it back to be cooked more or replaced, but we were told that could be another 30-40 minute wait--not worth it. The flatbread was even more tragic, and its crust resembled unleavened dough (dough made without yeast, or without having been given the chance to rise at all). It was clear that the kitchen staff had no idea what they were doing. We asked to speak to the manager, and he finally appeared another 20 minutes later. He was truly apologetic, and offered dessert on the house in addition to comping our inedible meal. We took their signature dessert to go, and it would've been good (pizookies in two varieties), if not for the fact that the cookies were horribly burnt.  Neither the hostess who seated us, nor our waitress, could give any food recommendations because ""the menu's so big, and I haven't worked here long, so I haven't really tried anything."" My advice to them, and to you, would be to avoid doing that. Run. Save yourselves!"
Dan C.,"Fremont, IN",3,58,5,4.0,4/8/2017,This is my new favorite Craft Brew house. The food is excellent and the Atmosphere is too. Its a little bit pricey but large portions that you can split.
Melody B.,"Fort Wayne, IN",145,1,,4.0,5/10/2017,"I've been to BJ's three times already in the past month and I'd probably be there even more if they weren't so busy on the weekends! Loving everything about this new restaurant. I think it's just what Fort Wayne needed. There's a huge menu, and unlike other places, that doesn't mean the food is subpar. I've loved every menu item I've tried so far! In my opinion they're still getting their staff issues sorted out and they are very busy so you may experience some wait time for refills or whatnot. There have been a couple minor mistakes with my order two out of the three times I've gone, but the management was sincerely apologetic. Go outside of lunch/dinner rush hours and give it a shot!"
Mark D.,"Grabill, IN",9,5,2,5.0,4/18/2017,The calimari was perfect and delicious. The waitress was really sharp and on top of my wife's dairy allergy concerns. I'll be back often.
Kadence P.,"Fort Wayne, IN",0,34,,4.0,4/17/2017,"We enjoyed our visit at BJ's. The food was good, the service was good--however, rather expensive. But it is what it is. We'll still be back, just not as regulars. Good drinks!  It was a little odd that our server gave us our bill right after our food was delivered and asked if we'd be saving room for dessert. That seemed a bit rushed."
Nora D.,"Fort Wayne, IN",12,10,6,5.0,4/16/2017,Wonderful! A bit pricey but well worth it. The avocado egg rolls are incredible. Salmon tacos knocked our socks off and the chapolte cherry salmon was over the top. My new favorite dinner place. Can not wait to return
Audrey B.,"Waterloo, IN",26,4,,3.0,4/15/2017,"Before you take this too seriously, it was opening week and the place was packed, so keep that in mind. My waiter was friendly and we were seated right away as it was just me and one other in my party. My boyfriend and I ordered and 31 minutes later we got our drinks. Our food came out before our drinks and our waiter was no where to be found. A manager saw us with our food and asked about our drinks and we told him they were not out yet, so he retrieved them. My boyfriend's drink came out correctly and mine was incorrect, but at this point I was just happy to have a drink. We both ordered the prime rib dip sandwich, which was good, but a little pricey in my opinion for a sandwich, drink, and fries. All in all I would come back, but not until the restaurant becomes more established."
Cate F.,"Middle Village, NY",0,26,,4.0,8/10/2017,"Just visiting Ft. Wayne from the Northeast and typically we try to avoid all chain restaurants when visiting a new area, but this one really impressed us. We sat at the bar and had drinks/dinner. Great vibe and hip atmosphere, didn't feel like a chain whatsoever. Food and service were well above average. Only minor complaint is that the place was SO LOUD, very difficult to have a conversation with my companion seated next to me at the bar. We were shouting at each other! Despite this, we'll  definitely be looking out for a BJs brewhouse next time we are out this way."
Patty N.,"Fort Wayne, IN",21,145,14,4.0,5/30/2017,"We went here on a Saturday night at 8:00.  I called ahead, but still had to wait about 45 minutes.  That's ok - it's a Saturday night.  The 3 in our party all got the same thing.  We wanted to try different items, but the prime rib deal was so good - we couldn't pass it up.  A large portion of prime rib, soup or salad, 2 sides AND a pizookie for dessert was only $27.00.  What a deal!  We also got the free appetizer for signing up online.  The meal was very, very good and the pizookie?  Awesome.  We got the tomato soup, clam chowder and broccoli cheese with our meals instead of salads - they were really good.  The prime rib was cooked perfectly and had great flavor.  The green beans as a side were really spicey - won't order those again, but the asparagus was good, but a little spicey as well.  The cheddar mashed were good.  Service was very friendly and helpful.  We will be back - can't wait!"
