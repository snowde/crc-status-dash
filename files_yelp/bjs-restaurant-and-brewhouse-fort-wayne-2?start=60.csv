Gs1 S.,"Roanoke, IN",4,59,1,5.0,6/18/2017,"I had low expectations of this place, because it looks like another Friday's/Chilis/Applebees, etc. The place is well-decorated and very open.  The menu is huge, too big in my opinion, but you're almost guaranteed to find something you want.  We ordered the Brewhouse blond asparagus, which is basically deep fried asparagus. It was great, and was free with a download. The draft beer menu is also large.  They have their own line of crafted beers, as well as a great variety of others.  We ordered pizza and the parmesan crusted chicken.  Both were excellent!! The service was excellent as well. The only negative is that the server didn't give us the appetizer for free like it was supposed to be. We didn't even bring it up, as she was so nice, and it didn't cost that much.  We'll download it next time, because there will definitely be a next time. This place should put Chili's out of business within a year.  Highly recommend this place."
Scott S.,"Fort Wayne, IN",0,8,8,2.0,6/18/2017,Loud atmosphere with mediocre food. Supposedly known for their pizza which neither the pan or the thin is very good.
Rachel M.,"Fort Wayne, IN",3,5,1,4.0,6/8/2017,"Awesome service and awesome food! Check online for coupons before you go. Monday-Thursday's 3-7 they have half off mini pizzas. I ordered a mini buffalo chicken pizza (which I highly recommend) along with a nacho appetizer and a drink. My bill ended up only being $4.16! Although, be careful when ordering drinks. My friend ordered a margarita that wasn't very big. Her bill came and the drink was $10! Ask for drink prices before you order. Overall I had a great experience and will definitely be back!"
Amanda W.,"Fort Wayne, IN",5,13,2,3.0,4/18/2017,"It wasn't a terrible experience. Just very confusing from the start. The fact that no names are taken at the hostess station seemed a little odd to me. How do the hosts keep people in the queue straight? And why did I have to wait 5-10 minutes for a table at 11am when there was a full staff and plenty of empty tables? (I used to work in a very busy restaurant, and this floored me. The hosts are the first and last faces guests see, they can make or break the experience. Maybe it wasn't their fault names aren't taken, but in my past experiences, taking down names is the best way to go to keep order.) I was asked how many were in my party a second time, and it appeared I'd be seated then. I was told I would not be seated just yet. But when it was time, I nearly missed it because I wasn't informed. Someone just walked up to me and said, ""Party of 2? Right this way."" When I was seated, it took a few minutes before a server got to my table, which is fine because the menu is 20 pages long, and far too many choices. (Kudos to all of you servers who know it by heart!)  When our server did arrive, he was very friendly and knowledgeable. My sister and I both ordered a grilled ham and cheese with tomato basil soup. She also ordered a strawberry mojito (which was more expensive than our meal). The soup came out before the meal, but we ordered the soup as a substitute for french fries. They should have come together, I thought. We still had fries on our plate (which was fine, we didn't have to eat them.) The food itself was average. Nothing to write home about. I was a little overwhelmed with how many people came to the table to refill water, deliver our food, remove our plates, and bring boxes. And it seemed as though some of the staff just 'hovered' in the walk ways. Too many people just standing around. It was nearly impossible to have a conversation with so many people. We also had a bit of a wait to get our bill receipts after our server ran the cards on his handheld device. The devices were really neat, however, because he could order our food from them, print our ticket to the printer, and run our cards on them. The price for our meals themselves were reasonable for what we ordered. I *may* try this place again after a few months of them being in service. I know it takes a while for new places to get their stuff together."
Carol C.,"Kankakee, IL",0,5,5,4.0,6/18/2017,The food is very good. Get the BJs app . Only issue with this location is the staff seems to be new and doesn't understand how to use the BJs rewards .
Spencer S.,"Fort Wayne, IN",0,2,,3.0,6/13/2017,"Came in Sunday evening, wasn't busy at all but service was very slow. We were greeted nicely, and sat down. It took a while for the server to take our drink order, and then we ordered our food and that took a decent amount of time for 3 people as well for our food to get to our table. Server didn't check up on us at all or even go near us to see if we needed anything (we needed ketchup and drink refills lol) by the time we did get refills we had the checks brought out to us and everyone was already done. Food was pretty good, the fries were alright. Other than the slow service and inattentive server it was decent."
Ann S.,"Fishers, IN",0,20,,4.0,5/26/2017,"Definitely get on the call ahead list! We waited about 20 minutes on a Saturday and people walking in were told over an hour for a party of 2. Food is good, everyone was pleased with their meals. Pricing is reasonable too. Would definitely return."
Jordan T.,"Fort Wayne, IN",45,2,,2.0,5/9/2017,"Had a 45 minute wait to eat on Sunday evening which was no big deal, but when we got seated it was 10 minutes before our waitress even got to our table, ordered two mixed drinks and a glass of water, our waters showed up after our food came and was eaten, took one sip from it and paid the bill, food was good but service was terrible"
Kelly R.,"Fort Wayne, IN",5,13,3,4.0,4/28/2017,"The only reason I gave this place a four instead of a five was, our waiter talked SO much. The food was excellent and I loved the layout of the place."
Tracy E.,"Harrison Hill, Fort Wayne, IN",36,3,5,2.0,5/2/2017,"So unimpressed with this restaurant! We have been twice and the food is average at best! The music was so loud I couldn't hear my husband at dinner but could hear everything the booth behind me was saying because they were screaming to hear each other. If I wanted to go to a rock concert I would have went to the Coliseum. My jumbo spaghetti and meatballs were not even close to jumbo the meatballs were the size of a ping pong ball and I am being generous saying that. My husbands baked ziti was undercooked and not even hot. He ordered the Ahi tuna salad to replace it and it was missing the avocado. The other thing I totally don't get is why 10 people came to our table. I have been a server for 15 years I understand having someone run your food for you or get you a refill on your drink but not having so many people come to your table. There are to many good brew houses in Fort Wayne   i.g. Granite City, Junk Ditch or The Hoppy Gnome to come back here!"
Allyssa B.,"Fort Wayne, IN",0,1,,2.0,8/1/2017,"From start to finish this experience was completely disappointing. When we arrived the hostess sat us and informed us our server would be with us shortly. A few minutes later a young lady greeted us, handed us menus, and told us our server would be with us shortly. Then the real server arrived and asked us if the lady who provided us with menus got our drink order. She did not. I ordered a cheeseburger well done, cheese only and my boyfriend ordered the wings. When our food arrived it was delivered by yet another person other than our server and who was a different woman than the woman who greeted us with menus. I instantly noticed that my burger was prepared with lettuce and tomato and quickly picked it off. I was going to let it slide until I noticed it also had mayonnaise and some orangish colored sauce as well. I politely reminded her that I ordered cheese only. She looked at the receipt as if I were lying and then questioned whether or not I wanted it remade. I told her I did. Within one minute she returned the burger to me with the same plate, fries, picked off lettuce and tomato, and burger with mayonnaise and orangish sauce soaked into the burger. First of all I used to be a server and as a server you need to take into account not only presentation but also people's allergies. My boyfriend at this point was just as annoyed as I was and asked her how the burger was remade so quickly. She admitted they only swapped out the bun (as if it wasn't evident) and then made an excuse on how that's ""just what they do."" We asked for a new burger and she took the plate away. Then finally my true server brought out a new burger and plate, but didn't care to give me the fries. We literally had to ask for a side of fries! The only good thing I experienced there was they have 1/2 wine by the glass or bottle on Tuesday. Other than that, I was completely disappointed and don't know if I'll return."
Byron H.,"Rome City, IN",0,5,,1.0,4/29/2017,"We decided to try BJs for the first time Thursday evening. It ended up being a terrible experience. Once we sat ourselves in the bar area it took nearly 10 mins to even place a drink order that took another 10 to get.  We only saw our waiter one time when he took our order. They have a weird way of waiting on tables. They try to send multiple people with food, and drinks. They just lose the customer attention and customer service in the process. The were several waitresses that were very helpful and could see our frustration in our waiter. I did not catch his name or I would put it on here, but he was taller, skinny, younger guy with black hair. Anyway. We were hoping for a great experience and left very disappointed. I felt awful for leaving a $2 tip on a $45 bill, but that was honestly generous compared to the service we received. As for our food. It was very bland. I had the French Dip slider which was Luke warm at best.  And it was $14. It could have been sold in a gas station for $2.99. I typically do not leave reviews, but this experience warrants the public to know. We will not be returning."
