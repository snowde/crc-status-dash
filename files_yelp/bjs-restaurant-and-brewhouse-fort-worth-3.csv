Jessica T.,"Fort Worth, TX",8,40,19,5.0,10/29/2017,"Always a great experience when dining here.  Staff is always awesome. I've never had anything bad here. Everything is pretty good, but my favorite is the Pizza. It's half off on Mondays. The Pizza is a deep dish style. It's light on cheese and sauce. Love the pizookie. It's basically a warm cookie with ice cream. You get a free one on your birthday!"
Scott A.,"Fort Worth, TX",1,61,121,2.0,10/31/2017,"This place is average on their best day. Another experience where it feels like no one with any intention on serving or being helpful is employed. The beer was flat on one of their brews, which made me want to leave. We were visiting during their happy hour and they didn't have much traffic at all, what does that tell you? We stayed because they offer a salad that we enjoy there. I just get disappointed with slow, unresponsive servers. The hostess had a helpful attitude and that got us feeling like we would have a good experience here. As far as the food goes, it took such a long time to get anything out on this occasion. We asked twice and never really felt good about the staff's response. I've been the location close to North East Mall and things were much better there.  I will likely try that location again, I've been tempted to give that location another chance. Someday I really do want to try their pizza."
Daniel N.,"Fort Worth, TX",2,33,38,1.0,10/3/2017,"**DOES NOT ALLOW BABIES!!** Hostess at front said they could not accommodate a single baby stroller. Told us to hold a 3 week old the whole time. HA! Never will return. Plus I really didn't wanna go here, cause the food is subpar. We were just in the area.  The Brussels Sprouts were pretty good last time, but had tons of gristle only steak last time. If you can't accommodate guests MAKE MORE ROOM!! ~~~~~I have no regerts not going back...~~~~~~~ Regerts?!! Sorry I was eating a Milky Way since I couldn't eat here."
Victor M.,"Fort Worth, TX",1,6,1,1.0,12/17/2017,"Let me start by saying I been a Bjs costumer for years. I love the beer and offs. But I am really disappointed with this location. The service at the Bar area is the one worst . They take for ever to service you drinks. I left my rewards points in the receipt and ask for them to add them. They never do! But yesterday they try to charge me for someone's drink. When I question it, they was not apology . They only said oh it was probably the guy next to you! Not coming back!"
Carlos R C.,"Fort Worth, TX",13,56,385,4.0,4/15/2017,"Really nice place. First time i hve ever eat here and i must say, quite delish. I can't wait to come back. I order a jumbo spaghetti meatball which it wasn't the best spaghetti i have ever tried but is the second(first is my mama's). Now, my beautiful girlfriend got initially some sort of tomatoes mozzarella salad on a vinaigrette which i got give it to her, was pretty interesting. We went to watch a game and quite frankly i enjoyed. The atmosphere between the bar where we were, and the dinner room was very nice. The place have free Wi-Fi, multiples tv. If u ever wished to change the channel they'll do it, no questions. Services in general is great. I definitely recommend this place. Couples, family, it doesn't matter. This place is perfect for any occasion."
Inez P.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,4,,1.0,1/9/2018,Really disappointed in the food and staff. They deliver our plate and walk off. Didn't say anything didn't wait to see us cut into our steak. We cut into them and they were well done. We ordered medium rare. So we looked around and nothing no waitress. Waited. Started to eat our sides because we were hungry and about half way through the sides I found someone attention who was sweeping and she said she would look for our waiter after we told her about our steaks. After a while the manager I assume came up he had not informed he was but the difference between shirts has me assume that he was. Asked with his hands up like what!?! I explained that our steaks were over cooked. He asked if we wanted new steaks? My initial reaction was to look and laugh like well what do you think!? I been waiting at least 15 minutes or more of course I do. We are hungry. So he asked or would we like to try something else. I said no. The correct steak. Waiting again with no waiter to return until 7 minutes later I asked for our check and then they asked if I want it boxed. I said no I won't reheat a steak to be back to a well done steak in the end again. So $44-$45 later I ate mashed potatoes and dry broccoli with little cheese as orders and no steak. I was so upset and explain to the waiter I am upset that no one checked on us to see how are steaks were and we had waited so long until they finally showed up 20 minutes after they had delivered them.  He apologized but still out $45 and un fed is a very disappointing way to end the night after a long hard work day.
Angela T.,"Granbury, TX",0,18,20,2.0,7/7/2017,"Good food, but terrible service. Our experience at BJ's starting at 6:30 on a Friday night was nothing short of chaotic. While we were seated quickly, and our server took our order in a timely manner, it all took a deep dive from there on out.  The first bit of drama was over my beverage order. Per their menu I ordered San Pellegrino mineral water, but apparently no one realized they carried it or knew what the heck it was. The first drink they brought out they said was Club soda. I'm pretty sure it was Sprite. When I flagged down a hostess she went and spoke to someone who came and told me that they don't carry mineral water. I pointed out it was a menu item, but was again told they didn't carry any such thing. I asked for a regular water instead, which was brought to me and again I was told they don't carry mineral water by the person who brought it out. Well apparently the manger got wind of the discussion, came over and asked if I wanted a San Pellegrino, and I said yes. He took my glass of tap water away (without asking) and brought me a bottle of San P.  Second came the food problem. I ordered a Brisket Burger without cheese. I always emphasize no cheese because I am allergic. When our food arrived my burger had cheese mixed into the brisket almost hidden by the BBQ sauce. Luckily I spotted it and sent it back. As I said before, the food was good after the order was fixed, but that cheese mistake could have had some serious health consequences.  Third, when it came time to pay our bill, the server scanned our bill onto someone else's credit card even though she had my card in her hand. It took them so long to figure it out that my husband and I left our seats and went to the cash register to find out what the heck was going on. Supposedly they got it all straightened out but it took an additional 15-20 min from when we finished eating to when we finally got out of the restaurant. Needless to say I checked with our credit card company when we got home just to be sure.  Finally, when we were there they had a police officer in uniform stationed out front at the bar/hostess station the whole time. Given that BJ's is an upscale version of Chili's and not the corner pub, his presence was a bit disconcerting. We couldn't help wondering what happened to warrant him or what they were preparing for. Needless to say this and the beverage/food/bill debacle made for a less than relaxing Friday night dinner. It will be awhile before we return to BJ's, and even then it won't be on a Friday night."
Abigail O.,"Fort Worth, TX",67,1,4,1.0,7/12/2017,"So disappointed, I called in a Togo order and received a soggy salad, with bearly any lettuce and only half the amount of soup I usually get. Also asked the Takout girl over the phone to butter the inside of my bread bowl, she forgot and I had to wait another 10 minutes to get that fixed. Didn't notice my soggy salad or BEARLY THERE SOUP till I got home and when I called in my complaint, the mgrs response was ""if you come back and bring your order in we will go ahead and swap it out for you.""  How is that the solution? What makes him think I want to drive all the way back to fix something that was supposed to be RIGHT the first time? Extremely poor service! Complete waste of money.."
Tiffany S.,"Fort Worth, TX",26,5,1,4.0,8/8/2017,"The hostess Alicia that works here is SOOOO friendly and kind!   She played with our 2 year old son for a while so we could eat in peace .  Our waitress,  Emily, was also super friendly and paid close attention to detail.  Our glasses are always full,  our order was correct,  she brought a started plate for our toddler to keep him busy, and even remembers to go drinks.  Service here is 5 stars! The only reason why I am rating this as less than 5 stars is the food selection.  While I love BJ's;  my husband is disappointed with the quality of the food.  But that's more of a corporate issue.  I wouldn't say it's poor quality or bad;  his opinion is that it's just not something to write home about.  Great job guys!!"
Kimberly N.,"Mansfield, TX",46,2,4,5.0,9/21/2017,Favorite place to hang out great customer service and the food is delicious  I love the Mediterranean chicken tacos
John Q.,"Fort Worth, TX",12,298,56,5.0,11/10/2016,BJ's is a great restaurant.  They have a great selection of craft beers including an amazing seasonal (pumpkin).   The food is always delicious and the wait staff is great.  We enjoy eating here frequently. We actually used them last week to cater for a baby shower and they delivered the food on time and hot!  Thanks so much!
Ashleigh D.,"Fort Worth, TX",201,323,6,3.0,12/27/2016,"BJs is a decent place if you're looking for a menu that's got something for everyone. Though... it seems just when I've found something I absolutely love, they take it off the menu. Currently, their Sriracha Brussels sprouts are my go-to and some sort of sandwich with their shoestring fries.  I'm underwhelmed by their pizzas, burgers and most main course dishes, but presently happy and surprised by their appetizers and small plates with some of that awesome beer they brew.  It's an okay place to watch a game, and hang out with a large group in the bar area. Service is quick, helpful and spot on.  Pizookie (giant cookie with ice cream on it) is a must!"
Rachel M.,"Fort Worth, TX",51,40,18,2.0,4/9/2017,"Ordered curbside pickup with some friends. Three of us got burgers, all with fries. Instead of putting fries in each container, they put them altogether in a small brown paper bag. Umm what? My husband and a friend both had onion strings on their burgers, but all of them were put into our friends container. My medium burger seemed overcooked and bland. No one else seemed to have any issues with the taste of their food. This is the second time eating at this particular location. Food is just average to me. However, all four of us ordered online on the same check and they were able to split it when my husband and our other friend got to the restaurant. My advice: go inside for a somewhat better experience and go for their beer, not the food."
De M.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,58,8,1.0,6/10/2017,"Celebrating my sister's birthday after spa day. Let me start with the cleanliness or lack thereof. There was a little girl with her dad seated near us. She said, "" daddy, this floor is slippery."" His reply was, "" it's because they haven't cleaned it."" That says it all. Our coffee cups were dirty; hadn't been washed. Our table was sticky. My menu had food stains. My shoes were stuck to the floor. My sister asked if they would sweep. I felt gross. The service was grindingly slow and the food was mediocre at best. Our waiter Jared and the manager were responsive to our concerns. The rest of the wait staff looked uninterested. One wonders how long this business will remain, as it is a Saturday, at the mall, in the afternoon, with so few customers. Needless to say, because of the cleanliness factor, I will not return...am afraid to return. Yikes!"
Chad H.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,6,8,5.0,4/28/2017,"Great menu with a wide variety of options. Deep dish pizza is solid, as are their entree salads and jambalaya. Order a side of their fried Brussels with sriracha crema for a real treat. And don't forget a pizzookie for dessert. The peanut butter smore is incredible. Marshmallow fluff for dayssss. Sit at the bar and have Matt take care of you. One of the best bartenders in town."
Elizabeth A.,"Hebron, KY",0,43,5,5.0,11/19/2017,This place is great. I sat at the bar with my husband recently and the service and food were way above average. The bartender (I believe his name was Chase?) was so attentive even though there were a lot of others seated at the bar. He filled our waters and paid attention to our drink levels. He had knowledge of the beers on tap and was very helpful. I ordered a salmon dinner and my husband ordered a couple of the appetizer specials and it was all too hot to eat when it came out. It was a perfect night out and we'll definitely be back soon.
Vanessa C.,"Flagstaff, AZ",12,10,1,1.0,8/7/2017,"Went here for our anniversary dinner (because I love their pizza) and was so disappointed. We ordered the BJs fav pizza with no mushroom and a wedge salad. I got the salad first and started to eat it and noticed a weird taste and when I looked closer they had replaced the tomatoes with salsa with cilantro since they were out. Then came our pizza and my husband noticed it had mushrooms and told our waitress and she just looked annoyed and took it back. At this point we had been waiting an hour so once we got the second pizza we had been waiting an hour and a half and not once did she apologize or check on us, but the worst part she charged us for the salad that I clearly could not eat. I really think it was the poor service that made it such a horrible experience, we can totally look past the mix up with the mushrooms."
Kim T.,"North Bergen, NJ",35,171,563,3.0,5/31/2016,"I've been here maybe 3-4 times. I don't like the food here much since flavors are always off somehow or something is too dry or too greasy. I only come here when everything else is closed and I need food asap (very late dinner) or because it's a group thing and I lost the ""choose our restaurant"" battle.  If it's just food, I would rate the place 2/5. However, I like that the place opens till midnight on weekdays which is so useful since I sometimes don't have time to eat until after 10pm. Also, I like the indoor design and atmosphere, the proximity to me and the alcohol. I'd come back willingly for drinks... But food will only be as a last resort. One thing though, giant portion size... Like ginormous amount of food... But just not very good imo."
Gerald N.,"Fort Worth, TX",380,42,356,5.0,1/23/2017,"This is the most amazing restaurant for beer and great food with friends and family. The environment is pretty cool with some really neat decorations, oh and I don't want to forget about the buy one get one free offer."
Isabel G.,"Granbury, TX",1,6,2,2.0,7/17/2017,"Went with a friend. We were greeted politely. After we got sat though, service was slow as can be. I had to re-order a beer half way throught the one I would be drinking just to get it on time. She paid more attention to my friend,which is a guy than she did me. I dont appreciate that. Little did she know I was paying the bill. Food was good. We had nachos and friend had a steak. I was really just surprised at the fact that they carried Martin House's Salty Lady on tap. I will return just for that. There was a gentleman,maybe the manager,who knew about the beer. Wish I had gotten his name. But he helped me more than my own waitess. Thank you."
Brittany W.,"Weatherford, TX",0,4,1,1.0,10/28/2017,"Food was awful and took forever, service was ok. We ordered the ""deep dish"" pizza. The crust is about 2 inches thick, with a little sauce and cheese on top. That's not deep dish pizza. That's cheesy bread. Could have gotten better pizza from pizza hut. Will not be going back. Go to Abuelos next door instead."
Marcie O.,"Fort Worth, TX",1,34,1,3.0,1/21/2017,"Exactly as I would expect! BJ's is an upscale Chili's - we like it because of the something-for-everyone menu. No matter what you're in the mood for, you can find something on the menu that you will like!  My three-star review means exactly what it says - very average all around. I have nothing negative to say about BJ's, but I've just never been blown away by the food, service, or ambience. I guess in a city such as Fort Worth, where there are so many amazing restaurants, I would not go out of my way to come here. However, when on Hulen, looking for a nice dinner, this is not a bad place to try."
Kitty K.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,45,21,1.0,3/21/2017,"I really love BJ's but this location is unfortunately an exception. The only good part about our visit was that the host was friendly and nice, the music was nice and nostalgic, and They have free wifi. That is about the end of it. We went during lunch and we were a 6 top which understandably we expected service not to be super quick but at least decent since the place was not packed. With that being said I don't know if this location is understaffed in general or if the service really just is horrendous as we experienced today. I will say the server was diligent on getting our drink order, however exhibited an annoyed attitude throughout our visit. The first round of drinks came out rather quickly and so did the soups and salads. For the most part they were fresh and good. We had to ask for refills - which appeared to irritate the server. When the actual entrees came out they looked thrown together (literally) and were lukewarm to cold. One of our guests order was wrong and when the server was informed of such she audibly sighed and rolled her eyes. The manager came by to ""check on us"" (if that's what you want to call it) and we had to ask him for drink refills because the server never came back around. By the time the one guest's meal was brought back out the rest of us were done with our meals, we all had empty plates and drinks and again no refills were offered. Again we had to ask for them. Although someone was already removing the empty plates and such from our table, we had to flag down the server again to get our bills, and many of us had our payment already ready but instead to taking them the server dropped off the bills and hurriedly walked away although one of our guests kept saying ""ma'am?""  Needless to say, I'm more willing to drive to another city to get my BJ's fixed than return to this one."
Summer D.,"Toledo, OH",265,244,1446,4.0,5/26/2015,"I like the humongous menu. I love having good variety.  They don't put much tomato sauce on their pizzas so I'm not a fan of them. Just tastes like cheese n dough. Very dry to me.  I do like the California club flatbread which they drizzle ranch on so that gives it some moisture.  I usually sit at the bar and the service can be hit or miss depending if they recognize you or not. One extra star is for the darn good happy hr 4 to 7 and 9 to 11 Mon thru friday.  $4 flatbreads, $4 chicken wings,  $5 sliders. Half price wine on tuesdays. $5 martinis from 4 to 7. Great girls hangout. I left out $4 beer which is pretty good darn beer btw and more happy hr items. One more star for management. If you don't like something they take it off your tab, no questions asked. Well run place. Come for happy hour"
Scott B.,"Big Spring, TX",13,410,303,4.0,4/20/2017,"Here again 1 yr later. Pizookies still reign supreme. If you are a peanut butter-Reese's cup fan as I am, just order the Peanut Butter pizookie and chow. Decent drink prices at Happy Hour at the bar. Chill vibe. Enjoy!"
Robert F.,"Dallas, GA",0,18,,1.0,6/23/2017,"I've been waiting for the check for quite a while so I figured why not write a quick review while the experience was still fresh on my mind.  The food was actually decent but it did take a couple of attempts to get the order correct because of what our server classified as a ""kitchen disaster"".  Refills were virtually non existent while we waited.  We didn't complain about any of this but the service was bad enough that I overheard the manager chastising the servers.  They clearly didn't care because we never did get anything else to drink.  I thought we were just having bad luck but I have noticed people complaining at the neighboring tables.  Needless to say if I ever get my card back from paying the bill I won't be back."
Terry H.,"Euless, TX",43,437,221,4.0,3/4/2017,we've been to several locations and they are pretty good to meet friends and have drinks or dinner. this location was not to loud and we were able to carry on a conversation. the service was attentive and friendly. I look forward to trying them again.
Mindy C.,"Fort Worth, TX",155,344,68,3.0,9/10/2015,"BJ's normally has QUICK SERVICE. I've found that you can order something very last minute and if you go to pick it up, it'll be ready when you get there. Even if you're calling in the order from the car whilst already driving. But I'm unsure whether or not this location offers curbside pick up. AVOCADO EGG ROLLS, you'll WANT THEM. For those who don't know, egg rolls are not any type of traditional food. They were invented in America/for Americans. So to say they are good for something ""Americanized"" isn't completely correct, but you get where I'm going with it. They have a great amount of avocado in them. They come fried and with a sweet dipping sauce. The sweet dipping sauce is very good but you can tell how terrible it is for you. Not that the rest of it is much healthier either haha. They are categorized as a shareable appetizer, but for someone with a small appetite, it can definitely be a meal.  They have a decent lunch specials menu, beginning at $5.75. They have an unlimited salad and soup option, which is always good for variety. I don't particularly like their caprese salad but I can be a cheese snob. It's another option next to traditional salad options; cesar or house. They have a strong tomato bisque soup and their broccoli cheddar is VERY GOOD. They also have a one topping personal pizza option, which kind of sucks. It's ~$7.75 and then 50 cents extra per topping. For an already small option, it's not priced accordingly in my opinion. Their pizzas are VERY GREASY THOUGH and could use more pizza sauce. I normally DON'T ORDER THEIR PIZZAS. But I think their known for them? I've had some of their other entrees and their salads, so you can't really go wrong here as a quick, good lunch option. Dessert here is SO GOOD. Pazookis (is that how you spell it) which you get one for free on your bday. Is a type of cookie and a type of ice cream scooped on top. The cookie is warm so it melts the ice cream a bit. It's just the right PERFECTNESS you want and expect from BJ's. It's their twist on the traditional molten cakes a lot of ""American"" restaurants offer.  My normal chain restaurant disclaimer: I like to comment more about the service, cleanliness, and the process experience when it comes chain restaurants because these are the main factors that vary between them. They all have the same menu. Although I go into more details regarding the menu here because despite this being a large chain, I have known many people who haven't had it before.This particular location IS NOT BUSY DURING LUNCH. So if you are pressed for time and concerned about this, YOU'LL BE FINE."
Krista R.,"Fort Worth, TX",209,681,1109,3.0,1/24/2015,"I may be being a little nice giving this BJ's 3 stars. The Pizookie on it's own deserves 5 stars. We usually get half chocolate chip, half white macadamia. Soo delicious. The service is painfully slow. We went in one time and just got a pizookie. It took nearly an hour and they weren't even that busy! There food is decent. I do like the goat cheese flat bread and the Santa Fe salad with blackened salmon.  My husband likes to go during October when they have their pumpkin pie beer."
J D.,"Bedford, TX",0,58,,3.0,2/11/2017,"What you would expect from a chain place...frozen food, bad salads, OK pizza...great beer though..."
Austin S.,"Austin, TX",143,14,7,3.0,10/3/2016,"The restaurant wasn't very full and our food took extremely long, over an hour for our table of 4. We had pretty simple dishes and no appetizers, it should not have taken nearly this long. Our server made sure to let us know how long he had been working and wasn't super personable. The food was okay although the chicken on my dish had no seasoning whatsoever. I probably should give this 2 stars but eh, I'll give it an extra to be nice."
Stella W.,"Fort Worth, TX",9,200,1004,3.0,11/5/2015,"This place is a great choice if you want to go out to eat but also catch the latest game on TV. We really enjoyed their extensive menu which pretty much will satisfied any palate. There's also a section on their menu with entrees that are 795 calories or less.  We weren't in the mood to be healthy, so got their burger and a pizza.  I highly recommend their burger and fries. The patty was cooked just right and not dry at all. The fries were super crispy which we love.  Nothing was salty! Also, our server provided excellent service."
Richard G.,"NAVAL AIR STATION/ JRB, TX",6,72,100,4.0,11/8/2015,"Well, I would agree in the amount of time one waits to receive the entrees.  We had the avacado wraps for an appetizer, a medium pepperoni extreme, and the authentic Pizookie for the desert.  And, it took forever, even at three in the afternoon on a Saturday.   Now, even though the entrées took forever the server was on cue.  He was sincere, attentive, and very helpful.  We used a coupon found on Yelp, in which offers $10 discount when the customer spends $35 or more-a good deal! To move on, we usually don't eat deep dish pizza, but I had a craving since visiting Chicago earlier this year.  If I was to rate the pepperoni extreme, it would get two stars.  The reason is because It needed sauce, which was absent.  However, it was the perfect pizza for my wife which is the opposite of my opinion...go figure? I think I'm becoming a habitual Yelp restaurant reviewer.  It is very helpful to see what other people recommend when dining out, which we do often...thank you  to my fellow Yelpers for your posts."
Karen C.,"Monument, CO",0,25,,1.0,2/6/2017,Waited an hour for take out flat bread pizza.  Never call in an order- it never comes!!
Iinda S.,"Semmes, AL",10,8,48,5.0,1/5/2017,My favorite restaurant! Service is great! Really good beer selections! Great variety of food. Happy hour is very good.
Myron K.,"Murray Hill, Manhattan, NY",0,2,,1.0,1/16/2017,"Got put in a waiting list although there were numerous empty tables, then two couples came in after and got seated first.  After we were seated, took the waiter over 10 minutes to take our drink order.  Service was extremely slow for not being overly crowded."
Susan S.,"Arlington, TX",52,201,1424,4.0,8/20/2015,This is a great place for lunch or dinner. They have a large menu with lots of good options and the food is hot and fresh. I also love the beer selection. I highly recommend it. Check out my pics.
Ashley K.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,3,16,1.0,8/18/2016,"Came here on a Thursday night around 8pm. We got our free appetizer with the coupon, but had no silverware, and nobody came to help us so I had to go walk to the host area and grab 4 silverware packs so that we didn't just have to stare at the food. Our server had messy hair stringing down (is that sanitary?) and did her best to speed so quickly by our table without making any type of eye contact so that she would not have to help us out. After we finished our food, server was again too busy to give us the check, so we waited a good 20 minutes for the check. Of course the appetizer has been charged, and we have to wait for her to walk by to let her know. For some reason though, it doesn't really seem like it's a simple mistake, because she's already fully aware that she did not take off the charge for the appetizer. As soon as we call her over, she says ""Oh yes, the appetizer."" I swear BJs makes the servers do this, hoping that the customer will not notice and they can make the extra $, or the servers are just too lazy. This has happened more than on one occasion. Anyways, had to wait another 15 minutes for her to ask her manager to fix the ticket. Please do not treat other people's time like it is worth nothing.  I like BJs and their food, but the service here is just not very good."
Erika M.,"Fort Worth, TX",53,1,,1.0,12/29/2016,Slow service. Over cooked steak and chicken. Out of their own beers. Burnt pizooki when that was what we came for. Terrible expierence. Only thing good was the design of the restraunt
James S.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,1,,1.0,5/28/2017,"First time trying BJ's. Bad service; food was great. Food took 45 minutes to come out and we didn't have silverware or napkins to begin with. Then we tried to ask during the meal and she didn't come over for a good 25 minutes. Then we ordered dessert which took 20 minutes to come out. Throughout the meal, the waitress didn't even check on us. She only came over maybe one other time. The service was poor. No tip for you. :/ and the waitress smelt bad."
