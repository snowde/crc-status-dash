Katie H.,"Downtown, Fort Worth, TX",1,5,2,5.0,1/26/2014,I have gluten allergies which can making eating out awful however Bjs has a great GF menu and they take extraordinary steps to make sure there food is not contaminated. After we received our pizza the manager came by and reassured us that the process was entirely gluten free and one cook took our pizza through the whole process. It was delicious! We also ordered the GF pazookie which I had never had before and it was soooo good! Definitely recommend to those with allergies or celiacs!!
Cari S.,"Fort Worth, TX",102,206,23,3.0,4/4/2013,"This is the second time I have eaten at this location.  I love the fact that BJ's is a brewery, the beer is very good.  However every time I come here the service is extremely slow.  A meal that should take 30 minutes ends up taking an hour or longer and the extra time you are waiting for service or for the server to come back and take your order.  I had the shimp scampi, it was very good.  Huge portions.  Last time I came I had the salmon and was very disappointed in that dish."
Kathy W.,"Fort Worth, TX",43,115,103,2.0,7/31/2012,The service in this restaurant is horrible. It is unfortunate because my lunch chicken teriyaki was very good. We waited almost 10 minutes for a waitress to decide out table was hers. Instead of trying to make it better it just got worse. She never checked on us after the order or after the food came. She looked right at our table with empty tea and never bothered to refill them. We finally had to ask her to do so. I rated the 2 for bad service because good food isn't the whole experience.
Stef F.,"Dallas, TX",113,425,561,4.0,3/13/2014,"I was hungry after a shopping trip to Hulen Mall and needed something better than what was offered at their food court. Luckily there are 3 restaurants I could walk to from the mall and BJ's was one of them. If you're feeling indecisive and not sure what you're craving for, chances are you can find something from their encyclopedia of a menu. The beer list is half the menu. They have my favorite beer here so kudos to them! Magic Hat #9 forever! :P  The menu is composed of pizza, pastas, stir-fries, burgers, and more entrees that have nothing to do with the other. No cohesion whatsoever. I like that they have a healthy and fit section, The only trouble is, it's so loud here and the music is really random. The wait is long on the weekend so be prepared to wait awhile for a table."
Lucy M.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,2,,5.0,7/7/2013,Went to BJ's with a girlfriend on Saturday afternoon after some shopping to catch up and have a few drinks. Our server was amazing and very attentive throughout our time there. She suggested several drinks that did not disappoint. We tried the watermelon mojito which is not on the menu as it is seasonal drink. I highly recommend it! It was delicious and just what we needed on a hot texas afternoon. We decided to try the watermelon and feta salad (guess we were feeling the watermelon) and the best beginnings appetizer combo. Both were amazing and just the right portion to satisfy our hunger. Highly recommend if you are looking to have a family dinner or watch a game while sipping on some good brew.
James N.,"Tunica Resorts, MS",9,16,,2.0,7/27/2014,"Went to bjs for a date night with the wife... I'm pretty sure we had the angriest server in the ft worth area.  It started when he approached the table, told us his name and said ""what are you drinking"" not in a funny or kind manner.  He didn't offer any appetizer suggestions not did he seem to care, we placed or order and he simply turned around and walked away...so, ok food+angry server=never returning."
Jennifer H.,"Fort Worth, TX",41,176,14,3.0,1/1/2013,The only good thing I like about this place is the flat bread pizzas with salad at lunch. Fast service at lunchtime.
Sarah L.,"Fort Worth, TX",3,5,4,2.0,6/7/2013,"I want to start by saying that I really love BJ's the food is great and generally the atmosphere is really good too. I work close to this location so I have been in twice with co-workers. Since they are right in front of the mall, they are ALWAYS busy and the parking is horrible. Since I go during my lunch hour we sat at the bar both times thinking it would be faster and we could avoid the waiting list. This is a mistake. We've had the same waitress both times and she is very friendly and likeable; however, since she is basically trying to cover the whole bar area, which is quite large, she wasn't able to pay much attention to us. Additionally we had to ask her several times for items we needed - I am willing to be forgiving on this matter though because the poor girl was really trying, she just had too much. It's been the same way both times we've been in. I really felt bad for her. Since she was so busy there were a couple of ""food runners"" who basically handed us our food and walked away without a word. There were 3 of us plus we ordered a few things to go for other co-workers. We arrived at about 11:45 hoping to beat the lunch rush and didn't leave until after 1. We spent a lot of time waiting for food and service, and mind you, we placed our orders as soon as we got there because we already knew what we wanted. It took us over 30 minutes to get our food and another 30 minutes to get our to go orders - we placed the to go orders at the same time we placed our dine in orders. So in summation, food is great, but if you want fast service, don't come to this location Both times we were late getting back to work because of the slow service!"
Andi F.,"San Diego, CA",10,8,7,4.0,3/10/2012,"It's been years since we have been to Bj's. Went to Bj's on a whim; since it was so close to home. Friday night and we thought we'd end up waiting forever. Got there around 6:00 and got sat about 15 minutes later ; pretty awesome considering the place looked completely full. The waiter, was very nice. His name is Matthew. Despite how packed the restaraunt was he was very helpful. His demeanor was relaxed; despite the crowd. I always have problems picking from the menu ( I get overwhelmed by the choices and I only want to make an awesome choice - that I leave happy making ). Sometimes waiters seem to get frustrated by my asking ""what would you pick? (this or this?)"" . He was so helpful! I was a very happy person with the pick that Matthew helped me with.  Avocado Rolls (appetizer) served with a kind of sweet sauce. It is what it's name suggests. These roles were packed with slices of avocado! and I love avocado. Right up my alley. He was very attentative. My drink was always full. I ordered the Chicken A La Fresca ( it was on the ""light meal"" ( something like that ) section on the menu. Normally I never go for boneless skinless chicken breast; the thought makes my mouth dry up. For some reason it was between that and the chili fork and knife sandwitch. MMMmmmm If you are a person who avoids this part of the chicken as much as me you'll be so happy you tried this one. It was paired with a ratatouille style zuccini and yellow squash (to be honest I picked it because it made me think of the movie ""Ratatouille"" - i'm such a dork) and rice, all topped with arugala. I ate half and saved the other half so I could enjoy more of it tomorrow :)   My husband had a pepperoni and pineapple calzone. He is a big time pizza person and he ""liked it"" only thing he said he wished the meat and pineapple was spread out better (all his pepperoni was stuffed on one side and he thought they forgot to include it. I personally loved the texture and taste of the bread on this. To end it off, Matthew brought out the Bj's Baked Beignet (ben-ya) made from the bread they use for the pizza. Was going to get the Ptzookie ""something like that"" but I would definately recommend this. Topped with fresh cut strawberies a scoup of vanilla bean ice cream and wip cream mixed with the warmth slight crisp and soft insides of the Beignet... it was the perfect dessert."
Mick R.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,43,,3.0,2/13/2012,"Finally, a restaurant with good micro-brewed beer (their beer is brewed by Saint Arnold's in Houston) and decent food. I'm a huge fan of the Jeremiah Red, (Irish strong ale) and their annual Grand Cru (Belgian style strong ale) On recent trips we've had burgers, potato skins, bruschetta, grilled chicken salad, and the meatball appetizer which were all good."
Steve C.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,54,7,4.0,4/5/2013,My first visit here was very good. Mike our waiter was very helpful and suggested a special that was the perfect price. The pizza was good for a deep dish. The ice cream on the cookie was great. Be sure to ask for Mike if you try this place.
Denise B.,"Irving, TX",72,62,,4.0,11/14/2011,"Well we went back there because we really enjoyed it the week before. This time we went on a Fr. during happy hour. We sit at the bar & they have 2 bartenders.& I had to ask her for another drink.I was very disappointed with the service. My husband had to wait for his drink,too. They were not very busy either.The fried artichokes were over fried & dry. The sauce that came with them was really over powered with garlic. Last week they were the best. They were only opened for 4 days when we went last time.The service was great."
Adrian V.,"Fort Worth, TX",5,4,1,4.0,3/31/2012,Wow. The selection of food here is huge! The staff is incredibly nice. But the bartender bryan is fast and attentive. Very down to earth. And someone you'd hangout with outside of this place. The food was amazing too. I had a burger and it came out perfectly. Juicy but not too greasy. And the pizza just looks great. Smell even better. Definitely coming back!
Chloe R.,"Fort Worth, TX",5,10,4,2.0,12/10/2012,"Disgusting pizza, like it HAD to have been Digiorno or something, definitely not fresh. The strawberry lemonade was good, though. I don't really like this location, Arlington & Hurst are much more consistent."
Christina R.,"Granbury, TX",0,26,,5.0,4/1/2013,"I love BJ's, even though I'm not much of a chain-lover. I've had so many things here that are soooo good. I love the salads here. The pizookies are wonderful. I just keep coming back. I think my favorite thing here is the avocado egg rolls."
Lisa M.,"Fort Worth, TX",3,15,,3.0,7/12/2012,"BJs was an okay experience.  Food was pretty good, but service was subpar.  Top shelf margarita  was tasteless, and bartender indicated it was made incorrectly.  Service was slow; didn't get a water refill until the check arrived.  Charged for something we didn't have; long wait for check, lengthy wait for payment to be picked up.  All in all, the service was bad enough to make us unlikely to return."
Garry H.,"Terlton, OK",0,3,,2.0,12/8/2012,I like BJs food and their beer is very good. This location just doesn't have great service. During lunch one should not have to wait 20+ minutes to have their server first come by. Just totally disorganized
Garrett J.,"Austin, TX",4,9,1,2.0,2/8/2012,"At lunch, my mini deep dish pizza was missing cheese and toppings on a quarter of it. Seemed overpriced. Service was a bit slow. I'm sure I'll come back for dinner to try out some beers, but I wasn't impressed by lunch."
Marie C.,"Fort Worth, TX",53,51,,2.0,1/1/2013,"I am downgrading their stars. Today I went with some friends for a late lunch. Service was HORRIBLE. Took forever for everything. I had to ask for water 3 times. Everything was a ""it will be out in just a minute"". When we finally received our food, I received my order well after everyone else received theirs. When I finally got my order it was only half of it. My turkey was ice cold. As in it was just thawed out and thrown on there and still had ice on it. I ate it anyway as I was starving and definitely did not want to ask for something different. My friends chicken marsala has very little sauce and he didn't like it either. Another friend had a burger that was completely charred on the outside and practically raw on the inside. The fastest thing the waiter did was bring my change out. Once again it was horrible service. I most likely will not return to this place or recommend it to my customers. This place went downhill FAST."
