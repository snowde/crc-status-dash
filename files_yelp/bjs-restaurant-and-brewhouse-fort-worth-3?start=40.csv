Jeff S.,"Houston, TX",230,615,212,2.0,5/5/2015,"Lunch here last Thursday was just what Yelp's two-star rating says: Meh. We arrived at 12:30 so there was no wait. Service was a tad slow, and we were a bit annoyed that my colleague's lunch came to the table several minutes before mine. With that said, my colleague enjoyed her broccoli cheese soup and salad combo. I opted for the grilled mahi-mahi tacos. They were OK; a bit on the bland side for my taste. The tacos were served with a side of red and green salsas. The red was quite good, but the green had an odd aftertaste. Succinctly stated, the experience was quite underwhelming. Silver lining: we left full."
Brian L.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,79,7,1.0,3/15/2016,"If you are in a rush for lunch, just go somewhere else!!! We came in about 2:30 for a late lunch, and the place was dead, but all of the service as a whole was horrible!! For being 2:30 on a Monday afternoon, it should not take 25+ minutes for the kitchen to process an order and get it out to the tables. This wasn't just ours either, I noticed all of the other tables around us wait the same amount of time for their food. I then had our waitress spill a good amount of water on the floor, shrugged her shoulders, and she simply left it until I told her that somebody needed to come and wipe it up. I was half tempted to purposely slip on it and take out a table or two in the process, but decided to just Yelp it.  The food was typical from what we have received at other BJ's locations, which is decent, but it seems the managers are slacking on keeping a well running restaurant at this location."
Kayley P.,"Benbrook, TX",29,29,,5.0,7/15/2016,"Food is always awesome, good drinks and beer. Servers are pretty great, our last one wasn't as personable.. May have been newer. But the food never disappoints. Especially the root beer wings! Be careful if you have a sensitive stomach."
Steve G.,"Burleson, TX",1,15,1,1.0,10/8/2016,"Worst BJ's I've ever been to. We were almost finished with our meal before beers arrived. Ran out of water as we started eating. Asked for lemons in water but never got any. NEVER saw a manager even though we were there over an hour. Employees all looked miserable, not one was smiling. This location has serious problems. I'll never go back. Friday night 10/7/16."
Doc K.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,4,,4.0,7/23/2016,"Buffalo burgers are hard to find and the one here was very good. The side of slaw  was small but very tasty. Bartender was not very knowledgeable about the multitude of beers but given the variety, that is understandable.  I'm heading back now!!!"
Melissa M.,"Trumann, AR",295,260,1801,4.0,7/9/2014,It was very good but I think next time I'll order something else. I got a chicken pasta with broccoli and it was good but not impressive. I honestly came for the pizookie and I was not disappointed there. Our waitress was nice and the restaurant had a very cool vibe.
Justin C.,"Fort Worth, TX",6,140,45,4.0,4/15/2016,Super size menu fills like cheese cake factory little brother... But good food fun atmosphere and wants you to enjoy food and time spent got some over looked cookies this is a good place for drinks a tapas or dinner date with the wife
Norma W.,"Lorton, VA",0,14,1,1.0,2/25/2016,"This is one of the worst dinner settings ever.  My husband and I were seated next to a table of 15 teenagers and of course our waitress is theirs also.  We got our drinks after 10 minutes and waited another 10 minutes to put in our food order.  The salad came and we realized we had no silverware.  Not even one server came by for 5 minutes.  I had to get up and walk to the back and ""bother"" another server. The food came quickly.  My husbands ziti had very little meat, and had to be returned via the manager.  My fish of the fish and chips was way overcooked and I could not finish. The manager was responsive and apologetic as was the server.  The food was not good at all."
C H.,"Albuquerque, NM",1,27,2,2.0,11/1/2016,"When they screw up your sandwich twice a little compensation is necessary - providing the staff tells the manager.  Nice server, but average service."
Ellen H.,"Fort Worth, TX",3,1,,2.0,9/19/2015,"We really enjoy the food here.  We have probably been at least once a month since this location opened several years ago. However I am getting really tired of the attitude on their rewards program. Tonight (Saturday) we arrived just after 6, and the restaurant surprisingly had only about 30% of the tables filled.  After asking for seating for two, the hostess, as usual, asked if we were members of their loyalty program. After responding no, she answered,""that's okay; we can seat you anyway."" We walked past many empty tables and booths and were seated at the very back table by the kitchen entrances. If this is their type of hospitality, why would I want to be loyal to them?"
Grace D.,"Seattle, WA",196,92,128,2.0,12/2/2014,"I'm not really sure what I was expecting - I hate to stereotype these restaurants, but I'm immediately suspicious of any chain that has a small book as their menu. I've only been here with a group of friends, and while the food is okay at best, the service has always been abysmal. I understand that groups can sometimes be a bit difficult to keep up with, but I would think that on an empty Tuesday evening, a group of 6 people would not have to wait endlessly for refills on their drinks.  Also, maybe this is just a pet peeve of mine, but our waitress was terrible about clearing empty glasses/plates. When dropping off a new, full glass of water, maybe pick up the empty one placed at the edge of the table for your convenience?  The food itself: is it terrible? No, not by any means. Have I had better? Oh definitely. It's essentially what you would expect at any restaurant of a similar setup. Okay, not particularly awesome by any means. Also rather expensive.  I never go out of my way to go here, and I don't think I'll be inclined to again."
Savannah P.,"Fort Worth, TX",68,4,,1.0,11/16/2015,"Everything tasted the same, service was terrible, and the drinks were sub par. There were only 4 parties in the entire restaurant and they sat my husband and myself next to a party of 10, 7 of those being small children. I've worked in the restaurant business and this is just unacceptable. We went next door to Red Robin to finish our date."
Sam G.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,3,,4.0,10/15/2016,Went to this BJs this afternoon we were a party of 20 service was very good the waiters were very attentive and most importantly the food with great .My wife had salmon I had fish and chips not sure what others had but I didn't hear any complaints.  Well be back as often as we can
Kirstyn K.,"Yorba Linda, CA",0,3,,2.0,12/30/2014,"Food is great but the service couldn't be worse. After 15 minutes, I had to go up to the host stand to inquire about whether we had a actually had a server or if we were expected to go into the kitchen and place our orders ourselves.  Once greeted reluctantly by our server Jack, he took our orders and was practically invisible after that.  Food and pazookies are good but not sure if the unpleasant and utterly frustrating experience was worth it."
Devin F.,"Dallas, TX",0,27,4,3.0,10/24/2016,"Came to this location around 3:00 on a Saturday and it was not crowded at all. It was a nice day, and we wanted to sit out on the patio. The hostess told us we couldn't sit out there because they did not have a server for outside. We were seating inside. My brother didn't like that, so we asked our waitress if we could sit outside. She went and asked and they took us outside. Didn't seem like a huge deal, so not sure why the hostess wouldn't let us sit out there. Food was good. We order chicken club sandwich, chicken club salad, and burger and fries. All really good and drinks were good too. My moms salad did have a hair in it, but the manager didn't make her pay for it."
Mai V.,"Fort Worth, TX",287,212,57,5.0,8/4/2014,"The food at BJs is maybe just 3.5 or 4 stars, but our waitress was exceptional. Her name was Elizabeth M. For a party of 25, she didn't mess up any of the separate checks and she even handed all of the credit cards back to the correct person. I've been to numerous large dinners, and there are always mistakes. There definitely weren't any tonight. Elizabeth has been one of the best waitresses I've ever had."
Kristi E.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,19,,1.0,9/18/2016,"This restaurant is terrible! First of all, they never have enough waiters so you are waiting forever just to get greeted and get drinks. Once you finally get your food, you have to flag a waiter down to get anything else like refills and your check! Food was not good either. Everything came out cold and soggy.  Will not be back."
Chelsea R.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,5,,1.0,9/1/2016,"My family and I got food to go from here last Saturday. We placed our order online and when we went to pick it up there was no parking!  So I called and the girl said to just park out front it would be ready soon. It was suppose to be ready at 715... 40 minutes later and two screaming babies in the car it was finally ready. When I got home and handed out everyone's meal, they had forgotten one of the meals. Plus it was for one of the kids. Exhausted from out trip there I decided not go go back. Plus my mahi mahi that I order was extremely dry and the meal was completely cold. I am very disappointed and will not go back to this location."
Ana O.,"Fort Worth, TX",73,246,96,2.0,9/14/2013,"Not the best experience dinning out. Service was slow - we waited for our food for 30 minutes. There were three large parties and unfortunately our food was after theirs. So if you eat here and there are large parties there, good luck getting your food.  Avocado egg roll appetizer was meh - not nearly as good as Cheesecake Factory's. Our entrees were good - no complaints with that.  Also of note is the noise level - extremely loud - you have to yell to the person across the table to be heard.   We will think twice before choosing this BJ's."
Stacie A.,"Dallas, TX",83,152,15,2.0,8/10/2014,"Mundane food selection + snails pace service = disappointing lunch. I stopped in recently with my family hoping for a quick bite to eat and a respite from the tortuous Texas heat. What I found was a restaurant that's essentially one step up from Chili's or Applebee's. And did I mention that the servers were moving like they had molasses in their pants? Okay, it might have been the kitchen but when I complained to the manager he gave me a lackluster ""sorry for the wait"" and kept it moving. Boo! The second star was for the kids menu (I ate most of my son's mac & cheese) but that's about it. I think I'll just keep it moving if I'm ever hungry near Hulen again."
