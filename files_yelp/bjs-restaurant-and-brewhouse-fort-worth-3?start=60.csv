CS L.,"Crowley, TX",0,43,18,5.0,11/6/2015,"Ok I've tended to be underwhelmed with BJs but tonite was off the chain.  Tony was our server - he was fantastic. Attentive, thoughtful, quick, good communicator. Best service I've ever had at BJs and comparable to any other place in town that costs less than $50/pp.  As for the rest, all I'm saying is root beer wings and pumpkin pizookie.  Wow.  If I could eat like that here every time I would eat here every time. ------------------------------- Okay this is the second time in a row we had both killer service (Brittany!) and the food was excellent (blackened shrimp tacos - fantastic)(AND another pumpkin pizookie).  BJ's is totally back on my map..."
Sherry P.,"White Settlement, TX",14,2,,5.0,1/15/2016,Awesome place my husband and I go for the pizza . He enjoys their blonde beer that they brew. We go once every couple of months
Ashley S.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,12,,1.0,12/19/2014,I had a order to go here wasted $72.98. We got home and the entire order was wrong.  Idk if they gave me someone else order but the manager got a lil nasty asking why we didn't check beforw i left. Well sir i teuated that you all xould do ur job right. He told me to bring the food back once i got there the girl said he was fone for the night and there wasnt anyone there to approve an exchange.
The Kiwi B.,"South Belt/Ellington, Houston, TX",0,7,,1.0,12/24/2013,If you want a mixed drink its very highly recommended that you ask your server regarding the ability of the bartender. They have a new bartender who was once a server and was promoted to bartender. ... clam chowder was good. Everything else was mediocre at best and over priced considering.  Manegment I would consider to be incompetent at best... might want to try red robbins next door.
Brian L.,"Fort Worth, TX",68,21,9,4.0,1/19/2015,Great food and service here. I love the wings and frito nachos. The sandwiches and lunch menu are great. Good beer too.
Jim K.,"Fort Worth, TX",24,24,3,4.0,10/19/2012,"Food, Beer and Service is always consistantly good. Some places, the draft beer does not taste right.  Flat, stake, metallic,  Here the draft beer is always good.  Cold, bubbly and a large select with changing options.  The Santa Fe Spring Rolls are quite tasty. Can't go wrong with the pizza or burger."
Auckberious H.,"Fort Worth, TX",10,54,3,1.0,3/25/2015,This place simply feels like I'm giving someone a bj  because I feel like I'm getting fugged every time I get a Togo order they mess it up and it sticks to the box and its not all the way cooked in the center and this is tge 2nd time this happened  at this location
Jimmie H.,"Burleson, TX",90,472,2926,4.0,11/17/2011,"The menu at this place is an experience. It's going to be quite an adventure making my way through it. There's so many great choices, it's always hard to decide. The jambalaya is one of my favorites but it's about twice as much as what the average person can eat, so it's definitely worth sharing. And it's really spicy...and I love my food spicy. The pizzas and hamburgers are also really good and creative. The desserts...well they have to be eaten to be believed. They have a creation there called the Pizookie which is a cookie cooked in a personal pan pizza dish. And they have tons of varieties with different toppings. Seriously, check it out."
J P.,"Grandview, TX",0,19,,1.0,6/21/2015,"First time to BJs.   Will not be returning.  Small portions on the fish and chip and worst chicken fried steak ever.   Burgers were small for the giant bun they were served on.  Service was friendly,  but could not makeup for the overpriced terrible food."
Caroline N.,"Fort Worth, TX",4,10,4,1.0,6/16/2015,"Usually love the selection and the wait staff but the kitchen is having issues and the manager doesn't know how to perform service recovery. Until they get it fixed, expect long waits for food and incorrect orders."
Kendall B.,"Fort Worth, TX",8,81,33,5.0,6/13/2015,"My family's favorite place to go out, we eat here for Mother's Day, birthdays and anything else to celebrate, it's our go to place, they have excellent house root beer, the pozookis are amazing and I love the balsamic chicken on a bed of spinach with a side of rice, they have low calorie options and the soups are so good, never had any problems, we've always had the best servers."
Chris G.,"Lakeside, CA",6,9,,1.0,6/14/2015,"I've been a fan of this slightly overpriced chain for almost 10 years now, and this location is one of the worst run restaurants I've ever been to period. Once we were seated we waited over 10 minutes before our server even showed up, in fact we were 1 min and 15 seconds from walking out the door. Our server only had 3 tables, none were large parties and we barely saw here, much less any other staff- except THREE hostesses in the front doing absolutely nothing. Refills were few and far between. All the staff were basically emotionless and showed little pride in their work. The food was fine, except my wife now has food poisoning after order I the mahi tacos! We weren't offered dessert until our food was well finished, and we had to wait even longer for the bill. Begrudgingly I left a 7% tip, which is more than our server deserved which is sad because we were trying to celebrate my new job. We may never come back to this location, and I can't recommend that you do. Red Robin is next door or go to the Arlington location. This location is terrible and the management needs to be fired as well as the wait staff. Whatever you do, don't give undeserved tips."
Audrey K.,"Mansfield, TX",0,38,,4.0,7/19/2015,Ordered Mediterranean chicken pita. The pitas were pretty good. Pita bread tasted great. The Mediterranean side was something I had never tasted and didn't care to. I would not order this plate again. Should have gotten the pizza. Good environment!
Frank S.,"Fort Worth, TX",793,143,30,3.0,9/3/2013,"This place has way too big of a menu. What do you specialize in when you have 8 pages of food. I like selection, but this was too much. We went on Sunday after church, place was half full, bad sign. It looked like they had a great beer selection, but the food we got was not up to par. Also, a bit over priced. $17.95 for salmon, side and salad. Salmon was meh, it DID NOT look like the picture in the menu.  My wife had the CFS. Steak was chewy, gravy was old looking. She no likey.... My grandbaby had mac-n-cheese. Worst Mac ever! The reason for the three stars is the place is really cool looking, it seems like a great place to grab a brew, and our server was very sweet. We may go back for happy hour, but not the food."
Hollyanne S.,"San Diego, CA",947,297,211,5.0,1/29/2014,Love BJs! Ha! So many options like a 5 page menu of choices!!! Prices are higher than the average bear but I love it.
Mark B.,"Fort Worth, TX",9,28,7,1.0,3/24/2013,"Our first trip to BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse was on a Saturday evening so we knew it would be busy.   The whole evening was a series of ups and downs that ultimately made me wish I had chosen a different location. The first signals that it might not be a good evening started when the hostess said it was a 15 minute wait that turned into a 30 minute wait.  While we were waiting several other folks ahead of us handed in their pagers and left. Once we were seated, our waiter appeared promptly took our drink and appetizer orders.  Both of which showed up fast!  The calamari and cheese sticks were both tasty.  But we had no silverware and the plates he gave us were dirty.   Ugh.   So after eating with fingers, no plates, and no napkins for 10 minutes  I managed to flag down a different waiter and resolve these issues. Oh one more thing, my beer was warm...another sign things were not on the right track.  After 15 minutes our original waiter reappears to take our food order.  And then disappears without refilling the water glasses or even asking about a second ale for me.  Another 30 minutes go by with no sign of our waiter; so I finally catch the manager and ask him for help with our food.    5 minutes later our entrees arrive; the wife's salad is ok, the daughter's chicken strips arrive but without fries, and my burger is cooked to a cinder but is tepid and cold.  I try to make the best of it but I couldn't eat more than a 1/3 of the burger.  By then the waiter reappears with my daughters ""smiley"" fries; not bad for french fried mashed potato faces but late again none the less. I send my burger back and we all decide to wrap up the meal.  Dessert would have probably taken another hour at the rate things were going.... The manager ended up comping my burger but nothing else for our delay, bad service and overall bad experience.  If all you want is a light snack of appetizers and drinks, this might be your kind of joint; but, for a full service meal, this place stinks.  So I'm unlikely to return till I see a big sign that reads ""under new management"".   I hope someone has a better experience at this joint than I did."
Tyler V.,"Fort Worth, TX",26,20,5,5.0,10/8/2014,Had a great experience Sunday after church at BJs. The service was speedy while also being very polite. Plenty of tvs to watch Sunday football games while not being obvious to the wife you're watching the game. Plus they have great homemade beers on tap. Awesome selections for girls and guys.
Sherry H.,"Fort Worth, TX",179,41,3,2.0,11/17/2014,"Beer dinners are usually fun.  Seems like they got cheap on them.  When we didn't care for a certain beer, they scowled at us...the same thing happened when we didn't care for one of the courses.  The staff whispered about us which was very uncomfortable too."
Ashley K.,"Oak Harbor, WA",0,17,1,4.0,2/10/2014,"I've eaten there twice since this location has opened, each time the food, service, atmosphere etc., has been above average.   We enjoy the signature beer flavors immensely (sampled 4 different ones, all equally impressive in their own respect) and the parmesan chicken is to die for!"
Lauren N.,"Fort Worth, TX",421,1308,3098,2.0,12/4/2012,I really wanted to love this place. I went here for lunch today with 2 of my coworkers. We waited over 10 minutes at the front host stand for someone to come seat us. There were a few other people who came in behind us who waited too. Maybe the host was in a break? Someone should have been watching the door... Once we were seated our server explained the menu well and we ordered drinks and a appetizer to share. She dropped off our drinks and then we didn't see her again till we had someone find her. Our appetizer was dropped off by someone else. I had to flag someone down for small plates to eat our appetizer. Someone different brought our main meals- we had to flag someone to bring ketchup. Once we finished eating we had to flag someone else to get our checks. Very poor service. Unorganized and I don't feel like I should search for service! The food was tasty- grabbing lunch should be a quick thing- maybe 45 minutes tops. We didn't leave until 1 hour and 15 minutes after we arrived. I may try them again and sit in the bar where I won't have to flag anyone. Maybe.
