Nichole M.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,4,,1.0,8/13/2016,"Worst service I've ever received. My family went to have a college farewell for one of our teens. First The waiter didn't submit everyone's food order. And it took asking 3 difft waiters before someone said it was never submitted. One of our children didn't receive her food until dinner was over. I had a simple turkey burger and salad greens with vinaigrette. The salad wasn't like I ordered. I asked if it could be fixed. Waiter returned with a completely difft type of salad with ranch dressing and additional toppings. I turned it down and asked could I just have the salad I ordered. His response was this is the salad and I just added ranch on the vinaigrette and croutons and carrots. He became upset when I said I didn't want it, I wanted what I ordered. Walked away and slammed the plate on the table behind us. The waiter working with the opposite end of our party had their tickets ready and returned with receipts in minutes. We waited 45 minutes for him to bring our tickets. He only came once we called for the manager 2x. Never going back"
Jack H.,"Fort Worth, TX",82,75,248,2.0,6/27/2014,"Way underwhelmed. Bj's was not at all what I expected. Inside looks so welcoming and warm. The bar looks amazing. The service was good, friendly , attentive and quick. The menu is massive. How many pages do they need? I didn't realize I had to read a book   to order. The choices are all over the place, from seafood, pizza, pasta , burgers , steak, and more! Calamari was tender and good portion, although the batter tasted burnt. Or maybe cooked in old grease. My steak was overcooked  and I ended up sending it back. The manger was very apologetic and my new steak came out very quickly. The meat had no seasoning, well cooked but no flavor. Rice pilaf tasted like old rice a roni. My wife had chicken fried steak, again the batter tasted like they hadn't changed out the grease in a while. The white cheddar mashed potatoes however were amazing. I wish I had more. So creamy and flavorful. For dessert we had a salted Carmel pizookie? A warm delicious Carmel cookie with white chocolate and pretzel pieces. Carmel sauce on top. It was so rich 2 bites were enough, but it was quite yummy. Overall the service was nice but the food was bland and dull. Maybe we ordered the wrong food but it just wasn't good."
My L.,"Fort Worth, TX",1,13,2,4.0,5/10/2014,"Ate here with a friend not too long ago. we mostly ordered appetizers and snacks to share and some tea. Can't say it was bad but what bothered me the most was the server. I can't remember her name but I do remember how rude she was. Never refilled out drinks and never checked up on us. When I dine out I really looked forward to the service provided. Food can be fixed, attitude cannot. I would definitely come back but I would hope to find a better server."
Chuck P.,"Fort Worth, TX",8,48,75,3.0,6/15/2014,"Well, after I cleaned the silverware, we waited for our app. Quite a while.  Finally got it 5min before our entree....perfect(not).  My Cajun pasta with chicken was good, especially since I asked our server to tell them double spice.  Kids burgers were kinda  super small.  Chicken parm was good.  I can certainly tell prices have increased, and service has decreased.  The BJ reward card is a nice way for your server to disappear by telling you ""you don't have to wait on me you can pay with our app."" Perfect since I never wanted a refill.  Over all BJ's has gone down each year.  We used to have to go and wait 45min to an hour.  The last several times we have gone the place has been less than half full....Hulen mall location is definitely not the same..don't know about Arlington or alliance location.  3stars was for the food only and the fact we did not have a wait."
Brian H.,"Austin, TX",153,36,,4.0,3/20/2012,"I shall preface this by saying that I am a chain hater of the highest order.  Im all about local, and I have some innate enmity against the homogenization of culture and cuisine.   That said, I have a secret love for BJs!  But who doesn't?  They have a fantastically wide selection of food.  Never had anything I didn't like there.  On this occasion I had the fish and chips, and they were truly the best I've had in years.  Their brews are great (not quite as good as Uncle Billy's in Austin, but quite good)  I particularly like the piranna ale for its crisp bite and full hoppy flavor. The service was prompt and friendly.  Their menu ranges from pizza and burgers to fish, salads and steaks with a wide range of various appetizers. They only get 4 stars because chains don't get 5.  Its a rule.  Support your local mom and pop restaurants.  Well, and maybe BJs.  Just don't tell anyone."
Leah P.,"Fort Worth, TX",52,89,46,4.0,4/28/2014,"This has become my husband's favorite place in our area. Everything we've tried has been wonderful! I'm a huge fan of their pizza and salad combo during lunch, perfect amount of each! The bar is well stocked with different varieties as far as beer on tap. The only reason this place doesn't get a 5 star from me is the noise level. The music is always too loud, I normally can't hear anyone."
Athena S.,"Fort Worth, TX",129,44,6,3.0,9/10/2014,"Been to this location, the location in Hurst and the location in Arlington....they are ok...Service is pretty good...but it does take a minute before your food actually arrives...Will probably go back if I have some type of coupon or deal."
Ryan F.,"Fort Worth, TX",272,301,71,4.0,11/21/2011,"I can't agree more with Jimmie H's review- there is a lot going on with this menu and lots of choices between many different areas of cuisine.  As a brewhouse, there's a great selection of microbrews crafted in-house, as well as a large selection of wordly beers on draft and bottle. Hard to describe, but the atmosphere is private yet not confining.  The bar is gorgeous, with the bottles displayed on the backsplash.  The nicest decoration though: the happy hour menu.  Great values and offerings on beers and appetizers, including a great range of qualifying times to enjoy them. So I got a chance to try three different beers from their menu and was impressed.  Great malt and hop characters and expressly fresh.  As far as the menu was concerned, I settled on the jalapeno burger with thin fries and it was awesome.  The lightly fried jalapenos could have been an appetizer of their own, but as a topping, gave the burger an entirely unique character.  I can't take credit for choosing the burger outright though- my server, Jason, was extremely helpful and recommended it to begin with.  Not only was the flavor great, but it was a lot  of burger for the price as well. In reflection of our experience, everything was great: food, drinks, atmosphere, and service.  We discussed coming back to try more from both the beer and food menus, and coupled with the first experience, definitely warrants the 4 Star rating.  Another trip or two will probably upgrade them to 5 Stars, but especially if we have Jason to serve us again.  Being in the industry, I can never stop judging service and servers alike, and admittedly am a tough one to please.  Jason though was awesome.  It was the perfect balance of friendly, helpful, knowledgeable, and fun.  Even if I could write line after line about the restaurant, it wouldn't be fair to describe the service because I couldn't do it justice.  If you go, ask for Jason and you can thank me later...."
Craig J.,"Wheeling, WV",266,95,28,4.0,11/9/2012,"I've been going to BJ's for a few years. I have tried just about everything on their extensive menu. There is literally nothing there that i've tried and haven't loved. They make some of the best pizza around, their chicken parm is amazing and their fresh baked pizookies (cookies backed in a pan like pizza) are to die for. On top of that, they brew their own beer and they pair will with the food! They have a very extensive menu which ranges from pan seared ahi tuna to italian fare to down home American comfort foods. I challenge you to go there and NOT be able to find something that floats your boat. This location in particular is great. Its staff is great and I've always been taken care of when I went there. Atmosphere is fun like a sports bar. I love the decor and of course I love the food. You will not be disapointed!"
Marcus P.,"Fort Worth, TX",10,33,23,3.0,6/28/2014,"If I could give this place 3.5 stars I would. The menu has a vast selection of entrees. I consider it to be a smaller Cheesecake Factory. There are a few selections that are great, like the Parmesan Crusted Chicken, but I had their pizza the other night (which is what they consider their speciality) and it wasn't that great. My order was the Bacon Ranch pizza...Too Ranchy, if that makes sense. Feels like they poured Hidden Valley Ranch on it. Wasn't my favorite meal. Go here if you like to have a good variety of options."
Tess F.,"Savannah, GA",2,10,2,5.0,2/9/2015,We went there for the first time today and had a wonderful experience. The food was amazing. My husband got the tomato soup in a bread bowl along with the Mahi tacos. I got the fried chicken and we shared the spinach artichoke dip. It was all exceptional. Our service was also amazing. Out waiter's  name was Jack. His help alone would be a reason to return. It's too bad we're not from the area.
Sheri O.,"Burleson, TX",0,62,,3.0,12/30/2014,I LOVE their food (especially pizookies) but we seem to usually have bad service here.  Last time we went my husband waited on a drink refill for 10 minutes.  They weren't busy so I have no idea what the issue was besides the server sucking.  I will keep going back but wish they had better service.
Ryan S.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,8,2,3.0,9/1/2014,Not bad...but not worth the $$ either. The hand tossed Pizza was dissapointing and my chicken fetuccini pasta was ok. Service was good and the set up inside is nice..reminds me of the cheesecake factory except not as good. Maybe I will have to try something else on their menu.
John W.,"Fort Worth, TX",6,33,21,4.0,5/2/2014,"Best place on hulen south of the loop,  good food and great beer from lite to Dark and everything in between"
Antonio M.,"Fort Worth, TX",3,3,,2.0,1/4/2014,"Food was alright and had to wait on the waitress several times. I ordered 4 cheese blend pizza and thought it was a Tostitos pizza. Not a good place to watch game, the televisions were too far apart. Overall I give it a 2."
Brandi L.,"Westminster, CA",297,38,55,4.0,2/1/2014,"Nothing to brag about. I can't remember our server name, which should be a indicator how memorable the staff was. He was friendly and answered all of questions about allergies to the best of his knowledge. When he didn't know the answer he went to try to figure it out, but the manager didn't have the answer. He was patient with us, which is why they are getting 4 out 5 and not 3."
Joe D.,"Burleson, TX",45,8,11,2.0,11/16/2013,"Soon as we walked in we were greeted by a young lady who didn't smile, welcome us and seemed like she hated being there. Waiter was great but had to go back to the kitchen several times to correct our order. Started off with the soup being cold then steak was way undercooked. Had to wait 10 minutes to get food back and it was still undercooked.....x this off my list"
Tiffany M.,"Fort Worth, TX",19,3,,1.0,8/21/2013,"Worst service I have EVERRRRRR had! Went with two other people.  Took over an HOUR to get our meal.  The server ONLY came to the table when he had to!!! Kept blame other people.  Our order didn't come out right and mine tasted like butane!! The manager came over THREE times to apologize. And told us he was sorry, we can get a 25% discount and if we wanted anything else.   I'm still hungry so we ordered pazookis ..... Took about 16 mins.  And they weren't discounted.   Wow...... Never again will I come to this location.   Ever!!!! So upset!"
John B.,"Grand Prairie, TX",40,294,17,3.0,12/15/2011,"Pretty good.  I will definitely return for the beers, as I liked their signature flavors.  The food is good, and there is probably something for everyone, as the menu is very extensive.  I haven't tried everything yet, but I'm afraid I might have to apply the same tag that I used to describe the Cheesecake Factory, which is the ""Jack of all trades, master of none,"" because everything is OK, but they don't have anything that stands out as a signature dish.  The Pizookie sounds awesome, but I've never had a chance to try it at any other locations or this one. I think it's a good idea to place this restaurant here.  I wouldn't mind stopping in for a few craft beers while Mrs. B does some Christmas shopping at Hulen Mall, but I'm not sure that I would go there on my own."
Christina P.,"Fort Worth, TX",28,5,,4.0,1/29/2014,Best dessert in town. I love that its a bit more noisy then other restaurants. I unfortunately had a lame waiter the last time I was there. he seemed a bit spacey.
