Nicole S.,"Keller, TX",194,224,301,4.0,7/19/2017,"I love BJs!  I've been to this location twice. I usually go to the one in Hurst. I love that they have a light section on the menu so I can still enjoy a good meal without all the calories.  I've always been happy with the food here except for tonight. But I will still give it 4 stars because this was the first time I wasn't happy about the food and I've been coming here for years. I ordered the Roasted Chicken Peruvian Quinoa Bowl. The chicken was great; however, the rest was not. They put waaay TOO MUCH lemon juice on the rice and spinach and it was so sour that I could only take two bites!   But I will come back because I love the food here!"
Tyler M.,"Corinth, NY",0,11,4,2.0,10/2/2017,"I'm a waiter at a restaurant, so I'm very easy going with service. Me and my mother were stoping in to check it out. We sat outside on the patio which was nice. We sat down for about 5 minutes, still no service. Finally the waiter comes by and says ""I'll be right with you guys."" Another 5 minutes go by, and we don't even have drinks on our table.  By this point we just thought about getting up and leaving. One he comes back we finally put in our drink orders. Another waitress comes by and tries to drop off an appetizer that isn't even ours, twice. After we got our drinks, it took another 15-20 minutes just to order our food. We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip. It had huge chunks or artichoke. Nasty. 2 minutes after our appetizer came out, our food comes out right after. My mother ordered chicken and mash potatoes with rice.  The mash potatoes tasted like something you get out of a box. I ordered the ribs which were delicious which is why the review is not getting a one star.  I don't recommend going here, service is awful.  Once we were about to get up and leave, we noticed 2 other tables haven't been helped yet and also waited just as long as we did. Go spend your money somewhere else other than here."
Angela M.,"Keller, TX",157,90,133,3.0,7/19/2017,"We go to BJs if we can't make up our mind on what we want to eat since they have a big menu.  Their avocado egg rolls are a must and my favorite item in their menu. I do like how BJ's has their own craft beers. Their Porter is my favorite.  The ahi tuna salad is good too but beware of the little dollops of wasabi they put around the plate! I thought it was avocado dressing or something and almost died eating the whole dollop of wasabi haha. This location has decent service. Not great, not terrible, just okay."
Thomas D.,"Tampa, FL",33,3,1,5.0,12/29/2017,We're from Georgia and are visiting family for the holidays. Every restaurant we've been to in the Ft. Worth area has been great but BJ's so far is the best. To top it all off we had the BEST server we've had in years.... Kaylee! Everyone's food was superb.
Somchai I.,"Haltom City, TX",288,461,69,4.0,5/23/2017,"I've generally steered away from Bj's, ive just had so many hit or miss at them so trying new ones isn't something i wanted to do. but glad i did. firstly, this location is in a popular area of alliance so it can be busy, but good thing this time it wasnt and i was seated immediately.  next, their menu is vast, it rivals cheesecake factories what 20 pages? which is just too much, esp since i was hesitant to even go i wasnt sure what to order. I wanted pasta, but last time i had it, i hated it. so i wanted to try something simple a chicken dish. but no that dissapointed me last time. so i got the pork chops this time with the white cheddar mashed pot. and grilled asparagus. it was superb, in fact i ate with 3 other people and i almost didnt want to share it with them. but good food has to be shared! the seasoning simple, and the cook was executed correctly. the mashed potatoes were a good filler along with the asp. my friends order pizza and a salad, the ahi salad was well plated but didnt taste it, my friends pizzas were good looking but very basic, not something id want to order so im glad i didnt get it. I did get a slice of the Bj's favs and its basically a supreme pizza and it just tasted boring. i tried the house Stout, it was different tasting, i did like it but its not one id have to have if i was craving beer so good attempt. again bj's is hit or miss depending on what you order but i was happy with my latest experience so i decided to write."
Shelli S.,"Fort Worth, TX",12,7,,1.0,10/31/2017,"Terrible service.  Sat down and ordered two glasses of water, a bottle of wine and two appetizers. The appetizers came out.. no water, no plates, no silverware. Added a third item.. it came out... still no bottle of wine.  15 minuets later waitress came by and said they couldn't find any of the wine. So I ordered a glass of some thing different. It took another 15 minuets to get that. By then we are almost done with the food.  Waited another 10 plus minuets just to get the bill.  Will never go back!  Bad thing is the place was not even that busy!!"
John Q.,"Fort Worth, TX",12,298,56,5.0,12/13/2016,We've been to several BJ's and this one is as good as the rest of them.  We always sit at the bar and the bar tenders are always excellent.  I love the seasonal beers from BJ's and the food always impresses. We will be back many many more times.
Kyle B.,"Irving, TX",17,87,63,1.0,8/3/2016,This was by far the worst BJs I have ever visited. The severs were all untrained and unpleasant teenagers who clearly do not want to work there. They were dressed sloppy and spent the majority of their time loudly talking with the other kids. The food was so-so and definitely not worth the money they charged for it. The drinks delivered from the bar were watered down. Should've stuck to beer because the bartenders obviously don't care either.  I'd drive the extra few miles to another location if you are craving a pizookie or whatever it's called.
Brian W.,"Cooper, TX",33,250,655,3.0,9/22/2016,"Wait staff was very friendly today at lunch. That is the pro.  The negatives include a long hair in a menu, gummy bottomed pizza, salad with way too much dressing and the chili was just so-so."
Ilsa M.,"Jacksonville, FL",354,283,395,5.0,7/10/2016,"Came here tonight with my close friend to have a girls night dinner.   I've been to BJ's before but I really liked this location. The interior was clean and very accommodating. The hostess sat us right away at a comfortable table.  To drink:  I ordered the Blonde Ale that is brewed at Bjs and it was delicious! So light and had such a wonderful flavor.   To eat: I started with a Caesar salad. It was well made and fresh. For my entree, I ordered a mini deep dish vegetarian pizza. This was the perfect size for one person in my opinion. It was so yummy.   Overall our experience was great! Love this place. Thank you!"
Scotchonthe R.,"Keller, TX",0,10,3,2.0,5/5/2017,The waitress came out picked up her receipt and bill off the ground. Left the mess and went back inside. Stellar Maybe she's feeding the birds
Linn P.,"Fort Worth, TX",255,396,547,4.0,2/21/2016,So I came here again for lunch with some friends. today was a better day. Probably because there were just 3 of us and not a big group. But I enjoyed today's visit.  I ordered the Chicken Balsamic. The chicken was very tender and moist. Pleasant surprise. I am always iffy about ordering chicken because a lot of time it comes out dry. I did ask for more balsamic on the side. It had a light drizzle on the chicken and salad. The mashed potato was very good and tasted delicious with the balsamic glaze on it.  Ordered the triple chocolate pizookie. DELICIOUS!!!!!! SOOOO frickin delicious!!!!  My friends all liked their dishes and all the dishes came out correct. Our server was nice and attentive and came and checked up on us frequently.  I got a strawberry splash which was like a pina colada with strawberry puree in it. It tasted good.  I could come back. Especially for the cookie! =P
Brianna W.,"Arlington, TX",2,12,22,2.0,9/27/2016,"The two stars are for how professional and friendly the staff were. The lack of stars is because of the service I received. I called in a pick up order of dry rub siracha wings/fried hard/all flats ranch/blue cheese and also an order of fries. After coming to the bar and being told my order wasn't placed, he compd the meal and we left to eat. At 10:30 pm starving and having to wait an extra 20 mins I open up my bag and there are no fries, one sauce, and wings were not fried hard. Please Bj's you are the only place close to my apartment, do better."
Kim L.,"Cookeville, TN",11,5,1,4.0,10/10/2017,Love the friendly environment and how it was set up.  I tried the pumpkin ale and enjoyed it.  I ordered the clam chowder in a sourdough bowl and absolutely loved it.  My main course was the New Orleans Jambalaya which I didn't care to much for.  There seemed to be a spice they added that threw it off.  I would definitely return because they had such a wide variety of food to select from.
Cecilia P.,"Fort Worth, TX",222,326,770,3.0,2/7/2016,I've have came here a couple times and tried different dishes. I love they have a wide variety of cocktails and beers. Their known for their pizza but their pizza is nothing amazing to me. The clam chowder is actually pretty good.  The other day I ordered a burger that had guacamole and bacon. Huge burger but again an average burger. Their pizookies is a great finisher. I'll come back here for drinks.
Patti O.,"Martinez, CA",0,6,,2.0,1/11/2017,"I am giving 2 stars primarily due to the service. Using the curbside option, I placed an order at 4:30 to be picked up at 6:30. At 6:30 I pulled into the parking space for curbside pickup and called the number. It rang many times, with no answer. I finally went to the takeout window, but there was no one there. When someone finally arrived, I told her I had curbside, and she said she would have brought it out. She then advised that the order would be ready in 5-7 minutes and seemed to be surprised that I expected it to be ready at 6:30!!! So, did she expect that I would sit and wait in the car until she bothered to advise me that there would be a delay. And, why was there even a delay when I designated the time. I have ordered on line for pickup at other restaurants with no problem.  As to the food, I ordered the Kale and Brussel sprout salad. At most, there was the equivalent of 2 brussel sprouts on the entire salad. I don't think BJs will be getting any of my future business."
Carl D.,"Justin, TX",12,13,5,4.0,5/31/2017,"Good food but the steaks aren't cooked the way ordered. Good service, friendly staff."
adam m.,"Suwanee, GA",42,6,,4.0,8/19/2016,Great for a chain brew house. Went twice in a row for lunch and got Taylor both times. Her timing and attentiveness was perfect both times--checks on you but doesn't crowd the table.  Gave great recommendations and didn't take the bait when a pal ordered the portabello and promptly asked what the mushrooms were.  It's nice to see people not react poorly when helping those not familiar with food preparation.  Try the bread bowls (soup). Delish.  I might go try the beer right now.
Lisa W.,"Grapevine, TX",22,40,19,1.0,6/17/2016,We ate almost all of our dessert before we new it came w/toppings. The toppings were served to us after our dessert. What really sucked is they charged us for it.
Marty T.,"Sanger, TX",2,7,,2.0,1/16/2017,Worst service ever today. We were the second table for lunch. Took 50 min to get our order. Only one waitstaff was working while others were standing around. Told waitress we needed to get to a movie and short on time so bring the ticket while we are eating. She brought ticket and it had incorrect charges. Some of the order from our table and some from the table that was sitting next to us. Then when it was right she took our cards and forgot to remember what card to charge each bill to. Paying the bill took longer than eating the meal. Still finished meal and had to wait on check. And did not get out in time to make movie in same parking lot as our lunch meal took 1.5 hours in restaurant that was not even busy yet. Don't go here if short on time AND be sure to check charges on your ticket!!!!
Farisa C.,"Fort Worth, TX",78,30,11,2.0,12/18/2016,Hour wait for wings that weren't easy on the eyes. .........................slow service and it wasn't completely full.... the waitress forgot our order. :(. I know it was an accident but it just wasn't a good experience.
Suzie M.,"Fort Worth, TX",1,83,37,1.0,7/16/2016,"If I could give ZERO STARS I would. I've been here many times. Mediocre food from a TOO BIG menu.  The server Randi did an absolutely terrible job. We sat with no drinks BEGGING for refills. She did not ask specifics about my order and it came out wrong.  She never apologized and spoke too softly (in a very loud restaurant). The manager was no better. He did not introduce himself...then ran by and said ""took them both off your bill."" Sure enough we were charged twice. My entire table of 4 were done eating and my meal was brought in a ""to go"" box. They could be really good (like other locations) but never seem to have their act together."
Melissa R.,"Keller, TX",33,28,26,5.0,6/17/2016,"This is me of my favorite restaurants. More for the desert than anything else! Our treats for birthdays is going out to eat. This has become a couple of our favorites. Of course I get blamed for them picking this one because I love it so much. Some of the things I have had here are the Chicken Parmesan with the mash potatoes great meal normally one of the ones that I will order. I have also had recently the salmon with cherry sauce and it was amazing and healthy! I have also, just this past week on my daughter's birthday, ordered the California chicken club sandwich and it was amazing. It wasn't the first time that I have ordered this one either :) Now the piece de resistance desert... One word ""Pazokie"" it is this amazing chocolate chip cookie baked and presented to you with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. Now I'm sure that there are other deserts at BJ's. But I have never ventured from this amazing one! I have went specifically for the Pazokie and it is well worth it to go just for that. Hope this has been useful to at least one person!"
Elyse L.,"Euless, TX",599,677,1990,4.0,9/22/2014,"I frequent this chain often as I am a rewards card holder (sign up, it's free!) and earn points and coupons towards meals when eating here. The service is hit or miss but for my visit here it was great. I met my mom and brother for lunch and got there early so I started by trying a sample of their octoberfest brew. They will let you sample any beer you want for a small fee and even have cute sample mugs.  It was too bitter for my taste so I went with my normal favorite, their blonde. It's deliciously mellow. I also like to start with their bacon corn fritters. They come sitting on an aioli that is slightly spicy and garnished with more bacon bits, corn, and green onion. I dare you to have just one ;-)  I've ordered many different things here that were all good, but I'm in love with their enlightened Thai chicken salad. It has thinly sliced bell peppers, grilled chicken, mango, jicama, avocado, sesame seeds, and an Asian chili dressing that is to die for. Plus it's healthy so as an added bonus I feel less guilty ordering a pzookie for dessert! Their salted caramel one is my favorite thus far with almond toffee, pretzel bits, a warm cookie, vanilla bean ice cream, and warm caramel drizzle. YUM! I have both friends and family members who are picky eaters and everyone seems to get along just fine here. It makes it an easy go to meeting place as well as a last minute dinner idea"
Vanessa A.,"Fort Worth, TX",40,23,1,2.0,7/30/2017,"I placed an online order last night at this location for curbside pick up, thinking I'd be in and out. I paid online at the time I placed my order and arrived to pick it up by 6 pm as requested. The waiter came out and took my card again, and I gave it to him thinking that he just needed to verify the information, but he went to run it again. When he came back to my car I asked him to verify that I would not be charged twice for the order because I'd already paid online. He hesitated and said that if I had paid online that's probably why the card hadn't gone through again and that I wouldn't be charged twice. He assured me that it would only be another few minutes for my food. When the food was ready, it was about 20 minutes past the initially requested time. A different server came out and asked us to check the food, and then requested payment. I let her know we had paid online and I verified that the funds had already come out of my account. She said the order still showed open. I told her I had already asked the other server about this as he attempted to run my card a second time. At that point she said ""Ok, have a good night,"" and left. No receipt, no checking with anyone else, just turned and left. To be fair, prior to arriving I had received an email confirming my payment and order, so I'm not sure why this information wasn't received on the restaurant's end. I really feel like it shouldn't be that complicated to place an online order, pay ahead, and pick it up. They made me feel like I was trying to steal something!"
Scott B.,"Big Spring, TX",13,410,303,4.0,1/12/2017,"All food here is moderately priced, and good. The best value here (and of any chain eatery?) is the Pizzookie Sampler. Those mini-pizzokies give a new definition to the term Sugar High. Warm, gooey greatness x3, each with a huge scoop of ice cream. Near dessert perfection. It's a steal for $10.00. Just get in a good workout beforehand..."
Dan M.,"Fort Worth, TX",5,90,34,1.0,4/3/2016,"We used to love the pizza they have here but recently it hasn't been very good. Not sure why. Stopped in a few nights ago and both of us had the French dip sandwich, I believe they have a fancy name for it but it is a French dip with au jus. Couldn't even finish the sandwiches because the beef was so tough and nasty. I'm not planning on going back. Only reason we did this last time is they always send email coupons. Not worth it. Too many good restaurants within a mile or two of this place."
Blessing B.,"Fort Worth, TX",115,149,86,4.0,6/7/2016,"I've only been to this location of BJs once and I liked it. Try the pizookie you won't be sorry it's so yummy. Their pastas are also pretty good and the portions are a pretty good size I usually end up taking food home. The staff when I went there were pleasant, the inside of the establishment is spacious and nice."
Troy A.,"Keller, TX",1,23,,4.0,1/1/2017,"Very good all around. Wife and I went on New Year's Eve and got seated promptly. Waitress was excellent and food took as long as would be expected. I had bacon guacamole burger which was great. Unlike some other places, they loaded up on the guac, bacon and cheese. My wife had chicken pitas which were good.  Only 4 stars as price point is pretty high relative to other places for comparable food."
Robyn W.,"Fort Worth, TX",22,16,,3.0,12/23/2016,"Great chain brew house. The food is almost always good, with a few occasional exceptions (the only cheese macaroni and cheese is in the name).  The burgers are bland, so try something else - there's a lot of great stuff to choose from. I'm especially fond of the thin crust pizza."
Charmaine D.,"Fort Worth, TX",153,74,209,4.0,4/26/2016,"I LOVE the unlimited soup and salad they have around lunch time during the week.  The clam chowder and tortilla soup are both pretty good.  I've noticed that sometimes they seem unprepared for the lunch rush during the week.  There doesn't seem to be many waiters. Though the food is always hot and the people are nice, we've had to wait quite a bit of time for refills and service."
Jen B.,"Dallas, TX",10,168,285,3.0,4/16/2016,"This was my first time visiting BJ's in a long time.  My folks would go to BJ's almost every week so I got burnt out on it, so when we all decided to go I was looking forward to it. We started out with their southwestern egg rolls and boneless wings with half chipotle dry rub and half buffalo sauce.  The egg rolls were good as always, the dry rub wings were good but they tasted like regular fried wings with a stingy amount of seasoning which had no resemblance of chipotle flavor . The Buffalo sauced wings were good as always. Where the experience went wrong was I decided to do the healthier route so me and my mom decided to share the turkey burger,and my dad got a barbeque chicken pizza. Well ,had I known the burger was going to be a pre-made frozen patty that they just cooked I would have stayed away, it had a odd texture and the burger was not cooked through, it was soft and gummy in the middle.  My dad's pizza was good but i never cared for the tomato chunks they put on top of their pizza. Though we had to take the burger home and finish cooking  it, my experience was pretty good, our waiter was very friendly and attentive and the appetizers were good."
Rhianna L.,"Fargo, ND",4,70,45,5.0,5/29/2016,"After reading the reviews about this place we still decided to try it because it's so close to our house, and I'm glad we did! Busy Sunday night. Service was prompt, nothing got messed up, and my bread bowl soup and triple chocolate cookie edge delicious! Will be back."
Summer R.,"Keller, TX",0,2,,4.0,12/29/2016,"We came for a quick snack on some pizookies, and we got sat in Nicole's section. She was the sweetest server yet! She made great conversation and was very friendly and attentive. The only real thing taking away the fifth star was that it took a bit long for our pizookie trio (monkey bread, peanut butter, and white macadamia - absolutely fantastic) to come out, but they were well worth the wait! I would post a picture - but we ate them too quickly to get one! Thank you Nicole! We'll be back."
Jenn C.,"Tulsa, OK",16,63,14,5.0,1/20/2016,"Great beer on tap, I usually don't care for beer on tap. Chips and salsa is very good. Love the atmosphere. Will return my next visit to the area!"
John S.,"Keller, TX",26,76,26,1.0,11/4/2016,"I am a fan of this chain but this location is horrible. I have been several times in hopes that it will get better, but tonight was just another bad experience. Our waitress was nice but we only saw her a few times the entire night. A guy from the kitchen brings out my wife and cousins wife's salad. We told him we need utensils. He acknowledged us but proceeded to just walk back to the kitchen. We have two young kids under three so we usually have a window of time to be there. It took 30 minutes before we were allowed to order and another 30 to get the food. And unfortunately when we finally got the food is just wasn't what it should have been. Overall I am done with this location and will just have to drive to one of the other locations which is unfortunate because this one is right by my house."
Janeane C.,"Keller, TX",0,6,,1.0,5/13/2017,Good was absolutely disgusting. The steak was poorly seasoned. Spinach and artichoke dip we gross and soda was flat. Price is way to much for mediocre food
Sean R.,"Dallas, TX",42,367,2495,2.0,12/22/2013,This BJ's location is right off the highway amongst the mirage of retail outlets in the area.  The couple of times I have been here during dinner service they are always busy and there is a bit of a wait.  This location in particular has poor service.  How does one screw up food/drink orders after writing them on a notepad?  If it weren't for the wings....  SMH
Brad C.,"Southlake, TX",591,67,11,1.0,1/2/2016,I used to live this place because of the pizza.  But they changed it and we hardly come back.  Thought we would give it a try today - but they can't figure how to sit anyone down.  Amazing Then the hot wings came out cold. So we finished eating waiting for our wings to come back out.  Not a fan.
Thomas D.,"Grapevine, TX",51,12,16,4.0,12/7/2016,"Lunch time service was great, Billy was very attentive. The burgers were perfect. Beer special was nice too."
