Brandon R.,"Fort Worth, TX",11,8,,2.0,1/12/2016,"Jan 2 my family and I encountered an unpleasant hostess at 5:30pm when I asked about a table for a group of 16. I was was told it would take a hour which I understood and my party was slowly coming in, so we waited. Once all of my party came in, we went to the host stand to check on our accommodation. The host said she had two tables she could put together and was waiting on a third table. We had three people not show so we shortened to 13. A few minutes later were were told our table was ready. An extra person came and I went to the hostess to see if we can add one chair. She stares at me and did not say anything to me. The young lady that was going to take my large group to the table finally spoke to me while the other girl stared at me said ""the table is pretty tight as is and won't be able to add one person."" The offers to us a booth beside our table. When we got to the table it was a tight fit. We had all 13 chairs but most of them didn't not have space on the table. 5 of us decided to sit separate in the booth to make sure everyone had elbow room to cut into our Parmesan crusted chicken. The set up wasn't ideal but we love BJ's and was there celebrating a family member's wedding and one going away in the army. The girl that sat us asked a waitress near us if she was taking our table and she looked at us and said no and laughed. Our actual server came and seemed uncomfortable with our set up but was able to get our order: several Parmesan crusted chickens, couple of pizzas, beers, cocktails and several pizookies. During our dinner, the hostess that was unaccommodating and did not speak to me when I asked her about adding a seat, was running around with chairs to help another party. It was strange to see her being helpful and pleasant. My party ate, drank and caught up. My family and I love BJ's brewhouse and go as often as we can. This visit really made us hesitant to return. I am giving this location am two stars only because our waitress was quick and the food was of course good."
Jeff I.,"Frisco, TX",0,1,,1.0,2/4/2015,"I hate this place. I love BJ's,  but this particular location is extremely dysfunctional. My wife and I came in a few hours before they closed last Sunday night and waited for five minutes to be seated.. This wouldn't bother me if they were busy but it was frustrating to stand there and watch the manager goofing around with the staff instead of seating us. I would recommend making the drive to another BJ's location,  it would be worth the extra miles."
David B.,"Keller, TX",0,1,,1.0,2/4/2015,"Worst restaurant ever!! The food is okay but the service is absolutely terrible. I overheard the ""manager"" joking around and being very inappropriate with the wait staff. I was at the restaurant with my kids and was incredibly offended by this.. DONT EVER BRING YOUR KIDS HERE!! I thought this was a family place but I was clearly wrong..."
Hollyanne S.,"San Diego, CA",947,297,211,4.0,1/29/2014,This place has a great choice of food. It has so many choices! There is 5 pages to their menu. The problem is some of the entrees are small in portion size. The pizzas are great. The shareable size isbjust about enough for two. The prices are a tad high too.
Garry B.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,3,2,3.0,6/18/2014,"Greeter could not have been more uninterested in helping us. My wife and I are standing right in front of her and she has to ask ""can I help you?"" .  Then only about a 5 minute wait to be seated on Saturday night was a relief. Food came out fairly quickly. I had Parmesan crusted chicken and mashed potatoes. Very good. Had the peach cobbler pazookie and wish I would have stuck with the old faithful triple chocolate."
James H.,"Mechanicsburg, PA",441,88,7,5.0,12/8/2013,"This place is excellent. Huge menu with hard to choose from excellent food. Attentive service who knows their business. Excellent craft beer that I wish I could buy bottled every day! A bit more expensive than your normal chili's or companies restaurant, but the food and drink is always better!"
Slava Z.,"Denton, TX",0,6,,2.0,10/19/2014,"Pretty nice place, but food is overpriced. Drinks are good and some food is good too, but 22-bucks t-bone stake was chewy and 18-bucks slab of ribs smelled funky. Frankly I wouldn't come back to this restaurant. Service was good though."
JT B.,"El Cajon, CA",4,61,29,1.0,1/25/2015,BAD!!!!!! Poor food need to add that I did talk with the manager Christopher a stand up guy that took care of the problem. I'll try again this week. Still only a one star for this time
Chuck M.,"Fort Worth, TX",1281,673,344,4.0,9/11/2013,"My wife and stopped in for lunch for our regular Thursday lunch date. Since my wife is on a time-crunch for lunch, service is one of our main concerns. BJ's has never let us down. The servers are efficient and our food came out very quickly and served hot! YUM!"
Scott B.,"Tyler, TX",179,571,70,4.0,10/25/2012,"Listen, I love beer. With this being said, I love the fact that BJ's is close to home. Until moving to Texas a year ago, I'd never heard of this chain. Now that I'm in the miserable state of Texas, I love beer even more, and drink, a lot more to cope.  BJ's has become a close, and dear friend over this past year. We've become tight, and I truly do love their micro brews, and the food is above average bar fare, accompanied with an above average price. Now, where the prices are kinda' high, the great service makes up for this. I mean, who really cares about the food, because we come here primarily for the beer. Did I mention that I love beer? The one thing that baffles me about this particular location though, is that I have never had the same server twice. This is odd, and as a former restaurant / bar owner, I'm starting to question if there's some *stuff* going on to drive away the staff. Things that make you go, hmmmm... Great beer, good (pricey) food, and great service, even though I've never seen the same server here twice. I'll continue to return. For the beer."
Jim B.,"Lewisville, TX",68,56,236,3.0,10/21/2013,"Good cider and  eer. The long island ice teas were not good, but we swapped them out for mojitos.  Good service."
Brad M.,"Fort Worth, TX",205,517,160,3.0,7/8/2013,"Saturday night, 9:30pm.  We love the allergen menu! We decided BJ's might be a place away from the crowd for a nice dinner (I was really craving a salad... or a pizza, LOL!).  Typical BJ's... except the drinks ($7.50 for Jack and Diet, really?) were a bit expensive.  I ended up w/ a Burger instead... we split a 6"" White Pizza (really yummy, but a touch underdone-gummy)... but what really got us was the manager, Luke.  We had 2 complaints...first, the toothpick in my sandwich was upside down (normally not a problem) unless that means the plastic part is melting into your burger patty (almost let this slide).  Then found random elements in the bottom of my ""mayo on the side"".  At first we thought it was a french fry... but it was ""on the side"" and didn't come out w/ the french fries.  Then we tried it, and if it was a french fry it was raw.  Our very nice waitress told us it was Jicama.  Fine... but what is it doing in the bottom of my ramekin? C'mon Luke... we appreciate the 25% discount... but why didn't you bother to actually even come to my table?  What's up with that?  From 4 stars to 3... C'mon Luke!"
Sarah L.,"Fort Worth, TX",5,7,1,2.0,2/4/2015,The wait time for food is ridiculous - no matter how busy or slow they are - you're guaranteed to wait 30-60 minutes for the food. Speaking of the food - it's mediocre at best. I would not recommend this place to others.
Mark W.,"New Cumberland, WV",2,81,31,1.0,7/16/2015,"Had their new whiskey river and bacon burger. Awful!  It was dry, bun was burnt,  wouldn't order it again. Sonic's burger if far better than it was."
Paul K.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,18,,1.0,8/9/2015,"Overpriced, small portions, poor service , try too hard to be ""upscale"" in menu choices"
Mark D.,"Denton, TX",2,3,,2.0,1/13/2013,"""Buddy Holly isn't much of a waiter.""  I know that lunchtime on a weekend can be busy, but I would expect a place like this to be prepared for that. We were seated promptly, which was the only part of the service that was timely. When we arrived, we assumed that we could be in and out in an hour. That hope was dashed as soon as our waiter promised our food was ""on its way"" 20 minutes after ordering. He had already pretty well abandoned our table at this point, so we knew we were screwed.  When the food finally did arrive 10 minutes later, it was tasty, no doubt. However, that far from made up for our service.  We asked for the check as our food was being dropped off, and the waiter offered to comp a part of our bill to make up for our wait. Another 10 minutes or so elapsed, and we reminded him about our check.  ""I thought I gave it to you already.""  So much for taking care of us with some token gesture of apology- we were charged for our meal in full. I have generally had okay experiences at the Lewisville location, so I thought we'd give this one a shot.  That's the last time I do that."
John C.,"Fort Worth, TX",4,13,,2.0,6/23/2014,"Open letter to BJ's   To whom it may concern, At first I didn't think this was necessary, but after speaking to a friend about my last 4 experiences at BJ's Alliance he encouraged me to notify the company in the hopes that they can rectify the problems.  I do not have specific date however, I am a Yelp user and I do not hesitate to review my visits.  Currently I have 27 check-ins there, far more than anyone else in this area so I know what good service is and what bad service as it pertains to this location.  In particular, on the last visit with my family for dinner, my wife ordered a California club flat bread pizza.  A customer would tend to believe the menu picture represents the product.  Not at this location.  The pizza had 3 small cubes of avocado, 3 or 4 pieces of grilled chicken and a minimum of other toppings. (This would be the second occasion where your menu photos do not represent the product served at this location.) My wife notified the waitress and the manager came over.  He promptly agreed to bring another more suitable pizza and said it should be out in about 8 to 10 minutes leaving the original on the table ""to nibble on"" until the replacement arrived.  Meanwhile, as everyone else ate his or her dinner my wife nibbled, and nibbled, and nibbled until everyone was finished.  The waitress came over and asked for desert orders and we told her we were still waiting on the replacement pizza. She left and the manager came out a few minutes later with the pizza IN A BOX.  He apologized stating he thought we understood that this pizza was to take home.  If I wanted take out I would have ordered it.  My wife came out to eat, only to be let down.   The Manager comped both pizzas but at this point we decided this was the last time we would spend out money at BJ's.  On the occasion before, that a party of 6 adults had dinner there, my neighbor ordered Fresh Atlantic Salmon, very tasty looking on the menu photo only to receive two small chunks of salmon.  Manager replaced it with a more suitable dish.  Time before that my son ordered a small cheese pizza and was presented with a small peperoni pizza.  Manager came over just by chance and asked how things were; we told him we had the wrong pizza.  He said he could have the correct order out in about 10 minutes.  Everyone was finished dinner before the pizza arrived so my son ended up taking it home.  Time before that the waiter took our order and only brought 1 of two appetizers.  I asked if he forgot the potato skin order and he said yes and he could put it in.  We told him to forget it.  I ordered wedge cut fries and received thin and crispy with my California Burger (best burger out there BTW) then we ordered a pazooki for my kids to share and the next time we see the waiter is when he brings the check.  I asked him if he forgot the desert and he said ""ahhh ill put it in as a birthday order so it may come out with a candle."" Those were the last 4 occasions I visited BJ's.   I love the atmosphere and the food (when its right) the beer especially at BJ's, that's why we, as a family frequented the restaurant.  But after the last 4 times we have decided to go elsewhere.  Cheesecake Factory is opening right next door and we have always received what we ordered at that establishment.  I am sure that will impact the numbers at BJ's Alliance.   I'm not writing this to get something out of BJ's.  I just wanted to give you an opportunity to maybe address the issues and correct them before you loose additional business.   Sincerely, John C Addendum- it's been 13 days since emailing BJ's and I have not received any response  by anyone. It goes to show you how out of touch they are with social media."
Annie A.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,8,,5.0,2/20/2015,My husband & I went out to dinner with friends tonight & loved the food! My portion was so large I have enough for lunch tomorrow. Very impressive & great service even when it's busy. We each found several things on the menu we want to try next time. We can't wait to come back.
Kevin W.,"Newark, TX",47,10,9,2.0,6/9/2014,Usually a decent place to go for dinner and drinks. That was not the case during my last visit. Service was horrible including our waitress walking away while we were still speaking to her. Our cocktails arrived missing the pineapple on the rim of the glass. The experience was not enjoyable at all.
Mike E.,"Fort Worth, TX",8,65,6,1.0,10/27/2014,"Good food but extremely SLOW. Waited 12 minutes from time we sat down to get drinks. Appetizer 15 minutes after we ordered. Main dish 30 minutes after ordered. I ordered the Black and Blue burger (black Angus blue cheese), there may have been a tablespoon of blue cheese! If that's the name of the burger you'd think it would be more predominate. Quickest thing they do is bring the check. 1 hr and 15 minutes from enter to exit. Why BJs, Why can't you get it right???"
