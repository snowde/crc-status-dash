Van R.,"Fort Worth, TX",5,24,,2.0,1/29/2012,"Beer was good.... pricey, but good. Service was Okay We had nachos and they were the worst I've ever had, but since I've never eaten there before I can imagine that other items would be Okay. Over priced though.... Won't go back."
Robert DeAnna C.,"Fort Worth, TX",6,23,8,5.0,12/14/2014,I love this place...  I always get the tomato salad and Asian lettuce wraps.  It never disappoints..  The husband usually gets a bbq sampler.  Its good as well.  The wait staff are friendly and efficient.
Kristi C.,"Fort Worth, TX",75,17,22,4.0,6/30/2013,"Love this place.  Huge menu with a big variety.  Tremendous drink selection (wine, beer and mixed).  Haven't had anything here that I didn't like.  Usually not a long wait either."
Jessie A.,"Dallas, TX",82,315,200,2.0,3/2/2014,"Not a fan of BJ's in CA, but gave it a try again as I haven't been here for probably 6 yrs or so. Again, not a fan. Had the Morrocan salmon - tasted mushy like it was frozen and recooked, not to mention ""fishy"" and not seasoned well. Cous cous was just ok. They do have a large menu, but if that is what you are into, Cheesecake factory has much higher quality food."
Victoria G.,"Fort Worth, TX",45,20,,5.0,7/14/2014,"I think their pizza is hands down delicious! The pazookie out of this world! Jeremiah Red is so good, perfect to go with any meal they serve as well!! Service is average."
Jessica E.,"Keller, TX",13,84,20,2.0,6/3/2014,"The first time I ate here it was magical. Subsequent visits have left much to be desired. I'm not sure if the bar was set too high the first time, but it seems like the food gets worse every time we give it another try."
Sean C.,"Haslet, TX",7,82,172,3.0,11/11/2013,Like the place but seems over priced for what you get. Menu is okay but food is nothing to write home about. Hey the beer is cold!
Ray B.,"Fort Worth, TX",74,234,184,2.0,1/27/2014,I really like coming here to have drinks with friends. I love pizzas so much and I wanted to see how it tastes at BJs. Pizza came out but unfortunately it was not very good. Too much cheese and not enough sauce. Crust was not very crunchy and was a little soggy. If I come back here I would not try the pizza. I just stick to the BJs brewed beer.
Machia D.,"Denton, TX",0,3,1,5.0,9/16/2015,"I go here every Wednesday night and sit at the bar, I have always had Mackinzie, she has always taking such good care of my friend and I giving us OUTSTANDING SERVICE. The food and drinks are ok the price is a little much for common drinks, but they have a good happy hour. But Mackinzie made it worth going for how well she took care of all her customers and made us feel special every time we go."
Rob C.,"Decatur, TX",0,9,,4.0,7/25/2015,"I agree with Liandrin K (4-14-15). This place should have a higher rating. I have been there 4 times in the last 4 months and have been satisfied every time. The atmosphere is between sports bar and restaurant - nice furniture and appointments, not too noisy, but still energetic. The wait staff has been attentive and pleasant. The serving times have been quick. The drinks are well made (name brands are pricey) and if you are not satisfied, they replace them. We have had all the ""lighter"" dinner entrees and a couple of appetizers, including the calimari. They were all at the right temperature and tasty. I don't care for any of the deserts as I like more traditional choices, but the vanilla bean ice cream is great. We have nixed Houlihan's and Mi Cocina and made this our go-to place in Heritage Trace."
Taylor S.,"Haslet, TX",1,8,,5.0,6/13/2014,"I love their pizza. I've gotten pizza every time I go. The meat lovers is my favorite. I don't usually like thick crust but this crust is crunchy and well seasoned. There definitely isn't a shortage of meat, either. I've also gotten the Caesar salad, which is amazing. I've never felt service was bad."
Robert M.,"Keller, TX",2,11,1,2.0,4/13/2014,"We have been to this location 3 times and it just keeps getting worse.  Our most recent was this past Friday afternoon.  We came in and waited 5 minutes at the front for any of the employees in the relatively empty restaurant to even acknowledge us. Once seated we asked about any happy hour specials and were informed that they only applied to the guests sitting in the bar.  We decided to stay where we were and ordered a couple of their specialty Margaritas they were not prced on the menu,  but i was shocked to see on my bill that they were 9.25 for a beverage served in a small rocks glass. It was tasty,  but not worth that price. Overall the food was good,  but I can get better service and better value elsewhere. Probably will not return."
Liam I.,"Keller, TX",2,8,,3.0,5/14/2014,"I went to this place once and had a pretty good experience.  Food was good, a little pricey but the food was good enough that I didn't feel too ripped off on it.  Service for the location was also good.  I would go again"
R J.,"Fort Worth, TX",19,716,190,4.0,1/27/2014,"Fun establishment, the 5-ounce taster beer sampling is one of the better brew buys here, and the lighter four were all fine with me!  The salads are adequate, entrees a bit institutional-tasting, but good, overall.  Waiter was slow, seems a little inadequately prepared for any questions ""outside the box"", like whether there was a corn product in the coatings on some of the entrees...would go again!"
Raean M.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,7,1,5.0,4/19/2014,Love BJ's pizza.  We usually get the deep dish but tried the hand tossed tonight and had no complaints.  BJ's favorite is my favorite!
Robin B.,"Deanville, TX",2,4,1,2.0,4/7/2014,"It's hard being gluten-free and and sticking to salads when eating out, especially when the salads are so uninspired.  I usually have good luck at BJ's, but today I got the BJ's Cobb which was anemic, not so fresh, finely chopped iceberg lettuce with very little meat also very finely diced. It was not crisp and without much texture or taste."
Alina L.,"Fort Worth, TX",340,74,117,2.0,12/13/2011,"Good food but not worth the price at all! The restaurant is beautiful inside and the menu is very extensive. They have something for everyone and quite a few different appetizers. The bar area is large and I like that they have a huge beer selection. However, they are so expensive. This place is like a Cheesecake Factory experiment with pizza and beer. The servers are wearing black button up shirts and the restaurant is nice but the guests are all casual and there are a ton of kids so the place is loud. It wouldnt be a great place to have a date night and the prices are to expensive to want to bring your whole family to. I do like that they close at 1am so its a good place for a late night snack to share (again because of the prices) and a good selection of beers."
Emilie A.,"Krum, TX",115,21,6,4.0,12/29/2013,"I have always loved BJ's, but service is a huge factor in giving a restaurant four stars. Our server was just plain weird. I was a server for many years and understand how restaurants work. Servers MUST be personable, if you're not maybe you should find another job. I will defiantly be back, but hope the service is better."
Josh L.,"Keller, TX",15,40,,3.0,1/31/2015,"Got the seafood chowder breadbowl and some pizookies. Food was pretty good, but the service was really really really slow.."
Rene F.,"Denton, TX",0,37,2,1.0,2/17/2013,Bad service at the location.  I suggest that you visit another location because you will be disappointed with their level of customer service.  I waited 15 minutes for someone to take just my drink order and when I complained to the manager he did not seem to care.
