John A.,"Keller, TX",0,14,4,4.0,1/20/2014,"Service excellent!  The Parmesan crusted chicken is good. Loved the appetizer combo. It is really tasty, perfectly cooked and a meal in itself.   The baby back ribs were so-so. The baked potato arrived tepid"
Eric J.,"Pearland, TX",26,84,27,4.0,9/9/2012,"I really like this place. The best part is it's so close to the house. Coincidentally it's also the worst part, it's so close. It's not cheap, but the food is really good. I'd be remiss if I didn't also mention the micro brews are tasty as well. It's a good low key date night or if you just want to get out of the house for a bit."
J B.,"Roanoke, TX",0,45,3,3.0,3/6/2012,"Food was good. If you have a child in a stroller or a handicap person, this may not be a place for you. Very little room to get thru . No clear paths. Would like to go back but they need to make it more functional to get arround to seating easier."
Steve M.,"Keller, TX",39,218,36,3.0,9/23/2012,"Tried the lunch half basil sausage pizza and salad. The pizza was actually really good flavor, though I got the smaller portion. The salad is a misnomer as it is just some miscellaneous small lettuce and stuff. I still enjoyed the food as an option for watching calories but the service was pretty slow. Had to constantly flag waitperson over lunch time. I really like BJs food and bar but they need to improve service."
Roxanne M.,"Fort Worth, TX",3,47,6,1.0,6/21/2012,"Never again will I come here!!!!! Worst customer service I have ever recieved! I came to this place early February. It was my frist time at this location. I convinced my bf to come here and try their veggie burgers (which are good by the way). BUT our waiter was very RUDE to us just because we told him to take the margaritas off our tab . We had to tell him that because the margaritas tasted like crap! It was water and alcohol from my opinion. My bf was polite when he told him about our complain. After that, our waiter acted like a douche bag. He wouldn't come back to refill our drinks and my bf asked him for ketchup and he never brought it to us. My bf had literally got the ketchup bottle from the table that was across from us.  Just horrible! Yeah, I def won't come back to this location!"
Jenn N.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,4,,5.0,12/14/2014,"Great food, great service, gluten free options, great atmosphere!  Our family favorite restaurant!"
Jennefer B.,"Fort Worth, TX",34,10,2,1.0,8/14/2013,Worst service we have had in a long time.  Took forever to get our food and when we did it was cold as could be second time we have has bad service here in the last month needless to say we will NOT be going back.  I left a 3$ tip for the worst server ever.  Ugh
Steve L.,"Austin, TX",53,192,,4.0,4/15/2013,"Stopped on the way to the race.  Service wasn't great and it wasn't that busy, but everything else about it was pretty cool.  Food was good.  3.5 stars, more of a 4 than a 3."
Tuana Y.,"Fort Worth, TX",6,28,1,1.0,3/31/2012,"Hate this place. Have gone several times, each time hoping that the previous experience was just a bad night or something, but every time leave feeling very disappointed and upset for spending the money. I took my son here one afternoon while he was home from school at about 1:30 pm, after the lunch rush, there were about 7 other tables in the restaurant occupied. I ordered a simple appetizer salad, he a kids meal with corn dog minis and fries. We could never find our waitress, and it took over 30 minutes for the meal to be delivered. At most of our meal without drinks as refills never came. The food here is over prices for the quality!  Restaurant needs serious help on training and educating the staff on the menu and how to treat customers. I can understand a bit of a wait during a rush, but there were about 10 waiters and waitresses that I could see, however, we experienced the issues mentioned above.  Seriously, there are so many other places in the area to try if you want a nice casual meal out. Forget this place all together. Wish they'd replace it with something else."
Diane T.,"Denver, CO",44,583,3,2.0,3/19/2012,"I had lunch here with a friend a few weeks ago.  I'm not big on chain restaurants and tend to go for different types of ethnic foods instead when I go out for lunch, but since not everyone likes what I like I'll do 'the chains' on occasion. I'd never been in a BJ's before and I was impressed by the upscale look and feel.  The menu had lots of options - the 'something for everyone' type of menu - so I can see how this place would be a good choice for groups (or in my case, going to lunch with someone who doesn't generally frequent the mom&pop ethnic places). I ordered a salad that sounded good.  I wish their online menu included the name of the dish, but it only shows the description: ""A colorful blend of crisp romaine lettuce, red onions and fire-roasted red peppers tossed with our Santa Fe dressing. Topped with jack and cheddar cheeses, sliced avocado, corn, diced tomatoes, crisp tortilla strips and blackened chicken breast"".  Maybe it was a Sante Fe salad, or something like that.  Regardless, I was disappointed.  For $12 I was expecting something a bit more substantial.  To begin with, my chicken wasn't blackened but just grilled.  It tasted fine, but blackened was what I was expecting and what would have made the dish better (I would have sent it back if I hadn't been there with someone).  Also, the amount of salad greens was somewhat skimpy which made for a rather small salad overall since all of the other ingredients seem to have been added in proportion to the amount of greens.  Anyway, I was not impressed with the salad.  On a positive note, the iced tea was good. I wasn't impressed with our server either.  I don't think she could have acted any more bored if she had tried.  I tip well when I get good service (and not necessarily just based on the price of the meal); she got the bare minimum. Despite all that, I had a nice visit with my friend.  Next time, I'll suggest some place else, though."
Dale A.,"Dallas, TX",9,22,2,2.0,1/11/2013,"First of all it's taking me 5 minutes to write this review because 3G service out here is horrible  and they don't have wifi in this restaurant. Seriously !!!!   What kind of bar place.does not have Wifi, its 2013.   Food was very average, but service was great.    Pizza was like. Mr gattis and boneless wings like the frozen ones from the store.    More of a bar than a nice restaurant    Still can't believe they don't have wifi.     Great service strong drinks.  Retarded management for not having  WIFI."
Le E.,"Fort Worth, TX",124,356,42,3.0,1/20/2012,i really really really like the honey mustard chicken salad. i like how the lettuce is diced really small. i hate giant wedge salads. you can't eat that with just a fork!!!
Lauren J.,"Leesburg, VA",1,31,28,5.0,10/27/2012,"I have been going to Bj's for 3 years now in 5 different locations in Texas. Houston and the Dallas/Fort Worth area. I have NEVER ONCE HAD A BAD EXPERIENCE.  Every single entre is amazing, staff is always great and in general it is by far the best place to eat. There menu is about 8 pages long at least with so many foods and drinks. I'm moving back to the east coast and i can easily say this place is the only reason i'm sad to leave here. My boyfriend and I try to go once a week if possible!"
Blythe W.,"Keller, TX",0,19,,4.0,9/1/2014,Been here a few times. Great beer selection. Some pretty good food. Pizzas are great. Service is lacking many times through.
Brennan J.,"Dallas, TX",543,11,10,4.0,1/28/2013,"I been there about 15 times with colleagues at lunch. Food is always good (because I ask the servers what they like :).  The Parmesan crusted chicken is great. I substitute the sides for white cheddar cheese mashed potatoes and rice pilaf. The servers are always really nice. Nice large atmosphere. Good placement of TV's. Friendly hostesses. I've never been there at night though, so this is a lunch time review."
Heather B.,"Oklahoma City, OK",124,200,33,4.0,5/24/2012,I second the reviewer who said that  the Parm. Crusted Chicken with mashed potatoes is amazing!!! It is. I love that the house made sodas are corn syrup free. I have always had great service and the kids love the pizza.
Tammy A.,"Denton, TX",4,51,16,4.0,8/3/2012,"I can't believe all the poor ratings, we come here almost Sunday after church.  We've never had bad meal... Nor have we ever had bad service.  We love the ahi tuna salad as well as the ahi / wanton appetizer.  Never ordered anything we didn't like."
Tony H.,"Austin, TX",81,269,53,3.0,5/4/2012,"I'm a BJ's fan.  I had what I had at a different BJs before.  My food here seemed a little under seasoned, or lacking flavor might be a better word, but it was still really good.  The desserts were amazing as well!"
Stephen P.,"Keller, TX",53,25,,4.0,9/29/2011,We eat at BJs about once a month or twice.  We love the Pizza and Parmesan Crusted Chicken.
Gunther H.,"Fort Worth, TX",9,6,9,5.0,10/3/2012,"The best food, micro brews and service in the Alliance Corridor."
