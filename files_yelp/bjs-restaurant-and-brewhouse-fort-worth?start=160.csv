Dia N.,"Lake Dallas, TX",62,115,28,3.0,8/28/2011,"We only had dessert so I can't comment on the food.  The service was good and we were happy with the desserts.  I should have stuck to basics and stayed with a traditional pizooki.  I tried the new red velvet and it was WAY sweet.  I love a good red velvet cupcake with cream cheese frosting, so I was hopeful.... it was just MEH.... next time I will go back to basics with the chocolate chip."
E'stormae S.,"Hawthorne, CA",90,228,34,4.0,9/29/2011,"This place is always packed. Good food.  I've had more things than I care to remember and nothing has been bad.  Pizza is really fantastice for the DFW area.  soups and salads all good.  Although kinda pricy, their fish & chips are fantastic!! You can definately taste the beer in the batter.  Its what I normally get when I go there.  I would recommend a baked potatoe.  Bring a friend.. they're huge and you'll need help finishing it.  Service is always impeccable here.  There was one time we ordered something and it had not arrived 15 min later (while the other appetizer had)  We asked and found out that somebody messed up.  They brought it to us quickly and did not charge!! How many places do that anymore??? None I say!! They're all gimme! gimme!! gimme!!! And then smile while bringing your check so you'll tip them.  This is one of the few places where my dad ponies up the money to tip. Oh its kinda like a posh sports bar in here.  Kinda loud, but you can carry on a conversation."
Andre M.,"Fort Worth, TX",5,28,3,4.0,2/25/2011,Food is pretty good here. Every time I've been though its always crowded and it's usually a 30-45 minute wait. Service is not that speedy but we usually go on a Friday night which is probably their busiest day. Food is grrrrreeeaaatttt! Little pricey though but its like any other restaurant.
Hollie B.,"Fort Worth, TX",3,52,5,5.0,7/17/2011,I love this place! The atmosphere is really nice always pleasant servers a very wide range of food choices their menu is like a book! The food is amazing you cannot go wrong here all the salads are amazing their honey mustard dressing is to die for and I love that the salad is chopped up really fine so you don't feel like your always eating the core! Nice area as well a few shops to go to! Good place for a date!
Mario S.,"Fort Worth, TX",16,7,,4.0,7/25/2011,BJs has great food and beer.  I come here quite often.
Jenn K.,"Coppell, TX",3,47,193,5.0,7/21/2011,"BJ's is one of my all-time favorite restaurants. They have SO much to choose from and I have yet to try anything I disliked. The Buffalo Chicken Pizza is awesome. And of course, you CAN'T have a complete BJ's experience without ordering a Pizookie for dessert. They are amazing!"
Heather V.,"Keller, TX",110,73,12,4.0,12/29/2010,"OK OK OK OK .... I had a bad experience the last time i went but the food was actually really good. So we had to go back, and I am glad i did. It seems like management has really taken control of the waitstaff and they seem to be more on top of their customer service."
Will Z.,"Keller, TX",0,11,,2.0,4/25/2011,"Service isn't that great....very over priced. Normally I'd spend $50 or 60 for a family of 5.....here my bill was $92.  (and that was with 2 kids menu items).  Food is very tasty, just not worth the price IMO."
Scott Y.,"Keller, TX",1,4,2,4.0,7/29/2011,"I have been to BJ's quite a few times, but this is my first review.  They are mainly known for their in-house beer brewery, having about 15 or so selections to choose from.  However, my drink of choice is definitely their root beer. Although a little pricey for a soda, it is the best root beer I have ever tasted.  It is brewed in-house and served ice-cold on tap... with free refills. The restaurant has a very nice and clean ambience to it.  With a few HD TV's scattered throughout the place and nice low (but not too low) lighting it makes for a nice, cozy experience.  Onto the food.  Their menu is pretty large (think cheesecake factory), but the only reason we ever go is for the pizza.  But first, we often get an order of their wings.  The wings are very nice and crispy, and the sauce is always served on the side.  I'm not really sure why they do it that way, but it makes no difference to me.  The wings are a little above average, but not really worth the $9 price tag.  The pizza is ""deep dish"" pizza, but if you're looking for authentic Chicago deep dish, you might be disappointed.  Don't get me wrong, BJ's makes a great pizza!  It's served in a deep pan, with loads of tomatoes on top.  I'm not too fond of how they top every pizza with tomatoes, but they come off pretty easily.  They have a few different ""exotic"" type pizzas like the Mediterranean, and the Southwest, but I'm always up for BJ's Favorite or Classic Combo.  Their pizza is a very nice tribute to Deep Dish, and definitely the closest to ""Midwest-Style"" pizza I've had down here in Texas. Our server was very attentive and had a great, friendly attitude and smile.  We never had an empty glass, and the food came out quickly, but not too fast. Overall, a very nice place with great food and atmosphere.  A great place for a semi-casual date.  I would have given it 5 stars, but for the type of food it is, it was just a little too pricey. However, that won't keep me from returning to BJ's for more pizza, wings and root beer."
Patricia H.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,56,,1.0,10/13/2012,I got take out a couple of times and the food was really good.  Then I took my family to eat in...what a mistake.  The service was the slowest and my food was awful.  I live in the Alliance area and we are getting a Houlahan's!!!  thank god.
Tami F.,"Burleson, TX",26,11,,2.0,7/31/2010,"I have been to several of the BJ's locations and I have never had a good experience here. The service has always been bad, it takes FOREVER, the food never comes out correctly and there is always some weird smell near the entrance. The management tries to make it good, if you bother to bring it to their attention, but there comes a point where you just stop going in and go to the Cheddar's down the street. They have a good menu and I have had good experiences elsewhere. I suppose I go back in the hopes this place will get it right. At any rate, if they can get their act together with the service and the incredible amount of time it takes to get your food, it would make the experience 1000x better."
Trey S.,"Keller, TX",0,5,1,5.0,1/11/2012,LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. I always get the Parm. Crusted Chicken with mashed potato's and it is amazing.  The people are always so nice and friendly and very accommodating. Probably one of my favorite restaurants.
