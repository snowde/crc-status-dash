Richard B.,"Alvord, TX",0,39,1,4.0,6/2/2017,Ok. Not too bad. Very busy on a Friday at a late lunch. Service was swift and friendly but took a long time to get our food. Bartend is a super friendly guy. Soup was not hot and short but ayce soup and salad so just sent for more. Beignet is excellent so order one for your lady.
Angie A.,"Keller, TX",0,9,1,5.0,7/5/2016,BJs was a great experience. Food was good.  Excellent customer service by Breeza A. Ask for her if you want great service and attention to details.
David V.,"Keller, TX",113,347,861,1.0,10/17/2014,"We came here for a late dinner around 10:30ish since they close at 1. The dining room looked closed, so we sat at one of the booths off the bar.  First off, no one greeted us at the door, we waited 5 mins before we seated ourselves in the booth at the bar. 5 mins doesn't seem long, but when you're standing there waiting and watching employees pass by, we wanted to walk out.  At the table, another 8 mins goes by before someone brings us menus and takes drink orders. Had a bad feeling the moment we walked in. But figured we were the late customers, so would just cut them some slack.  Bad experience overall, our appetizer didn't come with plates.  The food was okay itself. Kind of like a higher end Chilis. Just wouldn't come here again, atleast not for dinner or late night. It's a new BJs so maybe they're still learning or training."
Drew B.,"Keller, TX",6,63,14,4.0,1/11/2016,"We come to BJ's a lot.  Tonight was a family affair.  Normally the food is excellent, tonight it was so-so.  The reason it is 4 stars and not 5 was the food, what kept it a 4 and didn't lower it to a 3 was our waiter tonight.  Rick H knew his stuff and was all about customer service!  He took our drink orders, appetizers and food orders all without the need to write it all down and he got it all right.  Very attentive without hovering or being irritating.  In any case, BJs is fun place to come with or without the kids.  We are regulars and will be back.  I'll just chalk the food issues up to the Monday's night blahs...  (Although the Roll Tide and Tigers were on TV playing in a bowl game) , but sports on big TVs always seems to make things better!"
Poukao S.,"Fort Worth, TX",28,111,38,4.0,2/10/2015,"They have some delicious bloody Mary's! We came for the patio on this gorgeous weather, but it's to early. Sun hasn't hit the patio yet, making it to chill to be sitting out. Love their Parmesan crusted chicken with cheddar mash potatoes."
Trey C.,"Lewisville, TX",119,10,5,5.0,3/5/2017,Great service  and excellent food! I have been to many B.J.'s and this one is fantastic. Try to get there early on Friday night because it gets packed quick!
Joshua H.,"Keller, TX",4,42,7,3.0,5/11/2016,So the food is average but it has a huge menu and lots of beers. It is a good place to go if you are with a group who struggles picking a style of food. The bar area has decent TV coverage for watching sports. They do have this great chocolate chip cookie and ice cream that comes in an iron skillet.
Anna C.,"North Richland Hills, TX",37,11,2,5.0,12/2/2016,"Love the California  flatbread  and salad. Servers and management  always nice and helpful.  Coupons  are great, and rewards program  worth having.  Love it!"
Claire D.,"Plano, TX",0,11,12,5.0,12/1/2016,What a great restaurant! Came here for dinner and our server Christian was on top of everything that we could possibly ever need! The food was excellent and it's just nice to go out to eat at an establishment where the staff seems to care with a smile. Everyone seems to love their job and it shows. Will definitely be back!
Chris G.,"Keller, TX",162,167,123,2.0,6/1/2014,Service here is not what it was when it opened.  Brought wrong sandwhich Food was delivered without a word being spoken.  Takes a long time for drink refills.  Not going back.
Maggie L.,"Keller, TX",0,9,,2.0,2/12/2017,"Food was alright, we wanted to try something new and ended up wishing we would have stuck to plain old chili's instead! The service was good, we just probably didn't order the right thing, very bland food."
Jason L.,"Fort Worth, TX",2,11,23,5.0,11/22/2015,"The food and service is excellent, and the food is consistent that's why I always come back the atmosphere is light and roomy I would definitely recommend the jalapeño burger it's great."
Jay S.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,2,8,2.0,3/16/2016,"Dry Chicago style pizza, no sauce and very little toppings. Fellow coworkers also complained about their food being dry, even shorted on chicken wings one day."
Lindsay B.,"Destin, FL",57,465,608,5.0,9/9/2014,"I met a friend here for lunch earlier today and was really pleased with the food and experience. I had a soup/salad combo off of their lunch menu: the baby greens and pear salad and the tomato bisque soup. The soup was delicious. Nice chunks of tomato in a delicious soup. The salad was also very good. The dressing was a bit....off to me but it was still a good salad. We started with chips and salsa which was really good, too. Not spicy but not bland and drab.  Our server was so nice. She was attentive and patient with us. We took a long time before ordering because we were visiting. Our server made sure to check on us several times.  The restaurant itself is nice. I had the impression that it was more bar like, but it's actually pretty nice."
Susan P.,"Allen, TX",118,159,139,2.0,3/10/2015,"C'mob BJ's!  I'm going to bulletpoints because well you want main points not a novel.  Pros 1. The bar menu is pretty impressive if you are into that kind of thing. 2. There is always a television to watch as they are EVERYWHERE.  3. The atmosphere is definitely an elegant sports bar type which is nice if that is what you are looking for and it has a lot of space for a crowd. Cons 1. The service is INCREDIBLY slow. We sat and waiting for WATER for twenty minutes. WATER?! What is the point of being sat immediately if you have to wait so long for a server? The food took FOREVER.  2. The food was okay. The wings were good but the pepperoni, sausage, mushroom pizza was underwhelming. We were STARVING and bought a medium and STILL left half. Not good.  3. The price is ridiculous for what you're getting. Not the biggest bang for your buck.  I've been at like 2pm where it is COMPLETELY dead and there are like three people and it is STILL this bad. I just don't get it. I'm with Chris. Maybe for some wings."
Kevin S.,"Plano, TX",28,825,2,3.0,8/6/2014,"Met up with a friend for dinner and parts delivery. Service was a bit slow @ 6 pm, before they were busy. Food was decent.  Had the black and bleu burger.  Didn't ask if wanted medium or well or what?  They did remove the tomato as I asked.  Beer was fresh. I'd be back here if I needed to meet up with a friend again, etc.  But there are better places around."
Teresa L.,"Sweetwater, OK",1,38,3,5.0,7/9/2016,"We had lunch here today and was my first time. Huge menu, great selections of appetizers, entrees, beer and cocktails. We had the fried portobello mushrooms and asparagus appetizers. Batter light, crispy, delicious. My salad was the watermelon, feta and greens--incredible, light, cool. Entree was shrimp asparagus penne--very good and more than enough. Waiter kept our drinks full and was attentive. I'll definitely eat here again!"
Lilian N.,"Fort Worth, TX",269,179,226,2.0,3/1/2015,"Came around 9pm.. Wasn't packed at all. Slow service. Waitress was nice but she could have been more attentive. Water was never re-filled. The hostess/host were being  awkward and made the first impression uncomfortable when we arrived.. They were flirting with each other, hugging up on each other, & continuous giggling while the host was talking to us about seating.. I was like seriously wtf? It was quite annoying actually. Be professional. Anyways...  Food took over 25 minutes to get. Wings were the only good dish so I didn't hate my meal entirely( garlic Parmesan & Maui sauces) Pizza was basic. Toppings tasted undercooked, Over priced..  Why the hell did I even come here to eat?! Haha #regret"
Chris U.,"Keller, TX",60,162,149,2.0,3/9/2015,"Are you in the mood for some fresh hot foot prepped to order? How about good prices and value for the great and almighty dollar. Well keep on driving. Service was slow but waiter was courteous.  The highlight of the meal was the wings on appetizer. They are crisp and have good flavor, if I come back this maybe my meal next time.  So we were optimistic.  My wife and I tried to order a pizza without sauce and to get sauce on the side (I like sauce she doesn't). This wasn't possible because ""they are pre-prepped"". Ok then we will need another minute to look at the menu again. So wife got a Parmesan chicken and it was bland. The mashed potatoes we actually good. Fries where cold, and taste like they were frozen very recently. Kids got spaghetti and they seemed ok with it. But it looked like hospital food or at best what we use to eat in school cafeteria (minus the usda grade F surplus meat, which would of been a welcomed addition). Also got the chicken strips and child said they weren't warm either. After being told pizza wasn't happening I elected to get the carnitas cheese fries.  Normally an appetizer I decided to make it my meal. Again fries were cold but the stuff on top was warm or might I say even hot. But I won't get again.   So turns out for a place that has such a giant menu (almost as ridiculous as cheese cake factory's) all their food tastes like it is fresh out of the freezer section in the frozen dinner section at your local Kroger. (No offense tended towards Kroger) Their house root beer is so so. I've had it at other locations  it was better at those locations.  This won't be a place we will frequent, we will return if friends insist but on our choice it will be a while."
Jessica C.,"Keller, TX",25,23,7,1.0,6/15/2016,WAY overrated and overpriced! Their menu descriptions sound much better than the actual food tastes! Very disappointing on multiple occasions and won't be back.
