Tee J.,"Frisco, TX",0,72,,4.0,7/1/2016,Stopped by this place on a Sunday night. The bartender that night was awesome. He can fix a mean drink. No watered down drinks on this night.  I'm not so crazy about the food at BJ's but the drinks were very good. But i've come to learn that Bartenders aren't all the same. So if you find a good Bartender get his/her work schedule!
Judy C.,"Fort Worth, TX",17,1,,1.0,2/14/2016,"We went to BJ'S for Valentine lunch, the wait wasn't bad, we get seated and the waitress took our drink order and appetizers.  We didn't get water, she came over about four times and asked if we were ready to order.  We felt like we were being rushed.  Placed our order, wasn't even done with appetizer before our meal came. Waitress came back over a few more times and asked us if we were done,  when my husband was done the waitress came over and took his plate and mine and I had a fork with food on it in my hand...how rude!  Before we could ask for another drink she brought the bill, didn't ask if we needed anything else like a drink perhaps!  Gina could have been a little more welcoming instead of trying to rush us through. I was very disappointed. ...will not be going back!"
Sandra C.,"Keller, TX",20,14,7,2.0,1/16/2016,"I used to like coming here but lately the food hasn't been tasting the same, it's lacking more flavor."
Karis H.,"North Richland Hills, TX",148,65,113,3.0,7/2/2015,The service was super slow...it took an hour for an appetizer to come out...an appetizer. All our waiter did was hover around and refill our drinks for 45 minutes. The spinach & artichoke dip was so/so. The best thing was the Pizookie.
Kim L.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,45,28,1.0,11/14/2016,"Too bad there's no zero star option.  We were celebrating two of our kids receiving an award tonight and gave BJs a second chance even though they've been not great in the past. Place was not even 20% full on a Monday at 4:30 but we still had to wait 10 min to be sat. No big deal but still. Get sat and order drinks and an appetizer. Connor, our server, never brings me my lemonade OR our appetizer. Stinks with hangry kids.  Never checks in after our waters are delivered. Brings us our food and I tell him to please make sure my drink and our appetizer aren't on the bill because we never got them. I ask for extra napkins. Never brings them. Food is only average at best. The kids meal vegetables were almost raw they were so crunchy (for what was described as steamed on menu). Decide to ask for check early in meal because who knows when he'll be back around..  gives us check and we have to ask a diff server to find Connor because it takes him so long to actually run our card. Pretty epically bad!!  The last time the mgr promised us a gift card for our troubles (never sent one!) but I'm begging now, please please don't ever send one. If you did we'd probably give it to people we don't like very much."
Jacquelyn S.,"Fort Worth, TX",24,42,19,1.0,12/12/2015,"Just waited 30 mins for a table to only get drinks. After the waitress dropped our drinks off and walked off, didn't say a word. Finally after 5mins she came back with an attitude and wouldn't even take our order. We asked to pay for our drinks and all she did was take our menu's and walked off. So we walked out."
Leanne F.,"Fort Worth, TX",53,22,,5.0,2/16/2016,Just had a huge team dinner here with 40 people and they did an awesome job!  The food and service are great and they know how to deal with a crowd of you have one.
Yvo N.,"Veitshöchheim, Germany",0,16,,2.0,5/29/2016,"This one I will not go back to. I asked to have the kids food first cause I knew I had to feed my toddler. She just ignored it and brought us a ""waiting bread"" for her. Then the food came the same time. I ordered my hamburger well done. Mine was very red inside. I couldnt eat it. So I waited and waited. By the time the new one came, my whole family was done eating. And to top it off, my drink I saved for my food - I am not a big drinker - was warm and flat. Yeah (sarcasm). I also had to ask 3 times for a to go box."
Caliope H.,"London, United Kingdom",6,125,62,4.0,12/29/2014,"This is one if those great neighborhood places that has something for everyone. Been here a couple of times with family that included ages from 5 to 75, and tastes that ran from chicken strips and lasagna to salmon or steak. Everyone always leaves happy.  That's as much because of  the food as the on-top-of- it service. (I can recommend the  salmon with the cranberry sauce, turkey burger, and did & chips) Big portions - ' nuf to share or take home some. Separately, this has a nine, large bar area w/ a wide selection of beers and a good view of whatever game you want to watch on well-situated large screen TV's which make it as good for hanging out on a Sunday afternoon. BOTTOM LINE: Large, but neighborhood- feeling like place with good food, service & amenities which equally welcomes restaurant diners of any age and people just looking for a good bar to watch the game. TIP: it's a chain (tho I don't know of any others - and they have a loyalty program if you like them."
Jennifer N.,"Anchorage, AK",50,5,1,5.0,4/14/2016,"Excellent service! Breezee was a fabulous server. Attentive without intrusion. The food was wonderful as expected! We have dined often and haven't been disappointed. Thank you for a welcoming, relaxing and delightful meal at a reasonable price!"
Marla J.,"Roanoke, TX",1,12,,4.0,4/27/2016,"I love BJ's. Their Chicken Parmesan is delicious, and so is their pulled pork sandwich. Alcoholic drinks are nice and strong. Service is usually medicore, though. Friendly staff if you are eating/drinking at the bar. Takeout is just as good as dining in. I've never had a to-go order made incorrectly. I will say that the menu is slightly overpriced though..."
Kyla A.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,7,,2.0,1/7/2016,This is my second time in a few months of eating here and the pizza seems to be Luke warm.    After I had them take it to reheat the waitress came back and it wasn't much better.  The manager came over and seemed to be a little annoyed.  He did offer to remake my pizza personally but who has that kind of time.  We just want HOT pizza.   I do appreciate the offer.   I only wanted the manager to know this has happened more than once.  #customerservice. Mgr did discount the pizza.
Cliff S.,"Fort Worth, TX",202,7,,5.0,5/1/2016,This was the first for me to dine here. It was Sunday at 12:20 and didn't wait for a seat. The sweet peach tea was just right. Had a delicious thin crust pizza. The beer menu look swell and will try it out for happy hour. Cliff
K. S.,"Justin, TX",0,5,,1.0,9/23/2016,"Slow service, cold chicken on my salad when I asked for it to be hot, didn't count my change (shorted substantially) and server tried to say it was someone else's fault. Since when do I pay cash and you don't give me back my coins? You just assume I am going to give it to you? Poor, poor, poor. Another one bites the dust on my list."
Misty D.,"Argyle, TX",38,273,186,5.0,12/6/2014,We love BJ's.  This location has always been very consistent and positive.  The only problem with this location is the parking.. you have to park a mile away and walk... They're always busy.  BJs rewards program is worth it
Vic H.,"Keller, TX",57,33,21,2.0,8/24/2014,"Bad service.  Overpriced food.  I've never had good service at BJs and I've been there at least a half dozen times.  This time was no exception.  We were seated promptly and that is one of two  good things I have to say about this place. The other good thing is, we were there to celebrate a birthday and the birthday person gets a free Pizookie dessert. They don't check if it's your birthday.  They just bring you a complimentary personal sized Pizookie.    Here's my latest experience at BJs.  I was in party of 3. It was a Saturday night at 6:30pm, it was busy. The waitress took our order, we all ordered a salad with our entree.  The waitress asked if we wanted our salad before our entree, we all said yes. I ordered the soup and salad and chose the chili and Caesars salad.  I was told the chili had sour cream, cheese and green onions in it.  I said it sounded great and our waitress walked away.  One of my friends ordered the same thing as I did and another ordered the tomato and mozzarella salad and for her entree she ordered the scallops.   25 minutes later a single bowl of chili was brought to our table by a runner.  25 minutes is no exaggeration on the wait.  I mean, how long does it take to get salad?  We explained to the runner we never received our salad.  She asked us if we still wanted the bowl of chili and we said no, we would like the salads first.  The runner then said, ""Oh,  I can go throw this away.""  Do you want to speak to a manager? My friends said yes.   As she walked away, we saw her talking to our server.  I'm not sure exactly what transpired but the server had an ""Oh darn, I forgot to put in their salad order,"" sort of look. The server approached our table and apologized and promised to have our salads out immediately, which did happen.   The salads were ok.  My Caesar salad was swimming in dressing.  About 15 minutes after the salads our entrees came out and still we had not seen a manager.  The chili I ordered, had about a quarter sized amount of cheese (wish I'd taken a pic) and 3 pieces of green onion.  The food was far from impressive, especially for the price paid.  Soup and salad was roughly $9.00 for dinner. I could've bought a bag of salad mix, 5 cans of Hormel chili and a bottle of Caesar's salad for $9 and would've had lunch for a week and the taste would've been about the same.    The manager that night eventually made his way to our table and was very apologetic and made sure we had everything we needed.  We finished the rest of the meal.  Our check came and our server gave one of the most insincere apologies, hip thrown out - not looking at us, I've ever received."
Shahed K.,"Lewisville, TX",46,76,1679,5.0,7/22/2014,"I have been to this location only once so my review may not be accurate. However, I was very impressed with what I saw. It was very spacious and clean, but was almost at full capacity. So obviously, people like this place. The servers were very friendly and well informed. They were very willing to answer our questions and were nice about it. As for the food, we ordered the Moroccan Spiced Salmon and the Scallops for lunch. The Salmon was a bit dry, but was very tasty. The vegetables and the couscous that came with it were delicious too. The Salmon was just perfect. I didn't eat much of the brown rice that came with it, but it tasted very flavorful too. The asparagus that came with the scallops was cooked to perfection. It was tender on the inside, but crunchy on the outside. The best part of the meal for me was the dessert. We got the Salted Caramel Pizookie, which was to die for. It was really really tasty. All in all, I think this place deserves a five star. And oh, usually they don't take orders over the phone, but they have an app you can download for your phone, and you can use that to place your orders ahead of time. I think you even get some discounts for using that app."
deborah m.,"Milton, FL",0,28,,2.0,10/3/2015,"Typical chain restaurant, hamburgers are okay not to be compared to Five Guys if you like hamburgers.  Their salmon is not bad however my husband hates fish and every time we went I would get the salmon and he would try something new, after 3 attempts he hated everything he ordered."
Katy S.,"Haslet, TX",90,42,28,5.0,1/3/2015,"Great place to meet everyone's taste. We frequent this location because it has something for everyone. My kids request pizza every chance they get so I'm a little burned out. We can come here they can get a pizza (happy kids makes a happy meal) and we can get ""real"" food.  I tend to try something new almost every time we go because the menu is HUGE!  Everything has been great thus far. They also have a great drink menu with lots of choices.  We have also signed up for their free membership were you can earn points for free appetizers or desserts."
Carrie H.,"Dallas, TX",22,2,,4.0,2/13/2016,Great lunch with the family!  Good food and great service. Deep dish buffalo chicken pizza is awesome! And kids love the pizookie.  A bit expensive but we did enjoy it and will be back:)
