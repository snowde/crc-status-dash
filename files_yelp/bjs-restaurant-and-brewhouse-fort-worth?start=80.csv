Laura E.,"Boyd, TX",9,6,2,4.0,12/4/2015,"Went back today after saying ""we never go back because of their service"". We walked out the last time after waiting 30 minutes and no one ever came to our table. Today the server was great and the food was good. I've had better food but when the service is good it can be a fun place. We will go back back but not that often."
John B.,"Carthage, MO",33,152,148,3.0,11/4/2014,1/2 price wine on tuesday. 15.95 for teriyaki salmon. Pin bones in salmon. I've had much better.
Miranda B.,"Fort Worth, TX",24,7,5,1.0,7/16/2015,Service was HORRIBLE!!!! If I could give ZERO STARS I would!!! My husband and I were out for a RARE date night and were sat rather quickly but then that's where the issue started. We sat there for 29 minutes and consistently ignored and I finally asked a waitress why people were being serviced before us who came in after. She then replied sorry but you aren't my section. She serviced the table in front of us and behind us!! We were never even greeted by a waiter once sat until I finally said something!!! We walked out!!! after talking to the manager he offered to try and fix things but service was way to poor to even try again... All I wanted was a decent date night with my husband!!!! And maybe a pizzoookie!! Poor service!!!
Alesia W.,"Albuquerque, NM",69,3,,1.0,4/20/2016,"We ordered an appetizer and 2 drinks. We had our drinks in somewhat of a timely manner, but it took 30 minutes for the appetizer to come out, and it was cold! After waiting another 10 minutes for our waiter, Charles K, to come back around we sent the appetizer back. It then took another 15-20 minutes for another appetizer to come out with the manager, all the while Charles never came back to let us know what was going on or anything. All in all, we were there a bit more than an hour,  saw our waiter three times, never got asked for our dinner order, and waited forever for 4 sliders and fries. Dk if it was just us or what but other tables seemed to get their orders in a timely manner. DEFINITELY was not going to pay for this appetizer that took a total of 45 minutes to come out. We conversed more with the manager than our waiter! My advice to you is if you do go to this particular location,  do not get this waiter. Completely unacceptable."
Kayla G.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,12,4,2.0,4/9/2016,"Most of the time the food is great!! However, a lot of the times orders are wrong, food is cold and the services has always been HORRIBLE. The servers are among the worst I've had, I've only encountered a couple servers that were decent. I only come if I have a 2 hour window to spend here... But sometimes the food is worth it. We used to go a few times a month, but haven't gone in about 2 months now."
Ryan L.,"North Richland Hills, TX",327,171,27,4.0,4/17/2013,"I have been to this location countless times already.  At all different times of the day/night and on just about every day of the week.  It can get busy, as expected, so expect a little wait to get a table if it during a rush hour.   Besides that, I am a fan of everything. I love the beer selections.  I love the pizzas, include the awesome flat-bread pizzas.  The have a decent selection of healthy entrees as well.  Definitely try the mahi mahi off the enlightened menu! I will definitely continue to return.."
Stephanie F.,"Fort Worth, TX",1,26,18,2.0,5/25/2015,"Came to eat here a few days ago with high hopes. Sadly it was not all that great. The waitress was nice, but she was not very attentive. Waters weren't refilled once and we were there for a while. The food was alright. My husbands steak went from being way under cooked to over cooked and it lacked good flavor. The desert was doughy. It was a sad experience. I don't know that we would return, it was a bit pricey, too. It may have been worth it had the food/service  been better."
Lauren B.,"Fort Worth, TX",1,1,,2.0,6/10/2015,"Me and my husband love their food here but we came on his 21st birthday and it took them 25 min. to greet us and 2 servers were arguing over who was going to take us because they wanted to be cut we assume. When the girl decided to greet us she came up and just asked for our drinks and then said ""will Yall be eating too"" as if she was annoyed she had to wait on us. We decided to leave because they would not take my husbands ID because it was broken in half and taped together which is no big deal but it was his birthday and wanted to be able to drink so we left. when we walked outside we gathered with our party of 7 to talk about where to go. No longer than 4 min later the rude server that greeted us walked outside to leave. To get to the point if you want bad service but good food go here. It ALWAYS takes the wait staff 15-20 to greet your table every time!"
Liandrin K.,"Fort Worth, TX",1,23,8,5.0,4/14/2015,"I absolutely cannot understand why this has low reviews. I have been here plenty of times because this is one of my mom's favorite restaurants. It's also one of the few places that my entire family can agree to go to, considering we all have different tastes in food. I personally prefer the chicken strips or the Margherita flatbread. Oh my how I can wax on about the margarita flatbread... It's tasty, succulent, garlicky, amazing. My mom and stepdad personally love the burgers. Mm mm good. If I, my mom, my stepdad, my sister and her boyfriend all wish to gather together? Well, we all end up choosing BJ's because there's something for everyone to choose from. Not to say that BJ's is not without fault, but it is incredibly accommodating and the easiest place to choose from for a giant family night out. I personally love it."
Jen F.,"Washington, DC",1,5,,5.0,6/25/2016,"We had the best experience at BJ's this past Wednesday! It was our first time at this restaurant and the food and service was excellent. We enjoyed the stuffed mushrooms for an appetizer, and we also had French dips and clam chowder in a bread bowl and a salad. Our server Joe was really nice and recommended different items to try. We loved the handcrafted soda as well-both the root beer and black cherry cola. The mojito was also delicious. When the manager, Eddie came by to check on us and found that it was our first time visiting, and that one of us was celebrating a birthday, he took our appetizer and sodas off the bill! The birthday girl also enjoyed a free pazooki which was delicious. Eddie was so nice and personable and also took pictures of us. Lastly, he gave us all cards for a future visit that entitle us to a free appetizer with a purchase of an entree. We couldn't be more pleased with the wonderful service and delicious food!! Thank you Eddie and Joe!"
Elyssa M.,"Keller, TX",2,2,,1.0,5/10/2015,"I called to place a To Go order and after waiting on hold for a disappointing amount of time I got Skylar. When I asked for the Fettuccine Alfredo she told me that they no longer carried fettuccine noodles. After a confusing and bizarre conversation that I lost the ability to follow I said nevermind just give me the Maui glazed pork chop instead. And then lo and behold when she reads my order back to me they miraculously have fettuccine again and the pork chop is no where on the order. I felt like she was steamrollering over me the entire conversation, she was very rude and didn't seem to actually listen to anything that came out of my mouth. Very disappointing customer service."
Christopher H.,"Keller, TX",37,31,21,1.0,1/20/2012,"As descried on menu: MAUI GLAZED PORK CHOP One center cut pork chop, lightly seasoned and glazed in a sweet and tangy sauce, grilled and served with oven roasted red potatoes, steamed green beans and topped with grilled sweet red onions. 11.25 What I got: Dry bland pork chops. They forgot the glaze. Potatoes tasted old and moldy, beans not seasoned at all. I spent over $70.00 to take family to dinner.  A great disappointment on this dinner. I have had BJ's in the past and it was always good. This time was a big miss and I left with a pit in my stomach and large hole in my wallet."
Gary P.,"El Pueblito, Mexico",12,426,34,2.0,8/8/2014,Parking ok. Reception warm & friendly Late 9:30 PM quick bite.  Large menu. 60% capacity. Noise level ok. VG for a Friday night. Rangers on TVs Pepperoni Extreme Flatbread nice. Flavor served luke warm Sandwich Roast beef dip w/ crispy fries excellent flavor recommended also not hot Service slow initial drinks routine. Food delivery delay excessive. Service not attentive  occupancy declining. commitment to excellence was not evident Observation slow delivery = cold food. If it feels late. Inquire. It's your order.
Erum G.,"Southlake, TX",0,17,,1.0,3/16/2015,"For the prices they charge for their food, you would think they would have polite service and efficient staff. Every time I have ordered to-go from this location, they have NOT made it right...and every one of those times, I have ordered over phone, for myself, and/or with a group of co-workers. So, today I decided to order online so they can SEE in writing special instructions. I asked for blue cheese instead of cheddar/jack, and when I picked up, what did I see? Cheddar and jack. Another thing was that this Santa Fe salad specifies 'blackened chicken'. It's just grilled. When I asked the lady at the to-go area, who was ringing me up about both issues, she answers 'well, I am not the cook...so.' WOW! Stunned and very upset once again. I really want my $14 back for the salad today - and all the other times they've not cared to make it right the first time."
Popo O.,"Argyle, TX",100,65,10,4.0,6/9/2015,The drinks here are great! I love crafted beer so if your looking for IPAs or some variety of selection of beer. This place has it. It goes great with there pizza. It does get busy  so waits about 30mins. Usually the bars have some seats open.
D S.,"Fort Worth, TX",1,72,26,4.0,7/14/2015,"Huge menu, nothing bad on it.  Service is generally good.  If you have a crowd with varied tastes then this is your place.  Soup and salad lunch is great."
Brian S.,"Fort Worth, TX",28,63,9,4.0,10/14/2014,"Keep going back! Great beer and good food. Bar area is terrific.  I think the best food items are the pasta dishes and the pizza. Burgers and sandwiches good also.Have usually have had very attentive service. Its a busy place on a fri or sat night.  Call ahead and be patient. Edit...2016...dropping to 4 stars. The menu has changed and the food is still good but nothing worth an excellent status. Perhaps too many chains around in dunno. They took out my favorite dish, shrimp scampi which they upped the price but still bought it. The new pasta dishes they put in and the others removed also baffles me."
Debbie A.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,9,,3.0,9/30/2015,"we used to go here alot, but lately we have seen a difference in service and food. Service is slow and food seems smaller and not fresh or even hot. It seems to be going downhill."
Tracy C.,"Haslet, TX",1,27,5,3.0,1/4/2014,"Certain people in my family love this place, so I've been here many times. The atmosphere is great- sort of upscale sports bar. The service is inconsistent. Have had excellent servers and ones that completely forget about you. I don't like the Alfredo sauce; it tastes like gravy to me. I do like the lettuce wraps and the ahi appetizer. Spinach dip is good. They have a good blue cheese burger, too. Salads are hit or miss. Pizzas are okay.  Probably an excellent place to chat with friends, have drinks and an appetizer. But not so great for a meal."
Brian A.,"Justin, TX",65,141,26,3.0,4/20/2015,"Pretty good food, friendly staff. Menu is a bit too much. Reduce the number of items and excel at the remaining items good"
