Johnson T.,"Baltimore, MD",87,41,17,4.0,12/30/2017,"Great place to meet your friends, tinder date, or possibly, your future hubby. The atmosphere is great, you can easily ghost away from your horrible date or sit back and slam some beers back with your bffs during game night.  I was in there for a total of about 10 minutes. I met with a couple friends who have already stuffed their faces and were ready to leave. I managed to try out their lager, which was not too appealing to my taste. Great part of my experience was the bartender. I told her the flavor was not that great and she swapped it out for their Hefeweizen. The Hefeweizen is actually pretty damn good. I would give them a try though."
Rachel S.,"Martinsburg, WV",10,21,,1.0,1/10/2018,"Some of the worst food I've had. I ordered the clam chowder and there was so much flour in it that there were chunks of it and it gelatinized after about a minute. Came out luke warm and in an absurdly shallow dish for an EIGHT DOLLAR ""bowl"". I've been to high end restaurants that charge that. Not crap places at a mall.  Then I had the Great White (?) deep dish mini. Apparently they don't get that deep dish means the toppings are deep, not that the bread is 2"" thick with a dusting of toppings. It tasted like a Dominos breadstick dipped in their garlic sauce. Exactly like that.  Horribly disappointing. Won't return."
Keisha C.,"Frederick, MD",7,50,33,5.0,12/13/2017,"I've been here twice with my best cousin whenever she comes up from PG County.  The hostesses are very friendly from the moment you walk in through the revolving doors, and they hand you menus and take you to any seat of your choice. To me, the environment of the restaurant is good. The restaurant's lighting is a bit dark, but I like it. As for the waitresses, they're very friendly and they make sure that everything is good to your liking. I usually get the half rack of ribs with the Caesar salad and fries, or I just get green beans if I don't want the fries.  I have to admit that the food is a little bit pricey, but totally worth it."
Alice G.,"Denver, CO",1274,1031,2083,3.0,11/14/2017,"Overstimulation! TVs, music, high ceiling! Fun good energy on a Friday night. We started off with a couple of drinks in the bar, and the flatbread nachos which were yummy and delicious. Probably enough for a meal.  I tried the seared Ahi salad where there were tiny little squares of tuna in a big big giant bowl of greens. I don't think there was much value or protein in this meal. Daughter had the salmon in cherry glaze and fared much better. Nice suburban dining for Friday night!"
Meagan P.,"Middletown, MD",141,136,200,5.0,9/24/2017,"BJ's not only has a massive menu and delicious food; they have fantastic service and a great happy hour as well! My favorite thing about this place is that I can order something different every single time. Seriously, their menu reminds me of the Cheesecake Factory...endless choices!  My most recent visit was on a Friday evening around 6:00. Their happy hour stretches from 3:00 to 7:00, and I was pleased to see their handcrafted beers were on special for $4. They also have select appetizers for $6 (I would recommend the spinach and artichoke dip). If you're looking for one of their craft brews, I would recommend their amber ale, the Jeremiah Red.  I ordered the Lemon Thyme Chicken for $13.50, and boy was it amazing. It was seasoned wonderfully and the rice was flavorful and delicious. Finally, you HAVE to try their Pizookie dessert. They have a variety of options, but the s'mores is my favorite. I normally don't order dessert at restaurants, but I always save room for this dish. It has a chocolatey base topped with warm peanut butter, toasted marshmallows, and a generous scoop of vanilla ice cream. It is delicious!  Finally, the service here is awesome. Our waiter, Mark, was funny, friendly, and attentive the entire time. There was a problem with my bill and he was apologetic and quick to fix it.  You can't go wrong with BJ's. I always look forward to dining here."
Brittany H.,"Germantown, MD",97,153,211,5.0,9/23/2017,"This restaurant has the biggest menu I've seen! It was so hard to decide what to get off the menu for dinner.  The tried the white peach margarita, it was very sweet but good! I got a second drink called Jerry Burst. It was a mixed beer of their red ale and their berry cider. It was lightly sweet and very easy to drink.  We made it for happy hour and tried one of their apps off the that menu. The spinach artichoke dip we ordered was so delicious. Very creamy and had a great consistency.  For dinner I chose the Southern Comfort sandwich. It was massive, I took a half of it home for lunch. The chicken was perfectly fried, with ham, cheese, and an awesome Alfredo sauce. It comes with fries that I also really liked.  For dessert we tried the s'mores pizookie. Trust me, you need a few people to finish this thing. It is HUGE. (See a theme here? You get a ton of food!) it has toasted marshmallows, peanut butter, and chocolate on the bottom with ice cream. It is one of the best desserts I've had recently!"
Kay S.,"Frederick, MD",4,39,52,4.0,11/4/2017,"UPDATE: (delayed) company sent me a gift card to visit again. Honestly, I wasn't going to. I can't take my family to a restaurant that doesn't have kid friendly silverware. But, kids wanted to try it again! SO GLAD WE DID! Had a much better experience. Pizza was crispy and toppings weren't greasy. I had Peruvian Shrimp Quinoa and it was SO FRESH AND FLAVORFUL! Hubs had tacos, which packed a good flavor punch! Didn't try the pizookie but we WILL go back. I still recommend all you parents out there have that plastic silverware on hand! Staff waa super as well!  My bison burger bun was soggy and disgusting. Our Pizookie came out WAY over cooked (solid chunk) and it was burned into the pan. We had to scrape off little bits just for our daughter to try. Very disappointing, fortunately it was free but still ruined our first BJs experience.  No kids silverware available?! My 5 year old got spaghetti everywhere, struggled to eAt and at one point poked her own mouth. We ended up just taking it with us for her to eat at home. I  will never return to a restaurant that doesn't have a smaller fork or spoon available, not family friendly!"
Jennifer G.,"Fort Lewis, Joint Base Lewis-McChord, WA",145,222,15,4.0,7/27/2017,First time at a BJ's restaurant. My friend and I ordered the lettuce wraps and a pizza. It was the thin crust one but not the flatbread in the appetizers. Everything was good. The waiter should of told us the yellow sauce with the lettuce wraps was spicy mustard. I would of been prepared better when I tasted it!  The pizza was good. Crust was super thin. I probably could of ate the whole thing. But we happened to come on a free dessert night so we didn't resist. I got the salted caramel and my friend got the double/triple...lots of chocolate one. The chocolate one was a but too chocolaty for me. Over all good experience and food was good.
Jayda N.,"Frederick, MD",12,1,1,3.0,11/15/2017,"Very nice and clean restaurant. The service was quick and good, my first time going and it was on a Wednesday. I got the Shrimp & Asparagus Penne. Very good, flavorful but the asparagus was tough."
Sam L.,"Gaithersburg, MD",128,458,718,3.0,7/15/2016,"An expansive American restaurant that also serves their own beer? It's not a new concept, but BJ's decor, menu and drink offerings are massive. Unfortunately their execution is average - meaning that there aren't that many ""wow"" moments. I tried their samplers (pick 4 beers in 5 oz) and found 3/4 to be eh (the winner was the nutty brewnette). Their crispy calamari portion size was also a bit small for the price and definitely taste like re-heated. It seems like an ideal place for work happy hour or a quick lunch spot. But I'd go elsewhere for dinner."
Marley D.,"Frederick, MD",110,136,135,4.0,5/10/2017,"Alright, I know I said I'd never come back here again after a string of less than displeasing service. However, Being that BJ's is one of the few restaurants open late at night I've been giving them another try. 1: service has improved significantly since the first few experiences I've had. The bartenders are ALWAYS great, sit at the bar for good service. In the last 15-20 times I've sat at the bar/high top tables, my order has been wrong only once, but it was taken care of promptly. Thank you.  2: the menu has had some changes over the past year and I will say I appreciate it. The food has improved and I must say I actually enjoy dining at BJ's now. 3: the restaurant is always kept clean, the bar area is very nice and despite being busy there is never an unusually long wait for food/drink orders. The bathrooms are also kept very clean so that definitely adds to this rating. Is it possible for a restaurant to change and get better even after a series of poor experiences? Obviously, yes.  Give BJ's a try if you're in the area, between the friendly bartenders, great IPA selection and good food; there's not much to complain about."
Cheryl C.,"Frederick, MD",0,19,,3.0,8/12/2017,"I went to BJ's on a Tuesday after work around 5 pm with a co-worker for dinner. It was not crowded at all but soon filled up. Our server was very pleasant and attentive and the atmosphere was great. Our food came out quickly which I really appreciated because I was so hungry! I ordered the Crusted Chicken which was a little dry but otherwise delicious! I give BJ's 1 star for great atmosphere, 1 star for, the awesome service we received, and 1 star for their delicious food!"
LA A.,"Silver Spring, MD",67,63,48,3.0,9/20/2017,Arrived at around 9:21pm with a party of ten people they seem a like shocked that we had so many people to accommodate. We got seat quickly and our server came to the instantly and introduced her as Cat at that moment I had a good feeling I could tell she was a veteran server right away she began to take out drink order in her tablet before exiting she mentioned that out drinks was being made already. She returned to our table with all of our ordered beverages and proceeded to take the appetizer order of calamari and a sampler platter at this point it went all down hill from the kitchen stand point. I'm not sure if the kitchen was busy or short handed because our appetizer too more than 25 to arrive to the table.. the calamari was good just need a pinch of salt as for the sampler platter all item le tasted good except the avocado egg roll they were  horrendous it literally was just mushy avocado deep fried in wonton wrap absolutely no seasoning it taste bland. As the server was picking up the dirty dishes we told her about dislike for the avocado roll she did mention you can exchange for more another sampler choice I highly recommend that you do. So after we were finished with the apps it took another 15 to 20 for entrees to arrive at the table and we had to return the vegetarian pizza cause it was ice cold so we waited again and the replacement pizza was piping hot. Buy the time it was almost 11pm and we wanted to leave. Our server Cat did her best with the circumstances as a veteran server do. This was my second experience at BJ's and encounter the same experience server was good but the food was mediocre not sure if I would ever dine there again in the near future.
Rob R.,"Long Beach, CA",109,30,18,4.0,5/1/2017,Ordered the meat lovers from the lunch menu.  Super good and tasty.  With a strawberry lemonade.  Our server was attentive as well. Good spot for lunch and happy hr
D H.,"Frederick, MD",0,18,57,2.0,7/15/2017,"Hit BJ's on a Friday evening after work with the family looking for relaxing time with food and beverages. We have been here several times before and this evenings visit was less stellar than in the past and wanted to pass along a review in case others have experienced similar. There were groups out front of the restaurant when we pulled up which should have tipped us to the dining experience to come. Shrugging that off we approached the hostess with several servers standing around and requested a table for 3. Received the standard verbiage of ~30 minutes before seated. Turns out as we waited this was the default answer for all that approached the hostess station seeking tables 30 mins wait and wait we did. Feeling for the family's with children in hand we continued waiting compounded by the fact that several tables were open empty and servers were standing around. Again this should have tipped us of the service/experience that we would eventually receive this evening. Getting hungrier and not relaxed as expected and after several couples finally got seated ahead of us we inquired about seating and asked about the empty tables. Vague response that we were next. After getting seated we learned from the server that the kitchen was the choke-point and caused a cascading effect, slow food, slow serving, slow to handle the volume of hungry customers waiting. At least the server was straight forward. Again we tried to return focus to relaxing and enjoying dinner but as it turns out more disappointment awaited. Our main order arrived at just around warm temperature. Sauce was left off appetizers and drink which run about $10 each was mixed incorrectly. So suffice to say this wasn't the best visit we have had here and based on this evening we would be reluctant considering all of the other choices in the are to visit again. To yelpers considering visiting, take note of the visual cue's, busy out front, empty tables, servers standing around, and apply to decision-making. Manager visited the hostess station once that we saw and should have noticed what was going on and the unhappy faces of customers waiting. Considered having a one on one with mgr but rather than prolong the situation we deferred. We'll consider options before visiting BJ's in the future."
Harris H.,"Germantown, MD",63,223,7,5.0,11/6/2017,"We have been wanting to try this place, so on our way  back from vacation we gave it a shot.  As we were sitting down, we looked around more and it really is very nice inside.  Our server was excellent and was on top of everything.  We were laughing at the menu.  It is literally a book and will take you some time to get through, much like a diner.  I settled on the jambalaya and it was very good. Plentiful amounts of sausage, chicken and shrimp.  My wife ordered their brisket burger and just couldn't say enough about how great it was.  It as cooked exactly how she wanted it.  It was a perfect ending to a great vacation.  We will definitely be going back."
Sean M.,"Mariposa, CA",8,1,,1.0,2/4/2017,Calamari was warm and almost cold. Soggy too Burger arrived without fries. Some sorta salad or coke slaw thing. Asked for fries. Wrong fries delivered. Fries cold Not the first time either our order has been incorrect or service has been poor. Coming close to scratching this place off our list.
Chris M.,"Alexandria, VA",1,65,56,4.0,4/14/2017,"The food was very good, prices were fair, and the beer was cold!  Our server was very pleasant and knowledgeable about the beer selection, making great recommendations.  The menu is like a phonebook, so read it cover to cover.  I almost went with the salmon tacos until I found the mahi mahi tacos a few pages back (much cheaper).  The kids' portions were substantial.  My only complaint was that the stuffed mushrooms could have been cooked a little more.  When the bill arrived, I was surprised to see our party of 2+4 kids come in under $50.  If traveling up 15/270, this is a great place to stop for a bite. Though there were no significant sporting events going on during our stay, you can clearly see the awesome 107"" flatscreen from about anywhere in the restaurant.  We were in the opposite corner and I could read everything on the screen for the CNN broadcast, so I'm sure this place is great for Ravens games."
Doris B.,"Olney, MD",4,16,,4.0,9/15/2017,"I was there at 6:30 Thursday night with my husband, daughter, son-in-law, & grown granddaughter.  We were seated right away.  Husband, granddaughter, & I had pasta--better than some Italian restaurants.  The servings were generous enough that he & I took some home.  My shrimp & asparagus penne was loaded with asparagus & had a nice amount of well cooked shrimp.  Daughter & son-in-law had the 6"" pepperoni pizzas, which they loved.  We ordered the pizookie trio, which was huge, considering they were ""minis,"" and all three were delicious. The service, however, was the problem.  Our server was friendly and personable, but she was not attentive.  We had to stop another server to ask for drink refills; she brought my son-in-law water, but he had had Sprite.  We also stopped someone to ask for her so we could get a box for leftover pasta and order dessert.  I had also asked her to change the channel of the nearby television from the Orioles to the Nationals, but she didn't.  She did say, ""Didn't they change it?"" so perhaps she asked someone else to do it.  Then it was changed.  Still, we all felt ignored.  Perhaps she had too many tables or they were shorthanded."
Tom W.,"Frederick, MD",7,1,,2.0,9/12/2017,This place is an overpriced bar. The food wasn't that great and their beer prices are high.
Lisa M.,"Frederick, MD",0,7,37,4.0,4/30/2017,They changed their French fries which I liked better!  Otherwise everything was good!
Sean F.,"Danbury, CT",0,3,,5.0,9/1/2017,"Pleasant atmosphere, inviting wait staff, and overall excellent dining experience. Our waiter, Mark T., provided phenomenal service with a smile. 5/5"
Donna H.,"Germantown, MD",249,29,11,4.0,2/23/2017,"I love this place. It is my go to American restaurant and I've been a customer since it opened.  Let me start with how beautiful the restaurant is, from the exterior to interior. The dark wood and trimmings on the walls are extravagant. At the bar, the bottle set up and the amount of taps are aesthetically pleasing.  The service here is sometimes a hit or a miss. When I sat at a high table near the bar, I received great service and was always checked on. However, at the other tables I noticed the service was pretty slow especially in getting the check and refilling drinks. Even when it's not busy, refilling drinks and checking up on us was an issue.  Here are the couple dishes I have tried:  --Hickory Brisket and Bacon Burger- amazing! This burger has so much flavor from the barbecue sauce but what really took the spotlight was the hickory pulled pork.  --New Orleans Jambalaya- The first time I had the Jambalaya was when they first opened and the dish tasted great, however recently the rice was too wet which really made the dish unappetizing.  --Spicy Peanut Chicken with Soba Noodles- okay dish, nothing special to order again.  --Roasted Salmon Peruvian Quinoa Bowl- the salmon was well seasoned and the veggies really complement the salmon. (Healthy option!!)  AND BEST OF ALL!! --PIZOOKIS- My all time favorite is the limited edition snickerdoodle. The cookie is warm and melts in your mouth. There is a crisp at the edges and the ice cream just tops it all off.  P.S. to satisfy your urgent mid-day craving you can order these to go;)"
Sebastian A.,"Hagerstown, MD",0,7,,5.0,8/16/2017,Had a wonderful dinner and the was great seeing a manager who came by to make sure my fiancée and I were doing great. She was genuine and smiled as she spoke to other tables. Colleen thank you for an excellent experience and you have a wonderful restaurant and staff
Marc S.,"Frederick, MD",17,15,,4.0,11/3/2017,"This place is very interesting. Most of my experiences have been very positive. Food is always good, service is usually great. Over the course of time I have had to endure my fair share of below average servers. These people tend to come and go so don't let a bad experience discourage you since they do tend to hire many excellent people too. I tend to go in here during the middle of the week every week for lunch and I can say that the two bartenders I see are always awesome (sadly I don't remember their names!). These two remember my order and give me great service every time I come in. They are always on top of my rewards and make sure my account gets updated with every visit. The food is amazing. The avocado egg rolls are unique and delicious, the pizza is usually awesome, their lunch menu is great, and the pizookie is amazing. They have some unique selections that separate them from the rest ie avocado egg rolls and pizookie. Even their salads are pretty filling if you would rather keep your meal light. Although you may run into a few bumps on the road, don't let that stop you from coming in here because the food is consistently great and 99 percent of the time the service is also just as great."
Brittany S.,"Camp Hill, PA",58,104,160,3.0,11/6/2016,"I don't find anything particularly special about this place... though there were a lot of beers to choose from I'm not a beer drinker so I can't weigh in on that aspect. The mixed/specialty drinks over overpriced and mediocre at best.. Food portions are okay... don't go starving unless you plan to get an over priced appetizer.. I got the chicken Alfredo pasta chicken looked like pre packaged grill mate chicken and there wasn't even a lot of it.. the pasta was very dry which led it to be lacking it flavor.. there was barely any sauce on the noodles.. they clearly do not know about noodle to sauce ratio... I wouldn't chose to go to this place but if someone wanted to go I wouldn't tell them ""omg no"" ...I did eye hustling others plates, the burger and fries looked yummy.. maybe next time..."
Melanie K.,"Clarksburg, MD",33,225,158,3.0,3/1/2016,"We stopped in for an early dinner on Monday. It was one of the few (perhaps only) restaurant we've been to in recent memory where we didn't check any reviews prior to going in. The atmosphere is cool--very contemporary and sleek, with dark wood and marble table tops. There are tons of tables and a really large bar area. The beer menu is, in a word: extensive. The menu was pages (and I mean PAGES) long and at least 1/2 of it was filled with craft brews, in-house brews, and cocktails. It got to the point where I was thinking, ""They do serve food here, right...?? Oh, there it is."" We didn't drink. We were saving room for a nearby brewery tour/event we were attending. Next time! Onto the food. Hubby got a bacon turkey burger and seemed to like it. In the bite I took, I found the burger was moist and flavorful and the bun was tasty. I got a buffalo chicken grilled cheese with fries. The fries were crispy and yummy. The sandwich was OK. I mean, the flavors were decent (the bread was the star), but for some reason I was thinking it would be pulled buffalo chicken, but it was basically breaded boneless wings on toast. Heyyyoo carbs. Not the kind of meal you eat and then feel awesome after. I only ate half and still felt kind of blahhhh when I was done. I know this is nit-picky, but I also didn't like that my sandwich and hubby's burger were served on metal trays akin to a particular BBQ chain. BJ's felt a little classier than that, so the trays were out of place and kind of off-putting. Our waitress was extremely friendly, but a little too attentive. I liked that she gave us suggestions off the menu, but I didn't like how often she came over to our table. I think she stopped by the table 3 times during just our appetizer. An inattentive server would be worse, but there were times I felt a awkward by her presence. And then when we were paying, she stood near the table and before we were even done pulling money out asked if we were going to need change. I'm sure it was because it was early in her shift and she didn't have a lot of change, but c'mon. Be a little more tactful, girl! I'm sure SOMEONE could make you change if we would have needed it. Bottom line: I would come back. This seems like a good place to bring picky eaters or a large group because the menu is huge, so theoretically everyone should be able to find something they can eat."
Chris G.,"Laurel, MD",6,14,2,3.0,11/18/2016,"read no reviews on this place, just stopped in and wow is all I can say.  Food was phenomenal and service was great.  2 thumbs up on this place.   Kinda pricey but you get what you pay for. Update.... first time sitting somewhere other than the bar and the service a horrible.  Had a hair in our food.  I originally rated this a 5 star.  Now I don't know if I'd go back again honestly"
Brandi B.,"Frederick, MD",35,115,80,3.0,11/27/2016,"Stopped by for lunch on a Friday afternoon. Seated quickly, and greeted by our server quickly. They offer a lunch menu that offers a good variety of choices. Their queso appetizer is pretty good.   Nice atmosphere, friendly employees.  Would recommend."
Sandy K.,"Frederick, MD",1,32,,3.0,8/28/2017,"Let's start by saying the server was amazing,,and the avocado rolls were yummy,,,  now the bad part,, the deep dish pizza tasted like french bread with spaghetti sauce,, not so yummy,,but I'll go back to try other things,,,"
Phyllis P.,Germany,107,14,6,4.0,3/9/2017,"I have ALMOST everything positive to say about this place. The food, the servers,  the ambience, and the menu were all spectacular.  But the lady in the front that seats you, and is the last person you see on your way out, had ZERO personality. She needs to learn how to be a people person.  She did not even look at us or smile at us.  This was while she was seating us and also when we left. She should not have that job.   Other than her, I loved this place! Yum Yum! I intend to bring my husband here before we move out of the area where there will be no BJ's."
Brittney B.,"Germantown, MD",67,17,1,5.0,6/13/2017,"Best Kept Secret!! I tried this place for the first time today!! Service was good, food was amazing. Our waiter, Logan was very nice and friendly. He got our order correct and the food was piping hot! We got dessert to go; got home and tried it. Nothing short of amazing!!"
Donna M.,"Frederick, MD",193,76,89,4.0,8/14/2016,Food good. Service good. Nothing spectacular. A lot of craft beers. Also had bottled beer. Food similar to an Apple Bee's or Ruby Tuesdays.
Mickey B.,"Thurmont, MD",0,54,,1.0,1/22/2017,"Tried them again after two previous failures.  They failed again.  We ordered our food, waited, waited and waited some more.  The food finally came out.  The Mediterranean Chicken tacos my wife ordered were burnt and not in taco form.  It was covered in cucumber sauce and feta, where is the chicken.  The pizza my daughter order looked like it had been reheated in the microwave.  My french fries were cold.  Called the manager over who tried to explain, but at this point it was a waste of her breath.  They will not see us again."
William O.,"Frederick, MD",10,18,2,4.0,9/14/2016,"Have been a costumer since they opening their doors sometime in 2013-2014. As in any restaurants mistake's do happen and when it does it takes great management and staff to regain patronage.  Just recently I quietly notified Alyson (sever) about an issue with the temperature sandwich during my lunch experience. Alyson's and Andy's (Manager) attention to the issue was top notch and reflective of above and beyond costumer service.  Great for you to have staff that can make a sub-par visit a memorable one solely based on their integrity, value and positive outlook. Absolutely love the desserts and daily lunch specials."
Kelli F.,"Frederick, MD",104,20,1,4.0,2/20/2017,"Just went to BJ's for a family birthday dinner. When we asked for a table, the restaurant was pretty empty. It was 3:30 on a Sunday afternoon. The food was great and the service was outstanding for our large party at the beginning of our experience and then just kind of puttered out. We ended up weirdly looking around for our server A LOT."
Andi F.,"Los Angeles, CA",179,35,3,5.0,12/30/2016,"I've only ever been to BJ's in Southern California (where I live) but I have to say, Logan is so friendly, knowledgeable, and courteous! He made our Frederick BJ's experience quite a treat for our friend Lindsay's birthday. Thank you Logan!"
Carol F.,"Enterprise, AL",1,19,21,1.0,1/7/2017,"Huge disappointment. Started with the Avacado egg rolls (no flavor, just tasted fried) I ordered the brisket bacon burger, almost no brisket on top. Flavors didn't mesh well, just tasted like a hamburger, fatty bacon, and mediocre brisket. The boyfriend ordered a ""deepdish chicken philly"" HA! It was chicken and veggies sitting on top of half cooked dough. And it was served on a plate. We literally thought they were bringing him the wrong dish when they dropped it off. I ate at a BJ's in Colorado Springs and was very happy with the food and atmosphere.... After eating here we just left feeling guilty for eating like crap and didn't even enjoy our cheat meal. Good thing is it was only $37 for everything."
Shirley A.,"Frederick, MD",1,23,20,4.0,12/15/2016,"Have been meaning to check out this restaurant and finally made it there with my big sis.. After that day have pretty much been there every Wed and Fri for the last month. Any pizookie is good but my family loves the cookies and cream and the monkey bread. The baked ziti (which I've had 5x) is life when made right. You can even dip the bread in the bowl and soak up the rest of the sauce. The pizza is ok, I like that the crust is thick and buttery. We didn't like the spaghetti and big meatballs, matter fact about to throw it away now. What is most impressive is the customer service. It actually places the icing on the cake. You always feel welcomed and there is always a smile on there faces. Great atmosphere for family night and lighting makes it a perfect location for an intimate date."
Mary B.,"Frederick, MD",12,152,53,4.0,4/6/2015,"I'm super shocked at the low reviews of BJs! We are not chain restaurant people, but if you're out by the mall and doing some shopping, it's a great option. We've been here several times now. We love their mozzarella salad with balsamic glaze. It's so good and so cheap. They won us over with it before we ever actually got our meals. I had a Mediterranean dish and it was filling and quite good. With chain places, you never know what you'll get but we were super impressed. And- we love their beer! They have a great selection and their waiters/waitresses that we've had have always been knowledgeable about what they carry. If you're out running around at this end of town, give them a try. Again, I'm not sure why they have low reviews- we think they are great."
