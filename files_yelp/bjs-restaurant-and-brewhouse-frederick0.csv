Mark A.,"Frederick, MD",0,6,,2.0,3/15/2014,"Had dinner with my family tonite, party of 4.  Called ahead and was told there was a 30 minute wait (didn't understand this but okay).  Arrived at our reservation time and was seated within 5 minutes - felt bad for all the people that were there before us.  Stacy, our server, was very nice and informative. That's where it ended. Took nearly 2 hours to complete the meal!  Our two beers came our rather quick but nearly 15 minutes for the kids sodas to arrive.  Stacy lost the first tray when another coworker bumped into her but I would have thought that someone would have expedited the re-order. Corn fritters came out after 10 minutes but realizing the other tables were not getting their stuff, I ordered calamari - took nearly 25 minutes to arrive. After 90 minutes, I grabbed the manager to let him know we had been waiting and he said he would check on it. The burgers and tacos arrived soon after. Never heard from him again but saw him walking thru the restaurant picking up menus and running back to the hostess station.  The charm we had seen initially from Stacy had all but evaporated., We asked for the check and Stacy said the manager had adjusted the bill because of the wait, I had to look at the bill to see what was up, seeing he had taken off the calamari as a nice gesture.  As we walked out I stopped the manager to thank him but also the say he should have followed up with us at the table.  His comment was ""I got real busy"". Really? I worked in the business for many years. I have not had service like this in a long time.  It was just beer and burgers. Would definitely go to Wag's in downtown Frederick before returning here again."
Heather R.,"Middletown, MD",0,2,,1.0,11/16/2015,"We had dinner there last night. We were sat at 6 pm and didn't leave until after 8 pm. We weren't greeted by our server for 10 minutes. We ordered drinks, apps and our sons dinner when she finally arrived. Our drinks came, then half of our apps. We placed our orders and again waited. About 30-35 mins later our food arrives. We had to ask where the other half of the apps were that we never recieved and OUR SONS which we had ordered 40 mins or more prior to this. Took our first bite and ALL of our food was cold! Asked for the manager. She took the food back, both her and the server blamed the kitchen and said they would bring us fresh. About 10 mins later our food comes back out along with our sons, finally. Our sons food was not even what he had asked for. We had to ask our server for refills on water (only time we saw her). The couple we were with were finished their dinner by the time we finally got ours so they ordered dessert. Our son asked the server for a few strawberries and she said of course she would be back. About 15 mins go by and still no dessert and no strawberries, however the waitress dropped off our bills! Finally, after asking for the dessert and strawberries again the dessert came out. It wasn't until we left that we got the strawberries from the hostess at the front desk!!!!! This is the worst service and excuses we have ever heard! I can take cold food and slow service but when you forget my child's food for an hr after we order it that's a HUGE problem!"
Liz E.,"Frederick, MD",0,23,,5.0,8/21/2014,"I am really surprised to see all the negative reviews.  I have been to BJ's multiple times and never had an issue.  The only time where service was slow was when our waitress had a table of 20 but she told us before hand so it didn't bother me.  The beer is pretty decent and the bar can pretty much make anything you want.  I have had everything from the crispy jalapeno burger, pizza, balsamic glazed chicken, and the Mediterranean chicken pita tacos with no complaint.  Oh and they Pizookie's are to die for so make sure you save room for that!"
Joe J.,"Frederick, MD",44,26,,2.0,12/26/2013,"Ok this is a new upper mid scale brew house outside of FSK mall..  The face of the building rather preposterously faces the road so everyone has to either park on the side or the back and trek around front..  Not sure what to make of that..  Inside the building there is a nice upscale feel to the decore.  The hosts stand rather looks like a concierge desk.  Scattered around are the usual tv's hopelessly set for sports and 1 on the news.  Appetisers were fried artichoke hearts which were ok and the corn fritters which were awesome.  Food was ordered..  I had the Pasta with alfredo, broccoli and chicken and my companion had the pork chops with green beans and mash.  There really is no way to put this less bluntly..  the pasta was deadly deadly dull.  There was no flavor whatso ever.  The chops were flavorful but dry.  The beans were not seasoned at all.  The mash potatoes were, however, quite good.  Other things that let the experience down were the wait staff not being fully up to speed on the menu and the napkins were actually wet.  When these things were pointed out to management nothing was offered to compensate..  Not a dessert or a discount or anything..  he just offered the bill..  Which is not good customer service..  Bj's seems to be more focused on the beers than the food.  Strike one."
Rachel O.,"Hagerstown, MD",28,2,,5.0,10/15/2014,"I went here after my college graduation and had never been but would love to go back! They had such good food, nothing I ate could I possibly complain about, it was all so good, especially their white cheddar mashed potatoes! I also had their signature Mojito, first-time-ever BTW, and it was sooooo good!! I haven't had one as good since! Definitely worth the 20 minute drive to Frederick!"
Douglas R.,"Gaithersburg, MD",2,17,,4.0,2/20/2014,"An outstanding experience. Our server Amanda P was very attentive and made great beer recommendations, especially the nutty brunette brown ale. Highly recommend the California club flatbread pizza with avocado and boneless wings."
Dnatella B.,"Boyds, MD",0,8,1,5.0,12/26/2013,Great place ! We have been a few times food is very good reasonable priced ! Staff well trained on the menu that is a plus these days! Glad to have this new restaurant in Frederick!
Matt B.,"Frederick, MD",68,7,4,2.0,7/5/2014,"Beautiful ambiance, but not much else.  Very clean and new.  Huge!  Easy to get in too but here ends the good stuff.  Clearly the cost of the menu items is going to pay for the oversized building with giant TV's and of course to management paycheck cuz it sure isn't going into the food. You can tell a lot about a place from the dressings they serve.  Ranch came with the dinner salad and was also placed as a side to the kids meals.  Right out of a plastic container with out even a hint of a quality name brand.  $10.95 for spring rolls that came out a bag from the schwans guy. The fish and chips was ok but lacking in flavor even though the batter was made with one of their hand crafted beers.  I hope the beer on its own has more flavor or what's the point.  Wife said her salmon was pretty good but nothing special.  Could have gotten it at an Applebee's.  Service was ok as well which is to say that we were served. When the waitress asked if we had been in before we answered ""no"". Great opportunity for here to upsell us on the menu or dessert which we didn't end up ordering.  No. She took the time to tell my two kids that they had ten hand crafted beers which we didn't order either.  Know your audience and in the mean the, remove some of the used dishes from the table once in a while."
marty b.,"Adamstown, MD",11,24,,1.0,5/29/2014,Been there many times  giving them the benefit of the doubt. Food gets worse every  time I have tried.This time  had the worst salad I have ever had. Service was terrible again. They started out decent when they opened and go downhill . The others in my party were on their 3rd course before I got my salad and it came out wrong to boot. Signature dressing was so salty that I could not eat it.   Waitress was more interested in bsing with a co worker than taking care of orders.   BAD BAD BAD
Tammy H.,"Frederick, MD",0,12,,2.0,6/4/2014,"Okay food.  Wine was a bit on pricey side.  (I guess because it is a brew house). House Cabernet was $10.25 during Happy hour hours on a Wednesday evening.  Ordered appetizers, egg rolls are good!!! The lettuce wraps are good & spicy but I want to wrap my own lettuce wraps.  Not have the kitchen dictate the wrap contents. Overall......ok in my opinion.  2 appetizers & 4 glasses of wine ( yes, I was with a friend) ....... The bill was $66!!!!  Then we were told happy hour specials were available at the bar only."
Jennifer L.,"Myersville, MD",0,3,,4.0,5/1/2014,The pizza was delicious. Service was great. The avocado roll appetizer was exactly what it says (avocado rolled up)...little bland but the dipping sauce was yummy. Very nice inside.
Jerry W.,"Frederick, MD",0,22,,4.0,1/19/2015,"With its beautiful Art Deco mural, granite tabletops, dark wood accents, and stunning bar, BJ's is truly a gorgeous restaurant - hands down the fanciest sports bar I have ever eaten in.  That being said, the menu doesn't reflect the decor, that isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I think its important to note.  The menu serves casual dining staples like grilled salmon and rice pilaf, rib eye with mash potatoes and green beans, pizzas, burgers, and a handful of pasta dishes (you get the idea).  During my visit to BJ's, I had their burger with cheddar and bacon and a side of french fries ($8.95).  My wife had their raspberry tea mocktail and shrimp tacos (two), which were stuffed with shrimp (at least 8 shrimp per taco) and came with a side of tortilla chips and two kinds of sauces.  We also shared their corn fritters with chipotle/bacon aioli (best bite of the night).  My burger was flavorful and my wife enjoyed her drink and tacos.  Our meal came to 27 dollars. I give BJ's 3 stars for the food (Average for Yelp) and an additional star for the decor and excellent service."
Angela S.,"New Market, MD",0,1,,4.0,1/8/2014,"Haven't been in person but have had carry out. (I have been waiting for them to workout all of the new Restaurant issues) My husband stopped in on his way home on a Sunday afternoon. He wanted to grab a beer or two. He called and offered to bring me carry out. He read most of the menu to me (great selection and range of foods offered) I decided on the fried chicken. You get two chicken breasts, cheddar mashed potatoes, vegetable and a white gravy. My husband asked for the gravy on the side. Who wants soggy fried chicken?  The meal arrived quickly but the gravy was on the chicken. The bartender took it back and placed a second order. This time it took awhile. The bartender apologized profusely for the delay and had the manager comp the meal. The cheddar mashed potatoes were great. The vegetable (corn) and gravy were okay. The chicken was very good. I reheated the chicken in our toaster oven for a few minutes. It was crunchy on the outside and moist and juicy on the inside. I think the use of a few seasonings in the coating would be nice. Overall about a three star meal but pretty good for carry out. Hope they can work out there service issues and I look forward to dinning there in the near future."
