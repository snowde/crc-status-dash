NeCosia C.,"Hyattsville, MD",54,11,19,5.0,12/7/2015,I tip toed in here on a late Friday night. Maybe like an hour or less before closing and received the upmost kindliness from server Mark. I will definitely return and request him!!! My food was so good. Mark had recommended the root beer wings and calamari. I ordered both and it was fantastically delicious!!!
Joel S.,"Gaithersburg, MD",10,50,6,5.0,10/18/2014,Stopped by since it happened to be near where we were on a road trip when decided we wanted lunch. Had great service (Brian)  and the food was very good. Our chocolate peanut butter s'more pazookie. . The Mahi tacos were perfection.
Jibran K.,"Herndon, VA",0,13,,2.0,2/20/2016,"Pretty overrated, had heard great things about it so was pretty excited to try it out.  Went on a Saturday night and were told it would be a 15 minute wait but it took about 45 minutes to get seated.  Service I thought was great as our waitress was very attentive and friendly but the food was just very blah.  We got flatbread cheese pizza which was ok, burger and fries, and a salmon dish.  Just didn't have any great taste to any of the food and left me pretty disappointed"
John F.,"Charles Town, WV",0,7,2,5.0,1/12/2015,"It's hard to beat the food here. Been here 6 times and the food quality and taste are hard to beat anywhere and in Frederick impossible. Very good beer selection not only on tap but by the bottle also.  The server staff is friendly and knowledgeable. The seating is comfortable. The atmosphere has a nice buzz about it without being overbearing. Noise level makes conversation easy.. Simply put.- best reasonably priced, good food, nice place in the area."
Boris W.,"Clarksburg, MD",2,9,,2.0,7/26/2015,"Dinner at BJs was an alternative to crowded OliveGarden.  The wait stretched over 40 minutes for a simple pasta/salad/soup/burger order.  When it finally arrived (you know what's coming) the burger was stale and cold and the soup was cold.  Catch-22, but we sent those back.  Luckily, my daughter had the pasta and it was good and she could eat while my wife and I waited.  The waiter apologized and offered a salad - I said no and then figured forget the salad, I'll take a beer.  Then the manager showed up, apologized and said he'd take off the soup&salad - that's a nice touch to mitigate the damage.  The second attempt was solid with a good burger and warm soup.  The bill showed the beer though and I asked since I assumed it was comped vs. the salad - he said the salad would have been but MD law is that there's no free beer?! I can't say I'd be back - the original wait and redo of half the orders is a waste of time - who wants to risk that.  But I do give credit to the manager coming by."
Kristen H.,"Germantown, MD",119,147,235,5.0,5/26/2015,"This place is poppin!  I have come here a few times since it's been open and the food and atmosphere are well done.  The whole restaurant is huge!  Lot's of room and comfortable seating areas, especially for big groups if you have them.  On the weekends we had to wait a little while to be seated for dinner, but that's to be expected on a Saturday night.  We just went to the bar and got a drink and waited for our table.  Any place that has their own brewed beer is a plus for me, and gives me the opportunity to try something new.  Their amber ale is my favorite.  The first time I came here I had the Moroccan Spiced Salmon, very tasty!  I loved the seasoning and sauce, it had a nice pop of flavor.  I will say the desserts here are to die for!  The pizookie trio is big enough for a few people to share, and you can try whichever pizookie you want!  I would come here for the dessert alone.  I've never had a bad time here, so hopefully that continues!"
Megan W.,"Frederick, MD",0,3,,1.0,10/15/2015,"I wish I could give no stars our experience was horrible I think we saw out server Mahala about 3-4 times, we waited 10 minutes to just see our server and then another 15 minutes till we got our drinks and were able to order. After 45 minutes of waiting for our order half of that time with empty glasses someone else brought us our food, we where almost done our meal when we finally saw our server for the first time in an hour, at this point we where almost done our meal and still no drink refills. After being ignored for another 20 minutes we got the check, and then she walked past the table another 3 times ignoring the bill with the credit card sticking out of it. I finally had to flag her down to get her to take it back to run our card!  This experience was horrible, I've been a server and ignoring your tables will not get you far."
Oliver T.,"San Francisco, CA",69,22,12,1.0,8/19/2015,"Seriously give me back the $8 pity tip I gave you for not offering me a drink when I decided to eat my pizza in-house. No napkins, and then here's the kicker- a pazooki to go only to not have any utensils. You 2 stupid lazy asses"
Kelsey B.,"Frederick, MD",0,2,,1.0,1/13/2015,"Another mediocre visit- Asked to have grilled chicken on my fettuccine- came out the other way instead. My drink as well as my friends drinks were definitely not correct- got a tangerine drink rather than a strawberry one. Food was cold upon arrival. Slow service. Server seemed to repeat what we said back correctly, then upon execution mixed it up completly.  Take out service has been ready every time for me. Order is always correct there.  As stated in pervious reviews, managers just seem to make excuses rather than fix the issues. As a chain resturant you'd expect better. Management is horrid compared to other chain restaurants such as TGI Fridays, or Olive Garden"
Nate W.,"Frederick, MD",48,3,,4.0,1/7/2016,Great food just took awhile to get seated. Mixed drinks where good even got a free drinks because the drink was wrong. Bison burger was made to order the way I wanted and wings are deep fried. Good service will come back.
Slap D.,"Walkersville, MD",2,31,2,4.0,2/25/2014,We were told 30 min and just left after 1h 30 min!!!!!! DO NOT eat here if you actually want to eat food!!!  Btw...we have 3 kids and this is a Tuesday night. What a waste of time.  UPDATE... Have been twice with clients during lunch and much happier with service and meal was very good. Pizza is incredible. Changed my rating to 4 stars.
Nikki V.,"Frederick, MD",42,220,229,4.0,8/1/2014,"We back it took awhile for ther server to take our order but the place was packed. I thought they were giving out free food today. The food was great. Try the salmon and vegetables,  jambalaya,  soup and sandwich mix. It was all great."
Elisabeth H.,"Frederick, MD",45,148,9,2.0,2/12/2014,"Ate at BJ's for the first time last weekend and was very underwhelmed. The restaurant looks great, the service was good for the most part, the food was not bad but nothing to write home about. We popped in on Sunday night for a light meal and were impressed with the space. The restaurant was much bigger then I had expected it to be from the outside. We were seated quickly and our waitress came over right away. We both tried some of BJ's drink options a beer and cider. I eat GF so can only comment on what I could have which was the cider, and it was bad. I have tried several different kinds of cider and I found this disgustingly sweet. It almost tasted like a strawberry wine but even sweeter. Not what I was looking for but if you like really sweet drinks I would recommend you this.  The menu is massive, almost reminds me (size wise) of the Cheesecake factory and was a little intimidating. We opted for the cobb salad and a GF pizza. It was all very underwhelming but the salad more so. I have a 'thing' read big pet peeve with shredded taco iceberg taco lettuce being passed off as a salad. It seems cheap to me and like corners are being cut especially when you are paying around $13 plus for  a salad. The quantity of toppings was disappointing also very sparse. Just very blah.  The GF pizza was good, not bad but not great. I have had better and personally think Domino's is better.  The service was good with a couple exceptions. On the website they advertise a gluten free menu we asked for one but were told they ran out? Which is strange I feel like people don't get to keep or take home their menu. In the absence of the menu the waitress was as helpful as she could be but didn't want to assume so I was left with few options. At $45 for two people to have one drink share a salad and pizza the price is a little high. Had the food been better I wouldn't have minded as much, but it wasn't. With SO many places to eat in Frederick, from chains to individual restaurants, that quite frankly are much better I can say that I will not be going back."
Kevin J.,"Leesburg, VA",0,11,5,5.0,8/24/2014,"The wife and I drove up to shop a little and stopped in for lunch.  Fast service...great chicken pizza, and the best Kolsch beer I've ever had.  Great job guys..."
Steve B.,"New Market, MD",0,69,,4.0,7/6/2015,"We've enjoyed dinner at BJ's twice in the last couple months (I had to rewrite that sentence twice, because inside I'm a 12-year-old boy). First, my wife and I took our little grandchild, and on a Saturday late afternoon, it was a long wait in the crowded little lobby. Once we got in, though, it worked well for us. Extensive menu, and all we've tried has been good. Long list of beers (including their own and other micros) and fun drinks. TV's all over, and lots to look at. Service was pretty good. Our second date there, just the two of us, kept pace with the first. We enjoyed the appetizer combo (which I knew would be too much food, and it was), the seared Ahi salad, and the parmesan crusted chicken. All were good, and my chicken was excellent. I tried a few of their beers, which were tasty. Pros: long and varied menu. Cheerful service, and pretty quick to tableside. Lots of drink choices. Lots to look at. Servings are pretty big, but there are lots of smart choices on the menu. Cons: The wait for a table (we did not call ahead, which might have helped). Loud, ""warehouse-y"" atmosphere. We'll be back to try more things on that menu, and I have high hopes. We'll also plan to beat the dinner rush if we can."
Andrew L.,"New Market, MD",2,14,2,4.0,2/25/2014,Very nice atmosphere. Lots of choices.  Actually TOO MANY. However the food was excelleny. I ordered the cChicken Tuscany Limone that was awesome and she ordered the roast beef dip. The beers were bery good but they were not cheap about 5 for a draft upwards to 8-10 for the upper crust beers.
Nicole R.,"Frederick, MD",85,13,,4.0,8/2/2014,"We were unsure about going here at first,  but now it might be one of my favorite places to take the family.  I had the parmesean chicken,  the stuff is fantastic.  The bf tried 2 of their beers and really enjoyed them.  There is a salted caramel pizzookie (sp)  sundae that is divine,  especially if you are a fan of toffee!  My kid was completely happy with his food. They have tons of side choices for little ones instead of the same old boring fries or veg of the day.  Side note on cool for kids factor: the crayons are triangular  so they don't roll off the table and the kids drinks have bendy straws so the aren't tipping and spilling everytime they take a drink.  Only parents of toddlers can appreciate not having crayons roll on the floor every 4 minutes.  Overall,  an enjoyable experience. 4.5 stars overall.  Also,  the service was excellent!"
andrew n.,"Frederick, MD",97,87,18,2.0,12/22/2013,"We went there yesterday for lunch. There were 4 kids & 4 adults. Here are the ""cliff notes"": Pros: 1. I tried the IPA and stout. Both beers were tasty.  2.  I had the jalapeño burger. I enjoyed it and the shoe string fries were well seasoned.  3.  Our server was great.  4.  Great customer service. More on this later.  Cons: 1.  Beers are a bit pricier than local options (Barley & Hops and Brewer's Alley). 2.  Kitchen and bar were SLOW.  It took almost 2 hour for our meal. My friend times how long it took for his second beer to arrive. It was literally 19+ minutes. Some of the food orders came out wrong/incomplete.  With 3 six-year-olds and a four-year-old, we were running out of options to keep the kids entertained.  3.  We had collectively decided we would NOT be returning to BJs. All of that said - the manager came by the table and apologized for all the mistakes, slowness, etc. She didn't make excuses and simply owned the problems. That was refreshing and we were willing to leave it at that. She then said our lunch was on her and asked if we wanted anything else to eat/drink.  We thanked her for the free lunch and declined any more food, etc.  The fact that we received a sincere apology would likely have been enough to make us give it one more try. The free lunch sealed it. We'll go back one more time and hope history doesn't repeat itself."
Mike G.,"Poolesville, MD",0,7,1,1.0,8/23/2015,I just paid $20 for a frozen pizza. Pizza was cold in the middle and you could still see the strands of cheese that weren't melted. Another restaurant serving pre made frozen food. If you can operate an oven save your money and go to the local grocery store and pick up something from the frozen food isle.
Amber C.,"Frederick, MD",6,7,7,4.0,7/18/2014,"The atmosphere of this place is great and good for a chill date night or a family meal. The corn fritters were very well done and a great start to the dinner. I also recommend trying the sampler of their brews if you like beer. Our server seemed very knowledgeable about the somewhat extensive menu, but he was also quite busy and almost never came by. All in all I'll definitely be going back as it is a cool restaurant with good food and drinks."
