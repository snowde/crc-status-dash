Nick N.,"Mount Airy, MD",170,20,14,5.0,6/17/2015,"Great beer selection, was here with my mom for lunch. Our service was very good, our waitress was familiar with the menu and gave us good recommendations. The decor is 5/5 very comfortable perfect place to hang out after work! I started with the Brussel sprouts appetizer great balance of heat and sweet. I got the bj burger with bacon, cooked perfect and fries were good my mom enjoyed her salad as well. I will definitely be back sometime soon!"
C. B.,"Harvest, AL",0,28,,3.0,10/22/2015,"This place is a mixed-bag for me.  We've found the wait staff to be friendly and helpful, and the place is comfortable.  We've never had to wait for a table.  The food, for the most part, is mediocre at this price point.  On our first visit, my sandwich was quite dry and the draft root beer disappointing.  My daughter's seafood entree was so drenched in lemon juice, she couldn't eat it.  (They did remove it from our bill, to their credit).  Spouse liked the pizza, and the kids meal pizza was really good.  On the second visit, service was painfully slow, even being mostly empty. Manager came out to apologize because they were training a new cook. My seafood/quinoa dish also came drenched in lemon juice.  I didn't sent it back, but probably should have.  Personally, don't care for most of the menu.  I'll just stick to the pizza when I'm not in a hurry."
Phil C.,"Boyds, MD",3,12,46,5.0,5/21/2014,"We took a cruise to Frederick today to BJ's, and we were not disappointed.  We started off with the peach tea and raspberry tea - both were refreshing.  We had to order the Avocado Eggrolls. They're so damn good. We are trying to eat more healthy, so we both went for the fish. A good call.  I went for the Mahi-Mahi and my friend tried the blackened salmon.   The pics don't lie.. The fish was excellent. The salmon was blackened the way I like to make it ...crispy on the outside, moist and juicy on the inside.  The Mahi-Mahi was baked with sweet honey glaze on a bed of pineapple and rice with stirfried vegetables. ""Smoking"". We have come here 4 or more times in the last several months, and the food keeps getting better each time.  It's a super nice restaurant, good service, a chilled place to go. This place Rocks"
Derek H.,"New Market, MD",11,33,67,2.0,12/21/2013,"This restaurant is new to the area. They opened across the street from Barley and Hops, a local restaurant and brewery.  It's also across the street from an Applebee's.  Given the title, I was expecting something more...like a better restaurant and brewery.  They had a wide variety of beer but it was clear they didn't brew it there. (not that there is anything wrong with that)  But honestly, with brewery in the title, I wanted a nice beer paired with my lunch.  The beer is priced double that of Barley and Hops and comparatively half as flavorful. The food is certainly tastier than an Applebee's.   The interior and exterior design of the restaurant is great.  In the end, you don't go to a restaurant to look around. You go there to eat and take in the entire experience.  Our server was really slow but pleasant. The place has only been opened for a month so maybe she's really new.  For an appetizer, I had a chicken tortilla soup. Very cool serving presentation and full of flavor. Seriously, that was a really tasty soup!  For the entree, I had the barbecue bison burger.  The plating was nice but it really lacked flavor. It didn't have chipotle BBQ sauce, pico de gallo, or baja sauce (as listed on the menu).  I actually looked up the burger, once I got home. I bet it would have been a halfway decent tasting burger, if they would have remembered to include everything listed in the menu description. The one thing worth going for was the dessert, a ""Pizookie"" trio. It's three mini fresh baked cookies (white chocolate and macadamia nut, chocolate chip and a chocolate on chocolate), with ice cream, served in mini pizza style pans.  Proceeds from Pizookie sales go to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. A little charity is always nice. If you want to have a tasty beer (made on site) with your lunch or dinner, go across the street to Barley and Hops. If you're thinking of maybe going to Applebee's, try this place. I'm sure this location will get better in time. For that reason, we'll give it another shot.  Until then, I'm looking forward to a few outings to Barley and Hops. ps. If you have kids, bring some paper for drawing. They hand out crayons and a paper menu but it's really not that fun for a kid.  A few math problems?  Really?"
Victoria N.,"Frederick, MD",216,424,63,3.0,1/13/2014,"I would love to give BJ's 4 stars, but I just can't. Our entrees were just OK, nothing special. However, I had a wonderful drink and the Pizookies are delicious! Our server was wonderful despite being on a long and busy shift, which we really appreciated. BJ's is a nice addition to Frederick and we know we'll stop in again. Just be careful, all those LED lights on the ceiling can be a distraction."
Nora H.,"Frederick, MD",6,73,,2.0,4/16/2016,"We are no longer frequenting this place.  They not only did not improve, but their Happy Hour prices and offerings changed for the worse."
Daniel M.,"Frederick, MD",0,19,,2.0,2/1/2015,"I place BJ's in a category of restaurants that seem to be focused on image and setting as much as they are about food. I suppose a lot of restaurants strives to have an identity beyond just food in some way, but sometimes it seems that the food takes second seat to the overall feel.  I was curious to try BJ's when they opened, they seemed to be going for that more 'upscale chain' type restaurant (think Gordon Biersch or Cheesecake Factory).  When we walked in, we were met by what seemed to be a team of staff whose first question was whether or not we had a reservation.  I do understand that there are certainly some places where a reservation was essential, but I had a hard time believing that only a week after opening, this massively expansive restaurant had become such the hot spot that a reservation was required for 11 am lunch on a weekday. We were seated in a very comfortable booth, and while we waited (and waited) for someone to take our drink order, I had ample time to survey the decor.  Overall, it felt forced and jumbled. Incorporating elements of various high end establishments I had visited over the years. My overall impression was that they really had no individual identity, they were only mimicking elements of other establishments. Looking over the menu, it was clear this approach carried over to the food offerings.  Most items on the menu seems vaguely reminiscent of other restaurants.  We selected Avocado egg rolls as an appetizer, as I really enjoy the ones from Cheesecake factory, and these seemed to be virtually identical based on the description. The only difference ended up being the flavor, which was sadly absent. Bland and undercooked. We ordered a variety of burgers and sandwiches among us, and the common opinion was that we had all tried something similar someplace else, and it was better at the other place. The burger patties were frozen, and seasoning was not to be found. The fries not he side were no more than food service grade frozen from a bag.  While I don't feel that any of the food was such that it was inedible, it seemed to have little effort put into it. If you are looking for a comfortable place to meet with friends, have some drinks and a bite to eat. This wouldn't be a bad place (although it gets a bit noisy when it starts filling up), but if you are looking for a memorable meal, this really isn't the place."
Lloyd W.,"Williamsburg, VA",3,148,14,2.0,1/1/2015,"After having lunch at BJ's with two business associates, my attitude is as indifferent as the service we experienced. The noontime hostess took our name and brushed us off to the side with all the warmth of the cold post Christmas week weather. Once seated (a very short wait) our waiter (Mark T.) approached before we had settled in and asked for our drink and appetizer order. When we passed on an app, he asked for our lunch order...Again, we had not been in the booth for more than 45 seconds! I understand all about turning tables but give me a break. So we ordered and the food was delivered in short order and the server conducted the ""auction:"" ""Who had the Cobb Salad? Scallops? So you must have the Fish Tacos then?"" Then she left never to be seen again which was fine except we had no silverware. We flagged down our waiter who was gone for at least 3 minutes before we asked another staff member who was kind enough to deliver the utensils and napkins. Mark T. never returned to ask about our food. The food was OK (a 3-Star on the Yelp scale) as were the portion sizes while the soup was warm at best. The total experience was a ""2"" due to indifferent staff starting with the hostess and ending with our waiter's ""hit and run"" drop of the check without even the obligatory ""have a nice day."" Of course the check provided the so very handy calculation of a 15%,18% and 20% tip. It should have included the calculation for a 2% tip as that number would have been a closer representation of the day's service level."
Michael D.,"Baltimore, MD",2,11,,5.0,7/2/2015,"Always great food and service.  Love the interior design of this place, very warm and inviting.  Great place for lunch or dinner and also great place for small business meetings."
A L.,"Gaithersburg, MD",0,31,,2.0,4/6/2016,"Be prepared to wait...forever! There is almost always a line and they'll tell you it's 15 minutes when you'll really wait close to an hour. This has happened to me on multiple occasions. The food is good, not great, and honestly isn't worth a wait. The pizookie is great but even that isn't worth the long wait to get seated and then the longer than average wait to get your food. The waiters and waitresses are very nice but that doesn't help when you're beyond hungry by the time you get your food. The worst part is that they're slow even when they have tables open!"
Christy R.,"Frederick, MD",1,14,1,4.0,6/29/2014,"We love BJs! We've been with a large group, just the 2 of us, and done carry out orders. The service has been amazing each time we've visited. We've never been in a rush, so if service was slow, we didn't realize. Our drinks were always full and our food was hot when it arrived to our table.  They food is excellent. They serve huge portions that could easily be shared. There are so many options, and many price points, which is nice! The only drawback is drink prices. Most are $8-10 a piece, but they are great drinks! The strawberry mojito is my favorite. It's fresh and scrumptious! Their lunch specials are fantastic! For about $6-7 you can get a mini pizza and choice of salad. It's an amazing deal, and it's good on carry out orders too!"
Jess H.,"Damascus, MD",24,2,,2.0,8/30/2015,"We have been here several times before, but today was just not enjoyable!  Our server was running around like crazy saying how busy he was, constantly wiping sweat off of his face with his hand and sleeve. In my eyes very unprofessional and gross to boot.  The calamari was horrible, no crunch and had a very over fishy taste and smell and the portion was very small. Will have to rethink going back."
Robin S.,"Irwin, PA",4,48,34,3.0,5/15/2014,"Love this place, especially for lunch. The corn fritters are awesome. And the southern fried chicken is very good! Despite being a chain, this place is worth stopping at! Also, in the evening they have plenty of different beers to choose from! A rotating choice of microbrew beers....check it out!"
Tom L.,"Frederick, MD",13,2,,5.0,5/19/2016,Great food and great staff Russell and Mary Ellen were great at the bar and the manager Michelle was very friendly and helpful with the menu
Katie L.,"Kyle, TX",27,115,8,5.0,1/24/2014,"We go quite often! First time we went was the day after they opened we waited 15min and no server came by to take our drink order, so we stopped another waiter walking by to see if he could find our waiter as we were ready to order both our drinks and food. He gladly took our entire order then told us he would find our waiter. He came back with our drinks and our actual waiter who apologized to us as they were still getting used to their sections. Food came out in a timely manner and was delicious! The chicken lettuce wraps were delicious! We have since been back a couple more times and I always try something new. The root beer and orange cream soda are yummy, and so is the Parmesan crusted chicken. Also if you can fit in the dessert get the pazooki!"
Patrick C.,"Ballenger Creek, MD",27,19,16,1.0,4/11/2015,Don't like giving ones but the food wait was crazy. The Deep Dish cheese only pizza had no sauce because we said no tomato so basically it was cheese bread. Last time to the place.
Kyü R.,"Frederick, MD",0,22,5,4.0,7/12/2015,Awesome food and great service. Shots are a little more pricey than I'd like ($9 for a shot of fireball) but the experience is worth it.
M D.,"Frederick, MD",0,2,,1.0,4/11/2016,"Terrible service. Food came out cold, drinks came out warm. Had to wait 30 minutes for our appetizer which was just chips and salsa. Hour and half for dinner only to be served cold, our Margaritas were warm, had to ask for silverware and wait another 5 minutes for that.  We didn't even know the waitress name. The Manager removed our dinner from the ticket, yet still had us pay for appetizer and drinks. Very disappointing, in the lack of service and care of their customers. Will defiantly not go back or recommend."
Ben W.,"Frederick, MD",1,6,,4.0,7/3/2015,"This place had good pizza and beer.  The prices are a bit high, but the quality of the food and service each time we have been there are great.  The staff can answer questions about the menu and the variety of brews."
Michele W.,"Woodbine, MD",59,420,28,3.0,9/3/2014,"BJ's carry their own diverse selection of brews. The menu is fairly extensive. The decor is modern and warm. The service was good. We enjoyed the wings and shrimp wraps for our appetizers. The wings were sauced and spiced nicely and they were plump, juicy, and slightly crisp. The shrimp in the wraps were lightly blackened and additional toppings were fresh and crisp. We shared a pizza for our meal. The crust was unique to anything that I have had before. It was thin and crispy without being crunchy. The toppings were perfectly balanced with the sauce and cheese."
