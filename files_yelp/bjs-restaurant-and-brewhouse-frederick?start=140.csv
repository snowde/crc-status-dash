Christine G.,"Middletown, MD",0,2,,4.0,6/26/2015,"We have eaten here four times now. Food and service has been excellent! The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is my Classic Margarita came without salt. When I asked the server about it, she said, ""That type of Margarita doesn't come with salt"". Really? I could understand a watermelon Margarita coming without salt, but a classic should have salt. She did bring me a glass with salt that I was able to pour most of my drink into."
Jack C.,"Frederick, MD",0,5,8,3.0,4/2/2016,"The food at BJ's is delicious, so you may wonder why I'm only giving it three stars. I'm taking off one star because on multiple occasions it took a long time for me to get my food, and the Wifi there absolutely stinks."
Elaine B.,"Gaithersburg, MD",162,20,11,5.0,8/2/2015,"We were thrilled when BJs opened up in Frederick, MD after falling in love with the food at its location in Daytona/ pt orange Florida. Everything on the menu is delicious and the beer is great too!"
Ashley P.,"Washington, DC",97,293,56,5.0,9/13/2014,"I had a great experience here! I always try to visit a BJ's when I can, since they support Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. So, it was a nice treat when I spotted a recently opened location in Frederick, while in town on business. I walked right into a clean, airy, modern restaurant, and was warmly greeted. There were a good number of people there at 6:00ish on a Wednesday night when I went, but I didn't have to wait for a table. My server was friendly and attentive. I went with the pepperoni pizza, which is always a hit. I noticed it wasn't deep dish, so it would've been helpful if the server had asked, since I incorrectly assumed it would automatically be a deep dish pizza. Womp womp womp. Still, it was delicious, and a pepperoni lover's dream! For dessert I went with their s'mores pazookie (butchering the spelling here), and it was literally one of the best desserts I've ever had in the almost (I said almost) three decades I've been living! Cookie baked in a personal size skillet, with ice cream, and s'mores fixins. Oh my, it was heaven. A portion of the sales from this dessert goes to Cystic Fibrosis Foundation so eat up folks!"
Doug J.,"Laurel, DE",0,1,,2.0,3/21/2016,"More I go, the more I get disappointed. Beers good, service has been good, too pricy for what you get and expect. Rib app, literally a oz of meat total, their Hamburg is a qtr pounder for 10$ Hidden in bun made for a NY deli sandwich. Rewards program is just dumb, they don't allow anything but the food for points."
Francis S.,"Frederick, MD",6,65,13,1.0,8/9/2014,"So as you know I will just put it out there as I see it. This place opened and I waited until they had a month to get it right. Well I have been once a week since and I can say it's not because the food is overwhelming, or the atmosphere although they are ok. What keeps us going back are a few good dishes, some decent adult beverages, the sports them, but the biggest reason is the Server we found is a diamond in this coal mine of a restaurant. Yes the server and a couple of dishes will keep me as a regular. However this place lacks a lot of things.  1) For starters the management staff - is un-attentive and avoids conflict at all cost. Many times we have had an issue with a dish or something from the kitchen. And most of the time the manager never stopped by the table. The GM is what I like to call ""Decorative"" meaning they are there from 9am to 5pm and out the door just to do the bare minimum. The rest of the managers including the GM do no table touches to check on the guests. Also I have to say ""From my own experience"" the GM is not to be trusted. She has told many untruths and I have lost all respect and confidence in this so-called management staff.  2) The kitchen - this can be a hit or miss process. The chicken dishes are your safe bet and a few apps are ok. Forget the salads and some times the fish is over cooked. They do burn things as roasted veg should never be black and look like lumps of coal. Pizza is a bust. Get to a local pizza shop if you want pizza but not here.  3) The Servers - I can count on one hand (right or left you choose) the number of good servers and on 1/2 of a hand the number of excellent servers. But it takes all my fingers and toes and yours to start with how many poor or just out and out bad servers there are. Again management allows them to run amuck and holds none of them accountable. When the poor servers start complaining that the good and excellent servers have a loyal following and only want to sit in their sections as unfair you know it's not good. So when management fails to manage and weed out the poor performing staff but instead causes issues for the other servers there is a problem. I have a favorite server and we have become friends as a family with this person. I request to sit in their section and will wait to get a table there. But because the whining others the GM will force us and others to sit where the service is going to be crap. And to top it off will lie to your face as to why you can't sit with the server you want. You know I ran many restaurants and I never refused a guests request to sit in a requested servers section. I made every effort to make it happen unless the server was off or getting off of a shift. But never did I lie as this GM and management staff have done.  4) The Bar - You gotta catch the right bartender or your basic mixed drink or house special will be screwed up. The beer selection is good for a on-site brew and the homemade sodas are good as well and refills on the sodas are an excellent value. But again hit or miss at times with the bar.  Over all this rating I gave BJ's is largely due to management and some food issues. I know if new management came in and cleaned out the poor performers this could be a rock solid eatery."
Marie F.,"Gaithersburg, MD",14,8,,2.0,2/22/2015,Food is great but service is less than desired. I did the call ahead service because I have kids and to wait once I get there is not fun. Well once I got there I still had to wait an additional 30 minutes. To me that defeats the whole purpose of calling ahead.
Marti F.,"Frederick, MD",19,1,,4.0,3/1/2016,"The glazed salmon was sublime. I personally recommend this restaurant to anyone and everyone. The server was always able to take care of the needs we had, and answered our questions we had about the food."
Chinita A.,"Washington, DC",39,136,,3.0,10/26/2014,This place isn't that bad. A friend celebrated her birthday going to this place blindly as did I. It was a boss recommendation and well I had to go where the birthday lady wanted to go. Food was ok. Nothing special from any other chain restaurant. My first drink from the menu was too sugary. I ended up creating my own.  Dessert was yummy. I do not frequent Frederick so let's say it's doubtful I will be back.
J J.,"Frederick, MD",0,12,2,2.0,1/4/2015,"Totally agree with some reviews...I am sitting here trying to decide where to take my friends to go watch the playoff games today (and easily spend $500+) and although BJs is definitely the closest with the best set up for a game, I am tired of wasting my time driving over just to find out they split what could be a great big screen into 4 small ones (totally defeating the purpose of a big screen) and refuse to turn the sound on, turning what could be a great football viewing ambiance into one of the worst places to go for football! Great job management! Way to run a bar into the ground!"
Karan D.,"Frederick, MD",0,1,,4.0,2/6/2016,We sat at the bar and Brie was fabulous!  Lots of really great craft beers and you should try the pazookis...delicious!
Salalao L.,"Hagerstown, MD",7,26,62,2.0,6/22/2014,"We order a bunch of appetizer. The sampler appetizer is your standard flare nothing to brag about similar to any chains restaurant like TGIF. The ahi poke taste a little gummy and the crispy wanton doesn't taste or feel like a wanton skin it taste like very bland rice cracker.  The shrimp wraps were ok you can taste all the ingredients listed on the menu minus the shrimp is not fresh. It taste like frozen pre cooked shrimp very gummy. We finally got our entrees my burger and fries were cold once the fries are cold especially is thinly slices they are no good. It taste like shredded cardboard, I liked my fries hot and crispy. I had better burger the fried jalapeño is heavily coated with batter very soggy and greasy not spicy at all.  I don't taste the chipotle sauce or baja sauce, the lettuce and tomato were all wilted. Over all It was big messy plain cold burger. I would only go back to BJ for their crafted beers nothing else."
Bryan Y.,"Sykesville, MD",0,9,,5.0,1/31/2016,"Fabulous!   Yes it took one hour to get seated in a crowded waiting area but it was Saturday night so expected.   The bar was open so technically you could easily start drinking while you wait  ...    The food was on-point.   Hot, well cooked, and a ton of menu & alcohol choices.   Nice portion size for sharing.   The waitress was awesome!    The reviews on here have some truth but ALL of the food complaints could have been easily straightened out by telling the server or manager, no big deal.    Give this place a try.  Its a great casual, warehouse-y experience after shopping or just a spot where you can relax in jeans and down beers.   Better than the Applebee, Greene Turtles, Ruby Tuesday, etc .... chains, in my opinion."
Robert L.,"Walkersville, MD",0,4,5,2.0,7/26/2014,"It was our second time at BJ half an hour ago. The service was super slow with a total of three different people waiting on us. My husband ordered a burger and it was cold, dry, and not even half a pound! I ordered Hawaiian mahi mahi, supposedly with spicy soy ginger sauce, and the flavor was bland. There was no ginger at all! We also ordered the tomato mozzarella and the tomatoes where anemic. BJ's food are not worth the price they are charging.  On our first visit, the bison burger was as dry as leather.  The kids liked the root beer but we will never go back there again."
Jim R.,"Frederick, MD",1,24,44,3.0,12/9/2015,"Great burgers! Very possibly the best hamburger choices in the entire region! They've got one of the largest menus I've ever seen. The thing could become a lethal weapon in the event of a barroom brawl! The food is definitely above average. Lots and lots of choices. If you're dieting, you may want to avoid this establishment. As for the atmosphere ... Well, it's more akin to a military mess hall than a fine dining restaurant. A lot of noisy people noisily eating and sloshing suds. Nice bar appropriately separated from most of the eatery seating. And, of course, it's equipped with the obligatory sports television sets. I'm not particularly crazy about the steaks. Tried the ribeye. A bit tough. Same for the strip steak. Hey, this ain't Ruth's Chris, for cryin' out loud. Ruth's specializes in USDA prime. You'll get USDA choice here. A lesser cut, to be sure. But what the heck. You get what you pay for in this world."
Laura F.,"Charles Town, WV",0,1,,1.0,1/27/2015,"This restaurant was a huge disappointment. It was beautiful inside as far as looks go, but that's about as good as it got. Our waitress took forever to get to the table. 7 Mins is way too long, keep in mind we have a small child with us, too,  to even be acknowledged when there are 4 tables in the whole place, most of which were eating. When she finally got to the table, she had a nasty attitude. We felt very rushed. We ordered our drinks, after another 10 mins, they arrived.  We finally made our food selections, bad idea. I ordered the Mediterranean Chicken Tacos, my husband ordered a simple bacon cheeseburger with the thick fries, and my son ordered the corn dogs with carrots. When our food came, the pasta medley that comes with the tacos tasted like some sort of medicine. It has a chemical taste to it. The tacos were bland and had zero flavor. I noticed my husband had stopped eating halfway through his burger and asked him what was wrong, he said it tasted funny. The bacon looked like a dog treat and the burger looked like meatloaf. The sandwich had sat too long under the food warmer and was hard as a rock. Our waitress came back long enough for me to order rice instead of the nasty pasta that came with it. She huffed off with the pasta and said that it would be a few minutes for the rice.... it was 15 and i was already finished my meal by that point. We asked for a manager and he honestly seemed like he couldn't have cared less about our table or the issues we were having. After a long drawn out conversation, he took my husbands food off of our check and had our waitress drop it off. Magically, her attitude perked up when check time came. She still didn't get that great of a tip.Probably one of the WORST places i have ever been in my life."
Mb C.,"Kensington, MD",0,4,,4.0,11/13/2014,"Loved the bartender (very nice and personable).  The appetizer calamari was overcooked.  Otherwise the wings, the beer and the BLT side salad were spectacular.  Its a beautiful well maintained very ornate and lovely place for a date night."
Jani M.,"Salinas, CA",0,2,2,1.0,6/29/2014,I have no complaints regarding the food.  Complaints:  Service!!  Is that what you call it?  To be honest if the waitresses and waiters had left the back wall I think the building would have tumbled in.  Now honestly I don't like to raise my voice but I had to yell at one of the servers to please come and assist me.  They sent out a steak with a butter knife.  After verbally tackling the server I requested a steak knife. Will I return?  Probably not.  Good Luck!
Chelsea R.,"Frederick, MD",45,49,14,2.0,8/14/2014,"Every time I have been here, the service has been sub-par, but I waited to give them a chance to settle in before I gave a bad review. Last night was my fourth visit to BJ's, and likely my last.  I came for dinner and had about a 5 minute wait at 7 pm. Not bad for the dinner rush, I have to say. Then we were seated and the waiter, who must have been new, came over to greet us. We ordered our drinks, and the beer took over 15 minutes to arrive at the table. We ordered our food:calamari as an app, a small pizza for me, and jambalaya for the person with me. 20 minutes later, the pizza shows up. (We have no utensils at this point either. Every time I have been here I have had to ask for silverware.) We asked about the calamari,  and he tells us he ""must not have caught that"". 10 minutes later, I am eating very awkwardly so that my pizza doesn't get cold...and he brings the calamari (which was VERY greasy and cold). We had to ask about the jambalaya, which he had to search for, and had apparently forgotten to put in as well because he didn't have any idea where it could be. We finally got the jambalaya after I was completely finished eating. It was a lousy experience to say the least.  Even though I love the food, I don't want to beg them to bring it to my table. BJ's is not the place for me."
Clifton P.,"Reston, VA",3,20,16,2.0,4/29/2014,"Great crowd, service, bar and atmosphere.   I love burgers, but only have them with bread once a week, generally on Saturdays.   My food was okay.  It was hot, but not tasty.  The bun was dry to the point of being chalky and the patty was too charred to much to express a beef flavor.   The only flavor I had was char."
