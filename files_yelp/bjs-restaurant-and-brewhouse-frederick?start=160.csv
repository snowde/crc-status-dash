Lisa B.,"Pompano Beach, FL",66,5,1,1.0,9/15/2015,"So it started with the conversation of let's grab some to go and bring it back to the hotel because we didn't want to sit in a restaurant for an hour. We go online and order a chicken tortilla soup and blackened Cajun pasta. At 6:55 it says your order will be ready at 7:45. Wow. Okay. So we go up there early thinking it might come sooner than an hour. We get there and sit at the bar and have a drink. We tell the hostest who we are and where we'll be. She comes up a couples of minutes later saying that the online order system doesn't show up until it's closer to when our food should arrive. So we tell her our order. We wait a full hour. She never stops by and is nowhere to be found. When it comes out I only see the soup and ask where is everything else and she says it's already inside the soup. So all of the avocado and tortilla strips and cheese are sitting in hot soup. Brilliant. I tell her that it's not right and should be on the side. She goes back and the bartender agrees that it was just put together wrong. No exaggeration a full ten more minutes later she saunters out with an ""I don't give an eff"" attitude. We take it and leave. Get back to the hotel and my husband's meal is completely wrong. They didn't even put the chicken on the pasta. The soup tastes like she just used the soggy tortilla soup and put more stuff on the side. Come on people! It's pasta and a pre-made soup!!!  I have never in my life written a bad review about anything but this visit sent me over the edge. What a waste of money. Hey BJs, I'd like my $21.68, back for the waste!!"
Nate H.,"Aberdeen, MD",6,13,,2.0,2/9/2014,"Host staff refused to honor a call-in place on the wait list. Floor was dangerously slippery. Food was average at best. Although claiming to be a brew pub, bar staff was oblivious to the proper service and temperature for different beers. The beer may have been good, I'll never know because it was served at the tongue-numbing icy temps used to help you swill American beer. Cannot recommend."
Carol P.,"Leesburg, VA",0,57,,1.0,8/1/2015,"Very disappointed this time. Got there asked for Heather and she was starting later. We were 5 total including baby, we got sat in a small table so we asked for a bigger table instead, well I guess we weren't suppose to ask that. We then got Bryan as our waiter, completely the opposite from Heather. He was careless and just blah. We ordered calamari (always do) and it was dark brown (burnt), it was CRISPY. We sent it back and he didn't even care or said a word about it."
Diemai N.,"Frederick, MD",146,16,64,1.0,2/24/2014,I had to give this restaurant one star because zero stars was not an option. My food was good ... my server? Terrible.
Vince W.,"BUNKER HILL, WV",4,5,1,3.0,7/5/2014,"I gave 3 stars as our experience wasn't bad but could have been better. It was our first time here and I well say our waitress seemed a bit overworked. The service was very very slow. The food was ok. ..I had the bacon cheeseburger. I ordered med well but it came out well add pretty dry. It was supposed to be a half pound burger but did not seem like it. Good brioche style bun but the burger was just to small for the bun. Definitely not worth the 10 buck price. Wife had the bone in New York strip and she said it was very good.  We will try Bj's again at some point when we are back in the area, it's a very visually appealing place and overall we enjoyed it."
Robert T.,"Frederick, MD",30,23,1,1.0,2/8/2014,"Never made it past the incompetent reception staff. Called ahead, checked in and waited an hour. Checked in a second time, continued to wait. Then they gave our table away to another party of five. No restaurant is worth that kind of aggravation, new or not."
Anthony T.,"Frederick, MD",0,8,,1.0,1/2/2014,"Food is okay but the service is consistently horrible. We have been there and picked up take out over a dozen times hoping it would get better and it has only gotten worse. Every time we get takeout the order is wrong and every time we eat in they get the order wrong. Last time I went they forgot the bun on my mothers burger. We told the server and she said she was horrified and went to get a manager. We never saw a manager and our server didn't come back for 20 minutes. They forgot the dressing for our salads got the unsweetened iced tea wrong and brought us the wrong beer. We are done, there are too many good locally owned restaurants to spend my money in."
J P.,"Ashburn, VA",0,14,,2.0,6/4/2016,"Previous to this I would have given BJs 4 stars. I've only been in there on Sunday afternoons and the service has been great. I mean I was in there one time came back almost a month later and the bartender remembered what I drank. I've had the deep dish pizza, and while it's not Chicago good (I'm from the Chicago suburbs) it actually is decent. The beer is good, although I have only had the Hefe. The 2 stars is for my experience today. Got my beer and a menu and waited and waited and waited... waited over a half hour to order. Bartender and 2 managers walked by me, with my menu sitting on the bar in front of me and not one of them asked if I'd like to order. It wasn't until my beer wad gone that I was asked if I wanted another beer... still no asking if I'd like to order. I asked if I could order food. ""Oh, yeah"". Some of the worst service I've ever had. The bartenders that came in later were much better. So, while the food and beer is good, the service apparently is hit or miss, which lowers it from 4 to 2 stars. Seriously, 30 minutes with a bartender and 2 managers walking by me numerous times with no service is unacceptable."
Katie G.,"New Market, MD",3,15,10,4.0,2/25/2014,Great food. I ordered the avocado egg rolls and the tuna salad. They were both very good! They have good happy hour prices as well.
Erika S.,"Frederick, MD",4,26,33,4.0,4/30/2014,"Sat at the bar, had great service. Made it just in time for happy hour. Calamari was ok, burger was amazing!!"
Lauren K.,"Germantown, MD",2,25,3,1.0,1/25/2015,Food lacked flavor. Potato skins were disgusting. Pizza tasted like something from the freezer section at Giant with triple the price tag. Dredging on my chicken had much too much egg. It was like egg covered chicken. Awful.
Bob F.,"Frederick, MD",44,16,1,4.0,2/2/2014,"BJs has great  food.  Every time I have been there for  dinner I have been completely satisfied, and they are good about substitutions and such.  I have never been there on a game day but it seems like it would be a fun place to see a game.The waitress lauren was great ask for her. the only down side is the hostess they seem to think that at their level they run the place a good attitude adjustment would make this a 5 plus"
Jason L.,"Frederick, MD",4,22,15,3.0,5/13/2014,"Food was decent. Your typically chain/franchise type menu. I had their staple burger with seasoned fries. I also ordered a flatbread pizza, which was actually pretty good. The service wasn't great. Waiter was lost for long periods of time. I probably wouldn't return, unless my other options were exhausted."
Janeka H.,"Pineville, NC",60,108,163,3.0,3/30/2014,"The corn fritter was amazing.  However, the pizza was just okay.  If given the choice between pizza hut and BJ's for a pepperoni pizza... Then Pizza Hut would win."
Colleen F.,"Urbana, MD",1,56,6,3.0,1/26/2014,"I really want to like this restaurant.  I've been here a handful of times and the food is good and the lunch prices are decent. However, the food has been incredibly slow coming out of the kitchen the last few times we've visited.  They also seem to be running out of items on the menu, one example being French fries.   As much as my kids love coming for the pizookies, we just haven't been back because it's not worth the effort to entertain my children for so long."
Bobbi G.,"Frederick, MD",0,3,,2.0,2/5/2014,Went to BJs for dinner on a week night.  The service was slow and the food was nothing special.  I ordered the Cobb Salad and was disappointed.  Just a lot of  iceberg lettuce with a little bacon and scant tomatoes.  It did have 1/2 avocado on top but that couldn't save it.  For the price is was a fail and I'll never go back.
Biggins C.,"Westminster, MD",0,9,28,5.0,1/26/2014,"Awesome place. Wife remembered seeing it but didn't know what it was, glad we went up. Super busy. Southwest eggrolls Corn fritters Side salad, Bison burger....me French dip... wife Handtossed ultimate pepperoni.....son Don't know what it was called but the three ice cream dessert rocked. Waitress....Stephanie? ..bar side was great Jeremiah Red---- Irish Ale..... awesome Porter--- was like a chocolate beer....super sweet and foamy Going again as soon as we can"
Joe D.,"South Brunswick Township, NJ",0,3,,1.0,8/27/2015,"Extremely disappointed. Draught choices were missing and the kitchen was confused if they were out of ribs or not. Eventually they served ribs that were way overcooked and barely edible. To top the evening off, three hours later, two diners within our party who ate the ribs became ill. Needless to say, never going back."
Michele H.,"New Market, MD",54,21,52,4.0,1/10/2014,"Enjoyed dinner last night with my husband and in-laws. It was crowded for a Thursday, but we did not have to wait long for a table. Our server was very friendly and knowledgable. Service was fairly quick considering how busy it was. The potato skins were a good choice for four people as an appetizer. They give you a lot! The pasta dishes are amazing. I love the Cajun chicken and my mother-in-law had the Scampi. My husband enjoyed the spicy Jambalaya, while his dad loved the ribeye. Our only complaint was the music is pretty loud. Like being in a night club! Other than that, we will definitely be back"
Ivo P.,"Frederick, MD",0,6,,3.0,8/14/2015,Let me start with this: service was immaculate. BJ is very clean and well organized. On the contrary the meal was dicent at best . My food was semi cold. Beers selection is OK.
