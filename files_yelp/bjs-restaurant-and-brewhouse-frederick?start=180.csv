Skylar L.,"Middletown, MD",0,15,,5.0,8/10/2015,"I really don't understand why this restaurant has such low reviews. I have been there at least 10 times since they've opened and I have great experiences every time. I will admit sometimes the kitchen has some issues but the staff and management always makes up for it.  My most recent visit was last week and I went out with a few of my friends from work. I ordered the new chicken and spinach quinoa meal and everything about it was great. I also had one of their seasonal watermelon mojitos-ugh, so tasty. My friends shared a deep dish pizza and enjoyed a couple local beers they offer and were also very pleased. Our waitress was Mahala? She was very knowledgeable about the menu/beer menu and very friendly but not overbearing. She gave great recommendations and I chose 2 of them. My family also enjoys coming to BJS at least once a month if not more. They have such a huge menu selection-something for everyone and when you go you must try the pazookie dessert!!! My fav is the salted Caramel-2 scoops of vanilla ice cream and caramel drizzle. It's too die for!!!"
Adele A.,"Frederick, MD",0,9,,3.0,1/17/2014,"I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars. I went to BJs for lunch with a coworker last week. CONS:it took (no exaggeration) 20 minutes for a server to come over to our table. And after he took our drink order he said we weren't his table and our server would be over shortly. Ten minutes later he came back with our drinks (we never saw the person who was supposed to be our server). The tables are awkwardly close together and we were seated right next to a four top. The menu is pretty expensive. I ordered a salad that was $15. Granted it had salmon on it and it was delicious, but I'm not sure how often I'd like to spend $15 on lunch.  PROS: immediately upon walking in, you are in awe of the building. High ceilings, a beautiful bar, lots of space and TVs. The food is very good and the selections are bountiful. They make their own soda which seems to be a big hit there (I didn't try it).  BJ's is a chain. They market themselves as a Cheesecake Factory type restaurant but specializing in deep dish pizza and beer instead of cheesecake. Their beer prices aren't that great (happy hour drafts are $4... I don't want to know how much they are regularly). Overall, this place is good but seems a little out of place in Frederick (especially on Spectrum Dr.). I'll probably give it another shot at some point."
See D.,"Frederick, MD",1,26,4,3.0,12/15/2014,"Overall, the food is decent, and there is a decent selection of beer on tap / in bottles.  Employees are for the most part very attentive.  Food and drinks always make it out in a timely fashion.  One thing I can't wrap my head around is why you refuse to turn the sound on for an NFL night game?  I know it isn't a sports bar, but the set up is fantastic for a game given the seating, and the placement of your billion inch TV screen.   You are without question doing yourself a disservice by splitting the screen into 4 smaller screens with no sound for a Monday night game.  That will deter a lot of people from coming to your establishment.  Take me for example.  I walked in last night, asked if the sound was going to be on, and was told no before I could finish my question.  I spent 100 bucks across the street.  I'm not saying you should turn into  a BWW or anything, but the sound for a Monday / Thursday night game should be doable.  To boot, you would make more money!"
Jarred N.,"Frederick, MD",7,8,,5.0,5/22/2014,"Solid place, food is great.  Their beer selection is very good.  Also have a good menu for kids.  For the price, I recommend!"
B W.,"Frederick, MD",0,1,,5.0,5/17/2015,"Had the crispy calamari and the New York Strip bone-in which was exceptional. I sat at the bar and the service was absolutely excellent. Ryan was my bartender and he never let my glass go empty and he was incitful, suggesting the beers he enjoyed and the best entrees (read: friendly). Michelle was the other bartender and she was super nice and personable. Corporate ownership and good staff has its perks."
Michelle A.,"Richmond, VA",1,17,35,3.0,3/16/2014,"This is a sports-bar version of the cheesecake factory, replacing cheesecake with beer. Huge portions, a huge menu, prices are reasonable. I liked that they had potato skins on the menu (a forgotten treasure it seems at most restaurants these days) and for $10 the appetizer easily fed four adults and one child.   I got a burger, which seemed fresh and handmade.  It was quite tasty.   Our service was fast and friendly if slightly forgetful... And really the only complaint I have is the desserts- named pizzokies.  This seems wrong to me.  They are warmed cookies from what I can tell, and the salted caramel one was really good.  But on principal I just can't get over the dumb name.  I felt stupid ordering it, which is never a good thing. Four adults got meals, plus an appetizer and dessert, plus three beers and a kids meal, for around $80.  Not too shabby.   I'm not sure we'd go back, but it wasn't a bad place and by the time we were leaving aT seven on a thurs night it was jam packed..."
Jesse J.,"Frederick, MD",6,29,10,5.0,2/15/2015,"This place is an absolute delight to dine at!! I went for lunch with my fiancé's family and it was wonderful!!! The service was excellent and the food was delicious! So many options too!! I could barly decide on what to get, it all looked amazing!! Family was paying so I didn't get to see the price for all 4 of us, but I don't think it was that expensive, but if it was it was worth every penny!! I did feel under dressed tho when I went there, next time I'll wear something nicer!"
K G.,"Urbana, MD",0,43,32,5.0,12/1/2013,"They just opened this branch few weeks ago. They were offering free food for about a week. Excellent service. The staff were all well trained, polite, and friendly. The restaurant was crowded with customers, but we still got fast and professional service. The food was excellent. I can't say anything bad about it. We had calamary for an appetizer. It was flavourful, hot, and taisty. I ordered chicken sandwich and my husband had a burger. They were both taisty, hot, and juicy. The presentation was eye catching. The portion size was great for the value. Steve made an excellent recommendation for our drinks. Very knowledgable about the menu and very polite. I highly recomment u to try this location."
Erika M.,"Rockville, MD",2,38,1,4.0,3/24/2014,"I have only been here once but I will be back for sure.  The food was delicious and the beer was A-MAZ-ING.  Our waitress was friendly and efficient.  The ambiance of the place is lougesque (and really clean) with low lighting, buzz of conversation, and an excited feel."
Scott M.,"Frederick, MD",12,7,,1.0,5/22/2015,Everything at the table came cold and not very good. Very pricey for the lack of quality. Even the drinks were flat.
Ca D.,"Frederick, MD",0,10,,2.0,2/28/2014,Loved the atmosphere and beer. The service was ok. The kicker was that they ran out of TWO dishes that I wanted which was annoying.  My fiancé liked his burger and it was huge. I haven't decided if I'll be back or not.
Steve P.,"Williamsport, MD",0,3,,1.0,4/26/2015,The food came out very slow. The tea was like water. The waiter was nice but couldn't keep up with the volume of the restaurant. He seemed like a veteran but still wasn't able to keep the kitchen pumping out his orders. Maybe not his fault but guess what..... not mine either.   There were 7 of us and they weren't able to accommodate is all at a table. I sat in a chair at the end of a 6 person booth. This was uncomfortable.  I asked for a burger medium rare and it was well done. There was sausage in the lasagna we ordered when we clearly asked for a vegetarian meal. He apologized for like the fourth time. Lots of apologies from the waiter. All four burgers were cold. The shrimp scampi pasta had almost no sauce or flavor.  There were TVs showing sports but the one by my table had the news on. I couldn't tell what was being said so I didn't watch. There was lots of noise. These arson the booth were cracked and torn.  I'm not coming back. I spent $146 for a $40 dining experience.
Laura R.,"Frederick, MD",0,3,,4.0,4/11/2014,"We went on a weeknight and called ahead so we didn't have to wait at the restaurant. The atmosphere was nice--I didn't feel like I was in a cheesy chain restaurant. Our waiter was friendly and on the ball. We ordered the corn fritters and santa fe spring rolls. Both were great but the corn fritters were AWESOME! Highly recommend those. My husband ordered the jalapeño burger and didn't like the way it was cooked (the outer rim was VERY charred), but the flavor was good--not as spicy as you'd think, but still good. I had the double deluxe burger and it was delicious! We split a chocolate chunk pizookie and I had a surprisingly fantastic cup of coffee. I would go back just for coffee and dessert! Definitely try the corn fritters and a pizookie."
Betty A.,"Gaithersburg, MD",0,1,,2.0,1/16/2014,"We were a group of 12 for a business lunch and called ahead for a reservation. It was the first time dining here for all of us. However the waiter dropped a full glass of iced tea behind me & my coworker which splashed our coats  & partially our clothes. They came by to clean up floor fairly quickly - we were given a few extra napkins by the waiter who said he was sorry.  I get that he may have been embarrassed, but it was really treated as a nonevent.  And we did not make any kind of scene.  We're quite sure the staff did not tell the manager. Unfortunately this, along with a few other minor mix ups with our orders, didn't leave an overall great impression. Food was good and fair value for the prices.  Nice decor and not too loud. All in all, consensus was would go back and maybe try their brews after work. And hope they step up their customer service a bit.  A new restaurant generally has more attentive managers and enthusiastic hostesses to ensure future visits."
Stephanie H.,"Frederick, MD",7,68,,4.0,12/11/2014,"The drinks are over priced, $9.75 for a long island, I can go down the street for 2 for the same price. However, the food was good and the pizza at the table next to us looked great. This was my first time in here but I will be back, the service was great and the place was nice and clean. Plenty of TV's in the bar area if you want to catch a game."
Kaelin B.,"Frederick, MD",0,12,1,2.0,2/26/2015,"We came on a Sunday night and were told there would be a 30 minutes wait for a table. Since it was a little crowded we were ok with that and got drinks at the bar while we waited. After about 45 minutes we still hadn't been seated so we asked the hostesses if we had accidentally been skipped. They said ""Oh sorry it was really a 30-40 minute wait. It should be just another 2 or 3 minutes."" .....oooookay it had already been more than 40.... It was another 15 minutes before we were finally shown to our table. Things didn't get better though..... We sat for about 10-15 minutes with server after server walking past our table and no one came to greet us. We finally tried waving a server over and she looked right at us and kept walking.... Nice. We were finally able to get the attention of another server and we placed our order. The food was extremely mediocre and the bar tender didn't even know how to make a bay breeze.... I was brought a sea breeze instead.... Pretty pathetic and I will not be coming back."
Justa D.,"Frederick, MD",0,57,,2.0,2/15/2015,I will start off by saying we have been here only once so we may go back to see if its better.  The service is ok at best an the food is average at best.  The price for what you get is not good.
Alexander R.,"Mount Airy, MD",103,41,11,5.0,8/27/2014,"Awesome atmosphere, a little loud for my liking though. Beer selection was good and my burger was fabulous. Pretty competitive price, would choose over Red Robin in a heartbeat."
Liz B.,"Frederick, MD",41,4,,4.0,1/10/2014,"Tried BJ's after Christmas shopping. Seated promptly and our orders were delicious. Moroccan salmon was particularly good. We ordered a cream soda and received an orange one. Took a few minutes to find the waiter and receive the right order. Overall, good and we'd like to come back and try some other dishes."
Sam P.,"Bethesda, MD",0,17,,4.0,12/3/2014,"The main reason to visit BJ's is for the beer selection but the food is a good second reason. I've never had bad food at BJ's -- I tried their fish and chips because so many people raved over them but I realized I'm not a fish and chips person. The fish and chips were cooked fine, tasted fine, just not my thing. Every other food item I've ordered at BJ's has been good. The beer selection is a really nice plus. Oddly, everyone likes the pizza but I've yet to have pizza from BJ's. Service is generally fast and accurate -- during really busy times I have to give a restaurant a little leeway in dealing with crowds and BJ's does that well."
