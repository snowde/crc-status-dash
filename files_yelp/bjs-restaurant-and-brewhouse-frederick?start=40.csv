Lauren T.,"Frederick, MD",58,11,16,5.0,1/15/2017,"Every time we go to BJs we take new people with us. Everyone has always been delighted by the enormous menu! The food comes out hot, and the presentation is nice. I usually order chicken when I go out to eat, but this restaurant's menu has so many options I don't think I've had the same thing twice. We never wait long no matter how packed it looks. The sandwiches are filling, the pizza is really great! I could go on and on! Nice wait staff, and hostesses. Highly recommend! This place will be a regular for us because you can't get bored with a large menu!"
Rene R.,"Baltimore, MD",19,177,,4.0,4/11/2016,"My first time to BJ's after hearing multiple people rave about how great the food is. But not the greatest reviews on here. So I went in not totally sure what to expect. I always check the bathrooms even if I don't need to go. However in this instance I went twice- this one was clean and it was restocked and swept during my visit. That's something I appreciate in a restaurant. It was Sunday afternoon and it was busy but not packed. I can't remember our server's name but he was great. He was attentive without visiting our table too often. And he gave great recommendations. Drinks - Made in house Root Beer and Cream Soda. And my favorite - Strawberry Lemonade! So delicious. (and unlimited refills!) Food - We started with the Root Beer Rib - yummy.And then we each had a salad. I loved that I was able to make a few changes and additions without it being a big deal. Mom had the fish tacos - she loved them. Husband had the Brisket, bacon, burger and wedge fries - More love. And I had the deep dish 5 meat pizza. I just (30 min ago) had the 2nd half for lunch - it warmed up beautifully on my pizza stone and that makes it worthy of 5 stars alone! Pizza does not always reheat well. Why did I have half my pizza left over? Well that's easy, I wanted to save room for the Pizookie mini's! We had the Cookies n Cream, Triple Chocolate and the  new Monkey Bread Pizookie Mini's as a trio. I would happily have had the dessert first! They were SO good. We won't be back often as there is one quite a bit closer to us but we will be trying the one in Laurel to see if it's as good."
Maddy S.,"Clarksburg, MD",0,3,,1.0,6/30/2017,"We had reservations here for a large party on May 20th.  We had to wait over an hour to be seated.    The service was horrible, the waitress messed up our order, she never checked on us, and we never received any water for the table.  The manager was rude and never apologized for the inconvenience.    Never coming here again, Next time I'll be driving to the  Tysons location."
Ron M.,"Point of Rocks, MD",1,6,,2.0,6/14/2017,"We used to enjoy this restaurant...our visit tonight was just so so. As soon as you enter the place you can smell that ""not very clean smell"". The floors were dirty (felt greasy) and the bar stools were sticky as was the bartop. Service was good and the server was friendly. Food was nothing to write home about."
Eric C.,"Goshen, NY",4,33,35,5.0,3/25/2016,Delicious. 100%. Our servers were Emily T and Jessica K. Jessica was my cousin. Delicious! Definitely come here!
Will F.,"Frederick, MD",3,15,,4.0,11/25/2016,"BJ's can be very hit or miss. The food is usually pretty good, but it depends on what you get. The pizza's good and, honestly, you probably won't go wrong with any of their other dishes. If they're busy, though, be prepared for some wait time - not only in getting a table, but with your food and refills, etc."
mark s.,"Frederick, MD",2,57,5,4.0,2/28/2016,"Ate here in a Sunday at noon.  After sitting  down checked yelp and was slightly concerned based on the reviews. But we were very happy.   The waitress was very good, the service efficient. All three entrees were good to excellent.  I had chicken club, others had a burger (excellent) and the last had a kale salad which she also loved. Good atmosphere not too loud and tables spaced nicely.  Recommend especially for a ""chain""."
Bill G.,"Cresaptown, MD",2,23,11,4.0,4/4/2016,"The good: the food is great here- ribs, steak, chicken, pasta, pizza, sandwiches. My wife had the avocado egg rolls  and I had the root beer ribs for appetizers. Both were fan effin tastic. The ribs are sticky finger lickin awesomeness. The avocado rolls were creamy and unlike anything we've tried before. For entrées she ordered the Mediterranean pizza. A mix of pesto, tomatoes and olives with feta and onions. Great filler. I had the chicken bacon Mac and cheese which was very filling. The awesome: the beer here is fantastic. The lager is award winning. The Kolsch and the Irish ale is spot on. Not a fan of the Heffeweissin(too sweet- like banana bread) but the winner of the beer flight was the oasis red ale- just enough punch with no bitterness.  The bad: Frederick law prevents the beer leaving the building in a growler.  There are kid items, and they can accommodate large parties of up to twenty or do with advance notice.  After the bad aftertaste of Granite City ( just don't go there) this helped me redeem the brewpub genre and try to look for more.  C'mon Frederick... Get with the times..."
Chris G.,"Ranson, WV",37,29,57,5.0,2/27/2015,"Been here twice and both times it was very good. The Parmesan Crusted Chicken was very good. When a place says ""crusted"" it should have a little crunch. They don't over sauce it, over all good dish. The beer was very good, the Tatonka Stout was one of the best microbrew stouts I've had. The service was good, but I tend to eat late so not overly busy, but the staff seemed on top of things.  I also really like the atmosphere... Modern feel, clean, spacious.  I'll be going back, just to try a few more beers if nothing else."
Jakaila G.,"Gaithersburg, MD",0,10,18,5.0,4/19/2017,Great food and great people!  We loved it! Highly recommend of you're looking for some top notch food at a reasonable price!
Carissa J.,"Stevensville, MD",1,9,1,3.0,10/2/2016,"Went for lunch after a tour of Flying dog brewery, which was wonderful. Walked in and the hostess was less than welcoming. We were sat in a tiny booth, my husband being almost seven feet tall was very uncomfortable. Our waitress took almost ten minutes to come to our table and never introduced herself so I have no idea what her name was. Our appetizers were awesome but my sandwich came out cold and had to be remade. After almost 20 minutes of waiting for my small sandwich to come out my husband had finished his food and we were ready to leave. Three stars because the kitchen staff was wonderful and very accommodating but our waitress was awful and gave us an attitude because our meal had been comped."
Mike B.,"Frederick, MD",49,7,,2.0,6/16/2016,I've been here a few times and I also bartend and serve however no customer should sit and wait 15 minutes to be greated or to get a simple soda and water drink order. Finally Derek (a server) who didn't really seem like he was happy to be our server or be at work came to get our drink order then we are told he's leaving so we then got another server. This place is not very busy right now and im very unhappy so far. If the food takes too long to come out this will be our last tine here. Poor service is not a good way to start off the dinner.
Kat G.,"Potomac, MD",0,8,,1.0,6/11/2016,"This place used to be good but at time of writing (6-12-2016) it seems that things are going down the drain. Food is of much lower quality, we even found plastic mixed in with our salad!!!, service is extremely slow and mediocre in a nearly empty restaurant on a Friday at lunch.  Very disappointed.vI don't know what happened here but won't be back."
Cynthia L.,"Washington, DC",230,727,432,5.0,8/13/2014,"Hubs and just about everyone on the West Coast has told me how I need, must, HAVE to come here and try their pizooki's.  I guess I was kindof surprised when I realized they were a chain and happened to see this place while driving through.  Naturally, we had to stop and grab a pizooki. We sat at the bar (already had dinner) and order two beers, one locally brewed BJ's (I wanna say it's the summer berry brewed cider, which was so good, but that totally screams girly-spritzer-girl-who-doesn't-drink-beer)... but that local brew and one not (a Blue Moon).   Cookies and cream Pizooki's - It was everything everyone said it is: AMAZING.  A cold scoop of vanilla ice cream and a dollop of oreo whipped cream (never seen that) over a gooey hot brownie!  And as if we couldn't get more glutinous, our fabulous bartending waitress  mentioned how good the S'Mores pizooki was.  So it's safe to say we'll be back to try that AND the food next time.  Mission accomplished."
Merilee P.,"Germantown, MD",0,14,10,3.0,9/3/2016,"Slow service  Good beer We ordered mushrooms, salad and shrimp pene - not good lacking flavor and only 5 shrimps mainly pasta and my guest ordered ravioli - it was tough and ok. Beer s good we decided maybe a burger is better!"
Kendrick P.,"Columbia, MD",70,13,22,1.0,4/1/2016,"Okay let me give you the settings. 6 adults 2 kids. Thursday night (Ravens vs.Steelers tnf). One 29 year old looking to have a nice family birthday outing. We arrive at 7:45, we're seated, don't get noticed until 8. After that we order our drinks. Another 10 minutes pass. I look around and see a decently crowded restaurant nothing overflowing and no line at the door. 8:15 and we're looking for a waiter to take our order and bring us drinks. Eventually the first guy comes back and takes our order and brings half of our drinks. Appetizers come out at 8:45. One ""adult"" in our party ordered a milk, still no milk. 9 o' clock approaches half of the meals come out. 9:15 comes and everyone has their meal now, except for Tim. Tim is now missing his milk, and his meal. The Ravens vs Steelers game is on and the Ravens are up 7-3. Time passes and we're watching the game and chatting on about Joey's birthday and what not. 9:30 Tim has no meal and the waiter hasn't revisited the table yet. The group starts to feel bad as some of us are half way through our meals or further. We flag down another waitress and ask her about his burger. (She actually becomes our waiter for a little bit.) She goes to kitchen and comes back stating ""the burger is on the grill it'll be out soon"". 9:45 Tim has no burger, and no milk. 10:00pm Tim has given up, doesn't want the burger, doesn't want his milk wants to pick up Mickey D's on the way home and sob. Some how we get a new waiter, from the other two, coming by and asking how we are doing. Again we restate Tim's burger hasn't come out. He claims ""the burger is on the grill it'll be out soon"". 10:20 The manager comes by and we mention the predicament. They immediately bring out a burger. Unfortunately, it's not the burger that he ordered, but Tim is starving at this point and would settle for garbage scraps. He eats the burger completely, restating that this is not what he ordered and that the burger is poorly made. The manager comes by, we express our concerns. At this point Tim is livid with the service he's received and claims he is never coming back to this BJ's. The manager takes over the table gives us our checks that we've been waiting on. Gives Tim a free meal and a $50 gift card. Tim attempts to decline the gift card because ""I never want to come to BJ's again"". The manager does a decent job handling the circumstance calming Tim down, not allowing any of the other waiters to interfere. Eventually Tim accepts the gift card, but gives it to the birthday boy because he refuses to step foot in this facility for the rest of his life.  Alright, let's take a step back from the overall experience and focus on Kendrick. I ordered a specialty pizza and wings. Pizza was very mediocre, wings were alright but not worth the price. I would say the service was shit. Food is overpriced. But really I just felt bad for Tim. Don't visit here unless you want some Comcast quality customer service and food you'll regret eating."
Wes B.,"Frederick, MD",44,28,41,1.0,11/27/2015,"This place used to be the place to go for happy hour....Not anymore! $1 off draft beers and cocktails. Is that even worth putting on a menu? And $2 off share or apps and flatbreads which basically brings them down to the prize they should cost with how small they are. You have cut the discount for HH in half since opening. Great atmosphere with awesome service but the prices of happy hour will cause me to choose other places that can compete. For the record It was more of an angry hour than a happy hour. I had to send the dark brown ""avocado"" egg rolls back."
Michele C.,"Owings Mills, MD",49,182,394,3.0,9/22/2015,"Nice atmosphere, ok food. Ordered the store made soda , which we were told thats what they are known for, and was disappointed.  Dessert was amazing!!!"
J Michelle ..,"Los Angeles, CA",13,16,1,5.0,10/15/2015,"My friend and I wanted some pizza.  We were staying down the street at a hotel and wanted something quick.  He ordered the meatlovers pizza and I crated my own (mushrooms and sausage).  OMG!  This pizza was SOO good.  I was full and kept eating.  The crust was flakey yet not to hard, it had a sweet taste to it.  I was in love!   He ate 1/2 of his pizza and said is was really good.  Overall, I see they have a lot of bad reviews, but I had a great experience with this chain restaurant and wanted to share.  I would definitely go back again to get some pizza!"
DJ L.,"Gaithersburg, MD",15,55,248,2.0,7/7/2015,"Came here for lunch to catch-up with a friend and her daughters. We didn't get a chance to look at the menu and asked for a little more time. When our waiter came back, his comment was: ""Thanks for being so patient."" Not sure if that was suppose to be funny, but seemed a little snarky for a waiter. I'm sure the place is a nice place, but we didn't have a good experience. We ordered Asian Chopped salads and when the food came, they gave us a Dijon-like dressing when we should have gotten a honey-ginger dressing. My friend also noticed that some of the ingredients in the Asian salad was suppose to have grilled chicken breast, romaine, bibb lettuce, Napa cabbage, red bell peppers, snow peas, green onions, shredded carrots, sesame seeds, crisp wonton strips, cilantro and mandarin oranges. We only had chicken, lettuce, wonton strips, and mandarin oranges.  My friend's daughter ordered off the kids menu (garlic chicken pasta with broccoli). My friend wasn't expecting long noodles (for a kid to eat) and mentioned when she ordered it last time they came out with small, short spiral noodles. Sounds like reviews aren't consistent, so just be on the look out of what you order and hope for a nicer waiter."
