Sondra K.,"Harpers Ferry, WV",153,147,228,5.0,3/18/2016,"I love this place! I'm a regular, and have tried most everything on the menu.. It's all good. Top picks are the fish and chips, California chicken club and the chicken quinoa bowl. The pazookie dessert they have is yummy and the vanilla ice cream is also great. You can't go wrong with a waiter, they are all so friendly and very attentive. They have a loyalty program that will give you a free dessert, or 10 or 25 off a meal every now and then which is a nice surprise. Highly recommended this place!"
Kirsten W.,"Longmeadow, MA",26,17,2,2.0,7/7/2015,"Why go to a crappy chain restaurant with half decent beers when there are 2 local brew pubs in town, one of which is right across the street! They've ironed out a few service kinks since they opened, but it's still not great. The food is no better than Ruby Tuesday, Applebee's, or any other place serving prepackaged foods with fancy corporate decor. The only reason to go is the fact that they are open late."
Jerry V.,"Frederick, MD",1,20,7,4.0,8/1/2015,"Great restaurant and the food was good too! Our waitress, Heather, was a tremendous resource for this establishment. Her demeanor, engagement, forethought concerning our needs, and her smile were fabulous complements to our meal. I would encourage many folks to eat at this location. Great time had by all!"
Brady L.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,6,,1.0,7/18/2015,"Extremely disappointing. I came here with friends when they had just opened, or within a month and had a delicious meal. Pizza was outstanding, pot stickers and other apps on point. Good drinks.  Would have given it a 4 star. Last night, I was very excited to have another delicious meal and was starving. My friend and I ordered mozzarella sticks.  They were clearly frozen and heated up in a microwave or half-a** oven because they were still cold inside. The cheese they sprinkled on top didn't even melt....  the marinara sauce was cold. Seriously? If you're going to use frozen mozzarella sticks, at least do it right. Then, my main dish was the chicken with rice, black beans, feta cheese, and sauce.  Again, chicken was warm but the rice and beans were cold.  The cheese didn't even melt.   It was the worst restaurant meal I've had in a long time.  I don't know if management changed, but I definitely won't be back unless something is fixed in their kitchen. Staff was pleasant as usual, but I could never recommend BJ'S based off of the food last night."
Marie M.,"Middletown, MD",0,31,18,5.0,6/14/2015,"No complaints, only compliments. Even close to 10pm on a Saturday night, dinner was up to par and delicious. We did not feel rushed and our server took great care of us. For an appetizer we ordered the potato skins which are always delicious. I ordered the salmon with quinoa and it was very flavorful; would definitely order it again. My husband and I both ordered specialty drinks from the bar and they were made to perfection. Wildberry Mojito and Island Sunset...I'm craving one now. Why, oh why isn't this place PACKED on a Saturday night??"
Adam K.,"Baltimore, MD",83,283,441,3.0,3/15/2014,"This place was pretty solid on the casual sports bar vibe. A dozen or so homemade beers give one plenty to quaff with food. My friend and I got a sampler each to make sure we'd sampled a good portion of the brews. I was drawn to the bison burger and God love 'em, the waiters knew to recommend it cooked medium or medium rare so it doesn't get overcooked. I was not disappointed. A very juicy burger with skinny french fries (My companions are more potato wedge folks, but I opt for the typical boring fries over wedges). It was crowded and noisy, so not my ideal place to hang out with friends. I'm pretty sure it's the awesome beer that will bring me back."
Lea M.,"Rockville, MD",2,4,8,1.0,1/31/2015,"Waited 20 minutes for our order and then had to send a burger back because it was undercooked. It took another 15 minutes to get the burger back. This was after waiting 30 minutes to be seated; being asked if we needed a kid's menu because one of the adults in our party is on the short side; and having to ask for silverware, napkins, lemons, sweetener, and ice for the iced tea. But the waiter sure was quick to bring the check and run the credit card.  This was the worst experience, but previous experiences haven't been great either...undercooked pork, dry overcooked steak, and overcooked vegetables. Won't be returning."
Shelly A.,"Leesburg, VA",11,84,106,5.0,5/15/2016,"I have eaten here twice.  Both times were great!  Tonight I had the barbacoa chicken and it was amazing!  The lettuce wedge with blue cheese is also really good.  (I had it the last time and my daughter had it this time.)  We all enjoyed a beer, all three of us got a different one but all were BJ's brews.  The first time I ate here it was on a Sunday for lunch and today it was a Sunday for dinner.  We didn't have to wait for a table either time.  I am not sure why the reviews on here are so low.  I wish there was a BJ's in Loudoun County!"
Jack S.,"Lynchburg, VA",0,11,20,3.0,11/11/2016,"We came out for our Veteran's Day dinner. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive (in the beginning). We ordered two steaks that both came with asparagus. One of the steaks came out lovely cooked just right. The other came out over cooked and the asparagus looked like blades of charred grass. The sad thing was that we had a side-by-side comparison of the two steak dishes that should have been obvious to the staff. The other steak was served missing it's shrimp which took another 10 minutes to come out. They finally brought-out a new steak and asparagus of which was acceptable, but the steak was still over cooked. One of the entrees came with a free desert, but it ended-up a separate charge on the bill. The waitress eventually took it off but was very put-out by the fact we asked for the correction. The manager did comp the second overlooked steak meal. Oh, and I never did get that coffee I asked to go with my desert! Not a good way to treat those that BJ's claimed to honor, us Veterans."
Valerie M.,"Chambersburg, PA",0,8,,5.0,12/12/2016,Food is excellent and service was great. Bison burger was absolutely delicious. Love the atmosphere here as well.
Diane M.,"Gaithersburg, MD",0,11,,5.0,6/14/2016,"We have been to this BJs many times and have never had the experience that others have mentioned. Our service has always been good. However, we normally sit at the bar or one of the tables in the bar area so I don't know if that makes a difference.  Our last visit, Jason waited on us and was great. My husband got the jambalaya which i thought had great favor. Not real spicy but good. Had quite a bit of chicken and sausage.  I had the lemon thyme chicken. The broth/ sauce its in is light but good. It's enough to fill you without a lot of calories or fat. Their enlighten meals I really enjoy with the low calorie count. With both dishes, I wish there had been a nice piece of crusty bread to round it out.  They have a nice selection of their own beers plus a large selection of ""guest"" beers all on draft.  Dessert is one word piezookie. If you can't eat a whole one they have a mini. It's a baked soft cookie with ice cream. Sinful but delish."
Leilani R.,"Ballenger Creek, MD",11,65,127,4.0,1/12/2014,"I enjoyed my first visit. It was a Friday evening and we were on the call ahead wait list. Despite that, it took 45 minutes to get a table. I can't imagine the wait if you just walked in. It's a new place so I would expect long waiting on weekend evenings anyway.  I enjoyed the Jeremiah Red, the Oasis amber and Nutty brunette beer. I will definitely go back and try the others. I'm not so hung up on them not brewing ON site like others have expressed in their review as it is their beer being shipped in anyway. I don't have a need to see the brewing process. I've frequented Barley and Hops for years (as well as other brewery type restaurants) and I work in Biotech Biopharm. I'm over seeing all the shiny tanks. Besides, Brewers Alley moved their brewery outside their restaurant and that helped expand the bar area tremendously.  That place is STILL hopping without the tanks and I'm sure that's helped in bringing in more customers.  The food was good. I had the hand tossed spicy meatball pizza. It was tasty and probably could have stayed in the oven a little longer. I like crispy bottoms. I tasted the deep dish. It was good too. Very airy and not so dense. The mini size was tiny but probably a good option if you loaded up on beer and appetizers beforehand. Could have used more cheese/toppings.  Overall I would visit them again. Every new restaurant needs to shake out the kinks until they can get into a more consistent/efficient mode. Beer is good IMHO. Besides, taste IS subjective so don't base whether to try this place or not from someone else's opinion. Try it the craft beer out and judge the taste yourself. Ambiance is nice. Waitstaff was pleasant enough.  Oh, the bathrooms were stylish and pretty clean. Always a plus in MY book if you want a good review. ;) Welcome to Frederick, BJs!  We need more places like yours in this town and more night life places that stay open longer!"
Eliza F.,"Billings, MT",0,2,,1.0,12/4/2016,"Terrible service. We were seated and left for 15 minutes before our server came to get our drink orders. It was another 45 minutes before our food came. The server said the manager would come by to apologize, she never came. The server reached across us several times. My burger was cooked unevenly. All around disappointing dining experience."
Greg S.,"Hagerstown, MD",0,5,,2.0,12/3/2016,It was a busy night and our twenty minute wait was a easy forty minute wait.  Our appetizer did not show up before our meal we had to ask again for it.  I ordered a burger and was not asked how I like it. So I assumed it would be cooked. WRONG.  Oh well it was my first time there probably won't go back.
Sedine S.,"Los Angeles, CA",54,726,26,4.0,4/23/2014,Decided to order to go.  They have their own little area to order to go so that's always good.  We ordered quite a lot and they said it would be ready in 15 minutes. Good stuff.
Denise B.,"Elk Mound, WI",13,66,6,5.0,3/16/2016,Thoroughly enjoyed the Creme soda and root beer brewed on site. Jordan and Laura are great servers and very helpful with gluten free selections. I selected their house-made herbed gf pizza crust with a number of ingredients. Great pizza. Great service. Great sodas.
Stewart S.,"Frederick, MD",37,49,,3.0,4/1/2016,"Yeah.  3 stars is about right.  It's ok.  Foods ok, beers good, service is ok.  I might go back.  Nothing great. Nothing bad.  Pretty good selection of food.  Got right in on a Friday."
Jim C.,"Elkton, MD",10,21,6,5.0,3/19/2016,"Awesome place! Great food, big portions. Nice friendly staff, easy check in using the mobile app. Monkey bread was delicious, so was the Roasted Brussel Sprouts with honey sarratcha sauce. Can't say enough good things about the restaurant, can't find anything bad to say about it. I will definitely be returning!!! I was at the Frederick,  md  location."
Angela S.,"Frederick, MD",1,245,144,4.0,1/15/2015,"Oh no, I have to bring my rating back to 4 stars.  I've been here 3 times, and the service has been great each time.  But on this last visit, the food didn't match the menu description (one of my biggest restaurant pet peeves).  I got the kale and roasted brussels sprouts salad).  The menu said it came with candied pecans, pumpkin seeds, and red onion (in addition to other items).  Those three items were missing, so there was zero crunch to the salad.  It was just leaves and berries.  So, I am deducting 1 star.  Things like this should not be missed."
Steve L.,"Brookeville, MD",4,35,,1.0,11/21/2015,"Been here twice in 30 days.  Normally, I'd learn from the first time, but each time it was the place my young nephews choose to go for their birthday dinners.  (The older nephew attends a college in the area and he does not have enough life experience to know about good and lesser restaurants and the younger nephew choose BJ's because that is where his older brother choose to go.) Pluses - this is probably a great place to have a couple of beers, some mediocre bar food, and watch several games at once.  The bar area is large and the beer selection is impressive.  That is where it stops. I want to note that I essentially had the same experience for both visits.  A group of 7-8 of us each time, with a reservation, and in fact slightly early, and the restaurant was not full.  The hostess essentially ignored us until our reservation was called.  Once the reservation was called, a table had to be found for us that accommodated 7-8 people.  I certainly had the sense that there was not much of a plan to seat us, and ""they'd get to it when they get to it"". The main issue is the service at the table, or lack thereof.  I observed that the server had no more than 3 parties each time and was not spending a lot of time with the other 2 parties.  Just bringing water to the table was time consuming.  Then she left for awhile and came back to take drink orders, which took an unusually long time for delivery.  (How can ice tea, soft drinks, and maybe one bottle of beer take 10 minutes?)  Then she left again prior to asking if we had any questions about menu.  She eventually came back and took the orders.  An extraordinarily long time passed again before appetizers were delivered.  So and so forth throughout the meal.  While both servers were very pleasant, I just can't figure out the time factor issue.  Bottom line, a fairly simple meal took almost two hours. The food itself was OK to good, but not something that I'd return for, given the service.  For the second visit, my nephew ordered a 1/2 rack of ribs.  A full rack was delivered (which he would have eaten without a problem).  The server realized the mistake, told him that she'd ""be in big trouble"", if she didn't take the plate back and bring a plate with a 1/2 rack of ribs.  What did she (or the kitchen do)?  The rack was clearly cut in half and who knows where the other half went?  (The clean white rib was showing where it was cut vs. a properly prepared 1/2 rack.) Hopefully my nephews, nor anyone else I know, chose to go to BJ's in the future."
