Maz W.,"Clarksburg, MD",1,49,39,1.0,8/13/2016,"I agree with the reviewers who said this place has gone downhill. Case in point is what happened when we came for a birthday dinner one Saturday night in July. They were obviously understaffed in the kitchen, or should I say overwhelmed? One of our kids had to wait nearly an hour for his pizza-- apparently because they made a mistake and gave it to someone else, even though it was a special order. I asked for a burger without mayo, and when it came an hour later, it had a ton of mayo. I sent it back, waited 30-40 min, and it came back without any of their sauce. When I cut into it, it was burnt and inedible. At that point I was the only one in the party who had not eaten yet, and everyone was done. The manager apologized and didn't charge us for my burger, but I guess they were ok that someone came to their restaurant and sat there for 2+ hours, watched everyone else eat, and left hungry. To be fair we had better experiences in the past. But I am not returning or recommending this place to anyone. It could very easily happen to someone else, given the poor quality control in their kitchen."
Vic S.,"Reston, VA",3,60,6,4.0,10/28/2016,"BJ's is good solid food. An extensive menu, but lots of good food. I just had the Bacon Guacamole Burger Deluxe, which was great. It had a nice grill taste to the burger. I ate it on a gluten free bun, which was ok. I suspect the regular bun is much better. I also had a Tortilla Soup instead of fries. The soup was not the best I've had but very good for a gringo restaurant. We had a party of 10 and all enjoyed the food and great service."
Darren D.,"Hagerstown, MD",0,2,,4.0,8/9/2015,"First visit. Very clean . staff was friendly and helpful. Food came quickly and was hot. I had Caesar salad,  jambalaya and a Lightswitch Lager. All three were Very good. I would order all again. My wife ordered the portobello burger, fries and sweet tea. She enjoyed her's also.  We look forward to our next trip and explore the menu more and maybe dessert."
Gwyneth W.,"Frederick, MD",127,15,1,4.0,12/20/2015,"I love this place, although almost every time we go, we wind up sticking with the deep dish pizza. There's an occasional wait to grab a seat at the bar and the bartenders are REALLY busy, but I've never left the place disappointed. All around nice people working there. Best foods: Deep dish pizza, fried artichokes, wedge salad Best beverages: Hard to decide, although we enjoy their Hopstorm IPA and the seasonal pumpkin ale. They typically have a decent selection of craft beers beyond their house brews."
Emily M.,"Loudoun County, VA",8,24,30,2.0,10/10/2014,"I agree with previous reviews that say this place would be a lot better with some management/staff changes. I'm not sure exactly what needs to be done, but I've been here 6 or 7 times now, and I think only one of those times was both my food & service ok.  Sometimes the food is cold, sometimes the food takes forever, and for the fact that 'Brewhouse' is in the name, I have yet to talk to waitstaff that knows anything about beer. The last time I was there, our waitress said framboise was a 'style of beer' and it's called that because it's 'creamy'.  That aside, I keep coming back because it's one of the larger restaurants in Frederick, and since it's a chain, it's easy to get a group of people to agree to go there.  If the service & food quality improved, I would be happy to go much more often!"
Camille A.,"Baltimore, MD",66,250,14,3.0,11/9/2014,drove an hr away to come. Not so much for the food but for the pazookie. The food was okay. ordered a hamburger which was dry and had cold french fries. When my friends food came out she had no silverware and it took them about 5 minutes to bring some. Service and food was just okay
Kate Z.,"Frederick, MD",2,27,47,3.0,12/29/2014,This is the only chain type restaurant I can stand in the area. The service has so far been fine for me. The food has consistently been good. I have no complaints. The beer selection is wonderful and the gluten free cookie dessert is pretty delicious. I would much rather go to Brewers ally downtown though.
Matt W.,"Wilmington, NC",659,295,17,5.0,10/2/2014,"Avocado egg rolls were awesome, light and crispy with great crunch and flavor. The mediterranean chicken pita tacos were unbelievable. Like gyros with an excellent side of seasonal grains--great flavor. Like a jacked up taboullie (sp?)! The jalapeno burger was really good. Although overcooked and the bun got a little dry it had tons of flavor. It woulda been a 5/5, but still only dropped to a 4/5 due to the discrepancies. And the go-to BBQ chicken salad was as good as we remember from our Burbank, Cali days. Smaller and less chicken since '08, but the times man. Ahh a stroll down memory lane pre-08 meltdown. Server ruled and the Pumpkin Ale with fireball and sugared rim was delicious."
Justin P.,"Damascus, MD",5,18,6,4.0,2/16/2015,"This is my new favorite place in frederick. Good beer and awesome food. The setting is very comfortable which makes it a good dinning experience. The menu is excellent, everything I've had here is always delicious. The deserts are freaking amazing."
Derek H.,"Dover, NH",0,17,,3.0,8/7/2016,"Beer and service was good, but the thick crust pizza tasted like Pizza Hut. Wasn't horrible but crossed my mind the wait was for the delivery guy to drop off the pizza"
Christina M.,"Frederick, MD",0,22,,2.0,10/23/2015,"Long wait for food that could at best be called ""bland"". Same goes for the in house beer selection - meh at best. It's over-priced and over-crowded for food you could easily get anywhere. Really not worth your time."
Shirley D.,"Rockville, MD",190,79,34,3.0,9/8/2014,"Came on a Sunday night with 4 friends and waited about 20 min at the bar until the beeper vibrated. We were seated in one of those half circle booths. Ordered the chicken potstickers, handcrafted root beer, and brewhouse burger with wedges. Potstickers - not really impressed and didnt have enough flavor. Also $9.50 for 6. Root beer - too much carbonation, but I liked the taste Burger - BANGIN! It was perfect and they were not stingy with the wedges either. I enjoyed every bite. It was worth the money (exception: potstickers) and you get what you pay for! I would like to add that my friends couldnt finish their meal and had to take the rest home ;) And also, the service was great!"
Jeremy B.,"New Market, MD",100,7,,5.0,6/7/2015,"The best restaurant in Frederick. Has everything you could ever want Seriously... every type of food ever. You won't look at the menu and be like ""i don't know what to get"" Just depends on whatever food mood you're in. They have plenty of healthy options too for you weirdos. (I stay around 10% body fat year round and eat here plenty). Trust me You can eat here and not worry about busting your hard work in the gym. Go check this place out"
Mike C.,"Rockville, MD",5,60,86,3.0,11/17/2014,"I've been wanting to try this restaurant for sometime now, and I finally did it. The interior was huge, with quite a few television sets to watch games. I was seated promptly and greeted by a waitress, who in actuality probably had not had much time on the job.  But that's fine. I know people have to start sometime. She was very nice and promptly pointed out the specials of the day. The only thing that I think was lacking about her service was not bringing me more napkins and not refilling my drink without being asked. Anyways, to the food. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with the wedge cut fries. It comes with a side of coleslaw. It also comes with a straw onions on top of it which made me wonder where I was going to even put the barbecue sauce because it was so high. The coleslaw was kind of odd because it was huge chunks rather than the shredded type that I'm used to, but tasted fine. The sandwich came with a little container of barbecue sauce which I poured on the sandwich and also put the coleslaw on top of it. I had my doubts at first, but once I tasted it they were erased. It was probably one of the best pulled pork sandwiches I've ever had. The meal was VERY tasty. For desert I had the Triple Chocolate Pizookie, which was a large chocolate cookie in a pan, heated, with chunks of Ghiradelli chocolate. It's then topped with 2 scoops of chocolate ice cream and a Ghiradelli dark chocolate square. Also VERY delicious. Overall, I highly recommend this place and look forward to trying some of their other foods. Give it a shot. Update: While I was there for my first visit, I signed up for their premium rewards program. I specifically asked the girl if my meal could be counted towards my points which is one point per dollar spent. She told me that would be fine but they needed to put it in at the end of the day. About a week later I went to the site to try and check on my point balance and found that I couldn't put a password in anywhere because I was not given one. I called their customer service and they said they were updating the site and that they would send me a new card which they did. They also sent me an email which showed I had a zero balance instead of the points I was supposed to receive. So I called again and basically their phone customer service act like they're doing you a favor. They told me they would have somebody call me back which never happened. They are really not helpful at all. In fact if you don't have a receipt which I didn't because it was about a month before, they won't add the points. I feel if I'm giving them my personal information to sell or whatever they're doing with it at least I should get something out of it. Basically I was very unhappy with their customer service and it still has not been resolved. I'm only asking for a mere 22 points! It's not like I'm going to lie about it. It's taking more time away from my day just to contact them three or four times in the past month. So now for the third time they've told me they'll have somebody call me back. We will see. They've had issues ""updating"" their website for a MONTH! Who does that? And as far as the points, I know if it was Amazon I was dealing with and I had the same problem they'd credit my points right away and probably send me some gift card or something to make up for the hassle. To be honest the food is really good in this place, but I've been so turned off by this whole experience I probably won't eat there again. It's a shame because I really like it."
Karri V.,"Frederick, MD",62,113,21,4.0,9/16/2014,"What a pleasant surprise! I was unsure what to expect because of the reviews for this place but we had a pretty nice experience for lunch on Saturday.   First, what the heck is going on with that hostess station? They formed a line of people waiting to be sat which would have been fine but we all just stood there for 10 minutes not moving. Those girls seemed really confused and in no hurry to fix the issue. It was just really weird.  Luckily, everything was smooth sailing after that. Our server, Courtney, was really sweet and professional. She seemed very knowledgable about the food and drinks available. We started with the spinach and artichoke dip and a few small plates for the table; those corn fritters were excellent. My husband and I each did a beer sampler. Being a dark beer drinker, I was surprised that my favs were all lighter (specifically the blonde). I look forward to trying more of what they have to offer.  All of our meals were really good and well prepared. My only complaint was with the shrimp on my pasta. They had absolutely no seasoning or flavor whatsoever and it really brought the whole dish down. Other than that, everything ordered was tasty. We will absolutely be back. I really want to try their pizza. Also, I saw on the menu that their weekday lunch specials start around $6 which is really good to know!"
Stacy S.,"Gaithersburg, MD",32,8,2,4.0,7/28/2014,"First visit and would go back.  Our waiter was awesome!  Ordered the pizza for my daughter who refused to eat it.  I kinda don't blame her, it was blah.  I asked for light sauce and was told they don't put much on so I wouldn't have to worry about it.  He wasn't kidding...there was NO SAUCE on the pizza.  The wedge cut fries were really good, def a winner for our table.  The chicken fingers ended up being something my daughter loved and ended up having for lunch and dinner!   The Dip sandwich was pretty good.  Portion sizes were decent. Great restaurant, family friendly for sure!!! We will be back!"
Deb N.,"Damascus, MD",1,13,4,5.0,11/1/2015,The best service ever. My granddaughter has life threatening allergies and the server was so good working with us in getting her a meal she could eat. He also made sure that the person preparing the food changed their gloves so she would not be exposed to anything that would indanger her. He had so much patience helping her and us. The food was excellent and we were not rushed as we were celebrating a birthday. BJ'S will be our go to place for family get togethers.
Jeff K.,"Kure Beach, NC",17,14,,1.0,1/15/2016,"It's the little things.  While the food was acceptable, for the most part, very little else was.  The waitress was mediocre at best.  I found dirty forks in several of the place settings at our table.  The app I ordered was served after the entree and not until I asked about it.  My wife ordered a second glass of wine.  The wine they brought was not the wine she ordered.  They serve from a small glass decanter so you don't know what you're getting.  The over all experience left me feeling like management at this location does not care about the product they are putting out there.  It seems to be comfortable with mediocre.  I don't have to spend money on mediocre in Frederick MD where options for good food are abundant.  Wake up BJs."
Don K.,"Mount Airy, MD",56,23,2,3.0,7/23/2014,"I've been to BJ's a few times now.  My wife and I have been on date night once or twice, we've been as a family of 5 with our 3 kids, and I've been to the bar only with a buddy.   All in all, I'd say that the experience was decent for each visit.  The seated service on the later nights was a bit slow, but based on the crowds that night and that it was closer to when it originally opened, I guess that's to be expected somewhat. The one complaint I have is related to the call ahead seating.  During one of our visits with the family we did call ahead and were told 30 minutes.  So we arrive with about 5 minutes to spare, and were told that our wait would be about another 20 or so minutes.  When we explained that we did call ahead, they said that since more people had come in since we called, that our wait time had been pushed.  Somehow, in my mind, that's the whole point of having call ahead.  We weren't pleased but we didn't let it ruin our night. To me, call ahead folks should be given higher priority for planning ahead.  Hopefully it was a one time fluke and somebody just screwed up. In the end, we'll be back again someday I'm sure."
Jen S.,"Waynesboro, PA",1,20,21,3.0,9/7/2014,The service was good and the food was ok but it was only ok.  It's a chain and feels like a chain. The food is not nearly as good as The Barley and Hops.   The experience was fine but won't go back. Just nothing really special about it.
