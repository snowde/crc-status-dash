Kellie S.,"San Diego, CA",68,52,15,5.0,12/9/2017,"Excellent food, excellent service and an amazing evening with family. We had Kevin A as our server and he was very attentive and personable. The garlic parm wings were so good and the croutons on the salads are probably my favorite (I know im strange). We enjoyed everything and intend on coming back!!"
Melissa T.,"Alexandria, VA",15,106,84,3.0,1/10/2018,"We went for a friend's birthday in which we had a large group.  We were able to do separate checks.  The food was pretty good considering my dietary needs.  I had the Brussel Sprouts appetizer, Spinach stuffed mushrooms and the Tumeric Caulifower side dish.  These three definitely earned each 3 stars above. However, my husband wasn't pleased with his boneless wings and mozzarella sticks.  We wanted to pack up his leftovers and had asked for a box.  Half hour later, the birthday boy was taking a Blow Job shot and put the whip cream on our leftovers unknowingly. Shade was thrown at the waitress as my husband told the birthday boy not to worry about it since we never got the box, we had asked for a half hour ago.  The waitress stood there watching the birthday boy take the shot and never even got the shade.  I ordered dessert and the hubby just wanted more beer.  Hence our requests weren't even fulfilled an hour later.   This was the first time I never left a tip in my life (just my change of $2) and thank goodness even with our big party, the gratuity wasn't included.  Our server was dim witted and more concerned with the partying going on than serving us.  She had puppy dog eyes for the birthday boy (who was married) and said that he hated her.  Wtf?!  Otherwise, I would come back for the food but the service certainly did not make me want the food that bad unless I order for takeout."
Nicole H.,"Fredericksburg, VA",1,39,23,4.0,12/5/2017,"So, I went with a few friends on a Sunday afternoon/early evening. Ok at 4! We were immediately seated, it was busy, but not overly crowded. Atmosphere was really nice. Busy, but nice. Seemed family friendly. Our server Marky Mark (he says it's on his birth certificate), knew his stuff. He knew the menu front and back. Very, very personable, tons of fun. Needless to say, at the end of the evening he got a good tip. From all of us.  Now for the food. Appetizers: cheese curds (I'd never had them) delicious. Hot. Cheesy. Sweet potato fries. Not a fan on sugar and cinnamon on mine, but my compadre did and before she added it, I was enjoying them. Maybe a little too crunchy but still good. Some kind of flat bread thing with jalapeños and a bunch of veggies I like. Amazing!  For the main dish I got jambalaya. It was spicy, but not quite as much flavor as I would've liked. Either way, still a good dish. My companions had meals that looked equally delicious, but no one was in the sharing mood. Dessert. I had the baked beigne that came with ice cream and whipped cream. Still good. Needless to say, I walked out of there STUFFED! Definitely going again. And again. Aaand again."
Nicole J.,"Fredericksburg, VA",51,105,306,3.0,6/23/2017,The food was ok. My fish and chips tasted like beer and I couldn't eat it but my husband liked it. The burgers were good.  My daughter's friend had the chicken chopped salad minus the chicken because she's vegetarian and loved it.  The hopstorm IPA was a keeper according to my husband. I had the strawberry splash which was a combination of pina colada and strawberry daiquiri. OMG. I could drink that all day. The service was GREAT.
Steve S.,"Parsippany, NJ",562,1173,285,3.0,9/19/2017,"The last time I was down here in Fredericksburg (a few weeks ago) I stopped at BJs...the third one I've tried and I wasn't as happy with this visit as with the other two I've tried before. We were seated fairly quickly, but it took some time before a waitress came to our table...not too long, but it seemed odd. When she came over I ordered one of the BJs beers (I think it was the amber) and my daughter just had some water.   The drinks came quickly and I ordered the BJs Brewhouse Burger and my daughter had the Blonde Fish & Chips.  When the food finally came my medium burger was rare, like cold to the touch in the middle and my daughter's fish were super oily and a bit soggy. The waitress was a bit horrified and resubmitted the order and when they came out the second time both meals were fine. My burger was good, but my fries and my daughter's fish needed some extra seasoning.  We also ordered out Pizzookies which they got perfectly. If you ever come here...save room for dessert as these are great.  I know BJ's can do a little better so I will give them another shot"
D E.,"Fredericksburg, VA",3,34,4,4.0,1/1/2018,Great food. Love that they have ciders and beer on tap. Wish they kept the asparagus appetizer
Jonell G.,"Spotsylvania, VA",18,46,15,2.0,12/31/2017,"This place is brand new, I had high hopes. I went with my daughter on a Sunday afternoon, it was horrible. Poor service, we sat at out table for 15 Minutes before I went and found someone to get our drinks and then it was another 15 before the drinks came. Needless to say ten minutes after that we walked out. Our order was never taken."
Joseph L.,"Fredericksburg, VA",35,128,254,2.0,11/12/2017,Not much to say... it was just ok.  Nothing to get excited about.
Gail G.,"Fredericksburg, VA",0,58,35,3.0,8/14/2017,"This was my first time there. My server Brittany was fast and attentive. Huge menu. It's best not to have so much as it can overwhelm the kitchen but it all looked amazing.   The prices are much higher than I expected however. A small bowl of soup was almost 5 bucks so I passed on that.  They do let you sub sides, for example I ordered fish n chips but got the baked potato vs chips.  The tarter sauce was not good. It was not traditional but more of a horse radish flavor.  So I ordered ranch to dip the fish in but it was a watery sour cream look and flavor.    She said that the beer batter is darker than one may expect but wont mean that it's over cooked but it was a bit over cooked but tasty.  Next time she said I can ask them to cook it lightly.  I used the normal door vs the revolving as I am not a fan of those. I noticed one person here said they got hit by it. My hubby will love all of the super thin crust pizzas when I take him with me next time. It is a bit loud with music and tv's going too but it is in fact more of a bar style place after all. Only due to the high prices, I won't go often but I will come back. Another waitress accidentally dumped a whole glass if ice water on the lap of an elderly lady so that was odd but the customer took it all in stride.  I just left there and ate at about 4:30pm.  I will post some pics next. I do like that the owner or manager cares enough to reply to some of these so that is nice to see."
Lisa A.,"Fredericksburg, VA",0,10,1,2.0,10/23/2017,"Great looking restaurant but very noisy and the food was below average at best.  Portions are extremely small for what you pay.  Calamari appetizer was mainly ""crumbs"" and extremely greasy.  I ordered the chicken and soba noodles in a spicy peanut sauce.  The noodles were grey and lukewarm.  I ordered based on the photo and description from the menu and what I received was nowhere close.  My son ordered a 20.00 deep dish pizza and it was absolutely not worth it.  I've had better deep dish from Little Cesar's.  Best item we had all night was the monkey bread pizookie.  They need to get their act together.  I was expecting a far better experience than what we got."
July A.,"Locust Grove, VA",0,8,,4.0,12/22/2017,"Came here on a Wednesday night and the place was packed. We've been wanting to check out this new place and it seems it's still the new place to check out in the 'Burg. I dropped off the wife to get us a table because the parking lot directly in front is tiny. TIP: It's easier to park in the bigger lot behind the restaurant. Wife was able to get the last table and we were seated. Service was good and they even brought out a complimentary fruit and bread plate for our 19m old. It kept her satiated till her spaghetti came out. They kindly allowed us to substitute penne pasta versus noodles. She enjoyed her pasta. We've found some restaurants use a ""watered down"" version of food for the kids menu and our daughter doesn't care for the bland food. My wife both enjoyed our entrees. She had the Nashville Hot and Crispy which had a nice kick. I had the Chipotle Salmon. The salmon was cooked perfectly. The asparagus was a little lacking. They were quite thin and it didn't seem they chopped off the base as that part was very fibrous. This is a basic food prep for asparagus. Service was outstanding with drinks and food coming out timely. I'm glad this location has food as good as other locations I've been to."
Jason Y.,"Pottstown, PA",1,66,16,1.0,11/8/2017,"Good food and beer selection but if you get here after 10 be prepared for a nasty smell and experience from the bar. They start rinsing and cleaning the bar area, even though they're still open. Most places wait until the customers are gone. Sadly, this creates a nasty smell and releases the fruit flies. This is my 3rd time at this location and witnessed the same thing each time. Come on management!  Make better decisions."
Beth F.,"Cabin John, MD",0,3,,1.0,11/22/2017,"Service sucked. We sat down in the bar area. We waited 15 minutes before someone came to wait on us. My boyfriend got the clam chowder in a sour dough bread bowl. The chowder was so thick it looked like mashed potatoes. The bread bowl was hard as a rock. We also ordered wings; 5 cheery glaze and 5 dry rubbed sriracha. They forgot to put the  sriracha dry run on them. We mentioned something to our waitress and she said she would be right back she was going to get a little bowl of the rub for us. No she did NOT offer to take the wings back!!! It took 10 minutes to get the rub for us to put on our wings ourselves! Just all around awful!!!! Awful everything. It's a bunch of kids working who have no idea about customer service or work ethic. And whoever is cooking back in the kitchen, needs a few cooking lessons.  This place will be out of business before next winter."
Randa H.,"King George, VA",23,60,240,4.0,6/29/2017,"We tried BJ's for the first time on Tuesday with my 5 year old nephew who has been dying to go. We called ahead to make reservations but they informed us that they do not take them, however, we told them we would be there around 6:45 and they said they'd be able to seat us immediately. When we arrived we were told there was a 25 minute wait, which wasn't surprising because it is new. After 40 minutes we checked to see where how many people were in front of us and were told 3 parties, but we were seated not a minute later. They brought out pizza samples while we waited which was great but one of the hostesses made a strange comment about how we should be thankful we were being seated as we were taken to the table.  We had three servers assigned to our table who were very knowledgeable and friendly. They took our orders quickly and did pretty well with the tablets they were using considering they haven't been open long. Our food didn't take that long considering how busy they were and our drinks stayed full.  The menu is huge and we had a little bit of everything - ziti, burgers, chicken sandwiches, salads, and the kid's spaghetti. We also shared three pizookies and a beignet. OMG. The dinners were all great and sides were very large. Our burgers were cooked perfectly and the fries were delicious. The ziti was amazing and the chicken on the sandwiches and salad was so crispy and juicy. The desserts were out of this world too.  Prices were average for that sort of restaurant. We had two appetizers, 6 dinners, one kid's meal, four desserts, and four alcoholic beverages for $155.  We will definitely come back and try some more of the endless options on the menu."
B H.,"Fredericksburg, VA",14,54,3,1.0,10/2/2017,"First of all ~ we love the BJ's concept and have enjoyed many of their locations.  This newer location is just not up to par.  They have too many front of house staff on the floor at any given time.  They bump into each other and create chaos.   However, they do not have enough bartenders working during prime times.  Scheduling seems to need improvement. Saturday, 9/30/17 at 7:15pm -- it took 25 minutes for 2 beers, 2 cocktails and 3 kids drinks to be delivered.  And, one of the cocktails was wrong.  Another issue they have had last 3 times (in 6 weeks) that we have been there is mixing up table numbers.  We receive incorrect order and another table receives ours.  Both at tables in the bar as well as table in dining room.  Finally - the kitchen -- the food is very hit or miss.  Even their awesome Clam Chowder was a mess this past weekend.  It was gelatinous and visually unattractive.  Not only our table but the table across from us pushed it away after a few spoonfuls.  The spicy chicken sandwhich lacked any ""kick"" at all.  Kitchen has not improved at all since grand opening.  Prime Rib was just OK but, not worth the price. Come on Fredericksburg, VA BJ's - get your act together!"
Tim T.,"Haines City, FL",46,6,2,2.0,12/19/2017,"The beer on tap is good. Nice selection. The Bartenders are great. This is the only reason I didn't give it one star. However! The food is absolutely awful. I've given the place multiple attempts. And every time the food comes out incorrect, over or under done and it all seems to be pre prepared frozen food. If you go, go for the beer. Don't expect much from the food."
Cliff B.,"Fredericksburg, VA",14,5,,1.0,12/14/2017,"Went to BJs for lunch today and will not go back. Got seated right away and waitress came to the table promptly. Since we were on our lunch hour, we asked how long to get our order and were told 15-20 minutes. 35 minutes later we still didn't have our food. When finally delivered, there was just a sandwich and no fries. Waitress said they were out of fries and that they ran out yesterday too. Very poor planning for a restaurant that has fries with almost everything on the menu to run out 2 days in a row. We were not offered a substitute and had to ask for a reduction in the bill.  The sandwich was good but the experience was disappointing. If you decide to try BJs, make sure you have plenty of time to wait."
J O.,"Washington, DC",0,3,,5.0,12/17/2017,Came unexpectedly as a big group of 14 family members and was accommodated quickly to a table! Marky mark was our server and he did a great job! Good food and friendly service!!!
Jessica M.,"Colonial Beach, VA",75,32,8,5.0,7/11/2017,"Had a good time with the family here. the kids love their burgers.  the calamari was good, but my ahi tuna salad was Amazing.  The flavor was spot-on.  The portion of thr salaf was a little too big. The only other thing I would change would be less mixed greens, definitely less red cabbage, and more tuna with more wontons.  The wontons were perfectly crunchy.  The pickled cucumbers. Yummmmm. I had a bite of watermelon with it and it was even better.   I definitely would come back just for that. Oh and $3 churro and ice cream to die for.   I wish i wasn't so full bc I want to eat more of it.  The staff was great. And your get military discounts.  I would definitely recommend this everyone."
Michael B.,"Jacksonville, FL",9,22,5,1.0,9/18/2017,The food portions are TINY! The $12 burger is only 5 oz uncooked. Asked for a medium cooked burger and it was just black and crisp! The food quality is very poor. Eat somewhere else!
Crystal T.,"Stafford, VA",48,90,215,5.0,9/25/2017,"I was hesitant to go here since I'd never heard of the place before, however, I did have a lot of friends recommending the place so you know I had to go see what the hype was all about. First, our waiter Tim was awesome and friendly! We wanted to try the garlic knots but we didn't want an entire order of them (we're trying to watch our girlish figures) so he brought us out one garlic knot each since it was taking a while for our food to come. We ordered a veggie trio small plate which had crispy roasted cauliflower, a beet medley with goat cheese, and roasted carrots; all were delicious! If you're not watching your girlish figure, I'd recommend ordering an entire order of the garlic knots; they were the bomb dot com!!! I ordered the fish and shrimp tacos for my entree since I'm vegetarian/pescatarian. I ordered one fish taco and one shrimp taco. My order came out wrong it was two fish tacos and Tim told me that they'd get the order right and to go ahead and eat the tacos that I had; I told him that I had tasted the fish and didn't like it so he brought me out two shrimp tacos; they were delicious!!! Tim also told me that if I signed up for the loyalty program that I'd get a free mini dessert so of course I did! I had the chocolate chip cookie thing with icecream on top, OMG heaven in your mouth!!!! I almost forgot, they have some pretty delicious beers too! I actually like their signature berry beer it's a must try! Definitely going back to this place."
Kimberlee G.,"Ruther Glen, VA",77,1,,1.0,12/27/2017,Told we'd wait an hour. 2 hours later we haven't been seated. It's a Wednesday night..wtf?! Asked for some drinks when the manager came to apologize. Told he couldn't serve it over here because he couldn't ring it up. Wouldn't you think it'd be complimentary since we've been waiting for 2+ hours? We came here on veterans day weekend (Saturday) and got seated in less than 15 minutes?! Absolutely ridiculous. Won't be coming to this branch EVER again.
Graham K.,"Spotsylvania, VA",23,9,,5.0,12/10/2017,Great place to come for happy hour! $4 for all BJs craft beers.  Try the Grand Cry - smooth Belgian style at 10% ABV! The mini Mediterranean pizza was delicious.
Mary H.,"King George, VA",89,3,4,5.0,8/26/2017,"First time to BJ'S after they opened for over a month now! This place is very crowded but we got seated right away. Our server is very friendly and right on task. All the food that we ordered were extremely tasty. Calamari were perfectly cooked, breading is very light and airy. Ahi Poke was fresh and well seasoned. Kids loved the deep dish ziti, sliders, and of course the dessert!  Churro pizookie is a must have!!!! Will come back next time to try out other items on the menu!"
Yetta L.,"Fredericksburg, VA",8,14,,4.0,7/9/2017,"I am completely conflicted with this review. I wish there was a multi part review. I would give the food 5 stars for taste and the service 3.  QThe food is EXCELLENT. I have been here 5 times within a week. The pulled pork sandwich is one of the best I've had. The pan pizza has a nice crispy crust. The Southern Comfort chicken sandwich is amazing. We're a family of 6 and we each order something different every time we've been and there hasn't been one thing we've had we didn't like.  The bad: Service the first time was absolutely horrible. Our food didn't come out for 45 min and one dish had to be sent back for being cold. 2nd and 3rd visits things were good and the 4th was The best service I've had in a long time. The fifth time, my food came out cold and the burgers were overcooked for my hubby and son.  We waited 21 minutes for replacement burgers and ended up leaving. I hope they get the service right because this could potentially be one if he best places to eat in Fredericksburg."
Marie G.,"Fredericksburg, VA",1,33,53,5.0,12/4/2017,"I've eaten here several times. Sometimes there is a wait. The menu is extensive. I'm a vegetarian and my sister is a GF vegetarian. Both of us were able to select from a few different options. Everything was well prepared. The service varies, depending on the server. One server was exceptional and one of the others, not so much. Still worth the wait, with the hit or miss service. Extensive food and alcohol menu ensures everyone is happy. Sometimes parking can be filled up close to the restaurant, but there is plenty of parking, with a little bit of a walk."
Kathy S.,"Fredericksburg, VA",1,10,,2.0,7/12/2017,"My date had been there for lunch so recommended it for dinner. Very busy for a Wednesday evening. Got knocked into by the revolving door because the lobby was so packed. It was very loud in there and too hot to go outside to wait so we went get a drink at the bar because of a 30 minute wait, which we don't mind.  Almost fell on the way to the bar and to our table  because the floors are SO SLIPPERY!!  The menu is huge which tells me the kitchen is probably chaotic.  We ordered the beer battered asparagus appetizer which was ok, a few pieces were inedible. My date had the jalepeno burger and fries which he liked the burger but didn't eat hardly any of the massive amount of fries. I had the lemon thyme chicken with brown rice and very limited vegetables, definitely way too much rice. It was a little dry but ok. The service was OK, I could tell our server had no table service experience. I won't go back until they clean the floors properly and have their staff well trained. Sedona still out ranks on all levels."
D C.,"Fredericksburg, VA",1,30,32,2.0,7/9/2017,"It a word:  ""Meh...""  Server was good, and atmosphere nice-ish (although a little on the noisy side), but food was WAY TOO salty!  3 people in our party, and we all agreed.  The appetizer came out cold, and was bland.  The meals were so salty that none of us could finish them.   Maybe this place is still too new?  I'll stick with Sedona Taphouse for now..."
Dave K.,"Locust Grove, VA",0,7,2,1.0,11/22/2017,"We had the thin pizza that was recommended by the server, it was the worst pizza I ever had, no green peppers,red peppers or onions, it had a teaspoon full of mushrooms and a half a teaspoon of sausage ,some burned pepperoni and a lot of garlic and oregano. The noise level was unbearable on top of the noise they were playing ,what they called music ,I talked to the manager about the noise coming through the speakers .I said do you understand what they're singing she said ""no.""your blood pressure will double. Everything there was overpriced ,we were shocked when we got our bill. We usually give a restaurant two tries but we will never go back to BJ's again."
Sarah S.,"Fredericksburg, VA",34,16,2,5.0,8/20/2017,"Good food,and great service! Our server,Ryan was amazing.He was attentive and quick.They have a huge menu, but it all makes sense. The sriracha Brussels sprouts are a must. They were so good,I'm going to try to replicate them at home. The portions are huge,too, so bear that in mind. I had the fish and chips and they brought four good sized pieces(see picture).They have an impressive beer list as well,and the two beers that we tried were their brews,and were great( the nutty brewnette and their harvest hefeweizen)."
Chuck H.,"Stafford, VA",1,3,,2.0,7/8/2017,"While I thought I would really enjoy this place I didn't. The only thing that came out correct was the calamari and the asparagus! The salmon came out wrong, the sweet potato fries came out luke warm. Even when I asked to have the ice cream on the side for my desert it came out wrong also. They didn't offer to compensate the experience I had. The waiter said they don't do that REALLY? I'm not saying don't give this place a chance but the experience could have been a lot better! The prices are too high for that kind of service!!! Update: After speaking with the manager who is very nice I am being compensated for the experience I had. I really appreciate it."
Jonathan N.,"Fredericksburg, VA",0,10,,5.0,12/23/2017,This place is my new favorite spot. Have been here 4 times recently and each time has been fantastic. Big menu...great service. Supports both bar and family atmospheres. Awesome place.
Dee E.,"Fredericksburg, VA",0,19,3,4.0,11/11/2017,"The only reason I'm giving this four stars is for the server Shawna G. Had some issues with the food, but she really helped out and got things to work out for me. The food was three stars but the service was five. The pizza was very good, and the beer amazing. Could see myself returning in the future, but not necessarily a regular."
AnnieDuck D.,"Falmouth, VA",49,3,,5.0,9/11/2017,"I'm completely shocked at the poor reviews from people about BJs. I've been there about 6 times since they've opened and had nothing but amazing food, delicious drinks and quality service. I've always sat either at the bar or in the bar section. Brandon and Kaitlin were excellent with the drinks as well as food. My friends and I have frequently gone by the servers' suggestions because the menu is huge (which I think is a good thing!)... and have never been disappointed!!The turmeric roasted cauliflower is amazing as is the Mediterranean pita pocket!! I love that they have big meals as well as tapas size dishes.  I have on many occasions, eaten my food and ordered a pizza to go!! The BJs special deep dish pizza is to die for!!!  Whatever ""kinks "" they are said to have had in the beginning, I never experienced, and I will continue to go back again and again! By far my new favorite restaurant in the 'burg!!"
Brittanie L.,"Fredericksburg, VA",21,10,1,4.0,7/30/2017,"Great food and beer. Service is a Little slow especially at the bar however it Is a new restaurant and at the moment very busy. Food comes out on the slower side but everything I have tried. Mozzarella sticks, prime dip sandwich. They even give an appetizer for the little ones while they wait for Their Food!"
Andrea B.,"Stafford, VA",29,206,169,1.0,9/17/2017,"Really want to like this place but the bartender service sucks! Foods good but when you sit at a sticky dirty bar and everyone is eating and drinking and the bartender says ""I'll be right with you"" 3 times you walk out"
Bertha C.,"Fredericksburg, VA",3,56,135,5.0,7/1/2017,"Decided to stop in today for dinner with the family. The fact that it just opened recently I expected the wait to be long. Arrived around 4:17pm with the anticipation of waiting about 30-49 minutes. Hostess said the wait would be around 25-30 minutes. Great, not to long.  They took my name and had me enter my telephone number so I may receive text when my table was ready. Received my text at 4:36 pm. Good start so far.  We were seated and pretty much knew what we wanted, since we have visited other locations in the pass. We all ordered the mini pizza's (build your own), spinach and artichoke dip and a side Caesar salad. Overall everything was great, except I have had better dip. Did not have to wait long for our food and waitresses was very friendly.  Signed up for the app and received a free desert. Hubby and daughter enjoyed the Cookies and Cream Pizookie.  The mobile app is great, because you can get on the waitlist, order ahead and pay your bill.  Glad there is somewhere new in Fredericksburg."
Bill B.,"Stafford, VA",3,6,1,1.0,9/17/2017,"I rarely rate places but the service here is the worst I've ever seen. My first trip in this place we sat at the bar and the bar tenders, 2 of them would both walk right past you to go speak to their friends and make sure they were well taken care of. Second trip sat at the bar, was there early, service was fair ( bar was near empty ) food was good, beer choices good. Figured first time was a strange fluke and tried for the third time, when the bartender informed me for the third time gee I'll be right there we got up and walked out and I assure you we'll never return. Management needs to know that their bartenders severely lack serving, service, and professional skills."
Joe D.,"Fredericksburg, VA",8,7,3,1.0,9/8/2017,"Having worked in the service industry for thirty years I think I am qualified to say what I am about to say. No matter how busy or how new or how slow a restaurant is there is NO EXCUSE for a guest to sit at a table for more than three minutes without someone at least acknowledging them, let alone 7, yes SEVEN, minutes. There were two of us, it was 3:57 in the afternoon, it was a Thursday. The place was dead. We were seated immediately and we started to look at the tome they call a menu. I had to use the restroom and asked my husband to order me a drink. I returned three minutes later. No server had yet greeted our table. We waited. And we waited. There were two servers standing right behind us against the back wall jabbering about something. There were four servers meandering around near the host stand. There were two other servers attending the two other tables in our vicinity. We counted five different servers walk past us. We looked at our clocks and gave a time frame for how long we were going to wait. At the seven minute mark we got up. I asked the host on my way out if the computer says what time she sat us. She couldn't remember at which table she seated us, go figure, and when I pointed it out she and another host fumbled to find out the time. Frustration took over. I said that we sat for seven minutes and no one paid us any attention and we are leaving. I barely heard an apology as I walked out. I immediately called the restaurant from the parking lot. I asked to speak to a manager. After two minutes on hold I drove out of the parking lot. At the 7, yes SEVEN again, minute mark I hung up. We wound up at Red Lobster. Always friendly. Always prompt. One of our best service experiences yet. So, go see Ally at Red Lobster. She will take good care of you.  For you BJ's corporate who might be reading this- Our crappy first, and definitely last, experience at your Fredericksburg location occurred on Thursday September 8 2017 from 3:57pm to 4:05pm. Good luck."
Anthony L.,"Southbank, Jacksonville, FL",37,19,13,3.0,9/18/2017,Really undecided on how to rate this one.  Beer was good and cold. Lots of variety and an huge menu.  I often sit at the bar and realize that there are other duties they bartender Must take care of.   When I have to ask multiple times for water my plate makes it to me ten minutes after the pizza we have progressed past busy and moved into bad service.   Your cutting strawberries should not tAke precedence over condiments requested.
