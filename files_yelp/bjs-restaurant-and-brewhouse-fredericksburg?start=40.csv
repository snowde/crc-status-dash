Maria E.,"Arlington, VA",135,28,44,1.0,8/26/2017,"Checked in with host. Got a text saying  there is no wait and that I'd get a second text when the table was ready. Received that second text 20 min later. Checked back in with host. Waited another 10 mins. Seated. Waited another 10 mins for a waiter. Immediately ordered. Waited another 30 mins for food. Orders all wrong. Ordered no cheese; got lots of cheese. Ordered blackened shrimp; got Cajun shrimp. One of the entrées didn't arrive at all. Server's response : I ate it. Told him we are also missing calamari appetizer. His response, holding up a food slip: I got confused. I thought the calamari was on the burger. Told that the missing entree and the calamari appetizer would be out momentarily. Entree took 10 more min. Appetizer never arrived. Absolutely miserable experience. Especially disappointed because we've had great experiences at the Palmdale, CA restaurant."
Pam K.,"Maysville, WV",0,42,1,1.0,8/9/2017,"We were so excited to try this place. We ordered the calamari and ahi tuna salad. Went and picked it up and all seemed fine until we got home and found no sauces for the calamari. Called back to the restaurant and spoke with the manager Ted. Explained the problem and told him I could be there in 4 min. He stated it would take around 10-15 to re-fire and it would be taken care of. I showed up in the proper time period. I waited in the parking lot, in one the designated pick-up spaces. I waited approx 30 min with no response. I called the restaurant and asked for Ted, well guess what, he was gone! I did get a hold of Kaylab after 2 phone calls and explained the situation. He responded quickly, and gave me a free ahi tuna. I understand they may be going through some starting off pains, but this was not a good experience. I am normally a very patient person and cut staff a lot of slack. Going to have to really think hard about going back or give a better rating in the future  UPDATE: My husband and I went into the restaurant a few days ago to give it another try. Food was adequate. Service was good. Now here's the messed up part. Our bill was 186$. We paid and also got an additional charge of 166$. We we there yesterday to get it resolved. This morning the 166$ was reimbursed but we had a new charge for 201$ buyers beware! Check your credit card statements! There is either a scam going on or they have a thief!"
Mike B.,"Fredericksburg, VA",2,10,,2.0,8/26/2017,"Have eaten here twice (caveat:  both times after 9pm).  The first time the food was hit or miss across the five of us but the service was good.  The second time the food across the board (six of us) was awful and the service was okay, but inattentive.  As this was our second try of the restaurant, I did not complain as I believe we'd reached the ""natural limit"".  Had a manager or better yet our server asked if the food had come out well prepared, we could've addressed it as part of the service process.  This did not happen.  One additional comment: the place is loud to the point of disrupting table conversation or ordering interactions."
Jennifer W.,"Fredericksburg, VA",0,4,1,2.0,10/1/2017,"We ordered take out food this weekend and was pretty disappointed. All of the food was ice cold(we live ten minutes away so the food didn't sit around) and the broccoli was moldy and not cooked.  I attempted to call the store manager and was placed on hold for several minutes. It is safe to say, we will be spending our money else where. It's overpriced for the poor quality of food. I've eaten at the restaurant after it opened and it was great but it has already went down hill."
Kathy J.,"Sayre, PA",0,2,,5.0,11/28/2017,Wonderful dinner here tonight.  Absolutely the best flat bread pizza ever .  The service was great from start to finish.  Loved everything about it.  Looking forward to coming again soon.
Tommy N.,"Fredericksburg, VA",11,10,,4.0,8/10/2017,"The feel of the restaurant was great, I loved the design of it. The server was great and definitely knew how to give me enough info about the restaurant for my first time but not overload me with so many things. The food was good however I had the Peruvian quinoa and it was slightly salty and sour. It was overdressed in a sauce that overpowered the spinach and it only balanced well when I took a spoonful of quinoa. They have a large variety of foods so I'll definitely be back to try more!"
Adina R.,"Washington, DC",0,1,,1.0,11/26/2017,"We are extremely disappointed in our recent experience. We arrived to the restaurant hoping to watch our football game. There were about 4 people sitting at the bar and the restaurant was 1/4 full, if at all. We were looking forward to watching the game and getting great food. Unfortunately we were told that all of the TV's were pre-assigned with all of the games except for ours. The manager informed us he would not put the game on a single TV in the restaurant (inside or outside) because they were already selected. This was in spite of the fact there were plenty of TV's without patrons watching. This was after the games had begun. Extremely disappointed and will reconsider ever coming to this restaurant again. It's a shame. Have always had great experiences until now."
Alex C.,"Fredericksburg, VA",0,13,7,3.0,8/2/2017,"The best part of our meal was the beer. The food was good, but not excellent. I got really excited when I saw fried Brussels sprouts on the menu, but they disappointed; they weren't crispy, were way over seasoned, and the sauce was heavy on the mayonnaise. Skip them. Our burgers were tasty, but I wasn't a fan of the fries (they have some kind of coating on them). Our sever was nice, but I think there was some confusion with the team service. Next time we go back for a beer I think we'll try the pizza."
SMib E.,"King George, VA",0,41,,2.0,7/10/2017,"Our first time here tonight. The food was ok. Wait staff was ok. kitchen was so slow. I thought it was just us but everybody's meal was running late.  We sent back my wife's barbecue chicken because the Rice wasn't done. They were so slow replacing her meal that we got it to go and had dessert.  Check came and they double charged us for her meal; the original order and for the replacement.  Servers were friendly but incredibly slow. If they want to get customers in and out, they need to pick up the pace and get orders right the first time.  We downloaded their app when we arrived but deleted it. Don't think we'll be back. Sedona Tap house next time."
D T.,"Fredericksburg, VA",0,8,,1.0,7/15/2017,"Came here when they opened and truly enjoyed it.   We came back this evening, and the professional training staff had left. Waited for the wait staff, waited for drinks, waited for food, and then literally waited over 20 minutes for the check. I hope the managers can turn this new restaurant around, it would be sad to loose it."
Jessica N.,"Abingdon, MD",5,2,,5.0,8/10/2017,All I can say is yum yum yum. The servers are friendly and very helpful. Happy to see Fredericksburg finally get something new
Wendy M.,"Fredericksburg, VA",31,3,,5.0,9/2/2017,Amazing service and great burgers.  The staff was so on top of it!!!  Tons of choices for chow and beverages.
Sherry R.,"Spotsylvania, VA",1,5,1,5.0,8/4/2017,"Love this place...if you want a place where you have plenty of options then this is the place.  Love, love, love, their app also."
Michael B.,"Fredericksburg, VA",0,22,,1.0,8/2/2017,"The only reason this place is getting 1 Star is because you have to give something before continuing. This place is by far the absolutely worst place!! Service sucks, the Manager on duty refused to do anything!! 20 minutes before even getting drinks. Don't waste your time coming here. You won't get served. Should be closed in 2 months."
Chip A.,"Stafford, VA",0,1,,3.0,11/9/2017,Beer selection is Excellent.  Food is good. Service is very slow.  3 visits...same for all 3.
Kathleen F.,"Fredericksburg, VA",39,8,,3.0,7/29/2017,"Eh. We enjoyed the three in house brews we tried. The menu/food reminded me of a Ruby Tuesdays or a Chilis. It was fine just nothing I'd go back for. Also, I have a hard time with any menu that is a booklet of choices. Too many options."
Stephanie C.,"Fredericksburg, VA",0,7,,4.0,7/5/2017,"Second time at BJ's since the opening.  The first time tried the Pizza special and the second time the burgers. The food was good both times as well as the service. The BJ's craft beers are good as well.  The mobile pay option and the rewards program offer good perks and are convenient to use. My favorite thing is the salted caramel Pizookie. It's delicious, and you can get a free mini one to try if you join the rewards program."
Cynthia R.,"Fredericksburg, VA",0,14,,1.0,8/14/2017,"Don't expect the manager, Molly, to follow up on anything like sending you a courtesy gift card in the mail for having a messed up order three times in a row. This place just doesn't care. It's a beautiful looking restaurant with sub par service, an unorganized kitchen and ineffective management."
Seth S.,"Camp Hill, PA",2,9,2,5.0,7/12/2017,We ate here last night.  Almost no wait and great food and great service.  Our deep dish pizza was so hot we had to wait a few minutes to eat it.  Our Ahi salad was delicious. And half priced bottles of wine - I say yes.  Did I mention deep dish cookie with ice cream?!?!  Overall restaurant experience was very good for my first time.  I would definitely come back.
Kevin J.,"Spotsylvania, VA",38,3,,5.0,8/5/2017,"Dropped in to Bjs yesterday with the family and the food was great and everything came out to perfection. Also, the staff was very friendly and our Server Julius was excellent! He knew the menu and made some great recommendations. Ask for him when you go in!"
