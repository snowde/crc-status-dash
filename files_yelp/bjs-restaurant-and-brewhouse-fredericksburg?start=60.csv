Vincent O.,"Fredericksburg, VA",39,6,,4.0,7/7/2017,"Great food and atmosphere! We went on a Thursday, parking lot was full but the place is so big and there was room at the bar. The service was friendly and attentive. Our food order got messed up but the manager came by and fixed things. The food was great, especially the peanut butter smores pizookie. The also have a big menu and large beer selection. One issue, the servers bringing food to the bar never seemed to know who to deliver the food to. Anyway, will definitely go again."
Jason R.,"Indian Rocks Beach, FL",1,1,,5.0,7/3/2017,"They have been open for only a week, so slow service and mishaps can be expected while they work out the bugs. But the food and drinks were great!! We will definitely be going back again and again and again"
Liam C.,"Fredericksburg, VA",1,24,,2.0,9/3/2017,"The food is good and we have been here five times since it has opened. At first we chalked the issues up that it was new and they were working things out. It has been a couple of months and I am not so sure they are going to work things out. Every time we have been here we have had to ask for silverware.  The first couple of times the food came out and we still did not have silverware, we just assumed the waiter would bring it and now we just ask for it when the waiter takes our order. I have never been to a restaurant were you had to ask for silverware every time you go there. Tonight I will be honest we received the worst service so far. We would have stayed longer and ate and drank more if our waitress Shawna G had bothered to ever check on us. If we go back hopefully we can avoid her section."
Kristi C.,"Jacksonville, FL",39,3,,4.0,7/17/2017,"Having been to two other BJ's we were excited for this new one to open. There were a couple of things overlooked- I had a toothpick hidden in my salad -yikes - and my broccoli was basically raw on my main dish. Both of which I pointed out to the bartender, who said she'd tell the manager, but that either wasn't done or was ignored (I expected some minor form a compensation like a free beverage or similar). She did offer to recook new broccoli but wasn't sure that would be any better.  Overall, however, the experience was good. They were very busy and can see the kinks getting worked out. Parmesan crusted chicken is outstanding."
Paul A.,"Fredericksburg, VA",26,25,10,5.0,7/8/2017,The brew is great loved them all on the sampler something for every taste. The tavern pizzas are great we had the spicy pig. Servers were great! Join the loyalty club. We will be back actually invited family to meet us Monday.
Jeanne F.,"Fredericksburg, VA",0,9,,3.0,7/2/2017,"Friday, 30 June. A test. We arrived right around 4:30 and were happy to see a parking space because it was busy. Most of the customers appeared to be either outside or in the bar. I asked for a booth in a quietesh area because I enjoy talking with a friend over dinner. Our table turned out to be at the junction of the kitchen, the entrance to the restrooms, a server computer station, the corner where dining room servers picked up drinks, and the intersection of four aisles.Initially. None of this seemed to be too terribly awful, but as time passed and the confluence of all the activities ebbed and flowed, it was horrendous.  The appetizer--calamari--arrived almost before the words were out of our mouths and was good. Dinner service was another matter. From ordering to receiving it took close to 30 minutes. We made no special requests. With the dining space just beginning to fill up there was no reason for such a long wait. The salmon was scrumptious, and the burger appeared to be hand formed rather than frozen which is always appreciated. The fries were limp and certainly not anything I would want more of despite the offer of ""bottomless fries.""  The noise level was awful. The anticipated conversation was impossible.  What I disliked most was sharing my burger with the flies. There is a big section of wall left open for access to the patio area so the flies were all over the meals. This HAS to change or the Department of Health will be closing this place down. The staff was warm and friendly, the food was mostly good, and the location convenient. I'll give BJ's a few weeks to settle in and try it again, but right now Harry's Alehouse is my goto brew house. And the bartenders there make a fantastic perfect SoCo Manhattan!"
Jessica S.,"Locust Grove, VA",0,30,4,3.0,8/16/2017,"Service is lacking although well meaning ! Still much to be learned. Will come back for second review once the restaurants been around longer! Definitely should brush up on there knowledge of their steaks. Wrong order was brought to our table although cooked to our liking it was not the right cut of meet. The waiter apologized looked at receipt and said we did order the right steak showed us receipt and went to get right steak. Well their solution ... was to take the med rare prime rib brought to our table sear it ... then  hand it back to us ... Our original order a med rare ribeye . Unfortunately , the steak lost all juice and became dry from second cook. I'm also not a fan of the fries . I have enjoyed some of  the foods so far loved the brisket burger ! The sauce was on point !!! The wings were great even !  The hostesses did a great job dealing with weekend rush . Overall I would come again this place deserves a chance to grow into its own :)"
Daniel R.,"Manassas, VA",0,7,,1.0,8/12/2017,"So I've been here twice. First time was not pleasant. I sat at the bar and couldn't get a beer to save my life. Bartender was not busy and kept walking past me and my buddy. And just recently went with a group of friends and had honestly quite possibly the worst service of my life. Took 50 minutes for the server to bring us out most of our drinks. And he had forgotten mine again . Took another 10 minutes. So after an hour, all we had was our waters and a few beers. My friends left the table to go to the bar to get waters because we couldn't find our server anywhere before he arrived with 2 waters . Food took another 20 minutes and came out cold. We spoke to the manager and she was very nice and said we didn't have to pay for the food. I didn't even order food. I just wanted my tab after the first 20 minutes and couldn't get the server to do that !! The manager was super nice and handled it as best she could. So over all. The service is awful !!!!  Beer and food are good ( from what I've heard )"
Denise S.,"Fredericksburg, VA",0,5,1,1.0,8/12/2017,I would give this place no stars but have to click one. I've waited 50 mins just to get a cup of water and it wasn't even busy. Service is horrible. Asked to speak to the manager and they never came to the table. Time is now 10:30 still waiting for food after waiting just about an hour for drinks.
Mary O.,"Fredericksburg, VA",0,5,,2.0,8/2/2017,"Last night was the third time I have eaten at BJ's since they opened, and after what I experienced last night I was compelled to write a review. The first time I went for dinner last Tuesday, food was excellent, service was slow, but it was the dinner rush so that was understandable. Went back the follow day for lunch, it took almost two hours from the time we were seated until we paid our check, it was not busy whatsoever. With that being said, again the food was excellent, the service was horrible, only saw our server three times: order, food, check. Went again last night with someone who wanted to try it out, we decided to sit outside. WORST IDEA EVER!!! Do not sit outside, the service inside is bad enough, but the service on the patio area is atrocious. We were told to seat ourselves by the hostess, which we did, no one came to the table for 10 minutes, so I went inside and asked for a server, another 5 minutes go by, we get a server. He comes to the table and says ""are you ready to order?"" We had not been given menus or silverware or had drink orders taken, so I laughed and asked for menus. After another 10 minutes, I went and got our party menus. The server comes back without the menus we had requested and bluntly asked again if we were ready to order, we ordered our drinks, appetizer, and meals. Our appetizer came out before our drinks did (we ordered a water, and a pepsi), I asked the server if we could have silverware (our original server did not bring the app out to the table) 5 minutes go by, no silverware, app is now cold, I again have to get up and go inside to get silverware. Our original server comes to the table and asked how the app was, and we had to ask for our drinks which had still not been served. Our drinks arrived at the same time as our meals, I got the prime rib dip with sweet potato fries. My meal looked like it had been placed on the plate by a toddler, the sandwich was soggy, ice cold, in disarray and I had a total of 7 sweet potato fries. For a $15 dollar sandwich and $2 up-charge for the sweet potato fries I was shocked. My friend got the mushroom swiss burger and was served a steaming hot burger and a mountain of french fries. I would have asked for a manager but the server never returned to our table until I asked someone else running food for our check, and at that point we were just ready to leave. Sadly I doubt I will be returning to BJ's. I have eaten in two other BJ's locations in the past and they were phenomenal, sadly the Fredericksburg location is nothing like the other two I have been to. After being open more than a month, I can't really see a good excuse for such poor service and I was pleased with the food until the slop I was served last night. I hope this place can get it together before it really gets a bad rap."
Ki Ki M.,"District Heights, MD",0,6,1,4.0,7/30/2017,I ordered over the phone. Seems like it took forever for my food to come up even after i got there. And i had too wait a little longer be cause they didn't have everything in my orfer.  Granted to place was crowded and the wait time was 50 mins (listening to the hostess).... The good was great tho.
Brian M.,"King George, VA",21,4,,3.0,7/26/2017,Although the manager tried to make things right. The food in my opinion was par. I really do though like how the manager and staff tried to fix the problem.
Jennifer A.,"Centreville, VA",0,1,,1.0,7/21/2017,"First of all, our server Bethani had more interest in joking around and talking to people than she did on serving us. We got our appetizers and entrees before we even got waters to drink. I finally had to walk inside to the bar and ask for waters my own. My friends tacos were cold and I didn't get the right side. While Bethani did give us a discount she continued to blame everyone else instead of taking responsibility. This was one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had and will 100% not be back to this location. Food is over priced and services is horrendous."
Tessa T.,"Fredericksburg, VA",0,2,,5.0,7/8/2017,"Had dinner here this evening and had a wonderful experience! Although they were very busy, every employee we interacted with was kind and helpful. We had mixed drinks and beer which were all great. The food  and the atmosphere were also wonderful but our waiter Chris was by far the best part of our experience. He was friendly and helpful and treated us as loyal customers even though it was our first time at this establishment. We will but returning for the many reasons listed above but mostly because of how well we were treated by our waiter Chris."
Peachy K.,"Fredericksburg, VA",0,5,13,3.0,7/1/2017,"Felt the food pricing was a little on the high side. This isn't California. The avocado egg rolls were delicious. The atmosphere/decor was inviting. However, because of the high ceiling, it was a little loud and hard to hear your table companions. The biggest issue was that ALL of the staff was training one other person, each. There were WAY too many staff in there. So we constantly felt like we were being hovered over, not as in, ""Can I get you something,"" but just  because the mass quantities of staff were everywhere, all the time. Training in shifts would have been better than having every single server in that place, also have a trainee tailing them. It also seemed like the servers were assigned tables all over the place instead of each having a traditional section where their tables were all near each other. As a former server, that was weird to me and seemed inefficient. Our drinks,  a sparkling water and plain water were brought 5 minutes apart. Also weird, considering that the plain water was the one that was delayed. We didnt really try too much food as the avocado egg roll appetizer filled us up pretty well. We ended up just sharing a boneless buffalo wings. Both items were well done. I look forward to trying a pizza or maybe, the parmesan crusted chicken next time. But, please, for the love of God, cut down on how many staff you have training all at once. It was like a zoo in there. Way too much going on with that, to relax and really enjoy your meal. All in all, BJ's is still working out the kinks, a week after opening, but they show strong promise!"
