Hank P.,"Fresno, CA",0,19,6,5.0,12/21/2017,"Out of the big box restaurants...this is my place! If I am meeting friends for drinks and food, there is no where else that I want to go.  We meet up once a month at the same table ( if possible ). Have the same drinks, same dinner and best part the same waitress.  She is amazing!  Best service hands down.  See you again next month!!!"
Michael R.,"Fresno, CA",17,85,86,5.0,9/6/2017,"The staff was very welcoming and friendly. We got sat down and Tyler our server was very pleasant. We were welcomed by the supervisor Michael and the service and genuine friendliness of Michael was great! It's very rare you meet a manager/supervisor who genuinely cares about their patrons. The food was great! Our two year old loved their pizza, my husband ordered the ahi tuna salad and said it was great tasting. I ordered the half rack of baby backs with the cheesy mashed potatoes: overall the food didn't disappoint us at all!  What was pleasant, as should be expected by any hospitality business, was the above and beyond service by the staff and the manager Michael. Thank you guys for everything!"
ルービー,"Fresno, CA",46,60,153,2.0,8/1/2017,"THE WORST restaurant experience ever! I understand they were busy but they had some food issues too. I can let go of the fact that they forgot to give us silverwares....but no sauce on my pasta is a little too much. Apology accepted by the manager and the server, but I'd still give them 2 stars. This place needs a push for improvement. 1st: they didnt give us silverware to eat with. 2nd: when they served the food, my mom asked for silverwares, the person who took the food to the table just looked at my mom and said they'll give us some, but NO ONE EVER CAME BACK. 15 mins later, food had gone cold, some of us still couldnt eat. Two in our table who had salad were able to eat since they were given a fork...the rest of us couldnt. 3rd: they got my order wrong. I ordered chicken alfredo without broccoli (substitute with asparagus since my stomach is sensitive to broccoli)....they gave me chicken alfredo WITH some broccoli (which is fine...i can just remove them and my husband ate em), and some asparagus, but WITHOUT the SAUCE. I've been to other BJ's before and this is the first time I've ever had a bad experience with them, and it happens to be the worst restaurant experience I've had yet. It took a while for them to get the manager. We had to flag them a couple times. :( The manager personally apologized and had the server retake some of our orders since theyve gone cold. Unfortunately, I had to leave at a certain time, and couldnt stay to eat by the time my replacement order got to the table. I ate the pasta when I got home and it tasted good. :)"
Anh N.,"Fresno, CA",148,34,76,4.0,12/23/2017,Good service and decent food. I like to come here because it's kid friendly. The kids can be loud and it wouldn't be a problem. The waitress we had was fast and attentive even though she was busy.
Lauren M.,"Fresno, CA",408,72,80,4.0,10/31/2017,"This place is usual go to if I want to go to a sit down restaurant. It's only a mile away from my apartment so it's very convenient for me. My favorite things to order are the stuffed potatoes, pizza, chicken alfredo, chicken wings, and the monkey bread pizookie!! They also have a really good Wild Berry mojito. They usually have deals going on and a pretty good lunch special everyday. One day I want to come for breakfast, I've heard it's really good. The service is always exceptional even when it's really busy."
Jeremy C.,"Fresno, CA",17,129,79,4.0,11/27/2017,"I like this place. I really enjoy their lunch menu. If you're in the mood for a filling meal, stop on by. The wait staff is always friendly. My favorite is the personal one topping pizza with a side salad off the lunch menu with an ice cold drink. Don't forget their infamous pizookie."
Lisa D.,"Fresno, CA",31,412,544,2.0,7/2/2017,"We were seated promptly and service was fair. She did forget to check on a sauce we asked for, but it wasn't anything too important. She went on lunch halfway through and the waitress who took over was in such a rush, that we felt neglected and at one point, she tried to clear a plate that I was still working on. It is common courtesy to ask if the patron is done eating before doing so. I enjoyed my clam chowder bread bowl. The bread was fresh and had the perfect chewy, sourdough consistency. My mom and I both ordered the sirloin and man, never again. Both pieces were as dry as bark. It took us everything we had to swallow more than a few small bites. Luckily, their amazing Beignet ended our dinner on a better note."
Majid K.,"Fresno, CA",237,70,1,4.0,3/5/2017,"I've never been disappointed with anything I've had here. The Chicago Style pizza is the only one in Fresno I know of. I really like the mergarita pizza (basil and tomato). The desert menu includes the pizookie. It's a miniature pizza pan with a cookie baked in it, topped with ice cream and whipped cream.  The also serve their own brewed beer. They also have a full bar in the case you are not feeling like having a beer. The restaurant is in a good spot. In the parking lot shared with a few other restaurants and Fashion Fair mall, the only time parking is an issue is during Holiday Shopping season.  This place is big and has a huge bar area. It still can be difficult to get a table on the weekends. Especially when a popular team is playing. If you are patient you will be seated. That being said, we go with a Plan B already in mind."
Stephanie M.,"Fresno, CA",16,45,58,4.0,1/15/2017,"Although the food was average, what really sets this place apart is their staff. I really wish I would have taken a picture or at least the name of our waitress but she was really the best! She was young, shortish brown hair, and served our friends 40th birthday dinner. She was attentive the entire time. She made small talk and was just a wonderful server.  The other staff members assisting were wonderful as well. Even on a Saturday night, with 20 ppl in the lobby waiting for seats, we never felt like we were being unattended. Thanks for the wonderful service and a very memorable birthday for our friend."
janelle r.,"Monterey, CA",22,92,20,3.0,7/28/2017,Don't order the margarita flat bread tastes like cardboard absolutely no I mean no flavor Italians would turn over in their grave no tomatoes even and I could see a slight glimps of red sauce  Don't order your burger with thousand island on the side They will drench it in the dressing then accompany the wet slop with a side of dressing like we would need even more Thanks for the thousand island soup burger Disgusting waste of time and money
Frank J.,"Long Beach, CA",2,1,,1.0,9/24/2017,"So here i sit since 10am at the bar watching the NFL games. I have spent over $60 and now they start inviting more families into the ""bar area"". By families, I mean extremely young children into the bar area. Who really thinks this is ok? Now Cory, the manager, comes up to me at about 1pm to tell me not to swear since this is a ""family resturant"". Let me tell you this, BJ's is a brewery and restaurant! Sitting young child in a bar area is wrong automatically. Never come here if you expect to watch a game in a bar atmosphere. Only come here if expect a chucky cheese type of atmosphere cause thats how this place is run. I would rather give zero stars if that was an option."
Lori H.,"Fresno, CA",88,92,107,3.0,6/21/2017,"I've been to BJ's several times with Hubs and/or with friends. It's a chain restaurant, but as we all know...some are better than others and some others, well they plain suck, so it's always good to know which ones to avoid, right? Right. This was a visit to the Fresno location near Fashion Fair Mall. We usually avoid the location like the plague only due to the crowds and well...we're not really fans of people, in general so we try to avoid them at all costs.  We came on a weekday around 2pm, pretty steady inside, not a ghostown and that was all good - BUT....my god, the fact that they seat full-grown-full-size adults into those tiny little wall tables for two(when there were PLENTY of regular-sized tables available) - pretty much will fit a 95lb girl-child and her millenial bf who pretty much counts on his beard to make up for his barely 160lb frame while wearing skinny jeans and flaunting a man-bun. Yeah THAT ain't my Hubs. He pretty much gets called ""Stone Cold"" and mistaken for Steve Austin almost every day, which cracks me up, but it is uncanny - THAT being said...he's a big dude and likes his elbow space. I'm 5'10"" and every time set us in these tiny little seating areas...Hubs needs his elbow room and there just AIN'T any of that in those tiny little 2-person booths. We usually have to request to be seated elsewhere due to that, but Hubs was just annoyed already (yeah, I was too, hell yeah - HATE IT but get tired of having to f@#$ing ask every single damn time!). So we sit in the magical tiny seating booth and start to look at the menu - it was mid-day so I was going for lite (and I had to keep my purse on my lop as there was NO where to put it - and I don't put my bags on the floor, no thank you) - I ended up just getting an order a fries as I LOVE LOVE LOVE those skinny tiny crispy little shoestring fries and love they give you a big basket of them...and Hubs had the chopped bbq chicken salad (whch is ALWAYS good) - everything came quickly and the salad was beautiful and Hubs was stoked.  And then.....I saw the fries. Wha????? Wait....The fries were NO LONGER......the tiny skinny crispy fries - they've changed them up. Oh yay - the ONE thing I wanted and they managed to screw that up. Plus, they brought about a handful in an order. Needless to say....completely disheartened and irritated beyond explanation - those fries were the cornerstone of many a sandwich. And those fries MADE the perfect companion to those sliders. These were frozen (despite the effort to seem not frozen) and barely fried. Delivered lukewarm (odd since there wasn't any wait for the food, really, as it wasn't busy or crowded). There was a complete lack of crispness to them...so yeah, I didn't even finish them as it was just lukewarm pasty-blech. I did let our server know how disappointing it was...but she said it was a change they made recently - not really with a reason, that she was aware of anyway. Horrible decision and honestly - one of the things I say to Hubs on a fairly regular basis ""babe, I'm in the mood for some GOOD fries...where should we go?"" - yeah BJ's is now permanently OFF that list. I won't even bother ordering fries there at this point. They were awful - and exactly like just about every chain restaurant.  PS: I gave 3 stars due to the server (she was awesome) and the chopped bbq chicken salad. If I could give LESS and have a clean conscience, I would...only because unless it's 2 or 1 star, it gets kinda glossed over...but there ya have it."
Destinee M.,"Fresno, CA",77,8,20,3.0,11/1/2017,Good food. I always go for one of the burgers on the menu as I haven't always been pleased with other things I've ordered. Service isn't great and there's almost always a significant amount of wait time. That isn't just this BJ's though; it's a popular restaurant everywhere so it's understandable why the service is the way it is. They're simply busy with many tables. Must try the Pizookie: cookies and creme is my personal favorite.
Rekha S.,"Sanger, CA",122,147,898,4.0,1/17/2017,"Couples night out BJs was the spot tonight. Food was okay drinks were good! Pizookie cookies was amazing, chose the trio enjoyed all three varieties. Service was decent."
Faby V.,"San Francisco, CA",0,10,5,5.0,10/14/2017,Great service and food! Took family and friends there after a baptism and was very happy with the decision. I like that their food selection taps into most eating preferences. Beer was nice and cold and my iced tea was wonderful! Very happy!
Melanie N Rodger A.,"Clovis, CA",34,18,35,3.0,10/3/2017,Honestly if you are coming here for the brew than that is 5 stars as they have a great craft selection and their bar is fun. The food here though isn't good at all and the quality has decreased overtime. Service isn't always the best and they are way over packed. Fun place to drink but will pass on the food.
Ahmay V.,"Fresno, CA",25,49,139,2.0,4/16/2017,"Waitor was cool.  Food was good except the ribeye steak was way too salty.   Had to scrape off excess seasoning.  Could have ask for new steak, but didn't. It's about first impression rt?"
James O.,"Fresno, CA",594,71,85,5.0,5/31/2017,"The food is always good here. The service is pretty good as well. They make the best root beer and pizza. The ambiance is always very nice, the dim lightings really makes is a great place for dates."
Jeanna P.,"Clovis, CA",3,28,19,3.0,10/14/2017,"Called ahead in order to be seated quicker.  Due to the 25 minute wait we sat at the bar and ordered drinks & appetizers, the server was quick and polite. Once our table was ready we moved with our drinks and appetizers. Waited patiently for about 45 minutes without one person greeting us.  The waitress walked all around us but never spoke to us. Finally after an hour of no service my husband went to speak to manager, who very graciously apologized.  After this, the manager made sure we had a great waitress. The waitress was Chalena, she was very sweet, attentive, and quick. I watched her help customers in more than her section. If we had the service we got at the end I would definitely have given five stars because the food was great.  The service recovered thanks to the manager and Chalena."
Alexander S.,"Sacramento, CA",22,55,36,5.0,5/20/2017,"Every year we come here for the CIF State Championship High School swim meet, hosted at Clovis West High.  We bring down a team of about 20 high schoolers, and this is where we eat each night. They're super accommodating with splitting the bills, seating the large group as long as we call ahead, and providing excellent service.  The food is fantastic as always - I love their prime rib dip and their wings.  If you've got room for dessert, the pizookies are well worth it - or get the 3 pizookie sampler to share. It's delicious!"
Serenity E.,"Fresno, CA",21,85,100,4.0,3/9/2017,Went here for a quick lunch date with my husband. We ordered soup and salad. Service was great! It was very busy. Tomato soup was amazing! Broccoli cheese soup was amazing.! My husbands BBQ salad was okay. The low calorie kale salad was not good. I felt like I could taste dirt in my salad. I wouldn't recommend it. Still enjoy the rest of the food here. Used to love the broccoli alfredo chicken and cheese baked potatoes but I don't think they have it on their menu anymore. The pazookies are amazing! Love their pizza!!
Selena N.,"Fresno, CA",52,174,228,4.0,9/6/2016,"My visit was extremely pleasant today! Everything from the timelines of being seated to food being brought out. Our hostess and server was very polite. Decided to stop in for an early dinner and ordered the Asian Chopped Salad. The salad had great flavor and the chicken extremely moist! With only 540 calories it was tasty and I definitely enjoyed it. My only suggestion would be if you don't like your salads overly dressed I would recommend asking for it light or dressing on the side. We also ordered the Santa Fe Salad, the flavor wasn't quite there for that salad. I wouldn't order the Santa Fe again. Staples would be the Asian chopped salad and berry burst cider!"
Veronica H.,"Visalia, CA",0,6,,3.0,9/2/2017,"This place is hit n miss, been here several times and I have no idea what causes them to be either really slow, not very attentive and the food being good or horrible. Things seem to happen busy or not busy, so not sure if it just depends who serving and cooking but they are not consistent. Broccoli cheddar, pizza and the pizookie seem to be always good. We've pretty much given up on this place though as somewhere we would love to go to ehh maybe ."
Molly Y.,"Merced, CA",1,70,2,3.0,8/28/2017,"On Saturday, some dear friends of mine wanted to meet up for lunch, they were coming in from out of town and since I had been wanting to try this place... suggested it. We arrived about 11 so we were seated right away. Our waitress was awesome!  As for my meal... I ordered the California Chicken Club with a bowl of Clam Chowder. The sandwich wasn't as great as I had hoped however the soup was delicious.  Will go back someday but not anytime soon. However, I will try something else next time."
Doug L.,"Fresno, CA",4,25,8,2.0,4/23/2017,Tried the new burger with th chili verde on top.  The chili sauce tastes like they poured jalapeño juice from the jar to season it.  It was far too vinegar to me.  The staff and waitress were nice but meal didn't work.
Laura R.,"Hesperia, CA",0,2,,1.0,11/5/2017,Worst service ever last night after the football game! Do not plan to return here again. Two weekends of poor service is not acceptable!
Audra S.,"Clovis, CA",71,132,993,5.0,12/8/2015,"Came in for lunch and seated myself at a booth in the bar area. I was originally hesitant to try for lunch due to time constraints, but I got in and out in half an hour.  My server, Walter, had a lot to do with that--fast, friendly, efficient (I left him a nice tip). He quickly offered the ranch and cheese with the pizza order and brought out the check quickly after offering dessert, ""no rush, but in case you're in a hurry"" (which I was).  The food was its original delicious self; my GF pizza was crunchy, cheesy, hot, and flavorful. My small can (and will) easily make two meals for me. I will admit, $12.95 is a lot for a small, 8-piece pie, but it's worth it. I like their ranch; its homemade and not sweet. Though I opted out of the gluten-free pizookie for dessert, I highly recommend it. I promise, you cannot tell it's GF.  Overall, another great visit. And now I know I can come in for lunch at 12:30. :)"
Kat T.,"Fresno, CA",3,28,20,2.0,5/6/2016,"If you review the previous comments and ratings I have given BJs in the last two years, you will see that quite recently my husband and I have not been enjoying our date afternoons here of late. And for many reasons. The main, of which as far as I can tell is there is a HUGE issue with the local restaurant management as far as:  1: There is just not enough servers and WAY too many hosts during lunch and dinner hour.  And for the love of all that is Holy, HIRE SOME DAMN BUSSERS!  Seriously; as it is I can see your servers sweat, pant, and hustle trying to serve a half full house with only less than a third if the amount of employees on floor needed to efficiently serve all of them, before every one walking in is waiting on not only to be seated, but also waiting 25-30 minutes for a drink because your server is trying to clean up the table and has not even had the time to write down your order yet!  Stop being a bunch of cheap asshole capitalists and take responsibility, HIRE BUSSERS!  2: Morale in general with every employee is so low you can drag your tits on it. ( I wish I were joking ) EVERYONE, is working so damn hard and clearly no one gets recognized for shit. I have been there, I can see it. I would never work for your company. It is clear that pure profit is the only thing that matters. Service to your patrons and proper management to your employees is a clear waste of time.  3: The Chefs in the back give zero fucks about their jobs. All the food is either overcooked, raw in the middle, or they mess up the entire ticket. No matter what something is always wrong! And it will take 25-30 minutes to get it fixed, only to have it overcooked and dry as hell, or bland and still raw.  This is a HUGE SLAP IN THE FACE OF THE CUSTOMER. Is BJs supposed to be a restaurant and brew house superior to most here in Fresno? Is it not supposed to have at least an inkling of decent standards? Maybe even, supposed to be considered swank, high quality, and an experience to remember?  Your cuisine ( if it can even be called that because your cooks and Chefs can't even cook on a DENNYS scale.) is priced at anywhere from $9.99 to $25.00 per entre! Why would my husband $15.99  bison burger come out burnt!? McDonalds would have been better!  So WHY, pray tell; would I rate you even a 2 stars?  Well, because not only do I submit my review and experiences here on YELP. But lucky for you guys, my husband happens to know the management running the regional BJs. And in response to our last submission we spoke at length with Dustin from the BJs corporate office and in deep regret with the awful experiences we have been receiving from our ONLY local BJs brewery we received a $25.00 gift card and a Free Pizookie coupon as an apology.  THAT  is why you get at least 2 stars."
Miranda C.,"Tulare, CA",39,1,,2.0,8/25/2017,"I went and it was super busy, no big deal. But the experience was decent. Weren't checked up on that often, which I sometimes prefer. I got a honey brisket burger (or something like that). But the edges of the burger were burnt. I only ate half and took the rest home. Ate it the next day for lunch and have been up all night with food poisoning."
Abby A.,"Sanger, CA",27,9,1,1.0,7/25/2017,Ordered their chili tonight. Disappointing. It looked exactly like and tasted exactly like Dennison's canned chili.
D. A.,"Elk Grove, CA",72,131,234,2.0,9/13/2016,"Great BJ... + Nice decor. + Nice flirty staff. + A big beer list. + A big big novel of a menu. + Open late if desperately hungry and needs ta eat. A Number 3... - This coroporate eatery needs to recognize, it's no better than Denny's food. The only difference is, that BJ's has better ketchup and condiment packets than Denny's in their food. - With the prices BJ's charges people, the recipes need to be seriously upped. BJ's has Folsom fooled (well, *cough cough* they fooled ME twice). - Safety hazard: The floors have been greasy slippery. - This BJ's location's wifi really really sucks. - BJ's needs to improve their rotating taps - get some of the racier local stuff in there i.e. Track 7, North Coast, Ovila (Sierra Nevada).  - BJ's own mircro-booze is meh, kinda flat. Even their stouts are underwhelming."
Eva G.,"La Jolla, CA",206,114,121,4.0,5/19/2016,"Loved all of the food here... We had wine, cosmos, and more appetizers than you can probably count. Next time we will definitely not order all of our 6 appetizers as the two of us didn't touch two of the six plates. Loved the pepperoni flat bread, the lettuce wraps, the Brussel sprouts, and probably my favorite - the stuffed mushrooms."
Latreece H.,"Fresno, CA",0,2,,1.0,7/18/2017,"Food was so gross, the alcoholic drinks tasted like pure water, rude staff, over priced. Never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever again. Don't waste your money or time here"
Spencer S.,"Sacramento State, Sacramento, CA",0,4,1,1.0,9/30/2017,"TERRIBLE SERVICE! Came here yesterday night (Friday night) and it was insanely busy. I wasn't surprised I mean, it was a Friday night. However, upon walking in we were not greeted nor acknowledged by the hosts. My friend and I made our way to the bar because seating was obviously going to be a problem. It took five mins after sitting to be offered a menu and for our drink orders to be taken. My friend and I took awhile ordering because we were indecisive. The bar staff only checked to see if we were ready to order once and they ignored us once we were actually ready. It was ridiculous. Our food took forever to be ready. Especially considering we only ordered appetizers and a pazookie. Honestly, so many people on staff yet obviously not enough to ensure their guests are being looked after. We asked for our check and were given SO Much sass. Guess they couldn't wait to get rid of us. Furthermore, terrible service.  The  food was okay. But honestly could've done without the cavalier disregard for service exhibited by the staff working."
Jesse G.,"Madera, CA",31,49,,2.0,2/19/2017,Unfortunately this visit was just ok. If I could I would of gave it 2&1/2 stars but u can't so here goes Penelope and Brandon were supposed to be serving us but we never saw Brandon. I don't know if he was new but that left everything on Penelope and I think she had too many tables.  Had to wait for condiments and didn't get our drinks refilled until I asked.  The burgers and fries we ordered were good but the calamari we ordered wasn't crispy and it was chewy.   We did eat it because we were hungry and I don't trust sending food back.  She did her best but they were busy and no help.  Hopefully management will help out with more staff.
Sarah B.,"Clovis, CA",4,36,41,4.0,7/10/2017,"Only went here because we had a gift card, good opportunity to try. We got there about 2:00 pm on a Monday, so was seated immediately although it was busy! Our waiter was super nice and helpful. Hubby and I both ordered burgers with fries. Burgers were very good, but the fries were so gross. I don't know if it's the oil they used or what! I tried using ranch and ketchup. Didn't work. Couldn't eat. But beyond the gross fries, the service was excellent and fast! If I ever go there again, going to try the pizza. That looked good!"
Yaman A.,"Fresno, CA",46,3,,2.0,2/3/2017,"Called in and asked how long of a wait it would be and they said 30-35 minutes but shorter if I leave my name. I decided to leave my name and I arrived 25 minutes later. Upon arrival, they told me it would be a 35 minute wait. I decided to go across the street and check out the mall while I wait and they would text me when table is ready. They texted me and I replied after 5 minutes (when I noticed my phone) and they told me I would have to wait ANOTHER 20 minutes. Finally got seated and got a coke and now I've been waiting for a refill for 15 minutes. Horrible service, hire more people if you need it"
John S.,"Hell, Norway",0,4,,1.0,6/29/2017,So I came in for wings.  1 hour later no wings.  I guess they have to kill the chickens first and then cook them.   I will not return here ever EVER
Yoko C.,"Fresno, CA",166,112,169,4.0,8/5/2016,Great place to eat and drink.  It's a great way to end a work day.  Food was great and so was the beer.
Roger G.,"Fresno, CA",1,10,5,3.0,5/13/2017,Above average chain food. Their pizza is great. Very good beer selection. Clean restaurant and our server was nice even when it got hectic.
