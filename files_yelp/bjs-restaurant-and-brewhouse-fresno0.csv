Joe T.,"Temecula, CA",0,465,44,1.0,11/22/2014,"Been to several BJ's and am sorry that I tried this one tonight.   Called in the order and they said 15 mins. I was there in 10. 10 mins later pizza was done. Got to our hotel 5 mins later and the pizza was cold. I don't mean ""cold"" I mean not cooked cold. The cheese was not even melted!!!!!!!  Still cold and the cheese was in pieces.  I was tired and didn't feel like going back to complain.   What a waste of $20. Check your box before you leave I guess."
Bill D.,"Clovis, CA",2,3,9,5.0,3/6/2015,Love this place.  Staff makes us feel at home.  Also the food is great also. We love going for happy hour on fridays.  Nice place to come after shopping at Fashion Fair.  Never been disappointed.
Darlenne R.,"Fresno, CA",22,4,,3.0,12/6/2014,"I just want to begin this review by saying that I LOVE this restaurant and I have NEVER left disappointed until tonight! The food was EXCEPTIONAL  the waiter was wonderful and attentive BUT the hosts were incredibly RUDE they we honestly the worst hosts I have ever had to endure in the 3 years that bjs has been my favorite restaurant, they were rude not only to me but to my girlfriend that was obviously sick with a cold (I go there at least 3 times a month) one host even had the audacity to confront me in the parking lot after we walked out about talking to he manager and condicendinly finished the conversation with ""your very welcome"" tonight was the biggest disappointment I've ever had at bjs. Please management, be a little more selective of the hosts you hire. Everything was perfect until the last 10 min. So unprofessional it was honestly a disgrace to the company."
Adam K.,"Fresno, CA",0,1,1,1.0,2/22/2015,"This place was a good place! But after the service I got today i will not be coming back! The host was really rude to some of the guests in my party. The waitress and her service was horrible, 3 of my party guest had to wait for there food a long time while the rest of us got ours. When we were done I felt like they were discriminating towards us because we're of different ethnicities. A couple of their employees sat at a table across from us and stared. I can see that they were talking about us. This was the worst service I have ever got at this place."
Diane L.,"Honolulu, HI",1,55,6,4.0,8/13/2014,"Ordered the kale and brussel sprout salad. It was very good. I forgot to tell my waiter to leave out the cucumbers, but when I ate the salad, I couldn't taste them because of the great combination of flavours in the salad. I loved the sports atmosphere. A lot of people seemed to be eating the deep dish pizza; I hope to try the pizza next time I go."
Hoang D.,"Redwood City, CA",1,12,2,1.0,10/30/2014,"use to enjoy BJ's happy hour and food, but stopped coming for a few months. Went back a couple days ago for the giants WS and will not be going to any BJ's anymore. Happy hour food has increased (understand), but quality still needs to be there. Food was dry and portions have been skimped. Example: when you order wings you kind of expect at least a stock of carrot and celery (they use to). Just very hard dry wings, pot stickers were pre heated and kept under a heat lamp. Pizza/flatbread is still ok, but limited during happy hour (never use to be).  Yard House is the place to go."
Carol C.,"Surprise, AZ",0,2,,1.0,4/17/2014,First of all the wait was extremely long for no reason. Then the orders came wrong after an extended amount of time. Children's menus weren't brought to the table. Food was cold and brought to the table 10 minutes apart for each person. I do not recommend this restaurant!!!
Austin B.,"Los Alamitos, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/29/2016,this place sucked. service was AWFUL. if I could give it zero stars I would. I wouldn't recommend to anyone. thanks for nothing. don't ever come here.
Scott G.,"Clovis, CA",3,4,4,5.0,12/15/2013,"Now this place is becoming a favorite of mine. Great food and im very picky (try the jambalaya), good beer selection, friendly saff and decent service. Its a great place for whatever occasion: birthday dinner, night out with friends drinking, date night you name it."
Christina C.,"Fresno, CA",3,50,3,2.0,10/20/2014,"I've been to several BJ's all across California. I would have to say the Fresno location has been the most underwhelming. Food is decent; nothing has ever been mind blowing and there have been several things that have not been very appetizing. My husband and I came in on 10/11/14 for dinner around 6:30. We were seated within 10 minutes. Our server was extremely behind and took quite some time to get to our table. The service the whole night was slow and quite awful, but we overlooked this because we weren't in a rush and were there to enjoy eachother. We got our appextizer and my dinner salad all before we even got silverware. Our server never seemed to show up unless she was bringing us drinks or the one time she acually checked on us 15 minutes after we got out food. The food itself was ver underwhelming. I was absolutely appalled that they charge $3.25 for a side dinner salad that literally was so tiny my husband refused to even take a bite of it because it was so small. I should have sent it back, but with the lack of service, I'd probably still be waiting. Pizza was fine, nothing exciting or tremendous. My husband's fish taco's were the same. If it hadn't taken so long to actually get our food with the slow service we may have ordered a pizookie which is the one thing you can count on being good. We instead opted to go order Cheesecake from Cheesecake Factory to take home. Would I never come here again? No, I would. But not at my recommendation."
Cody H.,"Fresno, CA",24,27,2,5.0,8/20/2014,"Excellent. The pizookies are good enough to bang. Simply a delight. I recommend coming here if you want a general food place with a lot of options. Hey, show up for the beers and food options, stay for the pizooks. And hey I'm telling you: I stayed."
R R.,"Tollhouse, CA",2,10,,2.0,1/7/2016,"If you like nuked food, I might like it better!"
Brittney S.,"Fresno, CA",89,31,29,1.0,8/15/2013,"Do NOT get the artichoke heart on any pizza here. It's from a can and VERY salty. In fact that's all it is, salt, that you taste! Usually this is my favorite establishment to dine at, but this was the worst experience. I let the waiter know how bad it was affecting my meal but she didn't do anything about it because it was canned (they aren't responsible). So we got nothing free or replaced or an apology. The waiter didn't have a name tag and the manager didn't introduce herself so I have no clue what her name was. Once we complained the waiter tried to ignore us when we tried to pay. I'm just glad I had a beer in me or else I would be more pissed. I am so disappointed. I have always suggested this restaurant before but maybe I should rethink what I tell people by this experience. A waste of A pizza and time and nothing but wanting to throw up feeling after. So enjoy! (Go for the drinks-if Brandon is tending-anyone else sucks or is slow)"
Richard C.,"Fresno, CA",0,8,2,4.0,11/21/2015,"The food was great. The atmosphere was great. Tyler was a really great waiter. Would recommend him again. The wait was kind of long. We ordered ice cream and when we got it, it was in a puddle, so it was kind of upsetting. But overall, great environment, great food, good customer service. Would come here again."
Nicole A.,"Fresno, CA",28,106,16,5.0,5/23/2014,The prices at BJ's are very reasonable for the amount and quality of food. Only on my first time here did I leave dissatisfied with my meal. The twenty or more later visits have always been very pleasant with delicious food. I've never received a rude or inattentive server as I have experienced in several other restaurants.  Dishes I would recommend:  -Caesar salad  -Clam chowder (get it in a cheap combo with the salad)  -Steak salad  -Angel hair pasta with shrimp -Deep-dished pizzas are a crowd favorite as well as the pizookie.
Janelle W.,"Fresno, CA",129,12,,1.0,11/15/2014,"Went there for a fundraiser that a friend of mine was having (where they give a percentage of the food sales) and I had been there a couple years back. The place was not incredibly packed and there were still tables in the regular dinning area, however, we were sat in the bar area. It was loud and I was constantly being hit by people AND SERVERS walking by. I ordered hot tea and had to ask our server three times to bring me more honey. I had also ordered a glass of water and it took him three times to finally bring it out.  When our food came, I was so disappointed. I had ordered a regular hamburger and fries and my fries were very cold. The burger itself was all bread, had a tiny piece of lettuce, was dry (I asked for the ""special sauce"" on the side, but the menu said it came with mayo), and was unbelievably greasy. On top of that, it was really expensive! I don't remember their food being this bad or their service being subpar. Needless to say, my friends and I were thoroughly unimpressed and will NEVER eat there again. I swear, I could get a better meal from Wendy's!"
David O.,"Civic Center, San Francisco, CA",80,7,4,1.0,11/2/2014,"We had a group of 14. We were seated rather quickly on a relatively busy Sunday everywhere else. We were seated within a relatively quick amount of time. Our server was not very attentive initially, it took him 10 minutes to bring out everyone's drinks, then he took everyone's orders. He served someone at our table an appetizer without giving any of the table silverware. He was gone again for roughly 15 minutes before someone from our table had to get a manager involved to bring out refills and silverware. Our food finally arrived, and during our food, another server spilled drinks on someone in our party. The server was apologetic, but nothing was done. Finally, the night manager arrived and assured us that the deserts would be coming out shortly. A misunderstanding occurred, where we thought we'd be comp'd deserts due to horrible customer service and drinks being spilled on someone in our party, to which she replied ""who told you that?"" She was not polite, and was very unapproachable. Needless to say, the food was mediocre, and the service was absolutely dreadful. I'll be happier going to Cheesecake Factory which is not far from here."
Bill H.,"Monterey, CA",260,110,206,3.0,3/21/2012,"Good selection, typical chain sports fare.  The flatbreads are good, and I enjoy the potato skins.  Service can be a little slow at the rail, but that's more on whoever scheduled two guys on a Sunday during football season. Between the service well and the rail, these guys didn't stand a chance. I could have had two more beers in the 90 minutes I was there. That pays for an extra tender right there.  And no, not an 18 year old barback. Someone who can legally dispense and serve an adult libation."
Brittany H.,"Fresno, CA",0,5,,4.0,12/9/2015,"Great food and service! Only down side, they keep the place freezing. Definitely recommend eating here."
Chocolate B.,"Fresno, CA",0,25,4,1.0,5/30/2014,"Frat house meets restaurant. They won't take reservations unless you're bringing 8 or more (think frat party) service is super slow, food is sub par it's mostly reheated frozen food but if you want to watch a game there's plenty of TVs."
