Umar R.,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",874,622,7492,5.0,6/18/2015,"I love their pizza's! Pizzas is what draws me to BJ's,  their pizza is delicious and satisfactory if you fancy the thick (but not Chicago style thick)  fluffy soft dough pizza category with generous toppings.The pizza is not cheap for $24++ (LARGE), but come here for quality because they have it - their Spicy Hawaiian is my favorite and I highly recommend it if its your first time here. Their large sized pizza is great to be shared among 3-4 people through my experience, because its thick and fluffy, and generously pilled with chicken, pineapple, bacon, jalapeño, and tomatoes. I normally like to order online and I would highly suggest it because it is really easy, you can schedule a time and you pay as you pick it up. They have a curbside parking, and all I had to do it give them a call which is posted on their curbside sign and they will be there to get payments and also deliver the food. Plus you don't have to tip so that cuts the cost for students like me.  Their pizza is luscious. Let me start with the dough, the texture of the dough is very thick and yet soft and springy as you bite in, almost like a pillow texture.The taste of the crust reminds me of the once upon a time when pizza hut use to be good, it has a very addictive and palatable taste to it, and its very stable that you pizza slice does not fall apart as you hold it. Alongside, the topping were very generous, and i carefully use the word generous, because this place had piles of its promised toppings on my pizza. So you could imagine the grilled chicken, jalapeño, tomatoes, bacon and pineapple for my Spicy Hawaiian pizza was so much that I was satisfied. To add to that, they use real and fresh ingredients, no fake meat or fake canned vegas were detected, the roasted chicken looked and tasted like one.  My sister also ordered the angel hair Classico pasta, and I must say it was pretty spot on, the pasta was al dente and the flavors was very delightful and had a lot of depth for something so simple.  Im not sure about eating there at the establishment , since i have only ordered online and picked up curbside. But I would definitely try it in the future. As for ordering online and primarily their pizza I would highly recommend it."
Cindy P.,"Fresno, CA",30,12,,1.0,7/16/2016,"Go in about 8:30pm, 5 people, weekday, and took awhile for someone to do anything. Funny thing was we ordered appetizer, got that and no plates or napkins (it was wings) plus they were cold. Entree's were horrible as well. The bill was $120+tip. I gave a tip, normal, didn't exceed pass 15%. This was my 3rd visit to this location and the other 2 visits were not good. The last visit, the cookie in the skillet.....hard as a rock. took it off my bill. But overall, quality of food, I will stick to PF Changs, Texas Roadhouse, Yardhouse, Little Ceasar's too. :-("
Aaron L.,"Fresno, CA",6,22,18,1.0,6/5/2016,I stopped by here today and ran into a former employee I had to terminate.  I didn't even recall her name and simply attempted to say hello and she could not have been more rude.  She the proceeded to gather the manager and other employees and clearly was making statements to them; because now they were awkwardly all staring at us.  After paying bill and adding over 20% gratuity (never attempted anything free) I speak to the kind manager Cecily who could not have been more unprofessional herself.  I said I paid and based on her participating in what caused the awkwardness I stated I would take it up with corporate.  She said I welcome the call.  Well yea I guess if you lie as you must why would you be concerned?  We had let this person go due to her taking out her personal life and views on politics on the job and she was just flat rude.  Fired.  No wonder BJ's is not what is used to be clearly management is in different to good service.
Fernando G.,"Fresno, CA",9,15,7,2.0,10/10/2015,Establishment is nice. Place is clean. Service is off. Hostess pointed at a table for us to sit down. Didn't tell server we seated. 10 min later got server. Hope food makes up for service.  I'm a executive chef at a restaurant. That hostess would be off the schedule to further notice if he worked at my establishment. Don't let your food be the only reason people come. Think of the 1 to 10 theory. 1 person gets bad service and tells 10 of his friends. Maybe next time I'll get the full experience
E Lee L.,"Fresno, CA",846,16,77,4.0,3/11/2015,"My go to place for great food!  There's so many choices, but this is the hot spot for drinks and food. The waiter Kenny was wonderful and knowledgable with the menu. He helped us pick out the food. He didn't rush us. Place was busy, but took awhile to get our food.  But Kenny kept checking in on us. So only complaint I would say, is waiting awhile for food. Other then that, great service and delicious food! Thumbs up!"
Daniela P.,"Fresno, CA",3,18,7,3.0,8/16/2015,"The food here is okay. I only go for the pizookies, which are so so good! I get the regular chocolate chip cookie with vanilla bean ice cream, but they offer different flavors as well."
Amy A.,"Fresno, CA",14,17,3,5.0,2/21/2016,"The food is delicious. I ordered the shrimp and asparagus penne pasta tonight and had a glass of red wine. Daniel is so friendly and is a very social bartender. He recommended this dish to me. To be honest, I come back every time because of the bartenders! Corey and Ashley too are fast and efficient! I have never had a bad experience here! Thank you for the great service everyone! Oh and thanks for being open later. I'm just eating a late dinner tonight."
Caroline B.,"Fresno, CA",506,302,4504,2.0,1/28/2012,"I like BJ's but my experience at this specific location could've been a lot better. Didn't think it would be busy having dinner here on a Monday night, but it was very busy & ofcourse busy=slow service & lack of great, quality customer service. To top it off, the Chicken Alfredo I ordered tasted bland (MY BF agreed it was bland as well, so it wasn't just me). However, I will give 2 stars for the Asian Shrimp Lettuce Wraps because those were delicious, along with their special dipping sauce.  **Chicken Alfredo was still edible (although tasteless) and barely touched so we ended up giving it to a Homeless man at the stoplight on our way out."
Eric G.,"Clovis, CA",1,10,,1.0,2/14/2016,Had a graduation dinner here for family and I with my wife and son. wasn't too hungry I ordered just 3 appetizers we had a party of 12 and everyone got there food out with in 45 minutes but about an hour in I asked where's my food the waitress seemed to have forgot my order completely so my my wife and son sat looking at others eat and finish before possibly even getting our food after that I canceled and just paid for 3 beers she didn't even offer to discount my drinks for forgetting the 3 of us. Never go back here again lots of other breweries and restaurants to chose from in town.
David L.,"Fresno, CA",63,9,,5.0,5/21/2016,"Price: Standard for a sit down restaurant, as you normally spend more than $12 per item. Though I think most people will let it slide. Food Quantity/Quality: The food quality is very good. One of my most important criteria is that I don't get sick because of the food. I haven't gotten sick! I ordered a deep dish pizza with Italian meats, and it was pretty good. My one complaint is that it was poorly sliced and hard to get out of the pan, but given how busy they were, it was Fresno States Graduation night, it's not that big of a problem. I enjoyed every single bite, and I liked how the pizza was more toppings than sauce. I hate my pizza to be 60% tomato sauce, and this pizza avoided that pitfall.  Service: When I got there the place was PACKED. It was Fresno States Graduation night, and was logically going to be full given that Fresno State isn't that far away. It also happens that their location puts them right across from Mall, so they're usually busy anyway. I was told that it would be a 25 minute wait for a table for two, but ended up being more like 10. I was taken to the table, which was just being cleared off and cleaned, but given the sheer number of people I'm more than willing to let it go. The drink orders were taken immediately, and arrived much faster than I had anticipated. Our main orders were taken, and the food arrived within 25 minutes. That's really good considering that every table in the building was full. Our waiter was attentive, even though he was waiting at least 10 different tables, and apologized profusely if he thought he was neglecting my table. Seriously though the only time was when I waited a hot minute for a water refill, but he handled it.  I've never had a bad experience at BJ's, and it certainly doesn't look like I ever will. Go here if you can. They know what they're doing."
Burke H.,"La Jolla, CA",31,25,2,1.0,2/22/2015,"This place has gone downhill over the years.  Used to be a regular here about 8 years ago. Could say that I knew most of the management and the majority of the servers. After having moved away, coming back to this place seems like an empty shell of itself. A group of 12 of us decided to go last night, and I don't think I'll be back. Reservations were made at 8, pretty sure we didn't sit down until closer to the 8:30 side. That's cool, I understand some parties ahead of us would be enjoying their dinner. No biggie (had that been the only complaint). While waiting for our table, the bar area was accessible and easy to get drink. The bar is the only reason to come here. The bartenders are friendly and on the ball, make great tasting spirits, and do it at a reasonable pace. Finally sat down. Our first server took half the table's order, then halfway through, decided we were going to change servers. 15 minutes later, everything is settled and our waiter is now established. Ordered the calamari and best beginnings appetizers, a blonde, and the jumbalaya. The calamari looked sad. The best beginnings was on par with what was pictured in the menu. The jumbalaya was overcooked and severely lacking in rice; if I had ordered a small shrimp-stew, then that was what I received. Needless to say, I went home (hungry) and with $65 less in my pocket. So I showered because I felt so disgusted with my life decision and decided that I'd rather receive a colonoscopy waiting in line at the DMV rather than return to this establishment. It was good while it lasted BJs."
Tashara H.,"Fresno, CA",106,332,311,4.0,1/18/2014,"So, we arrived an hour after opening and the place was nearly empty.  There were definitely more wait staff than customers. We were seated promptly. Our waitress seemed a bit eager to take our order because after taking our drink order, she was back quite quickly to see if we were ready to order our meals. We asked for a few minutes, and she was generous to give us a few more than that.  No worries though--especially since we were not in a rush. We ordered the pot stickers as an appetizer... It's been a while since I've been here...looks like they've gone through another menu pricing increase. I was surprised to find that six pot stickers now cost just shy of $10.  Oh well, a sign of the times, right?  I ordered soup and salad for my meal, and my hot date ordered a pizza. A few minutes later, two servers came out with my soup and salad.. When I informed them this was my entree and we were still waiting for our appetizer, they were a bit confused and seemed to want me to take my meal while my husband waited for his.  After an awkward pause, they agreed to take the meal back to the kitchen and bring it out after the appetizer and when my husband's meal was also ready.  Because I had made a few special requests for the salad, I asked them to just keep my salad chilled--no reason to toss a perfectly good salad due to timing issues. The rest of the meal was flawless. The pot stickers were nicely browned on one side, and very flavorful, my chicken tortilla soup was delicious with just the right amount of spice, and my salad was exactly how I had asked for it.  Our waitress was prompt in refilling beverages, and overall, it was a very nice meal. By the time we left, the place was busy with the standard Saturday lunch rush...and our quality of service did not suffer even with the busier dining room. In all, I don't mind if there are mistakes made at a restaurant--we're all human. What matters to me is how they are handled. The servers did not make me feel bad for requesting my appetizer first, and they were more than courteous and prompt...and of course--it helped that the food was quite delicious! I usually avoid this BJ's because I'm not a fan of going to Fashion Fair Mall..but on a quiet Saturday, this may be the place to go!"
Jeff C.,"Oakhurst, CA",25,214,14,4.0,7/4/2015,"First time at B.J.'s. Stopped in last night for a late dinner. Huge menu. A lot of beer selections, most of which are their own brews. They even make their own soft drinks beside carrying Pepsi products. My wife had a grilled chicken salad. I had the Hawaiian Mahi Mahi over rice and veggies with a wedge salad. Kept the Hawaiian theme and had a Kona Longboard to go with it. All very tasty. Service was excellent as was the atmosphere. Worth a visit."
MsPerfect B.,"Fresno, CA",118,2,,2.0,1/3/2016,I been here plenty of times and I love it but today I had a really bad server her attitude sucked badly and after I spoke with a manger I was assigned a new server and his attitude sucked as well
Grace G.,"Fresno, CA",28,9,7,5.0,6/3/2015,Never disappointed  Love this place  An large variety of food to please the entire family....even the picky ones
Johnny T.,"Fresno, CA",254,208,826,3.0,11/14/2013,"Bjs hmmm well let's see I'm so confused on how to rate this place..... So I'm half and half on this place. One being I love beer so there right on about that me the other half is the food suuuuuucks!!! Mind u I've tried many things here mostly aps and couple entrees never any pizzas so keep that in mind ok. All the appetizers are previously frozen( not fooling anybody with the fresh avocado on top of frozen avocado in the wraps) nothing is fresh, now ok I know it's a chain and I should know better but I'm optimistic and give places more then one visit to determine a final factor if I will be returning to eat, I will definitely be back for the beer and to try a pizza but never will I order any appetizers here just feel like frozen is not the way. Guess I'll have to try a pizza next time but a total fail on every appetizer, it's a new day chain restraunts and fresh is the new... To a newbie you'll be great but for a seasoned 35 year old foodie you fail . Again I stress this is only appetizer review"
Mark M.,"Louisville, KY",44,35,19,4.0,3/28/2016,"General manager addresses the concerns of my previous visit, I returned for mid afternoon drinks and appetizers with my wife, food takes quite a while to get to the bar but the bartender was very attentive and the drinks were great."
Joanna M.,"Fresno, CA",37,243,9,2.0,3/10/2015,"Went for a birthday dinner and wanted to try a burger. I ordered the jalapeno burger. My dinner came out lukewarm, which i am almost certain it had been sitting out waiting to be delivered to my table. The waitress didnt ask how I wanted it cooked and I remembered that as I ate around my pink in the center patty. Thin piece of cheese and a few of the breaded jalapenos on top. Sorry to say but I've had a better burger at Denny's!"
Dang N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",195,1019,116,3.0,3/3/2015,"Finally made it to a BJ's. Had some deep dish pizza and a couple beers. It's all just ok. Not sure if I'd come back to be honest. I mean, there are so many other places I can go for better than ok craft beer. And I'm still looking for a great deep dish pizza restaurant."
