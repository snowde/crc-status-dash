Angela B.,"San Francisco, CA",130,460,27,4.0,12/14/2015,"When I'm traveling for work BJs is one of those chain that I know I can go to and find something reasonably tasty and reasonably healthy, to go if I need it, and usually in about 10 minutes. The food is not spectacular, but it's better than average, and whatever you're in the mood for (salad, burger/sandwich, pizza, roast chicken, snacks, etc.), they probably have something that fits the bill. I've always had perfectly nice service."
Kelly M.,"Sacramento, CA",919,586,816,4.0,7/5/2013,"I am not a huge fan of chains but BJ's definitely hits the spot. It is one of my favorite places to go for lunch because it is always a solid choice. I went here the other day for a little 4th of July lunch with my honey.  I like that they have a ""light bites"" options and they provide you with calorie counts. It's so easy to over eat at a restaurant because you have no idea how foods are made. I opted for the flat bread pizza with a small side salad.  They flat bread pizza was uber delicious.  I ordered the roasted vegetable and goat cheese pizza. The summer squash, tomatoes and green beans were so good. The goat cheese provide the right amount of tart which I loved. The salad was really nice and light. The salad was mixed greens with a light vinaigrette.  It was a nice compliment to my pizza. Also, the service was really nice and it usually is at BJ's. No complaints here. This Fresno BJ's was definitely worth the visit and I would be back again!"
Moe E.,"Long Beach, CA",1,24,,1.0,11/22/2015,Food took over 45 min to have brought out. No refills on drinks. Restroom was very dirty.
Bella P.,"Fresno, CA",328,50,137,5.0,9/9/2015,"This fine but casual restaurant is wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. The customer service is great and the food is to die for. There is so many different food that I enjoyed that its hard to pick a specific dish. Love It"
Marisela S.,"Fresno, CA",87,187,40,3.0,2/2/2015,"I have always enjoyed eating her and drinking the beers and ciders I now have a good allergy and they waiter want very knowledgeable about what was in certain plates or recommendations, just have to do your own research but other side fairly good food"
Greatest E.,"Fresno, CA",119,115,203,4.0,2/2/2015,"Very consistent, is what pops in my head at the mentioning of BJ.. Never had a bad meal here to tell the truth.. Never had a great meal either..  When I say consistent, I mean the staff( I refer to chain employees)here are nice and courteous.. Follows protocol to specs, therefore the higher rating.. Food is also decent to good in my opinion and others I have drag along.. Lots of craft beers to choose from, if u are the happy hour type this can be a place for u.. They will also let u taste the beer before making a choice, which I can appreciate..  Ambience is nice and dimly lit.. Gets really busy, the times I been here so far.. Not much to say about the food besides its good.."
Shirley M.,"Lemoore, CA",0,11,,2.0,10/9/2016,"Poor Service Two Times in a Row I've eaten dinner at BJ's twice in the last 2 months and was disappointed in their service both times.  I believe their service and food quality has gone done downhill in the last few years.  It seems to take an unusally long time between when you're seated and when the waitress takes your drink order.  The wait for drinks then becomes an issue too because it takes way too long to get your drinks.  It is difficult to flag down your waitress (in my opinion you should not have to) to get drink refills.  Simple orders are screwed up.  One of the folks in our party ordered an ice water. They were served Seven Up.  Another person ordered shrimp tacos, and they got chicken tacos.  I ordered warm artichoke dip & chips and the dip was runny.  I've tasted much better.  I overheard the lady across the aisle say that bread came with her meal and they forgot it.  The waitress said she would be right back with her bread, and never came back with it. I won't eat at BJ's again."
Pinky P.,"Fresno, CA",2,3,,1.0,9/16/2016,Just left the Resturant and ordered Mediterranean taco's they were simply horrible and fries with the hamburger were cold. The quality of food is going down
Dominic B.,"Clovis, CA",3,122,10,3.0,3/5/2015,"For being a chain restaurant, I can still honestly say I enjoy this place. Mozzarella Cheese Sticks were great, pulled pork sandwich was rugged and hardy like one for a man should be, and my girlfriend loved their Turkey club sandwich.  Beer is decent too and it's honest and admirable little touch that they serve beer under the own brand. Also, servers are courteous and respectful even in the busiest times.  Cool place."
Kristina A.,"Fresno, CA",35,47,44,4.0,9/12/2015,"When my husband suggested we have dinner tonight it made me cringe and I entered with low expectations. My previous dining experiences have been the epitope of  mediocrity. Tonight however, I was pleasantly surprised. It is obvious that there has been some real work to exceed expectations going on!  We came in and had a bit of a wait, 25 minutes was quoted but I'm sure we didn't wait that long. While we were waiting large groups of Cal Fire battalions were coming in and out, I'm positive they fed over 100 fire fighters this evening. We were seated and waited on promptly. Our server returned and took our order. Shortly after our server returned with a relief server and said he was going on break. I must admit my only thought was; ""here we go, time to get forgotten, I hope our order got put in"". Yea, I was that person! This couldn't have been further from the truth. Our service was impeccable! Our server was attentive, sweet to my child, and had an overall positive demeanor. Just Excellent!  The food. I've always liked the food here but I think the good service made it taste that much better. We started with a calamari appetizer that was crisp, hot and included two delicious dipping sauces. My husband ordered a tavern pizza, he said it was flavorful, cooked well, and the meats were good quality. The presentation was nice, it is served on a pizza skid/plank and looks great. I ordered a mini chicken bacon ranch pizza. It was the perfect size just for me. The deep dish is irresistible savory, crisp crust and chewy center cooked through. The chicken and bacon were the real deal, I could actually taste lean white meat chicken and real bacon, no bacon bits. The red onion was sliced thin, well distributed, and complimentary. The ranch drizzle was tangy and delicious. The pizza was great! My daughter had Mac and Cheese with a fruit cup. I am so thankful that the food came out on a cool plate, at a temperature appropriate for a child. She was able to eat right away and was a happy camper. A happy toddler makes a happy mommy! She even ate some of her fruit cup.  We had such a good experience that we ordered dessert. We never order dessert.  The whole meal was reasonably priced. We will be back."
Alma B.,"Madera, CA",42,128,9,3.0,1/18/2016,"15 min wait at 4pm...  Took a while to get our food.  Servers were pretty attentive so I can't complain about services.  That being said, not much I can say about a restaurant that services tacos, burgers, and pizza.  I ordered the southern fried chicken but to be honest the only thing that I really liked on my dish was the mashed potatoes.  My mom's steak on the other hand was grilled to perfection.  Maybe it was just a bad dish.  Ordered the peanut butter smore.  I like the ""crust"" of marshmallows but wish they didn't have to put a scoop of ice cream it was just overkill.  Also was expecting more of ""baked"" cookie there is a fine line between moist and undercooked."
Nancy C.,"Fresno, CA",84,63,84,4.0,1/10/2015,I'm a frequent customer here. Love thier soup and salad lunch special. My personal favorite is the wedge. We had an over the top...attentive and friendly waiter on our most recent visit. I think his name is Martin and he is probably new because I can't recall seeing him before. He will probably be in manaement next....No joke. People need to learn from people like him.
Raman B.,"Fresno, CA",231,4,1,1.0,3/4/2016,"I wish I could give them zero stars one of the worst services I've ever had. Had to ask for my drink twice. Never got my food  had to complain, manger very nicely tells me he's taken care of my order told him I didn't  want anymore server brings out the pizza and it's still the wrong order. Just ridiculous. Why would I even want my food when all my friends are done eating. Just mind blowing how bad this establishment is when it comes to their communication. Never had this happened before will never come here again."
Cin J.,"Fresno, CA",502,29,41,5.0,8/27/2015,Great place for lunch and happy hour! 3.50 house beers during lunch (11 - 3) and Happy hour after 3 - 6 I believe. Great pizzas! And also recommend mozza tomato salad and jalapeño corn fritters
Simi J.,"Mount Davidson Manor, San Francisco, CA",16,26,25,1.0,8/19/2014,"Shitty customer service. The food was tasty, but mind you the server did not give anything on time. I asked for crushed red peppers and 25 mins later she handed me diced tomatoes. I asked for marinara sauce. She brought it out after my cheese sticks were cold.  Messed up on my damn pazookie as well. Never come here"
She S.,"Fresno, CA",87,132,33,3.0,8/26/2015,"The food atmosphere and service are all fine. I did have a little bit of trouble with my waitress, she talked down to me and I felt a little uncomfortable. When my friend came to the table she was very nice and polite to him. I think she may have been responding to my race. Racism is alive and real in BJs"
Eli A.,"Fresno, CA",98,19,7,3.0,2/1/2016,"It's a chain restaurant that has been pretty good to us. Located in the fashion fair mall shopping center, it may be difficult to find parking nearby on the weekends. They've always had decent customer service, so that's been consistent. We ordered the great white pizza and avocado egg rolls. Two good items. It's such a standard restaurant, I'm not amazed by their menu. I come here Once in a while, so I'm not saying it's bad, but it's not great."
Krena P.,"Schaumburg, IL",230,1,,1.0,11/11/2015,"I did not appreciate the serves that was given to me at this establishment,  I am a religious vegatarian, and I had order a veggie burger. Which they thought they brought out, I began eating it. Than half way through my meal the serve comes up to me telling me that wasn't my burger, that it was actually a turkey burger and that he gave me the wrong one. This is not acceptable and I am highly appalled by the matter. I was compensated for the meal which the server had mistakenly given me, but no one had felt the decency to come up to me and apologize for what had happen. Later that evening after I had gotten home I became really sick due to the consumption of the meat, since I have been a strict vegatarian my whole life."
Carmen C.,"Hayward, CA",70,105,71,4.0,12/19/2015,If you're at the bar ask for Ashley! She makes the best Manhattans... And she's not stingy!
Sebastian B.,"Fresno, CA",2,31,2,3.0,7/16/2016,"After reading the reviews, I began to think that some of the people at BJs wrote the really good reviews. BJs is food, but it's not great. I keep going back, so they must be doing something right. I think the problem and the reason are one in the same: they make a lot of mistakes, but the managers are very willing to make the necessary corrections to make the customer somewhat happy. My problem is there's always a mistake. And the biggest mistake they make is serving you cold, inconsistent food. I always order the same two dishes and it's almost exact when I say, every other visit, my food is good. Just like the other day when I ordered the Ahi Poke appetizer. They forgot to marinade the Ahi in their poke sauce. They basically served me raw, bland tuna. I finally realized what the problem was and the waitress brought me some poke sauce, but never offered an apology or an option of getting another Ahi Poke made correctly. Nope. She just acted like nothing and charged me for it. I've come accustomed to things like this at BJs. If my wife didn't love the damn Pazookie so much, I would NEVER go back."
