Desiree V.,"Daly City, CA",98,44,4,1.0,7/19/2014,"There's no way it should take over 2 hours to be sat on a Saturday night. We originally had like a party of 15, which dwindled down to a party of 10, either way that is ridiculous, especially when the whole entire back of the restaurant was in unoccupied. They told my friend for her birthday that they only do reservations a half hour in advance, but when she called an hour in advance the person she talked with didn't mention this supposed policy.  We ended up sitting at bar tables while waiting, which was nearly impossible to get drinks and appetizers. We had to wait 15+ minutes between seeing a server which was frustrating when people would gradually show up for our party wanting to order.  When we finally got moved to the furthest part of the restaurant, it took a long time to get our food order taken after being seated. It took 30 minutes for two of us to receive our lukewarm soups. Then it was another almost hour wait to get our meals. What was frustrating is that at least 2 meals came out incorrectly.  At least our pizzookies didn't take too long to come out after ordering it, but one girl didn't get hers and by the time we were able to flag a server down and fix the problem, we were already waiting for our checks. I've never had to wait so long for a server to get our checks situated...  The first group of us arrived at BJ's at 6:30 pm, we didn't leave until 10:30. There went our mall shopping plan to celebrate her 21st birthday. Will definitely NEVER go back to this place again."
Keith S.,"Washington, DC",129,20,,1.0,2/11/2016,"Went here with my family. They treated my own mother like she was homeless. The manager threatened to kick her out. All because they didn't want to find her an outlet for her laptop.  While this is an extra, you don't sit there and tell one person in our party to leave all of a sudden. WE're visiting from Dallas. and The way they are in Fresno makes me not want to patron them at their locations in Dallas."
Amanda J.,"Clovis, CA",66,2,,2.0,2/28/2016,"So upset about the s'mores pazzokie being discontinued! That was the best thing on the menu, my friends and I won't be coming back until it's back. We go there at least once a week."
Dorje T.,"Bothell, WA",19,140,84,2.0,12/2/2012,"This is a Sports Bar, first & foremost. They also serve pizza.  That is really medicore.  Although I strongly suspect they make their own crust (kudos for that!), they do not know how to bake it!  3 different visits and each time the crust was doughy with dry, overbaked toppings.  Turn up the bottom heat of the oven & turn down the top heat and you might get me to come back. Yes, I used to be a professional bread baker and pastry chef - I know this stuff!  Wish BJ's did."
ImLookingAt U.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,462,294,2.0,5/4/2014,"We have not been here in about 1-2 years because it has always been too cold in the building but wanted a salad and it was suggested and after some debate we thought we would give it another shot. As soon as we were seated, all in the group thought it was too cold.  We asked the hostess that sat us to please tell someone if they could raise the temp and she said she would talk to the manager.  A little while went by and no change in the temp but our server presented us with the menus.  As we were looking at the menus we all noticed that there has been no change in the temp.  The server returned to take our order and I mentioned that we were ready to order but not until the temp has been increased and he said he would let the manager know.  A short time later a female manager came to our table and agreed that the temp was pretty cold and said that she would adjust in higher.  For a brief time we all thought the temp was increasing and ordered.  After ordering and throughout the meal the temp returned to the same original level of coolness as when when we were seated. Although the female manager was extremely nice she never came back to our table to inquire how we found the temperature to be after her ""adjustment"". If you have small nipples on your body, they will soon be erect in here. Will not be back"
Ronald W.,"Sparks, NV",0,39,,5.0,8/7/2016,I have eaten at many bj's restaurants across the country and am well aware of their policies and demands of their employees.  Tonight however I saw an individual take it to a much higher level of service excellence.  This individual wasn't even my server but she might as well have been by her way of helping numerous guests not even in her station but on her way to the back of the house.  Always had her hands full and a smile present. She was busy but on point.   I was truly amazed.  That's why I frequent bj's establishments because I can often  learn from good people how to be better. Natalie! You rock.  You and the management that helped guide your training should take a bow.  This world needs more Natalie's.
Ray B.,"Fresno, CA",0,20,,5.0,2/12/2016,"I really enjoyed coming here. I had the BBQ Brisket hamburger with fries and it was great. Our waitress was fast, friendly and very attentive which made for a great experience coming here."
R T.,"Fresno, CA",29,5,10,2.0,8/17/2014,"Ordered a shrimp pasta and I was disappointed , the pasta was over cooked , therefore it was cut up to 1 inch n I had to send it back! Sad."
Lester W.,"Fresno, CA",141,125,190,4.0,5/12/2015,"took the wife and fam here for mother's day and we loved it! the server was nice and he took all of our orders without writing anything down on paper (5 people) lol i had the fruito boat nachos and the broccoli and cheese soup (breaded bowl) both were delicious! chased it down with a bleaded white peach margarita, the kids ordered off the kids menu, burgers, chicken fingers and spaghetti and my wife had the steak with a fully loaded baked potato, broccoli and cheese soup (bowl no bread) and a blended white peach margarita as well, everyone enjoyed their food, I will definitely be back again to try something different"
Charlie M.,"Fresno, CA",89,30,53,2.0,6/6/2014,"Seriously, why do people wait in line to come here. The only reason we came was for a going away party. We had a reservation for 8:00. We got a table at 9:30. They tried to charge us for things we didn't order. We asked for every drink refill. Food was mediocre. I can't see myself ever coming here again."
Eve M.,"Templeton, CA",4,43,87,5.0,8/9/2015,"I've been to 2 other BJ's locations, and this restaurant joined the others in offering a friendly staff and great food/drink! Their house salad was cool, crisp, with lots of fresh flavor, and the Chicken Fettucini Alfredo was DIVINE. For dessert, I ordered the Chocolate Chunk Pizookie (a giant cookie in a warm skillet, topped with ice cream) and left the restaurant happy with the food and price."
Timothy G.,"Santa Maria, CA",0,14,6,5.0,4/19/2015,Wife had shrimp tacos and I had a burger.  The food was by and far the best we had on our visit in fresno.  Table for two was no wait at all in the middle of sunday lunch rush.  The service was excellent and I rarerly say that.  A huge part of service for me is never reaching the bottom of what ever I may be drinking that night.  Definately would eat here again.
Rob H.,"Overland Park, KS",4,53,65,4.0,6/15/2014,"Yes, a chain restaurant, so I would assume that the meal can be somewhat hit or miss, but I ordered the Mahi Mahi off the enLIGHTened menu, and I was surprisingly pleased with this meal.  It was delivered to the table very hot (which is important to me), the fish was cooked perfectly--a nice sear and not overcooked, and the rice with mixed vegetables was very good.  A bit of pineapple made this dish delicious!  Seriously, it was so good that I intend to go back...just to see if it was a fluke.  I had good service AND the Kings won the Stanley Cup that night. Check that."
Roman G.,"Fresno, CA",1,41,2,2.0,4/19/2014,"So against my better judgement I decided to come here again with my wife. The hilarity here ensues. The servers are polite but just slightly better than completely incompetent. From walking by our table with our food, going to the kitchen the coming back like nothing happened, to taking thirty minutes for a sandwich when it's half empty in here.  The food is decent and a decent value. The servers though, maybe it's the system. Maybe the manager is an idiot and doesn't know how to help these people work efficiently. Whatever this is it's somewhere between comical and irritating.  I feel sorry for the people who eat here and don't know any better, like me and my wife I guess. Maybe I'll learn one day. :P"
Karen B.,"Fresno, CA",1,5,,5.0,6/4/2016,"I enjoy hanging out at the bar during happy hour, drinking BJs root beer, eating half-price pizza, and chatting with the servers. Best of all, if I don't see my game, they'll usually put it on one of the TVs for me."
Greg R.,"Orem, UT",12,19,6,3.0,5/13/2014,"This a franchise restaurant in a mall location, but the friendly staff make it feel more like a local establishment. My friends and I sat at the bar and enjoyed quick attentive service during busy lunch service two days in a row. We tried all the chicken wings that they have with all the sauces, and determined that the Brewhouse BBQ and Teriyaki traditional wings were our favorites.  Not a shining star of haute cuisine but good, consistent food."
Tony A.,"Fresno, CA",55,1,,1.0,12/5/2015,As I'm sitting here drinking my beer being my first here  I felt rushed ordering and couldn't even enjoy the pleasure of actually seeing what they had to offer in the menu so I didn't even enjoy my meal so I hope they don't charge me. Next time I'll just take my services to Costa Azul!
Skye W.,"Fresno, CA",38,37,3,1.0,7/18/2015,Good food but have to order to go all the time to get the meal i want. Not sure why age should matter to order off a menu. I thought a restaurant was there to sell you food. Oh well to go works for me.
Cole J.,"Fresno, CA",6,58,20,5.0,8/20/2014,"Came on their lunch hours. Got the new chili Verde fries. They were pretty dang good. I got the chicken parm crusted sandwich. Really good, moist chicken, not overly toasted bun. Nice amount of fries. Waiter was nice and on it. I would recommend the lunch hours. Price is nice and I prefer the not so busy scene every now and then."
Claire G.,"Fresno, CA",48,7,,5.0,12/21/2015,Great place! Delicious food! They have gluten free options!! Recommend the pazookie to top off your delicious meal. The pazookie comes gluten free too if needed!
