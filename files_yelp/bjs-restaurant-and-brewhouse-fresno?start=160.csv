Tk H.,"Fresno, CA",3,32,,5.0,4/2/2016,BJs followed through big time much love for the smores pazooki reunion . The manager was kind enough to invite us back after a mix up in communication between servers and management. I'll be back to try the new one!!!
Nicole W.,"Denver, CO",254,1723,580,3.0,8/6/2012,"It is what it is - a chain, with good beer and interesting food options Happy hour till 7pm - woot! This is one of our go-to's as a team when we travel to fresno. Something for everyone, and decent beer! I love summer - they usually have a good wheat! Service is hit or miss, depends on how crowded it is and who called in sick! Bar is cozy seating, so be prepared to share! Dining room is fine, little quieter I love the shrimp lettuce wraps - as an app for dinner! And now they have to always put all the calories for every dish - not always fun to see, but good to know! Salads are pretty tasty! Parking can be dicey, specially with a rental car!"
Austin Travis Dylan H.,"Fresno, CA",25,48,12,4.0,6/10/2015,"I'm usually not a chain kind of guy, but I do enjoy myself some BJ's. Lacking on the vegetarian options but definitely good drinks and desserts."
Caroline M.,"Fresno, CA",17,64,7,4.0,6/9/2015,"When it's after 9:00pm and you're starving... or you want a delicious dessert, this is your place! My BF and I at first didn't like this place much because we can during day, but we gave it another chance and enjoyed it the second time. Their service is up and down. Sometimes we get a great waiter sometimes we get a so-so waitress. Will continue eating here. :p"
Russell E.,"Clovis, CA",14,21,,4.0,7/26/2015,"Pizza is unique and not bad at all. I like the crispy exterior and light, airy interior crust. Service is good. They definitely take care of you there. Root beer is delicious-I drank 3 mugs of it. Recommended for the root beer at a minimum.  I would def go again."
Daniel A.,"Fresno, CA",11,13,,5.0,12/3/2015,"Always great food, I love everything I have ever tried, 5 stars, you can't go wrong here"
Megan S.,"Fresno, CA",1,19,1,1.0,4/26/2015,The service was not good because I was delivered my silverware 5 minutes after we were served the food... The food I ordered was too expensive and small portion I left hungry and walked to the mall and ordered a pretzel pizza from wetzel pretzel.
Lindsey R.,"Clovis, CA",48,11,7,2.0,12/7/2013,"BJ's has a great menu - tons of choices for everyone in your group. The atmosphere is fun, if not a little loud.  For dine-in I'd give them 4 out of 5 stars, but the take out service is terrible.  The first time I ordered take out (for myself and my vegetarian husband) they put pepperoni *under* all of the veggies on his pizza. The server, when I mentioned my soy allergy asked me ""soy is salt, right?"" ...uh...no. We had to wait another 30 minutes for them to make a new meatless pizza. I thought maybe this bad experience was a fluke but tonight it happened again....  They forgot part of our order (which I made sure was ""in our cart"" online) and then bickered with me about whether or not it I had in fact ordered it. All of the food in our order was mislabeled and the ""special requests"" (nothing fancy, just spread on the side, etc.) had been ignored.  I may eat at BJ's again, but I will never order their take-out again."
Zach Y.,"Clovis, CA",21,8,,5.0,7/15/2015,Love their rib eye steak and baked potato and orange cream soda!!!! Delicious. Service is always great for me.
Celestino G.,"Fowler, CA",5,14,8,1.0,2/14/2014,"The Negatives: Here are the problems with BJ's. First thing I called in advance to try and get a Valentines Day reservation, the only problem they don't take reservations not even on valentines day, what kind of restaurant does this. Second off if you call in advance they can put you on the list for a table but you can only call 30 minutes in advance and they WILL NOT TELL YOU HOW LONG THE WAIT TIME IS OVER THE PHONE. This is a big problem for me. If I am willing to drive all the way over to BJ's and I can't even know how long the wait is for a table I might as well travel to another restaurant that will tell me how long I will have to wait for a table. They also have limited room to wait inside and a few benches outside but during the night time it gets pretty cold out there.  The Positives: The food here is great and if its not a busy night than go here and get a table. They brew there own Root Beer which tastes Great! The pizza is fantastic. The 2 person booths are a nice size not to small or to big.  The reason for the 1 star and not more is simply because I don't like restaurants that will not tell me how long I will have to wait once I get there. Also Not taking reservations on Valentines Day. I can see not taking them on regular days, but when you don't take them on valentines day your only going to piss off a lot of people who are waiting in the cold outside for over a hour, eventually they might leave for another place.  Conclusion: If you want good food and its not busy go here. If its a special occasion such as Valentines Day than stay away."
Sukhraj B.,"Orange, CA",1723,1189,1870,4.0,9/12/2009,"We went out to dinner and celebrated Mom and Dad's birthdays, the duo Virgo team, with some deep dish pizza.   The wait was ridiculously long but no one felt like cooking so we waited.  The wait for a pager was 5 minutes long.  Seriously?  For a pager?  And then the wait for a table was 50 minutes.  Crazy.  But then again, it was Friday night.  We sat outside and people watched while we waited and I noticed that people in Fresno, mostly teens, really have no sense of style but that also extended out to the 20 somethings.  I guess I'm glad I don't live here anymore.  Would I be looking like that now?  Gosh, I hope not.  We did notice a cool taxi limo.  I want to check that out someday.   We were finally called in and wow, this place was packed! There wasn't a single seat available.  I guess Fresno is quickly becoming the happening place and Fashion Fair mall with all it's new extensions and high end stores and high end chain restaurants might be what's doing it.  Either way, it was pretty hot in there and the waitress was quick to get the drinks ordered (a hefeweizen, a round of waters, and iced teas) and circulated.  She was also super attentive the whole night and got some extra tips from us.  We're also filling out a survey for her to win our free bruschetta appetizer and hopefully get some brownie points for her at work. We skipped the appetizer this time around which is usually the Avocado Egg Rolls (awesome!) and went straight for two large pizzas, the Mediterranean and a veggie and a meatball sandwich.  Both had olives, one had Kalamata olives and I wanted to opt out of those but when the pizzas arrived I was surprised that they weren't too overwhelming which was nice. I have usually gotten the Great White here but I think I have a new favorite.  The Mediterranean had a nice flavor and the basil pesto sauce was just perfect. I also wasn't too full afterward like I usually am with these pizzas and I had enough room for a chocolate chip pizookie.   Like any chain restaurant, BJ's has never failed to disappoint.  The crowds can be overwhelming at times but the food is usually pretty good."
Christina F.,"Tollhouse, CA",0,37,3,5.0,8/31/2015,Had a party of ten.. Very prompt dedicated service! Amazing pizza! Good beer! Will be back!
Ramona M.,"Fresno, CA",1,26,5,3.0,6/5/2015,"If you have a large party don't come here. Five or less and its do-able. The food is ok. The reason I have this them 3 stars is because the pazookie is great. The drinks are either watered down or too sweet. And the wait is crazy long for big parties. From waiting outside to leave was literally 3 hours! Any restaurant should know to put at least 2 waiter on large parties, no they had 1 and the poor girl was working at least 3 big tables. Management only helped when we complained. They offered free dessert which was cool for the inconvenience but the wait on that was just as long. We had to get up and go to the front to get someone just so we could pay our bill. We were so close to walking out without paying, but in the end the general manager gave a big discount."
Pawan G.,"Los Angeles, CA",30,7,,4.0,5/8/2015,The service is a little slow but the server was polite. The food was great. I even are pizza the next morning and it was still awesome. And yeah the parking is easy to find.
marina T.,"Fresno, CA",126,40,2,1.0,5/3/2015,Wow!!! Had the worst brunch today at bj's!!! I will never come back! They bring food no utensils!  Bring pancakes no bacon!! Coffee n no creamer!! Food took 50 minutes! Waitress was terrible! Good was cold and hard
Michele B.,"Fresno, CA",60,250,1288,4.0,12/2/2011,"Super delicious. Great deals during happy hour and excellently open late hours which works out great for me when i get outta work at 9 and during the holiday season (it is across from the mall).  Food is always delicious and hot, never had issues with any of my servers.  Last time I went my soda never went empty and we were checked on frequently. Love it!"
Beth M.,"Fresno, CA",0,9,,1.0,7/15/2015,Been here almost 30 minutes and finally had to ask for a server.  No tip for them.  Second time I've been been here not coming here again.
Chia C.,"Fresno, CA",114,9,2,5.0,2/22/2016,"Excellent waitress we got tonight I have to say! She was very consistent too! Love it how she took it well with some of our silly behaviors and such good sense of humor she has too! If you want a good waitress you can ask for Amanda b. Amazing, amazing! I figured I wasn't the only who enjoyed her as our waitress, but our other friends did too. I order the shrimp asparagus penne, and it was delicious! I loved it how the asparagus is half way cook and it has this nice flavor to it. As well, I love it how they sprinkled some bread crumbs on top of my dish. Super delicious!"
Kathy P.,"Kingsburg, CA",23,37,43,5.0,11/17/2011,"The home of the Pizookie!  My fav is 1/2 oreo 1/2 white chocolate chip.  Sign up for the emails because you'll get notified when it is their BEST deal.  Party for Two!  You each get a salad or soup, share a medium specialty pizza and share one Pizookie...for only $20!  The pizzas alone are always $20!  We love that deal.  I've heard you can pay more to get a larger pizza, but for the two of us, we always take about two pieces home.  The Sweet Pig pizza wasn't that great.  My favorite is the BJ's Favorite pizza (basically combination).  There is a buffalo chicken one that everyone seems to love...I don't normally like chicken on my pizza but I tried a bite and liked it.  Their spinach artichoke pizza I tried was also good.  Tell them you're there to celebrate your birthday, and you get a free chocolate chip pizookie (not standard size, but free is great).   Be ready for a long wait.  We always wait at least 20 minutes.  This particular night, we showed up on a Saturday around 8:45 and had almost an hour wait.  If you don't mind sitting in the bar, it's first come first serve so start throwing those elbows folks. Without fail, the person walking you to your table will tell you to watch your step as you go down their stair into the dining room.  I don't know why those things are funny to me, but leave it to the HR person to notice that and realize they must have made that a policy because someone sued for NOT watching their own step.  Give me a break haha!"
Heather F.,"Eureka, CA",3,30,12,3.0,2/7/2015,So to start off it was a busy Saturday night just keep that in mind they called for a group of 35. Waited an hour and a half to be seated. First server wasn't very attentive. The place is relatively dark so it was difficult to read our menus. The drinks on the menu didn't have prices next to them. When a couple of the people in our party recieved their salads they didn't receive silverware and sat a good 3-5 minutes without a fork to eat their salad. Food was all right. Nothing too fancy for the price. Our second server was the saving grace tonight! We would come back but maybe on a weeknight.
