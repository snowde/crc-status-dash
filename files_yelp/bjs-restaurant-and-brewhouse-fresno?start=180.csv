Juan R.,"Fresno, CA",0,1,,2.0,5/9/2015,"Second time we come here and they gave our table out. Had us wait with a pager over an hour and seen people walking after us to get seated. Too top things off they lie to us saying they called us. We were sitting right by checking desk, never heard them call us and pager never went off. Not to happy with their front desk workers."

Dave N.,"Sacramento, CA",2,24,9,1.0,2/9/2011,"This Update is for Urbanspoon, who summarily deleted my post saying it could, ""profoundly affect their reputation, so we don't include them."" - Ken Goldstein  Heaven forbid they post a bad review."
Miriam M.,"Fresno, CA",299,267,493,4.0,9/16/2011,"I have always loved BJ's and it's definitely a go to place for my friends and me. I have never ordered anything I didn't like there as well. However, over the last year or two I feel like the service has gotten ridiculously SLOW. It took like 35-40minutes to get our food this last time.  Luckily the staff has always been friendly.  A few things that are especially good and worth trying is the new portobello mushroom pizza, the shrimp chardonnay (you get a ton of shrimp!), and if you like chocolate try the ghiradelli pizookie (i get mine with vanilla ice cream instead of chocolate though). If you like girly drinks, the white peach mojito is delish! I don't like that the birthday pizookies are now the mini size though. Boooo."
Sasha V.,"Visalia, CA",36,56,134,3.0,2/23/2014,Pizza is delicious. Hosts n bartenders r not friendly. Kinda wanted to punch them in the face. Waiters were nice.
Jay C.,"Fresno, CA",2,2,,1.0,3/10/2014,"Delicious root beer. Unfortunately, this was the best part of my experience tonight. After waiting almost two hours for my online order I realized I was missing a sandwich and the previously mentioned soft drink. After contacting both the restaurant and the delivery service they outsource to I was assured I would receive my corrected order. After about another hour I receive two sodas and a 'remade' sandwich which still was not what I ordered.  Now, I don't place full blame upon BJ's; however why a restaurant would employ a delivery service rather having a driver on staff is beyond me. Given that they charged a delivery fee along with a service charge on top of the orders tax, and the driver said that not one penny went to driver tip or gas reimbursement, this will clearly will not be where or how I will spend my money any time soon."
Saemlinh I.,"Fresno, CA",115,112,252,4.0,8/26/2013,"Thanks to Mimi for great service. She absolutely adored Zachariah, and he blew her kisses. The beer battered panko breaded shrimp was excellent nostalgic in the way of reminding me of childhood. UPDATE: their blonde shrimp has been removed from the menu for who knows what reason. This takes away one star, but at least they still provide an above average experience for their choices that beat out Chilis and reminds Applebee's 'WTF are ya doin?'"
Natalie K.,"Fresno, CA",0,1,1,4.0,10/4/2014,"I have been to this BJ's quite a few times and personally, the only reason why I like to come here is for the pizookie (which is the bomb!). A must have that we order every time is the avocado egg rolls (sometimes we come and just order this along with dessert). I like to stay with the classic pizookie, so I haven't really tried the other flavors. I heard there was a pumpkin flavor, but I'm not brave enough to try it.  A complaint that I have is that some of the servers need to give better customer service. The last time we went to BJ's we were seated at a bar table and once our server came around we told him that we would like to go ahead and order our entrees because we were on a time crunch and that a person from our party had an important appointment to go to after we ate. The restaurant wasn't busy, and we came with 2 hours before the appt. We had ordered a couple pizzas and had asked if they would mind bringing us ranch and jalapenos. We had to ask numerous times, come to find out that our server had gone on break. We had to hail a waitress to ask her if SHE could bring us some ranch and peppers. She was not very friendly since we had to repeatedly ask her when she would bring it out. She told us ""Oh, I thought they already brought it out for you"". We urged her if she could just grab it for us since we were not very far from the kitchen, but she took her sweet time getting back to us, to which our party was already done with the pizza. After my sister said, ""Well we already finished our pizza..."" the waitress apologized (even though she DIDN'T seem sorry) but she did bring our dessert out on time. We waited 35 MINUTES just for ranch and peppers.  I'm assuming this is just an isolated incident, because other than that I felt that the food was fine. From what other reviews I have seen, I think that the problem is in the bar area."
Sweet O.,"Fresno, CA",2,30,16,4.0,8/26/2013,"Had dinner here tonight with my little family and overall it was a very nice experience! We didnt have to wait that long to be seated (probably waited less than 5 min) usually its always busy and the waits around 10 15 min or so.  I had the jambalaya and man was it delicious!! A lot better than The Elephant Bar in my opinion, My husband had the salmon and wasnt too happy with it. He said it was a little dry and that the side veggies tasted a lot better -_-  All in all, our waiter was very nice and attentive i would definitely be returning soon! :)"
Shelley B.,"Livermore, CA",0,4,,1.0,9/20/2015,Came for an early lunch. Still here. Took forever to take our order. Over 45 minutes to get food. It arrived cold. It is not busy here at all. No excuse for such bad service. Normally I love this place but it will be a while before we come back if at all.
Ashley G.,"Clovis, CA",99,82,11,2.0,9/1/2014,Food is great but customer service was horrible. We were forgotten in the corner the whole evening.  At one point she came and said she was going on a break and the other girl would take care of us she came back from her 30 minute and we had not seen anyone. We will be taking our happy hours elsewhere!
Jay S.,"Fresno, CA",10,464,14,3.0,11/4/2010,"I am generally not a fan of chain restaurants, in fact I can only think of a few chain restaurants I actually like.  My family loves them and normally has to drag me kicking and screaming to eat at one, but this is one of the few I will make an exception for. But lets be real here, the big draw for this place is the beer.  No its not exactly amazing beer, but it is cold and gets you drunk, and is not gross like its more urine-centric cousins Budweiser and Coors.  So if you are looking for a relaxed place to drink some beers, this is generally a pretty good spot to go.  I myself tend to meet up here every few weeks with friends after class, and we have some drinks and get a bite to eat. Now for the food, it also isn't exactly amazing, but it isn't bad either.  Nothing distinguishes it as being outstanding, but it is quite edible.  One of their signature things is their mini pizzas, which to me aren't all that fantastic.  The crust is always super oily, and generally the whole thing isn't all that appetizing.  (But I would at least rather eat their pizza than say Little Caesars, or Pizza Hut any day.) The other menu items can be a little hit and miss in terms of quality, which is why I generally stick to things that I know to be a known quantity.  The pulled pork sandwich is actually fairly decent, but nowhere near being the quality of ""authentic"" BBQ.  Similarly their chicken club sandwich is ok, as is their cajun pasta.  I know my parents used to be a big fan of the chili sandwich, but according to them they changed the ingredients, and it isn't that good anymore.  I personally do not eat chili so I can't attest to the validity of their complaint. My only major complaint is that they can be a little stingy with the TV's sometimes.  One time I went during hockey playoffs, and asked if they could change just one of the smaller TV's to the game so our group could watch it.  Mind you at this particular time there were no other major sporting events competing with it, so it shouldn't have been that big a deal.  After a lot of hemming and hawing, I had to eventually catch the managers eye and ask if he could change it for me, since no one else seemed to be able to do so.  He did finally change it, but all in all it took me nearly 30 minutes to get them to do it.  I know its a very specific complaint on my part, but to me and the group I was with, it was kind of a bummer."
Aileen D.,"Vallejo, CA",199,61,67,4.0,10/28/2010,"Like most BJ's great atmosphere! Service was excellent considering they were packed (opening day of the world series).. I thought it was interesting that a little past 6:30 they dimmed the lights down real low! Super romantic lighting during the game!! Very strange but cool. Food and drinks were good as usual! We watched the whole game, so by the 8th inning I actually had space in my belly for a Macadamia Nut Pizookie!!! YUMMMMM!!!!"
Austin H.,"Provo, UT",161,136,63,4.0,9/26/2013,"POSITIVES: Great atmosphere. Good service. Great variety. NEGATIVES: The wait can be long, and it can be pricey. And the pizza wasn't amazing. Neither was the home-brewed root beer. But I'd definitely go again to try something else. PRICE: $7-12 per meal RECOMMENDED: The pizookies are a must-try."
Jolely M.,"Visalia, CA",3,115,5,4.0,2/28/2013,"I'm a fan. It was pretty crowded for a Thursday (12:30pm). Our server, Tiffany was very friendly. Their lunch menu is very affordable with a few different items to pick from. Strawberry Mojitos! Woot woot!"
Joy -.,"Petaluma, CA",1,69,,4.0,7/6/2014,"Came here for a dinner with the in-laws.  Service was good.  The gluten free menu is not terribly extensive (no appetizers except salads), but does include pizza (with many standard topping options), entree salads, and a few entrees, plus a gluten-free pizookie.  I enjoyed my pizza - the crust was done well.  No issues later.  When I ordered a salad to eat while the rest of the table had appetizers, the server made sure to get my full order so she could key in the salad as an add-on to my full meal, not as a separate item - ultimately saving us some money.   The main negative of the evening came in the fact that our server was pretty clueless regarding the gluten free menu.  The menu - for some reason - doesn't explicitly list which salad dressings are gluten free.  The gluten free menu is in the same brochure as the allergen listings, so she pointed me to the listing for wheat allergens.  I get that many servers may not know that wheat free and gluten free are not quite the same thing, but I was rather surprised that when she went to ask others which salad dressings were gluten free, she came up empty.  Ultimately, I had a dressing-less salad, which is hardly the end of the world, but it would be nice if there was better information available."
Delilah D.,"Fresno, CA",4,18,,3.0,11/23/2015,Pizza is good but expensive for what you get. Housemade sodas are good & made w/ real sugar. My friends like the pazookies but I dont care for them. I come here about twice a month and its the same. Decent service w/ ok food. Nothing special.
Aryan O.,"Long Beach, CA",111,537,26,5.0,6/29/2011,All I gotta say is Jambalaya and beer. I've been to alot of these restaurants and this place is located near Fashion Fair mall in front of Urban Outfitters. This place seems like it's bigger than the other BJ's I've been to. Bar area is pretty big with a full bar. Nutty Brunette is the beer of choice I usually get.  Oh yah try parking close to the front of the door because it's hot as hell over there. I'm just saying.
Murray G.,"Murrieta, CA",6,117,66,5.0,10/19/2014,"Passing thru and stopped at a familiar name to eat. Had a very inexpensive Flat bread taco meal with my wife. The waiter Steve O was the best server that I have had in a long time. He did something that was very unusual in today's wait staff. He came back to check on us several times throughout our meal. Kudos to the food, the service and the staff. Great place to eat."
C. W.,"Tracy, CA",2,40,3,4.0,1/25/2015,"One of my favorites in Fresno.  Been here many times.  I have a frequent diner's card from this restaurant too.  Close to everything and easy to get to. Menu is plentiful.  Appetizers are all good.  Stuffed mushrooms are fantastic.  I've even ordered my entire meal from the appetizers menu.   If you like Boston Clam Chowder, this is my favorite non-seafood place to get it.  Sometimes the bowl is not enough and I'll order one to go after the meal. Lots to choose from on the entrees list.  Pizza is usually pretty safe bet.  But their pasta is really good as well.  Their steaks are cooked to perfection and are really juicy.  Really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  I've tried all kinds of things and have always been very satisfied. Service is usually very good.  On occasion, it's outstanding.  And when it is, your glass never goes dry, your next course is always right after they take clear the last one.  Multiple servers is not uncommon. Last, but not least,  try the Pizzookie.   It's a cookie, hot and soft, in a pizza pan and top it off with ice cream.  Just trust me on this one.  Your tastebuds will thank you later!"
