Luis V.,"Fresno, CA",1,8,6,1.0,12/3/2014,"Food is great, but their customer service needs to get a lot better. it took 10 minutes for the server to actually cone to our table and ask for our drinks ."
Amber H.,"Clovis, CA",24,5,1,5.0,3/6/2014,Great service. Our waiter Will was so nice and accommodating. There was a mix up with our order and he had the kitchen remake it no problem. I would love to have Will as our server again.
Dave C.,"Fresno, CA",0,3,2,4.0,12/2/2014,"Great restaurant for casual dining.  Excellent food and service, not as noisy as some restaurants due to the high ceiling.  The restaurant is a simple big, square room, but the tables, seats and appointments are nice, and the table partitions give a bit of an impression of privacy.  Price is reasonable, and I would bet that just about anything you normally like will be liked at BJ's.  The Yelp pre-printed price range below says $61, and I couldn't seem to change it, but I have never spent more than $25-30, though I usually like their salads and pastas, and have never had the most expensive meals.  I checked the ""Casual"" box below, but personally I would not attend BJ's in cargo pants and T--I think ""Business Casual"" would be a better description of the average dress.  Overall, a great place for lunch, and better than average for dinner."
J G.,"Hollister, CA",111,65,39,5.0,4/17/2012,"Everything is excellent!!! A must for appetizers: Avocado Egg Rolls! We get these every time. Pizza is amazing! Basically, can't get a bad meal here.... Beware of weekends....expect three hour waits.... or there is seating in the bar area!"
Jeff F.,"Fresno, CA",1,18,2,3.0,5/14/2013,"This isn't BJ's' fault, but the parking situation on a Friday or Saturday night can reach a scary level. The ""valet"" area for Flemings (I'm guessing) needs to be eliminated entirely because all it is is a bunch of cordoned off empty spots.  Anyway, as you would expect given the parking situation, BJ's can get quite busy. Even so, I've never had any issues getting seated in a reasonable amount of time and I've never had issues with service once I'm seated.  I started out my 21st birthday here with one of the beer samplers. It doesn't look like much (and it really isn't, ultimately) but that thing got me decently loaded. I haven't had anything but the house beers at BJ's, and all of the ones that I've had have been good. Definitely worth checking out if you're a beer person and haven't tried BJ's offerings before. The food... meh. I'm notoriously easy to please, but I've never gotten enthusiastic about the food here. It's passable, but there's no ""wow"" factor. I think the worst offender is the cajun pasta; I can see what they're trying to do, but the result is a pretty generic dish that makes you wonder what exactly it is that you're tasting. Really strange, and it's a trait shared across many of their dishes. This all being said, I like their calamari appetizer and their pizookies. Say what you will about a dessert dish that amounts to a cookie with ice cream on it, but god almighty those things are delicious. Come to think of it, the last time I was there, I got a stout and an oreo pizookie. It's probably not possible to get a better meal at BJ's."
Lourdes S.,"Coral Springs, FL",24,17,3,1.0,6/3/2015,Very crappy experience I had today. I was pretty excited to see that they delivered and I orders through the 24hreat service so I place my order an hour and a half after it shows up I look for my silverware and nothing it wouldn't be an issue if I wasn't at a hotel without silverware. So I call 24hr eats and then they are like you never selected the option to get silverware. Never ever ever in my life I had to select and pay for silverware and I even went back to the website that I ordered from and there was no option to even select silverware. At this point they transfer me to the manager at bjs and he says it's not his fault since they were supposed to charge me for the silverware they just can't include it. wTF. Since I ordered through 24eats there is nothing he can do about it so now my food is cold and j have no silverware no one will compensate me or even come pick up this cold food. Neither places will take blame for me not getting my silverware and I have never heard of a place that charges for silverware. Point blank I will NEVER go to bjs or through the 24hr eats service horrible service and horrible cold fools .
Nay S.,"Visalia, CA",55,31,2,5.0,3/26/2015,"My experience was great today!! My server was very friendly and attentive, I think her name was Andy. We ordered the glazed pork, (very delicious) pull pork sandwich and the mini corn dog with French fries. It was our first time there and I would definitely come back, even though I live an hour away. :-)"
Brittny R.,"Fresno, CA",19,61,15,2.0,1/12/2016,"i've been here a couple times before and had okay experiences, nothing spectacular. this time though was just disappointing. i met my father and sisters this past sunday for drinks and appetizers. it didn't seem that busy. it took us about ten minutes to get seated which was good. then we ordered drinks and put in our app orders. i got a bj's mojito, my sisters got martinis and they were all super strong....so strong that we watered them down a little bit then proceeded to choke them down. my dad got a glass of wine. as my dad was about to take a sip my sister noticed lip stick all around the edges. the strong drinks we could overlook but a dirty glass...um no. we told our waitress and she grabbed it...inspected it to see if there actually was ""lipstick on the glass"". then she took it, tried to laugh it off and took forever to bring him another glass. meanwhile, we are still waiting for our appetizers. our calamari was way over cooked...it was very brown and greasy. the avocado egg rolls were de-lish but the flatbread pizza we got was extremely crispy around the edges. i hate leaving bad reviews butttt it was just so upsetting. not returning again."
Cyn P.,"Fresno, CA",0,50,10,4.0,7/2/2015,"Beer was good, food was good, wait staff attentive. Fun afternoon with a bestie. I like the atmosphere. Always new and different menu. Still got my fav-wedge salad."
Lorence L.,"Fresno, CA",8,148,189,4.0,5/24/2012,"The service was great, she was actually interested in having a little small talk, interesting because usually it's the ""what can I get you to drink?"" then that's it.  The pizza was cooked to perfection.  The thick Chicago style crust was not greasy or floppy."
Jay C.,"Intercourse, PA",39,38,10,1.0,8/21/2011,"TRIED going tonight, hours say they're open till 1am.  Call just before 11pm to check whether the kitchen is open or just bar...girl answering the phone tells me ""okay, yeah,"" and hangs up on me...call back and they judt pick up the phone and hang it up again.  Head over and get there around 11:30 to be told ""we're not seating anymore""...really?! ended up at cheesecake factory instead. Two previous experiences also bad...one, supposedly no pagers, but couples after us magically got them, and got seated ahead of us. Other, a birthday group who were basically stuck in a corner and forgotten."
Ty J.,"Fresno, CA",1,30,14,4.0,2/17/2013,"I love the crispy thin fries here. LOVE them. (Well... when they're hot.) And the chili. It's all beer-y and delicious. They used to have a meatball sandwich and that was my standby. It's gone now. T.T The menu is extensive and it's usually a safe bet that if we come here everyone can find something they like. For a chain, I'm impressed by the tastiness of the food and the reasonable prices."
Anne B.,"Merced, CA",286,325,7,1.0,8/13/2011,"Terrible.  My fiancee and I went here before noon on a Saturday to avoid the lunch crowd.  As we'd hoped, the restaurant was relatively empty and we were greeted quickly by a hostess.  She proceeded to seat us at a table in a sea of empty booths.  I asked if we could sit at a booth instead.  She responded that all those sections were closed. ""Really?""  I asked.  Of the diners that were there, all were seated in booths and there were several empty booths adjacent to them.  ""Those sections next to those people are empty?"" ""Umm."" she replied.  I could see her brain working.  ""Let me check.""  In the minutes it took for her to check if we could sit in one of the many vacant booths, my fiancee and I decided to take our money elsewhere.  I've been to many many restaurants in my day and have never had to beg to sit at an empty two-person booth when there are several available, in a restaurant that was hardly crowded. Sorry BJ's Fresno.  We won't be back!"
Michael C.,"Fresno, CA",26,345,68,3.0,9/3/2013,"Let me start by saying I have mixed feelings about this place. We walked in and was greeted by the hostess. We asked for a table. She said there was about a 10 minute wait. I seen that there was 2 open chairs at the bar, so I told her we would be sitting at the bar. She said OK. I did notice there was those little pagers on the hostess stand, but she didn't offer us one. So we sat at the bar and ordered a few cocktails and enjoyed the very large flat screen while we waited. I enjoyed a Abbey Ale beer on the very friendly bartenders recommendation. Great beer and only 4 bucks. After about 15 minutes, i figured I would go to the hostess station and see what was happening. She says and I quote "" Oh, there you are Mike. I have been calling ur name for a few minutes. I gave your table away, I will have one for you shortly."" I said, "" you knew I was at the bar!"" She said she was sorry and would seat me as soon as possible. So, back to the bar for another great beer. After another 15 minutes, I returned to the hostess station. A different gal was there, and she said, ""I don't see you name on the list"". I started to explain what happened and then the other gal returned and seated us right away. Normally I would be a little upset, but we were not in a hurry and were enjoying our time at the bar so it didn't bother me too much. But what are the little pagers for if they don't use them. Just sayin!!! After we were seated our waitress came and greeted us. She was very friendly and answered our questions about the menu items we were interested in. So we decided to order the- Calamari App BBQ full rack  Double deluxe burger The calamari came, and some pieces were cruncy and tasty and some of the pieces were soggy and terrible. How does that happen. Did they fry two batches and give it to us???? WTF?? The two dippin sauces were just average. Our salads came and they were fresh and tasty. I really like the croutons. They were great! Our dinner came, and I must say the burger and fries were VERY GOOD!! The patty's were cooked to med rare as I asked. They had a nice char on the outside and some pink in the middle. Very tasty burger!!! Now to the ribs. I must say that my better half is spoiled when it comes to BBQ. Not to blow my own horn, but I've been smoking meat for a long time and I can put out some awful good BBQ. The ribs were tender and juicy, but lacked a good spice rub. So the meat was somewhat bland. I can swear that I've tasted their BBQ sauce before and I've never eatin here before. So it kind of reminds me of one of those sauces in a bottle. But I could be wrong. Overall, this place is OK for me. I will come again and try something else cause the hamburger and fries were very good and our server was very nice. Cant say much about the hostess station though!"
Kiara M.,"San Diego, CA",8,14,10,1.0,4/18/2015,"We came to Bjs to celebrate my dads graduation. I understand it was extremely busy but after waiting an hour to be seated none of us were bothered by that, it wasn't until our waiter started talking about us to the other servers, he was bothered because he had to get multiple refills for our party and when he came back he said ""is there anything else you guys need while I'm right here""  he was rolling his eyes and talking to himself while putting away the plates. Mind you he's only 3 feet away where the computers are so my sister and I are watching his every move. My sister and aunt actually spoke to the manager who was very concerned and wished we told him sooner about our service. To our waiter ""Timothy"" (tall, white, short spiky hair) I hope your day turns around because I would hate for you to ruin another families celebration."
Travis H.,"Fresno, CA",60,434,57,4.0,1/4/2014,"We love eating here. It is open late and if you come during the busy time, find your own seat and sit in the bar. Have always had great service and staff and the price is unbeatable."
Joshua R.,"Fresno, CA",1,4,,5.0,11/27/2011,"BJ's food has always been pretty good and their service is pretty good but they are getting 5 stars from me because of my experience tonight.... I had a problem with my meal that we called in.The manager(Carl) listen to what I said, did a GREAT job of addressing my issue, gave me back my money for entire meal(even tho half of the meal was made perfectly) then refused to let me pay for my new order! That's how u take care of a customer. We usually don't come here often but after this great customer service that's going to change!!! Great job and thank you Carl!"
R S.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",0,4,,1.0,4/9/2016,"Well, the food was marginal (a way over done hamburger, and way overdone chicken in another sandwich), but worse has been after we left: I left my credit card there (in error) and discovered that fact a few days later when i was at home, more than 100 miles away, so I called (and they confirmed that they had my card). They did tell me that they usually don't mail credit cards, but that I should call back and talk to the manager, or send him an email. I opted for email, and he never wrote back or called - and on several subsequent calls, he was 'not in' or 'busy' -- so please call back. On about the fourth call, the lady said: let me check and see if we have your card - Now they said they didn't. And they asked who i talked to (who knows??) and said that the manager was not working that day..........Figuring that this endeavor was hopeless, I called the credit card company and they sent me a new one (thankfully, with the same account number) -- Thank you Sean Madden! NOT"
Stacey R.,"Fresno, CA",9,31,1,4.0,8/4/2011,"For all of you out there who cannot have gluten, this is the place to go for gluten free pizza! This pizza crust is amazing, and satisfies the lack of pizza in a g-free diet. They also have a gluten free beer!  Service is hit and miss, although when I let them know I'm on a tight time frame, they always come through."
Garrett J.,"Fresno, CA",12,10,,3.0,8/23/2012,"I really feel like the Fresno BJs in particular is a very hit or miss affair.  I've been a few times where it's great, and a few times where it's really really bad. And when it's bad, the wait staff usually doesn't really care because of the pace of the restaurant and the time it takes to bake another pizza or entree. Go for the Pizookie and drinks... then leave!"
