Nick A.,"Fresno, CA",216,251,505,2.0,4/27/2009,"I try to get out of going to this place whenever I can. ""Oh you're having your birthday dinner where? Sorry, just remembered I have to change the oil in my car... Then cut my fingernails or something. I'll meet up with you for drinks after.""  Ha. I wish it were that easy. I just hate this place. The food's not all that bad, I'd put it just under Applebee's or Denny's quality, I've had an appetizer there I actualy liked once. There's a greeter/hostess there, that every time I've been there, asks me my name and says she could have sworn she knows me from somewhere. I mean I was cool with it the first time. But really now, out of the 3 or 4 times I've been here, she's been there and trips me out every time while she stares at me intently trying to place where she knows me from as I'm eating my food. I honestly have no idea who the hell she is. The place in theory would be well suited for a birthday or large gathering since it's so large, but their mixed drinks suck and so do their in-house beers. Unfortunately for the world, you don't get any other option, They don't carry real beer. Or Bud Light. Only their own cheap knock-offs of real beers. I mean, I could put up with the bland food if this was a fun place to meet and get drinks, but as a place that calls itself a brewery, they should be doing a lot better job with that. Maybe the pizza's good? I haven't had it, but something has to keep this place in business. I know it's what their known for aside from their baked potato (big, dry and flavorless) and pizookie (a cookie they grabbed from Hungry Bear inside the mall and dropped  a scoop of ice cream on and decide to charge people money for it.) In conclusion- Cheesecake Factory is the place to go if you have to choose between the two. Just don't get a fountain drink or whatnot from Cheesecake- it's almost the same price as a mixed drink."
Anna G.,"Fresno, CA",0,2,,1.0,11/2/2014,"this place is terrible.  I had decent service but food was very disapointing. I got the deep dish pizza, and I could have got a better and cheaper pizza at little caeser's . my daughter the chicken tenders and I make better chicken than that at home.  safe your money and stay home. this place is just a big name shit hole."
Monika K.,"Clovis, CA",0,10,1,1.0,5/16/2015,"It's been a few years since I've eaten at BJs and now I remember why. I went for lunch today and the food was awful. My nieces Mac and cheese had no flavor. It tasted like it came from a box. My sisters chicken Alfredo only had 3 small pieces of chicken. She ordered the full size, not the lunch size. The broccoli was over cooked and soggy. There was hardly any Alfredo sauce. The clam chowder was too salty. I order the lasagna. Except it wasn't lasagna. It's actually layered large ravioli with sauce on top. It tasted like microwave pizza. My sister sent the pasta back and it was taken off the bill. I should've sent mine back too. But I felt bad. The Service was good. The waitress was nice, peppy and attentive. We will not be eating there again."
Joanna A.,"Madera, CA",68,9,,5.0,6/26/2011,"Ok- So I have been to this place before, ehhh it was ok, never really knew what to get. But this last time I went with my Mom and we do this thing where we each order something different, then split the plate so we each share what the other person has.... it's a great way to get the most out of our dining experience, especially since we both enjoy trying new plates. So i ordered the California Burger and my Mom got the Fish Tacos.  Now before i go any further... i'm pregnant (very pregnant) so i'm not exactly sure whether or not it's my heightened state of senses?... but our food was AMAZING, i mean- so good, i felt compelled to go back to the kitchen and kiss the cook! Do not fear. I decided to finish my delicious lunch instead. The service was good, we had to wait a while for our food, but it was so worth it! Mmmm!"
Jinzo J.,"Modesto, CA",1,49,25,5.0,2/28/2015,"I've been avoiding getting food at this place for years, in the past i'm here only to drink. Last night we actually dinned in instead of waiting for a seat at the bar table. We ordered their best before appetizer,  it came with egg rolls, and thin miniature egg roll taste like Lumpia egg rolls, cheese sticks which I'm not crazy for. The egg rolls and the miniature size rolls were delicious. I had a bowl of their clam chowder and oh my it was delicious 8.5/10 it can hang on its own with Dukes clam chowder and Moe's up in the NorthWest. The highlight of the night was the Buffalo burger. The pattie had to be the best I've had 10/10 and I've had burgers all over in several different states. Here you can taste the hint of smoke flavor in combination with the seasoning locked in by the sear marks. Easily best patty in a burger I've had. As the for burger as a whole it was really good 9/10. Definately in my top 5. Just because its not a small mom & pop joint doesnt mean you wont find good food here. Now I will no longer enjoy just a beer here. Ipa and bison burger please."
Joe D.,"Fresno, CA",1,7,1,5.0,6/8/2014,Great place to kick back and enjoy great food and a beer. We make it a point to eat at a JBs any chance we get.
Laura L.,"Fresno, CA",1,13,,3.0,5/28/2015,"It was my first time here yesterday. We were there for a going away party for one of my good friends. We had a group of 15 people and I felt like the service we received for a large group was actually good. Our waitress took a while to come and get our orders, but  we were all catching up so we didn't really notice it. I ordered the Seared Ahi Tuna Salad and on the menu it says that there is cilantro in the salad. When we ordered the salad and asked for the cilantro to be taken out...the waitress was like yea of course and then she comes back and says that they don't put cilantro in any of their salads. Okkaaayyy... then why was it on the menu?? None of us got our waters refilled and I was so thirsty that I drank my friend's glass of water too. I also checked my bank account this morning and it looks like they charged me twice for my tab. I'll be waiting for the charge to either clear on its own or I'll be going in to the restaurant tomorrow to complain."
Meagan E.,"Fresno, CA",517,112,53,3.0,8/6/2011,"I definitely really love BJ's pizza, and if that's what you're looking for, they have a great lunch-time price for a mini pizza with a salad. So that's a plus, especially since their caesar salad is really good. The croutons have the perfect level of crunch. Besides that, the beer is good, and the pizookies are awesome. They used to have a really great lasagna, but it's been off the menu for a while now, which basically depresses me, but oh well.  The atmosphere is cool. Nice place, good to just hangout with some friends or go on a casual date.  The reason I give it 3 stars is because the service is SO hit or miss. Almost every time I order an appetizer, or a salad, or any sort of starter, it comes at almost the exact same time as the food. This is annoying. I want to be able to digest for a second between courses. Also, besides this one waiter I've had there (dirty blonde, wavy-ish hair?), the servers I've had have been so.. forgettable. Not that they're terrible servers or anything, but they're just not going out of their way to be good servers. Very technical--take the order, walk away, bring food, walk away.. no personality. And I've even had one waitress who was borderline RUDE the entire time she was taking our party. Yes, we had 20 people in our party, and yes, we all were in our early 20's, but HELLO, we have a large party, which means you're getting gratuity. The least you could do is be friendly."
Leah S.,"Kingsburg, CA",3,9,4,5.0,7/10/2013,All I have to say is TRY THE GLUTEN FREE TOMATO BISQUE!!!!! It is to DIe for!  I love it so much my husband went after work all the way from Visalia to Fresno and then back down to Kingsburg to surprise me with it when I was sick. Not many places even have a gluten free menu much less a good one.
AJ A.,"Fresno, CA",0,1,,5.0,5/8/2015,"I've been going to BJ's for years now, and it's always been good, but a recent experience was so good, I'm writing my first review. The food was great as always, but our server Justin (formerly of World Sports Cafe) was fantastic. He was friendly, funny, and energetic; He truly made it a memorable experience. BJ's is lucky to have him."
Jess S.,"Fresno, CA",0,13,,4.0,6/3/2012,I LOVED the service and attention to detail these servers have. The facility was very neatly kept and the prices were decent. My food was outstanding and the prices were pretty decent. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is due to the hostess looking DIRECTLY past me to some guy and trying to help him  first( alright girl see How long you keep your job  with that garbage)
Carlos C.,"Sacramento, CA",12,25,8,5.0,3/3/2015,"Arrived and was quickly seated, server took order for drink less than 5 mins, returned with drink ordered food took about 16 mins (NY bone in steak w/mash and broccoli) to be served and the steak was excellent best I've had and price for everything was within reason. My server was Amy she did a fabulous job really made my dinner after a long day very pleasant Thank You Very Much!!"
Paul J.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,50,1,2.0,7/28/2014,"A chain restaurant can never rise above it's weakest link, and this one has got plenty.  The doughy pizza sucked the saliva right out of my mouth; when I asked if they'd forgotten the sauce, I was told that all the pizzas are made with a prescribed amount of sauce the night before. The Asian salad was made with onions, which was not noted on the menu. The manager took it off of our bill (which reflected the fine service overall) but the kitchen seems like a mess. I would not eat here again."
Joseph M.,"Fresno, CA",28,29,20,5.0,4/23/2013,"I love coming to BJs, everytime I go, I get good customer service and the food is always good also"
Tim C.,"Sacramento, CA",2,15,1,1.0,5/10/2013,Mini pizza is extremely bare and unappetizing.  I asked for the chef to discuss and waited an extremely long time for anyone to show up.
Deanna A.,"Fresno, CA",46,9,2,1.0,4/17/2014,"Only because 0 stars isn't an option!! waited 20+ mins in an unbusy restaurant... Wrong meals came cold!!! Meals for family of 7 all served 10 mins apart!! ""manager"" comps same kids meal 2x on different checks!!! The worst place ever!!!!"
Joshua B.,"Fresno, CA",32,167,90,3.0,7/30/2011,"If you like deep dish pizza, you absolutely have to try BJ's. I'm not saying it's best, but it's excellent and they have a number of unique combinations. Food is always good, but service is bad or barely acceptable most of the time. I stopped going because of that a few years ago, just went back and I see it's the same, even though I've contacted management in the past. Sad, since I love their specials. Stop in for an Irish root beer, if nothing else. :) Visits: 6-8"
Mmmouse V.,"Fresno, CA",10,9,3,5.0,4/24/2011,"The fall brings their bomb pumpkin ale. I've been finding myself going their more and more just get a couple of pints.  Go now, get one and catch a game on the screens in their bar area.  The bar is the best place to sit. I always get amazing service there, but it's only good for a couple people per table. The food never disappoints. I'm a huge fan of their flatbread appetitizer pizzas, broccoli cheddar and tomato bisque soups. If you want to feel fat for sure lol have their massively stuffed baked potatoes with veggies, cheese and Alfredo sauce. Soooo good!"
Elle L.,"Fresno, CA",14,20,,4.0,2/16/2013,"I really like the bar at BJs. The waitresses are always really great and their food is pretty good. I would totally reccomend this place to everyone, and I especially reccommend sitting at the bar. Also, best alcoholc root beer here EVER!!"
Ryan A.,"Clovis, CA",12,13,1,5.0,12/12/2013,"Love this place!  I always get the same thing when I go: Jeremiah Red, roast beef dip sandwich, and a wedge salad! If I'm not too full from the beer, I'll order a pizookie for dessert :)"
