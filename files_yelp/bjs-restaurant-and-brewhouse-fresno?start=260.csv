Monique S.,"McLean, VA",0,78,12,2.0,2/26/2015,"Long waits, poor service, mediocre food, and high prices. Definitely not in my top 20 restaurants to eat at in Fresno. There are a lot better locally owned places with better quality food and prices. The only time I come here is when someone chooses to have their birthday here. Why someone would is beyond me! It is comparable to Fridays or Applebees. Either way, not good."
Jess M.,"San Mateo, CA",2,121,57,1.0,7/25/2013,I don't know why I keep giving this place a chance. Everything we go it takes almost an hour to get our food. Every single time. Once it took an hour to reheat something. Restaurants should have your food out in an average of 12 mins. If there busy them maybe 15-20. Not 30 mins to 45 to almost an hour. Plus they hate splitting bills an are really rude if you are a party offer them 4. An the food is average. Nothing so amazing you can't go some place else to eat.
Roy H.,"Pahrump, NV",2,74,,4.0,8/31/2013,This relatively new chain is going to be a hit.  Great menu with lots of choices.  Service was very good and the staff is very pleasant.  The calamari appetizer was very good.  I had the Jambalaya which was nearly as good as any I have had in New Orleans.  Lots of meat and only needed a touch of hot sauce to bring it up to NOLA standards.  My wife had the pasta limon and said it was great too.  Huge piece of grilled chicken on that one.  We will become BJ's fans as we travel around the west.
Mathew R.,"Kerman, CA",0,3,2,2.0,2/9/2014,"Good food, everyone at my table got their good except for me! The waitress forgot to put my order in so I just sat and watched everyone else eat and got my food when everyone else was already done, ended up just taking it to go. This is my second time coming, last time was good, this time, disappointing. Hopefully next time they get my order right next time."
Jessica H.,"Orangevale, CA",299,399,213,3.0,10/21/2010,"Fine. Fine. And fine. Nothing special. There is a good selection of food choices, at places like this I say stick to pizza and appetizers as it's what they do best.  They have a pizookie thing which is a fresh baked cookie served with ice cream. There was so much hype behind it I really HAD to try it, but it was just eh.  If you like the chain restaurant thing, go. You'll be happy."
Bianca P.,"Fresno, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/25/2014,Lousy service. I ordered online for curbside pick up and when I arrived I called the number on the sign and the girl that answered the phone hung up on me so rudely after telling me they don't bring your food outside. So I walk inside which was so embarrassing because I was in my pjs this was not part of the plan. Once I was inside I told the hostess I was there to pick up some take out and she directed me to stand like a dumb idiot by the bar area and I did. Since I've worked in the food business I was being patient then a few minutes go by and all the employees clearly ignore me and when I noticed they attended other customers before me I was out of there. It was not a pleasing experience. This type of behavior is unacceptable. I will never go back to this restaurant and I have contacted someone at the corporate level to make sure these employees step up their game because they are hurting this business with lousy employees such as the hostess. Besides the food isn't anything to brag about. I'm better off sticking with Cheese Cake Factory where they have excellent customer service and good food.
Tim S.,"San Jose, CA",20,83,43,4.0,6/3/2013,"I've been here well over 15 times, and never have I had a bad experience. Workers are always very professional and friendly. Good selection of beer from their own brewery. Great place to have dinner or lunch with friends and family. The wait can be quite long on the weekends so make sure to call ahead to put your name on the wait-list."
Vida V.,"Fresno, CA",16,45,,3.0,6/24/2013,"Would recommend the shrimp lettuce wrap appetizer, of course the pizookie, and the beer tasters.  Like other BJ's out there. Good atmosphere, good food, but parking can be a pain."
Lonny W.,"Lemoore, CA",34,167,68,3.0,5/20/2013,Busy at lunch time so be ready to wait. It is near Fresno State so you have a mix of college kids and people that just want to hang around school. Anyway it is ok but if your on a diet like I should be it would be a good idea to stay away from this place. Otherwise good food and loved the big screen TV's showing the Angels.
Virlie B.,"Portland, OR",108,625,174,3.0,2/12/2011,Food is actually pretty good. Great place for a dinner party with friends. Not too over-priced considering the quality of food but it's definitely a sorority/fraternity  hang out. That depends on you whether that's a plus or a minus.
Jennifer M.,"Fresno, CA",0,21,3,1.0,6/22/2016,"we went in for dinner last night and my fiance had a salad with his meal and there was a hair in it. the manager came and talked to us and said it would be taken off our bill. when it was time to order dessert the waitress kept saying she would come back to clear our dinner plates and never did so when we finally did get dessert the table was crowded and the dessert order was wrong  before i could say anything she walked away i waited for her to come back but the dessert was melting so i got up to talk to the manager. the manager said she would get me the correct order and take the other desserts off the bill for our long wait. when i got back to the table the waitress finally showed up and when she asked what was wrong i told her the manager was already taking care of it she said in a very rude tone "" well thanks for that"" and walked away. at that point i got up again and told the manager we needed the check we were being treated rude and wanted to leave. we had a terrible time."
Timmy B.,"Clovis, CA",16,122,13,4.0,5/12/2010,Love this place for lunch. You can get in and out very quickly and the service is great. For lunch go for their specials which are a very good value and always hit the spot. Their is a kids menu which always includes these happy face fries which the kids (and adults) love.  For dinner you can't miss with the pizza although the place can get rather busy and you'd be wise to call ahead.
Christine N.,"Raleigh, NC",247,418,26,1.0,2/19/2010,"I like BJs food but that's about it.  We came with a large group on a Friday night, and while there's always a crowd out front, it looked like there was plenty of wait staff working on the tables.  Our server was quick to take our orders, but when we asked to split our checks we met resistance.  She grumbled about being able to do it but not really wanting to.  In the end she took our orders and supposedly split it out.  Well apparently halfway through our meal, she went to take a break, but never let us know... she just disappeared.  When we finally found another waiter, to refill our drinks, give us the bill, etc., he knew nothing about the split check and just handed us one lump bill, even though we told him she was dividing it for us.  He said she didn't and that he couldn't.  Of course, after our whole table worked out the mess, she reappeared! The whole situation was really a reflection of poor customer service.  So really, the only positive experience this evening was that we didn't have to wait with the ridiculous crowd outside as they accept call aheads to get on their seating list.  Yup, that's it.   Oh yeah, and the parking lot was a zoo.  We had at least two separate cars trying to steal the spot we clearly had been waiting for, people screaming obsenities at each other, blaring horns... lovely."
Albert A.,"Davis, CA",353,117,180,3.0,11/14/2012,"I only really go here for the Pizooki, not going to lie. 5 stars for this, 3 stars for the food."
Nhia T.,"Fresno, CA",19,21,1,3.0,3/17/2013,"Mediocre food and expensive.  Ordered a burger, salmon dish, and a beer.  Burger was nothing interesting.  Salmon was undercooked but that means they can always heat it up.  Beer was the only thing exciting there.  The other BJs I have been to was in Vegas.  They always carry good beer.  Get the STOUT, you will not regret it.  For 3 things and it cost me 40 bucks.  Kind of expensive, but the service was great."
Matt H.,"Fresno, CA",0,80,1,4.0,5/4/2014,Their food is pretty good and their house beer selection is great.  I wouldn't say anything really stands out as great but it's a solid place to get some food.
Crystal B.,"Reedley, CA",14,46,67,4.0,8/20/2010,"I love Bj's restaurant! They have yummy brushetta! And awesome fettucine Alfredo! Get it with blackened chicken! Omg the spicy marinera pasta is yummy!! But beware it is HOT!! And I love spicy! Yummy balsamic chicken/mashed potatoes, and delicious pizzas!! I only wish I tried their beers, but I never remember too, overall we love it!"
Darren M.,"Sacramento, CA",92,507,35,4.0,10/14/2010,"Good food, good service, AWESOME happy hours. This is al.  Once again I love you BJ's brewhouse. ooh and don;t be afraid to ask for a to go cup of their amazing rootbeer!!!"
Robert E.,"Fresno, CA",8,7,8,5.0,7/28/2012,"I got the nachos and the piranha p.a. The beer is everything a pale ale should be and the nachos left nothing to be desired. Our bartender Mike was great! He gave us colorful reviews and had excellent knowledge of the menu. The TVs above the bar ensured everyone could see their game. The big screen on the middle was very impressive too. I also liked the noise level - not extremely loud, but very lively. I will definitely be going back for happy hour."
Danielle P.,"Clovis, CA",0,3,,1.0,12/27/2013,"Been to this place a few times and the food has pretty much always been good. Service however is terrible. The past two times me and my boyfriend have decided to eat here we were greeted by a very not friendly manager. This past time we visited she proceeded to tell me that the dining area was closed and that we had to sit at the bar. This I would have been fine with if it were true but it was only 10pm and the door clearly marked there hours, an stated that the dinning room didn't close till 12! I then told her that we ha been here just last week at 1030 and didn't have a problem siting down in the dinning room them so why are you closed now? The answer she rudely have me was and I quote "" because we are closed today, so you can sit in the bar"" wow! Lady was very rude. So instead of giving up an walking out like we should've we were hungry so we went to the bar. When we get there it took someone 10 mins to even greet us and when our food did arrive we had no silverware! Will not be returning until they get their service standards raised. I work in a restaurant and I know that this is not how they should be operating. Get it together bjs!"
